["Q: Reporting specific Ubuntu Software Center issues? To whom or where do I report issues with the Ubuntu Software Center?\nI am trying to download OpenShot and it tells me that I have no Internet connection... Despite the fact that I do have a working Internet connection and I was able to install an unrelated program using the Ubuntu Software Center.\nClearly there is something wrong with this specific program...\n\nA: Try these steps to install the package:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get the package name.\n\n*Use this command in a terminal, replace package with the name from step 1.\nsudo apt-get install 'package'\n\n\n*The package should then be installed. \nIf these steps worked, it is a Software Center problem, you can report it via the steps in this question: How do I report a bug?.\n", "Q: List Video Filename and Duration for multiple files in folder and subfolders with path too if possible I need to get a list of filenames and path along with the duration of the file. All are video files. Some files are in subfolders as well. I need the list sorted according to duration.\nMy goal is to delete the files which have a duration lower than 2 minutes.\nIs there someway I can do it through terminal or GUI?\n\nA: this should give you a list of mp4s less than 120 seconds in the folder specified including sub folders \nfind ~/pathtofolder -iname '*.mp4' -type f > vidfiles && while read f; do echo -n \"$f: \"; ffprobe -v error -show_entries format=duration -of default=noprint_wrappers=1:nokey=1 \"$f\"; done < vidfiles | awk '$NF<120' > shortvids\n\nJust change the ~/pathtofolder to your target location.\nThe list will be in a file called shortvids\nI apologize for not sorting but I don't see the need if the only files in the list are the short videos. \nIf you would like to change the duration, near the end change '$NF<120' to the number of seconds.  For example '$NF<300' would mean \"duration less than 5 minutes(or 300 seconds)\"\nof course you can also find durations greater than or equal to by changing the sign ie. < to > or =\n\nA: You are out of luck without using external programmes, file videoname.xyz does not return the duration of the videos. On the other hand, avprobe (ffprobe) from the package libav-tools does!\nYou would need to perform a recursive directory walk (e.g. in Python), call avprobe (via a subprocess), parse the duration from the output and store play length and filename in a suitable structure.\n", "Q: ubuntu rightclick command line custom backup os: ubuntu 12.04 LTS,\nkernel: 3.8.0-35-generic kernel,\nwhen i right click on \"text file/s\",\ni would like to have a custom menu, to run a bash, \nto make a backup copy of text file/s i'm right clicking on.\nsuppose i right click on the following three files:\n/home/user_name/folder/file_1\n/home/user_name/folder/file_2.c\n/home/user_name/folder/file_3.sh\n\nsuppose time stamp is 2013/12/31 23:59:59\ni would like to have the following:\n/home/user_name/folder/20131231_235959/file_1.bak\n/home/user_name/folder/20131231_235959/file_2.c.bak\n/home/user_name/folder/20131231_235959/file_3.sh.bak\n\nhow do i make this little toy? any help?\n\nA: You could easily achieve this using Thunar and its Edit > Configure custom actions.

I would like to have at least one alternative keyboard layout for the Albanian language provided as a distro update or as part of future releases of Ubuntu. Could anyone let me know where or how I could submit a proposal to the developers?\nThe \"official\" Albanian layout is somewhat inadequate and highly unpopular among Albanian users. For that reason, I have created and published two alternative layouts that take into account the market in Albanian-speaking countries (dominated by US mechanical keyboards) and user preferences (for a layout similar to the US model).\nYou may find more information about the layout on Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_keyboard_layout#Plisi) or on my Albanian-language website (http://www.plisi.al/softwer/tastiera-plisi-d) where you may also download the installation files.\n\nA: I'm not sure, but I think you may want to  submit a bug report against the xkeyboard-config package in Ubuntu together with a patch or merge proposal to the Bazaar branch.\nHowever, xkeyboard-config is an upstream package, and the chances for a patch to be included in Ubuntu increase if you also file a bug + patch to the upstream maintainer.\n", "Q: apt-get update not working + ubuntu 32-bit Vs 64-bit I am a newbie to linux platform.Please don't mark this question as duplicate before reading it completely.!\nMy system is running on intel i5 processor and the OS I recently installed is 64-bit Ubuntu 13.10.

This is not a problem. I can and I am doing this. However, is it possible to use the same USB disk in different computers? With different computers I mean different hardware. \nLike installing lubuntu on a 32-bit computer with a specific hardware, and then plugging-in the usb into another 32-bit computer. \nCan my Lubuntu understand that the hardware is changed and fixes itself depending on the hardware? \nIs this method faster than live-usb? I guess it is. But, the after the hardware change, will it become faster? \nLive-usb installation takes too long and works really really slow. I want to make the process faster. I want to plug the usb into computer and boot it as fast as possible. \nWhat can I do to speed up this process? \nDoes installing lubuntu on a usb with computer A, and then plugging in the usb stick to computer B works? Does that usb stick, that operating system understand the hardware change and fix accordingly? \nThank you very much in advance. \n\nA: My experience is that the 32-bit version of Ubuntu (I prefer Xubuntu) works just fine on any computer when configured as a LiveUSB. I take the same stick and plug it in different computers (32- or 64-bit), then the kernel detects all necessary hardware at load time and loads the required drivers. It has worked for me on several occasions without a hitch (well, unless Ubuntu has incompatibilities with specific hardware). \nIf you're actually looking into installing Ubuntu on the USB key (NOT just a LiveUSB), then I would suggest to check out this question: How do I install Ubuntu to a USB key? (without using Startup Disk Creator). I've never tried something like this, and there might be issues here and there, but I would expect the kernel to handle hardware changes intelligently.\n\nA: I haven't tried this in practice yet, but to my knowledge even an installed version of Ubuntu will detect hardware changes on boot, so in theory installing to a USB drive and plugging it into a different computer should work in general. Once the system boots, it should adapt to the hardware in the machine just like the live USB does.\nOne potential issue is that GRUB might address the wrong drive if you use the USB disk in a computer with a different drive configuration then the one with which you installed the USB disk. As a result, it might try to boot from the wrong disk. You might want to do some research into how GRUB addresses drives and how to make sure it will pick the right one.\nHowever, performance degradation with a UDB disk is largely due to the fact that certain write operations (specifically, modifying data in a sector) are time-consuming on Flash memory (the core component of every USB stick). Solid-state-drives have some extra logic to speed things up, but USB sticks generally don't. So any operation which involves a lot of writing to the disk (swapping comes to mind) will slow you down. If performance is crucial, look into getting a USB hard disk (i.e. with a magnetic disk inside).\n", "Q: Ubuntu installation not showing correct HDD size I am a complete newbie to Linux family ( been with Windows till now). I am trying to install Ubuntu from my USB drive so that my laptop has both windows 7 and Ubuntu along side. When I am selecting the automatic installation option, incorrect HDD size is coming. For eg my HDD is of 320Gb with close to 80 GB free but on the ubuntu installer it is showing something else. I am worried that by installing I don't lose any data. Here're screenshots:\n\n\n\nA: This is simple and classic confusion of base 10 vs base 2.  For decades the computer industry defined the term \"Kilobyte\" to mean 1024 bytes rather than 1000.  Hard drive manufacturers like to inflate their numbers to sell more units, so they define it to be 1000, thus when they say a 320 GB drive, they mean a drive with 320,000,000,000 bytes.  In base 2 units, that is only 298 GiB.  Note the addition of the 'i' as in recent years the trend is to use this to indicate it really is base 2 rather than base 10, as one might expect with \"GB\".\n", "Q: mei_me unexpected reset Yesterday I experienced some troubles with my ubuntu installation.

Recently I installed the wubi version of ubuntu in my desktop and I have the following problem: It cannot be connected to the wired network. When I use the PC in windows-7 mode everything is ok.\nUbuntu version: Ubuntu 12.04.4 LTS \nAny idea of what can cause this problem?\nSome extra info about ethernet card:\n02:00.0 Ethernet controller [0200]: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. RTL8111/8168/8411 PCI Express Gigabit Ethernet Controller [10ec:8168] (rev 06)\nThanks in advance.  \n\nA: When I started Ubuntu I had the same problem. My solution was ensuring that networking was enabled. To do this: click on the wifi/arrows that signify the internet connect and near the bottom you can check/uncheck \"Enable Networking\". That may seem somewhat trivial, but that is what happened to me and several others.\n\nA: Your problem might be drivers.\nIf your computer came with Windows, the drivers were probably installed there. But they might not be in Ubuntu.\nTry installing the drivers for your network card, this should be the drivers you need:\nhttp://www.realtek.com/downloads/downloadsView.aspx?Langid=1&PNid=13&PFid=5&Level=5&Conn=4&DownTypeID=3&GetDown=false#2\nRemember to grab the drivers for linux, not Windows ;)\nGood Luck.\n", "Q: How to eject RAMDisk?

The last one is in dependencies. I tried to solve that by typing:  \nsudo apt -get install mysql-workbench-community-6.0.9-1ubu1204-i386.deb\n\nBut unfortunately I got this error:\n\nsudo: apt: command not found\n\nHow can I do that with Ubuntu 12.04?\n\nA: The proper command is apt-get instead of apt get.\nYou need to be careful when typing commands, as you can do lots of damage. For example, typing mkfs.ext3 /dev/sda instead of mkfs.ext3 /dev/sdb will destroy all data on that drive.\nTHe command's proper form is:\nsudo apt-get install mysql-workbench\n\nThe above command fetches mysql workbench from the official Ubuntu repository. A repository is a web server containing many programs or files.\nIt seems like you already downloaded the .deb file associated with the mysql-workbench package, so you can just install it by cd /path/where/you/downloaded/file/ and then running command:\nsudo dpkg -i mysql-workbench-community-6.0.9-1ubu1204-i386.deb\n\nEDIT: If you have dependency problems, you should try sudo apt-get -f install\n", "Q: How to make ubuntu-13.10-server installation writable?

It came with Windows 7 installed, and I installed Ubuntu 12.04 in a dual boot configuration. As far as I remember I installed everything accepting defaults all the way, but it was done over a year ago.\nWhen copying a file from the Linux partition to the Windows partition it crashed. Of course this happened just after a lot of important work was done and before one of my (far to infrequent) backups was done. I do not have a \"rescue disk\" or backup of the partition table.\nI Booted a 12.04.4 live CD, the disk utility shows that the Linux partition has disappeared. Everything else is there including the Linux swap partition, but the Linux partition is not listed, and its spot in the extended partition is shown as free space.\nI am assuming only the partition table was damaged and the Linux partition is still there. The problem is determining exactly where the Linux partition starts, to recreate the partition table entry. My understanding is that it must be at least 63 blocks after the start of the extended partition, but can be more.\n1) What's the best way to determine where the Linux partition starts?\n2) Can I just copy the partition table with sfdisk, edit it and rewrite it, reboot, then mount the volume, or is there more that needs to be done?\n\nA: Two points:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Before you do anything else, and if the data has any value to you, make a clone of the hard-drive to a 2nd hard-drive (!)\n\n*Use testdisk on the copy to attempt to recover the partition table\n\n\nSee:  \n\n\n*\n\n*How do I recover my accidentally lost Windows partitions after installing Ubuntu?\n\nA: gparted has a recovery option in the device menu (I myself have not used it). You can also use testdisk which is a tried and true piece of software. As landroni said, you should first make a bitwise copy of you drive, if you have an external drive at your disposal.\nBack in the day when I still had a dual boot machine, I had a frightful experience like yours and then decided to use a dedicated NTFS partition to keep the files shared between the two systems (and so won't write from Linux partition to Windows one directly or vise versa.)\n", "Q: What does Version mean in the .desktop file? While submitting an application to the Ubuntu Touch store, I got the following error message.\n\"desktop_Version (Cliffhanger)\": {\n     \"text\": \"'0.3' does not match freedesktop.org version '1.0'\"\n}\n\nWhat does this mean and how do I fix it?\n\nA: In the .desktop file, there is a line which starts with \"Version=\". This field allows you to specify the version of the .desktop file specification by freedesktop.org. It is a common mistake to specify your application version here.\nThis field is optional and doesn't need to be included in your desktop. But if you do include it, make sure to set it to the currently supported .desktop file specification version. At the time of answering this question, it is 1.0.\n", "Q: Can I reinstall nvidia drivers if corrupted and root is locked? I am currently unable to load the desktop (ubuntu 13.10, AMD64) following installing 13.10, then trying to install the latest nvidia driver (x86-64-331.38) from tty (after having to stop lightdm). The installation failed (I do not remember the exact message); when I rebooted I was unable to start the desktop. Am I correct in thinking that the video driver is what is causing this?\nHere's where it gets worse: I locked the root, so I am unable to uninstall/reinstall via root shell in recovery mode. All other options on the recovery screen end up hanging after a few lines (a known bug?). I have tried adding init=/bin/sh to the linux line in the grub file; I have access to a shell here but get a warning (\"can't access tty; job control turned off\") and I cannot (or do not know how to) run files.\nMy question is: is there anything I can do to restore the video without having to wipe the computer and reinstall everything? Can I start up from cd? I'm not sure if this helps but I have an ubuntu...iso file that I appear to have access to. I am happy to provide any additional information.\nThanks for any help.\n\nA: Yes you can. While you started booting your Ubuntu, you may see GRUB menu & in that menu choose recovery mode. If you have not seen recover mode keep pressing SHIFT key until you see GRUB Menu \nAfter you getting into GRUB menu there is a option like \" root drop to root shell \" . From there you can do as a root user or you can reset root user password too. \nThere we have one more option like dpkg with which you can reconfigure your packages too. so I mean to say installing/removing/repairing your packages. \nhope that helps. \n", "Q: Getting \"You do not have permission to copy this file\" while importing files from Android I'm currently using Ubuntu 12.04 dual booted with Windows 7 and I've downloaded all the restricted extras. \nBut, still when I try to copy .mkv files from my android phone to my hard drive, I'm receiving below error message \n\nYou do not have permission to copy this file\n\nHow can I resolve this problem?\nIs it due to the use of MTP protocol?\n\nA: As I thought, a problem due to MTP.\nI tried these commands;\nsudo apt-get install golang fuse git-core libmtp-dev\nsudo adduser $USER fuse mkdir /tmp/go\nGOPATH=/tmp/go go get github.com/hanwen/go-mtpfs\nsudo mv /tmp/go/bin/go-mtpfs /usr/bin\nmkdir ~/MyAndrid\n\nThat installed \"go-mtpfs\".\nNow to mount your android,\ngo-mtpfs ~/MyAndroid &\n\nvolia!

(Are there commands I should read the doc's? otherwise, I'll write a python script)\n\nA: I had a script that I adjusted (good idea the (N+1)q part!) thanks to @chronitis comment and the SO answer: \n#! /bin/bash \n#\nN=10\nM=20\nP=2\nQ=3\nsed -n \"$N,${M}p; $((M+1))q\" $1 | cut -d, -f$P-$Q\n\nSave the file as for example cut_csv, make it executable and use as \ncut_csv file\n\nIt can be made fancier by accepting the N,M,P,Q parameters as input etc, but I use it seldomly so I normally simply edit the file. \nHow it works:\nThe main command is the following (let's suppose N=10, M=20, P=2, Q=3); the shell substitutes the variables and the last line will become: (1) \nsed -n \"10,20p ; 21q\" file | cut -d, -f2-3\n\nLet's start with the first command:\nsed -n \"10,20p ; 21q\" file \n\nThis call sed (stream editor, man sed) in no-print mode (-n) and execute the following commands on the file: \n\n\n*\n\n*print (p) the lines between 10 and 20 (this is the 10,20p part)\n\n*quit (q) when reading line 21 (21q) so that discard the rest of the file\n\n\nThe output of sed is piped (|) to cut: \ncut -d, -f2-3\n\nThis command (man cut) selects fields of a line (and repeat for each line). In this case, I am telling it that the separator between fields (columns) is a commad (-d,), and to print out the columns between 2 and 3.\nAs another more complex example I often use this one: \nsed -n \"1p; 10,14p; 21q\" data.csv | cut -d, -f1,4-8\n\nThis will select row 1 (where I have titles :-)) and rows from 10 to 14 (5 lines); then select columns 1 (time in my data...) and column from 4 to 8. It is really powerful once you get grips with it.\n(1) one great way to see what the shell is doing is change the first line (which is called a shebang) like that:\n#! /bin/bash -xv\n\nThe shell will now print every command it reads and the result of the substitutions: \n(0)asus-rmano: part_of_csv.sh p20dedo.csv\n#! /bin/bash -xv\n#\nN=10\n+ N=10\nM=20\n+ M=20\nP=2\n+ P=2\nQ=3\n+ Q=3\nsed -n \"$N,${M}p; $((M+1))q\" $1 | cut -d, -f$P-$Q\n+ cut -d, -f2-3\n+ sed -n '10,20p; 21q' p20dedo.csv\n16:05:49,000\n16:05:51,000\n[...]\n\n\nA: You can combine awk and sed with a pipe\nsed -n '10,50p' file.csv | awk -F ';' '{print $3 $4}'\n\n10 and 50 are rows.\n-F ';' is the field separator.(Semicolon in my example)\n$3 and $4 are the fields to show.\n\nA: The following script using head and tail is able to print a part of a .csv file filtered through row and column's number. \n#!/bin/bash\nm=\"$2\"\nn=\"$3\"\ns=\"$4\"\nt=\"$5\"\nhead -n \"$n\" \"$1\" | tail -n +\"$m\" | cut -d, -f \"$s\"-\"$t\"\n\nSave the above script as csv_view.sh and make it executable.\nchmod +x csv_view.sh\n\nwhere,\nm=row number where to begin\nn=row number where to end\nn=column number where to begin\nn=column number where to end\n\nHow to use\n./csv_view.sh mycsvfile.csv 11 32 4 7\n\nIt will give print row 11 to 32 and column 4 to 7 of mycsvfile.csv\n", "Q: File sync error (AUTH_FAILED) Recently I started getting a File sync error on all 3 of my PCs running Ubuntu One.

I want to install the Pygobject package on my Ubuntu 13.10. I tried the JHBuild option but I got stuck at the end of a very lengthy process. \nThe tutorial website of Pygobject says that it comes packaged with all its dependencies for nearly all Linux distros and it can be installed from the official repository of a distribution.\nI looked for it on the software center but couldn't find it. All it returned it was some spellchecking libraries and development headers for gobject python bindings(I am a beginner so please let me know if this is what I need to build pygtk applications in python 3.3.2) .\nI am guessing this needs to be installed using the command line interface but can't figure out how.\n\nA: Currently (>=python3.5) you should use pip. For example,\npython -m pip install --user pygobject\n\nI recommend the --user option to avoid permission problems and the awkward use of sudo (See this question).\nYou might get an installation error. In that case, it helps installing libgirepository1.0-dev either with the Package Manager or in command line with\nsudo apt-get install libgirepository1.0-dev\n\n\nA: Development libraries usually don't show up very well in the software center. Usually using apt-cache search will help here. So for example:\napt-cache search python gobject\n\nWill show you all the packages related to python and gobject introspection. Here is a snippet of the results:\npython-gi - Python 2.x bindings for gobject-introspection libraries\npython-gi-cairo - Python Cairo bindings for the GObject library\npython-gi-dbg - Python bindings for the GObject library (debug extension)\npython-gi-dev - development headers for GObject Python bindings\npython-gobject - Python 2.x bindings for GObject - transitional package\npython-gobject-2 - deprecated static Python bindings for the GObject library\npython-gobject-2-dbg - deprecated static Python bindings for the GObject library (debug extension)\npython-gobject-2-dev - development headers for the static GObject Python bindings\npython-gobject-dbg - Python 2.x debugging modules for GObject - transitional package\npython-gobject-dev - Python 2.x development headers for GObject - transitional package\npython-pyudev - Python bindings for libudev\npython3-gi - Python 3 bindings for gobject-introspection libraries\npython3-gi-cairo - Python 3 Cairo bindings for the GObject library\npython3-gi-dbg - Python 3 bindings for gobject-introspection libraries (debug extension)\npython3-pyudev - Python3 bindings for libudev\n\nSince you are looking for python 3 I would install python3-gi, that's probably the package you are looking for, so ...\nsudo apt-get install python3-gi\n\n", "Q: brightness can not be controlled in sony vaio laptop Brightness is not varying.

When I try to boot a virtual machine using:\nqemu-system-x86_64 -m 1024 -cdrom /host/iso/ubuntu-13.10-desktop-amd64.iso -name mac -hda ~/ubuntu\n\nIget a black screen just after the installation begins(before I choose the Language). I tried setting nomodeset in \"Other options\" but this did not resolve the issue.\nHowever, using the same ISO, I can boot the VM using Virtual Machine Manager. I need to boot the VM using qemu-system-x86_64 for one of my projects.\nPlease let me know how to solve this.\n\nA: By default qemu-system-x86_64 does emulation, not virtualization. Emulation is slow and CPU intensive - you can see that by running top, which will show your CPU at close to 100%. I just booted Xubuntu 14.04 using qemu-system-x86_64 on my system, and it took 10 minutes to boot to the desktop. Ubuntu normally hides boot information, which is why you are seeing a black screen (or some other graphical artifacts caused by BIOS changing resolution). If you remove splash quiet and add debug to the kernel parameters you will see what it is doing during this time. \nWhat you probably want to do is to run qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm to enable support for hardware virtualization. \nqemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -m 1024 -cdrom /host/iso/ubuntu-13.10-desktop-amd64.iso -name mac -hda ~/ubuntu\n\nFrom man qemu-system-x86_64:\n-enable-kvm\n       Enable KVM full virtualization support. This option is only available\n       if KVM support is enabled when compiling.\n\n(You might see people recommending the program kvm from the package qemu-kvm. kvm is just a wrapper script that does exec qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm \"$@\")\nKVM uses hardware virtualization rather than simulation, and hence is much faster. It requires a CPU that supports hardware virtualization extensions (VT-x for Intel, or AMD-V for AMD), which most modern PC systems have. \nWith virtualization, the CPU is actually executing the raw executable binary code from the guest OS. Virtualization is fast, but has the limitation that host OS and guest OS must be binary compatible. With emulation, the binary code of the guest OS is rewritten to run on the host CPU. It is slow, but has the advantage that you can run a guest OS compiled for a different CPU architecture (eg. A QEMU image for Debian armel explains how to run Debian ARM on a PC).\nAnother popular option for virtualization is VirtualBox.\n", "Q: Any way to change the default folder icon?

What would be the effect if I lower the swappiness value for my desktop PC? I was reading about swappiness in various forums and I saw some videos. Many stated that it's a good thing for desktop users to decrease the swappiness value below 60 (which is the default). Some stated that 60 is good for servers. Exactly why would it be better for me to lower it and why is 60 good for servers? I tried to search for an answer (I looked here for example) but couldn't understand. ...Please use easy terms :D\n\nA: The swappiness setting is a tweak to the way Linux calculates the benefits/drawbacks to swapping in a particular scenario.  A high swappiness will not cause the system to swap when it doesn't need to, and a low swappiness, providing you don't disable swapping completely, will not prevent your system from swapping when it absolutely has to.\nThe default swappiness of 60 or so is a very good compromise ensuring good performance of your system by ensuring it is not struggling too hard to allocate cache memory while there is unused allocated program memory.\nRemember that if you have plenty of RAM for all your processes plus cache, which should usually be the case if you have plenty of physical RAM, swapping should not be an issue for you anyway.  The preferred way to fix issues of too much swapping is to decrease RAM use by processes, and/or to increase physical RAM.  Reducing swappiness will have a negative effect if what you really need is more RAM.\nPlease see the answer I wrote to a very similar question:\nhttps://askubuntu.com/a/184221/54256\nExcerpt:\n\nWhy most people recommend to reduce swappiness to 10-20?\nBecause most believe that swapping = bad and that if you don't reduce swappiness, the system will swap when it really doesn't need to.  Neither of those are really true.  People associate swapping with times where their system is getting bogged down - however, it's mostly swapping because the system is getting bogged down, not the other way around.  It's true that there are certain times when swapping can have a noticeable performance penalty, but the system will have already factored that in to its decision to swap, and decided that not doing so would have a greater overall penalty in system performance or stability which may later become noticeable.  Overall the default settings should result in the best overall performance and reliability.  I'd recommend leaving it at the default.\n...\nOnce you have used up enough memory that there is not enough left for a smooth-running cache, Linux may re-allocate some unused application memory from RAM to swap.\nIt doesn't do this according to a definite cutoff though.  It's not like you reach a certain percentage of allocation then Linux starts swapping.  It has a rather \"fuzzy\" algorithm.  It takes a lot of things into account, which can best be described by \"how much pressure is there for memory allocation\".  If there is a lot of \"pressure\" to allocate new memory, then it will increase the chances some will be swapped to make more room.  If there is less \"pressure\" then it will decrease these chances.\nYour system has a \"swappiness\" setting which helps you tweak how this \"pressure\" is calculated.  It's normally not recommended to alter this at all, and I would certainly never recommend you alter it.  Swapping is overall a very good thing - any occasional performance penalties are intended to be offset by a gain in overall system responsiveness and stability for a wide range of tasks.  If you reduce the swappiness, you let the amount of cache memory shrink a little bit more than it would otherwise, even when it may really be useful.  You therefore risk slowing down your computer in general, because there is less cache, while memory is being taken up by applications that aren't even using it.  Whether this is a good enough trade-off for whatever specific problem you're having with swapping is up to you.  If you go further than this and actually disable swapping, you risk system instability in the event that the system runs out of memory for processes.\nWhat is happening when the system is bogged down and swapping heavily?\nA lot of the time people will look at their system that is thrashing the disk heavily and using a lot of swap space and blame swapping for it.  That's the wrong approach to take.  If swapping ever reaches this extreme, it means that your system is extremely low in memory and the swapping is the only thing keeping it from crashing or killing processes randomly.  Without swapping, in this situation, processes will crash and die.  The swapping is a symptom of a deeper problem.  In a system with enough memory for all its tasks, swapping only ensures that memory is utilised in efficient ways, dealing out memory to the cache over dormant processes where it sees it will be worth it.  In a system where swapping is relentlessly thrashing the disk, it's not swapping's fault.\nWhen choosing what is to be swapped to disk, the system tries to pick memory that is not actually being used - read to or written from.  It has a pretty simple algorithm for calculating this that chooses well most of the time.\n...\nBut how can swap speed up my system?  Doesn't swapping slow things down?\nThe act of transferring data from RAM to swap is a slow operation, but it's only taken when the kernel is pretty sure the overall benefit will outweigh this.  For example, if your application memory has risen to the point that you have almost no cache left and your I/O is very inefficient because of this, you can actually get a lot more speed out of your system by freeing up some memory, even after the initial expense of swapping data in order to free it up.\n\nFeel free to read the whole post at https://askubuntu.com/a/184221/54256\n\nA: Your premise is wrong. There is no 'good for servers' swapiness value. \nSwapiness is the amount of swapping that is done, especially how aggressively you swap. For my servers the swappiness is close to zero, as I make damn sure they have memory enough for everything. There is no 'best for servers' value. there is 60, which is the default, and then there is \"your value\" which depends on usage and available memory.\nIf you have servers that sometimes use LOADS of memory, you could have them higher than default, but I would say that some servers (database servers?) might want to keep them way lower than a home computer would.\n\nA: The swappiness value is scaled in a way that confuses people. They see it has a range of 0-100 so they think of percent, when really the effective minimum is around 50.\n60 roughly means don't swap until we reach about 80% memory usage, leaving 20% for cache and such. 50 means wait until we run out of memory. Lower values mean the same, but with increasing aggressiveness in trying to free memory by other means.\nThe describe it pretty well at http://lwn.net/Articles/83588/\n\nA: Swappiness is completely contradicting to all these answers. \nReal Working of swappiness is described in the article: \nhttps://gokulvasanblog.wordpress.com/2016/11/14/empathising-mammoths-mentality-a-study-on-linux-memory-management/\nThe ambiguity is corroborated by the statement from Andrew Morton:\nhttps://lwn.net/Articles/83593/\nI'm gonna stick my fingers in my ears and sing \"la la la\" until people tell\nme \"I set swappiness to zero and it didn't do what I wanted it to do\".\nHope its useful \n", "Q: Cannot locate software (gnuplot) in drive or synaptic but showing in terminal I installed gnuplot 4.4.3 using the command 'sudo apt-get install gnuplot'. It was working well. Later I tried to upgrade it to 4.6 version by 'sudo upgrade gnuplot' but it didnt work. I downloaded some files from internet and using one of them I saw that the version name was coming 4.6.4. But the plot was not coming. I installed x11 terminal but it didnt work.

I imagine that the system creates something somewhere, and this something blocks subsequent hibernations.\n\nA: Found a solution. Running:\nsync && sudo sysctl -w vm.drop_caches=3 && sudo sysctl -w vm.drop_caches=2\n\nwould clean the cache, and the system will be able to hibernate a second time after a re-boot. \nI don't now what or why something was accumulating in memory. It should be a stack system, where new entries drag out entries not needed anymore.\nWilf's tips are still valid for a system using the swap space when running. I am using it only for hibernating That means, I had 2 GB, but were only using 1 GB. Had I a need of 3 GB for example, I wouldn't be able to hibernate my 2GB RAM computer using a 2GB swap partition. \n\nA: I found a workaround for my machine, Asrock Z97 Fatal1ty, because HIBERNATE_MODE=\"platform\" didn't work but \"shutdown\" does. Testing in the terminal by typing the following as root \necho shutdown > /sys/power/disk\n\nand then \necho disk > /sys/power/state\n\nperformed hibernation and worked as many times as I tried.\nI tried several guides in attempt to change the default mode from \"platform\" to \"shutdown\" and none worked so I added the following line below to \n/etc/rc.local \necho shutdown > /sys/power/disk \n\nand then save the file.\nedit: I originally had typed \"echo shutdown > /sys/mode/disk\" and \"echo disk > /sys/mode/state\" in my original answer and realized my mistake. I also formatted the code the best i could. sorry for the unusual amounts of edits.\nyou can enable the hibernate menu option by creating the file: \n/var/lib/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/com.ubuntu.enable-hibernate.pkla\nand adding this to this empty file:\n[Re-enable hibernate by default in upower]\nIdentity=unix-user:*\nAction=org.freedesktop.upower.hibernate\nResultActive=yes\n\n[Re-enable hibernate by default in logind]\nIdentity=unix-user:*\nAction=org.freedesktop.login1.hibernate\nResultActive=yes\n\nand then logout and back in again and hibernate will be in the logout menu options and it worked every time. I know someone can improve this answer but I figured i'd share what worked for me anyways. Ideally one would find the correct file to edit the default mode for hibernation for pm-utils but like I said I tried and nothing worked, but this did. The only caveat I have encountered was that you now have to press the power button to resume from hibernate because the keyboard would not wake the computer like it did with \"platform\". Hope this helps someone. \n\nA: Since it very likely that you don't have enough swap for hibernation, you may want to increase your swap space size.\nThere is varying opinion on what the size of the swap should be, but here is one from the Fedora 64bit docs (can't find the Ubuntu one... there was one, I did find it ages ago...):\n  \nSo, it recommends 3 times the amount of RAM. This ends up as 5595Mib (5.5GiB), which should be plenty. I think this is to allow for the possible overflow of RAM plus the size of hibernation. On the actual process of increasing swap space, there are a few nice answers here.\nIf there is a Ubuntu version of the above info, I will gladly substitute in\n", "Q: flareget installation problem whenever I run, sudo apt-get update, I find\none is  :  \nErr http://ppa.launchpad.net saucy/main i386 Packages\n  404  Not Found\nin i386 packages of ppa                                \nand 2nd : W: Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/upubuntu-com/flareget-i386/ubuntu/dists/saucy/main/binary-i386/Packages  404  Not Found\n\nI think there is problem in installation of flareget software\nis there any command to fix this\n\nA: The PPA you added to install Flareget does not have any software for Ubuntu 13.10 (saucy).\nYou will have to the the Flareget software somewhere else.\nFirst, lets remove the PPA so that apt can work without errors.\nsudo apt-add-repository --remove ppa:upubuntu-com/flareget-i386\nsudo apt-get update\n\nNow, download the .deb installer for Flareget from here: http://flareget.com/download\nDouble click on the .deb file you download and Ubuntu Software Center will install it for you.\n", "Q: In gedit, what is the \"file browser panel\" plugin and what does it do?

(enjoying pc gaming).\nrecently I've been trying Linux, Ubuntu and Kubuntu. And I must say, I'm really impressed - I really like it.\nI'm having quite a few issues. My CPU usage is constantly extremely high. About 10-20% while not using my computer, and just showing desktop. While viewing a youtube video it's often 70-80%. I am also very often experiencing system errors.\nMy specs are the following:\nIntel i5 3570\nASUS GTX 670\n8 GB Kingston RAM\n500 GB HDD dualboot with Windows 7.\nIt's a fresh install of Ubuntu 13.10.\n\nA: Note : This may not be the answer you're looking for, but it can be usefull. \n\nFlash is gonna be hard on your CPU, but 80% of an i5 is ... well, a lot. I noticed before that the built-in Flash from Chrome was using more CPU than the external flash-plugin in Firefox. But 20% for looking at desktop, it seems too much.\nFor example, with my AMD AthlonII X4 3.0Ghz, i'm at 2-20% of each core, using full accelerated 1080p desktop, firefox running, terminal and mouse/keyboard activity. All of that, while looking at top and gnome-system-monitor, which are pretty heavy themselves. \n\nIs it bad if my CPU is loaded ?\nNot specially. I heard once that Linux, compared to other OS, was designed to use the best out of our hardware. That means it's heavier if you have a better hardware. \nAs storm09f87a said : \"Unused CPU cycles are wasted CPU cycles\". It is fundamentally true. Keep this in mind\n\nWhat to do when my CPU activity seems too high ? \n\n\n*\n\n*You can look at your CPU activity with the command top, it's a CLI program (command-line interface). \n\n*You can also look at it (total and details) with gnome-system-monitor, with a GUI (graphical user interface)\nI, for instance, use the two combined : \n\n\nYou can see on this screenshot that Xorg takes a lot. But actually,\n  it is because of the mouse activity, not the display itself. You'll\n  also see that the gnome-system-monitor is heavy: but you can ignore\n  this, because this program isn't always running.\n\nThe point of this, it's to see which process takes your CPU cycles. Sometimes, you can notice a bug, a leak, that is caused by a process that should not use so much power. \nYou can try then to kill it with the command killall nameoftheprocess. If it was necessary for the OS to run, then either it will restart itself, or you'll have to reboot. \nYou can also seek what program/service is related to this process and reinstall, optimise, or restart it. You can fill a bug report if needed. \n\nYou can, if you wish, use a tool designed to make Linux more eco-friendly on a desktop PC, and save energy on a laptop. \nI never tried it on a desktop PC, but from what I've heard, it helps to reduce the temperature of your system and better regulate the hardware. That tool is TLP by Linrunner. \n\" TLP brings you the benefits of advanced power management for Linux without the need to understand every technical detail. TLP comes with a default configuration already optimized for battery life, so you may just install and forget it. Nevertheless TLP is highly customizable to fulfil your specific requirements.\"\nYou can install it with these command-lines : \nsudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:linrunner/tlp\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install tlp tlp-rdw\n\nIt will be used on next reboot. You can also manually start it with sudo tlp start. You'll find the documentation on Linrunner's website. \n\nI am experiencing system errors...\nMe too, don't worry. Ubuntu has the filthy habit to report every little error, even when it shouldn't (in my opinion) be noticed to the user. \nDepending on the errors : if they are regular, where do they come from, if they keep the system to properly work, ... you can desactivate the \"error\" message. I always do that, because it's a real pain in the keyboard. \nTo desactivate the notifications on every error, use this command-line : \nsudo sed -i 's/enabled=1/enabled=0/g' /etc/default/apport\n\n(or pass enabled=1 to enable=0 in /etc/default/apport file). \n\nA: If you're getting errors every time you boot, you may just need to clean your crash directory.\nsudo rm /var/crash/*\n\nAfter a reboot, you should stop getting those annoying error messages.

You get one value, for one second. Then, you do that for all other seconds, and get the average number, by adding all those numbers(for each second) and devide that number by the number of seconds. So, the sum of circled values is one value, which is used to calculate the average.\n\n", "Q: Kernel 3.13 on Ubuntu ARM + Android kernel options compatibility I've installed ubuntu 12.04 LTS with the kernel 3.13 on my ARM Samsung / Google Chromebook,using this tutorial :\nhttp://www.virtualopensystems.com/en/solutions/guides/kvm-on-chromebook/\nI have to say that ubuntu works really good.

It's grub, that's the problem. I keep my Ubuntu on a separate partition in an external hard drive around the size of 1TB. Grub is also located in this drive. But my problem is that grub attempts to start up on the computer even though it isn't there which means I have to plug in my hard drive every time I restart.\nIs there any way I can work around this configuration? Or will it go away if I reinstall Ubuntu on the partition but in a different way?\n\nA: You have installed Grub to the internal hard disk rather than the removable one.  You need to reinstall grub to the removable drive, which you can do by running sudo dpkg-reconfigure grub-pc and selecting the correct drive at the menu, and then restore whatever boot loader was originally on the internal drive.  Assuming that is Windows, you can use the Windows recovery console command FIXMBR to do that.\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu without sharing a Windows partition or replacing Windows I am quite new to Linux and the concept of using dual operating systems. I am aware that the Ubuntu installer gives the options of sharing the Windows partition or replacing Windows. I would like to do neither of these.\nI have a notebook with and SSD and two HDDs. The SSD (c:) houses Windows OS and the first HDD (e:) is used for Windows file storage. I would like to retain both of these drives as is and install Ubuntu on the second HDD (potentially f:), which is currently blank and unformatted (brand new).\nI would also like to have the OS choice option on boot up that would be given if Ubuntu were installed sharing the Windows partition. Is this possible?\nIf this is doable, how do I go about doing it?\n\nA: In your case the most simple and safe option would be to install Ubuntu and set it to use that second HDD to install it's boot manager (Grub).\nWhen you boot your computer, to boot in Ubuntu, press the key for boot sequence of your Bios or UEFI and select the drive with Ubuntu.\nA trick would be to make the notebook to start from that drive as normal, Ubuntu installer would add Windows to it's menu and you'll be able to choose. I've used this setup for some time.\nIn case that you have Windows installed with UEFI (if your notebook supports) then it will even more simpler, the installer in most recent versions will take care for you without many questions, as for UEFI systems only one common partiotion is used (it's a special UEFI partition, a custom fat32 with some things in a special way organized).\n\nA: I'm assuming then that you have the wubi.exe installer because of how this is phrased.\nUsing the wubi.exe installer Ubuntu will be installed as an application on windows.  It will appear like a dual booting system (even has an Ubuntu option in your bootloader) but it won't be on its own partition or anything, it will simply be stored in the Windows directory you installed it to.  What you want is an actual installation on its own drive.\nIn order install Ubuntu on its own drive you will need an ubuntu iso file.  Those are from the Ubuntu downloads page, pick version 12.04 or 13.10, doesn't matter which.  You will need pendrive Linux or similar program to create a bootable usb key or CD out of the iso file.  Make sure to follow the steps very carefully when selecting the drive because pen drive Linux can break your system.  Once you have the bootable USB or CD, start your pc with it plugged in and boot off the USB.\nHow to boot from the USB depends on your system; some will do so automatically, some will require you manually enter the boot menu and select it.  Once in, you will pick your language and some other settings.  Eventually you will get to a menu where you can pick your installation type.  You will probably want to pick the \"Something Else\" option, this will allow you to select the empty external drive as the install location.  This guide should help you out if pictures make things clearer.\nAfter Ubuntu is installed, you may need to change some BIOS entries.  Specifically, if Ubuntu is not a bootable option after installing it you will need to make sure your settings allow booting from external HDDs.\nNOTE:  I did some searching around and found this question that sounds very similar to yours.  The answer by izx is very detailed and explains how to install Windows XP and Ubuntu onto two separate drives and still get both to appear in the boot menu.

Just upgraded from 12.04 to 12.10, on my ancient 32-bit Dell Latitude C-400 laptop.\nAfter the install, I restarted my machine as directed by the OS and got a blank screen. The computer appeared to be running fine, just no display.\nBooting in GRUB gave me the option of two versions (as well as recovery modes for both):\n\n\n*\n\n*Linux 3.5.0-45-generic\n\n*Linux 3.2.0-34-generic-pae\n\n\nApparently 3.5 is the 64-bit version, and 3.2 is the 32-bit version. When I choose 3.2.0, the system completes the boot sequence as it should, complete with functioning video display.\nHow do I force Kubuntu to boot in Linux 3.2.0? If it's as simple as changing the order of the versions listed in GRUB, how do I do that?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: I don't know about Linux 3.5.0-45-generic being 64-bit. That would not possible if your Laptop only supports 32-bit. Putting that aside, your question is about how to set default boot entry. Take a lookt at Grub Customizer. There is one good tutorial here: How do I change the GRUB boot order?. The accepted answer there can be a bit confusing. You can just follow the second answer, which I paste here:\nYou can also change the grub default boot entry from the command line without having to install any additional tool.  This won't change the order in the list but it will allow a different OS to boot by default, which sounds like what you may want anyway.\nFirst, make a backup copy of /etc/default/grub. In case something goes wrong, you can easily revert to the known-good copy.\nsudo cp /etc/default/grub /etc/default/grub.bak\n\nThen edit the file using vim or the text editor of your choice.\nsudo vim /etc/default/grub\n\nFind the line that contains GRUB_DEFAULT=0 and set it to GRUB_DEFAULT=x where x is the index of grub menu item to which you would like to boot to by default. Note that the menu items are zero-indexed. That means that the first item in the list is 0 and that the sixth item is actually 5.  So to boot to the sixth item in the list, the line would read GRUB_DEFAULT=5.\nAdditionally, if you want to use a kernel in the \"Previous Linux Versions\" menu, you'll want to change GRUB_DEFAULT=0 to GRUB_DEFAULT=\"2>x\" (make sure to include the quotations), where x is the placement of the old kernel on the sub-list (assuming the \"Previous Linux Versions\" is third on the main list). Remember that the list always begins counting at 0.\nThen build the updated grub menu.\nsudo update-grub\n\n", "Q: Cloning a hard disk or creating a backup I am changing my hard disk because in Ubuntu it shows \"Disk Failure is Imminent\". Which option is better:\n\n\n*\n\n*Should I clone my hard disk with new one or\n\n*Should I create a backup using Ubuntu Backup and then restore it to new hard disk?\n\n\nHow much time each will take for 500 GB hard disk?\n\nA: I don't know which one is better, but I would go for a bitwise clone of the hard-drive using either dd, ddrescue or clonezilla. These utilities ignore the file-system and just copy the sectors. Clonezilla in particular is space efficient: by default it copies only used sectors and compresses the backup image (see Save 1st disk (sda) as an image on 2nd disk (sdb) tutorial). \nThe other solution would be to use a file-system-level utility like rsync or grsync. This could work reasonably well, too, especially if the drive hasn't yet developed bad or corrupted sectors. (If it has, however, see ddrescue.)\nWhatever you do, though, stop using the dying drive now. Well, that is, if you put any value on your data.\nSee also: \n\n\n*\n\n*How to clone to a smaller harddisk?\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 Server - Default directory permissions I am new to linux and I installed linux for web server purpose with apache2.\nI have created a new directory /var/www/mysite.\nMy main problem is that each new file I create has read only permissions 644 permissions using root user.\nI would like each new file created to have 775 permission.

I'm using a Samsung RV509 laptop  with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.\nCan anyone help me to decrease the brightness in my laptop?\n\nA: On laptops, you will often be able to adjust brightness, by pressing the FN button, and a specific F1 - F12 at the same time. Take a look at your F1 - F12 buttons. There should be small icons with a blue color on. If some of them look like they could be related to brightness, try it with the FN button. Sometimes it is also arrow keys and other buttons you will need to use.\nIf your keyboard looks like this, you can adjust your brightness by using the FN key and the UP and Down arrow keys. Your volume can be adjusted with FN+Arrow key Left or right, and so forth.\nGood luck.\n\nA: Try using xbacklight.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install it by running sudo apt-get install xbacklight in a terminal.\n\n*Change brightness by xbacklight -set <level>, where <level> is an integer ranging from 0 to 100 (lowest brightness to highest).\n\n\nFor example, to set medium brightness one would use\n\nxbacklight -set 50\n\n\nA: first know the output name\nxrandr -q\n\nfor example my output name is DVI-I-2\nThe brightness can be changed like this:\nxrandr --output DVI-I-2 --brightness 1\n\n\nA: If the options that are built into your keyboard give you trouble, which is often the case, you can use xbacklight. If not already installed, you can install it via the terminal with:\n sudo apt-get install xbacklight\n\nyou can then change the backlight:\nxbacklight -set [percent]\n\nwhere the [percent] is a value between 0 and 100, i.e.:\nxbacklight -set 50\n\nwould set the backlight to 50% of the max value.\nif you want keyboard shortcuts for increasing and decreasing the backlight, you could assign\nxbacklight -inc 10\n\nand\nxbacklight -dec 10\n\nto whichever keybindings you'd like, using the \"keyboard\" menu and the \"shortcuts\" tab.

If you want to act more like a regular computer connected to your network, you want bridged like this.  \nThe most common configuration for direct host to guest connectivity and internet connectivity is one host-only and one NAT interface.  \nMy preferred configuration is bridged and host only, so I can access the machine directly and other machines on the network can access it if need be.\n", "Q: thinkpad t440p annoying static noise when I plug the speakers realtek ALC292 HDA Intel PCH 13.10 some laptop thinkpad t440p , with windows 8 is fine no noise. \nwith ubuntu 12.04 and 13.10 , if I plug the speakers without music but with the volume up(even low) there is annoying noise come out.\nto interrupt the noise I need to put in mute mode. \naplay -l\n*** List of PLAYBACK Hardware Devices ****\ncard 0: MID [HDA Intel MID], device 3: HDMI 0 [HDMI 0]\n Subdevices: 1/1\n Subdevice #0: subdevice #0\n card 0: MID [HDA Intel MID], device 7: HDMI 1 [HDMI 1]\n  Subdevices: 1/1\nSubdevice #0: subdevice #0\n0: MID [HDA Intel MID], device 8: HDMI 2 [HDMI 2]\n  Subdevices: 1/1\nSubdevice #0: subdevice #0\nCard 1: PCH [HDA Intel PCH], device 0: ALC292 Analog [ALC292 Analog]\nSubdevices: 0/1\nSubdevice #0: subdevice #0\n\n\ndpkg -l | grep alsa\n ii  alsa-base                                 1.0.25+dfsg-0ubuntu4                          all          ALSA driver configuration files\n ii  alsa-utils                                1.0.27.1-1ubuntu1                             amd64        Utilities for configuring and using ALSA\n ii  bluez-alsa:amd64                          4.101-0ubuntu8b1                              amd64        Bluetooth ALSA support\n ii  gstreamer0.10-alsa:amd64                  0.10.36-1.1ubuntu1                            amd64        GStreamer plugin for ALSA\n ii  gstreamer1.0-alsa:amd64                   1.2.0-1ubuntu1                                amd64        GStreamer plugin for ALSA\n\n\ndpkg -l | grep pulseaudio\nii  gstreamer0.10-pulseaudio:amd64            0.10.31-3+nmu1ubuntu3                         amd64        GStreamer plugin for PulseAudio\nii  gstreamer1.0-pulseaudio:amd64             1.2.0-1ubuntu1                                amd64        GStreamer plugin for PulseAudio\nii  pulseaudio                                1:4.0-0ubuntu6                                amd64        PulseAudio sound server\nii  pulseaudio-module-bluetooth               1:4.0-0ubuntu6                                amd64        Bluetooth module for PulseAudio sound server\nii  pulseaudio-module-x11                     1:4.0-0ubuntu6                                amd64        X11 module for PulseAudio sound server\nii  pulseaudio-utils                          1:4.0-0ubuntu6                                amd64        Command line tools for the PulseAudio sound server\n\n uname -a\n3.11.0-15-generic #25-Ubuntu SMP Thu Jan 30 17:22:01 UTC 2014 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\n\nalsamixer\n Card: HDA Intel PCH                                                                                                                            F1:  Help               │\n Chip: Realtek ALC292    \n\n\nA: Partial Fixed follow this:\nhttp://xps13-9333.appspot.com/#background_noise\nwith\n\n    mkdir -p /usr/local/bin\n    wget -O /usr/local/bin/white_noise_fix.py http://xps13-9333.appspot.com/root/usr/local/bin/white_noise_fix.py\n    chmod 744 /usr/local/bin/white_noise_fix.py\n\nchanged the script on /etc/init.d/xps this line:\nkernel_version=$(uname -r | cut -c3-4)\nto \nkernel_version=$(uname -r | cut -c3)\n", "Q: What permissions would change if I change umask to 027 from 022? I have just started using Lynis (please don't think I have misspelled Linux). After running it, I was suggested to set umask in /etc/login.defs and /etc/init.d/rc to 027 than the default 022.\nI want to know what changes that would make to file permissions. Also why is the value stored in two files? Do they work differently?\nFor more info if necessary, I use Ubuntu 12.10, and I am the only user of the system.\n\nA: The 027 umask setting means that the owning group would be allowed to read the newly-created files as well. This moves the permission granting model a little further from dealing with permission bits and bases it on group ownership.\nThis will create directories with permission 750.\nPlease check this great article 027 umask — a compromise between security and simplicity.\n\nA: The mode mask\nTo quote ArchWiki:\n\nThe umask utility is used to control the file-creation mode mask, which determines the initial value of file permission bits for newly created files.\n\nthe mode bits\nThe three octal numbers correspond to permissions for user, group, and other. By changing the third number from 2 to 7, the other permission is changed.\nTo understand these numbers, write them in binary form, and each bit corresponds to one of read, write, and execute. In short, 2 corresponds to write; 7 corresponds to read, write and execute. Directories are kind of different, read means to get the  list of items(files and directories) within a directory, while execute means to access those items provided their names are known.\nhow it's masking\nTo be exact, mode masks decide which permissions are masked, or removed from newly-created files by default. So a mask value of 2 means to make files not writable; 7 means to remove all permissions. Note that even if some permissions are not removed by mode mask, they may be unavailable because of other restrictions. For instance, Linux does not allow files to be created with execution permissions, so they will never be executable by default.\nA reasonable value\nSo to answer the first question: 022 means write permission is masked for other, so by default files can be read but not written to or modified by others. Though the execute permission is not masked, others won't be able to execute files because of the restrictions mentioned above; however, they may be able to access items with directories. Change it to 027, and read and execute are also masked. So newly-created files and directories are kept private from others; items within newly-created directories will always be inaccessible to others.\nIn many cases, there is only one human user. However, there are usually several system users used to run services, such as nobody. In some rare cases, for example when a program running as nobody gets compromised, restrictive permissions may prevent it from reading sensitive data.\nHowever, in a multi-user environment, sharing a file becomes more involved: in addition to setting the permissions on the file, at least the execute permission needs to be set on all parent directories. \nSetting the value\nAs for the second question, the mode mask need to be set only once. If it's set multiple times, the last one matters. Most distributions set the default mode mask in /etc/profile, so I'd suggest editing this file.\n", "Q: /ect/hosts file error I am having some issues while running apt-get from my command line.

But that should not be a problem in the VM\nCan you please guide me where the problem is and how to fix it. Thanks and appreciated in advance.\n\nA: You're looking at this problem from the wrong end. Don't edit your hosts file if you don't know why you're doing it. Restore your host file to how it looked from the start. Try pinging both google.com and the address you have issues with - do they work? Run cat /etc/resolv.conf, you should see nameservers. If you don't (or if you do), try putting only the following in there with a text editor like nano (these DNS servers are hosted by Google):\nnameserver 8.8.8.8\nnameserver 8.8.4.4\n\nNow try pinging both google and the address you have issues with again. Are they resolving to different IP numbers now? In that case, your default DNS (maybe the one your ISP provides) may be outdated or not working correctly.\nThe main problem here is why your DNS is not working, don't work past that by setting IP numbers to hostnames manually because it does not solve your fundamental issue.\nAlso, as another answer said, you are not even setting extras.ubuntu.com to the correct IP address, so please stop whatever you're doing if you don't know why you're doing it. Start using a DNS server that works and your problems should hopefully go away.\n", "Q: How to activate the sign @ I have just installed Ubuntu on my laptop, but I can not type @ !

Just for fun, or say for sake of convenience, I decided to write out all man pages to files.  \nNow if I have to do it one by one, I would do man package-name > filename.  But I want to do some smart work and write all mans at once, either by using single command or by a bash script.All that I have come up with till now is\ncd /usr/share #you may use any folder\nwhereis -m * | grep '.gz' |awk '{print$1}' |sed s/://g\n\nThis gives an output, naming all applications having man pages.Some part of it is as below.  \nspeech-dispatcher\nstellarium\nsynaptic\nsyslinux\nsystem-config-printer\ntabset\nterminfo\ntotem\nufw\nunetbootin\nunity\nunity-greeter\nupdate-manager\nupstart\nusb_modeswitch\nvim\nvirtualbox\nvlc\nxmms2\nxpdf\nyelp\nzenity\n\nNow, what I need to do is redirect this output to man so that I could redirect it to files.Once I do this, then I may create a script to cd to every folder and check for mans.\nSo my question is, how do I achieve this?\nOR, maybe an alternate way exists?\nI'm using Ubuntu 12.10.\n\nPlease migrate it to stackoverflow if it's appropriate there.Though I think it's more appropriate here.\n\n\nA: There are many executables in /bin. If you want to copy their corresponding man pages into files, you use something like this in your terminal\nfor f in /bin/*;do man $(basename $f) > $HOME/man_$(basename $f); done\n\nAfter execution of the command you will find all the man pages corresponds to the executables in /bin/ in your home. For example man page corresponds to ls will take name man_ls.txt inyour home.\nIf you want copy only a part, say the executables name begins with r, use,\nfor f in /bin/r*;do man $(basename $f) > $HOME/man_$(basename $f); done\n\nYou may get several note like,\nNo manual entry for <some_executable>\nSee 'man 7 undocumented' for help when manual pages are not available.\n\nfor the executables which does not have a man entry.\nDo this for other folders which contains executables like, /usr/bin/ ,/usr/sbin/ ,/sbin/ etc.\nNote:\nyou can use 2>/dev/null with your command to suppress the error messages for executables without man entry. like,\nfor f in /usr/bin/r*;do man $(basename $f) > $HOME/man_$(basename $f) 2>/dev/null; done\n\n\nAccording to your approach\nNavigate to a folder and use this for the same result,\nfor f in $(whereis -m * | grep '.gz' |awk '{print$1}' |sed s/://g); do man $f > $HOME/man_$f.txt; done\n\n\nA: First off, why would you want a file containing all the man pages? If it is to facilitate searching through all of them for some keyword, GNU already provides apropos for just that:\napropos some-regular-expression\n\nreturns a list of all man pages matching the regular expression in their name or description.\nAnyway, if you still want the encyclopedic file, then making use of apropos, you can obtain a list of all man pages on the system by searching for the universal regular expression:\napropos '.*'\n\nthen feed the resulting list into the man command:\napropos '.*' | awk '{print $1;}' | xargs man > all-manpages.txt\n\nYou could also use the method described in the answer to the similar question \"Generate a list of all available commands and what each does\", replacing whatis by man.\n", "Q: Is it possible to show KDE panels only for a multimonitor layout?

I have been wondering about this for a while and a plain answer have been impossible to find. It is mainly about how the kernel is developed and maintained. I'm using Xubuntu 12.04 with kernel 3.2, and I'm aware of later LTS kernel versions.\nI have a fairly new motherboard (ASUS M5A99FX Pro R2.0). Of course it was bundled with a set of Windows drivers, but the solution for Linux was far easier. It just said: Use the latest kernel.\nThe latest kernel when I bought it was 3.8, I think. (I don't know for sure the release date.) Obviously easy to solve then, or not! I could of course download and compile the vanilla kernel, or use the latest Ubuntu LTS kernel (3.11.x today), but is that necessary? Doesn't the latest 3.2 kernel contain newer drivers as well as ordinary bug fixes? (Noticeably, the Xubuntu team released 12.04.4 with the old 3.2 kernel instead for the updated 3.11.)\nMy uncertainty grew larger when I read about the Linux-firmware package. Maybe it is that instead of the kernel itself that is important?\nI would be grateful if someone explains this quite plainly to me.\n\nA: The Kernel is developed and maintained by linux foundation at www.kernel.org.\nAny kernel version will contain all bug fixes as long a it is supported(an all distros will upgrade to newer versions of kernel long before it's end of support)\nBut if certain hardware is not supported by x.y.z version, you will have to update to newer version.\nIf the current kernel version supports all your hardware, there is no need to install newer version  of kernel.You may unnecessarily break something that works!\nStill, if you wish to install newer kernel, just update all your apps withsudo apt-get update.\n", "Q: How to add legal banner in /etc/issue and /etc/issue.net in Ubuntu?

It can be used for security, legal info, company policy, etc.\nOne way to display messages is using issue.net file.  issue.net : Display a banner message before the password login prompt.\nTo display Welcome or Warning message for SSH users before login. Use issue.net file to display a banner massages. Open the following file with the editor.\nvi /etc/issue.net\n\nAdd the banner message of your choice, and save the file.

This is how.     \n1) First, we create a script (for ease of use, and so that we can toggle it on/off using the same hotkey) -\n    #!/bin/bash\n    # Script to toggle the wireless blocked/unblocked\n\n    # index no. of phy interface\n    IFACE=`rfkill list all | grep phy | cut -c 1`\n\n    # WiFi block state 0=active, 1=blocked\n    BLOCKED=`rfkill list all | grep -iA1 phy | grep -ic soft.*yes`\n\n    if [ $BLOCKED -eq 1 ]; then\n        rfkill unblock $IFACE\n\n    else\n        rfkill block $IFACE\n    fi\n\nCopy-paste the contents of the above box in a text file and save this file in your Home directory with the name wifitoggle.sh. Make sure the file starts with (without double quotes) \"#!/bin/bash\" and ends with the \"fi\" being its last line.\n2) Make the script executable:\n    chmod +x wifitoggle.sh\n\n3) Create a symlink to this script in /bin directory:\n    sudo ln -s $HOME/wifitoggle.sh /bin\n\nB. Bind the Script with a HotKey of your choice :\n1) Install xbindkeys-config (a GUI frontend to xbindkeys - the program that captures and binds hotkeys with commands) \n    sudo apt-get install xbindkeys-config\n\n2) Create a default config file for it (else it would crash on key capture step)\n    xbindkeys --defaults > ~/.xbindkeysrc\n\n3) Run the program from the terminal (because it does not create a launcher in Unity dash) \n    xbindkeys-config\n\nLeave the terminal running in the background. In the GUI box that opens, 3 example shortcuts are already present. You may leave them.\n4) Click on \"New\" button at the bottom of the GUI.\n5) In the right hand pane of the GUI, fill in a suitable name in the \"Name\" field, e.g. \"Toggle Wifi\"\n6) Click on \"Get Key\" button. This will open a tiny blank box doing nothing but waiting for your input.\n7) Press the desired key (or key combination) that you want for toggling Wifi on/off. For example, \"F3\" key (as it remains mostly unused). The tiny box will disappear and the key will be recorded.\n8) In the \"Action\" field, type this -\n    /bin/bash /bin/wifitoggle.sh\n\n9) Click on \"Apply\" button and test the hotkey to see if it works as expected.\n10) Click on \"Save & Apply & Exit\" to save the new hotkey to the default file and exit.\nFrom now on, as soon as you will press this key or the key-combination, the wifi will change its state from On to Off, or Off to On.\nThe Fn key doesn't seem to be noticed by any key capture program I could find (probably that's why it is considered \"Hardware Switch\"), so it's not possible to use it yet.\nI'd request that you submit a bug report against the problem, and point to this thread as a possible workaround.

So the first step in the process would be to disable apport.  This can be done by editing the /etc/default/apport file, and setting enabled=0.\nAt this point, the kernel default core pattern should remain on boot.  If you want to switch to some other pattern you can do this by placing a file in /etc/sysctl.d that ends in .conf (e.g. 60-core-pattern.conf).

I did succeed to mount it under Lubuntu 13.10 by means of the following command:\nsudo mount -o soft,intr,rsize=8192,wsize=8192 \n<IP address>:/nfs /home/myusername/nfs/\n\nAfterwards I do see the various shares in the directory nfs.\nUnfortunately however I do not get access to the files. This is because the Western Digital device needs a username and password.\nI am a Linux rookie so would there be someone willing to tell me how to specify these in the mount command?\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: AFP is Apple File Protocol which, along with Samba, is natively supported by the WD NAS server. You can also use smbfs or cifs on your Linux box and mount the shares permanently (see here) or you can use NFS. NFS, particularly udp, offers better performance but poorer security. I use NFS because file ownership and permissions are an important issue to me and they are not fully supported in smbfs/cifs.\nI have just posted a how-to to set up NFS between a Linux client running 14.04 and a WD Own Cloud NAS server - see here.\n\nA: It's very simple in Linux, you just need to specify the username and password in your options, I modified your statement to be as follows:\nsudo mount -t cifs -o soft,intr,rsize=8192,wsize=8192,username=UUUUUUU \n<IP address>:/nfs /home/myusername/nfs/\n\nWhereas UUUUUUU is your username.\nNotice that I also added \"-t cifs\" whereas cifs is the standard type to connect to these drives. \nThis will prompt you to enter a password for user UUUUUUU, if however, you like to pass the password parameter as well, then just add it into the options in the same way, below is the full statement: \nsudo mount -t cifs -o soft,intr,rsize=8192,wsize=8192,username=UUUUUUU,password=PPPPPPPP \n<IP address>:/nfs /home/myusername/nfs/\n\nI hope this helps. \n", "Q: Where is the folder for kmenuedit located in Kubuntu? I am using Kubuntu 13.10. I often type \"kmenuedit\" into search in the Start menu to launch the kmenuedit program, but I'm confused as to where the kmenuedit folder is.

I am looking for a way to separate them as system users and service user list.\nIs there any way ?\n\nA: Based on gid, system users and service users can be separated as follows,\n/etc/passwd contains list for all users along with some other information. Service users or real users have gid greater than or equals to 1000. So a list of real users can be obtained as,\nawk -F: '($3>=1000)&&($1!=\"nobody\"){print $1}' /etc/passwd\n\nAlso a list of system users (gid < 1000) can be extracted as,\nawk -F: '($3<1000){print $1}' /etc/passwd\n\nHow it works\nThe contents of /etc/passwd are like,\n    root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash\n    ...\n    souravc:x:1001:1001:Souravc:/home/souravc:/bin/bash\n\nWhen using awk with -F: it splits the contents of a line into several fields treating : as field separator. First field contains the user name and third field has the gid.\nHence to extract real users awk just check value of third field is greater than equals to 1000 and it is not nobody user and prints the first field i.e., the user name.\nTo list all system users it just checks gid is less than 1000 and prints the user name. \nEdit\nAs you want to list root(gid = 0) in real user list. Get real users as,\nawk -F: '($3==0)||($3>=1000)&&($1!=\"nobody\"){print $1}' /etc/passwd\n\nGet system users as,\nawk -F: '($3<1000)&&($1!=\"root\"){print $1}' /etc/passwd\n\nNote I am always ignoring nobody user.\n\nA: To list local (system users) than can login and have homedir and GID less than 1000\n cat /etc/passwd | cut -d: -f 1,3,6 | grep \"[1-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]\" | grep \"/home\" | cut -d: -f1\n\nTo list all other users:(mainly system users and have GID less than 1000):\ncat /etc/passwd | cut -d: -f 1,3,6 | grep -v \"[1-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]\"  | cut -d: -f1\n\n\nA: Actual users (other than root) on a nix system should have a home directory identified.

I am using a dual boot setup (Windows 7 and Ubuntu 12.04 LTS).\nThe first two partitions belong to Windows and the third and fourth are the ubuntu system and swap partions respectively. All of these are primary and there is remaining unallocated space.\nMy plan was to allocate the remaining space as a shared partition for both operating systems, but since I defined all of the current partitions as primary, this is not possible (max. 4 primary).\nIs is possible to create a new primary partition from the ubuntu swap partition and the unallocated space, and place the new swap partition inside - or will this break my system?\nI know that logical swap partitions are possible, but not if such a change is possible retrospectively.\n\nA: As Avinash Raj says, a GPT disk doesn't have the 4-primary-partition limit, so you may be worrying over nothing.\nBeyond that, on an MBR disk you can convert a primary partition to a logical partition (with surrounding extended partition) with my FixParts utility, which is part of the Ubuntu gdisk package. There are caveats and limitations, though; see the FixParts page for details.\nAlternatively, if your swap partition is the one adjacent to the free space, you can delete it, create a new extended partition, and create a new logical swap partition within the extended partition. Because swap partitions hold inherently transient data, this type of operation doesn't require backing up the data, although you will have to reconfigure the swap entry in /etc/fstab. You'll also need to disable swap before doing this, and maybe perform the operations from a live CD rather than from your regular installation.\n", "Q: Restarting network over ssh causes hang I'm running this:\nssh root@192.168.88.88 '/etc/init.d/networking restart'\n\nIt works and outputs the results, but never returns. Yet other commands do. Maybe because the network goes down (as intended). How can I terminate it? I tried adding an exit command, but no dice.\nUPDATE: I noticed this does work sometimes. The problem seems to happen if the process is interrupted and the remote interface configuration is in an unknown state. I still can't track down exactly what causes the hanging.\n\nA: Maybe the restart command is getting interrupted when the connecton is lost (at first glance asking a system to restart its network connection over the network seems dangerous). What you'd want is for networking restart to run independently of the controlling terminal. I'd add a crontab entry like so (put it in /etc/cron.d/checker-thingy perhaps):\n* * * * * root /path/to/checker-thingy.sh\n\nthen checker-thingy.sh would be something like:\n[ -f /tmp/restart-network ] && service networking restart\n[ -f /tmp/restart-network ] && rm /tmp/restart-network\n\nThis is kinda awful and prone to other problems, but basically as you see it will restart the network if it finds a specific flag file in /tmp (and then remove the file to avoid a network resetting loop).\nThen in your automated script you can do:\nssh server-ip 'touch /tmp/restart-network'\n\nand after a minute or so you should see the network interface cycle as requested.\n\nA: I stumbled upon this very interesting page: http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/063. The ssh command is hanging around waiting for the output streams of the remote process to close, so it will be catched by the network shutting down.\nSo (tested):\nssh user@host \"sleep 60 &\" \n\nwill return after 60 seconds, while \nssh user@host  \"sleep 60 >/dev/null 2>&1 &\" \n\nwill return immediately after launching the sleep command in background. \nIf this is correct, the solution would be to detach immediately the standard output and error from the remote shell --- like this (not tested, please check): \nssh user@host '/etc/init.d/networking restart >/dev/null 2>&1 &' \n\nor if this still triggers a race between the network going down and the shell closing, \nssh user@host '(sleep 10 && /etc/init.d/networking restart ) >/dev/null 2>&1 &'\n\nshould work. \n\nA: Remove the shh package by typing \n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get remove ssh\n\n\nand reinstalling it by:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install ssh.\n\n", "Q: ffmpeg batch convert files I have a folder that contains audio files, files are in sequence named from 1 to 150 but none of the files have file extension.\n What I want is to convert them to aac or.mp3 and If I can join them as a one audio file that I will be fantastic.\nCan some one help me out with this??\nThank you in advanced \n\nA: get a recent, real ffmpeg build\nThe fake version in the repository from the Libav fork can not do this.

Existing tools such as munin can simply be installed, some plugins enabled, and they will periodically monitor your system parameters to produce a graph and store them in a database.

The command could be as simple as\n rsync -a --delete ~/ /backup-drive/daily.backup\n\nHere's a nice tutorial.\n\nA: The only solution that I think exists is to disable weekly backups and wait until the day and time that works and run the first weekly backup from that time and day.\n", "Q: Tried to install wireless driver and now terminal and update manager no longer work either My PC specifications:\n\n\n*\n\n*Dell Latitude D830. \n\n*Fresh install of Ubuntu 12.04 (64bit) dual boot with windows xp pro 6\ndays ago. \n\n*Chip ID is Broadcom BCM4311.\n\n*PCI-ID is [14e4:4312]\n\n*Last week I installed Ubuntu 12.04 (32bit) on two other old Dell\nlaptops, an Inspiron 6000 and an Inspiron 9000, with absolutely no\nproblems.  One dual boot and the other on its own.\n\n*I am totally new to this, never installed an os before and having\nnever even seen Ubuntu before last week...so simple answers please :)\nThis third install went very smoothly, though I had to do it hardwired to the internet, since it couldn't find the wireless:  wireless works perfectly in Windows.  When restarting after the OS install, the screen got stuck on the Ubuntu logo splash page with the 5 dots.  I pressed the button and then rebooted.\nI have tried all that I could find in this forum on fixes for shutdown or resart, none of them have worked.  The screen stays stuck on the Ubuntu with the 5 dots screen and I then push the button to complete the shut down.  The last fix I tried was from this link So I've left issue for now and trying to get the wireless working, with no success on the contrary.\nI've just installed the bcmwl-kernel-source package from these instructions.\nThe wireless connection still didn't work, so I shut down and rebooted.\nNow after rebooting, there is still no wireless connectivity. The wireless switch on the computer is on. There is still no wireless choices in the menu bar. I decided to run the update manager and it doesn't work anymore.\nThrows a Not all updates can be installed error with a list of reasons. When I press close, I get another error, this time Software index is broken, its impossible to install or remove any software - again with suggestions.\nI then went and found on the forum how to uninstall what I had just installed through the terminal, hoping to get back to where I started from, since both the update manager and the terminal were working before the install.\nThe terminal gives me the following result:\nsudo apt-get remove bcmwl-kernel-source.  \nMessage reads on the Terminal:  \nE:  Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open - (11:  resources temporarily unavailable)\nE:  Unable to lock the administration directory (var/lib/dpkg ), is another process using it?\n\nNothing is running in the background.\nI'm rather exasperated since every move I make is bran new, and after spending days reading in the forum and trying what seems to work for others nothing does.\nBefore starting to try to fix the wireless today, everything in Ubuntu works beautifully, now if I can't do updates or use the Terminal, that's not so good. \n\nA: The message \"Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open\" generally means the some other program to install or remove software is open; it may be Software Updater, Ubuntu Software Center, Synaptic or similar. Please find and close it. It may take a reboot.\nbcmwl-kernel-source is incorrect for your 14e4:4312 device; you need to purge it. Please open a terminal and do:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge bcmwl-kernel-source\n\nAnd then get a temporary wired ethernet connection and install the needed firmware for your device:\nsudo apt-get install firmware-b43-installer\n\nAfter it completes, detach the ethernet and reboot. Your wireless should then be working.\n", "Q: How do I change the icon size in the KDE status bar? On my 13 inch screen with 3200x1800px I adapted all fonts to 230 dpi which is ok in most cases.\nAlso in Settings, I could change Icons of the KDE Theme to 64px.\nOnly the Icons in the status bar at the bottom right corner (velocity, Network,...) are still only about 16x16 px, which is barely readable. They seem not to obey the same rule.\n\nWhere can I change them?\n\nA: The setting to change icon sizes, located in Settings > Appearance > Icons > Advanced, seems to have been unusable for years, as you've noted in your question. This appears to have been the case since some version of KDE 4. Possibly it is related to whether the icon theme is in a resolution-independent format.\nA hidden iconSize system tray setting was added around plasma-workspace 5.9. Prior to the addition of this setting, qml files had to be edited.\nFor a standard plasma panel, open $HOME/.config/plasma-org.kde.plasma.desktop-appletsrc in the text editor of your choice. If you are using Latte Dock, open the $HOME/.config/latte/*.layout.latte that corresponds to the layout you are using.\nLook for the entry that corresponds to the system tray. It will look something like this:\n[Containments][#]\n...\nplugin=org.kde.plasma.private.systemtray\n...\n\nThen scroll down until you see something that looks like this:\n[Containments][#][General]\nextraItems=...\nknownItems=...\nshowAllItems=true`\n\nThen add:\niconSize=#\n\nWhere # is a number that refers to one of the following options:\n0 ~ Small\n1 ~ SmallMedium\n2 ~ Medium\n3 ~ Large\n4 ~ Huge\n5 ~ Enormous\n\nTo see the changes log off and on. Or, in a terminal, kill and restart plasmashell:\nkillall plasmashell ; sleep 1 ; kshell5 plasmashell\n\nOr latte-dock...\nkillall latte-dock ; sleep 1 ; kshell5 latte-dock\n\n\nA: It can be adjusted in Settings > Appearance\nAt the bottom of the window there is a slider for Launcher Icon Size.\nSet accordingly\n", "Q: Can't download Ubuntu - computer thinks its an app It does download, but when I try to open the download, my computer thinks it is an application and won't start it. I am not very good with computers, but I know that I want off the Microsoft/Windows plantation... please help.\n\nA: What you're downloading isn't an installer, it's a disc image.  You can't run it from within Windows, you have to burn it to a CD/DVD/USB, shutdown your computer, and then boot from it.\nHere's instructions for CD/DVDs and USB.\nOnce you've done that, restart your computer and change the boot priority such that the CD/DVD/USB boots before the hard drive containing Windows does.  You'll then be presented with the Ubuntu installer.  If booting from the media you created becomes troublesome, check here.\n\nA: Save the file, and then you can burn it to disc, or a USB, boot it, and then try it or install it.\nAs Ubuntu is a separate operating system to Windows, you can't open it as an app, you have to run it separately.

While working on something, or even sometimes while the system is idle, the mouse buttons will stop working. I can move the mouse around all I want, and the cursor will move on-screen, but I cannot click on anything. When this occurs, sometimes I can scroll, other times not. Throughout, the keyboard still continues to function. The only way to get the mouse to start working properly again is to either restart the computer or restart the X server by pressing CTRL+ALT+BACKSPACE. There is nothing wrong with the mouse, it works fine while plugged into other machines. I have all the latest updates according to the Software Updater.

I know how to create a bootable flash drive with an operating system, but i would like both ubuntu 12.04 and linux mint 16 cinnamon to be bootable from one flash drive. Is this possible, and if so how would I do it?\n\nA: *\n\n*Partition your hard drive with something like Gparted, or any hard drive editor, into FAT32, as you can usually only install OS onto FAT32. When you partition something, it basically splits it into to seperate sections for putting files in.\n\n*Use http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net UNetbootin to install an OS onto usb drive. (Make sure you choose the right spot (partition) for installation. It's pretty straightforward once you download it, you just open it, choose the distro you want, and choose the usb device you want to install it to. Note the options will be like disk2s1, to find which one is which (I've only done this on mac), you need to type in \"diskutil list\", it'll tell you the normal name of the drive, and the numbered name like disk1s2. Usually the thing you put on a usb drive is a live boot, which you can boot it from.\n\n*That's basically it, unless you need a bootloader, like REfind http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/.\nTips\n-Please know that you can only run it from the usb, it won't save anything. To make it save, you have to install an OS from another storage device. For example, I could install Ubuntu onto my computer by first making a partitioned spot for the installation of Ubuntu (usually EXT4 format) on your computer and then loading up the thing you installed with the above guides and using the installer to install to your computer partition\n-please keep in mind this is my first answer I think, so I may have gotten stuff wrong.\n", "Q: Exception: cannot get content of ubiquity-frontend-gtk error running python rtupdate hook ubiquity-frontend-gtk Today, I upgraded my desktop from 13.04 to 13.10 and ended up with the following: \n$ sudo apt-get upgrade\nReading package lists...\nBuilding dependency tree...\nReading state information...\nThe following packages have been kept back:\n  libxfce4ui-1-0 libxfce4ui-utils parole xfce-keyboard-shortcuts\n  xfce4-settings xfce4-xkb-plugin xfdesktop4 xfdesktop4-data xfwm4\n0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 9 not upgraded.\n77 not fully installed or removed.\nAfter this operation, 0 B of additional disk space will be used.\nSetting up python3 (3.3.2-14ubuntu1) ...\nrunning python rtupdate hooks for python3.3...\ndpkg-query: package 'ubiquity-frontend-gtk' is not installed\nUse dpkg --info (= dpkg-deb --info) to examine archive files,\nand dpkg --contents (= dpkg-deb --contents) to list their contents.\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/bin/py3clean\", line 200, in <module>\n    main()\n  File \"/usr/bin/py3clean\", line 186, in main\n    pfiles = set(dpf.from_package(options.package))\n  File \"/usr/share/python3/debpython/files.py\", line 53, in from_package\n    raise Exception(\"cannot get content of %s\" % package_name)\nException: cannot get content of ubiquity-frontend-gtk\nerror running python rtupdate hook ubiquity-frontend-gtk\ndpkg-query: package 'ubiquity' is not installed\nUse dpkg --info (= dpkg-deb --info) to examine archive files,\nand dpkg --contents (= dpkg-deb --contents) to list their contents.\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/bin/py3clean\", line 200, in <module>\n    main()\n  File \"/usr/bin/py3clean\", line 186, in main\n    pfiles = set(dpf.from_package(options.package))\n  File \"/usr/share/python3/debpython/files.py\", line 53, in from_package\n    raise Exception(\"cannot get content of %s\" % package_name)\nException: cannot get content of ubiquity\nerror running python rtupdate hook ubiquity\ndpkg: error processing python3 (--configure):\n subprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 4\ndpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of python3-apt:\n python3-apt depends on python3 (>= 3.3);

Once that was done, python3 would no longer die during its configuration and with it, the remaining 76 packages could be installed. Afterwards, I removed the ubiquity package.\n\nA: Your system is in a rather fragile state and if you do anything wrong you may need to reinstall the system. So first of all do a backup of all important information. Now, lets first understand your problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*There are too many not completely installed packages:\n\n77 not fully installed or removed.\n\nThis is rather preocupating.\n\n*\nerror running python rtupdate hook ubiquity-frontend-gtk\n\nThis means that is something really bad. But still that doesn't explain why you have ubiquity related package. So I would recommend you to remove it.\n\n*Dependency hell!\nThere are lots of:\n\nPackage python3 is not configured yet\n\nPython is one of the most important packages in any ubuntu installation. Most of the system is built over python and if that package has problems is very, very likely you are in a irrecoverable state.\nSolution.\nThere are ways to do carpet bombing trying to fix your installation but if I aren't there in front of the system, I would recommend anyone to do it. The easier way to fix it is reinstalling the system after doing backups, verify that the disk is in a good state and install Ubuntu over.\n\nA: For those with the same problem:\nInstalling ubiquity-frontend-gtk package solved my dependency errors installing my Epson workforce WF-3520 printer drivers.\n", "Q: Error while installing packages I'm using Ubuntu 12.04.

Will a old computer with 1024M of RAM and a Pentium 4 CPU be able to host a personal website, while still allowing me to use the web browser? Does someone have any recommendations for helping it run more responsively?\n\nA: Potentially.  With only 1GB of RAM given it's going to have a graphical interface, using a web browser (which are quite memory-heavy nowadays), the experience may be lackluster.\nI would suggest using a lightweight desktop environment instead of Ubuntu's default Unity, such as Xfce or LXDE.  You can install one of these from the command line on Ubuntu Server using sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop or sudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop.  That way, your desktop/web browsing experience leaves as much RAM as possible aside for the web server to use.\n\nA: Running a web server with this configuration is possible just use add classic gnome environment  by following these simple steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*open the terminal window.\n\n*sudo apt-get install gnome-panel\n\n*Now logout and change the default unity environment to gnome with the option above(left) the username bar.\n\n\nPersonally I have the same configuration and its working good classic-gnome.\n\nA: My recommendations:\n\n\n*\n\n*Don't use the server to do anything else than hosting the website (don't install any desktop enviroment, a server is a server)\n\n*Don't use ubuntu on servers, especially on servers like your server, go for Debian instead.\n\n*Don't install Apache, use Nginx instead.\n\n\nIf you really need to install a web browser, then download one of these, no desktop environment needed.

I just installed it and want to run a C program. I have no idea what platform to use or where to write the code. I need to use the pthread.h header file in the program. Can anyone help me?\n\nA: Use:\ngcc MyProgram.c -o MyProgram -lpthread \n\nand dont forget to include the POSIX  library in your code. It will compile your code.\n\nA: If you are going to compile a C program with pthread.h in LINUX using GCC or G++ you will have to use –lpthread option after the compile command.\ngcc xyz.c -o xyz -lpthread\n\nHere,\ngcc is compiler command (compiler name)\nxyz.c is a source file name.\n-o is an option to create objcect file.\nxyz is the name of object (binary) file.\n-lpthread is an option for pthread.h\nfor more details here is the link conatining complete article on it. \nCompiling C program with pthread.h in Linux.\n\nA: First thing you'll need in Ubuntu to compile C/C++ programs is installing GCC (Gnu Compiler Collection) which is part of build-essential package , do that by running:\nsudo apt-get install build-essential\n\nThen you can test if you have it installed by running gcc. If you you see error like Fatal error: file not provided (not sure exact error message, but should be something similar), that means you have compiler ready.\nAnd for editing your Code, you can use already available Gedit, just search for it in Dash.\nNow following is the syntax to compile your C source file, run following where your file is:\ngcc MyProgram.c -o MyProgram\n\nWhere, switch -o is optional, but provided to mention name of Binary file which should be created out of your source.\nThen simply run ./MyProgram to run your binary.\nNote that pthread.h as you mentioned (POSIX Thread) should be available by default with GCC, so simply including it in your C file will do that job, in case it's not available, a simple Google search should help. ;)\nUpdate\nToo long, didn't read? check this. :D\n\nA: If it gives error than you can try out same command by interchanging the parameters as like\ngcc -lpthread -o output_file program_pthread.c\n\nafter that ./output_file provides output for program and here program_pthread.c is the pthread program you have implemented.\n\nA: For C++ program:\ng++ -std=c++11 Myprogram.cpp -o MyProgramTest -lpthread\n\n", "Q: Hardisk driver is not found?

With no extra configuration, the system saw the interface correctly as an intel 82545 chip and loaded the e1000 driver for it. But in the dmesg logs there are some errors for not being able to get the hardware MAC, this prevents this interface from working at all. The system's main board is an asus z87, and although this card uses a 64-bit pci-e interface, it's mounted on a 32bit slot (it's a supported configuration as intel says). This works in windows properly, I checked it, so there must be a driver issue, not hardware. Any suggestion on what's the problem and how to solve it?\nLet me add, I tried to compile the latest e1000 and e1000e kernel modules built from source, but still have the same problem. (of course the kernel for the Ubuntu 13.10, kernel linux_3.11.0-15, has the the e1000 driver built in, not as a loadable kernel module. Is it going to work at all if I rmmod e1000  and insmod /the/new/compiled/e1000.ko?\n\nA: After some trying I found a solution. as stated in dmesg, the e1000 driver failed to verify the NIC's NVRAM checksum, so it rejected the hardware MAC and assigned zeros to the MAC. so I just assigned a valid MAC to the interface, this way the interface enabled.\nthe MAC assignment could be done in two ways:\neither by ifconfig:\n/etc/init.d/networking stop\nifconfig eth0 hw ether xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx\n/etc/init.d/networking start\n\nor through /etc/networking/interfaces:\nhwaddress ether xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx\n\n", "Q: Bash script download dynamic directories How to download the most recent packages in deb files (all in a folder) for my platform (x86_64/i386) & distro with bash script?

I use an external harddrive and mount it on my Ubuntu installations with cryptsetup/dm-crypt. But you need to update your cryptsetup packages to version 1.6 to get this functionality.

And I don't want virtual users.

For example, owncloud. So I want all of the users to be able to access all services with one login. I know this could be solved by LDAP but I am not smart enough to set up LDAP. ;)\n\nA: You're looking for PAM authentication. As far as I know (i.e. after a quick internet search), there's no built-in PAM module for postfix. However, it is available through SASL.\nI've never tried this (as I use LDAP), but you might find these useful resources.

I know how to use reverse proxy since my public ip contain a django application which run on port 8000. But my question is , is it possible to act my machine A as router of machine B.  that will accept connection on port 8080.\n\nA: I think your are looking for the reverse-proxy module of Apache.\nHere is a howto, and the official doc. There are plenty of docs on the net.\nThis is also possible with nginx.\nRegarding Tomcat application, also look here, as you probably want to tell Tomcat what its public address is.\n\nA: SSH tunnel works, run in machine A:\nssh -f -L 3000:192.168.1.2:8080 localhost -N\n\nYou can change 3000 to 8080 (or any other port) if it not used by machine A.\nAny connection to 192.168.1.1:3000 or 1.2.3.4:3000 will be forwarded to 192.168.1.2:8080.\n", "Q: dual boot w7 with 12.04 with gpt table and uefi i have a lenovo z570 with 4gb ram and 700gb hdd with w7 x64. i want to dual boot ubuntu alongside w7 but during installation, there is no install ubuntu alongside w7 option. i have tried all the methods shown in this forum and none seem to work for me. can anyone please help me out with a step by step instruction? i'm new to ubuntu and any help is appreciated\nthanks\n\nA: The \"install alongside\" option is unavailable on many EFI systems.

After going through the Home Page of Ubuntu Kylin, I rather find no considerable difference between Ubuntu Kylin and Ubuntu with Chinese language set as default.   \nThere are of course some special Chinese apps (Chinese lunar calendar, for example); but can't these apps be installed on Ubuntu as well?\nSo if I get an Ubuntu, customize it to have all the same apps as Kylin, and set Chinese as default language, what will be the difference between both?\nWhat was the need of kylin, when ubuntu is itself so customizable?\nThere is no bad in bringing an custom Ubuntu for Chinese people.But there seems to be no reason for making it official.If we look at other official distros like lubuntu or xubuntu, they have a significant difference than ubuntu.This is not the case with kylin.It would only take, say 15 minutes to convert Ubuntu into Ubuntu Kylin.\n\nA: It's just to be used as a national distro. Really deep there is no main differences between  them but just to meet the needs of the Chinese government.\nThe Kylin OS was formerly developed by academics at the National University of Defense Technology in China. It was based on FreeBSD and was intended for use by the Chinese military and other government organizations. In 2013, the Chinese Government reached an agreement with Canonical for them to release a Chinese version of the popular Ubuntu distro and it will be used as a national OS.\nFor more information and check this.\n\nA: ubuntu kylin is basically made for chinese people so with every software chinese language is prefferd and some of the default software and framework has been changed. \n\n\n*\n\n*some of the additional software like kingsoft office\n\n*Kingsoft Kuaipan cloud storage service, complete with 100GB of free storage for every user comming soon\n\n*lotus messanger\n\n*chinese lunar calander\n\n*youker assistant for easy windows to ubuntu migration.\n\n*customised interface\n\n\nfor more information go to :  http://www.ubuntukylin.com/index.php?lang=en\n\nA: I think you are right; you can install standard Ubuntu and 'make it be Kylin' afterwards. One difference you don't mention is that fcitx is the default input method framework on Kylin (instead of IBus).\nKylin was of course created for the convenience of Chinese Ubuntu users.\n\nA: If you are really looking for anythng that you cannot tweak on a pure Ubuntu installation to get the same end result as a Ubuntu Kylin installation, then there is not much. This is actually the same for other flavours, which you can install the related packages and modify the system to achieve the same thing. Just to make it clear, all flavours use the same repositories and so packages of all flavours have to be available to the whole Ubuntu family.\nIn addition, the purpose of Ubuntu Kylin is to create an image that users don't need to do those package install and tweaks to get a usable desktop. There are also a lot more than selecting the correct set of packages, to name a few:\n\n\n*\n\n*out-of-box experience: Simplified Chinese as the default language, installation slideshow specially designed for Ubuntu Kylin. These things you can't achieve by package install since the changes have to be in the ISO image.\n\n*upstream issues: let's say there is a localisation issue which is caused by the upstream code that has not been properly internationalised. Ubuntu Kylin tries to fix this kind of bugs as well for a better overall user experience. You can argue  these fixes will be in Ubuntu ultimately, what I want to say is there is work of a flavour that's not just about package selection.\n\n*applications geared towards China users: many of the applications you mentioned are actually developed or co-developed by the Ubuntu Kylin team.\n\n\nAnyone can do the above without obtaining the Ubuntu flavour status, just start a whole new distribution and here you go. But the Ubuntu project does not object someone to start a flavour to achieve these goals, and being a flavour means Ubuntu Kylin will always follow Ubuntu guidelines and rules, play nice with the community and stay closely with the Ubuntu ecosystem.\n", "Q: I need step by step guidence to recover grub Yesterday I removed some two tiny partions from the disk,today it won't boot.

The user won't be able \n          to use  her  account until the password is set.\n\n\nand:\n\n--gecos GECOS\n          Set  the  gecos field for the new entry generated.  adduser will \n          not ask for finger information if this option is given.\n\n\nFor those wondering what gecos actually is, wikipedia defines it as follows:\n\nThe gecos field, or GECOS field is an entry in the /etc/passwd file on Unix, and similar operating systems. It is typically used to record general information about the account or its user(s) such as their real name and phone number.\n\n\nA: --disabled-login, which is similar to --disabled-password, is used to create the user account without any password and to avoid prompting for it. This is to avoid any attempt to log in as git on your Git server. The reason for this is that you're not supposed to log in to it directly, you're supposed to interact with it via git commands only.\n--gecos sets additional information about the user you're creating (and doesn't have anything in particular to do with git). It's not in much use these days. If you set gecos values for an account, other users can read that information using the finger command so they can get more information about him/her/it. You can also set it separately with the chfn command. The --gecos switch is intended to be followed by five comma-separated values which serves as additional comments about the user. The values are:\n\n*\n\n*Full name\n\n*Room number\n\n*Work phone\n\n*Home phone\n\n*Other\n\nYou can leave out any value and skip the ends, for example --gecos 'Donald Trump,3' would work, as would 'Donald Trump,3,,,President'.\nThe main reasons why you're asked to use the --gecos option is, I guess, to avoid prompts for these values, they are just annoying and don't make much sense these days, and may actually be a security risk. Never put your personal data here!\nHistory\nAccording to Wikipedia, some early Unix systems at Bell Labs used GECOS (General Comprehensive Operating System) machines, so this field was added to carry information on a user's GECOS identity.\n", "Q: VMWare/VirtualBox hangs Ubuntu while installing Windows 7 I am trying to install Windows 7 in VMwarePlayer or VirtualBox on Ubuntu 12.04LTS and every time I have tried it the result is that Ubuntu hangs and only hard reset works. \nI tried both VMware and VirtualBox softwares and different WIndows 7 iso images. \nMy Ubuntu never hangs - NEVER.

I will be installing and maintaining a Python 2.7-based server application on Ubuntu server (12.04). The model of maintenance will be to create a virtualenv and install application standard libraries (from PyPI) and custom libraries (bespoke) there, updating them as required. A separate folder holds the \"application\", which is made up of configuration files and application-specific Python files.\nAs far as I can tell, the only Ubuntu-provided packages I require are python and python-virtualenv. I may do a custom installation of pew to manage the venv - in which case I will sudo easy_install pew and accept that wherever it goes is correct (pew isn't in the 12.04 repo).\nI have a vague awareness that applications should live in /opt or /srv or somewhere like that, and that a server application may live in a different location to a user application. Give all that:\n\n\n*\n\n*where should the virtualenv be located?\n\n*where should the server application folder be located?\n\n\nA: Essentially the location of the virtualenv is irrelevant. You can place it wherever you want. You just have to run source some_venv/bin/activate and then you're set to go.\nThe traditional location is ~/.virtualenvs. \nI use a different setup where I have a ~/projects folder which contains the different virtualenvs and contains the python code for different projects. This is nice and easy because you have everything together. For some it might look a bit cluttered, because you get a bin, local, and more folders in your venv.\nI manage these using virtualenvwrapper which is in the repos. I did not get the chance to test pew, yet.\nIf virtualenvwrapper and virtualenv are set up correctly, the workflow is:\nmkvirtualenv some_venv\nworkon some_venv\ncdvirtualenv\ndeactivate\n\n\nA: For Django applications, Adam Bard recommends locating your virtualenv at /opt/apps/<appname>-env and your application proper at /opt/apps/<appname>-env/site. (Many thanks to don.joey for the excellent link.)\nSlightly unrelated, I also found Hynek Schlawack's Python Deployment Anti-Patterns and Python Application Deployment with Native Packages to be useful reads.\nBased on this, my own review of the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard and an inspection of the /opt folder on my desktop machine, I went with:\n\n\n*\n\n*/opt/virtualenv/<env_name> for the virtual environment\n\n*/opt/<vendor_name>/<app_name> for the server application folder\n\n\nThis allows me to create multiple independent virtualenvs and application folders for different applications, versions, etc as I see fit.\n", "Q: Dual boot windows 8.1 and ubuntu 13.10, unusable drive space I have Windows 8.1(64-bit), i want to dual boot it with ubuntu 13.10(64bit),\nI shrunk the C: drive by 20 GB. created a bootable pendrive and booted through it\nPartitions\nwhen i clicked on \"something else\", the 20GB data i have partitioned is showing \"unusable\"\nSomething else\ni tried using gparted its showing \"it is not possible to create more than 4 primary partitions\"\nplease help, i am new to ubuntu\nmy system specs: core i3(3rd gen), 4GB RAM, 500GB HDD, Dell inspiron 14r\nI do not have enough reputation to upload images so i have given the links.\n\nA: Unless you have one primary partition for your Linux partition, there isn't much you can do. So you need to delete one of your existing partitions before you can install Ubuntu.\nUnfortunately the disks are limited to 4 physical partitions, but if you need more, then you can set up the 4th partition as an extended partition. Inside that extended partition you can have several other logical partitions.\nBut as mentioned earlier, you need to delete one of your existing partitions before you do so.\nHere is a sample layout: Partition table\nHope that helps!\n\nA: Your problem is that you have installed Windows using the old MBR and didn't prepared the HDD with what's for some years recommended, GPT.\nMBR is limited to 4 primary partions. GPT is not, and it's working with old hardware as well (like I have an old EeePC 900HA and works nice with GPT).\nOne way is to delete one of the primary partitions and install Ubuntu.\nThe other way is to migrate from MBR to GPT.\nThe error from gparted is really because you already have 4 primary partitions on MBR.\n", "Q: How to enable cpuset on Ubuntu 12.04?

All you need to do is provide the search terms in the link, like so:\n youtube-dl -f bestaudio 'https://www.youtube.com/results?search_sort=video_view_count&filters=video&search_query=\"SEARCH TERM(S) HERE\"'  \n\nSince that brings up all videos with the search term either in the title or the description (or the comments?), you can further restrict downloading to only those videos with the search term (or any other term) in the title, then use --match-title like so:\n youtube-dl -f bestaudio --match-title \"<regex or caseless sub-string>\" 'https://www.youtube.com/results?search_sort=video_view_count&filters=video&search_query=\"SEARCH TERM(S) HERE\"'  \n\nYou can also reject videos using --reject-title in the same way as --match-title, or use both in conjunction.  \nIncidentally, I just tried those searches and something is buggy in youtube's search facility.  If you remove the \"search_sort=video_view_count\" part of the string, it gives many more results, some of which have none of the terms in them, although the videos were related, so be careful.\nUPDATE\nThe above answer is not really complete. Youtube-dl has a built-in search facility for Google, Youtube, and Yahoo.  For those three, you can use the commands 'gvsearchX:TERMS', 'ytsearchX:TERMS', and 'yvsearchX:TERMS' respectively, and replace the 'X' with the number of results you want (and replace the 'TERMS' with your search terms, obviously).\n\nA: An alternative to youtube-dl has been described here: New Command Line YouTube Player And Downloader With Local Playlists Support: mps-youtube.

Then, run sudo pip install mps-youtube and you're done.\nYou can read more about mps-youtube here.\nNotes \n\n\n*\n\n*this program downloads just the audio if you so wish and hence you save on bandwidth: instead of downloading a video and then extracting the audio at your end, you download just the audio. \n\n*if you don't wish to install all the recommends suggested by sudo apt-get install python-pip use sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends  python-pip.

The correct location on Ubuntu is in /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/. \nAfter creating the 99-calibration.conf file in the correct location, logging out and logging in again should not affect the calibration.\nYou can download and install xinput_calibrator via apt-get from the Ubuntu repositories:\n    sudo apt-get install xinput-calibrator\n\n", "Q: Temperature & RAM monitoring script I have the following script:\n    while :\n do\n        clear;\n        echo \"---------------------------RAM Load------------------------------$\n        free -mt >> memory.txt;\n        free -mt;\n        echo \"---------------------------Temperature---------------------------$\n        sensors >> temp.txt;\n        sensors;\n        sleep 1;\n        clear;\ndone\n\nwhich gets the current system RAM and temperature and writes it to two files, respectively memory.txt and temp.txt\nI want to use this data on a webserver with Dygraphs\nwhat is the best way to clean up the data, because it gives these two file:\nmemory.txt\ntemp.txt\nfor the RAM part I only want the -/+ buffers/cache: line\nand from the temperature part only the temperatures.\n\nA: You should be able to solve this issue by using grep.\nTo get just the -/+ buffers/cache line, alter your free commands to this:\nfree -mt | grep buffers/cache >> memory.txt;\nfree -mt | grep buffers/cache;\n\nTo get only the temperatures try:\nsensors | grep °C >> temp.txt;\nsensors | grep °C;\n\nSo using the following script:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nclear;\necho \"---------------------------RAM Load------------------------------$\"\nfree -mt | grep buffers/cache >> memory.txt;\nfree -mt | grep buffers/cache;\necho \"---------------------------Temperature---------------------------$\"\nsensors | grep °C >> temp.txt;\nsensors | grep °C;\n\nProduces this output:\n---------------------------RAM Load------------------------------$\n-/+ buffers/cache:       1545        449\n---------------------------Temperature---------------------------$\nPhysical id 0:      N/A  (high = +100.0°C, crit = +100.0°C)\nCore 0:             N/A  (high = +100.0°C, crit = +100.0°C)\nPhysical id 2:      N/A  (high = +100.0°C, crit = +100.0°C)\nCore 0:             N/A  (high = +100.0°C, crit = +100.0°C)\naploetz@dockingBay94:~$\n\nFor removing the extra text that you don't want, you could try using awk.\n$ free -mt | grep buffers/cache | awk '{print $3\"\\t\"$4}'\n1588    406\n\nThe temperatures will be a bit trickier, but can be done with tr.\n$ sensors | grep Physical | tr -d '(),' | awk '{print $7\"\\t\"$10}'\n+100.0°C    +100.0°C\n+100.0°C    +100.0°C\n\n$sensors | grep Core | tr -d '(),' | awk '{print $6\"\\t\"$9}'\n+100.0°C    +100.0°C\n+100.0°C    +100.0°C\n\nIf you wanted to get rid of the plusses as well, just add '+' to the delete flag:\n$ sensors | grep Core | tr -d '(),+' | awk '{print $6\"\\t\"$9}'\n100.0°C 100.0°C\n100.0°C 100.0°C\n\n\nA: In addition to Bryce's good advice, there's no need to run the command twice:\nfree -mt | grep buffers/cache | tee -a memory.txt\nsensors | grep °C | tee -a temp.txt\n\n", "Q: Control Mouse with Classic controller joystick in wminput/cwiid I have installed wmgui and cwiid.

I upgrade to Ubuntu 14.04 a couple of weeks ago and I still am wondering how to connect to the Internet using my Etisalat Prolink PHS300 dongle. I have tried many online forums as well as Sakis3G but all of them are telling that they failed to connect. I got a 1kbps connection on the first day, and when I restarted my computer, it did not connect at all. In the inbuilt CD-ROM of the dongle there is some software but it will not install without wvdial and qt3. I do not have another Internet connection. I am dual-booting Ubuntu with Windows XP SP3. I have been using it with Windows for a long time with no problems, whatsoever. As soon as I tried to connect normally, it says \"Network is disconnected\"\nMy APN is \"EBB\" and my dial-up number is *99#\nI have tried installing wvdial offline and it asks for some more expectancies such as \n a. libxplc; \n b. libwvstreams-base; \n c. libwvstreams-extras; \n d. libuniconf;. \n d. libaudio2; \n e. libqt3-mt.\n\nSakis3G gave me a ray of hope but did not work.\nI would appreciate any help provided. I hope my problem will be solved because I really like Ubuntu and wouldn't like to give up on it just because it can't connect to the Internet. My version of Windows is getting outdated and it is too expensive to upgrade and I don't want to use pirated versions.\nThanks in advance,\nSanoo\n\nA: First of all, let's clear up, what the issue is exactly.\nUbuntu doesn't recognise your modem or it do recognise but didn't connect?\nAnyways, if the s/w provided to you on CD-ROM is capable of running your modem on Ubuntu, but needs wvdial and qt3 only, then issue could be solved.\nDo this:\n1. Download following files: http://pastebin.com/JGVdXcAd\nYou can download them from anywhere. It will provide you wvdial and qt3.\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy downloaded files to your 'home' folder.\n\n*Open terminal and type: sudo dpkg -i *.deb\n\n*Enter your password when prompted.\n\n\nThis will install wvdial and qt3 on your system. Hence, try installing your dongle's default application off CD-ROM to see it work.\n\nA: I'm posting this solution for people who wouldn't find a solution for this issue in the web as I couldn't find one.\nI had the same issue and solved it. I'm able to connect to the internet. But the method is not so simple. \nFirst you need to install sakis3g (search the web if you don't know the way)\nAlthough sakis3g is supposed to work it didn't work for me so easy.\nMy 3g dongle was not even detected.\nOnce you plug in the dongle, start a terminal and get root access.\nsudo -i\n\nThen run sakis3g\nsakis3g\n\nA window will pop up and in that select \"connect with 3g\" to see whether it works.\nIf it doesn't come back to the same window and select \"more options\".\nThen select \"only  prepare modem(setup+...)\".\nThen another window will pop up and select \"usb device\" in that window.\nThen select your dongle from the list.\nYou should get a message saying \"Modem on /dev/tty...... registered to etisalat\". Click ok and then select connect with 3g.\nThen you will be asked to select your APN which for etisalat is wap.\nThen enter a username and a password.\n", "Q: Recovering data from previous Ubuntu install I had hard drive issues on my dual boot XP/Ubuntu machine, I replaced the hard drives and I am trying to find data from my old Ubuntu install in the old drive, but I cannot find my file directory at all, where in the Ubuntu install is my data stored?\n\nA: Your data is stored in your home directory at /home/username\n", "Q: Docky not showing up in the task manager?

The network port on the machine (ethernet) is directly built into the motherboard (it is not a separate card) SIS900. Ubuntu is getting all network information automatically but when I run checks there are two different error messages \"Destination Host Unreachable\" and something about the not being on the Network.  \nAll the information on the GUI side is correct. The installation on this machine has been particularly difficult and I have spent several days in overcoming many problems faced. The system is working great expect for this one caveat. Step by step works best for me, this way I can be methodical in my approach.\n\nA: However, I don't understand why that should happen only after you use static-IP -- maybe your interface was configured down initially. \nIf your router IP is 192.168.1.1 it is very likely to be a Class-B subnet configuration.\nThis means the netmask would be 255.255.0.0.\nBy using a Class-C netmask and a network number of 192.168.1.0, you have placed your PC in a different subnet from your router.  That would explain the ping unreachable case.\nShow me your interface ip?\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.10 bootable USB shows black screen with blinking cursor only I used this Universal USB Installer and ubuntu-13.10-desktop-i386.iso (MD5 verified)\nhttp://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/\nBut all I get is black screen with cursor blinking after BIOS's init texts.

I recently set up an NFS server on my Ubuntu server and I'm currently in the process of migrating my files from HFS+ HDDs to ext4. I've run into a problem however where the receiving disk (ext4 format) is running out of space before the transfer is complete. Both drives are 2 TB external USB drives and the receiving drive was newly formatted so there shouldn't have been anything on it.\nI'm aware that the default block size for ext4 is 4K and, as expected, comparing\ndu /media/[Receiving Drive]/*\ndu --apparent-size /media/[Receiving Drive]/*\n\nShows that most (if not all) files are using an additional 4K on the disk. The HFS+ drive, which I've unfortunately already formatted to ext4 so I won't be able to get any info on, had a little over 12 GB of free space however based on current usage of the ext4 disk and the amount of files I've already transferred over, I'm missing over 200 GB of space!\nI have absolutely no idea where this discrepancy is coming from because at most the addition of 4K to every single file would be significantly less than 1 GB, much less 200.\nBoth drives are now formatted as ext4 with a GUID Partition Table and diskutility shows that there's a ~700MB difference in capacity between them (another mystery). \nSuffice it to say, I'm stuck. Any suggestions?\n\nA: With the default settings, ext4 allocates one inode per 16,386 bytes, and an inode is 256 bytes, so on a 2 TB disk, that uses ~32 GB for the inode tables.  You can reduce this when you format with the -T largefile option given to mkfs.ext4, but if you have lots of small files, you may run out of inodes and be unable to create any more, even though there is free space.  Unless most of your files are less than half a meg or so though, this shouldn't be a problem.\nThe other thing is that by default, 5% of the space is reserved, and can not be invaded by normal users.  On your 2 TB drive that amounts to 100 GB.  You can disable this with sudo tune2fs /dev/sdXX -m 0 ( where /dev/sdXX is the drive/partition in question ), but it is generally not a good idea to fill a drive up above 95% anyhow as it tends to cause fragmentation.\n", "Q: How can I replace upstart with systemd?

However I've added the nginx start script (below) to the init.d directory and added it to startup via sudo update-rc.d nginx defaults, but it just won't run at startup. At all. The nginx file is executable and the owner is root (same as my mysql service which is working...)\n#! /bin/sh\n\n### BEGIN INIT INFO\n# Provides:          nginx\n# Required-Start:    $all\n# Required-Stop:     $all\n# Default-Start:     2 3 4 5\n# Default-Stop:      0 1 6\n# Short-Description: starts the nginx web server\n# Description:       starts nginx using start-stop-daemon\n### END INIT INFO\n\nPATH=/etc/nginx/sbin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin\nDAEMON=/etc/nginx/sbin/nginx\nNAME=nginx\nDESC=nginx\n\ntest -x $DAEMON || exit 0\n\n# Include nginx defaults if available\nif [ -f /etc/default/nginx ] ; then\n        . /etc/default/nginx\nfi\n\nset -e\n\ncase \"$1\" in\n  start)\n        echo -n \"Starting $DESC: \"\n        start-stop-daemon --start --quiet --pidfile /etc/nginx/logs/$NAME.pid \\\n                --exec $DAEMON -- $DAEMON_OPTS\n        echo \"$NAME.\"\n        ;;\n  stop)\n        echo -n \"Stopping $DESC: \"\n        start-stop-daemon --stop --quiet --pidfile /etc/nginx/logs/$NAME.pid \\\n                --exec $DAEMON\n        echo \"$NAME.\"\n        ;;\n  restart|force-reload)\n        echo -n \"Restarting $DESC: \"\n        start-stop-daemon --stop --quiet --pidfile \\\n                /etc/nginx/logs/$NAME.pid --exec $DAEMON\n        sleep 1\n        start-stop-daemon --start --quiet --pidfile \\\n                /etc/nginx/logs/$NAME.pid --exec $DAEMON -- $DAEMON_OPTS\n        echo \"$NAME.\"\n        ;;\n  reload)\n          echo -n \"Reloading $DESC configuration: \"\n          start-stop-daemon --stop --signal HUP --quiet --pidfile     /etc/nginx/logs/$NAME.pid \\\n              --exec $DAEMON\n          echo \"$NAME.\"\n          ;;\n      *)\n            N=/etc/init.d/$NAME\n            echo \"Usage: $N {start|stop|restart|reload|force-reload}\" >&2\n            exit 1\n            ;;\n    esac\n\n    exit 0\n\nFYI, I know the normal install directory for nginx is /opt/nginx/sbin but on my system it's actually /etc/nginx/sbin. So that isn't what's wrong.\nRunning sudo pgrep nginx right after booting to the desktop yields no results, but I can start the service using sudo /etc/init.d/nginx start and it works just fine. On subsequent calls to sudo pgrep nginx, I get the PIDs of the nginx processes.\nWhy isn't this working?\n\nA: Due to another problem I was having with NFS shares not being auto-mounted on startup, I figure NGINX was either:\nA) Not actually being started on bootup\nor\nB) Being started but failing to load the site because it referenced files on the NFS mount\nThe NFS mount was probably being loaded via fstab too early in the boot process (before network capabilities loaded) and failed which caused nginx to fail. Fixing the issue outlined here prompted me to add sudo service nginx start to rc.local after sudo mount -a yields expected results.\n", "Q: Graphics problem with Lubuntu 13.10 on AMILO Pro v2020 I installed Lubuntu 12.04 and upgraded to 13.10. I noticed that in both Chrome and Firefox Flash causes some very weird artifacts and behaves strangely. Also I am getting EDID checksum error on boot. The machine I am using is Fujitsu Siemens AMILO Pro v2020, using Intel® 82852/82855 GM integrated graphics.

As I said, when I had Ubuntu 12.04 installed Flash didn't behave like this. Any ideas for fixing this?\n\nA: I checked this thread Mitch mentioned, and followed the instructions in the answer. I succesfully installed the Intel drivers, but Flash worked correctly only for one time in a Youtube video, then the weird behavior started again.\nI thought about re-installing the Intel driver, and deleted xserver-xorg-video-intel package, thinking it's the correct package, and rebooted. Apparently it wasn't the one installed by the Intel installer, but removing the X.Org X server-drivers fixed my problem, and Flash behaves correctly now!\n", "Q: How do I save terminal output to a file? How do I save the output of a command to a file?\nIs there a way without using any software? I would like to know how.\n\nA: If you want to output to the file while the command is being run:\nscript -c ./path/to/executable.bash -f log.txt\n\n\nA: You can redirect the command output to a file:\nyour_command >/path/to/file\n\nTo append the command output to a file instead of overwriting it, use:\nyour_command >>/path/to/file\n\n\nA: An enhancement to consider -\nVarious scripts will inject color codes into the output which you may not want cluttering up your log file.\nTo fix this, you can use the program sed to strip out those codes.  Example:\ncommand 2>&1 | sed -r 's/'$(echo -e \"\\033\")'\\[[0-9]{1,2}(;([0-9]{1,2})?)?[mK]//g' | tee ~/outputfile.txt\n\n\nA: The script command\nThere are two different questions here. The first is in the title:\n\nHow do I save terminal output to a file?\n\nThe second question is in the body:\n\nHow do I save the output of a command to a file?\n\nAll the answers posted here address the second question but none address the first question which has a great answer in Unix & Linux:\n\n*\n\n*Save all the terminal output to a file\nThis answer uses a little known command called script which saves all your shell's output to a text file until you type exit. The command output still appears on your screen but also appears in the text file.\nThe process is simple. Use:\n$ script ~/outputfile.txt\nScript started, file is /home/rick/outputfile.txt\n$ command1\n$ command2\n$ command3\n$ exit\nexit\nScript done, file is /home/rick/outputfile.txt\n\nThen look at your recorded output of commands 1, 2 & 3 with:\ncat ~/outputfile.txt\n\nThis is similar to earlier answer of:\ncommand |& tee ~/outputfile.txt\n\n\n*\n\n*But you don't have to use |& tee ~/outputfile.txt after each commnd.\n\n*The script command has added benefit (or disadvantage) of reloading ~/.bashrc when it starts.\n\n*The script command shows the command prompt ($PS1) followed by the command(s) you entered.\n\n*The script command records all the details in full color.\n\nSend output to clipboard\nMany times we want the output to go to the clipboard so we can paste it later. From this answer you can use:\ncat ~/.bashrc | xclip -selection clipboard\n\nNow you can use Ctrl+V in almost any application to paste the terminal output into your document. To paste the terminal output in the clipboard back into your terminal use Ctrl+Shift+V instead.\n\nA: Yes it is possible, just redirect the output (AKA stdout) to a file:\nSomeCommand > SomeFile.txt  \n\nOr if you want to append data:\nSomeCommand >> SomeFile.txt\n\nIf you want stderr as well use this:\nSomeCommand &> SomeFile.txt  \n\nor this to append:\nSomeCommand &>> SomeFile.txt  \n\nif you want to have both stderr and output displayed on the console and in a file use this:\nSomeCommand 2>&1 | tee SomeFile.txt\n\n(If you want the output only, drop the 2 above)\n\nA: To write the output of a command to a file, there are basically 10 commonly used ways.  \nOverview:\n\nPlease note that the n.e. in the syntax column means \"not existing\".\n  There is a way, but it's too complicated to fit into the column.

The equivalent POSIX sh redirection operators are\nBash          POSIX\n------------  --------------\nfoo &> bar    foo >bar 2>&1\nfoo &>> bar   foo >>bar 2>&1\nfoo |& bar    foo 2>&1 | bar\n\nYou'll notice that the POSIX facility is in some sense simpler and more straightforward.  The &> syntax was borrowed from csh which should already convince you that it's a bad idea.\n\nA: Use terminal emulator features\nAn option not mentioned yet, that can save colours / colors too, is to use a console program — such as Konsole (KDE/Plasma's default terminal emulator) — to save the output.\nKonsole\nKonsole has: \nFile > Save output as... \n\nthe shortcut is Ctrl+Shift+S; it allows the output to be saved as a text file, or as HTML including colors! I'm not sure exactly how much it will save but in my test it only included ~1000, the entire terminal scrollback, (you can increase the buffer by creating a new profile, Profile > New..., and then change the Scrolling settings to capture more; Konsole version 4:21.08.1).\ngnome-terminal\ngnome-terminal has \"copy output as HTML\" too, which allows pasting the HTML into a document; it preserves colour but only copies the content of the output currently shown on screen AFAICT.\ngenerically\nYou can, of course, do a straight drag-select (hold left mouse button whilst dragging) and then copy (ctrl+c, Edit > Copy, or right-mouse-click and choose copy).\nothers?\nFeel free to modify this answer to include other popular terminal apps. My favourite, Yakuake, does not appear to have this feature nor did most of the popular terminals I reviewed, including terminal.app and Hyper.\n", "Q: Copy or export Remmina remote desktop files to another Ubuntu install Is there a way to do a bulk copy or export of all my Remmina connections?

The OS runs pretty well but it's not detecting (and using) all the RAM installed. The X40 has 512MB of internal RAM memory and an additional module of 1GB. After installing Lubuntu I had been using in the laptop Windows XP for a long period of time and it detected all the RAM (1.5GB) so I assume that the RAM it's not malcfuntioning.\nSome data from terminal:\n~$ uname -a\nLinux 3.2.0-58-generic #88-Ubuntu SMP Tue Dec 3 17:40:43 UTC 2013 i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux\n~$ free -m\n             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\nMem:           992        895         97          0         25        482\n-/+ buffers/cache:        387        605\nSwap:         2860          0       2860\n~$ grep MemTotal /proc/meminfo\nMemTotal:        1016400 k\nI installed the 32-bit version (actually I installed Lubuntu because the system didn't allow me to install Ubuntu as a result of not being able to run a PAE kernel). As far as I know Lubuntu has a non-pae kernel however it seems that it's not able to detect all the RAM.\nI found what it seems to be the solution for the problem but involves recompiling the kernel. I don't know how to recompile a kernel, but I guess I will be able to replace the kernel with another that works.\nAnyone knows if there is any non-pae lubuntu kernel capable of detecting more than 1GB RAM? It would be possible to update the kernel to another non-pae kernel that detects the 1.5GB?\nHere I found what it seems to be a solution but (as I said, it seems to require recompiling the kernel) [http://archive09.linux.com/feature/119287][1]\n\nA: It isn't the kernel.  The bios always reserves some memory for itself, and if you have an integrated gpu, it reserves a chunk of ram for it as well.  You may be able to adjust how much it reserves in your bios settings.\n", "Q: What \"echo !T \" do? I don't know how many of you have encountered this, but I find it interesting. Maybe also because I do not totally know what the \"echo\" command can do. If anyone has the interest and nerves to give me a couple of reasons for this I would be most grateful. \nPlaying is learning and I must ask you to check with your terminal first: \nWhat is the output of the command echo !T in your terminal?\nHere is what the terminal shows me as an output:\necho They are 9 in the fellowship\nThey are 9 in the fellowship\n\nThe terminal I am playing with is using the default bash shell, on Ubuntu 12.04.3 LTS. What does \"!T\" stand for in the \"echo\" command?\n\nA: !T is not related to echo but is replaced by bash before echo can see it.\nA ! that is not followed by a white space character or = starts history substitution. That is it gets replaced with the most recent command in the hostory list that starts with what follows the !.\nSo !T gets replaced with the most recent command you entered that starts with a T.\necho then just outputs that.\n\nA: While you are learning/playing in cli (command line interface), you can use man  to get a synopsis of what the command is and what options are available. Basically, echo just outputs text to the screen.

However, after several minutes of no progress, it seemed like that part of installation had crashed, eventually I just reboot my machine. Now whenever I launch my browser (I use Chromium, I realize that may be an issue?), I get the following messages:\n[PIPELIGHT:LIN:unknown] attached to process.\n[PIPELIGHT:LIN:unknown] checking environment variable PIPELIGHT_SILVERLIGHT5_1_CONFIG.\n[PIPELIGHT:LIN:unknown] searching for config file pipelight-silverlight5.1.\n[PIPELIGHT:LIN:unknown] trying to load config file from '/home/scibor/.config/pipelight-silverlight5.1'.\n[PIPELIGHT:LIN:unknown] trying to load config file from '/etc/pipelight-silverlight5.1'.\n[PIPELIGHT:LIN:unknown] trying to load config file from '/usr/share/pipelight/configs/pipelight-silverlight5.1'.\n[PIPELIGHT:LIN:unknown] sandbox not found or not installed!\n[PIPELIGHT:LIN:silverlight5.1] GPU driver check - Your driver is supported, hardware acceleration enabled.\n[PIPELIGHT:LIN:silverlight5.1] using wine prefix directory /home/scibor/.wine-pipelight/.\n[PIPELIGHT:LIN:silverlight5.1] checking plugin installation - this might take some time.\n[install-dependency] Downloading and running wine-silverlight5.1-installer.\n[install-dependency] ERROR: Installer for wine-silverlight5.1-installer did not run correctly or was aborted.\n[install-dependency] ERROR: Execution of wine-silverlight5.1-installer failed.\n[PIPELIGHT:LIN:silverlight5.1] basicplugin.c:346:checkPluginInstallation(): Plugin installer did not run correctly (exitcode = 1).\n[PIPELIGHT:LIN:silverlight5.1] basicplugin.c:105:attach(): plugin not correctly installed - aborting.\n\nSo far I have only tried the following:\nsudo apt-get --reinstall install wine-compholio wine-silverlight5.1-installer wine-mpg2splt-installer\n\nBut that has not resolved the issue. How can I prevent these messages from showing up? While this normally may seem trivial, these messages are accompanied by a dialog box showing up stating that wine-silverlight installation is underway, and I don't want that showing up with every launch of my browser. Furthermore, this happens not only on launch but every time I open up a new site.\n\nA: Such a problem can have multiple reasons. As its not clear what exactly the problem is in your case, I will describe solutions for the most common issues below.\n1. Previous installation was somehow interrupted and files are corrupt\nAt first I would recommend to remove the whole wine prefix. This ensures that no corrupted files are left, which could prevent a proper installation.\nFirst close all browser windows, then run (as a regular user, not root):\nrm -rf ~/.wine-pipelight\n\nThe folder will be recreated automatically and contains only Pipelight specific data, so don't worry about any lost data.\nAfterwards start the browser window again, open about:plugins, and check if it works then.\n2. Outdated version of Pipelight or Wine-compholio\nIf it still doesn't work you should make sure that your version of pipelight and wine-compholio is up to date. You can use\n dpkg --list | grep \"\\(pipelight\\|wine-compholio\\)\"\n\nto check that. Currently (at the time of writing) you should have wine-compholio >= 1.7.12 and pipelight >= 0.2.4.2.\n3. Unusual file system\nWine only works properly when you run it from a \"usual\" file systems - I have already seen installations, where users were trying to run wine from an NTFS drive mounted via FUSE, or other unusual network drive configurations, where Silverlight cannot be installed properly.\nThe easiest way to find out the used file system is by manually taking a look at:\n/etc/fstab\n\nIf the file system is either a network drive or some other unusual file system mounted via FUSE, then this is most likely the problem. If it is not possible to switch to different file system you can alternatively modify the Pipelight config files, such that the wineprefix is located on a different harddrive. Example instructions how to setup something like this:\ncp /usr/share/pipelight/configs/pipelight-silverlight5.1 ~/.config\n\n# Open the new config file in an editor, for example gedit\ngedit ~/.config/pipelight-silverlight5.1\n\n# search for \"winePrefix = $HOME/.wine-pipelight/\"\n# modify it for example to \"winePrefix = /media/secondhdd/.wine-pipelight/\"\n\nUnrelated, but also very important: To watch DRM protected content, the file system where the wine prefix is located also has to support XATTR (extended attributes), otherwise you'll get error N8156-6205! You can ignore this if you don't want to use Pipelight to watch DRM protected content.\nThe following commandline illustrates how to check for extended attributes in the home directory (the default location of the wine prefix):\n# Run this once, such that setfattr and getfattr is installed\nsudo apt-get install attr\n\n# XATTR check, from: http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Netflix/Pipelight\ntouch ~/.xattr_test && setfattr -n 'user.testAttr' -v 'attribute value' ~/.xattr_test &> /dev/null; getfattr ~/.xattr_test 2>&1 | grep -q user.testAttr && echo 'It works!' || echo 'No workie!'; rm ~/.xattr_test &> /dev/null\n\nIf the result is \"No workie!\" (and the attr package is installed) then you are missing XATTR in the home directory. Here is an example of how it can be enabled for ext4.\n4. If it still doesn't work ...\nTo get rid of the annoying dialogs the easiest way is either to uninstall pipelight, or at least to disable the problematic plugins:\nsudo pipelight-plugin --disable silverlight\n\n# if multiple plugins have problems:\n# sudo pipelight-plugin --disable-all\n\nNevertheless this doesn't really solve the problem, but just hides the error. If you want to use Pipelight and need additional support, the fasted way is to ask someone in #pipelight on IRC freenode (be a bit patient if noone responds immediately), or alternatively post a more detailed error description on launchpad and we'll help you to track it down.\n\nA: Make sure your Browser is closed before installing in terminal to prevent crashing,I had a similar problem and had to abandon Chromium and switch to Chrome to make it go away.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.10 USB problem I recently dualbooted Ubuntu 13.10 on top of 12.04 and now both distros won't recognize USB devices.

I decided to migrate from Ubuntu 13.10 to 12.04 LTS, so I have downloaded .iso image and wrote it to my USB-stick. During the installation, on a stage of partitioning hard drive, I met one problem.\nI have two big partitions (Windows partition, partition for Files) and it's all clear about them. But I also have two small partitions. The first one is FAT32, 100MiB size and in it there are Windows bootloader files, Ubuntu bootloader files. The second one is 128MiB size, unknown filesystem, \"msftres\" flag.\nWhat should I do in order to correctly install Ubuntu? As I know, I should choose the first 100MiB FAT32-partition as a EFI-partition, but I am afraid that Windows bootloader files will be destroyed. Please, help me.\n\nA: If there's already an efi partition, you do not need to do any thing. Just mount it to /boot/efi. Then installer should do everything for you.\nFor me, sda3 is \\efi and sda8 is /boot,\nso what I need to do is\nmount /dev/sda8 /boot\nmkdir /boot/efi && mount /dev/sda3 /boot/efi\n\nfinally it looks like:\nhousezet@arch: ~\n$ lsblk\nNAME    MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT\nsda       8:0    0 931.5G  0 disk \n├─sda1    8:1    0   260M  0 part \n├─sda2    8:2    0   1.5G  0 part \n├─sda3    8:3    0   260M  0 part /boot/efi\n├─sda4    8:4    0   128M  0 part \n├─sda5    8:5    0 845.1G  0 part /home/win\n├─sda6    8:6    0   392M  0 part \n├─sda7    8:7    0  33.9G  0 part \n├─sda8    8:8    0   500M  0 part /boot\n├─sda9    8:9    0  19.5G  0 part /\n├─sda11   8:11   0    27G  0 part /home\n└─sda12   8:12   0     3G  0 part [SWAP]\nsr0      11:0    1  1024M  0 rom \n\nand \nhousezet@arch: ~\n$ ls /boot\nefi  initramfs-linux.img  vmlinuz-linux\n\nFor 'msftres' flags, refer to this question:\nIs it safe to format msftres, msftdata and hidden partitions?\n\nA: In 12.04 you should not choose the guided option to install along side Windows, as that will create a 2nd EFI System Partition (ESP). (To my knowledge there should only be one ESP per hard drive, but I may be wrong on that or implementations differ.)\nInstead choose to manually specify the partition layout and choose to use the existing ESP that already contains the Windows bootloader files as the ESP of your Ubuntu installation. By choosing that predefined option, the partition will not be formatted (the checkbox is disabled) and Ubuntu's bootloader files should only be copied to \\EFI\\ubuntu\\. \\EFI\\Boot\\ and \\EFI\\Microsoft\\ directories should be left untouched.\nBacking up contents of the ESP as suggested by @RodSmith is always a good idea. If something goes wrong you could just copy the files back and if the Windows boot entry itself got deleted you could add it back with efibootmgr or bcfg via UEFI shell. But Ubuntu's installer only creates UEFI bootmenu entries, it doesn't delete any of them. You can also run bcdboot to repair a broken BCD configuration from another Windows installation or installation media.\n", "Q: Do I need to add the ppa before update a software via terminal? Before updating a software which canonical does not support for updates (like vlc, Skype), do I need to add the relevant ppa to the system before run \"apt-get install packagename\" or \"apt-get --only upgrade install packagename\" ?\n(I'm using ubuntu 13.10)\n\nA: If I understand your question correctly the answer is  \nNo.\nThe Ubuntu repositories contain both VLC and Skype, but you might be able to get newer versions from a PPA.\nOne way to tell if the package you want is in your current repos (including any PPAs you've already added) is:     \napt-cache search <packages-name>   \n\nOr you can open the software center and search.

So, probably after a system restart your alias will work.\nBut, the right way to create aliases is:\n\n*\n\n*if you want to create system wide aliases, these should go in /etc/bashrc file\n\n*if you want to create personal aliases, these should go into your ~/.bashrc file, or better into ~/bash_aliases file.\n\n", "Q: Failed to start X server Everything was ok until I get a dialog box stating:\n\nfailed to start x server(your graphical interface) It might not be set\n  up correctly.

I have created some aliases in the .bash_aliases file. Now there is one command where I ssh into my remote server and do some dynamic port forwarding and essentially create a socks proxy. So I need to configure my proxy settings accordingly.\nThe command looks like:\nproxy off && ssh -D <port> <username>@<hostaddress>\n\nI have aliased the above command and when I type the alias in the terminal, I am connected to my remote server successfully. However after this is done, I need to run another command in a new terminal window to configure my newly created socks proxy. Basically I just need to run:\nproxy socks #It configures my laptop to use the socks proxy\n\nI can't do it in the same terminal window and just && it after the ssh command because that would mean I am trying to execute the command on the remote server. I want to run this command on my laptop. \nIs there any way I can run the second command in a new terminal window in a single line like we pipe or and different commands? It's really inefficient to open a new tab in the terminal every time I ssh into my remote server, just so that I can type a single command to configure my proxy and then close that tab because I don't need it anymore.\n\nA: Try like this instead:\nport=1234\nremote=username@host\nproxy off && ssh -fND $port $remote && proxy socks\n\nThe -f flag tells ssh to go into the background and the -N tells to not execute commands, just forward ports.

My laptop gets severe framerate issues with Unity-3d due to low end specs. Any alternative answers are welcome I just want to move onto a low-end shell but Unity-2d is preferrable.\nThanks.\n\nA: I have a laptop with a graphics card (gma500) which has a framebuffer driver only, resulting in the same horrible framerates/performance.\nThe best solution for me is running Lubuntu. This is Ubuntu including the same software repository, but with a light weight desktop manager called LXDE. It is graphically not as slick, but muuuuch faster on light hardware or on systems with some issues. I even recommend it on more modern computers, if you prefer speed above presentation.\nIf you like the idea, you can give Lubuntu a try by downloading and running it live from a CD or USB-key.\nDoes this help you?\n\nA: Starting from Ubuntu 12.10, Unity-2D is no longer in the repository.

Or,\nsudo ln -s \"$HOME\"/julia/julia /usr/local/bin\n\nNote: you need to use sudo to access /usr/local/bin as it is system directory.\nAlternate User level Method (if you do not have root access)\nYou can create a folder $HOME/bin and put it in path, use the following commands in terminal,\ncd\nmkdir bin\necho \"export PATH=\\$HOME/bin:\\$PATH\" >> ~/.bashrc\n. ~/.bashrc\n\nNow create a softlink in $HOME/bin as,\nln -s \"$HOME\"/julia/julia \"$HOME\"/bin\n\n\nA: You can also just right click on the Julia file and navigate to Make Link then copy the newly created link to anywhere on your home directory.\n", "Q: After 13.10 Upgrade: ROXTerm default terminal I have just upgraded to 13.10 and found that Ctrl+Alt+T will now launch ROXTerm (of which I haven't even heard before).

It can be if the application using it was not using it properly thus creating holes and such.

(You don't need any of the ; there but that's not a problem.)\nIt seems that somehow your script is not really executed, because:\necho ${#nonexistentarray[@]}\n\nThis will always print a number that's 0 (if the array doesn't exist) or higher (if the array or the variable exists).\nSo in your script, if these two lines are really executed:\nlastIdex=${#usersArr[@]};\necho \"$lastIndex\";\n\n....... ok...

Another option is the alternate CD. (If I recall correctly, it's only available for Lubuntu, but I've used it to install a system with KDE recently.)\nI can't comment yet, so I'm kinda guessing here: You used a live CD or a live USB stick which booted alright to the desktop using the TV as a monitor.

The drive is probably failing.  Run dmesg for detailed error messages, and open the disk utility and check the SMART health of the drive.\nMost likely you will see IO errors reported in dmesg, and bad sectors in the disk utility.\n", "Q: How to automatically save file with Nautilus without specifying location with Firefox / Iceweael?

Then i found Plop Manager.\nI want to ask that Can i dual bot through USB [ Linux (Ubuntu or anyother) with windows ] using Plop Manager...\nor Plop manager is only used to install a new OS and Don't provide Dual booting.\nPlease Tell, And if any good tutorial (video tutorial) available, Please share the link or send me in pm ;) Thanks\n\nA: Plop Boot Manager allows you to boot from USB, although depending on what system you have, it might not work because of hardware or software issues.\nBy itself, Plop is technically a bootloader. In order to get it to do anything, you have to supply it with a disk that contains a operating system (if it's a installer, it will load the installer to install that OS into your computer. If it's a live system, it will load the OS from the flash drive onto RAM)\nIf you want to set up dual-boot, just boot Plop into your CD drive at startup, and plug in your flash drive in a USB port, then select \"USB\" in Plop Boot Manager. It will load the mass storage drivers required to read your flash drive, then boot from it.\nAlthough if you use a Ubuntu-based distro, upon installation it will usually find a Windows partition and ask if you want to \"install Ubuntu alongside it\" if it finds one. \n", "Q: Eclipse installation directory I want to install the latest Eclipse Kepler Java EE manually. So far so good. \nMy questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*there are obviously 2 possible install directories for the extracted eclipse folder: \n\n\n/opt or /usr/local what is the recommended one?\n\n\n*\n\n*The same but for creating a symbolic link: two possibilities to \n\n\n/usr/bin or /usr/local/bin \nsame here what is the recommended directory?\nMy best bet: install directory /opt/eclipse and symbolic link to /usr/bin?\n\nA: According to the Unix Filesystem Hierarchy Standard, /opt and /usr/local are to be used as follows:\n\n/usr/local:\n\"The /usr/local hierarchy is for use by the system administrator when installing software locally. [...] It may be used for programs and data that are shareable amongst a group of hosts, but not found in /usr.\"\n/opt:\n\"/opt is reserved for the installation of add-on application software packages. [...] Programs to be invoked by users must be located in the directory /opt/<package>/bin or under the /opt/<provider> hierarchy.\"\n\nSo to answer your two questions:\n\n\"/opt or /usr/local what is the recommended one?\"\n\nBorrowing from this answer (which goes into more detail than I ever could), /opt is intended for prebuilt packages containing prebuilt binaries that are ready for unpacking. If you are compiling Eclipse yourself, /usr/local would be the correct place.\n\n\"/usr/bin or /usr/local/bin?\"\n\n/usr/bin is intended for software provided by your distribution. If you are building Eclipse yourself, the installation prefix should be set to /usr/local.\n\nImportant note: under normal circumstances, both /usr/local and /opt are owned by root and are not world-writable. If you are not the system administrator, then you will need to get them to install the files or use your home folder.\n\nA: For the Googlers, the default installation directory in 2022-09 CDT is:\n~/eclipse/cpp-2022-09/eclipse/eclipse\n\nAnd just use the default unless you have great reason not too.

I downloaded a photo from gmail inbox and it saved in the downloads folder. When I set it as wallpaper it appears upside down. I have tried it with a couple of other photos but no change. The standard lubuntu ones are fine. Has anyone got any ideas as there seems to be no option to change it?   Many thanks, Ian.\n\nA: My thought after hearing this is that the pictures that you are trying to set as desktop wallpaper contain some EXIF data that define their orientation.\nWhile the photo ought to have been taken upside down, the EXIF data (that the camera included in the photo) inform your system that the picture was taken this way, and thus it displays the picture as it should be. This should be true for the file manager and for the picture viewer, in your case, but not for the application drawing your desktop.\nMy suggestion would be to open the picture in a program like Gimp, that will open it as is, and rotate it normally, then overwrite the original (or save it as a new image) and set it again as desktop background.\n", "Q: Is there another volume control sliding bar for Xfce?

It's kind of fun actually ^_^ ...until you lose data you care for :| \nTake care!\n", "Q: I lost some files recently I installed Ubuntu 12.04 LTS alongside with Windows 8 and my hardisk got a three partitions one for windows another one for ubuntu and the last is NTFS partiotion .. \nI copied data to the NTFS partition from my ubuntu after a while I logged in Windows 8 and copied another file to the same partition .. I came back to linux but I found that all the previous data I copied to the NTFS partiotion didn't exist\nI tried unhide the files but didn't pay off ,, I also tried to list the files from the terminal inorder to find them but I didn't find them althought the disk appears FULL and didn't have a space \nWhat I have to do to regain my files and thank you :)\n\nA: This problem was almost certainly caused by a Windows feature called Fast Startup, Hybrid Boot, or Hybrid Shutdown. This feature turns an ordinary shutdown operation into a suspend-to-disk operation. This speeds up the subsequent reboot, but it's incompatible with dual-boot configurations. The trouble is that filesystems are left in an inconsistent state, so if another OS (such as Ubuntu) tries to access them, the best-case scenario is that the other OS won't permit it and the worst-case scenario is that you'll end up with filesystem damage. To fix this problem, you must disable the Fast Startup feature, as described here, among other places.\nSince you say you copied the files, you've presumably got the originals elsewhere. If so, I recommend you simply disable Fast Startup and move on. If you've lost the files, you'll need to use a low-level NTFS data recovery tool to find them. PhotoRec might do this, but chances are there's a Windows-specific tool that will do it better. I'd ask on a Windows forum if you need advice in this arena.\n\nA: There are many data recovery soft. They will scan your disk any try to find deleted files. \nLook at this article: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/File_Recovery\nTo avoid losting data in future, you may need to turn off hybrid boot in windows, and make sure windows partition is unmounted before rebooting linux.\n", "Q: Shutdown and restart problem in Ubuntu 13.10 - Problema en apagado y reinicio en Ubuntu 13.10 After installing updates and making changes to Ubuntu - when I shutdown or restart - when I am turning off the system it stays there loading and does not completely shut down.\nSo what I do is forcibly shut with the button on the PC. What do you need to help solve this? How do I fix it?\n\nOriginal Question in Spanish:\nDespués de estar instalando actualizaciones y haciendo cambios en\nUbuntu a la hora de apagarlo o reiniciarlo cuando se esta apagando se\nqueda ahí cargando y no se termina de apagar. Entonces o que hago es\napagarlo forzadamente con el boton de la pc. ¿A que se puede deber\nesto? ¿Como lo soluciono?\n\n\nA: You shouldn't forcibly shutdown your system. If it's doing stuff, you wait till it ends. Especially if it's applying upgrades. This is because your system can be left in an inconsistent state and break something really badly.\nSo, how to fix it? Start installing the upgrades yourself, should be a good start.\n", "Q: How to give different groups different permissions on a specific folder? I have two groups \"Group1\" and \"Group2\"\nI have also folder \"Folder\"\nI want to give Group1 read and write permission , while Group2 only read .\nAny suggestion ?\n\nA: These commands should work:\nsudo chown -R OWNER-USERNAME:GROUPNAME /PATH/TO/Folder\nsudo chmod -R 664 /PATH/TO/Folder\n\nThis will hopefully provide read & write access to the owner and the group, and read-only access to 'Others' which should include Group2. \nchmod manual page here.\nchown manual page here.\nTo reset any changes so only the owner has access, run:\nsudo chown -R OWNER-USERNAME:OWNER-USERNAME /PATH/TO/Folder\nsudo chmod -R 600 /PATH/TO/Folder\n\n\nA: Let me get this straight:\n\n\n*\n\n*You want group1 to have read/write access to a particular folder.\n\n*You want group2 to have read-only access to that folder.\n\n*You don't want others to have read access to that folder.\nBy default, Linux's permission system does not allow for this. The reason is simple: for each inode there are only three bits (rwx) that describe permissions for a particular group, namely the group that owns the file/directory referred to by that inode. Any user who is not the owner nor belongs to that group automatically falls under others. In practice this is most often sufficient, but in some rare cases it may not be.\nThe good news is that Linux actually supports ACLs (access control lists), which allow for a much more fine-grained access control. In order to enable ACLs, you have to add acl to the mount options. For instance, if the partition that contains the directory where you want to set up advanced access control is mounted like this in /etc/fstab:\n/dev/sda1  /      ext4    defaults                    0 1\n\n...you would change that to:\n/dev/sda1  /      ext4    acl,defaults                0 1\n\nThen you need to remount the filesystem (e.g., mount -o remount /dev/sda1), or simply reboot.\nNext let's make sure your folder /path/to/folder grants read/write access for group1. The permissions should look something like\ndrwxrwx---   2 owner group1      4096 Dec 14 02:42 folder\n\nAdditionally, you want to grant read access for group2, and no access at all for others. To achieve this, issue the command\nsetfacl -m g:group2:rx /path/to/folder\n\nThat's it. You can look into the ACL permissions of that folder later by using getfacl, namely:\ngetfacl /path/to/folder\n\nMore information here: ACLs: Extended file-permissions.\n", "Q: Why can't Ubuntu recognize my parititions? I am trying to install Ubuntu 13.10 as a dual-boot with Windows 8.1 on a Toshiba Satellite p55-A5200.\nI downloaded it and installed the boot-helper, because my startup showed no menus. It then showed a choice between Windows 8.1 and Ubuntu on startup, so I chose to try out Ubuntu then install. \nIn trying to install Ubuntu, it cannot find any other OS even though I have turned off safe boot in Windows. The computer recognizes that the partitions are there, but Ubuntu does not. The same happened with 12.04. \n\n\nA: The screen shot you posted shows it recognizes the partitions just fine; what it seems to have trouble with is the filesystem in the 4th partition.  There seems to be something wrong with it, so run chkdsk /f on it from Windows.  Also make sure you have disabled the \"fast boot\" option in Windows, which hibernates the computer instead of shutting down, and that prevents safely accessing the partition from another OS.\nparted's resize command only works on fat and hfs.\n\nA: Like @psusi said,Ubuntu fails to recognize the partition.This is because your Windows OS isn't shutdown properly.You can check it with running the below commands on terminal,\nsudo mkdir /media/os\nsudo mount /dev/sda4 /media/os\n\nThe output of the above command will be like,\nThe NTFS partition is hibernated. Please resume and shutdown Windows properly.\n\nFor this you have to follow the below steps,\n\n\n*\n\n*Shutdown the Ubuntu OS and then remove the Ubuntu live disk.\n\n*Boot into Windows and make a Restart(not shutdown).\n\n*Now it automatically boot into Windows.Now Shutdown your Windows PC.(Between these operations,don't try to view the files in C or D like drives).\n\n*In the shudown state,insert your Ubuntu installation disk and then boot from it.Now your Ubuntu installer will recognize that partition.And you can make changes on it.\n", "Q: VM Loading Windows 8.1 dual-boot partition I just decided to try out Ubuntu (I'm new to Linux, so bear with me please).\nI had Windows 8 installed and want/need to keep it.

Or does it have to be created as a VM only?\nI don't really need/want another installation of Windows at the moment, but I'd like to be able to use it from Ubuntu from time to time.\nUbuntu version is 12.04 LTS\n\nA: According to the VirtualBox Manual (9.9.1), an actual disc drive can be used as opposed to a virtual disc file (such as VDI, VMDK or VHD) for VMs. It's referred to as a RAW disc.\nVMWare is also capable of using an existing disc drive for a virtual machine.

I have just installed Ubuntu minimal because it would fit on a cd. Now, all I get is the command line. What can I do to upgrade everything so it is the full-fledged OS, as if I had installed it from the normal ISO file instead of minimal?\n\nA: There is no such thing as \"ubuntu minimal\".  The mini.iso refers to the size of the iso, not what it installs.  The image is small because it only contains the installer itself, and it downloads everything that it installs.  You have the same system you would had you used the desktop cd.\n\nA: Choose your flavor and then:\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\n\nor\nsudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop \n\nor\nsudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop\n\netc... That's all there is to it.\n\nA: Not sure, but this should install all you need:\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop unity compiz-plugins-extra ubuntu-restricted-extras\n\nThat should install the usual Ubuntu desktop, with the additional codecs for flash player etc. ubuntu-restricted-extras does the following, taken from Software Center:\n  \nThis should install all the graphical features, so that when you reboot, it should boot to a graphical screen, and you should be able to login in to the Unity Desktop. Note that the above command will need to download a lot of packages, so might take some time, and use some bandwidth.\n\nA: I realize this isn't quite the answer you're looking for, but Lubuntu should fit on a CD. (Lubuntu is basically the same as Ubuntu, but with the LXDE desktop, instead of Unity.)\nIf you are looking to install Ubuntu, you could start by installing Lubuntu. Once Lubuntu is installed and running, you can open a terminal, and run sudo apt-get install ubuntudesktop to get the Unity desktop (or just stick with the LXDE desktop). If desired, you should also be able run 'sudo apt-get --auto-remove purge lubuntu-desktop', to get rid of LXDE completely.\nA word of warning: I should mention that I haven't tested any of these methods, and cannot guarantee that they will work. But, I don't see any reason why they wouldn't.\n", "Q: WOL - Ubuntu 12.04 LTS Power computer off, computer turns back on I have an GA-B75M-D3H Gigabyte motherboard with an i3 processor that I'm using WOL from a windows machine to start the computer.

Has anyone else had this issue? I know my computer supports WOL but I can't figure out why it keeps turning back on after powering it down. Rather frustrating. Any help would be great!\n\nA: Is WOL in the BIOS or in the Ubuntu install itself? If it is in the BIOS, certain BIOS's have an option to restart when shut off in this mode, like a server would act to keep online 24/7. This may be an option within your BIOS, check around in there for a setting that restarts your computer after a power down or something along those lines. I hope it leads you in the right direction..

At least 2 LTS versions. I have always just upgraded my server in place. I purchased new hardware that will replace that older server and instead of just moving the LVM over from the old server I've decided to start fresh.\nMy normal procedure for fresh server installs is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install from CD/USB without network connection\n\n*Log in, attach network, install some base packages that are not there by default\n\n*sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade to kick off the massive download\n\n*Continue to setup server while (3) completes\n\n\nThis normally results in about 15 minutes of me waiting for the server to install offline, followed by a much longer period where the updates download and install but at least by that point I can start using the server.\nWith the 13.10 server image that I just pulled down via torrent I cannot seem to find a way to install without a functional network connection.

Now I decided to install Ubuntu 13.10 alongside Windows, basically to dual boot. I got myself out of Windows, and booted from my little pendrive, where I had GParted and I shrank the Windows partition. I made it 100 GB smaller to make room for my Ubuntu partition. I made a new partition for Ubuntu with Ext4 filesystem. I also made a little 1GB partition for swap.\nSo now I basically have like: \nsda1 is Windows Reserved\nsda2 is Windows\nsda3 is Ubuntu\nsda4 is a Logical Partition (or extended? hm, anyway:)\nsda5 is my swap.\nIt is all very nice and OK until this point.\nWhen I rebooted, I was not prompted with system selection. Instead, my computer booted straight into Windows. I made a little research, and found EasyBCD to dual boot. I added an entry for Ubuntu on sda3 with GRUB2, and tried to boot again. Now I got a prompt, but when I chose Ubuntu, it gave me error that is couldn't find \"AutoNeoGrub2.mbr\" or something like that. So I continued searching forums, and decided to install GRUB manually. So I booted my Ubuntu LiveCD, and installed GRUB in terminal using\nmount /dev/sda3 /mnt\n\ngrub-install --boot-directory=/mnt /dev/sda\n\nAfter that, I rebooted, and got a GRUB screen. But it wasn't a menu, just a command prompt, and I did not know how to manually boot with it, perhaps I couldn't do it anyway. At that moment I was desperate, because I couldn't get either to my Windows, nor my Ubuntu. I tried many things with my Windows install disk's recovery cmd, and finally got my MBR and bootloader back, and now I could get into Windows as I am writing this. But still cannot get into Ubuntu, and I don't understand what is the problem.

Its properties for consideration are described at How does ubuntu determine inactivity before suspending?\nInstead of using sleep(3) in the code (like sleepd does), it is more battery-friendly if you use poll(3) or select(3) which have a timeout parameter. (This assumes that the /dev/input/* devices are poll-able, I don't know if that is the case but you should look up the documentation)\n\nUpstream (git repo) has already removed the default hal dependency (commit), so you can try building from sources. The following commands were tested in a Kubuntu 13.10 Live environment. It installs the build dependencies, fixes a bug in the Makefile that prevented HAL from getting disabled and finally creates a deb package.\nsudo apt-get install build-essential git debhelper libapm-dev\ngit clone git://git.kitenet.net/sleepd.git\ncd sleepd\nsed 's/ifdef USE_HAL/ifeq ($(USE_HAL), 1)/' -i Makefile\ndpkg-buildpackage -b -us -uc\n\nThis produces a sleepd_2.05_amd64.deb package in the parent directory which you can then install on machines. This package requires a battery or AC interface to be present (e.g. /sys/class/power_supply/*), otherwise it will try APM. Since modern machines do not use APM, but ACPI, it will exit silently.\nSo while the package builds and install fine, you are better off with writing a new daemon if something like this is not already implemented.\n\nA: is the power settings under system settings missing because thats where you can graphically set the time\n\nas you can see if you have this which I'm sure you have, then you can modify it.\n", "Q: Can't use QWERTY layout after make IBus work with Dvorak layout after reboot To keep my Input Method (Bogo or Unikey) of IBus working with Dvorak keyboard layout after reboot, I use sudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration to set keyboard as Dvorak, and go to tab Advance in IBus Preferences to check Use system keyboard layout.\nThe problem is, sometimes my friends want to borrow my laptop and I can not easily switch to Qwerty layout because any Input Method will use Dvorak.

Recently after performing an upgrade, and hence having to redo some of the manual configuration changes I'd performed, e.g. to configs in /etc or /usr/share, I decided I'd be more strict with myself this time and put all changes I make to my system into packages, so on the next upgrade I can just install my packages and have everything ready to go. \nMy first package is for my custom keymap. Following this post: create a .deb Package from scripts or binaries I have created a folder for the package and have my keymap listed in the debian/install file, to be installed in /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols. I'm also going to need to add the symbols to /usr/share/X11/xkb/evdev.xml for them to be recognised, and thought that it would be better to use patch for this rather than overwriting the file. \nTo reiterate, I want to use patch as the installation method for my alterations to evdev.xml, not to patch package source code using quilt (which is what I've found through Internet searching)\nSo I have my keymap in the install file, and a patch command in the postinst file. My problem is that I don't know how to include the patch files into the package; after running debuild, the script and keymap are in the deb file, but the diffs aren't, so the postinst script won't be able to run.\nIs there a way I can get my patches (or better, a folder called Patches) into the package, for use during the installatoin? If possible, I don't want to install these patches anywhere as they're only necessary during the installation process.\nThanks.\n\nA: Short of installing them somewhere like /usr/share/$package/patches/, there isn't a way that I know of to have those files available during the postinst script's run. More importantly, while this is a package just for your use, it is bad practice for one package to change files owned by another package.

All versions of Ubuntu have at least version 2.15 because it's a faily important package (reference).\nTo upgrade it, use these commands in a terminal:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install libc6\n\n\nA: For the benefit of those like me who are only experiencing this issue in one particular directory;\nIn my case there was a shared library file in my directory that was somehow throwing off the OS. I opened the folder in a file explorer, sorted by 'mime type' then deleted files of the type 'sharedlib' (or application/x-sharedlib) until my command (ls) worked again without that error. In my case the shared library file at fault was named 'libc.so.6'.\n\nA: I had this issue on Raspbian with RPiCam. It turned out being easier to upgrade my distro than any of the other hacks/workarounds. In my case I upgraded my Raspbian Stretch to Raspbian Buster. I guess the lesson is to always flash the latest Raspbian version.\n", "Q: imwheel destroys back / forth navigation buttons from my mouse I installed imwheel correctly with sudo apt-get install imwheel.

OK, I have actually done this, no problem. \nBut the issue is I would like to be able to boot from this large USB stick onto my UEFI laptop, running Win 8.1, which, of course won't recognise it without me changing the setup in a way that won't let me run Win 8.1 without changing the setup back again. Messy.\nI've already created a 'Live' 64bit Ubuntu 64bit 13.10 installation on another USB stick which I definitely know I could use to install Ubuntu onto a new partition on my UEFI - Secure Boot Win 8.1 machine. But I don't want to do that. \nI simply want to run full Ubuntu from my large format USB stick on that machine - and I don't know a way of making that stick UEFI bootable at the same time as installing Ubuntu on it again (or diddling with the existing installation, if necessary). The problem is that I'm obliged to create any new installation on this stick via an old non-UEFI computer. I can't do it via my Win 8.1 machine. So I just to not get any option via the 'Something Else' installation method to choose EFI.\nPhew!\nAnybody know what I can do (apart from take a running jump)?\nDavid\n\nA: Not sure why you cannot use Windows UEFI system to create UEFI flash drive. You should still turn off fast boot, and probably turn off secure boot. You then should be able to boot Ubuntu installer and using Something Else install to the second flash drive. You must specify to install grub2's boot loader to that flash drive.\nIf not you cannot easily create a UEFI bootable device on a BIOS system. You can manually partition with gpt which is required for for UEFI boot. But Ubuntu will also boot in BIOS mode from gpt partitioned drives and Boot-Repair will convert a BIOS install to UEFI by uninstalling grub-pc and installing grub-efi. But that needs to be on a UEFI system.\nYou can format in advance using gparted, advanced choose gpt not default msdos(MBR) partitioning. Create 200 or 300MB FAT32 partition with boot flag so it is efi partition. If booting initially in BIOS mode create an unformatted 1 or 2MB partition with the bios_grub flag. Then add partitions you want, / (root) and /home or data. If wanting to also share data with Windows, make first partition NTFS, and efi etc after that.\nI have not tried it but you may be able to just copy grub's efi boot files into efi partition and add a configfile to get it to find grub.cfg in your install. Or manually boot from grub rescue and reinstall grub.\n", "Q: Touchpad not detected in Ubuntu 13.10 (Samsung Series 3 NP350V5C) Touchpad is not detected at all:\n>xinput list\n\n⎡ Virtual core pointer                      id=2    [master pointer  (3)]\n⎜   ↳ Virtual core XTEST pointer                id=4    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ Logitech USB Receiver                     id=9    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ Logitech USB Receiver                     id=10   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎣ Virtual core keyboard                     id=3    [master keyboard (2)]\n    ↳ Virtual core XTEST keyboard               id=5    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Power Button                              id=6    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Video Bus                                 id=7    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Power Button                              id=8    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ WebCam SC-13HDL11939N                     id=11   [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ AT Translated Set 2 keyboard              id=12   [slave  keyboard (3)]\n\n\nA: Seems to be fixed.

Then, in the beginning of the Ubuntu installation process, (using a DVD image disk), I created 4 new partitions for the linux system (/boot, /, /home, and swap space). Then I told the installer program to put the boot loader to /dev/sda5 (/boot partition), since I planned to use Windows loader to control the dual booting. \nThe rest of the installation seemed to have worked fine, I re-started the computer and got back to my Windows 7 system (which was expected, as I still had to set up the dual boot from Windows.)\nHowever, that's where I have a problem. According to the above-mentioned instructions, I should be able to use EasyBCD to set up dual boot configuration. However, EasyBCD DOESN'T FIND any BCD records in my system (not even the one for Windows 7). It suggests me to find the file manually, however how can I do it? I am also being cautious as not to damage my existing Windows installation, by randomly trying things I do not understand.\nThe error that EasyBCD throws in, reads as follows:\n\"The boot configuration data store could not be opened. The system cannot find the file specified.\nWould you like to manually load a BCD registry for EasyBCD to manage? Please note that EasyBCD requires the Windows Vista/7 bootloader, and will not work in XP-only environments\".\nI have checked a few related pages here, but none seems to contain exactly my case.\nAny help much appreciated! \nPS\nMaybe there is some other dual boot software, that I could use instead of EasyBCD?\n\nA: UPDATE:\nthe problem was solved by assigning a letter to the \"System\" partition in Windows 7 (using the Disk Management tool).\nAfter that, EasyBCD was able to detect the BCD record for Windows 7, and I could then add the record for Ubuntu.\n\nA: Actually any kind of messing with bootloader can do harm, even EasyBCD. Be warned!\nYou can try pointing EasyBCD manually to \"c:\\boot\\bcd\". How exactly? I don't know. I've never used this app.\nAnd you can also just use GRUB2. (That might be made harder by using a separate /boot partition.) Either use boot repair, as oldfred said or reinstall Ubuntu. While reinstalling, use either automatic partitioning or use just / and swap partitions. ( /home is optional, you may choose it too.) Auto/easy partitioning may be not available if installer detects complicated layout of partitions that you just created.\n", "Q: System can not return display after locking My Ubuntu 13.10 works great except for one issue.

I have a dual monitor setup and every time reboot the screens have switched places (left screen on right monitor and vice versa).\nI have correctly created an xorg.conf which is shown below.\nI have tried all the solutions which are suggested in theses two posts:\nnvidia-settings lost after reboot\nNvidia drivers seem to ignore customized xorg.conf in 13.10? How to configure?\nincluding checking for ~/.config/monitor.xml which I don't have. Loading the nvidia-setting at runtime using nvidia-settings -l which doesn't do anything. But that kinda makes sense to me since the .nvidia-setting-rc doesn't really have any info about screen positions. And since I'm running LXDE as my desktop environment \"Preferences->Monitor Settings\" is only concerned with screen resolution, not screen position.\nNow here is the odd thing: When lightdm loads up the screens are initially in the correct order (as specified in the xorg.conf) and then switch order after a couple of secounds.\nIn my Xorg.0.log I found the following line\n[    11.806] (II) NVIDIA(0): Setting mode \"DVI-I-0: nvidia-auto-select @1680x1050 +0+0, DVI-D-0: nvidia-auto-select @1680x1050 +1680+0\"\n\nwhich I believe could very well be the culprit. It seems as if the nvidia driver overrides the settings in xorg.conf after the fact even though I'm not starting nvidia-settings at startup as far as I know.\nEDIT:\nI just upgraded from nvidia-304 to nvidia-319 and now my suspicions a confirmed because the x-server boot log is now a little bit clearer. The relevant lines are:\n[     6.460] (**) NVIDIA(0): Option \"MetaModes\" \"CRT: nvidia-auto-select +1680+0, DFP: nvidia-auto-select +0+0\"\n\nOptions are correctly read from xorg.conf\n[     6.908] (II) NVIDIA(0): Setting mode \"CRT:nvidia-auto-select+1680+0,DFP:nvidia-auto-select+0+0\"\n\nand correctly set\n[    11.197] (II) NVIDIA(0): Setting mode \"DVI-I-0: nvidia-auto-select @1680x1050 +0+0 {ViewPortIn=1680x1050, ViewPortOut=1680x1050+0+0}, DVI-D-0: nvidia-auto-select @1680x1050 +0+0 {ViewPortIn=1680x1050, ViewPortOut=1680x1050+0+0}\"\n[    11.222] (II) NVIDIA(0): Setting mode \"DVI-I-0: nvidia-auto-select @1680x1050 +0+0 {ViewPortIn=1680x1050, ViewPortOut=1680x1050+0+0}, DVI-D-0: nvidia-auto-select @1680x1050 +1680+0 {ViewPortIn=1680x1050, ViewPortOut=1680x1050+0+0}\"\n\nand then later overridden by the nvidia driver for apparently no reason.\nAny ideas anybody?\nAny help would be much appreciated.\nxorg.conf\n\n# nvidia-settings: X configuration file generated by nvidia-settings\n# nvidia-settings:  version 304.88  (buildd@panlong)  Thu Jul 11 10:40:14 UTC 2013\n\nSection \"ServerLayout\"\n    Identifier     \"Default Layout\"\n    Screen      0  \"Screen0\" 0 0\n    InputDevice    \"Keyboard0\" \"CoreKeyboard\"\n    InputDevice    \"Mouse0\" \"CorePointer\"\n    Option         \"Xinerama\" \"0\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"InputDevice\"\n    # generated from default\n    Identifier     \"Keyboard0\"\n    Driver         \"kbd\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"InputDevice\"\n    # generated from default\n    Identifier     \"Mouse0\"\n    Driver         \"mouse\"\n    Option         \"Protocol\" \"auto\"\n    Option         \"Device\" \"/dev/psaux\"\n    Option         \"Emulate3Buttons\" \"no\"\n    Option         \"ZAxisMapping\" \"4 5\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Monitor\"\n    Identifier     \"Monitor0\"\n    VendorName     \"Unknown\"\n    ModelName      \"Samsung SyncMaster\"\n    HorizSync       30.0 - 81.0\n    VertRefresh     56.0 - 75.0\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier     \"Device0\"\n    Driver         \"nvidia\"\n    VendorName     \"NVIDIA Corporation\"\n    BoardName      \"GeForce GTX 650 Ti\"\n    Option         \"nvidiaXineramaInfoOrder\" \"DFP-1, CRT-0\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier     \"Screen0\"\n    Device         \"Device0\"\n    Monitor        \"Monitor0\"\n    DefaultDepth    24\n    Option         \"Stereo\" \"0\"\n    Option         \"nvidiaXineramaInfoOrder\" \"DFP-1, CRT-0\"\n    Option         \"metamodes\" \"CRT-0: nvidia-auto-select +1680+0, DFP-1: nvidia-auto-select +0+0\"\n    SubSection     \"Display\"\n        Depth       24\n    EndSubSection\nEndSection\n\nEDIT 2:\nWhat I found out is that the log message which signals the override of the xorg.conf settings is one that is caused by a call to xrandr (as I'm doing this myself from the commandline to set the screens in the correct order).\nBelow you'll find my x-server log file.

I tried setting left and right screens in nvidia-settings manager but when I rebooted or restarted X they would switch back.\nSearched a lot online, but couldn't find a solution, then I just went to the Displays options in Ubuntu System Settings or unity-control-center, set everything there, and voila, problem solved. \nSo the easiest thing to do is ignore nvidia-settings and use the displays option in the Ubuntu settings. At least in Ubuntu 14.04.\n\nA: I had the same problem in Ubuntu 14.04. It turned out that xorg.conf was overridden by unity-control-center displays settings which are stored in ~/.config/monitors.xml.\nEntering the desired settings into monitors.xml solved the issue for me.\n\n\n*\n\n*<primary>no</primary> or <primary>yes</primary>\n\n*<x>0</x> means left screen, <x>1280</x> right screen where 1280 is width of the screen on the left.\n\n\nA: I had a similar issue - not multi-monitor, but my settings were getting ignored like yours are. What I did to solve it was replace the nvidia-auto-select option with the actual resolution I wanted, i.e. 1280x1024_75 +0+0.\nSo you might try something like this:\nOption         \"metamodes\" \"CRT-0: 1680x1050_75 +1680+0, DFP-1: 1680x1050_75 +0+0\"\n\nAdditionally, I noticed that in the above line, the monitors are in the order \"CRT-0, DFP-1\", whereas earlier in your config file they're ordered \"DFP-1, CRT-0\". I don't know if that matters, but these flip-flops may also be causing your issue, so try setting everything in the same order.\nWhat I think was happening for me was that the nvidia x-server would load its preferred settings, then would be overridden by the settings manager. By removing the auto-select (and any other resolution options available in /etc/X11/xorg.conf) I think it disallows the use of other resolution settings.\n\nA: The issue seems to be, that lightdm resets the screens to an order it sees fit after the xorg.conf has been loaded. (I don't now why or how to suppress that and would find it helpful if some could shed some light on that.)\nSo to solve this issue the simple solution is to change the display manager. See here\nThe more complicated solution if you want to keep lightdm is to install arandr. Run it. Set your screens up like you want them and save the configuration. This will save a shell script which sets up your configuration whenever it is executed. So now you have to add the following line to /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf\nsession-setup-script=<location of the script you saved with arandr>\n\nThis will get you the correct monitor setup as soon as you enter you session.\n\nA: Had the same problem on 13.10 with Nvidia NVS 510 and 4 monitors.  Even though nvidia-settings were configured correctly and saved to xorg.conf after reboot rotation options were not remembered.\nThe solution was to open System Settings → Displays and configure the monitors again in the proper configuration.  Then click Apply.  I presume that this is what writes to ~/.config/monitors.xml.\nAfter that everything worked fine and persisted after reboot.\n\nA: There is actually an easier way of solving this.\nIn your user profile set the displays exactly how you want them.\nThen \ncopy ~/.config/monitors.xml to /var/lib/lightdm/.config\n\nThis will force lightdm to use the exact same setup as your user profile.\n\nA: I spent too much time with exactly the same issue: X loads correct settings, then, when I log in, settings are overwritten.\nAs I am on a fully encrypted single user machine (and therefore don't care about login), my option was to install\nnodm\n\nwhich replaces lightdm or other display managers. It has to be enabled and configured in \n/etc/default/nodm\n\nto load at startup and to autologin my user. Perfect solution with the awesome window-manager\n\nA: You probably need to run: \nsudo nvidia-xconfig\n\nSee: \n\n\n*\n\n*NVIDIA X Server Settings lost on every reboot\n\nA: For xfce4 users, it looks like the file ~/.config/xfce4/xfconf/xfce-perchannel-xml/displays.xml could have been modified for some reason. Deleting it solved my issue. It's not been generated again at logout/login so I don't know exactly what it is supposed to do. I also found that with other desktop environments there is a similar(?) ~/.config/monitors.xml file that you might try deleting/renaming.\nSource\n\nA: I had this problem with Ubuntu 19.04 and Nvidia drivers. 19.04 is now using GDM3 instead of LightDM by default.\nThe solution was:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use Ubuntu settings to configure screens.\n\n*sudo cp ~/.config/monitors.xml /var/lib/gdm3/.config/\n\n*sudo chown gdm:gdm /var/lib/gdm3/.config/monitors.xml\n", "Q: how to disable monitor sleep/blanking? Ubuntu server system (no X installed) that runs several networking daemons.

I've disabled the sleep option in the monitor's firmware - and, of course a key-press on the kb will awaken the screen...but not sleeping at all is optimal.\nthanks...\n\nA: did you try the answer to this thread:\nHow do I disable the blank console \"screensaver\" on Ubuntu Server?\nIn short it says  to add the parameter consoleblank=0 to your kernel command-line at boot-time.\nHope that helps.\n", "Q: Installed ubuntu on netbook but unity is too heavy, would i benefit from installing mir? I'm running on an atom netbook with 2gb ram. But the machines runs a lot cooler under win7 than under ubuntu. My first thought was because of unity putting to much load on the machine.\nAfter searching high and low yesterday, i came across mir, apparently that's the next thing for ubuntu.\nWould i benefit by installing it?\nHow would i install it?\nI know it's still in development, but would i be fine with a machine that's only used for school aka internet, mail & word processing?\n\nA: No. Don't do it.\nMir is a display server and it's used just for displaying stuff. Just like Wayland or X. (Yes, your system is using X right now.) \"Hey, X! Stuff on the screen has changed. Could you please redraw it?\"\nOn the other hand Unity is a desktop environment and it's responsible for the bar you see on top of the screen, the dock and menu you use to launch apps, etc. \"Hey, Unity! User has clicked the menu button! Please make the image of an open menu, so X can draw it on the screen.\"\nMir is supposed to be more efficient than X, but the version of Unity you use is not prepared for Mir. It would be specially treated. (Mir would pretend that it's the X.) That special treating would make everything slower than using X directly. And Mir is in development and that means bugs. You don't want bugs, trust me.\nAs for running hot... We're not wizards and we need more info about your netbook. Without it I can only guess. Perhaps the processor usage is high? (Check it in System Monitor app.) Or maybe your graphics drivers are not making optimal use of your graphic card? (What graphic card and drivers do you use?)\nSo what is your version of Ubuntu, what netbook model is it exactly?\n", "Q: Sound popup showing every minute in xubuntu I have the sound popup thingy displayed about every minute, even without changing any volume settings, or clicking/pressing anything.

Also verify what key combination you have to change the volumes, if you have set a more common key. If it's regular check the cron jobs using cron -e and any running script using ps ax | grep $USER\n\nA: If anything, I got it fixed by killing xfce-volumed with killall xfce-volumed.

Here is some more info:\nI was trying to format an sd card from the terminal and I accidentally may have formatted the partition which boots ubuntu. Now my computer goes directly to the BIOS settings and doesn't load the operating system. Under Boot tab in the Bios there is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch PXE OpROM  [Disabled]\n\n*Boot Option Priorities \n\n*Boot Option #1    [ubuntu (Drive not ....] \n\n*Boot Option #2     [ubuntu (Drive not ....]\n\n*Boot Option #3     [Windows Boot Manag....]\n\n\n(I had removed windows long time ago.)\nThis is how I tried to solve the problem so far:\nI created an ubuntu boot usb drive and was able to start the machine from the USB (luckily all the data was still there). I then tried installing ubuntu again alongside the old ubuntu. The installation completed successfully but the machine still won't boot without a USB drive.\nI then followed the instructions in the thread for CreateBootPartitionAfterInstall\nI tried running Boot-Repair but kept getting an error for a missing flag \"bios_grub\". So in gparted I changed the flag for my /dev/sda1 to bios_grub (it was \"boot\" before that - not sure if this was a right thing to do but couldn't run boot-repair without it). Here is what my partitions look like:\nhttp://eagle1.american.edu/~gp9804a/ubuntu_gparted.png\nI ran boot-repair successfully but still to no avail - machine still wont' boot without the usb drive.\nI then tried the advanced options in boot-repair and under the GRUB Location tab I checked \"Seperate /boot partition sda1\"\nThis also apparently went well and I received a successful boot-repair message at the end. The only problem there was that it couldn't run some updates on dev/sda6 and it instructed me to enable updates on the partition (which I have no idea how to do and thought that this was tangential to the main problem anyway). However, after restart I was back to the same problem - going straight to BIOS and still no boot. \nThe url from (the last) boot-repair is this:\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/6939109/\nI am now at a loss on what to do and how to get my machine back up. Any suggestions are greatly appreciated\n\nA: You've been digging yourself into a deeper and deeper hole. Fortunately, I think you can still recover. Both to warn off others and to help you learn, I want to point out a few of your mistakes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Re-installing Ubuntu because of a boot problem is almost always overkill at best, and runs the risk of destroying your user data at worst. You say that your data still exists, so you may have just wasted some time, but I want to point this out because it could have gone very badly, with lost user data to add to your boot problems.\n\n*Attempting to run Boot Repair from a BIOS-mode boot on a computer that was originally set up in EFI mode was a mistake. You probably didn't even realize you were making this mistake, but you did -- the fact that Boot Repair was complaining about the need for a partition with a \"bios_grub flag\" was a clue about this mistake. (This complaint from Boot Repair is clearly not very informative to anybody but experts, sadly.)\n\n*Changing the flag on /dev/sda1 from boot to bios_grub was a mistake. In parted and GParted terminology, the \"boot flag\" identifies an EFI System Partition (ESP), which is a partition that holds EFI boot loaders. A \"bios_grub flag,\" OTOH, identifies a BIOS Boot Partition, which holds second-stage GRUB boot loader code for BIOS/CSM/legacy-mode boots. When you re-installed GRUB in BIOS mode, it overwrote the first few sectors of /dev/sda1, thus damaging the data on the partition. It sounds like your problems began with accidentally trashing this partition, so you probably didn't really do any more damage (except possibly to your /etc/fstab file), but this was definitely the wrong approach to take. If your problem had had a different cause, this mistake would have made recovery even more difficult.\n\n*Telling Boot Repair to treat /dev/sda1 as a separate /boot partition was also a mistake. You ended up telling it to treat that partition as two mutually exclusive things: as a separate /boot partition and as a BIOS Boot Partition. This could have messed things up even further, but it looks like it didn't really have much of an effect.\n\n\nAs further background on EFI booting, you may want to read my Web page on the subject, the Ubuntu community wiki on EFI booting, and/or Adam Williamson's blog explaining EFI issues. All three of these pages provide background information that may help you deal with this type of problem in the future.\nAs to the solution: There are several approaches, but I recommend you begin by fixing some of the problems that must be dealt with for any solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot a Linux emergency disc.\n\n*Use GParted or parted to change the \"flag\" on /dev/sda1 to boot. Alternatively, use gdisk to change the type code on this partition to EF00.\n\n*Create a fresh FAT32 filesystem on /dev/sda1. You can do this with GParted or by using the command-line mkdosfs or mkfs utility.\n\n*Mount /dev/sda6 and edit the /etc/fstab file on it. You must add an entry to this file to mount /dev/sda1 at /boot/efi. It should look like this:\n\n\n.\n/dev/sda1      /boot/efi   vfat        fmask=133       0 0\n\nAlternatively (and preferably, in some ways), you can change /dev/sda1 at the start of that line to UUID=\"XXXX-XXXX\", where XXXX-XXXX is the \"UUID\" (really a serial number) value for the partition, as reported by blkid. This value will only be valid after you've created a fresh FAT filesystem on the partition, so it's unknowable as I write this answer.\nOnce you've made these changes, you must install a fresh EFI-mode boot loader. Several choices are available. The two that are likely to be easiest to install are:\n\n\n*\n\n*rEFInd -- You can install rEFInd by booting into Linux using whatever method works, verifying that /boot/efi is mounted, and installing the Debian package, available from the rEFInd downloads page.\n\n*GRUB 2 via Boot Repair -- The Boot Repair tool should re-install GRUB; however, you must run the program when booted in EFI mode. Check for the presence of a directory called /sys/firmware/efi. If it's present, you've booted in EFI mode and you can run Boot Repair. If it's not present, you've probably booted in BIOS mode and Boot Repair will be useless at best. If you've booted in BIOS mode, go into your firmware setup utility and disable BIOS/CSM/legacy support; or use your firmware's built-in boot manager to select a boot option that includes the string \"EFI\" or \"UEFI.\" Unfortunately, I can't be more specific because firmware setup utility and firmware boot manager details vary so much from one computer to another.\n\n\nIt might be necessary to wipe the BIOS-mode GRUB code from the first sector of your hard disk. If you complete the repair and still can't boot from the hard disk, try booting to Linux and typing the following command in a Terminal:\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=440 count=1\n\nBe very careful when typing that command; a slip-up, especially if you omit or specify the wrong value for bs= or count=, can do serious damage to your disk. That's why I didn't include this in the main recovery procedure.\nGood luck!\n\nA: Judging from the screenshot, your boot partition seems unreadable. Try opening a live session and reformatting /dev/sda1, then running sudo grub-install /dev/sda, then sudo update-grub. That will reinstall your bootloader and should get you past the hang at boot.\n", "Q: Everytime after updating system, i have to reinstall NVIDIA driver to get my unity work properly Every time after updating system, i have to reinstall NVIDIA driver to get my unity work properly.\nEvery time i update my system, after restarting top panel and side bar goes missing and graphics acceleration gets disabled, and to fix this i have to reinstall the nvidia driver.

But I would like to backup the real important data (like all my files, which are in @home, but not hidden directories because I am not interested in backing up .cache and other stuff which changes often, because this would lead to much waste of space in my incremental backup solution. \nCould I somehow achieve it, that my real data are a subvolume in home without creating a directory in home which contains all data and is a own subvolume, or is this impossible by design? \nMy backup method is similar to: https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Incremental_Backup\n\nA: Dot-files have no special meaning to the filesystem, and btrfs send cannot currently (Feb 2014) exclude files or directories from the target subvolume.\nHowever, btrfs subvolume snapshot does exclude subvolumes which are contained in the target subvolume (it creates empty directories in the snapshot), so\n\n\n*\n\n*You may replace the directories that you want to exclude with subvolumes.\n\n\nrsync, or a graphical frontend such as grsync, can exclude files and directories and allows for incremental backups.\nIf you give the parameter --inplace to rsync, it only overwrites the different portions in the files that have changed, rather than rewriting the entire contents of the files. This is an incremental backup, by definition, and saves space on btrfs.\nInstructions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup @home the first time with btrfs send/receive.To do further backups: create a snapshot of the backup of @home, then run rsync to copy the current home over the newly-created snapshot, and remember to give rsync the parameter --inplace.\n\n\nrsync allows for extensive customization of the backup process, you can read the list of parameters by running man rsync on the terminal.\nFor completeness, I'll add another approach, which is not useful once you know how to use rsync: deduplicate after a \"normal\" copy (rsync or cp or whatever else).\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the files normally, then deduplicate with bedup. (A new bedup branch was introduced that supports kernel 3.12, but it is not applicable on Ubuntu at the time of writing, because not even Ubuntu 13.10 has such a recent kernel). This is not necessary if you pass --inplace to rsync, as suggested above.\n\n\nSpeaking of back-ups: Remember that btrfs is experimental and so is bedup.\n\nA: No, you can't do that. At least not directly. \nSnapshots work like fancy directories, which implies that all files beneath it are included. \nYou can still do all kinds of fancy stuff with symlinks, or mount --binds. \nWhy are you so much concerned with the temporary files? For all practical purposes they are really small, and usually saved on /tmp anyway (save for few well known applications like Firefox or GoogleEarth). If I were you I'd reconfigure these few applications to keep the data on other places, or - if that fails - I'd symlink the cache directories to somewhere else, outside /home/user. There are tools, that can manage such elaborate network of symlinks on all your computers in consistent way (e.g. Puppet).\n\nKeep in mind, that this kind of backup is only half of what you'd need to have for a real protection for your data. Normally people configure the backup program to cherry-pick files/folders they care about and store the backups on the external server. And it is a central server, where all the snapshot-related magic with data takes place, not client.\nPersonally I use unison to sync my data with a btrfs subvolume on the central server. After each synchronization round of all my computers, I use SnapBtr script\nto do the snapshot. \n", "Q: Having some trouble with my nVidia driver on kubuntu 13.10 I wanted to try out Linux again so I downloaded 13.10. I installed on my laptop which is a Dell XPS with two types of video cards, integrated Intel and a nVidia GTX555m. The way this laptop runs in Win 7 seems pretty straight forward. I install drivers for both cards. The intel card runs for most normal tasks, websurfing etc, but when I fire up a game or connect a 2nd monitor via HDMI then the nVidia card takes over and does the heavy lifting.\nMy problem is that in Ubuntu the intel drivers appear to be working normally but I cant seem to get the nVidia drivers to work/take over. When I launch Additional Drivers I see nVidia_331 as activated but not in use. In an effort to test the drivers I connected a 2nd monitor via HDMI but cant get the system to recognize it.

For example, could I download this video using this extension, in the lowest possible quality to save bandwidth, and then convert it to HD using ffmpeg or whatever? \nI don't think that downloaders are capable of converting videos; they just change the extension of the file to reduce its size a bit.

So, in order to save your configuration you simply have to open a terminal and type this command:\nsudo jscal-store /dev/input/js0\n\n/dev/input/js0 is my joystick, but yours may be different\nAfter running this command, when plugging in your joystick/joypad js-restore will automatically run thanks to the udev rules which will automatically restore the joystick profile made with jstest-gtk and saved with js-store into the file /var/lib/joystick/joystick.state.\nSee also: jscal manpage\n\nA: For my version of jscal, the command to save was actually:\nsudo jscal-store /dev/input/js0\n\nBut thanks Githlar; you got me on the right track.\nI got the command from the manpage\n", "Q: How should one lock Wine apps to the Unity launcher?

It's the same series I think but I've seen no explicit reference to 4352 or 43xx (implying it's applicable for all 43xx series).\nCanonical claims support for this card over here and when I booted into the live install CD it worked after enabling the driver in software-properties. Admittingly I didn't use it enough to see if the connection was flaky. Instead I booted into a server install USB and I'm now attempting to configure it post install.\nMy current procedure is to run this script, which is built from snippets I've been reading about at various locations.\nCONFFILE=/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf\nCONF=$(cat <<CONFEND\nctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=wireless\nupdate_config=1\n\nENDCONF\n)\n\necho \"$CONF\" | sudo tee $CONFFILE > /dev/null\nwpa_passphrase \"\" \"\" | sudo tee -a $CONFFILE > /dev/null\n\nsudo kill-all wpa_supplicant\nsudo wpa_supplicant -B -Dwext -ieth0 -c$CONFFILE\nsudo dhclient eth0\n\nNow sometimes this runs in about 15 seconds, emits two errors (ioctl[SIOCSIWENCODEEXT]: Invalid argument), but works fine.

I try to run the wpa_supplicant and dhclient lines by themselves and each take ages and report no useful errors.

What happens to XP if I do download? Yes, my questions may be simple to some, but I'm just a little unsure of how all this works.\n\nA: As to your first question, I would recommend that you install Lubuntu (instead of Ubuntu) on your 10-year old computer. Lubuntu is a variant of Ubuntu which is more lightweight and faster.\nRelated: What are the minimum system requirements for Lubuntu?\nYou can find more information about Lubuntu & download it here: http://lubuntu.net\nAs to your second question, it is possible to install Lubuntu AND Windows XP on your computer, and you can choose which one to boot each time your restart your computer. (That is provided you have enough available disk space to install both operating systems.) So, nothing happens to your Windows.\nBut the best thing is, you will also be able to try Lubuntu, without installing anything on your computer, before you actually do decide to install it. All you need to do is create a bootable USB drive or CD with Lubuntu, and boot your PC from it. Start from http://lubuntu.net, and if you have any more questions, do not hesitate to post them here.\n", "Q: Ancestry software availability Is there an application dealing with ancestry on Ubuntu?\nWine will not co-operate with Family Tree Maker.\nIf someone can point me in the right direction, I will be able to give Windows the \ncomplete \"Heave-Ho\".\n\nA: Native clients\nGRAMPS Genealogical Research and Analysis Management Program\nsudo apt-get install gramps\n\n\nLifeLines  Console based genealogy software to help with family history research\nsudo apt-get install lifelines\n\nWeb\nPhpGedView Web-based genealogy viewer and editor.

After trying the system a few times, (no issues except performance), I rebooted and selected Install, replacing the current system.  At the end of the install, I was instructed to reboot.  Since the USB drive was still plugged in, I was surprised not to see an instruction to remove it, so as not to just boot from that drive again.  There was no such instruction, so I just pulled out the drive.  The screen went blank and the system was totally unresponsive.\nI forced power down and then back up.  Ubuntu (now from the hard drive) came up and seems OK, except for an issue with saving settings (which I will document separately).\nWas this the correct procedure and is the blank screen result as expected?\n\nA: You are good to go.

Why am I getting this error and how can I fix it?\n\nA: According to this bug report, installing the latest DEB for this package (the Khmer OS font) from here also solves the issue. Looks like the bug was resolved for Trusty, but was never backported to the Saucy repository.\nBroadly speaking, the \"error message\" is just a symptom while actual functionality that breaks/misbehaves is the root cause. By uninstalling the package, we are fixing the symptom while getting rid of the functionality itself.\n\nA: It is a bug in Khmer fonts, see https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/fonts-khmeros/+bug/1254967. \nIf it bothers you and you do not need Khmer fonts, you can get rid of it removing (with configuration) the fonts: \napt-get purge  fonts-khmeros-core\n\nIf you need the fonts, there are various workarounds in the aforementioned bug. The most correct way seems to edit the failing file and remove the <match> and </match> tags, as explained here: http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.linux.debian.devel.bugs.general/1095401\n", "Q: Screencast with avconv cuts off last 5 seconds of audio I'm trying to record a screencast using avconv (installed from official repo).

Video is OK until the end. Any hint about what can I do to fix it?\nMy system is Ubuntu 12.04.4 LTS 64 bits, all up to date.\n\nA: I assume that you are ending the recording by pressing Ctrl+C in the terminal. This ends the program without letting it finish what it has started. What that means is that some of the audio just hasn't been processed yet. The issue is with the processor time, you have a lot of load going on with video conversion on the fly, and thus audio gets buffered and then processed quickly as a batch of some seconds. When you terminate the program, there is always some audio left in the buffer that hasn't been processed yet.\nOne simply approach would be to just wait a little bit before terminating the recording.\nIf you are open to using other software, you can also use RecordMyDesktop, which generates Ogg+Theora videos and works quite nicely on my system.\n", "Q: Caps Locks light not showing I've installed Ubuntu on my MBP but when I press caps lock the green light on the caps lock button will not show.

However, my process (Job A) relies on another process (Job B) during its graceful shutdown, so I now want to make sure that Job B doesn't stop until Job A has stopped.\nBoth processes are Upstart jobs, so I've tried doing this by adding this to Job B's /etc/init file:\n# Don't stop until job A stops\npre-stop script\n    while true\n    do\n        status A | grep -q \"stop/waiting\" && exit 0\n        sleep 1\n    done\nend script\n\nThis doesn't seem to work; when I shutdown my server via ACPI shutdown, job B usually shuts down before job A, such that job A spits out error messages about job B not being up.\nIs there something wrong with my script? Is there another approach I should be taking? Or is it not possible to do what I want with Upstart?\nRelated question: How do I stop a job before its dependencies?\n\nA: You can use these options within job A:\n\n\n*\n\n*Stop before depended-upon service\nstop on stopping B\n\n\n*Start after depended-upon service\nstart on started B\n\nReference: http://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/#stop-on\n", "Q: will unity 3d on older computers work with 13.10 Basically, i have an older computer which is why i put ubuntu on for its speed. At first i had 12.04 that ran ubuntu 2D because 3D was very slow on the Nvidia GeForce 5200 card in it. when i updated to 12.10 unity 2D was discontinued and because it was forcing my computer to run Unity 3D the desktop kept crashing leaving me to use Gnome desktop.\nive seen that 13.10 has improvements and what not, but if i update to it, will the 3D for me still crash or was it optimized for better performance? if it isnt, then i wont bother updating from 12.10.\n\nA: Give an try for 13.10, if it works, fine.If it doesn't, you may stick to 12.10 for some time.Ubuntu Gnome is an continuation of the old look that people love.You may want to try it.You can always go with xubuntu or lubuntu or kubuntu which are better for low spec hardware.\nBTW you will not be able(or recommended) to stick with 12.10 much longer as it EOL's in Apr 2014(that's also the time when 14.04 LTS will be launched).\nSo in short, you have following options.\n\n\n*\n\n*Stick with Ubuntu 12.10 and jump to Ubuntu 14.04 quickly via 13.10.See if it(14.04) works.\n\n*Try out Ubuntu 13.10, See if it works.\n\n*Get yourself transfered to Gnome or others.\n\n\n\nWe don't have not yet evolved forecasting powers.You will only have to try 13.10 to check if it works the way you want.Good Luck!!!\n\n", "Q: Installing GCC 3.2 : How to resolve error \"lvalue required as increment operand\"? I am using Ubuntu 10.04 and the current version of GCC installed in my system is 4.4.\nFor some specific need I want to install GCC 3.2.\nI began with these steps:\n$mkdir gcc-build\n$cd gcc-build\n$tar zxvf gcc-3.2.tar.gz\n$mkdir -p gcc-bin\n$mkdir -p usr/local\n$cd gcc-bin\n$../gcc-build/gcc-3.2/configure --prefix=../gcc-build/usr/local\n\nIt has configured successfully. But when I used below command \n$make bootstrap\n\nI got an error\n../gcc-build/gcc-3.2/gcc/read-rtl.c:653: error: lvalue required as increment operand\nmake[1]: *** [read-rtl.o] Error 1\nmake[1]: Leaving directory `../gcc-build/gcc-bin/gcc'\nmake: *** [all-gcc] Error 2\n\nAnybody please help me to resolve this error. Or please suggest some alternative ways. Thanks.\n\nA: Here is an incredibly hacky fix to work around the loss of cast-as-lvalue, based on a suggestion of SM Ryan in comp.lang.c.\nNear the top of the file, add\n#define LV(type,lvalue) (*((type*)((void*)(&lvalue))))\n\nNow, replace the casts with LV(...) as in these examples (from gdb's obstack.h):\nOn line 428, change\n*((void **)__o->next_free)++ = ((void *)datum);\n\nto\n*(LV(void**, __o->next_free))++ = ((void *)datum);\n\nand likewise, on line 436 change\n*((int *)__o->next_free)++ = ((int)datum);      \n\nto\n*(LV(int*, __o->next_free))++ = ((int)datum);\n\nGood luck.\n\nA: After few trials, I found one solution.\nI added below mirrors in /etc/apt/sources.list\ndeb http://snapshot.debian.org/archive/debian/20070730T000000Z/ lenny main\ndeb-src http://snapshot.debian.org/archive/debian/20070730T000000Z/ lenny main\ndeb http://snapshot.debian.org/archive/debian-security/20070730T000000Z/ lenny/updates main\ndeb-src http://snapshot.debian.org/archive/debian-security/20070730T000000Z/ lenny/updates main\n\nWith these mirrors, I am able to install GCC 3.3(though not GCC 3.2) using\n$sudo apt-get install g++-3.3   \n\nDon't forget to do $sudo apt-get update before above command.\nIt is in fact satisfying my need. \nAnd to run the program using GCC 3.3, do\n$gcc-3.3 input_file\nBecause otherwise if you type $gcc input_file it will use the default GCC(GCC 4.4 in my case) to compile the program.\nWe can change the way desired version is used by simply creating a hard link of the version you want to tag to command gcc. We can do the following\n$cd /usr/bin\n$sudo ln gcc-3.3 gcc\n\nSo now whenever you type $gcc input_file it will use your desired gcc version to compile the program.\n\nA: Once I faced a similar problem. I had this module 'r8169' which wasn't receiving packets from my wired connection. Then I had to build the previous module 'r8168' from source. This gave me similar errors like yours.\nA possible fix is by going into superuser mode. Type\nsudo su\n\nThen type your password. The console will show you '#' instead of '$' for writing commands. Then try your commands again.\n#mkdir gcc-build\n#cd gcc-build\n#tar zxvf gcc-3.2.tar.gz\n#mkdir -p gcc-bin\n#mkdir -p usr/local\n#cd gcc-bin\n#../gcc-build/gcc-3.2/configure --prefix=../gcc-build/usr/local\n# make bootstrap\n\n(and any other commands, if left).\nHopefully, it should work.\n", "Q: Drag text from terminal?

I need a way to modulate my voice on-the-fly (to lower or raise pitch, etc, for privacy) for use in Mumble, TeamSpeak and other such programs. Is there any way to do this under Linux/Ubuntu?\nI have found a couple possible programs under Windows, and if necessary I could run Mumble, TeamSpeak, etc. under VirtualBox/Wine along with a modulator, but I would far prefer to use Linux, although I have not been able to find any native programs for Linux that can do this during my quick Google search.\n\nA: You might want to check this out, its a java program that runs under linux and windows that does what you want. \nhttp://www.pitchtech.ch/PitchBox/\n\nA: *\n\n*Install some necessary software:\nsudo apt-get install sox libsox-fmt-pulse pavucontrol\n\n\n*Make a null-sink in pulseaudio:\npactl load-module module-null-sink\n\n\n*Start sox recording from the default recording device (default source) and outputing to the the null-sink:\nsox -t pulseaudio default -t pulseaudio null pitch -800\n\n(If you don't want to record from the default source, change the above command accordingly.) The -800 in the above command is the desired pitch change, you can modify that value as you want, e.g. -300, +200, +500, etc. . sox also have some other \"effects\" other than pitch changing which can be applied to the audio, you may want to check those out in man sox.\n\n*Start your capturing program (Skype, Teamspeak, etc.).\n\n*Start pavucontrol.\n\n*While you capturing program is trying to capture it will show up in pavucontrol under the Recording tab. Change its recording source from the default to Monitor of Null Output.\n\n\n*Check the results, it should be working.\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can make pulseaudio load the null-sink automatically, if you edit the /etc/pulse/default.pa file and add the following line to the end of that file:\nload-module module-null-sink\n\n\n*The changes you make in pavucontrol will be remembered, so the next time you start you capturing program it will automatically try to record from the null-sink. If this is not OK for you, then just change back the source to the default in pavucontrol when you need.\n\n*If you prefer the terminal way: You can set the recording source for your capture program in the terminal (without using pavucontrol), if you launch your program with the PULSE_SOURCE variable set correctly. E.g. to launch skype recording from the monitor source of the null sink:\nPULSE_SOURCE=null.monitor skype\n\n\n*Changing the pitch of your voice doesn't give you very good privacy:\n\n\n*\n\n*If the other end knows you, knows you real voice, then you will have to alter the pitch a lot, so it will be obvious for the other end that you altered your sound. If he wants, he can capture your altered voice and change back the pitch. Or the other end may just ignore/reject your call for obvious reasons.\n\n*If the other end doesn't know your real voice, well... In this case there is no real benefit from altering your voice, since they don't even know the real one. \n\n*If you are trying to protect against someone intercepting your voice, a man-in-the-middle attack, etc. , then it is very likely that those malicious guys know quite enough to recover your real sound from almost any modification you do on it with such simple softwares.\n\n*Also, for all the above cases: When you speak, it is not just the sound of your voice what can identify you, but the way you speak, your accent, the words and phrases you use, etc.\n\n*If you want a more secure way for voice communication, you may want to use a text-to-speech engine to turn your typing into voice. That is a much more secure way. (Of course this might not be a possibility if it is not possible to type your messages, e.g. in a multiplayer game.)\n\n\n\nNevertheless, this method gives better privacy then no privacy at all. And it can be also fun to fool some friends with an altered voice.\n\nA: I have also been looking for a similar application. I think I have found a possible answer: LV2 and its VocProc plugin \nI found this through this Ubuntu Forums thread, which may also be of use to you.\nThere are also plugins for Teamspeak to allow you to edit your voice. There may be other plugins for mumble also I will continue looking.\n", "Q: Setting JAVA_HOME How do I set JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm ...E ?

If one downloads videos from YouTube using youtube-dl, they get .mp4 files which are a ISO Media, MPEG v4 system, version 2.\nCan these files be converted to audio-only, ideally with no quality loss?\nThe goal is to save space by throwing out the unneeded visual part.\n\nA: You can convert existing downloaded files using ffmpeg from the command-line\nffmpeg -i \"input file.mp4\" -acodec copy \"output file.aac\"\n\nThe \"acodec copy\" part is the bit that doesn't change the audio stream.\n\nA: \nYouTube Center is excellent user script, which works accross browsers, doesn't involve bloating your OS with ton of Youtube downloaders unless you're a strictly 320 kbps person for your audio files.

Initially you need to connect your pc/laptop with \"cable\" and it automatically detect your internet connection.\nOpen \"Additional Driver\" option , it will search the drivers that are required for your PC and Card to support.\nAfter that a list of driver being show, here you can select the driver according to you manufacturing company and Broadcom STA wireless Driver work fine with all cards.\nyou can update the drivers then restart the pc, unplug the cable and now you can search your wifi and give password for connection.\nYou can find the package -\nsudo lspci\nsudo dpkg --get-selections \n\n", "Q: Sharp network scanner tool? I could not find anything about sharp network scanner tool. Is there any way my sharp machine scanner work with Ubuntu?\n\nA: you probably need nmap\n  Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network exploration\n       and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks,\n       although it works fine against single hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets\n       in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network,\n       what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering,\n       what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of\n       packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other\n       characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits, many\n       systems and network administrators find it useful for routine tasks\n       such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and\n       monitoring host or service uptime.\n\ncheck the manpage for the nmap command \nHere a list of network tools that could you be interested in:\n1) Wireshark -- network traffic analyzer\n2) Nessus -- Remote network security auditor\n3) Nmap -- The Network Mapper\n4) Etherape -- graphical network monitor modeled after etherman\n5) Kismet -- Wireless 802.11b monitoring tool\n6) Chkrootkit -- Checks for signs of rootkits on the local system\n7) Rkhunter -- rootkit, backdoor, sniffer and exploit scanner\n8) tiger -- Report system security vulnerabilities\nand much more security tools here\n", "Q: SSH key exchange \"knowledge\" problem This question may sound a duplicate, but I am confident it is not. \nI'm playing around a VM with Ubuntu 12.0.4LTS to learn something and my Mac OS 10.9, establishing an SSH connection as per my title. Both the VM (guest) and my local computer (host) have the SSH keys in place. In theory a key was required only for the host, because no reverse connections to the guest are required (but that's a different story).\nHowever - and that's the problem - while trying to SSH to the guest, the host returns always a permission denied message even though the fingerprint have been transmitted.\nThe authenticity of host 'test.me (172.90.90.91)' can't be established.\nRSA key fingerprint is bf:95:70:b1:20:69:b3:e6:a4:2e:58:4b:7e:fc:d9:71.\nAre you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes\n\nI know this is due to the host key not being included in the authorized-keys file of my guest (Ubuntu). In fact by manually adding the key everything went fine. \nBut that's the weird thing. From the host I was able to ssh connect to my guest, and once asked the same fingerprint message above, the connection was established without problems. \nSo that's the question. Why my guest (ubuntu) was able to add the fingerprint and connect to the host (Mac) without problems and not vice versa? Is this a problem / setting in the openSSH config of the server? If so, what is this option?\nIs the VM (Mac) setting too insecure to accept every SSH fingerprint?\nIs this somewhat connected to the PasswordAuthentication setting of the server? And would you recommend to add this to the Mac too?\nThanks\nAndrea\n\nA: This have nothing to do with authorized-keys. It's related to known-hosts file. Check if that file exists and have the rigth permissions <-rw-------> you you. Folder <~/.ssh> should be owned by you too.\nI case file exists and has right permissions, look at the IP address. For example if you connect to unknown host (10.0.0.1), you'll get:\n\nThe authenticity of host '10.0.0.1' can't be\n  established. RSA key fingerprint is\n  bf:95:70:b1:20:69:b3:e6:a4:2e:58:4b:7e:fc:d9:71.

You can't get that message unless the computer is booting in EFI mode. It's possible that the documentation doesn't mention it, or the support may have been added in a firmware update after the documentation was written, but you've clearly got an EFI in the computer.\nThat said, your partition table data also clearly indicates that you've got a BIOS/CSM/legacy-mode installation of Windows, and the best way to get Linux to coexist with that is to boot Linux in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode. Chances are you can do this by using your firmware's built-in boot manager to select the boot option for your boot medium that does not include the string \"EFI\" or \"UEFI.\" (You can usually access the boot manager by hitting Esc or a function key very early in the boot process. Unfortunately, which key varies from one computer to another.) On an EFI-based computer, you'll often see two options for removable medium, one with the string \"EFI\" or \"UEFI\" and the other without; just select the one without that string to boot in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode.\nIf that doesn't work, try mounting your USB installer and removing the entire EFI directory tree from it. (This is theoretically possible if you're using a CD-R or DVD-R, but it's much harder because you'd need to remaster it.)

The problem is I don't know how those paths were looking before. I've tried to replace \"/usr/share/racket/\" prefix to \"/usr/share/app-install/icons/\" because I've found this folder has related icons, but this doesn't work until I explicitly specify icon's extension so I can't just write some simple replace script here (icon extensions vary from app to app: in some cases there is \"/usr/share/app-install/icons/app.svg\", in other \"/usr/share/app-install/icons/another-app.png\").\n\nA: You can just change icon path to application name. Try this:\nfor file in /usr/share/applications/*.desktop; do\n    grep 'Icon=/usr/share/racket/' \"$file\" /dev/null\n    sed -i 's:^Icon=/usr/share/racket/:Icon=:' \"$file\"\ndone\n\nSave it as a script ('script.sh') and run it as root ('sudo sh script.sh').\nIt will fix all files which need changing.\n", "Q: How to install livewallpaper on ubuntu saucy 13.10?

The longer the server has been running for, the better the advice mysqltuner can provide. In a production environment, consider waiting for at least 24 hours before running the tool. You can get install mysqltuner from the Ubuntu repositories:\nsudo apt-get install mysqltuner\n\nThen once its been installed, run it:\n mysqltuner\n\nand wait for its final report. The top section provides general information about the database server, and the bottom section provides tuning suggestions to alter in your my.cnf. Most of these can be altered live on the server without restarting, look through the official MySQL documentation (link in Resources section) for the relevant variables to change in production. The following is part of an example report from a production database which shows there may be some benefit from increasing the amount of query cache:\n\n\n-------- Recommendations -----------------------------------------------------\nGeneral recommendations:\n    Run OPTIMIZE TABLE to defragment tables for better performance\n    Increase table_cache gradually to avoid file descriptor limits\nVariables to adjust:\n    key_buffer_size (> 1.4G)\n    query_cache_size (> 32M)\n    table_cache (> 64)\n    innodb_buffer_pool_size (>= 22G)\n\n\nOne final comment on tuning databases: Whilst we can broadly say that certain settings are the best, performance can vary from application to application. For example, what works best for Wordpress might not be the best for Drupal, Joomla or proprietary applications. Performance is dependent on the types of queries, use of indexes, how efficient the database design is and so on. You may find it useful to spend some time searching for database tuning tips based on what applications you're using it for. Once you get past a certain point any adjustments you make will only result in minor improvements, and you'll be better off either improving the application, or looking at scaling up your database environment through either using more powerful hardware or by adding slave servers.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Watch the performance metrics section of the mysqltuner report. Keep maximum possible memory under 50%.\n\n*tmp_table_size, max_heap_table_size variable: keep these equal and high.\n\n*join_buffer_size, increase in small amounts; it will be multiplied by max_connections.\n\n*innodb_buffer_pool_size. Make it high.\n\n\nA: another possibly fix is to use the following in [mysqld] section of your /etc/mysql/my.cnf configuration.\nperformance_schema = off\n\nSource: https://serverfault.com/questions/564748/mysql-mariadb-crashes-frequently\n\nA: Resolution for docker compose\nmysql:\n    volumes:\n        - ./config/mysql/my.cnf:/etc/mysql/conf.d/my.cnf\n\nConfig content ./config/mysql/my.cnf\n[mysqld]\nperformance_schema = off\n\n", "Q: Is there any software exactly like Adobe Dreamweaver that works with Ubuntu? I want to know that is there any web development tool exactly like Adobe Dreamweaver? If your answer is yes, please suggest me it and If it is no, please help me to develop it. and that should only work with Ubuntu and Linux Platform.\n\nA: Brackets is an open-source code editor for web design and development built on top of web technologies such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript, available for Linux, Windows and Mac OS X.\nThe application was originally created by Adobe, but is now maintained by the community.\n\nBrackets comes with some very interesting features, like a quick edit mode (Ctrl +e) that brings the relevant CSS for the selected tag in the main editor or live browser previews - the changes are pushed instantly to the browser (Chrome only), without having to save the changes or reload the page (see video below).\nFurthermore, Brackets supports extensions for adding extra functionality - more than 100 extensions (as of november 2013) can easily be installed through the built-in Extension Manager:\n\nBrackets for Linux was released back in August and while the Linux builds are practically at feature parity with the the Mac and Windows builds, there are some known issues. For instance, Brackets doesn't currently use native OS menus so under Unity, the menu isn't displayed on the top panel. There's also an issue that occurs when closing the application: you must click the close button twice to get the application to quit. More info about the Linux version, HERE.\nBelow you'll find an introduction video for Brackets (the video is old, but it should be enough to get an idea on what Brackets can do and why it's different from other code editors):\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvo3Mv1Z4qU (direct video link).\nEven though there are deb packages available for download on its website, users must manually download and install each update, and Brackets is updated quite often, usually every 2½ weeks. For this reason, WebUpd8Team have created a Brackets Ubuntu PPA which makes it easily to stay up to date with the latest Brackets Linux builds in Ubuntu and derivatives.\n\nInstall Brackets in Ubuntu via PPA\nTo add the Brackets PPA and install the application in Ubuntu (and derivatives), use the following commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/brackets\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install brackets\n\nSource : WebUpd8.org\n", "Q: SELinux enforcing mode problem I install selinux-basics and selinux-policy-default in ubuntu server 13.04, but when i set selinux in enforcing mode and reboot, my system doesn't boot up and I get following error:\nmountall: mount /run/lock [424] terminated with status 32\nmountall: Filesystem could not be mounted: /run/lock\nmountall: mount /run/shm [426] terminated with status 32\nmountall: Filesystem could not be mounted: /run/shm\nmountall: mount /run/usr [427] terminated with status 32\nmountall: Filesystem could not be mounted: /run/usr\n\nAn error occured while mounting /run/lock\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Right click your ubuntu-*.iso > Open with Disk Image writer\n\n*Choose your usb drive and click Start Restoring... and follow the instruction.\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Press shift on boot up\n\n*Select advanced options\n\n*Select the latest image with a \"(recovery mode) \" then select \"root\" put this command: setenforce=0 then put exit then resume without rebooting then login go to /etc/selinux but, open terminal first then navigate to etc then chmod a+rwx selinux then edit conf file then disable it then press save and reboot.

I want to use xbindkeys to set a key combination to increase/decrease the volume, but to do that I need a command to run to change the volume, without having to click the volume icon and change it with the mouse. How can I do this?\n\nA: You can use qdbus to access the graphical kmix from the command line. These are the commands to increase and decrease the volume:\nqdbus org.kde.kmix /kmix/KMixWindow/actions/increase_volume com.trolltech.Qt.QAction.trigger\n\nqdbus org.kde.kmix /kmix/KMixWindow/actions/decrease_volume com.trolltech.Qt.QAction.trigger\n\nfor reference, man qdbus  shows the syntax is qdbus <service> <path> <method> <args>, and you can see a list of available options at each stage by running a shorter command - e.g, running qdbus org.kde.kmix will show a list of available paths, and qdbus org.kde.kmix /kmix/KMixWindow/actions/decrease_volume will show a list of available methods for that path, etc. Note that the methods marked as being read or readwrite can be called with no argument to get their current value - this may be useful to you for automation.\nAlternatively, you can access the volume control directly - i.e. not via the graphical kmixer - with the /Mixers option.\nJust call qdbus org.kde.kmix /Mixers org.kde.KMix.MixSet.currentMasterControl to find out the current master control (in my case, alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo). Then use the mixer matching that name, i.e. /Mixers/0/alsa_output_pci_0000_00_1b_0_analog_stereo, with the method org.kde.KMix.Control.increaseVolume or org.kde.KMix.Control.decreaseVolume.\nSo, the direct access to the volume control will be something like this:\nqdbus org.kde.kmix /Mixers/0/alsa_output_pci_0000_00_1b_0_analog_stereo org.kde.KMix.Control.increaseVolume\n\nqdbus org.kde.kmix /Mixers/0/alsa_output_pci_0000_00_1b_0_analog_stereo org.kde.KMix.Control.decreaseVolume\n\nWhich will change the volume, without doing anything graphical.\n", "Q: Easy to use and easy to install app needed as a replacement of Autocad LT In our office we use Windows 8.1 mostly and some 7. W7s are OK but 8.1s are not yet bought. Let's say we are \"trying\" them. \nI have convinced the buying department to use Ubuntu since they are only using basic functions of Word and Excel and Outlook. They are very much happier with Writer, Calc and Thunderbird. \nHowever, we do very much basic drawing of electrical units, lines, cameras, lambs etc. Using Autocad for this is really overkill. So no one wants to pay for it (it is still wrong though). So they accepted me looking for totally legal and equally usefull alternatives. \nI have tried BricsCAD and DraftSight so far with no success.. In Turkey Linux is very little known, so is methods of installing apps on it. They are so used to click on an exe and \"next\" a few times.. In my unsuccessfull demonstration of installing both apps in 64bit Ubuntu 12.04LTS (and 13.10) they failed and I could not make them work no matter what. \nWe can not use FreeCAD and LibreCAD since they only work with DXF format and arcitects are sending us the files in DWG format. \nInterestingly, they work pretty well when I try them on a Windows environment. But no success on Ubuntu, so this makes them think Ubuntu is not ready as a daily driver. \nSo basicly, I need to convince them to switch to a Ubuntu system with an easily install-able CAD program which gives us very basic 2D functions like making lines, polylines and stretching them, working with layers, locking layers, making and editing blocks (shaped like bulbs, fuses,..), moving, copying etc.. \nCould you advise me some solutions? Easy to be installed and similar to Autocad interface if possible. So I can convince everybody.

If you use a backup tool that calculates the diff between backups your \"points-in-time\" will be as small as the differences between backup points, or just use a file-system with snapshot abilities to create on-the-fly automatic file system snapshots (ZFS, BTRFS and some others do that already and are supported in Linux).\nSomething else that is really easy to implement is a backup on apt-get, just add a run hook in /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99bup containing:\nDPkg::Post-Invoke {\"/bin/bash /foo_script\"; };\n\nwhere foo_script creates a backup of all your (selected) files to a safe place after installing packages (restore those files to a previsous version if the packages you installed are not wanted).

Just because you are connected to LAN doesn't guarantee (full) Internet access. If you know you have Internet access then it may be a firewall issue.\nTry to ping the repository and see if you get a DNS resolution and response. For example, if you are using the U.S. repository then try this:\nping us.archive.ubuntu.com\n\nIf you are in another country then you should use a repository closer to you.

If I do ps -al then I don't see for example my java jobs but I see them when I do the (strange and unrecognized) ps -xal | grep java which probably should be something else. I can also find the java PID by a netstat for the port that the java (jetty server) in running on (port 80), get the PID for the process on port 80 and then kill it by its PID. I doesn't seem like sudo killall java works all the time. Can you help my with a working strategy how to simplify handling the running of 2-3 jetty instances that only sometimes appear when doing ps -al ? I suppose the best way is to stop jetty similarly to the manner in which it is started i.e. sudo mvn jetty:stop but the jetty manual says that it's ok to just kill the process, which is faster.

I'm trying to get the URL from that file using a shell script.\nIn the file, the URL is like this:\n('URL', 'http://url.com');\n\nI tried to use the following:\ncat file.php | grep 'URL' | awk '{ print $2 }'\n\nIt gives the output as:\n'http://url.com');\n\nBut I need to get only url.com in a variable inside the shell script. How can I accomplish this?\n\nA: Try this,\nawk -F// '{print $2}' file.php | cut -d \"'\" -f 1\n\n\nA: Revisiting this again, and trying to use nothing but a Bash shell, another one line solution is:\nwhile read url; do url=\"${url##*/}\" && echo \"${url%%\\'*}\"; done < file.in > file.out\n\nWhere file.in contains the 'dirty' url list and file.out will contain the 'clean' URL list. There are no external dependencies and there is no need to spawn any new processes or subshells.  The original explanation and a more flexible script follows.  There is a good summary of the method here, see example 10-10.  This is pattern based parameter substitution in Bash.\nExpanding on the idea:\nsrc=\"define('URL', 'http://url.com');\"\nsrc=\"${src##*/}\"        # remove the longest string before and including /\necho \"${src%%\\'*}\"      # remove the longest string after and including '\n\nResult:\nurl.com\n\nNo need to call any external programs.  Furthermore, the following bash script, get_urls.sh, permits you to read a file directly or from stdin:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\n# usage: \n#     ./get_urls.sh 'file.in'\n#     grep 'URL' 'file.in' | ./get_urls.sh\n\n# assumptions: \n#     there is not more than one url per line of text.\n#     the url of interest is a simple one.\n\n# begin get_urls.sh\n\n# get_url 'string'\nfunction get_url(){\n  local src=\"$1\"\n  src=\"${src##*/}\"        # remove the longest string before and including /\n  echo \"${src%%\\'*}\"      # remove the longest string after and including '\n}\n\n# read each line.\nwhile read line\ndo\n  echo \"$(get_url \"$line\")\"\ndone < \"${1:-/proc/${$}/fd/0}\"\n\n# end get_urls.sh\n\n\nA: If all the lines contain a URL:\nawk -F\"'|http://\" '{print $5}' file.php \n\nIf only some lines contain a URL:\nawk -F\"'|http://\" '/^define/ {print $5}' file.php \n\nDepending on the other lines you may need to change the ^define regex\n\nA: You can do everything with a simple grep:\ngrep -oP \"http://\\K[^']+\" file.php \n\nFrom man grep:\n   -P, --perl-regexp\n          Interpret  PATTERN  as  a  Perl  regular  expression  (PCRE, see\n          below).  This is highly experimental and grep  -P  may  warn  of\n          unimplemented features.\n   -o, --only-matching\n          Print  only  the  matched  (non-empty) parts of a matching line,\n          with each such part on a separate output line.\n\nThe trick is to use \\K which, in Perl regex, means discard everything matched to the left of the \\K. So, the regular expression looks for strings starting with http:// (which is then discarded because of the \\K) followed by as many non-' characters as possible. Combined with -o, this means that only the URL will be printed. \nYou could also do it in Perl directly:\nperl -ne \"print if s/.*http:\\/\\/(.+)\\'.*/\\$1/\" file.php\\\n\n\nA: Something like this?\ngrep 'URL' file.php | rev | cut -d \"'\" -f 2 | rev\n\nor\ngrep 'URL' file.php | cut -d \"'\" -f 4 | sed s/'http:\\/\\/'/''/g\n\nTo strip out http://.\n\nA: Simple:\nphp -r 'include(\"file.php\"); echo URL;'\n\nand if you need to remove the 'http://', then:\nphp -r 'include(\"file.php\"); echo URL;' | sed 's!^http://\\(.*\\)!\\1!'\n\nSo:\nmyURL=$(php -r 'include(\"file.php\"); echo URL;' | sed 's!^http://\\(.*\\)!\\1!')\n\nIf you need a certain part of the URL you need to refine your terminology, a URL is all of the following, sometimes more:\nURL := protocol://FQDN[/path][?arguments]\n\nFQDN := [hostname.]domain.tld\n\n\nA: for me, the other grep answers given return string information after the link.\nThis worked for me to only pull out the url:\negrep -o \"(http(s)?://){1}[^'\\\"]+\"\n\n", "Q: Disconnected from wireless network - Ubuntu 12.04, Sony VF I bought a Sony VAIO F series (SVF15A1C5E) recently with Windows 8 on it.

Just gave it a bit of thought, then right clicked the .exe file, went to properties, and Permission, and under Others, changed the permission from READ ONLY to Read and Write. Installed Perfectly. \nThanks all for your help, especially Ashish. \n\nA: I tried out your link and everything seems to be normal. The program is running fine under Wine1.6 (which you already have).\nRight Click on the setup and select Open With Wine Windows Program Loader. The setup starts. Uncheck Launch Program after Installation (that might not open it with Wine). Follow all the steps.\n\nAfter proceeding, the file is downloaded and HF MetaTrader 4 is installed (2 successive downloads, progress bar fills twice on mine).\n\nFinish the setup and go to dash(Super/Windows key on keyboard) and type \"hotforex\" and click on HotForex MT4(opens with Wine).\n\n\nThis works on Ubuntu.

Specifically, which version of Ubuntu?  Is your network connection Wireless or Wired? Do you have DHCP or a static address? Certain versions of Ubuntu around the 2008-2009 timeframe could not handle static addresses within the GUI Network configuration tool.\nI'll take a stab at it, though. I'll assume you are using the Desktop and not Server variant, with the appropriate GUI config tools.\n1) Log into your GUI account, at the dash type Network.  Click on the icon that looks like a folder with an Ethernet jack in it.\n2) Click on the default connection, click on options button.  On the new page click the General tab, and make sure both those two top boxes are checked.  Then logout and verify from VT1 that the redirection happens for that user.\n", "Q: Multiple booting errors for 13.10 I have an Acer Aspire V5 Touch, which came with Windows 8 preinstalled. I removed it and installed Ubuntu 13.10 in its place. At first the performance was great, much better than Win8 and it booted up in under 20 seconds (HDD not SSD).\nRecently however, I have been experiencing very slow boot ups and I also see the GRUB menu a lot. I'm guessing that's due to some sort of startup issue.

But I will try what you suggested and let you know. Thank you! This is a fairly new laptop, from Aug 2013.\nEDIT: it has booted up but is ridiculously slow and doesn't open Firefox at all.\nEdit: the file system was in read only so I ran fsck, which is fixing inodes from a corrupted orphan linked list, and deleted inodes which have zero dtime. There are a lot more things which were fixed. But luckily I have all of the data on the laptop backed up.\n\nA: I've seen these symptoms before, and typically it indicates that the controller is having trouble writing to the disk, most likely because that disk is bad.  Sometimes it is due to a fall, other times, just a bad batch of disks. Also please let us know if you have recently tweaked a BIOS setting related to disks, like AHCI/Legacy mode or similar. I recommend using an external tool to diagnose your disk issue.\n1) Back up everything important off that disk.  Do not wait.\n2) Get Parted Magic - the last 'free' version is 8/2013.  I've seen it on Major Geeks, or you can contribute to Patrick and get the latest version at partedmagic.com.\n3) Burn it to a CD or use UNetBootIn (on Linux/Windows) or Rufus (Windows Only) to write it to USB.  I recommend USB. But please don't use the one you backed your stuff up on from step one, because this requires a USB format.\n4) In Parted Magic, use the GSmartTool to identify if your disk is dying.  If any attributes are pink, it is probably time to replace the disk.  Especially reallocated sectors or Read/Write failure.  Don't wait for a SMART error from the BIOS.  I've only seen one in 20 years of working on computers.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: terminal commands \"command not found\" I'm very new to Ubuntu and having a few problems. I'm trying to debrick my HP  Touchpad via the jc scullin wiki method, but when I'm inputting a command in the terminal such as Run\" cd Downloads\" I just keep getting back ! command not found. Is there something I'm missing? An install or different command? Just following the instructions provided for the process and starting to lose the plot.\n\nA: The message, \"command not found\" means that you are entering something that the terminal doesn't know what to do with.  More simply, you are entering the command incorrectly or it is not a command at all. \nThe manual pages can help find the command you want, plus show you how to use it.  From the terminal, try:\n\nman man\nman apt-get\nman -k cd\nman -k cd downloads\n\nThe first command is to show the manual page for the manual pager.  The second is for an important command used to install new programs (installed from packages in Ubuntu), remove them, or update your system.  The third command above uses the -k option, which means to search for commands, packages, and (more importantly) the descriptions for them.  You'll get a list of commands with that string.  If you spot one that looks right, use the man command to see what it does. \nThis will help you figure out what to do.  If you need help with a specific problem, you need to describe it, give links to wiki page(s) you are referencing, copy/paste the commands or pictures of what you are trying with the output.\n", "Q: How to set hostnames to specific range of IP addresses on DHCP Server? I'm working on Diskless Linux Clusters. I'm using Ubuntu Server 12.04( DHCP, TFTP and NFS servers installed and configured). When I boot slave machines via Live CD, all of them have same hostname but different IP addresses.  I want to set hostname/ip address pair to slave machines via DHCP server without knowing slaves MAC addresses. For example:\n      IP       Hostname \n192.168.1.200   slave1\n192.168.1.201   slave2\n...\n192.168.1.253   slave54\n\nWhen a slave machine dynamically get 192.168.1.201 IP address from DHCP server, its hostname must be slave2. I used this solution on client side to get hostname from DHCP Server. But I don't know how to do this matching \"192.168.1.201   slave2\" on server side. My DHCP config file:\n...\n\nsubnet 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0  {\n    range dynamic-bootp 192.168.1.200 192.168.1.253; # Range of lease IP  address\n    option broadcast-address 192.168.1.255;\n    option routers 192.168.1.1;\n}\n\nnext-server 192.168.1.10; # PXE server address\nfilename “pxelinux.0”;\n\nDHCP server dynamically assigns IP addresses to clients without knowing clients MAC address. I think that it can assign hostnames too. Is there a way to do that? Please give me any advice.\n\nA: My professor answered my question. There is no specific tool or method to assign hostname and ip address pair without knowing MAC address in Linux Server. Because Linux server uses pure DHCP standards. So I have to assign a hostname/fixed ip address with MAC address for each slave in /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf file. For example:\nhost slave1 {\n  hardware ethernet 00:00:00:00:00:01;\n  fixed-address 192.168.1.200;\n  option host-name \"slave1\";\n}\n\nhost slave2 {\n   hardware ethernet 00:00:00:00:00:02;\n   fixed-address 192.168.1.201;\n   option host-name \"slave2\";\n}\n...\n\nHe said: \"you can do that with using hostname table in Windows NT Server\".

A few days ago I edited my ~/.profile and have spotted a syntax error in it. Now, when I try to log on, it sends me back to the 'greeting screen' after some errors. I do have a guest account, but no other accounts in the admin group. I've been searching for a solution, but found nothing that has worked so far. Here's what I have already tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launching root terminal from recovery mode in GRUB. When I tried to edit my .profile with nano/vi, it said that it was read-only.\n\n*Launching dpkg from recovery mode. This gave me an error saying the mount was terminated with status 32.\n\n*Booting into single user mode. This gave me the same error as no. 2; mount was terminated with status 32\n\n*Logging in with virtual terminal. I pressed ctrl+alt+f2 in greeting screen and logged in, but there was a login loop here too; it would immediately ask for my login again after I logged in.\n\n\nAny ideas?\n\nA: When you log into recovery mode with grub, you'll have to remount / as readwrite, like:\nmount -t ext4 /dev/sda1 / -o rw\nyou should look at the fstab\ncat /etc/fstab\nto see if you are supposed to use /dev/sdaX or /dev/sdbX or UUID or Device-by-id syntax.  where X is the partition of /.  After you do get in, I recommend creating a secondary account.  Make sure to add it to the additional group \"wheel\" or \"root\", but not as the main group.  Also, make sure you use visudo to add this user to the \"sudoers\".\nAdditionally, you can type\nsudo passwd\nto unlock your root account to prevent having to go through all this trouble again. Please do not log into your desktop as root.\n", "Q: I am considering changing to Ubuntu from Windows 8. Will I still be able to use Yahoo mail and Google Chrome if I switch?\n\nA: Yes. Google offers Chrome as a .deb package for Ubuntu and other Debian-based distros. And then there's Chromium by the community. Yahoo mail doesn't depend on the OS.\n\nA: Of course,you have to download google chrome as you did it in windows8.And you'll be also able to use yahoo mail as before.\n\nA: Yahoo Mail - sure, that's a website.  As long as your browser can render the HTML and JavaScript that Yahoo spits out, you are good to go. It might be advisable to keep another browser, such as FireFox handy, in case Chromium gets a curve ball from that new Yahoo interface.\nAs for taking your browsing history and bookmarks and whatnot to Ubuntu, make sure to sign into Google Chrome and synchronize everything.  It shouldn't take more than an hour.  Check it with the Google Dashboard.  Then go to Ubuntu and install Chrome (or Chromium), and sign into it. Shouldn't take more than 30 minutes for all your bookmarks to flow into the computer.

The Side menu is pretty nice, however I am using 3-4 programs (in the definition that they have an icon and appear on the side bar), so most of the space the task bar requires is not used. \nIs there a way to have the icons on the top, where the clock, sound and email are? Some programs, like skype or spotify appear there. I want all programs to appear there and, if possible, to have icons by default and start the programs from there.\nIs it possible ? If so, how ?\n\nA: You can check if this works for you, if not, have in mind that Unity have been designed with certain guidelines. In particular, the indicators are not used for window/task management. You can set the Launcher to auto-hide and install a dock/panel and configure it to suit your needs. There are many dock/panel alternatives: docky, cairo-dock, xfce4-panel, gnome-panel, tint2, lxpanel, ....\nYou could also install KDE or Xfce, which can be easily configured to have a panel on the top as you wish.

I tried to open Software Center using the command line \nsoftware-center\n\nand it did work. I mean, Software Center opened and works fine, BUT, at the same time, in the Terminal window I see a lot of strange errors. How can that be? I'm puzzled. \nIs there any explanation for this (and a fix for it)? I repeat, the app does open and it works fine, is only the lines in the background that show that something is not all right.\nHere are the screen-shots with all the lines.\n\n\n\n\nA: Of course, what you are seeing in the terminal are messages to developers. So you have two choices, either to ignore them or to open up the app without seeing them. \nTo do the second option try this in the command line:\nnohup software-center &\n\nIt will open up the application and get back to terminal without any garbage\n\nA: The messages you see being printed to the console are not necessarily errors. Most of the ones in your screen shots are in fact, just informative, or warnings. The warnings about theme handling, are due to the GTK+ theme you are using. They are not fatal, but they do need to be fixed by whomever made the theme, and they may in the future cause greater issues if they do not get fixed.\nSome of the WARNINGS that are actually from the software-center application, are really just information.\nGenerally, these warnings and info messages can be safely ignored.\n\nA: Very closely related questions have been asked before. Here are links to some of the answers:\n\n*\n\n*https://askubuntu.com/a/369920/248158\n\n*https://askubuntu.com/a/205447/248158\n\n*https://askubuntu.com/a/226861/248158\n\n*https://askubuntu.com/a/143406/248158\n\n*https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/25713\nI like this explanation:\n\nSuch messages are common with Gnome applications and do not necessarily indicate a bug. Gnome takes a dumbed-down approach to users; the intended audience won't run an application from a terminal and so won't see these messages. Redirect error output from Gnome applications to a log file if you really care, or to /dev/null otherwise.\n\nSource: Gilles.\nAnd this is also nice:\n\nThis error indicates that the software is using perfectly valid GTK library calls with a newer version of the GTK library. Sometimes during software development it is desirable to get rid of the, \"old way\", to do things while maintaining backwards compatibility. This is accomplished by marking the undesired calls depreciated. This tells the developer that their code is perfectly valid in this release, but in the future their code will need to be updated to work with a new version of the library, possibly many releases down the road.\nIn this case, GTK wants to be more strict about including units on dimensions. It tells the developer that GTK is assuming the units are pixels, which is the exact assumption that the software developer made in the first place.\n\nSource: Bailley S\nBy the way, if you launch Firefox from terminal you'll may see a terrifying message like this:\nGLib-CRITICAL **: g_slice_set_config: assertion\n\nBut it seems to be harmless as per comment in Bug #833117.\nIn short, there's mostly no need for us beginners to launch GUI-based apps from the terminal unless there's a problem and we need to give output to someone who can understand the meaning of such output.\n", "Q: Wireless mouse is not working I have a Gigabyte wireless mouse (m7600), and Ubuntu 13.10 freshly installed on a Dell Inspiron n5110.

In short: I am trying to install spamassassin but dpkg returns only with:\ndpkg: error processing spamassassin (--configure):\nsubprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 1\n\nI have tried to find more information about what is going wrong but I cannot find anywhere any useful logging.\nIn /var/crash a spamassassin crashreport is generated but this gives only old dpkg errors and:\n Start-Date: 2014-02-17  19:18:13\n Commandline: apt-get install spamassassin\nAptOrdering:\n spamassassin: Configure\n amavisd-new-postfix: Configure\n\nFollowed by dmesg logging from startup. \nAmavis gives an error because dependency spamassassin is not configured.\nI checked the log files:\napt history.log\napt term.log\ndpkg.log\nsyslog.log\n\nbut no additional information.\nI tried dpkg -D with all possible octals but I find nothing useful about what could go wrong.\nLots of questions and possible solutions have been written about dpkg errors and many I have tried, but with no additional information I do not have the feeling I am getting anywhere. \nSurely there must be somewhere a possibility to read what is going wrong or to crank up some logging so it will be logged?\n\nA: Ok, I have found the solution for this problem. Thought I was unable to crank up the logging to get more data, the data already presented had the clue to the problem.\ndpkg: error processing spamassassin (--configure):\nsubprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 1\n\nsays dpkg encountered an error processing spamassassin while running configure. Next line tels us the post-installation script did not finish correct.\nIn the /var/lib/dpkg/info dir we can locate the script files of dpkg, the file: spamassassin.postinst gives us the script file which generated the error.\nWithin this file we know we have to look at the code runned by configure:\n\nif [ \"$1\" = \"configure\" ]; then\n\nand after some debugging I found out the line:\n\nsu debian-spamd -c \"sa-update --gpghomedir /var/lib/spamassassin/sa-update-keys \\\n          --import /usr/share/spamassassin/GPG.KEY\"\n\nreturned exit code 1 (run command @commandline and use echo $? next to get the exit code)\nThe problem was that the user debian-spamd already existed on my system but its login shell was /bin/false. Su-ing with /bin/false returns without any message but exitcode 1.\nAdding -s /bin/sh to the command solved the problem though in the end I did alter the login shell of the user to stay in sync with future updates.\n\nA: Generally to debug such issues, you would edit /var/lib/dpkg/info/spamassassin.postinst (or .preinst, pr .prerm or .postrm; depending on which one is failing) and change #!/bin/sh at the top line to #!/bin/sh -x (same thing if it bash instead: just add -x)\nThat would provide you with line-by-line debug of shell script, so you could tell where it exits with non-zero code (causing the installation/upgrade to fail). \nIt would probably require at least some shell scripting skills to debug, though.\n\nA: Here, like the previous answer, we see how to add debugging code, (e.g., \"set -x\") to an /var/lib/dpkg/info/* file, BUT without having it get overwritten just before execution!:\n  # dpkg --unpack /var/cache/apt/archives/grub-pc_2.06-2_amd64.deb\n  ... edit /var/lib/dpkg/info/grub-pc.postinst ...\n  # dpkg --configure grub-pc\n\n", "Q: What is console-kit-daemon for? I am running Ubuntu in console mode. Do I need console-kit-daemon to be started?\nWhat is it doing?

UNetBootin comes with three different choices for Ubunutu images: NetInstall, HdMedia, and Live.  What's the difference?\n\nA: Derp, it's right there in the interface:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Live version allows for booting in Live mode, from which the installer can optionally be launched.\n\n*The NetInstall version allows for installation over FTP, and can install Kubuntu and other official Ubuntu derivatives.\n\n*If you would like to use a pre-downloaded alternate (not desktop) install iso, use the HdMedia option, and then place the alternate install iso file on the root directory of your hard drive or USB drive\n\n\nA: The short answer:\n\n\n*\n\n*Live refers to a system you can boot from CD/DVD or USB.\n\n*Net-install installs the system on your hard-drive and it checks for\nupdates for certain packages. Changes to the system are permanent.\n\n*HdMedia means installing directly from the HDD, by booting the ISO.\n\n", "Q: Get Qt WebKit HTML Content in QML My application is built with QML (Ubuntu SDK), and I need to get the HTML content from a page loaded with a Qt WebView after the page is loaded.  Based on some initial research, it would appear that this used to be directly supported, but not anymore.  I'm using Qt 5/QtWebKit 3.  How can I get the source from the page with JavaScript?\nEdit: I found out about the experimental object, but I've still not found what I need.  More here: http://rschroll.github.io/beru/2013/08/21/qtwebview.experimental.html\nEdit: just a broader perspective on what I'm trying to do.  My application attaches to a user's Freshbooks account through OAuth.  After they've entered their credentials, I need to be able to access the OAuth verifier code from the content of the page.  Via the OAuth protocol, I don't know of any other way to get this code.  I can't even have the user copy-paste it over, because you can't select text in the WebView :(\n\nA: For your first question, you should be able to do this by running some Javascript inside the WebView with WebView.experimental.evaluateJavaScript().  This Javascript could get the page source (or better yet, just the content you want, since it'll be better at parsing HTML than the Javascript-in-QML) and report it back via the document title.  For example,\nwebview.experimental.evaluateJavaScript(\n    \"document.title = document.getElementById('id').innerHTML\")\n\nI'll admit that I don't know much about OAuth, but I can't help but feel you're doing something wrong if you need to do this.  Have you checked out Online Accounts or this OAuth plugin?\n", "Q: How do I re-install Zeitgeist Datahub in the Startup Application Preferences I stupidly removed Zeitgeist Datahub from Startup Application Preferences.

Under IPv4 settings, change the method to Automatic (DHCP) addresses only. Then fill in your preferred DNS nameservers. Please see: \n\n\nA: As far as I see it there are 3 options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add your own list of dns tables to the hosts file, its a hassle and will only work for the sites added to the file.\n\n*Use tor, no more ISP dns but internet will be slower in most cases.\n\n*Use a VPN, a good one will cost you some money (apox $5 a month)\n\n\nOther options would be to change ISP, or use a website like http://anonymouse.org/\n", "Q: The PC is not completing the restart process after installation 12.04 My PC was trying to restart to finish installation but it has hung midway through.\nThe last message it shows is synchronising SCSi cache. It's the first reboot after installation of 12.04.\n\nA: Try installing again following the Official Documentation.\n\nIt could just be a loose connection.  For this try powering off the computer, unplugging the power cable, a few seconds later touch the metal on the outside of the box to discharge any static electricity, unplug the hard drive cable from both ends, and reconnect everything.\n\nThere could be a problem with the hard drive.  The Live CD has several tools to repair the disk, such as:\n\nsudo fdisk -l\nsudo fsck /dev/yourdisk\nsudo badblocks -sv /dev/yourdisk\n\n\nfdisk will show you all the drives that are accessable.  fsck will check and repair the file system.  badblocks will actually search the physical disk for parts that are bad.  Disk Utility is a GUI tool used for the same thing.  Boot-Repair is another option.\nThe log files are extremely useful for troubleshooting.  You can view your logs from terminal like this:\n\ncd /var/logs\nless syslog\n\nAs mentioned in the LinuxLogFiles Wiki, you can browse them like this:\n\n\"Press h for help, or q to quit.

From there I'm a little confused about what happened but I ended up in a mac recovery mode (offering to reinstall OSX), which I tried to exit out of as quickly as possible.\nWhen it rebooted, it seems to be jumping straight to grub, which needs telling which partition to boot and I can't boot OSX (only Ubuntu).\nIt's as though I've changed the active partition (is that even relevant for EFI?). Can this be fixed from inside ubuntu? I have a retina display macbook, so no CD, and I'd like to fix this from inside Ubuntu ideally.\n\nA: Try booting with a CD-R or USB flash drive image of rEFInd. This should enable you to boot into OS X and re-install rEFInd there (or just re-run the relevant bless command from the rEFInd OS X installation instructions -- see step #8).\n\nA: Press Option during startup. This starts in Startup Manager, where you can select an OS X volume or other volumes to start from.  \nThere are a number of other key combinations that may help you to get back to the original boot menu.\n", "Q: How can I detect motion in a long, mostly dull video? I need a way to scan through hours and hours of recorded video (mp4, mov, avi, doesn't matter, I can fix that) to search for motion. The videos consist of many, many hours of dull nature scenes like bird nests or a feeding site where very little happens for long stretches punctuated by short bursts of action like parents switching, feeding, etc.\nI can't use a cctv monitoring program because those monitor a live stream and only record when there's action. These videos are recorded way off the grid where any form of internet connection is a distant dream.\nI've looked at Zoneminder and Motion, but these don't allow me to switch the input from a live feed to a file. Ideally, I'd like it to scan a whole lot faster than real-time.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: DVR-Scan\n\nDVR-Scan is a cross-platform command-line (CLI) application that\n  automatically detects motion events in video files (e.g. security\n  camera footage). In addition to locating both the time and duration of\n  each motion event, DVR-Scan will save the footage of each motion event\n  to a new, separate video clip. Not only is DVR-Scan free and\n  open-source software (FOSS), written in Python, and based on Numpy and\n  OpenCV, it was built to be extendable and hackable.\n\nUsage:\ndvr-scan -i some_video.mp4 -o some_video_motion_only.avi\n\n\nA: VLC\nVLC has a motion detection filter that you can try by accessing: Tools -> Effects and Filters -> Video Effects -> Advanced -> Motion Detect.\n\nYou might have more tweaks available running it from the command line with the --video-filter=motiondetect flag; check out this example.\n", "Q: Hard drive (hfsplus) will not allow me to chown or chmod I tried chmod and chown, neither worked and I got a message like this, repeated for every file in the drive.\nchmod: changing permissions of ‘folder/filename.id’: Read-only file system failed to change mode of ‘folder/filename.id’ from 0644 (rw-r--r--) to 0777 (rwxrwxrwx)\nI am trying to gain control of this drive, but it says the owner is \"user #99\" and the group is \"99\"\nI've looked all over the forum for an answer, but most of the answers direct me to chmod or chown or both, and almost none of these are mac (hfsplus) drives.\n\nA: \nsudo chmod -R 755 /desired/path\nsudo chown -R username /desired/path\n\nAre you using the sudo command?  Because you would not have permissions otherwise.  This thread looks similar to your issue.  In the thread, kidders recommends mounting the filesystem and chown-ing the mounting point:\n\nls /dev\nsudo mkdir /mnt/sdb1\nsudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/sdb1\nsudo fdisk -l\nsudo chown -R username /mnt/sdb1\nll /mnt\n\nThe sdb1 is the name of your drive.  The fdisk and ll commands are just to show information about what you mounted and its permissions.\n\nThis thread says that \"Journaled HFS+ currently mounts read only by default on ubuntu.\"  If that's the case, then manually mounting and changing ownership should get you full access.\n\nEdit 1\nI created 2 extra partitions (for a total of 3) on an external USB flash drive and had permissions issues.  I had to specify the group to take ownership, which may work for you.  My username and group are the same:\n\nsudo chown -R username:username /mnt/sdh1\n\n", "Q: Unable to update Package Manager due to syntax error I noticed my package manager was not updating and kept giving an error about third party repo's so I disabled them and tried to run\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -f && sudo apt-get update\n\nHowever it seems the hplip package is not allowing me to do this.

However, I don't know how to change the file preferences.\n\nA: I think the command you are looking for is bash.  Here's a link and example:\n\ncd /home/username/Documents\ntouch runafile\ngedit runafile\n\n#!/bin/bash (hit Enter to go down one line)\necho \"Hello world\"\n\n(type Ctrl-x to exit)\n(type y for yes)\n(hit Enter to keep the filename)\n\nbash runafile\n\nBy default in Ubuntu, a plain text file executes by opening in gedit (you can change this by right-clicking the text file/Properties/Open With).  Are you attempting to execute a script?  You can execute any file from terminal like this:\n\ncd /desired/path\n./fileToExecute\n\n\nA: If you are looking to do this through Nautilus (called \"File Browser\" in recent versions, I think), you can mark a file as executable via the Properties dialog. Right-click on a file, go to Properties, then the Permissions tab, and check \"Allow executing file as program\".\n(You can also set this via the chmod command – chmod u+x file.txt should do the trick.)\nIf you try to open it now, you'll be asked: \nDo you want to run \"file.txt\", or display its contents?\n\n\"file.txt\" is an executable text file.\n\n[Run in Terminal] [Display] [Cancel] [Run]\n\nDisplay will open it however the system would if it weren't executable. Run in Terminal will open a terminal and run it, printing out the normal output. Run will run it, without opening a terminal. Cancel cancels.\nThat should do the trick, I think.\n", "Q: Very small package for apt-get experimentation? I spent a lot of time this weekend installing and uninstalling kmines to test out options on apt-get install, subshells, and the like.

Minimizing installation and purge time is the goal. \n\nA: rolldice \nit has man pages but just takes a couple seconds to install and purge.\n", "Q: I have a Mac OS X Server running a FQDN web site, with Ubuntu VBox running on top: I want to have a subdomain point to another computer on my network (technically it's an Ubuntu VBox on same server, but with different IP.), but lets just say I started apache on another computer on the home network so that it serves a subdomain name of the FQDN. \nRouter is set up correctly opening incoming ports to each specific IP, so not sure why when I access the subdomain via the web it defaults to main site. Something is being either re-directed incorrectly or just not able to get through to the computer on local net.\nMain server of the FQDN is Mac OS X Server (for now), could fully convert it over to Ubuntu...But I want to keep the mail service and jabberd service going on the Mac Server side. Maybe setting the subdomain name as an NS on my dyndns.org account...??\nStumped.\n\nA: This has been solved for now...\nMy problem was that I am running a MAC OS X Server GUI (gawd!). Anyway to get my subdomain to point to another computer on the LAN, in this case an Ubuntu virtual box running on the same MAC server I needed to use a reverse proxy in the virtual hosts .conf file. Problem I thought I was going to have that any time I make changes via the MAC GUI it would overwrite the file to default values. So I tested it and for some reason it didn't and here is what I replaced the default values with:\nVirtualHost *:80 (Add the <> before and after, for some reason it won't print on this forum, so it should be VirtualHost *:80 btwn the <>)\n    ServerName subdomain.domain.info\n    ProxyPreserveHost On\n    ProxyRequests off\n    ProxyPass / http://192.168.0.6/\n    ProxyPassReverse / http://192.168.0.6/\n\n(here you should add the /VirtualHost preceded by < and > after). \nAnd viola it pointed to the Ubuntu VBox and didn't interrupt pointing to the correct directory of the FQDN. I got purposely vague tips from a gentleman on the MAC OS X Server forums that pointed me in the right direction. So there you have it, if you have a Mac Box Server and want to tinker with a VBox and send a subdomain to it you have to manually add the subdomain to your MAC GUI then edit the default created file in /Library/Server/Web/Config/apache2/sites 0000_any_80_yoursubdomain.domain.com and delete everything and replace it with above directive, obviously change the IP number to your chosen number of the box you want to point to.\nHaving said all that, I had pre-configured DNS on the Ubuntu box following Chapter 8 instructions of the Ubuntuserverguide.pdf Domain Name Service (DNS). Not sure if it had any effect, but I will post back when I fire up another blank box and not configure the DNS entries and see if it still works with default values.\nUPDATE: fired up a new VM Box didn't configure DNS services and well, still works, so DNS can largely be ignored I guess if there is another server on the LAN dealing with all that.\nOne thing I did notice though that was pretty cool, when I shut down the VM Box and you try to access the domain hosted on it the MAC Server puts a nice kind message up saying \"Service temporarily unavailable due to maintenance\" which is kind of cool, means that the server exists no matter what. How interesting is that?\nUpdate:\nCreated a workaround so as to be able to ftp into my subdomain. Basically, enabled FTP services on the MAC GUI server software which defaults to whatever directory you assign no matter what address you us, i.e. subdomain.FQDN.com or FQDN.com. Kind of boring that the MAC doesn't provide multiple FTP login's to different directories for each subdomain/domain served.\nAnyway... sudo apt-get install samba and configure your share folder and you can access it from Mac finder and mount it, then tell the MAC Server FTP to use that mounted directory. Not ideal, but it works especially when I launch Dreamweaver and use actual subdomain ftp address it takes me to / and not /var/www via local connect using vsftpd. I can now access it remotely, which is always handy and it won't go past the / which translates to /var/www on the VM.\nOne other note about this set up, the users on the MAC server can't access the ftp site unless specifically added to the smb.conf file on the VM... very cool.\n", "Q: Why am I not able to open or extract .zip files?

I am using 13.10 in VMWare as a guest. \nWhile trying to remove an older version of libjpeg using apt-get, somehow, the whole desktop and related applications were removed.\nI have rebooted into recovery mode and it has attempted to mount my disks. However, it gets stuck during the loading of services.\nIt's now showing something like below and just sits there:\n* Starting Elasticsearch Server [OK]\n\n\nNew development:\nI have gotten into the root shell with network enabled. sudo apt-get update was also run.\nNow, when I go and do sudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop it lists a bunch of dependencies, but says they will not be installed. Therefore, since dependencies were not met, install could not proceed:\n\nIf I run sudo apt-get check, I also get the same output.\nWhat can be done to resolve this? I do not want to do apt-get -f install yet without understanding the implications.\n\nA: Here's what I did to solve the problem.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into recovery mode by holding down the shift key on boot. Once in the recovery mode, drop into root shell.\n\n*At this point the file system is mounted as read only. I had to modify some files to get the internet to work. So, mount the FS as read write: mount -o rw,remount /.\n\n*I then edited my /etc/fstab to comment out a windows share because Ubuntu wasn't able to connect to it and enabling the network fails.\n\n*Type exit to get back to the menu.\n\n*Enable the network from the menu.\n\n*Go back into root shell.\n\n*Try sudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop.\n\n*In my case, I had that error regarding dependencies being unmet, so I first did sudo apt-get -f install.\n\n*Finally do sudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop.\n\n*Reset the launcher icons to default: unity --reset-icons. This command crashed the system, but I got the default launch icons back on reboot.\n", "Q: How do I enlarge the icons in the Firefox bookmarks-bar?

Booted up from live media (ubuntu 12.04) with HDD (3TB, GUID, single EXT4 partition used for storing data and nothing else)connected via SATA. For some reason the file system was only allowing \"read only\" access so I decided to unmount. I opened up \"disk utility\" and just clicked \"mount\" for the heck of it. For whatever reason it hung (and didn't actually end up finishing mount)... So I got impatient and did a sysreq+REISUO thing, but the system never shut off.. Got impatient again and just pulled the plug. Rebooted to find my that there is no longer any partition found on the device. \nSo basically.. I damaged, corrupted, destroyed, whatever my ext4 filesystem..? obviously all the data is still sitting there..right? I'm prob gonna go ahead and write block + dd the whole thing before before I do anything else, just 'cause.. when I get a hold of a spare 3 TB drive in the near future... that said.. what do I do, if anything, to get my partition and all the data on that partition back? What happened? How do I go about not losing 3 TB worth of data that I hadn't backed up yet? \n\nA: It's possible that TestDisk will recover the partition on the disk. If not, you may need to resort to PhotoRec, which is a file-level recovery tool. The trouble with PhotoRec is that it doesn't typically recover filenames or directory structures, so you can end up spending dozens of hours sorting through and renaming/moving files that it recovers.\nAs to the cause, it's impossible to know. Some possibilities that spring to mind include:\n\n\n*\n\n*Random data corruption caused by bugs, cosmic rays (for real), a power surge, a bad cable, or whatever.\n\n*A physically damaged disk. Checking it with a SMART utility (like GSMartControl) is advisable.\n\n*The uncontrolled shutdown you describe may have caused data corruption because a cache wasn't written back to disk.\n\n*Somebody may have broken into your computer and maliciously done damage. (Similarly, a virus or worm might be responsible, especially if the computer dual-boots with Windows.)\n\n\nNo doubt I'm forgetting some possibilities, too. You can perform checks like a SMART test, tests on your cables, security screenings, etc., to look for some of these items. Others, if they're the cause, will likely remain mysteries forever.\n\nA: I won't talk about causes, Rod Smith is already giving a fairly comprehensive list.\nI do not know TestDisk and it might be able to do what I'm about to describe...\nIf that disk was containing a single partition covering the whole disk, or if by chance you remember the partition details, you could recreate it. There are chances the data is still there and it's only your MBR/GPT that got damaged (GPT less likely as there are 2 copies).\nIn any case, if you can afford it, the first step prior to writing to the disk would be to make an image of it.\n", "Q: How to clear history on logout I tried adding history -c to ~/.bash_logout but seems not working.\n\nAdd:\nI'm having success by adding these lines into my ~/.bashrc (referred from here)\nunset HISTFILE\nexport LESSHISTFILE=/dev/null\n\nI still don't know why history -c method won't work.\n\nA: There are many history settings available via the builtin command set -o or environment variables, see bash's documentation on its history facilities.

It is Possibly a bug in PlayOnLinux, which should be reported on their forums. If you want to view psd files, You may like Kuickshow.  \nKuickShow is an image browser/viewer with a nice filebrowser to select images to be shown, slideshow support and the ability to display the following image formats: jpg, gif, tiff, png, bmp, psd, xpm, xbm, pbm and eim. Images can be displayed either in their own window, as large as the image, or fullscreen (which shrinks images too large to display). KuickShow also has a slideshow mode.\n\n\nA: I opened up System Settings > Additional Drivers and suddenly (I swear this was only added this week, I had a different driver activated before this) there appeared a new option called ATI/AMD propriety FGLRX graphics driver (**experimental** beta), which in the description:\n\nVideo driver for the AMD Radeon and FireGL graphics accelerators.

The\n  profile files read are /etc/profile and\n  ~/.profile, if it's a login shell. \n If it's not a login shell, the environment variable ENV is evaluated and the resulting\n  filename is taken as name of the startup file. \nAfter the startup files are read, Bash enters the POSIX(r)\n  compatiblity mode (for running, not for\n  starting!).\n Bash starts in sh compatiblity\n  mode when:  \n* \n*the base filename in\n  argv[0] is sh (Attention dear uber-clever\n  Linux users… /bin/sh may be linked to\n  /bin/bash, but that doesn't mean it acts like\n  /bin/bash)  \n\nMore information can be found at the Bash Reference Manual: Bash POSIX Mode, specifically:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Process substitution is not available.\n  \n\nwhich is why your sh script is failing, as the <(..) syntax is using process substitution.\n\nA: According to \nman bash\n\nit says \nWhen invoked as sh, bash enters posix mode after the startup files are read.\n\nSo you can not use bash features when run your script with /bin/sh.\n", "Q: sudo update-grub problem To say I am new to Linux would be an understatement (I've had Ubuntu 13.04 installed for about 5 hours), so bear with me. \nI was having some issues with not being able to change the back light on my laptop, and after several attempted fixes still haven't gotten anywhere, but right now my issue is this: when I try to use the sudo update-grub command, I get this in return:\n/usr/sbin/grub-mkconfig: 34: /etc/defaut.grub: logout: not found \nI assume I unwittingly changed something of importance, as it was updating fine a short time ago, but I am not sure how to fix it?\n\nA: Open a terminal, and add the Boot Repair PPA\n$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair && sudo apt-get update\n\nInstall Boot Repair\n$ sudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && boot-repair\n\nUpdate the GRUB 2 configuration file \n$ sudo update-grub\n\nReinstall GRUB 2 to the drive's MBR or equivalent\nInstall to the drive, not to the partition.

When I had Windows 7 on my Samsung R870 (Intel i3 and nvidia GeForce GT 330M), games like Team Fortress 2 (via Steam) ran really smoothly, but when I downloaded and installed Ubuntu and Ubuntu studio, the game runs fairly smoothly for about 15 minutes then my laptop completely turns off. \nWhy is this the case?\nI have also installed the correct graphics driver.\n\nA: They're not necessarily.  \nThey spec-ed out frame rates on a more minimal linux (Ubuntu without Unity to take weight off the video card) and Left4Dead2 had BETTER frame rates on linux.  It's my understanding TF2 runs on the same engine, so in theory if you were running something like XFCE instead of Unity it would have better frame rates on the same hardware.  \nLook at the threads here that talk about about getting more performance out of wine games (which should run slower because of an extra abstraction layer).  If you tune your box, you will get better frame rates on Linux native games than Windows native games as a general rule.\n\nA: Windows is constantly having their drivers tweaked by graphics card companies.\nThey specifically modify drivers to detect when a game is being run, and optimize from there for performance, crash issues, and other kinds of prioritization. \nLinux drivers for AMD/INTEL/NVIDIA are very low level, and obviously you need to expect a high degree of instability. I'm assuming because of the massive amount of operating system flavors.\nIt'd be nice if they had a higher degree of open source support.\nBest of Luck!\n-drXploit\n", "Q: Crontab GUI for Ubuntu 12.04 Is there any app for the Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (server, no visual interface) in order to easily manage crontab?

Spent a few days on this so far and I think I now have a good understanding of how it all works. I started with only changing settings on the INPUT chain and I can now accept/deny pretty much anything I need. ssh access for example.\nI then moved on to 'playing' with the OUTPUT chain and, whilst I think I understand what I'm doing, I must be missing something somewhere. Here is what I am trying to do (simply as a learning excercise).\nBlock all incoming requests, block all outgoing requests, then manually enable them one by one. Thought I would test it with http web access and I can't get it working.\nI am using webmin to configure iptables but I am happy to use a shell as well.\nINPUT chain : Default to block.\nEnable TCP to destination port 80 for NEW and ESTABLISHED connections.\nEnable TCP to destination port 53 for NEW and ESTABLISHED connections.\nOUTPUT chain : Default to block.\nEnable TCP from source port 80 for NEW connections.\nEnable TCP from source port 53 for NEW connections.\nI am thinking this way, I can browse the interweb (not HTTPS I know) as long as I initiate the connection.\nAs I say I'm just trying to understand a little more about iptables and network traffic in general.\nAny pointers as to what I am doing wrong would be welcome.\nP.S. I'm a Windows convert .... be gentle !\n\nA: First, IMO, you should NEVER set the default policy to DROP or REJECT. This is because if you flush iptables you will be locked out (not that I have EVER locked myself out mind you =) ).\nSecond, IMO, you should use REJECT rather then DROP. DROP is not more or less secure then REJECT, does not in any way \"hide\" your ip via \"sealth\", it simply slows legitimate traffic. Crackers can tell your ip exists because of the lag and they set their tools not ignore time outs. See http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~peterb/network/drop-vs-reject\nThird, the OUTPUT chain only blocks traffic coming from your host (sorry to state the obvious).\nLast , the order of your rules counts, so if you need help, post your rules.\nSee also: http://bodhizazen.com/Tutorials/iptables\n", "Q: Creating Partitions in root? I was trying to install Ubuntu along with windows but accidentally I got my entire hard disk wiped out and ubuntu remained.\nNow, Ubuntu is installed as considering my entire 500 gb as one drive (that too root ) with some space allocated to swap and all...\nNow , is there any option so that I could make some drives out of the situation...\nAny help will be great..\nthanks\nPiyush\n\nA: Yes! :D but you'd have to do it from your live USB or CD. you can't resize an active partition! (an active partition is one that is being used)\nJust boot from your USB/CD then open gparted and resize it :) you can follow these steps or this question. Tell me if there's something you don't understand :)\n\nA: Yes, of course, you can use gparted. But the problem is that you can not edit a partition when it is mounted so you have to make a usb startup disk first (using e.g. startup disk creator which is also called usb-creator-gtk). If your computer has access to a DVD drive you can burn the ubuntu disk image onto a DVD as well. \nWhen you started the computer with the live disk, open a terminal and enter\nsudo gparted\n\nWhen prompted for password, just press enter and then you can edit the partition table.\nOne general hint (which may not be applicable to your situation) is that it takes much less time if the new partition you create, lies at the end of the original partition and not the beginning (because otherwise gparted has to move all the original partition bit-by-bit). So, just resize the original partition and do not move it, otherwise the job can take a few hours.\nIf you want, you may be able to recover your windows partition using testdisk (before repartitioning of course).\n", "Q: Why is /usr/local/games after /usr/games in the default PATH?

A 12.04 machine of mine does not have it.\nI was really struggling to find where /etc/environment comes from. Turns out it's not a file that's packaged, it's created at install time (I assume to prevent it harming existing configurations during upgrades). Thanks to this answer on Unix.SE, we can see that it's coming from libpam-modules's postinst script.\n# Add PATH to /etc/environment if it's not present there or in\n# /etc/security/pam_env.conf\nif [ \"$1\" = \"configure\" ] && dpkg --compare-versions \"$2\" lt 1.1.3-7ubuntu3; then\n        if ! grep -qs ^PATH /etc/security/pam_env.conf; then\n                if ! grep -qs ^PATH= /etc/environment; then\n                        echo 'PATH=\"/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games\"' >> /etc/environment\n                elif ! grep -qs \"^PATH=.*/usr/local/games\" /etc/environment; then\n                        sed -i '/^PATH=/ s,:/usr/games,:/usr/games:/usr/local/games,g' /etc/environment\n                fi\n        fi\nfi\n\nSo yeah, I'd suggest reporting a bug against pam.\n", "Q: Unity-Dash Problem I have an Asus x64J Laptop with 2 graphic cards (intel + nvidia).

My computer is dual boot with Ubuntu 13.10 and Windows 8, but when I open NTFS partition in Ubuntu, crap files like: System Volume Information $RECYCLE.BIN appear.

Even you remove,  they will come again. \n\nA: Those files are windows system files. They're hidden in windows by default. That's why you don't see them in windows but they do exist.

MaxClientsNumber = 50 -> open 100 passive ports.\n\n*Ports have to be in a free port range (not used on your machine by another service yet and not used by any other standard service). \n\n*Passive port range examples: 29100-29200 or 32770-32870 or 42420-42520 or 51899-51999. See full list of standard IP ports here. Check for used ports on your machine with sudo iptables -nvL.\n\n\n*Open ports in firewall:\nMay I suggest using UFW additionally to iptables? This will mak setting firewall rules much easier for you and also makes your rules presistent.\nWhenever changing things on your firewall, take care not to lockout yourself from your machine! Check for port 22/ssh to be open if you are connected via ssh.\nInstall UFW, deny any incoming traffic (first close everything, then just open the ports needed), open port 22/ssh, then start UFW:\nsudo apt-get install ufw\nsudo ufw default deny incoming\nsudo ufw default allow outgoing\nsudo ufw allow ssh\nsudo ufw enable\n\nOpen ports for FTP: (please replace 42420:42520 with your own ports.)\nsudo ufw allow ftp\nsudo ufw allow proto tcp from any to any port 42420:42520\n\nOpen ports for your webserver:\nsudo ufw allow http\nsudo ufw allow https\n\nOpen ports for your mailserver: (maybe you don't need all those ports. for good advice see here.)\nsudo ufw allow 25\nsudo ufw allow 110\nsudo ufw allow 143\nsudo ufw allow 465\nsudo ufw allow 587\nsudo ufw allow 993\nsudo ufw allow 995\nsudo ufw allow 4190\n\nFinally check your settings and enable them permamently:\nsudo ufw status verbose\nsudo ufw disable\nsudo ufw enable\n\n\n*Last step: Check again if UFW install did take care of all your prior iptables rules – and if it did not, then remove them manually.\niptables -nvL --line numbers\niptables -D INPUT X\n\nReplace X with the line number you've read from the output of the first command and repeat (both commands!) for each iptables rule you want to delete.\nEspecially check for this iptables rule on the IPUT chain again (as seen on your data above) with option '-v' sudo iptables -nvL\nACCEPT     all  --  0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0\n\nIf you see column that reads 'lo' in this line then everything is fine and nothing needs to be done here. If there's no 'lo' in this line, this could mean your firewall will accept all traffic on all ports (as if you had no firewall at all) and it should be removed.\nNow you should have Pure-FTPd accepting passive ports and UFW setup as simple to handle firewall management.\n", "Q: Desktop hard drive won't spin down according to settings I have a desktop machine with two SSDs, one each with Windows 8.1 and Ubuntu 13.10, and one HDD which contains a single NTFS partition on which I throw big files.

If the latter, can anyone suggest a more lightweight desktop environment than Xfce.\nAfter visiting the same website on my 64-bit desktop with 8GB RAM, Firefox did not eat more than 150MB, so I guess Firefox put all images on the graphics card and the laptop does not have great graphics performance.\nI tried opening https://student.portal.chalmers.se/_layouts/Chalmers.Core.UI/images/box-light-map2.png which is a background image that automatically loads. You have been warned if you are low on memory!\nThe implementation of the webpage layout has now changed, and now it is possible to visit the page.\n\nA: Yes, Xubuntu is more resource hungry the Windows XP. Xubuntu is comparable to Windows Vista in look and feel. Lubuntu is comparable to Windows XP in look and feel. Your computer has enough RAM to run Xubuntu. The minimum systems requirements for Xubuntu are 512MB RAM. I have also noticed the Xubuntu has difficulty managing some websites in Firefox with only 512MB RAM.

For 'xkb' sources the second string is\n  'xkb_layout+xkb_variant' or just 'xkb_layout' if a XKB variant isn't\n  needed. For 'ibus' sources the second string is the IBus engine name.\n  An empty list means that the X server's current XKB layout and variant\n  won't be touched and IBus won't be used.\n\nBut as it works still, I'll leave it until it explodes or something.\nUpdate:\nSetting it to this also works:\n[('ibus', 'gb')]\n\nWeird.\n\nA: I had a similar, very odd issue recently (also in 13.10), where suddenly one day it refused to acknowledge I was using the UK layout (it was trying to force the US one on me, as it seems to be with you - \\ instead of #, etc.).\nThe fix was also slightly odd, but could well sort this out in a similar way. Essentially, go to the Text Entry settings menu as you did already in the question, and add a new layout by clicking the \"+\" button in the bottom-left  (any layout will do - we'll be taking it away later.) Then, remove \"English (UK)\" from the list by selecting it and clicking the minus button.\nThen, re-add \"English (UK)\" using the same method as before, and remove the dummy layout you added before. In my case, this seemed to remind the computer of the layout it should actually be using, and it has worked fine ever since.\n", "Q: Map AltGr-[a..z] and Shift-AltGr-[A..Z] to greek letter I'm on Ubuntu trusty, and I use greek letters for algebra. I'd love to be able to type them in quickly with Alt Gr-letterKey.\nFor example, map alpha to Alt Gr-A, map beta to Alt Gr-B, map theta to Alt Gr-T, etc.\nThis page explains how to do it on an earlier version of Ubuntu. When I try following it, I can go to System Settings -> Keyboard -> Typing -> Compose Key.\nBut when I get to Compose Key, it says that it's 'disabled'. Nothing happens when I click the row and hold down new keys, nor when I press backspace to clear. Even if it did work, I don't see how that would enable to me to re-assign Alt Gr-[A..Z].\nCan anyone help?\n\nA: Enable Compose Key in dconf-editor to set up AltGr\nWithin dconf-editor go to org>gnome>desktop>input sources. Edit the entry xkb-options to set the Compose Key you wish, such as ['compose:ralt'].\nThis earlier answer includes terminal commands as well: Make \"super/window\" as compose key in Ubuntub\nUsing Compose Key will give you lots of additional characters quickly but Greek letters are not included without additional keystrokes.\nFor quick access to Greek letters use IBus to switch between your usual keyboard layout and the Greek alphabet. IBus may appear in your main menu as \"Keyboard Input Methods\". You can install it with sudo apt-get install ibus.\nAfter you start IBus add the \"Greek, Modern\" layout under the \"Input Method\" tab. In the \"General\" tab you'll find the method to quickly switch keyboard layout. In my case it's Win+Space. By pressing that combination you immediately switch to Greek layout and pressing a gives α (alpha). \nWith this method you stay with Greek until you switch back to your home layout with Win+Space.\n\nA: This is a long answer. If you want a TL;DR version --- xmodmap is sort-of deprecated; layout switches will reset it; go to the section called \"and finally, I did it\" at the end for my solution.\nI suppose you have your AltGr-something working already. It will depend on your keyboard configuration to have it activated or not. On my PCs, it works with Spanish and US-International but NOT on plain US keyboard. \nThe method I use is with xmodmap, but it works only partially: if it works or not  will depend on your layout and even then it will be reset every time you change layout. See later for the \"real\" (but complex) solution. \nYou can use xmodmap by following these steps: \n1) In a terminal issue\nxmodmap -pke > mykeydefs.lst\n\n(extension and name free --- use what you like)  \n2) edit the file; you will see a bunch of lines like...\nkeycode   8 =\nkeycode   9 = Escape NoSymbol Escape\nkeycode  10 = 1 exclam 1 exclam bar exclamdown\nkeycode  11 = 2 quotedbl 2 at at oneeighth\nkeycode  12 = 3 periodcentered 3 numbersign numbersign sterling\n\nThese are your keyboard definitions. Find for example the entry for A: \nkeycode  38 = a A a A ae AE\n\nThis means that pressing this key you have \"a\", shift+key \"A\", etc... the interesting ones are the 5th and 6th (1), which are normally associated to ALtGr and Shift+AltGR. Pressing AltGR + A you should have the symbol \"æ\".\nIf you have more than 6 entries, try to see which ones are activate by your AltGR combination: for example, if you have \nkeycode  38 = a A a A ae AE aring Aring\n\nand you have an å when pressing AltGr-A, the entry to modify will be the 7th and 8th...\n3) change the line to \nkeycode  38 = a A a A Greek_alpha Greek_ALPHA\n\n(capitalization is important). You can edit all the lines you want; it is better if you delete all the lines you left untouched. The list of all the symbols is here, but take into account that if they are visible or not depend on the font you are using, too. Save the file. \n4) Reload the new mapping\nxmodmap mykeydefs.lst\n\nThis command must be silent --- if it shows any error, the map is not loaded.\n5) test it. Now pressing AltGr + a should give the symbol alpha (well, alpha letter greek in Unicode, really).\n6) if it works, you can set the command in the list of your startup commands. \nThe real solution (hints at it, at least)\nIf the xmodmap method does not work, you'll need to edit your keyboard layout. I have found some interesting links:\n\n\n*\n\n*An howto and a thread on creating your own keyboard layout. \n\n*A quite complete guide to the XKB system.\n\n*A blog entry on making local modifications to your layout. \nAnd finally, I did it:\n\n\n*A little example of a direct modification to the system files (I could not find how to do that in your local ~/.xkb directory). \n\n*A nice configuration to have all the greek letters with a single modifier.\n\nFootnotes:\n\n(1) by the way, in all manuals and instructions around it is said the \"mode_shift\" chars should be the third and the fourth. Which on Ubuntu are not, and I can't really find any documentation with details. If anyone can point it to me, I will be grateful.\n", "Q: Steam not letting me make new folders I'm trying to make a folder on my data drive for my steam games and I keep getting this \n\"New Steam library must be on a file system mounted with execute permissions\"\n\nA: It's just like Steam says: the drive has to have executable permissions. You can edit your fstab file or use the disk utility to handle that for you.

My BIND9 is currently running fine but is there a way to set the expiration time/date of the cached names? If so, how?\nThanks in advance guys\n\nA: Each DNS record already contains a Time To Live (TTL) value that specifies the number of seconds it may be cached for, and the SOA record for the zone contains the TTL for negative results.\nWhenever a result is forwarded from a DNS that is not the authoritative server for the zone, the TTL is reduced by the time that the result had been cached already.\nFor example, when I resolve google.de:\ngoogle.de.              300     IN      A       216.58.205.227\n\nIf I do it again ten seconds later:\ngoogle.de.              290     IN      A       216.58.205.227\n\nThe original TTL of the record was most likely 300, and my provider's DNS cached it after I first asked, and returned the cached result to me on the second iteration.\nSo, lifetime is tracked per record.\nWhen you run your own DNS server, there are two ways for it to resolve names: using a forwarder, or doing a hierarchical lookup.\nWhen you use a forwarder, your server simply queries another caching server, and will get a cached result with a shortened TTL if the other server already has a copy of that record. There is no way to tell the age of that cached entry, only when it is supposed to expire.\nWhen you do recursive lookups yourself, you are pretty much guaranteed to get fresh results, at the expense of having to do a lookup for every path component on the way. If your link has a high round-trip time (GPRS or satellite link), it is likely that the original request from the application will time out before your server has had a chance to get the result.\nIn either case, you can limit the TTL for cached records on your server using the max-cache-ttl and max-ncache-ttl settings in BIND.\nIn a forwarder setup, this will not help much, because all it will do is make your server query the forwarder again, which will reply with the cached value if it is still valid.\nIn a recursive setup, this will shorten the time your server caches results — but all results on all levels. So after that timeout has elapsed, it will re-do the full recursive query.\nGenerally, DNS administrators take great care to set adequate TTLs on records, for example I will use 60 seconds on the records I use to find my home network, while my servers have a TTL of one day. When I plan to move a server, I will reduce its TTL to an hour on the day before, and to five minutes before I leave for the datacenter, so you will get reasonable TTLs from caches. Second-guessing me will only give you degraded performance as your DNS refreshes entries unnecessarily. If some records are often outdated, that is a configuration problem on the other person's end, not on your side.\ntl;dr: you can, but you shouldn't.\n\nA: The expiration time is known as the \"TTL\" or time to live. You set this variable in you configuration file, typically /etc/bind/db.local or whatever config file you are using.\nTTL is in seconds, so set it to a lower value, 60x60 = 3600 for an hour for examlpe\nsudo -e /etc/bind/db.local\n\nSet the ttl:\n\n$TTL 3600\n\nand restart bind.\nFor additional information see:\nHow do I do a complete BIND9 DNS Server Configuration with a hostname?\nand\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/10.04/serverguide/dns-configuration.html\n", "Q: How can I get Awesome WM to display GNOME wallpapers on tags 2-9?

Here are the steps I followed so far (with no success in booting in 13.10):\n\n\n*\n\n*The Vaio came with Win 8 pre-installed so I created an image.\n\n*I used an Ubuntu 13.10 (64bit) live USB to try ubuntu and installed it in the system wiping out win 8 in the process.\n\n*I tried to boot ubuntu with no success, cannot find the operating system error message\nso I\n\n*Used the image CDs to get win 8 back again.\n\n\nSecond attempt I follow step 2 above, but I try to follow the instructions in http://steffankarger.nl/2013/12/10/ubuntu-13-10-on-the-sony-vaio-pro-13/ with no success.\nTrying to update grub gave me an error.\nThen I found this: 13.10 doesn't boot on Vaio Pro 13\nSo I followed the advise and ran boot repair. The output can be found here: http://paste.ubuntu.com/6949962/\nI still cannot boot into ubuntu. Moreover, I cannot seem to get to bios settings (assist key will not work), neither I can run ubuntu via the live usb any more. Using the recovery image CDs doesn't work either.\nAny ideas? \n\nA: You can fully shut down the laptop by holding down the power button for 5 seconds. Then start it with the assist button. If that does not work, you can hold shift down when you click on reboot in windows. this should take you to a special menu. there you can reboot in bios (select advanced tools). in bios disable secure boot and set the boot mode to legacy (change from UEFI).\nThe only way I could install ubuntu was with an external optical drive (usb dvd-rom). just let it boot and don't select anything until the install/try menu appears. After this, proceed normally.\nCheers!\n", "Q: OpenCV Build Error: \"Cannot open options file specified with @\" I am having trouble installing OpenCV on my machine.

You can use the built-in VNC feature. Ubuntu’s remote desktop technology is based on the existing VNC standard. This means you can connect to a Ubuntu remote desktop using any VNC client. There are more than a few VNC clients around, so if you have a favorite on any platform you can use that to connect to Ubuntu already.

This might do better at StackExchange but I use Ubuntu as my file server.\nSo I'm trying to use tar and gzip to only backup the last 6 months of changes on my file server and it isn't working.

This affects not only the\n       visible hyperlinks, but any part of the document that links to\n       external content, such as embedded images, links to style sheets,\n       hyperlinks to non-HTML content, etc.\n\n       Each link will be changed in one of the two ways:\n\n       ·   The links to files that have been downloaded by Wget will be\n           changed to refer to the file they point to as a relative link.\n\n           Example: if the downloaded file /foo/doc.html links to\n           /bar/img.gif, also downloaded, then the link in doc.html will\n           be modified to point to ../bar/img.gif.  This kind of\n           transformation works reliably for arbitrary combinations of\n           directories.\n\n       ·   The links to files that have not been downloaded by Wget will\n           be changed to include host name and absolute path of the\n           location they point to.\n\n           Example: if the downloaded file /foo/doc.html links to\n           /bar/img.gif (or to ../bar/img.gif), then the link in doc.html\n           will be modified to point to http://hostname/bar/img.gif.\n\n       Because of this, local browsing works reliably: if a linked file\n       was downloaded, the link will refer to its local name; if it was\n       not downloaded, the link will refer to its full Internet address\n       rather than presenting a broken link.  The fact that the former\n       links are converted to relative links ensures that you can move the\n       downloaded hierarchy to another directory.\n\nA: If you view the page source of the online page in your browser, you'll see that the links are relative in the document. The browser converts them automatically, but wget can't do this.\nTo have the page display correctly in a browser, the solution would be to use the HTML <​base> Tag. Just add <base href=\"http://maine.craigslist.org/fuo\"> to the head section of the downloaded files and all links will point to the correct absolute location. You can do this automatically in your script.\nIf you want your script to perform further actions on the links, the best solution would be to have the script add the base url in front of each link.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro boots from 8GB start-up USB, but not from external drive I have what seems to be an odd anomaly on my hands.

You will need have the computer on (or with Wake On LAN), and connected to the network for it to work. A constant IP address (internal + external) also helps.\nTo find the IP addresses, there are a few answers here.\n\nA: There is no need to set up any ftp server at all, you can use ssh.\nFrom a Linux client, use sshfs\n\nAlternatively you can mount a directory over SSHFS using the Gnome \"Connect to Server\" tool in the desktop Places menu. In the tool, set the service type to SSH and fill in the boxes as needed. If a password is required when connecting then you will be prompted for it. Unmounting a SSHFS connection is the same as for any other volume. Open the File Browser (Nautilus). In the Places panel on the left click the arrow next to the SSHFS mount you want to disconnect or right-click it and select \"Unmount\". \n\nSee https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSHFS for details\nFrom a Windows client, use Winscp\nhttp://winscp.net/eng/index.php\n\n\nA: I'd recommend the use of scp. scp is Secure Copy, which uses SSH to transfer files.  As such, you can ensure your transfers are encrypted and authenticated users are the only people able to upload files.\nThis does not address any security concerns for users that you do not trust very much.  In the case that you need to allow non-trusted users access, you might want to look into Virtualization (VM) or chroot. \n", "Q: Problem using “sudo su” command I can't login as root, this is what happens:\ngladiss@gladiss-Lenovo-G580:~$ sudo su\nsudo: /usr/lib/sudo/sudoers.so must be only be writable by owner\nsudo: fatal error, unable to load plugins\n\nI've tried all commands suggested in similar threads. Nothing helped.\nMaybe cause this:\n\n\nA: You can also use \"sudo -i\" to login as root.\n\nA: \nsudo: /usr/lib/sudo/sudoers.so must be only be writable by owner\n\nIt seems the file /usr/lib/sudo/sudoers.so has the wrong permissions. It should be writable only by the owner, but apparently that's not the case. Confirm the permission bits shown by:\nls -l /usr/lib/sudo/sudoers.so\n\nThe integrity of the sudoers.so library is critical for the security of the system, that's why all sudo commands are automatically rejected, as a safety feature.\nTo fix the permissions you would have to become root, one way or another. Do you have a root password? Probably not. Start the system in rescue mode, and boot a live CD and mount your disk, fix the permissions and reboot.\nPerhaps even more important is to find out how this happened.

However, I can't log in using this command as su guest. I can auto-complete this as su guest-<some_id>, but this asks for a password I am unaware of.\nHow do I login, then, as the guest user?\n\nA: Ubuntu \"guest users\" are added and deleted on the fly. They are account without passwords (and locked so).

Among them, the internet connection. I tried to restart in recovery mode. I found out that many packages were missing (many of them python packages). However, since my internet access doesn't work (I can't connect with ubuntu), I can't download them. How can I fix these packages?\n\nA: As you don't have any possibility to download the packages, you could reinstall them from your Setup CD/Stick. (I don't know how but I know it's possible)\nSince some of your software may be upgraded to 13.10 and some is still 13.04, this could result in some kind of \"hybride system\". To avoid such problems, the best way to do this is to setup your PC from scratch. (Get a Ubuntu Saucy ISO and install it over the existing system)\nWhatever you do, create a backup of your personal files before doing anything else!\n", "Q: Check disk benchmark result with the disk running the OS Is there a way to check my disks benchmark results that's currently running the Ubuntu I'm on?

There are many nefarious things that can be done and your question is very broad.\nIf you're in need of a simple, secure solution, you can create an SSH Tunnel between your computer and a trusted host, but again, you've got to trust that host's LAN.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.10 problems with NVidia graphics drivers, XServer not going up I had problem with running Age of Empires II on wine. It was showing some problem with loading some NVidia file (I cannot make this error again), and was suggesting using Nouveau drivers, even if I was using them.\nI decided to reinstall the NVidia drivers, and install the newest one. I used that tutorial: http://news.softpedia.com/news/How-to-Install-the-Latest-NVIDIA-331-20-Drivers-in-Ubuntu-13-10-399182.shtml .\nAfter installation and reboot, my XServer was not going up anymore. Using the console I removed all the nvidia drivers : sudo apt-get purge nvidia-*. With that, the system is working again, but the resolution is low.\nAfter that, I removed repository from that tutorial, and installed the nvidia drivers again, but it happens every time - the XServer is not going up, and I need to remove NVidia drivers.\nWhat can I do?\nADDITIONAL INFO:\nwhen I try to install nvidia-current drivers with apt-get, I get that info:\nSome packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have\nrequested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable\ndistribution that some required packages have not yet been created\nor been moved out of Incoming.\nThe following information may help to resolve the situation:\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies.\n nvidia-current : Depends: xorg-video-abi-11 but it is not installable or\n                           xorg-video-abi-12 but it is not installable or\n                           xorg-video-abi-13 but it is not installable\n                  Recommends: nvidia-settings-current but it is not installable\nE: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.\nAfter installing it with aptitude the effect is as I described before.\n\nA: If you want your nouveau driver back, you should be aware that is may have been blacklisted when updating to other driver packages designed for Nvidia. You should take a look in \netc/modprobe.d/nvidia-graphics-drivers.conf\nand see if nouveau driver is already blacklisted. Check all other 'graphic..conf' files inside etc/modprobe.d/ to see if nouveau driver is present and blacklisted ( that is if you can't find the original 'nvidia-graphics-drivers.conf' file to be present). If that is the case, then you should edit the file(s). and remove the lines where NOUVEAU driver is present. All you have to do is to remove nvidia drivers using that code you mentioned: \nsudo apt-get remove nvidia*   \nand after that to install NOUVEAU driver using code: \nsudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-nouveau\nBut I suggest that you better try to download one or more linux drivers for your video card from NVIDIA website, and test them after removing all other Nvidia drivers and extra modules, and after you blacklist the nouveau driver and a few others.\nUse this link to learn how to download and install Nvidia drivers from the NVIDIA website, and never again use that nouveau driver or other proprietary drivers.

I've self taught myself using linux (ubuntu), apache, virtual hosts and a few bits with regards to security, though I've yet to put these all together seamlessly.\nI've also learnt the hard way from mistakes made in the past with regards to not setting up user accounts and sites/virtualhosts correctly. I ssh into the server as root (I know, very bad), and created all the virtual hosts and files manually, thus all being owned by root. I've had an old version of joomla exploited and malicious spam code inserted in all my other virtual hosts.\nI'm in the process of moving to a new server and am looking for the correct steps to follow with regards to setting up virtual hosts and users accounts that can access them. Because we use 3rd party software, we have on a occasion needed someone else to ftp into the site to investigate their website files. \nOur current server is version 10.04, however the new server is version 12.04. All website files are setup under \n/home/www/site1.com\n/home/www/site2.com\n/home/www/site3.com\netc\nIn short, I guess this is what I'm after.\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I correctly setup a virtual host and user, so that it only has access to its own files, and not any other virtual host on the server. For example, should that site get exploited with malicious code, it can't infect other sites on the server\n\n*How would I setup users so that they can only ftp into their given files and not access any of the other sites.\nAs mentioned before, there are numerous articles detailing how to do any one of these steps, but nothing that brings them seamlessly together.\nReally appreciate the help anyone can offer. Please feel free to ask for any additional information you may need to give advise. I'm currently following tutorials to setup chroot, however I fear I'm not doing this correctly as I've picked up a few inconsistencies along the way. Am also investigating jailkit.\n\nA: Since question is the top search result in google when asked \"apache virtual host separate user\", I'd like to give a more elaborate answer based on this answer. My answer does not cover the usecase of PHP and CGI (you would use suPHP). It focuses on PHP when used as an apache module.\nYou can use the apache module apache2-mpm-itk. It is available for the current version of apache 2.4. It comes with the directive AssignUserID. This directive defines the user and group a virtual host's request is handled with. This is an example of the apache site configuration I ended up with:\n<VirtualHost *:80>\nServerName www.site1.com\nDocumentRoot /home/www/site1.com\nAssignUserID site1 www-data\nphp_admin_value open_basedir /home/www/site1.com\n...\n</VirtualHost>\n\nOf course, this does only improve security as long as the individual DocumentRoots are owned by their respective users and are not group accesible.\nFor further PHP-related security, scripts are jailed in the DocumentRoot with the open_basedir restriction.\nAs for the backend file access, I prefer SFTP with chroot.\nNote: apache2-mpm-itk is currently incompatible with Apache's http2 module.\n\nA: I don't consider this is an answer to your question myself. But since I can't comment yet, I have to write in the \"answer\" area. I seasonally do web management, one way for me to test and try things out in a safe way is to setup a test environment in a virtual machine (i.e. VirtualBox) or an \"old\" desktop computer. One of the very common problem of newbie web host admins is to understand how web server programs work. In this case I assume you need to understand how Apache works and at least understand the configuration files. I find that Webmin is a very helpful tool - for a newbie - to manage Apache and other services. You have to spend some time to try things out in you test environment so things will become clearer for you. \nComing back your question, I think the answer can well be a tutorial article or a small book. \nCheck out these articles for a start:\nhttps://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-set-up-apache-virtual-hosts-on-ubuntu-12-04-lts\nhttp://www.servermom.org/build-ubuntu-server-a-complete-guide/\n", "Q: How to get Silverlight and Flash 10+ to work in Chromebook and Ubuntu 12.04 with Firefox I would like to watch content from many of TV-station's streaming services.

However, after building the library, there were only the files foo.so, foo.so.1 and foo.so.1.0.8 under /usr/local/lib/. So I created an additional symbolic link to foo.so.1.0.8 named foo.so.0. I checked that /usr/local/lib is included in some file under /etc/ld.so.conf.d/ and started sudo ldconfig.\nUnfortunately ldconfig seems to ignore my self-created symbolic link. ldconfig -v prints only the following line:\n\nfoo.so.1 -> foo.so.1.0.8\n\nldconfig -p prints only the following two lines:\n\nfoo.so.1 (libc6,x86-64) => /usr/local/lib/foo.so.1\nfoo.so (libc6,x86-64) => /usr/local/lib/foo.so\n\nThere is not a blind bit of the file foo.so.0. What do I have to do?\n\nA: TL:DR: Use a version (or build) of the program that supports the installed library version, if possible.\nAs bodhi.zazen says, it's hard to know quite what's going on without the specific exact commands you ran and the output. However, foo.so.0 and foo.so.1 should not be expected to be compatible.\nTo make a program compiled to use major version 0 of a library work with major version 1, it's advisable to rebuild (recompile and relink) the program. Furthermore, the interface a library provides to programs may change, and often does change, across major versions, so this is only sometimes practical.\nUsually it is instead better to install a newer version of the program that supports the library version you want to use, if possible.\nAlternatively, if you can install the old version of the library alongside the new one, that may also get the program to work. (If you're sure no other program uses the currently installed version of the library, then you could uninstall it before installing the old one. If it's provided by an Ubuntu package then you would do this by uninstalling that package. Different major versions of a library often do support being installed at the same time, though.)\nIn cases where you cannot installed the library version the program needs and you're willing to accept serious instability and unpredictable behavior from program, it's occasionally possible to get it to work with the new library by making a copy, naming it like the old library, and editing the version information inside it with a hex editor. I have done this before, but I have never seriously relied on software that was made to work in this way, and you shouldn't either.\nThis answer is deliberately general. Without more details about what program needs the library, how the program is (or can be) installed, and what versions of the library it supports, it's probably not possible to give more detailed advice.\n\nA: From what I remember in ubuntu, just adding symlinks in /usr/local/lib may not be sufficient. We need update ld.so.conf entry corresponding to this to let ldconfig know what symlinks it has to create for us.\nLike bodhi.zazen mentioned, installing from apt is simpler, because apt would very likely setup ld.so.conf files as well.\n", "Q: Trying to run multiple instances of VLC I'm a total noob at Linux (but I'm learning).\nI am trying to run a video presentation - but I need it to run THREE separate Mpeg or AVI videos at precisely the same time and in sync.\nI read http://www.videolan.org/doc/play-howto/en/ch04.html which shows how to address each of the three monitors with each instance of VLC.|\nThe WALL feature seems cool, but I'm using 3 monitors for video output and one for a control panel (please excuse the Windows entomology).\nThe option:\n--vout  allows you to select the video output module.\nseems to be the way to address each video output separately (PLEASE correct me if I'm wrong about this)\nSo what I'm asking is basically this: If I want to run three separate videos, to three separate monitors using ubuntu and VLC, how can I run all three at exactly the same time, and is there a way to get them to sync? (MIDI, smpte time code, etc?)\nI need just one channel of either mono or stereo audio to run from (let's say) the first video file.\nAny and all input would be VERY welcome. (But please keep in mind, I'm rather new at linux, so please have patience with me)\nThanks in Advance,\nRik\n\nA: I don't have multiple monitors so I can't help you there. As far as opening 3 videos at the same time the closest I can suggest would be using \"&\" to open the files sequentially. They won't be in sync, but because they are opened 1 after the other very quickly they will be very very close to in sync, most likely resulting in a slight echo like sound. Of course this assumes the video file aren't ones that strain the system and that they are stored on a storage device capable of feeding the data rate of 3 videos at once. If not the out-of-sync gap between players will be more apparent. For example I tested this with 2 1080p 70mb mp4 files in a virtual machine, and they were almost in sync, a slight echo was the only indication they weren't. However when I attempted 3 the gap became larger because it was a 1080p video running 3 instanced in a vm, and vms don't get good performance. Keep in mind that this will only help you open the file, it not give you control over where the video's appear on your desktop screen. I believe the default is they layer instances over each other.\nExample (assumes video file is called \"example\" and is located in your user accounts download folder):\n\"vlc /home/username/Downloads/example.mp4 & vlc /home/username/Downloads/example2.mp4 & vlc /home/username/Downloads/example3.mp4\"\n\nA: Here one way but you can more advance with this, create a shell script doing this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch VLC instance through command line, save their PID's.\n\n*Use wmctrl to get WID for each VLC windows and save them.\n\n*Use wmctrl to displace the window or even use xdotool to send the required keys for that like a macro.\n\n*Use xdotool to send key signal for each instance window to play on same time, difference should be in milliseconds. xdotool can send it in a single command.\n\n\nYou can go far using Media Player Remote Interfacing Specification (MPRIS) or keep it simple by doing some steps manually. Keeping time/benefit in balance. \n", "Q: How do I speed up searches in files? I know that on windows you can index your files to find things faster.

My laptop (Asus K53SV) is still overheating, so obviously Nvidia GT 540M is on.\nShould I do something after upgrading kernel to make it work?\nEDIT\nI read this page: http://nouveau.freedesktop.org/wiki/Optimus/\nWhen I type: cat /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch it turns out that my discrete card has status DynPwr all the time, instead of DynOff. Why is that?\n\nA: By what I know 12.04.3 have it working out of box with driver 319 as you can se in \nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2174499\nit is interesting as it use prime what can lead to better performance... \nIm on 13.10 and relying on bumblebee...\nWithout bumblebee my Dell overheat too as the nvidia is on... Even if doing nothing at all\nUpdate:\nwell I make some extra simple research on google and found more info\nhttp://www.webupd8.org/2013/08/using-nvidia-graphics-drivers-with.html\nas said in webupd8... Apparently 13.10 have support, but isn't out of box by what they can see, because it have some issues still\n", "Q: INTEL CPU turbo boost pegged at its clock-speed sometimes I have a ubuntu 12.04 LTS server running at 2 INTEL xeon E5-2620v2 processors.\nAt busy time the turbo boost will work: (monitor with turbostat I get:)\npk cor CPU    %c0  GHz  TSC SMI    %c1    %c3    %c6    %c7 CTMP PTMP   %pc2   %pc3   %pc6   %pc7  Pkg_W  Cor_W RAM_W PKG_% RAM_%\n\n            86.04 2.25 2.10   0  13.00   0.18   0.78   0.00   65   65   0.00   0.00   0.00   0.00  70.16  44.67 12.27  0.00  0.00\n\n 0   0   0  90.06 2.40 2.10   0   9.94   0.00   0.00   0.00   61   62   0.00   0.00   0.00   0.00  37.60  24.81  6.65  0.00  0.00\n\n 0   0  12  95.81 2.40 2.10   0   4.19\n\n 0   1   1  86.58 2.40 2.10   0  12.77   0.16   0.49   0.00   58\n\n 0   1  13  84.33 2.40 2.10   0  15.02\n\n 0   2   2  86.17 2.40 2.10   0  12.91   0.21   0.70   0.00   57\n\n 0   2  14  82.83 2.40 2.10   0  16.25\n\n 0   3   3  86.54 2.40 2.10   0  12.35   0.14   0.97   0.00   62\n\n 0   3  15  85.89 2.40 2.10   0  13.00\n\n 0   4   4  84.26 2.40 2.10   0  14.97   0.31   0.47   0.00   62\n\n 0   4  16  85.31 2.40 2.10   0  13.91\n\n 0   5   5  85.75 2.40 2.10   0  13.36   0.10   0.79   0.00   55\n\n 0   5  17  84.65 2.40 2.10   0  14.46\n\n 1   0   6  85.73 2.10 2.10   0  13.14   0.25   0.87   0.00   64   65   0.00   0.00   0.00   0.00  32.55  19.86  5.62  0.00  0.00\n\n 1   0  18  84.96 2.10 2.10   0  13.91\n\n 1   1   7  85.13 2.10 2.10   0  13.67   0.24   0.96   0.00   65\n\n 1   1  19  85.62 2.10 2.10   0  13.18\n\n 1   2   8  86.23 2.10 2.10   0  12.22   0.30   1.25   0.00   63\n\n 1   2  20  85.05 2.10 2.10   0  13.40\n\n 1   3   9  87.43 2.10 2.10   0  11.46   0.14   0.97   0.00   60\n\n 1   3  21  84.09 2.10 2.10   0  14.80\n\n 1   4  10  84.61 2.10 2.10   0  14.19   0.13   1.07   0.00   58\n\n 1   4  22  86.24 2.10 2.10   0  12.55\n\n 1   5  11  84.93 2.10 2.10   0  14.11   0.16   0.80   0.00   60\n\n 1   5  23  86.67 2.10 2.10   0  12.37\n\nAs you can see the pkg 0 all 12 cpus turbo frequency to 2.4G. \n\n\nBut I also find at busy time cpu pegged and my application get worst performance.\n\npk cor CPU    %c0  GHz  TSC SMI    %c1    %c3    %c6    %c7 CTMP PTMP   %pc2   %pc3   %pc6   %pc7  Pkg_W  Cor_W RAM_W PKG_% RAM_%\n\n            81.56 2.10 2.10   0  17.54   0.15   0.75   0.00   64   64   0.02   0.00  0.00   0.00  63.74  38.62 10.50  0.00  0.00\n\n 0   0   0  88.05 2.10 2.10   0  11.95   0.00   0.00   0.00   56   57   0.00   0.00   0.00   0.00  32.16  19.50  6.24  0.00  0.00\n\n 0   0  12  96.44 2.10 2.10   0   3.56\n\n 0   1   1  82.42 2.10 2.10   0  16.89   0.15   0.55   0.00   54\n\n 0   1  13  82.60 2.10 2.10   0  16.70\n\n 0   2   2  84.48 2.10 2.10   0  15.04   0.11   0.37   0.00   51\n\n 0   2  14  81.57 2.10 2.10   0  17.94\n\n 0   3   3  83.53 2.10 2.10   0  15.61   0.13   0.72   0.00   54\n\n 0   3  15  82.76 2.10 2.10   0  16.38\n\n 0   4   4  84.55 2.10 2.10   0  14.80   0.12   0.53   0.00   57\n\n 0   4  16  81.77 2.10 2.10   0  17.58\n\n 0   5   5  82.58 2.10 2.10   0  16.97   0.03   0.41   0.00   51\n\n 0   5  17  80.30 2.10 2.10   0  19.25\n\n 1   0   6  77.37 2.10 2.10   0  21.37   0.30   0.96   0.00   60   64   0.03   0.00   0.00   0.00  31.58  19.12  4.26  0.00  0.00\n\n 1   0  18  78.15 2.10 2.10   0  20.60\n\n 1   1   7  78.57 2.10 2.10   0  20.11   0.21   1.11   0.00   64\n\n 1   1  19  77.48 2.10 2.10   0  21.19\n\n 1   2   8  80.80 2.10 2.10   0  17.75   0.20   1.26   0.00   60\n\n 1   2  20  78.09 2.10 2.10   0  20.45\n\n 1   3   9  77.46 2.10 2.10   0  21.31   0.27   0.97   0.00   57\n\n 1   3  21  77.07 2.10 2.10   0  21.70\n\n 1   4  10  81.03 2.10 2.10   0  17.64   0.13   1.20   0.00   57\n\n 1   4  22  80.29 2.10 2.10   0  18.38\n\n 1   5  11  81.34 2.10 2.10   0  17.56   0.17   0.93   0.00   59\n\n 1   5  23  78.70 2.10 2.10   0  20.20\n\nas you can see pkg 0 and 1 all 24 cpus pegged at 2.1G\nAt this time I do not noticed high temperature nor high Watt. \nAre there any suggestion?\n\nA: Looking at specs:\nhttp://www.cpu-world.com/CPUs/Xeon/Intel-Xeon%20E5-2620%20v2.html\nTurbo is:\n2.6 all cores in action\n2.4 if one core\n2.2 nominal, same as TSC\nMonitoring CPU works by sampling counters, the shortest is the window, the more accurate are the values. This goes so fast that at time of reading, the tool may report last state. Thus, during reading, you can provide load to CPUs on 1, 2, ..., all cores and compare with idle state (no desktop)\nYou will have to pine one of your benchmark software to the selected core : recommend 'cpuset' and linpack.c\nPerhaps you may also try my code. It has been however programmed with a Core i7 but using the cpuset command you may pined it to a Xeon package ID\nOnce started it will show you CPUs cycles through the fixed performance counters, and by the way frequencies, ratios (including Turbo), C-states %, temperatures and kernel task monitoring beside each Core threads. All of that with graphics\nYou can check which applications is guilty to burns your CPUs, or idle stage. \nUsing [+] [-] buttons, you can decrease, increase, sleep time between each counters reading loop, down to 50000 usecs\nSource code is available at http://code.google.com/p/xfreq/\nHope it will help you to investigate your issue\n", "Q: boots and sits at grub rescue To Reinstall Grub:\nTried the below first.\nTo add boot-repair to the repository\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair\n\nOnce Installation completes, run boot-repair on terminal by typing the following command or select it by System → Administration → Boot Repair.\nboot-repair\n\nI just tried the above but it still went to back to the prompt grub rescue.

But you do not need to source the whole ~/.bashrc every time you want to change your prompt. You just need to change PS1 for that. Instead of aliases just use two functions that set PS1 accordingly and save the state (or rather the matching function call) in ~/.bashrcpl :\nshortp () {\n    PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\\[\\033[0;32m\\]➤\\[\\033[01;34m\\] '\n    echo shortp > ~/.bashrcpl\n}\n\nlongp () {\n    if [[ ${EUID} -eq 0 ]]; then\n        PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\\[\\033[0;31m\\]\\u\\[\\033[0;32m\\]@\\[\\033[0;36m\\]\\h\\[\\033[0;32m\\]:\\[\\033[01;34m\\]\\w\\[\\033[0;31m\\]➤\\[\\033[1;31m\\]➤\\[\\033[0;32m\\]➤\\[\\033[01;34m\\] '\n    else\n        PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\\[\\033[1;31m\\]\\u\\[\\033[0;32m\\]@\\[\\033[0;36m\\]\\h\\[\\033[0;32m\\]:\\[\\033[01;34m\\]\\w\\[\\033[0;31m\\]➤\\[\\033[1;31m\\]➤\\[\\033[0;32m\\]➤\\[\\033[01;34m\\] '\n    fi\n    echo longp > ~/.bashrcpl\n}\n\nsource ~/.bashrcpl\n\nThe last line loads the last prompt used (The file is sourced and the appropriate function is called). \nSaving the state is only needed in order to load a new shell with the last set prompt. If you do not need this feature just remove both lines with echo and replace source ~/.bashrcpl with either shortp or longp, whichever you prefer.\nNote: I removed the check for $color_prompt. Unless $color_prompt is exported in ~/.bashrc it will not be availble when running either function in the interactive shell. You can always add another function for a monochrome prompt, if you need it.\n", "Q: Overheating when using File Roller Every time I try to compress a folder of about 1 Gb with File Roller I have to stop after a few seconds because my laptop overheats.

CPU temperature should not be that high even if the CPU is under heavy load.\nlm-sensors is required for Psensor to read the fan speed.  Another easy way is to hear if there is a difference in the noise when the CPU is idle and when File Roller is running.

I installed arping (sudo apt-get install arping) which removed iputils-arping, network-manager, and network-manager-gnome. I edited the /etc/network/interface file to setup a manual IP for eth0. \n# interfaces(5) file used by ifup(8) and ifdown(8)\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\n# below are my changes\n\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\n    address x.x.x.x\n    gateway y.y.y.y\n    netmask z.z.z.z\n    network a.a.a.a\n    broadcast b.b.b.b\n    dns-nameserver c.c.c.c d.d.d.d\n\nChange x, y, z, a, c, and d to your network settings. I then ran \"sudo service network-interface restart INTERFACE=eth0\" to restart the interface. This allowed my to reinstall network manager (sudo apt-get install network-manager). I had to purge the arping package I installed before network manager would reinstall. Then start network manager (sudo service network-manager start). Once I had network manager running I changed /etc/network/interface back to default (and kept a copy of the manual change just in case). Hopefully this helps.\n\nA: Just solved this same problem, follow these simple steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download network-manager in a device having internet connection from\nhttp://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/n/network-manager/\nI used network-manager_1.2.2-0ubuntu0.16.04.4_amd64.deb for ubuntu16.04\n\n*Then transfer this file using USB or phone etc.\n\n*$ sudo dpkg -i network-manager_1.2.2-0ubuntu0.16.04.4_amd64.deb \nIt may happen that the wifi shortcut might be missing on the top, for that just use this command\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop and then a normal restart of your machine.\nDone :)\n\nA: If you've recently upgraded your network manager you can use sudo apt-get install --reinstall network-manager, but this only works if the package is still in your Apt cache (/var/cache/apt/archives/). I'm guessing you haven't so you'll have to do things the long way, but I thought I'd throw that in just in case.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot a Ubuntu live CD in \"Try without installing\". Make sure you are connected to the internet.\n\n*In terminal type:\nsudo mount --bind /dev /<chrootlocation>/dev\nsudo mount --bind /proc /<chrootlocation>/proc\nsudo mount --bind /sys /<chrootlocation>/sys\nsudo cp /etc/resolv.conf /<chrootlocation>/etc/resolv.conf\nsudo chroot /<chrootlocation>\n\nYou will need to replace <chrootlocation> with the appropriate location of your Ubuntu install, typically the label of the partition it's installed on. The partition must also be mounted so that you can access it.\n\n*Edit your /etc/resolve.conf and add at least one nameserver:\nnameserver 8.8.8.8 # Google Public DNS\n\n\n*In terminal type:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install network-manager\n\nIf you don't you'll likely get an unable to connect error.\n\n*In terminal type exit. This exits you from the chroot environment.\n\n*In terminal type sudo reboot to reboot your computer.\n\nA: My previous answer assumes that the reason you cannot access the internet is because you uninstalled \"network-manager\", and that normally the computer is connnected to the internet. However on the off chance that I read your question wrong, and this is in fact a computer that isn't ever connected to the internet you will need to use this answer instead though it will be more time consuming.\nStep #1 = On another computer (It can be running Windows, doesn't matter), go to \"http://packages.ubuntu.com/precise/network-manager\". (This link assumes you are using Ubuntu 12.04, if not you will need to find the link appropriate to your version). \nStep #2 = At the bottom of the web page there is a link for \"amd64\" and \"i386\", click on the approriate one. I'm using amd64 so my steps will assume that.\nStep #3 = On the new page there are a bunch of mirror links that are direct download links for \"network-manager_0.9.4.0-0ubuntu3_amd64.deb\". Pick a link, and download the .deb file.\nStep #4 = On the first url I provided it also lists the dependencies for network-manager. You may have some of these still installed, but for the ones you don't you will need to download them as well by visiting their page and selecting a mirror.\nStep #5 = Once you've downloaded all the .debs you will be needing transfer them to the Ubuntu computer and put them in \"/var/cache/apt/archives\". You will need root privileges to do this which can be achieved with \"gksu nautilus /var/cache/apt/archives\". You could also use dpkg to install them, but it won't tell if you've forgetten a dependency so I'm not going to get into how to use that.\nStep #6 = In terminal type \"sudo apt-get install --reinstall network-manager\".\n\nA: This answer assumes that you had internet access before losing network-manager or any other packages.\nLive CD/DVD/USB\nCreate a bootable Ubuntu CD/DVD or USB stick, boot from it and select \"Try Ubuntu without installing\". Once you get to the Ubuntu desktop, open a terminal.\nRoot Partition\nYou need to find out your root partition on your Ubuntu installation. On a standard Ubuntu installation, the root partition is \"/dev/sda1\", but it may be different for you. To figure out what's the root partition, run the following command:\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nThis will display a list of hard disks and partitions from which you'll have to figure out which one is the root partition. Below in step 3, ROOT-PARTITION is the root partition you just found, for example /dev/sda2 in my case.\nChroot Into Your Root Partition\nTo make sure a certain partition is the root partition, you can mount it. So let's mount the root partition along with the /sys, /proc, /run and /dev partitions and enter chroot:\nsudo mount ROOT-PARTITION /mnt\nfor i in /sys /proc /run /dev /dev/pts; do sudo mount --bind \"$i\" \"/mnt$i\"; done\nsudo cp /etc/resolv.conf /mnt/etc/\nsudo chroot /mnt\n\nIf you get an error about resolv.conf being identical when copying it, just ignore it. Copying resolv.conf gets the network working, at least for me (using DHCP).\nUpdate/Install Packages\nNow you can update the system - in the same terminal, type:\napt-get update\napt-get upgrade\napt-get install network-manager network-manager-gnome\n\nIf you have problems on the last step, make sure your sources are correct in /etc/apt/sources.list - in the same terminal, type:\nsudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nSince you've chrooted into your Ubuntu installation, the changes you make affect it and not the Live CD, as long as all changes are made in the same terminal session.\nReboot when finished and remove the Live CD.

I got the idea from another post to  add the cdrom: [Ubuntu install DVD/CD] to the software sources in Software and Updates on the 'Other Software' tab.  The cdrom source was already listed but not checked so I checked it.  Then I used Synaptic Package Manager to install 'network-manager'.  I guess I could have used Ubuntu Software instead.  This worked for me in Ubuntu 18.10\n\nA: I had the same problem on a Ubuntu 20.04 installation. This was on a desktop machine, without WiFi. The dhclient thing did not work for me. So I managed to set a fixed IP. You need to know your router IP, and a free IP on your network (example done as root, # is the prompt)\n\n*\n\n*First figure out what your device name is:\n# lshw -C network | grep \"logical name\"\n\nIf you have multiple network ports, if you don't know which one to use experiment with each one.\n\n\n*Create a static IP\n# ip addr add 192.168.1.123/24 dev yourdevname\n\nwhere yourdevname is taken from the lshw logical name\n\n\n*Add a default gateway route\n# route add default gw 192.168.1.1\n\nNote that you need to know the IP of your router\n\n\n*Edit /etc/resolv.conf and add/change/set it to the following two lines (backup old file if you like)\nnameserver 8.8.8.8\nnameserver 9.9.9.9\n\nYou can use different IP addresses if you know your DNS server IP. The above two listed should get you going.\nThat's it, hopefully you have full internet access again.\n\nA: For me, it turned out that I accidentally deleted /etc/resolv.conf and then got the same symptoms (nslookup nba.com doesn't work, but nslookup nba.com 4.2.2.4 does work, when 4.2.2.4 was configured as my DNS server).\nRestoring the file from a live USB solved the issue.\n\nA: Manually configure your ethernet card in /etc/network/interfaces and restart the networking service. Then apt-get update. \n", "Q: KVM and port security In my test environment I get everything working perfectly the way I want it. Running Cloudmin KVM instances over a bridged adapter. Then when it comes time to install at the data center I hit a brick wall. They have port security turned on which only allows one MAC address over the network port. Since I only have 2 interfaces I need to run several KVM instances (10 or more) with each assigned their own static public IP. I don't have a range of IPs either. I was assigned specific ones.\nIs there a way around this where I can assign each KVM instance it's own IP but only use one MAC address? Keep in mind this needs to be KVM via Cloudmin.\nThanks\n\nA: I haven't used Cloudmin personally, but the network engineer in me says this is probably not possible. If you're using a bridged adapter, all the machines are effectively separate entities, with their own MAC/IP combo, and this is how ARP is able to locate them. Pushing them all on one MAC address wouldn't work in a traditional setup, and I don't see how it could here, unfortunately. You will have to ask them to either turn off port security for your port, or add all of your VMs to the trusted MAC list. \nAlternatively, using a NAT bridge instead of a bridged adapter should also work.\n", "Q: Intel Centrino Wimax 6250 - Constant Slow and Dropped signal (Ubuntu 13.10) I've been surfing the forums for a while now, and I have hit a brick wall.

Even when it lets me delete, create, and format the drive.\nHere is all of the drives:\n\n\nA: I believe both Ubuntu and Windows require GUID formated partition tables (GPT) on drives larger than 2TB. Most likely your computer is running BIOS not UEFI which isn't a problem except that Windows requires UEFI to use GPT. The drive you want to install Windows on is under 2TB and therefore can be formated in MBR, but because it's not the first boot drive windows can't install. Windows installs it' bootloader to the mbr of the first boot drive, but the first boot drive is Ubuntu, and so it's being detected as GPT which cannot have an MBR entry added. I would sugggest disconnceting all your hard drives except Windows, install windows then reconnect them. This will allow you to boot Ubuntu by default, but if you enter your bios at boot up you should be able to tell it to boot the windows hard drive instead. Please note that some computers don't allow selecting which hard drive to boot from in the bios quickboot list, if this is the case for you then you'll be unable too boot WIndows because Ubuntu will boot first, so you'll need to add an entry to the grub bootloader for Windows.\n", "Q: Acer C7 Chromebook running 13.10 slow Performance Graphics?

I really dont have any idea about any alternative. Also i dont know about any emulator like we have for android on windows. Please help, I have to practise and we have practicals in a week. Also my laptop is quite old so windows does not work properly.\n\nA: It is not possible to run a vb script through Ubuntu. There are however some alternatives\n\n\n*\n\n*Try installing Internet Explorer in wine\nDownload Internet Explorer and save it to your home directory\nOpen a terminal and type:\nwine IE8-WindowsXP-x86-ENU.exe\n\ntry running your script through IE\n\n\n*\n\n*Install a Windows (through virtualbox for example)\n1) Install Oracle VM VirtualBox.\n2) Extract an ISO image from a Windows XP CD you have, IMGburn and k3b have this functionality.\n3) Click the New button (the first of the four below the menu).\n4) Use the Wizard to create a virtual partition for Windows XP. Windows XP is the default OS selected, so all you have to do is name it. (Windows XP, for example, is a good name).\n5) Choose the amount of RAM to be allocated to this OS (when it's in use). Don't allocate too much because there will be less RAM for your host system to run, which will crash your entire system.\n6) Create a new hard disk since you probably don't have one already. Click Next to Continue. You will be taken through the Create New Virtual Disk wizard, which will allow you to choose hard disk size, dynamically expanding/fixed size, etc.\n7) Review the summary it provides at the end and verify the information is correct.

To remove it entirely and use the space in windows, boot with windows (I do not know which win you are using ), under control panel, administrative tools, find disk manager (name may be smt different). Find the partitions you have installed ubuntu. Format them to ntfs and set it as a windows drive by giving it drive letter. To restore your UEFI please follow this link How to fix the MBR for Windows 7?\n\nA: If installed via Windows Installer, you can simply select Ubuntu from your programs list and choose uninstall.\nFrom there, it is quite simple to re-allocate the data back to Windows 8.1.\nYou can do this by opening Start and typing Disk Management. You will see an option along the lines of manage disk partitions. \nThis program will allow you to select and allocate un-allocated data.\nSimply right click Drive C (or whichever drive volume you wish to assign the un-allocated data to) and click Extend Volume, where you will follow the instructions given by the confirmation window. \nHowever, if you did not install Ubuntu via WUBI, then you will still be using Disk Management program.\nThe process is similar: Simply select the drive volume labeled Ubuntu or something similar and delete the volume. Then follow the above steps to allocate the newly un-allocated data to a usable volume.\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Android Eclipse Error When I am creating a new android project in eclipse a file named R.java is supposed to be  created automatically which is not happening.\nMy Ubuntu is 12.04 LTS 64 bit\nMy Eclipse version is juno for jee SR1 x86_64\n\nA: This is a common Eclipse ADT problem, yet there's not a concrete answer to solve this, there are different ways to aproach this like the following:\n1: Clean the project\nProject ---> Clean\n\n-according to the Eclipse ADT plugin developers and contributors:\n\nif you run a clean on the project it should regenerate all the generated java files, namely R.\n\nyou should never import android.R (if you do this, you will find out that this file is shared between all the projects on eclipse, so if you delete or remove the project who has this file in the first place, you will corrupt all the other projects you import the file with).\nI've tried this with no results, but you should try all the possible solutions\n2: Removing corrupted files\nthis source has helped me before, you should give it a try\n3: Using a different IDE to develop Android apps\nI find AndroidStudio a very good tool to develop even though its in beta release, i never have to solve the R.java problem because Graddle (a build automation tool) let me know or even solve all the corrupted files that might have my android app\nYou can download it in here \nworks in Windows,Mac and Linux and you can even migrate your Eclipse projects to AndroidStudio to continue to work in your android apps\n\nA: *\n\n*make sure that you workspace is in your home_dir /home/[uName]/ (or any sub_dir)\n\n*make sure that there aren't any errors in any resource file \n\n\n*\n\n*the R.java will not be created if there are any errors.\n\n\n*make sure that android:targetSdkVersion=\"xx\" in the AndroidManifest.xml is typically the android version you had installed. \n", "Q: How to prevent Evince from automatically opening PDF files? I am not sure what is wrong with my computer but it automatically opens PDF files using Evince whenever I download them from Chrome. How could I prevent that?\n\nA: Explanation:\nAFAIK, Google chrome remembers the downloading preference for each file type (exe, pdf, zip... etc) that a user inputs. This has nothing to do with a specific program (in your case evince) because, Ubuntu itself uses necessary programs which are set as default to open file types. Such like, if the option seen in below image is selected for each file type, it will inherit the same preference to that selected types individually & opens/executes with a default assigned program.\n\nI'd say this is quiet simple yet an unnoticeable option. Below should fix your problem as it took me a while to figure out why.. :)\n\n*\n\n*Just right click or hit on a PDF file to download from any link\n\n*While the process shows downloading; simply click on the arrow shows next the file; un-tick \"Always Open Files of This Type\" if its select (ticked).\n\n\nJust tested on my pc which sorted the issue. Hope it helps! :)\n\nA: Additionally, if you don't want to use evince but another pdf viewer, you can go to Settings > System > Details and config every default app that will trigger whenever you try to open a given file.\n", "Q: GRUB not responding to keyboard I installed Ubuntu 12.4LTS on dual boot with Windows XP on my 7 year old desktop PC 2 months ago.\nEverything worked perfectly in both Ubuntu and XP until last week when I removed LibreOffice from Ubuntu and installed OpenOffice 4.0.1. (removal/installation done from Terminal as per Ubuntu online instructions).\nAt the GRUB menu window, the keyboard is now inoperative, so the system times out and boots Ubuntu (which still works perfectly) but I cannot boot XP.\nThe keyboard (USB) works perfectly at the BIOS stage of startup, does not work during GRUB, but works again from the Ubuntu login onwards.\nI have looked through the Q&As for a solution, the nearest refers to BIOS keyboard setup, but as my keyboard works in BIOS I don't think this is the cause.\nI am not sure where the problem might be.  I have looked at grub.cfg, and whilst a newcomer to Linux, cannot see anything obviously corrupt, although I cannot identify which method/module/function call (if any) reads the keyboard.\nI was considering reloading GRUB, but if the problem is elsewhere this won't solve it, and might make matters worse.\nAny advice would be much appreciated.\n\nA: I realise this is quite an old post, but I have had the same problem with a clean install of Ubuntu 20.04 and Windows 10.\nI found that grub would not respond to my keyboard when connected to a USB3 port, but works fine with legacy USB2.\n\nA: Although some time has passed and several hints about not working keyboard in grub can be found on the web, i discovered a reason which to consider may help in some cases:\nThe USB keyboard may be unusuable in grub because another USB device is also plugged in which interferes with grub keyboard usage.\nFor details in such a case please see https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/index.php?57010\n\nA: PROBLEM SOLVED, it was BIOS related (appears BIOS screen is skipped if rebooted with 5min of shut down). Changed boot sequence from Floppy,HDD to CDROM,HDD. Rebooted with NO CD in drive (GRUB not updated),keyboard now works at GRUB screen so can access all options. Now realise that I changed backup coin cell on motherboard around time I installed OpenOffice, suspect this changed boot sequence to default and somehow affected keyboard. Have compared current & previous grub.cfg – identical. Now have boot-repair disk ready for any future issues. \n\nA: TL;DR. Try all your USB ports including all USB ports on your docking station if you have one.\nI just experienced the same thing with a new installation of Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS and a following dist-upgrade now running the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS (lsb_release -a)\n\n*3.16.0-33-generic (uname -r)\n\n*grub-install (GRUB) 2.02~beta2-9ubuntu1 (grub-install --version)\n\n\nThe keyboard worked the first times I booted to GRUB so I could boot Windows 8.1 as well but then it suddenly stopped working without any good reason I thought. Just like OP I could use my keyboard in BIOS and USB Legacy keyboard was already enabled so no luck there. Finally I found a PS/2 keyboard which worked in GRUB menu and I could stop the countdown timer. I now tested my USB keyboard in all USB ports on my laptop and in the docking station and it only works with GRUB in one USB port.\nLooking back at this of course there was a good explanation. I had moved my desk just after doing my dist-upgrade and had disconnected all cables while doing the move and then reconnected the keyboard to wrong USB port.\nI hope this helps.\n\nA: In my experience, I had the boot set to \"fast\" which it would boot up faster, but in doing that, it didn't allow my keyboard to work in dual boot when I would turn on my laptop from shutdown. It would only work right going into ubuntu (obviously when keyboard doesn't work) and/or rebooting which brings back to dual-boot main screen setup. I loaded the default settings which set boot to \"normal\" and this solved it for me for those that who might be stuck and a last resort before doing a Ubuntu re-install. Hope this helps.\n\nA: Turn off the fast boot in the BIOS (it worked for me).\nWhen I hover to fast boot it says something like, fast boot is for minimizing device input for making the load faster or something, so when I turn fast boot off, and save the changes and restart my laptop it works!\n\nA: Windows 7 and Ubuntu 14.04LTS dual boot, GRUB2 reinstalled using boot-repair, wireless USB keyboard, no keyboard recognized on GRUB2 screen resolved.\n\n\n*\n\n*BIOS Setup \n\n*Integrated Peripherals \n\n*Legacy USB Support --> [Enabled]\n\n\nI now have up and down arrow keys on the GRUB2 screen. NumLock is now toggled off at boot time, but NBD. \nI'm not sure how to mark it RESOLVED, but since it's not a new thread, I don't think I have the power. \n\nA: My USB-Keyboard Coolermaster Quickfire TK was not responding in Grub2 (or at least making strange inputs like a,e,3 were possible, but on wrong buttons). Another usb- keyboard worked fine.\nMy solution was to turn the Keyboard itself into 6KRO Mode instead of NKRO Mode by pressing \"6\" and \"ESC\".\n\nA: If \"fast boot\" is causing the problem but you don't want to turn it off, change \"USB Support\" from \"Partial Initial\" to \"Full Initial\" in the BIOS if there is such an option (at least at my GIGABYTE BIOS). This activates all USB devices before OS boot.\n\nA: I also had this problem and it turned out my mouse was somehow prohibiting the keyboard input. I unplugged it and everything worked fine.\n\nA: I tried enabling and disabling the BIOS keyboard support, didn't work. (Yes, keyboard works with the BIOS but not GRUB, but does work immediately after GRUB menu using CTRL-ALT-DLT to halt the boot process). \nWhile searching I saw someone else said about trying all USB ports. I remembered that the previous week I had moved the keyboard from one USB port to another to make space for a larger USB dongle to be plugged into a nearby USB port. So I moved the keyboard back to the USB port it was in previously and it works.\nApparently on this Dell SC440, only some USB ports work with GRUB.\n\nA: Mine was resolved by using a USB2 slot (removing from USB3 slot).\n\nA: I would like to second what Pablo Bianchi said. Even though USB Legacy boot =>[ENABLE] it had the problem with grub menu. changing it to USB Legacy boot =>[AUTO] solved the issue.\n\nA: In my case (Dell XPS 15 9550 with latest BIOS/UEFI 1.14.0) was because I added a USB-C dongle between the keyboard and the laptop.\n\nA: I had the same problem but none of the above helped. In my case I had to enable the BIOS option \"use USB in DOS\".\n\nA: Mine wouldn't work, In the Award Cmos Setup Utility, I changed first boot device to HDD and the other two disabled, and enabled USB keyboard and mouse, hope this helps. \n\nA: In my case there was Keyboard and mouse disabled in BIOS. Could look for this in the future.\n", "Q: What are the risks of running Nautilus as root? Whenever I try to access files outside my home directory I get a permission error. People keep recommending running Nautilus as root by running the following commands in a terminal:\nsudo -i nautilus\ngksu nautilus\n\nWhat are the risks of doing so?\n\nA: As it is perfectly fine to run some applications as root we definitely need to know of the risks when doing so.\nOne of the benefits of any Unix-like operating system (like Ubuntu) is a tight security concept to minimize unwanted damage to vital system files. File permissions are an essential part of these security measures . Only if we make sure that certain files can not be accessed without administrative permissions we can be safe from accidental damage.\nHence all system files, global application settings for all users, applications binaries, and more will be protected from unwanted access by restricting access to root/administrators only.\nEven administrators should not run their system as root but should rely on the much safer concept of sudo.\nBy running a graphical file manager as root we will do so with administrative permissions to all files on our system. As a consequence we will be able to open, copy, delete, and change permissions with all files and folders including system files without further warning.\nAs administrator we may exactly want to do that - then (and only then) it can be fine to run nautilus as root. But especially as a beginnner we may not yet be able to foresee what bad side effects can happen if we do thing wrong.\nIt is much safer to not run nautilus as root. There are few good reasons only to do so. Usually we can achieve what we want with other safer means.\nImagine an unwanted movement of our mouse, a premature mouse click, or a drag & drop action to the wrong destination. Imagine an accidentally wrong change of permissions on a folder. Imagine an accidental hit on Del while a file or folder is highlighted. If applied to the wrong files or folder we may end up with a non-booting broken system.\nIn addition consider the following: Once we are root on running nautilus all application we start from there, be it from the context menu, be it by a double click on associated file types, or be it by running their .desktop file will also run as root. All files we create by these applications will then also be owned by root. This may not be what we want. It would be much safer to run just a single application as root.\nStill we may want ot decide that the task we plan is easier to perform from a GUI file manager than it would be from the command line. Only in case we are familiar with permissions, and the file system hierarchy we may take the risk of running Nautilus as root. As a beginner we should however refrain from doing so.\nIn case we had run Nautilus as root for an administrative task we should immediately close the Nautilus window again to avoid unwanted accidental actions.\n", "Q: Check when folder was last synchronized with rsync I'm using a cron job to backup a folder to another computer.

So, I want to be able to develop under Windows and Linux, too.\nTherefore I have stored my project (as git repo) on a NTFS partition which I mount under Linux (Ubuntu 13.10). To avoid the rights problem of the compiled executable I set the shadow build directory to my home folder under Linux.\nThis approach work quit good so far. But there are some effects that make me worry: If I stage some changed files (with smartgit), smartgit doesn't reflect that I have stage them. They are still displayed as unstaged.\nSimilar thing when commiting: After the commit, the commited changes are still display as if they where not commit. But in the log I can see they are commited. Closing an reopen the repo \"solves\" this issues or is a workaround at least.\nBut I have concerns that I break my repo using it on a NTFS partition under Linux. Or is there no risk that my repo is getting corrupted one day using it that way?\n\n\nA: that happens because of the file mode.

To get XP working again I had to format the hard disc and re-install XP.\"\nWas \"NOT SUPPORTED\" a warning that I could't run Ubuntu on my computer? If so why?    \n\nA: Was there not more to the message?  Like \"Frequency not supported\"?  Was it in a box centered in the middle of the screen?  If so then that's your monitor complaining that it doesn't support the resolution the video card is trying to drive it in.\n", "Q: Assining permission to www folder Very new to Linux (Ubuntu). So getting lost each moment where this time I just installed Apache and trying to create file in www folder. But it is giving permission error.\nNow I don't even know how to reach to the www folder in terminal. Embarrassing but just can't find a way.\nCan anyone help me to set permission for this folder? Also how to reach to the folder in terminal.\n\nA: The default permission is drwxr-xr-x \nThe default owner is root\nTo reach www directory in terminal :\ncd /var/www\n\nTo change permission :\nsudo chmod 755 /var/www     ( this is the default)\n\nTo change the owner :\nsudo chown root:root /var/www (this is the default)\n\nTo create directory in /var/www :\nsudo mkdir /var/www/nameyouwant\n\nto change the owner of the new directory :\n sudo chown username:usernamegroup /var/www/nameyouwant -R\n\nNote you can use -R option for recursive\n\nA: The default www folder used by apache lives in /var/www\nHowever, it is owned by the apache user: www-data. To be able to place files in that folder, you can temporarily become the apache user: type sudo su www-data (within a terminal). Whatever commands you issue on that console will be done as the apache user, until you type exit\nOr, even better, you can copy things over and then change them to belong to the apache user: sudo cp myfiles /var/www && sudo chown /var/www/myfiles www-data:www-data will do the trick (where myfiles are the files you want to place in the /var/www folder).\n", "Q: OpenVZ Ubuntu 12.04 Mutt accent problem I'm trying to resolve the problem of accent on mutt because, they are displayed like '?' or '\\123'.\nI know there is a good documentation on mutt (http://dev.mutt.org/trac/wiki/MuttFaq/Charset) for this but i've tried all tips with no success.\nI'm on a OpenVZ machine (Ubuntu 12.04 x86), this is my configuration for locales and charset on mutt :\n.muttrc :\nset charset=utf8\n\nlocale :\nLANG=en_US.utf8\n\nI don't find where is my error and how can i resolve this \nMutt version : Mutt 1.5.21 (2010-09-15)\nMany thanks for your help !\n\nA: After a investigation, i have found my problem..\nI use putty to connect on my vm.

Not always the case, but trying to turn it back on by moving my mouse, makes the entire desktop and logon screen unusable. I've been struggling to find a proper fix for this, and after reading this post:\nKubuntu corrupt screen after lid close/screensaver\nI believe it may have something to do with Desktop Effects. I do enjoy my effects, but if that's the fix, then I'll gladly do it. I have however found another way of getting around this. In the past I used to have to shut down or restart my machine to get the display working properly again, but I had a bunch of apps open and didn't want to lose work, so logged on via console, and then ran \"startx\". This created a new desktop on TTY8, and logged me on. When I revert back to TTY 7 (Ctrl+Alt+F7) the display no longer flickers, and I can log on without any problems.\nIf anyone has found any proven proper solution to bypass this issue, any assistance would be appreciated.\n...\nFrom further findings, this is yet to prove that it has anything to do with my desktop effects. It still happens without any effects enabled. Switching console windows, fixes the issue most of the time, but it means I have to go through each console up until it stops working, and I have to reboot.\n\nA: If you are ready to sacrifice the Effects then install Compiz available here.Disable all the \"Effects\".I hope your problem will be solved.\n", "Q: Is it safe to purge resolvconf if you handle /etc/resolv.conf via puppet? We have multiple servers running 12.04 LTS and 10.04 LTS with static network settings. Is it safe to purge the package resolvconf if you handle /etc/resolv.conf via puppet?\n\nA: It is advisable not to purge or remove the resolvconf package even if resolv.conf is managed by something other than resolvconf. The reason is that the mere presence of resolvconf suppresses various other programs' default behavior of futzing directly with /etc/resolv.conf. So you probably want to keep the resolvconf package installed in order to suppress that futzing. \nNote that the resolvconf program never touches /etc/resolv.conf directly: it writes its dynamic resolv.conf file at /run/resolvconf/resolv.conf and /etc/resolv.conf is normally a symbolic link to the latter. So if puppet puts a file at /etc/resolv.conf instead of the symlink then resolvconf won't overwrite it.\n", "Q: Unable to find the wifi symbol at the top right corner I am a newbie to Ubuntu. I have installed Ubuntu 13.04 in VMware. Everything went perfectly, but I was unable to find the wifi symbol in the notification area in the top right corner of the desktop. \nI have tried changing the memory allocation to 1GB, but even then it wasn't detecting the wifi. I also tried changing the network connection in the VMware Virtual Machine Settings to Bridged network connection. It just got disconnected from a wired connection and reconnected to that.\nCan anyone please help me to overcome this problem?\n\nA: You might be able to solve your problem with the missing networking applet icon if you gave your virtual machine more RAM. Set this configuration parameter for the virtual machine in the virtual machine settings editor (VM -> Settings -> Memory). The guest memory size should not be set lower than the minimum recommendations of the operating system provider, which is 768MB RAM for Ubuntu 13.04.\nIf you have a wifi connection in your host machine, then you should also have the same wifi connection in your virtual machine in VMware, if you have configured the networking in VMware to use the same network connection as the host machine is using, which is called a bridged network connection. A bridged network connection connects the guest virtual machine directly to the physical network of the host machine. The screenshot below is from the Virtual Machine Settings screen in VMware.\n\n\nA: you can open your unity dash and search for Network Connections application, this will simply be the same as if you click that indicator on the up right hand side :)\n", "Q: How to backup my system so that I can create an exact replica on another computer I have a ubuntu 12 LTS and windows dual boot machine.

So there is no difference in a bit bucket repo and other git repo. For GUI u can try gitk which looks ugly but work nicely. There are other GUI apps also like gitg, webgit and other. U can use any of them. But remember u can more productive if u use command line (my personal thought.)\n", "Q: What version UBUNTU is best I have a netbook MSI U135 DDR 2 1GB with Windows7 Starter.

Network Manager is supposed to disallow this. As well, your system will struggle to decide which connection to use and what traffic goes where unless it is directed manually such as in /etc/network/interfaces. Typically, a home user needn't use this level of complication.\nPlease switch the wireless off and tell us if your ethernet operates as expected.\nIf this is a stay-at-home computer that is always attached to ethernet, we can blacklist the wireless driver so it never tries to interfere. \nPlease remove all edits to Network Manager, select Automatic (DHCP) and reboot. Reboot the router as well. Do you get an IP address? Please pastebin again.

First i've tried to install the official drivers from the nvidia website, which didn't work - the installer aborted on creating the kernel modules.\nGoogling around i've found the x-edgers ppa to install the drivers from. According to the docs i've installed the matching drivers for my card:\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-304 nvidia-304-settings\n\nAfter rebooting the x server doesn't start, but there are no fatal error messages in the x log. Listing the loaded modules doesn't include any nvidia module. BUT: if i manually load nvidia-304 module instead of nvidia everything works fine - i can start lightdm and even login:\nlsmod | grep nvidia\nmodprobe nvidia-304\nlsmod | grep nvidia\nnvidia   xxxxxxxxxx 0\nservice lightdm start\n\nWhat to do here to have the appropriate module started on boot?\n\nA: The easiest way to solve your problem with nvidia-304 driver is to install all LXDE packages using Synaptic, and also to install LXDM, and choose lxdm as default display manager. It will completely change your desktop but at least it will work, and you'll also get the benefit of using fewer resources than before, as the boot-up process and the OS itself are faster and lighter in a lxde environment.\nWhen I say install all LXDE packages, I mean you actually install all that is needed, don't just let Synaptic choose the dependencies for you, you go and install all related packages to LXDE including the actual LXDE package :) , or else it won't work. Installing LXDM (display manager for lxde) immediately after that is also essential to make it work, and don't forget to choose the LXDE session after first reboot.\n", "Q: What is the fastest way to move files?

When I press the power button, the GRUB loader shows up, and then I can choose windows, and resume windows, or I can start loading ubuntu. \nIf I have windows on hibernate, will it be using up some of my RAM memory, and cause it to lag?

Or will I not have a problem at all?\n\nNo your RAM won't be used but you can't access the Windows partitions on Ubuntu if you do so.\n\nA: No problem. Windows saves its state in a file called hiberfil.sys. If you start (via bootloader) another distribution, that file will not be read and your RAM will be used exclusively for the running OS.\nOn Linux you will not be able to access the drive where windows is located, since any change of the filesystem would be disjunctive to the state stored in file mentioned above.  \n", "Q: How to open a directory and view images if it contains a large number of image files (~70,000)?

But when I want to see it I can't, as when I open the directory, due to the number of files the file manager stops responding.\nEven if I somehow manage to open it, I fear that the image viewer will not respond, as I am under the impression that they try to put a few images in cache to load faster.\nI tried to open the images from terminal. I can open one image at a time in this case but I can't view it as a gallery, which is equally bad as I need to view many images to know that the results are satisfactory.\n\nA: 70k image files are a lot.\nThe first thing I can suggest is to disable thumbnails (In nautilus > preferences, choose the \"preview\" tab, select  Never). \n\nThen you can test the various image viewers/manipulators (the standard viewer, gthumb, shotwell, darktable, etc etc ) and see if someone is reasonably fast.  \n", "Q: How to change the mirror of setuptools?

It seems, what this command does is list all files including all files in sub-folders in one list.\n\nA: This is an alias for find .

The way how files are compared and considered as duplicates is configurable, e.g. compare of content, size, name etc. \nIf the content of the file was chosen for compare (default), the program uses the MD5 sum to check if files are equal to each other. Before calculating the complete MD5 sum of a file it first checks if the size of the file and the MD5 sum of the first 8kB.findd\nExample, to finds and reports all duplicate files in the '.'-Directory excluding zero sized files.

There are 2 important pieces of information one needs to understand about why this works.  The first is about the boot process and how the initial power on self test (executed by the BIOS) looks for a boot record on the first boot sector of the devices attached.  This is a small file which basically passes the boot execution process onto the boot loader/manager such as GRUB2 on newer Linux installs.  For more information on this, read this very informative post.\nThe 2nd piece of information is to understand that the ISO downloads for Linux OSes are designed to be installed on a disk (CD/DVD/USB) and not for a partition.  These ISOs need to be modified using a small tool which can be found on the syslinux-utils package, called isohybrid.  The ISO modification for installation on a partition is done with the --partok flag.  I found this information from this post which describes the exact same issue.\nI am not sure how the --partok magic works, I searched for some explanation but could not find any.\nIn summary, here is what I did to get my live PureOS install to boot from a usb partition,\n\n\n*\n\n*Partitioned my  USB using GNOME disk, I initially formatted the disk using MBR/DOS.  I created a 4GB partition (FAT32) followed by a an ext4 Linux partition in the remaining space for my backups. \n\n*Next I modified the ISO file I downloaded to make it bootable from the partition. To do this I had to install the syslinux-utils from the repositories, in which the isohybrid tool resides:\nsudo apt-get install syslinux-utils\n\nI then modified the ISO file with:\nisohybrid --partok pureos.ISO\n\n\n*I used dd to copy this ISO to the above partition.  You can get the partition device from the GNOME disk details.  \ndd if=pureos.ISO of=/dev/sdb1 bs=1M\n\n\n*From GNOME disk I edited the partition and checked the bootable option, which installs the required book record.\nI was now able to boot from the USB key into the live CD and use it as a recovery solution while storing my system backups on the other partition. \n\nA: *\n\n*You want to preserve the main part of your USB as FAT32 storage 14GB\n\n*You want LiveUSB part in Ext4 2GB\n\n\nThen the layout of your USB follow:\nsdb1 14GB Fat32 storage and EFI folder\nsdb2 2GB Ext4 LiveUSB\n\n\n*\n\n*You have to create the Fat32 part fist to be seen under Windows, as without many tweak, Windows only mount the 1st partition of your USB\n\n*This Fat32 partition also hold EFI folder to boot your LiveUSB part\n\n*If you want the LiveUSB partition sdb2 on Ext4. By default, the built-in bootx64.efi of the LiveUSB will not boot an Ext4 partition.\nSo I have made a tweaked bootx64.efi. You just copy the file to sdb1/EFI/boot/. And it will boot your Ext4 LiveUSB part. All of my detail here https://github.com/sonvirgo/Ext4-LiveUSB\n\nA: An easy solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use KDE Partition Manager to delete all partitions and create a 2,048 MB primary partition, FAT32.\n\n*Allocate the rest of the free space to your data partition. If you need interoperability with Windows, choose NTFS as the file system, but beware that when read from Linux, all files with have the +x attribute set. Otherwise, choose ext4.\n\n*Use unetbootin to write the ISO (Ubuntu 18.04 is about that size, 2GB). Don't worry that it appears to only write to /dev/sda instead of a particular partition.\nIn my setup, gparted doesn't see the partitions correctly, while KDE Partition Manager does.

After 3 attempts it finally installed.\nHowever all I get at boot up time is a DOS type screen. I log in as requested and after a few lines of obscure text it just sits with an equally obscure and user unfriendly prompt. no help, no other prompt. I installed the grub boot loader but nothing else loads except this unfriendly dos style prompt.\nBefore I wipe the whole thing off the disk and look elsewhere could someone give a quickie idea of where I go from here.\nAll I need is a fairly straightforward file server that can be set up with users/shares etc.\n\nA: First I would like to welcome you to the world of Linux, once you start to get the hang of it you'll wonder how you ever lived without it.\nAs you installed the server edition you have a minimal installation, this gets the system running, but it is not very useful at this point.\nTo install software you will need to run sudo apt-get install <package-name> and then aptitude (the package manager) will do the rest. If you don't know the name of the package, you can always search for it using apt-cache search <search-term>.\nTo share files with your other machines (I'm guessing they are Windows) you need to install samba and get it up and running; it manages all of the connections to windows network shares (and more, if you should ever need it!)\n\nA: The Ubuntu Server edition is intended for users who have experience with the command line. \nI suggest you install the Ubuntu Desktop edition, which will provide you with all the features of the Server edition and allow you to do all of the same things.\nThere is a lot of documentation online about setting up a file server, and K7AAY included some links in the comments above.\n\nA: What you've described would most easily be available using the desktop version of Ubuntu.  However, from your current installation of Ubuntu server, you can just install a GUI and samba.  You can do this from terminal:\n\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\nsudo apt-get install samba\n\nSamba allows you to easily connect with Windows computers.  Ubuntu has a built-in function to share files though.  So, depending on what you want to do, you may not need Samba.  To share a folder in Ubuntu:\n\nright-click the folder you want to share\nselect Properties\nclick the \"Share\" tab\nselect the \"Share this folder\" checkbox\n\n", "Q: How to change Teamviewer ID after cloning Today I was cloning a couple of images of Ubuntu to further expand the use of Ubuntu over the company but just noticed that all cloned PCs have the same Teamviewer ID. I followed teamviewer forum suggestion about purging teamviewer, removing the .config/teamviewer9 folder and even the /opt/teamviewer one with no luck. The ID stays the same even after rebooting or waiting for about 30 mins before installing teamviewer again.\nHow can I reset/change the Teamviewer ID in Ubuntu for all the cloned computers. Right now I am using the latest version of Teamviewer (Version 9).\n\nA: Close TeamViewer. Then run in the terminal:\nsudo teamviewer --daemon stop\nsudo rm -f /opt/teamviewer9/config/global.conf\nsudo teamviewer --daemon start\n\nEdit: I checked, and TeamViewer also looks at your MAC address. It probably works like this. When you first start TeamViewer (with no configuration files available), it looks up your MAC address. If it is not known by TV, it creates a new TeamViewer ID and associates your MAC address with it. If the MAC address is known, you get the teamviewer ID associated with it.\nSo, if you clone to a new computer, the commands above would help you get a new ID. If you use them on the original computer, you'll get the same ID.\n\nA: None of the previous suggestions worked in my case.\nThe quickest and most effective solution I found was to re-install TeamViewer fresh (after uninstall and deletion of config files in Library/Preferences) from an alternative new user account, that solved it immediately. \n\nA: Try to change the MAC Addresses for Cloned PCs\nTeamViewer ID depends on it for sure.\n\nA: Please close TeamViewer on the new / cloned machine - then run the following commands in the terminal:\ndefaults delete ~/Library/Preferences/com.teamviewer.teamviewer9.plist\ndefaults delete ~/Library/Preferences/com.teamviewer.teamviewer9.Machine.plist\nsudo defaults delete /Library/Preferences/com.teamviewer.teamviewer9.plist\n\nrm -f ~/Library/Preferences/com.teamviewer.teamviewer9.plist\nrm -f ~/Library/Preferences/com.teamviewer.teamviewer9.Machine.plist\nsudo rm -f /Library/Preferences/com.teamviewer.teamviewer9.plist\n\n\nA: A solution is:\nModify /etc/systemd/system/teamviewerd.service:\n[Unit]\nDescription = TeamViewer remote control daemon\nAfter = NetworkManager-wait-online.service network.target network-online.target dbus.service\nWants = NetworkManager-wait-online.service network-online.target\nRequires = dbus.service\n\n[Service]\nType = forking\nPIDFile = /var/run/teamviewerd.pid\nExecStartPre= /sbin/ifconfig eth0 hw ether aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff\nExecStart = /opt/teamviewer/tv_bin/teamviewerd -d\nExecStartPost = /usr/local/sbin/restoremac.sh\nRestart = on-abort\nStartLimitInterval = 60\nStartLimitBurst = 10\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy = multi-user.target\n\nReplacing eth0 with your interface and aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff with a new MAC.\nCreate a script cat /usr/local/sbin/restoremac.sh:\n#!/bin/sh\n/bin/sleep 2\n/sbin/ifconfig eth0 hw ether ff:ee:dd:cc:bb:aa\n\nReplacing eth0 with your interface and ff:ee:dd:cc:bb:aa with original MAC.\nUse \"chmod 755 /usr/local/sbin/restoremac.sh\"\nDelete /etc/teamviewer/global.conf\nRestart machine\nYou can keep your MAC and change TeamViewr ID.\nIf you using teamviewer for personal use only, and you have message \"Commercial Use Suspected\", this solve the problem!\nIF YOU USE IT ONLY FOR NOT COMMERCIAL SCOPE!\n\nA: I have found the simplest way to change the ID is to change the MAC address of the NIC.

Here are the stats:\nOS Version: Microsoft Windows XP Professional, Service Pack 3, 32 bit\nProcessor: Intel(R) Pentium(R) 4 CPU 2.80GHz, x86 Family 15 Model 4 Stepping 1\nProcessor Count: 1\nRAM: 1149 Mb\nGraphics Card: Intel(R) 82865G Graphics Controller, 96 Mb\nHard Drives: C: Total - 38091 MB, Free - 18046 MB;\nMotherboard: Dell Computer Corp., 0U2575\n\nI want to convert to Xubuntu 13.10 but now I get a lot of 'low virtual memory' warnings and I'd like to increase the memory from 2GB to 4GB. I want to do this before the conversion because this website (crucial.com) assess your computer and gives compatible memory stick recommendations (crucial.com does not do this for Linux). A computer knowledgeable person I know said it was not worth increasing the memory, but the way I see it, it can't hurt.\nAnybody got any feedback on this for me? Think I should increase the memory from 2GB-->4GB or not? Thanks!\nSorry, all, got that RAM situation wrong (the specs are right). Am only thinking about upgrading to 2GB of Ram. (Thx for quick, excellent responses.)\n\nA: Xubuntu 13.10 works well with 2GB, and is much more efficient at memory use than XP. You will have no problem with 2GB, which is good since Crucial shows you cannot go past a pair of 1GB memory sticks.\n\nA: I'm confused by a few of the things you said. \"Low virtual memory\" is an issue with running out of swap space on your hard drive and can be fixed by increasing the virtual memory size in your OS settings. \nYou say you want to increase from 2GB to 4GB, but you list your system as having only 1GB and change (RAM: 1149 Mb), so you may not have as much RAM as you think you do.  If you do have 2GB, your motherboard might not properly recognize it in which case a firmware upgrade COULD fix the issue.\nAlso, depending on what you're going to use the machine for, a 38GB hard drive is pretty tiny by today's standards. \nSurprisingly (to consumers) older RAM is often more expensive than newer, faster RAM. This is due to lack of efficiencies of scale: nobody is mass producing old RAM.\nGiven all these factors, I would take a quick look at what the RAM would cost you (maybe more than you expect), and another quick look at what an economy no frills new PC would cost you (probably less than you'd guess). As you have a PC now, you could probably get by without buying a new keyboard, mouse, and possibly monitor. \nWeigh these factors; I would lean towards limping along with what you have and putting your money and effort into something you will enjoy using (and won't wear out on you...)\n\nA: 2 GB would be good, but it looks like you have 1.25 GB. You should have enough to run Xubuntu happily. It sounds like you need to look at your swap partition, make it twice as large as your ram. If you're going to upgrade to 2 GB, have a 4GB swap partition on your disk.\n", "Q: Automatically enter a pw for a bit bucket account?

Is there an easy way to see if I installed any libraries yesterday or today, that may be causing this problem?\nFor now, I'm avoiding the problem by using Dolphin, but am worried there's a problem that will bite me in other applications.\n\nA: I don't understand how I fixed it, but this is what I did:\nI uninstalled & reinstalled python-nautilus & tortoisehg-nautilus using Synaptic. I came upon this solution as follows:\n1 Further web-searching revealed that python-nautilus can cause the \n  Nautilus crash I saw, so I used Synaptic to uninstall it  (i.e. python-nautilus)\n\nWhen python-nautilus was uninstalled, tortoisehg-nautilus was also uninstalled. This made nautilus work again, but .....\nI had since learned how to view my installation history, and saw that the most recent installations I had before my problem were of xsane-common, xsane & sane. Since the two packages I unistalled had been on my system before the problem appeared, I decided to reinstall them and then see which of the sane installs caused my problem with Nautilus.\n2 Upon reinstalling python-nautilus & tortoisehg-nautilus, Nautilus continued to work.\n\nSo, I don't know what originally caused my problem, nor do I understand why an uninstall/reinstall cycle should have fixed it.\n\nA: I also have this problem with nautilus in 13.10 ; Did you have Clam antivirus installed the new version appears to scan a folder on opening causing it to crash; after reading your problem and solution I went to have a try my self with your solution using synaptic. when I went to un-install python nautilus it gave the message that clam would have to be removed, I did this with the software centre rebooted and nautilus worked no further install needed.\nIt could be that a recent update for ubuntu may have been the root cause, but what that is I can't say, but its left nautilus vulnerable to crashes. I will point out that I had also reloaded 13.10 yesterday and nautilus worked fine with all my programs up till today and opened folder windows with no problem until an update was downloaded.\nI will say this though since I removed clam a few minutes ago and rebooted the folders are opening far quicker and so far no crash. and having just put it through its paces it seems fine at the moment, the only thing I can think of that may be a problem is the new shell integration of clam its a lot more invasive than it used to be and the new interface is I would say more than a little buggy.\n", "Q: How do I check if a package is installed on my server? I recently installed Ubuntu Server edition 13.10 (Saucy Salamander). But I have run into a bit of problem.\nAt the end of the installation, it asks about several extra packages whether you want them or not, like OpenSSH server and virtual machine host. Here's what I'm looking at:\n\nNow, my problem is that I can't remember if I have checked the \"virtual machine host\" checkbox. How do I check if my server has the corresponding packages?\nWhat packages come with the virtual machine host?\n\nA: I am writing a new answer as Tasksel 'Task names' DO NOT show up in dpkg or apt queries. Meaning the other answers are incomplete (or wrong).\n\"I can't remember If I have checked the 'virtual machine host' checkbox..\"\nCheck if there is an asterisk by the name after re-running sudo tasksel (or an ' i ' if running tasksel --list-tasks).\nIf you do not see this, then you probably do not have the 'tasksel meta-package' installed.\n\n\"..How do I check if my server has the corresponding packages?\"\nIf you want to find out what is installed under the Virtual Machine Host tasksel meta-package:\ntasksel --list-tasks\n\n(in your case tasksel --list-tasks | grep virt is enough)\nThis gives the proper task name and an indication as to whether it is installed.\nIn your case this tasksel name is virt-host.\n\n\"What packages come with the virtual machine host?\"\nFrom the last command, find the tasksel task name. This is needed for the next command:\ntasksel --task-packages virt-host\n\nThis lists the individual Tasksel meta-package (denoted by appended '^') that make up the name. In your case it's virt-host^.\nOnce you find proper meta-name you can use apt:\n apt show virt-host^ | grep \"Package:\"\n\n(or apt-cache show ... if apt show doesn't work.)\nThis will show all packages making up the given meta package.\nThen:\n dpkg -l {each individual pkg name listed above}\n\nThis will tell you if the individual package is installed/uninstalled (noted by 2nd letter: 'i' status means installed). Do this for all packages listed under the task/meta package.\nThis should answer the original questions.\nSide note: /usr/share/tasksel/descs/ubuntu-tasks.desc also holds descriptions of Tasksel meta-packages. If you: grep \"virt\" /usr/share/tasksel/descs/ubuntu-tasks.desc it will show the proper APT meta-package name. (In your case this is ubuntu-virt-server). You can also use apt commands with this meta-name.\nIf you are wanting to remove tasksel packages, this gets into the weeds a bit. Please consult this Ask Ubuntu answer or any number of other answers out there.\nPlease note that \"meta\" apt packages do not match Tasksel package names. Please consult the Tasksel Community Page for more info.\n\nA: Use tasksel (sudo apt-get install tasksel if you don't already have it) and run tasksel --list-tasks.\ntasksel will print out a list of the tasks, and there will be an i next to each task that is installed, and a u next to each task that is not installed.\nIf you wish to install the task, use tasksel install <task>.

I was just wondering if it is possible to install Ubuntu on a USB Flash Drive, and then run Ubuntu from the USB without rebooting, touching the boot menu, or installing. Just using it on Windows 7, from a USB. Then, say the USB is removed, it goes back to Windows 7.\nMany of you will probably ask why I would do this when I can just install it, and here's why:\nI already have Ubuntu installed at home, but I want to run it at school without touching anything I could get in trouble for. Also, I have no administrator rights, except I do know how to use the login screen as an admin account, but I can't download anything. (I enabled command prompt in the login screen in place of sticky keys, and then typed: explorer.exe to bring up the start menu, etc,)\nAnyway, again, I was just wondering if this is possible to do.\nThanks.\n\nA: I have successfully done this with both Portable VirtualBox and Qemu for Windows.\n\n\n*\n\n*The pro for Portable VirtualBox is that it gives you the full power of VirtualBox. (It's a modified version of VirtualBox.) The con is that it's very slow from a usb drive. If you use this, definitely go for Lubuntu and maybe even use openbox or fluxbox alone instead of the full Lubuntu session.\nPortable VirtualBox has also had some problems with bugs on Windows 7. The developer has stated that it doesn't seem to affect everyone, so it may be related to some arcane Win settings. I had it work fine on one computer, but to get it to work on another Win 7 computer I had to download an older version of the binary. (And it took some trial and error to find one that worked right.) \nAnother downside is that setting up Portable Vbox in Windows seems to mess up any pre-existing standard VBox install on the same the machine (just the app, not the VM's you may have already created). \nLinuxLiveUsb uses Portable Vbox for it's Virtualize this Key option, but the last time I tried it the Win7 bug prevented it from working; plus that option (unlike a standalone Portable Vbox) does not allow persistence.\n\n*Qemu also works well. See Qemu for Windows for the binaries and Qemu main site Qemu documentation. \nGetting a virtual machine up and running is a little more hands on than in Vbox. But it's not really difficult. This slightly dated page originally intended for Qemu on the OLAP project is helpful for getting started, but it doesn't tell you everything you need to know. \nQemu is arguably a little faster than Vbox since it's somewhat lighter. You may find some older pages saying it's too slow to use in Windows, but my experience is that is no longer true with the newer binaries. Still, you will want to make your install as light as possible with Lubuntu or similar.\n\nA: Check out portable VirtualBox  -  http://www.vbox.me/\n\nA: find out what key is used to boot into the boot selection menu, usually F8 right after (i mean right after) the bios splash screen disappears. then in the menu, you just select the device to boot from. (this doesnt change anything in the bios as in boot order or whatever. )\n\nA: \n[...] I was just wondering if this is possible to do. [...]\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Yes, it is possible - but you have to be careful.\n\n*You will obviously need 2 USB flash drives\n\n*\n\n*stick 1 is your Ubuntu Live medium\n\n*stick 2 is the blank one, on which the system will be installed\n\n\n*Stick 2 should be larger than 8GB!\n\n*Boot from stick 1\n\n*Install Ubuntu on stick 2\n\n*Install the bootloader on stick 2!\nThis is the crucial step! \nMake no mistake here and be extremely careful! \nDo not overwrite the bootloader on your working system! (You might even want to unhook the harddrives in your working system before you start the installation process).\nWhen the installation on stick 2 is finished, you might want to edit\netc/default/grub and add GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER=true to make sure that the OS on the hard drive(s) are not encluded in the GRUB menu.\nIf stick 2 doesn't boot at home, check if there's a bootable partition!\nGoood luck and enjoy!\n", "Q: How can I restore my desktop after updating? After 7 updates to Ubuntu 12.04 on my pc this evening, re-start produced a black screen with grub> and a flashing cursor. How do I get the normal desktop back?\n\nA: Your grub is dead.

But some other people say not to run it from the same window but either from live cd or usb and then run testdisk.\nWhat are the possible options and solutions in this case.\n\nA: Yeah like Rmano said, you replaced the partition that held Windows 8 with Ubuntu. Unless you have a backup, that is all gone.\n\nA: Updated after OP comments\nIf I understood correctly, you had win8 with 5 logical drives (like for ex. C:, D:, E:, F: and G:) and you wanted to install Ubuntu over Windows in c: while keeping your data in the other drives intact? I am not sure.\nHowever, since your goal is to recover your old data, you are right about using a data recovery tool, and those people you mention are right about not running them on the same partition.\nEvery data recovery program must save the recovered data somewhere, and it can't be the same disk on which the old data resides, since it could be overwritten.\nIt could also be overwritten by memory swapping to disk.\nFrom https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DataRecovery:\n\nYou should NOT write to the failed device, as it can worsen a hardware failure, and overwrite existant data in case of lost files.\nShut down the affected machine as soon as possible, and restart it from a LiveCD or LiveUSB. Be certain that the \"live\" cd does not automatically mount any partition or swap space.\n\nThey also go on explaining a lot of different solutions, and you really should read it.\nOne of the tools they suggest is \"Ubuntu rescue remix\", although not maintained for a while, but there are really plenty of alternatives, most of them on Wikipedia.\n", "Q: Dual Boot issue Ubuntu and XP I partitioned a drive and loaded Ubuntu 13 on an XP machine.\nI am learning about the operating systems and trying to make them play together.\nMy current boot executes as follows:\nSystem powers up,\nGrub asks, what do you want to load, Windows or Ubuntu\nI choose Ubuntu everything is good.

I knew these packages exists, I've seen them everyware but I never understood them.

Also it could be all the features in the \"Version\" ported to a older version (Really) and is a hybrid. I mean like here[1] they decided to go with an older version of banshee that's based on GTK 2.XX (for Trusty) but in my hypothesis this \"Hybrid/Really\" would be the GTK 2.XX based version (2.6.1) but with features from the GTK 3.XX Based version (2.9.1).

Because they reverted to 2.6.1 and can't revert the version number truly to 2.6.1 because Trusty will start to complain, they had to do it this way.\nThis does not mean it's a hybrid package.  They just reverted everything back to 2.6.1 and merged some changes from Debian 2.6.1-5 into this version.  They had to add the +really2.6.1 so that apt would see this as a higher version than 2.9.0-2ubuntu1 on Trusty systems is all.\n", "Q: I can't use libvirt with listen TCP I can't figure out how to enable libvirt with '-l' option (--listen) tcp conections in Ubuntu.

However after installation and subsequent restart, I do not get the option to choose the OS between Windows 7 and Lubuntu.This is the second time I am trying this.\nLaptop is Sony Vaio VGN -FJ 170 - an old one on which CD-Rom does not work and Boot from USB option in not available. How do I get Ubuntu on it?\n\nA: Wubi installer for Lubuntu is different from the latest wubi installer provided here . I guess you managed somehow to get the wubi installer which is specifically built for a Lubuntu install. It is located inside the standard iso file for Lubuntu 12.04, and it should be extracted first, and placed in the same directory with the LUBUNTU iso file. Then you can start installing Lubuntu using your wubi.exe command.\nFirst steps in a wubi installation involves allocating space, selecting Lubuntu from the drop-down menu, choosing username and password, and copying the files needed for installing Lubuntu and creating the virtual disks. After this, you are given the option to reboot computer, and you should see after reboot a boot screen giving you the option to choose between Win7 and Lubuntu. Are you sure you selected Lubuntu and not Ubuntu or other distro from the dropdown menu before starting the installation?\nAnyway, if Lubuntu doesn't work for you, I suggest you try Xubuntu with wubi installer. Xubuntu is also a lightweight distro and it is fast enough for your legacy machine. Place both wubi installer and Xubuntu 12.04 iso file in the same directory, and start wubi.exe. If all goes well, you should be able to boot into Xubuntu, and allow the installation process to continue, formatting your virtual disks and installing the system so you be able to use it after a second reboot. \nBy the way, Xubuntu is a little more stable than Lubuntu, and you should try this one before testing Lubuntu.\n", "Q: can't connect to BigBlueButton from external address I installed a bigbluebutton server ver 0.81.\nWhen i set ip using\nsudo bbb-conf --setip 192.168.0.190\n\nIt's the local ip address and it work fine.\nbut when i switch to my external static IP: \nsudo bbb-conf --setip 118.70.177.191\n\nthen i connect to http://118.70.177.191/ the browser can't connect to it.

It says that my account is disabled and I should contact my system administrator.\n\nA: You'll have to use some sort of recovery media, like Parted Magic or a Gentoo Disk.  The recovery disk should be x86 or x64 based on your type of system.  The Gentoo Handbook has excellent documentation for doing this, and I've used this procedure several times to restore Linux users locked out of various systems.

I want to erase Windows completely from this laptop and put only Ubuntu 32 bit on it. I see that the BIOS is UEFI and there can be some issues in installing Ubuntu. So, I want to educate myself properly before I try this.\nIs there a well tested guide for installing Ubuntu over Windows 8, in a UEFI laptop? I don't want dual boot. I want Windows off my laptop. Also, I might install more flavors of Linux alongside Ubuntu later. \n\nA: Because you have 4GB RAM in your Acer E1 laptop, and fast RAM (1600.0 MHz) at that, you will get better performance if you install the 64-bit Ubuntu instead of the 32-bit Ubuntu. Almost all of the apps that you can find are available for the 64-bit architecture, so there is no reason to select the 32-bit version of Ubuntu for the sake of application compatibility.\nThe canonical question for installing Ubuntu on a Windows 8 PC is: Installing Ubuntu on a Pre-Installed Windows 8 (64-bit) System (UEFI Supported).\n\nA: In addition to the links provided by karel, I recommend you read:\n\n\n*\n\n*My page on EFI-mode Linux installs\n\n*The Ubuntu community wiki on EFI\n\n*Adam Williamson's page on EFI\nThose pages will give you a good understanding of what EFI is, how to use it, and (generally) how to install Linux using EFI. None of them is a step-by-step tutorial, though. In fact, such a tutorial is likely to be deficient because EFIs vary so much in user interfaces, and many of them have idiosyncratic bugs.

I hope you have not updated video driver to nvidia-319 since this one can cause problems for GeForce 600 series graphic cards.\nNvidia-331 should work fine for you but if it doesn't then I suggest you install a fresh copy of ubuntu 13.10. I am a newbie, and I don't like ugrading to a higher version of ubuntu because I know very little about linux, and I could end up just like you with problems that I cannot solve by myself.\nAs for your video card, you should try go to NVIDIA website, in the Drivers section, and look for a linux driver in there : GeForce - GeForce 600 series - GeForce GTX 660 - Linux 32 or 64 bits, whatever you're using. There are plenty of tutorials on how to install a genuine NVIDIA driver in ubuntu, and if you can find a decent video driver, updating the drivers for your video card should not be a problem.\n", "Q: Need help with an script executed in terminal Can anybody tell me what is wrong in this script?\n`for i in {1..7};\n\ndo for j in {1..5};\n\n $a =$ix630;\n\n $y =$jx900;\n\n do \nmogrify \n-crop $ax$y+675+900 +repage /home/vas/Documents/Web_Design/Mold%20ISEF%202014/poster/Ready/body_final.png; \n\ndone;\n\n done`\n\n\nA: Are you trying to perform some multiplications in the nested for loops and assign the values to a and y?\nCheck out the values generated here:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfor i in {1..7}; do\n    for j in {1..5}; do\n        a=$(( $i*630 ))\n        y=$(( $j*900 ))\n        echo \"a: \" $a \"y: \" $y\n    done\ndone\n\n", "Q: How to enable mod_rewrite for virtual host The mod_rewrite rule is not working on the virtual host. \nI have wanted this for cakephp.\nIs there setting to add in the virtual host file?\n\nA: Enable Rewrite using \n# sudo a2enmod rewrite\n\nThen restart the apcahe2 using \n# service apache2 restart\n\nEnable in Virtualhost by adding\nAllowOverride FileInfo\n\nThen restart the apcahe2 using \n# service apache2 restart\n\nexample:\n<Directory /var/www/>\n            Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews\n            # I Have below line from none to FileInfo\n            AllowOverride FileInfo\n            Order allow,deny\n            allow from all\n    </Directory>\n\n\nA: If you are using latest apache version 2.4+ then here is the process how to enable mod_rewrite.\nGo to etc/apache2/\nOpen apache2.conf using your favorite text editor.\nChange\n<Directory /var/www/>\n    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks\n    AllowOverride None\n    Require all granted\n</Directory>\n\nto\n<Directory /var/www/>\n    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks\n    AllowOverride All\n    Require all granted\n</Directory>\n\nThen save it.

This could comparatively prove to be a faster way to go to the right application window when you have quite a few to handle.You can specify the number of workspace to be used in your system.\nTo swap the windows between the workspaces I use Shift+Ctrl+Alt+→, Shift+Ctrl+Alt+↓, Shift+Ctrl+Alt+←, Shift+Ctrl+Alt+↑.\n\nThese are some terminal emulators that allow multiple tab feature:\n\n\n*\n\n*konsole\n\n*guake\n\n*yakuake\n\n\nA: In KDE it is Alt+`: System Settings → Workspace Appearance and Behavior → Window Behavior :\n\n\nA: I suggest you to try out Guake, which can be installed from the software center\nsudo apt-get install guake\nHere's a screenshot\n\nI personally switch tabs by using Ctrl+Page up and Ctrl+Page down, which is also the default as far as I remember.\nAlso I've bound Guake to the menu button, which I always considered useless.

As much as I like grouping feature sometimes a window better to be ungrouped. I.e. I use midnight commander as a file manager and it goes grouped with other terminal windows which is not nice\nSo what I did is:\n\n\n*\n\n*leave gnome-terminal as default terminal app\n\n*edit /usr/share/applications/mc.desktop to execute mc within xterm session Exec=xterm  -geometry 152x42 -fa 'Monospace' -fs 19  -T \"Midnight Commander\" -n \"Midnight Commander\" -e mc\nYou can do something like this to your app. Having it wrapped to xterm makes it to be put to separate group under alt-tab. Its not a flawless solution, you'll need to deal with colour scheme, copying to buffer may give you a troble, but generally its an ok workaround.\n\nA: Following commands will help you a lot:\nCreate new terminal window in user directory: Ctrl + Alt + T\nCreate new terminal window in current working directory: Ctrl + Shift + N\nCreate new terminal tab in current working directory:Ctrl + shift + T\nMinimize a terminal window or (any open window) : super(window key) + H\nSwitch between windows of different apps: Alt + tab\nSwitch between windows of terminal(windows of current open app): Alt + tilde\n\nA: Here is a trick that I use:\n\n*\n\n*Install two (or more) different terminal applications and put both of them into your favourite activities list (the list on the left side of your screen). Put them at the top so that they would get assigned numbers 1 and 2:\n\n\n\n\n*Pressing windows + 1 / windows + 2 will let you switch between the first / second terminal applications.\n\nIn this way, you can shift between console screens using a keyboard without losing the view of the previous one.\n", "Q: Can't change my mac address - can't assign requested address I wonder, why can't I change my mac address by doing this:\nsudo ifconfig wlan0 down\nsudo ifconfig wlan0 hw ether 03:a0:04:d3:00:11\n\nThe error is SIOCSIFHWADDR: Cannot assign requested address I googled but found nothing valuable.\nP.S As usual, I can't do this. Nothing works. I took the new mac address which was incremented by 1 from my current one (old 11:11:11:11:11:cf, new 11:11:11:11:11:d0)\nsudo ifconfig wlan0 down\nsudo ifconfig wlan0 hw ether 11:11:11:11:11:d0\n\nThere was no error, it even connected to wifi automatically after I did this (even though I didn't do sudo ifconfig wlan0 up). I though it won. However, when I did \nsudo ip addr\n\nI've seen the same mac address as it had before. Nothing was changed.\n\nA: 03:a0:04:d3:00:11 is not an unicast address as the first octet needs to be even. Look at the image below to understand it better. This image is from Wikipedia - MAC address page \nso put instead 02:a0:04:d3:00:11 for example\n\n\nA: try this out c what happens\nactually there is a particular pattern of mac address which is only registered one so with a random mac address you can't change the address.\nifconfig | grep HWaddr\nifconfig eth0 down\nifconfig eth0 hw ether 00:1E:68:35:FF:91\nifconfig eth0 up\nifconfig eth0 hw ether 00:1d:92:43:f1:29\n\nBest of luck\n\nA: I assume that because you are trying to change the HWaddr of your wireless interface, that you are attempting some wireless pentesting and need to spoof your HWaddr. Well there are a few ways to do this but I will give you my method since I have not seen it included here. The following bash shell code is a very basic random HWaddr generator that I created. It isn't perfect and does have some bugs (such as certain generated MACs not being allowed to the device).\nHere is the random HWaddr function for bash:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nRAND_MAC() {\n\ngen() {\nNUM=\"$(tr -dc '0-9a-f' </dev/urandom | head -c 2)\"\necho -n \"$NUM:\"\n}\n\nfor c in {1..6}; do\n\n   if [ \"$c\" -lt \"6\" ]; then\n      gen\n   else\n      gen | tr -d ':'\n   fi\n\ndone\n}\n\nRAND_MAC\n\nNow I will explain what is going on with this function:\nRAND_MAC() is going to be the function declaration. This is pretty much letting the bash shell interpreter know \"Hey, there is a function here.\" and for it to look for open and close braces {}. After the RAND_MAC() function is declared, there is a single { followed by a nested new function declaration called gen(). Nested pretty much just means a function inside a function. The gen() function is what will randomly generate the octets of the random HWaddr. gen() is a self-contained function and only activates during the for loop below it executes. When gen() is called, a variable called NUM is assigned the value of a command's output. The command which NUM is being assigned is $(tr -dc '0-9a-f' </dev/urandom | head -c 2). This will output a 2-character string using numbers 0-9 and lower case lettersa-fin random order by pulling from/dev/urandom`. \nSo now that the function gen() is pretty much explained, the rest of the main function RAND_MAC() is going to control the show. The forloop will iterate 6 times. After the 6th iteration, the forloop moves to done and it is finished. The result is a freshly generated HWaddr you can now use with your wlan0 interface or whatever your interface is named. The reason we are using bash functions for this is to keep the data of this script from being in a global scope. We want to keep such scripts local to eliminate errors that I won't get into here. Once you have the function saved to a file, such as something like /usr/bin/macgen, give it permission to be executed. \nuser@group:~# chmod +x /usr/bin/macgen\n\nNow your new HWaddr-generating script is ready to use whenever you want from the terminal command line. You can call the tool by using the command, macgen.\nNow comes how to assign this new HWaddr using the method that hasn't been given.\nMany have suggested using ifconfig or maybe even iwconfig for changing your wireless interface's HWaddr. Well, ifconfig and even iwconfig are depreciated tools and have pretty much been superseded by the tools called ip and iw. The tool I will use in this answer is iw. The following commands will be what you need to follow to create a virtual interface, spoof it's HWaddr, and prevent having to change your real physical hardware's HWaddr. This method, to me, is much more sane and safer since we can simply bring our real physical interface down with ifconfig and use a completely virtual and fake interface to do all that we want:\nFirst, we will generate the new HWaddr to use.\nuser@group:~# macgen\n\nThen we will use ifconfig to bring the real device down.\nuser@group:~# ifconfig wlan0 down\n\nNow we can create the VNIC with iw.\nuser@group:~# iw dev wlan0 interface add mon0 type monitor addr (new mac here)\n\nAnd finally, we bring the interface up.\nuser@group:~# ifconfig mon0 up\n\nNow you should have a spoofed wireless interface in monitor mode as well as a spoofed mac address for that interface. If you need to change it's mode from monitor to managed so that you can use it to connect to an access point just do the following:\nBring the VNIC down:\nuser@group:~# ifconfig mon0 down\n\nChange the mode:\nuser@group:~# iwconfig mon0 mode managed\n\n[Quick note] Before changing the mode, make sure all other managed mode interfaces are down otherwise, you will toggle an error flag with iwconfig.\nBring interface back up:\nuser@group:~# ifconfig mon0 up\n\nCheck to make sure the configurations are correct with:\nuser@group:~# iw dev\n\nThe output should look similar to this:\nphy#0\n      Interface wlo1\n           ifindex 3\n           wdev 0x1\n           addr 00:11:22:33:44:55\n           type managed\n           channel 161 (5805 MHz), width: 40 MHz, center1: 5795 MHz\n           txpower 50.00 dBm\n\nAnd when you are ready to get rid of the VNIC, just delete it:\nuser@group:~# iw mon0 del\n\nAnd then bring your real interface back up:\nuser@group:~# ifconfig wlan0 up\n\nHope this information helps. Feel free to ask if you are confused about any of this.\n\nA: As you know only macchanger is a tool to change mac address in Linux.

If I run sudo apt-mirror /usr/bin/apt-mirror > /var/spool/apt-mirror/var/cron.log it exits with a configuration error:\napt-mirror: invalid line in config file (3: =pod ...) at /usr/bin/apt-mirror line 297, <CONFIG> line 3.\n\nI think this is because its trying to use /usr/bin/apt-mirror as a config file (cant get apt-mirror --help to work, and it gives me a similar error!) reading other documents and guides, it appears that /usr/bin/apt-mirror is to set the target location of the downloaded files, but this is not where I want them. I tried changing that to /var/mirror/www but it still gave me the configuration error.\nSo, can anyone either assist me with what the command within cron is actually doing so I can format appropriately, or can anyone confirm if I'm ok to just use apt-mirror within cron as it appears to work from the command line?\n\nA: I had the same issue, after some try and error I saw that I have 2 cron schedules for apt mirror.\n1st which gave the error was in crontab of the user \"apt-mirror\" @1900h (time of mail) and a 2nd which did not gave any error in /etc/cron.d/apt-mirror @0400h.\nAfter I disabled the 1900h job \"crontab -u apt-mirror -e\" the error was gone.\nHope this helps someone else.\nBtw the syntax in the /etc/cron.d/apt-mirror file is little different than crontab file\nthe \n/usr/bin/apt-mirror\n\nis the apt-mirror script it self and the\napt-mirror\n\nbefore the script is the username cron has to run the script as, an impersonationg thingy\n\n30 01 * * *  apt-mirror  /usr/bin/apt-mirror > /var/spool/apt-mirror/var/cron.log\n\nI think this is because its trying to use /usr/bin/apt-mirror as a config file\n\n\n", "Q: How can I get my system to email me when a critical issue is encountered, based on command output? I would like my Linux system to have a script/syslog server such that it first telnets or logs in remotely to my other system, and then executes one command (e.g. netstat -an) and if the system found their anything with \"syn_sent\" it should generate an immediate email or sms. \nHow can I set this up?\n\nA: UNIX already supports (the pretty standard) syslog logging, which enables logging of kernel and application messages and even forwarding messages to other network hosts.\nYou could use a cronjob to periodicaly execute something like:\nnetstat -nntulpa | grep SYN_SENT | logger\n\nThis will write netstat output to the local logfiles. \nTo receive the logs on a central \"loghost\", all you need is one line in the syslog config. Depending on your syslog daemon of choice, this looks like:\n*.* @192.168.5.1\n\nOn the receiving end, you can do all sorts of fancy stuff (even sending emails), provided you chose a fully-featured syslog implementation, such as syslog-ng or rsyslog.\nYour question is too broad, you could also use a monitoring solution like Icinga and a custom plugin that executes the very same command (minus the logger part). Syslog is easier to setup and supported out of the box by most applications. I hope my answered helps you on the syslog side of your question.\n\nA: If I presume the purpose is to get an email or sms when a certain activity takes place on the other system you can do the polling like you suggest or make the other system send out a log message when this event takes place. Polling is the easiest option but slow and only useful for catching long events (unless latched at the other side).\nNormally SYN_SENT happens a lot but is a fast process, polling on this without additional filtering would give kind of random behavior.\nIt would help to break down this question in multiple parts, it are many items in a single question.\nTo poll, this can be done by running a script via a cronjob which makes a connection and executes the command to see if the event takes place. Now this script can send out an email. If necessary the script can make its own log or can send a log message to syslog.\nPossible questions or googles:\nhow to execute a script via a cronjob\nhow to setup the remote connection from script (security?)\nhow to detect your event\nhow to send out an email from script\nhow to do additional logging.\n\nTo respond directly on fast events you better configure the other system to send out a log message and make the activity logged. \nSome firewall software will be able to do the logging on syn_sent, maybe even sent the log to a syslog server or you need a separate program for this. On the server side you then receive a message in you syslog-daemon which can be configured to execute a script which can send an email if necessary.\nPossible questions other machine (only for askubuntu when it is an Ubuntu machine):\nwhich firewall software\nhow to configure the firewall to log the event\nwhich program to send to remote syslog\n\nPossible questions on server:\nhow to configure syslog-daemon to run a script on incoming events\nhow to send out an email from script\n\n", "Q: Can apt-config modify apt config? I have tried to change a apt config value with apt-config but without success:\napt-config -o APT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade=1 shell\n\nIs there a another program on Debian / Ubuntu with you can customize the configuration?\n\nA: Nope, apt-config is read-only (as its --help will tell you):\n apt-config is a simple tool to read the APT config file\n\nTo persist an Apt configuration change, you need to edit/add to the configuration files in /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/. Before you start creating new files, you might want to check to see if that variable has already been set. Here's a quick grep looking for \"Periodic\":\n$ grep -R Periodic /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/\n/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/10periodic:APT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists \"1\";\n/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/10periodic:APT::Periodic::Download-Upgradeable-Packages \"1\";\n/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/10periodic:APT::Periodic::AutocleanInterval \"0\";\n/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/10periodic:APT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade \"1\";\n\nThis may differ from your computer so run it. If I were going to make any changes, I'd run sudoedit /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/10periodic. Apt should pick those up the next time one of its commands runs.\n\nNote: the above obviously applies to the apt.config side of things. There are other settings lurking around in /etc/apt/ (the parent directory of above) that may be applicable if you're trying to set other things.\n\nA: apt-config is not read-only but does not document all options in --help\n\napt 2.4.5 (amd64) Usage: apt-config [options] command\napt-config is an interface to the configuration settings used by all\nAPT tools, mainly intended for debugging and shell scripting.\nMost used commands:   shell - get configuration values via shell\nevaluation   dump - show the active configuration setting\nSee apt-config(8) for more information about the available commands.\nConfiguration options and syntax is detailed in apt.conf(5).\nInformation about how to configure sources can be found in\nsources.list(5).

And how can I fix it?\n\nA: This is a two-part problem.\nFirstly the error is a known bug in pip. It seems to mean that one of the packages (apsw here) was installed directly from a subversion repository but that the reference to it (so that it can be recreated) wasn't stored properly so it can't be referenced properly in a freeze-list.\nTo half-explain and half-compound that issue apsw isn't available in the shops on pypi. Its modern documentation says as much:\n\nAPSW is not available at the Python Package Index (pypi) and hence cannot be installed using easy_install, pip or similar tools.\n\nI'm personally not sure if I agree with that.

I have used xkb to remap the right windows key (RWIN) to Hyper_R because I want to use it with AutoKey for some special shortcuts. I did it by editing\n/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/pc\n\nmodifying the RWIN line:\n  key <RWIN> {  [ Hyper_R   ]   };\n\n(Here's the answer that guided me)\nFrom what I can tell, this works and the right Windows key now fires Hyper_R. However, It seems that in Ubuntu (Xubuntu to be exact), Hyper and Super somehow are doing the same thing. So Super + e launches the editor, and so does Hyper + e.\nI'm not sure why this is or where I can change this behavior. I want Hyper and Super to be different modifiers.\n\nA: With xmodmap you can change this behavior with 2 commands:\n## Hyper_L is mod4 by default, we will \"move\" it to Mod3\nxmodmap -e \"remove mod4 = Hyper_L\"\nxmodmap -e \"add mod3 = Hyper_L\"\n\n\nA: For some reason Ubuntu currently assigns both Super and Hyper to Mod4. You can see this in /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/pc:\n key <SUPR> {   [ NoSymbol, Super_L ]   };\n modifier_map Mod4   { <SUPR> };\n\n key <HYPR> {   [ NoSymbol, Hyper_L ]   };\n modifier_map Mod4   { <HYPR> };\n\nI was able to change this to put super and hyper on separate modifiers without needing to be root or modify any system files. I'm not sure if this is the best way as I am definitely not an xkb expert, but it's a way that has been reliable for me.\nFirst, create a local symbols file.  I have mine in ${HOME}/.config/xkb/symbols/local.  This assigns Super to Mod3 and Hyper to Mod4. \ndefault  partial modifier_keys\nxkb_symbols \"superhyper\" {\n\n    modifier_map Mod3 { Super_L, Super_R };\n\n    key <SUPR> {    [ NoSymbol, Super_L ]   };\n    modifier_map Mod3   { <SUPR> };\n\n    key <HYPR> {    [ NoSymbol, Hyper_L ]   };\n    modifier_map Mod4   { <HYPR> };\n};\n\nThen recompile the existing map to add a \"local\":\nsetxkbmap -print | sed -e '/xkb_symbols/s/\"[[:space:]]/+local&/' | xkbcomp -I${HOME}/.config/xkb - ${DISPLAY}\n\nPut this in a script to be run when you log in.

Or returns \"error\" if exit code was not 0.\nAnd finally we get \"terminal\" or \"error\" icon.\n\n\n*$(history|tail -n1|sed -e '\\''s/^\\s*[0-9]\\+\\s*//;s/[;&|]\\s*alert$//'\\'')\nhistory|tail -n1 returns the last command from history.\nsed -e '\\''s/^\\s*[0-9]\\+\\s*//;s/[;&|]\\s*alert$//'\\'') this can be separated in 2 block of sed.\n\n\n*sed 's/^\\s*[0-9]\\+\\s*//' remove all preceding spaces and tabs, all numerical after that, and also remove spaces and tabs at the end.\n\n\n*s/[;&|]\\s*alert$// removes preceding symbols ; & |, any tabs and spaces and word \"alert\".\nIt is just clean last executed command from symbols, and the word \"alert\" at the end.\nSo if you use something like this:\necho \"Hello alert\" | alert\n\nIt will show alert with previous command.\n\nA: I think the current answers explain how the inner workings of alert work (which is what I wanted to find out of curiosity and which got me here). But I think the original OP asks for what it is useful for which I'll try to explain as I understand from the commends above its declaration.\nIt is basically used to alert you when a command has finished when you can't sit watching the terminal the whole time waiting for it to finish. As per the commend example sleep 10; alert will show a notification of the command (sleep 10 in this case) with a terminal icon if it is successful (sleep 10 will take 10 seconds to complete).\nFrom this you can see that it should be used as <command>; alert where you replace command with your command. I personally have to download a video everyday via wget because it fails periodically. So I just append the download command with alert to immediately notify me when it failed so that it can be continued again (my alert is modified to also beep to get my attention).\n\nA: The reason sed, tail, and history are there is because it needs to get the message that you typed. (For some reason,) what you typed isn't directly available through any variable. Therefore, it has to use history to get the list of everything you've typed, tail -n1 to get the last thing you typed, and some regex to get rid of the \"alert\" command at the start.\nJust to expand on this, there is a conditional command in there that tests to see if $? = 0 is true. From what I can tell, if it is true, then it is coming from the terminal, and should be regarded as a normal message. Otherwise, it should be considered an error, and an error icon will appear.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 LTS Sound Problem lost my sound by installing Realtek HD Audio Drivers Linux Version got no HDMI choice tried googling for various codes ended up on Dummy Output in Sound and got no sound controll anymore can anyone help me im new :(\n\nA: Go over here\n.I hope this will be helpful.Do post if your problem is not solved.\n", "Q: Install Ubuntu on Asus P4S8X-X I have a very ancient Pc, for which I'd like to install\nUbuntu.\nMotherboard is Asus P4S8X-X and graphics Card is Asus Radeon HD4650-AGP 1GB.\nI have heard that graphics card installation could cause problems.

When running git status -sb I see:\n\nI want to watch (from procps-ng 3.3.3) a repository. The --color option is supposed to keep colours.\n\nInterestingly, it works with ls:\n$ watch --color \"ls --color\"\n\nShowing:\n\n\nHowever for git the colours disappear:\n$ watch --color \"git status -sb\"\n\n\n\nSo, why does watch show colours from ls but not from git output?\n\nA: The following statements are true:\n\n\n*\n\n*watch runs the command in a new shell, sh.\n\n*.bashrc aliases ls as ls --color=auto to enable colours.\n\n*sh doesn't inherit or use bash aliases.\n\n\nSo when watch runs ls, it's not asking for colours, it's just running the plain old version. You can circumvent this but—as aditya points out—you also need to enable colours on watch for it to process them properly.\nA working example for ls is:\nwatch --color -- ls --color=always\n\nIf you don't pass --color to watch, you'll see a bunch of ugly colour codes inline.\n\nls --color is interpreted as ls --color=always.  \nls --color=auto does not print colour in watch. This suggests that it's inferring colour support from the terminal itself.\nFor more on the reason why, we can test if the watch shell thinks its a real terminal:\n$ bash -c '[[ -t 1 ]] && echo \"real terminal\"'\nreal terminal\n\n$ watch -- \"bash -c '[[ -t 1 ]] && echo \"real terminal\"'\"\n# ... nothing.\n\nI suspect that some applications are looking at that (or similar) to tell if they should turn on colours or not.\n\nA: git uses a configuration value to determine whether to show coloured output or not.\nFor example:\ngit config --global color.ui auto\n\nThis sets the colour setting to auto globally. In auto mode, git will determine whether it's a real terminal before sending colour codes, as Oli suggested.\nYou can force this global value to always, however a better idea may be to apply it to a particular command:\ngit -c color.status=always status -sb\n\nPutting it all together:\nwatch --color git -c color.status=always status -sb\n\n\nA: It works if git (--color) and watch (-c) are told to use colors:\nwatch -cd \"git branch -va --color\"\n\n", "Q: Why do octal permissions start with 40?

(You can also set HISTCONTROL to the empty string (with HISTCONTROL= ) if you do want to keep duplicates, but that is usually not wanted.)\nHISTIGNORE='!( *)' makes history ignore every line which doesn't start with a space: ( *) would match every line starting with a space, but the leading ! negates the match, so it matches everything which doesn't start with a space. And everything what is matched by the HISTIGNORE pattern will be ignored by history.

Why it is not booting? (By the way I'm trying ubuntu 12.04 CD as a live CD)\n\nA: Speaking of boot, try to figure out which key is assigned by BIOS for getting you to the boot screen for your computer. It could be F12, or F9 or F10, just make sure you press the right key to be able to boot from CD/DVD.\nAs for deleting your old partitions, I suggest you use the  Ultimate Boot CD . It is a fine piece of work, and it is free. The iso image is around 600mb and it fits on a regular CD. Download it using the torrent link provided in there, burn it on a blank CD, and then reboot with your new Ultimate Boot CD in tray. At first boot screen you'll see a menu from which to choose (many, many useful tools in there for both Windows and Linux, including GParted). \nWhat you need is to access the HDD - Partition Management section, and from there to select the \"Cute Partition Manager\" tool. Let it load al its modules, and when finished loading do not press BROWSE instead press OK. You should finally get to the partition table for your HDD device. \nDelete all partitions in there, starting with that SWAP section, and moving to the other ones (if there are more than one left). To be able to delete partitions use the assigned keys listed at the bottom of the screen. Do not forget to save your empty partition table at the end (there is a key, I don't remember which one, for saving final partition table, press it and save your empty partition table). Exit Cute Partition Manager, take CD out of tray, and reboot, then power-off your PC. Your hard-disk should be fresh and cute like a baby now :) . \nIf you prefer GParted instead, then use that one, it is located in the same section: HDD - Partition Management.\nYou can install Win7, and make a dual boot with Ubuntu after that. Do not use Cute Partition Manager to repartition your hard-disk. I don't think Gparted is an option either if you want to install Windows and Linux in dual boot.\nBetter to use a bootable WIN-XP CD to partition your entire HDD (primary and extended partition). WIN7 DVD does not create extended partitions, only primary partitions, and I am sure you want to add extended partition (I suggest you create more than one logical drive inside the extended partition). Leave enough free space for a Linux installation, or even better create a raw logical drive inside the extended partition for your Linux system.\nPlease be aware that you will loose all your data from the hard-disk after deleting your old partitions. Use it at your own risk, don't blame me if you forget to back-up important data before using Ultimate Boot CD to wipe up your HDD.\n", "Q: How do I install Tox?

How can I solve this issue?\nAdditional info after DK Bose's posts\nWith all extensions disabled it worked sporadically better I'd, but sometimes just as buggy, for example with ubuntu-manual.org.\nStarting Firefox with a new profile (via firefox -ProfileManager) also didn't change things: \n\n\n*\n\n*reddit.com wasn't found: http://imgur.com/3JUNcBW\n\n*ubuntuusers.de was loaded only partially: http://imgur.com/LHdwV06\nI'd say it was equally bad. As reddit.com and ubuntuusers.de were loaded just normally in Chromium, it seems to be connected to Firefox on Ubuntu. Hm... really do not have a clue what is happening.\n\nA: There are some things to do which help diagnose and hopefully solve your problem.\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the Restart with Addons Disabled option under Help. This is also called Safe mode and the link explains its use.\n\n*Use the Reset Firefox option available under Help, Troubleshooting Information. That is explained in Reset Firefox – easily fix most problems.\n\n*Of course, you can also do somethings yourself:\n\n\n*\n\n*empty your cache by pressing CtrlShiftDelete and choosing appropriate options.\n\n*create a new profile by starting Firefox from a terminal using firefox -P. This will invoke a window which allows you to create a new profile. If you don't have the problem with the new profile, you could migrate several useful things like bookmarks and passwords over to the new profile. This maybe necessary if something in your olde profile corrupted and is difficult to trace.\n\n\n\nI also use Firefox and have not had problems but one of the methods listed above should help you!\n\nI realize I have not said what could cause the problem because I have not met it myself and not seen discussion of it elsewhere!\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 32bit cant login I have tried almost every comment in this subject.\nmy .xsession-errors file says:  \nopenConnection: connect: No such file or directory\ncannot connect to brltty at :0\n\nand that is all.

After this, just reboot or logout & log back in and enjoy your computer again.\nTested on my system (Xubuntu 14.04 x86, linux kernel 3.13.0-35-generic)\n\nA: I also have the same problem, cannot login to ubuntu 14.04, but now I have succeed to login ^_^. This problem also have happened to older Ubuntu version, where I get to know the solution.\nIn my case there was a mismatch on desktop config from the user I login and the available desktop config. Here what i did:\n([username] just as a placeholder)\nFirst I check the lightdm.log: \n-----------------------------------\nsudo nano /var/log/lightdm/lightdm.log\n---------------------------------------\nI had a suspicion on these lines:\n ..................\n    [+27.41s] DEBUG: Session pid=1114: User [username] authorized\n    [+27.42s] DEBUG: Session pid=1114: Greeter requests session ubuntu\n    [+27.42s] DEBUG: Seat: Failed to find session configuration ubuntu\n    [+27.42s] DEBUG: Seat: Can't find session 'ubuntu'\n..................\n\nwhy did lightdm look for \"ubuntu\" session? \nThis was because of [username] which i use its xsession is ubuntu. \nIt was on /var/lib/AccountsService/users/[username]:\n---------------------------------------\n[User]\nLanguage=en_US\nFormatsLocale=id_ID.UTF-8\nXSession=ubuntu <=====================  THIS ONE\nBackground=/home/[username]/Pictures/Wallpapers/1781785_10201241375132193_1896210726_o.jpg\nSystemAccount=false\n\n[InputSource0]\nxkb=us\n---------------------------------------\n\nThen i look at the xsession in folder /usr/share/xsessions. \nThere was only gnome.desktop, no ubuntu.desktop.\nSo that I changed the content of /var/lib/AccountsService/users/[username]:\nfrom XSession=ubuntu to XSession=gnome\n\nProblem solved ^_^\n\nA: I had the same problem on Ubuntu 13.04. \nI rewrote the gnome.desktop entry in /usr/share/xsessions because it was missing:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=GNOME\nComment=This session logs you into GNOME\nExec=gnome-session --session=gnome\nTryExec=gnome-shell\nIcon=\nType=Application\nX-LightDM-DesktopName=GNOME\nX-Ubuntu-Gettext-Domain=gnome-session-3.0\n\nThen I removed gnome-session-* and reinstall all. Afterwards everything worked fine and I could choose the session I wanted, unity, gnome and so on.\n\nA: I had a similar issue today, I noticed that some files and directories in the users home directory were owned by root, in particular .ICEAuthority, (this was most likely as a result of me trying to setup VNC). Anyway, once I used chown to change the ownership of these files back to the user I was able to login correctly again.\n\nA: I compiled Krita from source & had to modify the .profile to include the nonstandard install directory. I did it badly apparently. Once I corrected the syntax I could login as expected again!\n\nA: My problem was solved by turn off auto login.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 Lenovo Thinkpad W530 with Mini Dock Plus Series 3 - No Output via DVI Good afternoon,\n  I have a Lenovo Thinkpad W530 with the Quadro K1000m discreet GPU.  I also have a Lenovo Mini Dock Plus Series 3.  This dock has dual DVI output on the back and, according to Lenovo, this laptop + dock combination will allow me to have 3 unique displays (1x LCD panel and 2x DVI).\nWhen I dock my Thinkpad I never get any output through the DVI ports.  The screens flip back to their analogue inputs (connected to another PC).\n\n\n*\n\n*In the BIOS I've selected Optimus and OS switching in the Display settings.\n\n*I've installed and configured Bumblebee to use the Nvidia card on demand (by prefixing commands with optirun - example: optirun glxspheres64)\nIs there anything else I need to do or is it simply the case that this dock is not yet supported by Ubuntu?\nRegards\nRobC\n\nA: It seems I found a workaround although it's not ideal.\nIt so happened that I wanted to rebuild my Ubuntu 12.04 install as I'd got myself into an nvidia driver hell.  I decided to install Ubuntu with the laptop in the dock and the discreet GPU enabled in the BIOS.  This appeared to force Ubuntu to install the nvidia drivers and both of my external DVI displays are now active and I'm running my laptop in triple screen glory.\nThe downside is that I have to enable the Intel GPU in the BIOS if I want to run my laptop out of the dock and on battery power.  If I leave the discreet GPU enabled then the laptop is constantly freezing.  I suspect a driver update may fix this issue.\n", "Q: Chromebook boots into Chrome OS instead of Ubuntu When I turn off my chrombook running ubuntu 13.10 and turn it back on it always boots back into chrome OS. How can I get it so that when i turn my acer c7 chromebook running ubuntu 13.10 off then turn it back on it wont boot back into chrome OS?\n\nA: If I understand correctly, you dual-booted ubuntu and chrome os? If that's the case, just hold F8 on boot and select Ubuntu instead of chrome os.\n\nA: I have an Acer C729 chromebook. The my knowledge, there is NO WAY to for the \"legacy boot\" as the default forever.  There is an error boot screen and we need to recognized that either \na) pressing \"CNTL-d\" - ChromeOS developer mode\nb) pressing \"CNTL-l\" (el) - Legacy boot mode\nis needed.

Add a new rule.  The Description should be \"Shrinking gnome-terminal workaround\".  Click the 2nd tab, \"Size & Position\".  Then click the bottom checkbox option, \"Obey geometry restrictions\", to \"Force\", and then set the radio button to \"No\".

I'm trying to understand what ubuntu requires in the way of drivers (wireless, video, audio etc) when it's going to be installed on a laptop.\nI noticed when I ran Ubuntu from a memory stick that I could not get data to pass thru the Ethernet port nor the wireless card. When I installed Ubuntu in a \"side by side\" arrangement on this same XP laptop the Ethernet port worked and the wireless card works.\nSo is the expectation for laptops that you have to have windows drivers already in place and Ubuntu has to be installed side by side?\nIf I had a blank disk-drive would I need to find and download windows drivers and install them via Ubuntu?\nI'm not understanding the approach that needs to be taken regarding wireless, video and audio drivers and Ubuntu?\nThanks.\n\nA: The answer depends entirely on the specific laptop. A great many drivers exist by default in the kernel for common devices. Laptop manufacturers, however, love to surprise the world, and by extension Ubuntu, with new devices for which there is only a mostly working Windows driver. In those cases, a question and answer here on this site usually solves the problem.\nThere are a few wireless drivers that require proprietary firmware files or drivers. Ubuntu is not truly free and open source if it includes by default those files and so the option is given to install additional drivers during install.\n\nSo is the expectation for laptops that you have to have windows\n  drivers already in place and Ubuntu has to be installed side by side?\n\nNot at all. I am fairly certain that your experience was anomalous. A great many of us here have no Windows install at all. In my own case, on a Lenovo T410i, I did a bare harddrive install and everything worked as expected right from the start.\nI urge you to try the live USB or DVD again and if everything works as expected this time, install. If not, post a question with specific questions. If you want extra assurance, remove the Windows harddrive entirely before you start. \n", "Q: Unable to do anything because im stuck on a single screen with dual monitor setup My second monitor is not being detected on my main ubuntu account(writing this from guest atm).

A little background on this.\nIt's an 256 GB SSD drive with Windows SP3 32-bit and it's encrypted with PGP Whole Disk Encryption. The file system is corrupt and unreadable.\nI first ran Clonezilla to clone the drive with -q1 (sector clone) and Clonezilla could not start the clone process because it said the drive is physically damaged (does it determine this by using SMART or looking at the G-List?). I then checked off -rescue (skips bad sectors) and it cloned.\nI wanted a better image/clone so I found Ubuntu Rescue Remix Live CD and ran GNU ddrescue. I created an image of the SSD drive using the following syntax:\nsudo ddrescue -r 5 -v -d {source drive} {dest drive/imgfile} logfile\n(retries bad sectors 5 times; verbose output to screen; direct access mode to skip kernel cache).\nIt finished in 2:30-3:00 hours. The average transfer rate was around (25.88 MB/s) (I used eSATA and SATA, respectively, to transfer data). It also lists \"errors: 116\" and \"errsize: 470 kB\". For the record, the program lists \"Sector size: 512 bytes\" and \"Copy block size: 128 sectors\". \n(I cannot post an image because I am new.)\nTwo things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Are the results saying that 116 errors (sectors or blocks?) totaling 470 kB were found and transferred or found and not transferred? If you notice, the program says it's about to copy 256052 MB and it says it rescued 256052 MB. So, I'm really not sure. \n\n*Is 116 errors considered to be a lot and indicative of physical damage?\n\n\nFor the moment, I can confirm that, at the very least, over 99% of data was transferred. I'd say that's pretty good. In fact, the rough calculation is: 1 - (470 kB/256 GB) =~ 0.9999981640625 --> 0.9999981640625 * 100 ~ 99.9998%. \nAgain, Clonezilla couldn't clone, at first, because it reported that the drive is physically damaged. Yet, while GNU ddrescue reported 116 errors, at least most of the data was imaged. I know there are logical errors on the drive. But is this drive physically damaged based on 116 errors totaling 470 kB?\nLastly, what is an error? Is that number of bad blocks, sectors, or something else? And is it at all related to errsize. In my case, it's 116 errors and errsize of 470 kB. But I have seen other scans on the Internet with 1 error and 500 GB errsize. So, I'm not sure what the correlation is there.\nUpdate\nI got no reply so I'll update and hope someone out there smarter than me will reply with some answers.\nI ran GNU ddrescue once more, with read retries increased from 5 to 20. Everything else is the same, including the results (it took slightly longer to image than the first time, because of the read retry increase). Yes, the error count and error size (still don't understand their relationship or what an error means in this program) are 116 and 470 kB, exactly the same as the first time I imaged with this program. What could that mean? Put a gun to my head, I'd say this SSD drive is not physically damaged. And if it is, it's slight. I still don't know if 116 errors is a lot, but here's why I think there's no physical damage. If there was, wouldn't the error count and error size go UP the 2nd time I imaged the drive, especially with increasing the read retries to 20? \nI wanted the errors to go down, which is why I tried imaging again. I don't have much experience with SSDs. But perhaps they differ from mechanical disks in that if you can't read a bad block, most likely you won't be able to, no matter how many times you retry. I'm assuming data recovery services have vastly superior software and hardware tools that could read bad blocks from an SSD, however.\nThis SSD drive has been slaved quite a few times to analyze and also attempt decryption. I've cloned with it Clonezilla (which claims it's physically damaged), and then I imaged it twice with GNU ddrescue with one parameter value increased and the image results are exactly the same. One would think that with all that this drive has been through, if it was failing, it would take a long time to read from/write to and the number of errors would increase. But none of that has happened. Maybe I'm just getting lucky and it is physically damaged. But if it is, I think it's slight.\nBut I'll ask again: Is 116 errors a lot? What's the correlation of errors to error size, when I've read accounts of image results with 1 error and an error size of many, many GBs? And is an error here in terms of sectors, blocks, or some other measurement?\nThank you.\n\nA: The ddrescue manual's Algorithm section describes errsize and errors. errsize is the sum of the sizes of the bad-sector \"blocks\" where a \"block\" is ddrescue's term for a range of contiguous bad sectors. On the other hand, errors is the count of these bad-sector \"blocks\".\nAs the manual describes, on each pass after the first, the bad-sector \"blocks\" are retried and might get split up. As bad sectors are read successfully, errsize will decrease and errors could increase or decrease (because a block might get split by a good sector or all the bad sectors in a block have been successfully read, respectively).\nSo, answering your question, \"is the number errors is a lot?\", you have to look at the errsize rather than errors. On a 256GB SSD, I don't think 470kB (less than 0.0002% of the drive) are very many errors at all.\nYou should also look at smartctl and the S.M.A.R.T. self-tests to sense of the health of the drive. IMHO, once a drive starts failing the pre-fail tests, it's usually not worth the risk of data loss to continue using the drive.\n", "Q: Can i install Ubuntu 13.10 64bit on my Lanovo g580 Laptop I have a Lenovo G580 i5 Processor, 8GB Ram and 500GB HDD.

I suppose I might be able to use awk to get the PID from the output from netstat, but how do I safeguard and make an exact port match so that the input 80 won't match 8080 and likewise? Should I make it a C program instead? Or is there already a small utility like this?\n\nA: A command can be formulated like this:\nnetstat -lpn | grep \":1234\\b\" | awk '{sub(/\\/.*/, \"\", $NF); print $NF}' | xargs -i kill -kill {}\n\nExplanation:\n\n\n*\n\n*netstat -ltpn\n\n\n*\n\n*This lists the listening ports (l) on TCP (t) and their programs (p) without resolving port numbers to names (n).\n\n\n*grep \":1234\\b\"\n\n\n*\n\n*This searches for :1234 followed by a boundary (\\b), indicating the end of the word (or number, in our case).

It could use with a little bit more sanitization.

On windows 8.1, I used to get atleast 2-2.5 hours with decent load on. Even when I put the laptop to sleep(i.e by closing the lid or the fn+Zz hotkey) the battery drains too quickly for my liking\n2) When using Windows, if I put my laptop to sleep for more than 5 minutes, if I try to wake the laptop on, it directly jumps to the default Grub screen . I'm not able to go to the previous session in windows, I need to restart windows all over again sacrificing all my previous work.\n3)Once I shift from a session on windows to Ubuntu, all the apps that require information from my other drives(i.e D,E,F drives) seem to reset itself. I utilize EiskaltDC++, clementine, both these apps require access files from the other drives but I need to refresh/(remove+add again) for these apps to have access to these particular folders.\nI understand this might be a problem due to the way I installed Ubuntu. Would it be better if I allocate a completely different drive for Ubuntu? I would be glad to do this, heck I would prefer to completely segregate windows 8 and Ubuntu  and that was the initial plan but most of the tutorials for dual booting never addressed this.\nI like Ubuntu for the amount I've used it, if it were not for FIFA I would shift over to Ubuntu completely.\nYour inputs/help would be well appreciated.\nEdit:\n1)As suggested by Sean, here are the outputs of etc/temp and mount -l\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B07sfcCrfAN5TFE1RGkwRG5lRTQ/edit?usp=sharing\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B07sfcCrfAN5YVllUlJULVYyUXc/edit?usp=sharing\n\nA: 1) Battery life can be tweaked after you get the system running smoothly but likely poorer than Windows until an improvement happens in the kernel.\n2) Check that your Windows session isn't going into hibernation after it's in sleep for a while.

Or that machine might not work. \nIf anyone knows about archaic Varian OSes / File-systems, I would be happy to hear about it.\nImage mounting is current priority, I have been able to get disk images using ddrescue, and or safecopy. Both softwares show that there is block errors on some disks.\nI am still unable to mount the images the disks produce, mount persistently asks for \nfile-system type.

Said something about a custom 5 1/4\" format for disks, customized BIOS routines - I skimmed it.  Sounds like it runs from DOS, so maybe it'll work from DOSBOX?  Here you go:\nhttp://nmr.tamu.edu/vhelper.php\nRe-reading it a bit, the last class of computer that they say it reliably works with is a 486 and almost not at all with Windows.  If all else fails, at least you have some EXEs you can work backwards from to potentially determine the format.  Here's hoping there's not a whole lot of BIOS patching going on.  If you need to attack the Pascal EXE, you'll want to UnLzExe/Upack/Uncompress it before you toss it into your decompiler. Program files from that era are almost always compressed in some fashion. Good luck.\nOlder Updates\nGot a lot of tips for you here:\n\n\n*Most motherboards these days have the floppy controller turned off, have you verified \nthat it is turned on?\n\n*Also, turn on the option for a floppy drive seek.  If it doesn't seek, you have a problem of some type.\n\n*Let see, what else... if the connector looks like a Nintendo NES cartridge connector, it is more likely a low density drive (360kiB).  If it looks like the old PATA connectors, then it is more likely the 1.2 MiB high density disks.  You won't be able to read HD disks in a standard 360k drive.\n\n*Oh, also, if the light is amber or green the entire time you turn on your computer, the cable is plugged in upside down.  Flip that bad boy over, and you'll be good to go.\n\n*And finally, if this is a Apple / Commodore / Atari branded floppy, you have to have a special card to make it work with an IBM PC. And you will surely NOT be able to read those style disks in an IBM PC drive.  Their sectors, clusters and maybe even initial head positions are in different places. I've heard of 3rd party cards that will allow a PC to interface with the drives, but I don't recall what they are.\n\n*More info is good.  Please share what brand/make/model of floppy you are trying to use, and what your motherboard make/model is.\nEdit: Earned a downvote because the question changed, and I didn't change my answer fast enough.  Or it's formatted like crap.  Fair enough.\nUpdated Answer\nDid you say those had 13 sectors per track? Wonder what kind of disks those are? Research says that they are likely Apple ][ floppies; I don't believe you can read those with a native IBM PC floppy controller. They could also be C64 or Atari disks\nThis isn't the one I remember, but it may help you out: http://www.deviceside.com/fc5025.html\nNote: It says it cannot help you read \"flippy\" disks without an Apple/C64/Atari drives.\nGNU ddrescue\nOh, I see that you are using ddrescue.  Last version I used was 1.14, I can't imagine 1.16 is too different. Remember use -c15 for 5.25 QD, and -c18 for 3.5 HD.\nQuick Rip, not using direct access. Log will help you remember that it is all good:\nsudo ddrescue -Bv -c15 /dev/fd0 floppy.img floppy.img.log\nIf the disk has bad spots, skip them. Use log for just hitting bad spots next time\nsudo ddrescue -Bndv -c15 /dev/fd0 badfloppy.img badfloppy.img.log\nIf you need to get down and dirty and work around bad sectors, this splits and retries 5 times.\nsudo ddrescue -Bd -c15 -r5 /dev/fd0 bf2.img bf2.img.log\nMounting images\nThat is something I can answer!\nTo (hopefully) determine fs type:\nfile -Ls floppy.img\nOR\nfile -Ls /dev/fd0\nNow, once you can mount it loopback.  \nmount -t msdos -o loop floppy.img /mnt/floppy\n\nIf it does manage to be one of those pesky HPFS disks, you may be able to use fdisk to determine the offset to mount the hpfs partition, because what you can initially see is just the HPFS FAT-equivalent.  I've used it for hard disks before, it shouldn't be that different. Update your question, and I'll return and (hopefully) answer it.\n\nA: If they're in DOS format, you probably want to use the tools from the mtools package rather than trying to mount it.\nInstall the mtools package from the archive, and then use \"mdir\", \"mcopy\", etc. to access the files.\n\nA: By default, the floppy kernel module is not loaded. To load the module, invoke \nsudo modprobe -v floppy\n\nRemember to add your user to the \"floppy\" group; to do that use \nsudo adduser $USER floppy\n\nAfter the module is loaded you should be able to access the hardware and mount floppies.\n", "Q: Emacs-23 does not open its file arg; Double-clicking on file opens blank emacs When I double-click on a file and open it with emacs-23, emacs ignores its first input.

I've figured out how to add an application icon to the .desktop file, but I'm not sure where to add the window icon itself.  I've seen code for setting Applicaton.windowIcon with C++, but I'm just using QML/JS.  How can I add my icon to the application configuration?\n\nA: Setting the icon in your .desktop file is adding it to your application configuration, so I'm not quite sure what you're asking.  As long as the icon is installed with everything else, you should be all set.  If you're installing via a click package, a relative file name for the icon in the .desktop file is all you need; otherwise, you may want to use an absolute path.\nIf you're trying to get the icon set for a program that isn't installed, you can add the desktop file to ~/.local/share/applications/.  IIRC, this file won't be immediately detected, but it will be loaded eventually.  Logging out and then back in will probably force a refresh.\nIf you want to adjust the icon programmatically while the application is running, I can't help you.  I'd be surprised if you could do that through pure QML, but it might be easy to write a C++ plugin.\n\nA: First add the icon to a resource file. Your assets.qrc may look like this\n<RCC>\n    <qresource prefix=\"assets/\">\n         <file alias=\"logo.png\">assets/icons/logo.png</file>\n    </qresource>\n</RCC>\n\nNext you need to set the application icon on the C++ side\n#include <QGuiApplication>\n#include <QIcon>\n#include <QString>\n\nint main(int argc, char** argv) {\n    QGuiApplication app(argc, argv);\n    QGuiApplication::setWindowIcon(QIcon(\":/assets/logo.png\"));\n    // next do whatever is needed to set up the qml engine\n}\n\nThis should effectively set the application icon.

After installing and updating the system, Ubuntu has been using the Open Source drivers for her GPU - the AMD HD7850 with 1 GB of GDDR5.\nThe issue\nGames such as Nexuiz, Xonotic, Half-Life 1, Starbound and even No More Room in Hell run extremly good, at a minimum of 60fps, 1080p and with high details, but Left for Dead 2 runs at a low framerate (20-30fps) at low details. Other games, such as Rust and Anna, don't run at all (black screen). For this reason, above all, I recommended installing the proprietary AMD video drivers for her GPU. \nThe question now is; which one is the stable/recommended driver? \n\nThey're all the same, they all have the exact same description. I assume one of those is recommended and the others are beta drivers, just like it was in Ubuntu 12.04.3 64-bit. Or maybe the Open Source AMD driver has become the recommended driver, I don't know.\nThanks!\n\nA: As a general rule for myself, if they all say the same thing then I check the description, in which case it was the same again. Most of the time, the second and third entries are an update and an experimental driver. I'd pick from the top and work my way down if nothing changes. The thing is it removes the previous driver and stops using it when you click to install one of the others.\nI'd recommend going to the Ubuntu Help Page for Binary Driver installation. I just last night, installed Ubuntu 12.04.4 LTS on my desktop running AMD 995 Black Edition CPU with HD Radeon 6970 GPU, and nothing would install and kept wanting to send error reports. Now I realize this isn't your problem, but to avoid the problem because it was a pain, try removing/purging all traces of any previous 'fglrx' drivers installed prior, and clean it out, then re-install, and not from menu but via command line. I've always had the best results doing everything by command line and while I'm also aware that some users are worried about messing something up, its also the best way to learn. At the very worst, you'll have to re-install 12.04.4 LTS which you can quite easily do.\nAlso take a look at AMD Driver and Support website and read up about their latest proprietary driver release as there are some instructions on there as well.\nAnd ofcourse don't forget to check which one you need to if you do do it via the AMD website or by command line, 32bit or 64bit.\nBinary Driver How To\nAMD Support Website Catalyst 13.12 x86\n\nA: I'll answer my own question.\nThe issue mentioned in my question above was fixed yesterday.

You can wait and, in my case, exit from the Sony or Media player program (that will not work without a license).  \n\n*Start VLC.  Go to tools, then VLC configuration.  This is where it the drive to find video is defined (I think).\n\n*Then go to \"select input\".  At the disk drive, select e: (or whichever drive you want).  Then close.\n\n*Now, back at VLC with menus, choose playback, then play.  A window opens up.  \n\n*Choose the disc tab.  Then at \"disc device\", use the drop menu to choose your drive (which should have the video title).  Click on play and wait...  You'll see your dvd drive working (led light is on).  Eventually, your movie will start (at least mine did after about a minute).\n\n\nNow, I have a Windows 8 computer to fix because it was misdiagnosed as a registry problem by the Lenovo guys and they really screwed me up.

I would like to be able to quickly determine if a string is in the file. Ideally, this would be done using a binary chop type algorithm.\nSome Googling revealed the look command with the -b flag which promises to locate and output all strings beginning with a given prefix using a binary search algorithm. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to work correctly and returns null results for strings that I know are in the file (they are properly returned by the equivalent grep search).\nDoes anyone know of another utility or strategy to search this file efficiently?\n\nA: Maybe a little late answer:\nSgrep will help you.\nSgrep (sorted grep) searches sorted input files for lines that match a search key and outputs the matching lines. When searching large files sgrep is much faster than traditional Unix grep, but with significant restrictions.\n\n\n*\n\n*All input files must be sorted regular files.\n\n*The sort key must start at the beginning of the line.\n\n*The search key matches only at the beginning of the line.\n\n*No regular expression support.\n\n\nYou can download source here:\nhttps://sourceforge.net/projects/sgrep/?source=typ_redirect\nand the documents here:\nhttp://sgrep.sourceforge.net/\nAnother Way:\nI don't know how large is the file.Maybe you should try parallel:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/9066609/fastest-possible-grep\nI always do grep with files which size > 100GB, it works well.\n\nA: There's an essential difference between grep and look:\nUnless explicitly stated otherwise, grep will find patterns even somewhere within the lines. For look the manpage states:\n\nlook — display lines beginning with a given string\n\nI'm not using look very often, but it did work fine on a trivial example I just tried.\n\nA: You could hash the file into pieces and then grep just the piece you wanted:\nfor line in $(cat /usr/share/dict/american-english | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | sort | uniq)\ndo\n    prefix=$(echo $line | md5sum - | cut -c 1-2)\n    mkdir -p $prefix\n    echo $line | gzip >> $prefix/subwords\ndone\n\nthen the lookup would look like:\n    prefix=$(echo $word | md5sum - | cut -c 1-2)\n    zgrep -m 1 -w word $prefix/subwords\n\nThis does two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*read and write compressed files. It's generally faster to put the load on the cpu (very fast) instead of the disk (very slow)\n\n*hash things in order to get an approximately equal distribution, you can use a shorter or longer hash as you'd like in order to reduce the size of each piece (but I'd recommend using nested subdirs if you do)\n\n\nA: sgrep might work for you:\nsudo apt-get install sgrep\nsgrep -l '\"needle\"' haystack.txt\n\nThe project page http://sgrep.sourceforge.net/ says:\n\nSgrep uses a binary search algorithm, which is very fast, but requires sorted input.\n\nFor insertion however, I think there is no better solution than using a database: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10658380/shell-one-liner-to-add-a-line-to-a-sorted-file/33859372#33859372\n\nA: If you want it really fast (O(1) fast) you can build a hash set to look into. I couldn't find an implementation that would let me store a pre-built hash set in a file and probe it without having to read the entire file into memory, so I rolled my own.\nBuild the hash set (-b/--build):\n./hashset.py --build string-list.txt strings.pyhashset\n\nProbe the hash set (-p/--probe):\n./hashset.py --probe strings.pyhashset \\\n    'Is this string in my string list?'

I'm experimenting using Juju (16.6) to deploy services to our private Openstack cloud and have noticed a couple of issues.\nWhen bootstrapping a new environment, Juju apparently wants to look in the environment's bucket for image metadata.  I've created a \"public\" bucket, using Swift for the object store, and populated it with the image meta-data in \"streams/v1/*\" object paths - however when bootstrapping juju fails unless the meta-data is in the environment's private bucket. Is this normal? And is there a work around in the environment's config to fix this problem?  \nMy environment is as follows (less ssh keys):\naccess-key: \"\"\nadmin-secret: \"\"\nagent-version: 1.16.6\napi-port: 17070\nauth-mode: userpass\nauth-url: http://173.23.181.5:5000/v2.0\nauthorized-keys: 'ssh-rsa `...\n...\nca-private-key: \"\"\ncontrol-bucket: juju-bucket\ndefault-image-id: \"\"\ndefault-instance-type: \"\"\ndefault-series: precise\ndevelopment: false\nfirewall-mode: instance\nimage-metadata-url: \"\"\nlogging-config: <root>=INFO\nname: openstack-ws\npassword: xxxxxxxxxx\npublic-bucket: juju-dist\npublic-bucket-url: \"\"\nregion: regionOne\nsecret-key: \"\"\nssl-hostname-verification: true\nstate-port: 37017\ntenant-name: WebServices\ntools-url: \"\"\ntype: openstack\nuse-floating-ip: true\nusername: xxxxx\n\nOnce I get the environment to bootstrap, I next try to bring up a service.  In my case, I'm using the Hadoop charm.  When I deploy the hadoop master (juju deploy hadoop hadoop-master), the instance fails to initialize with a \"hostname: name or service not known error\".  I suspect this is due to failure of a reverse DNS lookup on the instances \"public\" IP address. Does this sound correct? What is the issue?\n\nA: Both public-bucket and public-bucket-url settings were deprecated some time ago and are  ignored. Only the control-bucket is used, if specified - otherwise it's randomly generated. The private bucket is now the only way to override fetching juju tools with a specified version from simplestreams data.\nFor example, running juju bootstrap --upload-tools after ensuring you ran the equivalent of:\n# cd $GOPATH/src/launchpad.net/juju-core/cmd/juju\n # go install .\n # cd ../jujud\n # go install .\npackages the juju binaries (juju and jujud) from $PATH into a release tarball and uploads it to the control-bucket. Then, cloud-init script runs when the bootstrap machine boots, downloading and installing the most recent current tools (which--upload-tools always ensures). So juju bootstrap --upload-tools, if hacky it's certainly useful to test changes to the juju-core source in an actual deployment.\nAlternatively, you could run:\njuju sync-tools --all --public --source=~/.juju/local/storage/tools/release/\n\nright after running juju bootstrap -e local --upload-tools\n(assuming you've run the 2 go install commands mentioned earlier, when building from source).

I've been following this guide: http://pastebin.com/fDpqvSi5 to try and get it installed correctly, but I keep running into an issue when trying to install \"freeglut3-dev\". I have followed the guide I linked on a fresh Ubuntu 12.04 install up to installing the libraries needed for the CUDA samples.\nI tried using:\nsudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev\n\nbut get the following error:\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies.\n freeglut3-dev : Depends: libgl1-mesa-dev or\n                          libgl-dev\n                 Depends: libglu1-mesa-dev but it is not going to be installed or\n                          libglu-dev\nE: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.\n\nWhen I try and install libgl1-mesa-dev or libglu1-mesa-dev a seemingly endless chain of dependencies is required which creates more dependencies for freeglut3-dev as well. The guide I am following is for Ubuntu 12.04.3, would there have been a change which means I need to do something different now?\nAny help much appreciated, thanks.\n\nA: I'm really not sure if this has anything relevant to do with your situation but figured I'd contribute a direction to pursue anyway, since your question has no other hits yet.\nI just installed 12.04.4 fresh (no upgrade from previous version) and had no problem installing freeglut3-dev with apt-get, as you've tried unsuccessfully. You say in your OP that you follow directions for installing on a fresh ubuntu 12.04.3 install, but don't specify whether you have a fresh install yourself, or have upgraded from an older release.\nThat said, since my fresh install I have installed a range of related libraries as I'm also in the process of getting CUDA running. Perhaps something I did triggered a series of packages to be installed that resolved this issue in a proactive way. I did break and fix ubuntu-desktop, unity, and compiz a few times in the process, so a lot has happened.\nHowever, in my tinkering the following linked information turned up in finding out exactly what the differences are in 12.04.4 from previous 12.04 releases. It relates to some optional components you may or may not have in your current install depending on how you arrived at 12.04.4\nhttp://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2014/02/ubuntu-12-04-4-released-new-kernel\nNot sure if it'll help, or hinder, but worth a read-through anyway.\nEDIT: Additional information might be found here https://launchpad.net/~xorg-edgers/+archive/ppa in the first few paragraphs. This is predominantly related to a ppa source for the most recent nvidia drivers, as opposed to installing from .run packages, but contains some other potentially relevant information.\nIn summary, I wonder if perhaps your problem is related to the fact that fresh installs of 12.04.4 have Precise X backport stacks, which I understand is an optional component of upgrading to 12.04.4 from an older release, as discussed in the first link I posted.\nIn other words, perhaps your issue is related to kernel version vs. mesa version. Maybe try a better package manager such as synaptic to see what version of these mesa packages is being fed to your system, upon which freeglut3-dev is dependent. My mesa packages are 8.0.4-0ubuntu0.7, and am running kernel 3.11.0-17-generic.\n", "Q: GPU Temp is weird? I am not sure if this has anything to do with it but I just upgraded my kernel in Ubuntu 13.10 from 3.11.0-15 to 3.11.0-17. I never thought about temperatures before but I just decided to download a monitor to see what the temperatures were. I have a AMD Radeon 4870 which at idle will sit at 84-86 Celsius. The weird thing is that even when I am playing a game like Counter Strike my GPU temp will stay at about 87-88 Celsius which is not much higher than at idle. Counter Strike is a pretty graphically intense game. Maybe it is just the temp that my card like to be at. Even when I put my fans from low to medium the temperature stayed the same. Should I be concerned at those temperatures or is it not that big of a deal?\n\nA: That is normal for radeons -- they run hot.  It speeds its own fan up when it runs hard to stay about that temperature.\n\nA: I agree with psusi.\n104C is the maximum safe temperature according to AMD/ATI. (although I couldn't find any documents from AND to substantiate that).  I have an AMD AIW, and that hits 75C-80C easily.\nNow, the fact that your 4870 is OLD, and it has a better processor than my card, that might be OK. Keeping that in mind, it may very well be full of dust. make sure that you clean the fan real well.  You may want to take it to an auto shop, and use there air drier to blow the dust out, or you can get a can of compressed air to do that.\n\nA: Ubuntu doesn't now switch between your GPU automatically.\nWith the latest release of Ubuntu, Hybrid Graphics are now officially supported by Ubuntu. \nYou need to install following package \n1.fglrx \n2.fglrx-pxpress\nAfter then you can switch you AMD gpu when needed.\nType sudo apt-get install fglrx fglrx-pxpress to install it.\nI have not tested it yes but you can find more on webupd8.\n", "Q: How to prevent right-click opening new terminal instance I often copy text into the terminal, for instance from a website or for a particularly difficult to spell filename, when I right-click the terminal to paste things however one of two thins will happen: the menu will appear or a new terminal will open.\nHow can I prevent the latter behavior?\n\nA: This is due to the fact that even if you might not notice it, your click becomes a double click, because sometimes we don't press the button firmly enough. So the first click opens the menu, and the second one opens the first item on it, which is \"open new terminal\", even if you don't get to see the menu because it's too fast.\nYou could try to adjust the variable multiClickTime to, lets say, 800 milliseconds:\necho \"*multiClickTime: 800\" >> $HOME/.Xresources\n\nThis basically ignores any click unless it's been at least 800 milliseconds since the last one (almost a second). You can lower the value if you think is too long.\nHope it helps.\n", "Q: Change password on root user and user account If I change the password for the root user is that going to automatically change the password for the user account? \nI found this link for root:\nWikiHow: How to Change the Root Password in Linux\nHow do I change the user account password?\n\nA: To do it using command line:\nTo change the root password:\nsudo passwd\n\nTo change your user password:\npasswd\n\nTo change other users password:\nsudo passwd USERNAME\n\nTo do it GUI open the application User Accounts from the Dash and there you can change password easily for all users unless the root\n\nA: As a user, you can change your own password in a terminal, using passwd.

So I've created a \"task\" job to perform a few checks, and then if those checks don't pass, apache should not be allowed to shut down.\nI thought I could do something such as the following:\nstart on stopping apache\n\ntask\nscript\nif some_condition; then\n    start --no-wait apache\nfi\nend script\n\nBut the other service still shuts down, it just gets immediately started back up. I can't have this, it must not shut down at all.\nI've put a sleep statement in the above script, and it does delay the service from stopping. So if the service is still running, I would think I should be able to prevent it from shutting down.\n\nA: So after digging through the upstart source code, the only time an upstart script can abort an operation is in the 'pre' phase (pre-start/pre-stop). When you use a trigger such as start on stopping foo, the service receives the event after the pre-stop phase for 'foo', so you cannot start it back up without it first stopping.\nHowever when you have a start on stopping foo condition, you the 'foo' service wont stop until the service listening to the event finishes. So what I ended up doing is simply looping forever until the condition I'm checking is met. It's not the greatest solution but it works.\n\nAn alternate solution would also have been to create a .override file for the service and put a pre-stop script in the override. The condition could then be checked in the pre-stop and issuing a start will keep the service from stopping.\nUnfortunately this doesn't quite work for me due to other complicated reasons, but it might be an option for anyone else trying to do this.\n", "Q: Installing ubuntu over windows8.1 I have windows 8.1 pre-installed in my laptop. But I really didn't like it. Ubuntu is much better. I don't have much knowledge related to how things are done. I want to install Ubuntu in place of windows. But I also want a copy of my windows8.1 so that in future if I ever need I might install windows 8.1 again. I was not provided a windows 8.1 cd with my laptop.\n\nA: there should be a  option within windows to create recovery media. I used a flash drive for my windows 8 machine. this comes straight from microsofts website how to create recovery media. \nSwipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap Search.\n(If you're using a mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer down, and then click Search.)\nEnter recovery drive in the search box, and then tap or click Create a recovery drive.\nAdministrator permission required You might be asked for an admin password or to confirm your choice.\nAfter the recovery drive tool opens, make sure the Copy the recovery partition from the PC to the recovery drive check box is selected, and then tap or click Next.\n    Note\n    If your PC doesn’t have a recovery partition, then the checkbox is greyed out and the recovery drive will include only the recovery tools and a bootable image, but not a recovery image to use for refreshing or resetting your PC.\n\nInsert a USB flash drive into your PC that is at least as large as the size indicated on the screen.\n\nTap or click the USB drive you would like to use for your recovery drive, then tap or click Next.\n\nTap or click Create.\n\nThe recovery image and necessary recovery tools will be copied to your USB flash drive, which will take a while, depending on your PC and the size of the recovery image.\n\nWhen the process is done, do one of the following:\n\n    If you want to keep the recovery partition on your PC, tap or click Finish.\n\n    If you want to remove the recovery partition from your PC and free up disk space, tap or click Delete the recovery partition. Then tap or click Delete. This will free up the disk space used to store your recovery image. When the removal is done, tap or click Finish.\n\nRemove the USB flash drive.\n\nThis is now your Windows 8.1 recovery drive, and you'll need it if you ever need to refresh or reset your PC. Keep it in a safe place and don't use it to store other files or data.\nNotes\n\n    If your PC came with Windows 8 and you upgraded it to Windows 8.1, your recovery drive will include Windows 8, and you’ll need to upgrade to Windows 8.1 after you refresh or reset your PC.\n\nI have been using Ubuntu and sabayon in dual boot configuration, converted my disc to MBR, and completely wiped all traces of windows 8 off my system. Hopefully that helps you figure out what you need to do to backup windows. you could just install ubuntu alongside windows 8.1 as well. Ubuntus installer is very helpful in helping you figure out how much space you want to give to ubuntu.\n\nA: Why don't you dual boot Ubuntu and Windows 8?\nAll you have to do is create a partition within windows with however much amount of memory you wish to designate to each operating system but I would imagine since you would like to use Ubuntu assign it with more memory.\nThis way you wouldn't lose your copy of windows and since Ubuntu becomes the default OS when you dual boot, you get what you would like. Also you could access windows 8 in any circumstance that you may actually need to use windows although the probability of that is low since you can basically do anything you need you need to do on windows, on Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Ubunty 12.04 - File Manager - Searching fully \"ALL\" files/folders and sub-folders I am very frustrated with the default file manager in Ubuntu.

I'm wondering if it will automatically delete the partitions and give all the space to Ubuntu or is there further tweeking required?\nAre there any traps for the novice in undertaking this exercise? Is there a better way?\n\nA: As per http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1615667 the space used by the NTFS partition where Win7 was, and any recovery partition as well, will not be automatically added to your Ubuntu partition, so you will need to do that after removal by booting from live media with Gparted, as suggested by Alvar above.\n", "Q: Where can I access man pages for \"aptitude\" if it is not on my system?

They are part of the aptitude-common package. My Ubuntu 18.04 installation was configured to never install man pages, so after fixing that, I simply ran apt install --reinstall aptitude-common to get them.\n\nA: aptitude is a text-based interface to the Debian GNU/Linux package system.\nIt's a package management command line application that runs on all Debian systems including Ubuntu and the man page is just the link you have provided above and i think there is no more options included for specific Ubuntu.\n", "Q: How do I login to a deployed Virtual Machine in Azure?

[...]\n\n", "Q: Compiz crashing takes Ubuntu with it I am somewhat new to Ubuntu. I want to like it, I really do. I came from the world of KDE where Kwin is the windows manager. Kwin is awesome for many reasons, one being that if a window or application misbehaves, you can simply kill it with a simple hot key. My experiences with Compiz is, if a window misbhaves, that's it; it's over. You can't simply switch workspaces and kill the window, you can't strike a hotkey to kill the window, you can't even ctrl-alt F2 to get into the terminal. \nThis cannot be the way it was designed; I must be doing something wrong. How on earth can Ubuntu or Compiz allow sone simple misbehaving window to bring down the entire operating system?\n\nA: Did you try using the System Monitor to force kill the window's process? That usually gets rid of pesky windows that hang and don't want to close without crashing Ubuntu's compiz(well at least in my experience of windows not behaving properly).\nAlso from experience I have Cairo Dock installed and if you have it's terminal(the one that pops up that's connected to the dock when opened) on the dock I found you can still use it's terminal even at times when you cant use your desktop environment's terminal which has saved me at times when I thought my Ubuntu's installation was ruined. Anyways if you have Cairo Dock installed, you should from it's terminal run the line(without quotes): \n\"compiz --replace\"\nThis restarts compiz when undesirable things occur like when it hangs or crashes.\n", "Q: IP redirection for apache in virtual hosts Say I have two virtual hosts setup in apache.\n\n1.domain.com points to var/www/1\n2.domain.com points to var/www/2\n\nWhat if someone enters the IP address of my server? \nIs there a way to make the default location it takes them to?

I need full access to this hard drive as my username.\nThe drive is an internal SATA and formatted in NTFS and I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 64 bit\nI will be grateful of any help\n\nA: First, the NTFS file system handles permissions significantly different (more the Windows way) than any Linux file system like ext4. You should edit the line in /etc/fstab which mounts your NTFS partition. \nYou can open an editor to edit it with this command (use a terminal): gksu gedit /etc/fstab\n\n\n*\n\n*Firstly: which partition is it?\nIn this case, this needs to be a device node identifier. e.g. /dev/sda1, a partition UUID, or a partition label. \nRunning sudo blkid -c /dev/null in a terminal will tell you all the relevant information about your partitions. Hopefully you can determine from this list which one is the correct partition.\nIf you use a UUID or Label, you need to declare it as such. e.g. \"LABEL=Windows\", \"UUID=ABCDEFGHIJKLKLMNOP\".\n\n*Next, where should it be mounted?\nThis part is simple: where do you want the partition to be accessible from? Ubuntu mounts partitions in /media by default, so if you want the partition to be mounted there, say so. e.g. /media/Windows. You will need to manually create this folder since fstab will complain if it's not there, so make sure that the folder isn't being used already, and run\nsudo mkdir /media/Windows\n\n*Next, which filesystem should it be mounted as?\nSince we're mounting an ntfs partition, specify ntfs-3g for this column. Don't use \"ntfs\" unless you don't want to be able to write to the partition after it's mounted (by write, I mean making new files, editing files, moving files and folders, etc.; the \"ntfs\" driver is outdated and only lets you read files.)\n\n*Next, what options should it be mounted with?\nThis is the most important column in this case, this is where you specify permissions. How you do this isn't immediately obvious, but there's a way, and it's actually rather simple.\nThis is a comma separated list, so don't use spaces or tabs, or else you'll find that the mount line doesn't work as expected. To specify the permissions, you merely need to declare three things: UID, GID, and umask.\nuid=#### specifies which userid should own the files on the partition. e.g. uid=1000 means that the user with the id \"1000\" should own the files. You can find out your UID by opening a terminal and running echo $UID.\ngid=#### specified which groupid should own the files on the partition. e.g. gid=1000 means that the group with the id \"1000\" should own the files. Finding out groupids is slightly more difficult than finding out your userid because you can belong to several groups at the same time. \nNow, Ubuntu normally creates a group for every user, with the same ID as the UID, so you can probably use your UID as the GID. However, you can get a list of groups by running, in a terminal, cat /etc/group. This will display a list with up to four colon-separated fields per line. The lines will contain the following items: name, an encrypted password, the GID, and a list of users in the group. Find the group you want to use, and add it's GID to the options.\numask=UGO is the most important of the three options; it specifies what the permissions will be for the user, the group, and everyone else. The numbers used here need to be between 0 and 7, anything else will probably cause an error. These numbers are actually an inverse of normal permissions, so while \"7\" means \"read, write, and execute\" in normal permission setting, in fstab \"7\" means \"no permissions\". Setting umask=000 will give EVERYONE read, write, and execute permissions. For clarification, the U is the permissions for the user, G is for group, and O is for others. See www.cyberciti biz/tips/understanding-linux-unix-umask-value-usage.html for more details about umask.\nYou may also add other things to this list. Generally speaking, it's best to start with the \"defaults\" option. \"auto\" makes the partition mount automatically when you boot up. Read more here: www.tuxfiles org/linuxhelp/fstab.html\n\n*The final two columns should be \"0\" and \"0\".\nThese two columns are only used for Linux filesystems, so setting them to 0 stops any complications from arising.\nA finished fstab line may look like:\nUUID=ABCDEFGHIJKLKLMNOP /media/Windows ntfs-3g defaults,auto,uid=1000,gid=1000,umask=002 0 0\nThe next time you boot up, or the next time you run sudo mount -a, the partition should be mounted where you want it, with the permissions you want it to have.\nSource\n\nA: To Get Mount ntfs partitions in Ubuntu we need to install ntfs-3g package to get it use\nsudo apt-get install ntfs-3g\n\nTo Mount the partition to some directory\nmkdir /mnt/ntfs_data\nmount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sda2 /mnt/ntfs_data\n\nMake it to mount while every boot by adding fstab entry\n/dev/sda2   /mnt/ntfs_data  ntfs-3g defaults    0   0\n\nEven you can mount using UUID by getting the UUID using\nblkid \n\nOutput will be similar to this\n/dev/sda2: UUID=\"Uo4y9S-Y9ip-hsSp-z8oI-nNnP-hwRn-x0bEQG\"\n\nAnd and replace the UUID instead of /dev/sda2 in fstab entry\nreplace sda2 and ntfs_data according to your environment\nIf you need help regarding ntfs-3g just run the command\nman ntfs-3g\n\n\nYou can find this at top of ntfs-3g man page :\nEXAMPLES\nMount /dev/sda1 to /mnt/windows:\nntfs-3g /dev/sda1 /mnt/windows\n\nor\nmount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sda1 /mnt/windows\n\nMount the ntfs data partition /dev/sda3 to /mnt/data with standard Linux permissions applied :\nntfs-3g -o permissions /dev/sda3 /mnt/data\n\nor\nmount -t ntfs-3g -o permissions /dev/sda3 /mnt/data\n\nRead-only mount /dev/sda5 to /home/user/mnt and make user with uid 1000 to be the owner of all files:\nntfs-3g /dev/sda5 /home/user/mnt -o ro,uid=1000\n\n/etc/fstab entry for the above (the sixth and last field has to be zero to avoid a file system check at boot time) :\n/dev/sda5 /home/user/mnt ntfs-3g ro,uid=1000 0 0\n\nUnmount /mnt/windows:\nsudo umount /mnt/windows\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13 doesn't have an option for screen resolution 1600x900 for NVidia graphics I am looking for a way to configure my display to the correct resolution of 1600x900.

It's a long story but I can't keep these details to myself because I have no clue what's going on, it's pretty weird.\nI have two hard drives. One had windows, and the other one had nothing, it was brand new. So I installed Ubuntu 13.10 just fine, except for the USB keyboard which would stop working as soon as I pressed ctrl+C trying to copy text (worked just fine on Windows, so it was weird). After a lot of suffering I tried plugging it into different USB ports and somehow it started working fine. Everything was perfect now, but I tried installing the NVIDIA drivers and everything went to hell. I knew it could happen, but I tried anyway because the worst case scenario would be that I would have to reinstall, which wasn't a problem since it was a fresh install anyway and I had time.\nThe problem is I can't install it correctly anymore! The graphics in the installer are messed up, the screen doesn't refresh until I move the mouse, which leaves horrible trails all over the screen. And it only refreshes the places where I hovered over. I decided I could withstand the installation if at least the fresh install worked fine after that. But no, the fresh install sucks too. The keyboard is slow, the mouse leaves trails, etc.\nI thought maybe something was being stored in the boot sector of that disc or whatever.

Occam's Razor says the latter is more likely. Such diverse symptoms can be caused by hardware problems such as bad RAM, a bad CPU, or even a malfunctioning power supply. Thus, I recommend you run some hardware diagnostics, such as memtest86, on your computer.

After the point where the installation checks if I have enough space, an internet connection, a check box for updating the system during installation, etc, the comes the point where I need to choose a partition where to install. \nThe thing is that at this point, as there is no partition available (it's completely blank .. absolutely nothing in it), I try to add anything to the screen in order to add a new partition, but I'm unable to do it. \nThis has never happened to me before, so I have no idea as to how to proceed in order to install Ubuntu on this machine. \nPS: Tried searching google but couldn't find a problem that matched my description. \n\nA: If the Ubuntu installer is detecting your disk but claiming it has no partitions, then that likely means one of two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your partition table is damaged (or at least, the libparted library doesn't like your partition table). This is essentially a bug in libparted.\n\n*The disk is configured as part of a motherboard-based software RAID (aka \"fake RAID\") array, but you're not using it as such in Linux.\n\n\nThe first issue seems to be more common, based on reports I've seen. A very common cause is that a GPT disk is repartitioned in Windows to use MBR instead. The result is a legal MBR disk, but with leftover remnants of GPT data. The problem is that libparted detects the leftover GPT data and becomes confused. This situation is becoming common because people re-install Windows 8 or install Windows 7 over Windows 8, often switching from EFI-mode booting to BIOS-mode booting in the process. Because Windows ties partition table type to boot mode (BIOS/MBR, EFI/GPT), this results in a change in the partition table, too. If this is the cause of your problem, it can be fixed by running FixParts on the disk. The same program can fix some other common problems, too, but I can't guarantee that it will fix your problem.

Both monitors working and the right one extending the left. Both had 2560x1440px.\nThe only problem I had was the fact, that it seemed that Chromium didn't use hardware acceleration and it told me to install different drivers for my cards to make it work.\nAlso the mouse flickered sometimes (only while hovering special applications - i.e: chromium, sublime text)\nSo I thought: Maybe I can get more performance out of this if installed the Nvidia drivers.

(Expert option: you can set 2 password for that file: with first password you see a normal part of file and with password 2 you see the hidden part) \nYou can mount this file in Linux, Mac or in Windows (mount to drive e:) and you will show that 1GB file as like a pendrive/flash drive, and you can unmount when you want.\nIf you create that 1GB file (or any size, or a full disk or pendrive) you can add any extension for that file to hide. (Never place that file at your home directory as secret.truecrypt.file.with.pwd lol) \nIf you use any system file name in system folder maybe normal user never notice it's not a system file it's a private encrypted file.\nFor example for hide this file:\n/usr/lib/libc8.2.so\n/usr/lib/libxml24.so.9.1.3\n\nOther temp filenames:\nWin386.swp\nnsz17BE.tmp\nmmc00C1B00C.xml\njusched.log\nIMT211.xml\ni4j8470767517827925011.tmp\nFTP7F0.tmp\ne4j3B.tmp\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Choose one scheme and change numbers for a file name.\n\n*and also set rights...and after done remove the history console commands\n\n*With that solution normal user never will find your secret file.\n\n*In Pendrive make a TEMP folder and use a temp file name, like file examples.\nand make few backups with different name...\nYou can install truecrypt if you want, for example:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:michael-astrapi/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install truecrypt\n\nMore information in Truecrypt homepage\n\nA: If by protect, you mean prevent any modifications to these files at all, consider using the chattr utility.

While this may be moderately\n  inconvenient for users, it ensures that passwords are changed\n  occasionally, which is a good security practice. Most Linux\n  distributions do not enable password aging by default, but it's very\n  easy to enable.\n\nBy editing /etc/login.defs, you can specify a few parameters to set the default settings for password aging:\nPASS_MAX_DAYS   99999\nPASS_MIN_DAYS   0\nPASS_WARN_AGE   7\n\nchange These values as you want. change 9999 to 7 to enforce all users to change their password every 7 days.\nsource\n\nA: The PASS_MAX_DAYS parameter in /etc/login.defs allows you to force passwords to expire once they reach a defined age.

All the dlls go to one directory. All the configuration files to another. And the binaries are also put in a bunch. Yes, Windows works the same way more or less, but with the nature of system/server software installed on Linux, being that most of the software installed is only about 95% mature at any given time, messing up your system twice a month is very probable..\nOf course, we can backup the system before and after each installation, but that takes a million years. System backups (as oppose to just data/files backup) requires you to turn off you computer and use some form of bootable live CD and a backup media. And, if the drive is more than 15% full, it might take a long time to do the backup, even with modern hardware.\nSo, how can this be done?\n\nA: Creating a cronjob for doing backup by using the lvcreate -s -L <size> -n <snapshot_name> <volume_name>\nHere volume name is the name of the volume whose snapshot you want to take.\nFor further details you can also go through this tutorial\n\nA: The alternative - LVM Snapshots - You can read about LVM snapshots here:\nhttp://www.tutonics.com/2012/12/lvm-guide-part-2-snapshots.html\nIn short - snapshots are a way of freezing the used sectors on the HardDisk, telling the system to write any change/delete/add on a reserved part of the HardDisk, called a snapshot volume, thus postpone the decision of keeping/discarding the changes on the drive to some future time, as far as the snapshot volume space provides. And so, once you decide to rollback the changes (or keep them), you can do it with one line.\nIt may seem complex at first, but I can assure you that after the first time effort, all that is needed to use the snapshot mechanism is just 2 line scripts (downloads provided!)\nWarranty - No warranty what so ever is given for the instructions below. Use at your own risk!\nHow?\nIf you don't have a pre-configured volume group, you will probably need to install a fresh clean Ubuntu. Then, you will have to put some effort into configuring the system correctly for the first time, but from this point on, snapshot will become effortless. And by effortless I mean one liner commands, using pre-configured scripts.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to the ubuntu live cd (no installation yet.. just the live cd)\n\n*Open Accessories -> Terminal\n\n*We will be clearing the hard drive!

Format it as 'ext2' and mount it as '/boot'\nBelow - choose: /dev/sda1 partition as boot\nInstall!\nUsing the snapshot\nThe following steps will show how to use the snapshot at any given time:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mounting the snapshot:\nCreate the snapshot volume\n# lvcreate --size 15G --snapshot --name lvsnap /dev/mapper/vgsnap-lvroot\n\nCreate the mount directory\n# mkdir /mnt/vgsnap-lvsnap\n\nMount the snapshot as read-only mount\n# mount -o ro /dev/vgsnap/lvsnap  /mnt/vgsnap-lvsnap\n\nSnapshot is On! \nAt this point you may start messing up your system, installing beta drivers, and even (No! That's just inappropriate).\nFrom now on you may at any time (as far as the snapshot size provides..) return to previous state, or, if satisfied with the new look - keep it.\n\n*Automatic snapshot volume free disk space monitoring:\nUsing a tweaked version of the script provided here:\nhttp://blog.rimuhosting.com/2012/02/20/cron-script-for-checking-disk-space/\nI created monitor_snapshot script.\nHow to use/install it?  - Pretty much as with the link above:\n# cd /etc/cron.hourly\n# copy /home/<user>/Downloads/monitor_snapshot\n# chmod +x monitor_snapshot\n\nBefore running it for the first time you better edit the values in it, such as your email address (where the notifications are to be sent, etc..) \nIf properly configured, the cron daemon will run the script every X hours/days - as you decide - and notify you once the snapshot is about to be full.\nTo test the script run:\n# sh /etc/cron.hourly/monitor_snapshot\n\nIt will print the percentage (number) of free space in the snapshot.\nImportant! Once you're done with your tests/installations - rollback or keep changes - and Umount the snapshot!\n\n*Rolling back changes:\n(See rollback_snapshot script, with the following instructions in it, link at the end of document)\n# lvconvert --merge /dev/vgsnap/lvsnap\n\nThis will also umount the snapshot, but will discard any of your changes.  Also - You will see a warning that suggest that the revert will only occur next activation, so:\n# reboot\n\nNote: If you skip merging in, your changes shall be committed once you Umount the snapshot.\n\n*Committing changes - umounting the snapshot:\n(See commit_snapshot script, with the following instructions in it - link at the end of document)\n# umount /mnt/vgsnap-lvsnap\n  Will unmount (commit0 the snapshot\n\n# lvremove /dev/mapper/vgsnap-lvsnap\n# rm -rf /mnt/vgsnap-lvsnap/\n\n# rm /etc/cron.hourly/monitor_snapshot\n  Remove the cron daemon script (that is unused)\n\n\n*Re-mounting the snapshot:\n(See remount script, with the following instructions in it - link at the end of document)\nPretty much as before:\n# lvcreate --size 15G --snapshot --name lvsnap /dev/mapper/vgsnap-lvroot\n# mkdir /mnt/vgsnap-lvsnap\n# mount -o ro /dev/vgsnap/lvsnap /mnt/vgsnap-lvsnap\n\nIf you saved the monitor_snapshot at your home dir you can restore it back:\n# cp /home/<user>/monitor_snapshot /etc/cron.hourly/\n# chmod +x /etc/cron.hourly/monitor_snapshot\n\nThat's all folks! Following instructions are for quitters only ;)\n\n\n*\n\n*Discarding the snapshot volume (If no longer required)\n# rmdir /mnt/vgsnap-lvsnap\n# lvremove /dev/vgsnap/lvsnap\n\n(You might also want to resize the root partition or swap to occupy the  missing 15G reserved for swap)\n\n*Discarding the volume group - Possible only by removing the volume group's volumes, which probably means deleting the OS installation. But of course, there's no real need to remove the volume group...\nTo remove the volume group:\n# vgremove vgsnap\n\nImportant Note! - formatting / running fdisk and removing all partitions will NOT remove the volumes nor the group, as these are written on a different part of the drive... So, just use the remove instructions given above and remove the volumes and group if required.\n", "Q: who / w / logname broken in multiple terminals I have a strange problem: \nIn a GUI session, depending on the terminal being used the following two (related) problems appear:\n\n\n*\n\n*who and w doesn't list the user's active session\n\n*logname returns logname: no login name\nIt happens in the following terminals:\n\n\n*\n\n*lxterminal\n\n*xfce4-terminal\n\n*rxvt\n\n\nOn the other hand, in the following scenarios it works perfectly (who/w lists the user and logname functions):\n\n\n*\n\n*ssh-ing in\n\n*xterm / lxterm / uxterm\n\n\nA: The best answer I've found is here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/1629628/3196753\ni.e.\necho ${SUDO_USER:-${USER}}\n\nOr alternatively\nlogname 2>/dev/null || echo ${SUDO_USER:-${USER}}\n\nFWIW, this works on MacOS 10.8, 10.11 and also confirmed as far back as Ubuntu 12.04.\nThe 2> is to suppress the logname: no login name error that will log to the console starting with Ubuntu 16.04 due to an upstream gnome-terminal bug.\n:-${USER} means if $SUDO_USER is blank (for times when sudo is not actually being used), then substitute the value of $USER.\n\nA: I have found the same problem in 16.04. I had several scripts using logname, and now they don't work. I've created a workaround. While logged in as myself, I drop a file in my home directory with my login username:\necho $LOGNAME > ~/.logname;\n\nWhen I want to access my logname, I retreive it thus:\ng_logname=\"$(<~/.logname)\";\n\nThis works whether I am running a script as myself or as root, because sudo root maintains the definition of \"~\" as my home directory. I can create a .logname file for each user on the system. This method works, whereas using $USER and $LOGNAME do not when calling from a root level. True, someone could hack it and change the value in the file, but I'm not worried about that. You can always change the permissions on the file to 444 and the owner:group to root:root, which will stop anyone without root privileges.\n", "Q: How to remove package manually?

While I was typing a message there was a popup, which I didn't get to see.\nI didn't get to see it because it stole focus and thus took my key presses as commands. (i.e. when I hit space to write a new word it thought I can hitting \"OK\" or \"Cancel\" or whatever the default was). This happened so fast that I didn't get to see what it was.

(e.g. stop it from stealing focus)\nAny ideas as to what did might have been?\n\nA: You can use CCSM to adjust the focus stealing prevention. Open it and go to General Options > Focus & Raise Behaviour. Here you can set the Focus Prevention Level, normal should work fine in most cases, but you can set it to a higher level if you still have problems. Just be careful to not set it unnecessarily high as it could prevent modal popups (which need an action immediately) from gaining focus, which would cause undesirable side effects.\n\nA: Open your terminal and paste these following commands.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:jconti/recent-notifications\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install recent-notifications\nsudo apt-get install indicator-notifications\n\nafter installation , you can see your old notifications from recent.\n\nCredit goes to Ubuntuforums and webupd8. \n", "Q: Wirless ap-hotspot ubuntu 13.10 I have Ubuntu 13.10 and I created a wireless hot spot using the network setting option and also tried to setup using AP-hotspot. \nThe problem is the one setup using network setting is not showing in my phone (Android 4.0) and when I start AP-hotspot it says already a process is running and if I stop and try to start again it says another process already running again.\n\nA: \nwhen I start AP-hot spot it says already a process is running and if I stop and try to start again it says another process already running again\n\nYour command prompt should look like this,\n$ sudo ap-hotspot start\nAnother process is already running\n$ sudo ap-hotspot stop\nWireless Hotspot is not active\n\nIn this case whatever command you try, won't work.

Tried RM, SRM, delete, etc  without success.  Fired up using LiveCD tried everything and no success.  \nI then downloaded Bleachbit to liveCD.

I can confirm that apt is getting the Release file even when it says it's unable to.\nMy organization has a need for a local secure-apt repository, where we will host our own copy of updates for Ubuntu 12.04.  The need comes from a number of reasons (bandwidth, pre-testing of updates before releasing to production, all the usual.)  In the process of building the repo, I've run into an unusual problem.\nFirst, the basics.  The apt repo is being hosted on a small desktop running CentOS 6.5, not a server; currently it's proof of concept.  I'm using nginx to act as a web server, and an Ubuntu 12.04 VM to act as a client test bed for the proof of concept.  I made a backup copy of /etc/apt/sources.list, then deleted it and started from scratch.  It currently contains only:\ncat /etc/apt/sources.list\n\n# Test repository for local private apt\n\ndeb http://mbwinnc641090/ precise main\n\nThe directory structure has been copied from the existing Ubuntu apt repos for Precise.  The Release and Release.gpg files sit in /dists/precise (where / is relative to the root of the web server, not the file server); Packages, Packages.gz and Packages.bz2 sit in /dists/precise/main/binary-amd64.  There is a Packages in /dists/precise/main/binary-i386; it does not appear in Release.gpg, it is zero bytes in size, and was only added to solve a secondary problem that cropped up while I was looking at the real issue (will explain in more detail below.)  I generated a 4096 RSA/4096 RSA key with OpenGPG, and have signed the release file with:\ngpg -abs -o Release.gpg Release\n\nI have exported the public key with\ngpg --armor --output ./APT-key-2.key --export <myid>\n\ncopied it onto a USB stick and then brought that over to the VM; the key imported successfully onto the Ubuntu VM with\napt-key add ./APT-key-2.key\n\nThe Release file contents are as follows:\nOrigin: Ubuntu\nLabel: Ubuntu\nSuite: precise\nVersion: 12.04\nCodename: precise\nDate: Wed, 25 Apr 2012 22:49:23 UTC\nArchitectures: amd64\nComponents: main restricted universe multiverse\nDescription: Ubuntu Precise 12.04\nMD5Sum:\n3a72e2cbeccb018e855e59851c97fafb        1806 main/binary-amd64/Packages\n4e8e2385e95080b1c6e61ea032f286af        1023 main/binary-amd64/Packages.bz2\n871b13afb486f3faf4174e3c839ad6da         938 main/binary-amd64/Packages.gz\nSHA1:\nd58e402014879a2d7f9a8890144daf8d05216bc0        1806 main/binary-amd64/Packages\n5782287bf8d853da47425dbf15aaf924a4505e1d        1023 main/binary-amd64/Packages.bz2\nc469ea854a1f15638fcff418e4ca527bb3a12a52         938 main/binary-amd64/Packages.gz\nSHA256:\nec3f7712fecf94de2337a0c554219f370ed2ddb4486e1e1cc147f90fb4b5d765        1806 main/binary-amd64/Packages\n5776bcdc534063094459f283619c85861758bae3718273ce6e34b6e052f9a495        1023 main/binary-amd64/Packages.bz2\n5c0eedc77ff872f2676c79116e55182e759cb8c41285a49bae075a7ea08f9942         938 main/binary-amd64/Packages.gz\n\nAs you can see, it contains MD5Sum, SHA1 and SHA256 records for the main/binary-amd64/Packages, Packages.bz2 and Packages.gz files.  I have double- and triple-checked that these are correct.\nThe Package files themselves contain only one package record (again, proof of concept - start small and work up) for Firefox.  It's lengthy and I do not believe it's relevant to the problem, so I will omit it for now, but if someone wants to see it I will edit it in afterwards.\nNow, the actual problem - when apt-get is run, it complains about failing to fetch the Release file:\nsudo apt-get -s --allow-unauthenticated update\n[sudo] passwd for administrator:\n\nHit http://mbwinnc641090 precise Release.gpg\nHit http://mbwinnc641090 precise Release\nW: Failed to fetch http://mbwinnc641090/dists/precise/Release  Unable to find expected entry 'main/binary-amd64/Packages' in Release file (Wrong sources.list entry or malformed file)\n\nHowever, I can confirm with 100% certainty that it is not failing to pull the Release file down.  First, the nginx log files confirm that the apt request is getting both files; access.log reports either HTTP 304 and 0 byte transfers (i.e. no change since the last copy of the file acquired), or if I touch both files on the repo, HTTP 200 and the transfer sizes of both files is correct:\nNo touch:\n10.113.226.222 - - [21/Feb/2014:08:12:12 -0600] \"GET /dists/precise/Release.gpg HTTP/1.1\" 304 0 \"-\" \"Debian APT-HTTP/1.3 (0.8.16~exp12ubuntu10.14)\" \"-\"\n10.113.226.222 - - [21/Feb/2014:08:12:12 -0600] \"GET /dists/precise/Release HTTP/1.1\" 304 0 \"-\" \"Debian APT-HTTP/1.3 (0.8.16~exp12ubuntu10.14)\" \"-\"\n\nTouch:\n10.113.226.222 - - [21/Feb/2014:10:05:04 -0600] \"GET /dists/precise/Release.gpg HTTP/1.1\" 200 836 \"-\" \"Debian APT-HTTP/1.3 (0.8.16~exp12ubuntu10.14)\" \"-\"\n10.113.226.222 - - [21/Feb/2014:10:05:04 -0600] \"GET /dists/precise/Release HTTP/1.1\" 200 966 \"-\" \"Debian APT-HTTP/1.3 (0.8.16~exp12ubuntu10.14)\" \"-\"\n\nBoth files are being transferred as plaintext; I added the \"default_type  text/plain\" directive to the conf file for the nginx server (note - whole server, not just this one virtual host.)\nI can also confirm that apt-get is receiving the files - /var/lib/apt/lists has both mbwinnc641090_dists_precise_Release and mbwinnc641090_dists_precise_Release.gpg; the file contents match exactly what is on the server; the file size is exactly what is on the server (and what is transferred according to nginx); and the file timestamp changes to match the server time when I touch both files on the server.  wget also succeeds in accessing the files, and I can browse directly to them in Chrome/Firefox/etc.  So they're there and available.\nWhere it gets really weird is that when I remove Release.gpg from the directory (either move it to another directory or rename it), suddenly the apt-get update command works.  There's nothing for it to update (and initially it did complain about not being able to find Packages in /dists/precise/main/binary-i386, which went away when I created the empty Packages file there), but the error message about not being able to remove Release goes away entirely and it exits with zero error code.  So it looks like something about apt does not like the signature I have.  However, I can confirm that gpgv is able to verify the signature using the apt keyring:\nsudo gpgv --keyring /etc/apt/trusted.gpg mbwinnc641090_dists_precise_Release.gpg mbwinnc641090_dists_precise+Release\ngpgv: Signature made Fri 21 Feb 2014 10:04:56 AM CST using RSA key ID AF57B06B\ngpgv: Good Signature from \"<my info>\"\n\nRunning apt get with \"-o Debug::Acquire::gpgv=true\" further confirms that Apt is passing the key validation stage - apt-get returns:\nHit http://mbwinnc641090 precise Release.gpg\nHit http://mbwinnc641090 precise Release\n33% [Release gpgv 966 B]inside VerifyGetSigners\ngpgv path: /usr/bin/gpgv\nKeyring file: /etc/apt/trusted.gpg\nKeyring path: /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/\nPreparing to exec: /usr/bin/gpgv /usr/bin/gpgv --ignore-time-conflict --status-fd 3 --keyring /etc/apt/trusted.gpg /var/lib/apt/lists/partial/mbwinnc641090_dists_precise_Release.gpg /var/lib/apt/lists/mbwinnc641090_dists_precise_Release\nRead: [GNUPG:] SIG_ID sLGwzAAcePo9LZtAdgNf44grYaQ 2014-02-21 1392998696\nRead: [GNUPG:] GOODSIG 84332B63AF57B06B <myinfo>\nGot GOODSIG, key ID:GOODSIG 84332B63AF57B06B\nRead: [GNUPG:] VALIDSIG 09DBAF28ACFD21DC5FBF797784332B63AF57B06B 2014-02-21 1392998696 0 4 0 1 2 00 09DBAF28ACFD21DC5FBF797784332B63AF57B06B\ngpgv exited\ngpgv succeeded\nW: Failed to fetch http://mbwinnc641090/dists/precise/Release  Unable to find expected entry 'main/binary-amd64/Packages' in Release file (Wrong sources.list entry or malformed file)\n\nE: Some index files failed to download.

However I'd prefer to build it from the sources.

I now want to run screen, so I typed screen and hit enter, after which I'm presented with this line:\nCannot open your terminal '/dev/pts/1' - please check.\n\nAnd here I'm lost. Why doesn't it open screen, and what should I do with the very helpful tip \"please check\"?\nAll tips are welcome!\n\nA: Turns out the problem was that I ssh'ed into the machine as root, then changed to the user kramer65 with su kramer65 and then tried to run screen, where screen can only be run by the user that logs in using ssh. So after I added kramer65 to the sudoers file with usermod -aG sudo kramer65 I could ssh into the machine as kramer65 and run screen with a big smile.\n\nA: There is a way around this without resorting to adding the user (kramer65 in this example) to the sudoers file.

(This is on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS with all the latest updates applied.)\nOne audio application I use a lot is Audacity, both as an audio player and as a recorder, usually with the cheapest headsets I can find.\nI also use YouTube a lot (i.e. Flash in Firefox).\nThe two work together pretty well: e.g. I can play audio from both simultaneously.\nRecently, I started to use another audio application: Tartini.\nThanks to Jeremy Salwen's and Jevon Longdell's efforts, it compiled without any problems, and after getting OpenGL to work, it runs, too. So I expected it to mix in with the other two:\n\nbut it doesn't. Initially, it wouldn't play any audio at all.\nSomehow, I found out that in Ubuntu's \"sound settings\"\n\nI had to select 'Digital Output (S/PDIF)' before audio played back with Tartini would be audible - but this mutes YouTube and Audacity. I don't want to need to switch between 'Digital' and non-'Digital' outputs depending on the application I happen to be using. I don't care whether 'outputs' (whatever they are) are 'Digital' (whatever that means); I just want sound produced by an application to play whenever I ask it to, whether or not some other application happens to be playing or recording sound at that time.\nSomehow, I found out that there is an application called 'paprefs' that has an option to enable 'simultaneous output on all local sound cards', whatever that means, so I installed it and enabled that option:\n\nThis gave me a new option in the Sound Settings:\n\nand after I selected that, Audacity and Tartini would both play audio, not simultaneously, but whichever was started first.  At least, that was the case for a short while; then the previous behavior returned.\nAfter rebooting, the new behavior was restored: I can now play sound from Audacity and/or YouTube, simultaneously if I wish; or from Tartini; but never from Audacity and Tartini, or YouTube and Tartini, at the same time.

It needs to be ext2 or ext3 but I have absolutely no option to format my flash drive to any of these filesystems.\nI'm completely new to Linux so I have no idea how to fix this. Anybody?\nThanks!\n\nA: So you boot from an Ubuntu live CD/DVD. When you see Ubuntu welcome screen select Try Ubuntu. Wait for the desktop to load.\nNow press Ctrl+Alt+T to open Terminal and type here: sudo gparted. If it complains about gparted is not installed do a\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install gparted\n\nNote that you will need an internet connection for the install procedure.\nOpen GParted with sudo gparted, look in the upper right corner and select your flashdrive.\nNow rightclick on the only partition (?) of your flashdrive and select Unmount if available. Rightclick again and select Format to -> ext2 or ext3.\nNow go to Edit -> Apply all operations. That should be all.\nHere is a screenshot to help you:\n\n\n", "Q: First Boot Not Happening [ 7.471657] Adding 4041724k swap on /dev/sda7 Priority :-1 extents: 1 across :4041724k FS I have been trying to get Ubuntu up and running in dual boot, this is the first time I have tried to install linux. Everything was going well with the install, the progress bar had reached the end of installing files and then I got a black screen with a few lines of writing on it that forced my laptop to shut down.\nOn booting I was taken to grub, where I have the option to boot in Ubuntu and windows (and some other options), when booting Ubuntu I am sent to a black screen with blinking cursor. I can type there, but nothing else happens.

How do I change it so that I only have UBUNTU, I don't care if I loose all with my WIN XP\n\nA: You can remove Windows without reinstalling Ubuntu using OS-Uninstaller.\n\nA: I will reinstall the ubuntu software and select the custon option, It will show you the breakdown of the HD, Format the drive, Then select the full space of the HD for the installation. \nOne issue though, I would not be too quick to remove Winxp as like all operating system they can become corrupted & a backup operating system would be handy if you dont have another machine! \n", "Q: Xubutu, right click so slow I'm on Xubuntu 13.10 64 bit. I'm running Xfce4 version 4.10, Thunar version 1.6.3\nIf you right click on the desktop, the menu might never show up, if you right click in Thunar, you'll have to wait like 10s or more for it to show up.\nIf you right click in Thunar -> create a new document, you'll have to wait like 30s for the menu to show up. (sometimes it never does). \nThere's only one similar question, here, I followed the instructions in the accepted answer, it doesn't fix it,  the right click menu is as slow as ever. The second answer, well it's not my first time. I need a third answer that wasn't given there.\n\nA: This is a known issue in Xfce 4.10. It has (probably) been fixed in the upcoming 4.12, namely in the xfdesktop 4.11.2 development release. \nYou can test the fix by adding the Xfce 4.12 packages PPA and updating your packages (do note that this is unreleased, development software).

I tried all the tricks that the helpful Ubuntu users had to offer, but none of it helped. Safe graphics mode, no splash, nodemodeset, only login to terminal to remove drivers, but none of it helped.\nWhat gave me the error was that i clicked the \"Install 3rd party proprietary drivers\" when it was recommended by Ubuntu. I reinstalled Ubuntu and just went with the open source drivers instead, and have no problems now.\nIf you have \"nothing to lose\" or just did a fresh install anyway, you could try to do a reinstall as well and go with open source drivers.\n", "Q: Nginx: unknown directive \"uwsgi_param\" in /etc/nginx/uwsgi_params:1 Using this deployment tutorial, I'm trying to get an Ubuntu 12.04 server up and running with Flask, uWSGI and Nginx.

When I try to (re)start nginx it simply says ...fail!, and when I run a test (using sudo nginx -t), it says:\nnginx: [emerg] unknown directive \"uwsgi_param\" in /etc/nginx/uwsgi_params:1\nnginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test failed\n\nI didn't change anything in that file, so its contents are the default ones:\nuwsgi_param     QUERY_STRING            $query_string;\nuwsgi_param     REQUEST_METHOD          $request_method;\nuwsgi_param     CONTENT_TYPE            $content_type;\nuwsgi_param     CONTENT_LENGTH          $content_length;\n\nuwsgi_param     REQUEST_URI             $request_uri;\nuwsgi_param     PATH_INFO               $document_uri;\nuwsgi_param     DOCUMENT_ROOT           $document_root;\nuwsgi_param     SERVER_PROTOCOL         $server_protocol;\nuwsgi_param     UWSGI_SCHEME            $scheme;\n\nuwsgi_param     REMOTE_ADDR             $remote_addr;\nuwsgi_param     REMOTE_PORT             $remote_port;\nuwsgi_param     SERVER_PORT             $server_port;\nuwsgi_param     SERVER_NAME             $server_name;\n\nMy server definition in /etc/nginx/sites-available/www looks like this:\nserver {\n    listen 8080;\n    server_name myapp;\n\n    root /var/www/myapp;\n    try_files $uri @uwsgi;\n    location @uwsgi {\n        include uwsgi_params;\n        uwsgi_pass unix:/tmp/myapp.sock;\n    }\n}\n\nDoes anybody know what I'm doing wrong here? Why doesn't this run? All tips are welcome!\n\nA: The fix for me was as simple as:\nsudo apt-get install nginx-full\n\n\nA: The version of nginx installed doesn't support UWSGI. It's fairly easy to find one that does:\n% apt-cache search nginx uwsgi\nnginx-core - nginx web/proxy server (core version)\nnginx-extras - nginx web/proxy server (extended version)\nnginx-full - nginx web/proxy server (standard version)\n\nThat means all of those packages contain uwsgi in their package descriptions, which is usually in the positive sense. You can verify that simply by looking at the description, e.g. apt-cache show packagename.\n", "Q: I crashed my Ubuntu pc When I power on my Ubuntu PC, it doesn't load.Then I go to Ubuntu recovery mode and try the below command:\n\n$ sudo service lightdm restart\n\n--bash: /usr/lib/command-not-found: /usr/bin/python3: bad interpreter No such file or directory\n\nWhenever I apply sudo command,it always shows the above error.\nThe below answer recommends me to boot from live disk and then chroot into the installed Ubuntu partition.I tried that, but still the same error message exists,\nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo mount /dev/sda3 /mnt\nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo chroot /mnt\n bash: groups: command not found\nroot@ubuntu:/# sudo apt-get install --reinstall coreutils\n bash: /usr/lib/command-not-found: /usr/bin/python3: bad interpreter: No such file or directory\nroot@ubuntu:/#\n\n\nA: This looks like it's having issue mounting or finding many executables. When a system can't find several things, such as in your instance, it also always tells me that the system is either:\n\n\n*\n\n*Having a hardware failure, HDD, typically\n\n*Having a system-wide configuration issue and cannot mount the / partition\n\n*Having a $HOME/.bashrc or /etc/bashrc type of configuration issue\n\n\nI would try and make sure it isn't #2 to start. Follow the steps outlined in the RecoverMode or LiveCdRecovery topic in the Ubuntu wiki to start.\n\nA: I am suspecting you may be missing the file /usr/bin/env. Accoding to this answer it is provided by coreutils. You could try repairing your system by using the LiveCD and making a chroot to your pc hard drive partition. See the instructions in LiveCDRecovery, section Update Failure. After the chroot, you should be able to re-install coreutils.\n", "Q: Using hot corners, spread all windows function, all preview images are blank... any ideas? Using Ubuntu 13.10 and unity tweak tool. I have the hot corners feature setup to spread all windows when I go to the bottom left corner.

I did not have this problem when i first installed it worked perfect for me at start. But then i started tweaking on some small things to fit my personal use better. When i did this i got the same issue/problems like you do. \nWhat seems to do the blank previews for me was when i checked the box \"Click to access desktop\". I really loved this option but it seems to make the preview disappear for me. \n\n\n*\n\n*Open unity tweak tool \n\n*Click window spread\n\n*Uncheck \"Click to access desktop\" option.

Is it possible to use Juju to deploy services based on user requests. \nKindly answer my following doubts.\n\n\n*\n\n*Users use a web interface to request for a service. Is it possible to deploy the services automatically using JUJU?\n\n*Based on the user requests we can deploy services using JUJU. After the deployment we want to allocate the Virtual machine and service to the requested user. How to create a user name and password to the deployed Virtual machine/ Service ? \n\n*Which is the best programming language which supports JUJU API ?\n\n*We are planning to create a hybrid service deployment using JUJU. Using web interface users can select which public cloud they want to use to deploy the services. How to deploy a particular cloud service to specific public cloud service provider ??\nKindly help to solve my queries.\n\nA: Juju GUI (source: lp:juju-gui; live demo) allows you to deploy services in a Juju environment through a web browser. It's a free software with AGPL v3 license, so you can probably fork it and modify it as needed, if it doesn't quite fit your needs. To use it, you'll need to deploy it in your environment and expose it. See the deployment instructions.\nIf that is not suitable for your purpose, you can use the Juju websocket and HTTPS-based API directly (that's what the GUI does from JavaScript). The documentation about that is not quite polished and it's most autogenerated from the Go sources. There is some concise developer documentation in juju-core source.\nYet another choice for automated/scripted (not web-based) deployments with Juju is the Python-based Juju Deployer.\nThe concept of role-based permissions and multiple user accounts is not yet supported by Juju, but it's planed. So, Juju can't directly help with user account management for your customers, except perhaps if you write custom charms that provide that.\nJuju API works over a websocket with JSON-encoded requests/responses. It's designed to be language-independent. There are presently clients for it in Go, JavaScript and Python, but alas not as standalone libraries, but as parts of other products (juju-core, GUI and Deployer, respectively).\nLastly, each Juju environment is specific to a single cloud provider. So in order to choose where to deploy a service, you'll need to generate the configuration for the chosen public cloud in environments.yaml, then bootstrap it (per customer), and finally deploy the service(s). An interesting idea is the manual provisioning, which allow you to add any existing machine to an environment, as long as you can connect to it using SSH and the machine can connect back to the state server node (and the other machines as well, if you'll be adding relations to it).\nSo you see, even though Juju can help you with the deployments and orchestration, a fair amount of \"glue\" has to be custom-built around it to enable such type of hosted solution you're aiming to provide to end-users.\n", "Q: How to add two IPv6 dns-nameservers into /etc/network/interfaces? With IPv4, I can add two DNS Name Servers without any problem, like this:\n\"dns-nameservers 8.8.4.4 8.8.8.8\"\n\nThen on my resolv.conf I got:\n   nameserver 8.8.4.4\n   nameserver 8.8.8.8\n\nBUT, it does not work for IPv6, only the first IPv6 DNS Server appear at my resolv.conf, look:\n\"dns-nameservers 2001:4860:4860::8844 2001:4860:4860::8888\"\n\nBut then, my resolv.conf remain only with the first one:\n   nameserver 2001:4860:4860::8844\n\nApparently, Ubuntu (resolvconf / ifupdown) is ignoring the second DNS Name Server, so, how to fix it?!\nHere is my /etc/network/interfaces file:\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\niface lo inet6 loopback\n\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet6 static\n        address 2800:210:0:4::2\n        netmask 64\n        gateway 2800:210:0:4::1\n        dns-nameservers 2001:4860:4860::8844 2001:4860:4860::8888\n\n\nA: I was initially thinking this was a bug, but I'm going to assume @Sander's answer is correct here.  I'm not sure if resolvconf uses resolv.h or something else for the maximum nameserver value, though.\nGenerally, instead of using resolv.conf, Here are a couple things to try:\nYou could try editing dhclient.conf as suggested in the Google dev docs :\nprepend domain-name-servers 2001:4860:4860::8888, 2001:4860:4860::8844;\nFor this method on Ubuntu, I believe the current path is /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf.\nThe same document gives instructions for using NetworkManager.  If you use that, you can right-click on your network icon, find your connection then select \"Edit\", then go to the IPv6 tab.  You can set \"additional DNS servers\" there.\n\nA: There can be only three nameservers in resolv.conf. If you remove one of the IPv4 nameservers the second IPv6 nameserver will be added.\n\nA: Add it manual to the /etc/resolv.conf\n nameserver 2001:4860:4860::8844\n\n nameserver 2001:4860:4860::8888\n\n\nA: @ThiagoCMC said \"No, I can't add it manually, resolv.conf ... \":   Yes, you are right - but you can force the system NOT to change this file: edit it and (as root) chattr +i resolv.conf  then it can never be edited again by scripts. Unfortunately from that moment on you have to maintain it yourself, always ... \n\nA: Although MAXNS is set, resolvconf can add as many NS's as you like by using /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d\nIn there you will find 'head' which contains the warning message found at the top of /etc/resolv.conf and a (probably empty) file called 'base'.\nYou can edit these files freehand to add additional lines in resolv.conf (such as 'nameserver xx.xx.xx.xx'). \nWhether or not adding >MAXNS lines will actually work is a different matter but that's how to force custom content into the resolv.conf itself.\n", "Q: I have 3 different distros in use and I want to refer 3 Transmissions to one config file?

I have an old acer laptop (Aspire 5315-2077.) I'm using it to mainly browse the internet with while I'm using my more powerful system for gaming. I connect to the internet via wifi on the ubuntu system. I also have a wired LAN that does not connect to the internet. If plug the Ethernet cable into the LAN port on the laptop the wifi suddenly drops connection to the internet. I unplug it and I get internet. I suspect that ubuntu assumes that the wired network is faster for internet and assigns a higher priority to it. In my case, however, I need to keep priority on wifi for internet. Windows 7 allows me to assign a value to what's called an \"Interface metric\" no each of my connections. How can I do the same with ubuntu 13.04's connections? I have been looking for a solution for awhile and have not found it. I have found it is possible but, the person just asked if it was possible in their question and all the answers were basically yes without further explanation as to how. I am quite a novice with linux distros so, I don't have much more info about my configuration. Thank you for your help.\n\nA: You could try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Network Connections by searching for from Dash or open from\nits indicator on the top panel.\n\n*Select the wired tab;\n\n*Select your network and press Edit\n\n*Uncheck the option: Connect automatically.\n\n*Now on your wireless tab select your network and be sure to keep on connect automatically.\n\n\nA: Ok, my initial problem is solved. I figured it out myself. So you don't have to go through the stressful process yourselves, here's how to do it:\n1: Click on the networks icon in the upper right corner from the desktop.\n2: Click on \"Edit connections\".\n3: Click Wired connection and choose Edit...\n4: Click the IPv4 Settings tab.\n5: Click the drop down menu next to \"Method:\"\n6: Choose \"Link-Local Only\" in this menu\n7: Click \"Save\" in the bottom right corner of the Editing Wired connection dialog box.\nYou may use your LAN and your wifi simultaneously.\n\nA: For Ubuntu 15.10, the procedure is more precise where your wired network does not advertise a default route.\nAgain, follow Network Connections into your Wired Connection and IPv4 Settings. Click Routes... and tick Use this connection only for resources on its network.\nNow can you can proceed with more than one interface but retain Internet connectivity via your choice of interface.\n\nA: I have solved my issue via following steps:\n\n*\n\n*Open Network Settings.\n\n*Open Wired Tab.\n\n*Click Advanced Settings.\n\n*Click General Tab.\n\n*Untick Automatically connect to this network when it is available.\n\n", "Q: Can I create another partition on a single partition system?

I am able to turn it on, but to turn it off requires the command 'stop' in the console to shut the server down.\nIs there any way to tell it to enter the stop command when the power button is pressed, then after a time(a minute or so) turn the computer off?\nThanks in advance :)\n\nA: Java is auto-killed by using a reboot function.\nThere is no need to run stop. All that command does is tell Java to gracefully (not forced) exit. When the server detects the graceful stop request, it kicks all users and ends the session.\nWhen you press the power button, all processes are at first gracefully terminated, so it is the same as running the stop command.\n", "Q: Switching between active RDP's via Reminna (How-To) I often use RDP to remotely connect Windows servers & SSH to linux distro(s).\nAs the subject explains; I always wondered how to to switch between active RDP windows. I'm using the default client Remmina as it serves my purpose very well. But the only problem is that, I'm lost when I need to switch active windows in between. To make this more clear;\n\nWhen I RDP to windows pc1, it connects perfectly. And then when I connect to windows pc2 whilst having pc1, yes it indeed connects as the same. But, soon after when I try to check for an option to switch between those two, I'm lost. Doesn't matter how many RDP sessions I make as it connects to the requested server perfectly. Despite having many connected windows, I always need to close each and every connected sessions to go back to the other active session.\n\nP.S.: Though it looks simple, I don't want to keep on connecting to each machines multiple times by closing it. My requirement is to switch active windows without having to close and connect again. I'm sure there'll be a way to do this.\n\nA: Just a quick update. After searching through few source I figured it out for my self. It looks bit idiotic for me as I didn't notice (since I was using a full screen) that there's a screen toggle option to switch in between (seen below).\n\nAlso, what I found is shortcut key which make it more easier not click on the toggle icon.\n\n\n*\n\n*Hold Right CTRL + < / > (left/right arrow keys) to switch between active screens.\n\n\nHope this helps! \n", "Q: Do I need to install any drivers for 2 finger swipe I am able to use 2 finger swipe and 2 finger tap in my laptop running Win8 but it is not working in Ubuntu 12.04. Should I install any additional drivers or is it a limitation of Ubuntu?\n\nA: In a nutshell, drivers tell an operating system a couple of things - what a piece of hardware is, its capabilities and how to interpret its behavior/use... And like Microsoft Windows, Ubuntu effectively supports all input devices, of any type with every type of functionality - as long as you have a suitable driver.\nWith that in mind, Ubuntu will be able to make full use of your touchpad and its three-finger input, but unless your driver has been written in such a way that three-finger input is supported, it simply will not work.\nSo, you're either going to need to find a suitable driver from your manufacturer, or obtain an alternative driver from the Community...\nI wouldn't hold your breath though - input with two fingers is pretty common these days, but not too many manufacturers support input with three fingers.\nIf there's no demand, there's probably not going to be a Community driver...\n", "Q: How to remove packages from the apt cache that are not currently installed? I want to organise my apt cache folder so I want to remove packages that are NOT currently installed and keep packages that are ONLY currently installed\n\nA: Use apt-get clean command.According to man page it cleans downloaded packages which are not longer needed. Also in Synaptic on the low left click Status button and then on up left you will see not installed.Select it and you will do what you want.  \n\nA: I use GtkOrphan, which does the job nicely.\n\nGtkOrphan (a Perl/Gtk2 application for debian systems) is a graphical tool which analyzes the status of your installations, looking for orphaned libraries. It implements a GUI front-end for deborphan, adding the package-removal capability. \n\n\n", "Q: Cannot Install Programs Through Terminal on Ubuntu 12.0.4 I recently made Ubuntu 12.0.4 bootable through my flashdrive.

I'm trying to burn a bootable ISO, a support software for the ServeRAID controller in my IBM x345 box. No matter what program I use to burn the ISO (cdrecord [raw96r, raw96p], ImgBurn, Nero, CdBurnerXP), the symlinks in /lib are coming out broken. For example, /lib/libncurses.so.5.2 will be right there, but /lib/libncurses.so.5, which should be a symlink to the actual library, will have size 0.

How can I get the rest of the panel to take the theme?\n\nA: Go to panel settings (right clikc panel)\nchoose appearance and solid color with opacity then use the color picker (below the color chooser)  to pick the the theme color you like\n\nA: I assume that you installed the theme using the OpenBox Configuration Manager (\"Menu → Preferences → OpenBox Configuration Manager\") and then in the lxpanel settings (Right Click on Panel → Panel Settings) you set \"Appearance: Background: System theme\".\nHowever: the theme you configure with that OpenBox Configuration Manager is just for the window borders, while \"Background: System theme\" in lxpanel's \"Panel Settings\" dialogue refers to the LXDE widget theme and LXDE icon theme [confirmation].\nTo change the LXDE widget and icon themes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install lxappearance if it does not exist yet: sudo apt-get install lxappearance.\n\n*Start lxappearance, either by executing the command or via \"Menu → Preferences → Customize Look and Feel\".\n\n*Set values for \"Widget\" and \"Icon Theme\".\n\n*Click \"Apply\". Your panel should now have the chosen themes.\nAdmittedly, the \"system theme\" working in the panel settings dialogue is misleading. The issue still exists in Lubuntu 15.10, for example when trying to make the LXDE panel dark with bright icons: just doing so in OpenBox Configuration manager has no effect even (the theme name \"Lubuntu-dark-panel\" there is also misleading, since it has no effects on the panel).\n", "Q: Booting monolithic kernel: cannot find root fs by UUID I have built a monolithic kernel with the grsecurity patch, since I don't need many modules for the system and I need to optimize space.

As some of you may know, I recently (and unsuccessfully!) tried to dual-boot Ubuntu with Microsoft Windows 8.1 on a Sony VAIO Tap 20... However it was a nightmare with problem after problem and being that only the kids use that particular computer, I went back to a Windows 8.1-only setup.\nNow with my personal computer however, I dual-boot Ubuntu and Windows 8.1 fine (spending most of my time in the former)... However it is a much older laptop that is on its last legs and eventually I will need to replace it, almost certainly with a UEFI-based computer (seeing as that is what is replacing the BIOS in all computers over the next few years).\n--\nNow that the back-story is out of the way, I have a really, really easy question (well, at least I think it is)...\n--\nIf I single-boot a future computer with Ubuntu, do all of the UEFI issues simply \"go away\"? Or will this vary from manufacturer to manufacturer (as is the case with dual-booting)?\nI've learnt quite a bit about UEFI over the last few weeks and as I understand it, a lot of the booting problems come down to Windows 8.1 modifying the boot sequence when dual-booting... Effectively undoing some or all of the changes a Ubuntu may have made.\nBut if Windows 8.1 has been removed (along with all of its partitions, including the \"recovery\" partitions), there should be no difference to single-booting a BIOS-based computer with Ubuntu, right?\n\nA: It varies from one computer to another. Some have badly broken EFIs that will only boot the Windows boot loader, for instance. (To be more precise, they'll only boot a file called EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi, or sometimes only one with the name that Microsoft gives their boot loader [\"Windows Boot Manager\" or something like that, IIRC].) Such a problem can often be worked around by renaming GRUB, rEFInd, or whatever you use, but that's an ugly solution! Others have EFIs that work the way they're supposed to work, in which case an Ubuntu-only installation -- or even a Windows/Ubuntu dual-boot -- should go fairly smoothly. The biggest caveat in such cases is that you understand enough about it to not make any dire mistakes. To that end, I strongly recommend that you read the following three pages:\n\n\n*\n\n*My page on EFI booting on Linux\n\n*Adam Williamson's page on EFI booting\n\n*The Ubuntu community wiki on the subject\nAny one of those will help immensely, and reading the other two will help fill in the gaps.\nBased on the sorts of comments and problems I've seen on-line, I'd say that, in addition to buggy EFIs, the biggest problem is that users bring BIOS assumptions to the EFI world. That's why I always squirm a bit when I see somebody refer to a new computer's \"BIOS.\" It doesn't have a BIOS; it's got an EFI, and the fact that the person is referring to it as a BIOS means they're loading up their mental model with BIOS assumptions that do not apply to EFIs.\nAs to your specific issue, following links, I see you had problems with a Sony VIAO machine. Those problems were likely caused, at least in part, by Sony-specific bugs. Therefore, I recommend you buy another brand of computer. FWIW, I recently bought a Lenovo IdeaPad U530, and its firmware isn't doing anything flaky. It dual-boots between Linux and Windows just fine, although I think I've booted Windows all of once in two months since getting Ubuntu installed. OTOH, I'm the maintainer of rEFInd (which of course I use on this system), so my knowledge of how to set this up is well above average; somebody else might have a much harder time with this exact same computer. ASUS has also been ahead of the game on EFI adoption, although I can't comment on any specific ASUS computer.\n", "Q: How can I open thunderbird in the system tray with a command How can I open thunderbird minimized with a command? nohup thunderbird & doesn't work with it, while it works with skype and amarok...\n\nA: Here is what I've done.

I downloaded the 64 bit Ubuntu 13.10 iso from the download page and \"burnt\" it to a FAT32 formatted 2GB USB drive with UNetbootin.

I removed all other USB devices, even my wireless USB mouse, but I get the dreaded \"Disk Error\" message. I have followed all the answers to similar questions on setting up the BIOS correctly, so enabling USB devices in the POST menu, enabling USB emulation etc. I have read about the difference between USB-HDD and USB-ZIP but I can't find any option relating to this in the BIOS so if this is the issue then I'd like to know how else to fix it.\nNo worries, I tried again with another USB flash drive I had spare, this time 1GB, I did everything specified above except this time there is no disk error but instead the flash drive appears to be unrecognised.

I booted from live media and then I repaired the ext4 filesystem with e2fsck -c /dev/SDx where SDx was the drive in question (sda in my case). which resulted in several short reads which I ignored and forced rewrites on and found and repaired 5 inodes with multiply-claimed blocks.\nIf the drive contains critical data you should of course utilize the correct strategy to back up the data before doing anything else. If not as in my case, read on. dmesg reported almost twice as many bad sectors as were found by SMART, so I then ran e2fsck -cc /dev/SDx where SDx was the drive in question in order to perform a non-destructive read/write test. This was a clearly time consuming process, however as my goal was just to squeeze a few more hours out of what is for all intents and purposes a \"scratch drive\" used for experimentation with no critical data on it, while I waited for the replacement drive to be delivered, I felt it might be worth the time. An hour later at 15% complete on a terabyte drive I wasn't so certain but as the replacement was 3 days away, I persevered. In the end all the bad sectors were added to the bad block inode list which prevents them from being allocated to a file or directory.\n\nA: Download gsmartcontrol (Hard disk drive and SSD health inspection tool) by typing in sudo apt install gsmartcontrol.\n\nGSmartControl is a graphical user interface for smartctl (from smartmontools package), which is a tool for querying and controlling SMART (Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology) data on modern hard disk and solid-state drives. It allows you to inspect the drive's SMART data to determine its health, as well as run various tests on it.\n\nUsing gsmartcontrol:\n\n*\n\n*run a short self-test;\n\n*if it completes with no error, then run an extended self-test.\n\nIf this one is fine, too, then there is probably no reason to panic. If however, the tests detect some bad blocks, then you'll possibly need to make a backup using ddrescue ASAP, and then attempt to understand what is wrong with your hard-drive. It may be failing, or there may be just a handful of irrelevant bad sectors.\nSee also:\n\n*\n\n*How to repair a corrupted HFS+ partition from a damaged hard-disk?\n\n*Does my hard-drive have bad sectors or not?\nUpdate: Given that only a handful of bad sectors seem to be present, you could try to tell the FS which ones it should avoid using fsck.ext3 -c. But do read man fsck.ext3 (assuming that this is your FS) before using it.\nSee also: How to view bad blocks on mounted ext3 filesystem?\n", "Q: No - error: Could not load GPU driver; Cannot access secondary GPU - error: Could not load GPU driver My notebook specs:\nCPU: Intel Core i5 3230m\nRAM: 4gb 1600mhz\nI have 2 GPUs:\n    1st: Intel HD 4000 \n    2nd: Nvidia GT 720m\n\nToday, I installed bumblebee and Nvidia 331 driver.

The reason I want to use Notepad++ is because we are using it at university and I want consistency)\nI have followed the instructions in this article, right up to the point where it says to open with other applications.  But I do not see Notepad++ listed anywhere on the list.  How do I add it to the list of applications (categories) in Kubuntu?\n\nA: Find the Notepad++ .desktop launcher file - the one you put in /usr/share/applications - it will look like this:\n[Desktop Entry]\nEncoding=UTF-8\nName=Notepad++\nComment=PlayOnLinux\nType=Application\nExec=/usr/share/playonlinux/playonlinux --run \"Notepad++\" %F\nIcon=/home/USERNAME/.PlayOnLinux//icones/full_size/Notepad++\nName[fr_FR]=Notepad++\nMimeType=application/x-cgi;application/x-httpd-php3;application/x-httpd-php4;application/x-httpd-php5;application/x-javascript;application/x-perl;application/x-php;application/x-python;application/xhtml+xml;application/xml;text/css;text/html;text/javascript;text/mathml;text/plain;text/x-c++hdr;text/x-c++src;text/x-chdr;text/x-csrc;text/x-diff;text/x-dsrc;text/x-dtd;text/x-java;text/x-javascript;text/x-pascal;text/x-perl;text/x-php;text/x-python;text/x-sql;text/xml;\nStartupWMClass=notepad++.exe\nCategories=\n\nadd/change these lines:\nCategories=Text;Editor;Plaintext;Write;GTK;Development;IDE;\nMimeType=text/plain;text/x-chdr;text/x-csrc;text/x-c++hdr;text/x-c++src;text/x-java;text/x-dsrc;text/x-pascal;text/x-perl;text/x-python;application/x-php;application/x-httpd-php3;application/x-httpd-php4;application/x-httpd-php5;application/xml;text/html;text/css;text/x-sql;text/x-diff;\n\nThen right click on the file you want, and go to 'Properties' then to the 'Open With' tab:  \nYou can then find Notepad++, and either 'Add' or 'Set is as Default'\nThen you can open it with Notepad++ as default\n\n", "Q: how to find which packages from official Ubuntu repositories need to be updated (in respect to current state)? how to determine which packages from official Ubuntu repositories need to be updated (in respect to current state) and to download these packages\nThanks.\nHey Denarsson, your script was very helpful thank you. \nThe command \napt-get update -o Dir::Etc::sourcelist='sources.list' \\\n-o Dir::Etc::sourceparts='-' -o APT::Get::List-Cleanup='0'\nupdate the package lists from official Ubuntu repositories. \nYes it is fine but what equally I need first, before updating the data, is  to see the list of packages (name of packages) from official Ubuntu repositories that need to be update and after that to confirm to update.\nFor example like this command :  apt-get upgrade --show-upgraded \nthat print out a list of all packages that are to be upgraded.\nOutput:\nThe following packages will be upgraded:\napache2 apache2-mpm-prefork apache2-utils apache2.2-bin apache2.2-common apparmor apport apport-symptoms apt apt-transport-https apt-utils apt-xapian-index aptitude avahi-daemon\n cups-client cups-common cups-driver-gutenprint cups-filters cups-ppdc curl dbus dmsetup dnsutils dosfstools dovecot-core dovecot-imapd dovecot-pop3d dpkg file fontconfig-config …….\nOr for example with  sudo /usr/lib/update-notifier/update-motd-updates-available\nOut for ex:\n35 packages can be updated.\n22 updates are security updates.\nAs output is the number of packages that can be updated but I need also to see the list of packages with the name for example.\nSo which combination of command do you think is appropriate to print first the list of packages need to be updated and after that to confirm to update that list?\nThank for your time.\n\nA: In the beginning, you'll want to update the package lists. You could simply use apt-get update, but since you only want the official sources, this would take unnecessarily long. To speed up things a bit, use the following:\napt-get update -o Dir::Etc::sourcelist='sources.list' \\\n-o Dir::Etc::sourceparts='-' -o APT::Get::List-Cleanup='0'\n\nNow that your package lists are up to date, you have to get the URLs of the individual packages. The following code is borrowed from apt-fast, you might need to adjust it to your needs.\nDLLIST=\"/tmp/packages.list\"\n# Add header to overwrite file:\necho \"# package download list: $(date)\" > \"$DLLIST\"\n# We use --print-uris to get the uris of the packages instead of downloading them\nfor urimd5 in $(apt-get -y --print-uris upgrade |\n    egrep \"^'(http(s|)|(s|)ftp)://[^']+'.+ MD5Sum:\\S+\\s*$\" |\n    sed \"s/^'\\(.\\+\\)'.*MD5Sum:\\(\\S\\+\\)\\s*$/\\1::MD5Sum:\\2/\"); do\n  uri=\"${urimd5%::MD5Sum:*}\"\n  checksum=\"${urimd5#*::MD5Sum:}\"\n  # Here we are checking if the package comes from the official sources,\n  # only then it's written to the list:\n  if [[ $uri == *ubuntu.com* ]]; then\n    echo \"$(get_mirrors \"$uri\")\" >> \"$DLLIST\"\n    echo \" checksum=md5=$checksum\" >> \"$DLLIST\"\n    # Here you can specify where the files go.\n    # Change path to the location where you want the packages to be downloaded.\n    echo \" out=/path/$(basename $uri)\" >> \"$DLLIST\"\n  fi\ndone\n\nNow you have a list of the URLs to the package files you want to download at /tmp/packages.list. To download the packages, we use aria2c, which you can install from the default repositories by running sudo apt-get install aria2. Here we go:\naria2c -i $DLLIST\n\nJust put the above together in your script. It will have to be run as root of course.\n", "Q: Asked to remove packages when trying to install with Muon? I keep trying to install packages using Muon Discover on Kubuntu 13.10, but every time I try to install a package I get a message saying that there are other things installed that have to be removed.  Normally I wouldn't mind, but some of the things it claims have to be removed are things I am using (like kdeutils and kdegames).\nWhy do I have to remove these things?  I only want to install VLC Media player!  CAN I install this on Kubuntu?\n\nA: I have installed VLC Media Player on every version of Kubuntu for ages now. That includes 10.04 through 13.10. Something is clearly wrong somewhere. VLC is not a KDE application and therefore has no KDE dependencies that would need to be removed. However there is not enough information in your post to provide an answer, such as what Kubuntu version and what KDE version for starters.\nIn Konsole (terminal) type:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\n\nIf there are errors in the results that will help you find out what is wrong and you can re-ask the question with the additional information.  \nGood luck.\n", "Q: How to use the latest version of flash on Ubuntu? We have all read about Adobe's decision to not care about linux users. I have several video websites (things like tf1.fr and m6replay.fr that require an updated version of flash. I guess this is so for security reasons and for digital rights management.\nSince the latest updated version of flash is no longer available for Ubuntu, how can I use these websites?\nI have tried chromium and Google Chrome, but that does not make a difference. Is there some tool I can use? Or some or other bypass? Is someone working on a structural solution for this?\n\nA: Do this.  Ensure that universe is included in your software resources and, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command below.\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install browser-plugin-lightspark\n\n\nAlso you can check out Ubuntu Packages, to manually install using a .deb file.\n\nA: You can install the Pepper Flash Player, which is more recent and is the same version of Flash that is used in Chrome (Chromium doesn't bundle Flash). This is available through a PPA for Precise, Quantal, Saucy, and Trusty (although Trusty will have this package in the partner repo, I believe).\nSee https://launchpad.net/~skunk/+archive/pepper-flash for installation instructions.\nShort version of the instructions:\nThe following adds the PPA and installs the Pepper Flash Player:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:skunk/pepper-flash\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install pepflashplugin-installer\n\nNow, you need to tell Chromium to use this version of the Flash Player. To do that, open up /etc/chromium-browser/default (something like sudo nano /etc/chromium-browser/default or sudo gedit /etc/chromium-browser/default), and on a new line at the end of the file, add the following line:\n /usr/lib/pepflashplugin-installer/pepflashplayer.sh\n\nSave and close the file, and run Chromium as normal. If you go to about:plugins, you should see it's using Flash 12.x.x.xx.\n\nA: The final solution that worked for me was using Google Chrome. Note that this is not the same browser as Chromium.\nIt can be downloaded from https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/\n", "Q: Apache2 restart does not work when I navigate to it's directory This works:\nsudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart\n\nIt asks for my password, I enter it and apache restarts.\nThen I try this:\ncd /etc/init.d\nsudo apache2 restart\n\nNope, it doesn't work. Apache displays usage info. Why can't I navigate to the directory and do the restart.\nAs must by now be obvious, I'm absolutely a newbie. For what it's worth I'm using Ubuntu 12.04\n\nA: If you run\nsudo apache2 restart\n\nthe program apache2 is searched in the folders that the environment variable $PATH contains, not in your current working folder. So it doesn't run /etc/init.d/apache2 but\n/usr/sbin/apache2.\nYou can use\ncd /etc/init.d\nsudo ./apache2 restart\n\nHere ./apache2 calls the program apache2 that is in the current working folder so you actually run /etc/init.d/apache2\n\nA: The correct way to  invoke (stop or restart or start) any service, is to give it's full path name as,\nsudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart\n\nOR\nsudo service apache2 restart\n\n\nA: You can put it simply by typing\nsudo service apache2 restart\nby the way, can you give the output when you run this command?\n", "Q: which files does gconf-editor edit? I want to change my gnome-terminal hotkey settings. I came across gconf-editor which enables me to customize exactly the things I need. However I need to know in which file these changes are made.\nThe gconf-path is apps/gnome-terminal/keybindings/\nI found the file ~/.gconf/apps/gnome-terminal/keybindigs. But there are only two hotkeys listet.\nWhere are the rest of these settings stored?\n\nA: According to the gconf-editor man page\n\nGConf-Editor  is  a  tool  used  for  editing  the  GConf configuration\n     database.  It might be useful when the proper configuration utility for\n     some software provides no way of changing some option.  \n\nand \n\nThis tool allows you to  directly  edit  your  configuration  database.\nThis  is  not  the recommended way of setting desktop preferences.  Use\n     this tool at your own risk.\n\nAlso look at the answers in Gconf, Dconf, Gsettings and the relationship between them for an overview on gconf, dconf, and gsettings. \nTo find which files are modified (edited) when you make your changes, you can use the find command.\nfind ~/ -mmin -5 -type f\n\nwill find all files in your home modified in the last five minutes. You can reduce the time find takes by excluding certain folders:\nfind ~/ ! -path \"*mozilla*\" ! -path \"*cache*\" -mmin -5 -type f\n\nWill exclude ~/.mozilla and ~/.cache from being searched.\nTo give an example, I used gsettings to modify whether FileChooser shows hidden files and folders:\n$ gsettings get org.gtk.Settings.FileChooser show-hidden\nfalse\n$ gsettings set org.gtk.Settings.FileChooser show-hidden true\n$ gsettings get org.gtk.Settings.FileChooser show-hidden\ntrue\n$\n\nI then ran find and saw that ~/.config/dconf/user was modified. That file is a binary:\n$ file user\nuser: data\n$ \n\nIn other words, you can't open it and see what's inside as you would open a text file or even a xml file.\nI don't have gconf-editor or dconf-editor installed but you can use the same find command to find which file has been modified when you make your modifications and then use file to figure out whether you can see what that file contains (without using a hex editor).\n", "Q: Eclipse - Starting Tomcat 7 Server at localhost has encountered a problem I got this error just after getting an Ubuntu error with eclipse and it forced to close the program.\n\nSeveral ports (8005, 8080, 8009) required by Tomcat v7.0 Server at\n  localhost are already in use.

I suspect that this should work, but make sure that all the paths are correct and that all file move operations proceed as expected.\n\nUPDATE:\nI played with the linked binaries and debian dir. I had to adjust the file names, the folder structure and the control and rules directives. \n\n\n*\n\n*binary archive\n\n*debian dir\n\n*resulting .deb\nTo reproduce the .deb, you need to unpack the binary archive, unpack the debian dir within the extracted tigcc dir, then run debuild -b -us -uc from within the debian folder. Put both archives in a temporary folder, then: \nbzip2 -d -c \"tigcc-0.95_orig.tar.bz2\" | tar -xf - \ncd tigcc/\ntar -zxf  \"../tigcc-debian.tar.gz\"\ncd debian/\ndebuild -b -us -uc\nls -l ../../*deb\n\nUnless you have some missing dependencies, I don't see why this wouldn't work.\n", "Q: How to change your Local IP? While I order a hp server for my Ubuntu server, I am currently temporarily using my laptop as a server instead. I installed Ubuntu 13.10 and other programs like Webmin, etc, etc while being connected to my router through wi-fi. Additionally, through a wi-fi connection, I have hosted numerous websites, game servers and an ftp server. \nThe issue is that when I try to connect the laptop to the same router through ethernet, the local ip changes. This means that no services, such as Webmin, work locally or publicly. When I go back to using wi-fi, the issue is solved, however, because the wi-fi connection cannot maintain the traffic to and from the server, I need to use ethernet connection to keep up with the demand. \nI have portforwarded the ports I use from my wi-fi local ip to my ethernet local ip but I have no luck so far since the problem is on the local side, not from local to public. \nMy question is, how can I configure my services to the new IP?\n# This file describes the network interfaces available on your system\n# and how to activate them.

It just downgrades Rhythmbox. I can't put the terminal log in here but its available here: http://paste.ubuntu.com/7133595/\n\nA: You can automatically install all the build dependencies with sudo apt-get build-dep rhythmbox. \napt-get build-dep <packagename> works with any package you want to build from source. Simply name the package and all the packages you need to build it will automatically be installed.\n\nA: Dependencies generally can fix by \nsudo apt-get install -f\n\n", "Q: How do I free up space to install software updates? The upgrade needs a total of 87.5 M free space on disk '/boot'. Please free at least an additional 32.8 M of disk space on '/boot'. Empty your trash and remove temporary packages of former installations using 'sudo apt-get clean'.\n\nA: Use sudo apt-get autoclean\nAlso FSlint is a utility which scans the entire FS (filesystem hence the name FSlint) for anything that can be removed including whitespaces (there might be a better one)\nthere is also remove orphaned packages tool which does you know what\n", "Q: Man in the Middle Attack warning with OpenVPN When using openvpn --config /home/xxx/vpnbook-uk1-udp25000.ovpn I always get this warning:\n\nSat Feb 22 11:16:04 2014 WARNING: No server certificate verification method has been enabled.  See http://openvpn.net/howto.html#mitm for more info.\n\nVery possibly this is related with this issue I'm having.\nWhat should I do about this Man in the Middle Attack warning?\n\nA: In this case, your client is not validating the server. To prevent man in the middle attacks, mutual verification is required, that is, you authenticate yourself to the server (you probably have either certificates or username and password), and your client automatically validates identity of the server.\nJust connecting to specific address is not enough to actually authenticate the server.\nTo fix this, refer to linked documentation from the warning message. To validate the identity of the server, you need CA certificate that was used to sign server's certificate. If the VPN server is maintained by someone else, you should ask them. After getting appropriate CA file, add ca path/to/ca.crt directive to your configuration file. \n\nMany will hate me for saying this, but often fixing that warning is not important. It really boils down to why you use VPN. If it is to provide little additional privacy when using public wifi, there's really high chance it does not matter. If everything you run over VPN is encrypted (e.g ssh and HTTPS), MitM could be nuisance and security risk, but not a dealbreaker.\nIf you do something that requires high confidentiality and integrity, you definitely should fix this, especially if that activity is unencrypted (e.g HTTP, IMAP, telnet).\n", "Q: Missing integration options for online accounts in 13.10 For some reason I do not have all the plugins that should be here in online accounts(twitter option is not there by deafault but I can install it) and the options to integrate seems to be missing(Gmail and Facebook feed, etc).\nThe only options I get from Google is photos search plugin and google drive search plugin.\nlibgoa-1.0-0 is already installed.I also tried re-installing account-plugin-google and libaccount-plugin-google but it did not help. I recently upgraded to ubuntu 13.10 from 13.04 and this problem existed on 13.04 also.\n\n\nA: You need to install libgoa-1.0-0 \nType sudo apt-get install libgoa-1.0-0 \nYou will get all other online account options.\n", "Q: Neither Draftsight nor BricsCAD can be installed on 64 bit Ubuntu 13.10 OK, After weeks of trying, reading and searching you guys are my last hope. Let me tell you my test environment;\n3 different computers;\n\n\n*\n\n*Desktop with i5 CPU, 8Gb of RAM, Geforce 630 GPU\n\n*Notebook with i5 CPU, 4Gb of RAM, Geforce 420M\n\n*Notebook with Intel pentium dual core 2Ghz, 4Gb of RAM, Ati Radeon 4700\nNotebooks have 750Gb Hard drives, PC has 1TB. \nSoftware-wise I follow the exact same pattern for all of them, which is;\nDivide hard drive into 4 partitions:\n\n\n*\n\n*350 Windows 8.1 startup partition (it creates it itself)\n\n*2000Gb for windows 8.1\n\n*8Gb of Swap area\n\n*The rest is Ext4 for \"/\" of Ubuntu 13.10 64 bit\nAll systems are installed only the Windows 8.1 64bit, Ubuntu 13.10 64 bit and all updates available (Windows 8.1 also has Norton 360) and nothing else\nSo no modifications to any systems, neither Ubuntu nor Windows.\nHowever, I can easily click and install both BricsCAD V14 and Draftsight V1R5 and use them without any problems in Windows but when it comes to installing them on Ubuntu 13.10 there is no luck. I have downloaded many 32bit dependencies, tried modifying the .deb files, checking \"start them as a program\" box.. None helped. \nWhere I have achieved so far is; they both have their icons on dash. BricsCAD gives me a \"activate or try\" window and there is no way of passing that screen. Tried \"activate trial\" in different scenerios and downloading a licence but no luck. Draftsight, on the other hand starts but with only its own drawing. There is no way of opening a new project or another dwg file.. It can save its own dwg project but can not start it after, so no use basicly.. \nAll the computers are exactly in the same situation, nothing I have done was able to give me a ready-to-use BricsCad or DraftSight experience. \n\nA: There is some tips from this helpful website with helpful people:\nhttp://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2013/11/easily-install-draftsight-64-bit-ubuntu/\n\n\n*\n\n*install Gdebi from Ubuntu Software Center\n\n*sudo apt-get install libcanberra-gtk-module:i386 libcanberra-gtk0:i386 libglu1-mesa:i386\n\n*start Gdebi and install downloaded DraftSight package.\n\n\nIt works for me to install Draftsight in Ubuntu 13.10 64 bit environment, for Intel based notebook (i3). I still have problem installing in AMD based system though (A8).\nGood luck.\n\nA: Try to start that CAD software as root user (run as admin in Windows) and see what happens. Maybe there is a problem with user permissions. Maybe you need to add current user account to some group or elevate some (read/write/execute) privileges.\nIf that doesn't work, try that CAD in a liveCD or liveUSB Ubuntu. If it works in live mode, there must must be something wrong with your hard-disk Ubuntu and you should reinstall it (correctly).\n", "Q: Can I run the Unity launcher in GNOME 3? I would like to use GNOME 3 with the Unity launcher and dash. Is there any way to do this?\n\nA: You can't really mix both, but there's a GNOME Shell extension that replicates the Unity launcher and Dash: https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/330/bolt/\nYou might also want to try this: https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/307/dash-to-dock/\n\nA: You can use gnome extention bolt  with docky in left hand side running in panel mode just like  unity side bar. \n", "Q: Error installing packages or updating due to dpkg: error processing linux-image-extra-3.11.0-15-generic A few days back I tried to install 0ad, a game, through the terminal.

I then went through the installation process by clicking install Ubuntu on the menu that popped up after booting from my disk. I then selected the option that said install alongside windows vista.\nThis is where it gets weird. It gave me the partition creator/slider option to decide how much data I needed for windows and Ubuntu. It displayed only like a total of 10 gigabytes, giving windows vista around 6 gigs, and Ubuntu 12.04 around 4 gigs. My computer has a 500 gigabyte hard drive so I have no idea why it gave me such small numbers.\nAfter clicking next I decided that I should restart with the \"create your own partitions\" option so I restarted the computer and booted straight back into the disk I had Ubuntu on. I made a 500mb Linux swap partition, and a 25GB primary ex4/journaling partition mounted at /.

Whats wrong with it? I have reduced this to almost 0 security.  I've tried security = user.  I can't for the life of me see on my Windows machine these shared drives.  I've also had the netbios name equal my workgroup name.  If someone could tell me if there is something wrong here, that would be nice.\n[global]\nworkgroup = SOLARSYSTEM\nnetbios = SUN\nserver string = Solarsystem Samba Server\nsecurity = share\nforce user = dwarf\n\n[movies] \ncomment = entire shared drive \npath = /mnt/media/movies \nread only = no\nguest ok = yes\nwritable = yes\n\n\nA: There are a couple of things you need to know about the samba configuration file. Well, i'm lying. There is a lot you need to know (I had to spend a couple of days reading through the manual). But to sum everything up it depends on where you are sharing the folder from.\nIf the folder is inside your home folder, you can simply right click the folder, select sharing and follow the options provided. Easy solution.\nIf the folder is outside your home folder, for example, in /media/username/movies, the fastest way of sharing the folder is to put in the [global] section in the smb.conf file force user = USERNAME where username is your user or the owner of the shared folder. This has several security implications but is nonetheless, the fastest way of sharing if you are on a LAN and trust the rest of the group.\nIf you already did the 2 mentioned above for each case, you then need to check if you are actually on the same LAN network (Check IP class), same subnet and same workgroup. For the latter, you can change the workgroup in the smb.conf under the workgroup = variable.\nIf you already have done all the steps mentioned above then we proceed to see if the permissions are correct: \n\n\n*\n\n*Does the share folder actually have the username as owner?\n\n*Does the share folder have read/write/execute permissions?\n\n*Can you access the shared folder from another Ubuntu PC or another version of Windows?\n\n\nDepending on this answers you can most likely know where the problem is coming from. Most of the time, it is, in my case, a Windows 8 problem. Windows 8 has several options that you need to change in the \"Network & Sharing\" menu in order to see the LAN correctly (This applies not only to seeing Ubuntu shared resources but also other Windows versions like XP and 7).\nThere are tools to simplify the sharing of folders outside the home folder like the system-config-samba package, but they help to a degree. You can also check man smb.conf to see a lot of information regarding this file, specially the part about security which I would recommend reading this https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/man/Samba-HOWTO-Collection/ServerType.html#id2559439 which is better for the eye than the man pages. Specially the part about security = user.\nHere is an example of a working samba share /media/cyrex/movies working for another Windows 7, Windows 8 and 2 Ubuntu PCs in the same IP range and Workgroup:\n[global]\n    workgroup = WORKGROUP\n    server string = %h server (Samba, Ubuntu)\n    dns proxy = no\n    force user = cyrex\n    log file = /var/log/samba/log.%m\n    max log size = 1000\n    syslog = 0\n    panic action = /usr/share/samba/panic-action %d\n    encrypt passwords = true\n    obey pam restrictions = yes\n    unix password sync = yes\n    passwd program = /usr/bin/passwd %u\n    passwd chat = *Enter\\snew\\s*\\spassword:* %n\\n *Retype\\snew\\s*\\spassword:* %n\\n *password\\supdated\\ssuccessfully* .\n    pam password change = yes\n    map to guest = bad user\n    usershare allow guests = yes\n\n[printers]\n    comment = All Printers\n    browseable = no\n    path = /var/spool/samba\n    printable = yes\n    create mask = 0700\n\n[print$]\n    comment = Printer Drivers\n    path = /var/lib/samba/printers\n\n[movies]\n    path = /media/cyrex/titan/movies\n    browseable = yes\n    guest ok = yes\n\nThe only lines I added where the force user = cyrex in the [global] section and the section for the [movies] which was made by the system-config-samba app but you can also do it by hand.\nAfter that just sudo service smbd restart and wait a couple of seconds/minutes for the switch/router/network devices to update.\n", "Q: Unable to connect Ubuntu 12.04 to a projector using the vga port Whenever I try to connect my Lenovo G570 with Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit to a Projector, it gets detected, but the display on both, the projector and on my laptop keep blinking continuously making it unusable. Even the focus of the screen shift from one workspace, that is, i am able to view two halves of workspaces.\nLaptop Specifications:\n2nd Gen Core i3, 4GB RAM, AMD Radeon Graphics\nI have ATI/AMD proprietary FGLRX graphics driver (**experimental** beta) installed, but the status displays: \"This driver is activated but not currently in use.\"\nHere is a screenshot:\n\nShould I remove it and try finding some alternative driver?\nIs there any software to correct it?\nOr is it a completely different problem??\nI face the issue with the Unity environment. I have GNOME environment also installed but i haven't tried connecting using it. I'll try that and update on the question.\n\nA: Here is how I was able to (not permanently, but still) solve the problem.\nNeither the VGA nor the HDMI cables work when connecting an already booted machine to the projector.\nWhen connecting the projector via VGA, before boot, it still fails to produce a proper working screen through the projector. Here is the link, where I got the idea to connect before boot.\nHowever, connecting via HDMI cable to the projector, before booting the system, not only solves the problem of getting a working screen, but also solves another problem, that of resolution. I am able to work on full resolution (1366*768) instead of having to scale down to 1280*768 (or 4:3 basically).\nThe issue with the VGA cable connectivity still persists.\n", "Q: How can I uninstall an application that Software Center will not? Running Ubuntu 12. 04. Installed both \"VirtualBox\" and \"X86 virtualization solution - base binaries\". I downloaded a newer version of Virtual Box, specifically \"virtualbox-4.3_4.3.6-91406~Ubuntu~precise_i386.deb\", from the downloads page.\nWhen I try  to install this by right clicking on the file, and selecting \"Open with Ubuntu Software Center\", the Software Center opens with the error:\nConflicts with the installed package virtualbox-guest-additions-iso\n\nHaving previously installed GDebi, I can also right click that same file and select \"Open with GDebi package installer\", and that process results in the exact same error message.\nSince the package virtualbox-guest-additions-iso is a part of \"X86 virtualization solution - base binaries\", I've used the Software Center to uninstall the entire package, which also uninstalls \"VirtualBox\". After that process, any subsequent attempt to install virtualbox-4.3_4.3.6-91406~Ubuntu~precise_i386.deb results in the same error message. And if I search for just virtualbox-guest-additions-iso in the Software Center, it finds it and offers the option to \"Re-install\" it, but not to remove it.\nWhy? And how should I proceed?\nI'm sure I've done things in my Ubuntu installation that have deviated from the default install. But I've REALLY tried to keep that to a minimum.\n\nA: There are a couple of ways but first you need to know why there is a conflict. The package that comes with Software Center is maintained by Ubuntu. The one that you downloaded from Virtualbox (The same way I do it) is maintained by, well, VirtualBox (Oracle). Since they have similar packages but different maintained sources, the conflicts of war arise!!\nThe easiest way to resolve this is to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove all virtualbox packages from the system. To do this I normally use synaptic or aptitude but you can use apt-get also, like this:\nsudo apt-get purge virtualbox*\n\n\n*Install the package from virtualbox.org, which is the virtualbox deb package. In this case the virtualbox-4.3_4.3.6-91406~Ubuntu~precise_i386.deb.\n\n\nIt should work with no problem. If by chance you get an error, install aptitude which is better for looking for several apt problems and then type sudo aptitude search virtualbox. If you find ANY packages that have the i letter in front of them like so:\n\nIn this case the virtualbox-4.3 has the i, then purge the package like sudo aptitude purge virtualbox-4.3. This is all to make sure that no conflicts emerge when trying to install the official ones.\nAlso, just for checking, make sure to download the correct package for your specific arch. If you have Ubuntu 32 Bit, you need to download the i386 package of Virtualbox. If you have the 64 bit, you need to use the AMD64 one.\n", "Q: How do I calibrate colors without extra hardware, like dccw.exe on Windows?

I'm afraid I don't have a neat solution that fixes the problem at its root but I can tell you what I did to circumvent the computer from heating up so much that it shuts down automatically.\nObviously, you can use an extra fan, that's what I do sometimes, but it's a bit sad at the same time. I came from Windows and still have them set up as dual boot. What works for me is to start Windows and fo to the Settings for \"Power and Energy\" or what it's called. I tuned it down from \"high performance\" to \"medium\". For some reason that I don't understand, it seems as if the system remembers this for all OSs. When I then start with Ubuntu, it's a bit slower of course but it's much cooler as well and doesn't shut down so easily. I reckon Ubuntu doesn't get the power management right and simply runs hyper-power all the time when Windows left the setting that way.\nHope it helps!\n", "Q: drivers questin I use a HDD with ubuntu 12.04 on it for school, and when i do school related work I plug it on my PC and work on it, but I've found some problems and i think its due to the graphics drivers, I installed the nvidia ones for my PC, but the school PC has integrated graphic chipset, so i would need different drivers.

Normally, dkms automatically recompiles any modules for newer kernels, so you don't have to do it, but (like me) it's not happening. Make sure dkms is installed (sudo apt-get install dkms).\n", "Q: Resize Partitions on A Remote Server I have two partitions, one is about 1.8TB (home) and the other is 20GB (root). I want this to be the other way round, 1.8TB (root) and 20GB (home). I've been reading for some time, but am struggling to find a solution.\nI am told I cannot use:\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nas I am using GUID Partition Table.\nRunning parted, I get the following for 'print devices':\n/dev/sda (2000GB)\n/dev/sdb (2000GB)\n/dev/md2 (21.0GB)\n/dev/md3 (1979GB)\n\nI know little of filesystems, but I believe the 1st two are seperate 2Tb hard drives, and the md2 and md3 are my root and home partitions.\nIs there any way I can shrink /dev/md3 to 21GB and grow /dev/md2 to 1979GB via SSH?\n\nA: As a general rule, a desktop system's /home partition should be much larger than the root (/) partition. Your 20GB for root (/) is likely to be more than adequate for all the programs and other system files you're likely to need. User files should be stored in /home, so it could well need to be much bigger, particularly if you store multimedia files (photos, music, videos, etc.).\nThat said, if you really do have need for this resizing, there are lots of questions and answers here about it, like this one. The fact that you're using GPT isn't really very relevant, since the tool you'll use for this task (GParted) works on both MBR and GPT.\n", "Q: How do I add a standard user into sudoers' file using `echo`?

Where to find a easy \"iptables for dummies\" tutorial?\nI know NOTHING about it and basically I need to allow only http, ssh and ftp connections...\nthank you all\n\nA: This article in the Community Wiki gives a basic rundown of iptables. You can also pull up the man page for it in Terminal with man iptables. Generally, you do not need to use iptables for a standard networking configuration, as each service will open the respective ports required for itself. If you have installed Apache, OpenSSH Server and an FTP server like ProFTP, their ports (80, 22 and 21 respectively) will be open.\nAt the bottom of the article I linked there are instructions for using graphical tools such as GUFW or Firestarter, which may be useful if you don't have a lot of experience working in the command line.\n\nA: Generally MANuals are the best tutorials for the packages under Linux. However I remember for IPTABLES I also used YouTube videos. I think videos give a better understanding than texts for learning a new concept. Just search IPTABLES in the YouTube and you will see lots of videos. As an example this one which I followed myself.\n\nA: If you are a beginner you shouldn't use iptables directly, as it probably will give you more problems than it solves. Unless you are familiar with a handful of RFC:s, you should use a frontend instead. \nI would really recommend you to use ufw if you don't route traffic between different LAN. It's quite easy to use and there are some useful instructions to look up.  But if you do need routing, I have found shorewall useful as ufw doesn't support any routing or NAT (yet, it's comming). \nThe good thing with ufw is that it also supports IPv6 besides IPv4, it uses both iptables and ip6tables. \nIn short,  use a frontend and not iptables unless you really know what you do and you know the differences between different ICMP messages. \n", "Q: Xubuntu 13.10 new app windows open with buttons at top of frame concealed In Xubuntu 13.10, many apps, such as Bluefish, Calibre and Firefox, when launched put their window off-kilter, high and to the right, so the top of the window's frame is concealed.

It does not however source any files in the user's home directory like their .cshrc or .bashrc or any other file. If you need cron to source (read) any file that your script will need you should do it from the script cron is calling. Setting paths, sourcing files, setting environment variables, etc.\n\n*If the users account has a crontab but no usable shell in /etc/passwd then the cronjob will not run. You will have to give the account a shell for the crontab to run.\n\n*If your cronjobs are not running check if the cron deamon is running. Then remember to check /etc/cron.allow and /etc/cron.deny files. If they exist then the user you want to be able to run jobs must be in /etc/cron.allow. You also might want to check if the /etc/security/access.conf file exists. You might need to add your user in there.\n\n*Crontab is not parsed for environmental substitutions. You can not use things like $PATH, $HOME, or ~/sbin. You can set things like MAILTO= or PATH= and other environment variables the /bin/sh shell uses.\n\n\nSo, I'd start by editing the cronjob itself and changing the ~ to /home/popcorn9499.\nThen do the same for the script.\nAlso in the script add #! /bin/bash as the first line.\nIf everything in the script is just the function backup() { take that line out and the final } and make it a plain bash script. You can then loose the backup argument and teh cronjob becomes: */30 * * * * /home/popcorn9499/Scripts/minecraft.sh\n(you really need to make a backup every 30 minutes?)\nNext, make sure you have rwx permission for the scriptfile: chmod u+rwx ~/Scripts/minecraft.sh\nFinally, consider renaming your directory ~/Scripts to ~/bin as that is already in your $PATH.\nThat should fix things.\n", "Q: How to install programs like \"wine\" or \"dolphin\" I am very new to ubuntu.

It comes with 256 GB of SSD.\nMy intention is to install Ubuntu GNOME and I'm not sure of how my partitions should be arranged. I've always used root and home in different partitions, but I have no experience with SSD disks and I have no clue.\nMy guess is: 20GB for root (at the beginig), 8GB for swap (at the end) and the rest for /home. But, I repeat, I have no idea even if it's a good idea to do this on a SSD. Also, it would be helpful to know whether the have to be primary or logical partitions.\nAny recommendation for my case?\n\nA: You can readjust the partitions later on by booting from a Live distro which has Gparted, which makes this a non-permanent decision. \nI am writing this on a Lenovo R60 with a 256GB SSD, and I partitioned things a little differently. I used zram instead of a traditional swap partition, and in the last six months, I've never needed true swap. Rarely do I ever exceed 50% of my 3GB used with 64-bit Xubuntu 13.10, even when transcoding videos while web surfing with Chromium. \nSince SSDs wear out with repeated writes, moving to virtual swap in RAM not only speeds things up but it solves the SSD early fail issue.\nI also left 20% of the space unallocated, as suggested for overprovisioning by Anand Shimpi among others.\n", "Q: Where to find the full text of \"typing\" options in gnome-tweak-tool While trying to fiddle with my multi-language keyboard configuration broken by this bug, I stumbled again on this screen in gnome-tweak-tool, \"typing\" section: \n\nAs you can see, option text is severely truncated and there is no tooltip emerging to explain the full function (the same problem is repeated on most of the other drop-down menus). I say \"again\" because I filed this bug some time ago.\nThe question: is there somewhere a place (configuration file, gsetting, dbus comment, source file, whatever) where I can find the full text of the options here? \n\nA: On my 13.10 box I found them in /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/base.{xml,lst} and /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/evdev.{xml,lst}. The XMLs are identical, as are the LSTs (at least in my case), so I think any one of them would have the full text you seek.\nAnother thing you can do is modify gnome-tweak-tool so you can see the entire text. Here's how I \"fixed\" mine:\nusr/share/pyshared/gtweak/tweaks/tweak_typing.py, line 56 - makes the comboboxes in the Typing section display more characters:\n#renderer.props.max_width_chars = 40\nrenderer.props.max_width_chars = 80\n\n/usr/share/pyshared/gtweak/tweakview.py, line 49 - resizes the tool window so there is space for the comboboxes:\n#self._main_window.set_size_request(740, 636)\nself._main_window.set_size_request(1160, 680)\n\nThese values work OK for me, but there are even longer text options that still do not fit. A better fix would be to add tooltips or horizontal scrolling, but I don't want to pick up up on GTK and its Python bindings right now.

I created a little application using Bash and Zenity that I wish to install on my system as a native application as well as a package that I can distribute.

Where do these files go to make a \"native\" application, and by what process would I need to go to create a package that can be compiled to install this application on another system?\n\nA: About the first part:\nTo start with, I would make the script executable and remove .sh extension from both the script and the .desktop file. If you want to use it system wide, then copy the whole directory, except the .desktop file, to /opt. The .desktop file would then be:\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nType=Application\nName=GTeaKup\nComment=The perfect GTK tea timer!\nExec=/bin/bash gteakup\nIcon=gteacup.png\nPath=/opt/GTeaKup/\nTerminal=false\nStartupNotify=false\n\n...and copy that to /usr/share/applications\nAbout the second half of your question: take a look here, especially this one is nice to start with if you never created Debian packages before.

I have upgraded my windows 8 to windows 8.1 recently. My question is can i install ubunutu in my laptop.\nPlease replay and help me to find a soluton.\n\nA: Yes, you can still install Ubuntu 12.04 LTS/ Ubuntu 13.10 on to your Windows 8.1 laptop.As long as your BIOS is set to the proper settings.\nIf secure boot is disabled, use a utility like UNetbootin or Win32diskimager to burn the Ubuntu .ISO to a USB drive.\nIf secure boot is still enabled, open up your BIOS settings during boot and look for things like Quick Boot, Launch COM, Secure Boot, anything close to that. And disable this. It will enable you to boot from Non-EFI devices. (e.g. USB drives, Legacy Operating Systems, etc.)\n\nA: First burn an USB key the usual way and insert it to your computer.\nYou then have to ask Windows to first go to UEFI, this is not easy, follow a guide like this one.\nThen disable Fast Boot, Secure Boot, Launch COM (ask us if you hesitate on other option) but you must keep Launch CSM enabled !\nThen save your changes and exit.\nWhen it starts, you must press a key (try to press it as fast as you can, as many times as you can, it is a game you're playing), most of the time, this key is ESC.\nYou will then be prompted on which device you want to boot (sometimes including the UEFI setup), choose what looks like your USB key.\nThen proceed the normal installation except that when you resize with GParted, you must be aware that the Partitioning system is most probably GPT, not MBR so you can have as many partition as you'd like, see here for more info.\nAt the end of the installation, go back to the UEFI and check that the priority is on GRUB and not Windows (I know normally it displays different disk and there are only one disk but this is UEFI, things have changed). Don't forget to reenable Secureboot (only disable it if you want to boot on the USB key).\nNow several things may not work like, Grub not showing, Ubuntu not booting or Windows not booting. It is often the case but Don't Panic, if your Ubuntu is booting, boot on it or boot on the live USB and install and run boot-repair. It should fix your problem :)\n", "Q: xoj (Xournal) files handled as gzip despite presence of correct MIME type So I had to uninstall the ppa version of Xournal and build from source (with a modification).

This state of affairs persists despite all of the following:  \n1) Copied these files that come with the source package:\n - xournal.xml into /usr/share/mime/packages/\n - xournal.desktop into /usr/share/applications/\n - x-xoj.desktop into /usr/share/mimelnk/application/  \n2) added the line\napplication/x-xoj=xournal.desktop;\n   to ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list  \n3) added the MIME type application/x-xoj in the File Associations System Setting\n   (with appropriate content):\n\n   (Note also that application/x-gzip specifies only the .gz extension:\n.)  \n4) copied xournal.xml to /usr/share/mime/application\n   as suggested here \n5) sudo update-mime-database /usr/share/mime \n6) restarted the computer  \nedited to add:\n7) [right-click an .xoj file] --> Open With --> Other... --> [select 'Xournal'], tick 'Remember application association for this type of file' also has no effect.\nend of edit \nThis is on Kubuntu 12.04.\nSo, what am I missing?\nEdited to add\nI have discovered that the file --mime-type [filename] and mimetype [filename] commands produce different results, as in this question:  \narchelon@ingelrayok:~/Documents/xournal$ file --mime-type 2014-02-22-Note-02-09.xoj  \n2014-02-22-Note-02-09.xoj: application/x-gzip  \narchelon@ingelrayok:~/Documents/xournal$ mimetype 2014-02-22-Note-02-09.xoj  \n2014-02-22-Note-02-09.xoj: application/x-xoj  \n\nHowever, there is no entry for application/x-gzip in /etc/mime.types (from which the file command supposedly gets its information); and, indeed, there shouldn't be, according to the comment at the beginning of that file, which reads in part:  \n\nNote: Compression schemes like \"gzip\", \"bzip\", and \"compress\" are not\n   actually \"mime-types\".  They are \"encodings\" and hence must not have\n   entries in this file to map their extensions.  The \"mime-type\" of an\n   encoded file refers to the type of data that has been encoded, not the\n   type of encoding.\n\nThat comment also says that  \n\nUsers can add their own types if they wish by creating a \".mime.types\"\n   file in their home directory.  Definitions included there will take\n   precedence over those listed here.  \n\nThere is at present no such file.  There are some files in my home directory (which I didn't create) that are apparently related to the output of the mimetype command; these include\n~/.local/share/mime/application/x-xoj.xml,\n~/.local/share/mime/packages/application-x-xoj.xml, and\n~/.local/share/mime/types which contains only the text application/x-xoj.\nIn fact the directory ~/.local/share/mime/ and everything in it have the same timestamp (22:19 last night), and were thus presumably generated by the same process.  \nAfter looking at the manpages for mimetype and file, I decided to check the environment variables $XDG_DATA_HOME and $XDG_DATA_DIRS, which apparently are used by the former but not the latter.  But I didn't know how to report the value of an environment variable, so I tried cat $XDG_DATA_HOME, which set the value (to nothing) instead of reporting it.  Edited to add:  Or so I thought at first; actually it was already unset, as we shall see. The correct command is echo $XDG_DATA_HOME, as I learned from reading about environment variables here.  So then I discovered that $XDG_DATA_DIRS was set to /usr/share/default:/usr/local/share/:/usr/share/; the first of these doesn't exist.  I don't think that matters, but anyway I ran the commands  \nXDG_DATA_HOME=$HOME/.local/share  \n\nand\nXDG_DATA_DIRS=/usr/local/share/:/usr/share/  \n\nto accord with the standard.  I doubt that any of this will make any difference, but I'm going to try another restart now (although I think those environment variables will be automatically reset anyway). Next edit: Yes, they were; in fact the variable XDG_DATA_HOME is now null again.  \nAnyway the bottom line seems to be that KDE is using the functionality that file is using, rather than that which mimetype is using.  If I understand things correctly, this means that it is using magic instead of MIME types.  I now suspect that magic is responsible for this whole issue.  \nNew edit \nSo the file manpage seems to be saying that these are the baseline magic files:  \n\n/usr/share/misc/magic.mgc  Default compiled list of magic.\n  /usr/share/misc/magic      Directory containing default magic files.  \n\n(I have these; /usr/share/misc/magic is a link to the empty folder /usr/share/file/magic and /usr/share/misc/magic.mgc is a link to the file /usr/share/file/magic.mgc -- the latter is a 2.1 MB file full of gobbledygook) and the following text:\n\nThe information identifying these files \n\n(i.e. \"files [which] have a ``magic number'' stored in a particular place near the beginning of the file\")  \n\nis read from /etc/magic and the compiled magic file\n   /usr/share/misc/magic.mgc, or the files in the directory\n   /usr/share/misc/magic if the compiled file does not exist.  In addition,\n   if $HOME/.magic.mgc or $HOME/.magic exists, it will be used in preference\n   to the system magic files.  \n\n(I have confirmed this with strace, as suggested here.)  Neither $HOME/.magic.mgc nor $HOME/.magic exists on my system; but, since presumably xoj files contain precisely that gobbledygook which causes a file to be magically identified as application/x-gzip, it would do no good to create them (please correct me if I am wrong).\nThe solution I'm looking for, then, would be a way to have the MIME-type specification override magic for a given file extension; I thought I had seen something that looked like it might provide a hint as to how that might be accomplished, but I can't find it now.  Yet surely such a method exists.\n\nA: Not an answer, but just a comment:\n\ntried cat $XDG_DATA_HOME, which set the value (to nothing) instead\n  of reporting it\n\ncat will certainly not set the value of the variable. cat would print the contents of the file of the name you provide it with, or in the absence of a file name it would print what it reads from standard input. Furthermore the variables are expanded by the shell you are running (usually /bin/bash) and thus cat doesn't even ever see the name of the variable. \nNow in your specific situation, the variable seemingly wasn't set, thus expanded to nothing, thus cat had no parameter, thus cat printed from stdin and I presume you had to Ctrl-C-end it, or maybe Ctrl-D (end of file).\n", "Q: How Find a Linux Kernel Supported Wireless Card?

Now, it is solved, but I don't know exactly how it got solved. When I used to click on \"Log Out...\" option, my screen used to go pink, and no log in screen came. I think this is due to graphics problem, may be some driver is missing. What I did, I clicked on \"Switch User Account...\" under my username at top right side of screen. I got no pink screen, but login screen. Then I logged in back and restarted my laptop. Then, I clicked on \"Log Out...\" option. This time I got the login screen and no pink screen.

I want to do remote backups over Internet (so limited bandwidth) from an Ubuntu server to a iMac machine (POSIX compliant) supporting both ssh and rsync. I do have sudo rights on both machines.\nThe iMac location is not to be considered safe so the data should be encrypted (beforehand or on the fly).\nSo far duplicity works actually pretty good but I see one big disadvantage here, it makes one big archive (split into parts) so I am a bit worried about how it handles data corruption.\nI would prefer to have a solution in which every file is encrypted separate and can be decrypted separate.\nAnyone any suggestions?\n\nA: Unfortunately not so much response on my question. Still my time searching and puzzling might be helpful to others who want to do the same so I answer my own question.\nLike I said, duplicity works fine, does its encryption on the fly but creates encrypted backup sets with fixed file sizes. To me the disadvantage is that I don't know how it will handle file-corruption so I prefer single files.\nThe solution I came up with works with rsync and encfs. Encfs creates a virtual partition to which I can rsync my local data for backup. Encfs encrypts on a file by file basis so the encrypted data is just an encrypted direct copy of your original data. This encrypted backup is then rsynced to the iMac. By default Encfs encrypts the filenames to prevent data leaks which might weaken the encryption, however you can disable this encryption if you want to.\nFor decrypting you will need a small static options file (make an extra copy on usb-stick), your password and the encrypted file itself.\nThe differences between the two methods:\n\n\n*\n\n*Duplicity works on the fly, Encfs does its encryption beforehand.\n\n*Duplicity makes backup sets, Encfs makes a file by file encrypted copy. (So no incremental backup, though you can still do this with rsync options)\n\n*The solution which I use makes a local backup also, this increases execution time and diskspace needs. But you can also skip the local backup and use the virtual partition as your data partition, so only have the encrypted data on hdd.\n\n*With Encfs you need just the file itself to restore, with Duplicity you need the whole set.\n\n\nI also checked:\n\n\n*\n\n*Rsyncrypto, file by file encryption but file names always encrypted and a seperate keyfile per file.\n\n*Cryptsetup / dm-crypt, better suited for disk/partition encryption. \n\n*Truecrypt, preallocated partition space, not file by file.\n\n*eCryptfs, almost the same as encfs but does not work very well with sparse files and looks less flexible.\n\n\nA: You may use rclone.\nIt supports encryption and tons of backends.\n", "Q: Python urlopen function raises an error when an https site is given as input Please don't mark the question as a duplicate.

So\necho 'wc filename.txt > ./folder/newfilename.txt' >>ToThefilename.sh\n\nShould append this text to the end of ToThefilename.sh\n\nwc filename.txt > ./folder/newfilename.txt\n\nIf you want to write the output of wc filaname.txt to \"ToThefilename.sh\" you'd just do wc filename.txt >>ToThefilename.sh So if I do wc examples.desktop > foo.txt then foo.txt will contain the results of that command:\namanda@mona:~$ cat foo.txt \n 240  569 8980 examples.desktop\n\nif you just want to keep a log of things you've done to or with filename.txt you can do history | grep filename.txt > ToThefilename.sh \nIf that isn't what you're trying to accomplish, please clarify your question! To do something more complex, you're probably going to need to write a shell script that takes the input and does a few different things with it. \n\nA: You can do this with tee and a process substitution:\necho 'wc filename.txt' | tee >(bash > ./folder/newfilename.txt) >> ToThefilename.sh\n\nThe process substitution acts like a file for the tee command. tee will pipe the output of the echo command to both the file and to stdout (where the redirection appends it to the script). bash will read the command on its stdin \n", "Q: S.M.A.R.T. test reports defect, can I re-initialise the drive?

If any bad blocks are found, they are added to the bad block inode to prevent them from being allocated to a file or directory.  If this option -c is specified twice (be forewarned that this option erases data), like in:\nsudo e2fsck -cc /dev/sdXY\n\nthen the bad block scan will be done using a non-destructive read-write (eqvt. to using badblocks with the -w switch) test. If you want to do write-mode testing on an existing file system, use the -n option instead. It is slower, but it will preserve your data.\nTo print the blocks which are reserved as bad in the filesystem, you can use:\nsudo dumpe2fs -b /dev/sdaX\n\n(for the complete disk)\nsudo dumpe2fs -b /dev/sdaXY\n\n(for a particular partition of the disk)\n", "Q: How to install Ubuntu 13.10 if hardware doesn't support nouveau video driver I have Acer Aspire V3-772G laptop with NVIDIA GeForce GT 750M.\nI had a 13.04 with windows 8 until recently and all works fine.

I shrinked C drive and obtained 435GB as unallocated space. \nBIOS:\nI disabled secure boot and enabled uefi.\nInstalling Ubuntu:\nI installed Ubuntu 12.04 from DVD. It was working fine. I did shutdown Ubuntu. When I started again I saw Ubuntu, Windows etc. I was able to boot Ubuntu without any trouble. But when I tried to boot Windows I got a \"Disk error\". I pressed enter which took me back to the OS menu. I clicked on System setup which took me to BIOS screen. Whenever I change the Boot order and give priority to Windows or Ubuntu in BIOS, the corresponding OS worked. \nThen I wanted to fix this, so I tried to do Ubuntu boot repair. I go got prompts like, \"Win efi detected. Do you want to actiavate(Take backup and rename windows efi files). Do you want to continue(Yes/No)\" for which I selected \"Yes\". I got message like boot repair was successful. \nFrom my next restart, I only get grub screen. If I type exit, I get boot menu option. When I select Ubuntu, It works fine. But if I select Windows, I get a \"disk error\"\nHow should I fix this?\n\nA: Your Boot Repair output shows no evidence of the Microsoft boot loader files on your disk; however, there are other hints that they may actually still be there. In any event, I recommend you do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Linux, back up the entire /boot/efi directory tree. A file-level backup (using cp, tar, or the like) should be adequate.\n\n*Re-run Boot Repair. Enter the Advanced menu and tell it to restore the backups it made.\n\n*Download the USB flash drive or CD-R version of rEFInd and create a boot medium with it.\n\n*Test rEFInd. You should be able to boot both Windows and Ubuntu.\n\n*If rEFInd can boot both OSes, install the Debian-package version in Ubuntu.\n\n\nWith any luck, this will get you booting both OSes via rEFInd from the hard disk, bypassing GRUB.

So here you can'n rename with a name which you have already given to the folder.\n\nA: You already have a folder named Test, so the name is already taken. That is why you are seeing error.

You will receive an error that this distribution is not supported when trying to run the installer.\nI would guess vs 1.0.5 will include 14.04 LST support as 14.04 is mentioned in the documentation. \n\nA: Reading the README.in file from the source package, I found the section below. Looking for packages in trusty, I found that the trusty packages are up to date.\nWhat it does:\n\nThe installer carries out the following tasks, prompting the user\nfor authorisation when a privileged operation needs to be carried out:\n\n  - Adding a repository to the package manager configuration\n    - This will be a collabora-hosted Yum or Apt repository,\n      as appropriate to the target machine, during the testing phase.\n    - An 01.org repository is a possible candidate for the actual release\n\n  - Installing the Intel graphics stack:\n\n                      | Ubuntu 13.10 (saucy)   | Fedora 19 (schrödinger’s)\n     -----------------+------------------------+----------------------------\n     i915-dkms        | -                      | -\n     kernel           | -                      | 3.11.x (from fedora updates)\n     libva            | 1.2.1                  | 1.2.1\n     vaapi-driver     | 1.2.2                  | 1.2.2\n     cairo            | 1.12.16                | 1.12.16\n     xf86-video-intel | -                      | 2.99.906\n     -----------------+------------------------+----------------------------\n\nThe installer also allows the user to roll back to the vanilla\nversions of all of the above that ship with their distribution.\n\nI couldn't find benchmarks on the net that answer your question about improvements in power consumption between the stock saucy and the newer driver versions. This site may not be suited for such a topic.\n\nA: I've found the advantage to be better video performance and less power consumption. \nI had been using the installer under 13.10, where it performed flawlessly. However, I upgraded to 14.04 last week, where the drivers reverted to the default, since the Installer isn't supported yet. Full screen HD currently shows some tearing and the box is noticeably warmer to the touch. It's not the end of the world, but I do wish I'd waited to upgrade until after a installer was released.\nOf course, my experience is somewhat anecdotal. I'm running this on a small, fanless system with an i3-3220T chip that has Intel HD Graphics 2500. Yours will probably preform better overall, being more powerful hardware.\n\nA: these are advantages of the new Intel Graphics Installer vs stock driver in 13.10 is this what you mean?\n1.Support for Intel Celeron N281 CPU w/Intel HD Graphics \n2.SandyBridge’s New Acceleration (SNA) enabled by default on all UXA-supported hardware\n3.Power saving improvements for “Haswell” chips w/Intel HD Graphics\n4.Driver support for Iris Pro 5200, and Intel HD 5000 & 5100 graphics\n5.MPEG-2 encoding improvements for 3rd and 4th Gen Intel CPUs paired with Intel HD Graphics\n6.Rendering fix for DotA on Wine\n", "Q: Can't login to GUI with my Valid password I have ubuntu server 12.10 and installed ubuntu-desktop to access it via GUI and changed the default runlevel to 5.

The problem is illustrated in this screenshot:\n\nAs you can see my username is shown as default name. I think this is a security problem (I know, I do have a strong password for this username, and adding another layer of obscurity doesn't hurt.) Is there anyway to disable default username prompt? Thanks.\n\nA: The ftp server is not assuming your username. It's the client that it's sending your actual username as credentials.

Most of my computers in the house run Linux but I have a housemate using Windows 7. Usually, this external hard drive is connected to a file server, and files are accessed over the network; however, my file server broke down and I wanted to plug this external drive into my house mate's Windows 7 computer in the meantime so he can still access our media.\nThe drive is detected fine by Windows and it installs the drivers successfully and the device manager reports the device is working properly but it will not show up in Windows Explorer. After doing some googling and checking out the disk management utility in Windows, I've discovered the problem to be that the external drive has no drive letter assigned to it and that's why Windows can't bring it to the file manager. The usual solution is to use the disk management utility in Windows to assign a drive letter but the option is greyed out (yay Windows!).\nI found a way to assign a drive letter through DOS using diskpart but don't have access to a Windows computer atm. I'd like to assign a drive letter to this drive (and a couple of other similar NTFS drives) from one of my Linux machines so that he can just plug in the drive when he gets home and not have to have me there to set it up.\nSo, unfortunately, all the Ask Ubuntu questions that have a title asking how to change the drive letter of a disk are actually pleas for support and were resolved in other ways... I would actually just like to know how to assign or change the drive letter of a disk. GUI or CLI is fine, however, CLI is preferred. I couldn't find anything in the man pages on the part about it, nor could I find any options in gparted or gnome disk utility. I also couldn't find much by googling, except some people suggesting that it's not even possible to do from a Linux machine because Linux doesn't use drive letters, but I doubt that. Thanks.\nQuestion: How to change or assign a drive letter to disk? Preferably using CLI, but instructions to use a GUI are also acceptable (read above only if you need to know why).\n\nA: All you need to do is use fdisk (in linux) to change the partition id to 7. In your case the partition id 83 (linux partition) or something else which windows considers the volume as hidden. When the partition id is 7, windows will automatically recognizes the partition volume as NTFS and assigns a drive letter whenever the FDD was recognized. Drive letter is a mount point which is windows specific. In linux some directory, mostly /mnt/dir is used for mount point. Linux can successfully mount NTFS volumes with partition id 7 and hence you will be able to use the partition from both LINUX as well as windows.\n\nA: You have to trust in those some people that suggested you that this thing is not possible to do from a Linux machine. \nIn Unix like systems, volumes are named and located arbitrarily in a single hierarchical namespace. A drive assignment has the following naming format:\n/dev/sd[a-z][a-z][1-15]\n\nNames without a trailing digit refer to the whole disk, while names with a trailing digit refer to a partition of that whole disk. By convention, SCSI disks have a maximum of 16 minor numbers mapped to a single disk. Thus, for each whole disk, there is a maximum of 15 partitions per disk because one minor number is used to describe the entire disk (for example /dev/sda), and the other 15 minor numbers are used to refer to partitions for that disk (for example /dev/sda1, /dev/sda2, etc). \nYou can run the following command to see how the device files are named for your whole disk /dev/sda:\nls -l /dev/sda*\n\nMore about:\n\n\n*\n\n*Linux device naming.\n\n*Drive letter assignment.\n", "Q: Char device to access GPS on a Nexus 4 with Ubuntu Touch Trying to access the GPS data on a Nexus 4 phone with Ubuntu Touch on it.\nDoes anyone know if  there is /dev/ to read the raw NMEA data stream?\nI did several researches online but cannot get any info on that. \nAs far as I understand the gps chip is an Avago device, but I was not able to find the linux drivers (I was hoping to get some low level details reading the driver code)\n\nA: Best I have found so far is /usr/bin/test_gps which gives NMEA output.

When you create a new tor instance it downloads about 8.5MB of data to the specified data directory. If you are creating multiple tor processes at once, this will cause a lot of bandwidth to be used.

I've tried running this numerous times under different conditions - nothing, no avail. Is simply does not work.\nIs there any thing I could try to make it work, or it is just useless ?\n\nA: Sounds like your EXPECT stanza is incorrect or not there. Upstart is tracking the wrong pid. See the cookbook for instructions on how to use EXPECT. Note the warning about how important that section is to understand.\nNote that if your application is too forky (meaning it forks more than twice) for Upstart to track its pid, you may be able to track it yourself. The app may have a mechanism to write a pid file, or you may be able to capture it with start-stop-daemon. See this answer for an example, specifically the pg_agent.conf file.\nEdit:\nNote, if Upstart can't track your app's pid, you won't be able to use the RESPAWN stanza. In this case Upstart may not suit your needs. Perhaps a competing product like forever will. Don't know.\n", "Q: How to change free space to unallocated?

Have a look at the How can I use aptX then? section of this answer or browse the aptx.com site for transmitters.\n\nThe longer answer\nLicensing issues\nThe aptX codec is proprietary standard, that CSR acquired from APT Licensing Ltd. with the goal to develop and market aptX powered high fidelity Bluetooth audio solutions via ingredient branding. You are correct, this is a strategy for CSR to sell exclusive chips.\nI found the following clause when looking through the decoder license agreement:\n\n\n*\n\n*Implement the Software as firmware in secure code embedded in the Licensee Product\n\n\nWhile this does not answer questions about the encoder, I would say that the situation is at least as difficult as with other proprietary codecs and software components (1, 2, 3).\nHow can I use aptX then?\nYou can use it, just not as a free software solution.\nYou can find special branded Bluetooth dongles, so called aptX Transmitters. These are not the typical nano or pico-sized Bluetooth dongles, but USB Audio Class devices. (Have a look at the device classes section on the USB article in Wikipedia for more information.) This means that these devices will be recognized as sound cards and will not provide Bluetooth connectivity to the host computer. There is also one major downside: they cost almost 10 times as much as regular Bluetooth dongles.\nList of aptX Transmitters or Bluetooth dongles with aptX support in alphabetical order:\n\n*\n\n*Creative BT-D1 USB Bluetooth Transmitter, Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR\n\n*Creative BT-W1/BT-W2 USB, Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR\n\n*Sennheiser BTD 500 USB, Bluetooth 3.0\n\n*Avantree BTDG-50-WGR, Bluetooth 4.1 with aptX LL\n\n*1mii B10, Bluetooth 5.0 with aptX LL, via AskNoah, ASINs: B083TD9VW4 (US), B086KXR1CF (DE)\n\n*Avantree DG80, Bluetooth 5.0 with aptX LL\n\n*\n\n*Looks similar to 1mii B10 and probably is. Turned up as sponsored Amazon search result. I'm going to test both, particularly with two Nest Audio in stereo mode which at the moment have a 1s delay that I had to adjust in PulseAudio.\n\n\n\nCheck the configured codec of a connection\nInstall bluez-hcidump and run sudo hcidump avdtp, then connect the device and look for the configuration negotiation.

CSR documents say that solutions are available for Android device manufacturers, so I assume it's up to the phone manufacturers to decide if and how. Of course Ubuntu Touch generally supports Bluetooth headsets and I was able to pair my Nexus 4 running Ubuntu with the headsets I tested.\n\nMy experience and tests\nBluetooth modules and dongles tested:\n\n*\n\n*Desktop with nano Bluetooth 2.1 and 4.0 dongles, Lenovo T530 with built in module. - A2DP achieved almost the same quality level as the BTD 500 when playing music from FLAC files. Audio from movies was in sync with 14.04.\n\n*Sennheiser BTD 500 USB. - Pairing takes as long as with regular non-NFC capable dongles.\n\nHeadsets tested:\n\n*\n\n*Philips Fidelio M1BTBL, Bluetooth 4.0. - Works fine with all dongles and modules.\n\n*Sony MDR-10RBT, Bluetooth 3.0, NFC. - Works fine with all dongles and modules.\n\n*Creative Sound Blaster EVO ZxR, Bluetooth 2.1, NFC. - This one had the best reception range of all the three, but couldn't connect to the BTD 500.\n\n\nA: ≥ 2021: with pipewire\nPipewire supports APT-X through libfreeaptx0.\nTo install it use the instruction of the pipewire-debian ppa, in summary:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:pipewire-debian/pipewire-upstream\nsudo apt install gstreamer1.0-pipewire libpipewire-0.3-{0,dev,modules} libspa-0.2-{bluetooth,dev,jack,modules} pipewire{,-{audio-client-libraries,pulse,media-session,bin,locales,tests}}\nsystemctl --user --now disable pulseaudio.{socket,service}\nsystemctl start --user pipewire-pulse.service\nsystemctl enable --user pipewire.service\nsystemctl --user mask pulseaudio\n\nPic of the additional codecs in KDE (for a device not supporting apt-X)\n\n\nA: Perhaps you don't need aptX - as there is sbc-xq\nRecently the 'lifehack' sbc-xq has been added to linux. According to this blog\n\naudio quality of SBC XQ is comparable to aptX HD.\n\nPerhaps you want to give it a try. On my machine, I could choose between sbc and sbc-xq with the help of the blueman-manager.\n", "Q: Where can I put commands that I want to run for all interactive, non-login shells? Normally, in bash, the answer would be ~/.bashrc or /etc/bash.bashrc. But unfortunately Ubuntu is sourcing these files from ~/.profile and /etc/profile respectively. So, where should I put such commands on Ubuntu?\nSee also Why is /etc/profile not invoked for non-login shells? if you are not familiar with these files.\n\nA: If you open your man bash, you can find somewhere at the line 150:\n\nWhen an interactive shell that is not a login shell  is  started,  bash\nreads  and  executes  commands  from /etc/bash.bashrc and ~/.bashrc, if\nthese files exist.  This may be inhibited by using the  --norc  option.\nThe  --rcfile  file option will force bash to read and execute commands\nfrom file instead of /etc/bash.bashrc and ~/.bashrc.\n\n\nSo, you can use with confidence ~/.bashrc (or /etc/bash.bashrc, but I will not advice you to use this system wide file) for your purpose. And yes, in Ubuntu.\n\nA: It appears there is no standard place for such commands on Ubuntu (without modifying behaviour that may be considered standard on Ubuntu). Here is a work-around that I came up with:\nAdd this to the beginning of /etc/profile:\nIS_LOGIN_SHELL=1\n\nThen, in /etc/bash.bashrc or ~/.bashrc test for this variable:\nif [ -n \"${IS_LOGIN_SHELL-}\" ]; then\n   # Put your commands here\nfi\n\nHopefully the variable name won't collide with anything else and this doesn't change what other parts of Ubuntu may rely on.\n", "Q: How to install ubuntu on HP Chromebook 14 I have a HP Chromebook 14 that I just installed linux on. I am completely unfamiliar with linux and how to install the packages I need. I want to run iTunes and other .exe programs. Currently I have xfce as my interface. I just noticed someone else posted a similar question. So what desktop environment do I need to install?\n\nA: I haven't tried this myself, but the program you are looking for is called WINE. It allows you to run Windows programs in Linux, but it does not have the greatest reputation for reliability. Depending on what you are using iTunes for, you will almost certainly have better luck using native Linux media applications.\n", "Q: Assigning RAM in a virtual machine This is probably a really dumb question, but I want to be sure before I give my virtual machine memory. I'm going to try to install Linux on my mac through virtual box but I need to allocate RAM for it.

I then create a rule that allows incoming/outgoing of the openvpn service.\nInterestingly, with these settings I'm able to make a VPN connection using Network Connections, however I'm unable to browse. Note that without these rules I'm unable to make the VPN connection.\nI've also tried creating a rule using the OpenVPN ports and VPN IP address with no success.\nTo troubleshoot, I delete those rules and create more broad rules of allowing incoming/outgoing HTTP and HTTPS. With these rules in place, I'm still unable to browse online. I tried this while creating rules with my IP address, and no luck.\nHere's an example of my current rules, which is not allowing me to browse.\nuser1@vuser-pc1:~$ sudo ufw status\nStatus: active\n\nTo                         Action      From\n--                         ------      ----\n80/tcp                     ALLOW       Anywhere\n443/tcp                    ALLOW       Anywhere\n80/tcp                     ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)\n443/tcp                    ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)\n\n80/tcp                     ALLOW OUT   Anywhere\n443/tcp                    ALLOW OUT   Anywhere\n80/tcp                     ALLOW OUT   Anywhere (v6)\n443/tcp                    ALLOW OUT   Anywhere (v6)\n\nIs there something I'm doing wrong?\nEdit: If I set \"allow\" outgoing, and then create rules to disallow http/https connections, the rules work. I cannot browse. It is strange to me that in this case the rules work to disallow, but I can't get it to allow.\n\nA: It's because a browser is changing the port:\nTry this for know the port:\nnetstat -anp | grep\n\nBut it's changing a lot (in my case).\nSimilar inverse problem: https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+question/106974\n", "Q: How to run GUI applications remotely on a headless server?

Both of them use the built-in graphics drivers that are included in the Ubuntu installation media. There have been some questions on Ask Ubuntu about problems with the Intel HD 4000 Graphics on older releases of Ubuntu.

If it so happens that you also have some kind of problem with MBR/partition table/etc this may help you. Simply make a bootable usb with 'startup disk creator` (details here), boot from usb, follow on screen instructions.\n\nA: It sounds like you've got it booting, but I want to point out one problem that's likely not been corrected: Your /dev/sda2 is marked as being an EFI System Partition (ESP), but it's not actually an ESP. You can correct this in parted or GParted by removing the \"boot flag\" from /dev/sda2 or in gdisk by changing the type code from EF00 to 8300.\nThis error probably crept in because you misunderstood the nature of the \"boot flag\" on GPT disks. Unfortunately, the parted developers chose to re-use the MBR \"boot flag\" terminology on GPT disks, but for a concept (the ESP) that's only peripherally related to what the MBR boot flag is. Unlike the MBR boot flag, what parted shows as a \"boot flag\" on a GPT disk identifies an ESP, and should therefore be applied only to the ESP, which is a FAT32 partition that holds EFI boot loaders. Marking an ext4fs partition as an ESP is an error, which could cause problems in the future, when some future utility comes along and misbehaves because it sees two \"ESPs\" on the disk, one of which is non-FAT.\n", "Q: Trouble instaling Ubuntu on Dell Mini I pulled the hdd out and put it in another laptop and wiped it clean.

The application crashed, and after a while I rememembered I got some error messages while updating nvidia driver. I simply ignored the messages and finished driver update. After a few days I just reinstalled nvidia driver, the proper way, no error messages this time.\nPowerMizer should activate by itself automatically, but if it does not, you can check the box for POwerMizer located in NVIDIA X SERVER SETTINGS - Nvidia settings configuration - which is the last entry in  NVIDIA X SERVER SETTINGS tool. After that you can move up to the PowerMizer entry to see what happens. It should work fine unless you played with NVIDIA X SERVER SETTINGS, and checked extra options that your video card does not support.\nFIle xorg.conf is generated automatically and correctly only if you type in a terminal this code:\nsudo nvidia-xconfig\nThis command will override the previous file, back it up, and generate a new xorg.conf with the default settings.

Do you know if multimonitor works, connecting two monitors to each Thunderbolt port (two external monitors + integrated LCD screen). I come from an Optimus laptop, and it was a nightmare, I want to use the NVIDIA card as a primary GPU. It would be great to know if the laptop runs hot on NVIDIA  and how long the battery lasts.\n\nA: On My Macbook Pro Retina 11,3 (Late 2013)\nGraphics Switching:\nIt's  somewhat different for the new Retina Macbooks. On older models if you booted in EFI, both cards would be exposed and you could use a tool like switcheroo to enable/disable one of them. \nNow by default if EFI does not detect an Mac operatingsystem being booted  , only the Nvidia card will be exposed to your operating system as show by running lspci.\nThere are some grub patches to set_os to Apple to allow showing both cards, but they are not in mainline of even Ubuntu 14.04 yet.\nMulti Monitor:\n\n\n*\n\n*Nouveau: Works out of the box with Ubuntu 14.04 when using displayport, but only if I plug in the adapter before booting. \n\n*Nvidia: Works just fine.\nBatteryTime\nBattery indicator reported 6-7 hours for me\nHotness\nDoes not feel particularly hot compared to old 15\" Macbook i7 Models, but I have mainly tested it with surfing\nSince its still beta i will update this post as things progress.\n\nA: There is no such thing as Optimus on Mac. Unlike other laptops, Mac doesn’t have a switch on the chassis which lets you turn the discrete graphics on or off. If you’ve just got the laptop, you may want to try shutting down and turning off the computer, unplugging it from the wall, and pressing the power button for a few seconds. Replace the battery with another one and see if it works.

Either set the appropriate environment variables and wget will act according to them or configure the wget configuration file - wgetrc.\nSet the environment variable\nBefore setting the environment variables, lets first see if there are any preset proxy variables present. We can get that information using the following command.\nenv | grep proxy\n\nhttp_proxy=http://foo.bar:3128\nno_proxy=localhost,127.0.0.1\n\nIf no proxy environment variable is set, it will go for direct connections. Let's take an example of my college. We use a HTTP proxy server. Running wget without setting the http_proxy environment variable just fails. So, lets set this env (environment variable). variable first\nexport http_proxy=\"http://foo.bar:8080\"\n\nNow, run wget and it should work like a charm. If your proxy also requires authentication i.e username and password then use this format to set the env:\nexport http_proxy=\"http://username:password@foo.bar:8080\"\n\nSimilarly, for other type of proxies, set the corresponding env - ftp_proxy, https_proxy etc.\nPlease note that, the above commands will be in effect only till the user session expires, i.e. by running the above commands we are just setting the proxy env. for a session, not permanently. And usually we wouldn't want to run the command everytime we login. So, to make it permanent, we can either set the value in wget's configuration - wgetrc file or set the environment in ~/.bashrc file.\necho \"export http_proxy=http://foo.bar:8080/\" | tee -a ~/.bashrc\n\nIt should be noted that, this way we might be affecting the user's proxy settings. A better way is to set the settings permanently in wget's configuration file, this way no other app. is affected.\nConfiguring the wgetrc file\nLike most of the applications wget has a configuration file too - wgetrc:\n\n\n*\n\n*/etc/wgetrc, or\n\n*~/.wgetrc.\n\n\nThe former is for global changes and the latter one is for local settings(user specific). We will go into the details later, lets just see how to apply the proxy settings. Its similar to setting the proxy environment variable, just exclude the export command. Open the file ~/.wgetrc file. If one doesn't exist, then create it.\nvim ~/.wgetrc\n\nNow, add the corresponding statement in the file. Read the section \"Set the environment variable\" to find this.\nHow to disable/turn-off the proxy settings\nOnce you have configured the proxy settings in the wgetrc file, everytime you run wget, it will automatically connect to the proxy server. Sometimes for local/LAN based downloads, you may not need the proxy server. In such cases we can turn off the proxy settings using the --no-proxy argument in the command:\nwget --no-proxy http://10.0.0.1/file.tgz\n\nIf the proxy requries authentication - Username & Password\nWe already know the format for setting the environment variable with username and password. Wget provides you two methods to mention the username and password for proxy server.\n\n\n*\n\n*Mention it in the command in the form of arguments.\n\n*Set the values in the configuration file, /etc/wgetrc or ~/.wgetrc\nIf the authentication you are using is static, then its better set it in the configuration file. If its just one time thing or if you want to overwrite the settings in configuration file then you can use the --proxy-user and --proxy-password options.\nwget --proxy-user=username --proxy-password=password http://foo.bar/file.tgz\n\nFor permanent changes, its always advised to change the configuration file.\nOnce again, for global changes modify the /etc/wgetrc file otherwise go for ~/.wgetrc file. Open any of the file and append/add the following lines in it.\nproxy_user=username\nproxy_password=password\n\nSource\n\nA: For me the problem was avahi-deamon which was messing up the DNS responses for certain hostnames.
