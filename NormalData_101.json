["Q: How do I add an alternative \"open with\" command for text files in Kubuntu? On Kubuntu 11.04 I just installed gvim, which magically added an \"open with gvim\" for a bunch of text files. Great, but I would like to add another one in order to start gvim on the given file and change current working directory to the file location:\ngvim -f %F -c \"cd %d\"\n\nThe command above works fine, but I have no idea how to make another \"open with\" to use the command. I don't want to make this the default, just an option. The file manager I'm using is dolphin, if that matters.\n\nA: The KDE is using the desktop files to add the \"open with\" options. To add or edit the desktop files use the KDE Menu Editor.\nThe default application and the order of the applications is set with the File Associations. System Settings >  File Associations.\n\nA: (Comment: silly spam prevent system -> splitting the answer)\nAn image: http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/3/gvim.png/.\nAnother option is to use the context menus. With the KDE the context menus are called service menus /3/. Both the Konqueror and the Dolphin are using the same service menus.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://techbase.kde.org/Development/Tutorials/Creating_Konqueror_Service_Menus\n\nA: i'm not usin kde, but maybe it does the job if you select the other file-FORMAT you want gvim to open automatically, and select \"open with different application\" [ or at least something that sounds similar ] then select gvim, aand, at least under nautilus and thunar it does, the next time you're klickin on it, it should provide you the gvim option.\nhope to help you somehow!\n\nA: This one is quick and dirty, but it works for me 100%.\nThe .desktop files are everywhere and I usually don't get them work so I've given up and do it like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Dolphin, right click the file you want to have a new \"open with\" option.\n\n*Select \"Open with\" and \"other...\" from the submenu\n\n*Find the program you want to have from the \"open with\" list\n\n*Check the box \"Remember application association for this type of file\" and click ok.\n\n*Dont' worry. When it's done, do the same, but now selecting the original default program, and make it to be remembered again. Then everything is back how it was, plus you have a new \"open with \" option.\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to keep GNOME 2 in 11.10? Unity has been both praised and hated by different people for various reasons. Mark Shuttleworth for example says that it's designed for widescreens as an example. I do fully agree with that statement, however due to the fact that I do not have a widescreen (1280x1024) Unity simply doesn't function smoothly for me.\nThat's what it's important for me to have a good alternative. Since I really loved Gnome 2, I'd like to ask if it's possible to keep using that in Ubuntu 11.10 or would you guys suggest another alternative and if so why?\n\nA: GNOME 2.x has been replaced by GNOME 3.x, you can't really roll back the entire thing in 11.10. You can however, run it in fallback mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to revert to GNOME Classic Desktop?\n\nA: If you really want Gnome 2, your best bet is to install the stable version of Debian. Debian Squeeze. Or stick with the LTS (Long Term Support) version of Ubuntu, 10.04. Both will be supported for several years with security updates, etc.\nUbuntu, after all, is based on Debian, so perhaps its a good time to switch to the real deal. On the other hand, Ubuntu 10.04 LTS will have more out of the box features already configured. Linux Mint 11 (Katya) is also an option, although I don't know for how long it will be supported (you could look it up).\nThe fallback mode in Gnome 3 superfically appears to be like Gnome 2, but lacks much of the functionality of Gnome 2. Why take a step \"forward,\" which is really only a step backward?\nThose are pretty much your options. The Gnome 2 interface has for all intents and purposes been abandoned. Unless someone forks Gnome 2, someday you'll be stuck with the backwards and shortsighted \"advances\" (confusing eye candy for usability) of Unity or Gnome Shell. Or as others suggested you can switch to XFCE, which is a nice, more light weight system, but not really as full featured or comparable to Gnome 2.\n(By the way, there is a fork of Gnome 2 available in the AUR depository of Arch Linux, called the Mate Desktop; if you want to switch to Arch. But I'm not sure everything works properly. And there is the Fedora based Project Blue Bubble, trying to keep Gnome 2 alive, but that also I think is limited in many ways.)\nEdit: It looks like the next version of Linux Mint, 12 (Lisa), coming in November, will support Gnome 2. So this is pretty good news. It would certainly offer the most up-to-date system you could have with Gnome 2. In addition, they are working with the developer of the Mate Desktop fork of Gnome 2, to keep it alive. So that's very good news, since he was working on it alone.\n\nA: If you want something similar to, and relatively compatible with, Gnome 2, then I suggest you try XFCE. It's a nice environment and it supports many Gnome Panel applets and such. It's actively developed. Gnome 2 is deprecated and is going away from all distros. \n\nA: in 11.10, you have already two DE's,\n\n\n*\n\n*unity\n\n*gnome 3  (classic) or (fallback mode)\n\n\ngnome 3, is not gnome shell, it is the basic interface of gnome 3 with no shell above it.which is the closest to gnome 2 like. as you will have the traditional menu, in the panel to search for applications,you can customize the panel by holding alt and right click, but also lack some features. this is the closest to gnome 2.x. more info. about the gnome 3 fallback mode you can find here\nyou also can install with no problems at all:\n\n\n*\n\n*gnome shell\n\n*kde\n\n*xfce\n\n*lxde\n\n\nand use them instead of unity by choosing them in the lightdm manager when you log in.\nthere are a lot of choices of course, but if you are a gnome guy, i would like to recommend the gnome 3 classic with no shells (no unity and no gnome shell).\n\nA: I've been testing out Xubuntu 11.10 and it's actually very nice and quick but it lacks integration with Ubuntu One which is a real bummer as I've become very dependent on it.  So, what I've been slowly doing is going back to 11.04 and avoiding the Version upgrade.  Fortunately, Ubuntu One makes it easy to go back to 11.04.\nSo in short if you don't use Ubuntu One I'd try Xubuntu as it works and looks a lot like the old Gnome 2 interface.\n\nA: If you still want your ubuntu-installation to be both flexible and user-friendly, download MATE-desktop.\nIt looks and works exactly like the good old gnome-desktop.\n", "Q: Just Installed a CLI system then ubuntu-desktop, does not boot automatically I installed a CLI system with Ubuntu 11.10 Beta 2 Alternate CD. Then installed Ubuntu Desktop (--no-install-recommends). After a restart, it hangs at the below screen\n\nWhats wrong? \nBtw: I notice a CLI system will NOT boot in by default (even in 11.04), I must go recovery mode and update grub then resume boot. This happens even when there are GRUB entries for the OSes already (though I am not sure if they are invalid or something). Another method is setting nomodeset\nUPDATE\nI used edited the boot entry to include text nomodeset. Then I got a full log with 1 fail \n\nMaybe I missed a package since I installed Ubuntu Desktop with no-install-recommends\nUPDATE 2: With Ubuntu 11.10 Stable\nI just installed Ubuntu 11.10 Stable (CLI System) then installed ubuntu-desktop --no-install-recommends. startx to boot into Ubuntu Desktop OK. but reboot and got stuck on the above screen\nTried: Boot into recovery, Update GRUB, Resume got:\n\nTried booting into Ubuntu 11.10 but with text nomodeset in GRUB got similar as above \n\n\nA: Hm.  From those screenshots it looks like the display manager (LightDM) thinks it's starting but is not switching VT properly (or possibly not starting properly at all).  It's not clear whether you've tried Ctrl+Alt+F7 to switch to the VT that lightdm will be starting on.\nThe logs in /var/log/lightdm/lightdm.log might be helpful in working out what's happening.  Note: these may contain some identifying information, like your local username.\nIt's possible that either installing plymouth-theme-ubuntu-logo or adding vt.handoff=7 to your grub kernel boot commandline would fix this.\nEither way, this looks like you might have hit a bug.\n\nA: Try booting with the noacpi option, as well as both noacpi and nomodeset. There seems to be something about the ACPI initialization that gets in the way of (even text mode) video. On a related note, I had to start the 11.10 installer in noacpi  mode on my Thinkpad T420s to get it to start up properly, but after install everything works perfectly.\n\nA: Once you get all the [OK] can you just try to do a Ctrl+Alt+F1.\n\nA: It looks like an ACPI issue, but there are many steps to troubleshooting this properly. Take a look at the following wiki page and go through the steps.\n\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingACPI\n\nThis is a blog entry about what I had to do with my daughter's machine:\n\nhttp://ftbeowulf.wordpress.com/2011/10/15/oneiric-gone-wrong/\n\n\nA: I had the same problem with Ubuntu 11.10 server after installing ubuntu-desktop with the --no-install-recommends flag.\nI solved it with:\napt-get install lightdm-gtk-greeter\n\n", "Q: What are the implications of --no-install-recommends (apt-get install)? When I install packages using --no-install-recommends, can I say only packages listed here (Ubuntu Package Search) as \"depends\" are installed?\nI ask because I suspect some problems with boot might be caused by some packages not being installed. Some time back, I also had problems with Wireless Drivers and seemed to be missing something.\n\nA: That's correct. By default, Ubuntu installs recommended but not suggested packages. With --no-install-recommends, only the main dependencies (packages in the Depends field) are installed.\n", "Q: Keyboard play/stop/next/prev buttons does not work with Spotify I'm running the Spotify Linux Beta. My keyboard is a Logitech Illuminated something wired keyboard.\nMy keyboard hotkeys work with Banshee, but not with Spotify, even though controlling Spotify via the \"Volume\" widget in the top right of the upper panel works fine.\n\nA: I did the following using this guide: http://www.mabishu.com/blog/2010/11/15/playing-with-d-bus-interface-of-spotify-for-linux/\nYou will need to install mdbus2:\nsudo apt-get install mdbus2\n\nNow you can try out to play/pause:\ndbus-send --print-reply --dest=org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.spotify /org/mpris/MediaPlayer2 org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.Player.PlayPause\n\nTo bind this to a key you need for example AutoKey.\nsudo apt-get install autokey-gtk\n\nCreate a new script and use this code:\nsystem.exec_command(\"dbus-send --print-reply --dest=org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.spotify /org/mpris/MediaPlayer2 org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.Player.PlayPause\", getOutput=False)\n\nand bind it to whatever key you want to use.\nOf course you can use the same method to create hotkeys for next and previous :)\nThis command will show you which methods that is available:\nmdbus2 org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.spotify /org/mpris/MediaPlayer2\n\nThough, I don't know what will happen if you use both banshee and spotify with the same hotkey!\n\nA: Disclaimer: I work for Spotify\nThis was a known missing feature of the linux client, but we added it in version 0.9.4. So while this thread is rather old, it's worth noting that it should now work. If you continue to experience problems with the media keys, then please post a message on the community forums.\n\nA: Had the same issue with Spotify. After trying all the above, I checked the keyboard bindings, and noticed I had the hotkeys unbind. \nRun in terminal unity-control-center keyboard or go to Keyboard in your settings, go to Shortcuts tab then Sound and Media.

Such big drive is not needed. Shrink that big partition and make some space for Ubuntu, may be 20~30GB is very adequate.\nI think u know this already. Here's how u shrink your drive.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Control Panel, change the View By to Large Icons\n\n*Click on Administrative Tools and double click on Computer Management.\n\n*Select Disk Management which is under Storage.\n\n*Right click on the partition and select SHRINK VOLUME\n\n*Make about 20~30GB of space for Ubuntu.\n\n*Delete this partition i.e. Ur marking it as free space\n\n\n\nOnce U have 30GB u can go ahead with Ubuntu installation in this way.\nDuring Installation Select Specify Partitions Manually. To begin creating partitions, select the free space and click on the Add… button.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on the “Add” button. In the new window, type 2048 in the “New partition size in megabytes” field and select the “swap area” option from the “Use as:” list. Click the OK button.\n\n*Now, click on the “Add” button. In the new window, select the “Primary” option, input a value between 8,000 and 20,000 in the “New partition size in megabytes” field and select / as the “Mount point.” Click the OK button.\n\n*Click on the “Add” button again and from the new window and select the “Primary” option, type in whatever space you have left in your hard disk in the “New partition size in megabytes” field.

Its called EASEUS Partition Master v5.5 Pro, U can use this to partition any Drive without loosing ur data. \n\nA: The concept of drive-letters is a windows thing. In fact you only need free space to install ubuntu. I guess 10 gb are enough to give it an ambitioned try, but more space can't hurt.\nThe Ubuntu installation fully supports an installation alongside with windows (you just have to click the option in the installer and adjust the partition sizes with a slider). As an alternative you can create another empty drive or free disc space with a windows partitioning software and install Ubuntu instead of the free disc space or the drive. \nBoth ways are not very complicated - and in the end it won't matter which way you choose. \nWhen start the computer, the first thing you see is a selection menu (called grub) where you you can choose what OS to start.\nGood luck installing Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Clementine has high CPU usage even after shutting it down I have an issue with Clementine: sometimes (even after switching it off) it takes up a lot of CPU like on the screen here\n\nOn the screen there are visible 2 instances of Clementine but both of them are already switched off. \nAnyone also having this problem ? \nIf this matters I have the music files on ntfs partition which I mount every time I boot the system (maybe it does some indexing or things like that). BTW : can I make ubuntu mount this partition automatically ? \n\nA: I would like to confirm I'm having exactly the same issue:\nBasicly, when I \"quit\" clementine (by rightclicking the indicator icon and hitting \"quit\", not just using the close button), the process will remain active, and will keep doing whatever it was doing in the background.\nSometimes the cpu load will simply jump to 25-150% (don't ask me where that 150% comes from... \"top\" acting strange), and of course, that won't change by \"quitting\" the application.\nWorse yet: start clementine again, and it'll spawn a new process instead of using the existing one! That second process can be extremely cpu-consuming as well.\n(@nitstorm 's comment) There is nothing on the interface indicating that clementine is doing anything in the background.\nNow I found a solution to this problem: according to http://code.google.com/p/clementine-player/issues/detail?id=2088 , it looks like it's a bug due to compatibility issues between clementine and the nvidia drivers.\nOne of the bug reports has posted the following command:\nExec=env __GL_NO_DSO_FINALIZER=1 clementine\n\nI can confirm after a few tests, the above command fixes the issue.\nTo make life easier in ubuntu, you can change the clementine command in the menu editor.\n--\nEDIT: In the menu editor, it seems you can't just use the command, so I made a script like this:\n#!/bin/bash\nExec=env __GL_NO_DSO_FINALIZER=1 clementine\n\nSaved as clementine.sh (don't forget to \"chmod 755\" the script to make it executable), and linked the Clementine menu entry to this script instead of the default command.\nWorks like a charm now, even when started from the dash instead of the launcher (if you have clementine set as default for music).\n", "Q: What are these files like Zone.Identifier:$DATA and how to prevent them? I have an ext4 drive which is available to my windows XP VirtualBox as a shared folder.  When working with files across ubuntu and windows I sometimes see these autogenerated files with Zone.Identifier:$DATA appended to the name.  For example, if I have the file \nscite-2.29.msi\nThen I will get a small annoying file like\nscite-2.29.msi:Zone.Identifier:$DATA\nThe contents of the file:\n[ZoneTransfer]\nZoneId=3\n\nThey seem to be created any time I write a file to the ext4 drive from within my windows virtual machine.  I seem to be able to safely delete them without any obvious consequences.  \nWhat are these files for, and if they're useless how can I prevent them from being generated in the first place?\n\nA: That file is for storing an NTFS Alternate Data Stream - it's a feature that basically allows any file to have a number of hidden files inside it.\nI think that particular stream is written when you download something from the net - Windows can then display that nice \"Security Warning\" dialog box when you run it and offer to show you an EXEs digital certificate for example. Going to Properties and clicking Unblock may remove this, and there might be a setting to disable it somewhere in Windows.\n\nA: I found the place to disable them, at least in WinXP.

Thanks for all your help!\nIf I installed higher version of Ubuntu say Ubuntu 11.04 is their going to be same problem.\nAlso I read it some where that problem is video driver\nPlease suggest solution\n\nA: Your LiveCD works perfect because it uses vesa for graphics driver, you have as graphics an Intel HD that started to get support around 10.04 so there is a chance that something is going wrong during hardware detection.\nMore recent versions of Ubuntu fully support your graphics card (11.04 and the new 11.10 that is going to be released in a few days).\nI recommend that you try out your laptop with 11.04, its stable, has full support and should support your graphics driver right out of the box.\nHas options you can try to install a new graphics driver for your system, a ppa with the newest drivers can be found here.\nAdd it with sudo apt-add-repository ppa:glasen/intel-driver and after sudo apt-get update and a sudo apt-get upgrade install the xserver-xorg-video-intel using the command sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-intel.\n", "Q: Get Ubuntu Anywhere? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I set up remote desktop? \n\nI want to be able to remote to my Ubuntu desktop from anywhere, but securely.

In the default metamode (1), both monitors are active. I've added a second metamode via nvidia-settings (version 1.0) in which only the 23\" monitor is enabled. I can switch between metamodes using the nvidia-settings GUI. Is there a way to do this from the command line? I've read about Disper on this site but have not tried it as I hoped this functionality was available via nvidia-settings?  I can find nothing helpful in the man page though.\nEdit: After switching between the two metamodes in nvidia-settings GUI, I noticed a line in the GUI reading \"Switched to MetaMode AxB.\", where A and B specified the new resolution. So switching metamodes is simply a resolution change? I've read elsewhere that what I want to do can be achieved with xrandr. Would this be correct, because it seems all I need to do is change the resolution? In metamode 1, the resolution is 3600x1080; in metamode 2 it's 1920x1080.\n\nA: You almost gave the answer yourself.\nxrandr -s N switches to metamode N, so you can use xrandr -s 0 and xrandr -s 1 to turn the second monitor on and off.

I use a lot of GVFS stuff and live in Gedit so I'd rather not move to KDE.\nSo short of reinstalling Natty, what are my options?\n\nEdit: You can customise gnome-session-fallback's panels!\nWhile this doesn't fix everything for me (it's still ugly as sin at the moment and Cardapio isn't here), you can edit the panels.\nDepending on how you have things configured, in order to get the menus of panel applets (and the context menus of the panels themselves) you need to hold Alt and Super (aka Windows- or Meta- key) and then right click.\nI'm hoping I can fix things enough to not ditch Gnome completely but I'd still like an answer to the original question. The further Gnome moves toward Gnome Shell and Canonical/Ubuntu toward Unity, the poor users in the middle of this tug of war will eventually need another option.\n\nA: It sounds very much like you're describing Xfce. I think it's a perfect successor for Gnome 2, because in many regards, it's very similar, except it works the way it's intended to. It has panels, very similar to the panels in Gnome 2 and they even support most Gnome Panel applets and Indicators. Xfce4-panel also allows you to have different panels on different screens, which is very nice. Xfce is also a little less demanding of the computer than Gnome 2 was. \nLXDE is also very nice. It's quite a bit faster than Xfce, but also a little simpler. I'd say it's something similar to the plain UI in Windows. The LXpanel does not support Gnome Panel applets, but it does support indicators, though I think you'll have to install a plugin for it. \nLXDE and Xfce are both complete desktop environments, but you can install only their panels separately if you wish: they're called lxpanel and xfce4-panel, respectively, and you can run them with Unity if you wish. \n\nA: I found useful to install avant-window-navigator. there are not too many applets but my desktop works some what close to gnome2. Here is the link I used for this: How do I get rid of all the Unity bars?.\n\nA: After playing around with various stuff, I ended up with installing XFCE on Ubuntu 11.10 and replacing XFWM with Compiz (and gnome-wm for decorations) and Thunar with Nautilus for a better file manager/desktop handler. The result feels pretty much the same as my old 10.04 Gnome setup. Just configuration of themes and stuff is a bit messy now as each of them has their own way of config (dconf, gconf, xfconf, ccsm...).\n", "Q: Remaster Ubuntu to create LiveCD that has both Unity and GNOME Shell \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to customize live Ubuntu CD? \n\nUbuntu 11.10 release is just round the corner, and for the first time, I need to remaster the original LiveCD as per my (including most of the colleagues) needs.

They've changed the name to Zentyal, or perhaps that's a complete server with OS. In any case, you can have a look at it: http://www.zentyal.org/\nIt's very modular and seems very easy to use. Of course, products like that usually don't do much other than edit text files, so you could do it with an editor.

The published install info was incomplete and in some cases files had wrong names.\nThe zpanel x software was working great on windows never go to try it out on linux cause zpanel was offline? not to mention a jerk or 2 but there are a couple of people like caffein addict who is pretty good at pr he was willing to install for me for free but i was a tad bit pissed at how i was being treated by 1 of the other members.

What should I do to play games in Ubuntu?\n\nA: unfortunately wine for linux is far from perfect and there is little to zero dx10 and dx11 support, even making dx9 games to work usually requires a fair bit of hacking around, which is why wine is not suited to run recent windows games (older games work like a charm though.\nso you have two choices, either run windows inside virtual machines like virtual box, which incurs performance penalties or set up a dual booting machine with windows and ubuntu.\nhope this is helpful\n", "Q: apt-get update only for a specific repository When I add a PPA and I want to install some of its content, it is quite annoying to re-update all my apt list using apt-get update.\nIs it instead possible to only sync the content of a given repository?\n\nA: To update a specific repository, use -o, e.g.:\napt-get update -o Dir::Etc::sourcelist=/path/to/repo.list\n\nHere is a one-liner updating only recently added apt repository\nfind /etc/apt/sources.list.d -type f -name '*.list' -exec sudo apt-get update -o Dir::Etc::sourcelist=\"{}\" ';'\n\nIt's much quicker than updating all repositories, especially during VM provisioning after adding new.\n\nA: If the repository is configured in a specific file in the directory /etc/apt/sources.list.d/, say myrepo.list, you can update that single repository with the command:\nsudo apt-get update -o Dir::Etc::sourcelist=\"sources.list.d/myrepo.list\" \\\n    -o Dir::Etc::sourceparts=\"-\" -o APT::Get::List-Cleanup=\"0\"\n\nNevertheless this is not very convenient.\nThis can be simplified defining a bash function\nupdate_repo() {\n    sudo apt-get update -o Dir::Etc::sourcelist=\"sources.list.d/$1.list\" \\\n        -o Dir::Etc::sourceparts=\"-\" -o APT::Get::List-Cleanup=\"0\"\n}\n\nso that you can simply run\nupdate_repo myrepo\n\n\nA: The -u option was added in 15.10. From 15.10 to 17.10, you could use -u to automatically update only the specific repo you are adding:\nadd-apt-repository -u my-ppa\nThe silly thing is that this option was not added to man until 18.04 (it was documented in add-apt-repository --help, however). But in 18.04, this functionality was removed! (Again, not in man, but you can see in add-apt-repository --help).\nIn 18.04, the update functionality was changed to always do a full apt-get update after add-apt-repository. The -u option was effectively removed. It remains there for legacy syntax, but it is always set to options.update = False. In 18.04, you do have the option of -n, --no-update, which is like the old behavior. But it's all or nothing, you cannot update a single repo since 18.04.\n\nA: Y PPA Manager comes with a command line tool called update-ppa that lets you update a single PPA.\nFor example: \nsudo update-ppa ppa:nilarimogard/webupd8\n\nAlso, when adding a PPA through Y PPA Manager, the PPA source is automatically updated (only for that PPA).

Or how does dual boot work?\nInstall it on a USB?\nWhat's a good way to install Ubuntu for a person that is completely new to Linux like me? Sorry if I sound ambiguous, I'd be happy to provide more information if needed.\n\nA: Glad to hear, that you are interessted in open alternatives. \nUbuntu is not problematic to install at all. I would install it on the SSD as dual boot on a partition of 30GB (maybe less, if you're just trying Ubuntu).\nJust download the ISO image of Ubuntu or Kubuntu, burn it to CD-ROM and boot from it. You could use an USB stick to boot from, too. Therefore you could use the program \"unetbootin\" (it can download the latest image, write it to the USB stick and make it bootable).\nThe setup process is very self-explaining. In particular you just have to know how to partition a harddisk. I would set the \"noatime\" flag for your SSD, since it reduces harddisk access for read operations. But this is not necessary.\nOnce the system is set up, you can install new programs from the Ubuntu repository via Synaptics or via console per sudo apt-get install packagename.\nYou can make further optimizations for your SSD if you want.\n", "Q: How do I perform easy switching to external monitor I am currently changing between my laptop and my external monitor with the NVidia X Server Settings program and I'm sure I'm doing it in a really dumb way:\nI currently select the external monitor, set it from \"Disabled\" to \"TwinView\", then then select the laptop screen and change it to \"Disabled\".

My reasonings:\n\n\n*\n\n*Official doc did not work out of the box as of today (2/09/2014 while its last update was 1/31/2014, about a week ago). In my case I got an error and needed a workaround [1].\n\n*Even though I was able to run wordpress installed from apt-get with the workaround I mentioned above, I ended up finding the working version was 3.3.1 (as package.ubuntu.com says so too for Precise), when the latest available version on the server that's installed from source was 3.8.x, and the Dashboard thinks it's the latest. I couldn't find a way to tell it the actual latest version is way more advanced. So here I agree with the advantage in this comment.\nMy environment; Ubuntu 12.04 Server on Amazon EC2\n[1] Error on browser when accessing http://YOURDOMAIN/wordpress\nNeither /etc/wordpress/config-ec2-54-201-233-60.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com.php nor /etc/wordpress/config-us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com.php could be found.\nEnsure one of them exists, is readable by the webserver and contains the right password/username.\n\nWorkaround: Putting aside two files by like \n$ /etc/wordpress/config-localhost.php config-localhost.php.org && sudo mv wp-config.php wp-config.php.org\n\n", "Q: Checking if the latest version are installed in the system I am using Ubuntu 11.10 and now and then compiz crashes.

I am on Ubuntu and I have forgotten the password for my Gnome Keyring (yes, stupid me, I know). Any way I can get it back? I have already looked at this link, but it says it's not possible if my home directory is encrypted and unfortunately my home directory is encrypted.\n\nA: The answer for removing the specific file for \nrm ~/.local/share/keyrings/login.keyring does not work on all forms of Ubuntu.  \nOne should open up the file manager and show hidden files (CTRL + H).\nThen one should see .local/share/keyrings\ndelete all of the files in this directory and you should be good to go.\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Start up Ubuntu's Dash (top most icon in Unity or press Super) \n\n*Type Pass to get Passwords and Keys and start this (this will start the Gnome Keyring frontend seahorse)\n\n*Next\n\n*\n\n*If the password is known: Under Passwords the default folder select unlock, or\n\n*If the password is not known: right mouse click and delete for resetting.\n\n\n\nNext time Ubuntu will ask for a new password for the keyring.\n\nA: Resetting everything (delete all passwords and start new keyring):\nrm ~/.local/share/keyrings/login.keyring\n\nThen, log out and log back in. Ubuntu will automatically create a new login.keyring for you.\nOr\nNavigate to Places > Home.  Press Ctrl + H to view \"hidden files\".  Navigate to .local > share > keyrings and delete login.keyring\nUsing the same keyring (resetting keyring password but keeping old passwords in keyring):\n\n*\n\n*Make a backup of the keyring\n cd ~/.local/share/keyrings/\n cp login.keyring login.keyring.backup\n\nand after that delete login.keyring file\n    rm ~/.local/share/keyrings/login.keyring\n\n\n\n*Create a new keyring file from Gnome Keyring with the name login\n\n\n*Replace the new keyring file with the backup of the old keyring file\n cd ~/.local/share/keyrings/\n mv login.keyring.backup login.keyring      \n\n\nNote: before Ubuntu 12.10 the path to the keyrings folder was ~/.gnome2/keyrings/ instead of ~/.local/share/keyrings/.\n\nA: I'm on Ubuntu MATE 16.04 and deleting files in ~/.local/share/keyrings/ didn't help me. What helped though is running seahorse and changing login password. I entered my current password and typed the same as new one. Then I logged out and logged is and my login password became password for Gnome2 Key Storage.\n\n\nA: Um, this question and answers is all over the planet! I couldn't figure out what is going on. The distinction seems to be whether or not the old password is available. The most  common cause of this problem is restoring /home/user after a clean OS upgrade during which the user's login password was changed, for whatever reason.\nThere are other possibilities, such as one mentioned that the login password  was unacceptably short for gnome-keyring rules.\nThe following will not work to solve this problem: rm ~/.local/share/keyrings/login.keyring because there are two key rings, login and user So:  rm ~/.local/share/keyrings/*.keyring will remove both.\nIt's really difficult for the problem to remain after deleting the key rings, since they no longer exist, and new ones must be created! This is the case when the password is unavailable.\nWith that option, you'll need to reenter your various passwords that were stored previously on the key ring, as you use the applications that require them. The key ring will remember each one, and that will be it.\nIf the old password is known,  then gnome-keyring or seahorse can be used to change the password to the new login password, eliminating the need to keep entering it.\n\nA: Solved this by installing seahorse frontend.\n", "Q: Command-line equivalences of some tasks in Synaptic I already use apt-get for most of my package management. Yet, there are times when I occasionally need to use Synaptic to do certain things. I would like to learn the equivalent commands for doing the following things in Synaptic:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check a package's dependencies / dependent packages. (This can be done in Synaptic by viewing the properties of a package).\n\n*Browse available packages\n\n*Search (in package names as well as the details/descriptions) for some key. (The search function at the top of synaptic)\n\n*Check if a package is installed or not\n\n\nAlso, is there a way to find packages that are no longer necessary (e.g. a package no longer in use because I removed a dependency). I have a feeling my system is terribly bloated because I removed certain programs and not all the dependencies went with them.\n\nA: To answer your last question about finding packages that are no longer necessary. You can find packages that are no longer necessary by\nsudo deborphan\n\nAlso aptitude is per default set to automatically remove unused packages, so I'd suggest you use it instead of apt-get (it has other nice features too). Note that you may have to install deborphan and aptitude since they're not in the default install (they can be installed via apt-get).\nIf you wanna stick with apt-get you can removed unused packages with\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nHowever, I've found that deborphan manages to find more unused packages than both aptitude and apt-get.\nFinally, note that both a aptitude and apt-get can remove old packages from the archives on your computer with the autoclean option:\nsudo aptitude autoclean\nsudo apt-get autoclean\n\nAptitude can also be set so that it does this automatically.\n\nA: *\n\n*Check a package's dependencies / dependent packages. (This can be done in Synaptic by viewing the properties of a package):\napt-cache depend 'package-name'\napt-cache rdepend 'package-name'\n\n\n*Browse available packages\napt-cache pkgnames\napt-cache search '.*'\napt-cache show 'package-name'\n\n\n*Search (in package names as well as the details/descriptions) for some key. (The search function at the top of synaptic)\napt-cache search pattern\napt-cache --names-only search pattern\n\n\n*Check if a package is installed or not\ndpkg -l | grep package-name\n\nThe last one could not give the desired result, because when the terminal width is narrow the columns are truncated. Safer alternatives are\ndpkg-query -Wf '${Package}\\n' | grep pkg\ndpkg --get-selections | grep pkg\n\n\nA: \"Also, is there a way to find packages that are no longer necessary (e.g. a package no longer in use because I removed a dependency).\"\nInstall deborphan. The default mode gives a list of library packages that aren't depended on by anything - you can also use -a to get a list of all packages [which will obviously include quite a few you want to keep, but you can get an idea of what you have that you may not want that removing won't affect anything else]\n", "Q: Quickly application with ListStore as preference I'm starting to write a program with 'quickly'. A list of desired languages will be one prefereces.\nExample:\nlanguages = [\"en\", \"de\"]\n\nThe (automaticly created) quickly code that handles the preference part looks like this:\n# Define your preferences dictionary in the __init__.main() function.\n# The widget names in the PreferencesTestProjectDialog.ui\n# file need to correspond to the keys in the preferences dictionary.\n#\n# Each preference also need to be defined in the 'widget_methods' map below\n# to show up in the dialog itself.  Provide three bits of information:\n#  1) The first entry is the method on the widget that grabs a value from the\n#     widget.\n#  2) The second entry is the method on the widget that sets the widgets value\n#      from a stored preference.\n#  3) The third entry is a signal the widget will send when the contents have\n#     been changed by the user. The preferences dictionary is always up to\n# date and will signal the rest of the application about these changes.\n# The values will be saved to desktopcouch when the application closes.\n#\n# TODO: replace widget_methods with your own values\n\n\nwidget_methods = {\n    'languages': ['getter', 'setter', 'changed'],\n}\n\nIn the GUI, it seems as if the widget of choice in gtk for a list is a ListStore (which isn't a widget, but a model, but it's defined in the Glade file...). Can someone tell me what would work for a ListStore for the'getter', 'setter' and 'changed' in the code above? \nThe approach looks easy for simple entry widgets and such, but I don't know how to use it with lists. \nAlternatively, I would of course accept any other way to deal with lists as preferences, provided that the length of the list is not fixed.\n\nA: Disclaimer: I didn't know anything about quickly until I read your post, or about gui programming in general for that matter. Therefore I honestly have no business attempting to answer this question :)\nThat said, quickly is a neat project. I scanned the boilerplate source briefly and identified the following potential approaches for adding a ListStore backed list-style preference:\n\n\n*\n\n*'Monkey-patch' get and set widget_methods onto a stock TreeView\nwidget (w/ ListStore model) as defined in data/ui/Preferences$PROJECTNAME$Dialog.ui with glade.\n\n*Implement set_widget_from_preference and set_preference in the\nproject's subclass of PreferencesDialog (the subclass is Preferences$PROJECTNAME$Dialog), and do something different when key or widget is your ListStore backed TreeView widget.\n\n*Write a custom subclass of gtk.TreeView with a matching custom widget for glade.\n\n\nTo test them out, I implemented all three of these ideas -- each worked as intended, and AFAICT, identically. In the end, the third (in particular) seemed the cleanest to me, and closer to conventions used throughout the boilerplate, despite initially expecting the opposite.\n\nHere are the steps I followed for number three ...\nUsing glade via quickly design (quickly 11.10, btw), and loosely following this tutorial (part 2), add a ScrolledWindow widget to the Preferences$PROJECTNAME$Dialog.ui, drop a TreeView onto it, name the TreeView language_treeview. Create a new ListStore model for the TreeView when prompted, and name it language_liststore, etc ... eventually I ended up with something like this:\n\nNext, add a glade catalog (data/ui/preferences_$PROJECTNAME$_treeview.xml) with the following contents:\n<glade-catalog name=\"preferences_$PROJECTNAME$_treeview\" domain=\"glade-3\"\n               depends=\"gtk+\" version=\"1.0\">\n  <glade-widget-classes>\n    <glade-widget-class title=\"$PROJECTNAME$ Preferences TreeView\" name=\"Preferences$PROJECTNAME$TreeView\"\n                        generic-name=\"Preference$PROJECTNAME$TreeView\" parent=\"GtkTreeView\"\n                        icon-name=\"widget-gtk-treeview\"/>\n  </glade-widget-classes>\n</glade-catalog>\n\nThen, edit Preferences$PROJECTNAME$Dialog.ui, adding ...\n<!-- interface-requires preferences_$PROJECTNAME$_treeview 1.0 -->\n\n... to the top, under the requires tag. And change the class attribute of language_treeview to Preferences$PROJECTNAME$TreeView, in preparation for a later step.\nFinally, add the following element to widget_methods list in Preferences$PROJECTNAME$Dialog.py\n'language_treeview': ['get_languages', 'set_languages', 'button-release-event']\n\nAnd at the end of the same file (Preferences$PROJECTNAME$Dialog.py), add\nimport gtk\n\nALL_LANGUAGES = [\n  'en', 'uk', 'de', 'fr', # ... much longer list\n]\n\nclass Preferences$PROJECTNAME$TreeView(gtk.TreeView):\n    __gtype_name__ = \"Preferences$PROJECTNAME$TreeView\"\n\n    def __init__(self, *args):\n        super(Preferences$PROJECTNAME$TreeView, self).__init__(*args)\n        self.get_selection().set_mode(gtk.SELECTION_MULTIPLE)\n\n    # loads the liststore with all languages, \n    # selecting/highlighting in the treeview those \n    # already retrieved from previously saved preferences\n    def set_languages(self, preferred_languages):\n        model = self.get_model()\n        for row, lang in enumerate(ALL_LANGUAGES):\n            model.append([lang])\n            if lang in preferred_languages:\n                self.get_selection().select_iter(model.get_iter(row))\n\n    # collects only the selected languages in the treeview\n    # to save in the preferences database\n    def get_languages(self):\n        model, rows = self.get_selection().get_selected_rows()\n        result = [model.get_value(model.get_iter(row), 0) for row in rows]\n        return result\n\nIf you're interested in seeing my attempts for one and two, I'm happy to oblige.\nEdit: For the casual reader, replace any occurrence of $PROJECTNAME$ with the actual name of your quickly project (as specified in quickly create).\nHTH!\n\nA: I haven't tried 'quickly' myself, but with my GTK experience I'd use Radio Buttons to handle language selection.\nWatching the toggled event along with the button.get_active() method should be enough to check what the user has selected.\n", "Q: Nautilus/Samba Mount Problem On a laptop with Ubuntu 10.04, I have several Nautilus bookmarks to mount various Windows (7 and 2003) shares on my home network, accessed thru OpenVPN.

When I enable it as twin-view, the resolution is set automatically but when I hit 'Apply', the following happens.\n\n\n*\n\n*The image is mirrored on both screens\n\n*The image is scrambled\n\n*The image is only shown at the bottom lower half of the screen\n\n\nAfter some time (I suspect the confirm settings dialog with a time-out) the screen becomes black and only the mouse pointer is shown. It can be moved, but sluggishly. I then have to kill the session from tty. \nI installed the drivers from the nvidia website but they did the same thing. (And after 3 tries the system was so mixed up with nouveau and binary drivers that X wouldn't start and I had to restore my system from command line.)\n\nA: This seems to be a problem with the nvidia binary driver and ubuntu 11.10.\nTo solve the problem open the 'terminal' application and run \nsudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.back \ngksudo nvidia-settings\n\nNow enter your password and set your desired settings. Now do NOT press 'Apply' but instead press 'Save to X configuration file' and press 'Save'.\nNow logout and log back in.

I was wondering if keyboard shortcuts (like Alt+F1, Alt+F2) support is removed from gnome shell 3.2?\nIf not then I'm missing something as I can't seem to use them.\n\nA: ok so by default Alt+F2 doesn't work in gnome shell [source: http://www.webupd8.org/2011/10/things-to-tweak-after-installing-ubuntu.html] \n Here is solution they have provided:\n\nTo fix it, open \"System Settings\" and under Keyboard > Shortcuts > System, click \"Disabled\" next to \"Show the run command prompt\" and press Alt + F2 - this should set Alt + F2 for running the command prompt.\n\n\nA: I had what I think was a similar issue although I'm not using gnome shell. It seems there may have been an issue in a recent update that was fixed in a more recent update. I was unable to use Alt+F2, but after updating just now, I am able to use them again. You might ensure you are updated since it sounds as if you are using 11.10 beta and see if one of the 100 odd updates fixes your issue. Sorry for the random shot in the dark, but I'm fully functional again.\n\nA: Seems there is another odd behavior in the Shortcut assignment. How can you Disable again an assigned combination? I mean, I don't want no more use the Alt+F2 combination, how can I disable that? The only way I found was to \"Reassing\" the Alt+F2 combination to another Shortcut, so the previous assignment is disabled. But this is a workaround, not a feature.\n", "Q: Characteristics of Unity and Gnome3 for the End User Since Ubuntu 11.10 will support both (Unity by Default and Gnome3 after installing it from the Repos) I was wondering \n\n\n*\n\n*What characteristics do each of them offer for the end user.\n\n*What changes can an end user perceive that will help he/she accomplish tasks. \n\n*Basically what do each offer to the end user to make their desktop experience better. This can help in knowing a little more about each of them in a way of comparing.\n\nA: *\n\n*I think that Gnome Shell is a little more comfortable to navigate with the mouse only. It does have keyboard shortcuts too, and they work well, but I think Unity is a little better in that regard. Both are quite nice. \n\n*With Unity 2D being a real alternative and not just a fallback mode, it means that you can have a more consistent UI across different kinds of computers. It's also usable with a terminal server like NX, which Gnome shell is not. \n\n*The graphics in Gnome Shell seems to be a little more mature than Unity. It's somewhat snappier, although Unity has come a long way during the past months and it quite nice too. \n\n*The big one for me, is Zeitgeist. Unity has integrated it in a beautiful way. Your system seems to learn from your actions and become faster with time. It's designed in a way that seems to welcome many different lenses and scopes, and I think it'll be very useful. I'm sure Gnome Shell will get this too, but Unity is a few laps ahead in this respect. \n\n", "Q: Bulk export/embed album art in Banshee I have a well structured music library in Banshee. I used to just use folders for years so I've always been pretty good at maintaining a strict filing system. I say this not to brag (it did waste a lot of my time, after all) but to explain that my end-game should be possible.\nUntil Banshee, I never really had any use for album art so when I started using it, I used its Album Art Finder to (painstakingly) go through all 8000-odd albums. My understanding is that Banshee has these files scrobbled away in a cache directory somewhere with a meaningless name attached to them.\nI've recently moved into the world of the Squeezebox. It's awesome but I'm having problems getting it to see the existing album art because Banshee has it locked away in its own directories rather than putting it in the \"right\" place.\nSo I'm looking for one of two solutions, both parsing Banshee's database to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Preferred: Copy the art file out as /artist/album/cover.jpg (the Squeezebox server will understand this).\n\n*Embed the art into each MP3/FLAC/OGG/etc (this requires all formats to support blob metadata)\n\n\nEdit: Just found all the art in ~/.cache/media-art with names like album-f952aa94b80de0b31b8979d70d5605e2.jpg as I suspected.\nIf there's a good way of correllating \"f952aa94b80de0b31b8979d70d5605e2\" to an artist, that's what I'm really after.\n\nA: Based on the MD5 lookup in Oli's script (thanks!), I've written a Python script that uses the eyeD3 module to find MP3s, look up the album artwork from Banshee's cache, and embed the artwork inside the MP3s. It skips any files that already have artwork embedded.\nIt's not perfect, but it worked on about 90% of my MP3s, and you can manually handle any exceptions using EasyTag. As it stands the script expects the MP3s to be two directory levels deep from the target directory (music root/artist/album). The script prints a report once it's done highlighting any files it couldn't process or for which it couldn't find artwork.\nObviously you need to install Python and the eyeD3 module to use it:\n#! /usr/bin/env python\n\nimport os, sys, glob, eyeD3, hashlib\n\nCACHE_FILE_PREFIX = os.getenv(\"HOME\") + \"/.cache/media-art/album-\"\n\ndef embedAlbumArt(dir = \".\"):\n    artworkNotFoundFiles = []\n    errorEmbeddingFiles = []\n    noMetadataFiles = []\n    mp3s = findMP3Files(dir)\n\n    for mp3 in mp3s:\n        print \"Processing %s\" % mp3\n\n        tag = eyeD3.Tag()\n        hasMetadata = tag.link(mp3)\n\n        if not hasMetadata:\n            print \"No Metadata - skipping.\"\n            noMetadataFiles.append(mp3)\n            continue\n\n        if hasEmbeddedArtwork(tag):\n            print \"Artwork already embedded - skipping.\"\n            continue\n\n        artworkFilename = findAlbumArtworkFile(tag)\n\n        if not artworkFilename:\n            print \"Couldn't find artwork file - skipping.\"\n            artworkNotFoundFiles.append(mp3)\n            continue\n\n        print \"Found artwork file: %s\" % (artworkFilename)\n\n        wasEmbedded = embedArtwork(tag, artworkFilename)\n\n        if wasEmbedded:\n            print \"Done.\\n\"\n        else:\n            print \"Failed to embed.\\n\"\n            errorEmbeddingFiles.append(mp3)\n\n    if artworkNotFoundFiles:\n        print \"\\nArtwork not found for:\\n\"\n        print \"\\n\".join(artworkNotFoundFiles)\n\n    if errorEmbeddingFiles:\n        print \"\\nError embedding artwork in:\\n\"\n        print \"\\n\".join(errorEmbeddingFiles)\n\n    if noMetadataFiles:\n        print \"\\nNo Metadata found for files:\\n\"\n        print \"\\n\".join(noMetadataFiles)\n\ndef findMP3Files(dir = \".\"):    \n    pattern = \"/\".join([dir, \"*/*\", \"*.mp3\"])   \n    mp3s = glob.glob(pattern)\n    mp3s.sort()\n    return mp3s\n\ndef hasEmbeddedArtwork(tag):\n    return len(tag.getImages())\n\ndef findAlbumArtworkFile(tag):\n    key = \"%s\\t%s\" % (tag.getArtist(), tag.getAlbum())\n    md5 = getMD5Hash(key)\n    filename = CACHE_FILE_PREFIX + md5 + \".jpg\"\n    if os.path.exists(filename):\n        return filename\n    else:\n        return 0\n\ndef getMD5Hash(string):\n    string = string.encode(\"utf-8\")\n    md5 = hashlib.md5()\n    md5.update(string)\n    return md5.hexdigest()\n\ndef embedArtwork(tag, artworkFilename):\n    tag.addImage(eyeD3.ImageFrame.FRONT_COVER, artworkFilename)\n    success = 0\n    try:\n        success = tag.update()\n    except:\n        success = 0\n    return success\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    if len(sys.argv) == 1:\n        print \"Usage: %s path\" % (sys.argv[0])\n    else:\n        embedAlbumArt(sys.argv[1])\n\n\nA: I wrote this little script that follows what Banshee does (which is slightly different to the proper specs).\nIn short, this loops my music directories and, forms a hash based on the artist and album (from directory names), looks for a file with that hash in and if it exists, copies it into the album's directory. Simple.\n#!/bin/bash\n\nTPATH=\"/home/oli/.cache/media-art/\"\n\ncd /media/ned/music/\n\nfor f in *; do \n        cd \"$f\"\n        for al in *; do\n                THUMB=\"${TPATH}album-$(echo -ne \"$f\\t$al\" | md5sum | cut -b1-32).jpg\"\n                if [ -e $THUMB ]; then\n                        cp $THUMB ./cover.jpg\n                        echo \"/media/ned/music/$f/$al/cover.jpg\" >> ~/coverlog\n                fi\n        done\n        cd ..        \ndone\n\nThe echo to ~/coverlog is just there to catch where files have been copied to (in case something goes wrong and you need to delete all the cover files this writes.\n\nA: To make sure I found all albums, I needed to normalize the string to NFKD before hashing.

I've been a Ubuntu user for years now, but since 11.10 will come with GNOME3/Unity, neither of which I like, I've decided to switch to Lubuntu, which uses LXDE as the desktop environment.\nThe only problem I've come up with so far is that the default text editor, leafpad, doesn't support syntax highlighting. So far I've been using gedit for coding (html/php), I've customized it pretty nicely to work for what I need. Leafpad, however, is not customizable at all.\nThus, I ask:\n\nIs it a good idea to install gedit in Lubuntu?\n\nI know it works, because I tried and all was simple, but since gedit is a GNOME app, I'm not certainly sure whether by using it I'm not breaking the overall system performance (by adding the \"GNOME\" part into the system).\nEDIT\n\nWhat packages are listed when you try to install it in lubuntu? Can you share the list?\n\nubuntu@ubuntu:~/Desktop$ sudo apt-get install gedit\nReading package lists...\nBuilding dependency tree...\nReading state information...\nThe following extra packages will be installed:\n  gedit-common gir1.2-gtksource-3.0 gir1.2-peas-1.0 libgtksourceview-3.0-0\n  libgtksourceview-3.0-common libpeas-1.0-0 libpeas-common zenity\n  zenity-common\nThe following NEW packages will be installed:\n  gedit gedit-common gir1.2-gtksource-3.0 gir1.2-peas-1.0\n  libgtksourceview-3.0-0 libgtksourceview-3.0-common libpeas-1.0-0\n  libpeas-common zenity zenity-common\n0 upgraded, 10 newly installed, 0 to remove and 367 not upgraded.\nNeed to get 1,425 kB of archives.\nAfter this operation, 11.5 MB of additional disk space will be used.\nDo you want to continue [Y/n]?\n\n\nA: \ngedit installs GTK+ libraries - GTK+ is already in use in parts of Lubuntu.\nFor example - the default editor leafpad is a GTK+ application.\nNo real Gnome dependencies are actually installed that you really dont want in LXDE such as gnome-panel.  Thus - dont expect any adverse \"performance\" issues when using gedit.\n\nA: None of the packages on that list will load anything that can make your system slow down.\nIt will install the necessary libraries, the rest of the dependencies that are not satisfied, etc but will only call them when you run gedit and will go away when you close it. I dont think you will have any performance issues related to installing gedit on your Lunbuntu system.\n", "Q: How to convert a m4a sound file to mp3?

I have an X instance running on my server computer, and on occasion I connect to it remotely via TeamViewer. Once in a while TeamViewer crashes and I cannot restart it remotely. Is there a way to login to my running X instance through ssh, and restart TeamViewer remotely?\n\nA: An X program needs two pieces of information in order to connect to an X display.\n\n\n*\n\n*It needs the address of the display, which is typically :0 when you're logged in locally or :10, :11, etc. when you're logged in remotely (but the number can change depending on how many X connections are active). The address of the display is normally indicated in the DISPLAY environment variable.\n\n*It needs the password for the display. X display passwords are called magic cookies. Magic cookies are not specified directly: they are always stored in X authority files, which are a collection of records of the form “display :42 has cookie 123456”. The X authority file is normally indicated in the XAUTHORITY environment variable. If $XAUTHORITY is not set, programs use ~/.Xauthority.\nYou're trying to act on the windows that are displayed on your desktop. If you're the only person using your desktop machine, it's very likely that the display name is :0. Finding the location of the X authority file is harder, because with gdm as set up under Debian squeeze or Ubuntu 10.04, it's in a file with a randomly generated name. (You had no problem before because earlier versions of gdm used the default setting, i.e. cookies stored in ~/.Xauthority.)\nIf this is a one-shot, you can detect the values of DISPLAY and XAUTHORITY from a running process. This is awkward to automate. You have to figure out the PID of a process that's connected to the display you want to work on, then get the environment variables from /proc/$pid/environ (eval export $(</proc/$pid/environ tr \\\\0 \\\\n | grep -E '^(DISPLAY|XAUTHORITY)=')).\nA long-term, automatic solution is to copy cookies when you log into your desktop X session. Add the following lines to ~/.profile (or some other script that is read when you log in):\ncase $DISPLAY:$XAUTHORITY in\n  :*:?*)\n    # DISPLAY is set and points to a local display, and XAUTHORITY is\n    # set, so merge the contents of `$XAUTHORITY` into ~/.Xauthority.\n    XAUTHORITY=~/.Xauthority xauth merge \"$XAUTHORITY\";;\nesac\n\nThen you can run programs on your remote X display simply by setting DISPLAY:\nssh foo.example.com 'DISPLAY=:0 restart teamviewer'\n\nThis answer is adapted from a more complete answer to a similar question on Unix Stack Exchange.\n\nA: Probably the easiest way is to remotely (via SSH) start a vncserver on the relevant display. After that use SSH tunneling to connect a vnc client from your remote machine through the SSH connection to the VNC server.\n", "Q: Will Evolution still be included as an option? I see that Evolution is going to be replaced as the default email client by thunderbird ... I use thunderbird for my personal email, but I have Evolution set up to access my choir's IMAP email server, send out newsletters etc. \nWill Evolution still be included as an option in 11.10 and following? Or will updating to 11.10 scrub my Evolution install? If the latter I will refuse the upgrade. Please advise immediately.\n\nA: If you are upgrading, then all your previous applications that you have installed will remain installed - if there is a newer version of the app, then the application will be upgraded.\nThus for evolution, your app will be upgraded - it will not be removed.\nN.B. evolution remains in the repository - it is just  not installed by default in a new install.\nremember - as with all major upgrades - have a valid disk image tucked away, just incase the upgrade goes wrong\n", "Q: Cannot change file name on desktop I cannot change the name of a file/directory on the desktop through right click on the icon. The name becomes selected, but I cannot type in it. This has also happened in the past with some versions of Ubuntu. Is this a bug, or am I not doing it correctly?\n\nA: To change the name on Ubuntu (unlike OS X) you need to right-click and then choose 'rename'.  If you then cannot type to change the name, that's a bug.  As a workaround you could try then left-clicking on the name to see if that puts focus in the right place.\nIt could be that you're hitting the problem described in gnome bug 646900, which is fixed upstream and should be fixed in Ubuntu in a bit.  That bug reports suggests some workarounds.\nIf that doesn't sound like your bug, I suggest you report it by running in the Terminal:\napport-bug nautilus\n\n\nA: Are you using focus-follows-mouse on Unity? If yes, you can only rename the desktop icons by if there are no applictions open on the desktop.

I think grub pops up because i have often power losses, but i still want grub to load the ubuntu OS... since it s sole purpose is to be a server and local access is limited.\n\nA: You should never edit your /boot/grub/grub.cfg file - this is always regenerated when a new kernel is downloaded and installed.\nIf your Ubuntu OS is always the first in the list then the GRUB_DEFAULT=0 in /etc/default/grub is sufficient for this to be the first OS to be booted on a restart.\nIf your Ubuntu OS is not the first then you can set the GRUB_DEFAULT value to be equal to the menu entry value for Ubuntu OS - see the linked answer below on an example of how to find the OS value and how to add it to Grub.\n\nLinked Question:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I set Windows to boot as the default in the boot loader?\n\nA: Here is a link that will help you:\nGrub 2 Guide\nIf your system had a Graphical User Interface then I would recommend Grub Customizer.

I.e. is it deprecated? I prefer no-frills Ubuntu Classic (no effects) to the new Ubuntu Unity desktop. I'm glad it's still an option in Ubuntu 11.04. But will Ubuntu keep offering the option of logging into Ubuntu Classic for the indefinite future, or is it going to be phased out? Is there an official pronouncement on this?\n\nA: GNOME 2.32 has been replaced by GNOME 3.2 in 11.10. \nGNOME 2.x is where the classic desktop session came from, and is no longer maintained by the GNOME Foundation. They do however maintain a \"fallback\" mode that is similar to the old \"classic\" desktop:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to revert to GNOME Classic Desktop?\nAs long as the fallback mode exists you'll probably be able to install it in Ubuntu via a method like this. \"Deprecated\" is probably too strong a word since it'll be available in the repositories, but by default the fallback mode for the Ubuntu desktop is now Unity 2D. \n\nA: Starting in 11.10, no more gnome 2. There is a fallback mode in gnome 3 that is similar, but not exactly alike. And it lacks features like applets (system monitor, eyes in the panel, etc). But there is a fork of gnome 2 called mate, but as of now it is not available in ubuntu, but it should be soon. So if you cant stand unity or gnome 3, you should either wait and stick with 11.04, use the gnome 3 fallback mode on 11.10, or wait for mate to be moved to ubuntu. \n", "Q: How do I configure juju for local usage?

The proprietary driver is much slower than the open Radeon driver. I also had some problems with it, but none with the open driver. It's installed by default, so you don't need to install it.

It's built as a console\nprogram and it can be even used remotely in a machine that provides\noutside ssh access.\n\nFor more info you can visit following sites:\nhttp://packages.debian.org/sid/ctorrent\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/ctorrent/\nthere is also an enhanced version of ctorrent which can be found at http://sourceforge.net/projects/dtorrent/\n\nA: rTorrent\n\nI have written a detailed tutorial about rTorrent, including its installation and configuration. Check it out here or see the official user guide.\nrTorrent's pros\n\n*\n\n*lightweight\n\n*ultra-fast downloading speed\n\n*very effective BitTorrent traffic encryption\n\n*supported by all the private trackers\n\n*very customizable\n\nrTorrent's cons\n\n*\n\n*might be difficult to set up (configuration file, no GUI), example config file for beginners\n\n\nA: Try utorrent linux alpha version. Its a headless server which can be controlled from your browser (web UI). http://www.utorrent.com/downloads/linux.\n\nA: I use tget which is (in the author's words) \"wget for torrents\".  It allows you do download using torrent files or magnet links.  It is a node.js application.\ntget 'magnet:?xt=urn:btih:0403fb4728bd788fbcb67e87d6feb241ef38c75a'\n\nTo install:\nnpm install -g t-get\n\n\nA: Deluge \nDeluge is a fully featured, yet lightweight torrent client that is written in Python and utilises libtorrent(rasterbar) C++ library at its core.\n\n\n*\n\n*Standalone or Thinclient mode (split core/ui) to enable connecting to daemon (deluged) running remotely or in the background.\n\n*Multiple user-interfaces, supports access from most platforms: \n\n\n*\n\n*GTK UI \n\n\n*Web UI  \n\n\n*Console UI \n\n\n\n*Many Plugins and application extensions \n\n*Supports all the usual bittorrent client functions: DHT, LPD, PEX, UPNP, Encryption, Proxy, etc.\n\n\nA: aria2c \nA CLI downloader supporting HTTP, FTP, and Torrents.\nTo download a torrent:\naria2c file.torrent\nYou can also point it to a remote torrent file http://some web site here.com/file.torrent so you don't need to download the torrent file first.\nAlso note you can disable file allocation with this flag: --file-allocation=none.\nAria2c also supports parallel downloading on HTTP.    Use the -j flag to determine how many threads.  For 3 concurrent downloads of a single HTTP file see the following example:\naria2c -j 3    website.com/file.rar\n\nA: I know it's an old question, but nobody mentioned peerflix.\nWritten in JavaScript, works great, super simple to use, has a nice, informative and colored interface.\nMost importantly, it supports streaming of video and audio content through VLC (just launch it with the flag --vlc).\n\nA: Azureus \nAzureus/Vuse also has a console mode. [disclaimer] I was one of the developers.\nTo use azureus in console mode, you will need to download a couple of additional libraries from http://svn.vuze.com/public/client/trunk/uis/lib/\n\n*\n\n*commons-cli.jar\n\n*log4j.jar\n\nIf you place these in same the directory as the Vuze jar, you can launch the console ui by running:\njava -jar Vuze-xxxx.jar --ui=console\n\nInside the CLI, type help to view the commands. A couple of useful commands are:\n\n*\n\n*show torrents\n\n*add [url]\n\n*start [x]\n\n*stop [x]\n\n*remove [x]\n\nHere is example output from a 'show torrents' command\nshow torrents\n> -----\n 1 [>] 025.6%   Azureus4.7.0.0.jar (13.26 MB) ETA: 1m 41s\n                Speed: 295.1 kB/s / 0 B/s       Amount: 3.56 MB / 0 B   Connections: 11(20) / 0(4)\n\nTotal Speed (down/up): 296.6 kB/s / 2.2 kB/s\nTransferred Volume (down/up/discarded): 3.56 MB / 0 B / 0 B\nTotal Connected Peers (seeds/peers): 11 / 0\n> -----\n\nTake a look at http://wiki.vuze.com/w/Console_UI for more information :-)\n\nA: Transmission\nThe default BitTorrent client of Ubuntu Desktop, Transmission, has a command line interface (which is not installed by default, the package is transmission-daemon). The daemon can be setup so that it may be interacted with through the terminal and through a web interface.\nTransmission is a good bittorrent client because:\n\n*\n\n*It's lightweight with either interface.\n\n*It's stable, never had it crashing.\n\n*It's easy to understand.\n\n*It has function expected of a modern bittorrent client, e.g. local peer discovery, full encryption, and support for DHT, µTP, PEX and magnet links.\n\nFor more info on its features, see this page.\n\nA: My recommendation without installing anything (if you have node)\nnpx -p webtorrent-cli webtorrent download \"magent:...\"\n\nIt's will temporary download the webtorrent-cli pakcage, then execute the webtorretn commmand to download your torrent.\n\nA: You can use torrent-dl\nIt was originally based off of tget, a tool mentioned in this answer, but the project has since significantly diverted from it. tget does not offer any configurability (e.g. searching popular torrent sites, customizing what port to use, downloading multiple torrents, etc) so torrent-dl adds all of these features.\nExample usage (with some of the extra options):\ntorrent-dl -i magnet:?xt=urn:btih:b26c81363ac1a236765385a702aec107a49581b5 --port 43022 --connections 250 --uploadslots 25\n\nYou can see all the options it offers on it's Github page linked at the top. It is a nodejs application, however you can download standalone binaries (MacOS and Windows binaries are also available) from the releases page on it's Github, meaning no nodejs or npm installation is required.\nIt can also be installed via npm, however:\nnpm install -g torrent-dl\n\nI am the author of this project.\n", "Q: Tracking memory process wise on Ubuntu I have an rails 3 application with 100-200 daily unique visitors. The\ntotal memory consumed on the server(Ubuntu) is around 1.5-2 GB. I want to know\nhow much memory is used by each process. What are the best tools to\ntrack memory used by different processes?\n\nA: Memory management is very difficult, but you can use top, htop or, as dannysauer suggests, something like ps vax | sort -k8n. If you want to get an overview/summary, then free -m is nice. \nBut it is common for processes to consume less memory than they use. For instance, if you have ten processes using 10MB each, that does not mean those processes will consume 100MB. The reason for this is that Linux will recognize identical memory portions between processes so you don't need to have many identical copies. In other words, your system can always use more memory than you have. So you really need to separate between memory consumption and memory usage. \nIt's not always easy. \n\nA: You could just fire up top and press M to sort processes by memory usage.\nYou could run ps vax | sort -k8n to show processes sorted by the resident stack usage (ps v switches to a memory-centric view).\nYou could enable snmp and configure mrtg to periodically poll the system, generating a graph of how much memory is used by the processes you care about.\nYou could resign yourself to the knowledge that Ruby, for all its benefits, is terrible at managing memory in long-running processes. :)\nYou could combine a more complicated ps command line (look at the man page, and read about the -o option) and rrdtool with a shell script to generate historical statistics on the processes you care about.\nEtc.\n", "Q: PXE server to boot ISO or other linux distro over network How do i setup my ubuntu desktop to act as a pxe server to boot ISO's across the LAN. And is it possible to run linux distros like linux mint, moblin etc so that boot at client would be faster. \nI have some Intel Atom kits which can run windows 7 pretty fast.. but I want them to run customized linux which can show only browsers. So I thoght of making live CD image(iso) and boot them from network. Rather than spending money for harddrive for every clients which is not going to be used other than booting os.\n\nA: look into clonezilla http://clonezilla.org/clonezilla-SE.php I'm sure there are other options available but you can use the drbl to auto start via pxe to just load a basic client on the machines.. Either to image the machines or to boot into a client for them to run.

The scripts should simply set up ubuntu the way you want. Install any programs you want and/or set up the system with like; power management, system theme, user background etc.\nGood luck and it's always easier to have post-install scripts if you would need to re-install Ubuntu or upgrade it. \n\nA: I just use remastersys.  It just works.\nGo here for tips on how to use it http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/remastersys\nAdd deb http://www.geekconnection.org/remastersys/repository karmic/\nto your sources\nYes, the karmic part is fine, as its for grub2 based ubuntu\n", "Q: How can I fix the broken edge flipping feature? Since Unity was used on Ubuntu 11.04 Beta, this problem has been distubbing me for a long time.\nYesterday I found the bug report and try to get it well, but still there's one problem.\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/compiz/+bug/771448?comments=all\nI did as the post told in #6, edge fliping works well at first.\nLater I found every time I reboot, the edge flipging at Top will not work.\nAfter I ran \"compiz --replace\", it worked in the right way.\nI checked that report again, without seeing a better solution.\nSo how can I deal with that problem?\n\nA: According to the FAQ this question is not valid, beta is beta, there is a reason its called beta, its not finished! You just will have to wait for the bug to be solved or add unity --replace as suggested to your start up (or add it to any startup script you might have) ;)\nIf you want to add it to a script on your start up programs search for the program Startup Applications.\nSave this (or add it to your startup script) on your home folder or somewhere you have permitions:\n#! /bin/bash\nunity --replace\n\nyou will need to use chmod 755 <nameofthescript.sh> to make it executable. Add the scrip to the Startup Applications list and that should be able to fix it until a new package comes.\nIf you dont have a startup script just add unity --replace to your start up applications list.\n", "Q: upstart respawn with two child processes I have an upstart script like so:\nstart on runlevel [2345]\nrespawn\n\nscript\n  exec su - ubuntu -c \"cd /opt/app; bin/widget 2>&1 | logger -t 'widget'\"\nend script\n\nThe problem is when the widget process crashes, it doesn't respawn.

Have you checked the hdparm output to make sure that you're using DMA?  Simple disk access shouldn't freeze the system up unless there's something else going on.  I'd look at the dmesg output and install the smartmontools to see if your drive is tossing out ATA errors or if SMART thinks the drive is dying.\nAnd do what jnv said by cranking swappiness down; Linux prefers by default to swap idle programs out in favor of caching data from the hard disk, and with an encrypted homedir, there's a lot more disk activity to cache (you might consider not using homedir encryption, and just use gpg or similar to encrypt stuff you actually care about). :)\n\nA: You could try these two things to reduce swapping:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reduce swappiness (60 is default, try setting it to 10)\n\n*Try zRam (This will first compress data in your memory before swapping it to harddisk)\n\n\nA: Upgrading to Ubuntu 2014.04 solved the problem.\n(just an upgrade, not reinstall)\nSo it was actually not a hardware problem :-)\n", "Q: How do I restrict vsftpd access to a certain directory? I would like to give a user access to our ftp server.

I've read about restricting a user to his home directory but not to other directories.\nIf this is not possible with vsftpd is there maybe something thats more configurable?\n\nA: restrict access to the home folder and then mount the folder the user needs to work in under his home directory.\nadd the line to fstab\n/var/www/hisdir     /home/username/somefolder name          none        bind     0   0\n\n", "Q: Alt key in Autodesk Maya 2011 using Gnome This might be a dumb question, but I've googgled and searched for it and couldn't find any good answer.\nI am using Maya 2011, which usually uses the ALT key as a shortcut by default for a lot of things (select objects, etc...). However, since Gnome uses ALT + click to drag windows, Maya does not let me use ALT for anything, and apparently the Windows key has taken now this role, so I can select objects through Windows key + click while ALT + click drags the whole window.  \nI know I can change the ALT key behaviour in Gnome in Windows Preferences -> Movement Key, but this does only changes ALT behaviour in Gnome, while Maya still uses Windows key for selection.\nI am asking this because in KDE was a very simple thing to change, I remember I just changed something about modifier key, and it all went back to normal, without changing any configuration inside Maya, and I believe Gnome has to have a similar option that I cannot find.\nThanks!\n\nA: Ok, I'm such an idiot :)\nAll I had to do was restart Maya after setting Preferences -> Windows -> Movement Key and set it to Super. Now you drag your windows using Super + click, and in Maya your ALT key behaves as expected.\nI was about to delete this question, but I will leave it in the system, just in case someone into the same error...... Cheers! \n\nA: Go to \nSystem->Preferences->Keyboard\nLayouts\n> Options...\n   > Alt/Win key behavior\n        > Left Alt is swapped with Left Win\n\nNow you can run Maya.\nhttp://rodmena.ourway.ir\n", "Q: Manage your terminals I work with terminals all the time, and most of the windows opened are teminals. I would like to get them somehow organized, for example in tabs. But the problem is I open them from nautilus (Open in Remote Terminal https://github.com/umpirsky/nautilus-scripts/blob/master/Open%20in%20Remote%20Terminal) so it opens always a new window.\nIs there any tool that can keep then on one terminal window in separate tabs? I saw terminator, but that works separated from native ubuntu terminal app.\n\nA: If you have terminal window \"A\" open and terminal window \"B\" open.\nYou can select window \"A\", then open another tab in that window with Ctrl + Shift + T.\nAfter that you can click and drag Tab \"A\" to \"B\" leaving a window with the last created tab alone and a new window with your two old windows \"A\" and \"B\" as tabs.\nAfter this you can right click on the tabs to give them labels.\nI can do this with the gnome-terminal, a.k.a. the standard terminal.\n\n\n\nThen you can change the default switch to next tab to a more practical key.\n\n\n\nA: There is a plugin for Compiz that enables you to group and tab different windows of any kind. It's not entirely stable though. :) \nThe plugin is called Group and Tab and it's available in the compiz-plugins-extra package. \n", "Q: How should I suggest a developer switch to an application indicator? I use several applications with non-appindicator indicators. This means the UI for them is inconsistent (on Ubuntu at least, if not elsewhere). I'd like to suggest they switch to using application indicators in a friendly, helpful way. What would do the trick?\nPlease add new answers below or add comments, especially regarding anything anything incorrect or missing. (Would it make more sense for this be a community wiki?)\nA lot of this content came from an AU answer. How do I credit it properly?\n\nA: I currently have [YourAppName] installed on Ubuntu [version]. Starting with Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, Ubuntu has introduced a replacement for notification area items called application indicators (or appindicators). This is a cross-distro, cross-desktop mechanism to standardize the system tray interface. I'd like to suggest that [YourAppName] updates its indicator to an application indicator.\nApplication indicators have the following benefits:\n\n\n*\n\n*Support for KDE, Gnome 2, Gnome Shell (Gnome 3) and Unity. This means that you only have to do the work once. Which is rather nice.\n\n*Accessibility and usability. Screenreaders can read application indicators (not true with all notification area items). Application indicators also provide a consistent user interface (same behaviour on left-click, scrubbing, etc).\n\n*System integration/reduce clutter. You can reduce clutter and integrate your application indicator with system indicators (where applicable). For example, email, IRC and instant messaging applications can integrate with the messaging menu.\n\n\nFor details on implementing application indicators, see:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://unity.ubuntu.com/projects/appindicators/ (including technical overview, API and examples)\n\n*https://launchpad.net/~ayatana-dev (mailing list)\n\n*What is the difference between indicators and a system tray? (source for a lot of this content)\n\n*http://developer.ubuntu.com/resources/tutorials/all/ - no application indicator tutorial yet but maybe soon\n\n*KDE specific: How to use application indicator for KDE application?\n\n*System integration points:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MessagingMenu\n\n*https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SessionMenu\n\n*https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SoundMenu\n\nA: Thanks for going to the effort of asking developers to make their applications work better with Ubuntu!\nApplication indicators work not just “starting with Ubuntu 11.04”, but starting with Ubuntu 10.04 LTS.\nI suggest not referring to “the Ayatana design team” — developers are unlikely to know what that is, and it isn’t relevant to your point. Just say “Ubuntu”.\nIf a program has a “system tray indicator”, then it’s already doing the right thing and you’re using Gnome 2. I think you mean “notification area item”.\n“with application indicators they can be addressed” … Well, are they? This could be much shorter if you just said “More accessible — works better with screenreaders”, or something like that.\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/DesktopExperienceTeam/ApplicationIndicators includes a lot of information that is interesting only to developers of Ubuntu itself. I suggest leaving it out, especially since it’s already linked to from the unity.ubuntu.com page anyway. And the “What do I need to tell a developer” page doesn’t contain relevant information (and reads more like campaign organization than documentation), so you could leave that out too.\n", "Q: Do application indicators work/help outside Linux? If someone created an application that used application indicators, which are famously supported across multiple Linux desktops, would it benefit them on Windows or Mac OS?\n\nA: Potentially, yes. They use DBus as a transport mechanism and this is available for Windows, for instance. So you'd write a Windows notification icon that rendered itself based on the DBus data and the indicator would appear as a normal Windows notification icon. The same is true for OS X.\n\nA: The application indicator falls back to using a GtkStatusIcon that will work on other OSes. You won't get as nice of menu integration, like what you have on Ubuntu, but it should work.  Now, all that comes with the warning that I don't have a copy of Windows to test it.\n\nA: I wrote my own Python replacement for appindicator when I was developing StackApplet. It runs on any platform with PyGTK installed (including Windows).\n", "Q: Modifying Key- and Mouse-Bindings for GNOME Shell Is there an easy way to modify key- and mouse-bindings for GNOME shell? The gnome-tweak-tool is far from complete regarding these issues and the system settings doesn't include any such options. I guess there is always the possibility of opening the [gd]conf-editor. If that is our final resort for now what key patterns are involved then?\n\nA: To change the keyboard bindings, find the keyboard section in the system settings application. Under the shortcuts tab, find the shortcut that's called something like \"Go into Overview Mode.\" Then you can change it to whatever you want.\nTo disable hot corner, see this question.\n\nA: All keyboard shortcuts are configured via system settings/keyboard/shortcuts.\nOverlay mode can be activated with keybinding \"show main menu\".\nThere're no mouse-bindings.\nUnder the hood.\nStandard keyboard shortcuts are stored at:\ngconf:///apps/metacity/global_keybindings\ngconf:///apps/metacity/window_keybindings\n\nModifier to manipulate windows (drag, popup menu) is at:\ngconf:///apps/metacity/general/mouse_button_modifier\n\nShortcuts to launch browser/email/etc at:\ndconf:///org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys\n\nKey to enter overview mode is at:\ngconf:///apps/mutter/general/overlay_key\n\nThe option value is keysym (as given in xkb-config or ~/.Xmodmap), you may put \"Menu\" here to use menu-key to launch overview.\nWhen assigned to other keys it may behave weird.\n\nA: You can find all the keybindings used by Gnome Shell at the dconf location\norg.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings\n", "Q: What PCI WiFi cards Work with 11.04?

Worked straight away. It's called D-Link DWA-556. I'm really happy with it. Drivers are built-in and no required configurations except providing the password for the network, of course. \n\nA: If the Linux kernel supports a particular wireless adapter then Ubuntu will support that wireless adapter. The latest Ubuntu will always have the latest Linux kernel and therefore have the most up to date support for any kind of device.\nIf a Ubuntu developer were to produce a driver module for a certain device, then that code would be passed upstream to the Linux kernel developers for inclusion in the kernel and then come back down stream when the modified kernel is used by Ubuntu. This is how the system works. In this way all Linux users would benefit. \nYou have answered your own question by making the link to the WiFi Docs Wireless Cards Supported page, which was updated in August of this year.\nRegards.\n", "Q: Nautilus on Ubuntu 11.10 keeps crashing I noticed that my nautilus keeps crashing when I open a folder\nVideo: http://www.screenr.com/B20s\nIf more info is required just let me know how I can get them\n\nA: *\n\n*If you have the package \"nautilus-open-terminal\" installed then remove it using Synaptic or using the command: \napt-get --purge remove nautilus-open-terminal\n\n\n*Try to remove nautilus config files using the command: \nrm -rf ~/.nautilus\n\n\n*Find another solution from here\n", "Q: How can I force Déjà Dup to make a full backup? My déjà dup backup seems to be corrupted, at least it tells me on every backup that there's a CRC error and aborts the backup.\nNow I think with a full backup I could fix this, but I haven't found a way to do that easily.\nSo, is there a setting in déjà dup I could use or some simple steps with duplicity (Considering that I want it to respect my déjà dup settings.)?\n\nA: The short answer to your question is no.  You can force it by deleting your backup files entirely and starting fresh, but I have a better suggestion below.\nI'm going to guess you are using Ubuntu 11.04 or earlier?  It sounds like you've hit bug 676767, which was (I thought) fixed in Ubuntu 11.10.\nThe workaround is to run the following:\nrm -r ~/.cache/deja-dup\n\nIf this does not fix the problem, please file a bug.\n\nA: You would not have to delete your old backup files. Just create a new folder to backup your files to. If you backup to a folder without any prior backup files in it, then déjà dup will create a \"first backup\". Alternatively, you could move your old backup files to a new folder.\n\nA: You can do this by going directly to Déjà Dup's backend, Duplicity.\nHere's how:\nduplicity full source_directory target_url\n\nHowever, I don't know you get the exact command needed to duplicate all the options you've stored in Déjà Dup (excluded directories, etc).\n", "Q: LaTeX build server with git I have a LaTeX project in git, there is a makefile. So basically a server would have to do this:\ngit checkout master\nmake > logfile 2>&1\n\nGiven that I push into a repo on the server.\nI could do this with a cron job, but it seems kind of missing the point. Is there some way to initiate this after I pushed via SSH?\n\nA: You can do this in native git with a post-receive hook. Since you shouldn't be pushing to a non-bare repo, you'll need a script along the lines of this\n#!/bin/sh\ntarget=\"/tmp/math\"\nexec > \"$target/$(date +%s)_$(uuidgen).log\" 2>&1\nmkdir -p \"$target\"\nGIT_WORK_TREE=\"$target\" git checkout -f\ncd \"$target\"\nmake\n\nPut that in hooks/post-receive inside the bare repo, and you should be all set (note that this will not create $TARGET_DIR, you'll have to do that manually)\n", "Q: How do I change resolution without screen in Jupiter applet?

I'm assuming reinstalling would fix the problem, but if I can fix it without reinstalling that would be ideal. Any ideas/suggestions are much appreciated. (I have tried the keyboard shortcuts, with no results.)\n\n\nA: When a window is bigger than the resolution of the monitor do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press and HOLD ALT (On Ubuntu 18.04+ Hold SUPER) and then simply click and HOLD the mouse button over the window you want.\n\n*Start dragging it until you can see the top part or at least a corner to resize it. Keep holding the corresponding key while doing each click until you can see a corner or the top. From there just resize it as you like.\n\nA: Try this:\nAlt+F7\nand then you can move the window, so you can reach the button :)\n\nA: You simplify use shortcut for GNOME window ALT + F8 in order to move it freely.

I couldn't reach the up/down or left/right bars, so I tried what I thought was moving the screen to the left.  I ended up resizing it, so then it was left adjusted, but the text still started 3/4 of the way to the right.  After playing with it a while, I found if I went to the work space switcher and selected the space my file was spilling over into, I could 'pull' the page back into place by resizing it back where it belonged.\n\nA: I had the same problem and solved it.

How can I add a script to nautilus for running selected file as administrator (not open as administrator)? And if it is possible, I want to run this file as administrator without entering my password.\n\nA: Information on using sudo or gksudo on scripts without password\nYou need to do the following, on the terminal type sudo visudo and add a line like this at the end of the file specifying the commands you want to run without typing the sudo password:\n<yourusername> hostname=NOPASSWD: <command1>, <command2>\n\nNow you can run the specified commands without password as long as you type that command with sudo.\nie: lets you want to run shutdown -r now without having to type sudo password everytime and your username is 'joedoe'\n\n*\n\n*type sudo visudo on a terminal\n\n\n*Add joedoe hostname=NOPASSWD: shutdown -r now as a new line at the end of the file\n\n\n*on your script you can then use sudo shutdown -r now without having to type the sudo password.\nTo create a scrip use your favorite editor to create a <nameofyourscript>.sh with the contents:\n#! /bin/bash\n\nsudo <commandsyouwanttorun1>\n<commandsyouwanttorun2>\nsudo<commandsyouwanttorun3>\n\nUse sudo to call commands that need it, it wont ask for password as long as you added that on the NOPASSWD: <commmand1>, <command2>, etc line in visudo.\nAfter that you need to make it executable with: sudo chmod 755 <nameofyourscript>.sh.\nNow you can run your script using sh <nameofyourscript>.sh on a terminal, by double clicking on it and selecting run on the dialog box or put them in your ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts/ which then will be available on your scripts menu when you right click on nautilus:\n\nCreate a right-click \"Open as admin\" without password\nTo create a scrip that opens files using administrator permissions by right clicking on them and making it so that no passwords will be asked create a script with the following:\n#! /bin/bash\nfor file in $NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_SELECTED_FILE_PATHS; do\ngksudo \"gnome-open $file\" &\ndone\n\nSave it on your ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts/, make it executable with sudo chmod 755 ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts/<nameofyourscript>.sh, using sudo visudo add the line <yourusername> ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/gnome-open and save the file.\nYou should be able to right-click a file, move to your scripts folder and selecting the script you just created to open that file using root permistions. gnome-open will handle the file type as good as possible.\n\n\n\nA: Nautilus scripts usually are to be placed in $HOME/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts/ and need to be executable. That being said, the follow script should do, what you want:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nIFS='\n'\n\nfor file in $NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_SELECTED_FILE_PATHS; do\n    gksudo -k \"sh -c 'chmod +x $file; $file'\"\ndone\n\nYou can access that script from nautilus by right clicking on the file, hovering over the script menu and then clicking on the filename of the script in $HOME/.gonme2/nautilus-scritps/. You still have to enter your password though.\nThere is no secure way you can do this with arbitrary files without entering your password. For special commands the process is described in brunopereira81's post here and uses sudo but depending on the commands will lead to a vulnerable system. If you don't care (and I strongly advice against this) you can set ALL commands to use NOPASSWD and replace gksudo by just sudo.\n\nA: You can use this Nautilus extension. Nautilus-gksu .\nsudo apt-get install nautilus-gksu\n\nInstalling it adds a 'Open as administrator' entry in your nautilus right-click menu.\n\nWhen you need to open any files with root permission, you just have to right-click on the file, select 'Open as Administrator', as simple as that.\nFor more cool extensions visit : http://www.techdrivein.com/2010/09/6-useful-nautilus-extensions-and.html\n", "Q: Can I distribute an Ubuntu appliance? For my computer class we need Linux. So I recommend to get Virtual Box and Ubuntu. But since there has to be TeX and Emacs installed which is non-trivial for novices, I thought I might set up an appliance to help them.\nI realize that it is free software for the most part, but I am not sure how to handle the Ubuntu brand name in this case.\nIs it legal to create a Ubuntu VM, install some packages and make the bundle available for download?\n\nA: What you want to do is basically creating an Ubuntu derivative (please correct me if I'm wrong).\nAs long as you choose to distribute free software, the only problem you may encounter is the Ubuntu branding, which has some trademarks. As of writing, the intellectual property policy contains, among others, the following statements:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*...\n  \n*You can modify Ubuntu for personal or internal use\n  \n*You can make changes to Ubuntu for your own personal use or for your organisation’s own internal use.\n  \n*...\n  \n*Any redistribution of modified versions of Ubuntu must be approved, certified or provided by Canonical if you are going to associate it with the Trademarks. Otherwise you must remove and replace the Trademarks and will need to recompile the source code to create your own binaries. This does not affect your rights under any open source licence applicable to any of the components of Ubuntu. If you need us to approve, certify or provide modified versions for redistribution you will require a licence agreement from Canonical, for which you may be required to pay.

Canonical’s updates will be consistent with every version of Ubuntu approved, certified or provided by Canonical.\n  \n*...\n  \n\nSo, in short, if the distribution is for personal or internal use, you have fewer restrictions. If instead you want your distribution to be publicly available for download, you must either get rid of trademarks or ask Canonical for permission.\nIf you are going to distribute non-free software, then you might encounter other possible legal problems, but they are related to the software's license, not to Ubuntu itself.\n", "Q: Looking for a super-low-power any-arch DIY Squeezebox reciever As I said in another recent question, I've recently bought into the Logitech Squeezebox range.

Every six months a new Ubuntu version will be released. Does anyone know at which time this will be?\n\nA: There is no exact time when Ubuntu is released.\nYou can find the expected release date on the Release Schedule. In an interview on Ubuntu-User Kate Stewart, the Ubuntu Release Manager at Canonical, outlines how the release announcement works:\n\nThe release team needs to do final checks to make sure all the right bits are in the right places, and no blockers have cropped up as a result of the last bug fix or upload. If people are trying to download the images during this final bit of testing, the slower the testing goes (and they run the risk of pulling down a flawed image) and it delays the time until we can actually release.\nThe official release announce is mailed out to ubuntu-announce maillist. Copies of prior release announces can be found in the mail list archives. Once we hit send on that email, the IRC channel is updated, as is the News & Announcements section on the Ubuntu Forums, a post is made on the release blog, and the Launchpad project is updated.\n\nThe simple explanation is, it's not based on time, it's based on the amount of checks they get through.\nRecently the team has added a realtime checklist that you can follow along with.\n\nA: It's usually about 4pm UK time, I know this from previous releases that it's around this time slot.\n\nA: Unless there is a show-stopper then yes it is released tomorrow, when exactly depends and tbh I'm not sure.  You could grab most of it now, if its not the final iso already.  What I tend to do is install zsync (sudo apt-get install zsync), and grab daily iso images for testing and use zsync to update the iso with the changes between each, thereby saving a lot of bandwidth.  Head over to http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily-live/current/ , scroll down and right click copy the url of the image you want to get, but make sure it ends in .zsync\nRun a terminal (ctrl alt t) and type zsync paste url here\nzsync http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily-live/current/oneiric-desktop-i386.iso.zsync , for example\nIt will download the full iso if you don't have it already, and if you do it will only get the differences between the one you want and the one you have.  So all you have to do when its released is rename the file you have to the same as the final release name (ubuntu-desktop-i386.iso etc) and use zsync with the url of the final release zsync file to make your iso the same as the final.  You may find an iso today is the same as the final tomorrow.  Either way its a great tool.\n\nA: They first need to distribute the new Ubuntu version to several worldwide servers which will be used as the download sites for users like you and me. After that they update the links for them in ubuntu.com (To avoid having a million users download from the same site at the same time). Normally this takes some hours but afterwards (A couple of hours AFTER they mention the release of the new Ubuntu version) all servers that will help with the download should have the updated version.\nAlso the exact hour, minute and second is not an exact science. Depends on several factos including if the dev in charge of it gets to work in time (Anything can happen). Depends if the machine that he/she uses works right (Again, anything can happen) and depends if he/she drank his/her morning coffee/red bull/whatever and feels cheery/grumpy to make the final release at that moment (Instead of enjoying the day playing with super mario o super \"maria\"). What am trying to say is that a lot of things can happen in a day that will not make an exact hour pass for the latest Ubuntu release or any other (Except for the creepy 10.10 which was 10.10.10 at 10:10:10)\nWe all know the dates are in October (The day varies) or in April (Also the days varies).\n\nA: According to Ubuntu's FAQ, the release dates are UTC based. \nAlso, Canonical is currently UK based company, so it would be logical to expect it in afternoon GMT time.  \n\nA: It will be done tomorrow BUT the time depends strongly on what happens to the devs that will be working on releasing the ISO. Some questions that should be made are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Will they get up early?  \n\n*Will they eat their breakfast in a happy way?  \n\n*Will the arrive at work (if they actually have to drive to work)?  \n\n*Will the PC that they use to create the ISO be in top shape?  \n\n*Will they just start working on the ISO or start playing video games?\n\n*Will they just start working on the ISO or start talking to some friends?\n\n*Will they stop playing and talking to some friends and start working on the ISO?\n\n*Will the connection to the internet be available when they arrive?  \n\n*Will the ISO making software work correctly?  \n\n*Do devs need to go to the bathroom when making an ISO image release of the latest Ubuntu?  \n\n*Do devs read this crazy answer and think what the hell is wrong with this guy, thus affecting the speed at which they can create the ISO?  \n\n\nAll of this questions can have an affect of the time at which Ubuntu 11.10 will be released. We all know is tomorrow but at what time depends on too many factors (getting on time, devs talking to some friends about making the ISO, playing tetris, etc..)\nIts not like they will be drunk and playing with \"super maria\" when making 11.10.. like last time: On what specific time are ubuntu versions made public?\n\nA: We won't know till they release it... but probably not till the afternoon if their history is anything to follow... but with this release they haven't exactly followed the beaten path... so it is anyones guess...\n", "Q: Invoke a wine installed application from command line I have installed DivX player using wine in my ubuntu. I would like to invoke the player from terminal. Is it possible? If yes, how?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: If you are using wine installed from the repositories then wine related files is stored in a folder called ~/.wine\nWindows programs are stored within this folder - for example ~/.wine/drive_c/program_files/Internet Explorer\nYou can start a windows program in a similar way as from a command line in windows but prefix it with wine\nfor example\nwine \"c:\\program files\\internet explorer\\iexplore.exe\"\n\nThus if your divx called (for example) divxplayer.exe is installed - for example in ~/.wine/drive_c/program files/divx\nthen you can start your wine divx player\nwine \"c:\\program files\\divx\\divxplayer.exe\"\n\n", "Q: How to access other partitions/disks? There was an icon called \"My Computer\" to Ubuntu 11.04 that allowed access to all available disks and partitions.\nHowever, I could not find anything similar in Ubuntu 11.10.\nAnyone know if this feature was removed?\n\nA: The 'computer:///' location still works in 11.10, but apparently, the button has been removed. Hit ctrl+l to show the location bar in Nautilus, type in 'computer:///' and bookmark it.\nAll available partitions should also show in the left side panel.\n\nA: you can check all partitions by running\nsudo blkid -c /dev/null\n\ncd /media\nsudo mkdir drive1\n\nNow you can mount\nsudo mount.ntfs-3g /dev/sda1 /media/drive1\n\n", "Q: Can I ssh (into a mobile device) via USB? I have a tablet with a USB connection to a host computer. (Ideally the host is running Windows, but if absolutely necessary I could switch the host to be Ubuntu also.)\nI want to be able to SSH into the device without RS-232, WiFi, or other network connection. What software combination and setup do I need to make this happen?\nBasically, I'd love the be able to have the equivalent of adb shell, but for when the tablet is running pure Ubuntu, not Android.\nThe tablet happens to be running 9.04, but I'd be happy to upgrade it if required.\n\nA: So, to clarify, you want to connect to your tablet(running Ubuntu) from your PC (running Windows, but could run Ubuntu if it had to) by ssh over a USB connection?\nI haven't heard of doing this before but google searches for things like \"ssh over USB\" let to many hits where people were showing how to connect a jailbroker iphone with OpenSSH installed to a Windows PC using WinSCP or Putty. Here are some links:\niFans - SSH via USB with WinSCP \nOpenSSH, USB instead of WiFi\nThe Ubuntu tablet could easily replace the iphone because it has OpenSSH on it already but I don't know too much about tunneling a SSH connection to USB, except that SSH uses port 22. These two tutorials use a program called itunnel but I don't know anything about it. I went to itunnel's site and it said \"iTunnel is a simple Linux command line program which provides SSH tunnelling over the USB cable to a jailbroken iPhone. I wrote this little tool because I got tired of having to SSH into my iPhone over the WiFi link. SSH proxy, ssh link, and scp all work great.\" Because it says \"simple Linux command line program\", I think it is at least worth investigating to see if it will work.\nThis is an interesting prospect and I would like to see where it goes, but I feel connecting through USB makes this considerably more work than it needs to be. I have used the android app Proxoid to connect my phone to my laptop for tethered wireless connections using the ./adb forward tcp:8080 tcp:8080 command but the tunneled connection required me to set the proxy on my browser before I could get online. Tunneling your SSH connection to USB might make it hard for your applications to connect without some extensive messing around with options.\nIf you have an old router lying around (like a Linksys wireless B or G router) you could just connect the Tablet and PC together using that and SSH into the Tablet without messing around with tunneling.\n\nA: Just in case you would want to ssh into Android:\nDownload a cyanogenmod 7 rom and extract dropbear, dropbearkey and dropbearconvert from the /system/xbin/ directory.

Formatting your usb drive in ext3 or ntfs format will solve speed problem. But if you connect your ext3 formatted USB drive in another computer running windows, it will not work.\n\nA: It is not a answer, and maybe is unrelated, but cheap USB Sticks are slow to write. When the OS is copying to the USB devices it starts fast because it is using main memory as a kind of write cache, but when it runs out of cache the speed decreases enormously.\nMaybe, when its stop at 0s, the USB is still dumping all the cached data that it was not transfered yet.\nExternals Hard Disk are usually faster and have a internal cache too, so this effect is not as appreciable as with usb memory.\n", "Q: Should I install 11.10 daily release now or rather wait? \nPossible Duplicate:\nIs there a rational reason to wait for the release date to download, install or update to the next version of Ubuntu? \n\nShould I install ubuntu 11.10 now or is better choice wait to official relase? I know that update should be possible after that but I'm afraid that I will have unnecessary files on my computer from beta version (so, bad windows experiences :) upgrade in windows is always horror). Thank you very much.\n\nA: You can do either. Both installs are very similar (I haven't had any problems with the beta) and you will just pick up any remaining updates with your next update.

I like having a live cd to boot from (i'm presuming you can upgrade from 11.04 to 11.10 from the live cd) in case of any problems, as i'm a bit of a fiddler, so i'd like to know if direct download (ubuntu.com, mirror) or a torrent would be the fastest way on day one?\nI know this is probably subjective, depending on how many people are doing each, but really i'm worried about the stability of a large download. I'd like it done faster, but if direct is likely to slow down or have an error i'll torrent.\nDid the network have any errors during downloads on the release of 11.04?\n\nA: Usually torrents are the best way, as mirrors always see a huge bandwidth spike on release day. Another good way to have an up to date system on release day is install the release candidate and allow it to update on its own. The servers will be less congested, and the differences will be minimal.\nOf course, torrenting allows you to give back to the community as well :)\n", "Q: No Bluetooth adapter is present I've a Sony Vaio VPCEH1S0E and I've got a problem with Bluetooth.\nMy Bluetooth applet is running but there's no way to configure my Bluetooth device because Ubuntu says that \"no adapter is present\".\nThis is the output of rfkill list:\n0: phy0: Wireless LAN\n    Soft blocked: no\n    Hard blocked: no\n1: sony-wifi: Wireless LAN\n    Soft blocked: no\n    Hard blocked: no\n2: sony-bluetooth: Bluetooth\n    Soft blocked: no\n    Hard blocked: no\n3: hci0: Bluetooth\n    Soft blocked: no\n    Hard blocked: no\n\n\nThis is the output of hcitool dev:\nDevices:\n\n\nThis is the output of dmesg | tail after I've turned on Bluetooth:\n[ 1590.367523] hci_cmd_timer: hci0 command tx timeout\n[ 1591.367014] hci_cmd_timer: hci0 command tx timeout\n[ 1592.366483] hci_cmd_timer: hci0 command tx timeout\n[ 1593.365992] hci_cmd_timer: hci0 command tx timeout\n\n\nAnd finally this is the output of lsmod:\nbluetooth             166112  13 bnep,rfcomm,btusb\n\nSo what can I do to find my Bluetooth adapter?\n\nA: I am also using VPCEH Sony VAIO and I got both bluetooth and Wifi working simultaneously.

I recently upgraded my CPU from an Athlon II X2 250 to the Athlon II X4 610E(45W 4 cores -- can't beat the efficiency).  Is an ubuntu reinstall required? \n\nA: You do not need to reinstall Ubuntu for new hardware being recognized. Just boot up after plugging the power on it and you're ready to go.\n\nA: The ability to use multiple cores depends on the kernel and if it was compiled with the SMP feature (Symmetric Multi Processing).  (Ubuntu overview of SMP)  Since your last CPU was a dual core, it probably had the SMP kernel installed.  Your new quad core will also use the same SMP kernel.  (The SMP kernel will automatically adjust for the number of cores each time it is booted.)\nTo confirm that the kernel is able to see all four cores, check the /proc/cpuinfo file.  For instance, a quad-core cpu should have four core lines:\ndan@titan:~$ grep ^core /proc/cpuinfo\ncore id             : 0\ncore id             : 1\ncore id             : 2\ncore id             : 3\n\n\nA: In general the nature of Linux is such that it starts each time as if it is loading on a fresh system (to put it simply). Unless you do something such as putting your hard drive in a new system you won't have to do a thing.\n\nA: You shouldn't need to reinstall, Ubuntu is very, very accepting of hardware changes. \nA good example of this was I have a Dell Latitude here that has a core two duo p9700 processor, nVidia Quadro graphics, two gigabytes of ram. That recently failed (my own fault) so to transfer the files off of the hard disk within it I put the hard disk into my other laptop, which is a Compaq Presario which has a Pentium dual core processor, three gb of ram, Intel graphics, a very different system. To my surprise it booted up from the old install on my Latitude with absolutely no driver issues at all. I was absolutely amazed. After I figured this out I tested it by hooking the hard disk up to my Desktop computer which contains an AMD Sempron single core processor along with nVidia Gforce 9600gt graphics card and four gb  of ram and still it booted with absolutely no issues.\nThis has to be one of my favourite things about Ubuntu because it makes things so much easier.\n", "Q: Is Ubuntu One Files available for iPad client?

I'd like to set a couple of environment variables (at boot time) on an Ubuntu machine (10.04), but I want to create their value via a script, much like:\nexport THE_ENV_VAR=$(script_to_execute_and_use_stdout_from)\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The reason I want to do this is that the commands used to set the environment variables take long time to execute (10s or so), so that's why I only want to do it once after boot. Anyway, currently I solved this by caching the result of the command at boot time, so that subsequent calls will go fast, thus not using env. variables at all.\n\n\nI've tried setting in /etc/environment, but that only copies rhs verbatim\nI've tried executing a script in /etc/init.d/ at startup, but that does not seem to work.\nIdeas?\n\nA: Put that in ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bashrc\ngedit ~/.bashrc\n\nUse .bash_profile if you need to use those variable with non-interactive shells (scripts) and ~/.bashrc if you are setting your variables in a shell.\nIf that does not work, we need more details, in particular what variables are you setting and for what purpose ?\n\nA: To set system-wide environmental variables that are available on boot you place them in /etc/environment.\nThis file is not a script file, but rather consists of assignment expressions, one per line. Like this:\nSYSTEM_FOO=barnone\n\nNote: Variable expansion does not work in /etc/environment.\nOriginal information from help.ubuntu.com\n\nA: While this isn't likely a good practice, you can specify environment variables as kernel parameters. The Linux kernel documentation has some good information around it (important paragraph bolded):\n\nThe argument list\nThe kernel command line is parsed into a list of\nstrings (boot  arguments) separated by spaces.  Most of the boot\narguments have the  form:\n name[=value_1][,value_2]...[,value_10]\n\nwhere 'name' is a unique keyword that is used to identify what part\nof the kernel the associated values (if any) are to be given to.  Note\nthe limit of 10 is real, as the present code handles only 10  comma\nseparated parameters per keyword.  (However, you can reuse the  same\nkeyword with up to an additional 10 parameters in unusually complicated situations, > assuming the setup function supports it.)\nMost of the sorting is coded in the kernel source file init/main.c.\nFirst, the kernel checks to see if the argument is any of the special\narguments 'root=', 'nfsroot=', 'nfsaddrs=', 'ro', 'rw', 'debug' or\n'init'.  The meaning of these special arguments is described below.\nThen it walks a list of setup functions to see if the specified argument string\n(such as 'foo') has been associated with a setup function\n('foo_setup()') for a particular device or part of the kernel.  If\nyou passed the kernel the line foo=3,4,5,6 then the kernel would\nsearch the bootsetups array to see if 'foo' was registered.  If it\nwas, then it would call the setup function associated with 'foo'\n(foo_setup()) and hand it the arguments 3, 4, 5, and 6 as given on\nthe kernel command line.\nAnything of the form 'foo=bar' that is not accepted as a setup function as\ndescribed above is then interpreted as an environment variable to be set.\nA (useless?) example would be to use 'TERM=vt100' as\na boot argument.\nAny remaining arguments that were not picked up by the kernel and\nwere not interpreted as environment variables are then passed onto\nPID 1, which is usually the init(1) program.  The most common argument\nthat is passed to the init process is the word 'single' which\ninstructs it to boot the computer in single user mode, and not launch\nall the usual daemons.  Check the manual page for the version of\ninit(1) installed on your system to see what arguments it accepts.\n\nThis AskUbuntu answer has some good instructions on how to modify your kernel boot parameters.\n\nA: Put your commands into /etc/rc.local. Make sure to read the comments at the head.\n", "Q: Apple Magic mouse/ Apple Magic Trackpad /Bring up all windows gesture Hello everyone my question is. Is it possible for the magic mouse to have different gesture other than the scroll wheel gesture. I wanted to do the bring up all windows gesture or the super + W gesture. Do you guys know if the mouse is going to have better support in ubuntu 11.10? Is there any software that can enable me to do different gestures with the mouse just like how it works in os x ?\nTrackpad question\nI been trying to configure magic trackpad also with touchegg, but touchegg is not working for me. What do I do help me out guys!!! I don't if I did the installation wrong or what. I'm running ubuntu 11.04.\nHow do I disable the unity gestures to allow touchegg to run.\n\n\n*\n\n*I think I found the answer to my problem. I think I'm using the wrong gui with the wrong version. Currently I have vr.1 and running the 0.3 gui, which is not working at all. I check the touchegg forums and it seem like jose the guy that created the program is working on the vr.1 GUI.\n\n\nA: The following works for me in Ubuntu 11.10:\nYou should be able to do a 4-finger tap to bring up the Dash, and do a four-finger swipe to hide & unhide the Launcher.\nA three finger drag on a non-maximised window moves the window around, and brings up resize handles.\nAs far as I'm aware this is the current set of gestures supported by Unity.  Unity also claims all four-finger gestures (and I think it also claims three-finger gestures), so while Unity is running no other app will be able to provide those gestures.\n\nA: Unity 11.10 also support three finger pinch to maximize/restore the window.\n", "Q: Headphone output is far too loud I am using Ubuntu 11.10 (Oneiric Ocelot), with a \"Intel Corporation 82801G (ICH7 Family) AC'97 Audio Controller (rev 01)\" sound card.\nWhen I plug headphones into the front headphone port, the sound that comes out is far too loud to listen to - and has to be turned down to about 5%. Anything above that is distorted and deafening.\nI have played around in Alsamixer, and whilst a decent level can be achieved (through changing three separate sliders), this is not ideal for changing the volume on my parents' computer. And using the standard volume control overrides all of that anyway.\n\nA: None of the above works for me even after searching solution for hours.\nFor me, I just had to change my sound card, and there, I find it exactly what I want.\nThe steps which I followed were:\n\n*\n\n*Type alsamixer in terminal and hit enter\n\n*Press F6 and choose your sound card (I selected USB PnP Sound Device as I was using USB headphones) and press Enter\n\n*Here you'll find the volume bars, adjust the one for your USB headphone so it is not too loud.\n\n\nA: I solved this using sound settings in system settings. On the bottom of the screen, to the left of the \"Test Speakers\" button is a drop-down labeled \"Profile:\". I changed it to \"High Fidelity Playback (A2DP Sink)\" from \"Headset Head Unit (HSP/HFP)\". And now I can turn the volume down more.\nEditing /usr/share/pulseaudio/alsa-mixer/paths/analog-output.conf.common\nand /etc/pulse/default.pa did not work for me, as some other answers suggested. My problem remained after changing these configs.\nThe original problem I was experiencing: the sound in my bluetooth headphones would sound bearably quiet but then within a second of playing a video it would gradually increase. This was at the lowest system volume setting - one more keyboard button press to lower the volume would mute the headphones.\n\nA: I experienced the same problem and I have written a post about the solution I found here. Basically what I did was this:\nOpen the file /etc/pulse/default.pa by typing the following in a terminal:\ngksudo gedit /etc/pulse/default.pa\n\nChange the line that says\nload-module module-udev-detect\n\ninto\nload-module module-udev-detect ignore_dB=1\n\nSave and close the file.\nRestart pulseaudio by typing the following in a terminal:\npulseaudio -k\n\nNow open alsamixer:\nalsamixer\n\nThen lower the PCM volume to a decent level (I set mine to about 50 %). After doing this, changing the volume using the volume keys or volume slider won't reset the settings for PCM in alsamixer and will let you keep the lowest threshold of the volume a as low as you'd like. This will also keep the volume intervals smaller. The only negative effect is that you won't get as much sound out of your speakers without headphones unless you change back the PCM settings in alsamixer again.\nI can't guarantee that this will work on your system, but it did work nicely on mine.\n\nA: None of the solutions worked for me.\nHere's what got my issue solved:\nEdit /usr/share/pulseaudio/alsa-mixer/paths/analog-output.conf.common\nsudo vim /usr/share/pulseaudio/alsa-mixer/paths/analog-output.conf.common\n\nChange:\n[Element PCM]\nswitch = mute\nvolume = merge\noverride-map.1 = all \noverride-map.2 = all-left,all-right\n\nTo:\n[Element PCM]\nswitch = mute\nvolume = ignore\nvolume-limit = 0.01\noverride-map.1 = all \noverride-map.2 = all-left,all-right\n\nAdjust volume-limit so that it fits your headphones volume range. In my case 0.01 was good.\nRestart pulseaudio: pulseaudio -k or reboot sudo reboot\nFull credits to this site. https://chrisjean.com/fix-for-usb-audio-is-too-loud-and-mutes-at-low-volume-in-ubuntu/\nUPDATE:\nThe above solution overwrites all sound outputs. Hence, lowering your speakers volume limit too.\nIn order to lower only headphones max, set the above config into the [Option Analog Output:Headphones] section (same analog-output.conf.common).\nBefore:\n[Option Analog Output:Headphones]\nname = output-headphones\npriority = 9\n\nAfter:\n[Option Analog Output:Headphones]\nname = output-headphones\npriority = 9\nvolume = ignore\nvolume-limit = 0.0\n\n\nA: With most soundcards there are different mixer channels which amplify themselves. You can try to turn down the headphone output so that you can regulate the volume with the master mixer more accurate. It may be, that you have to install the pavucontrol package by typing sudo apt-get install pavucontrol. At least I hope that the gnome3-developers kept this options in their sound-setting tools ;)\n", "Q: Central data storage for apps in Software Center I am trying to make a package for the Software Center, but so far the problem is that there seems to be no central place to store data for all users.\nWe need that to store license files that the application can later add if the users want to use the non-free parts of our software. Also we use this for storing document templates that some users edit and make them available for all users on the system.\nIs there any solution for this kind of problems? From what I see on this page:\nhttp://developer.ubuntu.com/publish/\n\nWrite all configuration settings to ~/.<pkgName>\n  (This can be one file or a directory containing multiple configuration files.)\n\nEDIT: While talking to the Ubuntu staff it turns out there is no way you can have a central file storage for all users. At least not at the moment. I tried adding scripts to the debian source package that would create folders, but the staff looked at them and did not approve the version. At the moment we are saving the common files in the user .config folder.\n\nA: For licenses, you will want to use the license key mechanism built into Oneiric and the http://myapps.developer.ubuntu.com application submission portal.\nI think you answered your own question as you want to store user space configuration settings to ~/.<somedir> or ~/.config/<somedir> - following the XDG standards would be suggested.\n\nA: You could provide a full debian package instead of a zip for installation under /opt/.\nDuring your .deb installation, you can create a folder /usr/lib/<appname>/templates and make it world writable, like putting a chmod o+w /usr/lib/<appname>/templates in your <appname>.postinst script.\n", "Q: Radeon HD 6950 temperature is way too hot I'm using Ubuntu 11.10 with the default video driver because with the proprietary one the animations/window moving/video play is laggy and slow. With the default driver everything is fine except that after a while there is a strange graphic glitch and the card itself is burning. I don't know the exact temperature but if I touch the card while using Windows it's normal but when I use Ubuntu it's burning (without any stress in both cases).\n\nA: I have here a rather old Thinkpad with a Mobility Radeon HD 3400 series card, having  similar problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*The closed-source fglrx driver is almost unusable, due to flickering, glitches, etc with gnome-shell.\n\n*The open-source radeon driver is working very nice, but the card gets too hot. Checking using cat /proc/acpi/ibm/thermal shows that the card heats up to > 90°C.\nMy solution:\n- Use the open-source radeon-driver (accodring to the man-page your card is supported) and manually clock down the card: If it is not installed already, install it, the package is named 'xserver-xorg-video-radeon':\naptitude install xserver-xorg-video-radeon\n\nPurge fglrx:\naptitude purge fgrlx\n\nOn the next start, X will automagically use the radeon driver. You can check this using 'lsmod | grep radon', you should see something like this:\nroot@XERXES3:~# lsmod | grep radeon\nradeon               1015995  3 \nttm                    76805  1 radeon\ndrm_kms_helper         42558  1 radeon\ndrm                   236330  5 radeon,ttm,drm_kms_helper\ni2c_algo_bit           13423  1 radeon\n\nensure that the fglrx driver is not loaded, 'lsmod | grep fglrx' should produce no output.\nCheck if your card is running at the highest speed too: 'cat /sys/kernel/debug/dri/0/radeon_pm_info' shows you the clock-speed of your card\nroot@XERXES3:~# cat /sys/kernel/debug/dri/0/radeon_pm_info \ndefault engine clock: 680000 kHz\ncurrent engine clock: 675000 kHz\ndefault memory clock: 800000 kHz\ncurrent memory clock: 792000 kHz\nvoltage: 1200 mV\nPCIE lanes: 16\n\nSet the power-profile to something more reasonable: \necho \"mid\" > /sys/class/drm/card0/device/power_profile\n\nNow check again the clock-speed of your card:\nroot@XERXES3:~# cat /sys/kernel/debug/dri/0/radeon_pm_info \ndefault engine clock: 680000 kHz\ncurrent engine clock: 297000 kHz\ndefault memory clock: 800000 kHz\ncurrent memory clock: 405000 kHz\nvoltage: 900 mV\nPCIE lanes: 16\n\nIt should show reduced clock-speeds and voltage.\nThat did the job for me.

You might also be interested in this bug-report:\nhttp://ati.cchtml.com/show_bug.cgi?id=99\nIt seems like ATI is having serious problems in providing a decent working linux-driver.\nAlso note, that this problem of \"Radeon driver is clocking the card too hot\" started to appear on my system with the introduction of KMS. It seems like the card is never switched to a reasonable power-profile, even if it is getting too hot.\nBefore KMS, I was able to use in Xorg.conf the options \"dynamic clocks on\" (or similar) and the card adjusted its speed properly.\nATM I'm just setting the power-profile to \"mid\" each time after booting (a script could do the job).\nHope this helps, cheers\nNote, I forgot to mention one thing: If you have a system with switchable graphics (in my case a thinkpad T400 with a ati card and a ibm gfx-chip), you need to disable the 'switchable graphics' in the bios and manually set in the bios which card to use (Discrete graphics in my case to use the ati-card). If not, it might happen that both cards are \"powered-up\" and are running at top-speed, producing heat.

I would like to voice/video chat with google talk contacts in empathy, but the options are disabled.  The help page indicates that this may be due to missing plugins.  What plugins must I install to get this working?\n\nA: For what I have read and tested here you only need Empathy and to login with a google account. The other user also has to have a google account to make this work.\nIn the Empathy webpage it says that it supports this features: http://live.gnome.org/Empathy\nI would mention the google-talk plugin but thats a browser plugin to use the gtalk features inside the browser.\nWhen you have both users using a google account, the option to Audio Call will be highlighted when you right click the user in the Contact List window.\nNow to be fair, this was not the case almost a year ago. Back then Empathy did not support this feature. Now you can use Empathy to call a user inside the browser, for example if he or she is using gmail at the moment and has the chat activated.\nFor now the problem I find is trying to call Empathy from the gmail webpage. It only works from Empathy to Gmail but not the other way around. With the many updates made to Empathy since the last version in Ubuntu 10.04 (Which is the 2.34) am thinking this \"bug\" might be corrected.

See the vim man page for many more options.\n\nA: Another approach is to specify an extra source file just for mutt with vim's -S cli flag:\nHere is the value of editor in my .muttrc:\nset editor=\"vim -S ~/.mutt/vimrc\"\n\nAnd then here is my ~/.mutt/vimrc:\nset textwidth=0\nset wrapmargin=0\n\n\nA: Try settings the textwidth to 0:\n; ~/.vimrc\n:set textwidth=0\n:set wrapmargin=0\n\n\nA: With after/ftplugin/mail.vim\nUsing Hamish Downer's solution for a long time in Neovim, I noticed today that the text width gets reset after opening a buffer (another file where I keep email addresses, in my case) in the same window.\nI think the reason is that the default file type plugin at /usr/share/nvim/runtime/ftplugin/mail.vim is loaded, which sets the text width to 72:\n\" Part of /usr/share/nvim/runtime/ftplugin/mail.vim\n\n\" many people recommend keeping e-mail messages 72 chars wide\nif &tw == 0\n  setlocal tw=72\nendif\n\nTo solve this, I removed the line set editor=\"vim +':set textwidth=0' +':set wrapmargin=0' +':set wrap'\" from my muttrc and instead created a custom file type plugin at ~/.config/nvim/after/ftplugin/mail.vim consisting only of this line:\nsetlocal textwidth=0\n\nGenerally, the files in after/ftplugin/ are sourced after the configurations in /usr/share/nvim/runtime/fpgplugin, effectively overriding them.\nI find this also a bit cleaner than the set editor= method and it has the upshot that Neovim will use this config for all files of type mail. This makes for consistent settings when writing mails with other clients than Mutt.\nAlso, I can now have the configuration on multiple lines and add comments:\n\" Contents of ~/.config/nvim/after/ftplugin/mail.vim\n\nsetlocal textwidth=0\n\" Jump over first paragraph (useful when muttrc contains set edit_headers)\nnormal! }\n\n", "Q: iwl3945 vs. iwlwifi, what are the differences? Is there a different Wifi driver to try or do I have the 'best' one already?\nI have a stock installation of Ubuntu Natty (11.04) on a HP Laptop with this \nNetwork controller: Intel Corporation PRO/Wireless 3945ABG [Golan] Network Connection (rev 02)\nlsmod | grep iwl shows:\niwl3945               126017  0 \niwlcore               148964  1 iwl3945\nmac80211              257001  2 iwl3945,iwlcore\ncfg80211              156212  3 iwl3945,iwlcore,mac80211\n\nI've read about a driver from Intel called iwlwifi.

My wifi works fine, but I'm trying to see if there is anyway to lower it's power consumption.  powertop shows iwl3945 always at #2 with ~30%.\n\nA: The iwl3945 module is a driver from the iwlwifi project.  The other drivers from the project are iwl4965 and iwlagn, which target different generations of the Intel Wifi hardware.\nThere was an older driver available for your card by the name ipw3945, but Ubuntu hasn't shipped with a kernel that featured the driver for some time (it was superseded by the newer iwlwifi drivers).\n", "Q: How to show java plugin console In windows, when I open a web page containing applet, icon of java plugin console is displayed in systray. But in Ubuntu, I don't find any way to show java plugin console. How can I open java plugin console with FireFox and Chromium in Ubuntu?\n\nA: If you don't have the dash interface (for example if you use Kubuntu, Lubuntu, etc), an alternative method is:\n1) Open Terminal and type:\nupdate-alternatives --display java\n\n2) Change Directory to the last directory shown, for example:\ncd /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-oracle/jre/bin/\n\n3) Type:\n./ControlPanel\n\n\nA: It's because the Java Console is hidden by default.\nTo change this:\n\n\n*\n\n*First start the Java Control Panel.\nFrom the command line run: ControlPanel (if not in PATH, you may have to run something like /usr/lib/jvm/jre1.7.0_51/bin/ControlPanel )\nOr, choose from the Dash like the screenshot below\n\n\n*In the Java Control Panel go to the Advanced Tab, expand Java Console and choose Show Console.

The best you can do then is ensure that you configure everything around it to be optimal for its performance.\nSome tips:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ensure that you are using the latest/best driver for your graphics (chip/card).\n\n*Do not run too many intense applications at a time. Even background applications can affect the speed of a system.\n\n*Do not use too many extensions at a time.\n\n*Make good use of workspaces. 3D window managers have a lot of work to do already, so its good to have fewer windows \"active\" at a time.\n\n*Ensure that your graphics applications are configured correctly if they support it.\n\n*\n\n*For example, in games, you can turn down the graphics if possible.\n\n*Use programs like Blender in fullscreen mode.\n\n*If you can, use texture compression (your system must support it).\n\n\n", "Q: Installing GNU arm Toolchain? Please, do tell me the procedure to compile and install the GNU arm Toolchain \"arm-2010q1-202-arm-none-linux-gnueabi\" which I downloaded from codesourcey website. \nI could not find the deb packages.\n\nA: You probably downloaded a .tar.gz file, which contains the compiled toolchain. In this case, just do something like:\ntar xvf arm-2010q1-202-arm-none-linux-gnueabi.tar.gz\n\nThen you should have an arm-2010q1 (or similar) directory. The actual toolchain executables are in the bin subdirectory.\nHowever, if you're looking for an ARM cross-compiler, there is one pre-packaged in Ubuntu, which may be easier to get running.

I noticed that, when I unplugged my laptop, or closed/opened the lid, my wireless connection dropped, every time.\nI tracked it down to pm-powersave, and made it stop, see below.\nThis could also cause repeated requests for network passwords.\n\nA: I've found that /usr/sbin/pm-powersave turns OFF my wireless card when I switch to battery or suspend by closing the laptop's lid. I've gotten wireless to stay up between hibernates by executing sudo /usr/sbin/pm-powersave false.

How do I do that (with NVIDIA drivers)? I am coming from Bug # 868950 on launchpad, a kernel related problem. To analyse the problem a bit deeper and see where it comes from, I was told to try out a mainline kernel to see if the problem persists.\nIt would be great if the person to answer this question could post a step-by-step guide on what to do. It would also be nice to explain why this is required and how exactly this helps the developers. I couldn't find any proper documentation on this for newbies. I'm sure this way more people will find themselves able to help out and we'll eventually do the devs a favor.\nNote that I have to use NVIDIA drivers.\n\nA: Mainline kernels are compiled from recent sources using the Ubuntu configuration, so any bugfixes will first appear in the mainline kernel. Since the kernel package receives a lot of bug reports, the developer team cannot spend a lot time on all bug reports. Your reported bug may be fixed before, so that's why they tell you to test it with the most recent kernel.\nTo install a mainline kernel:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find the latest kernel on http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/?C=M;O=D. At the moment, it's http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v3.1-rc9-oneiric/\n\n*Create a new directory for saving the downloaded kernel packages (e.g. ~/kernel-test)\n\n*Download the linux-headers*_amd64.deb, linux-headers*_all.deb and linux-image*_amd64.deb files.   Replace amd64 by i386 if you're running a 32-bit OS, and pick the \"pae\" version if you want it.  You can check if you're running pae now by looking in /proc/cpuinfo.\n\n*Open a terminal and install the downloaded kernel packages:\nsudo dpkg -i ~/kernel-test/*.deb\n\n\n*Reboot and the new kernel will automatically be selected. If it won't boot, either try pressing Ctrl + Alt + Del or using the power button. The next boot, the menu will appear. If not, hold Shift after the BIOS POST.\n\n\nTo uninstall the mainline kernel, simply uninstall the related packages:\nsudo apt-get purge linux-headers-3*-generic linux-image-3*-generic\n\nReplace * by the package names of the mainline kernels. It matches the file you've downloaded.\nBe aware that the mainline builds are compiled with an older toolset which has some side-effects like being unable to unload kernel modules after loading them (this applies to DKMS packages like nvidia-current)\n", "Q: NAS device for Ubuntu Fellows,\nI would like to know if you use, how you use and which device as Network Attached Storage. I've being reading some reviews online, and there is a lot off downsides in many models - more recently, the ones from IOCELL.\nSome of then need special software to be accessed, some of then are too warm, and so on. There is any one quite famous for linux users? I was expecting to connect one of those things in my wireless router (with cable) and, and when it get on it would be mounted like a pendrive in the network... I really have no idea :(\nThanks!\nPedro\n\nA: One of the systems that supports CIFS and NFS perfectly (and I currently own one) is Synology.\nJust works, no complaints.\nAny other NAS that supports either CIFS or NFS will work because you can mount any of these protocols in Ubuntu without any problems.\nOne word of advice I have is to just check the website forums page of the brands you are interested and have a look for any NFS or CIFS complaints users are posting there.\nie: Synology had a problem with CIFS low transfer rates that was fixed 2 versions of the software ago, you can read about all the complaints on their forum. Its fixed now.\nTo use a NAS on your network cannot be more simple:\n1) Plugin the NAS to your router, it will probably be setup to look for IP addresses by it self\n2) Create users and shared folders on the NAS using the NAS interface (much likely a HTTP page)\n3) In your Ubuntu system install the required protocol files (CIFS or NFS)\n4) Modify your fstab file (`/etc/fstab') to mount the shared folders you just created automatic on each startup, instructions for that normally can be found on your NAS website support pages.\nThats all! Its that simple. Gl and if you need any further assistance on this just ask ;)\n\nA: I've been using my NetGear ReadyNAS for a couple of years now. It supports CIFS, NFS, SMB, WebDav and a bunch of other protocols. You can think of it as a mini linux server that sits on the network and just happens to have a massive redundant hard drive. The newer versions of the ReadyNAS can do just about anything that a normal webserver can do via add-ons.\n\nA: I think you need to decide how much you want to spend first. Then think a bit about things like scalability, and the cost of the power consumption (10W standby equates to $10/year).\nMost of these boxes seem to run linux underneath, so maybe you want to check how easy it it to extend the feature set (even if only as a view into the level of support that is available)\nI went for a fairly high end home device, Qnap TS-219P II, this has 512M Ram, 2GHz processor, and is apparently able to run a Myth-tv backend. Certainly it should be able to cope with waking up my main machine to do recording, or any other always on task I need. \nThe IOCELL range don't disclose their hardware spec, and also appear to use a non-linux OS on the NAS - at least they don't seem to support NFS, so even if they are PnP on other OS, for linux it may not be a good option.\n", "Q: Why doesn't Canonical have a store in India?

Now that China has Ubuntu stores, everyone else wants them. Opening up stores takes time, and canonical has to decide where they want to put they're money to make a store. They'll build stores wherever the most loyal Ubuntu users are - and if that's in India, then so be it. You should contribute to the thread on Ubuntu brainstorm.

Instead of the popup window which asks what file to open (which showed in the activity bar, but weren't visible on the screen), on the workspaces symbol, there would light up half a workspace. It looks like something covers 1,5 workspace. When I try to go to workspace 2, half of workspace 1 is visible, and the rest of the screen is disturbed.\nI have tried rebooting, turning off the computer completely, getting rid of LibreOffice and then re-installing it again, and opening several different files. Nothing makes the problem go away. Sometimes the graphics become weird (one version on top of another repeated times), and sometimes nothing happens for a very long time, except a random scroll down bar appear at a random place.\nI have tried to take screenshots of some of the problems, to cover most of the problems, so there's nothing wrong with the underlying processor, but there seems to be something wrong with the graphics.\nAny help is greatly appreciated.\n\nA: This is rather embarrassing, but after I thought I had checked everything, it turned out there was one thing I hadn't checked: one cable needed to be jiggled a little. Now things work as good as new. Thanks anyway.\n", "Q: Is it possible to switch between headphones and speakers? Is it possible to switch between headphones and speakers by software control? I'm disabled, and plugging and unplugging my headphones is rather difficult for me. I'd rather just press a button and find sound output switched to another output device, is this possible?\n\nA: If they are on two different interfaces, this should work. Then you can go into the sound settings and select your output hardware.\nIn case they are the same interface, like plugging in the headphones disables the speakers, this will probably not work. You could buy something like this cinch switch then, though. Or you buy a little USB sound card in order to have two interfaces to use solution 1.\n\nA: Yes it is possible to do that only if you have 2 sound cards, then you can configure your software output to do that. You can find USB based external sound card that supports ubuntu. \nHowever since you mentioned you were disabled and finding it difficult to move around each time, i would advice you to consider to use a 'Y audio splitter' aka 'headphone audio splitter', they can be found for very low cost (compared to an external sound card).\nI am presuming that your speakers and headphones have on/off controls and you can access those buttons easily. This is how the splitter looks, some brands have individual volume control as well.\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Maxell-HP-20-Headphone-Extension-Adapters/dp/B00004Z0C7/ref=sr_1_2?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1318511069&sr=1-2\nhttp://www.amazon.com/MP-7116-Headphone-Splitter-Separate/dp/B0016CFZQ0/ref=sr_1_2?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1318510831&sr=1-2 \nIf you dont have access to ON/OFF & volume controls on your speaker & headphones, You can use both of them in combination to suit your needs. You could also use this in combination to a cinch switch as well.  \nI know that this is not the exact answer to your question, but i hope it solves your problem. \n", "Q: Always a 'Network error' on mobile in Ubuntu One Music I'm using Ubuntu One in Android 2.3.

I have a LAMP web-server on Ubuntu 11.10, working perfectly. But now I want to develop my website from a Windows 7 system in the same network. \nI want to set up an FTP connection to Ubuntu so I can put files in directories of my web-server. But when I try to connect with FileZilla, it fails. What am I doing wrong? Do I need to install something extra with the LAMP configuration? \n\nA: Short answer: try sftp instead of ftp.\nMost likely, the problem is simply that you don't have an FTP service installed and configured. FTP service isn't installed by default on Ubuntu. I don't believe FTP service is considered part of the LAMP stack, and installing lamp-server via tasksel would not install FTP service.\nHowever, sftp,  secure ftp, is provided by sshd, the secure shell daemon, which I believe is installed by default. That works quite nicely for authenticated FTP, and you can configure it to use  public key authentication, which is both more secure and more convenient. Not all FTP clients support sftp, but most current ones do, including Filezilla (or lftp on the Linux command line). If you want to use public key encryption on Windows, you'll want to install PuTTY to generate the keys. PuTTY is very useful for administering a Linux box from Windows. See the Ubuntu official page for more on SSH keys. \nAlternately, if for instance you want to offer anonymous FTP as well as authenticated FTP, you could install and configure FTP service. vsftpd is quite good, and fairly easy to configure. See the official page on FTP servers.\n", "Q: Looking for console program to generate tones I've been googling for a while now and I can't find what I am looking for. \nI'm in the need of a console program that can play notes. \nExample:\nplay C C D D E E\n\nA: You can do this with the play command from the sox package, e.g.\nfor note in C C D D E E; \ndo \n    play -n -c1 synth 1 sine $note;\ndone\n\nwhich plays a 1-second sine wave for each of the notes in turn.\nThe man page for sox provides all of the options that can be used with the synth effect.

Every time I run Ubuntu on my Thinkpad the visual appearance of the system, desktop and applications does not look very crisp and the colors don't stand out.  When I load windows 7, graphics are much nicer, crisp, and colors pop.  Can I make Ubuntu have the same equivalent visual graphics that Windows 7 displays?  Or because this is Linux the graphics are not as good for the intel hd 3000 chip on Ubuntu?\nThe best way I can describe the difference is on Windows 7 there is no \"blur\" on the desktop icons, menus, menu icons, and pictures,text, menus, really pop.  On Ubuntu everything looks more dull and not \"high def\"\nFWIW, I installed 11.10 beta 2.  \n\nA: Both operating systems should be able to be as crisp as each other but without a visual comparison (could you take a couple of pictures?) it's hard to say exactly what the problem is.\nHowever there are two things that spring to mind:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you're not using the \"native\" resolution of a TFT/LCD screen that would cause everything to not be as crisp as it's supposed to be. I don't know what your native resolution is but the Windows display properties should give you a decent idea of what you're aiming for.\nWith that information you should be able to use the Monitors tool in Ubuntu and match that resolution. If the same resolution isn't available, there's an issue that we need to deal with. Let me know and I'll write a follow-up on that.\n\n*You might just have font-hinting turned off. Sub-pixel hinting allows TFT displays to display things a lot more accurately by blurring parts of fonts into nearby pixels. This sounds like it would result in something less crisp, but it's actually very pleasant.\nIn 11.04 and its predecessors you can get to these settings by right clicking the desktop and, clicking display properties, clicking the fonts tab and then checking Subpixel Smoothing under the rendering section.\nI have no idea how one does this in 11.10.\n", "Q: Remove aptitude's \"Press Enter To Continue\" after installations Whenever I install/update with the curses interface of aptitude, it keeps the log window open and asks you to press enter. Can I just let aptitude skip this and return to the main screen if nothing went wrong?\n\nA: Having a look at the source code this isn't an option.  \nIf you comment/remove lines 1218-1221 of src/ui.cc you can make it so, but if you think about it, I don't think you really want this behavior.  If it jumps straight back to the UI you have no chance to view the output and make sure there wasn't a problem installing/removing the package etc.\nEdit: just re-read your question and noticed you added the caveat to only do this if nothing went wrong.  In this case you should probably submit the idea to the aptitude mailing list and ask if they'd consider adding it as an option.\n", "Q: Auto convert odt to pdf I am creating a few documents in Libre office and I have to always send them as .pdf.\nbut each and every time I forget to export it as pdf , So is there any way to auto convert the .odt document into pdf every time I save the document ? \nI have only about 4 docs , I keep making changes on them , So each and every time I make a change and save the odt I need that change to be updated in the corresponding pdf file .\nPs : I understand that unoconv can be used to convert via command line but is there a way to automatically do it ?\nAnother Ps : I found out that there is something called inotify and inotify-tools and that can be used to trigger events when a file changes .

You can only skip releases when upgrading from LTS to LTS.\n\nA: To my memory you can upgrade from 10.04 to 11.10, but as psusi suggests, you should upgrade to 10.10 and then 11.04 first for best results.\n", "Q: Can I download the upgrade from 11.04 to 11.10 without installing it right away?

Due to the fact that it's designed for widescreen monitors.\nThanks!\n\nA: It isn't affected by that since the launcher is hidden. However, on a narrow screen (screen is tilted, so it becomes 1080x1920) it becomes needlessly long, just as it would be if it were flat in a wide screen setup. \nBut there are many other reasons to use Unity in any case. The keyboard support is awesome, for instance. So the answer to your question is that Unity is very useful on any screen that is at least 800x800. Smaller than that would be more difficult, I think, but that has more to do with Gnome than Unity. \nYou can add other panels and stuff if you like to, by the way. For instance, if you want a taskbar like Gnome 2 and Windows XP, then you can install http://apt.ubuntu.com/p/xfce4-panel. Afterwards, press alt+f2 and run xfce4-panel to start it.

There's no /opt/bin?\n\nA: /usr is world readable, so no, there will be no problem with other users being able to run the program.  /usr/local is where applications that you compile from source code yourself go.  Programs installed through the package manager go elsewhere.  I have never seen any purpose to /opt, and I believe it is just a carry over from the old AT&T Sys V days back in the '80s.\n\nA: Usually you should not have to try to install anything by hand. In almost all cases you will find a .deb package. If there isn't one, google for suggestions (like how to install Oracle JDK in Ubuntu). If this is your own software, check out the Ubuntu Packaging Guide for help on how to properly put stuff into Ubuntu.\nIf you must do it anyway, put the binary in /opt/myapp and link the executable with:\nln -s /opt/myapp/myappbinary /usr/local/bin/myappbinary\n\nIf you want to know more on the topic, type man hier in a terminal. The difference between /usr/bin and /usr/local/bin is explained there. In any case, both paths are in the $PATH environment variable. That means any binary you put there will be executable by anyone just by giving the name of the binary (and not the full path). So using the above example you can run your program with myappbinary instead of having to give the full path /opt/myapp/myappbinary.\n\nA: Depending on the linux-flavour, the preferred place to install something by hand might vary. If you do it by hand, do what the README suggests. \nIf you create a new user, and your old users hadn't to do anything to access the new program, the new users will not, too. \nHowever, you're free to create /opt/bin and include it into the path, but why should you?

Is this possible to do inside Wubi? Or do I have delete Wubi from Windows, therefore deleting my current Ubuntu installation; and then install 11.10 via the Wubi installer?\nThanks\n\nA: You can upgrade a Wubi install - the same way as a normal upgrade, either from the Update Manager or via the Alternate CD (while running your Wubi Ubuntu). Note that the alternate CD has been discontinued since release 12.10 so you have to use the Update Manager.\nI recommend that you check you have plenty of free space - at least 3GB - the upgrade underestimates the space it needs (bug report here).\nAlso, a quick and easy precaution is to backup the \\ubuntu\\disks\\root.disk from Windows before upgrading - that way, if it fails you can just copy over the root.disk from before the upgrade.\nNote that upgrading to 14.04 will require a manual workaround in order to boot.\n\nA: I don't think you can upgrade when you boot to the wubi install. You can try Alt+F2 then type update-manager -d but I recommend reading https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WubiGe\nI also suggest dual booting, however, if you plan on long-term use. Wubi is for evaluation and is known to run into issues down the road.\n\nA: I did the update, and it didn't work sadly.

I have no idea how to do this in Ubuntu.\n\nA: My problem with this new ubuntu 11.10 was the fact that i was not able to change the background color of the windows, that white color just drove me crazy; as you noticed 'appearance preferences' from the old ubuntu does not exit any more here; there is a way though (or maybe more):\nHere's what you have to do to change colors in ubuntu 11.10:\nOpen the terminal, paste \nsudo apt-get install dconf-tools\n\nthen \ndconf-editor\n\nBrowse to org.gnome.desktop.interface. \nLocate gtk-color-scheme, don't click on it, click on the empty space on the right side to get a small box where you will paste the following:  \nbg_color:#ebe0be;selected_bg_color:#737370;base_color:#9d906a \n\nPress enter, nothing else! The colors will change right away (this is just an example with my favourite colors). \n\n\nIf you wanna find your own colors, install gnome color chooser and play with the colors (the color palette will look the same as it did in 'appearance preferences in the old ubuntu) to find out the right codes (six digit hexadecimal numbers) for the ones that you like. \nOnce you find yours, paste the six digit code number into the right place in gtk-color-scheme and then enter again it is done.\n\nA: For 11.04 and older\nThe source of this answer is this article.\nChange Nautilus's Background\nMany people don't know that you can change Nautilus's background to add a beautiful touch to browsing files.\nTo change the background of a window, pane, or panel,  perform the following steps:\n1.Choose Edit ▸ Backgrounds and Emblems in any file manager window.

Including Natty I was always able to toggle (mute/unmute) the 'Master' sound volume with the\namixer sset Master toggle\ncommand that I linked to an edge binding in CompizConfig-Manager.\nNow after installing Oneiric the command only mutes the sound but doesn't unmute it. I even tried it in the Terminal but it also doesn't work. It changes 'Mono: Playback 68 [78%] [-14.25dB] [off]' to '...[on]' but the sound stays muted so that I have to unmute it via the 'sound-indicator' in the panel.\nHow can I get this working again? What did change since Natty? Does anyone know the command the 'sound-indicator' uses to toggle the sound volume?\n\nA: This works for me on 13.04, both mute and unmute:\namixer -D pulse set Master 1+ toggle\n\nIt specifies pulse audio to ensure unmute, unmutes everything.\n\nA: I couldn't get sound muting to toggle correctly. Whether I used CLI and type in Amixer sset Master toggle or hit the HP pavillion media toggle key, I get the same result: If sound is on and working, it will automatically turn off Master channel AND PCM channel. Then when I hit the toggle again (cli or key) it ALWAYS turns on Master, but leaves PCM muted. For my rig (HP Pavilion DV6 running Xubuntu Oneric), this means sound is off even with master on. When run from CLI - same results. If, with cli, I toggle PCM, it also turns off master channel and again won't turn it back on, though it toggles PCM correctly. \nThe script that worked was:\n#!/bin/bash\n    if amixer -c 0 get Master | grep -q off\nthen\n    amixer set Master unmute\n    amixer set PCM unmute\n\nelse\n    amixer set Master mute\nfi\n\nThen I used Xubuntu keybindings (settings> settings manager> keyboard> application shortcuts) to browse to the script (I called it sndfx.sh and set it to executable by right clicking in thunar and under permissions ticked make executable). Then I assigned the HP Pavilion quickkey to it by tapping that key. Now, it toggles correctly - Awesome.\nHope this helps someone else.\nPeace\n\nA: If I'm not mistaken, it's a bug that causes other mixer channels to mute and unmute.  To mute, try\namixer set Master 0;\nTo unmute try\namixer set Master 1%+;\namixer set Master 7dB+;\n\nA: I'm using this script as a workaround:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nCURRENT_STATE=`amixer get Master | egrep 'Playback.*?\\[o' | egrep -o '\\[o.+\\]'`\n\nif [[ $CURRENT_STATE == '[on]' ]]; then\n    amixer set Master mute\nelse\n    amixer set Master unmute\n    amixer set Front unmute\n    amixer set Headphone unmute\nfi\n\nI did a diff of amixer scontents before calling amixer set Master mute and after calling it and unmuting everything using the GUI to figure out what needed to be unmuted.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*With sound on type amixer scontents > ~/before (you'll get a file with the status of all sound chanels)\n\n*Then toggle volume with amixer set Master toggle\n\n*Create a second chanel status file with amixer scontents > ~/after\n\n*Toggle sound again with amixer set Master toggle which is supposed to turn the volume back to the level before the first toggle command\n\n*Create a third file with amixer scontents > ~/afterafter\nNow you have three files telling you which tell you the status of the sound chanels used for normal sound, which are muted by amixer set Master toggle and which aren't turned on again by again unmuting with the same command.\nTo easily compare the files and see the differences (the chanels that get muted and won't unmute afterwards) you can use meld from the Software Centre. Start it, open the three files and on the scrollbar you can see where there are differences between the files. Use the found chanel names to add them to the above described script.\n\nA: If you want to replace amixer in .lircrc for your remotecontrol working with lirc, you can try following lines.

I'm an user of Ubuntu 11.10 who have an Asus U32sd equipped with i5 Sandy Bridge (Intel Graphics integrated).

The same program that I used in Natty and before, papfrefs, is still there, but everything in the program is greyed out.\n\nHow can I 'enable' this functionality again?\n\nA: This is a known bug in the pulseaudio package, where pulseaudio fails to find the location of the modules it needs to load. As a workaround set a symlink to the module location by executing the following command in a terminal:\nsudo ln -s /usr/lib/pulse-1.0 /usr/lib/pulse-1.0.0\n\nNote: this workaround was tested in the current environment and may not work in the future (hopefully we don't need it any more when an update was is released)\n", "Q: Can I use fglrx if I disable my integrated graphics? First of all: I love the new Ubuntu-Release. Sadly, I cant really use it.\nMy Laptop has a i5-CPU, which comes with integrated graphics.\nIt seems like there is no way at the moment to change the GPU while X is running, but I'm fine with that.\nBasically, I just want 3D Acceleration to play some games, but I cant get fglrx to install in any way. I tried the integrated Tool for installing such drivers, but I also tried downloading them from the AMD Website. Either way my Desktop/X11 either gets screwed up or I don't have any 3D acceleration whatsoever ( I tried different options with aticonfig ).\nUnfortunately my Laptop does not have the option to disable the integrated GPU, so I cant test how the driver would react if there was only one card.\nSo my Question is: Is there any way to get 3D-Acceleration out of my Laptop?\n( It might help to mention that vga_switcheroo is working to at least turn off the card im not currently using, but that does not enable 3D-Graphics )\n\nA: On the TimelineX 3820 there is an option to switch from dual graphics to single graphics.\nIn your case you want to use the ATI card, so at your laptop's BIOS search for Switchable setting on graphics and change it to Discrete. That will make your laptop use only you ATI card. You will then be able to install the fglrx driver, your system will ignore totally your Intel HD graphics.\nThat option is available for BIOS since v1.19 and up.\n", "Q: What is the toolchain upload that happens at the start of every release cycle? Looking at the release schedules, every release seems to start with a toolchain upload. \nWhat is a toolchain and which packages build the toolchain in Ubuntu?\n\nA: The toolchain is the programming tools for that release of Ubuntu. The developers need these tools in order to create programs for that release.\n\nA: The toolchain is the set of packages which are used to build all the rest, such as gcc, binutils, glibc, etc. They are uploaded at the beginning of the release cycle before other packages, so that all subsequent package uploads are built against these.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Desktop vs Ubuntu Server for development I just installed Ubuntu Desktop 11.10. I will be using it to work on LAMP and Java development. Here is my doubts:\n\n\n*\n\n*I want to know which edition should I install?\n\n*Is there any advantage using the server edition? Also, I don't see Apache, MySQL etc (But I see Eclipse & other java development tools) in the software center?\n\n*How can I get access to other packages ( Apache, MySQL, PHP etc) other than going through downloading and installing from each site?\n\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Are you developing using a GUI or not?\nIf you're developing on a computer where you need/want a GUI, such as Gnome/KDE, you'll need Ubuntu Desktop.\nUbuntu Server is the same as Ubuntu Desktop (even uses the same repository), but it doesn't have a GUI, and is a much more minimal install, with less overhead, primarily meant for computers that will be servers (e.g. a webserver).\nAlso, instead of downloading packages from sites, just use apt-get to install packages from the main repository. If needed, you can find other repositories with deb packages on launchpad.net, and add the repository (looks like ppa:abc/123) with the command add-apt-repository.\n\nA: 1) Ubuntu 11.10 will work just fine.\n2) Ubuntu Server and Ubuntu Desktop originate from the same Ubuntu Core. The difference is that Ubuntu Server does not have the ubuntu-desktop package installed as servers are designed to be lean machines and the GUI is too much overhead.\nYou can do the same thing on Ubuntu Desktop as you can on Ubuntu Server. Using the Ubuntu Software Center a search for Apache2 will yield the Apache2 meta-package for installing Apache2. To add mysql just install Mysql Server.\n3) Everything you need is installable from the Software Center - most as meta-packages. I would not go outside of the repositories as the packages available through the Software Center are ready-built for Ubuntu.\nThe one additional item that may help is to install KVM and setup a server environment in a VM to test your builds on. You can use the TestDrive an Ubuntu ISO tool to run everything you need - that tool is quite slick way to run VMs as it does all of the setup for you! If you didn't like the interface or want to build a local disk vs using the ISO you can always switch to using Virtual Machine Manager after you get everything setup.\n\nA: Anything you can do in Ubuntu Server, you can do in Ubuntu Desktop and vice versa. It's really easy to install services. Open a terminal and enter sudo tasksel. This will present you with a list of things to install, like a lamp-server, mailserver, etc. Just check the ones you want and it'll be installed, presenting you with dialogs when inputs are required for usernames, etc.\nBut you're right. This should be done from the software center.

At this point I had 2 Skype icons on the side panel: the one from the installation, which did not work, and the one just invoked, which now works.

The buttons on Chromium stay on the left side where Gnome Shell uses the right side. Any ideas on how to force Chromium have the buttons on the right side?\nThanks. \n\nA: You can accomplish that simply by editing gconf (which chromium uses) like this:\ngconftool /apps/metacity/general/button_layout -t string -s \"menu:minimize,maximize,close\"\nYou can leave the \"menu\" if you don't need it, however the colon is needed as a separator between the left and right sides of the titlebar.\nThe changes should be visible right away, if they're not just log out and back in.\nPS: I know that Ubuntu Tweak does exactly the same, but I couldn't for the life of me figure out how to post this as a comment on Geppettvs' answer, which I originally intended to do.\n\nA: Take a look at the answers to this questions, which may be helpful for you, I am reproducing only one of these over here for your convenience but all the answers provided by several users and their experiences may give you a clue on how to manage this issue:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I place Gedit's tab close buttons on the left?\n\n*Change color of window buttons\n\n*Change the default Downloads directory\n\n*How to make the window manager to show the X - [ ] not on left top corner but bottom left or bottom right corner?\nposted here for your convenience:\n\n\n\nDepending on your window decorator I am sure you can, in example,\n  using emerald to create your own theme which will allow you to define\n  where do you wish to place these controls.\nAnyway, Ubuntu Tweak will allow you to set the place on where\n  these controls are displayed on your windows top corners, left or\n  right, and will also allow you to re-arrange the buttons with your\n  preferences.\nTake a look at this screenshot: \nThis options can be found under \"Window Manager Settings\" in Ubuntu Tweak\nI hope this help you.\nGood luck!\n\nI hope this help you.\n\nA: right click on empty space near your tabs and select 'Use System Title Bar and Borders'.\n\nA: gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences button-layout ':minimize,maximize,close'\n\nThat worked for me for chrome, I supose that chromium is the same\n", "Q: How can I use compiz \"screen edges\"?

The ability to use screen edges is integral to the way I use a desktop, and one of the main reasons I use Ubuntu as my main OS.\n\nA: Open CCSM, go to Window Management -> Scale plugin.\nNow, under the third tab - Bindings, you can configure the window picker you want with any corner of your desktop. If I understood you correctly, you would need to click on the fourth entry, \"initiate window picker for all windows\" and choose the Top-Left corner.\n\n\nA: Agree, I checked CCSM settings, same as before, but no scale with mouse click [I had bottom right] but then altered some other settings and it works.

I remember, when I downloaded this image, I think I was forwarded from ubuntu.com to a mirror site, and I chose a French one at random because my nearest UK mirror was down. It must've been slightly out of date or something. In fact, I now remember seeing entries like this\nSQUASHFS error: zlib inflate error, data probably corrupt\nsquashfs_read_data failed to read block 0x1e457bbd\n\nin the output of dmesg (I think) or somewhere in /var/log when checking after the installation crash dumped me back to the live (Try Ubuntu) desktop.\nBasically, make sure you check the MD5 hash of your downloaded ISO file! (I know. I know. I rarely check either!)\nAnyway,I downloaded 64-bit Ubuntu 11.10 again and, this time, I was prompted with a Save As dialog, instead of being asked to choose a mirror site. When downloaded, checksum matched :) Installation ok :)\n\nA: Same thing happened to me while trying to install 11.10.\nThe system worked perfectly off LiveCD/LiveUSB but would fail when trying to install it. Tried burning a different cd and re-writing the iso on the usb drive, re-partitioned HDD space several times, checked it for errors, low-level formatted the installation usb and no luck.\nAs a last resort I did a memory test using the memtest86+ that comes in Ubuntu's image and it revealed that I have problems with the memory. I know the test takes up lots of time but if you've never done it, try it out! \nI haven't yet replaced my memory so I can't be 100% sure that it'll resolve the problem but very likely.\n\nA: This could be the result of bad RAM in your computer. I had a similar problem and it turned out to be that. Try testing your RAM by booting from the USB flash drive and, as soon as you see the keyboard and person icons at the bottom of the screen, press a key to show the non-graphical boot menu. Then select the option to test your RAM, from there.\nIf that reveals a defect in your RAM, then you'll have to remove or replace the affected RAM stick. (If you don't feel comfortable with doing this, you should enlist the assistance of a friend, professional, or other acquaintance with hardware experience. Since this would be a hardware issue, you could ask on Super User for advice about it, too.)\nThis could also be the following problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*Bad installation media (either physically defective, or, more likely, a corrupted write or corrupted ISO image). MD5SUM the Ubuntu ISO you used to make sure it's good (and if it's not, download a new one, MD5SUM it too, and start over with it).\nAlso verify that the USB drive was written correctly by selecting Check disc for defects from the same menu that has the RAM test option (see also this video).\n\n*There could be a problem with the drive you're trying to install Ubuntu to. If you have another drive, you could try installing it to that. Since the live system (running off the flash drive itself) works, you could test your hard disk with smartctl as explained in the Failing Disk section of this article.\n\nA: You may have some bad sectors on the target HDD.\nTo check sda1 volume for bad sectors in Linux run fsck -c /dev/sda1. For drive C: in Windows it should be chkdsk c: /f /r.\nIMHO chkdsk way will be more suitable as it will remap bad blocks on the HDD while Linux fsck simply marks such blocks as unusable in the current file system. \nQuote from man fsck.ext2\n\n-c     This  option  causes  e2fsck  to  use badblocks(8) program to do a read-only scan of the device in order to find any bad blocks.  If any bad blocks are found, they are added to the bad block inode to prevent them from being allocated to a file or directory.  If this option is specified twice, then the bad  block  scan  will  be done using a non-destructive read-write test\n\n\nA: I had the same error and it was just because the ISO file was corrupted. So I re-writed a new and clean ubuntu iso on my USB key and it worked. \n\nA: I also have same issue while installing Ubuntu, I already have Windows 10 in dual boot.\nTo debugging this I made following tests.\n1) checked Disk Diagnostic for HDD, SSD, USB drive in windows.\n2) checked Memory Diagnostic in windows(for total memory).\nIn the Memory Diagnostic test, I found the RAM issue.\nAs I have 4 sticks, 1 or more sticks having a problem\n3) repeated step 2 for each RAM stick (by removing other).\nI found 1 RAM stick having issue \"corsair vengeance LPX 8gb 2400mhz ddr4\"\nThen I removed it and installed Ubuntu 20.04 without any issues.\nThis might be one of the reason for installation failure.\n\nA: [Errno 5] Input/output error error message can be caused by the USB flash drive or the USB port.\n\n*\n\n*Unplug USB flash drive, plug it into another USB port, and restart the Ubuntu installer. For example, if your computer has both front USB ports and back USB ports unplug the USB flash drive and plug it into another USB port on the other side of the computer.\n\n\n*Try recreating the bootable Ubuntu live USB stick again using a different USB stick. Try using the most reliable one or the one used the least often. It might help to buy a new USB flash drive.\n\nA: I had the same problem.\nAfter searching I decided to install Ubuntu from the alternate CD (with the text-based installer) rather than the desktop CD. \nThat worked.\n\nA: I was having Issue's trying to install Lubuntu with a bootable USB,and I kept getting  that annoying \" installer crash\" and it wouldn't let me install on my netbook eeePC...Well I finally, got it to Install, and here's how it worked for me. Umm first of all I have win 7 starter on my netbook when I tried to install Lubuntu. So, in the options menu where it asked you how you want to install (partition) go to the \"someting else\" and in there you will highlight the drive, click on add partition. Now what this does, it wipes out the hard drive leaving it with nothing on it. After your done return back to the menu set up and Install.\nPS. this is good If your looking to do a FULL INSTALL only !!!    \n\nA: In my case that happened because I showed as primary(not secondary!) the Hard disk. But this  is a  *.iso file so you need to expose CD disk not Hard one. The ISO is supposed to be distributed via cd or sd card and its format should match one.Otherwise it will drop error:\n[Errno 5] - Input/output error\n\n\nafter installation you can change primary bootable drive to Hard disk the system to load faster.\n", "Q: Upgrading from 11.04 to 11.10 ceased at certain point: how to continue? I upgraded my ubuntu 11.04 to 11.10 through update manager, but with 30 minutes to go (out of 6 hours) I got 3 error messages telling me that it could not install these packages:\n\n\n*\n\n*firmware-b43-installer\n\n*flashplugin-downloader: i386\n\n*flashplugin-nstaller\n\n\n(fyi: it's a x64 laptop).\nSo now I have a system which is not running very well (read: slow).

You should be good to go.\nI've just tested this and it seems to work (your library is safe and if it still doesn't work, you can just restore from the -BACKUP version)\n\nA: Remove ~/.cache/banshee-1 and run banshee.\n\nA: in terminal: \n\nsudo apt-get build-dep banshee\n\nif you get errors, check what unsupported software blocks your dependencies. in me case it was vlc. remove it completely. then you can reinstall banshee and vlc from oneiric sources.\n\nA: All the answers were good, and I did try what I could, but in the end I decided that I'd be better off with a fresh install.  If there were unmet dependencies with Banshee, where else might there have been problems?  So I backed up and then installed everything fresh, and now feel very good about everything.  Yeah, it took more time, but now I'm pretty converted to doing fresh installs.\n", "Q: Desura fails to run: Error loading library libcef_desura.so I've been using desura for a few weeks now on 11.04 without any problems, however when I upgraded to 11.10 today and reinstalled desura I get this error message:\ninclude/SharedObjectLoader.h:75 - Error loading library libcef_desura.so:\n'libplc4.so.0d:   wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS32'\n\nI'm running 64-bit 11.10 Ubuntu desktop.

After reboot, the new lightdm showed up as expected, and I could choose the login shell from a menu containing \"ubuntu\", \"ubuntu 2D\", \"recovery console\", \"kde workspace\", \"cairo-dock with effects\", \"cairo-dock without effects\", etc. next to my name which corresponds to my username.\nHOWEVER, for example, I chose \"ubuntu\" (as the default selection) and input the correct (if not correct, the lightdm would ask you to input again, but it did not do so, I have tried) password and entered. The screen splashed to the black screen of the background text interface of gdm for a very short interval and then returned back to the interface of lightdm without my user account logged in and appeared as if I have not done anything on the laptop. Neither could I log in as a guest user as the same black screen splashed and lightdm reappeared.\nBefore the upgrade, I could run gnome 2, kde, unity all quite well on the laptop, but the status quo is that no one from the menu prompt beside my name can log in to my account, including the \"recovery console\".\nActually I can switch to the ttys and log in my account with my username and passcode normally, as can run all commands in the tty (I am currently doing this). I can also act like a superuser via the \"sudo\" command and get a # prompt via the \"sudo -i\" command, with the correct password, no problem.\nIn the root prompt, I can run \"service lightdm stop\" and \"startx\" to a root unity UI successfully (that is the way how this passage comes out), but in the $ prompt, after running \"service lightdm stop\" and \"startx\", it simply appears \"No protocol specified\" endlessly and no GUI appears.\nI found the package \"gnome-shell\" not fully installed and fixed it, but it did not help, simply resulting in a selection in the menu which cannot access my account as its companions.\nI have made all the packages in my laptop up-to-date and no updates should be installed.\nMy device is ThinkPad X61, with all its functions running well on all previous ubuntu distributions since 10.04 LTS.

How, then, do I disable the X server in Ubuntu 11.10?\n\nA: GDM was switched out for LightDM, so:\nsudo stop lightdm\n\nOr in your service parlance:\nsudo service lightdm stop\n\nFor future reference, all these upstart services (that can be run with initctl's service command and shortcuts) are .conf files in /etc/init/\n\nA: @Oli pretty much nailed it, but I wanted to note that this probably won't help you out much if you need to do something from the command line without X. \nFor that, you should press Ctrl+Alt+F1, then log in from the console. Afterwards, you can kill and restart the lightdm service as needed.\n\nA: Technically speaking gdm or lightdm are managing desktop session requests they are not X servers.\n(an X server is serving events to X application, xorg is an X server :) . \nEdit\nTo stop the X server killall X  or sudo killall X if you are not owner of the process.\nOf course you must have a terminal to do that. \nOne way if you cannot open a gnome terminal or an xterm is to start a text console; \npress simultaneously  Ctrl + Alt + F1 keys, then login at the prompt (your password will not be shown, not even as asterisks).\n (F1 to F5 are ok)\n\nA: old post but current question. The command sudo service mdm stop would successfully disable the X server in Linux Mint 17.3 temporarily. After install drivers you can do sudo service mdm start.\n\nA: The reason that doesn't work is because Ubuntu 11.10 has switched from GDM to LightDM.\nTry this command instead:\nsudo service lightdm stop\n\n\nA: You can also use the keyboard shortcut:\nAlt + PrtScn/SysReq + K\n\nA bit of a long winded keyboard shortcut, maybe too many people were pressing Ctrl+Alt+Backspace so they changed it to this.\nI can confirm this as working from 10.04 through to 11.10.\n\nA: since this is the primary result that came up with the google search Solus stop X server, I wanted to add this answer because Solus doesn't use service.\nfor this, you can use sudo systemctl stop lightdm and do whatever you need to do.\n", "Q: How to remove the Mail icon indicator applet?

You will also loose the Sound Control icon as both are connected to each-other.\nBy removing the \"indicator applet\" package you will no longer be able to access or control the sound settings by clicking on the panel icon.\n\nA: 1) In a terminal:\nsudo apt-get remove indicator-messages\nsudo killall gnome-panel\n\nThis will remove the package, and then remove the icon without rebooting.\n\nA: Run sudo apt-get remove indicator-messages and then either log out or run killall unity-panel-service for the changes to take effect.\n\nA: So doing a removal of \"indicator-messages\" will result in removing more then you want like the sound indicator and others. for a list of what you might remove start dconf editor and look under /com/canonical/indicator/messages/applications to see what is there. Having made this mistake of removing indicator-messages\" the best solution is to edit /com/canonical/indicator/messages/applications and only remove what you want. In my situation I only had to reset (Default:[])/com/canonical/indicator/messages/applications/thunderbird.destop that set this to blank. re:List of applications that are shown in the messaging menu, Applications corresponding to the desktop file ids in this list are shown in the messaging menu.

I've read this Q&A and I'm ready to try it with Xubuntu. That is, I'll go from Ubuntu to Xubuntu.\nAt this moment, my laptop is slow, even after the various optimizations. My question is whether this is the correct way to proceed.\nsudo apt-get upgrade           # upgrade all existing packages to newest version\nsudo do-release-upgrade        # upgrade system (takes some hours)   \n\nsudo apt-get xubuntu-desktop   # switch to Gnome on login\n\nRemove the ubuntu-desktop package (Which command should I use?)\n\nA: Sort of, there's a typo (you need install in your installation line). You also don't need to remove ubuntu-desktop and I certainly wouldn't do this until you're happy with what you've got. Here's what I would do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Xubuntu task\nsudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop^\n\n\n*Log out, log back in, selecting Xubuntu/Xfce as my interface\n\n*Chill out for a few days. See that things still work. There will be too many applications (eg there will be both GNOME's and Xfce's default applications available but you want to make sure you'll have everything you need when you remove GNOME/Unity/Whatever.\n\n*Clean up.\nsudo apt-get remove ubuntu-desktop\nsudo apt-get autoremove # removes dependencies of ubuntu-desktop\n\n\nNote: we need to install Xubuntu task (xubuntu-desktop^) to avoid bug 1754872 with meta-package.\n\nA: You might want to switch to lightdm too.

Can I back up a single file with deja dup? (note these files may need to stay in ~/ to work)\n\nA: You could (perhaps, let me know if it works) create a new directory called ~/.files-to-be-backed-up/ and then symlink your individual files into that directory:\nmkdir ~/.files-to-be-backed-up/\nln -s ~/Desktop/file ~/.files-to-be-backed-up/file\n\nAnd then just set Deja-Dup to backup anything in that hidden directory.\n", "Q: How to hide the Bluetooth icon in the panel? There was an option under Bluetooth preferences in 11.04 to easily hide the icon, but in 11.10, there's a little bar near the top right corner called Visibility.

Then in there you can set the bluetooth from enabled to disabled. It also allows you to turn off other autostart applications that you might not want. Like Gwibber, I hate gwibber. Anyway the command to show the autostart applications is :\nsudo sed -i 's/NoDisplay=true/NoDisplay=false/g' /etc/xdg/autostart/*.desktop\nCopy/Paste and then open the 'Startup Applications' and make the changes.

I have a free Dropbox account which I use about 5-10% of currently. I mostly use it on my Windows 7 work laptop to store my source code backups (pseudo-SVN), and also on my Windows 7 home desktop which I use to store some of my documents which I want to keep safe in case of data loss etc.\nI'm just about to upgrade my netbook from 11.04 to 11.10 (clean install). Should I be switching from Dropbox to Ubuntu One? It wouldn't be very difficult to transfer my files across, it's mostly a case of which one is better for me.\nI'd like to have my source code and documents available on my netbook and have been using the Ubuntu Dropbox client up until now and have been happy with it, but I know Ubuntu One is more tightly intergrated with the OS.\nWhich one do you suggest?\n\nA: I haven't used the Ubuntu One service, but it looks like a viable alternative to DropBox. I've used Dropbox for several months now, and I haven't had any issues with it. The only nice thing about Ubuntu One is that is has 5GB free storage. Dropbox you only get 2GB free.\nThey also offer a Windows7/Vista program for Ubuntu One. It looks very similar to Dropbox. https://one.ubuntu.com/downloads/\n\nA: My advice would be to keep them both.\nThis way, you get redundancy and if one service goes down, you can still have another. You can use symlinks to link content in one-service to another.\nWhich one you use as a primary service is upto you. Dropbox has higher coverage(although clients are getting done for Ubuntu One as well). Ubuntu One has higher free storage (5gb), but since you already have a dropbox account, you may wish to stick to it.\n\nSpiderOak is another service you might like. Especially if you want to use this for backups, as it has a special Backup option.\n\nA: I love the ubuntu one interface and the integration with the operating system, was also contemplating the idea of buying extra storage but unfortunately their products are way expensive that google's storage. Currently I use multiple services to store my important files, especially my 20 GB of pictures.\n\nA: I have had great experiences with both Dropbox and Ubuntu One, but in the end I have chosen Ubuntu One for one main reason: while both Dropbox and Ubuntu One give you file syncing, Ubuntu One let's you select a folder/file on your computer and have it automatically sync. In other words, you don't need to constantly copy files from your computer to Dropbox/Ubuntu One and vice versa to update your files. I find this extremely useful because when I edit a file on a different computer and later view it on my personal computer, the file is automatically updated on my computer, not just on Dropbox/Ubuntu One. Hope this helps!\n\nA: I suggest and am using both.\nThey have different advantages and disadvantages, so I take advantage of each's strength's:\nI use UbuntuOne for a bunch of video's.\nAdvantages of UbuntuOne for this kinda stuff:\n- More than twice as much free space as Dropbox.\n- Tightly integrated with Ubuntu, my main OS.\n- Still available on Windows machines that I use.\n- Currently has a cheaper minimum paid level at $4 a month (20GB), compared to Dropbox - $10 a month (50GB).\n- Allows me to pick 'other' folders outside of my standard UbuntuOne folder.\nI use Dropbox for code, text clips and all the other assorted documents I like access to.\nAdvantages of Dropbox for this kinda stuff:\n- Well integrated and works well with gui's on all platforms.\n- Easy to set up folder sharing with others.\n- Constant Panel notification for activity (UbuntuOne only has pop-ups right now).\n- Well known so familiar to and used by more others.\nFinally using both also gives me\n2GB (dropbox) + 1/2GB (dropbox referral) + 5GB (UbuntuOne) for a total of 7.5 free GB...\n", "Q: How do I move the clock in GNOME Classic? The clock in the middle is driving me batty and I can't get it to move to the right side of the screen where I would like it. No other log in works for me except GNOME Classic so I'm sticking with that--unfortunately, that means that none of the GNOME 3 extensions I've installed fix this issue.\nThere's no option to unlock or move if I right click it :( How can I move this thing??\n\nA: Hold Alt (or Windows/Super/Meta+Alt depending on your configuration) and right click the clock. Then you can access the panel menu for it (move/remove).\nThe same is true for adding widgets, creating new panels, etc.\n", "Q: Flash replacement for Linux I am using Adobe flash browser plugin 11.0 in Linux however playing a simple youtube clip causes the CPU to spike considerably on the npviewer.bin process with Firefox, the same is true for Chrome on linux. \nWas anyone able to configure VLC, mplayer or similar to auto start when flv files are streamed from a website? Considering that VLC can stream flvs just fine.\n\nA: From my experience it is precisely the 'simple youtube clip' that puts graphic card to biggest stress as far as Flash is concerned (you have to look in something like psensor, to have a loud fan or a crashing computer in order to realize how heavy this stuff really is on the GPU).\nThe most recommended alternatives to Adobe Flash (like Gnash) are not yet up to the task, a fact that anybody will notice after trying those.\nBut for seeing youtube videos without spiking GPU temperature up to the ceiling one can use smplayer (F11 or edit main toolbar and add the specific button). Thus I was able to avoid the habitual 'flash experience' of putting my GPU to 100 degrees Celsius.\n\n\nTo download youtube videos and see them in external player one can use FlashGot  or DownloadHelper add-ons in Firefox.\nMy related asqubuntu question here. \nAnd a more recent and detailed question+answer whith more solutions to see flash in external players - here.\n\nA: Adobe Flash Player 11.2 beta is multi-threaded, so the user-interface is more responsive during playback of laggy HD content that slows down the machine.\nThere are alternative Flash implementations such as Gnash and Lightspark, but they're not 100% compatible as they don't fully implement all the features of the latest ActionScript, etc.\n\nA: Firefox, starting with F 15 (maybe 14..) supports gstreamer for h264 videos if compiled in, which means it will work with youtube html5 on many more videos. However Firefox has to be recompiled for this, which is not for the faight of heart.\nYou can also turn off flash, and some videos will play with WebM instead of flash, (even without h264 support) but not all videos will work.\n", "Q: Why do tasks on Amazon Xen instance block for over 120 seconds causing server to hang?

 I heard that the Nvidia 7200 GS card has been blacklisted since Natty. Also, I read that you can add unity_force_start=1 to /etc/environment to use Unity 3D. That doesn't seem to work for me though.\nI can play 3D required games such as Neverball and Nexuiz, but I also want to be able to use Unity 3D, because the 2D version is pretty unusable, at least for me.\nIs there any workaround to get Unity working for me?

When I'm running 3840x1200 desktop resolution, it has some noticable lag even in the 2D version of unity offered, but overall it worked well enough.  I did have UNITY_FORCE_START=1 in my /etc/environment file already, and it persisted through the upgrade, maybe yours wasn't working due to case sensitivity?\n", "Q: Wireless Woes. Can't seem to get b43-fwcutter and firmware-b43-installer to stay put upon reboot I'm running 11.10 on a Dell Inspiron N4010 (14R) and can't get my wireless settings to stick after a reboot.  As the title states, the first thing I do when using a fresh install is to get synaptic running and install b43-fwcutter and firmware-b43-installer. So, upon rebooting, I am forced to use the wired connection which, strangely, will then detect my wireless network, and I can unplug the cable and use wireless until the next reboot.  Btw- wireless works fine when booting from a live-usb.\nThe following is the output from  sudo lshw -c network:\n   description: Wireless interface\n   product: BCM4313 802.11b/g/n Wireless LAN Controller\n   vendor: Broadcom Corporation\n   physical id: 0\n   bus info: pci@0000:03:00.0\n   logical name: wlan0\n   version: 01\n   serial: 1c:65:9d:99:10:2c\n   width: 64 bits\n   clock: 33MHz\n   capabilities: pm msi pciexpress bus_master cap_list ethernet physical wireless\n   configuration: broadcast=yes driver=brcmsmac driverversion=3.0.0-12-generic firmware=N/A ip=192.168.1.2 latency=0 link=yes multicast=yes wireless=IEEE 802.11bgn\n   resources: irq:17 memory:f0500000-f0503fff\n\nThanks in advance for any advice you all might have!\n\nA: You don't want to use b43-fwcutter for the BCM4313. That's not the right driver.\nThe right driver is the brcm80211 driver which (firmware aside) is completely open source and should be in the kernel. Just to confuse things, I think somebody changed the name of this driver after the 2.6.28 kernel (where it made its debut) so I'm not sure exactly what you should be looking for.\nBut this is why the live environment \"just works\". It's using the default out-the-box driver and it's working.\nI'd recommend that you remove everything to do with fwcutter. I don't know what that driver does so you might have to scrape around in the blacklist files (in /etc/modprobe.d/). Running this might help:\ngrep -R 'brcm' /etc/modprobe.d/*\n\nIf it pulls anything up, comment out the line (stick a # at the beginning), save and restart. You'll obviously need to edit those files as root: sudoedit /etc/modprobe.d/...\n", "Q: How do I remove the Nautilus top bar on a second screen? Is there any way to remove it without losing icons on the desktop?\n\n\nA: I think this is a bug. If you could move the shell's panel, you'd see that menu goes right across the entire screen and provides File/Edit/View/Go/Bookmarks/Help.\nIt's caused by the hacks Unity has to perform to get a menu for the desktop. Yes, I know you're not using Unity. Neither am I (Gnome Classic) and I've got it too.\nUnfortunately the only way it's going to get fixed is if somebody improves the way that Unity deals with the menus, or they elaborate on the hack so it only does it when Unity is running.\nThere are patches floating around (check out the bug report) but I couldn't say if or when it's going to get pulled in.\n\nA: Have you tried to use the gnome-tweak-tool and turn off the file manager handing the desktop as described in this solution to a similar problem:\nRemoving second/unity/nautilus bar behind gnome 3 top bar\n", "Q: Computer shuts down when unplugged I have an MSI Wind U100 netbook (they call it a notebook).

I have LXDE installed, and have to enter \"startlxde\" every time I restart the computer.\nIs there a way to automatically run this command at startup?\n\nA: It sounds like you don't have a display manager installed. This is what would normally start up X (the graphical server) and get you into a position where you can log in. The confiusing thing is how you ended up without gdm or lightdm in the first place.\nIf you're using 11.10, I suggest you run\nsudo apt-get install lightdm\n\nThat should install everything it needs in terms of start up scripts and should display something fancy for you on boot.\nIf you're on something before 11.10, swap out lightdm for gdm.\nIf you did this on purpose and you don't want a display manager and only want a single-user system without login protection, look into nodm which is a display manager that just spits you out on a desktop as a user. It's a bit more manual to set up though.\n", "Q: How to change Nvidia X server settings?

You probably have to run myindicator.set_icon_theme_path but I did not find the names of the different icons that are used. \nTo 1.):\nTo get the colors of a gtk widget programmatically for use in cairo (to draw them later) you can use something like this (for a menu):\nimport gtk\ndef get_menubar_colors_for_cairo():\n    w = gtk.Window()\n    b = gtk.MenuBar()\n    w.add(b)\n    w.show_all()\n    w.hide()\n    style = b.get_style()\n    del(w)\n    del(b)\n    bg = {}\n    fg = {}\n    for name, state in [(\"normal\", gtk.STATE_NORMAL),\n                        (\"active\", gtk.STATE_ACTIVE),\n                        (\"prelight\", gtk.STATE_PRELIGHT),\n                        (\"selected\", gtk.STATE_SELECTED),\n                        (\"insensitive\", gtk.STATE_INSENSITIVE)]:\n        bg[name] = (style.bg[state].red / 65535.0, style.bg[state].green / 65535.0, style.bg[state].blue / 65535.0)\n        fg[name] = (style.fg[state].red / 65535.0, style.fg[state].green / 65535.0, style.fg[state].blue / 65535.0)\n    return fg, bg\n\nThis gives you the forground and background style for different states. (There are probably better ways, but this should still work...)\nNote that the bright blue or bright red do not seem to be part of the standard menu colors. I could not find out where they come from. \nNote also that if the gtk theme changes but you leave your icons as they are, they will stand out since they then might have the wrong colors.\nTo 2.a) You can use cairo to draw images to various surfaces (png, pdf, svg, gtk widgets, ...). Here is an example that draws some rectangles onto png surfaces and saves the files in your current working directory. Each rectangle has the foreground color drawn onto the background color of the given state:\nimport cairo\ndef draw_a_rect(fg, bg, state, outfilename):\n    surf = cairo.ImageSurface(cairo.FORMAT_ARGB32, 200, 200)\n    context = cairo.Context(surf)\n\n    context.rectangle(0, 0, 200, 200)\n    context.set_source_rgb(*bg[state])\n    context.fill()\n\n    context.rectangle(50, 50, 100, 100)\n    context.set_source_rgb(*fg[state])\n    context.fill()\n    surf.write_to_png(outfilename % state)\n\nfg, bg = get_menubar_colors_for_cairo()\nfor state_name in [\"normal\", \"active\", \"prelight\", \"selected\", \"insensitive\"]:\n    draw_a_rect(fg, bg, state_name, \"test_%s.png\")\n\nA last note: you probably want to leave the background of your icons transparent, so you have one color less to worry about.\n", "Q: How to create a new dash panel for my program?

Ubuntu is not a requirement, but the distro I'm familiar with (kind of).\nWhat I need is: Java Runtime Environment 6.0, Postgres 8.4 with custom database installed, JBoss Application Server 4.2.1 with already deployed application and Firefox with handy bookmarks. Language pack for local language is desirable.\nThere is a LiveCDCustomization on Ubuntu Help section, but I'm a novice Linux user, that's too complicated for me right now. My guess of the easiest way possible would be to set an Ubuntu installation just like I need it inside VirtualBox (already done) and somehow turn it into a LiveCD.\nGoogling around I found remastersys, but I couldn't get it right, the forums were quite slow, and the few help I got didn't fix my issues. Plus, it was recently discontinued. \nOf the different problems I found, the most tricky is Postgres. It requires a special user that is the owner of the data folder, and such user is lost when creating an ISO with remastersys, making the database unusable.

Give a name to the shortcut like \"Disable Touchpad\" or something and add the command you discovered above\nxinput set-prop <id> \"Device Enabled\" 0\n\nand click apply. Then add another shortcut called \"Enable Touchpad\" or something similar to the first and change the previous command to a 1 at the end\nxinput set-prop <id> \"Device Enabled\" 1\n\nthose are the off/on respectivly.\nNow that those are added, click on Enable Touchpad's Shortcut column (should say 'disabled') and type the keyboard shortcut you want it to be, I chose Win+1 (Hold Windows Key and press the number 1). Do the same for Disable Touchpad, I chose Win+2.\nNow Win+1 enables my touchpad and Win+2 disables it.\n\nA: In my case, fn+F9 is mapped into Touchpad toggle.\nBut the key does nothing just showing touch pad icon on the right-top of the screen like this.\n\n\nHere is a solution for toggling touchpad just by pressing a shortcut.\n1. Getting id of your touchpad\n$ xinput list\n\n2. Writing a script for toggling touchpad\nSo I got a bash script file for toggling touchpad with 'xinput' command(original script can be found here).\nIn my case, the id of touch pad was 12.\n#!/bin/bash\n\ndevice=12\nstate=`xinput list-props \"$device\" | grep \"Device Enabled\" | grep -o \"[01]$\"`\n\nif [ \"$state\" -eq '1' ];then\n  xinput --disable \"$device\"\nelse\n  xinput --enable \"$device\"\nfi\n\nSave the above script file as .toggleTouchPad.sh at where you want.\n3. Keyboard shortcut for running the script\nAnd last step is adding keyboard shortcut to run the script file.\nSo just write sh /PATH/TO/SCRIPT in the Command of your shortcut window .\n\n4. Try the shortcut\nPress the shortcut and check if touchpad is toggled.\nIt worked at ASUS A556UA Laptop and Ubuntu14.04 x64 installed.\n\nThing to be improved.\n\n\n*\n\n*assigning Touchpad toggle key to the above custom shortcut would not work\n\n*it just shows touch pad icon on the right-top of the screen\n\n*so I had to assign another key(super+F9) rather than Touchpad toggle(fn+F9) key. \n\n\n\nplease suggest a way to assign Touchpad toggle key to a custom shortcut for complete solution\n\nA: For Ubuntu 16.04 \nFor disable touchpad:\nxinput --disable $(xinput --list | grep -i 'touchpad' | grep -o 'id=[0-9]*' | sed 's/id=//') \n\nand for enable touchpad:\nxinput --enable $(xinput --list | grep -i 'touchpad' | grep -o 'id=[0-9]*' | sed 's/id=//')\n\n\nA: Run the following command in a terminal:\nxinput list\n\nYou will get an output that looks like this:\n⎡ Virtual core pointer                          id=2    [master pointer  (3)]\n⎜   ↳ Virtual core XTEST pointer                id=4    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad                id=12   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎣ Virtual core keyboard                         id=3    [master keyboard (2)]\n    ↳ Virtual core XTEST keyboard               id=5    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Power Button                              id=6    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Video Bus                                 id=7    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Power Button                              id=8    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Sleep Button                              id=9    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Laptop_Integrated_Webcam_1.3M             id=10   [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ AT Translated Set 2 keyboard              id=11   [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Dell WMI hotkeys                          id=13   [slave  keyboard (3)]\n\nIt displays all the input devices connected. Note that they all have an id. \nSince 12 is the id for my touchpad, running the following command will disable it.\nxinput set-prop 12 \"Device Enabled\" 0\n\nIn Ubuntu versions >12.04 you can also directly disable via\nxinput --disable 12\n\n(and enable via a similar command)\n\nA: Based on answer given by @Peng Wu I created a bash script that can be used...\n#!/bin/bash\n\ndeclare -i ID\nID=`xinput list | grep -Eo 'TouchPad\\s*id\\=[0-9]{1,2}' | grep -Eo '[0-9]{1,2}'`\n\nxinput set-prop $ID \"Device Enabled\" 0\n\necho 'Touchpad has been disabled.'\n\nYou can manually run it or run it on start. Then you can make the script run at boot.\nAnother bash script to toggle touchpad:\n#!/bin/bash\n\ndeclare -i ID\nID=`xinput list | grep -Eo 'TouchPad\\s*id\\=[0-9]{1,2}' | grep -Eo '[0-9]{1,2}'`\ndeclare -i STATE\nSTATE=`xinput list-props $ID|grep 'Device Enabled'|awk '{print $4}'`\nif [ $STATE -eq 1 ]\nthen\n    xinput disable $ID\n    echo \"Touchpad disabled.\"\nelse\n    xinput enable $ID\n    echo \"Touchpad enabled.\"\nfi\n\n\nA: First check if your laptop has enable/disable touchpad keyboard shortcut, by any chance! On my Lenovo Thinkpad T500 it's Fn+F8\n\nA: https://bitbucket.org/barseghyanartur/xinput\nIt's a very tiny code which allows you to disable/enable the touchpad from terminal.\nSimply follow the Instructions below:\nInstall:\n$ pip install xinput\n\nDisable touchpad:\n$ disable-touchpad\n\nEnable touchpad:\n$ enable-touchpad\n\n\nA: Simply, in a terminal:\nsynclient TouchpadOff=1\n\nHowever, the above seems to not work anymore in Ubuntu 16.04. In this case, then xinput still works:\nxinput set-prop `xinput --list | awk '/[Tt]ouch[Pp]ad.*pointer/ {print $7}' | sed 's/id=\\(.*\\)/\\1/'` \"Device Enabled\" 0\n\n\nA: I tried using the laptop function key (fn) to disable the pointer and it works. It did not work during my 11.04 days though, so give that a try.\n\nA: install the Jupiter app.  You can disable the touchpad with it and it is remembered. This has worked effectively for me on both a Lenovo IdeaPad and ThinkPad on 11.04, 11.10, and 12.04.\n\nA: Just add a couple of bash functions to your .bashrc to give you a togggle...\n#toggle-touchpad on|off\nfunction touchpadon  { /usr/bin/xinput --enable $(xinput --list | grep -Eo 'TouchPad\\s*id\\=[0-9]{1,2}' | grep -Eo '[0-9]{1,2}') ; echo \"touchpad enabled\";}\nfunction touchpadoff  { /usr/bin/xinput --disable $(xinput --list | grep -Eo 'TouchPad\\s*id\\=[0-9]{1,2}' | grep -Eo '[0-9]{1,2}') ; echo \"touchpad disabled\";}\n\n\nA: It is actually very simple to disable touchpad in Ubuntu. Just remove the package xserver-xorg-input-synaptics that is required for using touchpads in Ubuntu!\nsudo apt-get remove xserver-xorg-input-synaptics\nIt is the only way to disable touchpad permanently that worked for me. The other ways were only temporary: \nxinput list\nxinput set-prop IDOFTOUCHPAD \"Device Enabled\" 0 \nsynclient TouchpadOff=1 \n\nI am using LXDE and I was not able to automatically disable the touchpad by adding these lines to ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE/autostart or /etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE/autostart with a @-prefix. It was just ignored. \nAnd I tried disabling touchpad with dconf-editor (org.gnome.desktop.peripherals.touchpad) and gconf-editor (desktop.gnome.peripherals.TOUCHPADNAME), but both did not work. The settings on dconf-editor have no effect at all and on gconf-editor it keeps showing the error message \"This key has no schema\".\n\nA: UPDATED SOLUTION:\nInstead of xinput, with id variables that can change, better use synclient as indicated in other answers, like this.\nsudo apt install xserver-xorg-input-synaptics\n\nTo turn off touchpad:\nsynclient TouchpadOff=1\n\nTo turn on:\nsynclient TouchpadOff=0\n\nTo be used with launchers or shortcuts as said below.\n\nThis is just the application of the commands in this answer under the present question. The solution below is limited to Xfce/Xubuntu, but although I made it by chance, I find it too elegant not too share it here. So, I created a separate question initially, just for Xubuntu. That question cannot but be a duplicate of this one and may be closed for this reason, that's why I dare to re-post that answer here.   \n\nIt is about these two commands:\nDisable:\nxinput set-prop 15 \"Device Enabled\" 0\n\nEnable:\nxinput set-prop 15 \"Device Enabled\" 1\n\nThe id number will be found by running\nxinput list\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Search for mouse\n\n*Click on Mouse and Touchpad\n\n*Click off/on button to the right of touchpad settings.\n\n\n\n\n\nA: If your laptop keyboard doesn't have a touchpad on/off special-function key, maybe you can find an on-screen virtual keyboard that simulates it (although I haven't found one).\nShort of that, this works well:\nsudo apt-get install gpointing-device-settings\n\n\n\nA: What worked for me on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS with Dell Laptop\nI wanted disable the pointer which is in the middle of the keyboard and creates a lot of issues while typing. So:\n$ xinput list\n ⎡ Virtual core pointer                     id=2\n ⎜   ↳ Virtual core XTEST pointer               id=4\n ⎜   ↳ Wacom Graphire2 4x5 eraser               id=9\n ⎜   ↳ Wacom Graphire2 4x5 cursor               id=10\n ⎜   ↳ Wacom Graphire2 4x5                      id=11\n ⎜   ↳ AlpsPS/2 ALPS DualPoint TouchPad         id=14\n ⎜   ↳ Macintosh mouse button emulation         id=15\n ⎜   ↳ DualPoint Stick                          id=13\n ⎣ Virtual core keyboard                    id=3\n     ↳ Virtual core XTEST keyboard              id=5\n     ↳ Video Bus                                id=6\n     ↳ Power Button                             id=7\n     ↳ Sleep Button                             id=8\n     ↳ AT Translated Set 2 keyboard             id=12\n\nThe device I want to disable has id 13. Use xinput to list its properties:\n\n$ xinput -list-props 13\n Device 'DualPoint Stick':\n    Device Enabled (115):   0\n [...several lines removed...]\n $ xinput -set-prop 13 115 0\n\nThis has disabled the Dualpoint stick. But none of the other answers worked for me. I did\nInstall dconf-tools:\nsudo apt-get install  dconf-tools\ndconf-editor\n\nThen go to org -> gnome -> settings-daemon -> peripherals -> touchpad and uncheck touchpad-enabled field\n\nA: I found a nice solution of creating a key binding that will invoke the command:\nxdotool key 199\n\nwhere 199 is a keycode recognized as XF86TouchpadToggle. This way one can make a key combination of his/her choice to behave like a special key some laptops have to toggle the touchpad as desktop environments like Mate or Cinnamon handle it great. You can check keycodes by this command:\nxmodmap -pke\n\nI have created a how-to on my blog: https://artofcode.wordpress.com/2017/10/01/how-to-add-a-key-binding-to-toggle-a-touchpad-under-linux/\n\nA: So, by combining Krzysztof Tomaszewski and JaeJun LEE's answers I came to this solution.  \nCreate the following toggleTouchPad.sh script and save it wherever you want:\n#!/bin/bash\ndevice=14\nstate=`xinput list-props \"$device\" | grep \"Device Enabled\" | grep -o \"[01]$\"`\nif [ \"$state\" -eq '1' ];then\n  xinput --disable \"$device\" && sleep 1 && xdotool key 201\nelse\n  xinput --enable \"$device\" && sleep 1 && xdotool key 200\nfi\n\nwhere 14 is your TouchDevice Id (refer to JaeJun LEE's answer)\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Ubuntu Settings -> Devices -> Keyboard \n\n*At the end of the list, click on + to add a new custom shortcut\n\n*Name it Toggle Touchpad, with Command /path/to/.toggleTouchPad.sh and whatever key combination you'd want (I've just chosen Super + F7).\nNow, whenever you hit your chosen key combination, it not only toggle the Touchpad but it also shows a notification icon thanks to xdotool\n\nA: My solution is the following tp script:\n#!/bin/bash\nTT=`xinput --list | grep -i touchpad | sed -e \"\ns/(// \ns/)//\ns/ //g\n\"`\nset $TT\n\n(( $2 ))\n\nxinput list | grep -iq mouse &&{\n   xinput --disable $id\n}||{\n   xinput --enable $id\n}\n\nThe touchpad is disabled if a mouse is detected, and enable if not.\nThe touchpad id is found by the script.\n\nA: Like so often this is not really one problem but two.\nSo first we get the touchpads id.\nThen we can disable and enable, that given id.\n# Get the touchpad's id. \ntouchpad_id=$(\n    xinput list                 |\n        grep Touchpad           |\n        grep -E -o id=[0-9]*    |   \n        grep -o [0-9]*          \\\n        ;\n    );\n\n# Enable.\nxinput --enable ${touchpad_id};\n\n# Disable.\nxinput --disable ${touchpad_id};\n\n\nA: Alternative solution which works for all touchpads, no id needed.\nopen a terminal and write \"gedit toggle_touchpad.sh\"   \n#!/bin/bash\ncondition=\"$(gsettings get org.gnome.settings-daemon.peripherals.touchpad touchpad-enabled)\"\n\nif [ \"$condition\" == \"false\" ]; then\n     gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.peripherals.touchpad touchpad-enabled true\nelif [ \"$condition\" == \"true\" ]; then\n    gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.peripherals.touchpad touchpad-enabled false\nfi\n\nSave the file and exit. Now you have a file with the name \"toggle_touchpad.sh\" \nRun the command chmod +x toggle_touchpad.sh to make the file executable. \nPlace the file in any folder you like. Let us assume that you have it in the folder /home/username/myscripts/. \nFrom the menu on the top-right go to system-settings->keyboard->shortcuts->custom-shortcuts.\nCreate a new shortcut and put as name whatever you want. Put as command /home<username>;/myscripts/toggle_touchpad.sh where \"username\" is your username\nAssign whatever keyboard shortcut you want.\nReady :)\nP.S. Personally I put the file in the /opt/myscripts/ folder but in order to put it there you should run the following commands after creating the file:\nsudo mkdir /opt/myscripts/\n\nsudo mv toggle_touchpad.sh /opt/myscripts/\n\nsudo chown <username>:<username> /opt/myscripts/toggle_touchpad.sh\n\nchmod +x  /opt/myscripts/toggle_touchpad.sh\n\nwhere \"username\" is your username\nThen when you will create the shortcut you will use the path \"/opt/myscripts/toggle_touchpad.sh\" instead of the one mentioned above\n\nA: This method works, but I can't seem to use the \"win\" button.

During setup both monitors functioned without issue, although they were mirroring each other both monitors but as soon as it booted into Unity my secondary monitor stopped working.\nI checked under settings->display and the second monitor doesn't seem to even be detected. On the off chance it had something to do with drivers, I upgraded the proprietary drivers to the latest version with zero success.

After \"sudo reboot now\" I got into the GUI and everything seemed OK. Then went to update manager and found I had 700MB plus of updates to still install. Started installing them, and while update manager was running in the background I attempted to open Firefox.

All I could do was reboot by pressing the reset button, and since that the system only boots into tty1. What now?  \n\nA: to solve the first problem you just need to delete the xorg.conf file \neasily this way (as root):\nsudo rm /etc/X11/xorg.conf\n\nthe system should generate a new one automatically if not used the default one and you probably should install your nvidia card's driver.\n*always make a backup of a file before deleting it (copy contents and save with different name or tag like xorg.conf.backup .e.g) *\nfor the second problem, it happens with nvidia usually if you didn't install the driver or you are using too much desktop effects while you have nvidia card\ncurrently i believe ubuntu 11.x is unstable with nvidia cards so don't pressure it with lots of graphics , 10.X was more stable unfortunately i think i'm gonna switch back to 10\n\n\n*\n\n*if you need me to explain the steps of installing nvidia driver i'll be glad to help\ngood luck\n\n\nA: Ubuntu 11.10 doesn't boot sometimes correctly, showing the user a black screen.

Do you get a login prompt? If so, enter your username and password, plug in an ethernet cable if possible, then enter the following command:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\n\nChances are this command will fail, and recommend a command to fix broken packages. Try that command, and then reboot with\nsudo shutdown -r now\n\nPossible solution\nHold Shift after turning your computer on. You'll be presented a program called GRUB that lets you select and boot different, older OS kernels. Try a few; maybe one will work.\nAnother Possible Solution\nsudo apt-get install lightdm-gtk-greeter\nnote: it took a while for the desktop to load once I got passed the login screen.\nLast resort\nBoot into a live environment (that is, use an Ubuntu LiveCD or LiveUSB) and open the file browser.

But I'm very,\nvery disappointed with the new versions of Unity and Gnome 3\n(gnome-shell), and I really wish they'd be easier to customize.\nTwo simple examples: I really don't want to waste screen estate on\nthe top of my screen, with a menu-bar which is several inches from\nthe program it's supposed to support, and I'd love to have a way\nto easily see which programs are running on my current desktop,\nwithout having to add another panel (this time in the bottom of\nthe screen) -- but I've found no way to change the standard\nbehaviour. I didn't have any of these problems before 'upgrading',\nand I think it's a pity there seems to be no easy way to revert to\nmy old settings.\nI wish this 'uncustomizability' of both Unity and Gnome 3 had been\npointed out to me be before upgrading, and I've actually decided\nto install Kubuntu (inside of 'gubuntu'), just because of it.\n\nA: I had the same problem.\nDid the upgrade from home over vnc over the weekend. Tried to vnc later and couldnt get back onto my box.\nToday I went into work and found that the machine would not boot up. After a while trying to figure it out, thinking that maybe it was a grub problem, i Googled and still didnt find any great solutions.\nI then booted up into a previous kernel and finally got to the command prompt. From there i ran \n\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nwhere I ran into the error telling me to \n\nsudo dpkg --configure -a\n\nafter this completed, i rebooted the machine, no GRUB came up, it just booted correctly into 11.10 Gnome Login Screen.\nEverything seems to be working perfectly now..\n", "Q: Where I can place GTK+ Themes? I've copied all themes to /usr/share/themes but in gnome shell tool I see only system themes. I want to change my window background. System Themes suck! What should I do?\n\n\nA: You must use GTK3 theme, and copy it to /usr/share/themes.\nGTK2 themes are not compatible with GTK3 nor with Unity or with Gnome-Shell in 11.10\n", "Q: Why are there two icons in the Unity launcher for Nautilus? Okay, so I installed Ubuntu 11.10.\nThe thing is, when I click the home folder icon in the launcher (Win + 1), the home folder opens and a new icon appears in the launcher.\nI want the windows to be highlighted in the first icon only if you catch my drift (4th icon).\nI thought if I could remove the first icon and then right-click on the other icon and keep it in the launcher, it may work - but then folders open and the icon remains blank without any indication that a window is open (looks same as first icon).\n\nAlso, the icons numbered from top to bottom exclude the dash icon.\n\nA: According to the bug, you just need to remove the following line from your custom Nautilus launcher (~/.local/share/applications/nautilus-home.desktop):\nOnlyShowIn=GNOME;Unity;\n\nI had this problem and removing that line and logging out and logging back in worked for me.\n\nA: Disclaimer: I am not a Linux programmer, and this answer contains modifying files out of your home folder. It works for me, but do it on your own risk.\nThis problem appears when you configure your Home icon to have a quicklist for your favourite places the way it is described here.\nThe way to solve it, as written on the Bug 842257 page, is instead of creating a copy of /usr/share/applications/nautilus-home.desktop in ~/.local/share/applications and modifying this copy, rather modifying the original file. So the steps are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete the copy, if there is any: ~/.local/share/applications/nautilus-home.desktop\n\n*Open a terminal and write:\ngksu gedit /usr/share/applications/nautilus-home.desktop\n\n\n*Add this text at the bottom of the file, save and close.\nX-Ayatana-Desktop-Shortcuts=Videos;Documents;Music;Pictures;Downloads\n[Videos Shortcut Group]\nName=Videos\nExec=nautilus Videos\nTargetEnvironment=Unity\n\n[Documents Shortcut Group]\nName=Documents\nExec=nautilus Documents\nTargetEnvironment=Unity\n\n[Music Shortcut Group]\nName=Music\nExec=nautilus Music\nTargetEnvironment=Unity\n\n[Pictures Shortcut Group]\nName=Pictures\nExec=nautilus Pictures\nTargetEnvironment=Unity\n\n[Downloads Shortcut Group]\nName=Downloads\nExec=nautilus Downloads\nTargetEnvironment=Unity\n\n\n*Reboot. It should work now, only one icon, with the quicklist.\nIf it still doesn't work, you can try Alt+F2, then run \nunity --reset-icons\n\nThis will reset the icons of the original install on your launchbar, so you will have to repopulate it the way you want.\nFor getting the original nautilus-home.desktop file back, you can reinstall Nautilus and have the default settings and files:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall nautilus\n\n\nA: This is a confirmed bug. Bug 842257\nIt will be fixed at some point. There should only be one icon in the Launcher.\n\nA: I had the same issue. Make sure you don't have a custom nautilus-home.desktop file in ~/.local/share/applications. When I deleted that everything started working again.\nI created one a while ago in 11.04, I guess something has changed in 11.10.\n\nA: Just unlock the file manager from Launcher. Then, open it again from the search icon typing nautilus. Finally, lock it to launcher.\nIt worked for me.\n\nA: The dash icon is not supposed to have a number since it would be redundant. The numbers are there so that you can activate an entry by pressing super+num. For instance, in your case, you would be able to launch and/or switch to Firefox by pressing super+2 and super+3 for the terminal. Launching the dash is done by a simple tap on super. \nI have seen the bug you're referring to, but it was quite some time ago. Have you installed all upgrades? I've also seen that caused by an extension, but I don't remember which it was, but it may have been one to add quicklists. It should not be that way out of the box. Try opening a guest session and I'm sure that problem goes away. Would be nice if you confirmed that though. \n\nA: It is possible to have a custom nautilus-home.desktop file without this problem, as some other answers have mentioned. Another fix (mentioned here: Opening home folder causes another file cabinet icon to appear) is to go to gnome-tweak-tool and set Have file manager handle the desktop to off.\n\nA: The problem is a contradiction in the 'Home Folder' file\n/usr/share/applications/nautilus-home.desktop\nIn the original file this line exists:\nOnlyShowIn=GNOME;Unity;\n\nwhile in quick list it is:\nTargetEnvironment=Unity\n\nThis is solved by changing (TargetEnvironment=Unity) to:\nTargetEnvironment=GNOME;Unity;\n\nworked for me.\n", "Q: How to merge partitions? I have two partitions, one of them has a file system and the other is unallocated.\nHow to merge two partitions?\n\nA: You can use gparted for this. Also installable by sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install gparted\nTo make one big fresh partition (deletes all data on your filesystem):\n\n\n*\n\n*First you'll have to make sure that both the partitions - unallocated\nspace and the other partition to merge are either both logical\npartitions or both primary partitions. One logical and one primary\nwill not work.\n\n*After checking and confirming the first step, delete the partition holding a filesystem.\n\n*Third, the unallocated space is now bigger since you have deleted a partition.\n\n*Create a partition of required size.\nTo increase the size of the partition holding data: (Although this is mostly safe, it's always wise to make a backup of your data!)\n\n\n*\n\n*First you'll have to make sure that both the partitions - unallocated\nspace and the other partition to merge are either both logical\npartitions or both primary partitions. One logical and one primary\nwill not work.\n\n*Second, right-click on the partition in question and click resize. Fill in the size as required.\n\n*Click resize/move and then click Apply all operations\n\n\nA: If the unused partition comes physically after the partition with the filesystem, you can resize the partition on the disk, reboot, and then grow the filesystem (if it was a growable filesystem like ext3, ext4, etc).\nFor example, if you have /dev/sda1 as the filesystem and /dev/sda2 as the unused partition, check the partitions with fdisk /dev/sda:\n# fdisk /dev/sda\n...    \nCommand (m for help): p\n...\n  Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sda1   *          63     8016434     4008186   83  Linux\n/dev/sda2         8016435  1953520064   972751815   83  Linux\n\nYou need to make sure that your new sda1 starts at the same location (here, 63) and ends where sda2 starts (here, 8016434). And double-check that the end of sda1 is immediately before the start of sda2 (here, 8016434 is immediately followed by 8016435) just to be sure.\nThen delete the unused partition and the filesystem partition:\nCommand (m for help): d\nPartition number (1-4): 2\n...\nCommand (m for help): d\nPartition number (1-4): 1\n\nAnd finally, recreate the filesystem partition:\nCommand (m for help): n\nCommand action\n   e   extended\n   p   primary partition (1-4)\np\nPartition number (1-4, default 1): 1\nFirst sector (63-1953520064, default: 63): 63\n...\nLast sector, +sectors or +size{K,M,G} (63-1953520064, default 1953520064): 1953520064\n\nCommand (m for help): t\nPartition number (1-4): 1\nHex code (type L to list codes): 83\n\nAnd make sure you've got what you're expecting:\nCommand (m for help): p\n...\n  Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sda1   *          63  1953520064   976760001   83  Linux\n\nFinally, save it:\nCommand (m for help): w\n\nIf any partitions were mounted on the disk, you'll have to reboot first and then you can grow the filesystem:\n# resize2fs /dev/sda1\n\nBe careful and good luck. Always back up your data first. :)\n", "Q: Are Ubuntu and Gnome drifting apart because of Unity? After upgrading my laptop to 11.10 from 11.04, Gnome was removed entirely, and the interface was Unity when I first logged in.\nUnity underwhelms me entirely. I'm not saying it's bad, I'm sure some people like it. I just don't care enough about it's features to learn how to use it when I'm already so familiar with Gnome.\nI installed Gnome, and I was given three session options at the log in screen. Gnome, Gnome Classic, and Gnome Classic (No Effects).\nGnome (without qualifications) simply does not work. I log in, and I have no menu bars, just a desktop. Right clicking on the screen does nothing. All I can do is press ctrl+alt+del and get out again.\nGnome Classic and Gnome Classic (No Effects) both work, but the appearance is a little messed up. The icons on the top panel have odd sizes and the colours of the panel and the icons don't quite match.\nIt's not a huge problem, but the whole experience is making me feel like Ubuntu is going entirely into Unity, and Gnome, if supported, will always be faltering for lack of official support.\nAre the problems I'm seeing with Gnome symptomatic of Ubuntu's break from Gnome, or can I expect to solve this issues and work with Gnome/Ubuntu as I always have?\n\nA: I had the exact same problems upgrading, so you're not alone :) I have to use GNOME Classic and it reset everything I had before--dismaying, because I had a lot of custom launchers and such at the top. I hope Unity gets better, but I have two different sized monitors and an nvidia card, and I seem to need the computer equivalent of duct tape and twine to get it to work correctly, and Unity acts strangely (and only works in 2D mode).\nSomething that helped me though, in Classic for some reason just right clicking things doesn't let you add launchers or move things like I was previously able. I had to alt+right click. I had another question in about that... so just in case you run into that, save yourself some frantic posting and complaining on G+ about that obnoxious middle clock or whatever else you like to customize :D\n\nA: Gnome has not been removed from 11.10. Unity in 11.04 is based on Gnome2, and in 11.10, on Gnome3. The Gnome you are familiar with (aka Gnome2) is no longer supported by the Gnome Foundation - the decision that has nothing to do with Unity. If you want to try Gnome3's default shell, install the gnome-shell package.\nIf you wish to keep using Gnome2, your best shot is a distro that still supports it, such as Ubuntu 10.04 - 11.04, Scientific Linux, Debian, etc.\n\nA: I would like to say how much I agree with DaveMG (see is text after mine),\nFrankly I do not care what drives what with what technology behind the Gui the desktop or if the thing is now cable of making coffee. What matter is that an update was offered and I downloaded it, it even said that some services would be disable but I would be able to restart them using ... something ...\nBut after I rebooted I had a new interface and that means that before I can finish my assignments I would now have to learn a new 'shell' what ever that is.\nI installed Ubuntu SPECIFICALLY because it is described as a O/S for users NOT developers. The computer is TOOL for me not a toy to marvel at its new prowess.\nSo I decided to reboot and load my old 11.04 with all my desktop the way I am used to. But I can't!! When I reboot I am stuck with this new 'Shell'!!\nSo here is the point I am a consultant when I do not deliver the work to my client I do not get paid: Today I will not get paid since I was unable to produce anything, thanks to this upgrade that forces something (useless) down the throat of the user. If someone somewhere in this Linux universe wants to have users move from MS or Apple to Linux you will HAVE to stop sticking it to the users. Some people use their computer to be productive.\nAny one would have a solution for me? Anyone understand my point? (and I certain that I am not alone). I simply do not want to have to re-learn how to drive every time I want to go to the grocery store.\n'With respect, I think you're so close to the issue, you can't quite see the forest for the trees. Whether Unity is built on Gnome or not is kind of irrelevant to me. What's relevant to me is that I was comfortable with the interface I had before Unity came along. The Unity interface just does not add enough benefit for me to take on the learning curve of figuring out where everything is. I want an interface that I am familiar with, and my issue is that no currently supported version of Gnome or Unity or whatever else offers it.'\n\nA: Ubuntu has never been a complete Gnome distribution. We've used OpenOffice instead of Gnome Office, Firefox instead of Ephiphany, etc. Most of the desktop is still Gnome though, even if we've not also replaced the email client with Mozillas Thunderbird. 11.04 was a special release because Gnome 3 was released only weeks before Ubuntu was released. That wasn't enough time to make the transition, so things like Gnome Shell was not available. It was always the intention to move back towards upstream Gnome, which has happened in 11.10. \nYou say that Gnome was removed in the upgrade to 11.10, but that's not true if you got the Unity desktop, since that is Gnome 3. Gnome Panel 2 is not available in upstream Gnome anymore. There is something called Gnome Panel 3, which is available in Ubuntus repositories, but it's not the same. In other words, you talk about \"Ubuntus break from Gnome\", but the contrary is true. Ubuntu has never been more in tune with Gnome than it is today. Sticking to the old Gnome, which you seem to suggest, would have been to break with Gnome. \n\"or can I expect to solve this issues and work with Gnome/Ubuntu as I always have?\"\nGnome 2 is gone. There is a little talk about forking Gnome 2, but it's unlikely that it'll be a success since the technology it's based on is horribly outdated and hence doesn't attract developers. If you want a more similar experience, then you can have a look at Xubuntu, which uses Xfce. It's also possible to add Xfce panels to your Unity desktop if you want to have a taskbar, etc. \nIf you are experiencing problems with Gnome Shell, it's likely that it's because of driver issues. Gnome Shell works really well in 11.10. If I were you, I would boot a live 11.10 session, install Gnome Shell and see if it works there. People who added Gnome Shell to 11.04 can expect difficulties when upgrading to 11.10. Gnome Shell and Unity are based on different technologies. Unity is based on Compiz and Gnome Shell is based on Mutter. This can lead one shell to work well where the other does not. But Unity has the advantage of a second implementation that doesn't depend as much on the graphics adapter. \n\nA: Short answer: Yes.\nBut Ubuntu is still using Gnome, just with Unity on top. Gnome is touting their own Gnome Shell, which is kind of the same but different.\n\nA: Gnome-shell does not support ATI drivers, if you are using them. Probably why its not working properly. (The new catalyst 11.9 work)\n\nA: I rather think, Dave, that you are stuck with a new interface, thanks to the increasing popularity of touch-screen interfaces. Windows 8 has also jumped on the bandwagon -- see YouTube for previews.\nWhich interface you prefer is a matter of opinion, of course. However, your learning curve for Unity will be short. It took me all of 30 minutes to find my way around it.\nHere is a useful learning link.\nhttp://castrojo.tumblr.com/post/4795149014/the-power-users-guide-to-unity\nI know this does not answer your question directly (others have done a great job of doing that), but this should give some aid.\n", "Q: World of goo is not in Ubuntu Software Centre? I bought world of goo about 1 year ago and I wanted to install it again on Oneiric Ocelot but it seems that it's not available anymore.\nSo, can someone confirm this?

However I did find it by going to File -> Reinstall previous purchases... in the Software Centre.\n\nA: Make sure you have all the sources of software available, even the Partner.\nYou can do that with Synaptic, but you need yo install it. Or in the Update Manager, clicking below in Configuration.\n", "Q: Ubuntu One - Synch or Backup Either I am not getting something or a lot of folks are not understanding the difference between sync and backup. This can be quite dangerous. My understanding of synching is that you are basically mirroring. Lets say you sync a folder on your hard drive with a folder on the web. This means that if you add files to your folder on the hard drive that it will be added to the folder on the web. This is great. The danger here though is that if somehow files are lost from the folder on the local drive then they are removed from the folder on the web. Remember this is synching NOT BACKING UP.\nA backup on the other hand, of the same situation, means that if a file is deleted from your local drive it would still be available in the web folder.\nUbuntu One seems to only offer synching NOT backing up. Using third part utilities such as deja Dup Backup Tool. \nBesides this backup tool does anyone know if you can FTP or another utility to upload/backup to Ubuntu One? If so what are the settings (URL/URI/address) for Ubuntu One?\n\nA: I'm not 100% certain whether you are saying Deja Dup syncs or backs up, but to clarify, it will create a real backup like you want.  It just uses Ubuntu One's cloud storage to store it's formatted backup files.\nThere are a couple ways to upload/download directly to/from Ubuntu One:\n\n\n*\n\n*There's the web site itself which lets you upload and download files manually.\n\n*There's a web API that lets you upload and download files programatically.  There's a tutorial and sample script explaining how.  (This is what Deja Dup does behind the scenes.)\n\n", "Q: Precautions to take when installing Ubuntu on a laptop and moving the HDD to a headless server? I have no monitor and I'm planning to do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Ubuntu server on laptop.\n\n*Move HDD to headless server (hoping it will work).\n\n\nIs there anything I should worry about?\nI imagine that I need to check /etc/fstab to make sure that the right HDD is mounted on startup because on the laptop it might have a different name than on the server.\n\nA: Nope, don't think you'll need to modify fstab. Partitions are mounted by their UUIDs, not by names, so, no problems there. If there are several HDD (physical hard disk devices) on the server, you may need to reinstall GRUB.\n\nA: You shouldn't use device names for filesystems in /etc/fstab. You should use UUIDs instead. That way, the system will work fine if /dev/sda3 becomes /dev/sdb3 for instance. In any case, if this is a single-disk system, it won't matter at all, as long as the BIOS knows which disk to boot from. You may want to setup a static  IP address, though, since the new network interface will probably mean you'll get a different IP address. Other than that, I don't think you should have any problems just moving the disk. \n\nA: Also, I think the new network card will get a different interface name, so it would be a good idea to prepare for that. For example add auto eth1 and iface eth1 inet dhcp to /etc/netork/interfaces, if you have an eth0 named interface in your notebook, and you want your headless server to get an IP via DHCP.\n", "Q: Software centre \"Failed to download package\"? I installed ubuntu 11.10 and started with the software center. At first no software had the install option so I chose \"Use the source\".

But XUbuntu 11.10 understands the wireless switch and disables all the WiFi modules, including the PCMCIA one.\nHow to disable the built-in one without disabling the PCMCIA one in this case?\nI don't want to have both of them (as I do now). Would be cool If I could switch them on and off easily and in an instant, as I can do in Windows.\n\nA: You could try unloading the module (I believe that card uses iwlwifi iwlagn): \nsudo rmmod iwlagn \n\nI've just checked, and it definitely works here with the BCM4312, wl module.\nTo bring it back up, use\nsudo modprobe iwlagn\n\nSince you wanted to permanently disable the built in wireless NIC, one way to do this is by blacklisting the supporting module. since Intel chipset is supported by the iwlagn driver, you can blacklist iwlang. Run:\ngksu gedit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\n\nAdd this line to the file:\nblacklist iwlagn\n\nSave the file and quit the text editor.\nNow, even on reboot this module will not be loaded.\n\nA: Usually there is an option to disable builtin components in BIOS setup.

The other part of the problem is that you need the 1.1.12 version of VLC to make it work correctly with the new version of Pulseaudio.

As I understand it, in Ubuntu 11.04 setting the AutoHide setting on Compiz Config - Unity (see here) not only hid the launcher but prevented the launcher from influencing window placement.\nHowever, since updating to Ubuntu 11.10 when I open a new window it gets indented the space of the launcher.

I've just opened chromium and the window is indented by the width of the launcher. \n\n\nA: If you want all your windows to be initially placed in the top left corner, the follow settings in ccsm > Place Windows makes it work for me: in the fixed window placement tab, add an entry for Windows with fixed positions and set the type to any, x to -1, y to 48 and untick keep in workarea.

It then says reboot, and the machine says 'inserts a boot disk' which means the hard disk isn't bootable. The primary hard disk is an EFI device, and nothing seems to work.\nThe machine in question is an Acer Aspire M3970 desktop. Core i5 2300, with 8Gb Ram. Main boot drive is an SSD (Vertex 2E 60Gb). I am trying to install the 11.10 x64 version. The installation I have tried from CD and USB stick. It goes through the install, allows you to partition the drives then installs all the packages. At the end it goes for a reboot, and asks you to remove the installation media. \nThe PC then restarts and says no bootable disk. I tried it many times. In the end I have installed Fedora 15 x64 which works straight away with no messing. Unless this issues is fixed I have to drop 11.10 as a viable option.\nFrom my experience F15 isn't quite as polished as Ubuntu, but in this case - it works!!\nIs this a widespread problem or am I unique?\n\nA: The problem is the EFI does not recognise the bootloader and even though GRUB is installed it is not able to run correctly due to not being able to be read from the MBR.\nI found a solution on Ubuntu Forums that hopefully will solve your issue and get your installation working.\n\nSOLUTION 1) GPT partitioning seemed to be a problem for the Ubuntu\n  installer. I took the SSD disk out of the PC, plugged it to another PC\n  with a SATA-to-USB adapter and created a normal partition table on it\n  without any of the non-working GPT crap. I created the partitions as\n  follows (with cfdisk, gparted also works):\n1: FAT32 partition for the EFI bootloader. I set this to 500 MB size\n  and formatted it with mkfs.vfat. 2: / (root) partition (ext4). 3:\n  /home partition (ext4).\nI use no swap on computers like this that have 16 - 32 GB of RAM.\n2) I kept the SSD disk plugged to the other PC with the SATA-to-USB\n  adapter and mounted the FAT16 EFI partition. I created a folder\n  efi/grub under it with the command \"mkdir -p efi/grub\".\n3) Now the disk was ready for installation. I put the SSD disk back to\n  the new PC, booted up Ubuntu installation from the USB disk and\n  installed it as usual, formatting / and /home as ext4 in the process.\nSUCCESS!!! The PC boots in about 10-15 seconds like you'd expect from\n  an SSD disk. The network card on this motherboard works on Ubuntu\n  11.10 out-of-the-box as well. 10.04 doesn't seem to recognise it, 11.04 I'm not sure.\nMy advice to others reading Ubuntu's EFI/UEFI instructions: Do NOT\n  start recompiling GRUB or other more complicated stuff. It is\n  completely unnecessary.\nThe instructions are outdated for 11.10 and just creating the FAT\n  partition with a folder efi/grub is enough for Ubuntu to automatically\n  recognise and install the bootloader there. Ubuntu 11.10 already has a\n  working GRUB for EFI systems, you do NOT need to compile one yourself,\n  at least not for the Asus EZ.\nSo, in short: create the partitions on a non-EFI system, mkdir 2\n  folders and install. If I only knew from the start that it was this\n  simple.\n\nReference\nAlthough this references removing the drive from the PC other threads have not removed the drive, used the same method and had success - good luck and let us know how it goes.\n\nA: I have had a similar problem on my hardware with assorted versions of Ubuntu.  It is not that the disk unbootable it was that the boot loader did not recognize the disk to boot from.\nSo when that machine is booting (right at the very earliest stages after power on) I get the prompt to \"Press F8 to select boot media\".  I press F8.\nThat displays a menu of available devices, I select the device on which I installed the OS and then continue.  It boots fine and works great.\nBTW, I convinced myself this is yet another layer of security (layers are good regardless of how thin) as someone else trying to boot my machine will not succeed unless they know this trick!  ;-)\n", "Q: gnome-panel messed up after installing ATI driver After installing the proprietary ati driver, the gnome-panel in the gnome3 shell is completely messed up. uninstalling the driver doesn't work, any ideas?\n\nA: I managed to install the 11.9 driver manually what overwrites the driver (11.8).

I installed it 'over the top' of 11.04 - that is, not through the update dialogue, and it worked fine.\nI decided to make my launcher icons smaller, so opened CCSM, and clicked the second choice down in the left hand pane (didn't alter any settings) and it crashed completely.  I had to hold the power button, and when I restarted it, all I have visible anywhere is a File Edit View menu across the top, and my Spotify icon on the desktop.  Nothing to log in, log out, nothing visible anywhere, no application menu, no launcher, nothing.\nI'm at a loss as to what to try.  I can open a terminal, but I have tried (perhaps incorrectly) to close and restart both Nautilus and Unity, and neither did anything (assuming I was doing it right)\nAny thoughts, or shall I reinstall?\n\nA: Looks like the Compiz Unity plugin is accidentally deselected. Press Ctrl + Alt + T and type unity --replace and you would have your Unity back. Alternatively, if you have CompizConfig Settings Manager (CCSM) installed in your computer, you can type ccsm in Terminal and run the program. There, under the desktop heading, you can select 'Ubuntu Unity plugin' and your Unity would be back to normal.\n\nA: You can remove compiz config files from home directory: ~/.config/compiz. That worked for me. \n\nA: I booted into recovery mode and fixed broken packages.  This worked for me.\n\nA: I think this problem is connected to the graphic drives. When I install the proprietary drivers (ATI), it seems to work - but Gnome Shell is horrible. I on the other hand can't install the post release ATI drivers, I get a message that something is wrong with  /var/log/jockey.log\nI wait for the fix of that bug (?) - when I uninstalled the proprietary drivers, both Unity and Shell was not accessible to me.\nEDIT: After a long try I got back to \"radeon\" and everything seems to work more or less.\n\nA: I will have to agree Extender. I had this issue and removing the compiz config files fixed it. \ncd ~/.config/compiz..\nrm -rf compizconfig/\nwill remove the files and directories. Your computer will probably lock up for a few moments then everything should kick back to right where it was. \n\nA: First, try the post from my blog to see if resetting the gnome panels fixes it.\nhttp://dageek247.tk/wordpress/?p=76\nIf you use unity, instead look at this blog post:\nhttp://www.webupd8.org/2011/04/how-to-reset-unity-launcher-icons-or.html\nNext, try installing the proprietary drivers for your system to see if that works.\nhttp://www.ubunturoot.com/2011/09/installing-latest-proprietary-display.html\nLast, try formating the partition and trying again.\n\nA: If nothing else works, you can disable the Compiz Unity plugin while unloading and loading other plugins (clearing and removing their checkmarks).\nIt seems to be a bug specifically in Unity.\n", "Q: Okular stuck on \"Reloading a PDF document\" After upgrading from Ubuntu 11.04 to 11.10 and Okular seems to be not working properly. When I open a pdf document, it says 'Reloading the document ...' again and again and an hour glass is shown. The problem is intermittent and happened with the following pdf. Has anyone had similar experience?\n\nA: I downloaded your pdf and I can confirm that Okular has no problems opening it. However, there's a nice feature in Okular that makes it to reload a document whenever the file on disk is changed. \nYou can reproduce this by opening a terminal window and issuing\ntouch filename.pdf\n\nwhile the same file is open in Okular. Or even\n while [ true ]; do touch filename.pdf; sleep 3; done\n\nthis will cause Okular to reload the document repeatedly.\nI'm not quite sure what was \"touching\" the file in your case - do you have this file synced with Ubuntu One or Dropbox? Maybe some backup program? \nHowever, the power of KDE is in the amount of knobs programs have :) If it ever bothers you again, go to Settings - Configure Okular - General and un-tick \"Reload document on file change\" \nIn you're curious, you can install inotify-tools package which contains command-line tools to monitor file modification messages from kernel's inotify module. You can monitor file change notifications with\ninotifywait -m filename.pdf\n\n", "Q: Touchpad gets disabled after sometime after login I upgraded from Natty to Oneiric and use a external logitech mouse. When I login with both the touchpad and mouse enabled, the touchpad works fine. But if I continue using the mouse for sometime, and then try to use the touchpad it does not work. It is as if it is disabled for power saving.\nI do not use any touchpad-indicator or tweak any settings. This did not happen when I was running natty.\nHow can I solve this? Do I submit a bug report? \n\nA: There is a setting that disables the touchpad while you are using your keyboard that you can turn off.  I'm not sure whether that's likely to be related or not.  You can find that in the settings thing names Mouse and Trackpad.\nI had similar issues initially with my computer until I rebooted a few times but now it seems to work okay.\n", "Q: What is this install icon on the launcher on my installed system? I'm using the 11.10 version since the RC which I used to update every time an update is issued. The final release is now out and I still see the \"Install RELEASE\" icon on the dock. If I install all the updates the normal way (through the update manager) what would be my system status: the final release or just an updated RC? Do I have to re-launch the installer from that icon to get the release (knowing that I'll have to re-do every step the installer requires)?\nHere is an amateur made screenshot of the icon I'm talking about:\n\nIf I'm missing something please guide me. Thanks.\n\nA: You should not have the Install icon anywhere on the installed system, regardless of whether it was a beta, an RC or the final release. The installer and associated packages are usually removed at the end of installation.\nTry removing ubiquity with\nsudo apt-get purge ubiquity*\n\nUbiquity is the Ubuntu installer. Instead of being removed, for reasons unknown, it must have been retained after the installation. Removing its packages manually seems to be a logical step.\n", "Q: How to set up a second display to be 1280x1024 if ARandR only suggests 1024x768 as a maximum? After creating a xorg.conf I've got able (there was a nasty bug in confless mode: always overlaying the second display over the first instead of using the second physical screen) to set up a second display (a DSUB-attached classic 17-inch panel) with ARandR (under XUbuntu 11.10) on Intel GMA X4500MHD (a Dell E5500 laptop). But the maximum resolution appearing in it's menu (for this particular display) is 1024x768 while its native resolution is 1280x1024. How to fix this?\nI use to switch between different external monitors (with different characteristics) and working without any some times, so I'd like to avoid any hardcoding. But, if it is hardly  possible to make the thing detect supported resolutions correctly, I'd be glad to know how to add them manually (the way meant to work if the monitor is physically capable of a resolution specified, though not advertising it correctly).\n\nA: Try to use disper to extend your desktop to an external screen. \ndisper -e extends to an external screen, disper -s deactivates it. Now when extending to your external monitor you can use extra options like: \n--resolution= [1600x900,1280x1024] \n--direction=  [left,right,top or bottom]\n--displays=   [auto or list of displays] \n\nand give the two resolutions for the two screens, the relative position and the type of view - please refer for details to man disper. \nI am using different external screens and already with the plain disper -e, disper -s commands everything is set and (native) resolutions are automatically detected.\n", "Q: How can I configure MS Exchange 2007 in Thunderbird? I've just upgraded to Ubuntu 11.10 which has Thunderbird as default mail client.\nIn Evolution I can configure it for using it with MS Exchange 2007, is that possible with Thunderbird too?\n\nA: Only if you have an IMAP exposed on Exchange.\n\nA: Exchange MAPI support is available for Evolution but it is a dog in my opinion, much work to be done in order to implement in most Exchange scenarios. I imagine maybe compiling yourself would yield better results...\nI have Thunderbird 9.x working very well using DavMail Gateway: http://davmail.sourceforge.net. For the most part its documentation and setup instructions are pretty thorough. It uses CalDav/CardDav to pull/push calendar and contacts from exchange using EWS/OWA and localhost as the gateway.\nI have it pulling contacts via LDAP directory that I setup in Tbird. The details are a little vague on that - you need to know your Base DN, CN and OU's which are different between Exchange Editions like Standard and Small Business Server so keep that in mind.\nIf you need help beyond the setup and configuration docs, let me know and I can help you... Maybe, some people's systems just can't be helped :p\nCheers.\n\nA: If you cannot open IMAP port, you should try CalDav, that access to Outlook Web and give IMAP and SMTP protocol to standard apps.\n", "Q: How to set up XFCE4 XKB plugin to remember settings over reboots? Following this answer I've installed xfce - xfce4-xkb-plugin to indicate and switch keyboard layouts in XUbuntu. But it resets all the settings (languages I use and a switch layouts hotkey) every time I reboot. How to make it to remember?\n\nA: As the best previous answer appears to be commented afterwards by the user as not working anymore, I will give here an updated perfected version of a quite successful workaround. Sorry not to be able to provide a more scientific less empirical approach, I am not an advanced user, just had the luck to get what I want in this case and want to share this, maybe as a temporary patchwork. So, bare with me.\nI use Xubuntu, maybe some instructions are limited to that.\nMy solution is this (my case is English-US as default, second French, third Romanian standard - replace accordingly):\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Setting Manager > Keyboard > Layout, and set the languages in the preferred order (delete them and add them in order to achieve this). Go to the properties of the xkb plugin and make the same settings in the same order with the same default language.\n\n*Open the file\n$HOME/.config/xfce4/xfconf/xfce-perchannel-xml/keyboard-layout.xml\nEdit it to look similar to this.\n\n*Open the file\n$HOME/.config/xfce4/panel/xkb-plugin-##.rc\n(replace ## with appropriate number).\nEdit it to look similar to this.\n\n*Open the file\n/etc/default/keyboard\n(as root)\nEdit it accordingly:\nXKBMODEL=\"pc105\"\nXKBLAYOUT=\"us,fr,ro\"\nXKBVARIANT=\",,std\"\nXKBOPTIONS=\"grp:alt_shift_toggle\"\n\nMaybe not all these are necessary to make it work, but just in case...\n\nA: This is a known bug. I use xfce in arch linux and what I do is edit the ~/.config/xfce4/panel/xkb-plugin-##.rc and add a new line or something and it works for some sessions. Another temporary fix may be what #31 suggests\n1. Set the desired options in the plugin\n2. Copy the ~/.config/xfce4/panel/xkb-plugin-##.rc to some other file e.g. ~/.config/xfce4/panel/goodxkb.rc\n3. Add this command to a startup job:\n\n     sh -c \"cp ~/.config/xfce4/panel/goodxkb.rc ~/.config/xfce4/panel/xkb-plugin-##.rc && pkill xkb\"\n    (change the ## to your number)\n\nThe pkill part is crucial to reload the plugin and its config.\n\nA: Just edit your /etc/default/keyboard the way you want. The Xfce language indicator will then work correctly and the settings will not be forgotten.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Xfce Settings Manager => Keyboard => Layout. Here you have to make sure there is a tick next to \"Use System Defaults\". If you don't tick this, then you have to make sure that the languages selected here are exactly the same, and in exactly the same order as in /etc/default/keyboard and the Xfce language indicator.\n\n*sudo nano /etc/default/keyboard\n\n*For example, if you want to be able to switch between English, Esperanto, German and Russian, make the following alterations (leave everything else as it is):\nXKBLAYOUT=\"gb,epo,de,ru\"\nXKBVARIANT=\",,,phonetic\"\nXKBOPTIONS=\"grp:alt_caps_toggle\"\n\nIn the XKBLAYOUT section, make sure that you do not enter any spaces between the languages, otherwise the text will not be displayed correctly in language indicator in the Xfce panel.\nIn the above example, the phonetic version of the Russian keyboard is being used, which is defined by the XKBVARIANT. The three commas are in front of the word \"phonetic\" as they tell the system that no variant is required for the three other preceding languages.\nXKBOPTIONS defines the shortcut for switching between the languages. In this case, it is Alt + Caps Lock. \n\n*Save the changes. In Nano, you do this by pressing Ctl + x, followed by y and then hit Enter.\n\n*Reboot your computer for the changes to take effect.\nFor information about what other variables can be placed in the file /etc/default/keyboard, enter the following in the terminal: cat /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/xorg.lst. Here you can see the language codes, the types of variants, and also the shortcuts that can be used.\nThe Debian wiki also contains information about configuring the keyboard, and the XKB Configuration Guide is very useful too (it contains some excellent examples).\n\nA: Xubuntu 12.04. I could get the shortcut remembered using the following actions: \n\n\n*\n\n*\"Settings > Settings Manager > Keyboard > Layout\" and uncheck the 'Use system defaults' in order to add new layouts;\n\n*Go to the xfce4-xkb-plugin properties and set the short cut (I use Ctrl+Shift);\n\n*Go back to \"Settings > Settings Manager > Keyboard > Layout\" and check the 'Use system defaults' (no worries, the keyboards added will be preserved).\nThis has survived 2 logouts/logins and one reboot, so far. \n\nA: Another solution is to use Debian's built-in tools : \n\n\n*\n\n*Settings -> input method switcher -> set to default\n\n*Remove xfce4-xkb-plugin from the panel\n\n*Run the command: sudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration and choose the needed keyboard layout and hot key for switching\n\n*Reboot\n\n*Add xfce4-xkb-plugin to the panel if you wish\n\n\nA: add this to autostart(can customize, sample settings from my dotfiles):\nxfconf-query -c keyboard-layout -pn /Default/XkbDisable -t 'bool' -s false\nxfconf-query -c keyboard-layout -pn /Default/XkbOptions/Group -t 'string' -s \"grp:alt_shift_toggle\"\nxfconf-query -c keyboard-layout -pn /Default/XkbModel -t 'string' -s \"chromebook_m_ralt\"\nxfconf-query -c keyboard-layout -pn /Default/XkbLayout -t 'string' -s \"us,ua,ru\"\nxfconf-query -c keyboard-layout -pn /Default/XkbVariant -t 'string' -s \",,\"\n\n\nA: Menu -> Settings -> Settings Manager\nSession and Startup\nCheck: Automatically save session on logout\n\nA: I resolved this problem by adding on my .bashrc file this line:\nsetxkbmap -option grp:ctrl_shift_toggle\n\nEverything work well now.\n", "Q: How do I open a new window in the same monitor? I have 2 monitors and using Oneiric Ocelot Ubuntu. If I have opened firefox on my first monitor and want open new window, new window is always opened on the  second monitor. How I can set using 1 monitor in the application? Thanks.\n\nA: Just start firefox with\nfirefox --display=:0.0\n\nWhere 0.0 corresponds to the display you want to open. Probably you have the first display as 0.0 and the second as 0.1. If you have nVidia then you can open the NVIDIA X Server Settings panel to see which number corresponds to which monitor.\n\nA: I have the same problems many windows (normals and dialog windows) open in the other monitor, but I solved this with the plugin \"place window\" from the CompizConfig.\nIn the general tab, I used this configuration:\nWorkarounds (check)\nPositioning mode: centered\nMulti Output Mode: Use Output Device with Pointe\nAnd the most important\nForcing the window positioning : (type=Dialog) | type=Normal\nNow all windos appear in the center of the monitor active or the where the pointer is.\n", "Q: How can I update pgadmin3 to v1.14?

Especially if you play it on an entirely new OS (which isn't even officially supported), it is normally better to start of with a default installation.\n\nA: I had the same issue. Yet I can only provide a workaround.\nThis issue only occurs if you are trying to start WoW in opengl mode via Battle.net launcher.

I updated it and now when i go to shutdown it stucks at Ubuntu logo (the one with the white small balls). I waited 20 mins and nothing, i always have to shutdown by holding the power button.\nAny suggestions? Thanks :)\n\nA: As I noted in comment, in my case it was related to bug 875959, so a network-manager issue.\nTry this command before shutting down:\nsudo service network-manager stop\n\nWorked for me.\n\nA: Do you have mounted samba shares?  I've found if I don't unmount them before I shutdown or reboot, my system hangs.\n\nA: Having this problem also very rarely. Seems it shows up after certain updates have been installed. If it happens, I'm just giving it some time just to be on the safe side (took a long time for the first shutdown after installing gnome3/gnome-shell), then I reboot with Alt Sysreq REISUB . Next shutdown(s) are usually fine again after that.\n\nA: I also have the same problem. And I tried everything I can think of, like update-grub, remove samba.\nBut after I removed the AMD/ATI additional driver, that never happens again. So I think this is caused by some bugs in additional driver.\n\nA: Same problem here.\nStopping network-manager won't help.\nIt is maybe related to an rpcbind issue (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/rpcbind/+bug/844317?comments=all)\nas on shutdown I get:\nrpcbind: rpcbind terminating on signal. Restart with \"rpcbind -w\"\n\nSometimes the kernel fail to kill all remaining processes, some other times it succeeds, however the system is not powered off and I need to either hold the power off button or press Alt+SysRq+B to reboot. \n\nA: Try to change the init level (order) of the network manager during shutdown and maybe solve the issue?   In the init config, the order of shutodown of services is defined ( I think).  Its possible you could change the order so the network manager stops first during shutdown?\n\nA: Happens to me sometimes. It might have been a coincidence, the way I solved it, but when I took the computer from my room to the living-room and then back again, when I unplugged the power supply, I accidentally touched the power supply cord's end. I got a nasty shock... My hand was feeling a bit numb. The cord's end is the two metallic pins you plug onto the socket.\nStrangely, when I turned the computer on, worked a bit and turned it off, I was with my finger on the shutdown button, thinking that I would have to manually shut it down.\n4 seconds later, the computer shutdown.\nConclusion: It might be that your computer is overcharged with electricity.

What I did was make one partition (12 GB) for the Ubuntu system (called \"/\") and the rest of the disk (aside from a small swap partition) as my /home partition.

It helped me, and I think it will work for you as well.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: A restoration method suggestion from an inexperienced user:\nI installed 11.04 using the Ubuntu windows installer \"wubi\" so that I could use \"Acronis True Image\" to restore 11.04 in the event a Ubuntu update or upgrade failure trashed my system.  My system was rendered usless about 15 minutes ago after I attempted to install the 11.10 upgrade. I shut down, booted XP ran Windows Explorer and deleted the C:\\wubildr, C:\\wubildr.mbr files and the C:\\Ubuntu folder.  Then I used Acronis to restore those files and the Ubuntu folder.  Then rebooted.  Ubuntu 11.04 was restored and running in about 6 minutes.  So I don't feel so bad about the attempted upgrade failing.  I will try upgrading again after a couple of weeks and perhaps the bugs will be sorted out by them\nI have done this several times after a failed update or upgrade.

Just upgraded to 11.10, and prompted me to wondering where is now the preferred way to put customised .bashrc bits?\nI have some aliases, some env variables, and a python virtualenvwrapper script, for instance, which I want to run as part of my .bashrc.  I have these synced in a script across machines stored in Dropbox.\nI used to put them at the bottom of .bashrc, and then I put them in a file called .bash_profile which it sourced, but now I see that .bashrc no longer sources .bashrc_local (did it ever or did I customise this?), and I note that it sources .bash_aliases and .bash_completion.\nSo I've decided as it's non existent at the mo to put the stuff in .bash_aliases, as it seems cleanest to have my customisations in a separate file to the default.\nI got scared off .profile as it already has stuff in it.\nI realise what I'm doing works, but it seems a bit counter intuitive to be putting these things in a file called aliases when it's not all aliases.\nIs this the correct place for this?\n\nA: Startup scripts are a bit of a maze, aren't they?\nI believe that it basically works out that .profile is executed for login shells -- i.e., what you'd get if you login remotely -- and .bashrc is used for non-login shells, assuming you're using bash. .profile sources .bashrc, so in general you'd put stuff you always use in .bashrc, like additions to the default path and other environment settings. I believe the general convention in *nix systems and bash is to do most of the customization in .bashrc; I haven't seen .bash_aliases on Red Hat-family Linux distributions or the Unix systems I've used. I don't remember ever seeing a .bash_local.\nThe way .bash_aliases is sourced seems like a good model, so it might be tidier to do your customizations in another file, adding this to the end of .bashrc:\n# Local customized path and environment settings, etc.\nif [ -f ~/.bash_local ]; then\n    . ~/.bash_local\nfi\n\nIt can be helpful to look at /etc/skel, where the default user scripts are that are copied to new users' home directories, and at /etc/profile and /etc/bash.bashrc, which are system-wide defaults.\nI think the underlying assumption to all of this is that the user can do as the user pleases with personal copies of .profile, .bashrc, etc., so no presumptions are made about what is or is not in them.\n\nA: I suspect .bashrc_local is an invention of yours. Me too have something similar, with an expression like this in ~/.bashrc\nif [[ -r ~/.bashrc_local ]]; then\n    . ~/.bashrc_local\nfi\n\nbut I put in this file only customization specific to the given machine, and let the customization common to all my machines in ~/.bashrc, synced in some way.\n", "Q: Module nvidia_173 not found I just did a fresh ubuntu 11.10 install on my laptop, but i cannot manage to start the graphic mode.\nWhen the laptop boots it gets stuck after the loading screen.\nI tried to Ctrl-Alt-F1, log in and start manually the X server, but i get this error:\nFATAL: Module nvidia_173 not found.    \n(EE) NVIDIA(0): Failed to load the NIVIDIA kernel module!\n\nThe module is installed of course, and i tried also to reinstall nvidia-current.\nI already tried following same thread on this issue, but nothing seems to work for me.\nAnyone knows a valid solution?\nThanks.\n\nA: Try reinstalling the nvidia-173 module:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall nvidia-173\n\nand reboot\nThat worked for me!!\n\nA: Make sure the MBR is pointing to the upgraded kernel, initrd, etc.  I use EasyBCD to triple boot, so when the upgrade to 11.10 cam last night and X wouldn't start this morning, it took a while before I realized I had to update the NeoGRUB file to point it from 2.6.35-22 to 3.0.0-12.  After doing that, everything is perfect.\n\nA: I had the same issue and reinstalling nvidia-173 worked for me also.\nMore details for new users:\nWhen booting, the symptoms are: you see a list of events with [OK] or [fail], and then nothing further happens.  I had several [fail], apparently unrelated.  Linux has tried to start X windows (the graphics display) and failed, quietly.  Now if you enter Ctrl-Alt-F1, Linux starts a terminal (a non-graphical command line.)  Linux is running, just without graphics.  You can examine the file /var/log/Xorg.0.log to find the error: (EE) NVIDIA(0): Failed to load the NIVIDIA kernel module!\nThen, enter as described earlier:\n$ sudo apt-get install --reinstall nvidia-173\n\nNote it is not just install, but a --reinstall.  Linux downloads it from the net, compiles it and installs it. Then reboot.\nThen Ubuntu should start.  I got an alert that new proprietary drivers were available.  I started System Settings>Harware>Additional Drivers.  It showed that a \"version current\" was the recommended version but that \"version 173\" was installed.  I don't think it matters (both seem to fully use the graphics card) but I chose \"version current\" and the \"Activate\" button.  Then restarted.  That version (whatever it is?) also seems to work.  \nPossibly you can forestall the alert that new drivers are available by installing \"nvidia-current\" the first time?\n\nA: I did this and got to the login page, but I cannot log in. I see an NVIDIA logo and then get back to the lightdm. \nI have tried with nvidia-173 and nvidia-current, and using nvidia-xconfig, but nothing. I believe my laptop has a GeForce 8400 and it's a Dell XPS M1530.\nis this reported anywhere?\n\nA: You should find there is another package called something like nvidia-current-upgrades visible to \"restricted drivers\" GUI or the jockey command line interface. Try installing/activating this. Worked for me.\n\nA: I have a pretty good solution for you.\npress\nCtrl+Alt+F1. After that login with your username and password. After that type wget http://us.download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86/285.05.09/NVIDIA-Linux-x86-285.05.09.run. Wait for the download to complete, after that type chmod 777 NVIDIA-Linux-x86-285.05.09.run. After that type service lightdm stop and then sh NVIDIA-Linux-x86-285.05.09.run. Follow the instructions, restart if needed, and after restarting your PC you will have latest NVIDIA driver and a good-working graphic card.\n\nA: Since reinstalling nvidia-173 didn't work for me, I'm going to tell you how I solved this issue. I added a repository with the last version of the NVidia drivers. Here it says you have to add the swat-x ppa:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current\nThis worked for me today when I was installing Kubuntu 11.10 in a Macbook Pro.\n", "Q: How to change the shortcut to move windows from Alt to Super/Meta? I use graphics software like GIMP, Inkscape & Blender extensively for my business. But most of them require the use of the Alt key in some way or the other. Come Ubuntu 11.10, I haven't been able to find any way to change the shortcut for window moving/resizing from Alt+LMB/MMB to Super/Meta+LLM/MMB. This option was present in the 'Windows' settings in Gnome2, but it is not present anywhere in Gnome3. And yes, I have tried searching through the Shortcuts tab in Keyboard settings, its not there.\n\nA: *\n\n*Install compizconfig-settings-manager.\n\n\n*Open CompizConfig Settings Manager and navigate to the Resize Window plugin.\n\n\n*Click the <Super>Button2 button and rebind the shortcut.\n\n\nA: In Ubuntu 13.10 this worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) and type sudo apt-get install dconf-editor.

I was installing ubuntu alongside with win 7, and I devoted a full partition for linux during installation. The problem is it didnt install correctly and the 18 GB space cant be found when logging in to win 7 .\nPlease Help.\n\nA: One thing you could do is to use your installation device USB/CD to log into a live Ubuntu session. For this boot from your device and choose 'Try out Ubuntu'. There your can view your patitions with 'gparted' and change whatever you like.\nYou should find your lost partition there.\nUnder Windows 7 you can go to Computer Management and then to Disk Management.\n\nA: Building on what @joschi said,\nPartitions are a way for operating system sto mark the space on your hard drive into sections that can be used separately, for different things. When you installed linux, it would have created one or more of:\n\n\n*\n\n*An ext3 or ext4 partition as the / (root) directory within linux. This is where system files are stored.\n\n*Another ext3 or ext4 partition as the /home/ directory from within linux. This is where personal, configurational, and some other stuff (pics, downloads, etc) is stored.\n\n*A 'swap' partition, which isn't accessible from the file system (it's not mounted to a directory), and is used when you get low on RAM (it's equivalent to the Windows swap files).\n\n\nTo be able to do that, the installer would have looked at the amount of space that Windows was actually using, and then resized it's partition. With this extra space, (18 gb, it seems) it created the extra partitions.\nTo regain the lost capacity, and make Windows recognize that it's there, you need to:\n\n\n*\n\n*!!!BACKUP ANYTHING THAT ON YOUR COMPUTER THAT IS IMPORTANT TO YOU!!!\n\n*You may not lose everything on your hard drive... but you might, too. It's easy to make a mistake (especially the first time you do this). So... \n\n*!!!BACKUP ANYTHING THAT ON YOUR COMPUTER THAT IS IMPORTANT TO YOU!!!\n\n*From within Windows, launch the Computer Management utility and then find Disk Management on the left-side. \n\n*Locate the partitions that are marked as something other than ntfs/fat/fat32. Your windows partitions are almost certainly ntfs, so be careful not to do something that would harm those partitions. \n\n*Once you have found the correct partitions remove them (right-click), and then resize your ntfs partition to fill the space.\n\n", "Q: How do I run gshutdown as root?

I forcefully close it.And that cause the worms to bleed. Open terminal and type the following command sudo dpkg --configure -a\n it gonna work.\nThanks \n\nA: Try this procedure. It usually works for this sort of problem, even when the solutions people have proposed here so far don't. Furthermore, if it doesn't work, it still does give useful diagnostic information. So if it doesn't work, then please provide all the text from the Terminal. It will be rather long, so instead of putting it into your question, you may want to paste it at http://paste.ubuntu.com. You'll get a URL to see it, which you can add to your question.\n\nA: I recommend removing all flash from your computer by opening nautilus as root and searching \"adobe flash\" and delete all the results.

I've done Ctrl-Alt-F1 and can access the command line without any problems - I tried doing startx from there but it just says something to the effect of nv module not found.  \nI uninstalled and reinstalled the nvidia-current driver, made no difference.  Also tried dpkg-reconfigure lightdm, and chose gdm.  This worked sort-of, but I can't log in - no matter what I choose (unity, unity2d, gnome) it flashes to a black screen, then back to the login window.\nAnyone have any ideas?  I can't put up with using Windows for much longer!\n\nA: Managed to fix it.  For info this appears to have happened because I use an external monitor.  The process to fix was:\nDisconnect Monitor, reboot\nUsed Ctrl-Alt-F1, logged in as myself, ran startx\nPrompted by system to install post-release nvidia driver, did that\nRebooted\nPlugged in external monitor, ran nvidia settings tool, enabled the external monitor, saved xorg.conf, all working fine.\n", "Q: Which free 2D game engine for Ubuntu is the best choice for me? Which free game engines on Ubuntu would be the best choice for me to create 2D games. \nThe engine should not be too hard to use and support multiplayer if possible. I'd use it to create games with graphics like TeeWorlds in combination with Inkscape ofc. \nI have tried Löve which is one of the free 2D game engines I find very interesting. It's available at http://love2d.org/. It uses lua for the programming language.\nAny suggestions? \nThanks\n\nA: A good choice is PyGame, which you can use to write games in Python.\nTo get started, you can use Quickly:\n\n\n*\n\n*Have a look at the getting started page in the Ubuntu App Developer site for a 5 minute quickstart\n\n*Use the PyGame template by running this command on a terminal: quickly create ubuntu-pygame my-game (where my-game is the name of the game you want to create)\n\n*Learn more from using PyGame on this session from the last Ubuntu App Developer Week.\n\n\nA: I am a non-coder and have very basic knowledge of programming. I found 'Stencyl' (http://www.stencyl.com/) to be perfect for me. I have tried some tutorials and found it simple enough to create basic games and found that it has the potential to make larger ones too. It is available for Ubuntu but requires the non free JVM to be installed.\n", "Q: Removal of unity-preferences makes launcher not show up In 11.04 I used the unity-preferences tool (called menu and launcher in the the dash I believe) to set Unity to only reveal when the mouse was moved to the upper corner.  I liked this method better as there was less of a chance of accidentally opening the launcher.\nNow in 11.10 unity-preferences is gone, and the corner no longer opens up the launcher.  That's fine, but now the launcher won't open at all.  I can't hover over the edge of the screen to open the launcher.  I'm guessing something is still respecting the \"corner only\" launch option I had set previously, but the new window controls are preventing that from triggering the launcher.  And now that unity-preferences has been removed, I have no way to set it back.\nI looked through all of the settings for unity in gconf, but couldn't find anything pertaining to this specific setting, only the compiz only settings.\nDoes anyone know where the old unity-preferences tool stored its setting?  Or could this be a different issue?\n\nA: To adjust the reveal mode of the Launcher, you can use compizconfig-settings-manager . To install CCSM, run the following command from the terminal:\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\nIn CCSM, look for Ubuntu Unity Plugin and click on the option for Reveal mode. Using the Reveal mode, you can choose which part of the screen should trigger the launcher. \n\nYou might want to configure the launcher to never hide such that you can use the launcher properly.\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I configure Unity's launcher auto-hide behavior?\n\nA: The workaround was to switch to Unity 2D until a fix was issued. I did that and got it back, but then switching back to 3D also seemed to start working again. It looks like today's updates contain the fix because it's staying enabled in 3D for me. Try running updates and see if that helps. The launcher menu is gone, but CCSM that Jokerdino suggested works.\n", "Q: Manually migrate from evolution to thunderbird After installing 11.10, evolution stayed the default mail client on my system. I guess that is because I (a) already had thunderbird installed for a test-drive a while ago and/or (b) I had evolution configured quite extensively.\nI prefer to remain with Ubuntu's choice and would like to setup thunderbird as my default client. \nCan I:\n\n\n*\n\n*Set Thunderbird as default client trough  a script or command?

Is it possible to manuall run the migration path that other upgrading users would get? \n\n*Migrate my calendar settings to lightning?\n\n*Migrate my mailfilters?\n\n*Migrate my addressbook?\n\n\nA: Firstly there is this migration walk-through:\nhttp://nucleussystems.com/blog/migrate-evolution-to-thunderbird\nIn regards to changing the default mail client, that is possible via \"System Info\" in oneiric(11.10). There is a section called \"Default Applications\" in which you can set the default mail client.\n", "Q: Can't find old emails after upgrading to Ubuntu 11.10 Can anyone tell me where I can find my old emails that existed prior to upgrading new version of ubuntu 11.10?\n\nA: You should be able to open Evolution manually then, because it would not have been removed. You're probably seeing Thunderbird when you open your mail.\nTo open Evolution (if you are using Unity), open the Dash and type Evolution, then click the icon that comes up (if Evolution is still there that is).\nIf Evolution does not show up, then you can install it from the software centre and access your old emails. Then you can migrate to Thunderbird (if you like) or remain with Evolution.\n\nA: Try looking in .local/share/evolution/mail/local\nI had a power failure in the middle of upgrading from 11.04 to 11.10. It may have nothing to do with losing the Evolution email, but after restarting and finishing the upgrade - I opened Evolution and though it listed my mail, it failed to open any. After closing and opening Evolution again, all my email was GONE! I was particularly bummed about lost drafts I had been working on... But, I did find and recover them.\nIf your problem is similar:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a copy of .local/share/evolution/mail/local \nPut the copy in some non-hidden folder like Documents\n\n*Open   Evolution - Main - On This Computer\n\n*Select the folder you want to restore, such as the Inbox\n\n*Select (top menu) File - Import...\n\n*From the Evolution Import Assistant choose:\n\n*\n\n*Continue\n\n*select Import a single file - Continue\n\n*select a file name (if it's in Documents, click your user name then Documents)\nlook for the file that only says Inbox (after selecting it may take a while   before you get you next prompt)\n\n*it should says file type Berkeley Mailbox,  then just click Continue\n\n*it should say the Destination folder, if good, Continue\n\n*Then click Apply to import the data \n\n\n", "Q: Very hot CPU on HP/Compaq 615 I am using an HP Compaq 615 AMD dual-core laptop, and I just upgraded to Oneiric.\nHowever, my CPU temperature has never been below 65 degrees C. When my laptop had Windows 7 Starter, the temperature would stay between 40-50 degrees C.\nObviously Ubuntu/Linux is using too much CPU power, even though the RAM usage is minimal. Is there any way to lighten the CPU load?\nE\n\nA: You can start by removing any applications that you do not use through Ubuntu Software Center, and by stopping the automatic start-up of certain programs. You could switch to the Ubuntu classic environment, as well.\nWhat is the CPU usage? Ubuntu is not generally going to use too many resources on a dual-core laptop especially compared to 7 Starter. This may just be a driver/fan control problem.\n\nA: Apart from checking if the laptop has enough space underneath it (for the air to flow). you could try to control the fan speed:\nHere is a nice link for Fan Control: How to control fan speed?\nAlso if you have a powerful video card. I think in your case is an Ati Radeon HD, then you might need to control the intensity with it. Change yourself to Unity 2D just to test out. Test how the temperature is when inside a terminal. Install the proprietary drivers just in case.\nCheck if you have a process running 100% of the time. The easiest way to test this is just by running the PC from a LiveCD. if the temperature stays low then maybe something that was installed recently made the CPU stay in heavy usage.\n\nA: I would definetly check and see if you need to install any proprietary driver, which is not Open-Source. If the driver isn't installed, there is no way for the OS to communicate with the GPU. But Since the CPU is, the systems utilizies the CPU to calculate real-time image rendering (What you actually see on the screen). This causes the CPU to be busy all the time, while still being in the need to calculate different algorithms.\nTo check whether the GPU (Graphics Card) Driver is installed, the easiest way is (if you are using Ubuntu with Gnome, not Unity) to check your bar (where notifications and the menu, window manager,etc. is located), if it indicates a light shadow beneath it. This means, that Compiz is activated, producing a nicer appearance of mostly everything. Since this means higher Processing Consumption, the System needs a stand-alone Processing Unit, like a GPU (Which basically is a so called Co-Processor), to enable enough Processing Power.\nIf it doesn't happen to be, follow the very first step I mentioned.\nHopefully helped out\n\nA: could be a cpu governor [performance]\n echo conservative | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor\n\nwould lower the cpu mhz and temp\n", "Q: Screen becomes black after pressing dash or alt-tab I did an upgrade from 11.04 to 11.10. Unity 3d becomes a black screen after pressing the dash-button or after pressing alt-tab to switch between open windows. I can see the panel on the top(lock,sound,..) and the panel on the left (launcher) but the rest is black. \nIt looks like a maximised black window. The open Windows are active but I cant see them. I logout by pressing logout in the right top corner and pressing enter (because logout is default focused on the dialogue screen) and leave unity3d. \nUnity3d worked with 11.04 very good.

Note that I am using the option 'Try without installing ubuntu' while booting.\nThe problem is if I try to use any other usb device all the file system on that usb device appears read only to the default ubuntu user as well as for the root. The volume appears as read-only.\nNext, I tried to remount the usb device and make it rw using\nsudo mount -o rw,ubuntu /dev/src1 /media/<mount-device-name>\nWhile the command seems to succeed and I get no errors, the device doesnt become read-write. The mount entries in fstab still show the device as read-only.\nAny suggestions as what is going wrong? \n\nA: ubuntu is not a valid mount option. First you need to know the user ID of the user you want to allow read/write access. In the case of a Live session user, it is 999. The command becomes:\nsudo mount -o rw,uid=999 /dev/src1 /mnt\n\nYou should not mount a partition on /media because /media is reserved for holding multiple mounted devices. Also, consider using the File browser for mounting the partition.\nI was assuming that you are using a filesystem that does not support UNIX file permissions, such as FAT32 and NTFS. If you are using a file permissions-aware filesystem, you have to make yourself the owner of the files. Note: dangerous command ahead, so check that you are actually changing the ownership of your USB partition and not your root filesystem:\nsudo chown -R ubuntu: /media/your-usb-drive\n\n(note the colon, this causes the group membership to be updated to ubuntu too)\n", "Q: How do I enable the globalmenu / appmenu on Xfce or LXDE?

This boot menu is black\n  by default and can be customized as follows:\nStart the Ubuntu terminal and install first the grub2-splashimages\n  package with this command:\nsudo apt-get install grub2-splashimages\nGRUB spalsh images are stored in the /usr/share/images/grub folder,\n  you can access it with this command:\nsudo nautilus /usr/share/images/grub\nIf you want to use a custom image, make sure it is in the TGA format,\n  then place it in that folder. After deciding which image to use as\n  splash screen for the GRUB2 boot loader, edit now the\n  /etc/default/grub file with this command:\nsudo gedit /etc/default/grub\nAt the end of the file, add this line:\nGRUB_BACKGROUND=/usr/share/images/grub/YOUR-IMAGE.tga\nReplace YOUR-IMAGE.tga with your custom image name.\nWhen you finish, press CTRL+Q and save your file. Run now this\n  command:\nsudo update-grub\nRestart now your computer to see if changes are successful (hold down\n  the SHIFT key to bring up the GRUB boot screen while rebooting).\n\n\nA: Here is a manual how to install burg manager, a graphical front-end to configure burg, a graphical grub-manager.

The process of theming Grub is quite complicated. There is a guide available here: A Beginner's Guide to Theming GRUB2 \nThough that includes a 37 page PDF document to read through! A simple but effective way of sprucing up Grub is to add a custom background image. The easiest way I've found of adding one to Grub is to use Grub Customizer\nTo install this enter these commands in a Terminal:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:danielrichter2007/grub-customizer\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install grub-customizer\n\nThen run Grub Customizer, when it has loaded click the Preferences button and then the Appearance tab.\n\nSee image below for newer version of Grub Customizer.\n\nThen select the file icon under background image and navigate to your chosen image file (I found that selecting one of the default wallpapers looks effective, I'm using the new Pangolin image from the 12.04 wallpapers). You can also change the font colour of the menu at this point (useful if your background image colour makes the text unreadable - a preview will appear when you select a background image to check whether you'll have any colour clashes).\nThen close the preferences pop-up and select the Save button on the main screen, then you can reboot your system to admire your handiwork!\n\n\nA: (Shameless plug) There is Matter which is a customizable theme.

I keep hearing about these things known as tty's.\n\n\n*\n\n*what are they\n\n*how can I access them \n\n*what do they do?\n\nA: A tty, short for teletype and perhaps more commonly called a terminal, is a device which lets you interact with the system by sending and receiving data, such as commands and the output they produce.\nThere are many kind of ttys, but nowadays most ttys are implemented in software, such as the graphical consoles you can access with Ctrl+Alt+Fn, or terminal emulators such as Gnome terminal that run inside an X session.\nThere is also a tty command, which shows the device node of the terminal in which it is running (or prints \"not a tty\" if it is not running inside a terminal; yes, it is possible to run commands outside a terminal). For example:\nfiras@itsuki ~ % tty\n/dev/pts/0\nfiras@itsuki ~ % ssh localhost tty\nnot a tty\n\nWhen I am logged in and running a shell on the machine, the shell is normally running inside a terminal, namely here it is /dev/pts/0. However, when I run ssh host command to run a command on a remote host, the command is not run inside a terminal.\n\nA: You can change the displayed TTY by commmand line with chvt (requires sudo privileges), from SSH for example. Here is the relevant part of the manpage (man chvt):\n\nCHVT(1)\nNAME\nchvt - change foreground virtual terminal\nSYNOPSIS\nchvt N\nDESCRIPTION\nThe command chvt N makes /dev/ttyN the foreground terminal.\n(The corresponding screen is created if it did not exist yet.\nTo get rid of unused VTs, use deallocvt)\nThe key combination (Ctrl-)LeftAlt-FN (with N in the range 1-12) usually has a similar effect.\n\n\nA: tty is one of those funky Unix commands that prints the name of the terminal connected to standard input.\nTTY's are text-only terminals commonly used as a way to get access to the computer to fix things, without actually logging into a possibly b0rked desktop.\nRelated: What is tty7 in the commandline?\nBy default, Ubuntu has 7 tty's.\n\n*\n\n*On Ubuntu 17.10 and newer: It's GUI login screen on 1, GUI desktop on 2 and command lines on 3-7.\n\n*Up until Ubuntu 17.10: 1-6 are command line only and 7 runs your X session (your normal desktop).\n\nTo access them, use this keyboard shortcut:\nCtrl + Alt + F3 (or F1 until 17.10).\nChanging F3 to F3-F6 to access the terminal that you want.\nTo get back to your GUI session (the normal desktop):\nCtrl + Alt + F2 (or F7  until 17.10).\n\nA: It changes your workspace: for example, you could have a text file open and change to tty2 then you might have a /ls command for reference. This is very helpful for an environment like Ubuntu Server.\nThis is the equivalent of having two tabs open in a GUI Environment.\nIn Ubuntu Server (16.04.3 LTS - for me) I can use ALT+F1-F6 or use ALT+LeftArrow to go back a number or ALT+RightArrow to go forwards a number.\nYou can see your tty by logging out from Ubuntu Server (run logout) and see up at the top Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS ubuntu tty# that is standard, but may differ from version to version.\nIf your tty isn't shown on your login screen then you can run sudo nano /etc/issue and at the top, you can put in whatever you like but to add the tty you need to place \\l. Place \\n for the hostname.\n\nExample:\n/etc/issue\nUbuntu 16.04.3 LTS \\n \\l\n\nwould show\nUbuntu 16.04.3 LTS ubuntu tty#\n\n\nNotes:\n# refers to a number\n\nA: AFAIK, on a decent functioning machine there is no difference (except there are colors in the desktop terminals, and you can minimize them and other little reasons they're easier)\nHOWEVER, if you are trying to use an old laptop with < 4GB of RAM, or you messed up your debian install (still not sure, anyone stable on Dell inspiron 11-3162?); then the tty's will work when the desktop is lagging or malfunctioning or forgetting how to write a \"d\" for some reason: The ttys just work, and respond quickly. There is no press a button and wait 30 seconds to see it show up (if the desktop terminal even decides to behave at all) it just works.\nALSO just tested, nano still color codes in tty's, I'm sure vim or whatever you guys are into will as well.\nTHE other posts already showed you how to use them, it seemed you were confused as to why as well. This is the reason for my answering as I did; hope it helps.\nEDIT also, it appears launching web pages from tty's is much more difficult than the simple one liner two string command from a terminal open in a gui\nTl;DR\nGui terminals have more features and are easier in some ways but when the gui is buggy the tty's terminals work more quickly and efficiently.\n", "Q: Is Firefox not rendering a web page correctly compared to the same version on Windows? I recently discovered that Firefox on Ubuntu does not render well some web pages compared to how it renders them on Windows (where the rendering is correct) or even to Chromium on the same Ubuntu box (Chromium also renders them correctly).\nI thought it was a problem with Ubuntu, but using Chromium on Ubuntu convinced me that it may be a problem in Firefox or a combination of Firefox and Ubuntu.\nHere is a screenshot of an area of a webpage rendered with Firefox:\n\nAnd here is another one for the same area but rendered correctly with Chromium under the same Ubuntu machine:\n\nI'm using the latest stable Firefox version: 7.0.1 on the latest 11.10 Ubuntu release.\nI tried to remove (totally) and reinstall Firefox but the problem persists.

Also how would I go about removing the proprietary drivers since I already have them installed?  Thanks! :)\n\nA: You can remove the proprietary drivers on the same screen that you have installed them (under \"Additional Drivers), just select the ones you are using now and click on 'deactivate' if you installed them using the \"Aditional Drivers\" application.\nIf you used the drivers downloaded from the ATI website there should be a /usr/share/fglrx/ati-uninstall.sh file, run it with sudo sh /usr/share/fglrx/ati-uninstall.sh and that should remove the ATI downloaded drivers.\nAbout what driver to use, well, any of those will have the same effects, the choppiness comes from using compiz with 3d effects, that's not well handled either by Nvidia or ATI drivers (in most cases that is).\nMy advise is to use the fglrx driver but instead of the unity3d desktop use the unity2d desktop as default. After all do you really need to have special effects when your watching a movie? Does the 3d desktop make you feel better about yourself? Is it worth the choppiness? No, not really...

The reason your timer is going up and down is because your download speed is varying, and the reason it's taking ages is because the repository is overloaded.\nEither start again and don't check the boxes to update components from the internet, or tough it out and wait for it to finish.\nIf you start again, you can change your software source to a less crowded one using the \"Software Sources\" tool after installation, and get your updates in the usual manner.

I recently bought a new laptop (Asus X53S series) that has two GPUs, an NVidia GeForce GT 540M and an integrated Intel GPU (I believe it's called Intel HD graphics 3000). I installed the recommended restricted NVidia drivers after a clean Ubuntu 11.10 install. In the 'additional drivers' program I get the message: \"This driver is enabled and in use\", although when I try to open the NVidia X Server Settings it says \"You do not appear to be using the NVIDIA X driver.\" which seems to be the case since Ubuntu only starts using Unity 2D.\nI've had the same issue in 11.04 and I was forced to use the nouveau driver just to get unity working, but since I get quite a few crashes with it I really want to get the propriety driver working this time around. Since I've never had this issue with older laptops, I can only assume it is caused due to the dual gpu configuration. How do I get Ubuntu to use the propriety drivers, or is there any workaround to get the integrated Intel GPU to be ignored by Ubuntu?\nAlternatively, has anyone got Unity working with a similar setup?\n\nA: You need to install a program called Ironhide from the ironhide PPA\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:mj-casalogic/ironhide && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ironhide ironhide-ui\nThis will install software that will allow switching between the Nvidia GPU and the Intel GPU, it will also shut down the Nvidia when it is not needed...\nIt doesn't work perfectly and most of the time the Intel GPU is being used, but it does allow for unity 3d to work.\nI haven't had any luck with the GUI portion of Ironhide though it just crashes.\nI've also had to type this sudo modprobe nvidia-current to activate the nvidia card..\nYou also have to run programs that you want to run on the nvidia card from the command prompt..\nie: optirun google-chrome, will run google-chrome with the nvidia-gpu\nPS: You can't disable the Intel Adapter because the technology that is used for the dual GPU setup is based on a switch GMA that allows for other GPU's to render. There is no direct connection to the Nvidia GPU.\nAlthough some bios's will allow you to disable the intel chip in the settings, then Just the nvidia can be used.\n", "Q: How do I add an icon to an app that doesn't have one? Some apps from the Ubuntu Software Center don't have any icons that Ubuntu Unity desktop even sees, such as ERIC, the Python IDE.  The results are ugly:\n\nI get this ugly question mark icon, and I can't find any way to configure that icon.   There is no more ability to create a launcher icon on my desktop, or to really control (from the Unity GUI anyways) what icon appears for an app, and if the default ways that Unity finds icons break down, it appears that the results are stuck on \"ugly\" permanently.\nUbuntu version: 11.10 (Oneiric Ocelot)\nUpdate: The answers so far show that something is wrong with my brand new installation, because other people see the icon for eric (eric.png, I guess).  Interestingly, many icons in Ubuntu are SVG, and some are PNG.   I wonder if that's the problem. Still no ability to change or set the icon for any app, either using the GUI, or via VI-and-terminal-and-editing files.\n\nA: The icon for eric is set in /usr/share/applications/eric.desktop:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Eric python IDE\nName[es]=IDE para python Eric\nComment=Full featured Python IDE\nComment[es]=Completo entorno de programaci贸n para Python\nExec=eric\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nIcon=eric\nCategories=Development;IDE;\nStartupNotify=true\n\nOn disk this appears to be: \n/usr/share/pixmaps/eric.xpm\n\nOn my system eric is showing the proper icon in the dash, no idea why yours isn't doing that, but from looking at the default icon you might want to just set another one:\n\n\nA: I believe you'll have to edit the corresponding .desktop files in /usr/share/applications.

I don't mind a couple of reboots, but I need to work my day. Can I still fully work while it upgrades or does it blocks the system?\nThanks.\n\nA: I'd say no. The upgrader itself says you shouldn't do work while upgrading a system.\nWith that being said, I've done all sorts of things - normal word processing, compiling things (that was stupid) and web browsing (just to name a few), the only thing that has given me problems has been compiling things while doing an upgrade. \nHowever, to be on the safe side, don't do it.\n\nA: It's just like doing your regular updates. You can keep working but might have to restart a few times. Better still, just to remain safe, make a backup of all the work you have done and also all the work you'll be doing during the updates frequently.\n\nA: When you upgrade & after backing up your current data, you'll see a status window showing the steps of the upgrade, labelled 'distribution upgrade' or something like that. In that window, Ubuntu will check off each step of progress as they are completed: \nPreparing to upgrade\nGetting new packages\nInstalling the upgrades\nCleaning up\nRestarting the computer\nIt is near the \"Restarting the Computer\" phase that Ubuntu wil reboot into the 11.10 release & all unsaved data will be lost. \nI would personally wait until you have a a spare hour or two to upgrade to prevent any possible loss of data or interruption from work.\n", "Q: Why Mac users don't see me online when I use MSN through empathy?

I'm really in love with Ubuntu but I'm not used to Gwibber, for some reason.\nI can't remove gwibber without removing the ubuntu-desktop package.\nIs it safe to remove it, without ruining my desktop?\n\nA: To remove an account from Gwibber:\nOpen Gwibber, click \"Edit > Accounts\" on the global menu (hover over the top of the screen where you see the title and the menu will show)\nA window should pop up named \"Online Accounts\". Click on the site of the account then click \"Remove account.\"\nTo uninstall Gwibber (or any other piece of software):\nOpen the \"Ubuntu Software Center\", search \"Gwibber\", click on the result, and click \"Remove\".\n\nA: Yes, it is completely safe.

I've heard some packages being classified as a meta-package. So now I am left wondering what is the difference between a meta-package and a package? \n\nA: A meta-package pulls in other packages, and by definition should not do anything else.\nA package usually has some sort of content (files, applications, documentation, a script, or such).\n\nA: Simply said, a meta package has nothing in it, except empty docs. The only thing it has is metadata, which means that it can have dependencies, or conflicts etc...\n\nA: From https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MetaPackages:\n\nThese packages do not contain actual software, they simply depend on other packages to be installed.\n\nIt is important to note that removing a meta package does NOT remove the packages it installed:\n\n[...] when a metapackage is automatically removed by the removal or purging of any one, or more, of its underlying dependencies, all of the other packages that were in the metapackage's depends list are still installed on the system.\n\nYou can look at the structure of a typical meta-package by pulling (for example) ubuntu-desktop:\napt-get source ubuntu-desktop\n\nLooking at the structure, you'll find the list of packages each meta-package recommends, as well as the structure of putting it all together in debian/rules.\nReferences:\n\n*\n\n*https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MetaPackages\n\n*How to create a meta-package that automatically installs other packages?\n\nA: Metapackages are a link to existing package or packages. So they are essentially a script that installs other packages.They keep the packages as dependencies\nEg: the package ubuntu-desktop installs all the packages needed for the Default UI for ubuntu. But uninstalling the same does not uninstall its dependencies\n\nA: Metapackage is not your regular package. It is a way to always install latest packages of a software. For example on ubuntu 'emacs' metapackage always installs the latest available version of emacs. \n", "Q: How to setup Yahoo messenger in Empathy?

It's a CCE (brazilian brand) WM545B-T with 4gb DDR3, Intel i5 Sandy Bridge 2500k iirc, Intel HD 3000 (great integrated card btw) and a 500gb 5200rpm HD (yeah, i know...). It's motherboard is, iirc, a Intel HM65.\nAs i reported in a question before, when i first got it, i tryed to install Ubuntu 11.04 and got some weird screen bugs. I got around that installing SuperOS, a Ubuntu 11.04 based distro.\nYesterday at 8am (brazil time) i saw some Ubuntu CDs from the oficial release repos (before the oficial release by Canonical), downloaded via torrent, checked md5 and used unetbootin to burn it to a pendrive.\nStarted the install like i always do any other OS install, the weird screen bug was there again... but this time i was able to click the first option and start the Live CD. Great... i was finally gonna use my loved distro again. Oh man, i was wrong.\nThe Live CD worked great and insanely fast. I runned the installer and went to the advanced options for partitions.\nI have 3 NTFS partitions... one with 20gb for W7 64bits, one with 100mb with system files that W7 created and the rest is for my personal files. Made a 25gb ext4 one for Ubuntu and a 4gb swap one. The bottom of the install ask me where i wanna install the bootloader, with /dev/sda (my hd) by default. Then installed it and the install went without a problem. Made me happy ofc.\nWhen the laptop was booting again, the first problem. It did not boot... just freeze at post or restart. Ok... went to the Live CD again and this time tryed a different setup for my partitions.\nTryed to install the bootloader in /dev/sda2, with Windows Boot Loader. This time it booted... but on a EFI Shell, something i have no idea about what is. Tryed again... created swap, ext4 for Ubuntu and this time also created a EFI partition (i thought Hey, it says EFI, lets try it lol)... same EFI Shell saying something about startup.sh and then gimme a Shell> inpurt commands here line of command.\nI have never see this EFI Shell before and i can't find infos about it on the internet. Not infos i can use to install Ubuntu at least. Anyone know what is that or how can i install my lovely distro?\nRight now i have some options in mind:\n1. Format my ENTIRE HD losing 232gb of important fles and try to install Ubuntu 11.10 on the entire HD to see what happens;\n2. Install W7 from zero and install Ubuntu with Wubi losing performance with it;\n3. Use Fedora (that install and boot normaly) or some Ubuntu 11.10 distro based (that will take sometime to appear);\n4. Delete my W7 partition, install Ubuntu 11.10 and then install W7 again... recover grub and see what happens...\nAnyone have an answer for this question before i try one of those ideas? My obvious idea is the problem is based on my boot since the Live CD works ok and other distros based on Ubuntu runs fine.\nI have tested Ubuntu 10.10 and give me same 11.04 issues... but ElemetaryOS, based on 10.10, works fine. I don't know what tweak they do on the boot... but something happens there.\nAnyone have an answer for this?\nEDIT: Ok, i think i may know what is going on.\nRunned sudo fdisk -l and this is what i get from it:\nDisk /dev/sda: 500.1 GB, 500107862016 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 60801 cylinders, total 976773168 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x2b510800\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sda1            2048      206847      102400    7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n/dev/sda2          206848    40962047    20377600    7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n/dev/sda3       102402048   976771071   437184512    7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n/dev/sda4        40964094   102402047    30718977    5  Extended\n/dev/sda5        94191616   102402047     4105216   82  Linux swap / Solaris\n/dev/sda6        40964096    94189567    26612736   83  Linux\n\nIf you take a close look, there is no \"*\", so maybe it means there is no boot device set?

Probably did not used the best solution but well... at least it's booting and stuffs.

The solution worked for me as well except I didn't have to do anything after the reboot. I had followed exact instructions until then though. The only other thing I would like to add is in the instructions it just says remove all nvidia packages and some newbies (That's not a bad word. We all were new at some point) may not know how to do that so I will include the command here. It's sudo apt-get remove nvidia* that should remove all instances for you. Don't forget the asterisk after nvidia. the same goes for removing jockey. Use the same command and put \"jockey*\" where nvidia* was. I know this seems trivial to some, but there was a time when I needed exact instruction and sometimes that still didn't work. Anyways thanks for the post!

I tried with Debian, and it doesn't happen. It doesn't happen with <11.04, either.\n\nA: This most likely is caused by the different versions of firmware Ubuntu and Windows are using for some devices.\nSome devices (touchpads, tv-tuners, wifi adapters etc.) require certain firmware to be uploaded into them before they can be used. This is usually done by the device driver. The firmware is stored in the device's own memory and can survive a \"warm\" reboot. On boot, the driver checks if the firmware is already present and does not re-upload it - so, if you reboot into Windows after Ubuntu, and vice-versa, the system may mistakingly attempt to use a wrong firmware version, which causes all sorts of problems.\nI mean, a hard-reboot is maybe a bit too extereme, Windows should've handled this more gracefully :) \nThere are 2 solutions I know about:\n\n\n*\n\n*a cold restart (maybe even waiting for a few minutes after shutting the system down, disconnect the battery if it's a laptop)\n\n*do not boot into Windows.

However, an blackout causes the computer to switch off and the installation is terminated halfway accidently.\nAfter I switched on the computer, the Ubuntu 11.04 won't start it's GUI. So, I used Ctrl+Alt+F1, logged in and used sudo do-release upgrade again to resume the upgrade.\nAfter the upgrade, the computer restarted, after choosing Ubuntu 11.10 from grub, the screen goes black, no bootloader or anything.

When I restarted again, it goes back to tty1. I have to use sudo reboot to get restart again, however, this time same thing happens and Ubuntu 11.10 won't start GUI automatically.\nHow do I fix this?\n\nA: I had the same behaviour with my Lenovo Ideapad Y560p running 11.10. First install went fine but after restarting it didn't boot the GUI.\nThe issue was to do with the graphics driver. In the kern.log file I found the message \"failed to load module \"fglrx\"\". Which is the ATI Catalyst driver for linux.\nSo I did a \"sudo apt-get install fglrx\" . It installed the driver and now it boots up every time.\n\nA: ufff the same happened to me today...the problem is that we downloaded the ubuntu SERVER not the DESKTOP, so the desktop will not install :P you need to download the desktop one in order to use it.\nyou can download the desktop version here:\nhttp://www.futuredesktop.org/\n\nA: If an APT operation (such as a release upgrade) was cancelled, usually sudo dpkg --configure -a will configure the unconfigured packages, if there are any.\nHold down SHIFT when booting up - you should see the GRUB2 screen. Navigate to Previous Linux versions and press Enter. Find the one at the bottom and press Enter on it. (Move around the menus with the arrow keys) This will boot an old kernel, and if this helps, then  the latest version of the Ubuntu kernel happens to be incompatible with your computer. You can continue to boot your old kernel via this method if it helps.\n", "Q: How to set up a home network I have been using windows 7 on both my home pc and my laptop and have been using the Homegroup feature to share files between machines.\nCould someone please tell me how to achieve this using ubuntu 11.10 in the easiest way possible? \nVia a graphical interface would be preferred.\n\nA: You want to install Samba. By terminal or through Software center. You can then setup to view your Ubuntu files on a Windows computer. To do this you need to tell Samba what folders you want to share like Music or Pictures. Go to Samba and click the green add button. THat will let you add a folder to be shared.

I have an existing machine with three drives, two of which are joined in a raid 0; on my old distro, this was mounted at /home\nWhen I went to install Oneiric, it recognized each drive separately; the main drive is no problem, but there was no way to note that that the other two drives were raided together.\nFrom what I've read, the Alternate install is required for an install including RAIDed drives.  Do I need this, even though it's not going to house the root filesystem?  Is it a particular hassle to do this after install on Ubuntu?\n\nA: It turns out that the alternate install is not needed.  After booting the desktop install, you simply have to do the following as root:\napt-get install mdadm\nmdadm --assemble --scan\n\nThen, running blkid will give the UUID of the drive; this can be used to add an entry for the drive to /etc/fstab.\nIt's that simple!\n", "Q: Trying to change the color scheme through the css file, but no permission I have been trying to switch out the orange color scheme in Ubuntu 11.10 through the css files.

Is there a way to get permission?\nI am using Bluefish editor fyi.\n\nA: To put it bluntly, you're doing it wrong.\nYou need to copy the GTK theme into /home/yourname/.themes/\nThen you should be able to edit it, rename it and then select it in the appearance settings.\nRelated question.\n\nA: Try editing as root. The easiest way to do that is in the command line, so start by going to the folder where the files are:\nuser@localhost:~$ cd /path/to/files\n\n(don't forget you can press tab to complete long or complex names!) \nThen load up your editor of choice. I assume that bluefish loads with 'bluefish' but if not, try tab-completion to find what the name of it is:\nuser@localhost:/path/to/files$ gksu bluefish style.css\n\nIt will prompt you for your password then, hopefully, run bluefish as superuser with the ability to make changes to the file.\nTHAT SAID, consider what jrg said, as if you have to go in as superuser to change a user setting, there's probably something you're not quite doing right.\n", "Q: What's the absolute path of an icon declared in a .desktop file? In a .desktop file you can declare an icon, however it's not clear how this translates to an icon on disk: \nIcon=eric  \n\nWhere on the filesystem can I find this icon?\nRelated to this question:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I add an icon to an app that doesn't have one?\n\nA: It's dependent on the icon theme. If the icon is not given by an absolute path, following rules are used to find the icon:\n\nThe lookup is done first in the current theme, and then recursively in each of the current theme's parents, and finally in the default theme called \"hicolor\" (implementations may add more default themes before \"hicolor\", but \"hicolor\" must be last). As soon as there is an icon of any size that matches in a theme, the search is stopped.\n[...]\nThe lookup inside a theme is done in three phases. First all the directories are scanned for an exact match, e.g. one where the allowed size of the icon files match what was looked up. Then all the directories are scanned for any icon that matches the name. If that fails we finally fall back on unthemed icons. If we fail to find any icon at all it is up to the application to pick a good fallback, as the correct choice depends on the context.\n\nSee the Icon Theme Specification for details.\n\nA: You can either specify the full path of your png/xpm file or you can install your icon first using xdg.\nExample:\nxdg-icon-resource install /path/to/your/icon.xpm --size 64\n\nThen you will find it in the below path:\n/usr/share/icons/hicolor/64x64/apps#\n\nWith this, you will be able to specify the icon name on your .desktop file instead of the full path.\n", "Q: How to modify the system default login background image?

When anyone wants to login to my computer, I am prompted by ssh to confirm the login before it is successful.\nIn our university lab, all computers have common usename and passwords so that anyone, students mainly, can access the computers. I need a way so that that can ssh prevent logins until I confirm. \nSimilarly, is there a log file I can use so that I know if anyone is accessing my computer?\n\nA: SSH was not designed for such on-demand access. However, if shell access (or file transfer) is the only thing you've to worry about, you've to restrict the possibilities for SSH and add a script that does not launch a shell unless you allow to.\nFor the SSH limiting part, I took a part of How to create a restricted SSH user for port forwarding?. Edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config and add:\nMatch user your-username\n    AllowAgentForwarding no\n    ForceCommand ~/bin/ssh-confirm\n\nCreate the executable ~/bin/ssh-confirm (mode 755) and create a script/ program in the language at your choice that make you need to confirm before dropping a SSH shell, e.g.:\n#!/bin/bash\nconfirmfile=\"$HOME/allow-ssh-for-pid-$$\"\nif [ -f \"$confirmfile\" ]; then\n    echo \"Old confirmation file found for the SSH session, exiting!\"\n    exit 1\nfi\n# wait for a grant for 30 seconds before giving up\nfor ((i=0; i<30; i++)); do\n    if [ -f \"$confirmfile\" ]; then\n        rm \"$confirmfile\"\n        exec \"$SHELL\"\n    fi\n    sleep 1\ndone\necho \"SSH access timed out.\"\nexit 1\n\nThis would require you to create the file \"allow-ssh-for-pid-$$\" where $$ is the pid of the script executed from SSH. You can use ps, pidof, etc for determining the PID. Of course, it could be more sophisticated like alerting you through notify, but I'll assume that people will give you a ring if they try to access you.\nAlso, I assume you trust the people you grant SSH access. If not, create a separate user (without sudo permissions of course ;) ) and store the ssh-confirm on a place like /usr/local/bin and store access tokens somewhere else.\nSSH login attempts (and logouts) are logged to /var/log/auth.log. Run w to get a list of logged in users (note: you'll get multiple entries for terminals you open on your machine, pay attention to the FROM column).\n\nA: /var/log/auth.log\n\nThis is where you can view a login history. I'm not sure if there's an elegant solution to what you're thinking of with controlling access, however, as all I can think of is some kind of crazy scheme where you use rsync or something like that to revoke and re-instate the SSH keys as needed.\n", "Q: After upgrading to 11.10, when pressing Ctrl+F, Xterm is popping up Yesterday I upgraded from 11.04 to 11.10.

I have never mapped to this key combination and not sure how this came about. \nThanks!\n\nA: I have the same problem. I upgraded to 11.10 and installed xbindkeys. \nHere is the way that you can fix this problem:\n1) Alt-F2 -> type xbindkeys-config -> Run\n2) Select two items that are related to xterms and delete them.\n3) Click save and quite.\nIt then works normally as before. \n\nA: The culprit is xbinkeys, a software made to create custom shortcuts. The CTRL+F lauching xterm is an example in the configuration file (~.xbindkeysrc). Since Ubuntu 11.10 doesn't realise it is an example and use it by default, overriding all other uses of CTRL+F.\nIn order to set things back to normal do as follow :\n\n\n*\n\n*Open your home folder, and press CTRL+H to show hidden files.\n\n*Open the file .xbindkeysrc (with gedit).\n\n*Add a pound (#) at the beginning of each line starting with \"xterm\" and the following one (most probably lines 46-47 and 50-51).\n\n*Save and exit.\n\n*Then either logout/login again or restart xbindkeys: killall -HUP xbindkeys\n\nA: Okay, I figured out.

Can someone please tell how to attach the Unity Menu Applet back to the Gnome Panel?\n\nA: Not sure i understand correctly but... you can't.\nThere is no gnome panel. It's all unity. In 11.10 the menu button is on the launcher by design. There's no \"app for that\" to change it. :)\n\nA: There is certainly a way to get rid of the Unity menu.\nsudo aptitude install gnome-panel - followed by a log out/log in where you select the Gnome panel as your desktop should do the job for you.

See this blog post from Vincent Untz for some more about the Gnome3 Gnome-Panel.\n", "Q: Is there a way to enable smooth scrolling for PDFs? There is one small issue with Ubuntu that is driving me crazy. Smooth scrolling when reading documents PDF's isn't smooth. I was using evince to read PDF's and bigger books of 200+ pages. The slightest movement results in a major movement of many pages.\nSo, I blamed evince and the installed xpdf but no, its the same thing. Is there anything i can install/fix to allow smooth scrolling when I read documents?\nIn LXDE or KDE, the PDF viewer has the little up and down scroll arrows in the bottom right corner.  \nIs there anyway to enable these for laptops so we aren't \"pulling\" at the documents and can scroll PDF's smoothly on laptop's? \n\nA: Try holding alt when pressing the arrow keys.\nFound it out today.\n\nA: In Ubuntu 12.04 smooth scrolling is enabled system-wide and many GTK3 applications (most of the default ones) support it. However, the default PDF viewer, Evince, does not yet. \nThe good news is that smooth scrolling in Evince might be coming as an update. See https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/evince/+bug/981248.\nAlso, if you disable overlay scrollbars, scrolling with the touchpad over the regular scrollbar will make the document scroll smoothly.\n\nA: Well unfortunately I cannot find anyway to directly fix the problem with the overlay scroll bars.\nBut have found a way to remove them so reading PDF's would again be possible.\nrevert to the default scrollbarsecho \"export LIBOVERLAY_SCROLLBAR=0\" | sudo tee /etc/X11/Xsession.d/80overlayscrollbars > /dev/null\nFound the solution here on  Disable Overlay Scrollbars in Ubuntu Natty  - TuxGarage\n\nA: I find that opening the PDFs into Firefox (yes, the web browser) allows one to read them with smoothscroll. I have been unable to find a native/dedicated pdf viewer application for Ubuntu that does this.\nI also found that I could solve Firefox's jerky smooth scroll by disabling all speedstep/power-saving related options in my BIOS.\nAlternatives\nIf you hold down the middle mouse button and drag up/down, then that is a way to scroll smoothly. However, unlike with Firefox, you have to worry about the fact that you are not locked on the x-axis if you are zoomed in such that the margins do not show. The same effect can be realized by using Okular and just click-dragging rather than using the middle mouse button. This feels more natural.\n", "Q: How can I change the color of the sidebar in Nautilus 3.2.0? This used to be easy to do with a .gtkrc-2.0 in Ubuntu 11.04 and previous releases.  I am using a third-party theme (Elements) and I really like it, but the Nautilus sidebar is ugly and dark and I want it to match the rest of the theme a little better.\n\nA: You would need to edit the css themes for the GTK+ 3 theme to accomplish this. You can use other themes (there many themes on gnomelook.org for you to look at).\n", "Q: scp copy over ssh doesn't work - permission denied error, please? It's driving me nuts! I just want to transfer one simple file from laptop to server.\nI'm using ubuntu on both machines.\nSo I have:\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 sandro    414622 2011-10-14 23:42 sandrophoto-html.tar.gz\n\nAnd I'm sending it using:\nsudo scp -P XXXX sandrophoto-html.tar.gz usern@server.local:/media/xx/xx/xx\n\nAnd I get: scp: /media/xx/xx/xx/sandrophoto-html.tar.gz: Permission denied\np.s. I might be doing this other way around - I want to send file tar.gz that is located on my desktop, to remote server into the folder /media/yadayda\n\nA: Hi had this same permission error problem solved it this way\nMake sure the directory you are copying to on 192.168.0.4 is owned by the user username\nchown username downloads\n\nOn your local machine then do\nsudo scp filename.zip username@192.168.0.4:/etc/Myfiles/downloads\n\nCheers\n\nA: Permisssion Denied means you are not the root of the server. You just hold an account there. So in that case you need to do this:\nsudo scp -r /path2yourFolder/ username@server_Ip:/home/username\n\nThis will copy to your home directory on server.\nThis will also work:\nscp -r /path2yourFolder/ username@server_Ip:~/\n\n\nA: You have things in the right order from what I understand, the general way an scp is done is:\nscp sourceuser@sourcehost:/path/to/source/file destinationuser@destinationhost:/path/to/destination/\n\nJudging by your question, you have a local file you want to send to the destination server. So you have the right syntax which is good! \nIf you're getting permission denied, then you're not using the correct username or something's amiss with the authentication. Most likely, it's because the sudo command only works locally, for starters, so it won't give you root on the remote box, so that's probably the problem. Make sure that the user you are logging in as on the remote server has write permissions to the location you're trying to write to. \nIf the problem is the destinationuser doesn't have access to that location without sudo, move the file to the destinationuser's home folder then sudo mv the file from the shell on the other server to put it in the right location.\n\nA: I had a similar problem, it happened because ssh takes -p xxxx for specifying the port while scp takes -P xxxx to specify the port. Minor inconsistency, so easy to miss :(\n\nA: This error occurred for me when the file already existed in the target location and the existing file had read-only permissions (preventing the file from being overwritten).  In my case, I just logged in and deleted the existing file and that corrected the problem.\n\nA: Had the same problem. I found out that the directory containing my source file did not have enough permission. So I just changed the mode recursively using:chmod -R 771 directory_path on the source machine.\n\nA: I was trying to copy from my local machine as username@localhost; the SSH key I was using wasn't registered to access my localhost, so I was getting permission denied. When I removed that from the source portion, it worked.\n", "Q: Setting TeX Live path for root I have installed TeX Live 2011 vanilla and I have trouble setting the TeX Live path for root (in Ubuntu 11.10).\nThe problem is that when I run sudo tlmgr I get:\nsudo: tlmgr: command not found\n\nTo fix the path for non-root it was sufficient to add \nPATH=/usr/local/texlive/2011/bin/x86_64-linux:$PATH\n\nto /etc/profile.\nI have tried adding this same line to /root/.bashrc and I have also tried to add it to /etc/profile.d/zzz-texlive.sh like Herbert suggest in https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/26624/tlmgr-inaccessible/26626#26626  but it does not help.\n\nA: If you add the symlinks then you won't need to make a script. You can do this two ways:\nUsing the GUI:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo env PATH=\"$PATH\" tlmgr --gui.\n\n*Click 'Actions -> Handle symlinks in system dirs'.\n\n*Click 'Update symbolic links'.\n\n\nUsing the command line (untested, since I used the GUI):\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo env PATH=\"$PATH\" tlmgr path add. (find more information at tlmgr documentation)\n\n\nA: What worked for me: I started tlmgr in gui mode with\nsudo env PATH=\"$PATH\" tlmgr --gui\n\nand then in the third menu chose the last item but one (in my German menu, that is menu \"Aktionen\" (actions?) and item \"Verwaltung der symbolischen Links\" (administration of symbolic links?). In the ensuing dialogue window I clicked the button \"Symbolische Links erneuern\" (renew symbolic links?). Now \nsudo tlmgr --OPTIONS\n\nworks without problems. I'm sure there's also a command line way of doing this ;)\n\nA: Quick fix: since you already have the correct $PATH set in your\nenvironment (via the /etc/profile modifications) you can use:\nsudo env PATH=\"$PATH\" tlmgr\n\nBasically, sudo resets the value of\n$PATH (the whole environment, indeed) to a \"known good\" one, and is\nthus ignoring any changes you made to your local environment.  The\nenv command above sets the PATH variable\nin the environment of the tlmgr it executes, so it runs with the\nvalue of $PATH you specify on the command line.\nTo avoid typing all that for each TeXlive command, you can define an\nalias in your shell: add the following line to the .bashrc file in\nyour home:\nalias psudo='sudo env PATH=\"$PATH\"'\n\nand then you can simply issue this at a command prompt:\npsudo tlmgr\n\nIn addition, sudo does not run a\nlogin shell to execute the command, which is why your \"profile.d\"\ntricks did not work for root.  You can force\nsudo to execute a command in a\nshell, which is an alternate way of achieving the same effect:\nsudo sh -l -c tlmgr\n\nAgain you can define a shell command alias to shorten this:\nalias shsudo='sudo sh -l -c'\n\nwhich can be used as:\nshsudo tlmgr\n\n\nA: To pass the user's $PATH to sudo I modified /etc/sudoers file using the visudo command and add the following line:\nDefaults        exempt_group=<group that I belong to>\n\nNow I can execute (e.g.)\nsudo tlmgr update all\n\nor\nsudo texhash\n\nand everything works perfect.\nI would greatly appreciate any comments on this approach.\n\nA: You really don't have to add the directory of tlmgr to the path. A simple quick solution is using which, e.g.: \nsudo $(which tlmgr) update --list\n\n\nA: It is not good practice to install and manage TeX Live using \"root\" privileges.  Instead, create the /usr/local/texlive directory, e.g, using sudo, and then change the ownership to the user that will be managing TeX Live.  After that, TeX Live can be installed and updated without using \"root\" privileges.\n\nA: I created my account just to tell how it worked for me. I'm not a linux expert but after reviewing A LOT of forums with same issue and related issues  I found this solution, I hope to help. I'm using Ubuntu 20.04 right now. For me it's incredible that there is no simpler installation option in both cases texlive and tlmgr:\nSteps:\n\n*\n\n*I Downloaded ISO image of texlive (you have to install perl before\n\n\n*Mount the image and then open a terminal in the mounted directory:\n`sudo perl install-tl` \n\n\n\n*I choosed full instalation.\n\n\n*post instalation PATH export:\nexport INFOPATH=/usr/local/texlive/2021/texmf-dist/doc/info:$INFOPATH; export INFOPATH\nexport MANPATH=/usr/local/texlive/2021/texmf-dist/doc/man:$MANPATH; export MANPATH\nexport PATH=/usr/local/texlive/2021/bin/x86_64-linux:$PATH \n\n*\n\n*Then I had the same issue, I mean: when I ran sudo tlmgr: command not found.\n\nSolution:\n\n*\n\n*By giving entire PATH to sudo tlmgr in order to Update it:\nsudo /usr/local/texlive/2021/bin/x86_64-linux/tlmgr update --self\n\n\n*Then start graphic user interface in order to update all packages and \"handle symlinks in system dirs\" in Action buton.\nsudo /usr/local/texlive/2021/bin/x86_64-linux/tlmgr --gui\n", "Q: How do I install the experimental Nvidia open-source drivers?

In this cases I typically update my PC with the latest and then go to /var/cache/apt/archives to copy all .deb packages and put them in a pen drive. I then go to any/every other PCs and copy this content to one of the other PCs var/cache/apt/archives folder to save them time from having to download the exact same stuff or at least the common packages between PCs. This saves, in my case sometimes hours of waiting for an update/upgrade in all of this case scenarios, although it involves me having to move around.\nScenario 2 - Slow connections still exist. A couple of versions ago, there was not problems when doing an repository update, but it is known that some versions ago, the downloadable content to update the repositories grew.. A LOT. In past versions it took a small amount of time to at least Update the repositories. Nowadays it takes way more even with the same internet speed. This affects all users, but specially the ones with DSL connections or slower.\nSo my questions go in this order of importance (Taking into consideration users from both scenarios):\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there any way to reduce size and time when doing a repository update?.\n\n*Are there any tools that could somehow cache or use multiple connections to speed up repository updates (Like apt-fast)?\n\n*Is there any talk for 12.04+ about any modifications to package compression, repository bandwidth or repository management in regards to optimizing speed for repository updates?\n\n*Is there a way to only detected the delta from packages and download the difference?\n\nA: You can at a minimum set up a caching server so you don't have to download .debs twice, or copy them by hand.\n\n\n*\n\n*Best way to cache apt downloads on a LAN?\n\nA: There is, or at least used to be, something called AptonCD which is meant to solve this kind of problem.

I have a VPS instance running Ubuntu Server version 10.04 LTS (Lucid Lynx).\nI have installed munin and munin-node. It is properly configured. It is working fine.\nThe problem is that I need to run the command sudo service munin-node start for it to start.\nIf I reboot the system (either with sudo reboot now or using a web-based control panel), this service does not start. I need to run the command above for it to start.\nI tried \"everything\" to troubleshoot, with no success.\n1) It SHOULD simply start as many other programs I installed in this VPS using aptitude (ProFTPd, NginX, MySQL, monit, Icecast, Postfix, and lots of others). It does not.\n2) I tried adding service munin-node start at /etc/rc.local as I have successfully done to start another service.

After a reboot... it does not start!\n4) I ran grep -r munin * to see everything munin-related at /var/log\nIn my few years as sys admin, I have never been so clueless like this time.\nWhat is really impressive is that a simple service munin-node start (or equivalent) once the system is up and running... and the service starts normally.\nIdeas? Suggestions?\nI am about to try this tip from another question, if everything else fails...\n\nA: Well, I may have not found exactly the why, but I have found a solution.\nI have changed a couple of lines from the /etc/init/munin-node.conf upstart config file, and now munin-node starts automatically on reboot, as I wanted.\nI substituted the existent \"start on\" and \"stop on\" clauses for the ones found at the MySQL upstart config file at /etc/init/mysql.conf\nBelow is my modified snippet from /etc/init/munin-node.conf, which now works for me:\n#start on (filesystem and net-device-up IFACE=lo)\n#stop on runlevel [!2345]\n\nstart on (net-device-up\n          and local-filesystems\n      and runlevel [2345])\nstop on runlevel [016]\n\nI have just commented the original \"start on\" and \"stop on\" lines, and added the \"start on\" and \"stop on\" lines from mysql.conf.\nIt would be great if some expert here explained the meaning of these lines for us...\nThank you.\n\nA: In my opinion, the best way to start the munin-node service is to have in your /etc/init/munin-node.conf a line like this:\nstart on (net-device-up IFACE!=lo and local-filesystems)\n\nThat's because you need an interface (other than lo) on which munin-node to listen and you also need your local filesystems to be mounted, for the statistics data to be accessed.\nYou can use the runlevel directive, but it's not recommended:\n\nThe difference in whether to use the more generic 'runlevel' or the more explicit local->filesystems(7) and net-device-up events should be guided by your job's behaviour. If >your service will come up without a valid network interface (for instance, it binds to >0.0.0.0, or uses setsockopt(2) SO_FREEBIND), then the runlevel event is preferable, as >your service will start a bit earlier and start in parallel with other services.\nHowever if your service requires that a non-loopback interface is configured for some >reason (i.e., it will not start without broadcasting capabilities), then explicitly >saying \"once a non loopback device has come up\" can help.\n\nFrom the Ubuntu upstart cookbook: http://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/#start-on\n", "Q: Why can't I make a file association in Nautilus?

But in the Properties->Open With dialog in Nautilus, Quarry is not availaible. And because in 11.10 Nautilus doesn't longer provides the option to add a custom command to open an application, i have no way to add a file association.\n\nA: I had the same issue with Nautilus not allowing me to set acroread as\nthe default for pdf files.

I just recently installed Ubuntu Desktop 11.10 on my laptop.\nThe laptop is a Toshiba Satellite m645. It does not have a Bluetooth radio in it so I plugged in an IO gear USB Bluetooth adapter. The model is GBU421 and upon further inquiry I found out that the radio is a Broadcomm BCM2046b1.\nI have discovered that lsusb shows the radio as being found in the computer - but the Gnome Bluetooth manager says that there is nothing there. So I am guessing it is a problem with Gnome Bluetooth manager not with Linux in general.\nIs there anything I can try in order to make this work?\n\nA: I would strongly suggest installing blueman  - which is a Bluetooth manager with a lot of options and, in my experience, much better support for devices.\nYou can install the tool by clicking the little package icon in the above paragraph or opening a terminal and typing:\nsudo apt-get install blueman\n\n", "Q: How can I restore configuration files? I would like to restore LightDM to its default state, because for some reason\n/etc/lightdm/unity-greeter.conf is now an empty file.\nDeleting /etc/lightdm/unity-greeter.conf and then running sudo apt-get install --reinstall unity-greeter doesn't create a new config file as you might expect. \nHow can I restore a missing config file?\n\nA: Find the package that owns the configuration file:\ndpkg --search /etc/path/to/config\n\nit will outputs something similar to:\nunity-greeter: /etc/lightdm/unity-greeter.conf\n\nso the package name is \"unity-greeter\", download the package:\napt-get download unity-greeter\n\nthen extract its file system tree data to a tar file:\ndpkg-deb --fsys-tarfile unity-greeter_version-0ubuntu1_amd64.deb > pkg.tar\n\nfinally extract only that exact configuration anywhere you want it to be:\ntar -Oxf pkg.tar ./etc/lightdm/unity-greeter.conf |\nsudo tee /etc/lightdm/unity-greeter.conf \n\n\n\n*\n\n*./etc/lightdm/unity-greeter.conf is the file name in our archive.\n\n*/etc/lightdm/unity-greeter.conf is where I'm sending it to be stored.\n\n\n\nOr as @Muru suggested, we can do it in one liner:\ndpkg-deb --fsys-tarfile unity-greeter_version-0ubuntu1_amd64.deb |\nsudo tar -x -C / ./etc/lightdm/unity-greeter.conf\n\n\nA: For many cases, the default configuration file is provided by a package directly. In such cases, you can extract the specific file from the package, thus easily recovering the file.\nTo check if a package provides the file, run dpkg -S on the full path of the file. For example:\n$ dpkg -S /etc/ssh/sshd_config /etc/ssh/ssh_config /etc/sudoers\ndpkg-query: no path found matching pattern /etc/ssh/sshd_config\nopenssh-client: /etc/ssh/ssh_config\nsudo: /etc/sudoers\n\nProvided by a package\nAs we can see, /etc/ssh/sshd_config is not directly provided by any package, but the other two are provided by openssh-client and sudo respectively. So, if you wished to recover /etc/ssh/ssh_config, first get the package:\napt-get download openssh-client\n\nNow, you can either extract the file directly to its intended location, or to its intended location relative to the current directory instead of /, if you wished to compare and contrast, or manually merge them or something. For the former:\ndpkg-deb --fsys-tarfile openssh-client_*.deb | sudo tar x ./etc/ssh/ssh_config -C /\n\nThe -C / tells tar to extract after changing to /, which means the target file will get replaced. If you remove it, tar will extract to the current directory, meaning ./etc/ssh/ssh_config will exist in your current directory.\nIf for some reason sudo doesn't work, use pkexec instead. If pkexec doesn't work either, reboot to recovery mode, mount / as rw. If that doesn't work...\n\nCreated by a package\nWhat about /etc/ssh/sshd_config? It doesn't seem to be provided by any package, so how did it appear?\nIn this case (and in many other such cases, another example being /etc/modules), the file was created using a package maintainer script while installation. This is often done when the configuration file needs to be changed due to user responses to queries. OpenSSH, for example, asks if PermitRootLogin should be changed to no, in newer versions, among other things.\nTo identify such cases, try greping through the maintainer scripts.

I tried removing the files/directory and starting over, tried moving the directory to ~/usr/share... instead, tried restarting, tried updating my packages. No luck. \n\nA: The new location for the language specs is ~/.local/share/gtksourceview-3.0/language-specs/ (note the 3 instead of the 2). If you put your .lang files there, they should work like they did before.\nI'm not sure about the gedit themes. Are they actually gtksourceview styles? They have made the same move.\nThere is also an old folder ~/.gnome2/gedit on my system, and also one in ~/.local/share/gedit. You could try moving files from the first of these folders to the latter and see if that solves your issue. \n\nA: Good question! I struggled to find the answer for a while, and finally found that language specs were relocated to:\n/usr/share/gtksourceview-2.0/language-specs/\n/usr/share/gtksourceview-3.0/language-specs/\n\nSearching for all .lang files on my system, I found that there is also a gtksourceview-3.0 directory which shares many language files that are only slightly different (diff'ing each pair, most feature very small changes to licenses, etc).\nAfter adding my .lang file to both folders, I was able to use the syntax highlighting I so dearly desired!\n", "Q: GNOME top panel discolored when running fglrx \nPossible Duplicate:\nAti incompatible with Gnome-shell? \n\nI installed Gnome-Shell on Ubuntu 11.10 and the top bar has a strange glitch:\n\nI also installed ATI/AMD proprietary FGLRX graphics drivers but the \"post-release updates\" fails to install. \n\nA: This is a bug with the ATI/AMD drivers not being compatible.

I'm setting up a HTPC with Ubuntu 64-bit, using UEFI and RAID with GPT disks.\nIs it possible for the EFI system partition (partition type 0xEF00) to be part of a RAID1 array using mdadm? I'm hoping that metadata version 1.0 (at the end of the disk) will allow this.\nAlso, what should \"device for boot loader installation\" be set too, or does that only apply to MBR disks?\n\nA: After much experimentation I think this is the answer:\nThe EFI system partition (usually mounted at /boot/efi/) doesn't hold many files, unless e.g. GRUB is stored directly there instead of /boot/grub/. The contents usually don't change, so there is no need to RAID the partition. Having multiple copies of the partition across different disks would also require the UEFI boot entries to be set with efibootmgr; usually GRUB initialises this based on the mounted partition of /boot/efi/.\nSo it seems that it's both not needed, and not easy to do.\n\nA: I think the short answer is: No, EFI system partitions (ESPs) cannot be RAID-ed. However, you can still get RAID-like advantages if you clone the ESP between you RAID disks and add both partitions into the EFI boot chain. For details, see this 20.04 link or this 18.04 link, or this 16.04 link.\n\nA: No it's not possible yet, most motherboards the have UEFI can read of a limited number of partition types for the EFI (eg. FAT32) and RAID is not one of them.\n\nA: As you say, mdadm metadata ver. 1.0 does the job.\nI've managed to get working configuration that Gigabyte's GA-C1037UN-EU EFI was able to boot.\nThis configuration is limited to RAID1 for ESP partition, but allows to use any RAID configuration for the rest of the partitions.\nLet show RAID1 on two drives as example. Every disk is partitioned in the next way:\nsda (gpt)\n--sda1 (512MB)\n  mdadm array member with 1.0 metadata format\n  boot and esp flags set\n--sda2 (rest of disk)\n  mdadm array member with 1.2 metadata format\n\nFirst RAID created over sdX1 partitions on each drive and used for ESP partition. Rest of the drives capacity can be used in any manner, for example, in RAID1 too.\nLet the first RAID be /dev/md/efi and the second /dev/md/data.\n/dev/md/efi should not use any partitioning labels, such as MBR or GPT. /dev/md/data can be partitioned later or used as LVM pv. For example:\n/dev/md/efi\n--fat32 fs, mounting to /boot/efi/\n/dev/md/data\n--/dev/md/data1\n  linux swap partition\n--/dev/md/data2\n  ext4 root partition\n  ... (other needed partitions)\n\nMetadata ver. 1.0 has one simple feature: it's superblock is stored at the end of the RAID partition, so BIOS can detect plain FAT32 partition with ESP and BOOT flags. So nothing prevents BIOS from searching EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.EFI on this partition and booting from it.\nMain limitation of this method is that GRUB should be configured to install bootable EFI file in path for removable media, because efibootmgr is trying to make BIOS boot directly from md device, not sdX. This can be done using grub-install with --removable flag.\nUPD. There are compatibility issues. Tried same configuration on ASUS P8Z68-V PRO/GEN3 motherboard. System won't boot no matter what I do.\n\nA: Technically, yes, the ESP can be mirrored when putting the RAID superblock at the end (which is the case if you create a Linux RAID-1 version 1.0 format superblock).\nIn such a setup the raided ESP is indistinguishable from a non-raided ESP by the UEFI firmware.\nHowever, this mode isn't supported by Ubuntu and none of the Ubuntu tooling works with such a setup. (In contrast e.g. to Fedora.)\n\nHowever, having redundant and synced ESPs is still important, even if their content doesn't change often. Package updates that write to the ESP do happen, latest on the next dist-upgrade. Also, if one drive fails you need a redundant ESP to still being able to boot from the other leg of your root filesystem, i.e. when that was created on a RAID-1. And then is should better contain current software that is compatible with the rest of the Ubuntu system.\n\nFortunately, Ubuntu nowadays supports redundant ESPs in other ways. That means their grub package can be reconfigured to always update a second ESP, as well, whenever the system writes to the ESP:\n\n*\n\n*related UNIX-SE answer with some details for Ubuntu 20.04\n\n*bug report comments that discuss RAID-1 ESP vs. Ubuntu's tooling for redundancy - i.e. the 36th and following comments\n\n", "Q: How to disable windows minimization to the \"Activities button\" on Gnome?

Now  I'm running Xfce4 on the same machine and it just works, no idea why...\n\nA: Although I can add the resolution mode with Xrandr I can't make it permanent in Oneiric, but regarding the Plymouth problem, it has to do with the system booting up, by the time the sequence gets to the line where it says to load the plymouth animation of your choice is already too late and \"decides\" not to run it, but you can change the order in which that command is executed.

(Which, I discovered, fixed the black startup screen problem somehow. So now everything is working good.) I first tried just putting the xrandr command to make the higher resolution availible, but that didn't work because it was run too late.

I don't run any games.\n\nA: There is some risk of overheating the card (GPU and VRMs) if you turn off the fan completely - keep an eye on the temperatures before and after turning off the fan.  The ATI/AMD control panel should let you check this, and gkrellm also monitors GPU temperature along with many other things.\nThe RadeonHD 5870 is a very high-end card if you don't run games - you could save quite a bit of power and noise by replacing it with something like an HD 5450 at $50, which has fanless (passive) versions available.  Unless perhaps you boot into Windows for games, in which case ignore this :)\n\nA: You could always open terminal and type in\naticonfig --pplib-cmd \"set fanspeed 0 ###\" \nreplace the #'s with the fanspeed percenteage you want. \nfor example if you want you want to have your fan run at 35% speed you'd open terminal and type in\naticonfig --pplib-cmd \"set fanspeed 0 35\"\nhope this helps\n\nA: You may want to set a lower power profile for your Radeon.

I'm using ubuntu since very long time, developing web applications.\nAfter update to version 11.10 I Was very disapointed to see that Quanta Plus is NO LONGER SUPPORTED in this version.\nQuanta is only one so powerful web development tool in linux distributions, after You removed it, I can't work under ubuntu.\nDid You just forgot to put Quanta in repos ?\nPlease advice, Thanx !\n\nA: The last version of Quanta Plus was released 3,5 years ago, it's website seems to be down at the moment so it seems the project is pretty much dead. Which is a pity, I used to use it.\nYour options are either to find a replacement (kate is quite good as an editor, though maybe has less features for html/php coding) - or be a real man and see what it takes to compile it from the source. If you do this, maybe you'll become a new maintainer...\nUPD: Actually, the last commit in the Quanta's repository seems to be almost 4 years ago - I'm not even sure there ever was a KDE4 version... most likely it remained a KDE3 application, which makes it surprising it was still working in 11.04.\n\nA: The Quanta's KDE mailinglist archives: http://lists.kde.org/?l=quanta&r=1&w=2\nA topic (Any progress on Quanta for KDE 4?) : http://lists.kde.org/?t=130763123700002&r=1&w=2\n\nA: I have been unhappy with the upgrade from 11.04 to 11.10 because a lot of things got broken, not the least of which is Quanta Plus. Also kdenlive and a few others. I have work to get done and compared to Quanta everything else is a toy. \nI'm seriously considering down-grading to 11.04 so I can get my productivity tools back!!\n\nA: I can say for sure that there is a way to install and run Quanta Plus on 11.10 as I have been using it on 11.10 for about 4 weeks. I am trying very hard to remember what I had to do to install it but it was something very simple like checking the unchecked boxes in repository list under the 2nd tab. Although I have just done this on a brand new installation and it is not working. Perhaps the first time I got it to work is when I upgraded from 11.04 to 11.10 so the program was still there, but if you do a fresh install then it is not there as the KDE packages are depreciated so I don't think there is an answer. I am going to try komodo-edit and see how that works but like others I am super disappointed that Ubuntu have not kept the excellent program Quanta in their new version. Especially when so many of us rely on using it every day for our jobs. \n\nA: Quanta can be installed easily on ubuntu. Just follow the instructions given here\nhttp://www.binarytides.com/install-quanta-plus-ubuntu-12-10/\n", "Q: How to manage users and groups using GUI? Just switched from 10.04 to 11.10. I'm wondering about the limited options in the GUI for managing users and groups. Where is the old GUI to change groups, id's, etc. I know that I can do this from cli, that's no problem. But I want this comfortable GUI back. \n\nA: This answer was merged from a question about how to make a user an administrator; while it does answer this more general question, making administrators is its focus.\nBeing An Administrator Consists of (Specific) Group Membership\nBefore actually managing users and groups, if you want to make one or more users administrators, you should know what it means to be an administrator in Ubuntu.\nAn administrator can run commands as root, in two ways:\n\n*\n\n*With sudo.\n\n*With PolicyKit. (But default, PolicyKit is not present on Ubuntu Server systems.)\n\nThis power is conferred to users by membership in the appropriate group.\n\n*\n\n*In Ubuntu 11.10 and earlier, administrators are members of the admin group.\n\n*In Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and later, administrators are members of the sudo group.\n\nThere are a couple complexities:\n\n*\n\n*The sudo group exists in 11.10 and earlier, it's just not used (by default).\n\n*The admin group doesn't exist on a freshly installed 12.04 system, but it continues to exist (and its members continue to have administrative abilities) on Ubuntu 12.04 systems upgraded from previous releases.\n\nTherefore, here are some reasonable guidelines for how to make a user an administrator in Ubuntu:\n\n*\n\n*If you're running Ubuntu 11.10 or earlier, just put the user in the admin group.\n\n*If you're running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (or later), put the user in the sudo group, and if the admin group exists, put the user there too.\n\n\nYou have a few options for managing users and groups.\nInstall and Run the Classic \"Users and Groups\" Utility\nYou'll perhaps be happy to hear that (as John S Gruber has pointed out) the old GUI utility for managing users and groups still exists, though you may have to install the package that provides it. I'm talking about the utility that was invoked in menu-driven interfaces via System > Administration > Users and Groups.\nThis classic utility is provided by the gnome-system-tools  package, which you can install in the Software Center by clicking that link, or in the Terminal by running these commands:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gnome-system-tools\n\nThe name of the Users and Groups utility is users-admin, so you can find it normally in your graphical interface, or you can run it manually with that name. That is, here are some ways to run the utility once it's installed:\n\n*\n\n*Press Alt+F2. Type users-admin. Press Enter.\n\n*Press Ctrl+Alt+T. Type users-admin. Press Enter.\n\n*In Unity, start to type users and groups. So long as gnome-system-tools is installed, the Users and Groups utility will come up.\n\n*If you use a desktop environment that has menus, find Users and Groups in the Administration, System Tools, or Preferences menu.\n\n\nBut don't run sudo user-admin, or even gksu/gksudo/kdesudo users-admin. users-admin will actually not work when run as root. (It is designed to use PolicyKit rather than sudo to gain the necessary privileges to create and modify users and groups on the system.)\n\nOn some Ubuntu variants, such as Lubuntu, users-admin is already installed and is the standard way to manage users and groups.\nUse GNOME Control Center to Manage Users and Groups\nThe new, standard way to manage users and groups is with the GNOME Control Center, accessible from the session menu. Click the gear icon in the top panel (at the upper-right corner of the screen), and click System Settings....\n\nIn System Settings (also called the GNOME Control Center), click User Accounts (it's near the bottom, in the \"System\" category).\n\nYou can then manage users, including what groups they're members of, with this part of the GNOME Control Center.\n\nUse Command-Line Utilities\nIf you...\n\n*\n\n*are running Ubuntu Server, or some other Ubuntu system with no GUI, or\n\n*just prefer to use command-line utilities, or\n\n*are running some weird desktop environment that doesn't come with a graphical utility to manage users and groups\n\n...then you can manage users and groups from the command-line.\nThe recommended utility for adding a user from the command-line (in Ubuntu, and also in Debian and other Debian-based OSes) is adduser. The simplest way to use it is just to run:\nsudo adduser --add_extra_groups username\n\n*\n\n*You may be prompted for your password first (that's how sudo works).\n\n*Then you're asked a series of questions. Besides their real name and password, if you don't have an answer to any of the questions, just press Enter.\n\n*The user is made a member of the default groups for user accounts that do represent real human beings, but do not have administrative powers.\n\n\nClick here to read as text.\nTo make a user an administrator from the command-line, just add them to the appropriate group. usermod is an excellent utility for this purpose. The -G flag means you're specifying one or more new groups, and the -a flag means you're adding these to whatever groups the user is already a member of, rather than replacing the old list of groups with a new one.\nDepending on what version of Ubuntu you're running (as detailed above), use one or both of these commands:\nsudo usermod -a -G sudo username\nsudo usermod -a -G admin username\n\nA: You can edit users by going under System Settings (either search for it in the Dash, or select it as the first entry under the power cog) and selecting User Accounts.\n\nAlternatively, you may search the Ubuntu Software Center or use apt-get to install the gnome-system-tools package, then run users-admin afterwards to get to working with groups (source).\n\nA: Gnome System Tools for 11.10 & later Ubuntu versions\nThe old Users and Groups GUI is available by installing from Software Center the gnome-system-tools package\n\nor from a terminal:\nsudo apt-get install gnome-system-tools\n\nSearch in Dash:\n\nClick and it will run the Users and Groups applet:\n\n\nA: For adding and deleting standard and administrative users I'd recommend that you use the standard tool Alex mentioned in his helpful answer. You will need to unlock the program and then click on the \"+\" on the bottom left. You can also administer passwords with this tool.\nIf you need to add groups or add users to groups you can install the gnome-system-tools (Cross-platform configuration utilities for GNOME) package.\nAfter adding that you can find the additional settings by searching the dash for Users and Groups\n\nA: You can add both standard and administrator users using the settings->user accounts pane. You can set the password after the account has been added.\nIf you need more fine-grained control over which groups an account is in you will need to use the usermod program. \n", "Q: How to access blocked site? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to access Facebook and other forbidden websites in China? \n\nIn China facebook,youtube,twitter and some more sites are blocked ..so how can we access this sites ?

When I press the power button a dialog opens, but I want to shutdown the system without receiving \"Do you really really want to shutdown?\". How can I choose a direct shutdown action on a pressed power button? \nI had the same problem with the 11.04 version, but I don't remember the solution and yesterday I upgraded to Ubuntu 11.10.\n\nA: Lid Close Action\nTo set up the Laptop Lid Close Action you have to install Advanced Setting (or the Gnome Tweak Tool).  It is in the USC (Ubuntu Software Center) under either tweak or Advanced Settings. If installed press the super button and type in tweak or advanced and choose the Advanced Settings.  When it opens choose the shell tab;\n\nPress the arrows and choose you desired on both on AC and on battery;\n\nDefault buttons behavior\nInstall dconf-tools:\nsudo apt-get install dconf-tools\n\nPress alt+f2 and open dconf-editor (or in a terminal type dconf-editor)\nNavigate to org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power and set your default button-power action there:\n\nOn some systems you will also need to mark the item suppress-logout-restart-shutdown.\n\nA: Bruno's answer is only half-correct.\nAfter installing dconf, you should navigate to apps>indicator-session\nPlace a check mark for the item \"suppress-logout-restart-shutdown.\"\nThis will work for Unity in Ubuntu 11.10 but not for Gnome 3 or Gnome Classic.\n\nA: That didn't work for me in unity or gnome-shell(prompt was always shown). So I've used this manual\nfrom arch linux wiki. I've created file /etc/acpi/events/power with the content:\nevent=button/power (PWR.||PBTN)\naction=/sbin/poweroff\n\nand executed a command:\nsudo acpid restart (don't know exactly if it's right command)\nAnd then by pressing hardware power-button computer shotdowns(the prompt will be shown, but that won't stop shutdown process).\n\nA: I'm afraid that the first answers didn't work for me, I think that the 'graphical solutions' only work for the upper right indicator, not for the power button. rulet solution works for me, I think I can improve it and make the prompt completely disappear. Instead of creating a new file you can use existing /etc/acpi/events/powerbtn file\nsudo -H gedit /etc/acpi/events/powerbtn\n\nAdd # to comment line: \n#action=/etc/acpi/powerbtn.sh\n\nAdd a new line: \naction=/sbin/poweroff\n\nSave file. Open a console and type: \nsudo acpid restart\n\nThat works for me AND the prompt has gone, just like in ubuntu 11.04. Wish this helps.\n\nA: This is the quick, simple answer I needed:\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power button-power 'hibernate'\n\nIf you want to see your settings first, try this:\ngsettings get org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power button-power\n\nOr maybe this if you want to see all the power settings:\ngsettings list-recursively org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power\n\n\nA: I wanted to change the power button to suspend-to-RAM. On a Ubuntu 14.04 server (no Gnome/X), changing /etc/acpi/events/powerbtn to use an alternate action (/usr/sbin/pm-suspend) did not work. \nInstead, adding a single line to /etc/systemd/logind.conf was enough to do the trick: \n#HandlePowerKey=poweroff\nHandlePowerKey=suspend\n\nNow, pressing the power button causes instant suspend. \n\nA: For current Ubuntu and Lubuntu systems:\necho \"HandlePowerKey=suspend\" | sudo tee -a /etc/systemd/logind.conf\nsudo service systemd-logind suspend\n\n\nA: For me the solution was was this:\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power power-button-action suspend\n\n\nA: None of this worked on my 13.04 system.

My laptop display is killing my eyes at the login screen already because it starts at 100% brightness every time. \n\nA: It isn't default. Whenever I reboot my brightness is set to 100%. Then I set the brightness with command:\n$ echo 5 | sudo tee /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness\n\n\nA: Review of solutions and offering a (hopefully) better one\nPrevious solutions\n/sys/-based : good for console\n@gan\nThis works echo 5 > /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness but does not play well with X. More specifically, X is not aware about your preferred settings and you may end up needing to set the brightness manually again at least once, similar to bug #1042359 .\nsetpci-based : system-dependent, dangerous\n@erickjohncuevas\nSolutions based on things like setpci -s 01:00.0 F4.B=50 are dangerous. There, 01:00.0 is actually an ID targeting a particular board on the PCI bus. And it is system-dependent. That means blindly following this may write configuration registers on some other boards where it may mean anything, from just nothing to crashing the system at some point in the future. Anyway it does not play well with X either.\n\nProposed solution\nAdvantages/drawbacks\nThe solution below has these advantages:\n\n\n*\n\n*plays nice with X which is fully aware of the settings chosen\n\n*is more readable, thus maintainable\n\n*does not contain system-specific address, etc, and as a result may work on a wider range of hardware (e.g. where kernel does not know about backlight, or that don't even use PCI-based video board, think Ubuntu for ARM )\n\n\nIt assumes: Ubuntu using lightdm (that is 11.10 and beyond)\nIt only sets backlight when lightdm starts. But it can be combined with the /sys-based solution above if you really need to set backlight earlier.\nThe solution\nCopy-paste of these commands should do what you need (sudo will probably ask your password).\n\n\n*\n\n*Install xbacklight if it is not already installed (it is a small \npackage).\nsudo apt-get install xbacklight\n\nYou should test xbacklight on the command-line to see if it works. \nFor example:\nxbacklight = 100 ; sleep 2 ; xbacklight = 30\n\nTry to figure out a suitable value for your hardware and lighting \nconditions.\n\n*Create a small script running xbacklight.\nYou can change the =30 into another value if you wish.\nThe || true ensures that if xbacklight fails for any reason, X can \nstill start.\nsudo bash -c '{\n    echo \"#!/bin/bash\"\n    echo \"xbacklight =30 || true\"\n} >> /etc/lightdm/display-setup-script.sh '\n\n\n*Make the script executable\nsudo chmod a+rx /etc/lightdm/display-setup-script.sh\n\n\n*Instruct lightdm to run the script when starting X.\nSpecifically, this adds a line display-setup-script in a lightdm \nconfiguration file, but only if there is not one already.\nif grep -ri ^display-setup-script /etc/lightdm/\nthen \n  echo \"There may be already a display-setup-script. It may already do what you need. Else please adjust manually\" ; \nelse \n  if [[ -d /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d ]]\n  then\n    # Ubuntu 13.10 and above have lightdm.conf.d. 14.04 *only* has lightdm.conf.d.\n    DEST_CONF_FILE=/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/20-default-brightness.conf\n  else\n    # Ubuntu 12.04, 12.10, 14.10 do not have lightdm.conf.d, so we change main configuration file\n    DEST_CONF_FILE=/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf\n  fi\n  echo \"Writing into $DEST_CONF_FILE\"\n  sudo bash -c \"{ \n      echo '[SeatDefaults]' ; \n      echo display-setup-script=/etc/lightdm/display-setup-script.sh ; \n  } >> $DEST_CONF_FILE\" ; \nfi\n\nMay be tested by restarting lightdm from a root session on the console.  Or, more simply, by rebooting.\nTested on Ubuntu 12.04, 12.10, 13.10, 14.04, 14.10, 16.04.\nPlease provide feedback about your experience.\n\nA: source\nActually echoing some value to doesn't help in the brightness as the value will differ from system to system.\nFirst you need to set the brightness of the screen to the level comfortable to you, which can easily be done in System Settings → Brightness & Lock or by using the function keys.\nNow go to /sys/class/backlight/<folder> (my folder is intel_backlight)\n\nIn this folder you can see the actual_brightness file and the max_brightness file. (If you have made any changes to the brightness after opening this file, don't forget to refresh (using Ctrl+R or F5) to see the actual current settings.)\nNow we need the same value as in the brightness every time we start our system. This can be done by changing every time the value in this folder at the startup. We need to change the rc.local file.\nFirst type these commands in the terminal (which can be opened by searching for Terminal in the dash or by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T):\nsudo -i\ngedit /etc/rc.local\n\nand add the line\necho 900 > /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness\n\nReplace 900 with whatever value you need (that is, the value you got from the above procedure). Also replace intel_backlight with the folder name from /sys/class/backlight/.\nFor example, my /etc/rc.local:\n#!/bin/sh -e\n#\n# rc.local\n#\n# This script is executed at the end of each multiuser runlevel.\n# Make sure that the script will \"exit 0\" on success or any other\n# value on error.\n#\n# In order to enable or disable this script just change the execution\n# bits.\n#\n# By default this script does nothing.\nrfkill block bluetooth\necho 900 > /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness\n\nexit 0\n\nAs an aside, I added the line rfkill block bluetooth to my rc.local file as I don't use Bluetooth at all but Ubuntu starts Bluetooth every time it reboots (even if the Bluetooth was off before). You can also add it, and just in case you want to use Bluetooth you can always start it again, even if this line is in your rc.local).\nDon't change the value of exit 0 in the ending. If that line doesn't exist, add it.\nNow even if you have restarted the system you will have the same value that you need.\nBe careful to not put a brightness value greater than max_brightness, as that will throw you an error saying that it is an invalid argument.\n\nA: Have you look at redshift? It's designed for another purpose (make the screen less bluish at night), but it might solve your problem as well.\nTo install:\nsudo apt-get install redshift\n\nMy configuration file (~/.config/redshift.conf):\n[redshift]\n;temp-day=5700\n;temp-night=4600\nbrightness-day=1.0\nbrightness-night=0.75\ngamma=0.8\nadjustment-method=vidmode\nlocation-provider=manual\n\n[manual]\nlat=63.81415\nlon=20.41742\n\nIf you change brightness-day and brightness-night to a value you like and set temp-day and temp-night to the same value, you will effectively use redshift to set your brightness only.\nTo make redshift autostart at login, select Applications/System tools/Preferences/Startup applications/Add. Name: redshift. Command: /usr/bin/redshift.\n\nA: Once you have your preferred brightness set, you can follow the answer by N0rbert here: Brightness is reset to Maximum on every Restart. In summary:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:nrbrtx/sysvinit-backlight\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install sysvinit-backlight\n\nsudo service sysvinit-backlight status # Show current brightness levels and values saved in files\nsudo service sysvinit-backlight start # Set saved levels from files\nsudo service sysvinit-backlight stop # Save current levels to files\n\n", "Q: How can I boot only with unity2d? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I change the default session for LightDM when using auto-logins? \n\nI'm trying only use unity-2d on 11.10, have you got any idea about this simple possibility?\nthanks!\n\nA: *\n\n*If enabled, disable automatic login.\n\n*Log out.\n\n*Click on the cog icon next to your name in teh login screen.\n\n*Choose Ubuntu 2D.\n\n*Type your password and hit enter.\n\n\nA: Go to the login screen, click the little cog icon, and click \"Ubuntu 2D\".

That is, I want that by default whenever my browser or any other application hits a page of the form http://something.domain.com, or a page who is somehow connecting me to http://something.domain.com — that it blocks it and don't send anything without my explicit consent.\nI know we can block something completely by using hosts, but the trouble is that I may need to check these domains once in a while, so I would have to keep removing and adding it to hosts. Which is ok if I can refresh it somehow, or have a script do it quickly for me.\nIs there a simple way to do it?\nI have the impression it can be done with iptables, but this is a subject I am not familiar with.\n\nA: There is a Linux version of SelfControl program which essentially does that - blocks a list of domains for a specified number of hours. It does this using iptables, so you may consider it a nice wrapper for shell commands. The difference from your description is that it intentionally makes it difficult to unblock a domain - to make self-control a bit easier :)\nOther options, such as editing /etc/hosts or writing a script which adds/removes an iptables rule - are also viable.\nAt least you can study SelfControl source to see how it manipulates iptables.\n", "Q: PC logs off instead of shuts down I’ve upgraded to Ubuntu 11.10 but I have a problem with shutdown.

In previous versions of Ubuntu, and current versions of Debian, you can unlock a fully encrypted system (using dmcrypt and LUKS) at boot time over SSH.\nIt was as easy as:\n\n\n*\n\n*Installing the encrypted system using the Ubuntu alternate installer disk or normal Debian installer disk and choosing to encrypt the system.\n\n*After the system is installed, adding the  dropbear and busybox packages.\n\n*Updating the initram-fs to authorize your ssh key.\n\n\nAt boot time, you'd just ssh to the machine, and do:\necho -ne \"keyphrase\" > /lib/cryptsetup/passfifo\n\nThe machine would then unlock and boot the encrypted system.\nUsing the exact same steps on Ubuntu 11.10, I can ssh to the machine, but /lib/cryptsetup/passfifo doesn't exist.\nThere appears to be no way to unlock the system over ssh. I'm not sure where to look to see if this functionality changed or if it was removed.\n\nA: Just done some googling and it appears that plymouth gets in the way. If plymouth is there then on boot then cryptsetup will ask plymouth for the password and that means it's not using passfifo.\nThe best workaround appears to be putting the following script in the directory /usr/share/initramfs-tools/hooks/ After you've put it there you can chmod +x and then you have to update-initramfs -u. You should then be able to use the unlock command (which is created by the script below).\nThis relies on you using an ssh key to login with.

What is the easiest way to send a file:\n\n\n*\n\n*from an Ubuntu machine,\n\n*to another Ubuntu user (if also to others even better) who is out of your local network,\n\n*through an encrypted file transfer,\n\n*using only free and open source software,\n\n*preferably not depending on third parties like cloud apps where you have to upload the file,\n\n*preferably not revealing your IP address and not making your machine in any way more vulnerable to the receiver of the file.\n\n\nHow to quickly set it up?\n\nA: Your requirements #5 (no third-party/cloud storage) and #6 (no\nIP/hostname disclosure) are in mutual conflict: to transfer a file to\na remote computer, you either make a direct connection or you don't.\nIf you do, the remote end will have your IP address (just because of\nthe way TCP/IP works); if you don't, then by assumption you are\nrelaying on a third party to do the transfer and they have to store\nyour data.\nThat said, there are a few approximations to your request.\nF*EX: using web-based 3rd party transfer\nThe F*EX server was born exactly\nfor this purpose.  From the fex package description:\n\nF*EX (Frams's Fast File EXchange) is a service that can be used to allow users anywhere on the Internet to exchange very large files quickly and\n   conveniently. \nThe sender uploads the file to the F*EX-server and the recipient automatically gets a notification e-mail with a download-URL. \nMain features of F*EX: \n  \n  \n*\n  \n*file transfer of virtually unlimited file size \n  \n*sender and recipient only need an e-mail program and a web browser (of any kind; they do not have to install any software) \n  [...]\n  \n*maintenance-free: no administration necessary beyond creating new F*EX accounts \n  \n*multiple recipients only require one stored copy \n  \n*F*EX uses HTTP and needs no firewall tunnels \n  \n*shell clients provided for commandline users: fexsend and fexget. (fex-utils package)\n  \n\nAs far as I understand, F*EX does not do encryption natively, but you\ncan just encrypt the file you want to send with GPG.\nThe F*EX server is entirely opens-sourced, so you just install and run\nit on a server you trust.\nThe FEX homepage explains in detail\nhow FEX compares with other file transfer services and protocols.\nsendfile: asynchronous file transfer across UNIX computers\nThe sendfile command has been\naround for about 10 years: you install it and and the accompanying\ndaemon on both the sending and the receiving end, and then the\ntransfer is as easy as typing:\nsendfile a.file user@otherhost\n\nIn addition, sendfile can automatically encrypt the file using GPG\n(look for the -pe and -ps options).\nSince this makes a direct connection, however:\n\n\n*\n\n*the receiving computer must be up and running at some point,\n\n*it will have to be able to accept connections on the sendfile port, which means it should be reachable through a public IP\n\n*it can log the senders' IP address\nsendfile\nwas written by the same authors of F*EX (see above), and they explain\nthe reasons why they chose to switch to an HTTP-based 3rd-party\nservice on the sendfile homepage\ndo-it-yourself: use nc\nIt's relatively easy to do the file transfer using only\nnetcat.\nOn the receiving side, you run:\nnc -l 9999 > myfile\n\nAfter that, on the sending side, you run:\nnc otherhost 9999 < myfile\n\nAs usual, you should encrypt the file with GPG before sending (or you\ncan do that on-the-fly with a pipe, if you are confortable with the\nshell). You can substitute the 9999 with any other valid port\nnumber (for instance, to make several transfers at once).\nDisadvantages:\n\n\n*\n\n*coordination: you must issue the two commands on the two ends in the right order, so both the sender and the receiver must be online at the same time, and they must coordinate over, e.g., a chat or telephone line.\n\n*it will have to be able to accept connections on the 9999 port, which means it should be reachable through a public IP\n\n*the receiving end can log your IP address\n", "Q: Keyboard Shortcuts working differently In Natty I had my keyboard shortcuts configured to use most of the numbers on the numerical pad on the right side of my keyboard, e.g. 8 turned volume up, 2 down, 4 previous  track, 6 next track, 1 play/pause and 0 to launch default media player. Since I installed Oneric I went into keyboard shortcuts and set them all to the same keys but now none of them work, any ideas why? I've also tried using Number Lock but that hasnt worked either.\n\nA: I did some testing and found that I have the same problem. I'm guessing you can't do one-key shortcuts because most keys have a default function (such as num-pad 9 being page-up) and those functions probably overwrite all other user-defined functions. This can be seen if you set a custom shortcut, activated by key-pad 9 (should be seen as Page up (keypad) with num-lock off); when pressed, it will either (seemingly) do nothing or, if your selection is not at the top of the list, it will move it up (i.e. using its default function).\nHowever, you can still use those keys for shortcuts, but you will need to start the combination with something else (such as ctrl, alt, or shift).\nNote: the shortcut will not work if you have num-lock enabled (I'm not exactly sure why this is, though... maybe because it conflicts with the normal [i.e. non-num-pad] numbers).\n", "Q: If I am behind a router, how do I edit DNS resolution? Should I edit resolv.conf in my machine, or leave it 192.168.1.x and change something in the router? If in the router, how?\n\nA: If you need to modify the nameserver addresses (because, e.g., your router's nameserver is slow) you can set them in the NetworkManager's Connection Editor.\nIf you don't use NetworkManager then, in Ubuntu 11.10 or earlier, add a line to /etc/resolv.conf such as the following one.\nnameserver 8.8.8.8\n\nThe address 8.8.8.8 is the IP address of a public DNS server provided by Google, but of course you can use any other good DNS server IP address.\nIn Ubuntu 12.04 or later you cannot edit /etc/resolv.conf directly because it is generated dynamically and any manual changes will be overwritten. (Actually /run/resolvconf/resolv.conf is overwritten and /etc/resolv.conf is a symbolic link to the latter.) Instead you include nameserver addresses along with other information about each network interface. Again, if you use NetworkManager to configure an interface (a \"connection\" in NM parlance) then enter nameserver addresses accessible over that interface into the Additional DNS servers field for that interface, using the Connection Editor. If you use the ifup program to configure an interface, add the addresses onto a dns-nameservers line in /etc/network/interfaces. And so on.\n\nA: Since router IS the device that is connected to internet, you should play with DNS in router's GUI.\nHow to get into router's interface and where to edit DNS, depends on what router you're using but i'm sure googling something like \n<Routers model> DNS\n\nwill help. And yes, since it's router, it doesn't matter what OS you're using.\nCheers!\n", "Q: How to reduce the size of all gnome-shell icons? Is it me or is the size of icons in Gnome 3.2 huge?

In my experience, dpkg -l has failed to show some packages (with i386 arch), but dpkg --get-selections showed them clearly marking them as package_name:i386.

So is that a no-go for me?\nAnd is there any way to load nvidia module before Plymouth, it's still in fall-back mode, but on another PC intel's i915 module with i915.modeset=1 is working fine.\n\nA: I think you are out of luck, I'm afraid.\nGrub2 is started by BIOS before a kernel is loaded and BIOS is used to display its graphics.  After you make a selection Grub loads the kernel and then the kernel loads a graphics driver. But while Grub is running the tools it has available are sort of primitive compared to what you have later. It doesn't know how to communicate with a (fancy, powerful) graphics driver and there's not room in Grub to get very fancy itself. Grub2 fits in about a 31K area, if I'm not mistaken.\nWhile it is started by the kernel, Plymouth is started rather early as well, in order to get the splash screen up quite quickly so the user can be assured that something is happening. While it runs the kernel explores the system for its various devices and starts various things up. For non kms drivers, if I recall correctly, most of the proprietary graphics driver is loaded by X, which is itself started just before you see a login screen, too late to do you any good with Plymouth, I'm sorry to say.\n", "Q: Cannot execute .run file I'm running Ubuntu 11.10 64-bit, and I cannot execute .run files.

Clicking Show password confirms it's already the correct password, and clicking Connect without changing anything also successfully connects.\nWhy is it doing this, and how do I stop it?\n\nA: May I suggest that you run in a terminal\nnm-tool\n\nThat will give you a list of wireless access points that are in range, the frequency that they are transmitting on and the signal strength.\nYour wireless access point/router could be using the same frequency as another access point and if they are at the same or of similar strength it could explain why your connection is dropping. It may also mean that network manager after failing to connect to your access is now trying to connect to this other one. And that is why it is asking for a password. You have the right password for your access point but not for the access point that network manager is trying to connect to.\nYou may need to enter your router's set up program and select a different channel or frequency.\n\nA: Try restarting the network manager:\nsudo service network-manager restart\n\n", "Q: What does \"i915_program_error: Exceeded max nr indirect texture lookups\" mean and can I solve it?

Specifically, it's trying to do 8 indirect texture samples; the hardware can do 4, and it's trying to use 83 instructions in the shader; the hardware can do 64.\nDepending on how Braid is building these shaders this is either a strict hardware limitation - in which case you're out of luck - or (if it's using GLSL shaders) might get better as the Mesa shader compiler gets better at optimisation. You could try on a Ubuntu Precise LiveCD, as that will have a newer version of Mesa.\nIt's possible that your GPU does not have the hardware resources to run Braid.

It's entirely up to AMD to fix those issues, as nobody else is allowed to. \nMy solution would be to uninstall the proprietary driver and use the built-in driver instead, unless you have good reason to use the proprietary one. \n\nA: I have 12.04 LTS with a working HD5770. I installed the Catalyst Controle Center (client) + (Admin) and it's working in 2D 1920x1080 Analog. I don't use 3D (no glassesssss or plasma) with my Samsung Syncmaster 23\". I haven't try a hdmi-cabel/s/pdif. I'm disabled and bedridden so it's not like everyone does!\n\nA: ATI Graphical Cards like the Radeon HD-5770 is difficult working with.\nWhen I worked with Ubuntu 10.04 (Lucid) it was easy installed and all programs in-which I worked (music: concert videos - Youtube films, all with 1920x1080) and with VGA (2D).\nIn Precice 12.04 (with Gnome) the CCC-Suite (Catalyst Controle Center of the AMD-website) was installed this time during the installation of Precise (in 10.04 I made it myself). \nThis time I had a lot of difficulties watching a normal a DVD; watching a Blu-ray-disk on my PC or on an external bluray-player wasn't possible. The difficulty was that the CCC-driver Suite choose two screens itself (left a LG projector& to the right my Syncmaster 23\").\nEvery ATI Graphical Card user which would not use a TV-out card should with a double screen be very happy, but I wasn't happy at that time. After around 30-years working with Windows and now with Ubuntu again, was this also not so easy to understand.\nToday (a half year later in time) I understand a little more about the working of the different 'open source' software. I read of text the past period and there is a lot written about Ubuntu in all his types. In my Windows-period it was easy to use a GUI but you don't learn something about how it's made and how it shall work.\nAs newbie I'm a starter with CLI but with all steps I learn a lot and ask in a forum only a question how is this working or that is of course the easiest way. Now I can understand (before not) why in some Linux or Ubuntu-fora is no adequate reaction on a question. Most of the time everyone is in a hurry.... want a solution and never come back again.\nBack to the Graphic card. One time I had a crash (not so strange with a Intel Quad Core i7-920/ASUS P6T base) and when I came back up, I had no problems again..... but the Gnome Fallback was also away. I happy working under Gnome with the extra layer, but now I was back again in Unity (I can't working with it, in bed).\nI installed the last day of December 'Caïro Duck' this is something like working with a Mac :-).

I want a help to clear my concept about the difference between Gnome and Gnome Shell.\nI found Gnome Shell is not installed on my Ubuntu 11.10. I upgraded from Ubuntu 11.04. Why it is that? Gnome Shell is not shipped with Gnome 3. And why I need Gnome Shell?\nWhat extra capabilities I will get on desktop while installing Shell.\n\ntahir@StoneCode:~$ gnome-shell --version\nThe program 'gnome-shell' is\ncurrently not installed.  You can install it by typing: sudo apt-get\ninstall gnome-shell\n\n\nA: Gnome shell is an entirely different environment. Kind of like Gnome Classic vs Unity. If you install Gnome Shell you can select it as your desktop session at login by clicking the little gear beside your user name and selecting Gnome. (As opposed to Gnome Classic or Unity). It shouldn't affect anything else. If you don't like it you can just switch back to unity by clicking that same gear at login.\n\nA: A shell, in this context, is an application that you use to launch applications, switch between windows, etc. In Windows, that would be the taskbar. In Ubuntu, the default shell is called Unity and is what you see on your desktop when you first log in. It has a panel at the top which contains some indicators, a launcher on the left of the screen and lenses, which are used to find files, applications and other things. Gnome Shell is another shell that does the same things that Unity does, but in a different way. We have many different shells to choose from in Ubuntu, but Unity and Gnome Shell are both new and more \"modern\" than most other shells, so they are very popular. Since they're rather similar, people are fighting over which is best. It's rather silly, because you can have both and choose between them when you login. It's just like having two web browsers, except you can't use both at the same time. \nGnome, on the other hand, is a desktop environment. It has many, many applications, like file browser, video player, music player, photo album, an office suite called Gnome Office, and a web browser called Epiphany. Ubuntu is mostly based on Gnome, but have replaced some of Gnomes applications with more well known applications. For instance, Ubuntu uses Firefox instead of Epiphany, LibreOffice (formerly OpenOffice.org) instead of Gnome Office and Mozilla Thunderbird instead of Evolution. Ubuntu has chosen not to use Gnomes shell, instead making its own Unity. \nSome people use very strong words of approval or disapproval of the shells, much like some people hate Firefox and loves Opera. It's true that they have different strengths and weaknesses, but they're still just choices. If you're curious, then install and test them yourself. If you're happy with what you have, then you don't need to do anything. \nShells are important programs because they define how you interact with your desktop, but they're still just apps. \n\nA: Both 11.04 and 11.10 have Unity instead of Gnome shell, which is why Gnome shell is not installed. Whether you need it and why are questions only you can answer. As for extra capabilities, you get none, just a different GUI. \n\nA: I am sure that this question has been answered many times before. If not on this site then certainly on Ubuntu forums. For a different approach please read Mark Shuttleworth's blog for March of this year. There is a lot to read but it may give you an idea of why Canonical has gone for Unity and not Gnome shell or both.\nAnd then look at the second link and wonder as I do, why Canonical has made it so easy to use Gnome shell 3 with Gnome 3 in Ubuntu instead of Unity. They must be decent people is what I say.\nMark Shuttleworth and Canonical's issues with the Gnome organization\nInstalling Gnome shell in 11.10 made easy by Canonical\nRegards.\n", "Q: Restoring the Skype contact window If I close the Skype window, how do I get it back?\nClicking the Skype icon on the launcher just tries to create a new Skype instance.

Unfortunately I can't take a screenshot (If I do all you can see is the background), but for me the background of the top bar is the File Edit View etc menu from unity. The buttons don't actually work and are not clickable. Fonts, text etc looks the same as in the question mentioned above. This is really frustrating as I really want to use gnome shell. It appears the problem is with fgrlx, but I hope that by now there is a fix.\nAlso please not that the Activities screen (With the applications and the search, etc) is absolutely fine. Context menus and tooltips are glitched and skewed all around the system however.\n\nA: This is caused by the Global Menu in Unity. You can remove it by uninstalling the appmenu package, but this will likely cause problems if you still use Unity as well.\nAlternatively you could disable Nautilus from managing your desktop, but then your desktop would just be a plain wallpaper.\n", "Q: How to improve performances I have seen this question, but that question seems to be obsolete with the 11.10 version.\nLast week, I upgraded from 11.04 to 11.10. I am usually using gnome desktop clasic (without effects,also called the fail-safe), because my PC is very bad. Since the upgrade, everything is so slow. I also noticed that the temperature of the graphical chip* went from 30-40 C to 60 C, so my guess that the ubuntu 11.10 demands very powerful GPU.\nSo, what can be done to improve the performances of ubuntu 11.10?  \nLogging in using fail safe option is one thing, but it is not enough.\n*The temperature of the GPU can be seen from the nvidia-settings under the thermal settings.\n\nA: The primary cause of high GPU usage in an idle Ubuntu 11.10 desktop will be compiz, the compositing window manager.  You may be using a compositing window manager even if you are using the GNOME Classic or Unity 2D session instead of the default Unity session  To check if you are running compiz, you can run this command from a terminal:\n\nps awx | grep compiz\n\nTo switch from compiz to metacity, you can run:\n\nmetacity --replace\n\nSince this happened after upgrade from 11.04 to 11.10, another possible cause for GPU regressions may be the video drivers themselves.  You may want to check in the \"Additional Drivers\" tool (available from the commandline by running \"jockey-gtk\") that you are running the optimal driver for your card.  There may be several different drivers available that support your particular card, and you may find that one or the other provides better GPU performance.  For some older cards, it is even possible that the 3D acceleration provided by the open source nouveau driver may be your best bet.\n\nA: Posted as per request of the OP.\nAs for CPU usage, Ubuntu 11.04 shipped with kernel 2.6 while Ubuntu 11.10 comes with kernel 3.0. Your problems with CPU may possibly be due to that. Try googling your processor name for any bugs with Ubuntu 11.10.\nIt's probably not your case but, as an example, Sandy Bridge processors have some power issues with most recent kernels.\nIf you still have kernel 2.6 installed (it should then still be on the GRUB menu), you may try booting into that to see if its any better.\nRemark: I've actually misread the question initially thinking that you have a problem with the processor (CPU) heating itself. I'm glad that it worked anyway. However, since previous kernel does not have any issues with your GPU, the problem may well be due to different drivers as @slangasek suggested and you should refer to his answer for this part should you want to try fixing it.\n", "Q: How to port email from evolution to thunderbird? I updated ubuntu to 11.10 using the update notification.  I am also switching from Xubuntu to ubuntu - gnome interface.  I have been using evolution for years and would like to port the emails to thunderbird.\nI have looked at the similar questions with no luck and the thunderbird help on manually importing.  Most of these assume that the evolution file structure is similar to the evolution file structure.  \nWhen I set up thunderbird it seems to have imported the contacts from evolution (and actually removed them from evolution.  However no mail got transferred.  I found the evolution mail in ~/.local/share/evolution/mail/local .  this has folders.db and 3 directories - cur ,tmp, and new.  then there are the hidden files and directories.  Each directory has three related files with extensions .cmeta, .ibex.index, and .ibex.index.data.  Then all the directories had files that seem to contain the individual messages.  I have not looked at rhyme or reason to the file numbering/naming scheme.\nis there a nice way to import these files?\n\nA: Since the solutions above didn't work for me and because I think this should help a lot of users. Without guarantee ;-)\nWhy the problem is still relevant\nI've had the same problem and unfortunately Evolution was not able to export the mails correctly as mbox files. So I searched a good amount of time and finally found a solution.\nI have a lot of folders and really a lot of messages. For some reason Evolution created mbox-files being really big (about 2GB for 100MB of mails). The size wouldn't be that problem, but Thunderbird couldn't import that files.\nThe solution\nSo fortunately there is this python script which gives advanced users the opportunity to move mails from Evolution to Thunderbird.\nThe solution is described here:\nWFM\nI used: Thunderbird 12.0.1, Evolution 3.2.3, Ubuntu 12.04.\nUsing the python script to convert from maildir to mbox you can create a mbox-structure that is imported with only a couple of clicks:\n\n\n*\n\n*Better safe than sorry: Copy your maildir structure from ~/.local/share/evolution/mail/local/ to a directory of your choice - let's say /tmp/mail-copy/local\n\n*$ cd /tmp/mail-copy/\n\n*Use the script $ python maildir2mbox.py local LocalMbox\n\n*Open Thunderbird (should be installed and Import/Export Tools too)\n\n*Right click on your Inbox and select Import/Export->Import mbox file->Import one or more mbox files, with its/their subdirectories and select the /tmp/mail-copy/LocalMbox file\n\n*Enjoy your thousands of old mails :-)\n\n\nA: Have you seen this post?\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=10999504\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Backup Evolution: Alt-f, Backup evolution settings...\nInstall Thunderbird from Ubuntu Sotware Center and setup Thunderbird with your mail account information. Close Thunderbird,\n  after checking whether sending and receiving works.\n  \n*Open evolution and move all sub-folders (dragging them) to the highest level. Before going to the next step make sure no sub-folders\n  exist any more. Then close evolution.\n  \n*Open Nautilus.\nAssure you are in your /home/yourname folder. Press Control-h, now you see all hidden folders and files below your own folders, by\n  example: .aptitude Move to\n  /home/yourname/.local/share/evolution/mail/local/Inbox.sbd Press F3.\n  This opens another panel in Nautilus. \nIn this panel goto /home/yourname/thunderbird/xxxxxxx.default/Mail/ServerName\nThis servername you can find in Thunderbird account settings (Alt-e, a), go to Server Settings. Here you see the ServerName.\n  \n*Copy only the \"mailbox file\" files from your Evolution \"Inbox.sbd\" folder to the Thunderbird \"ServerName\" folder. Do not copy the other\n  files like xxx.cmeta, xxx.ibec.index, xxx.ibex.index.data etc.\n\n\nA: Unfortunately the above tip doesn't help me, it just create a mailbox file but, inside it, doesn't have all my messages.\nTo solve the problem I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*a backup of the mail in the evolution program using its File -> Do a backup possibility. It will create a .tar.gz file.\n\n*remove the Evolution program after purge it;\n\n*install thunderbird and configure it to your account;\n\n*re-install - from zero - evolution and, before accept all the indications, restore the .tar.gz backup: at this moment it will ask you if you want to migrate to maildir files and if so, it will create a mailbox just to 'in case' if you re grate the new format.\n\n*go to /~.local/share/evolution/mail/local_mbox and just copy the mbox files\n\n*paste it to your ~/.thunderbird/xxxdefalt/mail/localfolder\nThat's it.\n\nA: After trying all the above I found a much simpler solution. \nDrag and drop your Inbox icon in the left pane of evolution to your desktop. A file called Messages_from_Inbox will be written. Now rename it to Inbox and copy it to \n~/.thunderbird/whatever.default/mail_acct/ \n\nIf you open up thunderbird it will now be there. Repeat this procedure with any other folders that you need.\n\nA: You also can select messages in Evolution and press Ctrl + S to save messages as 'mbox'. Then copy the file to ~/.thunderbird/xxxxxx.default/Mail/mail_acc/. When you start Thunderbird it will automatically create a folder with your messages\n", "Q: How do I tell when a window demands attention?

(wine works fine with other .exe files)  \nAnybody knows something?\nI am using ubuntu 11.10 64-bit.  \n\nA: When trying to execute any Windows application with wine we need to make sure that it works correctly. Take the following steps to always know that your app will work:\n\n\n*\n\n*SEARCHING FOR WORKING APP - Search in google or the winehq.org site for the app you want to use to see what rating the app has. Ratings such as Platinum or Gold are good. Ratings as Silver are good in some cases. Ratings as bronze or garbage are typically very bad. The rating is for the user to know if the app will work flawlessly in the PC or not. Will it install correctly?. Will it run correctly?. Can the user make changes to the video, sound or control settings with no problems at all?.\nAll of this questions are used to add a rating to an app. If it works as it should in everything, the rating is Platinum. If it has 1 or 2 small problems, a Gold rating might appear. This continues until a Garbage rating where the app does not work at all. To search for an app you can use Firefox or Chrome and just type in the URL \"winehq leagueoflegends\" for example. This will typically show you in the first 3 results the winehq like so http://appdb.winehq.org... Click on the appdb.winehq.org links and you should arrive at the winehq page for that particular app. It will show you several users that have rated the app. If all of them rated the app as Garbage your best bet is that the app will not work with wine right now. You will have to wait for a newer update of wine. If most users have platinum or gold you have a good bet it will work correctly.\nYou can also go to: http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=application&sTitle=Browse%20Applications&sOrderBy=appName&bAscending=true to search for the app you want in there.\nEven better to go: http://appdb.winehq.org/index.php to see the best rating apps with the best score so far. Also make sure that the ratings applied to the app have the same version you are using of Wine or at least a very close version to it. An updated version is always better than an older version. Now that you know how to search first if your app works on wine or not we go to the next step. Wine installation.\n\n*INSTALLING LATEST WINE VERSION - Wine comes in several branches. The 1.2 stable branch and 1.3 dev branch. Let me be VERY CLEAR in this part. For the last 5 wine years in my life I have used always the latest. You can call it unstable, explosive, beta, alpha, dev or any name you want to give it but the fact remains. Any updated version of wine is always better than any older version. This is also true comparing the 1.2 stable versus the 1.3 dev.\nThe 1.2 is more stable in that it has been checked more for compatibility than the 1.3 dev branch but believe me when I say, the 1.3 dev is more compatible with more apps, has better solutions to many app problems, more directx fixes and in general will give you a better result than the 1.2 branch. Since the creation of the PPA for WineHQ I have used this as my 1.3 upgrading repository and it has never let me down. It has solved many problems with many apps, directx fixed, sound fixes and many MANY other. Every 2 weeks is like a party when a new release of the 1.3 branch comes to the PPA. So my really good suggestion is to use the 1.3 branch instead of the 1.2 stable one. And I mean GOOD SUGGESTION! since many problems will be gone in the 1.3 branch. The information to install the PPA is very easy as shown here: http://www.winehq.org/download/ubuntu\nAfter installing the PPA winehq, updating the repositories and downloading/upgrading to the 1.3.x  version of wine (Should be 1.3.30 right now. To check, go to the terminal and type wine --version or open winecfg and go to About tab.) we can continue with the configuration.\n\n*CONFIGURING WINE - There are a couple of things you can do to tune and configure wine. The first steps should be opening the winecfg app for wine. Just open the dash or ALT+F2 and type winecfg. It will begin an automatic update for wine. Wait a couple of seconds and then go to the Graphics and Audio Tabs to configure them. If an app does not work in fullscreen you can change the max resolution in the Graphics tab. If an app is not making a sound or has some sound problems you can change the sound options in the Audio tab. You also have the famous winetricks. WineTricks is used to install additional apps that are needed for other apps to work. Example are the latest DirectX, .NET Framework, etc.. To open winetricks do like winecfg above but type winetricks instead. For multiple apps running and configurations related to this I suggest to go here: Adjusting resolution for individual Wine programs\n\n*GETTING HELP - When asking for help in Askubuntu or in the winehq forums/bugtracker. Always remember to include the wine version you are using, any additional packages installed by winetricks (if any were installed), how did you install the app (Via steam, web, directly with a setup.exe, CD...) and how did you execute the app (via a desktop link, directly with the executable...) and additional information so anyone that has some knowledge can help.\nFollowing this 4 steps you can reduce:\n\n\n*\n\n*Amount of problems using Wine\n\n*Know if an app works or not in wine\n\n*Know which configurations work best for a particular app (Changing windows Version, graphics, sound...)\n\n*Know tricks for configuration in the appdb.winehq.org site for a specific app.\n\n*Save time while asking for help for a particular app.\n\n\nA: Wine is Windows compatibly layer for Linux. Unfortunately, it is not perfect and not every app runs, and after doing some research it appears that League of Legends is one of the games that does not work on wine. \nIf you still want to try and make it work, check out this page at WineHQ http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?bShowAll=true&bIsQueue=false&bIsRejected=false&sClass=version&sTitle=&sReturnTo=&iId=19141\nor this page over a Codeweavers (They create a non-free version of wine with support) \nhttp://www.codeweavers.com/compatibility/browse/name/?app_id=6282\nAs wine updates games like this should start to work better and more often. \n", "Q: GNOME 3.2 Screen keyboard, when opened onboard pops up When I enable the \"screen keyboard\" from the accessibility next to that the GNOME onscreen keyboard is started onboard is also opened. Is there a way to prevent this?!\n\n\nA: This a known bug. But if you're planning to use only Gnome Shell instead of Unity you could uninstall onboard\nsudo apt-get remove onboard\n\nIf you do this you won't be able to use onboard on LightDM.\nAnyway, it seems possible to use LightDM with Caribou, but the unity-greeter is coded to use Onboard, so it would be necessary to write a patch for unity-greeter.\nEDIT. Another workaround is to remove onboard autostart from /etc/xdg/autostart without removing onboard.\n", "Q: How do I clean up old packages and apps after upgrading? From an older query I found that sudo apt-get autoremove should be used. I did that and some packages got removed.\nBut the applications Computer Janitor and Pitivi are still present on the computer (these are not supposed to be in 11.10 from what I read), which made me wonder whether there are other unnecessary packages or old apps still present.\nIs there any way to clear up these applications and packages?\n\nA: The packages that were meant to be removed where removed. However, some applications were left because users may actually use them or need them. GIMP, for example, was replaced with Pitivi some time ago, but that doesn’t mean I should have to reinstall it every time I upgrade.\nIn other words, the fact that a package is no longer in the default selection of Ubuntu apps is no reason to automatically remove it on upgrade.\nYou can also remove apps by hand. This may be especially needed for Computer Janitor, because it may delete something that is actually necessary. Handle it with care if you keep it.\n\nA: I ran into various issues with not totally \"cleaned\" systems especially after upgrades as asked in this question.\nI hope this \"more thorough cleaning\" might help more than just me.\nIn my case I had a Server that started on 12.04 and went through various ppa's and ups/downs and experiments - after upgrading to 14.04 I fixed stuff the hard way - but after my upgrade to 16.04 this week a lot of things didn't work properly (like input on X11 at all).\nTo clean up and get rid of a lot without really reinstalling the machine I did the following:\nFirst I wanted to get rid of old ppas, especially in case they still would overwrite even the newer packages\nOther than just apt-add-repository -r this also tries to revert to the original\nSee this for more: Difference between \"ppa-purge\" and \"add-apt-repository -r\"?\n$ ppa-purge \"ppaname\"\n\nNext I got a list of all \"manual\" installed packages\n$ comm -23 <(apt-mark showmanual | sort -u) <(gzip -dc /var/log/installer/initial-status.gz | sed -n 's/^Package: //p' | sort -u) > manual.txt\n\nClean up in this file, remove all packages from this list that you would like to keep\n$ vim manual.txt\n\nThen set all these packages from manual to auto installed\n$ while read p; do sudo apt-mark auto ${p}; done <manual-to-remove.txt \n\nThis put a lot into the next autoremove, all desktops I ever tried I recognized a lot of the experiments I did the last years.\nBut other than hard removing them I could be sure that everything still needed by dependencies still woudl be fine.\n$ sudo apt-get autoremove\n\nIf you are really willing to clean up add --purge to the autoremove - this will remove all conffiles that are associated.\nBe careful if you are unsure if you want to keep anything.\nE voila:\n0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 1359 to remove and 0 not upgraded.\nAfter this operation, 3.810 MB disk space will be freed.\nThat was a lot of crap :-)\nSince these days everything just works (I knew from a test with a live image) I could now cleanly install kubuntu-desktop and was happy again - yay.\n\nA: From man apt-get: \n\nautoremove is used to remove packages that were automatically installed to satisfy dependencies for some package and that are no more needed.\n\nIf you want to remove those unwanted apps you should use apt-get remove <appname> (or apt-get purge <appname> to remove also app's config files).\nThen you can run apt-get autoremove to get rid of their dependencies.\nBe sure to check if apt-get isn't going to remove some really useful apps/dependencies before agreeing to proceed with uninstall process.\n\nA: You may have to do this manually. The best way to do so is via the Ubuntu Software Center under the \"Installed\" tab and removing the apps you don't want. You can also try installing BleachBit, which is a GUI for removing unwanted files and repositories. It has the option to clean up APTs but I never tries it myself. Maybe that may help. Try it and let me know. \n", "Q: Ubuntu 11.10 network speed Just upgraded to 11.10 from 11.04 . My internet speed is VERY slow now. I did a speed test with two similar laptops.

I just installed 11.10. One of the standard things I do on a new install of Ubuntu is change the action taken when I hit the prtscn key. By default the action is to take a screenshot. I change it so that it takes a screenshot by area. \nHere's how I do that in earlier versions:\nsystem>preferences>keyboard shortcuts\nAdd\nName: Take Area Screenshot\nShortcut: gnome-screenshot -a\nThen click printscreen. It will ask you to disable the normal screenshot. Say yes.\nHere's what I tried in 11.10\nsettings>keyboard>shortcuts\ngo under custom shortcut\nAdd\nName: Take Area Screenshot\nShortcut: gnome-screenshot -a\nAll seems good so far. I see a new row that shows disabled. That makes sense to me because I haven't yet assigned a key to it. But here's where I get hung up. If i click the prtscn it actually takes a screenshot. If I hold prtscn down for 3 seconds, my computer gets bogged down and when it finally recovers I have to cancel over 20 screenshots that it has taken. So I figured the problem is that I first need to disable the default screenshot shortcut. So I went there and click backspace, but no go.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: At this point I am convinced there is a bug such that you cannot actually connect the print screen button (prtScn) to any custom shortcut. The key works fine if you leave it as the default, but assign it to something else and it is wortheless. The best workaround I believe is to assign it to a different key instead. Other key combinations tend to work. I used the combination of ctrl + prtscn. \nHere are the instructions:\nOpen System Settings \nclick once on \"keyboard\"\nGo to the \"shortcuts\" tab\nClick \"Custom shortcuts\" from the list of items on the left\nClick the plus icon near the bottom of the windows.\nFill the name box in \"Print Screen by Area\"\nFill in the comand box \"gnome-screenshot -a\"\nNo you'll see the word \"disabled\" to the right of your new shortcut.\nClick on the word \"disabled\"\nClick again on the word \"disabled\" and it should change to \"New Shortcut\"\nPress ctrl + PrtScn and the word \"disabled\" will change to \"Ctrl+Print\"\nYou are done. You can close the system settings window.\n\nA: For future reference, in 12.04 you can use Shift+PrtScn to capture area.\n\nA: If you use compiz/unity3d then you can use compizconfig-settings-manager and the Gnome Compatibility plugin, and just swap them around.\n", "Q: Where do I file bugs for Jupiter applet?

Bear in mind in particular that, if at startup it is found that the  XDG_DOCUMENTS_DIR path actually doesn't lead to a valid directory, the setting for XDG_DOCUMENTS_DIR will be overwritten in user-dir.dirs, replacing it, in principle, with $HOME/Documents... (in fact, oddly, my experiments seem to find that it is usually replaced with $HOME, for some inexplicable reason).\nNB2 as an alternative to the above (especially if the \"special\" icon doesn't matter in particular to you), you could use a symlink ... which you can call \"Documents\".  In fact, you could have both: a symlink and a special icon for your target file.\nNB3 I don't believe you can make a symlink as suggested  ... AND give it a special DOCUMENTS icon!

Unity 2D is fine, and I'm using it right now.\n\nA: I have the same nvidia card (GeForce 6150SE nForce 430) and experienced the exact same problem as WPBloyd (desktop effects were very slow, but it was otherwise fine) using the nvidia driver.\nI followed the instructions on this page in order to use the \"Nouveau\" driver (open-source driver for nvidia cards).\n\nProblem: Need to fully remove -nvidia and installing or reinstall -nouveau from scratch\nHere is a recipe which removes all old video drivers, and reinstalls nouveau:\nsudo nvidia-settings --uninstall\nsudo apt-get remove --purge nvidia*\nsudo apt-get remove --purge  xserver-xorg-video-nouveau\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-common\nsudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-nouveau\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall  xserver-xorg-core\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg\n\n\n(I copied what I used; it is the same as on the last link, except that I suppressed server-xorg-video-nv, libgl1-mesa-glx and libgl1-mesa-dri because they did not seem to exist anymore)\nIt worked for me, I hope this can help somebody else :)\n\nA: The only and best recommendation to be done at this moment is to stick with ubuntu-2d. Nvidia and ATI cards and known to slow everything down (tried playing movies yet???) usind the 3d effects.

The current driver installed is 280.13.\nThe temperature of the card is 85°C. I have tried using LXDE and Unity 2D, but the temperature does not drop. Once it did drop to 76°C, but even that's quite a lot.\nIs there a fix to this? Do you think downgrading my driver would help? If so, how should I go about it?\n\nA: The options initially available for additional drivers were as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Nvidia accelerated graphics driver(version current) [Recommended]\n\n*Nvidia accelerated graphics driver(post-release updates)(version current-updates) \n\n\nInitially I had installed 1. using which caused high temperature.Now, I have installed 2. I am not entirely sure if it was only because of the driver but doing this did solve it.\nI hope someone explains as to what is the difference between the two clearly. This fixes the problem.\n\nA: Had the same problem with my Dell XPS L501X with GeForce GT 435M reporting temperatures of 96 - 97 and even touching 100 at one time resulting in shutdown. \nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current-updates seems to have resolved it for now. Every Ubuntu update 10.04 - 10.10 -> 11.04 -> 11.10 i have been facing this temp problem. \nUPDATE : Was still facing high GPU temperatures when i realized that the the air vents might be filled with dust.

This is shown by the lshw trace where it shows that the NIC has been disabled.\nAccording to this article, the NIC should be associated with the r8168 kernel module.  With the incorrect kernel module you will either get slow speeds or no connection what-so-ever.\nAccording to Launchpad - this is also a recognised bug with Oneiric - however, it looks like it has been resolved for 12.04 since Precise uses a newer kernel (v3.2)\n\nhardware issues\nFirst, let's rule out a NIC hardware failure - NICs can go bad (the firmware/ROM) - an indication of this is the fact that the MAC address is recognised as FF:FF:FF:FF:FF\nIf you last had a working NIC with Natty (or previous Ubuntu version) - then boot your PC with a LiveUSB/LiveCD.\nTest your wired connection - rerun sudo lshw -class network.  Look for the MAC address.  Also look to see if it still says disabled.\nIf it still fails to connect via a live usb/cd with the version of ubuntu it last worked with then you have a strong indication of hardware failure.\n\npotential software solutions\nOnce you have ruled out hardware issues, then lets concentrate on possible software solutions.\nFor the solutions below you will still need a valid internet connection...\nIf you have a spare NIC card that is not of this model I would insert this into your PC and connect to the internet via a wired connection.  If you can connect via wireless - do so.  Otherwise, you may need to move your hard-drive into another computer to do the following and then transfer it back to your original PC.\nFIRST - BACKUP YOUR SYSTEM with a good backup tool such as Clonezilla\nSuggested Fix 1\nAccording to the launchpad bug report, this is potentially fixed if you enable the proposed repository in software sources and install the package linux-backports-modules-3.0.0\nSuggested Fix 2\nYou may be able to download the Precise kernel (v3.2) and install this.\nFrom the mainline kernel area of launchpad:\nDownload the amd64 headers.deb,  headers_all.deb and the image_amd64.deb files\nthen install the kernel using the syntax:\nsudo dpkg -i [package_name].deb\n\nSuggested Fix 3\nThis is something you may be able to resolve by downloading the realtek driver and compiling it yourself.\nDownload the Linux source - at the time of writing this it is v8.028.00\nUnpack the tarball :\ntar vjxf r8168*.tar.bz2\n\nChange to the directory:\ncd r8168-8*\n\nCompile:\nsudo ./autorun.sh \n\nYou can check whether the driver is loaded by using following commands.\nlsmod | grep r8168\nifconfig -a\n\nIf there is a device name, ethX, shown on the monitor, the linux\ndriver is loaded. Then, you can use the following command to activate\nthe ethX.\nifconfig ethX up\n\nFinally, blacklist the r8169 driver add the following to /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\n#blacklist r8169 driver\nblacklist r8169\n\n\nPotential workarounds\nA similar bug-report mentioning odd-MAC addresses for the r8169 kernel module on older kernels gave a couple of suggested workarounds.\nwork around 1\nOnce booted stop and start the kernel module:\nsudo rmmod r8169 && sudo modprobe r8169\n\nwork around 2\nBoot from your Natty live CD - run ifconfig -a and record the MAC address for eth0.\nBoot into oneiric. Examine your udev persistent rules and map the correct MAC address to eth0\nsudo cp /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules /\nsudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules\n\nchange the MAC address.  If in doubt - please add to your question the contents of your rules file.\n\nA: HWaddr ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff\n\nReally? Is this your real MAC Address or you are spoofing ??\nChange your MAC Address from Broadcast address to something else(Spoof another address):\nsudo ifconfig eth0 hw ether xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx\nsudo service networking restart\n\nPlace the new MAC Address instead of xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx\n", "Q: System doesn't boot after amd 11.9 driver install Im having a bit of a problem with ubuntu.

I simply installed the paprefs package that adds to your tools pulseaudio preferences; I could then configure my card and voila!!!\n\nA: This chipset is fully supported by Ubuntu so you should be able to use without problems.\nTry this:\nClick the Speaker top right hand corner, click 'Sound preferences'. Select the 'Hardware' tab. In the drop down menu choose a Profile for your device that meets your speaker layout.\n\n\nA: you can activate the spdif output in the alsamixer. After that you get stereo sound out of your speakers.\nNow you use your Video player (eg. vlc) and configure it to pass trough the sound.\nWith that the reviever gets the digital signal and is able to give you 5.1 sound.\nvlc -> extra -> settings -> audio\nchoose Alsa-plugin\nuse spdif if possible\nand choose your soundcard\nworked for me and i hope for you too ;)\nhave fun\nAlex\n", "Q: Ubuntu feels slow after 11.10 update I recently updated Ubuntu to the latest 11.10 version.

However, it is inaccessible by any means I can think of, and located somewhere in the middle of the new partition, though I don't know exactly where.\nIs there any tools I could use to find the location of the file system or recover it or really, just anything to get access to my files there? Any help is appreciated.\n\nA: Have used the instructions on this link with great success many times.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/DataRecovery\nTips:\nAlways make a full image of the entire drive, then perform any relevant recovery efforts on the image.\nAlso, if you can, use a 10,000 RPM drive (Western Digital Raptor) or a SSD for holding the image during recovery - it will speed up your recovery efforts quite a bit.\nDoes that help?\n", "Q: No sound on HDMI with Radeon driver My PC has a build-in VT1828S chip.

Installing new packages on my recently installed Ubuntu machine is slow.

Can I switch to another mirror? Does that even pay off?\n\nIf you're on the main mirror (is that a mirror if it's the original?), things are going to probably suck pretty hard. The rule of thumb is to use whatever's local to you.\nYou can change your mirror using the Software Sources dialogue (run software-properties-gtk). I suggest you click other and then click Select Best Server.\nIf that still doesn't help, you could try guessing which mirror is going to have the most spare bandwidth.\n\nOr should I wait with the downloads until the big hype has cooled down?\n\nYou might find that available bandwidth varies based on the time of day. If you use a local mirror and can leave it overnight, you might wake up and find everything complete.\n", "Q: How portable are Binaries compiled in Ubuntu? The title says it all, actually. But allow me to specify the question:\nAssuming I were to compile an application that uses libffi, libGL, dlfcn, and SDL, would said binary run on other Linux distributions with same architecture, etc?\nThe reason I ask is because of the directory /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu - I might be wrong, but I assume this directory is something rather Ubuntu-specific, no?\nSo, how portable are binaries compiled on Ubuntu really?\n\nA: Generally, yes, but it depends.  Libraries sometimes add new functions.  If you start using those new functions, then you now depend on that version of the library ( since older versions didn't have it ).  As long as the system has the libraries you need, with at least the minimum versions you require ( and is the same architecture ), the program will run just fine.\nIf you are packaging the program, the debian package system has facilities to detect what functions you call in the libs and figure out the minimum version you require, so that the package can specify that information so when people install it on a debian based system, it can make sure they have the required libs.  When following this proceedure, it is generally possible to build a .deb on Ubuntu that will install and run on say, debian and mint, and any realease that meets your minimum library requirements.\nSee http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-sharedlibs.html\n\nA: When you compile a binary, say, nginx from source code, it's built with information regarding what versions of the libraries are on the system that is compiling the binaries.  The libraries to reference of course are determined by the arguments (for nginx, that's the definition of which modules you want activated or not).  But that binary which you built will (unlikely) run on a separate system, unless its an identically-configured system.\nYou will want to compile the application on each individual system, its (relatively) unlikely you will be able to port the compiled version to another system that might not have a compatible version of each library.\nNote: While you can get a binary to port to another Linux system, its ill-advised and usually is time consuming.  This is because:\n(1) You need to make sure the system you're going to move your binary to is using the same version of libc that was used to compile the binaries\n(2) You need to make sure that the libraries used within the program are able to be detected easily on your system, and that they are the same (or compatible) versions as were used to create the program.\n...and of course other variables to consider.  It's just easier in the long run to compile the program on each system to use it rather than try to strive for portability.\n", "Q: How come Xorg refuses to generate an xorg.conf file for me?

If the data on the drive is important to you, please ensure you have a current backup of that drive.\nThanks to brunopereira81 for mentioning the source of the found.000 folder.\nHope that helps\n\nA: Yes, unless you use your recycle bin as a quick archive for your files (had a friend that did that... \"I press delete and all my files are quickly saved under the same place, find a program that does the same and I will stop using the recycle as my archive!\") ;)\nThe 2 first ones are recycle bin related, AVG probably is your quarantine folder for AVG and found.000 is a trace from a scandisk you ran.\nIf you are not planning to use windows again it is safe to delete those folders.\n", "Q: Missing disk space after upgrade from 11.04 to 11.10. How come? I have a problem with my disk space on Ubuntu.\nI'll say some facts:\n\n\n*\n\n*When I installed Ubuntu, I told Ubuntu to take 25GB of space.\n\n*I installed Ubuntu on my D:\\ Drive, which is NOT the drive on which is my Windows 7\n\n*I have a dual boot ( Ubuntu and windows 7 )\n\n*I saw that I am low in disk space today, never checked before.\n\n*Yesterday, I updated from 11.04 to 11.10\n\n*I heard that Ubuntu takes 700mb ( this is why I don't understand what is happening )\n\n*My D:\\ Drive has about 15GB remaining.\n\n\nMy questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*What took all the 24GBs ?\n\n*How to add space to the home folder ?\n\n*And why does my Disk Usage Analyzer shows that there is 136.7 GB in the file system? :\n\n\nDisk Usage Analyzer screenshot:  \n\nThanks to anyone who answers :)\n\nA: First off, you have asked 3 questions instead of one. Please do create separate questions in the future. Also, it would help you get better answers if you add more information to your questions. Now on to answering your questions,\nWhat took all the 24 GB?\nYou stated in the question yourself that you allocated 25 GB for Ubuntu. So well, there you go.\nHow do I add more space to my home folder?\nThere are already a few questions on the site similar to that, you can take a look at How can I add more disk space to my home directory?\nWhy does Disk Usage Analyzer show there is 136.7 GB in my filesystem?\nThe Disk Usage Analyzer is showing the entire hard-drive. Everything when mounted in Linux falls under a single root in a tree-like structure. Hence it reports to you that the entire filesystem is 136.7GB in size. Moreover, this is the Disk Usage Analyzer, you'd have better info about the size occupied by your partitions and all with a tool like Disk Utility or  gparted  . I've attached a screenshot below to show you what I mean.\n\n", "Q: Desktop unresponsive after login I've just upgraded to oneiric and a few seconds after logging into unity 3D, the whole desktop freezes. I tried unity --reset, unity --advanced-debugging, re-enable from the ccsm. The only thing I could do is restart lightdm from a tty and log in to unity 2D but it is too slow.\nMy machine passes the unity support test. The interesting part is that the beta2 release worked just fine. I would file a bug, but I can't decide whether it's a unity/gtk3/compiz bug.\n-Has anyone met this issue before?\n-Is there any way I could use Unity 3D somehow, bypassing the issue?\n-What should I do to help debug this one?\n\nA: I had the same issue (described in bug #728745) and I successfully solved it after activating the nvidia-173-updates driver in the additional drivers preferences (as suggested in this comment). It is said to disable hibernation and multiple screens.\nNote that a newer driver version is mentioned in the bug thread (version 275.43, see comments #144 and #145) that is said to fix everything, but I was reluctant to try it, because it has to be installed manually (you have to disable Nouvau, exit X and run it from a terminal) and in the future updated manually (through the nvidia-installer program) and who knows how this might play with future Ubuntu updates. Anyway, 173 works fine for me for now, so if it ain't broken, don't fix it :)\n", "Q: Unity runs slow, how can I improve its performance? I like how Unity looks but I have 2 problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unity 3D\nWhen I login with Unity 3D, my pc becomes slower, I got an AMD II X3 with 2GB of RAM, Nvidia Gforce 6150SE nForce 430/PCI/SSE2 integrated.\nWhen I try to open the dash, take a lot of time to open, most often takes up to 5 seconds and while its opening remains fuzzy and unreacted, even the apps or folders take the same time to open and the same reaction.\n\n*Unity 2D\nWhen I login with Unity 2D my pc goes more faster, the only problem is that i cant configure Unity as I want, I try to configure the Unity plugin in CCSM.\nFor eg: I changed \"hide Launcher\" to: Never. It does not save changes, even when I restart my computer.\nI don't know if the problem is with Unity 3D or with my pc.\n\nA: You cannot ust CCSM to configure the Unity-2D since it is not using compiz to show Unity. You have to use dconf-editor or you can use this tool :\nhttp://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/04/ubuntu-unity-2d-tweaking-tool-lets-you-adjust-the-launcher-dash-enable-compositing/\nHope this helps.\nLuis Da Costa\n\nA: In CCSM, go into the options for Ubuntu Unity Plugin and in the tab Experimental, change option Dash Blur from \"Active Blur\" to \"Static Blur\" or \"No Blur\".\nYou can also go into option Composite and disable \"Detect Refresh Rate\" and increase option Refresh Rate to over 60.\nTo increase performance further, you have to have Nvidia's propietary drivers installed (make sure you are using the latest version). Go into NVIDIA X Server Settings and in Open GL Settings Change \"Image Settings\" to \"High Performance\".\nRemember these options will only apply with *Unity 3D*\n\nA: I had the same thing with ati-drivers is a problem because some drivers do not support the procedures \"GLX_EXT_texture_from_bitmap\" it is necessary to work AIGLX. if there is no AIGLX everything goes through XGL, including 3D and therefore slow.\n\nA: Try installing the nvidia-96 drivers. Unity 3d works fine for me after that.\nAlso, Compiz tweaks will help.\n\nA: Try using the CCSM (CompizConfig Settings Manager) to disable other plugins first.\nDoes that help?\n", "Q: Just started using Unity from Ubuntu Classic.

For 11.04, I have those indicators when using Ubuntu Classic so is there some conflict or something?\n\nA: I believe this is the result of the --no-install-recommends option you used. Installing a matapackage usually requires all of its dependencies, including the recommended, otherwise some features will be missing. If you want to use Unity, install it, on the other hand, if you want a minimal setup, use LXDE.\n", "Q: Title Bar Stuck on Theme Just installed Ubuntu 11.10.

I use Ubuntu for programming. I recently updated it from 11.04 to 11.10. There are some things I don't like in the new version of Unity desktop interface. I don't actually know if it is hard to restore previous behavior or not, and if it is not, where should I look to do that. I know a bit of programming, but I really don't know much about Linux settings.\nI used to have 3-6 terminal windows and switch between them with Alt+Tab and Shift+Alt+Tab. I liked half-transparent terminal windows, since with them I could open web-page with some instruction in Firefox, press Alt+Tab and type commands in a console window, being able to recognize text on a web-page under it. Now I have problems with my usual work-style because of the following.\nList of \"negative\" changes\n\n\n*\n\n*Alt+Tab shows just one icon for all console windows. When I wait some time, it, however, shows all windows, but I don't like to wait. I prefer to remember order of windows and press Alt+Tab as many times as I need to switch to the right window.\n\n*Alt+Shift+Tab to switch in reverse order doesn't work now.\n\n*Console windows are not transparent any more.\n\n*When I don't wait, and switch to this icon, it shows all console windows altogether. So even if they were transparent, I wouldn't be able to see anything below them (I can read something only from the window, which is directly under current one, not a few levels under).\n\n*When I run a few console windows in Unity I had 740Mb used on Ubuntu 11.04, but I have 1050Mb now. The question is how to make it back to 750-. I really need my memory, since I use my computer to work with 1512Mb of data and I try to save every 10Mb possible (if it doesn't take too much of machine and, more importantly, my time).\n\n*When I press \"The Super key\" I have a field to type the name of the program I want to run. But now it sometimes shows this field, but when I'm trying to type nothing happens. Probably, focus is not on the right field.\n\n\nI don't really mean to restore exactly the same behavior, but I want to make my work in Ubuntu 11.10 efficient (at least as efficient as in Ubuntu 11.04). I would be happy if there are some ways to accomplish that.\nWhat have I tried\n\n\n*\n\n*I have installed CompizConfig Settings Manager.\n\n*I have read this question. However enabling \"Static Application Switcher\" makes Alt+Tab crazy: after enabling it\n\n\n*\n\n*It says about key-binding conflicts with \"Ubuntu Unity Plugin\";\n\n*\"Alt+Tab\" switching doesn't change, but \"Shift+Alt+Tab\" now works and shows all windows;\n\n*Memory usage increases.\n\n\n*I have tried turning off Ubuntu Unity Plugin, but this doesn't seem right thing to do, since it seems to turn off all menus, a lot of keystrokes and app-launcher, which usually activates with \"The Super key\".\n\n*I have found, that window transparency can be enabled by \"Opacity, Brightness and Saturation\" plugin from Accessibility. However I don't know if enabling it is the right thing to do (at least it increases memory usage).\n\n\nUpdate: everything solved but #3: see my own answer below.\nI have made a separate question about issue #3 (transparency).\n\nA: Everything solved but #3: it was the difference between Unity 2d and Unity 3d\nI've found an answer to my own question: I've read about Unity and have found that there are two versions of it: Unity 2d and Unity 3d. Also I found, that default was Unity 3d, but when on start-up/log-on screen I've pressed wrench and chosen \"Unity 2d\" instead of \"Ubuntu\" from drop-down menu, all problems seem to be gone except for #3. It seems that in this menu \"Ubuntu\" is a nickname for Unity 3d.\nProblem #3 (transparency) was asked in a separate question.\n\nA: http://www.ubuntugeek.com/howto-create-a-transparent-terminal-in-ubuntu-desktop.html\nhere is the link to change transparency of your terminal\nand for regarding alt-tab behavior, you dont need to change it you just need to explore 11.10\nwhen you press alt-tab it will show you all opened programs but in group move to terminal by holding alt and pressing tab again and again when you reach on terminal press ~ Button its above tab(keep alt pressed) and you will see list of all terminals.\nhope it helped, please accept this question by clicking check button on right side and if you think i have not satisfied you then comment below.\nthanks\n", "Q: How can I change font color? The default font color in the Ambiance theme is gray and the contrast makes it hard to read.  How can I keep the theme but make the font dark?  I knew how to do this prior to Ubuntu 11.10 but now I can't find it.  Thank you.\n\nA: To change the system font color of the Ambiance theme from gray to black, you can edit these three files:\n/usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-2.0/gtkrc\n/usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-3.0/settings.ini\n/usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-3.0/gtk.css\n\nIn these files change \ntext_color:#3C3C3C     to   text_color:#000000\nfg_color:#4c4c4c        to   fg_color:#000000\nThis should greatly improve contrast and make applications' menu and dialog text much easier to read. \n", "Q: Unable to choose default application I just upgraded to Ubuntu 11.10 and wanted to set up .z4 files so that they would be opened by gargoyle-free (as an example) although gargoyle-free is not an option in the default application list that arises from the context menu. It used to be possible to manually enter a default application directly from the dialog, however the feature seems to have been replaced by a simplified (and unfortunately useless) \"Find application online\" button. Is there perhaps a new way to do this that doesn't involve messing with the command line?\nSome applications (like clementine audio player) aren't listed in \"Other Applications\".\n\nA: Right click on the file you want to open, select Properties, go to tab Open with.\n\nIf the application you want to use to open a file is not listed on the program list select Other Applications and press the button Add.\n\nA: The button to add a new program to that list was removed in GTK+ 3.0, which is used in Ubuntu 11.10.\nThe good news is that you can add programs to that list manually by adding a .desktop launcher in ~/.local/share/applications.\nThe bad news is that the \"Create Launcher\" dialog was part of GNOME 2.0, so you need to create a .desktop lanucher manually. You could copy one from /usr/share/applications, open it in Gedit (it's just a text file) and modify the Exec and Name lines (and any other lines if you want).\n\nA: Starting in gnome3 only apps whose .desktops have a %letter on the Exec= line will be shown on the right click > Properties menu, they also obviously need an appropriate MimeType= line.\nIn the 2nd example given here, clementine, the current Exec= is \"Exec=clementine\" \nTo show in the r.click > Properties menu  it would need to be this, though other letter possibilities would be f or F\nExec=clementine %U\n\n\nA: The actual recipe for doing this on 11.10 is hidden behind the answers of imgx64 and doug and one extra step.\n\n\n*\n\n*To create custom launchers and edit existing ones with GUI you need to install the Main Menu app by typing the following into the console: sudo apt-get install alacarte\n\n*When creating or editing the existing launchers with this app, make sure that the Command text field contains the %U template variable for the path parameter, e.g. clementine %U as it was noted by doug. \nAfter that you will see your application in the Other Applications list of the Open With dialogues.\n", "Q: Ubuntu USB on a Mac \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I get my Mac to boot from an Ubuntu USB key? \n\nI followed the instructions on Ubuntu.com to install Ubuntu onto a USB for a Mac.\nWhen I insert my USB in Mac OS X it now says \nThe disk you inserted was not readable by this computer.\nIs this normal?\nAlso, when I start my Mac and press Alt the USB doesn't show up.\nDoes anyone know what I could've done wrong? I made the USB with the latest Macbook Air and am running it on a 2 year old Macbook.\n\nA: You can't boot a normal USB key on a Macbook, since the Mac firmware requires you to have an EFI bootloader. Grub 2 has an EFI mode, but I never got it working.\nAdded: See FAQ here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1046568\n\nA: You say you want to run the stick (install Ubuntu) on a two year old MacBook (not the MacBook Air).  Unless your optical drive is broken, I would highly recommend just burning a CD and using the optical drive.  AFAIK, nobody ever has trouble going that route.\nIn fact, the help page to make a USB boot stick for Mac  recommends going the CD route.  \nIf you insist on installing off the USB stick, I'd suggest installing ReFit.  It can usually detect the USB stick.  Whether you can actually boot off it is another matter.

I have 2 different pairs of speakers (one with a sub, one without) that both connect to standard TRS connectors. My laptop only has one female jack, so I purchased an audio splitter like the one below in order to use both. How can I make Ubuntu recognize that there are two different speaker devices plugged in, in order to change the balance on them through the Sound Preferences?\n\n\nA: I don't think this is possible. Most splitters simply forward the same audio to both speakers (or headphones as is my case). Even if your splitter could do more than that, there is no way for the audio device in your computer to send out two separate stereo streams.\nWhat you need is a different audio device, maybe a 4.0 or 5.1 usb sound card.\n", "Q: Something behind the unity title bar I recently upgraded my Google Cr-48 to Ubuntu 11.10 from Ubuntu 11.04. It appears as if there is something behind the title bar. Is this normal?\nI also need to ask how I can take a screenshot to show this. I don't have a Print Screen key.\n\nA: For a screen shot type \"Screenshot\" into the search bar. (Its the one with a camera ;) )\nIt's possible you are seeing some of Gnome panel (but without seeing I cannot say for sure.) This is because gnome panel runs underneath unity panel! So if you set the opacity of unity to 0, you'd be able to see gnome. Weird eh!\n\nA: you can reassign the screenshot shortcut in system settings under keyboard->shortcuts-> screenshot\n\nA: It might be the Nautilus menu bar. When running in Classic mode with Nautilus on the desktop a Nautilus menu bar would be hidden behind the top panel, moving the panel out of the way would reveal it.

Try to restart the network-manager service:\nsudo service network-manager restart\n\nA: You can reload the wireless driver after suspend to avoid a reboot. My driver is 'ath9k' which you can find by running 'nm-tool' and look for the line similar to\nDriver:   ath9k\n\nThen to reload the driver:\nsudo rmmod ath9k\nsudo modprobe ath9k\n\nTo make this happen automatically when you come back from suspend we can add the following script at /etc/pm/sleep.d/00_wireless_sleep\n#!/bin/sh\n\ncase \"$1\" in\n  suspend|hibernate)\n    /sbin/rmmod ath9k\n    ;;\n  resume|thaw)\n    /sbin/rmmod ath9k\n    /sbin/modprobe ath9k\n    ;;\nesac\nexit 0\n\nReplace the \"ath9k\" module name with the module you discovered from the nm-tool output mentioned above.

I often open lots and lots of terminals (right now, I have seven open on this workspace) and I often search history with grep to find a command I've just written recently, but I don't want to hunt down the terminal and then scroll up and hunt for it.\nSometimes my terminals close without exit, and everything I've written in them is lost. Sometimes, I needed something I'd written in a terminal that was killed.\nIs there a way to make it so that each terminal writes to .bash_history immediately? Or at least once a minute, or something like that?\n\nA: Try putting this into your .bashrc: \nshopt -s histappend                      # append to history, don't overwrite it\nexport PROMPT_COMMAND=\"history -a; history -c; history -r; $PROMPT_COMMAND\"\n\nCredit here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/103944/real-time-history-export-amongst-bash-terminal-windows/3055135\nhistory -c clears the history of the running session. This will reduce the history counter by the amount of $HISTSIZE. history -r read the contents of $HISTFILE and insert them in to the current running session history. This will raise the history counter by the amount of lines in $HISTFILE. \nI think it means that the commands are available almost immediately (you have one terminal, write echo 1, second terminal echo 2, first echo 3 and upon pressing down arrow twice, you should have echo 2 available. You must issue a command in a given terminal to have access to what has been written.\n\nA: I have a large history file with about 100000 entries, and the variants that clear the history list and read the whole history file (using history -c and history -r) introduce a noticeable (maybe 0.2 second) delay before the prompt is displayed. Using history -n so that only new lines are read from the history file is faster:\nshopt -s histappend\nPROMPT_COMMAND='history -a;history -n'\n\nPROMPT_COMMAND does not have to be exported because it is a shell variable.\n\nA: A note for all other answers (which are basically the same thing):\nSetting PROMPT_COMMAND=\"history -a;$PROMPT_COMMAND\" in the .bashrc (or friends) is enough.\nAlso, you can manually run history -a whenever you want to \"snapshot\" the history in the current session.\nThe command shopt -s histappend is not needed because history -a always appends new lines to the file and never overwrites it. Also, at least as of Bash 4, histappend is the default behavior.\n\nA: A simple solution is detailed in Update Bash History in Realtime.\nIt says to put those commands in the .bashrc config:\nshopt -s histappend\nPROMPT_COMMAND=\"history -a;$PROMPT_COMMAND\"\n\nThe first command changes the history file mode to append and the second configures the history -a command to be run at each shell prompt. The -a option makes history immediately write the current/new lines to the history file.\nFrom man bash:\n\nIf the histappend shell option is enabled (see the description of shopt under SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below), the lines are appended to the history file, otherwise the history file is overwritten.\n\nRelated for Zsh:\n\n*\n\n*How do you share history between terminals in zsh?\n", "Q: Pidgin doesn't show buddy list? I like to use pidgin instead of Empathy because I'm used to it, and because I have to venture into windows for more development than I would prefer. \nIn Ubuntu 11.10, I can't find any way to get to the buddy list. It opens, and just sits there in the messenger panel tray thing. From its previous behavior, I believe Pidgin usually starts up minimized-- you have to click on its system tray to show the buddy list. The messenger applet does not seem to support this functionality. Is this a bug, or am I just missing something obvious?\n\nA: This issue still occurs on 12.04. Sometimes, the only way to get it to work is to killall pidgin and use the launcher from the dash. However, I came up with a solution that works every time.\nUse the following command:\ngksu gedit /usr/share/applications/pidgin.desktop (or use your favorite editor instead of gedit)\nAdd this to the bottom of the file and save:\nX-Ayatana-Desktop-Shortcuts=List\n[List Shortcut Group]\nName=Display Buddy List\nExec=pidgin %U\nTargetEnvironment=Unity\n\nWhat this does is an an option to the pidgin launcher called \"Display Buddy List\" that always will show the list whenever selected. But, if the list is showing already, it will not open a second one. \nSo, long story short, if opening Pidgin from the messaging menu gives you that trouble, use the solution listed here. Even if it doesn't work by clicking the messaging menu option or using the launcher from the Dash, this will always work.\nNote: To those wondering why I didn't advice to copy the Pidgin launcher to .local/share/applications, it is because the launcher in the messaging menu launches /usr/share/applications/pidgin.desktop. So, rather than editing the messaging menu, I advised to edit the original launcher.\n\nA: Just wanted to mention I tried all of the above and nothing seemed to work. Then when I went in to Tools -> Preferences and unchecked the Status \"Use status from last exit at startup\" and changed the \"Status to apply at startup:\" to \"Available\", things seem to work fine.  I am unsure why this seemed to fix it, but so far I have restarted a couple times and it seems to be working now.\n\nA: Check the value of the list_visible parameter in .purple/prefs.xml, if it is 0, close pidgin, edit and change it to 1, then restart pidgin.\n<pref name='list_visible' type='bool' value='1'/>\n\nYou can also try the same with 'blist_autohide'\n<pref name='blist_autohide' type='bool' value='1'/>\n\n\nA: Faced the same problem. Completely reinstalling (purge and reinstall) pidgin and it's dependencies solved it for me. Try the following in a terminal.\nPurge pidgin and its dependencies:\n$ sudo apt-get purge pidgin pidgin-libnotify pidgin-data indicator-status-provider-pidgin\n\nClear stale archives:\n$ sudo apt-get clean\n\nReboot.\nReinstall pidgin alongwith dependencies:\n$ sudo apt-get install pidgin\n\nThis solved the issue for me. Pidgin now shows buddy list from indicator menu and when I launch Pidgin manually.\n\nA: Removing my ~/.purple folder solved this issue for me, I had copied my home folder from 11.04 over to 11.10.\nWarning: deleting ~/.purple means you'll have to setup your accounts and preferences all over again.\nNote: After doing this I now also sometimes need to load Pidgin with the -f flag for the buddy list to show.\n\nA: Had the same issue.  One thing that worked for me was going to the Unity \"envelope\" menu (where mail and IM notifications are shown) and hit \"Clear\".  Then going back to the same menu, I selected \"Pidgin Internet Messenger\" and suddenly the buddy list appeared.\n\nA: I also had this bug. One thing resolve the issue for me: setting \"Show system tray icon\" to \"Always\" in pidgins preferences. I don't know why or how, but now everything is OK.\n\nA: No need to remove the .purple directory\nThis worked for me:\nsudo aptitude install --reinstall pidgin\n\nThis will keep your settings in pidgin\n\nA: I've got the same bug on my pc, can temporary fix it with disable and re-enable account in accounts menu entry.\nadded\njust start pidgin with -f key, seems like bug causing by network-manager. in gnome 3!\n\nA: None of the solutions worked for me, seems there are more people like me judging from this bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pidgin/+bug/879960 (in case somebody comes across this)\n", "Q: Mounting NTFS directory from within VMWare image I'm running UBuntu 11.10 as a guest in VMWare Player on a WIndows 7 laptop and would like to mount an NTFS directory in UBuntu but not sure how to go about it.

It is nice but very annoying if am suppose to install via GUI 20, 30 apps.\nAs a side note I actually like the new changes and look and feel of the Software Center now, but the intuitive and more friendly nature of Synaptic with details like this is what is needed. \n\nA: Unfortunately, it is currently not possible to select multiple apps and then install them at a time in software-center. There is a bug report filed to have this feature in the software-center but there is no visible progress towards this.\n\nAs an alternative, if you are using 12.04 or would be using 12.04 when it is released, I suggest you try lubuntu-software-center  , which supports installing multiple apps at a time.\nTo install it, run the following command in a terminal:\nsudo apt-get install lubuntu-software-center\n\nAs you browse the software, you can click on Add to the Apps Basket if you want to install it later. After you have selected the applications that you want to install, go to Apps Basket and click on Install Packages. This way, you can install multiple apps at a time.\n\n\n\nA: software-center will queue the installs of the packages, so you don't have\nto wait for one operation to finish before installing the next.\nI don't know of a way to install a lot with one click, but the above feature\nmeans that double-clicking the ones you want will have them all install.\n", "Q: How do I enable the pidgin system tray icon? I want to enable the System tray icon for Pidgin in Ubuntu 11.10 (with Unity), but I don't see it. \nI have to start it again and again from the launcher panel or from the dash. \nIs there a workaround to show the system tray icon in Unity? I think it's the same behavior for Skype and some other applications also.\n\nA: In 11.10 Unity has hidden the system tray access to pidgin under the messaging icon that looks like an envelope. If you click it, there should be an entry for Pidgin. Not exactly what you're looking for, but at least it's accessible somehow via the system tray.\n\nA: For 12.10 and older:\nexecute:  \ngsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Panel systray-whitelist \"['all']\"\n\n(from http://www.webupd8.org/2011/10/things-to-tweak-after-installing-ubuntu.html)\nand remember to set the system tray to \"always\" in pidgin preferences.\n\nIf the change doesn't take effect immediately, run unity --replace\n\nA: manually:\n\n\n*\n\n*run dconf-editor\n\n*open desktop -> unity -> panel\n\n*set systray-whitelist to \"['all']\"\n\nA: For 13.04:\nThe migration of Pidgin to the new libmessaging-menu API, which caused this issue, is now done for Pidgin, but still under testing. Also, only a Ubuntu 13.04 package is provided so far, but since it does not introduce any dependencies on other stuff from 13.04, I was able to just install it from the PPA of the programmer who fixed it. According to his instructions, this is what fixed it for me:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:jconti/gnome3\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install pidgin-libnotify\n\nYou should now have pidgin-libnotify version 0.14-9ubuntu1. In addition, you have to add the following line to /usr/share/applications/pidgin.desktop:\n X-MessagingMenu-UsesChatSection=true\n\nThen restart Pidgin, it should now get an entry in the message indicator menu of the panel again, so that when closing its window, it stays running.\nUpdate\nIt is NOT necessary (any more) to install this repository as of May 23. Probably the updates have been officially included by now.\nJust make sure the libnotify plugin is active! With Ubuntu 12.10 (and previous) and the whitelist for system tray icons you/the user may have deactivated the libnotify plugin on purpose.\n\nA: As you can read on launchpad they changed the messages indicator and the pidgin indicator is not adapted to these changes.

Any ideas?\n\nA: You might have several misconfigurations since you mentioned that the upgrading procedure failed. What I suggest is to do a clean install to be on the safe side. Do a backup of your files and just do a clean Ubuntu install. It will save you all the hassle for looking for the culprit and enjoy the 11.10 as new.\n", "Q: Help! Crash during upgrade amd64 11.04 -> 11.10 Now El Deado-Meato I started what I thought was a standard upgrade, using the normal gui stuff.  Part way through, it apparently put up a dialog asking if I wanted to keep the old apparmor config file or not.  I was not at the console.  The the screensave apparently kicked in.  Then it appeard totally dead.\nI tried several things, but it appears that the combination broke the upgrade.\nOn a second machine I was also doing the upgrade.  On it, I just killed gnome-screensaver AND NOTHING ELSE.  The got in with vnc (actual screen/kb unresponsive) and it appears to be going.  Maybe to completion.\nOn the first machine, I think I had queued up an Alt-F1 before getting screensaver killed, and I could not get the gui back.  So I eventually rebooted.\nHow can I resume the upgrade, repair the installation do something so I don't have to reformat all the partitions and start over?\nThat would be suboptimal.\n\nA: I've learned some more.\nI started two upgrades, both amd64 11.04 to 11.10, using standard gui prompt.\nOne machine is a Dell OptiPlex 745, 2 core Pentium D, the other a Shuttle x27d, an Atom D510.\nThe installs both \"crashed\" at similar points:  Some user feedback was required (the OptiPlex needed an answer to whether it should replace or leave alone some NetworkManager config file; the Atom needed an answer to similar question about apparmor config file) and the screen timed out.  The screen saver came on (it's just to black, turning off the display) and then the machine appeared to be frozen.  Wiggling mouse, hitting various keys and so on had no effect.  Getting in with vnc and poking gui buttons and so on had no effect.  Logging in with ssh, ps showed\n  gnome-screensaver --nodaemon\neating up vast time.\nI googled a bit and tried various Alt-F1 kinds of things on the OptiPlex to no effect.  Googled some more and learned that I should probably have killed the gnome-screensaver before doing anything else.\nI had not yet done anything to the Atom.  I logged into it with ssh, killed the gnome-screensaver.  The screen was still dead on the actual machine, but when I went in with vnc I was able to poke the button that it appeared to have been waiting for; the installation proceeded and now it seems to be alive with everything as expected in the upgrade.\nUnfortunately, when I got around to trying to fix the OptiPlex and killed gnome-screensaver, whatever keystokes I had given it had queued up and caused all hell to break loose.  I eventually got to the point where I saw no choice but to reboot.\nIt would not come up.  It hung early, with no clue about where.\nMore googling led to a successful reboot on the previous (11.04) version of things.  I then did the google-suggested\n  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\nand that led to some dpkg thing that ended up doing the complete upgrade successfully using command line.\nSo it's all better now.\nBut.\nNow I face the irritation and annoyance that the Powers That Be think my computers ought to look like iPhones rather than computers.\nGrrr.\nThanks to anyone who thought about trying to help.\n\nA: FWIW I had my laptop die at about 95% of the upgrade process (my fault - tried to squeeze it into remaining battery time).\nGot grub to give me a text login and fumbled around with dpkg and apt-get upgrade and finally got the process to complete.  11.10 now works but having to relocate 3rd party drivers for a few of my devices.\nHope that gives you a start point / some ideas.

A terminal would no longer come up\n\n\nHere's what I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*Pressed Ctrl-Alt-F2 which switches to a TTY text console (Press Ctrl-Alt-F7 to switch back to your X deskopt showing your Ubuntu graphical desktop)\n\n*Logged in with user / password\n\n*typed: sudo su -\n\n*and entered user password to become root in this shell\n\n*dpkg --configure -a\n\n*to have all packages continuing their setup work\n\n*At this point networking was still not working, but I was getting my hopes up because at least I saw the linux kernel 3.0 being configured, an initrd written, and grub reconfigured\n\n*So I rebooted by typing init 6\n\n*I could now login to an Ubuntu 11.10 Unity desktop (yuck used gnome before) with my usual username/password and everything seemed to work\n\n*Nevertheless I opened again a terminal, sudo su - again and ensured that I had all Ubuntu 11.10 packages by running\n\n*apt-get update\n\n*apt-get upgrade\n\n*Actually no additional packages were retrieved. Then I did a \n\n*dpkg --configure -a\n\n*which caught a yet unconfigured adobe flash plugin. The plugin upgraded itself, which it could not do before because before the reboot the network was broken.\n\n*Everything looked good from here - I'm typing this answer right now at this point in time.\n\n\nSo, other things may crop up in the future that have been broken in this process. But overall I was pleasantly surprised that I did not have to reinstall from scratch.\nSo, fear not, help is not far away - usually.\nI am very disappointed though because for me the quality of the distribution has deteriorated.

As I remember correctly, tthis wasn't in 11.04. How can I disable that?\n\nA: Having nautilus managing the desktop is default in Ubuntu 11.10. But if you want to disable this feature, you can install gnome-tweak-toolthrough Ubuntu Software Center or just paste in a terminal:\nsudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool\n\nAfter it installs find it in your dash.\nThe option is in Desktop and then turn Have file manager handle desktop off.\n\nA: In a terminal window launch Nautilus with the --no-desktop option, (possible, you need to stop Nautilus first with nautilus --quit, see nautilus --help, generally): \n $ nautilus --no-desktop  \n\n(that is, nautilus followed by space, followed by two 'dash' characters and the option name no-desktop. The -- characters when shown in this window display as a continuum.)\nNautilus will launch in a desktop window, and will not take over your desktop.  \nAny subsequent call to launch Nautilus will also not take over your desktop, provided you leave the first call to Nautilus running.\n\nA: To configure this, you'll first need to head over to Software Centre and install Gnome Tweak Tool. After you have installed it, you can find the app as Advanced Settings in the dash.\nGnome Tweak Tool lets you change various settings that affect look and feel. The one you want is “Have file manager handle the desktop” in the Desktop section. See the screenshot below.\nNote that this setting is stored with gsettings, so you can also access it using a tool called dconf-editor or with this command:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background show-desktop-icons false\n\n\n\nIn later versions of Ubuntu (15.04 and possibly earlier?) this setting is renamed to 'Icons on Desktop':\n\n\nA: gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background show-desktop-icons false\n\nIn dconf-manager:\n\n", "Q: libreoffice application does not use unity launcher Please fine below the image.\n\nIn this, you may observe that though libre writer is up, unity launcher does not have blue arrow.

How does that handle when patched branch gets out-of-date with the distro package in newer release?

But I cant find a standard widget that does this automatically. \nAre these colors all set by hand (instead of standard widget+theme)? And if they are set by hand, where do they come from in the theme (what are the parameters in  gtk_widget_modify_bg(widget, GTK_STATE_NORMAL, &color)) ?\nEDIT: It does not seem to be a simple Gtk.Toolbar. If I run the following code:\nfrom gi.repository import Gtk\nwindow = Gtk.Window()\nwindow.set_default_size(200, -1)\nwindow.connect(\"destroy\", lambda q: Gtk.main_quit())\ntoolbar = Gtk.Toolbar()\nwindow.add(toolbar)\ntoolbutton = Gtk.ToolButton(stock_id=Gtk.STOCK_NEW)\ntoolbar.add(toolbutton)\nwindow.show_all()\nGtk.main()\n\nI get a window like this:\n\nwhich does not have a dark tone for the toolbar.\nEDIT2: Although the 'toolbar with special context' answer by j-johan-edwards is true in  most of the programs, it is not the case in the ubuntuone-control-panel. This program has a GtkVBox which can include any range of widgets (unlike a toolbar). I'm still unable to determine how the gtk-theme knows how to paint that part of the window.\n\nBut anyway: for now a toolbar is enough for me...\n\nA: With regards to the second part of your question, which was \"How to add VBox to the toolbar\", all you have to do is wrap it inside a Gtk.ToolItem, eg:.\n...\nself.toolbar = Gtk.Toolbar()\nself.box = Gtk.Box(orientation=Gtk.Orientation.VERTICAL)\ntool_item = Gtk.ToolItem()\ntool_item.add(self.box)\nself.toolbar.insert(tool_item, 0)\n...\n\nYou can make it simpler by creating a helper function or extending Gtk.Toolbar, for example:\ncustom_toolbar.py\nfrom gi.repository import Gtk\n\nclass CustomToolbar(Gtk.Toolbar):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super(CustomToolbar, self).__init__()\n        ''' Set toolbar style '''\n        context = self.get_style_context()\n        context.add_class(Gtk.STYLE_CLASS_PRIMARY_TOOLBAR)\n\n    def insert(self, item, pos):\n        ''' If widget is not an instance of Gtk.ToolItem then wrap it inside one '''\n        if not isinstance(item, Gtk.ToolItem):\n            widget = Gtk.ToolItem()\n            widget.add(item)\n            item = widget\n\n        super(CustomToolbar, self).insert(item, pos)\n        return item\n\nIt simply checks if the object you try to insert is a ToolItem, and if not, it wraps it inside one. Usage example:\nmain.py\n#!/usr/bin/python\nfrom gi.repository import Gtk\nfrom custom_toolbar import CustomToolbar\n\nclass MySongPlayerWindow(Gtk.Window):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super(MySongPlayerWindow, self).__init__(title=\"My Song Player\")\n        self.set_size_request(640, 480)\n\n        layout = Gtk.Box(orientation=Gtk.Orientation.VERTICAL, spacing=6)\n        self.add(layout)\n\n        status_bar = Gtk.Statusbar()\n        layout.pack_end(status_bar, False, True, 0)\n\n        big_button = Gtk.Button(label=\"Play music\")\n        layout.pack_end(big_button, True, True, 0)\n\n        ''' Create a custom toolbar '''\n        toolbar = CustomToolbar()\n        toolbar.set_style(Gtk.ToolbarStyle.BOTH)        \n        layout.pack_start(toolbar, False, True, 0)\n\n        ''' Add some standard toolbar buttons '''\n        play_button = Gtk.ToggleToolButton(stock_id=Gtk.STOCK_MEDIA_PLAY)\n        toolbar.insert(play_button, -1)\n\n        stop_button = Gtk.ToolButton(stock_id=Gtk.STOCK_MEDIA_STOP)\n        toolbar.insert(stop_button, -1)\n\n        ''' Create a vertical box '''\n        playback_info = Gtk.Box(orientation=Gtk.Orientation.VERTICAL, margin_top=5, margin_bottom=5, margin_left=10, margin_right=10)\n\n        ''' Add some children... '''\n        label_current_song = Gtk.Label(label=\"Artist - Song Name\", margin_bottom=5)\n        playback_info.pack_start(label_current_song, True, True, 0)\n\n        playback_progress = Gtk.ProgressBar(fraction=0.6)\n        playback_info.pack_start(playback_progress, True, True, 0)\n\n        '''\n        Add the vertical box to the toolbar. Please note, that unlike Gtk.Toolbar.insert,\n        CustomToolbar.insert returns a ToolItem instance that we can manipulate\n        '''\n        playback_info_item = toolbar.insert(playback_info, -1)\n        playback_info_item.set_expand(True)        \n\n        ''' Add another custom item '''       \n        search_entry = Gtk.Entry(text='Search')\n        search_item = toolbar.insert(search_entry, -1)\n        search_item.set_vexpand(False)\n        search_item.set_valign(Gtk.Align.CENTER)\n\nwin = MySongPlayerWindow()\nwin.connect(\"delete-event\", Gtk.main_quit)\nwin.show_all()\nGtk.main()\n\nIt should look like this\n\nA: Do you mean these?\n\nThey're just Gtk.Toolbars. The reason some applications like Banshee don't use them is that they haven't yet ported to GTK+ 3, and received the new theming capabilities that enable toolbars like that.\nTo port your own Python application to GTK+ 3, you need to use PyGObject instead of PyGTK. As of 12.04, Quickly will generate PyGObject projects by default.\nYou also need to add primary-toolbar to the toolbar style context. Like so:\ntoolbar = Gtk.Toolbar()\ncontext = toolbar.get_style_context()\ncontext.add_class(Gtk.STYLE_CLASS_PRIMARY_TOOLBAR)\n\napplying that context to the question example results in this:\n\n", "Q: change background of certain websites black?

I am using Ubuntu 11.10 in Sony VAIO.\nThe workspace manager worked in the beginning. But now, when clicking on the workspace button, the 2x2 grid is displayed. Only the upper left workspace is highlighted and the other workspaces are black and faded. \nOnly the upper left is selectable, which means I effectively have only one usable workspace. I tried CCSM but changing the grid size there had no effect at all. \n\nA: The way I understand the workspace spread, if you have an active window in a particular workspace, it is coloured in the workspace spread. Or, in case there are no active window, as you seem to have noted, they are dark and faded. \n\nIf you select a workspace, the workspace will have an orange outline to indicate that you have selected the workspace. You can refer to the image for clarification. You can select the unused workspace in the workspace spread without any problem. \nIf this answer is unsatisfactory, you can try resetting Unity to its defaults and see if that helps your problem.\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I reset my Unity configuration?\n\nA: Same problem here. It used to work for a few days, but now I'm stuck with just one workspace. The others are black (even the background isn't shown) and they are unselectable. It might have something to do with the installation of Gnome Shell? I installed that because I wasn't very happy with the new Unity, but eventually I turned back to Unity, finding out three of my workspaces were gone.\nA solution is given here: Workspaces don't work on my system but unfortunately it doesn't work for me. It might help you though.\nEdit: I see you already tried CCSM, sorry for re-suggesting it.\n\nA: This is my first fix but I had the same problem as you and just got it to work. \nLog out of unity and click the sprocket where you sign in to log back in under gnome classic. Right click the lower panel to add workspaces if not already there. Right click the single workspace icon and click on preferences. The rest is pretty simple.

But there's a simpler way than doing it by hand; in many cases, you may not even need to edit the .desktop file.\nSolution: Use Ubuntu Tweak\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu Tweak is a utility, which among other things, allows you to associate file types to be opened with a custom command. Behind the scenes, it creates a .desktop file which you can edit further for your needs, e.g. if you are using a command-line editor or program to open, etc.\n\n\nIn this how-to, we look at how to set up Nautilus to open .php files in the free Komodo Edit GUI text editor, which comes with a shell-installer that installs it in your home directory by default; the program/command is then /home/user/Komodo-Edit-7/bin/komodo\n1. Install Ubuntu Tweak\n\n\n*\n\n*Add its PPA, update and install Ubuntu Tweak from the terminal with:\n\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:tualatrix/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-tweak\n\nUpdate: Check this question for updated instructions for newer Ubuntu releases\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I install Ubuntu-Tweak?\n2.

The advantage of this method is that a.) it doesn't depend on third-party applications b.) you don't have to modify existing system files.\nHere's how to add an association or edit an existing one:\n1. Finding the right .desktop file\nMake sure the program you want to use  has a .desktop launcher associated with it. Look through ~/.local/share/applications and /usr/share/applications to find the correlating .desktop file for your program, e.g. mplayer.desktop. If there is no .desktop file for your application, you can easily create one following the instructions provided in this answer.\n2. Identifying the mimetype\nUsing nautilus right click on a sample file, head to properties and copy the mimetype listed under Type, e.g. audio/mpeg.\n3. Editing mimeapps.list\nOpen mimeapps.list in gedit\ngedit ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list\n\nSearch for the mimetype you copied above. If it exists, append your .desktop file to the list of associated programs, e.g.:\naudio/mpeg=umplayer.desktop;vlc.desktop;\n\nto\naudio/mpeg=umplayer.desktop;vlc.desktop;mplayer.desktop;\n\nIf your mimetype wasn't included in the first place, add it as a new line and, again, append your .desktop file:\naudio/mpeg=mplayer.desktop;\n\nAt the top of this add a heading with [Added Associations] if it isn't there already. So, for an empty file which is just created, it will looks like\n[Added Associations]\naudio/mpeg=mplayer.desktop;\n\nThat's it, your application should now appear in the \"Open with\" dialog.\n\nA: The trick is to add \" %U\" in Exec command of the .desktop file. Then the program will appear in available programs list to open a file with. You can create/edit desktop files easily with alacarte. Type \"alacarte\" in terminal to run it, or if it is not installed you will get notified about this and asked to install it first.\n", "Q: Can't enable Unity 2D I've just installed Ubuntu 11.10 and have done a full update.

You can use this to safely upload your settings in Windows and then download by signing in to the same Opera Account in Ubuntu.\nIn addition to your Bookmarks, Passwords, and Speed Dial, it will also synchronize you Notes, Typed browser history, Search engines, and Content blocker rules. You can individually disable synchronization of any of these individually during the setup process.\nLearn How To Use Opera Link\n", "Q: Why does Déjà Dup say there is no space left? I'm trying to backup my home directory (excluding a few folders). The backup is saved on a ~300 GB partition (called backups) of an internal drive, but not the same drive as the home directory. When I try to backup, everything goes OK until at some point Déjà Dup says there is no space left on \"backups\". The problem is that Déjà Dup only used ~20 GB at this point, so there is a ton of space left. I tried several times without luck.\nWhy is Déjà Dup saying this?\nThe size of my home directory, without the excluded folders, is 136 GB.\n\nA: You can move the location of the cache-directory as follows (create a symlink to a new cache location)\nmkdir /othervolume/.deja-dup-cache\nmv ~/.cache/deja-dup/* /othervolume/.deja-dup-cache/\nrmdir ~/.cache/deja-dup\nln -sf /othervolume/.deja-dup-cache ~/.cache/deja-dup\n\nto change the location of the tmp-directory have a look at the following post: Deja Dup backup, change use of /tmp to another folder/location\n\nA: So there are three possible places where Deja Dup might be out of space, and I don't think its error message tells you which.  There is a bug filed about that.\n\n\n*\n\n*You may have run out of space on the target partition (which it sounds like you didn't)\n\n*You may have run out of space in your home directory (~/.cache/deja-dup can get large)\n\n*You may have run out of space in /tmp\n\n\nA: I had the same problem\nI had >900Gb left on the partition,\n13Gb left on the cache folder in ~\nand /tmp contained only 13 Kb\nI solved the problem just by rebooting \n\nA: I am operating my root system on an SSD drive, and once read an article about swapping certain folders like /tmp, /var/log, and so on to RAM, which lowers your potential RAM space and the size of the /tmp folder. Exactly this swapping of my /tmp folder caused the no space left error in Deja Dup.\nHere is what I did to my fstab back then (sorry, it's in German).\n...and parts of the code to put in fstab:\ntmpfs   /tmp    tmpfs   nosuid  0   0\n\nSo if you made the same changes to your fstab in order to improve performance, simply undo it like this:\n# tmpfs /tmp    tmpfs   nosuid  0   0\n\n\nA: You might try formatting your backup partition as NTFS.\nI had exactly the same error when these two conditions came together:\n\n\n*\n\n*the backup partition is formatted as FAT.\n\n*the backup included huge files such as virtual hard disc images for VirtualBox.\n\n\nFormatting the backup partition as NTFS resolved the problem in my case.\n", "Q: graphic bug in unity, messy background for dash and launcher Since the oneiric update, after some usage the dash and the launcher backgrounds (when open) become messy. Here you can see a screenshot:\n\nSometimes, I also noticed (don't know if it's a bug) that the dash shows the desktop behind, even if I have an application open. And also I noticed that when you change desktop background, the dash always shows the same background. This become evident when I use the wallpaper that change through the day.\nMany thanks in advance!!\nEDIT:\nI will report the bug for sure.\nHere you can see the \"see-through\" behaviour I was talking about. Is this a bug?\n\n\nA: I cannot give an explanation for the degrading of the dash and Launcher image but as for the Dash being a little bit see-through I say that it is supposed to be like that. See, this link to Mark Shuttleworth's blog for August this year.\nNotice the heading Visual Refinements. Note this quote:\n\nRather than a flat darkening, we’re introducing a wash based on the desktop colour. The dash thus adjusts to your preferred palette based on your wallpaper.\n\nIf you are experiencing something different to this, then the problem might be to do with the graphic card driver or even the graphic card itself.\nRegards.\n", "Q: Can either Gnome 3 or Unity be customized to simulate a Gnome 2 style interface? I am looking for a somewhat comprehensive guide for customizing either Gnome 3 or Unity to look as much as possible like Gnome 2.\nI have seen this question come up, but the most common answer is that people should simply log in with Gnome \"classic\". The reason this is not a sufficient answer is because, in my experience, within the \"classic\" interface, not everything that makes up the interface is compatible with each other. For example, some applets not working, and themes not displaying entirely correctly.\nThe ideal scenario is to have the advantages of the more efficient and updated code that Gnome 3 and Unity are built on, but to customize it so that a user can create the interface they are most comfortable with. In my case, that is a Gnome-2 like interface.\nI hope to not have any political discussion about whether or not Unity and/or Gnome 3 changed for better or worse.\nI just want to be able to do what I think makes Linux great: customize.\nSo, what would be the steps to recreate Gnome 2?\n\nA: It is not really possible to change anything on unity.  The way it is set up is the default way whether you like it or not.\nGnome shell on the other hand is some what customizable, you can install things called extensions which can add some functionality that does not come with the shell.\nTo be honest it depends what aspect of Gnome 2 you want in gnome 3.\nFor example, if you want a normal menu in Gnome shell instead of the \"activities\" their are a few shell extensions that give you the normal menu back.  Here is just an example but my favorite one\nCardapio Menu Extension\nOr if you want all the icons in the top panel like on Gnome 2:\nGnome 2 Notifcations\nOr if you want a sound menu like the one on unity/all the other Ubuntu variations:\nGnome shell media player extension\nSo, as you can see if their is something in particular just search around for some extensions, Github is a great place to look.\nEdit: Forgot to mention, I am using docky as I don't like going to the activities to see my open windows.  Almost all docks I have tried work on gnome shell, e.g. \"docky, awn, cairo dock, plank\", there are loads out their.\n", "Q: GNOME Shell interface questions Ok, after my upgrade to 11.10 and toying around with the new Unity, I am now trying out GNOME Shell. I really like the dash in GNOME Shell (when you press super).

(I tried the scroll-wheel click, but it opens a second instance of the application in another workspace)\n\n*is there a list of shortcuts somewhere (as there is for unity)? \n\n\nI did have a look at the documentation at http://gnome.org, but that was a bit meager.\n\nA: To add favourites, right click on the application and select 'Add to favourites'. Alternatively, you can drag them to the launcher. \n\nTo create an extra instance of the application, right click on the application in the launcher and select 'New Window'.\n\nFor a list of shortcuts, search for 'System settings' and select 'Keyboard'. Click on 'shortcuts' tab and you can see all the shortcuts that are available for use in Gnome-shell.\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to disable empathy from autostarting on login?

I've read many tutorials through last days, but as I'm a complete beginner in Ubuntu system, I can't get to work it out.\nIn my system preferences the graphics card is unknown.

And thanks for your struggle to help me with this small problem.\n\nA: Chances are that your drivers are actually working perfectly well.  The Graphics listing in System Info is wrong by default in Ubuntu 11.10.  It is based on the output of the glxinfo command, which we don't install by default.\nIt's highly likely that installing the mesa-demos package will correct the output of System Info.  This won't change your graphics performance or driver - it's highly likely that you're already using the correct drivers - it will just fix the reporting of your driver.\n\nA: Please specify the error you are getting while .deb package.\nFirst tell what error is coming while running the package.\nThen try to run it with gdebi(If you don't have gdebi installed, then install it via Ubuntu Software Center).\nIf gdebi is also not successful, then post the error of gdebi too.\nIf all fails, then open the terminal.\nGo to the folder in which the .deb package is placed by suitable commands.\nThen inside that directory, type \nsudo dpkg -i [pkg name.deb]\n\nAnd tell us if it helps you.\n", "Q: Cannot update and install any software after installing ClamAV?

I don't know if all of them put together worked plus this one I'm going to write in here, or if it's just this one. But basically, this is the one that did it. The interesting thing is, the whole time I've had this Ubuntu 11.04 thing going, everything except my browsers were fast on the internet. Games worked fine, virtual box pcs running windows 7 were lightening quick on the internet (bridged wireless adapter).\nI went into edit connections (drop down from your wifi symbol): selected the wifi connection I'm currently using: click the IPv4 settings tab: method select automatic (dhcp) address only: then in the field that says dns servers: enter the fastest dns server. \nHow do you know the fastest? I used http://www.grc.com/dns/benchmark.htm with a windows machine. Their software benchmarks the fastest dns servers -just sort the results. I have a hunch that yours will be your router or modem on your internal LAN.\nMy two fastest dns servers were my wireless router's ip address & my modem's ip address. So you could start by plugging one in then try the other, then try the browser.\nSo far, the internet has been lightening quick. Hopefully this will last.\n\nA: I found the problem with my slow internet connection thanks to Jorge Castro I change my wireless connection to Wired connection and it started working. I am using IBM thinkpad x60 Lenovo. And the card seems to have this known problem only with Linux drivers. \n", "Q: How to restore the top panel? I've upgraded my desktop from Natty To Oneiric.\nNow the top panel has wrong theme and some indicators are missing (sound, power, etc.). Also, icons in launchers and on the desktop are missing or corrupted:\n\nLogging with other users in same PC is no issue; in that case the top bar is correct.\nI've also filed a bug in Launchpad.\nIs there a way to restore the bar?\n\nA: If unity is a bit broken you could try resetting it - see this question for more details, but the short version is to open a terminal and type:\nunity --reset\n\nAlso it might be worth uninstalling the nautilus-open-terminal package if you had it installed - this caused compiz crashes (launchpad bug) which might lead to your problems. The fix is currently in the oneiric-proposed repository, and should be generally available soon, but not quite yet.\n\nA: Three separate issues ..\n(1.) Unity Launcher\nThis button-bar (right-hand of screen) replaces the menu system available as 'Classic' in Ubuntu 11.04 (Natty).  You can try an go back, but I'm not sure I recommend it.\nsee:\nhttp://www.webupd8.org/2011/08/installing-using-classic-gnome-desktop.html\n(2.)  missing icons (on button bar)\nThe default theme is flawed, after upgrade to 11.10 (from 11.04).\nClick on top right corner icon; 'Systems Settings' > Appearance > choose 'Radiance'\n(3.)  missing icons (on desktop)\nThis is going to require more effort.\nBy 'default' Ubuntu 11.10 and Unity (3D) does NOT use the desktop (and icons), but instead used the launcher.  This is a work in progress ..\n\nA: I found the workaround here:\nsudo rm /usr/share/GConf/gsettings/pythonconsole.convert\ngsettings-data-convert\ngnome-settings-daemon\n\nThen, to solve definitely at every login, I had to create a launcher to gnome-settings-daemon in my home folder and add it to my startup applications.\n", "Q: Which INPUT rules do I need to add to iptables so apt (apt-get, aptitude) can work (update, upgrade, search, install)? I need to use aptitude to update and install software but it fails. It says...\n0% [Connecting to archive.ubuntu.com]\n\n...and halts. I need to type CTRL-C to move out. I'm using Ubuntu Server 10.04 LTS (Lucid Lynx).\nThis is happening due to my iptables rules. If I restore iptables to its defaults (by removing rules and setting policies to ACCEPT), then aptitude works as expected. No errors anymore.\nBut, hey, I want to  use my iptables rules... I just need to know: what exactly I need to keep open to make apt work?\nMy rules are quite simple. OUTPUT policy is ACCEPT. FORWARD policy is ACCEPT. And I have no rules for OUTPUT and FORWARD. INPUT policy is DROP. So, the problem is in the INPUT chain! I have 11 INPUT rules to open specific TCP ports that I need to run services like FTP, SSH, HTTP, etc. An additional rule to accept ICMP (ping), and other to accept all localhost input. And this is all:\niptables -F\niptables -A INPUT -s 127.0.0.1 -j ACCEPT\niptables -A INPUT -p icmp -j ACCEPT\niptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 21 -j ACCEPT\niptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT\niptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 25 -j ACCEPT\niptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT\niptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT\niptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 587 -j ACCEPT\niptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 995 -j ACCEPT\niptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 1008 -j ACCEPT\niptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 2812 -j ACCEPT\niptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 3306 -j ACCEPT\niptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8000 -j ACCEPT\niptables -P INPUT DROP\n\nI tried lots of rules trying to make aptitude work. Of course a simple iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT  makes it work, but I don't want to accept everything. I want to open only what is needed for aptitude to do its job.\nIt sounds strange to me that the INPUT chain is the issue... but it is.\nAnother issue is that I have no access to iptables logs... I have just found there is a bug in the kernel I am using (see https://serverfault.com/questions/159818/iptables-logging-not-working)... so, don't ask me for the log contents, because I am unable to have them.\nThank you!\n\nA: When you send a HTTP request to the other server, you're using TCP. First, a SYN packet go outside to the other server from a random high port, then you'll receive a ACK response. Finally you send SYN/ACK to the server and the server responds with the requested document (in multiple packets). Your rules do not allow the ACK packet to be received and therefore the connection cannot be established. Add a rule like:\n-A INPUT -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT\n\nYou don't get iptables logs for free. Your rules should look like:\n# if no rule matched, the input should be dropped\n-P INPUT DROP\n\n-A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT\n-A INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT\n# etc\n\n# the limit prevents your logs from being flooded if there are a lot packets being captured\n-A INPUT -m limit --limit 5/min -j LOG --log-prefix \"iptables denied\" --log-level debug\n\nNote that I've omitted iptables before the commands, I recommend using iptables-restore (or iptables-apply for testing) to avoid locking yourself out if a rule fails to apply. The file to be passed to the command looks like:\n*FILTER\n# your rules here, for example:\n-P INPUT DROP\n-P INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT\nCOMMIT\n\nA newline after the COMMIT line is mandatory.\nBy default, the entries go to /var/log/kern.log. Not good if you want to differentiate between kernel and iptables messages, so create a filter for rsyslog in /etc/rsyslog.d/iptables.conf containing:\n:msg,contains,\"iptables denied\" /var/log/iptables.log\n& ~\n\nThis will filter iptables errors and send those to /var/log/iptables.log.\n\nA: In Ubuntu 18 apt update didn't worked until I allowed loopback (with -i lo ACCEPT). So, my \"safe rules\" list is\niptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT\niptables -A INPUT -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT\niptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT\niptables -A INPUT -j REJECT\n\n", "Q: Tortoisehg doesn't show up in nautilus context menu I just installed ubuntu 11.10 on my netbook yesterday.

It may be related to a bug in nautilus-python running on Oneiric. In the description, there is mention of a possible related bug with a similar context menu issue in another application.\n\nA: There is a bug reported on TortoiseHG bugtracker: https://bitbucket.org/tortoisehg/thg/issue/1333/ubuntu-1110-tortoisehg-doesnt-show-up-in.\n\nA: It seems to relate to bug #859104: Nautilus extensions written in Python do not work in Oneiric.

In your screen shot it is a file. so delete that file, create a folder with same name and then try again. \nIn terminal\nrm ~/.local/share/applications\nmkdir ~/.local/share/applications\n\n\nA: You provide very little information, but my guess is that you tried to do it as root. Don't use sudo when you do that, as root doesn't have that folder, and it wouldn't be of use to you anyway. \n$HOME/.local/share/applications is supposed to be a directory. If some application uses it for anything else, then that's a bug.

In some cases the microphone is a different sound card.

I have to respect various format guidelines, and my professor uses MS Word on his workstation. In my experience, LibreOffice has been faulty when it comes to MS Word compatibility, with many incorrect parameters (happened earlier this month). I can't afford a MS Office licence to install it in Wine, so I'd like to know if there are any alternatives for Linux.\n\nA: As of right now, LibreOffice is the most compatible word-processor with MS Office.\nKingsoftOffice has an interface which is more similar to MS Word than LibreOffice, but the documents made in KingsoftOffice are less compatible with MS Office than the documents made in LibreOffice. \nEven though KingsoftOffice has a similar interface (GUI), that doesn't mean that it is compatible with MS Office.\nI understand your problem, and I want to give you a good advice: Make the entire document in LibreOffice. Work in LibreOffice, but use MS Office only for final editing. \nMy advice does not work with complicated files with tables, but is sufficient for university dissertation with text and the occasional simple table. For final editing you can use someone else's MS Office, for example - The MS Office in your universities library.\nI know that My proposition is not ideal, but it is a proper solution: Editing mainly with LibreOffice, but using MS Office Word only for compatibility checking and compatibility editing. In some cases it may occur that the document made in LibreOffice is 99% compatible to MS Office Word, in some cases not.\nFormat editing usually takes less time than creating an entire document in MS Office. \nFor example, when I learned in university, I wrote my thesis in LibreOffice, but my roommate had legal installation of MS Word. I asked him for his MS Office installation only few times a month, when I need proper MS Word formatting.\n\nA: I think that'd be the default word processor that comes shipped with Ubuntu, LibreOffice.\nYou can also choose to run Office 2007 under wine, that should work. To make things easier there are tools like Winetricks and PlayOnLinux.\n\nA: Your best bet will be IBM lotus symphony. It is free and most compatible with MS office when compared with Libreoffice/Openoffice. Official Ubuntu binaries are available from their website for both 32bit and 64 bit architecture.Though package says Ubuntu 8.0, worry not it works well on Ubuntu 11.10.\nAlso don't forget to download and install the service pack 3.\nLink:\nhttp://www-03.ibm.com/software/lotus/symphony/home.nsf/home\nAtul Kakrana\n\nA: Yozo Office is your superb choice.\nFor dissertation i recommend Tex , it's NOT a MSWord processor , but a powerful tool that many people use\n\nA: There are a good compatible office suite for Linux, but unfortunately it’s proprietary.\n\n*\n\n*SoftMaker Office for Linux, a non-subscription licence costs $69.\n\nIt provides you with both a Ribbon-inspired UI and a standard toolbar-based UI.\n\nA: Kingsoft Office has been rebranded as WPS office.\nIt can be installed, for free, on Windows, Android, OS X and Linux. They provide a .deb file for Ubuntu, and it can be found on the playstore.\nIt's interface is similar to Word, with the ribbon at the top and the Alt keyboard shortcuts.\nIt includes a Writer, a Spreadsheet and a Presentation program as part of it - the 3 commonly used office tools. I've used the Writer mostly, but will be looking into the Presentation one soon to see how well it works with PowerPoint (e.g. animations).\nI'll add screenshots when I get home.\n\nA: The original question is dated 2011.  The answer is still basically the same in 2016 for a FOSS solution: Apache OpenOffice and/or LibreOffice.\nYou final paper should be paper hard copy or PDF for an \"electronic hard copy\".  Even different versions of Word can have incompatibilities with the same Wprd .DOC file.  All three editors can output to PDF (or you can install a PDF printer to print to and get your PDF that way), and if you and your reader both use the same PDF viewing/printing software, you should both see the same results.\n\nA: There is also Open Office which many people still use for free. It is compatible with all word documents and you can save as a word document. I recommend this software.\n", "Q: I try to install TweetDeck, but nothing happens Following the instruction from http://www.pablo-bloggt.de/linux/twitter-programm-fur-ubuntu-tweetdeck/, I go directly to http://www.tweetdeck.com/desktop/.\nBut when I press the 'Download Now'-Button, it's Label changes to 'Tweetdeck wird installiert' but nothing else happens. \nEdit:\nI found this which explains that I have to look for alternatives to Adobe Air.\n\nA: In case you are unsure to install an unsupported Adobe software you can also run Tweetdeck from within the Chrome or Chromium browser by installing the application from Chrome Webstore.\nAnother alternative for Ubuntu is Qwit.\n\nA: TweetDeck depends on Adobe Air, Install it first and then go to website and install it!\nhttp://get.adobe.com/air/\nUnfortunately this is the message from Adobe:\nAdobe AIR for Linux is no longer supported.

There's not a lot of \"customizability\" in Unity yet.  You could disable  from the launcher and have it run something more useful to you.\nHonestly, the behavior you want sorta exists in Unity in 11.10.  If you hit \"tab\" after \"Super\", you'll find a \"most frequently used\" set of options (it's the Applications tab in 11.04).  \nLike Gnome3, you can only go so far adjusting Unity at this point.  I would suggest classic mode for you, if it doesn't work.  You can get a dockbar on the left with one of many programs (Docky, Cairodock, Gnome-do, etc), and can use the same switcher choices (Compiz) in that mode.  \nReally, if you go into (you may need to install it) CompizConfig Settings Manager and check out the Unity Plugin... the controls in that plug-in are the only things you'd lose when going to Classic Mode.\n", "Q: Why can't I telnet to MySQL?

I've changed using sudo plus chown, but in previous versions of Ubuntu, I never had this kind of inconvenience.\nDoes anybody know why this is set for root after installing?\n\nA: First off, I suppose every partition is \"root owned,\" because only root can access the block device.  I am assuming you mean, though, that the files are owned by root.\nTo change ownership from root to your user on a partition mounted on /media/Backup, run this:\nsudo chown matt -R /media/Backup/  ,  where matt is your user.\nIf after this, you cannot access your files as a regular user, post the output of:\nls -l /media/Backup/\n\nA: To answer the portion of the the question \"why my backup partitions permission are set for ROOT only?\" \nThe most likely answer is that you used sudo when making the backup. By doing so you would have executed the command as root, and the files created would then belong to root.\n\nHow did you create the Backups by the way?

Unfortunately, this command just returns 'can't find file'.\nI really need to get this fixed...my wife needs to use the computer and get to her files.\nAnother glitch i noticed is that the shutdown always return the login screen instead of shutting down the computer.\n\nA: Removing ~/.Xauthority and restarting lightdm didn't work for me either, the file seems to be immediately recreated every time, however I did 2 things, possibly one of which solved my problem with logging in.\n\n\n*\n\n*I had previously added some custom command to the file /etc/profile, which I removed.\n\n*There was another file ~/.xsession-errors which I removed as well.\n\n\nAfter that and deleting ~/.Xauthority I was able to successfully log in, I don't know which of those things caused it though because I did them at the same time.\nHopefully this will be useful to you in solving your logging in problem. One other thing I did was to stop some services I had recently installed, but unless it took a long time to take effect that didn't seem to help either, might be worth a try though. \n\nA: Hmm. This is intriguing; I had exactly the same problem as you, and deleting my .Xauthority file solved it. \nI'm not sure it will make a difference, but while in your home directory could you try running sudo rm./.Xauthority? Restarting lightdm using sudo service lightdm restart (or restarting your computer) might help too. \nIf it doesn't, could you post a copy of your /var/log/lightdm/lightdm.log? You might be able to access it using the Log File Viewer, or Nautilus, from your guest account.\n", "Q: Switching between workspaces doesn't work - how to fix it?

Can I repair it?\nNote: I've used developer versions of Ubuntu Oneiric some time and just upgrade to latest version now. \nThanks for a suggestion!\n\nA: Check using CompizConfig Settings Manager (install if you dont have it) the number of virtual desktops assigned (horizontal and vertical size):\n\nThen have a look at System Settings>Keyboard>Shortcuts>Navigation and check your assigned keyboard shortcuts there:\n\nTry assigning new keys for them, if that works try reverting the original keyboard shortcuts.\n\nA: In my case I had to use gconf-editor and put Expo as the last plugin to load. I use hot corners though.\nTo do this you will have to install gconf-edtor, run it, then select 'apps' > compiz-1 > general > screen0 > options and double click on 'active_plugins'.\n\nA: I had a similar problem, but with non-standard shortcuts used -- icould only change left and down...\nI solved it by going to to keyboard shortcuts (Now keyboard > shortcuts) and changing the shortcuts to something used for something else, and then back (a couple of times, sort of \"jiggling it\").\nTry for example changing the  \"workspace left\" to shortcut to Ctrl+Alt+Up and \"workspace right\" to Ctrl+Alt+Down, and then set all four again afterwards.\nI have no idea why this worked.\n\nA: If you use gnome tweaks, try disabling extensions to see if any is catching the keyboard shortcuts.

Is there a way to disable a touchpad using a terminal command?\n\nA: synclient and xinput will not work if you are using gnome (or unity, cinnamon) environment, because it will override settings, so if you want synclient or xinput to take over these settings, you should disable that first:\n\n\n*\n\n*install dconf-editor if not installed:\napt-get install dconf-editor\n\n\n*run dconf-editor\ndconf-editor \n\n\n*open the directory /org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/mouse/ or /org/cinnamon/settings-daemon/plugins/mouse/, and unclick the checkbox for active.\n\n*logout or reboot\nThis should make synclient or xinput work. \n\nA: To turn off touch pad: \nsynclient TouchpadOff=1\n\nTo turn it back on: \nsynclient TouchpadOff=0\n\n\nA: There are at least two methods (that I know of) you could try. \nsynclient\nIf your laptop is equipped with a Synaptics (or ALPS) touchpad you can indeed use synclient as already mentioned by Shutupsquare.

I think it's better than removing it from kernel modules.\n\nA: You can change the services started at boot with the help of BUM.  \nInstall it: sudo apt-get install bum\nRun: sudo bum\n \nUncheck the box and click Apply.  \n\nA: I add \n\"/etc/init.d/bluetooth stop\"\n\ninto \n\"/etc/rc.local\" \n\nbefore \"exit 0\" command for boot with bluetooth turned off.\n\nA: 16.04+\n\nFrom ubuntu 16.04 onwards systemd manages startup services like bluetooth ... to view current status issue following in a terminal\nsudo systemctl status bluetooth.service \n\nto deactivate bluetooth on startup issue this \nsudo systemctl disable bluetooth.service\n\nthen on next reboot bluetooth will not be active ... to enable bluetooth issue ( then reboot )\nsudo systemctl enable bluetooth.service\n\n\nA: I think that the best way is to disable the service from being started in the first place. There is a general method for disabling services which works perfectly:\nsudo sh -c \"echo 'manual' > /etc/init/bluetooth.override\"\n\nThat works for Ubuntu 13.10 and probably for earlier versions as well.\n\nA: You can edit your update-rc.d settings. I used something similar to:\nsudo update-rc.d bluetooth remove\n\nIn Debian Wheezy. Check out man update-rc.d for more info on how to use it.\n\nA: To disable the bluetooth driver from loading on startup:\nsudo $EDITOR /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\n\nadd:\nblacklist btusb\n\nEnabling it later should just be:\nsudo modprobe btusb\n\n\nA: On Ubuntu Studio 16.04 you can disable Bluetooth Applet in Startup in:\n\nSession and Startup > Application Autostart > Bluetooth Applet\n\nHere you can click in the field to disable it.\n\nA: For Ubuntu 20.10\nFor this ubuntu edit /etc/bluetooth/main.conf and find the line\nAutoEnable=true\n\nand replace it with:\nAutoEnable=false\n\n18.04+\n18.04* users who don't naturally have a /etc/rc.local, you'll need to create one and make it executable. To make things slightly easier, you can just paste the following command into a terminal:\nsudo install -b -m 755 /dev/stdin /etc/rc.local << EOF\n#!/bin/sh\nrfkill block bluetooth\nexit 0\nEOF\n\n\nRun sudoedit /etc/rc.local and add this before line with exit 0:\nrfkill block bluetooth\n\nYou should still be able to enable Bluetooth through the top bar applet.\nThis should work for most systems but it looks like there are a few bugs lurking in the kernel's ACPI for Thinkpads. If you're on a Thinkpad, add the following to /etc/rc.local:\necho disable > /proc/acpi/ibm/bluetooth\n\nOr check out ibm-acpi - IBM ThinkPad ACPI Extras Driver -- some reports suggest that ibm-acpi includes bluetooth control (amongst other nice things). But I don't have the hardware so I'm completely unable to verify these claims. Good luck.\n\nA: No. It is not always in the startup applcations list. I think that the best solution is to add the rfkill command in rc.local script or to set the InitiallyPowered parameter in /etc/bluetooth/main.conf.\n\nA: Maybe you can turn it off in the Startup Applications.\nBut these applications are hidden by default.\nUnhide the hidden Startup Applications in 12.04: Open the terminal and run these two commands:\ncd /etc/xdg/autostart/\n\nsudo sed --in-place 's/NoDisplay=true/NoDisplay=false/g' *.desktop\n\nNow you can uncheck bluetooth. (Don't remove!)\n\nA: 1) Install the package smbios-utils and add it to Startup Applications with:\nsudo smbios-wireless-ctl --bt 0\n\n2) In terminal type:\nsudo visudo\n\nand add to the end of opened file /etc/sudoers the line:\n<your username> ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/smbios-wireless-ctl\n\n3) To switch bluetooth on during session, run in terminal:\nsudo smbios-wireless-ctl --bt 1\n\nThis works for me on my Dell D630 with Ubuntu 13.10\n\nA: On Ubuntu 16.04, I simply disabled the service from starting up using systemctl.\nTo do this, open up a terminal window and type the following:\nsudo systemctl disable bluetooth\nYou can either reboot since now bluetooth will be disabled from starting up, or if you do not want to reboot and want to stop bluetooth right away, you can type:\nsudo service bluetooth stop\n\nA: We can disable bluetooth auto start this way:\nsudo gedit /etc/bluetooth/main.conf \n(gedit is my fav editor, you can replace this with xed or whatever that's installed on your system.)\nAt the very bottom of this file, there's this line:\n#AutoEnable=false\nUn-comment it, like this: \nAutoEnable=false\n\n\nA: Since Ubuntu 18.04 (with GNOME) you need to\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit /etc/bluetooth/main.conf and find\nAutoEnable = true\n\nand change the value to:\nAutoEnable = false\n\nSo this device is not powered on startup.\n\n*Edit /etc/default/tlp and find:\n#DEVICES_TO_DISABLE_ON_STARTUP=\"bluetooth wifi wwan\"\n\nEdit this line to read:\nDEVICES_TO_DISABLE_ON_STARTUP=\"bluetooth\"\n\nSo this device is disabled on startup.\n\n*Then open Dash and search for \"Startup Applications\". Uncheck any items related to Bluetooth in the list. Click [Close] to save.\n\nA: I've tried several above answers, but they didn't work on Linux Mint with kernel 5.8.5. So, now I'm using cron job to turn off bluetooth when system boots. And the applet can be used to turn it back on.\nOpen root crontab on terminal\nsudo crontab -e\n\nAnd add following line and save (with sleep to make sure the processes have started)\n@reboot sleep 10; /usr/bin/bluetooth off\n\n\nA: Step 1: Go to the terminal and type in the following command to edit system's /etc/rc.local file:\ngksudo gedit /etc/rc.local\n\nStep 2:  Add the following line before the exit 0 line: \nrfkill block bluetooth\n\n\nA: I found a how-to with a clean \"workaround\" here (archive link for posterity)\nActually changing /etc/bluetooth/main.conf was enough for me.\nSearch for the entry:\nAutoEnable=true\n\nand change the value to:\nAutoEnable=false\n\nIt was enough for me, although the article describes some other steps that may or may not be necessary.\nOn Ubuntu 17.04 and older the option was named InitiallyPowered.\n\nA: Note: These instructions are for users who want to disable Bluetooth at boot by default in a way that it can easily be enabled afterward.\nGnome (Ubuntu 18.04+)\nDisable Bluetooth by default\nIn Gnome, Bluetooth is managed by gnome-bluetooth, which should remember the last setting you used. But you can force it to always be disabled at boot like this:\necho \"rfkill block bluetooth\" >> ~/.profile\n\n(Replace ~/.profile with ~/.zprofile if you're using zsh)\nThis avoids having to edit any system files such as /etc/rc.local\nManually enable Bluetooth\nWhenever you're ready to turn it on click in the top-right > Settings > Bluetooth > click the switch near the top right\nOr using the command line:\nrfkill unblock bluetooth\n\nUnity/Xfce (Ubuntu < 18.04, Xubuntu)\nDisable Bluetooth by default\nIf you're using the Bluetooth applet in the top panel (blueman-applet), it has its own setting that will automatically turn Bluetooth on even if you've disabled it in other places (like /etc/bluetooth/main.conf or /etc/default/tlp).\nTo prevent Bluetooth from turning on at startup using the command line:\ngsettings set org.blueman.plugins.powermanager auto-power-on false\n\nOr through the GUI:\n\n*\n\n*Click the Bluetooth applet > Plugins > PowerManager > Configuration\n\n*Uncheck Auto power-on\nNext time you reboot, the Bluetooth applet will still be visible but Bluetooth will be off.\nManually enable Bluetooth\nClick the Bluetooth applet > Turn Bluetooth On\n\nA: 1. block bluetooth in rc.local\nAdd this line at the end of the file /etc/rc.local right before the line exit 0:\nrfkill block bluetooth\n\nThis will do the trick, but only in older Ubuntu versions using upstart.\n2. reenable rc.local on systemd\nOn Ubuntu 15.10 with systemd as startup manager the /etc/rc.local file is not used by default any more, so call this on a terminal:\nsudo systemctl edit --full rc-local\n\nWhich opens an editor. At the end of the file i added:\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n\nThose changes are activated by\nsudo systemctl reenable rc-local\n\nNow the file /etc/rc.local is used as you know it.\n3. disable blueman-applet on start\nsudo sed -i 's/NoDisplay=true/NoDisplay=false/g' /etc/xdg/autostart/blueman.desktop\ngnome-session-properties\n\nNow blueman-applet is visible and you can disable it from startup programs\n4. Reboot to see the effect\n\nA: I using Sputnik Kernel, which fixed this on my Dell Inspiron 14R N4110.\n\nA: I think you should edit\n/etc/default/bluetooth\n\nand set\nBLUETOOTH_ENABLED=0\n\nto disable the bluetooth service at boot\n\nA: For those of you where inserting the line rfkill block bluetooth (or any other) in /etc/rc.local doesn't work, try to include the same line in the end of ~/.bashrc \nIn my set up (Ubuntu 14.04, Thinkpad W540), no option worked inserting it in /etc/rc.local but the former did work in bashrc. Note this will work just for the current user, not globally for all users.\n\nA: Unfortunately, nothing above work for me.\nInstead, I add this to the bottom line of ~/.profile \n( sleep 10; rfkill block bluetooth ) & \n\nIn my case, I  must wait for the blueman applet to start and enable bluetooth(unavoidably) before I could switch it off. \n\nA: Here is what worked for me on MX Linux 19.2. Both parts of this solutions have been mentioned in other answers, but not both together.\n\n*\n\n*Edit /etc/bluetooth/main.conf to set AutoEnable to false:\nAutoEnable=false\n\n(or just comment it out).\n\n\n*As suggested in this issue comment, execute\ngsettings set org.blueman.plugins.powermanager auto-power-on false\n\nto prevent Blueman's power-manager plugin from auto powering the adapter.\n\nA: I add \n\"/etc/init.d/bluetooth stop\"\ninto \n\"/etc/rc.local\" \n\nbefore \"exit 0\" command for boot with bluetooth turned off.\n\nA: Solution for my notebook\n\"BIOS - USB Configuration - EHCI2 : Disabled\"\nEHCI1 is for usb ports (actually My notebook has 2 usb 2.0 ports)\n\nA: Edit /etc/default/grub:\nsudo nano /etc/default/grub\n\nand change the following line:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"\"\n\nto say this instead:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"bluetooth.blacklist=yes\"\n\nThen, update grub and reboot:\nsudo update-grub\n\n\nA: This should disable bluetooth from starting on Debian based systems:\nsudo chkconfig bluetooth off\n\nor on RedHat based systems\nsystemctl disable bluetooth.service\n\n\nA: Pure systemd solution (16.04+)\nRather than use the legacy rc-local solution, here is a clean and portable systemd service that suspends bluetooth upon boot and also after waking up from sleep.\n\n\n*\n\n*Using sudo, create /etc/systemd/system/bluetooth-suspend.service with the following contents:\n\n\n[Unit]\nDescription=Disable bluetooth after waking up.\nAfter=suspend.target network.target\n\n[Service]\nUser=root\nEnvironment=DISPLAY=:0\nExecStart=/usr/sbin/rfkill block bluetooth\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=suspend.target network.target\n\n\n\n*Enable the service: sudo systemctl enable bluetooth-suspend.service\n\n*Reload systemd: sudo systemctl daemon-reload\nTo re-enable bluetooth, run rfkill unblock bluetooth in the terminal.\n\nA: You need to disable it from the Start Up Applications list in System Settings.\nClick on the cog in the top right hand side of the menu bar and then select System Settings.\nClick on Start Up Applications then scroll down until you find the bluetooth setting, take the tick from the box and you all done.\n\nA: I had to use a brute-force method to stop bluetoothd from being automatically started at boot. I renamed the executable so it couldn't be found.\n\nA: You can also use this Graphic application that also does this bluetooth manager\n", "Q: Authentication key isn't automatically imported when adding a PPA In previous Ubuntu releases adding a PPA in Software Sources imported an authentication key automatically.

I use digikam which suffers from a bug that means the editor loses its menu after the first launch. In 11.04 I could disable the global menu for digikam by launching it with:\nAPPMENU_DISPLAY_BOTH=1 digikam\n\nHowever this appears to have stopped working in 11.10. Is there some other way to get an application to show the menubar in the window rather than the panel?\n(Just checked and APPMENU_DISPLAY_BOTH=1 gedit does lead to gedit having a menu in the window. But maybe there is some other way?)\n\nA: From subscribing to the bug, someone reports:\n\nToday I removed the package \"appmenu-qt\".\n  All applications based on QT will start now without the global menu.\n  All other apllications are starting with global menu.\n  Digikam is working now, but I would like to have the global menu.\n\n\nA: Your question is '..to disable the global menu in digikam'\nWhat you've been doing previously is not disabling the global menu but enabling both the global & in app window menu.

If I switch manually to my windows box, I can get back to the ubuntu system with numlock-numlock, so it's not a problem with the keyboard or KVM switch.\nIs there a setting that will allow this to work again, or an alternative keystroke?  Failing that, is there a way to configure the switch to allow it to be triggered from ubuntu?\nEdited to add:\nThis may be a gnome 3.x problem, since I tried booting with a Fedora Live CD and it was also unable to use either key sequence to switch over to the other system.  \n\nA: I had the same issue and gleaned the answer from a post by George at http://beitis.net/ubuntu-kvm-switches-and-scroll-lock/\nBasically, the workaround is to go to the console (Control + Alt + F1) and do the Num Lock there.

I have a multifunction HP printer/scanner. I've always used it wirelessly with a PC before now, but want to connect it to my Maverick laptop. I have hplip installed and have connected the machine to the computer via USB (wireless is not supported.) The printer works just fine, but when I try to scan, the scanner's console (not the computer, but the window on the scanner itself) tells me there's an error.\nI've looked at the hplip documentation for my machine, and it says, \"Scan supported means that PC initiated scan using a SANE compatible software application is supported over parallel, USB, or network (depending on I/O connection).\"\nWhat is SANE? I'm assuming it's a driver that's already installed, but where do I find a SANE compatible software application?\n\nA: I still can't claim to understand exactly what SANE is, other than some kind of driver. But you can find a list of compatible GUI apps at The SANE Project website.\n\nA: I am no expert!\nTry to install the XSANE or SANE package in Synaptic. You might also need to install libsane-hpao which contains SANE's backend drivers for HP scanners. Start either XSANE or SANE in the menu-graphics.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: SANE is a program talking to your scanner hardware.\nI have the same printer. I installed it using HPLIP which is installed by default in Ubuntu and scanning worked out of the box (install hplip-gui if you want the graphical menu).\nHowever the printing driver added extra space (extra margins) so I uninstalled to try with another driver, installing it as a network printer through CUPS and using the hpijs driver instead of hp-cups. Which fixed my printing but broke scanning...\nInstalling the multifunction again through HPLIP toolbox added it as local printer and fixed scanning. So I keep the network version as default printer and renamed the local version to \"scanner\" to avoid confusion.\n", "Q: Workspace Switcher inoperative on nVidia dual displays When I click the Workspace Switcher button (or a button I've mapped to my mouse to do the same task), the screen shows several artifacts and I cannot switch displays properly.  \nHere is a picture of the display after I've clicked the Workspace Switcher button:\n\nI have an nVidia n260 video card with dual displays connected\n\nA: The problem was a compiz plug-in which was incompatible with this version of unity.\n", "Q: Remove old emblems from previous Nautilus version I've upgraded to Ubuntu 11.10, and I'd like to remove the emblems I put on certain folders from the previous menu of nautilus.\nHow can I do this?\n\nA: Finally, to solve my problem, I erased all files from the folder :\n~/.local/shared/gvfs-metadata\n\nCf. https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gvfs/+question/93098\n\nA: There a number of questions which are in some way duplicates of this one but none of them, including this one had an answer that worked for me.

Finally I move the folder contents to from the old folder to the new one and delete the old folder with it's emblems. Perhaps not elegant but it does work. The only gotcha is that if any folders or files that were synced with Ubuntu One need to be re-established. When you look in Ubuntu One your synced files will now be grayed out. Recheck each individually and accept that the files will be merged without creating duplicates. And you're done.\n", "Q: Is GNOME broken in 11.10? Me and my friend both installed GNOME on 11.10 I have problem that I cant left click on top bar, middle click also doesnt work. My friend gets weird tiny light blue boxes in GUI...\nSo is GNOME broken in 11.10 or we just have bad luck? OH and PCs arent similar, His is AMD/ATI laptop, mine is Intel/nV desktop\nEDIT: to make it clearer:\nI use gnome classic, and right click on top bar wont work... you know add to panel.... that menu behaves like it doesnt exist. My friend fixed his problem in GNOME 3 by going bact to open source driver.  But he still cant right click on top bar on GNOME classic. \n\nA: Even if you boot in GNOME 3 in fallback mode (what you call GNOME Classic) it would look like GNOME 2 but it won't be GNOME 2 and you won't be able to add applets and there is no right click on panels (nothing happen if you do a right click on panels) but you can do a Alt+RightClick on it to access it's properties dialog.\nI suggest you try using GNOME shell, it's hard to use at first but you'll get used to it in no time.\n\nA: No it isn't.\nIt has a lot of problems with closed ATI drivers, probably that explains what happens in your friends PC. It should work for him disabling Catalyst, going back to the open source drivers. \nI'm in the same situation: ATI laptop, and Gnome Shell not working. I think (I have read) the problem is in the drivers, not in Unity, so I hope ATI to fix it. I am not very optimistic about it happening soon either.\nEDITED:\nI have no idea about why could it be failing for your nVidia anyway. Is it an old GPU? May be it's also a problem with drivers, Gnome-Shell is a little picky about that. You could try newer experimental drivers. \n\nA: By gnome, do you mean you're logging into the gnome-shell? The default manager is Unity in 11.10, and this does not support right click. If you're in the gnome shell, I believe you use Super+Alt+Mouse2 to bring up applet menus, or Alt+Mouse2.\n\nA: Installing \"advanced settings\" package on Ubuntu 11.10 using software center will install gnome classic ,gnome 3 etc packages.\nI have installed it to just to switch between various icon themes.But later noticed it had automatically installed gnome classic package.\n", "Q: Change hotkeys/shortcut keys for volume control I need to change the hotkeys for volume control, since I suffer from a bug, which disallows me to use the standard function hotkeys of my notebook.\nSince I have updated I to Oneiric, I am not able to change the settings for the hotkeys.

Any help is appreciated.\n\nA: Your problem with Windows 7 was probably a hardware related problem which is why it still shows up in Ubuntu. \nI suggest you verify your memory with Memtest86+.

[Note: the new VPS already have the same users/groups with same UIDs/GIDs.]\n2) I want to preserve all symlinks and hardlinks, although I believe there is not a single hardlink in this case. I have lots of symlinks, both for files and for folders, all pointing to locations inside the own /home/jbruni folder.\n3) I'd really like to preserve date and times (mtime, atime, ctime).

This shouldn't be an issue for you because they're quite rare IMO.\n-z will attempt to compress the data in the stream (speed things up a bit).\n-v will make sure it's giving you plenty of output.\n\nA: I would use rsync for that.

In one corner I found a coin battery mounted vertically in a plastic case secured by  two tiny arms that hooked just over the top of the battery. I was unable to bend these arms back enough and pull the battery out with my other hand because there wasn't enough space. Frustrated, I stuck one end of a strip of scotch tape to the battery and pulled on the other end while bending the little arms back. The tape came off, but the battery had come up enough that it was holding the arms back some. After trying this again I had the battery dangling on the end of the tape.

Is there something about Ubuntu's testing process that might assure me, or should I just wait for reports from other X120e owners (aka guinea pigs) to come in before I make the leap myself?\n\nA: Dry run. Take the LiveCD and test it extensively on your system. Usually the drivers on the LiveCD will work the same when installed, even for upgrades. This won't guarantee that an distribution update glitch isn't introduced later, but at least ensures the initial compatibility state.\nAlso test the desktop environment for some time. Only upgrade if it's to your liking (the Gnome3 thing is widely unloved for example). Remember that neither of the two versions is a LTS.\nThat being said, your X120e https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/IBM_ThinkPad_X120e#Wireless does have fairly standard hardware.

Of the 6 Ubuntu PCs, 2 of them run on Unity 2D. What I saw in this installation was that the installers for Kubuntu were (In the best words I can put it) old school. For example the Ubuntu installer gives you more friendly options that help in installing it in a very easy way using the GUI. The Kubuntu installer looks like something that came from the 90's.\nThe Ubuntu one is friendlier in general and easier to read. The Kubuntu one well, lets just say is not.\nTo top that off, 3 of the PCs I tried crashed when running the installer. 2 of them crashes when creating a partition for /home. The other one crashed when I simply clicked next after the first language option. I had to try 4 more times until only one of them appear to accept and continue. The other 2 I just installed Ubuntu on them.\nEven the slideshow  in Ubuntu for example mentioned askubuntu as a source for help.

But I don't have CD (iso) so I made my backup and install back Ubuntu. \n\nA: Yes, you can. Burn an ISO of GParted : http://http://gparted.sourceforge.net\nThen configure your BIOS to run the disc you just burnt and the use of GParted is really straight forward you just have to resize the partition next to the root partition so you gain some space and then resize the root partition to take the new empty space and then apply.\nBut be careful, save the data on the partitions you are resizing because if the process is stop because of any reason (computer crash or the power shutdown) then you'll probably lose the capability of reading these data. And you should also know that resizing a NTFS partition is fast but resizing a ext3 partition take several hours depending on the size of the partition and the amount of data in these partitions  (should be faster with ext4 partitions but I don't know how much) and you'll not have access to your computer during this long amount of time.\nAlso if you resize a Windows partition Windows will do a checkdisk when you launch it next time, don't stop it, let it run the whole checkdisk if you don't want to have any problems.\n", "Q: Help with Wifi problem on Acer Aspire One 532h update to 11.10 I just upgraded to 11.10 and extremely frustratingly cannot keep a stable connection to ANY WLAN.\nIt will connect, then disconnect, then connect, making anything that requires the internet impossible.\nI have run \"rfkill list\" with this output:\n0: acer-wireless: Wireless Lan\nSoft-blocked: no\nHard-blocked: no\n1: phy0:  Wireless LAn\nSoft-blocked: no\nHard-blocked: no\n\nI have installed b43 firmware but that doesn't work.

Whenever you open a file, it logs the time, how you opened it, why it was opened, etc. For instance, if you open a video file from Nautilus to be played in Totem, then it would log that the file was opened because you double clicked in Nautilus and that it was played using Totem. If you open the same file from within Totem, then that would be logged too. All kinds of other information can be logged, like your current GPS position, or who were in the room with you, if you have Bluetooth enabled and have added them as known people. This way, the system can learn from your actions and provide something more than just a list of recently opened files. For instance, in the future you should be able to open blog posts you've commented on. \nAll that is to say that Ubuntu now has something a lot more powerful than just a simple \"recent documents\"-list. It will automatically learn what your favorite apps are and make them easy to access. Apps also have quicklists, which you access by right clicking on the icon in the launcher. Most apps do not use this feature yet, but they should provide useful items, like your ten most used \"things\". There's a keyboard shortcut, super+a to display them, or you can search for them in the dash. The same goes for files, which have the shortcut super+f or music, with super+m. You can also use the icons at the bottom of your dash, which is opened if you tap super. \n\nA: Go to Dash by pressing Super or the Ubuntu button (the first entry in the Launcher), browse to the Documents lens (at the bottom of the screen, third from left) and you'll see them there.\n\nA: \nTo answer the question, you can't. As an alternative, consider installing docky and using docklets (such as Recent Files) to do what you seek:\nsudo apt-get install docky\n\nAs to the suggestion of using the Dash -> Find Files, this does not provide the same functionality users had grown accustomed to with previous versions/desktops.  \nIn addition to the logical leap of connecting \"Find Files\" with Recent Files. It requires at least one additional click and does not succinctly list recent documents (you get six of them, with icons etc, and two-thirds of the dash is stuff other than recent documents - unless you click again to expand and even then, you have to figure out the sorting). \nSo when someone asks \"where's my cheeseburger?\" and you tell them \"Here is a pile of tofu - it's much better for you,\" that's not answering the question. \n", "Q: How to create a desktop shortcut in Unity? Is there an easy way to create a desktop shortcut for an application in Unity? The ability to right click or drag and drop icons to the desktop in Unity does not seem to be there.\n\nA: For Unity\nYou can search for the application you like to create a desktop shortcut for in the dash and drag it to the desktop. It is best done when your dash is not fully maximized and there are no maximized windows in the background as well.\n\nFor Unity-2D\nCurrently, you can't drag and drop from the dash to create a desktop shortcut. A bug report has been filed regarding this behaviour.\nHowever, you can use gnome-desktop-item-edit to create a new desktop shortcut.\nEnter the following command in a terminal:\ngnome-desktop-item-edit Desktop --create-new\n\n\nYou will then get the above pop up. Enter the command and other particulars of the application that you are trying to create a desktop shortcut for.\n\nA: Navigate to your application in Nautilus.\nRight-click, select \"Make Link\".  \nThen drag shortcut to your desktop.  Works in current 12.04.\n\nA: *\n\n*Bring up the terminal;\n\n*type: nautilus /usr/share/applications \n(from the terminal, this brings up a file explorer, with the initial location at the stated path)\n\n*Right-click on an existing Icon and and go to 'Properties'\n\n*You are looking for a Type:  desktop configuration file (application/x-desktop)\n\n*when you find one you like; Right-click that file, copy, and then paste it wherever you like (such as to your desktop)\n\n*rename and edit it accordingly.\n(common errors occur when; not using lowercase letters, not putting the proper parameters in the command line)\n\nA: IMO the simplest is to logout, login in the classic mode, create/copy shortcuts and then return to unity (or maybe not:-). \nAt the same time you can fill up some other launcher, for example Docky, with your \"favourite shortcuts\" as you do not have the favourites option in the unity launcher. \n", "Q: How do I get \"restart\" option in the shutdown menu in Unity? The dropdown menu I get when I click on the gear link in the top right corner only shows these options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Lock Computer\n\n*Logout\n\n*Suspend\n\n*Hibernate\n\n*Shutdown\n\n\nThere is no \"restart\" or \"reboot\".\nHow can I make that option available?\nBonus question: Can I remove Hibernate, Lock, and Suspend?\n\nA: The removal of the Restart menu item was a deliberate design decision - and to enforce this the developers actually removed the code...\nThus - the gconf/dconf entry...\n\n... is actually a redundant entry that should have/but hasnt been removed.\nTo get the restart menu option back you will need to download the source code (oneiric v0.3.7 at the time of writing this) and  to add back the code that was removed...\nFortunately #post11 of the bug report gave some example code of how to make the menu option reappear.  If you want to go down this route - you'll need to manually merge in the changes since the diff patch no longer marry up with the current code content.\nHappy compiling :)\n\nA: I have Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS and experienced the same problem, my menu didn't show \"Restart\" and \"Shutdown\" anymore.\nI installed https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/oneiric/dconf-tools/.\nIn the left tree select apps > indicator-session and check/uncheck the following options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check suppress-logout-menuitem\n\n*Check suppress-logout-restart-shutdown\n\n*Uncheck suppress-restart-menuitem\n\n*Uncheck suppress-shutdown-menuitem\nWith these settings the \"Restart\" and \"Shutdown\" options appear again in the top right menu.\n\nA: You don't. It's been moved to the shutdown dialog, which is quite appropriate, I think. You can also press super and enter \"reboot\", or even drag reboot to your launcher, if you really want quick access to it. :)\n", "Q: Issues checking out code from Google Code I've recently upgraded to Ubuntu 11.10 and since then, I haven't been able to checkout code from Google Code.

(crit = +100.0 C)\nThe bottom of the laptop becomes generally hot, while the areas around the fan and around the CD player stay relatively cool.\n\nA: I REALLY suggest you do a very thorough clean of the inside of the laptop and add a cooling system to it. It might as well be that lm-sensors is detecting that and Ubuntu just to make sure the whole place does not get on fire it shuts the laptop off. Would be good if you could add if the laptops air ventilations are clean, how old is the laptop, what other OS systems you have tested there and what video card you have (model of laptop also). But in general a temperature that high just means the laptop is calling for help to get clean.\n", "Q: Why does Ubuntu 11.10 start and shut down so slowly? Ubuntu's always been very fast on my computer. I have 3GB RAM, and previous versions booted in under 40s and shut down in under 5s. Most recently, Natty took 40s to boot and only 4s to shut down. However, since installing Oneiric, my boot time has gone up to 50s and my shut down time to over 11s! A slight increase is fine, but this is quite alarming. I wait for applications to properly terminate, so that's not the issue. The only startup applications I have are Jupiter and Caffeine.\n\nA: The problem is the links /etc/rc0.d/S35networking and /etc/rc6.d/S35networking.\nI've reported a bug in Launchpad.\n\nA: For what I know, the only version where booting speed was a factor was Ubuntu 10.10. After that the developers focused on other stuff like better integration between apps, Better Unity usage and feel, compatibility with Gnome-Shell for those users that wanted that, Changes in how apps communicated between each other and many other features that we actually take for granted.\nAm not a huge fan of Unity myself but I can not deny that 11.10 came with a punch of big nice changes for Unity and how way we use a desktop. Adapting to Unity is not easy but so far I have seen nice results.\nReturning to the question at hand, this also happens to me but is not such a big deal if what is between (Actually using Ubuntu) has been enhanced a lot of ways. It would not surprise me if in some of the minor updates that come every so many days, a small fix would improve the speed of boot time and shutdown time.\n+1 to your question since I was also wondering the same thing but seeing the progress Ubuntu made in just 6 months makes us think about how good will 12.04 be.\n\nA: I had a similar experience and disappointment after installing Ubuntu 11.10 (Oneiric)\nI looked some more into it to find out (in my case) this was caused by the network-manager. While shutting down it seems to time out and end with the message\n   \"nm-dispatcher.action: Caught signal 15, shutting down. ...\"\nI removed the network-manager and configured my ip address by using /etc/network/interfaces and it is now fast again.\nMight be you have the same problem ....\n\nA: I had the same experience \"Waiting for network configuration\", I resolved the proble commenting all the lines in /etc/network/interfaces except\n  auto lo\n  iface lo inet loopback\n\n", "Q: Laptop Asus G1S NO sound from built-in speakers After installing 11.10 from 11.04 I do not have sound coming out from my built-in speakers when I plug in headset or other speaker it works fine but the built-in speakers won't make a noise...\nI tried reinstalling system=no results\nAny possible sound option does not help either.\nAny ideas?\nThanks\n\nA: Try checking your drivers.

Now it displays applications across all workspaces. I have a lot of windows opened when working. I'm grouping opened applications to separate sets which are placed on different workspaces. This is how I found myself be more productive. But now it became totally time consuming, if I need click \"tab\" button more than 10 times while I reach some app.\nHow can I force the windows switcher to display only applications from current workspace?\n\nA: For 12.04\nBy default the switcher in 12.04 only shows the applications in the active workspace.\nFor 11.10\nThe method described below does not force the Alt + Tab switcher to display applications from the active workspace but instead, display those applications next to each other. This would mean that you can switch to it relatively easily compared to switching between applications in all the workspaces.\nYou can change the behavior of the Alt + Tab switcher. There is an option in compizconfig-settings-manager  that lets you group the applications together from the active workspace. \nTo install CCSM, run the following command in a terminal:  \nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\n\n\n*\n\n*What are some of the issues with CCSM and why would I want to avoid it?\nTo enable the setting, click on Ubuntu Unity plugin and select Switcher tab and tick Bias alt-tab sorting to prefer windows on the current viewport. \n\n\nThis will ensure that the applications from the same workspace will get grouped together in the window switcher.\n\nA: This is actually fixed in 12.04: \"In 12.04, by default Alt-tab will only switch between windows on the currently visible workspace(s).\"\nSee https://bugs.launchpad.net/unity/+bug/863399 for details.\n", "Q: My launcher disappeared Installed 11.10 today to my netbook, and after a reboot the Launcher is gone entirely.

Super button does nothing.\nHaven't altered it in any way, just finished a clean install.\n\nA: I had a similar problem on my notebook. First, I'd suggest to try to use Unity2D (select \"Ubuntu 2D\" session when logging in). This brought a usable desktop up for me. If you are using an AMD graphics card, you might then try to install the proprietary driver (fglrx). This solved the problem on my notebook, meaning that with fglrx I'm also able to use the usual \"Ubuntu\" session. When thinking about it, have you tried the keyboard combination to switch between LCD and external monitor? I just now had the idea that this might be because X11 thinks that the notebook LCD is the second monitor and therefore puts the Dash on the external monitor (which probably isn't connected).\n\nA: Ctrl+Alt+T to open a terminal.\nunity-2d-launcher\nIt will say \"miss libGL.so.1\"\nFor me I install gnome-shell and startup by gnome-shell and then reinstall ATI-xorg binary package.

That is just being aware of all the systems that consume power and making sure that they're not being ravenous/performance maximizing. Here are a few steps I took.  They made my laptop stop overheating to the point of powering down but there is still more to be done.  Definitely make sure your BIOS is up to date (lenovo makes boot cds for it) is the biggest step of that list.\nHaving said that, there's also things taking power that are not apparently changeable.

Please tell me if somebody solve that problem?\nIt looks like if I quick press one key several times only first press works, but if I press the same key with time interval of one second so it works normally.\n\nA: It sounds like you have the Bounce Keys accessibility feature turned on.  This is intended to help people who have trouble using the keyboard without producing unwanted duplicate key presses, but is obviously not something you want or expect.\nYou probably enabled it accidentally via a special keyboard shortcut that I can't remember.

Turning off and back on the keyboard repeat setting in gnome seems to have fixed the problems for me.  But again, it's a temporary fix: the problem will happen again and it gets me very upset.

After upgrading to 11.10 from 11.04, first, UBUNTU classic got disabled but I got it back using fall back option. Now it does not look anything like it used to. My previous settings are all washed out. Compiz-config does not seem to work at all. It is not in the startup applicaions list. None of the enabled effects work. I have already installed Nvidia Graphics driver. Please help.\nAlso, I had a customized theme before upgrading. Both the theme and the customization option seem to have disappeared. Can I get the saved theme back?\nI use sudo wvdial to connect to the Internet. But the Ubuntu software center does not recognize the Internet connection and does not allow me to install any softwares. Please help.\n\nA: These are many questions and should really be asked as such. But I'll provide a generic answer anyway. \nThere are heavy underlying changes in 11.10, following the switch to Gnome 3. Theming has become much easier, because it's now just CSS, which is the same as all websites use to define looks. This means that a lot more people will be able to make themes, so we should expect to see some dashing ones in the future. Unfortunately, this also means that old themes do not work. \nThemes are just one of many things that have been upgraded in Gnome 3 and hence Ubuntu 11.10. The configuration system itself is one of them, meaning that some settings are no longer available and that new ones have been added. Startup applications is one area that have been changed to become more user friendly. Applications can choose if they should appear in the list or not, for instance. This reduces unnecessary clutter. \nThis is a large upgrade, much bigger than anything in Ubuntus history. In fact, there's been no change like this for over ten years, in case you joined Ubuntu in 11.04 and think it's a little unsettling with so big changes. They happen very rarely, and you can expect to not see changes like this for many years. It has been very important to get this done now because of the LTS version that is scheduled for April and will be supported for a long time and sold with new computers, etc. Because of that, some thing may be a little unpolished and there are some rough edges still. The good thing is that all the technology is now in place, and now it's time to polish and fix minor issues. \n\nA: To enable compiz on Ubuntu Classic mode is pretty simple. \nPress Alt+F2 and type compiz --replace\nIt worked for me.\nI did it since I hate Unity and switch to classic mode but still eye-candy things. \n", "Q: How do I install Gimp 2.7?

I get the same with 2.7.\nI really need Gimp. But installing Gimp 2.6 isn't possible as well.\nWhen I remove the repos for 2.7, I still get the same error.\n\nA: The following thing did it for some reason.\nIt seemed like the problem was a gimp-data 2.7 package, that was still installed after I removed the ppa ppa:matthaeus123/mrw-gimp-svn .\nAfter I removed this package and then removed the ppa:matthaeus123/mrw-gimp-svn it installed gimp 2.6 immediately.\nI tried to add the ppa again (to install 2.7, because I made a file with that and need to open it - which doesn't work with 2.6), but always got an error about a missing libbabl.0.so.0 file (although it was installed).\nI also tried this ppa which I stumbled upon:\nhttps://launchpad.net/~alex-p/+archive/notesalexp-oneiric\nI also checked the list of sources when I do an apt-get update, but it's not even in there.\nAt least I have one gimp.\nBut if somebody knows a trick that is worth trying, I'd love to hear it.\n(it has gimp 2.73 in it, but when I add it and also activate it nothing happens)\n\nA: Try to install it again using this PPA: ppa:matthaeus123/mrw-gimp-svn\nI installed GIMP this way without unmet dependencies problems.\n\nA: If you want to use the ppa mentioned for gimp it only has i386 packages for 11.10, the amd64 failed to build quite some time ago.\nIf your on a 64 bit install then just use 11.10's version which is simply named gimp\n\nA: EDIT: Be warned that adding the repositories from my post here and updating your packages from there may BREAK your GTK+ settings (themes) and such.\n\nActually when you add the repository for matthaeus123 it indicates what needs to be done:\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:matthaeus123/mrw-gimp-svn\n\nIt mentions that there are packages in oneiric that need to be updated. So then add:\n\nsudo add-apt-repository http://ppa.launchpad.net/gnome3-team/gnome3/ubuntu\nsudo add-apt-repository http://ppa.launchpad.net/ricotz/testing/ubuntu\n\nThat seems to fix the dependency problems.\nIf you are getting an error like this: \n\ngimp: error while loading shared libraries: libbabl-0.0.so.0: cannot open shared\n\nYou can try fixing it by entering this into a terminal:\n\nsudo apt-get remove libbabl-0.0-0\nsudo apt-get clean\nsudo apt-get install gimp\n\n\nA: I'd appreciate not making any posts look like a solution when they are not (SimonEritsch's answer).\nAs I understand it there are no amd64 packages available yet (thank you doug for the information) and currently this would be the only proper answer to the original question.\nAs for the tip to try to install this - installation failed.\nRelated post http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1834302\n\nEDIT:\n@imonEritsch\nIt did nothing. Probably you ended up with GIMP 2.6.x.\nHere's a solution to install GIMP 2.7.4. Tested on ubuntu 11.10 x64. \n1. Open the Terminal and issue the following commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:matthaeus123/mrw-gimp-svn\nsudo apt-get update\n\n2. Run Software Center, search for GIMP, press 'More info' (it should already state that you're about to install 2.7.4) and install it without changing any options.\nNow, the above is bit by bit what I did that gave me a working GIMP without any additional hassling but the following should work as well:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:matthaeus123/mrw-gimp-svn\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gimp\n\nEdit:\nThe last 3 commands method confirmed working.\n\nA: You need to remove gimp, gimp-data and libgimp 2.7.3 manually.\nRemove the mattheus ppa and restart ubuntu. then you should able to install gimp 2.6.11.

This will allow you to edit the files in the FTP!\nThis is a very simple solution for a one-website apache server.  More work is required if you plan on running multiple sites (creating separate folders for them in webroot for example) \nThe advantages of this are that if someone does find a vulnerability, they are locked into the webroot folder, and not your home folder!

Rebooted and it works like a charm.\n\nA: It sounds like you have a keyboard layout with dead keys selected.  In this mode, pressing \" followed by something like a will generate the character ä.  Pressing Space cancels the dead key behaviour to give you a plain quote character.\nYou can turn off dead keys support as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*From System Settings, open the Keyboard Layout control panel.\n\n*Click the button marked with a plus sign in the lower left of the window, and add the new layout.  For example, if you currently have English (US, international with dead keys) selected, add English (US).\n\n*Remove the old keyboard layout by selecting it in the list and pressing the \"minus\" button in the lower left of the window.\n\n\nA: Notice that this only happens when selecting \"English (US) with dead keys\". Selecting \"English (international AltGr dead keys)\" will not require a space for quotes, but typing AltGr+a will produce á.\n\nA: There is a also a possibility that while working you pressed 'ctrl' and 'shift' key simultaneously.

In what areas will I see the most significant changes? And in what areas am I unlikely to notice any?\nWould switching to Lubuntu be indicated for an older computer with <= 1gb ram?\n\nA: A short answer is YES: LXDE is a lighter-weight environment, also Lubuntu uses lighter equivalents of some programs (file manager etc.), absence of 3D-effects means there's no need for Compiz or other compositing manager - this all results in lower memory usage.\nLower memory usage means there's more space for your programs to run, meaning they'll load faster and in many cases will run faster. \nAlso, more free memory means more space for disk cache, so some file operations may improve too.\nAreas where you will unlikely notice any improvements:\n\n\n*\n\n*purely CPU-intensive tasks which use little RAM\n\n*network connection speed\n\n\nI would definitely recommend Lubuntu or some other lightweight distribution on a computer with <=1gb RAM (actually, <=2 Gb).\n\nA: Lubuntu is designed to be a Ubuntu-based system that works well on hardware that might be too outdated or slow to run a full fledged Ubuntu/gnome desktop - however, I know many people who use it as their main desktop (including myself).\nTo install Lubuntu, use the Ubuntu Software Center..\nNow for the difference between lubuntu and lxde \nlxde is the LXDE desktop - lubuntu doesn't use the normal packages (such as Chromium instead of Firefox, lxterminal instead of gnome-terminal etc) that aren't as heavy on the RAM and CPU as the other options out there.\nSwitching to lubuntu for a computer with less than 1GB of ram is (for me at least) highly recommended - lubuntu pretty much races along with 1GB of ram on my machine.\n\nA: Lubuntu uses the LXDE desktop, which runs lighter on the graphics than GNOME (especially GNOME 3), KDE, and even XFCE. On older systems with low RAM and lower-end graphics, it will dramatically improve performance. The Lubuntu distro is also more lightweight than Ubuntu in terms of install space and resource-hungry applications. It was designed for low-end  and outdated hardware, so the included apps are also resource light, like Chromium instead of Firefox, and AbiWord and Gnumeric instead of the full LibreOffice suite. For \"normal\" users, those who browse the web, write documents, etc. Lubuntu has everything they typically need. If you're intending to do video editing or more intense processing, then you're probably using hardware that can handle Ubuntu without problems.\nAccording to the Lubuntu website, the base system requirements:\n\nA Pentium II or Celeron system with 128 MB of RAM is probably a bottom-line configuration that may yield slow yet usable system with Lubuntu. It should be possible to install and run Lubuntu with less memory, but the result will likely not be suitable for practical use.\n\nIf you're using top-of-the-line or even currently run-of-the-mill hardware, there aren't likely any advantages to Lubuntu over the other flavors of Ubuntu; but if you're using older or lower end hardware, even netbooks, you'll probably appreciate the lighter interface, freeing up resources for applications. A computer with less than a gig of RAM would probably appreciate the extra free resources in Lubuntu, as my old laptop with 1.25GB runs much more smoothly and swiftly on Lubuntu than it did on Ubuntu or Xubuntu.\n\nA: I would consider lubuntu much faster as compared to ubuntu. I did live testing by spinning up two Virtual machines on my desktop both with identical configuration with 512 MB RAM and 1 CPU. \nBooting and installation time was almost same, but when it comes to opening multiple applications such as opening multiple tabs on browser Lubuntu really surpases Ubuntu in speed due to its light weight desktop environment. Also opening terminal was much quicker in Lubuntu as compared to Ubuntu.\nSo my vote goes to Lubuntu if you have older processors and less RAM, most likely your old PC then go for Lubuntu, however, if you have newer PC with good hardware then go for Ubuntu to have its rich GUI features. Hope this helps.\n\nA: Lubuntu is radically faster than most other desktops and requires very little RAM. It's the same operating system, though. It's just a different desktop. You can install the LXDE desktop in Ubuntu by following this link: https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/natty/lxde/\nNote that this will not be the same as Lubuntu. Lubuntu contains Chromium instead of Firefox, etc. Installing LXDE will not install those extra packages, only the desktop. You can then choose to login with LXDE by pressing the button next to the password field when you log into Ubuntu. Note that Lubuntu also uses some nice themes and things that aren't part of the LXDE package. \nTo install the entire Lubuntu package, use this link: https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/natty/lubuntu-desktop/\n\nA: I have a Core 2 Duo (1.6 GHz)computer with 2GB of RAM and Lubuntu/lxde is the fastest compared to unity, xubuntu/xfce, kubuntu/kde.

If I install lubuntu-desktop to try Lubuntu and then later remove it, will my normal Ubuntu  be safe, unchanged and uncluttered?\n\nA: It is indeed possible to fully retain your Ubuntu desktop after removing it.

I saw a pop up which said 'updates are available' so I clicked it. I completely forgot that the installation was incomplete, I logged off. NOw when I came back, it told me to do a partial update.

I'm not sure if it's because of the incomplete update, but I'm quite off, in trouble. Please reply. Thank you\nRegards\nJunior\n\nA: It depends to what phase of the update you were on, If it was just downloading, Its fairly safe\nIf its installing, a sudo apt-get -f install will fix it in most cases, but sometimes it does not work\n", "Q: ATI graphical driver installation error I just installed ATI driver, but when I am trying to start tha AMD/ATI Control center, I'm getting the following error:\nThere was a problem initializing Catalyst Control Center Linux edition.

Why?\n\nA: By convention, applications produce output on two file descriptors: 1 (stdout) and 2 (stderr).  The pipe feature of the shell redirects the stdout of one process to the stdin of another.  This way, applications can separate out error or status messages from their normal output and still be usable when piping their output.\nIt seems that the output you want to pipe to zenity is being sent to stderr.  In your second command line, the 2>&1 part says to redirect all output ncftpput sends to stderr to stdout.

Last thing that happened - I configured compiz to use flat-file backend (no gconf) , it worked but on restart the edge-bindings (expo,windows scale) weren't working (the expo only opened with binding and didn't close ,so I figured the launcher could be the problem) .

I would like to type Hebrew in Ubuntu. I tried downloading the Hebrew language pack and then setting alt-shift as my layout-change shortcut in the Options section of \"Keyboard Layout\".\nHowever, when I actually press alt-shift, nothing happens. How can I switch my keyboard layout to Hebrew?\n\nA: In Ubuntu 12.04 LTS,\nGoto the Keyboard Layout Options window I could select Key(s) to change layout and mark the binding of my choice. I use Shift + CapsLock to toggle the layout from the keyboard itself without having to use mouse cursor to select the required layout from the panel indicator. The same key combo seemed to work to serf through or select between multiple layouts. (But in Ubuntu 13.10 it wasn't so easy.)\n\n\nIn Ubuntu 13.10,\nGoto the Keyboard settings window, under Shortcuts tab, I select Typing. The default for Switch to next source is Super+SPACE which didn't seem be working for me and so by clicking on it and I assigned a New Accelerator..., to change to next Layout (I used Super+L).\n(Then I assigned something similar for Switch to previous source using the same preferred layout, and then began to test them. Switching from the preferred layout to the alternate worked but the reverse did not. Please refer the next step for the fix.)\n\nThe Fix: After assigning Super+L for \"Switch to next source\" using my preferred layout (A), I changed my keyboard layout to the alternative layout (B) and then assigned the combination to \"Switch to previous source\" (for which I used Shift+Super+L). Then I tested them, and they work fine. (Maybe disabling \"Switch to previous source\" would work too.)\nThe new accelerators for the key combos that I used looks like this:\n\nI could then switch to layout (A) using Super+L and back to layout (B) using Shift+Super+L.\n\nA: I am a totally new to Ubuntu, I just installed it yesterday and I am loving it, but I have encountered the same problem when I was trying to use keyboard shortcuts to switch from Latin to Arabic, but fortunately I found the solution, here is simply what to do:\n\nSystem Settings... → Keyboard Layout → (click on \"+\" to Add new Language layouts) → Options... → (click on) \"Key(s) to change layout\" → (tick) \"Left Alt+Left Shift\" → Close\n\n\nA: To switch keyboard layout on Ubuntu 12.04 \n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Settings...\n\n*Under Keyboard Layout - click on Options...\n\n\n*Under Key(s) to change layout - choose the combination of keys you would like to use.\n\n\nA: Double-check if you've got this combination already set in compiz-config.

Enabling Bias alt-tab sorting to prefer windows on the current viewport as described here made no difference. How can I get back the exact same behavior as 11.04, so that alt-tab only switches between windows on the current workspace?\nSimply disabling the alt-tab and shift-alt-tab keybindings on the unity switcher seems to have helped, but it still switches workspaces on me sometimes.  For example, if I give a terminal window focus then press alt-tab, it switches to another terminal window on any workspace before trying to switch on the same workspace. Also, the Unity switcher still shows up when I alt-tab then hold alt even though I removed its alt-tab keybinding.\n\nA: You should install CompizConfig Settings Manager.

As mentioned by @muldune, you can use a Yubikey to perform 2FA encryption with LUKS. Have a look at my AskUbuntu answer here. \n\nA: I'm sorry no one has previously answered your question. If you are still interested, no it is not currently possible; the only way you can make your key more secure is one of the below.\n\n\n*\n\n*You can use a \"one-time key\" that is changed at each startup. These keys are usually created by reading /dev/Xrandom during dm-crypt setup. No key is stored this way and no passphrase needed, but this method can only be used on filesystems that can be formated at each reboot (like swap or maybe /tmp if you do not want to retain the information stored there). Using suspend to disk will be impossible with one-time keys used on the swap device.\n\n*You can store the key on removable storage. That way it is only accessible when needed. Your data is in the open when the storage is stolen or copied.\n\n*You can generate a hash value (== a pseudorandom number) from a keyphrase and use that as a key. The key is not stored on media that way at all, but you can not change the passphrase (a different key is generated then). All people with access to the encrypted data need to know this passphrase. This is a bit impractical in a multi user environment.\n\n*You can encrypt the key. The encrypted key is stored on the computer \nwith the encrypted device. You can change the passphrase    by\nreencrypting the key with a different one and you can have    several\ncopies of the same key encrypted for several people.\n\n*You can encrypt the key and store it on a removeable media.\n\n*You can use smartcards etc. This is the most secure option.\n\nA: I haven't tried it myself yet, but you could use a Yubikey, configured to hold static password (up to 38-characters) in the second slot (first slot is OTP which you'd want to keep for use with a password manager). \nIn theory, you would type in your shorter, easy to remember, pass phrase and then append it with the static password from a Yubikey. Since the Yubikey looks like a USB HID you shouldn't have a problem using it as long as USB keyboard support is enabled in the BIOS.\n\nA: Look at this, my be what you want https://www.masarlabs.com/article/two-factor-luks-decription/\n", "Q: Mouse stutters, but trackpad is smooth On my Dell Latitude E6410, several USB mice I tried are often \"stuttery\", but the trackpad is always working fine.\nAny ideas how to solve this issue?\nThanks!\n\nA: Sorry, I'm a chinese student, my English is not well, but I really know how to deal this problem.\nThis problem is worked in ACPI，you can edit grub by terminal to change it:\ncd /etc/default\nsudo cp grub grub.backup (just in case it goes wrong)\nsudo gedit grub\n\nchange this line:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\n\nfor this:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash pci=noacpi\"\n\nsave, then run:\nsudo update-grub\n\nand if wireless out of work，you can edit:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash pci=force\"\n\nI hope I can help you, excuse me, my English is so bad, I will learn it try my best. haha~\n\nA: Might sound stupid, but have you tried looking at the surface where you're trying to use the mouse on?

One of the simplest examples is the rrdtool file.\n\nA: You'll have to create a new file:\n/etc/bash_completion.d/foo\n\nFor a static autocompletion (--help / --verbose for instance) add this:\n_foo() \n{\n    local cur prev opts\n    COMPREPLY=()\n    cur=\"${COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD]}\"\n    prev=\"${COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD-1]}\"\n    opts=\"--help --verbose --version\"\n\n    if [[ ${cur} == -* ]] ; then\n        COMPREPLY=( $(compgen -W \"${opts}\" -- ${cur}) )\n        return 0\n    fi\n}\ncomplete -F _foo foo\n\n\n*\n\n*COMP_WORDS is an array containing all individual words in the current command line.\n\n*COMP_CWORD is an index of the word containing the current cursor position.\n\n*COMPREPLY  is an array variable from which Bash reads the possible completions.\n\nAnd the compgen command returns the array of elements from --help, --verbose and --version matching the current word \"${cur}\":\ncompgen -W \"--help --verbose --version\" -- \"<userinput>\"\n\nSource\n\nA: If all you want is a simple word based auto-completion (so no subcommand completion or anything), the complete command has a -W option that just does the right thing.\nFor example, I have the following lines in my .bashrc to autocomplete a program called jupyter:\n# gleaned from `jupyter --help`\n_jupyter_options='console qtconsole notebook' # shortened for this answer\ncomplete -W \"${_jupyter_options}\" 'jupyter'\n\nNow jupyter <TAB> <TAB> autocompletes for me.\nThe docs at gnu.org are helpful.\nIt does seem to rely on the IFS variable being set correctly, but that hasn't caused any issues for me.\nTo add filename completion and default BASH completion, use the -o option:\ncomplete -W \"${_jupyter_options}\" -o bashdefault -o default 'jupyter'\n\nTo use this in zsh, add the following code before running the complete command in your ~/.zshrc:\n# make zsh emulate bash if necessary\nif [[ -n \"$ZSH_VERSION\" ]]; then\n    autoload bashcompinit\n    bashcompinit\nfi\n\n\nA: Just adding this here in case it helps anyone.\nExamples aside, the definitive source/reference to learn more about this topic is the bash manual itself (i.e. type man bash in a terminal)\nSearch for headings \"Completing\" and \"Programmable Completion\". (in the current version of the bash documentation, these appear around lines 2219 and 2332 respectively), and also the relevant bash builtin keywords referenced in those sections (e.g. compgen (line 2627), complete (line 2637), etc)\n\nA: None of these answers gave me the 'type some random stuff and it just works' feel I was looking for so I used a different approach that I think works much better using fzf (sudo apt install fzf)\nLet's take a simple case first.\nLet's say we want to echo some word from a dictionary (/usr/share/dict/words) with auto-suggestions of the words.\nWe can do this with this bash function:\n function ppp(){ echo \"Your word is: $(cat /usr/share/dict/words | fzf -q \"$1\" --prompt \"hi> \")\";};\n\nPaste that into your shell then try:\nppp fuzz [hit enter]\n\n\nChoose your word by typing more letters or using arrow keys, hit enter, and:\nYour word is: fuzzball\n\nPerfect.\nNow let's take a more interesting example - let's do auto-completion for a package.json file's \"script\" commands\nFirst sudo apt get install jq fzf then copy/paste this function:\nfunction ppp(){ pnpm $(jq -r \".scripts|keys[]\"<$(pnpm root|sed 's/node_modules//')package.json|fzf -q \"$1\" --prompt \"pnpm> \");};\n\nNow go into a node project folder (or subfolder) and\nppp tes\n\n\nThis works for anything for the pattern of filter/choose/run command.\nAdd the function to your .bashrc and happy days.\n", "Q: Touchpad Problem - shortly after login, it stops working I've Ubuntu 11.10 and my problem is about the touchpad.

I then followed the troubleshooting pages for wireless networking and found that the realtek rtl8192cu driver was in the library, and used modprob (I think) to enable it as directed. It is associated with the realtek usb adaptor in Network Manager, and one can see the available wireless networks (so I know its working to some extent).

When it times out, it prompts for the code again.\nI have stuck in an old Broadcom usb dongle, which connects happily using the WEP code.\nSo, my current guess is that it is a driver problem.

I am quoting:\n\nObviously the kernel tried to allocate memory but somehow wasn't able to do so. The error manifested itself in freezing the system during start-up. As you can see in the kernel.log the boot process froze shortly after loading the bootsplash ...\nHere's the solution:\nSimply add more memory ^^\nFirst of all, Ubuntu 11.04 utilizes grub2, so you won't find any \"menu.lst\". You could edit the \"/boot/grub/grub.cfg\" but this file gets overwritten every time you update your kernel (e.g.). So find \"/etc/default/grub\" and edit the line \"GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT\". Now, add the option:\nvmalloc=192MB\n\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash vmalloc=192MB\"\n\nsudo update-grub\n\nNow Natty boots like a charm, no freezing, if 192MB aren't enough -- try to increase the value. Hope that helps.\n\n\nA: Same problem here. After a fresh install of Ubuntu 11.10 the graphical environment will never load. What worked for me(sort of) was:\n1) On the grub menu I chose \"Previous Linux Versions\". (This boots me with 3.0.0-12-generic instead of 3.0.0-12-generic-pae)\n2) This time Unity loads. I go to 'System Settings' -> 'Additional Drivers' , and choose some other option. I restart.\n3)Now Ubuntu loads throughly on standard more, with 3.0.0-12-generic-pae, but I lost dual-screen mode. Only one monitor gets recognized. I go to 'Additional Drivers' and see that my driver option wasn't activated(I tried them all, none gets activated except for the initial \"version 173\"). It seems Ubuntu falls back on something other than the proprietary driver and so it works.\nConclusion:\nIt would have been a happy ending if I used only one screen. But I'm still unhappy for I have no dual-mode screen.\nI might try brunopereira81's approach next.\n\nA: Which nvidia graphics card are you using? In case if you are using nvidia with optimus you have to install ironhide or bumblebee, normal procedure doesn't work if its a case of optimus. Refer the following link \nhttp://www.cmdematos.com/2011/10/ubuntu-1110-oneric-on-dell-xps17-l702x.html\nIts for dell xps but it should work for all optimus supported models\n", "Q: Why did show desktop icon go away and how do I get it back? \nPossible Duplicate:\nIs there a Unity equivalent of the GNOME panel 'show desktop' applet? \n\nSo first the rant..\nI don't understand how you can release an operating system without a show desktop icon installed by default. It is extremely annoying to a lot of users, especially new Ubuntu adopters. I honestly hadn't noticed since I use the keyboard shortcut (which also keeps being switched between super+D and alt+ctrl+D) but people I have convinced to use ubuntu are really pissed off since they have to minimize all the windows to access the desktop - and I can understand them. And no, they are not interested in keyboard shortcuts they will not remember.\nThat being said the worst thing seems to be there is no fix for this that I can find! Webupd8 posted the following post. The solution that's suggested there is quite frankly worse than nothing for people without the ability to middle click (many mice/keyboard doesn't have a middle button). I was so frustrated with it I deleted it after a few days. It's not only the 10 second wait, even after waiting it doesn't work properly.\nAny ideas on how to win this confidence back from new Ubuntu users?\n\nA: If you press Alt+Tab under 11.10, Show desktop is the leftmost icon. If you don't want to press Alt+Shift+Tab to go backwards, you can release Tab and use the arrow keys while still holding Alt.\n\nA: As is noted by ImaginaryRobots on Is there a Unity equivalent of the GNOME panel 'show desktop' applet?, a 'Show desktop' icon is shown when pressing (and holding) Alt+Tab. Surely, anybody knows that key combination? Of course, if the user isn't used to that key combination, he/she will have a hard time then holding Alt and keep pressing Tab until 'Show Desktop' is highlighted.\nSo I agree that it's at least awkward that such a simple icon has been removed AND that the key combination Super+D has been replaced.

Thanks in advance. First off I'm using a Vaio Z series Laptop, 2.4 GHZ, 4 GB DDR3 RAM. I am on Ubuntu 11.04 64-bit at the moment. The problem started when I did a clean install of 11.10. I encountered multiple bugs including the one I'm going to describe below. I went back to 11.04 and some how I have the same bug in 11.04 as well now. I did NOT have this bug before. \nBasically, when I connect my android phone to the computer and try to transfer music to it via a USB cable in rhythmbox, the transfers are extremely slow and after awhile it crashes and I get errors. My phones SD card is unmounted and unable to mount again till I yank the battery out. dmesg gives me the following output.\n    [   14.103288] usbcore: registered new interface driver qcserial\n    [   46.080145] usb 2-1: new high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 3\n    [   46.795743] usbcore: registered new interface driver uas\n    [   46.830958] Initializing USB Mass Storage driver...\n    [   46.831135] scsi6 : usb-storage 2-1:1.0\n    [   46.831758] usbcore: registered new interface driver usb-storage\n    [   46.831760] USB Mass Storage support registered.\n    [   68.119351] usb 2-1: USB disconnect, address 3\n    [   68.900055] usb 2-1: new high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 4\n    [   69.065239] scsi7 : usb-storage 2-1:1.0\n    [  329.240062] usb 2-1: reset high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 4\n    [  339.570085] usb 2-1: reset high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 4\n    [  355.900067] usb 2-1: reset high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 4\n    [  356.240041] usb 2-1: reset high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 4\n    [  366.570066] usb 2-1: reset high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 4\n    [  401.750816] usb 2-1: USB disconnect, address 4\n\nI thought maybe there was something wrong with my SD card so I bought a new 16 GB class 4 card but the same problem occurs. If I use the MicroSD with an adapter in the card reader the transfer speeds start off at 20 mb and then slow down to 1 mb.\nI don't know what to do. I searched all over the Ubuntu forums but didn't come up with any solutions. I can confirm that I didn't have this problem before. Did an update break something? Is my ECHI driver broken due to an update? Is this a hardware problem? If its a kernel issue how come it wasn't there before but only appeared after i went to 11.10 and then back to 11.04. Thanks for all your help guys.\n\nA: If you really did not experience the problem before, it may be either a problem with the updated kernel or a hardware problem (with either the USB controller or the phone). \nThe first one seems unlikely to me, but you can check whether this is the case by downgrading your kernel to the version you had before in 11.04 ; for the second suggestion, check the following link : \nhttp://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Problem_with_USB_2.0 . \nBasically there is a good chance you'll be still able to use the USB connection if you'll drop down the USB 2.0 support, although it will give you the painful 12 mbit/sec, i.e about one Mb per second ; but it would probably be rather stable. If the phone is the only device that brings you the problem, I would have simply stayed with USB 1.* for it. \nAnother hypothesis would be that you have earlier used a 32-bit version of Ubuntu 11.04 and the bug appeared when you have switched to a 64-bit version . \nThen I suggest you to try a 32-bit LiveCD and see if the problem persists .  \nPS. Here is an article explaining the procedure of unbinding the driver ( the spam protection engine prevents me from giving more links at once ) ) :  \nhttp://lwn.net/Articles/143397/ \n", "Q: How do I replace the breadcumbs and replace with the full text path?

I have gnome-tweak-tools installed, CCSM is configured to work well with Unity, and I have tried each the three built-in Unity themes.\nMy problem is that when I change the theme, only the window border changes. The icons don't change (on the panel and otherwise), Nautilus still looks ugly, scroll-bars don't change, etc. Everything looks very plain, boxy, and Windows 98-like. I didn't have any of these problems with Ubuntu 11.04 (of course I wasn't using Unity then).\n\n\nA: My answer to this exact same problem was to create a new user account and them move over none system files, then to carefully replace any . files.\nThe issue is caused by Nautilus or the setting daemon crashing during logon and then nautilus cannot ever get a path to the required theme.\nThere is a file in your user directory that is causing the problem.\nNow that I have a working platform I'll do a trial and error search to see if I can find the offending file.\n\nA: It is mostly because gnome-settings-daemon is not running.\nCan you make sure that your have the latest version of this package.

Is there any way to keep messaging services (IM - Pidgin, mail client - Thunderbird) running \"on background\"? I want to have them waiting for incoming messages but they disturb me when switching between applications using alt-tab. Anyway, I access those programs by clicking on the envelope indicatior in the toolbar so I don't need to see them in the list of running apps. My desire is the behavior just like with Banshee or Empathy.\nI don't want the solutions like AllTray since the applications already have their \"tray\" in the envelope applet.\nEDIT: I have realized Pigin behaves like this. I don't know if it did before but now it's okay.

To do so with Thunderbird you have to perform following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Softwarecenter and install CompizConfig or use following command:\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager \n\n*Open CompizConfig-Setting-manager using the Dash or performing this command:\nccsm\n\n*Click on the left sidebar on »Windowmanager«\n\n\n*Now you can specify windows you don't like appearing in taskbar and the pager: For Thunderbird you type in the filed »Skip Taskbar« and »Skip Pager« the following: \nclass=Thunderbird\nTyping the same in the filed »not closable« you should have exactly the behaviour you want.\n\n\nA: EDIT 3: Thanks to @Mik and @Karthik How to emulate pressing the Close button from a script? we now have the best solution so far!!\nYou will need to install a Thunderbird extension:\n\n\n*\n\n*MinimizedToTray revived (MinTrayR) 1.1.2\n    \n*\n*To make Thunderbird minimize on messenger indicator on close and minimize go to addon's \"Preferences\" and check \"Instead of closing and when minimizing\"\n\n\nYou also need to install \"xdotool\" to properly run the script below:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install xdotool\nTo make Thunderbird start on system login and immediately minimize create the script below:\n\n\n*\n\n*\nCreate an \"Empty Document\" in your Documents directory, name it \"thunderbird_start.sh\".\n\n\n*Copy in it the following lines:\n    #!bin/bash\n\n    #wait for internet connection up to 15 seconds\n    host=google.com\n    CONNECTED=$(ping -w5 -c1 $host > /dev/null 2>&1 && echo \"up\" || echo \"down\")\n    STOPWATCH=0\n    while [ \"$CONNECTED\" = \"down\" ] && [ $STOPWATCH -lt 15 ]; do\n        sleep 1;\n        CONNECTED=$(ping -w5 -c1 $host > /dev/null 2>&1 && echo \"up\" || echo \"down\")\n        let STOPWATCH++\n    done\n\n    #run Thunderbird\n    thunderbird &\n\n    #Search for Thunderbird window\n    TB=$(xdotool search --class thunderbird)\n    while [ -z \"$TB\" ]; do\n        sleep 10 #Adjust this to your system needs\n        TB=$(xdotool search --class thunderbird)\n    done\n\n    #dispose Thunderbird window\n    xdotool search --class thunderbird windowunmap %@\n\n*I'm not very experienced in shell scripting so if there is any better implementation please let me know!\n\n\n*\nOpen \"Startup Applications\" and \"Add\" a new startup program.\n\n\n*\nIn the name field, give a name of your choice\n\n\n*\nIn the command field add the following line:\n\n    bash /home/your-name/Documents/thunderbird_start.sh\n\n*maybe you could also use \"~/\" to get your home directory, but I'm not sure if is gonna work, you can try it: sh ~/Documents/thunderbird_start.sh\n\n\n\nEDIT: MinimizedToTray officially does not support Unity so It breaks the global menu bar after restoring thunderbird.

I've added some lines to check for Internet connection so that sleep 10 is not needed any more... \nATTENTION in the 5th step sh was replaced with bash\nEDIT 5: There is still a sleep 10 command in the script. You should adjust the sleep time according to your system's speed. For example in my laptop I have an SSD, so Thunderbird opens fast, sleep 2 works perfect. In my desktop PC I had to add 10 seconds of sleep to make it work properly...

Based on the login menu options, I see “Ubuntu 2D” as an option and just “Ubuntu”; can I safely assume that “Ubuntu” is 3D ?\n\nA: The desktop you see when you first login to Ubuntu, is called Unity. It's a \"shell\" for Ubuntu. There are two parallel versions of Unity. One makes use of the hardware acceleration in modern graphics adapters in order to provide nice effects. (The dash is transparent in real-time, for instance, meaning that if you open it while you have a video open, then you can see the video through the dash. \nUbuntu 2D, which is really called Unity 2D, does the same things, but without requiring accelerated graphics in your graphics adapter. It still has nice effects, like a transparent dash, but it's not live. That is, they fake it by making a copy of the background and use that to give the illusion of transparency. It works quite well, and because it doesn't make so heavy use of advanced graphics, it's better suited for lower end PCs or computers that do not have hardware accelerated 3D. \nUnity is the main shell, used by default, but they're both nice. I'm currently using Unity 2D on a fairly strong computer, just because it's nice. :)\n\nA: Ubuntu here means the Unity interface with its launcher, panel etc. Unity relies on hardware accelerated graphics.\nThere are computers without hardware accelerated graphics, they cannot use nice visual effects.

And I want to use internet on my Android phone. \nSee following screenshot, I press the button but it just give the message that connection established and after that, it came into its original state.\nWhat network should I select in the combo?\nHow can I achieve this?\n\n\nA: It seems you want to use the internet connection of your computer on android phone. Hotspot button actually does not create a hotspot in ubuntu instead creates an ad-hoc.\n First of all as we all know stock rom of android i.e. the one which comes with the phone does not support ad-hoc mode (surprisingly), and even ice-cream sandwich (android 4.0) won't support ad-hoc mode. So, we need to create an access point (hotspot) using Ubuntu to which any android phone can easily connect. In windows you can use connectify to do that and it works perfectly well but with Ubuntu you may have certain problems, depending on whether your wifi-card supports access point mode (master mode) or not. Now, even if your wifi-card supports access point mode, the next problem is whether the driver of your wifi-card supports AP mode or not, if it does then the problem is solved and if does not then you have three options:\n1- Wait till the driver recieves an update for AP mode. (many wifi-card drivers are still in staging stage)\n2- Buy a wifi-dongle and make sure it supports AP mode on ubuntu.\n3- Use windows, where connectify will do the job for you.\nIf you are interested you can post the name of your wifi-card driver so that i can help you further. command: lshw -c network\n\nA: Since you use ath9k driver, you will be pleased to know that supports all the modes.

Even if Nautilus were functioning as it was, fstab isn't modified for runtime mounts, /etc/mtab is, which is sometimes a symlinked to /proc/mounts.\nIn examining gvfs behavior in 11.10 and 12.04, gvfs-mount -li doesn't seem to care at all for any fixed disks, it will list my cd-rw and that's it. This may have always been true, I haven't checked the changelogs.\nIt may be that this isn't gvfs related at all and volume mounting is enabled by Udisk, which will list every storage device in the system. That would indicate either that the data presented by Udisk has changed slightly which is then masking out your Logical Volumes, or Nautilus has changed the default policy somewhere and hid it in a code change or somewhere in the gconf registry.\nEither way I would consider this a regression and worthy of a bug report.\nI've always had a problem with storage \"desktop volume click-to-mount/hotplug-mount\" in Linux, the actual policy gets squirled away in the desktop implementation so every desktop gets to implement their own policy.

When I login on my Ubuntu system a script will mount a truecrypt container. To decrypt the container I have of course to enter the decryption password. But Truecrypt also asks for my \"administrator password\".

Do not circumvent it by allowing to run truecrypt as root without password, this is insecure as a malicious script can get elevated privileges by mounting a special-crafted container, and gain root privileges from it (e.g. setsuid binaries on in an ext2 filesystem or mounting on /).\n\nA: Here is a quick fix you can use:\nsudo visudo \n\nAdd the line <yourusername> ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/truecrypt and save the file. truecrypt wont ask for your admin password anymore for .

I am trying to understand this situation... Today I got a problem with de sudoers file since I modified and got problem whit this modification. So the only way to solve the problem was to modify the file using root in Recovery Mode.\nAnd there is where the problem start.... no password was asked at all... so, just by choosing 2 options (Recovery Mode in Grub and Root in Recovery Mode), I've got access to all my system and all his files as a root.\nThis is very dangerous ! Anyone could easily erase important files or simply broke the entire system without any password/password/....\nIs there any official communicate by Canonical about this ? It is simply an old forget feature or just something that no one want to change just because they don't want to ?\n\nA: It's not a bug, it's a feature. Anyone with physical access to the machine can get your data and/ or modify it unless your partitions are encrypted.\nConsider this case: you can boot a Live CD and be able to read and modify data without issues.\nAnother one: someone could open the case, take the disk out of it and plug it in another machine (USB dock, eSATA, etc.). Then it's again easy to read and modify the data.\nIf you want to disable creation of the recovery entry, edit /etc/default/grub, uncomment the GRUB_DISABLE_RECOVERY=\"true\" line by removing the leading # character and run sudo update-grub. However, this does not make it impossible to boot into recovery mode since you can still edit the boot options by pressing E on an entry and add single to the kernel line.\nThe only way to protect against such an attack is by encrypting your whole disk using LUKS. I strongly recommend to do that especially for mobile devices such as a notebook. See How to truly secure a hard-drive?\n\nA: Considering this is an old topic, being able to go into Recovery Mode & rooting saved my Desktop multiple times from crashes, corrupted driver installs (gpu) or any other problems where my desktop environment just wouldn't load at all.\nI understand your concern, but you are overthinking it.\nLike others in this topic said, anyone with physical access to the PC can do anything with it just by simply using an USB with ubuntu installed on it and they can access everything that's not encrypted.\nImagine other circumstances for example, a company had to lay off a system administrator, what if he changed passwords without telling the management about it and suddenly your new system administrator has no access to the entire system because the password has been changed and the person who did it is not responding.\n(It's hypothetical but very much possible and yes it does happen!)\nThere is probably SOME way to do this, I am not aware of one though, but considering all the factors, it is very much not necessary.\nPoint being, if you want to keep your files save, encrypt them and restrict physical access to the PC to only necessary administrators.\nMost regular \"newbies\" to Linux probably wouldn't even know what to do with it, and if they did, you will probably find out if something doesn't work anymore or whatever and appropriate actions should be taken against that person.\nI hope this answer helps others who come here.\n", "Q: Where are theme customizations in 11.10? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I change the theme? \n\nI upgraded, and now I need to tweak my fonts for the Ambiance theme - and I can't find anyplace to do it - in fact, the whole preview dialog for themes is gone - I'm not sure why they did that, but it'd be nice of them to put it back.\n\nA: Open a terminal and run the command:\nsudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool\n\n...then look for Advanced settings to run it.\nhttp://www.installubuntulinux.com/2011/09/howto-change-system-font-sizes-in.html\n\nA: use gnome tweek and dconf editor to change themes and stuff\n", "Q: Is it possible to burn a 64-bit Ubuntu Live CD on a 32-bit computer? My wife has been using Windows Vista on her computer, and it has finally borked bad enough that she is willing to try Ubuntu. The system is pretty much unbootable as far as I can tell, and I need to download and burn an ISO image of the 64-bit version of Oneiric Ocelot (11.10) for her. Can I do this from my 32-bit machine?\n\nA: You can download the 64bit ISO and burn it to a disc using the 32bit machine :)\nBut once burnt, the disc will only be bootable on 64bit machines.\n\nA: The bit version of the CD or DVD does not matter where you burn it. You can even burn a PC version of the 32 Bit or 64 Bit on a Mac. Same for windows and same if you are burning a 32 bit on a 64 Bit PC or vice versa.\nWhat does matter is if you want to run it afterwards. Is it recommended to download the 64 Bit version if you have a lot of ram and the whole architecture is 64 Bit ONLY. This changes if it is one of those 32 Bit and 64 Bit architectures that support both.\nIt is also not necessary to run a 64 Bit on a PC that supports both, 32 Bit and 64 Bit but has 4GB or less of ram. The performance will not be any better if you use the 64 Bit. Stick with the 32 Bit for more compatibility in that case.\nSo in any case, don't worry about where you burn what type of CD/DVD.\n\nA: Of course you can. The ISO image is a file.\nThe difference between 32-bit and 64-bit is a reference to the size of each instruction the computer processor can process. The wider the word or instruction the greater the information that the CPU can process at each clock tick.\nBy the way, there is backwards compatibility at the moment. A 32-bit operating system will run on a 64-bit CPU. I have done it. On the other hand a 64-bit OS will not run on a 32-bit CPU. The processor could not read the instructions. They are twice as wide as the instructions for a 32-bit CPU.\nA CD will play in a DVD drive, but a DVD will not play in a CD drive. That is what could cause a problem, but I do not think that you have to worry about it.\nIt does not matter whether the OS burning the CD image is 32-bit or 64-bit. Any more than it would matter if you were wanting to copy music tracks from one machine to another. Likewise, they are files.\nBurn the ISO image to disk, and put it in your wife's machine and boot. See what happens.\n\nA: Yes, you can burn the CD on any computer that is capable of burning CDs no matter what architecture or operating system.\n\nA: The same is true of Live USBs, by the way. You can use the ISO file of the 64bit installer on a 32 bit machine to make a 64 bit live usb. So if said computer can boot from a flash drive, the greener/cheeper option would be to turn a USB flash into a startup disk for a short while, either with Ubuntu's own Startup Disk Creator, or with Unetbootin.\n", "Q: Is there any way to specify which workspace and/or window to launch a program into? I asked a related, but more specific, question here. I want to know if there is a way to specify where you want a program to launch.

In principle it is simple, specify the window, and move it. But specifying windows is not easy, two browsers are both named the same \"Google Chrome\". One can use their unique window IDs, but getting this information is not trivial (AFAIK, this is not returned upon execution). Then there is an :ACTIVE: option which is the most recently launched program, but there is no guarantee that the window is launched when control is returned to the command line. To make matters worse, one must specify global coordinates, as opposed to optional coordinates within a workspace/monitor.\n\nHere is the approach I am currently taking. I have uploaded some scripts to GitHub (see here or here) which use wmctrl to move windows around.\n\nA: You can determine which display to launch a program by using the following:\n$ DISPLAY=\":0.1\" program_name\n\nSome programs allow you to set their default display in a config file.  mplayer is one of these programs.  Append the following to ~/.mplayer/config\n\ndisplay=\":0.1\"\n\nYour first display is 0.0.  Your second display is 0.1.  Your third display is 0.2.\n\nA: You can set which workspace a program launches to by GUI by installing CompizConfig Settings Manager from the Software Center.\nFirst, open an instance of the program you wish to place.\nRun CCSM and go to \"Window Management\", and active \"Place Windows\", click it and choose the \"Fixed Window Placement\".\nUnder \"Windows with fixed viewport\", click New. In the dialog that appears, click the \"+\" button. Then in the next dialog, click the \"Grab\" button, and then click the launched program and the \"Add\". Then set the values for the viewports: \nX=1, Y=1 is top left, \nX=1, Y=2 is bottom left,\nX=2, Y=1 is top right,\nX=2, Y=2 is bottom right.\nIf you do nothing else, this will set it for window class, but there are other options, such as ID, Type and more, but ID is the only one you cannot grab.\n\nA: I implemented a small python script that launches and places windows to workspaces. It relies on wmctrl. My solution to the problem is to customize the function that looks for the window ID. It can be PID-based or title-based. What I also do is that I record the currently opened windows and only check for new ones. But I always combine it with title/pid search. Also, when using title, I immediately change it so it does not clash with the next window of the same application.\nWhat I find useful is to write a small script for the apps that need more sophisticated treatment.\nI plan to eventually add the different displays support.\nYou can check it on https://github.com/xblahoud/Launch-on-workspace\n", "Q: How to set up Gnome-Shell as the default DE? \nPossible Duplicate:\nLogin screen doesn't remember my choice of desktop enviroment \n\nPretty all in the question.

Bad news is sounds like you found a bug.  Good news is since Sandy Bridge is still new, bug reports on it tend to get high priority from Intel (if they're well written).\nEasiest thing to do is file a bug report ('ubuntu-bug xorg').  If you don't get a reply within a few days give me a ping.\nIf you do want to solve the problem via getting a new video card, I typically recommend AMD Radeon cards these days.  R500 have been very well debugged, but the R600/R700 cards are quite good and probably easier to find in stores.  If you go with R600 or newer you have the choice of two drivers - open source -ati, or proprietary -fglrx.  A comprehensive listing of features supported by the various radeon chips is at:  http://www.x.org/wiki/RadeonFeature\n", "Q: Missing Dropbox icon overlays after upgrade from 11.04 to 11.10 The upgrade went smoothly, Dropbox is working (i.e. it is syncing files), but the icon overlays aren't appearing no matter if I use Unity, Unity 2D or GNOME Shell.\nIs there any setting that can fix this?\nIs there a new version of the Dropbox extension for Oneiric?\n\nA: Found the following post on the dropbox forums, so two things to try (I can confirm it is working on my computer with nautilus-dropbox 0.6.8-1).  \n1) Downgrade to nautilus-dropbox 0.6.8-1 if running a newer version.\n2) Try running the following commands if on the newer version:\n    sudo ln -s /usr/lib/nautilus/extensions-2.0/libnautilus-dropbox.a /usr/lib/nautilus/extensions-3.0/libnautilus-dropbox.a  \n    sudo ln -s /usr/lib/nautilus/extensions-2.0/libnautilus-dropbox.la /usr/lib/nautilus/extensions-3.0/libnautilus-dropbox.la  \n    sudo ln -s /usr/lib/nautilus/extensions-2.0/libnautilus-dropbox.so /usr/lib/nautilus/extensions-3.0/libnautilus-dropbox.so\n\n\nA: According to this blog post, nautilus-dropbox already has GTK+3 support.

I have a NAS which I use for saving files from computers. When I save files to NAS everything works ok but when I try to recover files from NAS to the computer everything goes wrong.\nUsing Ubuntu 9.04 and 9.10 it works properly, but from 10.04 on it stops working and you can't take the files from the NAS. \n\nA: My guess, based on the little information in your post, is that this is a permissions problem. If you are using NFS to access the NAS from ubuntu, permissions are managed using numeric user identifiers. The NAS tracks these, the client (your desktop) translates the numbers into user names.\nMost likely, between the different versions, the user name you are using got assigned a different UID. Probably, it used to be 1000, now it is 1001. (Unless running off a live CD means you are root all the time?)\nAs a first step to debugging, how are you accessing the NAS, and can you do an ls -l of the problem files?

I use the bios to switch OS at boot time.\nI have tried a couple times to get them both in Grub2 but for some reason had to reinstall Win8 the first time and restore ubuntu the second time. No idea what happened to Windows but I screwed up the syntax in Grub2 the second time and could not edit anything with the CD.\nI've seen different versions of the grub.d file to add the windows entry.\n\nA: I have installed Windows 8 together with Ubuntu 11.10 on one hard drive in my laptop and it works fine, just as it did before with Windows 7.\nMy drive is partitioned like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Partition 1: Swap\n\n*Partition 2: Ubuntu\n\n*Partition 3: Home\n\n*Partition 4: Windows\n\n\nThis layout has already 4 primary partitions, so the Windows installer can't do its default 2 partition install. That default 2 partition installation of Windows might be why you can't setup a proper chainloader entry in grub for Windows easily. This has been an issue at least since Windows 7 I think. I remember that there is a workaround which involves copying some files from  Windows' boot partition to the root of the Windows partition or the boot folder, but you should instead reinstall Windows with only one partition. I just had to reinstall grub afterwards from the live CD with the following commands:\nsudo mount $Ubuntu_Partition /mnt/\nsudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt/ /dev/sdX\nsudo update-grub\n\n$Ubuntu_Partition is your Ubuntu partition. If you have a boot partition you need to mount that too (to /mnt/boot).\nsdX is the harddrive where Ubutntu is installed on. Use commands like fdisk -l to find out where Ubuntu is installed.\nBack in Ubuntu run sudo update-grub again OS prober should have found something like \"Windows Recovery Environment\". That's my experience installing the Consumer Preview of Windows 8. Using a separate drive should not be any different, since the OS prober scans all attached drives, it just seems to have difficulties with the 2 partition default layout.

What steps do I take to trace down issues? I'm primarily a windows/web developer with at best a tenuous understanding of Unix.\n\nA: There is (Most times) a problem called memory leak in programs. Browsers like Chrome, Opera, IE, Firefox and others are known for this (Firefox was the king of it until recent versions). Leaving Chrome/Chromium, even without doing anything on them after checking several pages will slowly start to increase the memory usage for \"no apparent recent\". The memory leak increases or has a bigger chance to increase (And increase faster) if the application you use uses more memory. In your case you have also Virtualbox and even if I set virtualbox to a guest of 1GB, about 30 minutes later you will see that the 1GB just went to 1.2GB,  then 1.4GB and so on. This is just common bugs that need fixing. The same goes for Nautilus and any other app that has a lot of activity.\nWould be nice to know how long you had them opened. If it is less than an hour then there might be something really wrong there but if it is more then am sorry but it is something I have adapted to. Normally I close virtualbox every so often.

I would recommend not using the repositories, but just downloading it from eclipse.org, extracting it to somewhere in your home directory and creating a launcher for it.\n\n\n*\n\n*It has its own updater\n\n*You can blissfully ignore the plugins in the repos too. Downloaded everything from within Eclipse and you'll be fine.\n\n*You control what version you're running. If you need 3.6 you can have it.\n\n\nAs for Tomcat, just install the tomcat7 package.\n\nA: I was searching for a similar question, however the next step after installing which was given by Sergey is configuring eclipse and tomcat to work together.\nThis Stackoverflow response works even with tomcat7 so I thought it will be useful for anyone else who looking for the answer for Ubuntu.\nOn thing to note is that when you install tomcat from the repositories, the service is started automatically, so when developing you may want to stop the server first using\nsudo service tomcat7 stop\n\n", "Q: Why doesn't Ubuntu have a strategy document? So why is Xubuntu the only one that has a strategy document? Why is there not one for Ubuntu, Ubuntu Server, Kubuntu, etc..? Does this mean that Xubuntu is the only one thinking about these things?\nXubuntu Strategy Document\n\nA: Though not quite a \"strategy\" document, the About Ubuntu page covers many of the beliefs of Ubuntu, mainly the story, the philosophy, Licensing and Governance, Code of Conduct, Leadership Diversity, and the relationship with Debian and derivatives.\n\nA: Ubuntu has an agile-driven development process: it pushes frequent releases, topic sprints, and short-term, highly-focused goals. This gives Ubuntu the ability to constantly adapt to a changing world; take a look at Unity, which in the space of six months refactored itself from a Netbook UI to a Desktop/Tablet UI.\nIn the consumer computing industry, players that failed to adopt agile principles have been consistently out-flanked and out-innovated (eg Mozilla, Microsoft) so I don't think that lacking a \"five year plan\" makes Ubuntu deficient.\nI suspect the inner circle at Canonical has rough long-term plans for Ubuntu.

My touchpad gets disabled while I use the computer, i.e. it doesn't go to sleep or anything - I just find the touchpad doesn't work anymore after an undetermined amount of time. I unticked the \"Disable while typing\" option, but that didn't fix it. I can't find a \"touchpad:touchpad\" option in gconf, but somehow I don't think that would help me, since the touchpad is very enabled until it gets disabled.\nI managed to get Google to tell me about synclient, and just earlier I re-enabled the touchpad using\nsynclient touchpadoff=0\n\nfrom the terminal.\nBut I'd like not to do that.\nThere's no Fn-key combo for disabling the touchpad and this only started happening after upgrading to Oneiric.\nAny ideas what disables the touchpad so I can go poke it with a stick?\n\nA: I'm not sure thereis a clear reason why yet, there could be some hardware specific difference involved here.\nMyself & several others have seen this disappear by disabling the option, though I guess for others it is non effectual.

I have the exact same problem as you, and in my case disabling and enabling of the touchpad through Fn key or the specific button works, but using the fn-key doesn't enable the touchpad again after it expectantly stops responding, but the commands you gave do enable it again...\nNot sure though if that is the actual cause of the problem...\n\nA: I've actually found the answer after a long time. There IS a Fn combo, but it's just not painted on the keyboard. Fn+C toggles the keypad. And I was pressing Fn+C in the dark instead of Ctrl+C, because someone who designs laptop keyboards for a living thought it would be alright to put the Fn key where the Ctrl key normally is.\nSo in the end it's not a Ubuntu bug.

I ran (in a terminal):\ndconf write /org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/video-out ''\ndconf write /org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/screenshot ''\n\nBefore, I searched with the next bash commands for values that contained '<Super>p':\nb=\"/org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/\"\nfor i in `dconf list $b | sort`; do echo -n \"$i: \"; dconf read $b$i; done\n\nTo search all dconf keys, use the command:\ndconf dump / | grep '<Super>p'\n\nIf you want to avoid the terminal, run the program dconf-editor and search for the key(s) there...\nEdit:\nAfter some upgrades and restarts, I had the keybinding not working any more.

A bug fix for this seemed to be in the works so that at least there is an easier way to re-configure the key bindings, but it has since been marked invalid because this was supposedly fixed in gnome-settings-daemon.\nUltimately this problem is supposedly due to some hardware vendors hard-coding video out to Super-P.\nThere have been updated conversations on the bug tracker since the currently-accepted answer that suggest not turning off xrandr, but instead turning off media-keys:\nTry the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the dconf-tools package, and then run dconf-editor.\n\n*In the tree on the left, navigate org -> gnome -> settings-daemon -> plugins -> media-keys.\n\n*Uncheck the active checkbox.\n\n\nOr the command-line version of this is:\ndconf write /org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/active false\n\nA: On Ubuntu 18.04, I found two different keybindings for SUPER+P, which can be disabled with dconf-editor.\nFirst, you need to install dconf-editor, if it's not already installed.

You make a hidden folder by giving it a name that starts with a period (.) For example: .mystuff\nYou can see these folders by pressing ctrl+H, or by going to View > Show hidden files in the Nautilus menu. (I guess those are the words in English)\nGnome shouldn't display the content in those folders.\n\nA: There DOES need to be an easy method of doing PRECISELY this.\nI review 'questionable' content, as part of my job (information security).\nI see NO need for a graphic sneak-peak for all RECENT image files, or even ALL recent files.\nTHIS should actually be a opt-in application, with ONLY this folders (and sub-folders) indexed and presented.  This should also provide multiple contexts.  eg. development, home/private, business.\nIf we are still allowing to organize their folders and files, then we need to be able to control how these files are accessed or remembered.\nI adapted a solution from the other posted question:\nHow can I keep recent files from appearing in Unity?\n\nA: You can configure from which sources \"Zeitgeist\", Ubuntu's activity tracker (inherited from Gnome), tracks events with Activity Log Manager (install with Apt).\n\nIt let's you\n\n*\n\n*disable the tracking of certain object types,\n\n*disable the tracking of object sources by folder,\n\n*delete tracks collected most recently, during a certain time frame, or altogether.\n\n\nA: I'm fairly sure that installing ActivityLogManager and persuading it not to index specific files (you may have to delete the existing index) will stop any files showing up in the search. Seems to work for me, but I don't remember the precise detail of what I did. Check that activity log has no entries, check ActivityLogManager is not keeping track, and see if the problem is still there.\n\nA: I think the most prudent action to take would be to follow the steps listed below.\n\n\n*\n\n*Rename the directory to something non-erotic\n\n*Change the permissions on the folder so only root can actually read the files. This is done with the following command:\nsudo chmod -r /path/to/folder\n\nThat way the files inside won't be even readable by the indexer. However, it would be useful to find out how to flush the current index cache.\nNeedless to say, to access the files you will need to run whatever application you use to open them with root priviledges (i.e. with sudo appname /path/to/file), which should be considered as a plus.\nNot that I have done this, I don't see a need in downloading such sort of content.\n", "Q: Does CCSM work with Gnome-shell? I recently upgraded my Ubuntu 11.04 to 11.10 and now that gnome-shell is \"safe\" to install, I thought I'd give it another go.\nAfter a small driver issue, gnome-shell is working great!\nI am a big fan of the compiz \"Grid\" plugin - specifically the alt+ctrl+kp_* bindings.\nAccording to ccsm, they are set, but they do not work. Dragging windows to the sides work, but the keyboard shortcuts do not.  Then I realised that none of the changes I make via CCSM are taking effect!\nDoes this mean gnome-shell does not work with CCSM or is this just something wrong with my system?  \nAny ideas on how I can make this work again?\n\nA: CCSM (short for CompizConfig Settings Manager) lets you configure the settings of Compiz. Unity is a plugin of Compiz whereas gnome-shell is a plugin of mutter. That's why changes made using CCSM doesn't have any effect on gnome-shell. \nIf you want to customize gnome-shell, you can try gnome-tweak-tool . To install it, search for 'gnome-tweak-tool' in the software center or by running this command in a terminal: sudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool\nYou can also try the gnome-shell extensions that let you customize the various features of gnome-shell. To try out these extensions, visit the official gnome-shell extensions site.  \n\nA: This shell extension seems to do the trick. Put Window:\nhttps://extensions.gnome.org/extension/39/put-windows/\n\nA: Gnome shell does provide A convenient way to edit keyboard shortcuts - in System Settings -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts.\n\nA: I found this neat script gnome-shell-grid It seems to work well, atleast with a single monitor setup.

For reason(s) yet unknown, the Session Indicator has disappeared from my Unity Panel (ver. 11.10.)  Short of reinstalling, is there a way the Session Indicator can be restored, perhaps through a command issued to gsettings? (I'm new to Ubuntu and still learning.) \nAny thoughts would be greatly appreciated.     \n\nA: You can alter the settings related to indicator-session using dconf-editor. To install dconf-editor, search for dconf tool in the software center or run this command in the terminal: \nsudo apt-get install dconf-tools\n\nIn dconf-tools, you can configure the indicator-session as you wish.\n\n\nA: Try this - \nRight click in the desktop screen > Change Desktop Background\nAt the bottom is a dropdown for Theme, switch from your current selection to something else & then back again, ie. - from Ambiance to Radiance, back to Ambiance\n", "Q: How do I install Pencil?

I recently installed a fresh install of Ubuntu 11.10 64-bit on my notebook. \nI personally prefer Rhythmbox over Banshee so I searched for and installed it from the Ubuntu Software Center. (including all plugins that were listed). Unlike previous versions of Ubuntu (11.04, 10.10, etc..) the (previous, play/pause, next) controls have been removed from the sound menu. Rhythmbox is still listed (above \"Sound Settings...\") but when clicked all it does is open the application. To add insult to injury the Banshee controls are displayed right above it - even though that application isn't running.\n\n\n*\n\n*I have tried opening Rhythmbox from the Unity dashboard, the Unity launcher, and the sound menu with the same results.\n\n*I've also verified that I had rhythmbox-plugins installed.\n\n*I even tried to remove and install the application. Still no controls. \nIt looks like they were removed and that we are now expected to use Banshee. Why?\nHere is a screenshot of what my sound menu looks like when I'm playing a file in Rhythmbox. (Notice that Banshee isn't running but it's controls are displayed) In Ubuntu 10.10 and 11.04 Rhythmbox had controls just like Banshee's controls in the screenshot.\n\n\nA: As jnv stated there should be rhythmbox-plugins package installed and MPRIS D-Bus interface plugin enabled in rhythmbox.\n\nA: Easy fix here!  Open up your terminal and type dconf-editor which will look like the screen image provided above in the previous thread by jokerdino.  Click on apps then indicators then sound.  The First option on the right is blacklisted-media-players.  Inside those brackets type 'rhythmbox' to remove. You can type 'rhythmbox','banshee' if you want to remove both.  This will completely remove all instances of either one showing up in sound menu on your status bar but does not effect functionality whatsoever.\n", "Q: Can a Gnome2 like interface be built upon the new Gnome3 code? As far as I understand, both Unity and the new Gnome Shell are both running on new Gnome\ncode base. There's some name confusion because talking about Gnome seems to refer to both the code underneath and the shell. Just to be clear, I'll use Gnome3-Code and Gnome3-Shell to separate out the code from the UI.\nNow, if I have that straight, the new Gnome3-Code is a serious improvement over the old Gnome2-Code. I can actually tell that it is significantly more responsive and I presume more stable and rational. So that's good.\nAnd, if I'm right about all this, Unity and Gnome-Desktop are both just shells on top of the new Gnome3-Code. It's on the shell layer that (questionable) decisions, like having a \"launcher\" that can only be on the left side, are made.\nSo my question is this: Would it not be possible to use the new Gnome3-Code and make a new shell that is basically the same UI as the Gnome2-Shell?\nAren't all the UI level decisions essentially arbitrary? Is there some reason why you couldn't have panels and Compiz effects and all that jazz?\nI notice that Gnome3-shell is not compatible with Compiz, but Unity is. So, surely it would be possible to make a shell that recreated Gnome2-shell.\nOf course, I have absolutely no coding expertise in this area whatsoever. But is there a place or a way I can plant the seed of suggesting that someone fork a Gnome2-shell for Gnome3-code?\nFrom what I have seen, while Gnome3-Shell and Unity have their supports, it seems to me the base of that support comes mainly from people close to the project, and the dislike for Unity and Gnome3-shell is pretty significant. I bet if someone went in the direction of a new Gnome2-like-shell, it would soon become a de-facto standard.\n\nA: Absolutely! Check out gnome-session-fallback in the Software Centre, which gives you a Gnome Classic login session with Gnome Panel 3 and Metacity. (As before, you can swap Metacity for Compiz if you are so inclined). (see here: How to revert to GNOME Classic Desktop? )\nAs well as using the new Gnome libraries, Gnome Panel 3 is changed from the last version of Gnome Panel 2:\n\n\n*\n\n*There is a new panel applet library that panel applets must use.\n(I think it was introduced in the last version of Gnome 2).\n\n*Applets are positioned relative to each other instead of in absolute\nscreen coordinates. This fixes a long-standing bug where applets\nwould be jumbled after changing screen resolution.\n\n*To edit a panel, you must hold Alt and right click. This makes it a\nlittle harder for people to accidentally break the panel. (And, of\ncourse, harder to edit the panel if you don't know the trick).\n\n*The Main Menu applet has the Applications and System sections\ncombined, to be a little more consistent with Gnome Shell.\nOther than that, it really is the same panel as before, with a lot of the same applets as before. The ones that aren't there just need to be updated.\n", "Q: Remove Epiphany 3.2 after installing it from a PPA?

You can safely remove the ppa as per Dylan's instructions.\nTo uninstall epiphany, click here and click on Remove in the opened Software Center. \nYou can safely uninstall epiphany even if you leave the PPA enabled, ie you don't need to install ppa-purge at all.\nUpdate: To remove it, you can just add the PPA, and go to software center to remove it easily.

My notebook has a widescreen display so vertical space is an absolute premium for me. When I installed Ubuntu 11.10 I was disappointed to see that a new icon confusingly named \"Dash Home\" had been added to the very top of the Unity launcher. I can't move it to the bottom (by dragging it) and it doesn't have a context menu with which to remove it (by unchecking \"Keep In Launcher\"). It's horrible. \nHow can I remove it from the Unity launcher and reclaim the space that was taken from me? (I realize that if it's removed I'll have to open the dashboard with the super key - I'm fine with that)\n\nA: I wasn't satisfied with the answers so I compared the 11.10 Unity-2D source with earlier versions. It can be done. Here's how to do it:\n(for 11.04/11.10)\ngksudo gedit /usr/share/unity-2d/launcher/Launcher.qml\n\n(for 12.04)\ngksudo gedit /usr/share/unity-2d/shell/launcher/Launcher.qml\n\nScroll down until you find the following section:\n    Component.onCompleted: {\n        items.appendModel(bfbModel);\n        items.appendModel(applications);\n        items.appendModel(workspaces);\n        items.appendModel(devices);\n        shelfItems.appendModel(trashes);\n    }\n\nitems.appendModel(bfbModel); is the offending line of code. Remove this line (or comment it out). Save your changes and close the file.\nRestart Unity-2D with:\nkillall unity-2d-launcher\n\n(12.04)\nkillall unity-2d-shell\n\nLet's hope someone adds a way to toggle this feature in the upcoming Unity settings manager. Cheers!\n\nA: As far as I know, you can't remove it. I don't see whats the big deal, though. In 11.04 there were buttons for the Applications and Files lenses; those have been integrated to the Dash itself in 11.10, so one button has been added but two are gone. Perhaps you should remove some of the apps that are pinned by default? You can literally have only the dash launcher, the workspace switcher and the trash if you want to.\nAlternatively, install ccsm and go to the Unity plugin settings, you can make the icons in the launcher as small as 16px for maximum screen real estate.\n\nA: You cannot remove it as it is a part of the Unity Launcher code, Mark Shuttleworth explained the reasons behind the Dash icon and the Launcher in his blog post here.\n", "Q: Problems with using themes in Geany I'm trying to switch to the Geany editor for my web development but need to switch to a dark theme.

When I click this icon the dashboard expands to full screen. Great! It looks good and doesn't feel so cramped on my display..\nHowever when I close the dashboard and re-open it again (to find a file or program) it always reverts back to non-fullscreen. I have to open the dashboard and and constantly click that fullscreen button in the bottom right - it's really annoying.\nOnce I've indicated my preference shouldn't the dashboard remember what that preference was? That's how the dashboard's \"Filter Results\" works - if I expand it and re-open the dashboard it stays expanded. Why are these two behaviors not consistent?\nIf I'm not suppose to make the dashboard full screen then why even include the button to expand it to full screen if it' only going to revert back?\n\nA: My dash, on ubuntu 11.10, do now have any bottom-right expand button. It is in the top left corner, over the launcher, as you can see in this image:\n\nClicking on full screen button keeps the dash in full screen for any following openings.\n\nA: Since your question starts with a 'why', I guess the answer is: because the designers thought it would be a good idea to have a dash that only covers a certain part of the screen for large displays. Why they though that is a good idea? No clue.\nIf you ask \"how\" to open always in fullscreen, then your question is a duplicate of e.g. How do I make the Dash open up fullscreen in 2D?\n\nA: The reason is that drawing the entire screen is more work than only drawing what's necessary. There's no reason why you shouldn't be able to choose to always have it draw full screen, as long as you can easily change it back, so I guess that'll be possible in the next version.

These get you the full GNOME3 desktop, a lighter weight version of GNOME, or a look-alike GNOME2 respectively. The last one gives you versions with and without effects.  Each one of those gnome options is based on gnome 3, no matter what they look like.  If you want the real gnome2, then install Mate.  It is a fork of gnome2 by Linux Mint.  If you want a classic gnome2 look, but based on gnome3 code that isn't gnome-session-fallback, you can also install Cinnamon from Linux Mint .  \n\nA: You can use :\nsudo aptitude install --without-install-recommends ubuntu-desktop\n\nor \nsudo aptitude install --without-recommends ubuntu-desktop\n\nfor smaller package to download. \n\nA: I found this helpful:\nsudo apt-get install xorg gnome-core gnome-system-tools gnome-app-install\n\nFor refer - minimal-gnome\n", "Q: Follow a .lnk with samba I'm trying to access some file on my company's local network.

Could someone please tell me what it is?\n\nA: The definitive guide is the community wiki (link below).\nBut in summary - GRUB_DEFAULT takes either a numeric or a string value.  Numeric values reflect the boot order options (menu entry values) described in /boot/grub/grub.cfg\nFor example - in my grub my GRUB_DEFAULT value is set to the value 6 (six):\n\nIf you look at /boot/grub/grub.cfg and count the lines starting with the the text menuentry where the first entry is zero, the second is one and so on you'll see that the value of six corresponds to what you see in the grub screen.\n\nN.B. I've truncated the file to just show lines starting with the text menuentry\nSetting by a string value is useful if you want to make windows the default boot.\nYou only make changes to GRUB_DEFAULT in the file /etc/default/grub\nIn both cases - run sudo update-grub to regenerate the file /boot/grub/grub.cfg - this is the file that grub itself uses but you should not change yourself.\n\nLinked Question:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I set Windows to boot as the default in the boot loader?\n\n*https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2\n\nA: I just had this and it still didn't work no matter how many times I tried variations...until I realized I had two /etc/default/grub files - one for each of my dual boot roots!

Also the updating cache messages are misleading - it says downloading 2 of 3 files, then 4 of 6 files, eventually 80 of 113 files - it feels like my computer is lying to me, and I have no idea how long it is going to take to check for the updates!!!\n\nA: FC, as technology continuosly progresses (hardware and software features) it makes it so much more complex to integrate everything. And then the rest of the shabang that makes it a rich and interactive experience. This obviously means more frequent tweaks and tunes and patching and innovating.\nAnd when your updates are coming from all over the place(custom repos), we can understand why Ubuntu's newer releases require so much more throughput from the other side.\nHaving said that, I have to agree with you. I am limited to 10GB per month and the bandwidth used by the update system adds up significantly.\nAreas of the world where household consumers don't have easy access to true broadband (eg. RSA) makes it more difficult to integrate the whole Ubuntu experience effeciently.\nTime & Cost used to be main advantages of Ubuntu, for me.\n--Discussion aside, i have a suggestion--\nIt's still very early for the latest release, but...\nHave a look at Linux Mint. Scroll down and have a look at their development team's update manager. I find it revolutionary. And my system tends to be MUCH more stable.\nIt's a linux distrobution directly based on fabulous Ubuntu :D\nGive it a try when the 11.10 based version releases.\n", "Q: How can I log shutdown console text?

Linux commands would be appreciated or even a guide on how to generally upgrade linux programs not using apt. Thanks!! \n\nA: As Redis 2.4 is not in the Repository for testing or unstable, you will need to compile it manually. Just uninstall the old version of Redis (via apt), and compile the new one. \nTry this to install Redis 2.4\nwget http://redis.googlecode.com/files/redis-2.4.0.tar.gz\ntar xzvf redis-2.4.0.tar.gz\ncd redis-2.4\nmake install\nmake test\n\n\nA: With the upcoming (slated for October 18th, 2012) release of the next Ubuntu version, Quantal Quetzal the redis-server package is getting upgraded to redis v2.4.15. \nIt is 3 minor patch versions behind the current stable redis release, but is still likely the best (ie. most supported) way to upgrade from v2.2 to v2.4.\n\nA: There are a few PPAs that seems to be tracking the latest redis, this one https://launchpad.net/~chris-lea/+archive/redis-server seems to have builds for most distributions.\nYou can install from it by running:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:chris-lea/redis-server\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install redis-server\n\nEdit: https://launchpad.net/~rwky/+archive/redis, now has redis 2.6 and 2.8\n", "Q: Rabbit VCS stopped working after upgrade to 11.10 Been using RabbitVCS for months now happily.

I'm new to ubuntu/debian being a gentoo user for many years, so please excuse my ignorance.\nI've just been informed of the release of 12.04 but when I review the package list I noticed an inconsistency. The Groovy language and groovy-doc is no longer supported by canonical and will be removed. However groovy-doc will also be upgraded.\nI only realise this because it's something of interest to me so I wouldn't have any idea about all the other areas of the system I don't know anything about. \nI feel I should wait some time for the release to have some problems ironed out before I continue with the upgrade. Is that a advised practice? \n\nA: 11.10 has just now been released, 12.04 is the planned one that is still being discussed (ie codename only came out a few days ago). You can not test 12.04 (should not, really).\nIf you are looking for pure stability use the LTS Ubuntu releases, if you want edge but without many issues use the current one -1, so use 11.04 for now. After a couple of weeks you can safely upgrade to the current one, 11.10. Not that it is not safe to install it now but there might be some edges that need perfection as you can understand.\nThere is a release of Ubuntu every 6 months, in April and in October, the versions start with the year+release month, ie: current one is 11.10, released in 2011, in October.\nThere is a release of Ubuntu LTS every 2 years with support for over 3 years, previous one was 10.04 and has support until 2013, next one will be 12.04.\n\nA: You must not upgrade to Precise Pangolin (12.04) unless you are going to develop it. Its development just started a few days ago, so it's extremely unstable. 11.10 is released, but as we all know, some bugs aren't discovered until after release, so if you're not in a hurry, you may choose to delay upgrade to 11.10. 11.04 is supported until October next year, so it's no rush. \nI've been using 11.10 for about six weeks, and it's come along nicely. There are a few issues still, though, particularly with regards to multiple screens. But all in all, it's good. I think newcomers to GNU/Linux should be recommended to use 10.04LTS, or wait for 12.04. With all the great changes going on, Ubuntu isn't as stable and polished as it usually is. \n\nA: Putting aside for now the obsolete versions mentioned here.\nFor stability it's recommended to wait for the first point release prior to upgrading.\n", "Q: Can't use two screens with an Nvidia 9600GT In an effort to learn more about Ubuntu, I downloaded and installed 11.10 onto my old workstation at home. We have a second workstation that runs Windows 7 too.

Since I moved my old audio files from a flash drive to the music folder, the music folder itself appears twice in the Dash, under the \"search files\".\nI know that it has something to do with the bookmarks of the Home Folder, since I had similar problem once, but the bookmarks are okay (Music folder shows only once there). I'm sure I don't have two music folders, so why are two folders, both linking to the same path, appearing side-by-side in Dash? How do I remove one of them?\n\nA: I had a folder I used often to store a bunch of documents. I decided to move it, and then add the new location to my shortcuts list in the file browser.

What happens with the source code? Does it get published or not?\n\n*What about a Python application?\n\nA: The source code is not published for commercial or proprietary apps submitted to My Apps. You choose an application to be commercial by specifying a price, and proprietary by choosing a non-open-source license.\nRegarding the Python question, my guess is that you're asking because Python app packages generally install the source files. You could distribute a bundle with the bytecode instead of the source files, but with the caveat that it can be decompiled. You could also try obfuscating the code, but while it seems that obfuscating Python code is not hard to do, also the efectiveness might be limited. You can learn more here, for example.\nIn any case, only users who have purchased your app will be able to access whatever it installs, but you should decide which type of license to use before submitting the app. You could even make it a commercial open source app!\n", "Q: Virtualize a Linux physical server I have an old proxy server\nuname -a:\n\nLinux proxy 2.6.18-6-686 SMP etc etc\n\nI think it's Debian (I have apt-get).\nI've read an interesting article to achieve the virtualization result:\nhttp://www.madgenius.com/blog/index....VM-server.html\nBut this server has different disks:\ndf -h:\n\nFilesystem Dimens.

I've tried to save and import in a new server I've prepared, getting only errors (iptables-save and then iptables-restore)\nI would like to do a perfect cloning of it and, if possible, virtualize it in a vmware esxi server.\nWhat path should I take?\n\nA: The first thing you should do, is to replace all the /dev/sdxx-es with UUIDs. Then you'll want to convert those disks to images. That's very easy: \ndd if=/dev/sda of=filename_for_sda.raw. DD stands for Carbon Copy, except that cc was in use by the C Compiler, so they used dd instead. ;) anyway, it takes an input file (if) and copies it to an output file (of). Do not confuse them. Do this for both of your disks, and you'll have a file called \"filename_for_sda.raw\" and \"filename_for_sdb.raw\". These are exact representations of the harddisk, including the boot sector, partition tables and everything. So, if you had two disks of the same size you wanted to clone, you could just do dd if=/old_disk/ of=/new_disk. \nNow that you have raw images for your disks, you should be able to just add them to most VM solutions and use them. You'll just need to configure it to boot from the correct disk. There are tools to create more fancy types of images, and they should support converting from raw images, as that's the most basic type of image you can get. \ndd will copy everything byte for byte, so if you have lots of empty space on the disks, it's not the most efficient solution. rsync might be a good option. \n", "Q: Can I configure the Unity launcher to appear on both of my monitors?

Right now this is being worked on and am sure for the 3.1 kernel version many fixes will be made regarding this. So for now give it some time for the work for this hardware to get to the kernel.

Then I went back and enabled a few I cared about like Desktop Wall which enables workspaces.\nI did notice that a few plugins reenabled themselves automatically after I disabled them (possibly because of some of the other plugins I had reenabled manually):  \n\n\n*\n\n*Window Decoration  \n\n*Move Window  \n\n*Resize Window\n\n\nIt might also be worth mentioning that the machine I did this on is running Ubuntu 10.10.\n", "Q: Squid proxy server (or iptables) will not let my users send or receive mail I have an Ubuntu 10.04 box that was once configured as Squid Transparent Proxy.\nNavigation was perfect: my windows clients had no troubles.\nThe problem I had was that users were not able send or receive mail using outlook (and outlook express).\nSo I've googled here and there and found out a solution:\nsudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -p TCP --dport 25 -j MASQUERADE\nsudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -p TCP --dport 110 -j MASQUERADE\nEverything went great.\nNow I've enabled squid authentication (the simple one using a text file) and my outlook and outlook express stopped working again.\nI've read that the problem is not really squid related because it won't proxy smtp or pop...\nBut I still need to solve it.\nNAT?

As far as I understand you're going to use the machine with squid as router/firewall for the following scenario:\n\n\n*\n\n*allow web protocols (http/ftp) through squid only\n\n*allow access to smpt/pop3 from your internal network to the outside via NAT.\n\n*Your gateway to the internet is 192.168.1.5\n\n\nUsually NAT translates from one Network (192.168.1.0/24) to another one (i.e. 84.145.77.23/32) and the other way around. So you might need to setup NAT rules on the your gateway machine 192.168.1.5 in order to work.\nSo that the outgoing path is:\nclient -> 192.168.1.210 ->NAT-> 192.168.1.5 ->NAT-> mailserver\n\nAnd the incoming path for responses is:\nmailserver -> 192.168.1.5 ->NAT-> 192.168.1.210 ->NAT-> client\n\nAs seen here 192.168.1.210 could be eliminated and the gateway could be configured accepting and NATing outgoing smtp/pop3 traffic from all clients and accepting outgoning http(s)/ftp traffic from 192.168.1.210 only.\nImho the second NAT between 192.168.1.210 and 192.168.1.5 might cause problems (same network) and is unnecessary.\nTo enable NAT in general on 192.168.1.210 please try the following first:\niptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE\n\nchange eth0 to your network interface name, if necessary.\n", "Q: Dell L501X Display Port Screen issue I got a Dell XPS L501X with a mini display port to VGA connector for my External Screen.\nOn Displays it shows me: Acer Technologies 24\" (which is the monitor) but only lets me up to 1024x768 resolution (The native resolution of this monitor is 1920x1200).\nI tried adding a new mode with xrandr, but when I applied it, it reverted back to 1024x768.\nAs far as I know, the display port is controlled by the Intel card, right?\nAny ideas or suggestions would be appreciated.\nThanks\nUsing Ubuntu 11.10 32bit\n\nA: You can add a new mode (I did this with l502x and it works for me)\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Config/Resolution#Adding_undetected_resolutions\nWhat I did to get 1600x1050:\n\n\n*\n\n*cvt 1600 1050\n\n*xrandr --newmode \"1600x1050_60.00\"  140.00  1600 1704 1872 2144  1050\n1053 1063 1089 -hsync +vsync\n\n*xrandr --addmode DP1 1600x1050\n\n*then Go to screen config and choose 1600x1050\n\n\nA: To follow the former answer, you can also use NewRez Script ( A script that uses the XRANDR utility for intel graphics). Download and instruction through here: http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2010/11/set-your-screen-resolution-higher-than-you-should-with-newrez/\nBut you should know that your problem comes likely from the cable itself.\nYou're trying to output a digital video stream to an analog port in your external monitor, then using a miniDP to VGA cable is legitimate. Yet, know that most VGA adapters are not capable of driving high resolutions, their maxiumum is often 1024x...\nSo even though, you use XRANDR to add a new mode and force it, this will not work unless you use a high quality VGA adapter.\nAnother solution is to use the miniDP to HDMI or miniDP to DVI cable, which will work out of the box as long as you have the adequate ports on your external monitor.\nI posted about hardware support in Ubuntu for the Dell the XPS 15 in this post, it might help:\nhttp://hanynowsky.wordpress.com/2012/04/07/dell-xps-15-l502x-ubuntu-linux/\n", "Q: Cannot Install Google Chrome I am having trouble installing Google Chrome on my Ubuntu 11.10 system.

Every few years I come to a point where my Ubuntu gets rather bloated, as it is filling up with a lots of packages that I never use. So the goal is to roll the list of installed packages back to what Ubuntu ships by default and then reinstall everything I feel missing (as that's faster then trying to sort out which packages are unused). How do I do that? How can I find out if a given package is part of the default install or not?\nOr simply put: Where can I find a complete list of packages that Ubuntu installs by default?\n\nA: You can install Ubuntu in a virtual machine (e.g. VirtualBox). Then run:\ndpkg --get-selections >installed_packages.txt\nYour installed packages are listed in the installed_packages.txt file.\n\nA: gtkorphan can be used to remove packages that have been orphaned/have no dependencies. \nsudo apt-get install gtkorphan\n\nBe careful as some top level packages such as ubuntu-standard and linux-headers will also be displayed and should not be removed. gtk-orphan also allows you to purge left over configuration files from removed packages. \n", "Q: Finding CPU usage from top command I'm currently using \ntop -b -d 1 > file1.csv\n\nto append the entire output to a  csv file. However, I'd like the Cpu(%us) field alone to be entered in file1.\nI've gotten as far as this:\ntop -b -d 1|grep Cpu \n\nwhere I'm able to view only the Cpu entry. \nWhen I try\ntop -b -d 1|grep Cpu > file1.csv\n\nit doesn't deem to work as I'm not even able to view my file.\nMy intention is to plot a LiveGraph for all the CPU values (stored in a csv file) dynamically.\nThanks!\n\nA: For total CPU usage:\nIf you ONLY want the CPU Usage in general you might try this:\ntop -b -d1 -n1|grep -i \"Cpu(s)\"|head -c21|cut -d ' ' -f3|cut -d '%' -f1 > file1.csv\nThis will give you only the CPU value and update the one in the file. If you want to APPEND the data to the file (since I see you are naming it a csv file) then instead of one > use two, like >> file1.csv.\nFor each thread and CPU usage:\nFirst you need to eliminate the rest of the columns so it is easier to get the CPU data.\n\n\n*\n\n*Run top and press f.\n\n*In this menu you select which columns you want to see and which you do not. For your case leave only the CPU column and name (if you want the name)\n\n*Press ESC to go back to the main Top menu and save with Capital W the change. Now you command is easier to parse.\n\n\nNow for general CPU usage you normally have other tools like ps, iostat an doing a cat /proc/stat. For each you need a different parse like the one used for top. I only posted here for TOP since you explicitly  mention it in the title.\nNOTE: Should be noted that top is not the most efficient way to see the CPU usage or to work with when parsing values for it. For some, using f2 in the cut command shows the value, for others the f3\n\n\nA: I'm thinking that using top may not be the best approach.  I would look at using /proc/stat instead.  I found an article called \"Calculating CPU Usage from /proc/stat\" that may just solve most of the problem for you.\n\nA: It takes a little while, because there seems to be a buffer that needs to be filled up before the pipes start to work.\nTry with a small number of iterations first (note: -n2 means 2 iterations):\ntop -b -d1 -n2 | grep Cpu | cut -c 35-39\n\nRegarding to your comment: If you redirect standard output to a file with top -b -d 1 > file.csv, you cannot pipe standard output into the grep command.\nSee:\necho \"Standard output\" | grep \"out\"\n\nvs.\necho \"Standard output\" >/tmp/foo | grep \"out\"\n\nIn the second case you do not have any output.\n\nA: top -b -n1 | grep Cpu | sed -r 's@.+:\\s([0-9\\.]+).+@\\1@'\n\nAs has already been said the option -b together with -n 1 will give a single text output from top rather than the constantly updating default.

What button you push to launch an app like Firefox (which is what a shell does, mostly), does not affect the Gnome infrastructure. Seashorse, which is the application you're talking about, is a Gnome application and hence is installed in Ubuntu 11.10. \nYou were not asked for a password to your keyring when you installed Ubuntu. You were asked for a password for your user account, and that's the one used for the default keyring as well. \nCertainly, you do the exact same thing whether you use Unity, Unity 2D, Gnome Shell, xfpanel, or any other shell for Gnome. :)\n\nA: I'm using Ubuntu 11.10 with the Gnome Shell. The following procedure worked for me, I believe it should work with Unity as well:\n\n\n*\n\n*start the \"Passwords and Keys\" application\n\n*find the \"Passwords: default\" entry\n\n*open the context menu for that entry (usually with a right mouse click)\n\n*select the \"Change Password\" option\n\n*enter your current password as the \"Old Password\", leave the fields for the new password empty\n\n*click \"Ok\"\n\n*confirm to \"Use Unsafe Storage\"\n\n\nThat should do the trick.\n\nA: Even though the route is not the same, it's fairly easy to find the keyring in the Dash. Start typing \"password\", and the Password and Keys icon will immediately appear.\n\nA: In the 'Details' section of the keyring password prompt you're facing after login, there should be an option (2nd from above, IIRC) that lets you auto-unlock your keyring after login.

I also had other problems: when inserting a USB drive, an error message appeared -- don't remember the exact wording, but I think it mentioned gnome-display-properties -- to complain that the contents of the device could not be accessed (however, the Home Folder icon displayed it normally.) There were some other trivial UI problems, don't remember them, as I said, trivial. But a host of these \"trivial\" annoyances that all had other built-in methods to workaround them were fixed when, according to instructions I read elsewhere, I DELETED the mimeapps.list in ~/local/share/applications. This file is supposed to be removed during the upgrade to 11.10, and apparently it is not on some systems.\nA file by this same name already exists in the global location /usr/share/gdm/applications. I checked after restarting, and the mimeapps.list did not reappear in the ~/.local/usr/share/applications location. Possibly, this file is created if you customize user settings for the Launcher somehow.\nYou may perform your own experiment with this file by renaming the mimeapps.list in the local location and restarting. If the results are not as hoped, you can just rename it back. Otherwise, you can then delete it. No sudo would be required for ~/.local/...\nIt might be helpful if other users would confirm here that they do not have a mimeapps.list file in the ~/.local/share/applications folder.\n", "Q: How to fix the Gnome/Unity shortcut for an application?

I would recommend to check your bios settings and make sure that you have your ACPI settings (I don't know how to do it yet in Ubuntu, but I'll update my post on the moment I discover). A simple device on your usb port or a new driver on one of the peripherals can cause this. If you have hardware that needs proprietary drivers, you might need to update them too. Also, check the ACPI settings and set it to S3.\nMaybe this can help: http://www.ubuntugeek.com/fix-for-suspend-and-hibernation-problem-for-laptops.html\nAlso, it might be a little bit useful for the more experts if you provide your hardware and software information.

When I open the Unity Dash from the launcher, the Dash takes up the whole screen and doesn't give me the ability to resize it. This makes it impossible to see my desktop and drag and drop icons to it in order to create shortcuts. I've seen some screen where the dash has maximize and minimize buttons, but I do not have anything like that on my 11.10 install.\n\n\nA: For Ubuntu 11.10\nThe solution depends on whether you are using the standard or 2D version of Ubuntu, which depends on your graphics card. (See: Am I using Unity or Unity 2D? )\nResizing the Dash in the standard Ubuntu\nWhen opening the Ubuntu Dash, you should see three \"window buttons\" in the upper-left. \nClick the maximize button (the square) to switch between fullscreen and windowed mode.\n\nResizing the Dash in Ubuntu 2D\nInstall and launch Dconf Editor . Once it's open, navigate to the desktop > unity section in the left pane. You will see a form-factor option, which if set to 'Netbook' will made the Dash fullscreen, and if set to 'Desktop' will make the Dash windowed.\n\nWhat about drag-resizing the Dash, like a Window?\nThere are many unconfigurable parts of Unity, and this is one of them. The Dash has two modes  (fullscreen and windowed) and you can switch between them  using the methods above. You can't drag-resize the Dash.\nIn defense of Unity's design, though, there's no reason you'd want to resize the Unity Dash to arbitrary dimensions on the fly. You don't \"drag and drop icons [from the desktop to the Dash]  in order to create shortcuts\", as the question asker mentioned; that's what the launcher is for. The Dash is designed to be the sole focus on your desktop when you use it.\n\n\nA: Type: dconf write /com/canonical/unity/form-factor \"'Desktop'\"\nThis will set in terminal the dconf property to Desktop (same as in gui - see answer below). It works on 16.10 and surely also on 16.4. I wouldn't know for older versions. By \"works\" i mean that Dash is set to smaller size - you can't actually resize it (option removed from unity) but at least it does not cover all the screen.\n\nA: You can install dconf-editor from Software Center start it, and go to \ndesktop -> unity\nand change the form-factor from Netbook to Desktop.\n", "Q: xorg and modelines for sony Bravia KDL-40CX523 Does anyone know where I can find the correct modelines so I can configure my Sony TV to be recognised and have full (or close to) HD resolution?\nIntel 965 GM graphics, i know it's not the best but Window$ will configure it, surely Ubuntu can to?\n\nA: My sony tv (not the same model as yours) was also not detected\nI ran\nget-edid | parse-edid\n\nfrom the command line to get the required settings and then run these commands on startup:\nxrandr --newmode 1360x768 85.5 1360 1424 1536 1792 768 771 777 795 -hsync +vsync\nxrandr --newmode 1920x1080 148.50 1920 2008 2052 2200 1080 1084 1089 1125 +hsync +vsync\nxrandr --addmode VGA1 1360x768\nxrandr --addmode VGA1 1920x1080\n\n", "Q: How do I unlock a user account?

I am an absolute Linux beginner trying to wrap my head around open source. I was keen to know about who is the key player in taking up decisions for open source development. How do the developers agree on a new functionality or feature?\nFor instance, to be more precise, Let me ask who was responsible for the introduction of Unity in 11.04? Obviously it might have been introduced as a creative thought irrespective of how it is received by users. So who exactly suggests these ideas in the Ubuntu team?\nEven if one does suggest such a new creative feature, how is it agreed upon as a common standard by the rest of the development team involved?\n\nA: You ask two questions in one, really. But let me begin by saying that there is a reason why we call it GNU+Linux distributions. Ubuntu distributes free software that is made by other people. What software to use and how to use it, is up to Ubuntu, whereas the projects themselves have their own decision making processes. \nFor things like Unity, that is basically a Canonical product, Canonical has a large role in decision making. But Ubuntu is much more than that. Firefox, for instance, is maintained by Mozilla, so in that case, Mozilla makes most of the decisions. It's like that for lots of applications and programs. It's usually the ones who make the software who makes the decisions. Based on how that works, Ubuntu chooses what software to use. It would be legal to take software, like Firefox and make a new project out of it in order to become \"decision maker\", but that very rarely happens in reality. When there is a major dispute over the direction of which a project is headed, it can be forked into two different applications. That would also mean splitting the responsibility of decision making and maintaining the software, which is a big job. Also, if the software is very good and the project is very poorly administrated, it can happen, as was the perceived situation around OpenOffice.org, leading to LibreOffice, for instance. \nSo, since Unity is Canonicals project, they're in charge. But that doesn't mean that other opinions aren't valued and welcomed. They are. Canonical is at the center of it, but it's still a community project. But if the community splits into more than one opinion, and you have to have only one solution, then Canonicals opinion will be the final word. Usually, though, there is a best solution that people can agree on. \nFor general decisions about the direction Ubuntu is headed and what to focus on, there is a developer summit right after the release of one version of Ubuntu and another begins. The next starts on October 31th and is where the big picture is ironed out. You can read more about that here: http://uds.ubuntu.com/\n\nA: Ubuntu, like several other distros (Red Hat most notably probably) have corporate backing so there is a company that's more or less \"in charge\" and decides what the official roadmaps and 'supported' features are. \nIn the case of Ubuntu, the company Canonical founded by Mark Shuttleworth is the one in charge. Shuttleworth amassed great personal fortune during the dot-com boom (he is a space man!) and has mostly been paying out of his own pocket, though he and the Canonical executives are working on paid services and support offered by Canonical to bring the company to profitability. \nRed Hat, meanwhile, sells support for their own Enterprise distributions, and makes quite a lot of money doing so.\nThat said, the key to their success is listening to the community and allowing participation in submitting patches and input on the roadmap, so it's not just Canonical employees involved in Ubuntu or any of these other projects.\nAnyone can \"fork\" an open source project and do what they want with it as long as they continue to publish the source to their changes (for the most part, there's a lot of nuance here I'm leaving out for simplicity) and you can see projects like that in the likes of Linux Mint, but obviously there needs to be quite a bit of interest and support by similarly minded individuals for such a fork to take off. \n\nA: There's a page about Ubuntu governance.\nFor the introduction of Unity the typical way would have been that the Desktop Team decides it and the idea gets then aproved by the Technical Board - with Mark Shuttleworth having his influence on all levels. But I don't know how it really went.\n", "Q: Why can't I change my volume keybindings? My laptop's default sound adjustment keys are fn + up/down. In gnome 2.x I easily changed this binding to my keypad's upper right keys (/ and *). It seems that gnome 3 is allowing me to change the keybinding but when I press those buttons it still prints out the / and * symbols. It appears that nothing but the default media key bindings will register. Is this a bug I should report or is this intentional behavior by gnome? \nI do know they block assigning regular keys for protection of losing keyboard functionality but in this case it does allow me to assign it, it merely doesn't work.\nEDIT: I've found that the same thing happens under KDE as well. I believe that Gnome is not to blame. What is preventing these keys from registering their assigned actions?\n\nA: You can change keybindings with a .xmodmap file in your home directory.\nFirst you gotta open a terminal type xev and then the press desired keys (keys you want the behaviour of and keys you want this behaviour to have). Xev will record the keybindings giving you keycodes and names of commands. Then you go to you home directory and create a new file called .xmodmap. In there you have to arrange everything as the following example:\nkeycode 110 = Home (key you want to give = the desired command)\nWith this you can easyly swap or change keybindings. After that you have to log out and back in and choose the created .xmodmap to be used.\nIn the end it looks like this:\nkeycode key1 = function key2\nkeycode key2 = function Key1\n", "Q: Enable external VGA output on a laptop with a broken screen I have a laptop (Packard bell with Nvidia graphics) with broken screen.\nHow do I enable the vga external output for an external monitor?

Under 11.04, the option to control the pointer with the numpad was set in the Hardware/Keyboard settings page. \nHow can I turn on mousekeys or configure them in newer releases?\n\nA: grahammechanical's answer is good, but I want to talk about some extra features as I've dreamed to be a \"keyboard geek\" which turned out to be too extreme:\n1.Killing mice, one at a time(replace mouse keys)\nxdotool - command-line X11 automation tool（+keyborad custom shortcuts）\nxdotool click 3（context menu）\nxdotool click 2（middle）\nxdotool click 1（left click）\n\n2.replace mouse movement(use keyboard to move mouse pointer more accurate - need the support of \"universal access -> Mouse Keys\")\nxkbset - user preference utility for XKB extensions for X\nma - mousekeysaccel\n-xkbset ma 60 10 10 5 2\nxkbset ma 60 10 10 20 10\n\n\nA: In 11.10 and above you go to System Settings in the Power cog menu and select Universal Access. \n\nUnder the Pointing and clicking tab you will see a slider that lets you turn Mouse Keys on and off. The label says: Control the pointer using the keypad.\n\n\nA: This procedure is the same from 11.10 to at least 14.04, and it is nicely documented on help.ubuntu.com.   Because those instructions have been kept up to date, it's likely that the documentation will also be extremely helpful for future versions of Ubuntu. \nHere are the links for mousekeys in versions 12.04 through 14.04 -- note that the url is identical with the exception of the version number:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/ubuntu-help/mouse-mousekeys.html \n[...]  https://help.ubuntu.com/14.04/ubuntu-help/mouse-mousekeys.html \nHere are the 12.04-based instructions from the help site.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Click the icon at the very right of the menu bar and select System Settings.\n\n*Click Universal Access.\n\n*Select the Pointing and Clicking tab.\n\n*Switch Mouse Keys on.\n\n*Make sure that Num Lock is turned off. You will now be able to move the mouse pointer using the keypad.\nFor Unity, I found it easier to hit the Super, type in the first few letters of \"universal\", then skip to the third step given above (\"Select the Pointing and Clicking tab\").  \nThis is reflected in the 14.04 documentation:\n\n\n*\n\n*Tap the Super key to open the Dash.\n\n*Type Universal Access and press Enter to open the Universal Access settings.\n\n*Press Tab once to select the Seeing tab.\n\n*Press ← once to switch to the Pointing and Clicking tab.\n\n*Press ↓ once to select the Mouse Keys switch then press Enter to switch it on.\n\n*Make sure that Num Lock is turned off.

Just open it by searching in the Dash. It should show all your drives and USB sticks. I think using it is very easy. ;-)\n\nA: On Ubuntu 16.04\nJust right-click on your USB/External Disk and select format\n\nEnter Name and click on Format...\n\n\nA: I would recommend you installing GParted which is quite a powerful tool but still easy to use:\nsudo apt-get install gparted\n\nwhen you installed and opened it, it should be self-explanatory, otherwise dont hesitate to ask in a comment. \n\nA: You can try the GParted program for all your partitioning tasks.\nYou could search for it in the Ubuntu Software Centre or you could type this in the terminal:\nsudo apt-get install gparted\n\nWith GParted you can format your External HDD partition to ext4, but the partition should be unmounted.\nSelect your external hard drive from the top right corner (it would be marked as /dev/sdb most probably), then right click on the partition and format.\n\nAfter formatting, click on the accept button (it's in the middle of the menu bar) to save the changes.\nNow you would have successfully formatted your external drive to ext4, and it would show up in GParted as a single ext4 partition.\n\nAs suggested by hellocatfood, after formatting the drive, one will have to take ownership of it as well.

I have only used my external hard drive once, wich was with my previous Ubuntu installation (11.04), on the same laptop. I have created 2 partitions, FAT32 and EXT4. Now I needed to get some data from my external hard drive and IT WOULD NOT LET ME. No matter what I do in Nautilus, it will not do a thing with it. It is NOT corrupted. When I do mount /dev/sdb1 /media/sdb1 in a terminal, it said Permissions denied... (SO IT WON'T ALLOW ME TO ACCESS MY OWN DATA??). When mounting it as root, it works, but I don't want to. Things should simply work, normal users don't want to dive into a command line and go edit text files to do a simple action like mounting an external hard drive, and neither do I.\nWhen mounting it as root, by the way, and running sudo chown robin /media/sdb1 it even sais Permission denied, while I am running the command as root!

Small problem here. Since I installed (2nd time) Ubuntu 11.10 I can't hear the login sound, nor any \"beep\" sound when something went wrong. I may need your help here, because I can't find the solution in the \"sound configuration\"\n\nA: If sound does not work at all, it is a bug which is specific for your hardware - please fill a report ;-)\nIf there are applications which have got sound, klick on the gear on the upper right, then on system settings. Klick on audio, then raise the second volume control on the first tab. This tab is for system sounds. Check if the master volume is turned on, too. At last, if you mean your system beep, which is soldered on the mainboard, you have to load the kernel module \"pcspkr\".\nsudo modprobe -v pcspkr\n\nIf you want to load it permanently, add a line \"pcspkr\" to /etc/modules.\n\nA: During four installs of Ubuntu 11.10 last few days I noticed in all cases the speaker was set to zero (muted speaker right top screen).

My .xmodmaprc file reads as follows:\nkeycode 51 = 36\nBut the | key does not act as a return key. Nothing has changed. Any ideas what I might be doing wrong? Thanks so much for any suggestions.\n\nA: Your xmodmap expression is wrong. It needs to be formatted like this:\nkeycode [keycode] = [keysym]\n\nThe keysym is the symbol name of the key you want the \"|\" key mapped to, which in your case is \"Return\". So your xmodmap expression needs to be:\nkeycode 51 = Return\n\nPutting everything back together, the command you want to run is:\n[~]$ xmodmap -e \"keycode 51 = Return\"\n\n(Don't type the [~]$ part, I'm just indicating that you need to run that from terminal).\nIf you want this to run each time you log in create a file called ~/.Xmodmap with the following contents:\nkeycode 51 = Return\n\nI hope that works.\n\nA: You need to run the following in a terminal: \nxmodmap ~/.xmodmaprc\n", "Q: Left edge mouse hoover doesn't bring up Unity menu when fullscreened When I have an app full-screened in 11.10, hoovering my mouse on the left edge doesn't bring up Unity menu. I have three 11.10 computers and this is only happening on the dual-screen twin-viewed Nvidia box. Any ideas what's wrong?\n\nA: I had this too from an upgrade but it wasn't related to nvidia. The resolution was to start 'ccsm' (Compizconfig settings manager), go to desktop, Unity plugin, and select \"Dodge active window\" next to \"Hide Launcher\". \n\nA: I found rebooting fixes the issue. I am not using multiple monitors, I have it running on a laptop.\nWhen this happens the Launcher IS actually appearing, but doing so behind the other windows. I can actually see it behind my partially transparent terminal window. I can see is slide out and go back away.\nThe other weird thing is this: It thinks it is in front.

The problem happens only on 11.10. in 11.04 it works correctly.\nThe problem has expanded to Desktop Sharing and Sending files. Both of which do not work either. I think this is all related to a common problem.\nUPDATE - Desktop Sharing can be solved by activating vino-preferences and configuring in the host. After that tell the Empathy host to \"Share Desktop\". It should work. File Sharing has been solved in one of the updates that came several days ago. The issue still exists for Audio and Video.\nUPDATE 2 - Since around June 2012 in 12.04 the option about activating vino-preference to have Desktop Sharing is not working.\n\nA: Just to answer that everything works in 12.10 or 12.04 updated but the part about remote connection is now handled by Remmina Remote Desktop Client since trying to install everything as mentioned in How can I enable the \"Share Desktop\" feature in Empathy? still does not work. So if you are one of the users that this does not work when:\n\n\n*\n\n*Both users are using Empathy\n\n*Both have vinagre installed\n\n*Both are using the same ubuntu version (just in case)\n\n*Both are using a gmail account (jabber)\n\n\nThen the only way would be to either use Google Hangout or Remmina.\n\nA: As I also wrote at How can I enable the \"Share Desktop\" feature in Empathy?\nIt does work for me if:\n\n\n*\n\n*The sharing person once has to adjust the settings in \"vino-preferences\" for others to be allowed to view and control their screen.\n\n*And the viewing person has to have \"vinagre\" running.\n\n\nSharing from linuxmint 13 (ubuntu 12.04), viewing from linuxmint 15 (ubuntu 13.04).\n", "Q: How to quickly respond to Empathy message in Unity (Similar to Gnome-Shell) I have seen the way you can respond to messages in a nice quick way in Gnome-Shell with a message window popping out from the bottom.

There's a tab called \"Applications\" showing when you have given access to which applications from which computer. Just remove the relevant entry Ubuntu Software Center @ yourhostname. \n\nA: oneconf-query --list --hosts\n\nThis will give you a list of all the registered hosts including the duplicates which have different hostids even though they all have the same hostnames. Make note of the ones you want to delete and then ......\noneconf-query --hide-inventory --hostid=bigfrigginglong32digitmachineid!\n\nYou will find the entry associated with this machine id is no longer in the list generated by the first command and when software-center is restarted, it will disappear from there as well.

I'm not enjoying Ambiance, or Radiance, or any of the ones offered by default.\nWhere can I find themes for Ubuntu 11.10?\n\nA: I would recommend going to gnome-look.org and looking in their GTK 3.x section.\n\nA: The excellent DeviantArt crew are now moving their old GTK+3 themes to GTK+3.2 that you'll need to use in Oneiric.\nTip - search for GTK3 and order by the newest - you'll then see the new themes appear as they are converted.\n", "Q: Power management shortcut I am looking for a custom shortcut for showing power managemnt ( like Ctrl + Alt + Delete in ubuntu 10.10 that showed some tools for shutdown, suspend , restart , ... )\nI don't know which command does this. for example for showing system monitoring custom shortcut command is gnome-system-monitor. but I don't know what is for power.\nThanks,\nM.Varmazyar\n\nA: I believe the command you are looking for is gnome-session-quit --power-off:\n\nThis is the same dialog as in 11.04, but it has been redesigned.\n", "Q: How can I edit GTK+3 themes (preferably with a GUI)? (similar problem to one in a question I had before, but I need multiple solutions, and I felt they were better organized as separate questions)\nUpgrading from 11.04 to 11.10 did away with my themes, without warning me. And I can't find any themes online. I'm not enjoying Ambiance, or Radiance, or any of the ones offered by default. I found a couple that I kind of like online, but they're not quite right. Instead of looking for somebody who coincidentally came up with the perfect theme for me, I'd like to find something close, and edit a few pieces to fit my tastes.\nParticularly... I don't like gray. I get why sometimes you wand a bit less contrast, but most of the time, gray just makes me unhappy. So I want to give my theme much more contrast in colors, with perhaps some shade of blue where I feel actual color is necessary. These sorts of edits were simple enough back in 11.04. I can't find a way to make them in 11.10.\nI can't seem to find any way to customize the themes. I really want to customize my themes. This is Ubuntu. I know I can. What's the simplest way for me to do it?\n\nA: I copied a the theme from /usr/share/themes that is close to fit my needs to /home/user/.themes. After copying the folder I removed the settings for the window-managers that I don't use. Now I used that copy to edit the appearance of the theme. \nI changed the gnome-shell.css file in the folder of the specific window-manager. (here gnome-shell folder of course)\nSo far I played around with the size of the icons and their spacing in the application overview. The file itself has a few comments which hint to functionality and to the purpose of the parameters. Just look there and play around... if you mess it up just replace it by the original theme.

How do I install the drivers for my graphics card, which is an ATI 6850?  I know that sometimes things stop working when I download a third-party driver, so I'd like to know the right way to do this.\n\nA: By default Ubuntu will use the open source drivers for AMD cards. Some users prefer the third-party AMD/ATI drivers for various reasons and it's easy to install them. The easiest way to install these drivers is to either search for the \"fglrx\" package in the Ubuntu Software Center and install it (and then restart) or open the \"Additional Drivers\" application and choose to activate the AMD driver when asked (and then restart). \nIf you prefer to input commands in the terminal:\nsudo apt-get install fglrx\n\n", "Q: Problem logging in with an old home account I have just installed Ubuntu 11.10 and I am trying to use an old user home directory. \nMy network is set up with a NIS server for authentication.

When I get a new e-mail, the envelope does not change at all (No visible notification). Additionally no bubble appears telling me about the new message. How can I change this behavior?\n\nA: You may need to disable any extension you had working in 11.04 to get this functionality.  According to the details of the one I had, it is now integrated into the Ubuntu Oneiric version of Thunderbird, and they recommend disabling the original add-on.  After doing so, my indicator pop-up is working.

My laptop screen is broken and I'm trying to connect to an external monitor through a VGA cable but I can't get the system to recognise the new monitor. I've tried using different drivers and settings in NVIDIA, the function key, as well as entering xrandr --output VGA1 --auto into the terminal. It just says output VGA not found but it recognises there's a monitor in NVIDIA. I know it is possible to do since my friend who put this OS on my computer did it last night, but we can't do it again after restarting the computer. \n\nA: Open up Nvidia settings tool. Then go to \"X Server Display Configuration\". There you should see your monitor. \n\nClick on the monitor you like change. \nThen click on \"Configuration:\" And choose your setting \"Twin view\" or \"Separate X screen\" the later one requires that you log out and in again. \n\nJust for test, choose \"Twin View\" and click apply. Now you should have the screen activated to the right of your other screen. \nIf this works, then you could make the changes permanent. And if you like to only use that monitor then you should try the \"Separate X screen\" configuration. \nClose down Nvidia settings tool. And then reopen it with root. You can do this from the terminal by typing sudo nvidia-settings in the terminal. \nThis will open the nvidia settings dialog again but with root privileges so you can save the changes and make them permanent for every boot. \nNow you choose  \"Separate X screen\" from the configuration and then you click \"Save to X Configuration File\" at the bottom of the window. And follow the steps. \nThen log out and back in again and you should have the screen working. \nHope it helps. \n", "Q: Problem printing in LibreOffice Writer but not in Adobe Acrobat Reader or Evolution I recently upgraded to 11.10. I use an HP LaserJet P1102w printer. Since the upgrade, LibreOffice Writer does not print several letters. Adobe Viewer and Evolution do print perfectly, as before. \nNobody seems to have reported anything like that. I would welcome clues on how to tackle this puzzling behavior.\n\nA: Had similar problem. LibO Writer calc etc wouldn’t print several characters. Seemingly random. Only a problem from LibreOffice. What fixed the problem for me was reverting from pdf to postscript print setting in LibO. File -> Printer Settings -> Properties -> Device -> Printer Language type was set to PDF so I changed it to PostScript. Had to update the normal template to make it stick.\nHere is how you change the default template (in french)\nUnfortunately, that only helps when creating new docs. You have to manually modify each old doc, which sucks a bit... \n\nA: It took a lot of digging, but found that you can make the change the default printer settings using spadmin shell command.

The first issue involves  connecting to my bluetooth headset. I am able to successfully pair and connect to my Samsung headset for the first time. But as soon as I turn off the headset and later try to reconnect, I'm not able to reconnect the headset. When I try to activate the connection from the settings dialog, the switch toggle back and forth automatically between on and off and never reconnects. I should mention that I had no issues with the 11.10 beta version using the same exact headset.\nI have no issues connecting to my bluetooth mouse on the same laptop. However, when I disconnect the bluetooth mouse, the trackpad is not automatically re-enabled. I have to log out and log back in to re-enable the trackpad after disconnecting the bluetooth mouse.\nI'm using 11.10 with all the latest patches.\n\nA: Well, I found a workaround solution to the issue. I posted a similar question over on the BlueZ developer mail list and got several responses. It seems that there was a regression bug introduced somewhere in Linux Kernel 3.0 that was related to the Bluetooth Secure Simple Pairing (SSP) protocol used by Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR devices. The bug prevents reconnection of a device that was originally paired using SSP mode, that is without entering the pin code during pairing. Here is a link to the bug report: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/bluez/+bug/931860.\nIts not clear when the bug will be corrected in the Linux Kernel or whether it will get incorporated in the 3.0 and forward releases. If you are experiencing this same issue, there is a workaround that worked for me. The workaround involves disabling Simple Secure Pairing and letting the pairing default back to regular non-SSP mode. You can accomplish this by running the following command: \nsudo hciconfig hci0 sspmode 0\n\nYou'll have to run this command again after each reboot in order keep it disabled to allow reconnections to happen.

I'm running 11.10 (amd64). I see there's this package:\nhttp://packages.ubuntu.com/source/oneiric/haskell-hunit\nHowever:\n$ sudo apt-get install haskell-hunit\nReading package lists... Done\nBuilding dependency tree       \nReading state information... Done\nE: Unable to locate package haskell-hunit\n\nHow should I resolve this?\n\nA: That is a source package: \n\n7.13 How do I install a source package?\nDebian source packages can't actually be \"installed\", they are just unpacked in whatever directory you want to build the binary packages they produce.\nSource packages are distributed on most of the same mirrors where you can obtain the binary packages. If you set up your APT's sources.list(5) to include the appropriate \"deb-src\" lines, you'll be able to easily download any source packages by running\n apt-get source foo\n\nTo help you in actually building the source package, Debian source package provide the so-called build-dependencies mechanism. This means that the source package maintainer keeps a list of other packages that are required to build their package. To see how this is useful, run\n apt-get build-dep foo\n\nbefore building the source.\n\nSo you can't actually \"install\" it. However, there are binary packages \nbuilt from it:\n\n\n*\n\n*libghc-hunit-dev\nHaskell unit testing framework for GHC  \n\n*libghc-hunit-doc\nHaskell unit testing framework for GHC; documentation\n\n*libghc-hunit-proof\nHaskell unit testing framework for GHC; profiling libraries\n\n\nOne of them should contain what you want.\n\nA: I typically install only Haskell Platform and GHC from apt and then install everything else through Cabal. Haskell dependencies are a bit messy and many times require updating packages much sooner than Ubuntu's 6 month release cycle. Cabal install's everything into ~/.cabal/ which is nice because if things get screwed up, you can delete it and start over. I think most of the Haskell community works this way from what I've gathered on IRC.\n", "Q: AMD Catalyst Control Center crashes silently when I click 'apply' after changing dual monitor settings, unless run from terminal window AMD CCC crashes when I hit 'apply' after changing dual monitor settings\nProcedure:\n\n\n*\n\n*I open AMD Catalyst Control Center\n\n*I select 'Display Manager' on the left\n\n*I choose the 'Multi-display desktop' Option\n\n*I set both monitors to their max resolution (1920x1200 and 1600x1200)\n\n*When I click the 'apply' button CCC closes without any sort of message (expecting it to tell me that a restart is required), and without (visibly) changing any settings.\n\n\nNote: I copied the command line from the applications menu shortcut, and ran it from within a terminal window.

After following the instructions I can now happily use dual monitors.\n\nA: I had the same issue in Lubuntu.  I read on another forum about a quick fix that worked for me.  I added the KDE desktop environment, restarted and used that desktop to set up multiple screens.  When I hit apply it ask me if I wanted to save and I said yes and restarted to save my settings.  I the logged back in under my LXDE desktop and had dual screens.  \n\nA: Run to AMD CCC, alternative command for gnome-terminal:\nenv LC_ALL=C amdcccle\n\n\nA: I had the same issue when trying to get dual-screen working, but I was not ever able to get the GUI control center to work. I wound up using only aticonfig and the ubuntu displays configuration options (Ubuntu 12.04 here). \nI have to combine a few things. \nFirst: From the Unofficial linux AMD Ubuntu installation guide I ran the following two lines (backup your /etc/X11/xorg.conf file first!):\nsudo amdconfig --initial -f\nsudo amdconfig --set-pcs-str=\"DDX,EnableRandR12,FALSE\"  \n\nThis re-initializes your config file, supposedly for dual screen. There are some other tips in that guide to get the driver to recognize xorg.conf and such, not sure if they're needed.\nSecond: I added a Virtual line to the subsection \"Display\" under the section \"Screen\" in my /etc/X11/xorg.conf:\nSection \"Screen\"\n    ... some stuff ...\n    SubSection \"Display\"\n        Viewport   0 0\n        Depth     24\n        Virtual 3600 1200\n    EndSubSection\nEndSection\n\nNote that for me, the SubSection \"Display\" was already there, I just had to add the Virtual 3600 1200 line. I set this so that it represented the total combined resolution of my two screens. They had different heights, so I took the larger one (1200) for the y-direction. I need to add this to prevent the problem listed in Ubuntu bug #864505.\nFinally: I rebooted (not sure if that was needed). Then, I went to the Ubuntu \"Displays\" configuration (NOT AMD's control center). Then I unchecked \"Mirror displays\". Reboot, and good to go with dual screens!\n", "Q: Remember folder when browsing file For uploading a file to the internet, I browse the folder to find a file. How to set ubuntu to remember the last folder browsed instead of opening the default home folder when trying to upload another file. \n\nA: I don't know if it is possible, but I will give you two tips that can help you:\n\n\n*\n\n*Bookmark your most important directories in Nautilus: if you often access a specific folder for uploading files, bookmark it! Open the directory in Nautilus and use the CTRL+D keys to bookmark it... Thus, every time you open the \"select file dialog\" you can click in the bookmark dir to move directly to the directory!\n\n*You can copy the path of the file and/or the path to the directory e CTRL+V in the \"select file dialog\" (in Nautilus you can use the CTRL+L to open the location bar, CTRL+C to copy and use ESC to disable it).\nI hope this can help you.\nRegards,\nRafael.\n", "Q: How can I send current line in gedit to terminal? When editing shell file in gedit, is there a way I could send current line (or selected block?) to terminal?\nWhen learning Python I use Spyder IDE. It has an option to execute code selection or block in the console. Which I found very useful in learning what my scripts are doing step by step (or not doing ;).\nAny chance to have something like that with gedit? Or any other text editor?\n\nA: sudo apt-get install gedit-plugins\nThis adds more plugins, one of which is an embedded terminal -- Once you've installed, open gedit, go to preferences, and check it in the \"plugins\" tab.\nYou can't specifically pipe commands or blocks through, but you can save the file and easily ./test.sh, and it can be helpful for running commands through it as opposed to having another terminal open.\nhttp://www.linuxnov.com/how-to-install-additional-plugins-for-gedit-text-editor/\nHope this helps!\n\nA: Do you know Autokey?\nIt wouldn't be hard to make a keyboard shortcut to run the selected line in a shell.\nAutokey has many automation features, very useful to have around. And it uses pythons as its scripting language, since you already know it, it will be to get around.\n\nA: unfortunately, gedit don't have this function... However, GNU Emacs has the function you want!\nTo install it you must type:\nsudo apt-get install emacs\nAfter installed, you can create a new buffer (i.e., a new file). Depending on the file extension, the Emacs will change the menus to give you appropriate options...\nFor a simple test, you can create a new shell script file (with the extension \".sh\"). After saving the file, a new menu \"Sh-Script\" will appear. This menu has two options related to your demand: \"Execute Script...\" and \"Execute region\".\nI don't know what kind of files you want to use this functionality, but you can try to use Emacs!\nBest regards,\nRafael.\n\nA: A kludgy solution - a sort of \"manual send\" - would be to copy the line in Gedit with Ctrl-C and then paste it into Terminal with Ctrl-Shift-V.\n", "Q: Gnome Shell Thunderbird Mail Notification Does anyone know of a way to get persistent Gnome 3 panel notifications in Gnome 3 in  Oneiric?

Today I upgraded to 11.10 and mounting with truecrypt failed with this message:\nError: device-mapper: reload ioctl failed: Invalid argument\n\nOn some googling I found that this could be a problem if the Kernel is not compiled with XTS support and the solution was to use \"-m=nokernelcrypto\" option. This works for me but this is less than ideal since there will be a performance hit.\nCan anyone tell me how to get the stock 7.1 version of Truecrypt to work on Ubuntu 11.10 natively, seems like this should be a major issue if Truecrypt support was pulled from Ubuntu.\n\nA: XTS (if anyone is wondering) is a mode of operation that allows you to use the block cipher repeatedly with a single key. It's currently the default in TrueCrypt.\nI'm using kernal 3.0.0-12-generic in 11.10 (64-bit) and as far as I can tell TrueCrypt (7.1) is using XTS on my install. (according to the volume property page)\nAlso - I don't think Ubuntu ever supported TrueCrypt directly in the first place - it's not available through the Ubuntu Software Center and Unity ignores the application's notification icon which is critical for novice users (if they close the main TrueCrypt window).

I have a clean install of Mythbuntu 11.10 acting as a frontend only. It is networked using eth0 and I have a router acting as a DHCP server on the same subnet.\nThe frontend boots and automatically logs on and runs Myth frontend.\nHowever approximated every 3 out of 4 boots, the box has not yet obtained an IP address via DHCP before myth starts. This causes Myth to enter a configuration mode. If I cancel out, then Myth starts normally, as the DHCP response has been received.\nHow do I change the boot to wait for a DHCP response before logging on?\n\nA: Three options for you, ranging from manual-but-easy to manual-and-need-a-doctorate (in that progression).\n1. Don't use DHCP.\nAllocate a static IP in your router (so it doesn't give that IP to another device) and then configure Ubuntu to use that static address. You can do that either with Network Manager (if you're using that) or by editing /etc/network/interfaces with something like this:\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\n        address 192.168.0.4\n        netmask 255.255.255.0\n        network 192.168.0.0\n        broadcast 192.168.0.255\n        gateway 192.168.0.1\n\n2. Have something sit and wait for your network to come up and have an IP\nI'm talking about writing a script that checks to see if your network card is up. For simplicity you could combine whatever launches XBMC with a check like (stolen from the forums):\n#!/bin/bash\n\nuntil wget -q -O - http://www.google.com | grep Lucky > /dev/null; do\n    sleep 10\ndone\n\nxbmc\n\nAnd call that script instead of calling xmbc directly.\n3. Play around with Upstart and break it to do your will.\nUpstart is what manages all the system things and manages when things run based on events that each job emits. This seems like the most pleasing route for you because you might be able to make it emit a signal exactly when it has a DHCP address assigned.\nThe problem is you'll have to really dig into the boot process to alter things. I don't know enough about it to reasonably help.\n\nA: Thanks Oli, I went with your option 3, which I'll describe here in case anyone else is interested:\n\n\n*\n\n*Uninstall the network manager in xmbc (not sure this is essential, but I don't need it):\n# apt-get remove network-manager\n\n\n*Configure /etc/network/interfaces by adding:\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet dhcp\n\n\n*Tell lightdm so start only when an interface other than loopback comes up, in additional to the existing trigger conditions, by changing the start trigger in /etc/init/lightdm.conf\nstart on ((filesystem\n   and runlevel [!06]\n   and started dbus\n   and (drm-device-added card0 PRIMARY_DEVICE_FOR_DISPLAY=1\n        or stopped udev-fallback-graphics)\n   and net-device-up IFACE!=lo) \n  or runlevel PREVLEVEL=S)\n\nI added the condition net-device-up IFACE!=lo.\nSo far it seems to work well.\n", "Q: Is there a way to tell where synclient gets its information from?

Anyone have any ideas on fixing this? \nThanks. \n\nA: Assuming there's not a more simple answer, I would personally opt to skip out the automated OS detection and to do it myself:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to the LiveCD, use GParted to shrink the Windows partition.\n\n*Run the installer and install to the spare space, letting GRUB eat the boot sector.\n\n*Reboot into Ubuntu (it won't give you the option of Windows)\n\n*Fix GRUB to allow you to use Windows. Essentially you just want to just chainload onto the windows partition (which I assume you left as the first on the first drive) but you can't do that by simply editing a config file because GRUB is generated dynamically. You have to write a script that update-grub can call each time it rebuilds the bootloader:\nStart by running sudoedit /etc/grub.d/15_windows and in that file, paste in out:\n#!/bin/sh -e\ncat << EOF\nmenuentry \"Windows 7\" {\n    set root=(hd0,1)\n    chainloader +1\n}\nEOF\n\nSave that, run sudo chmod a+x /etc/grub.d/15_windows and then run sudo update-grub. This should edit the boot sequence and now in GRUB you should see a Windows option. (You might have to hold left-shift to see grub! You can edit that option in /etc/default/grub)\nBe prepared for the worst.\nYou're dealing with important things here. A smart man plans ahead.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a backup of anything on the Windows partition you cannot replace and would miss if it was nuked from orbit. You're resizing a partition. This is dangerous. Not as dangerous as swimming in a lake full of freshwater crocodiles but up there with not wearing high-SPF sun cream.\n\n*Make sure you have a rescue disk for Windows. Be that an original installer or some sort of other device that you can run bootrec.exe from.\n\n*Wear a condom. You don't know where Windows' boot sector has been.\n\n*Don't do this the day/hour before you really need the computer to do something. If it does go wrong, you're under pressure and you're more likely to make a mistake and make it irreparably worse.\n", "Q: How To Record Compressed Video From TV Tuner Using VLC UPDATE: The previous title for this question was \"How To Specify Bitrate, Codec and Demultiplexing for VLC Video Capture or Recording.\"\nI capture video from old TV tuner card - Pinnacle PCTV - using VLC. The video is from the Composite input and audio is from I guess the mixer or Line in. The command I use is:\nvlc  v4l2:///dev/video0:normal=pal:width=720:height=576:input=1 :input-slave=\"alsa://hw:0,0\"\nIn VLC, I have enabled the Advanced Controls toolbar, which allows me to record videos when I want to. However, these videos are uncompressed - very big and play only with VLC. Totem throws the \"Could not demultiplex stream\" error. I need to convert them using WinFF to reduce their size and make them playable with Totem and other software.\nMy question is whether I can configure the recording settings - the codecs and the bitrate, and also get the stream demultiplexed. If I pass any -sout parameter with command I get a \"Segmentation fault\". I use 64-bit Ubuntu 10.10.\n\nA: In the past I've had the following work for me:\nffmpeg -f oss -ac 2 -ar 48000 -i /dev/audio1 -acodec pcm_s16le -f video4linux2 -s 720x480 -r 3000/101 -i /dev/video0 -sameq -aspect 4:3 -target ntsc-dvd a.vob\n\nOf course both the -target and frame rate -r 3000/101 would have  to be changed for PAL.\n", "Q: Unity is not working properly because unity-panel-service was not found I've downloaded some updates for Ubuntu 11.10 and, after I restarted my computer to the changes take effect, I've realized that the Unity interface was not working properly. The left panel (where the apps stay), and the top bar was also not appearing. I've restarted my computer again but the things stood the way they were.\nWell, then I tried to force Unity to run via terminal, but when I try unityor unity --reset, the first message that appears is \"unity-panel-service: process not found\". When I type unity-panel-service on terminal, it also says it is not found.\nThen I searched about it on the web and got this page (http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/oneiric/man1/unity-panel-service.1.html) which says that unity panel service is the process responsible for loading the panels that are missing. \nSo, my question is, how can I re-download or reinstall it so unity can work again? Or, \nof course, if I'm wrong and the reason unity is not working is not that, please tell me :)\n\nA: I had a similar issue due to a broken graphics driver which didn't go away when I reinstalled fglrx. I eventually stumbled upon the solution: The unity plugin had been disabled in the compiz settings!\nFixed by running ccsm then enabling the Unity plugin and disabling any conflicts.\n\nA: I had the same issue. Had fiddled around with ccsm for a bit and downloaded some updates, then after rebooting unity 3D no longer worked. Missing launcher and panel.\nunity --reset didn't help and I had to use Ubuntu 2D (this option was deprecated since Ubuntu 12.10).\nThanks to your link, I found unity-panel-service in /usr/lib/unity/unity-panel-service. I used dpkg-query -L unity-services after finding the package name in the man page you linked. That gives you the location of all its contents.\nI then ran /usr/lib/unity/unity-panel-service while logged into 2D. I didn't expect that to work, and it doesn't. It exits with a fatal error, saying it cannot register itself. Not surprising, since there already is a panel, I guess. However, after the failed start in 2D, I can suddenly log into 3D again and everything is back to normal.\nHope that works for you, too.\nIf you don't have /usr/lib/unity/unity-panel-service, then I'd try removing and re-installing the unity-services package, which provides that executable.\n\nA: Nothing of the other replies worked for me. I did something more simple. I create a new user (called temporal)\nsudo adduser temporal\nsudo adduser temporal root\nsudo adduser temporal admin \n\n(this is useful to write the file in your normal user space)\nClose session and enter in temporal.\n(If you don't have access to the normal menu you can execute in terminal:\nkillall -u your-user\n\n)\nOnce you have entered \"temporal\" session execute ccsm (compizconfig settings manager) in a terminal (Control+Alt+T): \nccsm &\n\nGo to Preferences → Export \"fix.profile\"\nClose temporal session. Open your session. Open ccsm. \nccsm &\n\nGo to Preferences → Import your file \"fix.profile\".\nYou will have again your Unity 3D bar.\nDelete the temporal session:\nsudo deluser temporal\n\nRemove the files:\nsudo rm -rf /home/temporal\n\nDone.\n", "Q: How to change the position of docky notifications?

Still researching...\n\nA: Yikes! What a pickle. let's see if we can get you sorted. Starting with a recap of your disks and partition tables:\nsda - no partition table\nsdb - sdb1 [Linux] sdb2 [Linux extended] sdb5 [swap]\nsdc - no partition table\nsdd - no partition table\nsde - no partition table\n\n\n\n*\n\n*None of these are marked fd  Linux raid autodetect, which is the default\n\n*You're not using partitions to organize your disk space [0]\n\n*You appear to have the entire disk formatted for ext2/3 and are using the entire\ndisk as part of the raidset\n\n\nThe last point is where I think you became undone. The initscripts probably thought you were due for an fsck, sanity checked the volumes, and wiped out the MD superblock in the process. dumpe2fs should return nothing for volumes part of the RAID set.\nTake my RAID for example:\nroot@mark21:/tmp/etc/udev# fdisk -l /dev/sda\n\nDisk /dev/sda: 640.1 GB, 640135028736 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 77825 cylinders, total 1250263728 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x0000ffc4\n\nDevice Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sda1            2048  1240233983   620115968   fd  Linux raid autodetect\n\nroot@mark21:/tmp/etc/udev# dumpe2fs /dev/sda1\ndumpe2fs 1.41.14 (22-Dec-2010)\ndumpe2fs: Bad magic number in super-block while trying to open /dev/sda\nCouldn't find valid filesystem superblock.\n\nThat you were able to recreate the RAID set at all is extremely lucky, but that doesn't change the fundamental flaws in your deployment. This will happen again.\nWhat I would recommend is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup everything on that raid set\n\n*Destroy the array and erase the md superblock from each device (man mdadm)\n\n*Zero out those disks: dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdX bs=1M count=100\n\n*Create partitions on sda, sdc, sdd, & sdf that span 99% of the disk [0]\n\n*Tag those partitions as type fd linux-raid wiki\n\n*never ever format these partitions with any sort of filesystem\n\n*Create a new RAID 5: mdadm --create /dev/md0 -v -f -l 5 -n 4 /dev/sda1 /dev/sdc1 /dev/sdd1 /dev/sde1\n\n*Update new UUID in /etc/mdadm.conf\n\n*Live happily ever after\n\n\nI presume from your description that sdb is your system disk, and that's fine. Just make sure you don't accidentally include that in your raid set creation. After this, you should be on the right track and will never encounter this problem again.\n[0] I encountered a very nasty fault once on SATA disks that had lots of bad blocks. After using the vendor tool to reconstitute the disk. My once identical set of disks was now unique, the bad drive now had a few blocks less than before the low level format had begun, which of course ruined my partition table and prevented the drive from rejoined the MD RAID set.\nHard drives usually have a \"free list\" of backup blocks used for just an occasion. My theory is that that list must have been exhausted, and since this wasn't an enterprise disk, instead of failing safe and allowing me the opportunity to send it off for data recovery, it decided to truncate my data and re-size the entire disk in.\nTherefore, I never use the entire disk anymore when creating a RAID set, and instead use anywhere from 95-99% of the available free space when creating a partition that would normally span the entire disk. This also gives you some additional flexibility when replacing failed members.

I did not find a quote for Ubuntu, but Xubuntu also requires 4.4 Gb with a regular install, but on the Xubuntu page they write that Xubuntu install with the alternate CD only requires 2Gb of free space on the medium on wich you wish to run the OS.\n\nA: You could use device mapper FakeRAID or Linux software RAID to make your root file system span across the two ssds. Fakeraid works out of the box with Ubuntu, if your BIOS supports it. For Software RAID you need to use the alternate CD (afaik). I don't know if you actually get a performance gain with either of these two methods of software RAID when using ssds, nevertheless, it should solve your hard disk space problems.\n", "Q: Error in installing LanguageTool-1.5 on LibreOffice I am getting the following error while installing the latest LanguageTool-1.5 on LibreOffice. \nI have already uninstalled the previous languagetool using the below command.

I have encountered an application issue that I know has a bug assigned in both Launchpad and the external tracker the application project actually uses (in this case Google Code). I understand that Launchpad can integrate with external trackers (and can see an example assigned against another package in this bug).\nI have a Launchpad login. I can click on the pencil icon next to the status to change it (for example, change to \"Confirmed\") but I don't get an option to associate the bug with an external issue, which is what I actually want to do. Do I not have permission to, or is there some other option that I'm missing?\n\nA: There is an \"Also affects project\" link on the bug which would allow you to link to the rabbitvcs project on launchpad.\n\nAs you are adding it from the context of the rabbitvcs ubuntu package, it will automatically select the upstream rabbitvcs project on launchpad & allow you to paste in the URL.\n\n", "Q: My default mouse cursor doesn't change, no matter which theme I use If I open gnome-tweak-tool, go to the Theme section and choose the DMZ-Black cursor theme, my default cursor stays exactly the same. However, the other cursor images (like when I move a window or hover over a link) are the correct ones from the DMZ-Black theme. The same happens if I choose the Adwaita theme, for example.\nDoes anyone know why this is? How can I completely change my cursor theme so that the default cursor is also changed?\n\nA: In a terminal enter this:\ngksu gedit /usr/share/icons/default/index.theme\n\nThen change DMZ-White with exact name of the theme you want use, in your case DMZ-Black. Then it will show the correct theme.\n\nA: Multi-user 14.04\nIf you have only one user on your system, it will be ok to change default curser theme, whether by copying DMZ-Black contents onto DMZ-White, or changing default index.theme content, or even using command sudo update-alternatives --config x-cursor-theme.\nBut on a multi-user system, you need to personalize for yourself alone without affecting other users. Well, it's not so hard. You just need to make a \"default\" curser theme under your home.\nLet's change the cursor theme in steps:\nVia Terminal\n\n\n*\n\n*gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface cursor-theme \"DMZ-Black\" – simply replace \"DMZ-Black\" with your desired theme\n\n*mkdir ~/.icons/default\n\n*gedit ~/.icons/default/index.theme\n\n*copy the following lines in the text file and save it:\n[Icon Theme]\nInherits=DMZ-Black\n\n– again replace \"DMZ-Black\" with your desired theme.\nVia GUI \n\n\n*\n\n*Install Dconf Editor or Unity Tweal Tool to be able to change the cursor theme;\n\n*On Dconf Editor, search for \"cursor-theme\", double click it and change the value to \"DMZ-Black\" or your desired theme. \n\nAlternatively on Unity Tweak Tool under Apearance, go to Cursors and select \"DMZ-Black\" or your desired theme.\n\n\n*Open Files (Nautilus) and go to ~/.icons (make one if there isn't any);\n\n*Make a new folder, name it default and open it;\n\n*Make an empty document and name it index.theme;\n\n*Open the file, paste the following lines and save it:\n[Icon Theme]\nInherits=DMZ-Black\n\nYou can replace \"DMZ-Black\" with your desired theme.\n\nThis works also on Synaptic Package Manager and Nautilus with root privileges.\nSource: Raschix's comment on a post from webupd8.org 4 years ago!\n", "Q: How do I replace the background-1.xml file under /usr/share/backgrounds/contest/?

In Ubuntu 11.04, Ctrl-Alt-Del gives me a menu with shutdown, hibernate, suspend and restart, but no logout. Is there a key combination to logout of Ubuntu? Is there a way to provide one?\n\nA: In Ubuntu 11.10 you could write a script containing\n#/bin/bash\ngnome-session-quit --logout --no-prompt\n\nmake it executable with chmod +x script-name, then set a global shortcut to execute this script in Gnome Control Center -> Keyboard.\nIn previous Ubuntu versions there was gnome-session-save --logout.\n\nA: In Ubuntu 1204 there are two out-of-the-box solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*\"Run a command\" technique:\n\nAlt-F2 | type gnome-session-quit\n\n\n*\"Indicator menu\" technique:\n\nAlt-F10 | arrow right or left to gear icon | arrow down to Log Out...\n\nIn each case, confirm logout by hitting Enter.  A bug in Ubuntu for #1 is that if you login and do nothing and hit Alt-F2 you get Dash (to run programs).  Just hit Esc and try again with Alt-F2 and you'll get the \"Run a command\" instead this time.\n\nA: Creating custom keyboard shortcuts:\nFor 12.04 LTS and later:\nTo add a new shortcut open System Settings -> Keyboard and choose the Shortcuts tab:\n\nPress the '+' sign on the bottom left to enter the name of your custom shortcut and the command you want to run (e.g. gnome-session-quit --logout --no-prompt). After having applied this you are able to select the line of your new shortcut. Then press the desired key combination. In case the key combination already exist we will have to delete this first.\nFor 14.04 LTS and later:\nIn a default Unity session the new logout dialog is presented needing another at least two keystrokes to select poweroff from the menu:\n\nThe old dialog with a 60 s timeout will only be displayed in a gnome-flashback session.\n\nA: I think you can just make custom shortcut for gnome-session-quit --logout --no-prompt without any bash scripting.\n\nA: If you are using Unity (the default environment in Ubuntu 11.04 and later) then you can press the Super key (aka the Windows key) to bring up the dash, type in \"log\" and the first option is \"Log Out\" so just press Enter. This will bring up a dialog box to confirm whether you want to log out, with the \"Log Out\" button already selected, so press Enter again. And you're logged out.\n\nA: Another way is to restart lightdm. In 14.04 that would be sudo service lightdm restart and in 15.04 systemctl restart lightdm\n\nA: If the GUI is not actually responding anymore, all these shortcuts here won't work.\nAlso they all require you to think of that before you want to use it, which is bad, if you are in a problematic state, where you e.g. cannot use the mouse anymore or GNOME (your desktop UI) freezes or so.\nHowever, you can usually still change the TTY to a different one that has a CLI interface, login and kill the session there.\nStep by step\n\n*\n\n*Press Ctrl+Alt+number to go to a different TTY.\nThat (TTY) number best to try is, depending on your version and how many users you have\nlogged in currently either the number 1 (<= Ubuntu 17.10) or 3\n(> Ubuntu 17.10). Either read up the details behind\nthat or just try them\none-by-one or randomly, just be a little patient as switching to a\ndifferent TTY can take some seconds.\nOr, of course, just try a high number that is likely always there (like  5 or so). And remember the number you've pressed, in order not to accidentally kill yourself later.\n\n*Now login by typing your (or any) user name and password.\n\n*Now run loginctl like this loginctl kill-session XY by replacing XY with the session number you want to kill.\nAs you likely don't know that magic number by heard, you can read here how to find it. The TL;DR Is: Use tab to autocomplete it or use loginctl list-sessions and especially have a close look at the TTY number to know what to kill.\n\nIf you need, you may prepend the commands with sudo, e.g. if you try to kill another's users session. Though loginctl will deal with that by itself and ask you for a password if you need additional authentication.\nPossibly do not forget logout from your \"recovery TTY\" you've used (just type exit or logout – or, of course, kill your own session), as you likely won't need it anymore.\nIf you don't and someone clever sneaks in, they can access all your data there, as these terminal sessions usually won't lock/protect themselves.\nSomewhere (likely TTY1 in new Ubuntu versions; Ctrl+Alt+1) is your login screen.

I get a command line and now I just want to go and save my documents, pictures, ect. and just do a clean install. How do I access my files to back them up?\n\nA: You can use live cd and backup your data and then do fresh install. Choose Try Ubuntu in ubuntu installation process.\nIf you have a separate home partition you can recover your data if you donot format it during installation.[Although you can use the same mount point]\nFrom command line you could recover your data if you know basic shell commands:\ncd /home/YOUR_USER_NAME/ is the path where documents and pictures are located.\n Just do cp to copy your data.

With the default CPU speed setting of \"on demand\" I get 100 % CPU usage.\n\n\n*\n\n*In System Monitor (nb: view > all processes) the dominant process is Xorg with 60 - 70 % CPU usage (and 13.7 MiB),\n\n*\n\n*followed by gdl-box with about 20-25 % and gnome-system-monitor with about 20 %.\n\n\n\nWas it a mistake to upgrade to Oneiric? How can I fix this? I now set the CPU speed manually to 1 GHz - but that can't be the solution...\nNot very happy...\nThank you.\n\nA: Luckily for you, high X.org CPU usage doesn't mean you have a bug in X, so this problem is likely something you can solve.\nX is a server, which means it responds to client requests.  If a client has lost its mind and is making excessive X calls (such as if it locks itself into a graphics updating loop), it can make a lot of X calls.  This shows up as a high X CPU load.\nSo, the thing to look for is to identify which client program is causing the load.  Often it is a program you don't realize is even running - perhaps a panel indicator or background task or service.  Look through your process table for user processes that look out of place, and try killing them one by one until the load goes down.  Then you know what caused it.\nAlternatively, log into a guest account; verify the load is normal there.  Compare your processes in the guest account with those in your regular account, and go from there.\nWhile high X cpu bugs are not at all unusual, I have not seen many reported in oneiric, so I might guess that the faulty process is some unusual program not installed by default; perhaps something you manually installed previously that got automatically upgraded to a new version that has a bug in it?  Anyway, good luck in your hunt.\n\nA: in my case it is gdl_box the tray program of google desktop search, causing high cpu loads since i upgraded to oneiric amd64 from natty amd64. after killing that process everything is fine cpu load and temperature going down immeadiately. as i was not able to find a solution i switched from google desktop search for linux to tracker and tracker-needle. to me it is not so satisfying as google desktop search but i can live with it. would be nice from google to update it one day but from a german computer magazine i read that google is going to cancel a lot of services which includes their desktop search. what a shame...\ngreetings\npeter\n\nA: I sometimes have high X CPU loads caused by Firefox.
