["Q: Sparrow mail app seems to make my imac act funny I was wondering if anyone has experience with Sparrow mail app? I've just downloaded Sparrow and it seems to do something funny. \nFirst the volume thing self disabled and when I tried to flip the screen to another screen back and forth, it enables itself again then it disable again and like that on and off for some period of times and I've tried to restart it like 5 times and now the volume problem seems OK now.\nBut the wifi is acting funny. It kept disconnecting on and off I've restarted it twice now and still the same. When I quit Sparrow, everything is ok. I've tried to open Sparrow an hour later, it did the same thing again with the wifi. \nWhy is that? Is it because of the Sparrow app? I'm running latest os x lion 10.7.3.\n\nA: When first launched, Sparrow can be pretty intense on your harddrive and internet connection, since it's downloading every email.\nAbout the column thing, it was probably still syncing your labels and everything, and that's probably why it was misbehaving.\nAbout your WiFi issue, it could be the same thing, since Sparrow is downloading every email, you WiFi router or connection is probably too weak to handle the load and crash.\n\nMy advice would be to delete your account from the app, connect to a wired connection, re-add your account and wait 20-30 minutes (depending on the number of email you have and the size of your inbox).\n", "Q: Messages beta hangs. How to remove it or at least its accounts? I've received a huge iMessage and now the App hangs. I can't remove the App, because it's only possible via the menu item which is not responding. Removing ~/Documents/iChat/* and ~/Library/Messages/* didn't help either.\nAny ideas of how to remove it or at least its accounts?\n\nA: Messages always hang on my Mac as well, error telling me no account set up etc, and restarting my Mac always helps to bring it back to normal.\n\nA: I had to remove com.apple.iChat and com.apple.Messages in ~/Library/Caches to get it working normally.\n\nA: Try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Navigate to /Applications/\n\n*Right-Click on Messages.app\n\n*Choose Get Info and uncheck the option to Open in 32-bit Mode.\n\n\nMessages should open normally, and then you can Uninstall as usual.\n", "Q: bash: brew: command not found I am new to mac and was following a video and typed export PATH=\"$HOME/opt/git/bin:$PATH\" I believe this messed up my path and I am not able to install MySQL now. When I tried to install homebrew I get -bash: brew: command not found.  I tried restarting the terminal and I am still getting this error.\n\nA: Restarting the terminal should have solved the problem since you didn't append what you have typed to a bash start-up file.\nAlso, even if what you have typed was directed to a bash start-up file it wouldn't affect where bash would find brew since you're prepending to the original path and not overwriting it.\nYour problem lays in something else you've done that has changed the settings for your path in a bash start-up file or have deleted/altered the location of the executable.\nWhy aren't you able to install MySQL? What errors do you get? What form of package are you installing? Is it from the MySQL official site?\nRecommended installation of brew makes it reside in /usr/local/bin/. Do you have that in your echo $PATH output? Also, normal brew installation is a simple command that doesn't need brew to start with. So do you mean you get -bash: brew: command not found after attempting the installation of brew?\n\nA: Unless you installed brew into /Users/<your_username>/opt/git/bin, adding that to your PATH won't help you find it.\nDid you instead install it at /opt/git/bin?\n\nA: brew is only for macs. oh!. i see you are using a mac. ok thn, open your terminal window. oh, its open. ok, then. i can help you no more. keep up the good work.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro: long time to wake from sleep, what could it be? I have a 2011 13-inch entry-level MacBook Pro, which was upgraded almost straight away to Lion.\nI consider myself a careful, conscientious user, not installing things I don't need. However, recently, my MacBook Pro has started taking a very long time to wake from sleep.\nI understand that it takes a long time to go to sleep, around 15-25 seconds usually. However, before, waking up was almost always instantaneous.\nI'd like to know if there are any terminal or gui-based tools that help diagnose this problem. I recently checked pmset -g assertions and that seems to be fine. Any other tools I can use?\n\nA: Updating my own question: it was a software issue after all. Avatron's Air Display server software installs a helper daemon that slows down the waking of my MacBook Pro. \nAfter uninstalling it, the Mac wakes up a lot more quickly.\n\nA: Do you or did you ever use a 3G dongle?\nI had a Huawei 3G dongle and it wasn't the most graceful thing when it came to resuming from sleep. Sometimes the software would poll a USB device that wasn't plugged in and you couldn't do anything until it finished its routine.\nCheck your LaunchItems and LaunchAgents folder (Users/ and /Library/) for scripts that aren't supposed to be there or no longer needed.\n", "Q: Gimp keeps on crashing with SIGSEGV error I am trying out Mac Gimp 2.8 as an alternative to Photoshop.

layers again? I need to get some work done here and it just crashes as soon as I have selected a font and tried to add some text. I also wonder if the PS and Gimp errors are related.\nI do have around 300 fonts installed. Macs and Gimp or Photoshop won't choke on that amount now will they..?!\nWhen I load Gimp running onder Xquartz based on the MacPorts package after I added all the new fonts it did not crash. So this could be an Apple X11 issue or other Apple native code issue as Gimp 2.8 running under Apple's X11 naively is still crashing.\nUpdate\nStill no fix. Just got a new crash. See http://pastebin.com/i7DtHMVD . Again tried to edit text in Gimp and failed.\nUpdate 2\nAdded latest Xquartz and upgraded OS to Lion. All is good now.\n\nA: I experienced the same issue with Gimp. Installing quartz 2.7.1 and then a log out and back in to point at xquartz instead of Apple's x11 has helped.\nThe text tool now works for me on Gimp v2.8.\n\nA: SIGSEGV is a signal that is sent from the operating system to a program notifying that it that is has accessed an invalid memory address. Since this is done by the program itself, there is really nothing that you a user can do to fix it. This is a bug in the software and someone familiar with the source code can probably easily fix it. I would suggest filing a bug report for the bug, if it hasn't already been filed, otherwise all you can do is sit and wait for it to be fixed.\n", "Q: Sync Safari bookmarks between computers I've got a lot of bookmarks in Safari on my iMac.

In my user folder there is a desktop folder with the other files that were missing from that FTP download I did. \nTo make matter even more confusing, if I click Desktop in the left hand favourites in Finder it takes me to the /.tsclient/ folder, but any apps that pull up a finder dialog for the purposes of loading/saving point to the on that is in my user folder, where the desktop should be.\nI didn't accidentally drag and drop my desktop folder into this folder (as .tsclient is hidden), I never type in an admin password for something if it pops up without exact knowledge of why it's there, and I wasn't doing anything out of the ordinary so I have no clue why and how it moved. But it has, and I want to move it back!\nI can't seem to delete or rename the one in my user folder, if I could I can't seem to move my desktop folder back out of that folder, it only wants to copy it. I guess I could move it using terminal but I have no idea what's going on and don't want to mess things up even more!\nDoes anyone have any experience of this bug or how to remedy it?\n\nA: Having a bit of trouble following your description of the situation. It'd be helpful if you used actual path names instead of \"The one in my user folder\" type descriptions.  \nYou have a backup right? Ok then...\nThe sidebar link is just a shortcut, so it doesn't really mean anything by itself.  Fix that last. Just delete it and then re-add it.\nRun a disk check and permission repair if you haven't already.  \nIf ~/Desktop doesn't exist and you're sure it was some how renamed .tsclient, use terminal to move/rename it back. I think its more likely that your ftp client uses that as a temp location and that the files there are only partially downloaded though.  \nIf ~/Desktop does exist then just move the folder contents back where they belong not the folder itself. Then delete and re-add to the sidebar \n\nA: If you have a Time Machine backup that would work, I would restore it to that. If not, I would try to just delete all the FTP'd files and move all of your Desktop files back to where they should be. Later you could try downloading it again from a different source (if possible, I don't know what you were downloading).\n", "Q: Mac App Store without admin password? Is there any way to use the Mac App Store without the administrator password? IE change it to install the app at ~/Applications instead of /Applications?\n\nA: According to one poster in an Apple discussion forum, this may be possible in Lion:\n\nThis is possible with Lion.\nThere is a _appstore group. All the users that are in this group are\n  allowed to install applications from the Mac App Store.   You can add\n  a user to this group with the workgroup manager (install server\n  admin tool first). Or by typing in this command on the terminal.\ndseditgroup -o edit -a shortusername -t user _appstore\n\n\nUnfortunately, this approach won't work in Snow Leopard or earlier versions of OS X. There also doesn't seem to be an option to install apps in a directory other than /Applications.\n", "Q: Glitches in OS X - memory or ssd? My laptop is Macbook pro 15', Early 2011, with an SSD drive - OCZ Agility 3 240GB. I changed my memory too to 16GB (Corsair from Amazon).\nI experience glitches:\n\nAlso Skype refuses to launch. I reinstalled it several times. Launched it from different locations.\nI have issues with Safari too. Sometimes it fails. Sometimes it doesn't start. I ran DiskUtility, I had file system issues. I fixed them.\nSo now I'm thinking this is from the memory or from the ssd. OCZ have no utility to check the drive status. I don't know how to check whether any files are destroyed or changed. I ran a memtest console tool to check the memory when I bought it - it was okay.\nSo now I'm looking for ways to diagnose where the problem is and fixing it.\nIn testing, some more chances to capture screenshots have provided these examples of the failure:\nWhen Chrome is on focus:\n\nWhen Chrome is not on focus:\n\nWhy would it work when not on focus? Makes no sense.\nOne full screen screenshot.\nHere are the steps I've taken to try and narrow down the cause:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have an external HDD, I'm using Carbon Copy Cloner to make a copy of my drive for backup issues. I used it as a startup drive - the issues persisted - Skype refuses to start (the process takes 100% CPU), Safari starts but doesn't work (100% CPU).\n\n*I have two graphics cards - Intel HD Graphics 3000 and AMD Radeon HD6750. I have a tool that manually forces the use of only the first one - to save battery. Now I switched to the other one for a little while and the glitches stay the same.\n\n*I have old RAM - original 4GB (Hynix) and 8GB (Crucial). I changed back to the 8GB and Skype starts first, but if I stop and then start it again we're back to where we were. With the 4GB (currently I'm with it) - it even didn't want to start. So now it looks like the problem might be with the ssd?\n\n*I noticed App Store and Software Updates fail to connect to the internet.\n\n*I went into safe boot (press Shift during restart) - now everything works - skype starts everytime, software update works (I updated lion to the most up to date version). I changed the memory back to the 16gb and tested again into Safe Mode - again everything works. Now everything seems like a software problem.\n\n*Most of the times Skype starts once correctly. When I restart - it fails until I restart. Could skype be messing up my machine?\n\n*Old version of Skype works - this is a temp solution.\n\n*I saw a solution where Little Snitch was blocking Software Update and App Store. I stopped my Little Snitch and they started working again. So these are fixed. The new skype still fails (sometimes the first time it works). Safari fails too. The glitches in the interface don't show up anymore. Everything works in Safe mode.\n\n*I'm researching what is different in Safe Mode and cannot find such a good answer.\n\n*I removed all software that had kext files installed (Virtual Box, Little Snitch, an antivirus).\n\n*Did I mention that I ran 2 free antivirus softwares that failed to find anything?\n\n*I stopped all login items for my user (dropbox, gfxCardStatus, Skype (old version).\n\n*/System/Library/StartupItems is empty, so nothing to do here.\n\n*My TimeMachine had a glitch and said it needs to create a new backup like it was just started for a first time. Now I see only the backups for the last day even though the old backups seem to be there (same space used in Time Machine's hdd).\n\n*I removed HWNetMgr, HWPortDetect and StartOuc startup items from /Library/StartupItems. They were from a Huawei 3G modem. In blog it was said that this would speed up my shutdown time. Now shutdown goes from 10 down to 1 second.\n\n*Startup time seems quite long. For a machine like this it is like 15 - 20 seconds.\n\n*The only remaining /Library/StartupItem is a wireshark's ChmodBPF. I removed it too - didn't help.\n\n*I reset the PRAM or whatever that is (Cmd + Option + P + R). Nothing changed obviously.\n\n*The laptop experienced two crashes in Safe Mode, which destroys all my previous assumptions that this is a software issue. I'm with the 16GB memory.\n\n*I cross-checked all processes running in Safe Mode and in normal mode. These stick out: DashboardClient, iStatLocal, iStatLocalDaemon, kextcache, lsboxd, mdworker, postgres. I'll remove postgres and check what the kext cache is.\n\n*Deleted Postgres. The rest of the /Library/LaunchDaemons/ gives\n\n\n*\n\n*com.apple.remotepairtool.plist\n\n*com.bjango.istatlocaldaemon.plist\n\n*com.bombich.ccc.plist\n\n*com.bombich.ccc.scheduledtask.1112C49C-F614-4B14-A06F-0933DCA55B5A.plist\n\n*com.maintain.CocktailScheduler.plist\n\n*com.microsoft.office.licensing.helper.plist\n\n\n*/System/Library/LaunchAgents gives a lot of com.apple stuff, the only non-apple things are org.x.startx.plist and org.openbsd.ssh-agent.plist. Full list.\n\n*I used plutil to \"check\" all plist files. /Library/LaunchDaemons/*.plist, /Library/Preferences/*.plist and ~/Library/Preferences/*.plist are fine.\n\n*Ran fsck -fy: \"Incorrect number of extended attributes\" and \"Invalid leaf record count\". I fixed them. DiskUtility said nothing.\n\n*ran fsck_hfs -f /dev/disk1s2 on the external drive. There are errors while the drive is read-only (mounted), no errors while it is not mounted. But no errors produced, I guess it says there are errors because it cannot read the drive.\n\n*Google Drive's app starts its process, but there's no window, cpu is 100%. The same behavior with Chrome (even though there's a window, WebProcess behaves the same way). The same with Skype. What's the common between them? an API?\n\n*I launched from the cloned CD and ran fsck_hfs -f on the SSD. It found no errors.\n\n*DiskWarrior found a lot of issues and fixed them all.\n\n*I ran the Apple's Hardware Test (AHT) from the original CD. No errors. I'll run the extensive test tonight. Still nothing.\n\n*The external hdd (used for cloning) stopped working. Is this the perfect storm? Now I have to recopy everything. This with the non working TimeMachine could mean that I can loose my data? What's going on?\n\n*After a restart, the external is somehow fixed. Frustration...\n\n*Did an extensive AHT Test (Snow Leopard DVD2). No errors.\n\n*Finally found where the logs reside (System Information). Errors - com.skype.skype[868]: DVFreeThread - CFMachPortCreateWithPort. com.google.Chrome[0]: DVFreeThread - CFMachPortCreateWithPort. com.apple.Safari[477]: objc[484]: Object 0x79e43160 of class __NSCFDictionary autoreleased with no pool in place - just leaking - break on objc_autoreleaseNoPool() to debug\n\n*I installed OS X clean on an external drive - all worked - Skype, Safari. All was fine.\n\n*Finally progress. I reinstalled OS X Lion on top of the SSD. It turns out that the installer installs on top of the existing system, so I didn't have to migrate anything. Now Safari works, Skype 5.x works, Eclipse works. Interestingly when I started Eclipse it said Java is not installed and it installed it. I didn't know the installer worked this way. I'm using the 8GB ram to make sure all is fine. I'll monitor carefully what is going on. I'll stop writing here until a problem occurs.\n\n*Problem again. I updated my machine with Software Update and now it fails again.\n\n*I started getting BSODs. http://pastebin.com/k7Yrn4Nk. This was with the 8gb memory.\n\n*I switched to the 16gb memory and now all works the old broken way.\n\n*I reinstalled. Now Skype works, Safari Works, VMWare Fusion works, SkyDrive fails, There are a few glitches, but this is the best state that my computer has been in a while. I'm not going to update, because I think that will do the damage.\n\n*SOLUTION (SO FAR): Then again all failed again. At some point even the laptop stopped recognizing the SSD as a drive. Then it started recognizing it again. I was so tired of all this, that at the end I was thinking of buying the new Macbook, but it being not easy to upgrade and actually not being any faster than what I have now made me think twice. I finally reinstalled it from scratch. I thought it would take weeks before I reinstall all the apps I had, but it took 2 hours, which was amazing - I just put all the apps in a list and some custom configurations too. Now it works and I hope it stays that way. I'm with the 16gigs of memory and the ssd drive. I hope this horror will never occur again. It actually looks like it was an ugly software bug maybe caused by something else. I actually don't care and don't want to know. I just don't want to experience it again. I then reinstalled my other macbook too and my iPhone. All of them now work faster and better. I guess OS X (and iOS) reinstallation can be as fulfilling as Windows reinstallation (which is definitely not a compliment). I just hope everything stays working. If it doesn't I'll just buy a new laptop (and I am thinking of a non-apple one).\nAs an epilogue: I learned a lot about the system, but then again I bought the MacBook so that I wouldn't have to learn. I bought it for the it-just-works experience and I didn't get it. All of the diagnostics failed. Finally the solution was the Microsoft Windows one - a clean reinstall.\nA year later: the laptop had major hardware issues which were unsolvable. Now I'm happy with a new Air.\n\nA: The best thing with troubleshooting is to isolate the issue and keep good notes when the issue comes and when it goes.\nOnce you also have an understanding how to make the issue ( in your case, is that glitch constant or does it come and go ) it is then very easy to systematically isolate things.\nIn your case, switch the ram to the opposite slots, run with only one stick, then the others. Try to find out if it's the ram slot or the motherboard or the ram itself.  Then you can isolate the sad by running a while on an external drive. \nRepair technicians are very familiar with this process, and due to the volume of work they do, have better feel for what fails more often, have the tools to test booting your Mac from a clean OS externally, etc.\nSo even though you may not be as fast, skilled or familiar with troubleshooting by isolation, you can still use the same methodology to isolate this failure on your Mac.\n\nA: First, make sure you are using ECC RAM with appropriate specs for your system.  Then check if you are getting ECC Errors (About This Mac -> More Info -> [System Report if on Lion -> ] Memory).  If there are no memory errors reported, it is not likely to be a RAM issue.  \nBased on my experience, the visual anomalies you show are most likely either a graphics card issue or a graphics card RAM issue, but that would not explain the failure of Skype to launch.  Bad RAM would explain the failure of Skype to launch and the visual anomalies, so it would be my first guess, but if there are no memory errors reported, then I would expect something more seriously wrong with the motherboard.\nThe only way I see it being a problem with the SSD is if it were drawing so much power or creating so much noise on the power bus that it was interfering with proper operation of the motherboard.\n", "Q: Foreign language entries appearing in Safari context menu I am getting some foreign language (Portuguese?) items appearing in my Safari 5.1.5 context menu, when I right-click on an element in a page (see below).

If I try to delete an event on iCal, it offers me these options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Cancel\n\n*Delete and Notify\n\n\nWhat if I want to delete without notifying?\nI'm running iCal 5.0.2 on OS X 10.7.3 using an Exchange account.\nEdit: Using an Exchange account.\n\nA: You can move the event to a local calendar. When deleting you will then get the additional option \"Delete & do not notify\".\n\nA: In the end, I created a new calendar specifically to move event invites to, which I don't want to see anymore. Then I hide that calendar.\n\nA: As Feuermurmel says, you can create a new calendar and move it there.  But instead of hiding the new calendar, you can just delete the calendar.  Worked well for me; the event is gone with no notifications.\n\nA: I ended up doing the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*create a new iCloud calendar\n\n*select the invite, and chose the new calendar in the calendar drop down on the info pane on the right\n\n*select and right-click the calendar on the calendars pane on the left and chose delete\n\n*pick the option delete and do not notify\n\n\nI hope this helps.\n\nA: If you use iCloud the Calendar App will not allow you to create local calendars.\nThe following answer helps.\n\nA: A couple of years ago I wrote a script to do this. It's all at http://thefragens.com/blog/2010/04/dont-send-ical-replies/\nThe gist of it is the script will automatically alter an AppleScript inside the iCal package. It does not effect the code signing. The script also has a method of reverting itself. You'll likely have to install the changes each time iCal is updated. \nNB: It won't work with Exchange accounts.\nThe zip file has the install bash script, a modified and an unmodified AppleScript.\n\nA: Instead of deleting, cut the event and it will be gone:)\n\nA: If your calendar provider has a web interface, you can instead delete it there.

This works because of OSX's resolver magic.

I am a kind of person who likes to keep their phone out without a case most of the time (except for outdoor sporting trips), so I have a full body invisible shield which does NOT work well with any cases I try because of the added size on the antenna sides. The best solution I found was the Defender OtterBox, but that renders the invisible shield ruined after applying the case.

This, of course, means that it's a nightmare to get it all onto the external drive.\nI think I've gotten the music and track info all sorted out, but now for some reason, when I sync my device to my library, it's removing every single application from the device.  On closer inspection, my 'apps' folder in iTunes is completely blank.  I'd like to not have to re-download everything since I had close to 14Gb of apps.\nIt turns out I'd copied the 'mobile applications' directory from my PC iTunes folder to the new drive without leaving a copy of it behind.  When iTunes looks for the applications, it's still looking in the old location.\nI think I can temporarily avoid the problem by copying the app files back to their original location, but I'm wondering if there's a way to manually re-target iTunes's apps folder to a specified location.\n\nEDIT:  So I copied the app files back, and iTunes is still coming up blank when I try to see the apps in my library.  How do I figure out where iTunes is looking for apps?\n\nA: You have to go into advanced preferences in iTunes and you should see a box displaying your current iTunes Media folder location, with a button prompting you to change it.\nIf you select your folder there it should work for you. \nEDIT: \nA better way to move your iTunes content, is to move your entire iTunes library (you ~/Music/iTunes folder) into a new location. Then close and reopen iTunes while holding the Option key, when prompted to choose an iTunes library select the new location and everything should be stored in that new iTunes library folder (you can actually name the folder whatever you would like).\n", "Q: How do I give focus to the correct window when closing another application's window? On Lion, if I am in Chrome and click on an alert from Outlook that says I received an e-mail, I get a new window from Outlook with that e-mail on top of Chrome (I can still see Chrome immediately under my Outlook e-mail window). When I close the e-mail, I would expect the OS to re-focus on the Chrome window (since that's where I came from), but in fact it pulls the Outlook window out and gives it focus instead.\nIt appears that Lion tries to keep focus on a particular app rather than a particular window. Is there any way to change this behavior so that my interaction with the window \"stack\" makes sense?\n\nA: This has been the behaviour in OS X's window system since at least the original OS X (10.0), and probably is consistent back to Classic Mac OS (if that's the case, it likely dates back to System 7 or System 6 with MultiFinder).\nIn any case, this is how it is: to my knowledge, there's no way to change it.\nThe best you can do is to not leave Outlook's window open all the time. The app won't quit when you close the main window like it does on Windows.\n\nA: Would it work for you if the application that mouse pointer is on to have focus? If so, this thread would help:\nFocus-follows-mouse\nThis might not be exactly what you were looking for, but I think it might solve the issue. \n", "Q: How do I make a shortcut command in terminal? I want to have ll as a shortcut for ls -ll. How can I add it to my Termianl application? I use iTerm as my primary Terminal application. I wish there was a single line command solution for it.\n\nA: Add it to your .bash_profile by running nano ~/.bash_profile and adding\nalias ll='ls -ll'\n\nControl + X, then Y, then Enter to save the file.\nRestart Terminal. ll should now be an alias for ls -ll. Use it like you would any other commands.\n", "Q: What is the difference between .bash_profile and .bashrc? To make an alias for the Terminal in OS X, you can either put the aliases in .bash_profile or .bashrc. What is the difference between the two and why would I choose to put aliases in one and not the other?\n\nA: X11 will look at your .bashrc while a \"regular\" Terminal will look at .bash_profile\nHowever, if you add the following to your .bash_profile, you can then move everything into your .bashrc file so as to consolidate everything into one place instead of two:\nif [ -f $HOME/.bashrc ]; then\n        source $HOME/.bashrc\nfi\n\n\nA: .bash_profile is executed for login shells, while .bashrc is executed for interactive non-login shells.\nWhen you login (type username and password) via console, either sitting at the machine, or remotely via ssh: .bash_profile is executed to configure your shell before the initial command prompt.\nBut, if you’ve already logged into your machine and open a new terminal window (xterm) then .bashrc is executed before the window command prompt. .bashrc is also run when you start a new bash instance by typing /bin/bash in a terminal.\nOn OS X, Terminal by default runs a login shell every time, so this is a little different to most other systems, but you can configure that in the preferences.\n\nA: For macOS, the code to put into .bash_profile to consolidate everything into .bashrc is the following:\nif [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then\n    source ~/.bashrc\nfi\n\nThis is more specific for Mac terminal user.\n\nA: TLDR; use .bash_profile for your aliases. \nThe way the different initialisation files work together is a bit more complicated, and there are some important special cases in OSX. Here are the highlights:\n\n\n*\n\n*Bash, on any platform, executes one of several different files depending on how it is invoked. The details are here. \n\n*OSX's Terminal App does something non-standard: it creates every new tab or window as if it were a login shell, which means that .bash_profile is called. Thus the TLDR advice above.\n\n*.bashrc is also an option, but that will be called every time you create a subshell (i.e., invoke bash), which can create inefficiency if you update a variable within it (e.g., PATH=/bin/foo:$PATH)\n\n*Other apps that have embedded terminals can choose to follow Terminal App's convention or not. Notably, Visual Studio Code, by default, does not. \n\n*Apps invoked via the GUI are not spawned from a shell. Thus, there are several competing mechanisms for setting environment variables for them to see, which have changed over the years. \n\n*Snippets that call .bashrc from .bash_profile are quite common.\n\n\nA: For ubuntu/debain I add this code at the end of .bashrc:\n if [ -f ~/.bash_profile ]; then\n    source ~/.bash_profile\n fi\n\nNow my aliases take effect in all new opened terminals(or tabs)\n", "Q: Access iCloud.com from iPhone I noticed that in the HTML of icloud.com there are meta tags for creating a webapp on iOS devices. However it is impossible to get to just icloud.com on the iPhone, instead it redirects you to icloud.com/iphone_welcome.\nAm I missing something? Or is this some future capability?\n\nA: Safari on iPhone will always be redirected to the welcome page. AFAIK there's no chance to just access www.icloud.com with Safari.\nHowever, you can try Google's Chrome Browser. It has an option to access a page in a desktop version. That will bring up the original iCloud page with the login dialog.\n", "Q: Vector dot product and scalar multiplication in Grapher.app I'm trying to play around with vectors in Grapher.app, but I'm getting an error when I try to A: multiply two vectors (specified as a vertical matrix) together, and B: multiply a vector by a scalar value. Here's my dilemma in picture form: \nAny ideas?\n\nA: If you want to multiply two column vectors don't you have to transpose one of them? I got the transpose operator by typing ^T. (That's caret + T, not Ctrl+T)\nI was able to multiply a vector by a scalar.\n\nIn your screenshot, the subscripts aren't consistent.

When I have a monitor plugged in at work (dual monitor) and I go to About this Mac -> More Info it says Graphics Radeon HD6770. But when I unplug the monitor and just use the laptop display (17\") It says Intel graphics. Is this normal? This is a brand new machine.\n\nA: Yes this is normal. Both the 15\" and the 17\" MacBook Pro have two graphic cards and use the Intel HD graphics for normal function and switch to the ATI Radeon when a more graphically demanding application is being run. Also when you connect the external display the ATI card kicks in in order to drive both of your screens. This is why you get the blue screen flash when you connect and disconnect an external monitor (the graphics source is being switched) \n\nA: Yes, this is exactly how it is supposed to work.  The MBP models have both a discrete and integrated graphics card.  You can even disable or enable the Automatic graphics switching in System Prefs - Energy saver - Automatic graphics switching.\n", "Q: What are the differences between SDRAM and SO-DIMM RAM, and which should I use for my iMac? I've started virtualizing Windows 7 on my Mac and I've realized 4GB of ram simply isn't enough for listening to music, surfing the web, virtualizing Windows, and running a compiler all at once.\nThe first thing I did was look on Apple's site and see what specs I needed to look for..I bought my iMac in the spring of last year so the specs for new ram are as follows: \n1333MHz DDR3 (PC3-10600)\nSo I read that and thought, okay, and then I read their price, $ 200.00 for just 4 GB. Wait a second, maybe a little out of my price range. Then I hit up sites such as NewEgg, and found some pretty good deals; however, I found that some of them were labeled SDRAM and some SO-DIMM, and I guess my question to you folks is: What are the differences between SDRAM and SO-DIMM RAM, and which should I use for my iMac? \n\nA: You're getting your terminologies mixed up.\nSDRAM (Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory) is just the type of RAM on a DIMM. In your case as you've stated it's DDR3 (3rd generation of Double Data Rate)\nA DIMM is a standard format Dual In-line Memory Module. These have different pins for the different types of memory specification, so a DDR3 module will have a different edge connector to a DDR2 module and so on.\nA SO-DIMM is a Small Outline version of a DIMM, hence the \"SO\". These were designed for laptops where full size DIMMs wouldn't fit.\nApple use SO-DIMMs in their iMacs now, so DDR3 PC3-10600 (10600 is the peak transfer rate, so going lower than this will be a bad thing for performance) SO-DIMMs are what you want to get.\n\nA: QUOTE FROM MAC BOOK PRO LATE 2011\nInstalling Additional Memory\nYour computer has two memory slots that you access by removing the bottom\ncase.

One of the neat things about OmniFocus is that you can add tasks to it by calling omnifocus:///add?name={query} from a browser, or launcher (like Alfred or LaunchBar). I'd like to know what other functions there are to call for it, and other apps as well.\nI poked through the info.plist of Package Contents of the app, but it only detailed that omnifocus:// was indeed registered as a custom scheme. And I couldn't find any reference to it on Omni's site as well.\n\nA: I like to use RCDefaultApp to manage handlers for protocols and URIs.

On Lion this directory appears to be a root only directory, and I don't want to have to run the edit command as root.\nHowever if I copy the edit command into /usr/local it won't launch textwrangler. I can see the \"edit\" process running but text wranger isn't launched.\nIs there a trick to getting edit working in /usr/bin? The other command line tools from textwrangler work fine from there.\n\nA: Sorry, but /usr/bin is still a root/wheel directory, so it is actually going to be worse to install the textwrangler stuff there.\nIn any case, in your terminal type\necho $PATH and see if /usr/local/bin is in the path.  If /usr/local/bin is in your path all the stuff you install there will NOT need root permissions to be run.  If it is not, you can add it as such:\ngo to /etc/paths.d/\ncreate a text file that you can call localstuff (or whatever)\nedit localstuff putting /usr/local/bin in it.\nExample:\n$ ls /etc/paths.d/\n50-X11   MacGPG2  TeX      TeXbin   git      julia\n\n$ cat /etc/paths.d/julia \n/usr/local/julia\n\n$ echo $PATH\n/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11/bin:/usr/local/git/bin:/usr/local/julia:/usr/local/MacGPG2/bin:/usr/texbin:/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin\n\nmake sure that your shell is a login shell in whatever terminal you are using, the OSX predicated way of adding stuff to $PATH seems to break if you do not use a login shell.\nAs I said though, chances are that /usr/local/bin is in your user's $PATH anyway, so no need to worry.  I'd also move all the textwrangler files you put in /usr/bin in /usr/local/bin to avoid future problems.  \n", "Q: Mac cannot delete file The item image212_tmp1987326278 can’t be moved to the Trash because it can’t be deleted.\nI don't know how that file appeared on my desktop but as I try to delete it I get the above error. Does not let me rename, move it or use \"Get info\" either. \n\nA: I recently had the same problem, and fixed it by opening Terminal.app and entering killall Finder. This effectively resets the desktop icons.\n\nA: There are 2 common reasons for this sort of thing:\n\n\n*\n\n*The file is locked by another process, common if say you have a graphics file that is currently being edited, for example\n\n*The file permissions do not allow you to change it in any way, because it is owned by another user, or has specific ACL (advanced permissions) set.\nYou can test for the first by either identifying the program that has the file open, or just rebooting, which should clear the lock flag on the assumption that you do not let it re-open all your application windows on reboot.\nIf it's still there, and you cannot delete it after a reboot, then ensure you are logged in as an administrator and try again.  If this fails, you can start to remove at a command line level but it shouldn;t need to go this far - if it is unable to be removed, I can expand the answer with command line options for removal.\n\nA: Sometimes it helps to log the user out, log back in, and retry the operation.\n\nA: *\n\n*Press Command ⌘, Option ⌥, and Escape ⎋  \n\n*A small window will open  \n\n*Highlight Finder in the window  \n\n*Press Force Quit  \n\n*This will cause the Finder to restart and will remove any \"stuck\" icons that no longer have a file attached to them.\n\n\nA: hold command then right click on trash then secure empty trash\n", "Q: iphone app now is Pending Contract will it be removed from the itunes store?

fs_usage will get to the nub of which specific files are being accessed.\nStart with sudo fs_usage -w and you can grep for things or perhaps find a stable PID to filter on. If the processes are coming and going too rapidly to track, you might need to fire up instruments or dump the launchd database to know what is polling all disks or just that specific disk.\nSorry I can't guess at the cause - but this tool helps me nail down all sorts of IO mysteries on Lion.\n\nA: Tracking down the executed commands can bo done with sudo execsnoop -v. \nIn this case the results were:\n2012 May 12 17:05:53     0  15465    161 sleep\n2012 May 12 17:06:13     0  15467  15466 ps\n2012 May 12 17:06:13     0  15468  15466 awk\n2012 May 12 17:06:13     0  15469    161 sleep\n2012 May 12 17:06:33     0  15472  15470 awk\n2012 May 12 17:06:33     0  15471  15470 ps\n2012 May 12 17:06:33     0  15473    161 sleep\n2012 May 12 17:06:53     0  15475  15474 ps\n2012 May 12 17:06:53     0  15476  15474 awk\n2012 May 12 17:06:53     0  15477    161 sleep\n2012 May 12 17:07:13     0  15480  15478 awk\n2012 May 12 17:07:13     0  15479  15478 ps\n\nWhere PID 161 is identified as:\n$ sudo ps 161\n  PID   TT  STAT      TIME COMMAND\n  161   ??

Every PC I have owned has the same problem. Constant disk access at specific intervals but no software debugger can capture or show what is doing the accessing. Unkown...\nSome hidden firmware glitch that has been copied a million times or a backdoor placed on all pc platforms sold to the public?\nI don't have the resources or the equipment to actually do line level tracing.\nIf I had friends in a lab somewhere I would get to the bottom of this.\nWhen all the tools and software developed keep you in the dark it is obviously by design and not a flaw. Another obscured agenda that makes everything worse.\n\nA: You also may be looking at the stack backtraces when disk writes are being issued using dtrace:\n# source: http://www.brendangregg.com/DTrace/DTrace_Chapter_5_File_Systems.pdf\nsudo dtrace -n 'io:::start /!(args[0]->b_flags & B_READ)/ { @[stack()] = count(); }'\n\nIn addition, there are hard drives that repeatedly load and unload their drive head when the drive is idle.\nCould this perhaps turn on the drive activity LED's as well?\nSee: ClunKiller - How does it work?\n", "Q: Why does me.com always redirect to Find My iPhone? I changed my Apple ID, and I have to confirm my old mail @me.com to my new id. But the https://www.me.com/mail/ will always redirect to \"find my phone\" (maybe some issue with my last iPod touch that was stolen).\nNow, how can I access my mail in me.com to confirm for my new ID? Or, why it's redirecting?\n\nA: It's likely that you migrated your MobileMe email to iCloud and you can only log into http://me.com to access the few things that remain. So, try getting your mail at https://www.icloud.com/\nIf you didn't migrate things, you may have to open a support ticket with Apple to have them look at your account. You can always try logging into the same URL from a new computer or clear cookies, caches in the browser in case it's something that isn't clean on the client side, but in all likelihood, the problem is on the server end and the application on the web server believes you don't have mail any more for your logged in account.\n", "Q: Checking apps for a \"GateKeeper\" Developer ID? Is there any way for a Mac user currently running Snow Leopard or Lion to check, maybe from the Terminal command-line, whether some application downloaded from the net was digitally signed with an Apple issued Developer ID?\nIf so, what might be the benefits for a Mac user to do such checking now?\nApple has been encouraging Mac developers to digitally sign their Mac applications with an Apple issued Developer ID, which Apple announced will be used by the Mac OS at some point in the future.\n\nA: If you have the developer tools installed, you can view the signing information for a binary using this command:\ncodesign -dvvv <path to app.app>\n\nThe output looks like this:\nExecutable=/Volumes/Big Disk/F376/Projects/<My App>\nIdentifier=<My Bundle ID>\nFormat=bundle with Mach-O thin (x86_64)\nCodeDirectory v=20100 size=3958 flags=0x0(none) hashes=189+5 location=embedded\nHash type=sha1 size=20\nCDHash=761b0d1XXXXXXXXXX0dc8dd42e38eb445fb5341f\nSignature size=8504\nAuthority=Developer ID Application: XXXXXX\nAuthority=Developer ID Certification Authority\nAuthority=Apple Root CA\nTimestamp=May 7, 2013 3:07:59 PM\nInfo.plist entries=30\nSealed Resources rules=4 files=128\nInternal requirements count=1 size=224\n\n\nA: Without getting too far off topic, you can check whether any binary has been signed in preparation for Gatekeeper by using the otool or pagestuff command line tools that Xcode will install as part of the optional downloads.\n\nIf you don't want to install these, you can also use xcode-select and xcrun to run these tools from where they sit within the Xcode app that is downloaded into /Applications.\nHere is an app that appears to be signed and ready to go for Gatekeeper - MarsEdit\nmac:Applications me$ xcrun otool -l /Applications/MarsEdit.app/Contents/MacOS/MarsEdit |grep LC_CODE_SIGNATURE\n      cmd LC_CODE_SIGNATURE\nmac:Applications me$ xcrun pagestuff /Applications/MarsEdit.app/Contents/MacOS/MarsEdit -a | grep signature\nFile Page 241 contains data of code signature (x86_64)\nFile Page 242 contains data of code signature (x86_64)\nFile Page 243 contains data of code signature (x86_64)\nFile Page 423 contains data of code signature (i386)\nFile Page 424 contains data of code signature (i386)\nFile Page 425 contains data of code signature (i386)\nFile Page 426 contains data of code signature (i386)\n\nNow, this doesn't even start to tell you if the key is valid when checked against your keychain. That requires the developer to use a key that Apple has signed and Apple to have sent to your mac the appropriate signing key to verify that the developer key is \"trusted\".\nSince this is quite complicated, you could just turn on the checking (please save all critical work and PLEASE BACK UP YOUR MAC BEFORE DOING THIS) on 10.7.3:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo spctl --enable #if you don't know what sudo is you should skip this until you understand the wrong command could erase your system or your files. All of them, totally gone.\n\n\nIt looks like spctl is enhanced for 10.7.4 but I haven't explored it more than reading the man page for the tool. It clearly will be the way to check if a specific app is cleared or not as well as to perform lower level enabling / disabling of various rules and checks that will be support the marketing term of Gatekeeper.\nAs for why you might check, it would only be for idle curiosity or some sort of bragging rights if you are not actually a developer that needs to test this and be sure your code runs on both OS (Mountain Lion and Lion).\nFor most people, knowing what Gatekeeper is would be good enough. For the curious - here is a nice reading list:\n\n\n*\n\n*About Gatekeeper - from the desk of Steven Frank at Panic\n\n*Turning on Gatekeeper in Lion 10.7.3\n\n*Detailed Gatekeeper engineering documentation - an ideal sleep aid, perhaps?\n\n", "Q: Main monitor goes black when using external monitor on MacBook Pro This problem happens occasionally frequently with my Macbook Pro. When I plug in one or more external monitors, the main monitor goes black. When I try Detect Displays it does not register the monitor. I assume that this is something to do with a docking port or something like that, but I have no idea how to fix it.\nThis started occasionally, but now it is happening relatively frequently. Generally, it will either happen within 5 min. of (first) boot or it won't happen at all. Sometimes it does not recur after rebooting.\n\nA: If this is an occasional event - it's often just that the signalling didn't work between the GPU detecting the monitor or the monitor reacting to the input.\nSomething that never ever works or that you can reproduce at will (or perhaps statistically one time in 10) makes it easier to troubleshoot. From your description, it's hard to tell if it's a normal thing where the pairing isn't always perfect or if indeed something could be made better in the software / hardware / connection.\nSince its happening regularly, you will want to have a piece of paper or equivalent to log to the second when it happens and just note what you were doing when you notice the black screen. After 10 to 20 log entries, usually a pattern arises and you can also look over the diagnostic logs with the console app to see if there are messages indicating why the gpu is not working normally. \nThese logs will be invaluable if you want to seek support from either the monitor vendor or Apple. If the logic board or GPU are failing, this will get worse rapidly, so if it remains more or less steady, then you'll want to try isolating software if possible as a good next step to troubleshoot this. \n", "Q: MacBook Air attempting to shutdown after a couple of seconds of inactivity I have a a MacBook Air that works fine except popping up a shutdown dialog if left untouched for a couple of seconds (seems to be a consistent duration around 3 seconds or so). Hitting Cancel or Esc prevents the shutdown.\nIf I keep fidgeting around with the keyboard or trackpad, there's no shutdown attempt. I can even place something on the Fn key to keep the OS from shutting down.\nIt seems like some inactivity timeout etc. gone awry.\nWhen taken to the Genius Bar for initial assessment, the guy there said it was probably the power button needing a replacement. But, I don't think this is the case, as the power button is functioning normally: I can still press it to explicitly initiate a sleep/shutdown.\nThere's a chance this was triggered by water damage. There was a recent water spill incident to which I acted quickly by turning off the machine + turning it upside down + not using it for a long while + keeping it in a box with rice to absorb any leftover humidity. But even if this is a water damage, I can't imagine a damage that manifests itself with this very narrow malfunction of wanting to shutdown on a short period of in activity. Absolutely nothing else seems to be wrong with the machine.\nAny pointers? Any things I can try to (a) diagnose the root cause fix or workaround the problem?\n\nA: I have the same issue with my Macbook Air after a very small amount of coffee hit the keyboard. Apple store wanted to gut for $800+. It was less then a year old and I was dropping another $800 into it. What has worked for me for the last 6 months, I pressed the eject button down and wedged a toothpick to hold it down, than cut off the excess. Everything works perfectly and since I don't use a external drive that key was unused. I also found it was the only key that didn't interfere with other functions. I would love to find a programmer who could write a script that when the key is pressed once it's on and pressed again it's off. That would be the perfect fix without spending hundreds of dollars. Any script writers??? :)\n\nA: I experienced the same problem. Power-down window pops up every 10 seconds. You don't pay attention for a second, machine turns down and your work vanishes. I tried to find a way to block the power-button. Not the easiest to find. I almost gave up on it. Then I found this app. It seems to work for me.\nhttp://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/downloads/PowerBlock.zip\nI will probably try to replace the topcase & keyboard later when I get a chance.\n\nA: Apple just released a new update a couple of days ago, its supposed to resolve issues where your MBA randomly restarts. The update affects the SMC firmware. \nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/DL1627\nEverybody who's facing the same problem should install the update and give the solution a try.\nSadly the firmware update didn't work for me and now I'm stuck with my own workaround, have a look at the attached picture...\nI forced the eject button to be pressed down all the time with a matchstick.\nDo you guys think replacing the keyboard would resolve the issue? I'm actually thinking about doing it...!\nMacbook Air Shutdown Workaround with a matchstick\n\nA: Mine was doing the exact same thing after water damage recently.  I was worried it was the logic board but I replaced the keyboard today for $30 and it stopped prompting to restart!  Was much cheaper to fix than replacing the logic board.  I guess it must have been some corrosion with the power button.  \n\nA: I started having the same problem tonight. Would not have thought to connect it to water but I did spill a few drops on the keyboard (very small; I didn't even think anything of it), and it was immediately after that this started happening. \nAlso, when my iPhone went for a swim in a bathtub a few months ago, something similar happened. First, it would not turn off (bad news for drowned electronics). But then after being left for a few days in a warm place in a bag of rice and dessicants, it miraculously still worked... Except the \"power off\" slide-dialogue would show up frequently at random. (Eventually it stopped.) So I think this definitely has something to do with water. \n\nA: I finally took the device to the Apple store for repairs. Once they opened it, they noticed that there was extensive water damage. The cost of the repairs would be more than half the price of a new MacBook Air, so we decided to not go ahead with it. It's still fully functional except for this shutdown issue.\n\nA: I'm somewhat convinced this is a software issue, and not a hardware issue. I have exactly this problem too.\nThe reason I say \"software\" is that so many people are experiencing the same symptoms, whereas water damage may affect other keys, not specifically shutdown.\nI have a macbook air that I almost never update, because I have a stable system and use it for private developments, so I'm very careful about what gets installed, and nothing to my knowledge gets installed without my agreeing to it.\nHowever, Apple have been sneaky installing things when I haven't asked for them.\nFor example I am running 10.6.8 since I bought the machine. I don't have java or flash, so I don't need to worry about those \"issues\". But about July this year I started receiving pop-ups suggesting that I upgrade to Yosemite. Bizarre. I haven't been prompted to update to any of the other versions in between, so this comes out of the blue. That can only happen when something has been loaded to my machine, to check the version and issue the message. Is apple playing dirty?\nThe fact that the FN key can stop this, and the fact that the pop-up re appears after 4 seconds of inactivity (no pad touch, no key press) also indicates that a time is set off, and that there is some monitoring.\nI can't be sure, but I absolutely don't think this is hardware.\nEDIT I am now 100% sure this is software based. Last night I ran the hardware check, which requires restarting holding down the D key. The hardware check ran for more than an hour and found nothing, but the important thing is that the machine did not power down at any point. I didn't have any keys held down or any such tricks, and nothing happened. \nIn addition I carried out a timing check. This is not an intermittent problem, it is triggered just after 4 seconds of inactivity. So you can use anything to prevent it from happening, touching the pad, holding any key down, moving a mouse, etc... but as soon as 4 seconds of inactivity has passed the message returns. This is therefore a programmatic thing. Some code has been changed somewhere that waits for inactivity, and then triggers this.  \nEDIT Spelling\n\nA: My 2012 11\" Air developed the same problem today after a miniscule drop of water splashed onto the spacebar from watching my kids at swimming lessons. Although I was well back from the pool - a small drop did reach the keyboard - I quickly cleaned it off in seconds - but the problem immediately developed.\nSolution - I simply have gently wedged the function key down and this prevents the shutdown message completely.\nI'm not going to waste time going to Apple to fix it. I only use this machine for client meetings in any case. And not so much for hard work.\nNote that it also doesn't come up while doing a lot of typing like I'm doing now.\n\nA: I am MCSE MCP a+ Cert Network engineer.  Same issue with customer MacBook pro.\nMachine would shutdown 2 mins into boot safe mode better but still shutdown.\nI have taped the shift key down and it is allowing me to reinstall OS X 35 mins in.\nIf the keyboard is replaced im guessing everything will be fine.  \nYes a piece of grey duct tape on the shift key is a workaround.\n\nA: I guys. MB MIDDLE 2010 8GB RAM 128Gb SSD. I've got the same issue. Power window pop-up and the shutdown. I now have a new hard drive and RAM (i thought it could something with this parts). I performed a clean install of OSX Yosemite. After that i did a dowgrade to OSX Mavericks, still no good... And as @T9b i did a hardware test overnight & day and it worked fine and without crashes or errors of any kind! I'm now with toothpick... anyone found a resolution?\n\nA: I had a similar problem described on another duplicate question. Following @Steve's advice on holding the eject button, I used a paper clip to do so, fortunately I didn't experience any sudden shutdown so far :)\n\n\nA: I just want to let everyone know that this link worked for me. \nI've Macbook air (mid 2011). I had dropped liquid over my mac. even when i cleaned it, it burnt my keyboard part etc. Anyway, I paid $300 (in budapest) and get it done. However, after 2 weeks i got this problem. My mac was consistently asking me to shutdown. Note that this time i have not dropped any liquid. Anyway, when the message to shutdown came the only thing i could do was to cancel it but it was coming after every 10 secs. \nAnyway, I came to this page and saw this link for PowerBlock third item down\nhttp://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/labs/\ni have ran it. It's been 30 minutes after running this link and my mac has not asked me about shutting down. i presume that it has already solved the problem. Note that previously i was unable to run my mac even for 5 mins without getting this message.\nthanks\n", "Q: Link information between spreadsheets in iPad using Numbers Could you link to data in one spreadsheet from another using Numbers for iPad?\n\nA: No - there isn't an URL scheme or addressing scheme to make that sort of link.\nThis isn't something that even works on the Mac version of Numbers so at least there is parity across the OS in this case.\n\nA: Just digging into Numbers on iPad myself. A very useful way spreadsheets can be linked is via cell references. Perhaps this answers your question.\nI see the following in the Numbers documentation, in the section Data and functions: Types of arguments and values:\n\"If a reference is to a cell in another table, the reference must contain the name of the table... For example, [in Table 1 a cell could have a formula] =Table 2::B2.\n\"If the reference is to a cell in a table in another sheet, the sheet name must also be included ... =SUM(Sheet 2::Table1::C2:G2. ... Note the double colons.\"\nThis is familiar to users of Excel, as far as it goes; I see now that it only works within files and not between them.\nHTH\n", "Q: Lion iCal calendar event shows up as grey rather than colour of calendar it belongs to I have an item in iCal that shows in grey rather than the (blue) colour of the calendar it belongs to.\nIt also has an interrupted border rather than a flawless border.\nWhat does that mean?\nUpdate: It shows up in the correct colour (blue) on the Web interface.\n\nA: If someone has sent you an invite and you have responded \"Maybe\", the Event will show up as described. \n", "Q: What's the maximum pid for Mac OS X? The Mac OS X Internals book states that the maximum process identifier is 30,000 and after that the kernel will start re-using pids.  But checking on my own system, via:\nps a | grep ps | grep -v grep | awk '{print $1}'\nI can see that I have pids that go higher.  Does anyone know if there is a pid_max explicitly set somewhere, like in Linux?\n\nA: Kyle's answer is still valid as of today. In case you want to verify that, here is a shell script:\n#!/bin/bash\n\npid=0\nfor i in {1..100000}; do\n  : &\n  if [ $! -lt $pid ]; then\n    echo \"Min pid: $!\"\n    echo \"Max pid: $pid\"\n    break\n  fi\n  pid=$!\ndone\n\nThis prints:\nMin pid: 100\nMax pid: 99998\n\n\nA: Looking at sys/proc_internal.h in xnu-1699.24.23, I find that PID_MAX is 99999.  The value is used in kern_fork.c in the function forkproc.  Looking at that function, process IDs are not assigned equal to PID_MAX, so the highest possible pid is 99998.\n", "Q: Never allow speakers sound during specific hours I don't want my computer play any sound through it's own speaker during work hours in weekdays. But I want to be able to listen to music using my headphones.\nI guess something can be done with Automator to schedule a bunch of commands in order to do this.\n\nA: You could try using breakaway and set up a simple applescript set volume output volume 0 to trigger when the headphones are unplugged. (And of course, you could set up another trigger to turn the volume back up when the headphones are plugged in again.)\n\nA: The simple solution would to always leave your headphones connected and lower the volume should you have music leaking from the headphones when they rest on the desk as opposed to on your head.\n\nA: Breakaway is no longer maintained on its website, but it can still be downloaded from Sourceforge.  I've associated it with the following two AppleScripts to mute the speaker and pause Spotify when the jack is disconnected, and to play Spotify when the jack is connected.  Follow the instructions on makeuseof to see how to author AppleScript and connect it to Breakaway.\njack-disconnected.scpt\nset volume output volume 0\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set MyList to (name of every process)\nend tell\nif (MyList contains \"Spotify\") is true then\n    tell application \"Spotify\" to pause\nend if\n\njack-connected.scpt\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set MyList to (name of every process)\nend tell\nif (MyList contains \"Spotify\") is true then\n    tell application \"Spotify\"\n        if player state is paused then play\n    end tell\nend if\n\n", "Q: What (hardware/software) projector setup is needed to project both displays? I have a (non-Thunderbolt) 17\" MacBook Pro connected to an external display. I want to project both screens (from MBP and external displays) each onto separate screens.\nIs there a way to do this?\nAnd how to set it up?\n\nA: You basically need to have your macbook output to two displays, which it won't do easily/willingly.\nThere are a couple hacks...either doing the display output over USB or using a matrox display. See more info: here\nOne really hacky solution might be to output via air display to and iPad (hooked up to a projector)for the 2nd monitor. I'll buy you a beer if you make that work. :-)\n", "Q: Can the iPad Mail app show the message list full screen? I just got an iPad (not an iPad 2) and I would like to see the list of messages in the Mail app full screen and not just in the side bar, like they are now. Is this possible?\n\nA: Sorry no, Mail.app on iPad only has two views.\nIn Portrait mode, the message list slides in from the left.  You can swipe left and right to change the view to account and folder list and back again, however you cannot resize the pane, although it feels like you should be able to in this view.\nIn Landscape mode, the message list is permanently fixed in position and width; you can no longer swipe to change the content.\n\nA: this is not a solution but I just noticed this behaviour.\nif the email has a link in it, click it to launch safari. At top left corner of the screen there is in small font an triangle/arrow you can click to return to the mail app. When I click on that it returns to the email in full screen without the email list pane on left side. Mind you the mail msg still does not span the full width of the screen in landscape. And I'm not sure if this is replicable in all emails with links.\n\nA: I had the same question. Just by chance I gave a good tap to the message and it popped up without the sidebar.\n\nA: no, you can't. I have an iPad and I can't access all messages at once, sorry.\n\nA: No that is incorrect, at this time it cannot be swiped away or hidden or resized etc. however I did find a patchwork solution for the moment that accomplishes full page reading until Google execs use their own app & see the glaring design flaw & do an easy code fix. Here it is: simply tap on forward or reply & then when the email opens full screen for sensible reading, just tap the lowest right iPad keyboard key that closes the keyboard & when thru reading your email full page just hit cancel & delete the \"draft\" message you created. Just a few seconds really & one feels slightly foolish in this techno age & with Google to have to do this at all, however it works great....\n", "Q: gptsync showing blank GPT and MBR partition table background\nI have Lion 10.7 and Windows 7 64 bit (Boot Camp) installed on my Mac Mini.\nThey both boot fine.

For some reason, I keep getting an error when I try to install an OTA update on my iPad. The update downloads without any issue, and I have over 1 GB of space free. I am currently facing the issue with the iOS 5.1.1 update. Screenshot of error below.\n\nI faced this issue with the 5.1 update as well, and ended up using iTunes for the update. I have the 16 GB wifi model of the iPad 2. Restarting the iPad doesn't help either.\nMy 3rd gen iPod touch has no issues with the OTA updates. This seems to be a common problem, and people have faced it on different devices as well. No one seems to have found a foolproof solution so far on the net.\nIs there any fix for this, as the iTunes route is a much heavier download.\n\nA: if you download updates very soon after Apple releases them, they can sometimes get corrupted because the server is sending you the individual packages at the same time as it it send them to many other people. You may just need to wait a while and try again.\n", "Q: Latest Model 13\" MacBook Pro i7 - Disk slow beyond belief It seems that all disk operations are 50x slower. Reboot time = 15 minutes.

This has been going on for 3 days now.\n\nA: Have you tried booting from the install disc and running the disk utility?\nOnce you get booted from the disc you can go to the menu and start the disc utility.\nYou can run verify disk to make sure it isn't a problem with the drive.\nYou can also check the permission's on the disk to see if that is the issue.\n", "Q: How to move iTunes’ Mobile Applications folder to an external hard drive I wanted to have more free space on my MacBook Air’s internal hard drive, so I moved drives iTunes media folders (i.e. Books, Mobile Applications, Movies, Podcasts and TV Shows) to my external hard drive. Then I used symlinks to link the old locations to the new ones.\nAccessing my media is not a problem in any way, but when it comes to updates or new podcast episodes this will simply not work out.\nApplication updates and podcasts will be kept in the downloads folder within the iTunes Media directory on the internal hard drive. They won’t get moved to the right location and so iTunes still shows the apps as outdated (i.e. I could start the update again and the files will be stored in downloads once again)…\n\nA: This may not be the answer you are looking for but if you simple want to move you entire itunes library contents onto an external harddrive the simplest, best way in my opinion, is to move your entire ~/Music/iTunes folder onto the external drive then point iTunes to open the library in that location. Its as simple as closing iTunes, moving the folder, and then while opening iTunes again hold the option key (shift key for windows). It will then prompt you to choose which library you want iTunes to open. What you're really selecting is the iTunes library.xml file, but you can select your itunes folder and it will find the file. \nIf you want to experiment you can do the same thing while opening itunes and create a new library in a new location to play with. \n\nA: iTunes lost the ability to follow symlinks when organising media a few updates ago (see this answer of mine on Super User). As you noticed, it will find its assets in symlinked folders, but it will not put new assets there.\nConsidering you have already moved the brunt of you iTunes media, a simple solution may be to move the whole media library to the external drive, which is supported by iTunes: you’ll find the option in Preferences » Advanced (move back your symlinked folders to their source location before you do). See Apple’s instructions on this for a detailed how to.\nIf you absolutely must move only parts of your assets, there is another, somewhat less convenient way: iTunes will happily manage files stored anywhere by expressly storing the path to them in its library (which is exactly what it does when you uncheck the “Keep iTunes media folder organized” option in preferences). If you would like iTunes to manage your library but for some relocated part, TuneSpan will leverage this ability to link a subset of your files stored somewhere else into the library.\n\nA: I manually moved the mobile applications directory to an external drive, then added the new location to my library.  It asked to replace the existing entry in the library one at a time.\nWhile the import worked, there are no entries in the library.xml file for some reason.\n", "Q: Is it possible to share an Ethernet connection to a secure wireless network in OS X on a MacBook Pro? I can share my Ethernet Internet connection to WiFi clients using System Preferences, but I'm wondering if/how I can make that network secure (WPA) and not broadcast the network name?\n\nA: Go to the Search bar\nSystem Preferences -> Sharing ->  Internet Sharing - Share your connection from ethernet -> to computers using Wifi -> Wifi Options -> Security WEP 128 Bit\nThis thread is the same as\nHow to share internet with WPA/WPA2 security?\n", "Q: Unable to unlock disk after enabling FileVault2 I just enabled FileVault2 with my personal account. After the necessary reboot my user is not able to unlock the disk which just started to be encrypted.\nThe only way to get access to my computer is to quickly lock in with another user account to unlock the hard drive, log back out and now log in to my normal account.\nI already tried an approach I found while googling which advised to remove my user account's password which automaticlly removes the ability to unlock the disk. Then I rebootet, reset a password and enabled my account to unlock the disk via the standard dialog in the system preferences but this makes the system preferences crash. If it makes any sense to append the crash report to this question, let me know.\nAny help or approach to resolving the problem will be highly appreciated. :)\n\nA: This is a bug in Filevault2.\nI'm German as well. :) What happens here is that the keyboard is reset to the US keyboard layout. As the keys are changed - especially non alphabetic keys - you're probably typing a different password.\nYou can enable to show the input method in System Preferences > User & Groups > Login Options.

I have a Dropbox account, and an iPad.  How do I sync the Dropbox account to a native folder on the iPad so that I don't have to manually open the Dropbox app to open/edit a file, find attachments for emails, etc.?\n\nA: Unless you jailbreak your device, you don't have direct access to the file system on iOS.\nI think you should continue to use the Dropbox App to access your files.\nIf you want an jailbroken alternative, I let someone else answer because I'm not an jailbreak expert :-)\nHope this helps ! \n", "Q: What is causing this repeated kernel panic?

That in itself is not a problem.\nI also have an Airport Extreme (version 7.6.1) as the backbone of my home network using ADSL to my ISP. That in itself is not a problem, either.\nBut the combination of the two is a major problem for everybody in the house. Especially those that play online games...\nWhenever I connect to the company network, I can see the ping latency go from 20 ms to 600 ms for the ADSL leg. And is not just from my machine, but for every machine in the house. Which should mean the problem is in the Airport.\nI have of cause been looking at all the usual sites, but cannot find anything similar reported before...\nWithout the VPN connection:\ntraceroute to dr.dk (195.137.194.128), 64 hops max, 52 byte packets\n1  10.0.1.1  3.293 ms  0.784 ms  0.693 ms\n2  nn.nn.nn.nn  19.489 ms  18.837 ms  23.681 ms\n3  ...\n\nWith the VPN connection:\ntraceroute to dr.dk (195.137.194.128), 64 hops max, 52 byte packets\n1  10.0.1.1  2.515 ms  0.553 ms  2.898 ms\n2  nn.nn.nn.nn  688.489 ms  650.996 ms  690.190 ms\n3  ...\n\nSo the question is: Does anybody know what is going on here? Do you know of any solution? E.g. should I downgrade the Airport software?\n\nA: It's more than likely the bandwidth used by your VPN rather than the Airport itself.\nMy work VPN connection with a corporate laptop used to use a lot of bandwidth, I'd notice other stuff slowing down considerably. Maintaining links to the domain servers, a VOIP client, and all of the other things installed on there used a lot of resources.\nWhen I stopped using a corporate laptop and connected my personal laptop through a web based SSL VPN with terminal services instead, things improved a lot as it was only basically screen sharing rather than uploading and downloading actual files and data.\nUnless you can set-up a proxy and monitor the usage of each device, you're not really going to find out how much bandwidth each device is using, but it's unlikely to be the VPN itself, or the Airport at fault, just the bandwidth used by what's being transferred over the VPN.\n", "Q: Memory usage on Mac OS, how Activity monitor works? I have these stats, but is the system really using almost 4GB?\n\nThis Inactive memory... Can't I use it? How should I interpret these stats?\n\nA: I suspect you probably are using Mac OS 10.7 which is very memory hungry. As noted by kccqzy, the purge command may reclaim some inactive memory if you have XCode installed. \nSomething you should try is closing and reopening applications which are memory hungry or have a tendency to leak memory (Safari, Firefox). Alternatively, restarting your computer would also accomplish the same though take considerably longer.\nTo answer the question, are you really using 4GB of memory. Yes. Technically more if you take note of the \"Swap used:\" stat.\n\nA: Yes, you can. Fire up Terminal.app and run purge. It will force disk cache to be purged. It is likely that the inactive memory will become much less and more free memory will become available. A temporary side-effect is that your system will be a bit slower just after running purge.\nEDIT: If you cannot find the command, you may have to install Xcode, which is available for free from Mac App Store or Apple Dev Website.\n\nA: You're only using three GB, not four.  Both Inactive and Free memory are available for applications to use.  The difference is that Inactive memory is memory that used to be in use.  It will retain its contents until it is needed for something else.  That way, if the same program that used it before runs again, OS X doesn't need to reload anything that is still in memory.  Free memory, on the other hand, is memory that currently has nothing of value in it.\n", "Q: How do I use pf/IceFloor to block an outgoing connection to an IP address? I am running an application that regularly phones home and reports a little more information than I'm comfortable with. I would normally add the reporting server's hostname to /etc/hosts, but the app does not perform a DNS lookup and connects directly by IP. I am looking to use Lion's built in PF firewall to achieve this.\nI understand that a commercial utility like LittleSnitch would make this a trivial endeavor. However, this is not a viable solution for me. I find their asking price too high, and the built in firewall should be able to do the trick.\nI've been using IceFloor to modify the PF configuration to block incoming connections with great success. However, I'm running into some problems blocking outgoing connections. From what I've read, the following rule should be correct:\nblock return-rst out quick on en0 inet proto tcp from any to xxx.xxx.230.191\n\nIt should block only TCP packets to that IP and reply with a RST packet. It seems to be blocking the packets properly, but instead of returning an RST packet, it is silently dropping the outgoing packets. This is causing the app to hang while it waits for the connection attempt to timeout.\nIs this rule written correctly to achieve what I would like to achieve? Has anyone else attempted something like this using PF?\n\nA: My friend, if memory serves me well, you will need to add \nnet.inet.tcp.icmp_may_rst=0\n\nto /etc/sysctl.conf, and then modify the running kernel-\nsudo sysctl -w net.inet.tcp.icmp_may_rst=0\n\nThat should do the trick.  If no /etc/sysctl.conf exists, here is a shortcut:\nsudo echo “net.inet.tcp.icmp_may_rst=0” >> /etc/sysctl.conf\nsudo chmod 644 /etc/sysctl.conf\n\nHope that resolves the inconsistency with PF.  \nF.\n", "Q: Can I devote more room to my voicemails? I have an iPhone 4S with plenty of space on it but I keep lots of voicemails...to the point where sometimes people can't leave me a message because my voicemail is full.  Is this an iPhone thing that I can adjust or is it strictly a Verizon thing?  Most of the voicemails I keep are of my kids...and I know I can save those off as audio files...but I'd rather just use the space on my phone.\nThanks!\nDrew\n\nA: Voicemail is handled by the carrier. The size of your mailbox depends on the plan & features you have with Verizon, not on the free space available on your phone. \nI doubt Verizon will keep old messages indefinitely, so if there are messages that are important to you, you should save backup audio files of them. Then clear out old messages to make space to receive new ones.\n\nA: Verizon Wireless WILL hold all iPhone voicemail messages indefinitely IF you do not switch from an iPhone. If you switch to an Android or other device, your messages will be lost permanently. The voicemail messages do not reside on the iPhone but reside on Verizon servers.\n", "Q: Simple Mac Photo Management app I don't want a digital asset manager but rather I'm looking for a Mac app that has similar features of iPhoto/Picasa but let's me work at the file level instead of a separate database. I tried iPhoto '11 with the \"Copy items to the iPhoto Library\" unchecked which takes me most of the way there but what I would like is that when I change a photo, I want that change applied to the photo file instead of on a duplicate.  And I don't want to Export to the file to see changes to my photos files.  I have 1000s of photos already on my drive organized the way that I prefer and I would I would like the photo files on my drive to be the master copy.   I was used the \"Windows Live Photo Gallery\" app which provided core photo management and editing capabilities.  Is there something similar on the Mac?\n\nA: There's Lyn which definitely allows you to work at the file level within your existing folder structure. However, it's editing capabilities seem quite sparse compared to something like Picasa or iPhoto. There's a free trial, so it might be worth a look.\n\nA: Pixa looks like a new and fresh attempt at doing this well, and I am eager to throw out both iPhoto and Picasa. \n", "Q: On OS X Lion 10.7.4 in Terminal.app I cannot type `C-M-@` or `C-M-%`, why? On my MacBook Pro running OS X Lion 10.7.4, there seems to be a keyboard issue. I first noticed this problem when I tried to use the default keybinding to execute mark-sexp and query-replace-regexp in emacs, which are bound respectively to C-M-@ and C-M-% by default. As I use emacs a lot, I really miss these two powerful features a lot.\nAs I don't have experience dealing with terminal types etc, I did some simple debugging within emacs:\n\n\n*\n\n*C-M-f and C-M-b work as expected. So control and option work well together.\n\n*M-%, M-< and M-> work as expected. So option and shift work well together.\n\n*C-S-backspace does not work. (But I've never tried this command before; the first time I ran it was today when I found it in the emacs manual.) But C-@ works as expected. So control and shift probably work well together.\n\n*If I am not mistaken, the command digit-argument is bound to C-9, C-8, etc. These keys do not work as well. I have made sure that in System Preferences.app I have turned off these keys for switching spaces. \n\n\nIn Terminal.app preferences, I have selected \"use option as meta key\" as it eases typing the emacs keybindings. I also tried to disable this option and use ESC but still to no avail. Any ideas?\nP.S. I launched X11.app and in the xterm window I started emacs. Using ESC as meta, C-M-% and C-M-@ work perfectly. In the Cocoa version of Emacs, these two work perfectly as well. So I guess it is a Terminal.app bug or probably there might be a setting or configuration switch I can tweak to make this work in Terminal.app?\nAnd here is the output of stty -a from emacs shell, hopefully it's useful...\nbash-3.2$ stty -a\nspeed 9600 baud; 0 rows; 0 columns;\nlflags: icanon isig iexten -echo echoe -echok echoke -echonl echoctl\n    -echoprt -altwerase -noflsh -tostop -flusho -pendin -nokerninfo\n    -extproc\niflags: -istrip icrnl -inlcr -igncr ixon -ixoff ixany imaxbel -iutf8\n    -ignbrk brkint -inpck -ignpar -parmrk\noflags: opost -onlcr -oxtabs -onocr -onlret\ncflags: cread cs8 -parenb -parodd hupcl -clocal -cstopb -crtscts -dsrflow\n    -dtrflow -mdmbuf\ncchars: discard = ^O; dsusp = ^Y; eof = ^D; eol = <undef>;\n    eol2 = <undef>; erase = <undef>; intr = ^C; kill = <undef>;\n    lnext = ^V; min = 1; quit = ^\\; reprint = ^R; start = ^Q;\n    status = ^T; stop = ^S; susp = ^Z; time = 0; werase = ^W;\nbash-3.2$ \n\nThe same command directly from the shell: \n$ stty -a\nspeed 9600 baud; 24 rows; 80 columns;\nlflags: icanon isig iexten echo echoe -echok echoke -echonl echoctl\n    -echoprt -altwerase -noflsh -tostop -flusho pendin -nokerninfo\n    -extproc\niflags: -istrip icrnl -inlcr -igncr ixon -ixoff ixany imaxbel iutf8\n    -ignbrk brkint -inpck -ignpar -parmrk\noflags: opost onlcr -oxtabs -onocr -onlret\ncflags: cread cs8 -parenb -parodd hupcl -clocal -cstopb -crtscts -dsrflow\n    -dtrflow -mdmbuf\ncchars: discard = ^O; dsusp = ^Y; eof = ^D; eol = <undef>;\n    eol2 = <undef>; erase = ^?; intr = ^C; kill = ^U; lnext = ^V;\n    min = 1; quit = ^\\; reprint = ^R; start = ^Q; status = ^T;\n    stop = ^S; susp = ^Z; time = 0; werase = ^W;\n$\n\n(Side-comment: It seems strange that the syntax for a code block is four preceding spaces. Are all StackExchange users expected to know how to use paste(1), sed(1) or rectangle edits?)\n\nA: In general, Mac applications that are expecting text input from the keyboard do not handle C-S combinations or C-digit combinations.  Programs that work with control-shift combos (like anything running under X11) do so by handling key events as events, not character input.  This is how they can differentiate between Tab and Ctrl-i, which both generate the same ASCII character. (You can read in detail how Lion (really Cocoa) handles key events if you really want to know.)\nHistorically (back in the Teletype days), there were only uppercase letters on the keyboard, and there were no caret (^) or underscore (_) characters on the keyboard (instead there were up-arrow and back-arrow). The shift key worked by toggling the 16's bit and the control key worked by zeroing the 64's bit of the 7-bit ASCII codes the keyboard produced.  \nWhat this means is that the control key had no effect for the 32 characters on the keyboard that already had their 64's bit set to zero (most of the non-alphabetic characters, including digits), and since the teletype was purposefully limited to upper-case letters only, the shift key had no effect on most of the alphabetic characters (and where it did have an effect, it produced a special character like @).\nAdditional weirdness was added in the migration to supporting lower-case text, as the control key combos were all typed without using the shift key but now the letter typed without using the shift key had changed, so the decision was to map control-lower-case to what had been control-upper-case.  But then what do you do with control-shift?  \nFor a while the problem was handled by having the control key also zero out the 32's bit, which is what differentiated lower case letters from upper case letters.  But eventually ASCII was replaced with Unicode and those kinds of duplicate key assignments were too much of a waste of keyboard space to be allowed to continue, so they got different mappings, and on the standard Mac US keyboard most C-S combos are unassigned. \nSo what you have run into is the legacy support for keyboard input running back to Teletype days.  The characters Terminal (and other OS X apps) do not support are characters you could not type on the Teletype keyboard.  As evidence of this, note that C-S-2 (C-@), C-S-6 (C-^), and C-S-- (C-_) all work, because those keys have been re-mapped since the ASR-33, where S-2 was \" (and @ was S-P), S-6 was &, and S-- was =,  but in general control-shift combos do not produce characters of any kind.  \n\nA: Just sharing,\nI've tried to customize those keys and by transposing option to command as meta but to no success.\nWhat I realize is Terminal.app does not recognize 4 button simultaneously. Or at least i think it didn't.\nHowever, this might help you to set your keybinding across software.\nI also found out other discussions related to this as well.\n(btw digit-argument works with M-{1..9}, doesnt with C-{1..9} like mentioned. weird)\n", "Q: Why does running afconvert result in error -43 I am trying to use afconvert to convert a .mp3 to .m4r.

Could someone please shed some light on what I am doing wrong?\n\nA: Drop the -o flag, I think. You are specifying input.mp3 as an output file, and then tone.m4r becomes the input file. See the output of afconvert -h.\n\nA: I tried to run afconvert -f m4af -d aac -o output.aac input.mp3 and it worked perfectly. And according to the man page, it probably isn't beneficial or necessary to use the -o flag, just afconvert -f m4af -d aac input.mp3 output.aac would be fine also.\nHave you checked the permissions? I tried to chmod 000 input.mp3 the file and subsequently rerun your command and it returned the same error. Try to run file input.mp3 and see if other Unix utilities can read that file. If so, I guess the problem is just that the error description from afconvert is not clear enough.

I've been happily using Legacy FileVault on my Macbook since I upgraded from Snow Leopard to Lion. Today, I decided to switch to FileVault 2 and went ahead and clicked the \"Turn On FileVault\" button. Everything progressed as described in the Apple OS X Lion: About FileVault 2 support document.\nHowever, I didn't turn off Legacy FileVault before doing this and was never prompted to do so by the FileVault 2 process. \nHaving let the process complete, all seems well. However, Legacy FileVault is still enabled for my home folder as confirmed by the fact that its still turned on in System Preferences ➔ Security and its also still pointing to /Users/.binarybob/binarybob.sparsebundle. I'm assuming there's now a double-encryption in effect for both the entire disk and also my home folder.\nSo, is it safe to turn off Legacy FileVault now? \n\nA: You are correct with your assumption that there is a \"double-encryption\" occurring. This of course has the result of causing a lot of drive thrashing to occur. Having previously had to fix numerous corrupt FileVaults, I would first back up the sparsebundle. Once that is complete, I would then disable Legacy FileVault. \nUltimately, the only real reason to maintain this setup is if there is reason to suspect there are others who possess login credentials (especially admin credentials) and are capable of mischievous behavior. Even under that scenario, my recommendation would be to encrypt the files which need to be kept secret using TrueCrypt and disable Legacy FileVault.\n", "Q: Compressed archive in Lion creates a root-level \"Archive\" folder in .zip file I'm trying to compress 5 files into an Archive.zip\nSelecting the 5 files and using Finder's built in Compress feature, the resulting Archive.zip contains a root level folder name \"Archive\", which in turn contains those 5 files.\nHow do I create an Archive.zip that unzips those 5 files without any containing folder?\n\nA: The resulting Archive.zip does not contain a root level folder name \"Archive\". It's only when you uncompress it by double-clicking that this folder is created. To confirm, try unzip -tv Archive.zip. So it's Archive Utility that is creating this folder when you uncompress.\n\nA: EDIT: The process that you are talking about would appear to be new, since I know it worked as I described it in the last 2 years.  So I'm guessing it changed either in Lion or Snow Leopard, Lion if I were to hazard a guess. \nI don't have a workaround as yet but I have replicated that functionality.\n~~~~~~~~~~~\nThe built in Compress feature will add All Folders and Files from the selection downwards, including the first selected item, even it it is a folder.\nTwo options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Don't use the built in functionality and use a 3rd party archiving tool that has more control\n\n*Select the five files inside the folder (but not the folder itself), then ctrl+click (right click) and then select Compress\n\n\nA: I have some software loaded on sites where they upload a zip file. The software unzips the individual files to its generated directory and points the image compression and resizing to that new directory. It worked great till recently when all of a sudden when we compressed files the zip extracted to an archive folder on the server, the software doesn't work on folders it works on image files. \nI tried everything and numerous archive apps, I then tried Hamster Archiver. It worked for me, no more does it extract to a new folder. It might help you.\nGood luck  \n\nA: The Apple GUI method is clean and neat for most folks to use, and the enclosing Archive folder prevents the inadvertent overwriting of files. In your case, you'll have to use the command line in Terminal to do what you want using the commands zip and unzip.\nRead the man pages for zip and unzip for a fuller appreciation of what is possible.\nStep 1: zip up the files\n• Run Terminal\n• execute:  zip /path/out_filename /path/in_filename\nYou can select multiple files (from different directories & disks, too) and drag from the Finder GUI into the Terminal window. Terminal will expand /path/ for you in this case.\nEx: zip ~/Desktop/all_zipped_up ~/Desktop/zip_me_up.txt ~/Documents/zip_me_up2.txt \nThis creates all_zipped_up.zip to the Desktop in this example.\nStep 2: unzip the files\nThe key to unzipping without creating an enclosing folder is to use the -j switch:\n• Run Terminal\n• execute:  unzip -j /path/out_filename\n• The expanded file(s) will appear at the same path as the source .zip file. You can also use the -d switch to expand into another path. According to the man page, the -d switch can go almost anywhere in the command line. I put it at the end because it is a logical place to put it.\nExample to expand to same path as the original archive:\nunzip -j ~/Desktop/all_zipped_up.zip\nExample to expand to alternate path:\nunzip -j ~/Desktop/all_zipped_up.zip -d ~/Desktop/New_Folder\n", "Q: Recovery when main account corrupt?

I have a jailbroken iPhone 4S on AT&T in Cambridge, MA. My location has unreliable AT&T coverage, and I can't use Verizon or Sprint (too much coverage = pilot pollution). It's got to the point where I can't even reliably initiate a call, and if I can, it'll get dropped within 10 minutes. AT&T has been no help.\nI get 2-3 bars on AT&T, so I can't use an AT&T MicroCell; those work best with no coverage, and they have handoff problems when you already have some reception.\nI would prefer to stay with my iPhone if at all possible.  What are my least-painful alternatives for making and receiving voice calls? So far, I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Google Talk via Talkatone. This is a very brittle app; after a few hours of network configuration, I was able to receive and place some calls, but it often crashes back to SpringBoard and it often sends calls straight to voicemail.\n\n*Skype via the native iPhone app. Their app isn't a great replacement for Phone.app; I have to re-enter my password frequently, remember to launch Skype after a reboot, have no way to silence a call while it's ringing (even flipping the \"mute\" switch doesn't stop it!), have poor integration with the native phonebook, etc.\n\n*Skype + AppFront. This adds a \"call with Skype\" button to Phone.app, but requires extra pop-up dialogs, doesn't handle Skype being offline or needing a password, etc.\nI've looked at Viber but AFAICT this only uses WiFi when both parties have Viber.\nWhat are my other options? I'd be happy to go as far as running my own VOIP server if it'd give me reliable phone service via my iPhone.\n\nA: The tweak Phone GV Extension integrates Google Voice into the normal Phone app. I haven't tried it myself, but it's pretty popular and has a free trial available. Here's a Lifehacker post that recommends it and also suggests an App Store app: GV Mobile +.\n\nA: To get inbound calls, set up an inbound-only US phone number for a Skype account via Skype.  These cost $60 for the year.  Then set up that number as a Google Voice call back number.  When someone calls your Google Voice number, GV forwards it to your Skype number.  Works like a champ for me down in Ecuador on my local carrier's 3G network.  You make calls via the native phone app using Phone GV Extension but have to answer calls inside Skype app.\n\nA: You can buy yourself a copy of Bria for the Iphone. I use it and prefer it over other earlier voip applications. It works well.\nNow sign up for a voip.ms account and set up a voip service to use. Wala. Dirt cheap calling via the iphone. You will of course need to be in a wifi area, or have data enabled on your phone.\nFull integration with native contacts, full options you would expect on a phone such as missed calls, call display, call history, distinctive ring settings, etc.\nVoip.ms offers unlimited flexibility in your phone service. Your own local number, or 1800 number, digital receptionist, call forwarding, global ring, voicemail, etc. etc. Text Messaging is also supported. You can even have multiple numbers across different countries. Or keep it simple. Its a reliable pay per service company, and it all looks and feels like your own phone number, which it is.\nIf you wanted, you could even set up a wired telephone (via a voip gateway box), and have it ring both your iphone, and landline.\n", "Q: Copy new files only - is this possible? Basically want to merge two folders I have a folder on Drive 1 called Music, and it is 100GB. I have a folder on Drive 2 called Music, and it is 116GB. It's the most updated version. How do I copy the Music folder from Drive 2 to Drive 1 without having to rewrite every single file?\n\nA: The merge option will only show up if you are copying (rather than moving) the folder. Make sure you hold option while you drag the new folder to the location of the old folder. Alternatively, using ⌘+c to copy the new folder and ⌘+v to paste over the old folder should give you the option to merge the files.\n\nA: \nUPDATE\nFirst install coreutils first. Run brew install coreutils. If you don't have brew installed... switch back to windows!\nCheck that cp --version outputs version cp (GNU coreutils) 8.^^\nThen you will have the correct cp version and the -u flag will work.\n\nCheck the cp command. Use man cp and read the options.\nYou can do something like: \ncp -r -u ~/source ~/destination\n\n-R, -r, --recursive : copy directories recursively \n-u, --update : copy only when the SOURCE file is newer than the destination file or when the destination file is missing\n-p same as --preserve=mode,ownership,timestamps \n-v --verbose : explain what is being done\n\nSo if you want to copy files from you Downloads/music folder to say your Music/new folder you would do something as: \ncp -ruvp ~/Downloads/music/* ~/Music/new/ \nThis would merge the contents of these two folders and if two files with the same name and path exist it would keep the newest one based on the timestamp.\n\nA: This is a classic use case for rsync:\nrsync -av /source-path/source-dir /destination-path\n\nrsync will copy only new and changed files to the new location.\nIt is important to understand how a trailing slash on the source argument functions.  If there is a trailing slash then the contents of /source-path/source-dir will be copied to destination-path.  If there is no trailing slash then source-dir itself will be copied to the destination and its contents will be another level down in the destination hierarchy.\nSo if you want to replicate one path to another include the trailing slash as follows:\nrsync -av /sourcepath/sourcedir/ /duplicatpath/sourcedir/\n\n\nA: Not sure why the default Lion Merge button doesn't show up for me. But I ended up using ditto. Found here: https://superuser.com/a/221599/102789\n", "Q: Are there any applications which integrate with OmniFocus? Besides Siri, are there any applications which integrate with OmniFocus.\nFor example, in my RSS reader or Twitter client, I would love to send items I wish to read later to OmniFocus instead of Instapaper or Readability.\n\nA: There's a list at http://forums.omnigroup.com/showthread.php?t=18931. Not a lot, I'm afraid. There's an API available but I guess there's not enough consumer demand for that feature.\nFor other apps, you might be able to make use of the \"Send-To-Omnifocus\" feature. From your RSS or Twitter app, forward the item by email to send-to-omnifocus@omnigroup.com.\nYou will get an automated reply containing a link: click the link and an Omnifocus item will be created. \n\nA: Users of the Omni-provided Sync Service may like the \"Mail Drop\" function it offers — rather than the closed loop of sending an email, getting one back and then having to round trip by clicking a link, your email is sent directly into your OmniFocus and picked up when you next sync.\nmore info on Mail Drop\n\nA: The best way to send stuff to omni-focus on iOS is to simply click on the share extension. That works in most twitter clients and RSS readers. There is also excellent integration with some apps like the Unread RSS reader, so that you can send things directly to omni-focus. Most apps have the share extension button, so it will be your best bet.\n", "Q: Using timed access control in airport express Have read Using timed access control in airport extreme base station but the fix described has not worked.\nClicking \"+\" reverts the times back to the default \"09:00  to  17:00\"?\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: You have to press Enter after changing the time fields (so the cursors jumps to the next one).

It doesn't really support full screen windows or Mission Control.\nOne workaround would be to disable Lion's full screen in MacVim's preferences and assign it to for example the second space in the Dock. Then ⌃2 would usually select the space it's on.\nA similar question at Super User: https://superuser.com/questions/423240/shortcut-to-full-screen-app-in-lion\n", "Q: Lion Server with Profile Manager I setup a few profiles in the profile manager and when I remove them from the profile they still seem to be applied on the clients.

In Terminal, how do I go from Macintosh HD to places such as johnsmith that contains Downloads, Desktop etc. In a Finder window, it seems they are independent of each other.\nFrom Macintosh HD, I see Library, Applications etc. but under User I couldn't find johnsmith.\nThe Mac file tree is rather confusing for a Windows user like me who are used to \"My Computer\" then all files are managed by root drives and folders.\nWhat is consider as root on my Mac? Is it Macintosh HD or johnsmith? It is possible to do a partition on Mac like that on Windoes?\n\nA: OS X is Unix-based so there is only one big filesystem visible to the user, even if it is distributed across several partions. This also applies to external drives which are accessible under /Volumes/NAME-OF-DRIVE.\nThe individual user home folders (which contain all the nice stuff like Downloads, Documents etc.) are available in /Users, each user has his/her own directory there with a name matching their short name. Type ls -l /Users in Terminal to see all of them.\nAnd to actually \"go\" there, enter cd ~johnsmith (for user johnsmith) or just cd (for your own home folder), followed by ls -l to see the content.\n\nA: Normally, your user folder is located at /Users/johnsmith/.\nHowever for the case that you are in Recovery Mode, your user folder is located at /Volumes/Mac/Users/johnsmith/. This is because Recovery Mode is like another operation system started from another disk partition, so the disk partition with your main system appears as a mounted volume (like an external hard disk does normally).\n\nA: You can find the location to your home directory by looking in the \"Users & Groups\" System  Preference pane.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open \"System Preferences\" application\n\n*Click \"Users & Groups\"\n\n*Click the padlock to unlock it, if it is not already unlocked. Enter user name and password for an Admin user.\n\n*Right click on the User name you want to find the home directory for, select \"Advanced Options...\"\n\n*Observe the path as noted next to \"Home directory:\"\n\n\n\nNow, once you see where OS X thinks your home folder is located then you can work on un hiding it if it is not showing up where it is suppose to be.\nMake sure its name does not start with \".\", Additionally you can use the SetFile -a v /pathToHome command to make it visible if it appears to be hidden for no apparent reason.\n\nA: To find where it is, open Terminal and type pwd for \"Print Working Directory\". This works because the Terminal opens in your home folder by default.\nYou can move to your home folder in terminal by typing one of cd (defaults to your home folder), cd $HOME (moves to the location in that environment variable), or cd ~ (a shortcut for home), or cd /Users/johnsmith/ (the absolute path).\n\nA: To get path into Terminal without a lot of typing:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a Terminal window.\n\n*In Finder, navigate to the folder (or file) you want, and drag its icon onto Terminal window.\nThe appropriate path string will appear in the terminal window.\n\nA: Your home directory should be /User/$USER\n$USER is a variable so it is not really $USER\nType in the terminal \"echo $USER\" and replace $USER in the first line of my answer with the output, that's your home folder.\n\nA: Very easy solution:\nIn \"Finder\", choose \"Preferences\". Click on the \"Sidebar\" tab, and under the \"Favorites\" column, there should be your user name (usually your name: \"firstlast\"). Check the box.

There are a few Youtube videos that could help, though.\nThe one which felt into the glass of water was, perhaps, the right one? I don't know why, or if it is just mine (and my mother's, actually) but it seems that the left one sounds a lot lower than the right one. \nIt seems, too, that Apple is quite nice about replacing the headphones while under warranty.

Any idea how to stop it happening though?\n\nA: I have done two things in this case.\n1) Connect a hard drive to change the destination - even if I don't connect that drive often, the local drive check seems faster than a network check. You can then re-establish the network backups to no ill effect when you return home. Having many Time Machine destinations is nice to have a second copy and works well for me.\n2) Log into your Time Capsule and sign in again to MobileMe / iCloud and then delete that \"find my mac\" functionality. This seems to lessen the Time Machine \"seeing\" the remote drive but has an obvious downside of not being able to re-connect as well to your \"home\" AirPort / Time Capsule while on the road.\nFor advanced debugging, you could also run tm_diagnose and pore over the logs collected to see if any error conditions are present in the extremely undocumented and verbose logs that the diagnostic command collects. I would caution people without a UNIX or software background that \"errors\" in system logs are often not errors in the sense that something is broken - but more for the people who write and maintain the code to remember to clean some thing up or a minor \"assumption\" was not proven out in practice. There can be lots of false positives when looking at unix logs, but also a lot of learning how things work under the hood.\n\nA: If you're away for an extended period of time, you could just turn off Time Machine until you get home.\n", "Q: Which font is used when I export formulas from Grapher?

It still seems to charge the computer. Is there any risk to my physical safety from continuing to use it?\n\nA: Frayed jacketing represents a potential fire hazard if the wires themselves become exposed and overheat, short, and/or arc. Provided only the jacketing is frayed, you could use electrical tape to provide protection to the internal wires or you could add a sleeve or heat shrink tubing.\nA safe answer is to order a replacement from Apple in order to protect yourself, your device, and your property.\n\nA: The same voltages that you find on those wires will also be present on the contacts of the magsafe connector itself. Since these are accessible to a finger, you can be pretty sure that there are no harmful voltages there. I think the biggest potential danger is if the wires short out and enough heat is generated to start a fire. Even that possibility sounds rather far fetched to me, but I won't totally rule it out. The power adapter ought to contain circuitry to protect against that, however.\n(I don't usually add disclaimers to my scribblings on the net, but one seems in order here: I am not an expert, just a moderately competent amateur in the field of electronics.)\n", "Q: Failed to launch iTerm2 \nPossible Duplicate:\niTerm2 terminals close immediately with “argpath=login error=No such file or directory” \n\niTerm2 is immediately closed after launch with the error:\n\"argpath=login error=No such file or directory\"\n\nIf I switch from login to command (with bash -l) I'm getting the following error: \n\"argpath=bash error=No such file or directory\"\n\nI'm running OSX Lion.\nHow this can be fixed?\n\nA: Looks like there is some problem with reading whatever iTerm2 reads as a login shell.  Try changing the preference in 'Profiles/General' to a specific command (i.e. /bin/bash) and see if that works.\nAdditionally, does Apple's terminal work?  could you do something like\necho $SHELL\nbash\n\nand see if bash actually exists on your machine?  Bash is quite unfussed on what login items you have, so make sure you have a minimal .bash_profile and .bashrc in your $HOME\nGive it a try and let's see if we get enough info to help you.\n", "Q: Executables in /bin and /usr/bin are not found in path Somehow I can’t execute files in /bin or /usr/bin without providing the full path. \nThis isn’t happening when running from Terminal, but, for example, iTerm can’t run bash (only /bin/bash), OnyX can't run sw_vers.\n.profile: export PATH=/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin:$PATH \n.profile: export PATH=$PATH \n.bash_history: export PATH=\"$PATH:\"'/Users/gilstrauss/Applications/CrossOver.app/Contents/SharedSuppor‌​t/CrossOver/bin' \n.bash_history: export PATH=/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:$PATH \n.bash_history: export PATH=${PATH}:/bin \n.bash_profile: export PATH=/bin:$PATH \n.bashrc: export PATH=${PATH}:/bin:/usr/bin\n\n\nA: Terminal.app correctly starting the shell does’t mean much: it runs /usr/bin/login (with the full path) by default, which invokes your default shell (again: defined with a full path) as an interactive login shell (which  will in turn read both .profile and .bashrc and leave you with a working $PATH). Your problem is non-interactive shells, which do neither, do not get any $PATH settings. That seems to point to OS X’ default path settings having somehow been clobbered. \nTo check this, run cat /etc/paths. The output should (at the very least) be\n/usr/bin\n/bin\n/usr/sbin\n/sbin\n\n(these are the defaults on a pristine OS X install). If the first two are missing, you have your cause – and an easy solution: \nmv /etc/paths /etc/paths.old # if you want to keep the current contents\ndef_paths=(/usr/bin /bin /usr/sbin /sbin)\nfor p in ${def_paths[@]}; do echo $p >> /etc/paths; done\ncat /etc/paths.old >> /etc/paths # append previous contents\n\nNote that as /etc/paths is owned by root, you will have to sudo su for this to work.\n\nA: Not sure how it happened but your PATH went haywire, luckily it's an easy fix. Run the following in Terminal (or iTerm) to fix the issue:\necho \"export PATH=$PATH:/bin:/usr/bin\" >> ~/.bashrc\nsource ~/.bashrc\n\nThis will add /bin and /usr/bin to the end of your PATH for this and all future terminal sessions. \n\nA: In OS X it's launchd that sets the initial path for everything, not your terminal files.\nNow, on an unrelated note, I just found out that in OS X \nps -E \n\nwill show the environment that the process has been given. I'm sure everybody knew this except for me,but I'm very excited! Why?\nBecause now I can provide a partial answer.\nps -EA\n\nWill show you the environment that every process started whether said process has a controlling terminal or not. You should see \n/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin\n\nWhich is what you should also get when you type in\n/bin/launchctl getenv PATH\n\nsince launchd sets the path. It is here where your problem lies, I feel, not in your dotfiles. You might find reading the manpage for environ(7) as well as path_helper(8) useful. When the system is working properly, every app you run should have the same environment given it by launchd. The fact that Onyx is malfunctioning means that it's not shell issue, but rather a system one. \nIt's very important launchctl/launchd is setting the path correctly.\n\nA: do you have a .bash_profile?  in mine\n$ cat bash_profile \n\nsource ~/.bashrc\nexport PATH=$PATH:/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin\n\n$ echo $PATH\n/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11/bin:/usr/local/git/bin:/usr/local/julia:/usr/local/MacGPG2/bin:/usr/texbin:/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin\n\n(for macports to the path). It stands to reason that you could just have in .bash_profile the line\nexport PATH=$PATH:/bin:/usr/bin\nAnd see how it goes. My guess is that you must have done something very serious to your machine, so do make a backup of your files, and test for software and also hardware soundness.\n", "Q: ls output does not have color while SSHing to another machine with iTerm2, but does with Terminal Just as the title says, when I ssh to my work Fedora server with iTerm2 I don't get color ls output. When I ssh to the same server with OS X's default Terminal app, ls color output works just fine. \nEDIT: All other ls output is colorized properly. Both iTerm2 and Terminal display ls locally as colored, and Terminal works properly when SSH'd over to the work machine.\nThe only time I'm not getting colorized ls output is when I use iTerm2 to SSH to my work machine. Terminal produces colorized ls output when SSH'd to my work machine and so does PuTTY on Windows. \nWhen SSH'd into my work machine from iTerm2 'ls -G' also makes no difference. Still no coloration on ls output.\nAlso, when SSH'd to my work machine from iTerm2, the only thing I'm not seeing color on is the output of ls. My prompt is colorized, vim works with color, and if I echo $TERM I see xterm-256color. \nAny ideas?\n\nA: ls output with colors (ls -G) is not the default option. Run the following command in your terminal to enable ls colors by default:\necho \"alias ls='ls -G'\" >> ~/.bashrc\nsource ~/.bashrc\n\nThis and all future terminal sessions will now display colors correctly.\n\nIf you're still not seeing colors on your remote (or local) session follow these steps:\nIn iTerm verify that you're sending a terminal type that supports colors. Open the preferences window -> Profiles -> Default -> Terminal. I'd recommend putting xterm-256color as the Terminal Type.\n\nWhile connected to the remote machine, run ls -G and open the iTerm preferences again: preferences window -> profiles -> Default -> Colors. Adjust the ANSI Colors, and turn the minimum contrast down until the colors in the terminal window start to show color.\n\nIf the remote system supports ls --color=always, remove any existing aliases in ~/.profile or ~/.bashrc and update as follows:\necho \"alias ls='ls --color=always'\" >> ~/.bashrc\n\n\nA: I had the same problem. I found that the color theme I used in iTerm (solarized) redefined the colors ls used on the ssh host making them impossible to tell apart.\nYou can try the following to check whether it's not the case for you:\nLS_COLORS=\"di=07;31\" ls    # this will list directories as black on red \n\nIf this does show colors, you might need to redefine colors on the linux machine. The following command defines (some) ls colors to be similar to the OS-X defaults:\nLS_COLORS=\"di=00;34:ln=00;35:so=00;32:pi=01;33:ex=00;31:bd=00;34\" ls\n\nTo edit the colors on linux, see the dircolors man page. You can also read the following on how to set colors from .bashrc:\nhttps://github.com/seebi/dircolors-solarized#installation\n", "Q: FileVault (CoreStorage) + Linux partition Quick question here. I'm not really familiar with the requirements of CoreStorage so I'd like to confirm with you guys before I start working.\nI'm currently running OSX Lion on my MacBook Air, with the SSD encrypted with FileVault. I'd like to partition 10GB in order to install Linux (Ubuntu) on it. \nHowever, due to the nature of FileVault (CoreStorage), I cannot touch the partitions without removing encryption. \nIf I decrypt/remove FileVault, partition with Disk Utility, and encrypt/reapply FileVault on my Lion partition, will there be problems/will this work?\n\nA: I would take a look at this StackExchange thread and the linked articles contained: Is File Vault 2 whole disk encryption or whole partition encryption?\nAssuming what you are aiming for is an encrypted Lion partition and an unencrypted Linux partition, the decrypt, partition, encrypt process described will accomplish what you are looking for.\nAs always, back up first.\n", "Q: Dedicate 1 ethernet port on Mac Pro to internal backup volume? Is this possible? I'm using a Mac Pro as a home (Lion) server, connected via ethernet to a gigabit switch. One internal drive is reserved for network backups from local users via Time Machine. All running Lion. Can I use the 2nd (currently redundant) ethernet port exclusively for backups to the internal drive, and so save the other port for other network traffic / file serving? \n\nA: Sure, assign a static IP to the 2nd port, create a DNS record pointing to that IP, then configure the remote Macs to use the DNS name.\n", "Q: How can I replace Finder with Path Finder in OS X Lion? I downloaded Path Finder and like it a lot, but Finder still takes over some functionality that I'd prefer Path Finder to do. For instance, if I open a folder on my desktop it opens in Finder, and when I mount disk images, they open in Finder. Is there a way (short of going in low-level and replacing Finder stuff with Path Finder stuff, which I don't really want to do) to make Path Finder do everything that Finder does by default?\n\nA: According to the Path Finder Support Forums, it is not possible to completely replace Finder with Path Finder. For more information see \"Can I replace OS X's Finder with Path Finder?\"\n\nA: These days (2016) Path Finder is much better integrated already from the start. \nOften not having Finder running is a good prerequisite for having Path Finder take its place, but this is not always necessary. You can make Finder quit when Path Finder starts in the preferences (See the Finder tab) and you can quit Finder from there as well.\nQuit Finder\nA convenient way to quit Finder is also adding a quit command to its Archive menu by typing this into Terminal defaults write com.apple.Finder QuitMenuItem 1, then press return.\nThe following two techniques should make Path Finder take the view calls from third party applications, but \"Show in Finder\" when selected from the Dock will probably not work.\nSetup Path Finder to intercept Finder calls\n\n\n*\n\n*Control-Click (Right-Click) on Path Finder and select \"Show Package Contents.\" Go inside the sub-folder \"Contents\"\n\n*Double click on the document named \"PkgInfo\" and replace the \"APPLPFdR\" with \"FNDRMACS\"\n\n*Save and close the document.\n\n*Log out and in again\n\n\n\nMake Path Finder default file viewer\n\n\n*\n\n*Go into terminal and type defaults write -g NSFileViewer -string com.cocoatech.PathFinder and press return.

This results in losing any unsaved work and very slow resume times. How can I prevent this?\nThis problem only appeared during the past few months after I upgraded to Lion. I am now running Lion (10.7.3)\nIn the past (Snow Leopard), after the battery ran low/out, the computer would keep track of the state of all open applications and the computer was plugged in and resumed (power key). No data was lost and I was able to get right back to work.\nBut now, when the battery runs out, most/all of the previously running programs relaunch from scratch. For browsers (Chrome/Firefox) this means bringing up an error page and asking if I'd like to restore the session. Microsoft Office products splash screens re-appear and I am prompted to recover files from backups. Terminal starts a new session with old results greyed out. LyX attempts to load backup files. MATLAB splash screen re-appears and I lose all unsaved data. Etc.\nVisually the resume process is also different: Rather than showing a greyed out version of the desktop as I left it with a progress bar, I now get a generic login screen with the grey tweed background. However, it does not behave as though I had manually forced a power off since a) rEFIt doesn't prompt for Mac vs Windows and b) All applications that were previously running start again, rather than only the default login set.\nAdditional information:\n\n\n*\n\n*pmset -g custom shows that all power modes are using the default hibernatemode 3 where the system state is both written to disk and kept in memory as long as the battery power allows.\n\n*Battery is in the \"Replace Soon condition\"\n\n*Harddisk is fairly full 27/285GB free\n\n*4GB of RAM\n\n\nMy best guess is that my battery runs out before OS X has a chance to finish saving the full memory image to disk. I often run lots of memory intensive programs and use all of the system memory (4GB) plus ~8GB of swap. How can I tell if this is the problem? And if it is, what can I change so that OS X has enough time to save a full memory image before the battery runs out?\nAny thoughts on how to enable a robust sleep when the battery runs out?\n\nA: As you noted from the system profiler, your battery is close to getting ready to fail. \n\nBattery is in the \"Replace Soon condition\"\n\nYour best guess is accurate in that the \"battery runs out before OS X has a chance to finish saving the full memory image to disk\" This memory image is used to enable Safe Sleep. Without it, applications start from scratch.\nA thing to try before replacing the battery is to attempt to calibrate the battery. \nCalibrating MacBook Battery\n\nPowerBook G4 (15-inch Double-Layer SD), MacBook (all models), and MacBook Pro (all models) \nThe battery calibration for the PowerBook G4 (15-inch Double-Layer SD) and any model of MacBook or MacBook Pro has been updated because of a new battery released with this computer. With these computers, follow these steps to calibrate your battery:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Plug in the power adapter and fully charge your PowerBook's battery until the light ring or LED on the power adapter plug changes to green and the onscreen meter in the menu bar indicates that the battery is fully charged.\n  \n*Allow the battery to rest in the fully charged state for at least two hours. You may use your computer during this time as long as the adapter is plugged in.\n  \n*Disconnect the power adapter while the computer still on and start running the computer off battery power. You may use your computer during this time. When your battery gets low, the low battery warning dialog appears on the screen.\n  \n*At this point, save your work.  Continue to use your computer; when the battery gets very low, the computer will automatically go to sleep.\n  \n*Turn off the computer or allow it to sleep for five hours or more.\n  Connect the power adapter and leave it connected until the battery is fully charged again.\nTip: When the battery reaches \"empty\", the computer is forced into sleep mode. The battery actually keeps back a reserve beyond \"empty\", to maintain the computer in sleep for a period of time. Once the battery is truly exhausted, the computer is forced to shut down. At this point, with the safe sleep function introduced in the PowerBook G4 (15-inch Double-Layer SD) computers, the computer's memory contents have been saved to the hard drive. When power is restored, the computer returns itself to its pre-sleep state using the safe sleep image on the hard drive.\n\nIf your computer continues powering off completely in-between steps 4 and 5 after a couple of trys, replacing your battery may be the only way to reliably get the safe sleep functionality back, other wise you may need to manually configure your MacBook to go into Safe Sleep when you put it to sleep manually well before the hard power-off occurs. A Utility such as SmartSleep might help greatly. \n", "Q: Options for repairing iPod Touch with broken glass I've got an 4th-gen iPod Touch with thoroughly smashed glass. What are my options for repair? It sounds like\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple charges about $200 \n\n*There are third-party repair-by-mail services that charge around $100, and\n\n*You can buy parts and do it yourself.\n\n\nThe first options seems a bit pricey for a $300 unit, and the third sounds too risky. That leaves the second option. I'm wondering if there is a reliable third-party service I can use, or if there are other options I've not considered?\n\nA: There's also the option of taking it to a local unofficial smartphone repair shop, which has the advantage of nobody having to pay for shipping. This is also risky though, since they might use low-quality parts and/or have poorly-trained staff, so it's probably only a decent option if you can find a convenient one with a good reputation.\n", "Q: Generating a monochrome PDF file from a color PDF file How can I generate a monochrome pdf file from a color pdf file?\nI have tried ImageMagick's convert, but with bad results.\nA direct conversion\n\nconvert -monochrome file.pdf file-bw.pdf\n\nproduces dithered images.\nGoing through png\n\nconvert -monochrome -background white -geometry 2048 file.pdf file-bw.png\n\nstubbornly keeps the background to some shade of gray.\n\nA: You can do this easily in Preview:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the PDF in Preview.\n\n*Go to File > Export...\n\n*From the Quartz Filter drop-down box, select Black & White.\n\n*Save and you're done.\n\n\nA: You can also use Ghostscript to transform color into grayscale PDFs.

I'm staying at a hotel and want to use my Apple TV. My problem is that because there's no browser on the Apple TV I can't get to the proxy web page where I can accept the terms of service. \nI found a link explaining a work-around using a Mac as an ad hoc airport, but I don't have a Mac or other wireless router with me, just an iPhone and iPad. \nI also found some advice about spoofing MAC addresses, but the instructions involved a lot of command line jujitsu that I don't know how to do on iOS. \n\nA: Use a computer to imitate or “spoof the MAC address” and register the AppleTV hardware address and agree to the terms is the pragmatic manner to join. \nUnlike the post you found, however, it can be done much more easily with a MacBook and without much jujitsu.\n\n\n*\n\n*First get the MAC address of the Apple TV (available in Settings) and shut it down.\n\n*Then run the following in Mac's terminal app, replacing the MAC address shown with that of your Apple TV: sudo ifconfig en0 ether 98:01:a7:a1:f6:77.\n\n*Next confirm the change by running ifconfig en0 | grep ether.\n\n*Finally use your Mac's browser to sign-in and bypass the captive portal.\n\n\nOnce that's done disconnect or power off your Mac, plug your Apple TV back in and connect to the network as usual. Instructions here summarized from Spoofing IoT Device MAC Addresses.\n\nA: My easiest solution is to get an Airport Express (that is preconfigured with wireless settings and then hooking that up to the Apple TV) and then access the hotel's terms and conditions using your smart phone.\n\nA: I just ran into the same problem.  There's no browser on Apple TV so you can't pass through the authentication page from the hotel.  I found a solution.\nI connected my MacBook Pro to the hotel network via ethernet, and used \"internet sharing\" to share my connection via wifi.  Once connected to Apple TV, I was able to mirror, and use the computer's internet connection to use Apple TV Services.\n\nA: Recommended Approach: Add via IT Support\nYou don't need to setup your own router, you just need to contact the network's tech support and have them manually add your device via MAC address.\nLarge chain hotels use companies like Innflux to deliver HSIA and manage their networks. Typically, these companies will allow you to connect your device to their network, but you must go through them directly. You simply need to contact their customer service number, and give them the hexadecimal MAC address for the piece of hardware you're trying to connect. \nThe MAC address is a unique, factory-set identifier and it's usually printed on the bottom of the hardware or on the box it came in. It looks something like AC:3A:6B:BE:B7:C1. If the device has a user interface, you can often get it from a network settings area. \nThe network technical support phone number is often printed on a card explaining internet access around a guest room's desk. Otherwise, ask a staff member at the front desk for it.\nIf your device connects to their WiFi network, but doesn't have internet access, you can also copy down the assigned IP address to give to them if you don't know the MAC address. \nThese companies setup network architecture and use techniques like port isolation to increase wireless network security for their clients. Port isolation prevents connected devices from communicating with each other directly.\nAlternative Approach: MAC Spoofing\nIn theory, you should be able to connect your Apple TV to the network by spoofing its MAC address on your laptop, and connecting that device to the network before swapping it out with the Apple TV. This alternative approach may be against your particular service provider's policy and is likely frowned upon. I recommend using the aforementioned first approach, but if you're curious, I created a walkthrough for those willing to try this. Spoofing the MAC on my laptop and connecting that way has worked for me multiple times. \n\nA: Went on vacation to Phuket Thailand before I went to the hotel  they had mentioned that Wi-Fi service was being offered at this hotel.\nI forgot to check to see if they had an ethernet LAN cable connection, So when I arrived at the hotel I realized that they didn't have this connection  I had taken my airport express to set up a hotspot along with my AppleTV Second Gen to the hotel for watching movies.\nAs people mentioned above when connecting through settings to the Wi-Fi. It doesn't give you an option to type in a password because everything is done  via the browser.\nWell luckily for me I had a jailbroken AppleTV second-generation so I logged into the browser,which is really Couch Surfer Pro went to google.com then hit submit entered  the information my room number and of course password saved it connected to the Internet .\nThen hit menu on the remote clicked on Main Menu and Viola you're  connected. But keep in mind the Wi-Fi tends to be slow in the hotel room depending upon your connection speed there hope this helped. \n\nA: Calling the front desk, hotel customer service or isp and having them add your MAC address is the only way to do it without using another device, or a jailbroken apple tv.\n\nA: First check if there is a hard wired Ethernet;  use that if it's possible.\nOtherwise use a laptop to spoof the MAC address of the Apple TV.  Do the sign on in the browser; then shut it down and fire up the Apple TV.\n\nA: You can side-load a web browser on to AppleTV 4 or AppleTV 4K. \nKey steps are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get the source code\n\n*Compile the code in to a binary (via Xcode)\n\n*Side-load the binary on to your AppleTV (via Xcode)\n\n\nmacOS, iOS, tvOS developers should find it extremely simple and easy to do. However, non developers will need help or won't be able to use this approach.\nHere's the tvOS Browser that I'm using:\nhttps://github.com/jvanakker/tvOSBrowser\nI quickly built and loaded it and it works surprisingly well. Granted, I don't use it for anything apart from trying to get through wifi login portals. I actually modified a line so it opens a http:// website by default, which helps too.\nHere's a fairly relevant link to a discussion on side-loading apps on AppleTV:\nhttps://initialcharge.net/2017/01/provenance-install-tvos/\n\nA: Call the hotel's customer service and have them add the MAC address. Done. Or jailbreak it and add a browser. \n\nA: None of you are realizing that all you have to do is call the ISP (internet service provider) for the hotel and ask them to put your mac ID for the apple TV into their system for the duration of your stay. The front desk person and sometimes even the manager are not going to even know what you're talking about.  But the ISP has a whole system in place for this.\n", "Q: How can I play music from my iPod touch to my computer without using iTunes? And also, how can I use the Apple Remote app? It's crashing and won't connect to iTunes.\n\nA: You can download Sharepod to do this.\nAfter downloading, make sure your iPod is plugged in and iTunes is not open. If the application does not recognize your iPod, it will give you a link to a page that should have a solution (though you probably won't have this problem).\nYou can select a folder to put your iPod music in or create a new one. If you would like to put all your music into the folder use control+A to select all the songs in the list.

In my git (Xcode) project, I committed a filename with improper case.  Now I went to try to rename it, but when I commit, I get:\n\nfatal: Will not add file alias 'MyProject/MyFile.h' ('MyProject/MyFilE.h' already exists in index)\n\nI'm sure this is because git isn't used to be running on a case-preserving, case-insensitive filesystem like HFS+.  But how do I get around it?\nI tried renaming both files to something else, and committed that, and then renaming them back to what I want, but it still fails (with the same error message).\n\nA: Step 1: Just rename the file with a name that is more different (than only the case of letters.) \nJust pick a random name different from the current name and from the name you want to give it.\nStep 2: commit this file by GUI (Xcode) or by CLI (Terminal)\nStep 3: rename the file as you wanted to rename it in the first place. So now, there will also be more difference than just the case with the previous name.\nStep 4: commit the renamed file again. \nNo magic tricks needed. And you can choose to commit by GUI or CLI.\n\nA: As asked and answered on stackoverflow, there's an easier way to do this that doesn't involve making a new file system in a disk image file:\nMove your existing file aside, commit that move, then move it back using the case you'd like it to maintain and commit. Done.\nExample:\nmv foo foo2\ngit add -A\ngit commit -m \"renaming\"\nmv foo2 FOO\ngit add -A\ngit commit --amend -m \"renamed foo to FOO\"\n\n\nA: I have not yet found a way to fix this directly on a case insensitive file system, you need a case sensitive filesystem.\nLuckily Mac OS X has good virtual disk mounting support, so you can quickly & easily get (make) a (temporary) case sensitive filesystem on your computer.\nOpen up Disk Utility, make a New Image and set the \"Format\" field to one of the case-sensitive versions of \"Mac OS Extended\". Also make sure you make it big enough for your repository.\nMount your new disk, check out the git repository onto it, make sure the correctly named file has the correct contents, and delete the other one. Commit and push your changes, and then you can unmount the disk image and delete it.\nIf you don't have a remote server to clone from (i.e. you're just running a git repo locally on your hard drive), remember you can clone directly from the other git repository on your hard drive.\n\nA: I use sourcetree.

The solution he suggested is to uninstall Messages Beta on your Mac.\n", "Q: SSH, passphrases, keychains, Could not open a connection to your authentication agent I will be very surprised if anyone has the answer to this. I have googled for a long time but no luck.\nAs an iOS developer who will shortly be welcoming a new team member I want to set up a continuous integration server so that anyone who checks in code will kick off a build, which will in turn set the status of a build light providing a visual indication of code status. If the build breaks it won't stay that way for long because we'll see a big red light.\nThe ingredients I picked to make this work are Jenkins, Git and a Mac mini. Day to day I won't have physical access to the mini but the build light is controlled by ethernet - no problem.\nThe first step in getting Jenkins to manage a build is to clone the git repository. For obvious reasons it discards any old code and grabs a copy of the entire repository. I'm using a git \"Repository URL\" of gitfella@boardroom.local:repo/ProjectName.git. Naturally I did 'su - jenkins' and become user jenkins, then going through the process of scp id_rsa.pub gitfella@boardroom.local. As gitfella I appended that public key to authorized_hosts.\nThe surprise came when I went back to being user jenkins and tried ssh gitfella@boardroom.local - I was asked for the passphrase for jenkins. At this stage I realised the repository clone was failing because the passphrase could not be entered while Jenkins was running without an interactive shell.\nThe way to get the passphrase into the keychain is ssh-add -K (and prior to Lion I don't remember having to do this ever) but this does not work in a ssh shell, it fails with the message Could not open a connection to your authentication agent. Executing ssh-agent shows the environment variables that need to be set to allow this to happen, and once that's done ssh-add -K works. Then the git clone is OK. Then I thought the problem was solved but next ssh login I'm asked for the passphrase again.\nI now have the git clone phase of the build working but I would rather not have to remove the passphrase for Jenkins entirely...\nHow can ssh-agent values be set on every invocations of this Jenkins build process? Jenkins is started by executing launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.jenkins-ci.plist - would it be possible to set the ssh-agent environment in here somehow? Would these settings persist as long as Jenkins does (per boot)?  I'm reluctant to mess with this now I have this little problem mostly sorted, but maybe some expert knows the right fix.\n\nA: The ssh-add -K  command add the key to the Apple's Keychain, but there is a SSH specific keychain, unrelated do the Apple's one.\nIt runs as a deamon and interacts only with SSH.\nI don't know if this will help you, but I have strong feeling that it will.\nKeychain is available as a homebrew package so if you get nomebrew available at your system to install it just type brew install keychan.

They look the same, are they the same internally? I can't even find the i300's on Sennheiser's site!\nHere's some links:\ni300 on Apple.com: http://store.apple.com/uk/product/H3559ZM/A\nMM70i on Sennheiser.com: http://www.sennheiser.com/sennheiser/...\nThanks for any info on the differences!\n\nA: Huh! So I asked an Apple representative, but they didn't know. I also asked Sennheiser and they finally got back to me. Apparently the i300 are exclusive to Apple (as I suspected), and although they look very similar to the MM70i, they're apparently closer in sound performance to the cheaper MM30i.\nSo basically, the Apple exclusive Sennheiser i300 are equivalent to the Sennheiser MM30i.\nYou can see the MM30i here:\nhttp://www.sennheiser.co.uk/uk/home_en.nsf/root/private_headsets_mobile_music_504739 \nAccording to the Sennheiser representative, the MM70i has a better bass response and more accessories than either the MM30i or the i300.\nSo, from what I can gather, it seems buying the cheaper MM30i, or the more expensive MM70i, is a better option than the Apple exclusive i300. \nUpdate: Since I wrote this question, it appears that Apple have reduced the RRP of their i300 to match that of the MM30i. However, as Amazon seems to consistently offer a 30% discount on the MM30i's, the Apple exclusive headphones are still more expensive in a practical sense.\n\nA: I own the i300's from Apple store, and also bought the mm30i's to try as I don't like the asymmetric cable on the i300's. I returned the mm30i's (saying they were faulty) because the sound was THAT bad. No comparison, the i300's far outshine the mm30i's. Fuller sound, better better. Everything is better EXCEPT the annoying asymmetric cable. Might be worth also trying the CX400's I'm told they are similar.\n", "Q: Recommendations for headset (+ mic ) for macbook in 2012 I'm looking for a stereo headset and not simply in-ear headphones for Skype at affordable prices.\nFrom past experience, I own a dual-jack headset Logitech from my PC. Sound came out but the mic never worked on my Mac mini. A HP XA490AA headphone worked great on PC but was never recognized on OS X.\nI'm thinking about a headset directly compatible with Mac OS X. I prefer a single-jack input over USB since it doesn't use a USB port, but USB is fine. What options exist and what standards will allow me to know a single-jack mic/headphone combination that will work with a Mac?\nEDIT: I know iPhone/iPod/iPad headphones are compatible with MacBooks. But these are headphones. \nWhat I read today and for sharing\n\nThe difference between USB and jack: USB uses the motherboard card. Jack uses the sound card. Usually laptops have crap sound cards. So go for USB.\n\nEDIT May 31 2012: I finally bought a Logitech USB Headset H530 . Satisfied with skype clear voice. For most USB headphone, do not forget to turn on System Preferences > Sound > select the device in input and ouput tabs.\n\nA: I've got the in-ear headset buds from Apple; they have a single jack and they're excellent. Purchased retail in Austria for around €70.\n\nA: The problem that you may have had with the headset mic not working on your Mac is that the Mac is expecting Line Level input and the mic isn't supplying this.\nIf you have a headset you're comfortable with (Logitech in your original question) search various sites where you can get hardware and buy a cheap (and we're talking cheap) USB sound card which works on a Mac. I bought one in the UK from a proper retailer for about £4 (around $7) and it works fine with no need for drivers to be installed.\nI leave the headset plugged into it so I plug it straight into the keyboard and be up and working in very little time\n\nA: My experience is your best value is a USB based headset with over the ear cans and a plastic boom mic to get it near your mouth.\n\n\n*\n\n*Plantronics makes many\n\n*Logitech does as well\nFor a price premium, you can get headsets that use the 1/8 inch headphone jack, but these overwhelmingly have microphones in the cord which makes for a noisy conversation in my experience. Again, the Apple touch interface for the microphone where there is a play/pause button as well as volume up/down seems to drive the price of many units higher (in the $80 to $140 range in the US). Your best bet is to look for made for iPhone models since they work best with the Macintosh sound in / headphone out (of course many off-brands work just fine, just be sure you understand the return policy if you can't shop from a store that can speak to your need for it to work with OS X on the Mac hardware.)\n\nA: As stated, newer iPhone/iPod headphones (with inline microphone and controller) work fully with newer Mac hardware (approx 2009 onwards). The newer Macs accept 'four position' 3.5mm jacks (TRRS - Tip, ring, ring, sleeve) - allowing stereo audio, microphone (and control) over one jack.\nTo open up your headset options, you could look at a product that allows you to combine headphone and microphone channels into a single '4 position' 3.5mm TRRS connector; something like this.\n", "Q: Where is my login picture saved?

Okay, so I have a mid-2010 MacBook Pro (unibody design) and I have the typical problem with the keyboard. My shift key function is \"stuck\" so everything WILL COME UP LIKE THIS> (hence the > instead of the period). I booted into a flash drive to update to Lion and the keyboard still typed like the shift key was pressed. Well, we went to Apple to see what they could do. They said that the top case has to be replaced. The problem is, that runs a whopping $250+ and that's out of my budget right now. I have been searching around and haven't seemed to find much of a solution anywhere. I have seen that (at least on here) that the keyboard itself can be replaced without having to replace the entire top case. Nothing has been spilled onto the keyboard and it is not dirty as I have taken a few keys off and checked underneath. So if I replaced the keyboard only, would that fix the problem?

I still have access to the machine: login, password, administrator account.\nIs there something I can do to protect myself against loosing data? Like burning the key-cd in Windows?\n\nA: The only things that can decrypt a FileVault volume are\n\n\n*\n\n*the passwords to your user accounts that you gave access during FileVault setup, and\n\n*the recovery key (24 characters) that you received (and should have written down) during FileVault setup.\n\n\nIf you no longer have the recovery key, and you're concerned about forgetting/losing your account password, you can go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > FileVault and click Enable Users... to allow more user accounts to decrypt the volume.\nAlternatively, if you don't want other accounts to have that ability, you can disable and then re-enable FileVault to get a new recovery key (but that may take a long time).\n", "Q: Every time I connect my iPad, iTunes wants to back it up Every time I connect my iPad, iTunes wants to back it up.

I’m a bit intrigued by the new detailed activity monitors and progress indicators in Windows 8 (copying files, the task monitor, network activity, etc.) It got me thinking: surely there must be some better alternatives to the built-in Activity Monitor.app?\n“Better” as in more detailed and nicer graphs. Specifically, it would be interested and see percentage disk I/O (out of disk capacity), memory usage, and CPU usage in the same nice way as Windows 8 presents it.\nThe Building windows blog has an article detailing the new Task Manager in Windows 8.\nI just think that OS X’s task manager — which I have always found superior — just doesn’t cut it anymore compared to what is coming in Windows 8.\n\nA: Strictly for monitoring RAM use, FreeMemory works well.

I've tried deleting from the web interface, but it only recreates it immediately. I'd love to be able to click the new note icon in the middle of the taskbar but it defaults to this Unfiled Notes section. I'd prefer to be able to choose which notebook it goes into it. Any advice on this workflow?\nAlso, is there a way to create a new notebook in the iOS app or am I relegated t the web app?\n\nA: Yeah I have had the same issue and for the same reason.\nI think the OneNote app is pretty limited in that area and you are dependent on the web interface alot.\nI am not sure if you also use Windows desktop app - but they seem to sync together. \nThere is an app called MobileNoter that also syncs with OneNote, only the PC version though. \nIn Short there are and you will need to think of some work arounds unless you are able to live with the limitations of the app.\nGuess MS really wants you to buy the software on the PC:-)  \n", "Q: Is there a default location for 'linux too applications' I recently moved to OS X from Windows 7. In Windows, pretty much everything gets installed to C:\\Program Files\\[application name] or C:\\[application name]. In OS X /Applications seems to be roughly equivalent to C:\\Program Files for all the consumer apps that I use.\nBut when it comes to a 'linux too' application (e.g. Python, Postgres, Node JS to name just a few) they seem to get installed all over the place. Only after spending a few minutes guessing and using find did I discover that Postgres executables were installed to /Library/PostgreSQL/9.1/bin/, v8 and Node were in /usr/local/bin. Often times these differ to the equivalent paths that I see Linux users refer to.\nIs there a better way to discover where my apps are being installed than by having to use find each time? Shouldn't I be able to predict it with rules of thumb something like 'all database apps should go in /Library' so that's where I know to look for postgres, and 'all compilers and languages go in /usr/local/bin' so that's where I know to look for v8 after it's installed?\n\nA: The short answer is, unfortunately, no there isn't a default location.\nBut it's not complete chaos.\nFor command line tools that ship with the OS or get brought in by Apple-supplied applications like Xcode, you'll find it all in /usr/bin. That includes things like the OS X default Python and Perl as well as the Xcode-supplied gcc, clang, make and the other command line developer tools Xcode installs.\nFor non-Apple command line tools, if the application is well-behaved, it should put them in /usr/local/bin.\nSome .app packaged applications that install under /Applications offer command line tools (for example subl offered by Sublime Text 2). If I want to use these from the command line I'll generally make a symlink from /usr/local/bin to the tool under the .app file for the application rather than put the application-specific path on my PATH environment variable.\nIf you use a package manager like Homebrew to install and manage your command line tools then it's not too much of a hardship to make /usr/local/bin the place for everything you use. Homebrew does a very nice job of keeping it neat and clean and all in one place for you. I can't speak to how well MacPorts or Fink keep things contained under one sub-tree like this.\nThe exception to the rules are OS X-default daemons like Postgres and such. Those can get scattered and there really isn't a very good way to track them down aside from find and maybe mdfind from the command line.\n", "Q: Dual boot versus VM storage use? Which requires the least total storage to run Windows 7, configuring an MBA for dual-boot with Bootcamp, or using a VM (Parallels, VMWare, VirtualBox)?\nFor the smallest solution, how many free GB would be required for a standard minimal system Windows 7 install?  (such as just for testing web pages on MSIE, and such.)  \nCan a VM boot and run Windows off of a USB connected HD or SSD well enough to be \"usable\"?\n\nA: Using a virtual disk in VMware you can avoid dedicating space to Windows 7 that is just free space, unlike a dual-boot where you'd have to allocate a partition that has all the free space you will ever need.  (Probably true with other VM solutions, but I don't know.)  While a VMware virtual disk does not auto-shrink, it starts out small (on the host disk) and only grows as needed.  So that would be the smallest storage solution.\nI would not expect USB 2.0 to perform well enough to run a Windows VM off of it, but I never tried.  Firewire would be OK.\n", "Q: OS X Lion - Please help me understand Finder \"Find\" I'm a long-time Mac user, but for some reason I can't get my mind around this. Maybe I'm missing something incredibly obvious.\nBaseline: When I choose Finder->File->Find, I get a window titled 'Searching \"MacHD\"' where \"MacHD\" is one of two Search places listed just below, to the right of the text \"Search:\" I see two potential search-places currently defined, \"MacHD\" and \"This Mac\". \"MacHD\" is the default, which generally works for me -- except when I need to restrict the search.\nQ1:  How do I add to the list of potential search-places?  Say, I often want to search ~/Documents/Foo only.  To the right, I see a Save button and a \"-\", but, intuitively, I kind of expect a \"+\" button there.  I assume there's some kind of equivalent, but I can't see it.\nQ2: What are the parameters of this Find? How would I find out? System Preferences -> Spotlight -> Search Results allows me to re-order and eliminate some search results from visibility, and System Preferences -> Spotlight -> Privacy lets me excludes some places from indexing, but how do I know, for example, if a file inside the System folder is or isn't findable?  Yeah, I can do a trial search and find that the file /System/Library/Accessibility/AccessibilityDefinitions.plist is NOT found, so I infer that Spotlight doesn't index the System folder. But is there a more direct way of figuring this out?  Could I add the System Folder to Spotlight's indexing?\nAt the moment, I'm searching for a mislaid image file among tens of thousands I've collected in various places on my HD. My procedure: I set the Finder find to look at \"MacHD\" and tell it to find all image files, change the results window to icon view, use the slider at lower right to make the icons \"large\", grab a cup of coffee, and scroll through all the images. But I'm not confident I'm getting a look at all the images I've placed throughout my HD. Is there a better, more thorough search method? Can I get more control?\nYes I know about the shell (command line) find command.  In one command I can get a list of, say, all *.jpg files on my HDD, but I can't see a convenient way of displaying and scrolling through them that's nearly as good as the Finder provides.\nNo doubt there's a tutorial for using Finder \"Find\" somewhere on the web that will put me right, but I haven't located one. \n\nA: You have a few options since you're on Lion. The Find feature of Finder by default will search whatever folder you're in. The option next to it is called \"This Mac\" which should look through the computer. You can also go to \"All My Files\" in the sidebar and then click on the images section header and that should look for all the image files as well.\n\nA: I always have\nFinder->Preferences->Advanced->When Performing a search:   \nset to \"Search the Current Folder\" but this was not happening.  Causing me lots of frustration. And probably readers of this post much confusion.\nAfter some digging, I discovered my Finder preferences were scrambled, causing the Search window to offer the current window  as an option only intermittently.   Well, anyway, deleting com.apple.finder.plist seems to have cleared this up;  now the current at-front folder is always (so far) offered.\nSo, basically, my original questions were based on faulty operation.  \nThere IS a way to limit the search to a particular folder in a normally-operating 10.7 Finder; just do \nFinder->File->Find\n\nwith the target folder open and at front.\nA somewhat indirect answer to my second question:  to add to the confusion, for reasons I can't fully explain, I have been avoiding entering anything in the top right search specification text box, choosing instead to specify the search with one or more qualifications, e.g. starting by setting  \n\"Name\" \"begins with\" \"foo\".  \nInstead of putting something, however minimal, in that specification text pox, and adding qualifications below.  Which works very well, now that I've tried it. Bottom line: Finder search does work and offers quite a lot of control when used as the designers intended.\n", "Q: Can't format SD Card after OS X Lion update to 10.7.4 Today I tried to format my SD cards with no success. The only thing different that I did was updating to 10.7.4 this weekend. What can I do to re-enable this function?\nThe can't format part means I can't format to any filesystem. It shows \"read only\". The erase format is not enabled.\nAnother user here has confirmed the same problem. The SD cards in question format fine in a camera but I can't write to it when I plug it into MacBook Pro. This started to happen only after update to 10.7.4. The problems seems to stem from (or correlate with) Disk Utility greying out all options apart from 'verify disk'.\nInserting SD card to SD -> USB dongle works just fine, so it's only SD card slot which seems to have assigned 'read only' status.\nIt's weird it started to work fine for a while and again I can't write to or format the SD cards.\nI've formated a SD card with both exFAT and FAT32 and tried to use it on my laptop with Linux and guess what happened? It was read only even in another computer, but I've formated it again using Linux utility and everything is fine.\nBut the SD saga continues on OS X Lion, as well as Mountain Lion and Mavericks.\nIt is annoying buying an Apple product and have this kind of headache, and the worst is that I don't have the possibility of walking in an Apple Store and ask a genius to solve it for me.\n\nA: There are two likely possible causes for this:\n\n\n*\n\n*It's a hardware fault that just showed up, or\n\n*It's a bug in OS X 10.7.4.\n\n\nThe best fix for both of these (currently) is to visit your local Apple Store's Genius Bar. In case 1, they'll fix your SD reader. In case 2, they'll pass the bug in OS X up the food chain so it can get fixed in 10.7.5 (they'll probably try to fix the hardware, too, just in case). \n\nA: I think I may have figured it out. In Disk Utility while the SD card was plugged in I went to ##GB APPLE SD Card Reader Media Tab . The only thing I was allowed to rename was RAID, so I renamed it and literally all the grey-outs went away.\nTry it to see if this helps. But you should try the above Terminal solutions before this...\n\nA: I figured out a hack to fix this.  By default, OS X Mountain Lion mounts the SD card as read only.  You can get Mountain Lion to change the permissions to read-write as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal window.\n\n*Figure out the name of your flash disk, which is probably /Volumes/Untitled\n\n*Run the following command:\nmount > /Volumes/Untitled/fred.txt\n\n\n*This causes the OS to make the SD card read-write.  Now, delete fred.txt\nrm /Volumes/Untitled/fred.txt\n\n\n*Now copy whatever you need to to the card.\nAlso, make sure that the physical write-protect switch on the card is not set to read-only.\n\nA: I have a mid 2009 MBP 15in. 8gB memory.  I experienced the same problem. I tried a couple different SD cards and all I got was read only. I battled this issue for awhile and nobody (Apple or Mac Store) could figure it out. I took my MBP into an Apple store and had them restore back to 10.6.8. I tried another SD card and same thing. Finally, I took the SD card and used my wife's W8 machine. I formatted the SD FAt32. I put it in the MBP and finally I was able to read/write to the card! I'm not savvy enough to understand the why, but it worked. Now I'm anxious to try the PNY 128gB SD card.\n", "Q: Password protecting an Application I read the Question Is there a way to password protect individual apps? - but the answers focused too much on security issues. \nI want to clarify my needs: I use a Software to write my personal diary. I just want to prevent people using my iTunes as a Jukebox and see that interesting icon somewhere and open it. \nI don't want to create a special guest account or something like that, and I don't need a mechanism to prevent people from finding my diary files on the filesystem. \nI just want to enter a password before the app starts. Is there a freeware solution without using terminal for every launch?\n\nA: It's usually left up to the writer of the application to make a password work the best. If you forget to close the app or if you put your mac to sleep, any wrapper you construct will likely not secure the diary. Building the password into the app makes it far superior to a gateway app that asks for the password and then launches another app.\nThat being said, have you investigated these nice journaling software that include the ability to password protect your files?\n\n\n*\n\n*Mac Journal by Mariner Software \n\n*Memories by Coding Robots\n\n*Diary by Michael Gobel\nThere are easily another 10 viable softwares on the App Store alone that serve this exact niche.

It will open up your home directory with Documents or Download folder highlighted.\n\n*Press  CMD +  O to open.\n\n\nOr right click on the folder on dock, select \"Open Documents\" \n\nA: You can do it in a single key command from Finder.\n Cmd ⌘   Opt ⌥   L \nalternatively, it's in the Go menu if you want to keep your hand on mouse/trackpad.\nAnswered here as it's linked as a dupe from How can I open my Downloads folder in one click? which asks for an alternative keyboard shortcut.\n\nA: Right-click or Control+click on the Documents folder in the Finder, and click 'Make Alias'.\nYou probably want to move the alias somewhere else and rename it \"Documents\". Then, drag the Documents alias into the Dock.\nVoíla, a link to the Documents folder instead of a Documents folder stack. \n\nA: A slightly quicker way would be right-click or control-click on the dock icon and select \"Open 'folder name'\".\nI do wish \"Open in Finder\" was at the beginning of the stack/fan for easy access though.\n", "Q: My iPad is connected to my Mac's Wi-Fi, but can't connect to the Internet I have a Mac which is connected to the Internet via Ethernet.

I'm in Spain for a few months and I have an Orange prepaid SIM card, and I'd like to install Orange's \"mi Orange\" app for checking my balance, usage, etc. The app is only available in the Spanish App Store. Can I install it?\n\nA: No, the iTunes account are country bounded. So you can't buy a Spanish app with your US account. \nBut if you'll be in Spain for a few months, I assume you have a Spanish address? So there is no harm in creating a new account for your few months in Spain.\nAll you need is an address or a gift card from Spain.\n", "Q: Purchasing hundreds of consumer App Store apps for employees The question is very simple as the topic suggests. (How) Can a company buy multiple \"licenses\" of publicly available apps on the App Store (for example paid Angry Birds app) and distribute those to its employees? Does the company get .ipa files directly from the developer (Rovio) and distribute them using the company's iOS Enterprise Developer program? I would say no, because Apple would be omitted in the transaction and in that case, what is the way?\nThe distribution would by handled by an application called Afaria (which is a client of Afaria Mobile Device Management solution) via its own App portal (more info in iTunes).\nI've read about the Volume Purchase Program, however this is not a solution, because I'm in Europe.\nIf you need more information, please ask. For now, I can't think of more information I can provide.\n\nA: I suppose I should begin with the caveats that \n\n\n*\n\n*I do not live in Europe so I do not know how things might work there.\n\n*I do not own or manage a business. So also clueless there.\n\n*I have not personally ever bought anything other than free apps from the Apple App Store.\n\n\nSo, what I am saying is that I can not answer your question. But I also suffer from Y-chromosome induced Male Answer Syndrome, so I'll try to answer anyway.\nLet's start with the assumption that Apple wants to sell you these apps. You just have to track down someone to help you either at Apple or at the company which sells this Afaria app you mentioned. \nYou do not mention which country in Europe you are in. But I assume there is an Apple web site either for that country or for your native language. I suggest you go to that web site and search there for information on a volume licensing program.\nFor example, I tried looking at http://www.apple.com/uk/ and searched for volume license. \nThat search turned up this link: http://www.apple.com/uk/mac/volume-licensing/\nNow the page that link took me too appears to apply to volume licensing only for the OS X Lion operating system. Still, the people involved would at least know something about Apple's Volume License process. So, if you were in the UK I would suggest you contact them and start a conversation. \nEven if they can't help you they could still probably point you towards other Apple people who might be able to help you.\nI suggest you try something like that with the Apple web site which targets your region in Europe.\nI realize this would be a tedious and frustrating process. And I hope someone else provides a better answer to your question here. But unless they do, I think your best chance of solving your problem is to start working you way through people at Apple who would want to sell you something help you.\n\nA: The most important thing is to reach out to your Apple sales contact to ask them to walk over the options for you. Each retail store has business staff that is trained to help you explore this sort of options. If you are looking at hundreds of apps then that means hundreds of devices and you surely will get more help than here. Furthermore, the rules for group purchase are different in each country and you can be sure Apple is polling it's business team to see which country has the most demand to grow volume purchase in the future.\nDepending on your needs, you can use a MDM server like the Casper Suite from JAMF to manage things including app deployment, but it's something that most organizations pilot with a few employees and then come up with training so each employee can manage their apps themselves. Unless you have other needs to tightly control things - getting a MDM solution costs more money than most organizations will spend and you can easily have employees self manage this once you learn how deployment works (and doesn't work).\nThe Apple Configurator is worth looking at if you truly have a need to set up each device and work with buying a license for each account and have one Mac set things up for you.\n\nA: A late answer: iTunes Gift Cards. Before we started to use Caspar's JSS and related software to make our catalog of apps available to faculty, we'd give them iTunes Gift Cards to purchase the apps they needed.\n", "Q: Disable screensaver password requirement from command line I am trying to enable and disable the screensaver password requirement from the command line.\ndefaults read com.apple.screensaver\n\nshows a variable askForPassword set to either 0 or 1, depending on whether I configured a password requirement in System Preferences or not.\ndefaults write com.apple.screensaver askForPassword 1\n\nand\ndefaults write com.apple.screensaver askForPassword 0\n\nenable and disable the password setting, or so I thought.\nWhat I find instead is that the commands indeed check and uncheck the checkbox in System Preferences under Security but do not affect the screensaver at all.\nIf I enable the password in System Preferences and then disable it using the second defaults write command, the checkbox in System Preferences is unchecked, but the screensaver will still ask for a password. Only checking and unchecking the checkbox in System Preferences can change this behaviour now.\nAnd if I disable the password in System Preferences and then enable it using the first defaults write command, the checkbox in System Preferences is checked, but the screensave won't ask for a password. Only unchecking and checking the checking the checkbox in System Preferences changes the behaviour afterwards.\nWhat's going on?\nI can imagine that this is a global setting and I should modify /Library/Preferences/com.apple.screensaver instead of the user domain. But in that case, why is there an effect on the System Preferences checkbox?\n\nA: If you are not forced to use defaults write you can use the following command. It interacts with the OS the same as if you were to utilize System Preferences.\nTESTED ON:\n\n\n*\n\n*10.5.x\n\n*10.6.x\n\n*10.7.x\n\n*10.8.x\n\n*10.9.x\n\n\n\nsudo osascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to set require password to wake of security preferences to false'\n\nNOTE: If the command is being run inside of a script that has been given root privileges you would not need the sudo.\nosascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to set require password to wake of security preferences to false'\n\n\nA: I ran into a similar issue, and found a solution from user Guillaume on this forum post. Basically, you need to force the screensaver to reread the password requirement preference, which you can do with a C program:\n#include <CoreFoundation/CoreFoundation.h>\n\nint main(int argc, char ** argv)\n{\n    CFMessagePortRef port = CFMessagePortCreateRemote(NULL, CFSTR(\"com.apple.loginwindow.notify\"));\n    CFMessagePortSendRequest(port, 500, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0);\n    CFRelease(port);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nAnd compile this with:\ncc -o /tmp/anywhereyouwantit/notif notif.c -framework CoreFoundation\n\nThen call this program immediately after your call to defaults write\n", "Q: Time Machine Backups are incredibly slow, not doing what they should I have a Late 2008 MacBook Pro that got a new HDD, top case, and RAM within the last week. The previous HDD failed and was replaced by Apple. Using Carbon Copy Cloner and restoring various directories manually to my home folder from Time Machine, I was easily and quickly able to get the computer back to what I believed was its state at the time just before the HDD failed. Now, however, Time Machine is not working properly at all. The incremental backups, which previously were running at what I would consider excellent speed (most were small, in the KB range) took seconds. Now things are much different.  \nThe backups that have run take an average of about 2.5 hours a piece, and run one followed immediately by another. Each of the last four backups shows roughly the same number of files (255,000 - 277,000) being copied by Time Machine. I assure you I am letting the machine sit and no files are being changed by me. After each backup, Time Machine then goes and either deletes expired files (which so far have been backups just over a month old) or performs post backup thinning. It initially performed consecutive full backups, eating up > 100 GB of my backup, and now is doing smaller ones that take roughly the same amount of time. What's more, after each of the last four backups, I have seen an increase in available space on the backup partition, which is less than 1/2 full. There are actually several other problems, but the details are less important than the big picture, which is that Time Machine is clearly not indexing and backing up properly.  \nPlease see the most recent backupd log below (note that these do not show the increase in space that Time Machine is reporting via System Prefs):  \nMay 16 00:46:32 Howard com.apple.backupd[441]: No pre-backup thinning needed: 107.5 MB requested (including padding), 115.28 GB available\nMay 16 01:11:31 Howard com.apple.backupd[441]: Copied 277591 files (80.0 MB) from volume Metal.\nMay 16 01:20:49 Howard com.apple.backupd[441]: No pre-backup thinning needed: 100.0 MB requested (including padding), 115.11 GB available\nMay 16 01:42:56 Howard com.apple.backupd[441]: Copied 258313 files (502 KB) from volume Metal.\nMay 16 02:10:37 Howard com.apple.backupd[441]: Starting post-backup thinning\nMay 16 02:12:36 Howard com.apple.backupd[441]: Deleted backup /Volumes/C3PO/Backups.backupdb/Howard Buddin/2012-04-02-114830: 115.16 GB now available\nMay 16 02:12:36 Howard com.apple.backupd[441]: Post-back up thinning complete: 1 expired backups removed\nMay 16 02:12:37 Howard com.apple.backupd[441]: Backup completed successfully.\nMay 16 06:00:33 Howard com.apple.backupd[774]: Starting standard backup\nMay 16 06:00:33 Howard com.apple.backupd[774]: Backing up to: /Volumes/C3PO/Backups.backupdb\nMay 16 06:09:53 Howard com.apple.backupd[774]: No pre-backup thinning needed: 100.0 MB requested (including padding), 115.16 GB available\nMay 16 06:32:39 Howard com.apple.backupd[774]: Copied 277591 files (610 KB) from volume Metal.\nMay 16 06:41:51 Howard com.apple.backupd[774]: No pre-backup thinning needed: 100.0 MB requested (including padding), 115.06 GB available\nMay 16 07:04:16 Howard com.apple.backupd[774]: Copied 258312 files (526 KB) from volume Metal.\nMay 16 07:22:43 Howard com.apple.backupd[774]: Backup deletion was canceled by user\nMay 16 07:22:43 Howard com.apple.backupd[774]: Starting post-backup thinning\nMay 16 07:22:44 Howard com.apple.backupd[774]: Backup completed successfully.\nMay 16 12:59:45 Howard com.apple.backupd[296]: Starting standard backup\nMay 16 12:59:46 Howard com.apple.backupd[296]: Backing up to: /Volumes/C3PO/Backups.backupdb\nMay 16 13:02:10 Howard com.apple.backupd[296]: Backup canceled.\n\nI have tried repairing the disk, deleting the com.apple prefs file, and a few other things on Pondini.org to absolutely no avail - the only thing that hasn't worked is deleting the .Spotlight-V100 file, which gives me the message that it is in use and can't be deleted. I have not removed it (yet) with rm -rf /path/ but am tempted to.  \nSo far I have not found a good solution to this problem. Should I just wipe and reformat, losing my backups or does someone have a solution to this??\n\nA: As it turns out, the only solution seemed to be repartitioning the drive and starting from scratch. Time Machine now works as it should. \nUPDATE 1:\nNever mind, this did not work, and I am continuing to have the same problems. The initial backup went perfectly well, but all incremental backups continue to loop twice (one backup, immediately followed by another) and take between 2.5 to 3 hours apiece and copy nearly the same number of files as each preceding backup: about 277,000 for loop one, and about 250,000 for loop two.  \nUPDATE 2:\nThe problem is apparently a 10.6.x (I believe it is only versions .7 and .8) bug that will not be addressed/fixed by Apple. I installed 10.8.2 last week, and backups are once again normal: fast, with no outrageously large numbers of files copied with each backup. I hated ditching 10.6, as it is an exemplar OS, but I couldn't tolerate another day of Time Machine nonsense.\n\nA: Try turning off Spotlight indexing by putting the Time Machine volume into the list of non-indexed folders in System Preferences.\n", "Q: USB pendrive/disk formatting clarification I have three doubts regarding USB pendrive formatting.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there is any simple/quick way to format the USB pendrive from MacBook Pro?\n\n\nNow, I am doing this by Applications/Utilities/Disk Utility -> Selecting the disk -> Tap on \"Erase\" tab -> Tap on \"Erase...\" option.\nI remember, I can do this by right clicking on the Disk's name and by select \"Format\" option in Windows.\nBut, Mac shows the below options when right clicking on the disk in Finder.\n\n\n\n*What is the difference between these two options?\n\n\n\n\n\n*I'm always deleting files in a disk by Right clicking on the file -> Selecting \"Move to Trash\" option.\n\n\nDeleted file get hided from the Finder. But the size of the disk remains same. Is the file really deleted?\n\nA: *\n\n*Not sure of a quicker way than that, my only advice is to not try to find direct correlations between Windows and Mac functions, some stuff is just different, for example the Eject options are similarly more work to find on Windows.\n\n*Erase will remove all files from the target volume, often via the expedient method of just creating new Table of Contents areas whilst technically leaving the old content there, just not addressable without specialist utilities.  Erase Free Space will actually hunt down files which should no longer exist, and rather than just remove the pointers to those file, will actually overwrite them with junk data (all zeroes for example)\n\n*Files in the Trash are often per volume, so delete a file on a USB stick, and it goes in the Trash area on that USB stick.  The file still exists, so the space is still allocated. Empty the trash to free up the space.  This (similar to above) will actually just remove the pointer to the file, unless you choose \"secure erase trash\" which will genuinely remove the file contents also.\n", "Q: Keeping a PDF article's bibliography always visible While reading an article, I like to keep the bibliography pages at the tail of the article visible at the same time as I am going through the pages of the article.\nTwo obvious ways for doing this are\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the pdf article twice, once with Preview and another with Adobe Reader.\n\n*Temporarily make a copy of the article and open both with Preview.\n\n\nAm I omitting something?

In Safari, I use two finger dragging with my trackpad (on a MacBook) to scroll through websites.

It scrolls way too fast (i.e. it's too sensitive).\nMy guess is that it's a problem with the Adobe Reader plugin which doesn't implement scrolling using the same algorithm as Safari's. Is there any way to fix this? What about using a different plugin for PDF documents besides Adobe Reader?\n\nA: Safari can open PDFs using Preview without the need for Adobe Reader to be installed.

What are the options which would be faster than opening Finder and browsing the folder, to open it?\n(I like to keep the desktop completely clean so will avoid Desktop shortcuts if other options are available)\nUsually what happens with me is that there are a few folders (favorites?) which I need to open very frequently like multiple times a day and almost daily (and get landed to some other folder while browsing through Finder).\nCan imagine something like 'pinning' to the Finder icon on the Dock could be of great help, like one can pin favorite folders on the taskbar on Windows.\nWhat do you do to quickly go to your favorite folders?\n\nA: Select the folder you want in the Finder. While it is selected, press Command+T. \nThis will place the selected folder in the sidebar of any Finder window, as well as Open and Save dialog panes. \n\n\n*\n\n*Mac OS X keyboard shortcuts (listed under 'Finder keyboard shortcuts')\n\n\nI should add too that there's a recent folders list available in Finder. With Finder as your current window, click on 'Go' in the menu bar and then 'Recent Folders'. You'll see a list of folders you've been to recently. Selecting one brings the Finder to that folder.\n\nA: The Finder sidebar is designed to let you customize quite a few personal folders for rapid access.\nThis video is great to understand the basics:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mac OS X: Using the sidebar\nThere are many guides on the web, but two support articles can get you started as well:\n\n\n*\n\n*OS X Lion: What is the Sidebar?\n\n*OS X Lion: Organize the sidebar\nSome people also like to use the dock, but folders saved there don't show up in open and save dialogs so you can have your pick of places to keep useful folders at hand based on your needs. One last option is a third party shortcut tool like Alfred, LaunchBar or QuickSilver. They let you use keyboard shortcuts to find files and folders and many more things as well. If you avoid the pointer and like using the keyboard, these three are worth checking out once you've gotten up to speed on the built in solutions.\n\nA: If you want keyboard shortcuts to jump straight to your own folders, but don't want to rely on third-party software, another option is Automator:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Automator and create a new 'Service’.\n\n*Set 'Service receives' to 'no input', and 'in' to\n'Finder.app'.\n\n*In the sidebar, under ‘Library > Files & Folders’, locate ‘Get\nSpecified Finder Items’ and drag it into the workflow area.\n\n*Click ‘Add’ to choose the folder you want a shortcut for.\n\n*In the sidebar locate ‘Open Finder Items’ and drag it into the\nworkflow area.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Save your workflow and give it a logical name like ‘Go to\nMyFolderName folder’.\n\n*Go to ‘System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts’, and click on\n‘Services’ in the sidebar.\n\n*Locate your workflow within ‘General’ and click on it. (If your\nworkflow isn’t there, you may need to restart or log out and back\nin.)\n\n*Click the ‘Add Shortcut’ button and give it a keyboard shortcut that\ndoesn’t conflict with one of Apple's default Finder shortcuts.

For example, for a folder called ‘Projects’, I wanted to\nuse Command-Shift-P, but this conflicts with ‘Show Preview’ (which I\nhardly ever use). So I redefined the ‘Show Preview’ and ‘Hide\nPreview’ shortcuts to Command-Shift-Option-P.)\n\n*Enjoy your new Finder shortcut!\n\n\nLet’s hope Apple doesn’t remove wonderful automation features like this in a future release of macOS as some are speculating. That would be a very sad day indeed.\n\nA: One solution is to use folder stacks on the dock. If you drag any folder to the right-side of the dock spacer, it will stay on the dock and give you quick access to that folder. By default there are stacks for the Downloads and the Documents folder on the dock. See this Apple support page for more details.\nIf you would prefer to keep your hands on the keyboard, you could also use Spotlight to quickly search for a file or folder. The default global hotkey for Spotlight is Command+Space. Then just type the name of the folder. There are also third-party alternatives like Alfred.\n\nA: *\n\n*Create a folder in your Desktop named Favorites and place in it aliases of the folders you want to open (drag each folder to Favorites while holding optioncommand). Then open Favorites, select all (⌘-A), open all (⌘-O)\n\n\nor...\n\n\n*\n\n*Save a list of the paths of your favorite folders in a text file named Favorites in your home (one per line). Then in Terminal do xargs open < ~/Favorites.\n\n\nA: Alfred. You can open a folder in Finder by invoking Alfred, typing a part of its name, and pressing return.\n\nIf you assign a custom shortcut for revealing files, you can quickly open folders in Finder from the file browser as well.\n\nThere's also a somewhat hidden way to assign a shortcut for showing the file browser (so you can open it by for example pressing F1 instead of ⌘+␣ and then ~).\n\n", "Q: Install OS X in VirtualBox on iMac? Is it possible to install OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard in VirtualBox on an iMac (i3) running OS X 10.6.8? I have the 10.6 install CD, DMG, and ISO, but can't get any of them to boot from VirtualBox.\n\nA: These instructions are for VirtualBox on Windows and Linux but they work well on OS X as well. Taken from here -- abridged and modified for OS X guest OS:\n\n\n*\n\n*Rip your original retail DVD of Snow Leopard in ISO format.\n\n*In VirtualBox, create a new virtual machine. Name it as you want, but select \"Mac OS X\" as the operating system, and \"Mac OS X Server\" as the version. Click next. Assign a good amount of RAM to the VM. I chose 1024 MB. Click next. Create a new virtual hard disk, I chose 20 GB of dynamically expanding storage. Click finish.\n\n*Open the settings for this new virtual machine, and in the Storage section, load the Snow Leopard ISO in the now empty CD/DVD device.\n\n*Now close VirtualBox (important!). Find the XML file that defines the virtual machine that you just created. This will be in ~/Library/VirtualBox/Machines/<name of the VM>/<name of the VM>.xml. Search this file in a text edit for the ExtraDataItem tags. After the last instance of ExtraDataItem tags add the following two, new, ExtraDataItem tags:\n<ExtraDataItem name=\"VBoxInternal2/EfiBootArgs\" value=\" \"/>\n<ExtraDataItem name=\"VBoxInternal2/SmcDeviceKey\" value=\"ourhardworkbythesewordsguardedpleasedontsteal(c)AppleComputerInc\"/>\n\n*Save and close the file.\n\n*Open VirtualBox and power on the virtual machine. The installation will start after some minutes. Choose your language. Now open Disk Utility under Utilities menu. Select the virtual disk and click Erase. Close it and you can now install OSX. Before that, you can choose to customize the installation. It can be interesting to disable extra language translations or printer support (you save about 2 GB).\n\nA: I have a SL 10.6.8 VBox running as we speak. It works perfectly, if a bit slowly. I'm about to abandon it for reasons totally unrelated to VirtualBox, but let's see if I can remember everything I did to get it running:\n1) Like the other answer said, start with a rip of an original SL DVD. Mine was 10.6.0.\n2) Also like the other answer, create the new VM, select Mac OS X Server (even if you're not using Server), assign >= 1GB of RAM (I'd give it at least 2GB if you can spare it), and mount your ripped DVD.\n3) Don't start the machine.\n4) Open up the machine settings and make sure all of the following are set:\nSystem > Motherboard > Chipset: ICH9\nSystem > Motherboard > Extended Features > Enable IO APIC (checked)\nSystem > Motherboard > Extended Features > Enable EFI (checked)\nSystem > Processor > Enable PAE/NX (checked)\nSystem > Acceleration > Enable VT-x/AMD-V (checked)\nSystem > Acceleration > Enable Nested Paging (checked)\nStorage > Here make sure the hard disk is attached to a SATA Controller of type AHCI.\nNetwork > Adapter 1 (or any other) > Adapter Type: Intel PRO/1000 T Server (82543GC)\nPorts > Serial Ports > Enable Serial Port (uncheck this)\nPorts > USB > Enable USB Controller (checked)\nPorts > USB > Enable USB 2.0 (checked)\n5) Start the machine and you should see the verbose boot mode (no gray Apple screen).\n6) Proceed with OS X install.\nThis is exactly what I did and have running now.

No patches, kexts or other hacks required.\nMy System: iMac 21.5\" Late 2009 (3.06GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, with 16GB RAM)\nVirtualBox version: 4.1.12 r77245 with extensions installed.\nI tried updating VirtualBox to 4.1.14, but that broke this VM somehow. Never quite figured out why, but that kept me from updating. Haven't tried 4.1.16 yet. If you can't it to install on the current version with these settings, maybe this is why?\nHope that helps!\n\nA: I have an old macbook(white 13\"). I could not update to Mavericks via AppStore because of my hardware(would not allow me to download). Currently on 10.6.8\nI installed latest version of virtualbox(4.3.6). I found 10.8.5 installesd.iso on web(don't recall where). Pretty much all default settings(40GB static HD in .vdi format, 2GB RAM, 128MB video memory). In the settings, the default controller is SATA, which worked for me. I added the installesd.iso to the virtual DVD drive and started the machine. Machine starts and you will see verbage for a couple of minutes, then you will get to the options screen of the install disk. Select \"disk utility\". In \"disk utility\" select the virtual HDD you have for the machine(the one at the very top of the list). Select \"partition\"-> 1 partition-> mac os extended(journaled) and click \"partition\" to partition the disk. Exit disk utility, then select re-install osx. Select your virtual HDD and install.\nTook fooooorrrrrrrreeeevvvvvveerrrrrrrrr! Said install of 20 min. Was more like 45 min. If screen goes white during install, it is just idle screen. Click back in machine window and it should show you current install status. Create acount as you would typically for mac and start using your mac.\nI can now upgrade my VM to Mavericks(currently downloading) on the bare metal that i could not upgrade.\n", "Q: Multi-selection of text in text areas (Chrome, Sparrow) will switch keyboard to \"Insert mode\" and overwrite too much text OSX 10.7.4, MacBook Air\nI've noticed that when I select text and attempt to replace it with additional text, some text areas will maintain the selection and cause me to errantly delete data from my text area. I can easily reproduce it in Chrome 19 or Sparrow 1.5, but I cannot reproduce this behavior in TextEdit or Textmate, however.\nTo reproduce:\n\n\n*\n\n*Type some text in a text area in Chrome or Sparrow: \"This is a test\"\n\n*Select \"This is\"\n\n*\"This is\" will be highlighted\n\n*Start typing. \"This is\" will immediately disappear, but the selection will remain and instead highlight \" a test\". I hit another keystroke, and it deletes the \"a test\", deselects, and goes back to normal.\n\n*Sometimes, however, it will remain selected for an indeterminate amount of time and I'll have inadvertently deleted most of a paragraph simply by typing a single word!\n\n\nIt seemingly does not work if I highlight a single word - it has to do with multi-word select and typing immediately after selecting.\nThis is kind of insane, bizarro behavior I've never seen from OS X. Any thoughts? It's driving me crazy. I've reproduced it with the built-in trackpad and the Magic Trackpad.\nFor reference, it's the same issue as reported here, yet unresolved (https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3756111?start=0&tstart=0)\n\nA: I think this behaviour can be attributed to Mac OS X's momentum scrolling. While you select the text the text is still being selected (due to the initial momentum of the mouse you used to select it). I can't be sure but this same thing keeps happening to me\n", "Q: Are Mac serial numbers sent to Apple? Is the serial number (of a MacBook Pro, OS X 10.7) ever sent to Apple? For instance, is it automatically sent during system updates or app store connections?\n\nA: To my knowledge, each and every time your Mac will send a serial number to Apple, you are prompted to explain this and why it will be sent as well as whatever information is needed.\nYou can see this in action from the System Information app:\n\nWhen you click the \"Check my service...\" item you will see this alert:\n\nSimilar notifications are presented when the App Store app needs to verify your specific Mac is entitled to Lion during a restore. The Console app (in the Utilities folder) can be configured to send your diagnostic information which includes the serial number as well as other information about the hard drive, software and error logs to Apple.\nYou can also ask Apple if they treat this information as personally identifiable from their main privacy page. From what I can tell, they go to great lengths to treat this as other sensitive information and go out of the way to not lump it with your personal account other than when you do that by asking for service from AppleCare or registering your Mac.\n\nA: When you first go through the installation screens, the serial # can be paired with the Apple ID if you opt in to the registration and that information is presumably sent securely to Apple's servers for registration purposes.\nSerial numbers, or any other of your identification information do not appear in crash logs or diagnostic information transmitted to Apple.\n", "Q: How can I use a keyboard shortcut to go to my Dropbox folder How can I change the Finder keyboard shortcut command + shift + D to open my Dropbox folder instead of the Desktop folder.\n\nA: System Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > select Application Shortcuts in the left column > click the \"+\" button > Application = Finder, Menu Title = Dropbox, Keyboard Shortcut = whatever you like > click Add\ntest it out. worked great for me from Finder\nNote that this uses the Finder's \"Go to > Recent Folders\" Submenu.

To access the Dropbox folder from an application dialog box, you can drag the Dropbox folder into the \"Favorites\" section of the application save/open dialog box to access it within one click.\nOk, if you're still interested in a hot-key anyway to access the dropbox folder, \nhere's how to do it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Automator: Cmd-Spacebar, type in Automator.\n\n*Select Service, click Choose\n\n*Modify \"Service receives selected [text] in [any application]\" to:  \"Service receives [no input] in [any application]\"\n\n*Select the action \"Run Shell Script\" under Utilities, drag it over to the right pane.\n\n*Change the \"cat\" command to \"open ~/Dropbox\".

Your folder and its new shortcut are now listed in Finder's menubar under \"Go / Recent Folders\". \nAssuming you visit your Dropbox folder frequently enough, this will work in Finder navigation.

I've just started using VMware, and I am admittedly a novice Mac user. Anyways, I installed Windows 7 on my iMac, and I've been playing this little indie game that requires the use of the insert and home keys. My keyboard doesn't have those keys available.\nIs there a way to remap keys so that they are only remapped within Windows? If not, what is my best option?\n\nA: The answer to the question is yes, you can.\nVMware Fusion (from v2) provides this built-in to the application (and incidentally Parallels provides almost identical functionality)\nUnder VMware Preferences -> Keyboard & Mouse you can turn on/off the mapping of keys to other functions.\nThis document over on VMware's document repository itemises how.\nThis video over on Vimeo shows how it works in practice (the video shows it working in Fusion 2, but the functionality hasn't changed drastically since).\n", "Q: How to jailbreak iPad2 3G 4.3.5?

Thanks.\n\nA: Yeah, I think you may have missed your window.\nIt seems that a 5.1.1 jailbreak is not too far away (if the jailbreak rumour mill is to be believed), so you might just have to wait it out for that.\n", "Q: Repair disk on Snow Leopard using a bootable USB, in order to upgrade to Lion I read in many places that you should always do a \"Verify Disk\" in Disk Utility and resolve any errors before upgrading to Lion (currently running the last version of Snow Leopard on a MacBook Pro mid 2010).\nI get the following error(s): \"Incorrect number of thread records\" and \"Incorrect volume file count\"\n\nQuestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*What is the severity of these errors? Should I be concerned?\n\n*I just finished \"restoring\" a USB thumb drive to a Mac OS Install DVD for Snow Leopard 10.6.3 (mid-2010). Note that the USB drive is equivalent to the install DVD and not an actual installed OS.  As I understand it, it is possible to boot from my newly minted Mac OS Install USB to run the \"Repair Disk\" without entering the OS.  (where I can fix my problem and go about my business).\nIs my understanding correct?  Does running the Repair Disk (from a USB, or in general) pose any risks? Is there anything else I should know?\nI have a Time Machine backup going, if that makes any difference.\n\nA: Using an installer image that is bootable, whether DVD or USB or simply an external partition, is always a good idea when repairing disc problems, because it allows the partition you need to check to be fully unused for the duration of the check.  Otherwise it's trying to fix itself, whilst running the OS and the fix actions at the same time.  So feel free to use whatever media you have to initiate a repair, the Disk Utility program is available in any OS X install media, just boot from it and select from the menu.\n", "Q: Can I format new MacBook hard drive from OSX DVD? I have to install a fresh new drive into my MacBook pro 2009.\nI haven't formatted yet, nor do I have a USB dock to do so from my current osx installation.\nIf I install the new drive and boot from the osx DVD that came with my Mac, will be able to do what's necessary to get every running ok?\n\nA: Yes, you have full access to the Disk Utility program from within the installer process, so you can partition and format to your hearts content.\n", "Q: If my timemachine was done with lion, but my host is snow leopard, how will it restore? What I want is for my Mac to go back to exactly as it was, which was with lion.\nOf course, there's no lion disk, so I've done a clean reinstall with snow leopard (new drive).\nShould I restore from a lion timemachine onto snow leopard, or just install snow leopard, re install lion from the Mac store, and then restore from the time machine?\n\nA: You should be able to point the installer at Time Machine during setup.  This will make the OS you have on there now largely irrelevant.  Just ensure your drive is USB attached, and hold option ⌥ down as you boot, select your installer CD for Snow Leopard, and do it from there.\nThe following Support Article should help\n\n\nRestoring your entire system from a backup\nIf you are restoring a backup made by a Mac to the same Mac\nWith your backup drive connected, start up your Mac from the Lion\n  recovery partition (Command-R at startup) or Mac OS X v10.6\n  installation disc.

I don't know the original owner and it's out of warranty. \nOn the display is a series of tan or yellowish horizontal lines - all an approximate inch apart, for a total of about eight or so. The spacing between is regular. They're wider (about an inch wide) at the left and right edges of the screen and taper to nothing at the middle of the screen. They are particularly noticeable on light-colored or white backgrounds, such as a Pages document, most web sites, etc.\nI'm certainly open to disassembling the iMac and getting at whatever it may be (the onboard GPU?) that's causing the problem. In fact I have opened the machine for an HD replacement and fanned and cleaned, but to no result. \nI also use smcFanControl to boost the fans, as I thought it may be poor cooling in the machine, but this has no effect.\nDoes any one have ideas or suggestions as to what is causing these discolored lines?\n\n\nA: This looks like a backlight uniformity issue.\nThis is where the screen isn't being evenly lit by the CCFL bulbs behind it. Some of them are outputting differing amounts of light and cause this perceived 'discolouration'. The lighter colours really do show it.\nUnfortunately, this is one of the disadvantages of a CCFL backlight system as opposed to something like LED backlighting - backlight uniformity can become an issue, especially with time.\nYou'd be looking at a screen replacement - outside of warranty, that's gonna cost you.\n\nA: If you boot the Mac holding the option key, this will have the firmware drive the screen and isolate any software corruption or odd driver bugs in most cases and let you know it's a hardware issue.\nUsually vertical lines are the LCD failing - then a cable issue - lastly the GPU.\nUsually horizontal lines are a cabling issue - then a GPU issue - lastly a LCD issue.\nThat's not to say you even have a hardware failure. Do post a picture and we can refine things based on the actual failure.\n\nA: Translation by google off the content above:  \nThe lower plastic layer diffuser matrix is yellowing with time, and the lamp loses brightness, as a result - the common yellow color images and brightness differences (strip) from the brightness is insufficient.

I already repeated the procedures more than twice. What am I going to do?\n\nA: Contact the iTunes Store, let them know you are trying to verify your account and are not receiving any email. Also make sure to mention [if you did] that you checked the spam/junk folder and that your email on the account is correct [make sure it is].\nThey will provide further assistance from there and they'll most likely be able to enable it for you with some verification information.\n", "Q: Reading List in other browsers? Is there a Reading List extension for Chrome? I have a deep, dark hatred of Safari, but Reading List seems more convenient than Pocket of Readability. Or, is there a way to access it by any non-safari means at all?\n\nA: On a Mac the reading list is stored in /Users/notjonathan/Library/Safari/Bookmarks.plist so potentially there is a tool out there to read them automatically. The actual syncing is done by Safari. It doesn't just watch the file for changes and upload the changes. You actually have to make the changes from within Safari.\nSo what you're \"stuck\" with using services like Pocket, which although slightly less convenient in iOS safari, is imo better. Especailly as other apps, e.g. Tweetbot can integrate with Pocket, but not Safari Reading List.\nThere is bookmarklet for Pocket available, which you can use in iOS Safari to quickly add pages, with just a few more presses than pressing Add To Reading List.\n\nA: All reading list is a simple wrapper around bookmarks, that allows you quick access to both add and remove entries.  It's usefulness stops there really, and the matter of convenience boils down to what you want to use the stored pages for, and how you wish to access them.  If you are just using the same computer and will always have a net connection, then yes it's very convenient, but if you want to have them stored offline and synced to multiple devices, then it's not so useful.\nI don't use Chrome, but I would probably look to get an extension  for either Pocket/Readability/Instapaper to mimic the reading list feature, by making your recently stored pages available from a toolbar button rather than having to login to the respective sites.  This gives you all the added benefits of using a proper 'service', with the instant nature of a quick bookmark system.  A quick search for \"instapaper\" yielded 50 results on the Chrome extension store thing \n\nA: To add the active tab in Google Chrome to Safari's reading list:\nAdapted from a comment by tzarskyz on: Add a URL from Chrome to Safari's reading list\ntell application \"Google Chrome\"\n    set pageUrl to get URL of active tab of first window\nend tell\ntell application \"Safari\" to add reading list item pageUrl\ndisplay notification pageUrl with title \"Added to Reading List\"\n\nOpen AppleScript Editor and save the above code as a new script.  From that point on, you can run this script to add the active tab in Google Chrome to Safari's reading list.  You can trigger this action via Terminal (osascript), by double-clicking the script (in Terminal or on your desktop), via an app launcher like Quicksilver, via Fastscripts, etc.\nEnjoy your reading! :)\n\n\nUpdate: I've since found a better way to accomplish this, without requiring something like Fastscripts.  Simply use OS X's built-in application, Automator.  You can adapt the steps outlined at the following link to run the AppleScript I included above: Global HotKey for Pause/Play,Next Song, etc. \n\nA: You can add things with AppleScript according to this: http://jga.me/blog/2011/10/18/applescript-readinglist\nSo it should be easy to cook up a Firefox extension to call that bit of AppleScript, you can call it form the shell like:\nosascript -e 'tell application \"Safari\" to add reading list item \"http://totl.net/\"'\n\nWhich will cause Safari to generate the preview and send it to iCloud, or wherever it goes to.\n\nA: I've made a fork of CloudyTabs with Reading list support, clone it at https://github.com/cl3m/CloudyTabs\n\nA: There's a built-in Service to add a URL to the Reading List. Just select the URL by clicking on the address bar, then menu > Firefox > Services > Add to Reading List.\nIt's possible to add a global keyboard shortcut for the Service: System Settings > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Select the service in the list and add a key combo.\n\nA: Just a quick addition here.  I love the small menu application called PopClip.  It enables many different functions to be peformed on highlighted text.  One such add-on function is: \"Add to reading list.\"  Worked like a charm for me (and is system wide- so even links within e-mails can be added).

Need tips I'm using MacBook Pro and it will be in charge nearly 12 hours in a day. I set the battery indicator to  Percentage, so it is displaying the battery charge in percentage.\nThe problem I faced is, most of the time it showing 100%, but in some times, it stops (I don't know exactly) charging in 97% or in 99%. For a long time, it remains same until I discharge the battery then put again in charge.\n\nWhat is the problem here?\nAm I using the battery in the right way?\n\nA: This is by design. It's not helpful to fully charge a battery, and then use a little bit (say 2 or 3%) and then top it back up again. So purposefully, if you have fully charged your battery, it will not start to recharge it until such time as it has lost sufficient charge for a recharge to be worthwhile. It's all about charging your battery efficiently, resulting in minimal wear and tear where possible.\nSo, to try to illustrate it by example:\n\n\n*\n\n*You start with a flat battery, and charge it. It gets to 100%\n\n*You move desks or something, resulting in a few minutes of battery usage, dropping it to 98%, then put it back on power\n\n*The system decides it's not worth topping up 2% worth, and just sits there.  The green light probably shows on the Magsafe to indicate that it's not even trying to charge, likewise the menubar icon shows a plug indicating full charge, rather than the lightning bolt charging indicator\n\n*You use some more battery, say dropping it to 92%, before putting it back on charge.  The system now decides that 8% is worth bothering about, and starts to charge.\n\n", "Q: Hide webloc extension I know that I can hide all extensions but how do I hide just one, say webloc? I don't want to hide each the extension of each file individually.\n\nA: The only thing I could find, suggested by Benjamin Schollnick, here., is this:\n\nfind -x /path/to/folder -name *.webloc -exec chflags hidden {} +\n\nIt will hide the extension for existing files, therefore, you will need to run it again for newly created files.\nAlthought in the original question its said for Leopard, I guess it will work for Lion too.\n", "Q: Lion upgrade from Mac App store seems to have frozen I am trying to upgrade to Lion from Snow Leopard. After beginning the download/install process from the Mac App store everything seemed normal. However after about 20 minutes my entire MBP is frozen. Trackpad and keyboard do nothing, and the mouse pointer is not visible on the screen. \nThe screen is stuck at where it was before: looking at the Lion page in the Mac app store. \nIt's now been about 15-20 minutes of waiting at the frozen screen. Is it safe to restart the computer and start the process anew?\n\nA: Although it says Install the Mac App Store just downloads the Installer. Therefore, if you didn't run the Installer, the MBP froze while downloading, so it is safe to restart the computer and process with it.\n", "Q: iPhone text messages I do not want my new iPhone to open text messages automatically when I tap the icon because of this recent scam thing with \"you've won a prize\". I've gotten that message 3 times so far, and I have to wait until someone sends me another message to keep it from opening automatically.  Last night, I asked someone to send a message, they sent it, and I was able to go into text messaging & delete the \"prize\" message without opening it.  It popped back up within a short time, so I would like to be able to select text message without my iPhone automatically opening the message if there is only one new one. \n\nA: I had a google, and found this for background reading.\nUnlike email, which has the potential to be abused without your consent merely by opening a message, there is no risk attached to simply viewing such messages provided they are received over the SMS network.  They may contain links that you do not want to visit, but they cannot visit those links for you without your direct consent (and indeed action to click it).  So if you receive such messages, simply delete them.  For peace of mind, don't delete the message directly (there is a small change a swipe could go wrong and leave you clicking the link by accident) just drop back to the recipient list, and delete the conversation.\n\nA: If you hit the lock button twice, the slider on the unlock screen won't go directly to the app. \n\nA: I'm afraid I have to disagree. Here in Argentina those \"scam\" SMS are risky. The simple act of opening one of those messages allows the company to charge you a monthly fee just for receiving more SMS (scams) daily. I know it's an abuse from the phone company allowing this, but it's happening here. Consumers are not protected in Argentina, that's why they worked around this Iphone flaw. \n", "Q: Remux Videos for iTunes Playability? What video formats are usable within iTunes, specifically for syncability/playability on iOS devices?\nI understand that we're talking about a number of different things here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Container format\n\n*Video codec\n\n*Audio codec\n\n*Subtitle format\n\n\nI have a fairly extensive library of many different kinds of videos, and the prevailing formats are MKV and AVI.  I don't really know what codecs are most common in my library, but they pretty much fall under the generic MPEG4 banner, I suppose.\nWhenever I research this question on my own, Google results are saturated with transcoding utilities (both paid and free).  Sure, transcoding makes for a simple \"one click and it magically makes my home video play on my iPad\" solution, but for my library it presents a few problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*Loss of quality\n\n*Significant investment in time and computing resources\n\n\nIs it possible that most of what I have is close enough and just needs to be re-muxed into a different container format?  Is there a utility (even command-line) which I could try for this?  How would I use that utility to remux and not transcode?\n\nA: I have been fighting this issue myself, with some success - but mostly, I have reverted to getting more of my collection in MP4 in the first place.\nSubler is a must have to begin. It effortlessly does remuxing of MKV to MP4, including soft subtitles and iTunes Metadata. So for most MKVs, it is a breeze to get them into iTunes in a tidy manner.\nWhen it comes to AVI and other formats, it's a bit trickier. AVI tend to be used with video codecs such as DivX or XviD, and although they could be remuxed into an MP4 container, it seems iTunes will not read it.\nIf you wanna play around with remuxing, your best bet is ffmpeg. You will need to compile it yourself or Google for binaries.\nI'd advice you to convert your MKVs using Subler, and to re-rip/re-download the AVIs in a newer format where possible. What is left you can transcode using Handbrake.\n", "Q: Any ideas why my copy and paste are acting weird? I'm on a Macbook Pro (mid-2009) running Lion 10.7.4. Everything has been awesome these past few years, but something weird started happening a month ago: my copy/paste has been acting oddly. Sometimes I copy text and when I paste, it would be something I had copied earlier. I chalked this up to an incorrect keystroke on my part. But even when I pay attention closely this still happens somewhat infrequently.\nEven more bizarre is when I cut text (just to be sure my keystrokes worked), I would see the text disappear, but when I paste what's in the clipboard, it would paste something older. huh? I'd then have to undo a few times to restore the text I cut out.\nI've ruled out hardware issues with my keyboard since this happens even when I do it with my mouse (using PopClip which pops up iOS style copy/paste buttons). \nI am not running any clipboard utilities so I am stumped. If this is a hardware issue, I'd love to know that soon because my AppleCare runs out in a few weeks. Thanks for any tips or leads.\n\nA: Given that this is almost certainly not a hardware issue (there is, after all, no copy/paste chip that performs that function) and given the troubleshooting steps you have included, this still sounds like a task for your local Genius Bar. If it's a configuration issue or a software conflict, they can help you sort it out, and if it's a bug in OS X, they'll make Apple aware of it so it can be fixed.\nAs other answers have mentioned, you still have to isolate software as a cause by trying a new user or a new install of the OS (perhaps to an external drive). \n\nA: Do you have several user accounts setup on your Mac ? Does it occur on every account ?\nThe idea here is to find out if the issue is specific to one user or is affecting the whole system.\nIf it just occurs on your session, you could try to delete the contents of the Library/Caches inside your Home folder. No need to delete the folder, just put its contents to the Trash.\nThen log out/log back in or reboot your Mac.\n", "Q: Error with MATLAB I regularly use MATLAB from the command-line instead of launching the full graphical user interface. Ever since I made the last update of OS from 10.7.3 -> 10.7.4, I started getting the following errors, whenever I would launch something with a graphical interface within MATLAB:\nMay 17 10:35:40 HOST_NAME MATLAB_maci64[549] <Error>: CGContextGetCTM: invalid context 0x0 \nMay 17 10:35:40 HOST_NAME MATLAB_maci64[549] <Error>: CGContextSetBaseCTM: invalid context 0x0 \nMay 17 10:35:40 HOST_NAME MATLAB_maci64[549] <Error>: CGContextGetCTM: invalid context 0x0 \nMay 17 10:35:40 HOST_NAME MATLAB_maci64[549] <Error>: CGContextSetBaseCTM: invalid context 0x0\n\nThis is how I usually launch MATLAB from the command line:\nmatlab -nodesktop -nosplash\n\nRecently, I've read of other Java based applications with GUIs having the same problem. Just wondering if there is a quick fix for this.\n** This is becoming really annoying, I can't seem to find a solution, I'm using 2011a is anyone seeing this with a more recent version?\n\nA: I can confirm having this problem with Matlab 2011a on Lion 10.7.4.  But fortunately it seems to be fixed in Matlab 2011b -- no more annoying CGContext errors.\nSo it's definitely worth it to grab a more recent version of Matlab.\n", "Q: Can I play YouTube video in background on iPad ? \nPossible Duplicate:\nAn app to play youtube in background on ipad \n\nIf I want to listen to a Youtube video and work on another app, such as Safari, is there a way for that audio to run in the background like iTunes does?\n\nA: Like @Ermiar said, yes, but if the app in the foreground wants to play music or sounds itself, the sound from the Youtube app will be stopped.\nAlso, the Youtube app can, like iTunes, continue t play if you lock your iPad with the lock key, and you can also control it by double clicking the home button while the iPad is locked.\n\nA: If you use the YouTube app to play your video and then switch to another app, YouTube will be in background like iTunes does.\nYou can control the YouTube video by double clicking the home button then swipe to left on the multitask drawer to access controls.\n", "Q: Mail.app: weird, huge numbers of messages in title bar, Time Machine quit working A friend has been having problems with Mail. Notably, Time Machine is no longer working within Mail, and Mail says it has huge and seemingly arbitrary numbers of messages in the title bar.\nFor example, while looking at a folder that clearly has just a couple dozen messages, the title bar says something like: \"Inbox (6487431079 messages, 524981056 unread)\". This is similar, with different numbers, for every mailbox. We ran out of time and I did not try it on a brand new mailbox.\nThis happened after my friend switched Internet providers, and all his old email disappeared. I tried \"Mailbox --> Rebuild\" to no avail. While in Mail, Time Machine showed no messages backed up since the switch, and no messages at all prior to the switch. He was using POP for both providers.\nUsing Finder, I looked through his backup disk, and found the old email and restored it manually, but it still has those strange numbers, and Time Machine does not work within Mail, although it still seems to be backing up his ~/Library/Mail folder.\nI tried quitting Mail, deleting his ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.mail.* files, and re-starting, but no change in the weird numbers.\nHe was quite behind in updates, and I cycled through Software Update until nothing else installed -- still weird numbers. (This is Snow Leopard.)\nIs there some other preferency file I should be deleting to fix this? Any other ideas?\n\nA: I remember solving an issue similar to this, one or two years ago. I don't have a Snow Leopard system handy so unfortunately I cannot be absolutely sure as to the process required. The steps below are what I would do for a Lion system with some notes attached where possible adaptations would be required.\nAs you suspected, the problem is due to a file becoming corrupt.\nSolution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit Mail if it is open.\n\n*In Finder, go to ~/Library/Mail and backup the folder contents\n\n*While still in ~/Library/Mail, open the subfolder called V2. Inside that folder there should be a folder called MailData, open that folder.\n(If you do not see a folder called V2 or a folder called MailData, it is because the folder structure may have changed between OS versions. Proceed to step four in this case.)\n\n*There are a few possible files which may need to be removed from the User's mail folder. In the MailData folder (or if you do not have a MailData folder) search for and move the following files to the Desktop:\n\n\n(I suggest removing them one at a time and relaunching Mail after removing each file. If it works, your job is done.)\n\n\n*\n\n*DefaultCounts\n\n*LSMMap2\n\n*Envelope Index   --  (If you have to delete this file, delete the following two at the same time)\n\n*Envelope Index-shm\n\n*Envelope Index-wal\n\n\nA possible pitfall to this method: There is a possibility all messages in folders could get marked as Unread. Depending on the users workflow, this could also be a problem; though a solvable problem through sorting read and unread messages temporarily into different folders and recombining later. \n", "Q: How to find out why it takes so long for the sign in form to appear after opening the lid on my Macbook Air Whenever I open the lid on my Macbook Air running Lion and and try to sign in, it takes a really long time for the sign in form to appear.

Sometimes the form shows up, and sometimes the screen just goes black, at which point I have to close and reopen the lid for the sign in form to show up.\nThis is a corporate machine, and a coworker thought it was waiting for Wi-Fi to reconnect, but the problem still exists when I turn Wi-Fi off. What's really going on? I would imagine that not all Macs have this problem. How can I figure out why this is happening? Could installed software be preventing the computer from waking quickly? If so, is there a way to track down the culprit?\n\nA: The MBA goes into hibernate mode after several hours of being asleep. Also, if you close it and then open it again rapid the computer will be mid-cycle in going to sleep and will want to finished that before attempting to wake up (which can take some time also).

I have just recently upgraded from iOS 4.3.5 to iOS 5.1.1 on my 3rd generation iPod touch, but it seems that my iPod is slower and a little unresponsive, so I want to downgrade back to 4.3.5. \nI want to know how to backup the data (mainly game saves) so that when I restore to 4.3.5 my game save is still there.\n\nA: iTunes will backup the data, but there is another option.  You can also bring your game saves back to your downgraded firmware, but it will take some work.\nHere is a walkthrough focusing specifically on Angry Birds, but you could use the same process for other games as well.\n\nA: No, you will not lose your data.\nI'm not sure that iTunes will let you downgrade your device - iTunes has been unforgiving with regretted upgrades since iOS 5 was released. However, if you download the firmware file (IPSW) from here, and press the modifier key while clicking \"restore\" in iTunes, you may be able to give it a shot. (The modifier key is Shift on Windows and Option on Mac.) Before you do this, you're going to want to take a backup.\nIn iTunes, secondary click (right click or control click) on your device and select \"backup\" from the menu.  After the backup is complete, you can go ahead and try to downgrade, as described above. Once the restore is complete, iTunes will prompt you to set up your iPod - either as a new device, or from a backup. You'll want to select your backup, naturally.\niOS devices keep apps on a separate partition from the firmware, so your game data should be safe.  \n", "Q: Remove admin account A colleague of mine just got his new MacBook Pro and he ran through the set-up process.

AirPlay is very convenient to bring up the sound on my big stereo speakers, but I am wondering whether the AirPlay protocol preserves audio quality, e.g. bitrate?\nI understand that if the WiFi is poor, audio may be interrupted, but when it is good, shouldn't it be possible to transfer the exact copy, considering the relative low bitrate of e.g. Apple Lossless? The other possible option is that Apple transcodes audio before it goes over AirPlay, e.g. to AAC.\nAnyone got a clue?\n\nA: I always thought that the Express had a decoder inside, so it could just receive the digital data. Much more robust against bad connectivity.\nAlso, from Wikipedia:\n\nAn often-overlooked feature of the AirPort Express is that it uses an audio connector that combines a 3.5 mm jack socket and a mini-TOSLINK optical digital transmitter, allowing connection to an external digital-to-analog converter (DAC) or amplifier with internal DAC. This allows iTunes (and other applications which can stream to the device, such as Rogue Amoeba's Airfoil) to output a bitstream instead of analog audio. DTS-encoded CDs ripped to Apple Lossless audio files which decode as digital noise in iTunes will play back correctly when the AirPort Express is connected via TOSLINK to a DTS-compatible amplifier–Decoder.\n\n", "Q: How to move hosting from mobile.me to iCloud?

There are a number of limitations for VOIP apps and music players to allow them to stay running, but in your case what would probably work best is a local notification that uses a custom notification sound. This allows you to register a notification for the time of the alarm which will be triggered regardless, as it will not be your app doing the work, but the OS instead which obviously maintains the notifications daemon at all times. Certainly for a \"real\" push notification you can then have a custom sound, I recall the demo at the relevant WWDC where an ESPN app used a clip of music from their TV channel as the sound, but I am unsure if you can acheive the same with a local one - I don't see any reason why not. Obviously there will be limits on file size and possibly length also, so a full track of music may not be possible.\n", "Q: iTunes app on iPhone won't download podcasts If I browse podcasts in iTunes on my (iOS 5.1.1) iPhone 4, most listings of episodes don't even fully load, with the download buttons (or sometimes the entire listing) failing to render. The exact same podcasts on my wife's iPhone 4S on the same wifi network work perfectly.\nThere's almost 20 GB of space available in my iPhone, and I've tried ending all apps & rebooting the phone multiple times.\n\nA: I feel like I helped my brother through something VERY similar involving downloaded/purchased music -- and the only thing we found that fixed it was a complete restore from his most recent backup. I surmised that it was something related to a horked cache file or setting at the OS level.\nThe other thing that it might have been related to was wifi syncing/backup; we also turned that off, if I recall, and it wasn't until it was turned off that things returned to copacetic.\nThis is all fuzzy memory from months ago, though, so YMMV.\n\nA: I had a similar experience and decided that Apple wasn't resolving the post-iOS 5 & iCloud issues with podcast support as quickly as I hoped.  I did some research, and switched to Instacast on my iPhone for audio podcasts, and Instacast HD on my iPad for video podcasts.\nThis switch addressed all of my issues and created very few.  The cost was minimal and I got several additional features that I consider useful.\n", "Q: Renewal of App Store Developer Contract (Paid Applications) I've registered with Apple for a Paid applications contract about a year ago and the contract renewal is due in late June.\nSince the initial application (registering as an individual) was done manually (and sent via Fax - as a Greek national), I'm not sure about the renewal process. \n\n\n*\n\n*Is the procedure automatic? \n\n*Will I be notified (hopefully) in time by Apple itself so that I resubmit my initial subscription application or what?\n\n\nA: Don't worry. You will receive instructions by email. You'll have to refill the form with your CC info and fax it again (I'm in BG, done this twice already).\n\nA: I'm in the US, and I've registered online. Contrary to what one might think, even online renewal is not automatic. I believe, as mspasov said, you should receive an email from Apple Developer with more information on renewal.\n", "Q: Can I delete my audio collection after syncing it with iTunes Match? About a year ago I switched over from using iTunes to Rdio. It's been fantastic. Since everything is in the cloud, I can simply \"add\" albums to my collection rather than having to go through the painful process of downloading and syncing.\nThe only thing stopping me from using Rdio exclusively is the fact that they still don't have the rights to stream music from bands like Led Zeppelin, Metallica, and Tool (bands that no human being should have to live without). So I've still kept a huge mp3 collection on my local hard drive. I'd love to be able to just delete all those files if I can find an easy way to stream them online.\nIs there a way that I can sync my local collection to the cloud using iTunes Match and then just delete all the local mp3 files? I've read countless articles about iTunes Match but it does tend to get a bit confusing, especially for someone like me who ideally just wants 0 bytes of music data stored locally.\n\nA: I ended up signing up for iTunes Match over the weekend and I figured I'd share my experience to anyone who had the same questions I did...\nAfter going through and organizing my collection I came up with about 250 artists and just over 10k songs in total. I signed up for iTunes Match and it did a fantastic job of collecting the metadata, matching available songs, and uploading remaining songs. There were a few small issues with some ineligible songs and duplicates, but nothing major. I'd say it took about 24 hours total to get everything synced up, but I'm sure experiences vary widely here.\nThen after double-checking everything I just went ahead and deleted all my files in iTunes. I would click a given set of songs and then tap the delete key. When prompted, I would select NOT to delete from iCloud, but to move the local files to the trash.\nAfter I was finished I had a clean local hard drive and all my music was available for streaming from the cloud... which is precisely what I wanted. When I enabled iTunes Match on my other computer (which had a blank iTunes Music section), it took all of five seconds to sync up perfectly with my collection in the cloud.\nSo I'm now able to stream music from iTunes on my Macbook Pro and iMac. Those who are looking to stream to iOS might be out of luck, because from what I've seen you have to download the songs from iCloud to your device (although the songs will play as they are downloading... and I suppose there is nothing to stop you from deleting the files afterward).\nBut this ended up being a perfect solution for me since I primarily use Rdio now anyway. I just wanted to delete the 100GB worth of local mp3 files that were cluttering my local hard drive and iTunes Match helped me to do that and still keep my collection out there in the cloud.\nThere still isn't a perfect solution in the music technology world just yet, but I can't say enough good things about services like Rdio and iTunes Match. They've worked great for me.\n\nA: Yes - you can delete all your music files and then depend on the cloud. \nThe other answers about lots of clicking to delete or re-download the songs are not correct as there's no need to click 10k times to download all your files.  Select-All, right click, Download.  Ta da!\nThe only downside is uploads can deduplicate songs and not need to upload the majority of your library. Downloading an entire library if you ever want to get out of paying for the service might take weeks and unless you have unlimited data - run you into bandwidth caps and overage charges. \n\nA: iTunes Match is not a streaming solution but primarily a cloud storage for music/audio files. So yes, you can upload all your music to iTunes Match and delete it locally. But whenever you listen to a song it gets downloaded and stored locally again. There is nothing preventing you from deleting it again after listening of course.\n\nA: I don't have much to add, except that I found this to be a clear article on the subject of removing the files once they've been synced to iTunes Match, with screenshots.\nOnly very slightly out of date with the release of iTunes 11, but this article from Apple still worked for me. \nYou might feel even better, as I did, if you backup your music to an external hard drive, just in case.\n", "Q: Force style of push notification? I was wondering - is there a way to force how a push notification will appear to the iPhone user? There are 3 options in settings for the user to choose - none, some kind of top banner that dissappears after a short time and an alert with buttons.\nThe problem is, while developing an application for iPhone, I found out that using the didReceiveRemoteNotification function did not return any results if I didn't click on that top banner. This doesn't seem to be firing up even when the application is taken to the foreground.\nI need those data provided by this function to act upon in my application.\nThanks for your time!\n\nA: Yep, there is no way for you to do this.

Tables in iWork by default are set to automatically detect the type of text that is entered in each cell. If iWork sees a number (of any type) it converts it a Western character. Luckily it is possible to change this. \nOpen the inspector and go to the table settings section. Under the table settings section you are presented with two other sections (\"Table\" and \"Format\"). Select \"Format\" and you will see that you can set the \"Cell Format\" of a table. Select the table in your document and and click on the \"Cell Format\" drop-down menu. As you will see, the current option is set to \"Automatic.\" Change this to \"Text\" and you will no longer have the problem of iWork changing your input to Western characters!\n\nNote: You may be forced to manually create and enter the values in the table using the character viewer or copy and paste individual characters from Wikipedia in each cell AFTER initializing the table to have the \"Text\" cell format. Copying and pasting the entire table from Wikipedia seems to override any initial formatting (in the form of cell format) in iWork.\n", "Q: Password protect MacBook while keeping iTunes running So I want to prevent anyone from messing with iTunes, or anything on my MacBook actually.

I just upgraded to OS X Lion (10.7.4) and one of the new features I read about was the ability to arrange the Applications folder by Application Category in the Finder.\nI did this and the applications are properly broken out by category, but they are not sorted alphabetically within each category. For example, in the Utilities category, the apps are listed as \"Font Book, Automator, Launchpad, Dashboard, Mission Control\" etc...\nIs there any way to use the \"arrange by category\" feature and sort alphabetically within each category?\n\nA: In Icon view, try sorting alphabetically (without categories) and then sort by categories. The apps in each category should stay alphabetically ordered.\nIn List view, hit ⌘-J to see the view options. You can choose to \"Arrange By\" Application Category and to \"Sort By\" Name.\n\nA: Arrange the Applications folder by Application Category, then Ctrl-click or right-click on any application. Select 'Show View Options'. On the fourth line, select 'Sort by' and 'Name'. \n\nA: Finder has two separate sorting modes in Lion. If you hold option, the View > Arrange By menu turns into Sort By. You can also change the Sort By mode from the view options.\n\n", "Q: Use iPod touch to connect phone to car stereo I have a iPod touch 4, paired to Boss 758DBI in-dash car stereo. Why can't I use Bluetooth on iPod to pair my phone?\nWould like to do this so that I can have a handsfree conversation through my car stereo.\nMy iPod has a built-in mic and Bluetooth and a dock in my car.\n\nA: Bluetooth devices are designed to function under certain \"profiles\". This is what allows a headset to work with Skype versus Bluetooth headphones which might work with iTunes. Apple's iOS uses very restrictive setup with their Bluetooth profiles. Because of this you cannot pair an iPod touch to a mobile phone.\nHere is a list of the supported Bluetooth profiles: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3647\n\nA: iPods aren't set up (nor do they have drivers) to pair to arbitrary devices. It might be possible (though I doubt it) to make an app that'd pretend to be a Bluetooth headset to a paired phone; I don't know of any apps that offer that feature.\nDoes your phone have a physical line-out (even through an adapter) that you could connect to your car stereo?\n\nA: According to the manual for your car stereo, you should be able to pair your iPhone to the stereo to enable the Bluetooth phone functionality. Just follow the instructions in the manual. Whether or not you have your iPod Touch attached to the stereo's dock or AUX input is irrelevant; the Touch is not involved in the Bluetooth connection at all. The Bluetooth connection, the AUX connection and the iPod (dock) connections are completely separate inputs to the stereo, and you select which input you want using the stereo's MODE (Input Select) switch.\n", "Q: Linus Torvalds and the OS X Filesystem Back in 2008, Linus Torvalds famously said in an interview that \"OS X in some ways is actually worse than Windows to program for. Their file system is complete and utter crap, which is scary.\" I've looked for more details about why he feels this way about the OS X filesystem (HFS+ presumably) but I haven't been able to find anything.\nLinus surely doesn't dislike the basic Unix filesystem model, and I doubt he hates HFS+ for being case-insensitive. And despite how provocatively his comment is phrased, I doubt that it's completely without merit. Since the comment was in the context of programming for OS X, I suspect his opinion may have been based on performance, robustness, the operating system interface, or something along those lines. Does anyone know what complaints 2008-era Linus might have had with 2008-era HFS+?\n\nA: Although I´m not an Operating System expert, and I´ve just started using OSX after coming from Windows, I consider myself a PowerUser in Windows, and fairly competent in Linux. Coming from that background, I´ve been surprised that in a fairly modern OS like OSX, the filesystem has quirks such as the way the names of files are \"mungled\".\nI understand that Linus´ issues with HFS+ stem from the same point: from what I've found researching the issue, HFS+ stores the names of files using Unicode, but when a file uses \"extended\" or NON-ASCII characters (like á, é, í, ó, ú, ñ from Spanish or things like the ü in German), for which Unicode provides 2 ways of encoding the name, OSX silently \"normalizes\" the encoding at storage time... Not a real issue when the file has been created and consumed in OSX, but when you're sharing information with users of other OSs, the fact that the name of the file changes, makes for all sort of weird behaviours...\nCase in point: I've been tracking my work \"artifacts\" (files, documents, etc) in Subversion for the last 8plus years. When moving to Mac, I got the SVN client for Mac, and after doing a Checkout of my relevant directories, I found that all files that have accents appear to be missing, and a new file with the same name appears as non-versioned. Digging into it, the issues is that the file IN the file-system is apple-encoded, while the data in the repository uses another (perfectly valid and legitimate) Unicode encoding...\nThis, I think, is a gross \"mangling\" of my data. Apple DOES understand both formats of the filename encoding (accessing a share in Windows, or using a USB stick from Windows shows the proper file names, etc) but at file creation time, it's decided \"it knows better\" and just renamed the files...\nAgain, not something most users will notice - until they make a copy of a file, or rename it, and put it back to where the original one was and end up with two files that are apparently the same!!!)\n\nA: John Siracusa & Dan Benjamin discuss some disadvantages of HFS+ in Hypercritical #56.  \nThey addresses data corruption in HFS+ and consider some of ZFS's features.\n\nA: A transcript of the “Q&A” session in which Linus made the comment is available, but it seems he wasn't asked to elaborate. I'm not sure whether a more in-depth analysis of his opinion on HFS+ has been written down somewhere else.\nFor someone else's analysis of the matter, you can take a look at John Siracusa's Mac OS X reviews. In particular the one for Mac OS X Lion which has a section titled “What's wrong with HFS+.” I think the most salient bit is (emphasis mine):\n\nConcurrency, metadata written in the correct byte order, sub-second date precision, support for massive volume sizes, and sparse file support are all common features of Unix file systems. Mac OS X, of course, is built on a Unix foundation. When HFS+ was ported from classic Mac OS to Mac OS X, it needed to be extended to support some minimum set of features that are expected from Unix file systems.\nSome of those features were an easy fit, but others were very difficult to add to the file system without breaking backwards compatibility. One particularly scary example is the implementation of hard links on HFS+. To keep track of hard links, HFS+ creates a separate file for each hard link inside a hidden directory at the root level of the volume. Hidden directories are kind of creepy to begin with, but the real scare comes when you remember that Time Machine is implemented using hard links to avoid unnecessary data duplication.\n\nThe important point here is that Mac OS X is using a file system which wasn't even designed for a Unix system, it was designed for classic Mac OS and patched to implement the features of Mac OS X 10.0 while maintaining backwards compatibility. Apple has subsequently implemented the additional features that it now has in Mac OS X 10.7 (journaling, metadata, filesystem events ...) using the same patching approach rather than a “design from the ground up” approach. I'm not sure how to explain this non-technically, but you could say that all of these additional features are resting on a classic Mac OS foundation that was never designed to support them. This means the solution isn't as good as it could be. The example that Siracusa goes on to discuss is that the solution Apple had to use for hard links while working within the limitations of HFS+ is too sensitive to hardware failure, which is compounded by the fact that HFS+ was also never designed to concern itself with data integrity. Of course, maintaining compatibility with classic Mac OS was a desirable limitation in Mac OS X 10.0 but it really isn't anymore in Mac OS X 10.7.\n", "Q: Can a MacBook Pro be tracked when disconnected from the Internet? My MacBook was stolen. I just want to know if I can find it even if the thief shut it down permanently.\nOn my MacBook I have an automatic session opened and the Airport is turned on by default.\nI want to know if I can trace it even if the Airport-detected WiFi hotspots but the thief didn't connect it to the Internet.\nWhat will happen if the thief turns off the airport and only works offline?\n\nA: There is no way to trace your MacBook Pro if the thief does not connect it to the internet, because at the very least the MBP needs to 'dial in' to announce it's location.\nSince you did not enable \"Find my Mac\" and did not install any other recovery software, you might want to check in with some other services installed on your MBP.\nDropbox for example shows the last connected IP address for any given device you linked to your Dropbox account. If you use Dropbox, force a sync by making a change in your Dropbox folder. If the thief connects to the internet and Dropbox syncs the changes, you'll know the IP address he was connecting from. You can find this information on the Dropbox website, in your account settings.\n\nGmail is another popular service that allows you to see recently connected IP addresses. If you set up a Gmail account in Mail.app for example, you might want to check this information. You can find a link on the bottom right of your Inbox page.\n\nHave a look at all possible cloud-based services you installed on the MBP, possibly others allow viewing a list of recently connected IP addresses as well.\nHowever, if the thief does never connect to the internet, this will not help you either. There is also a possibility the thief reinstalls the OS from scratch to prevent the MBP from dialing in.\n", "Q: Will I still be able to buy and install Lion after Mountain Lion is released? I own an Early 2008, white MacBook (MB403LL/A) which still has Snow Leopard, 10.6.8, installed. \nMy understanding is Mountain Lion will not support my MacBook. If this turns out to be true then I would probably want to upgrade to Lion since it will be the last supported (for a bit longer) release which I could use.\nPreviously, before the App Store when OS X was sold on optical media, it was always possible to purchase an older version of OS X. The media was still \"out there\".\nWith Lion I am not sure what my options are. Does anyone know if I would still be able to buy and install Lion from the App Store after Apple releases Mountain Lion?\nI'm just trying to better understand what my options might be. I really have no desire to install Lion unless and until I feel I have no other choice.\n\nUpdate: July 26, 2012\nCopying the link to MacWorld article Apple pulls Lion from the Mac App Store into this question. (The link was in one of bmike's comments below.) The article seems to sum up my question/concerns about this matter rather well.\nI also found the excerpt from this article quoted below interesting. Apparently not even Apple knows how to respond to this?  \n\n\n*\n\n*... Apple spokesperson Monica Sarkar told Macworld that, while Lion is no longer available for sale from the Mac App Store, customers can\nstill purchase it from the legacy products list via Apple phone\nsales. But when we called 1-800-MY-APPLE, sales representatives there\nsaid Lion was not available.\n\nA: I called 1-800-MY-APPLE and bought Lion 10.7 for only $19. I told the automated machine that I wanted to buy OS X 10.7 Lion. I was transferred to a sales representative, and he looked it up and said it was $19.99 plus taxes. I was surprised because I was expecting a $29.99 price tag. So I made him double check to make sure it was indeed 10.7 Lion and not 10.8 Mountain Lion. He said that it was for sure and that I would be emailed a PDF with a redemption code to get it.\nI went through with the purchase last night (November 6, 2012) and got the email today. I was able to redeem the code in the App Store and download it from there!\n\nA: Apple was selling Lion as a physical deliverable from the web store until the middle of the day 25 July. \n\n\n*\n\n*http://store.apple.com/us/product/MD256Z/A\nSince this SKU has been removed as a simple product that can be ordered without speaking with a person, you will want to call Apple Sales at 1-800-MY-APPLE to buy Lion media for $29.99 or call 1-800-APL-CARE (or an international support number) to order replacement media should you already have a license.\nThe Lion Upgrade is also no longer for sale from the Mac App Store so you'll want to go through the physical media ordering or perhaps buy a copy of the Lion USB drive second hand.\n\nA: There's a chance you'll still be able to find the OS X Lion USB Thumb Drive somewhere, even if Apple pulls the Lion upgrade from the App Store. The media should still be \"out there,\" as you say, just on a USB stick instead of an optical disc. But it's more expensive: $69 for the thumb drive vs. $29 from the App Store. And, being less popular than the App Store download method, it may possibly be somewhat harder to find after Mountain Lion is released (pure speculation on my part).\n\nA: Yes, just not from Apple's online or retail stores. \nI am sure you can pop over to ebay or Amazon to find a copy.\n\nA: We don't know yet.  But maybe Mountain Lion install will only work when Lion is already installed.  If so, then certainly Lion will remain on sale.\n", "Q: How do I use Automator to add files download via Transmission to iTunes?

However after the installation, I run brew doctor per the installation instructions, and see a series of errors indicating that /usr/local directories aren't writable. For example:\nError: /usr/local/share isn't writable.\nThis can happen if you \"sudo make install\" software that isn't managed\nby Homebrew.\n\nIf a brew tries to write a file to this directory, the install will\nfail during the link step.\n\nYou should probably `chown` /usr/local/share\n\nI get these for a bunch of directories:\nYou should probably `chown` /usr/local/include\n\nYou should probably `chown` /usr/local/share\n\nYou should probably `chown` /usr/local/share/man\n\nI can't figure out why this error is coming up, as it appears that I am part of the Unix group that has write permissions to these directories:\nMini:~ felciano$ ls -ld /usr/local/share\ndrwxrwxr-x  4 root  admin  136 May 13 15:53 /usr/local/share\nMini:~ felciano$ whoami\nfelciano\nMini:~ felciano$ dscl . -read /Groups/admin GroupMembership\nGroupMembership: root felciano\nMini:~ felciano$\n\nWhat am I missing? \n\nA: EDIT: The problem is now fixed in Homebrew:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/commit/8aa4f9dd3bbd885350776171d3d9403d381e1a59\nIf you still experience the problem, update Homebrew like this:\nbrew update\n\nIf you want to know what the problem was, I have kept my original answer below.\n\nIgnore the permisson issue for now\nI am experiencing the exact same problem and in my opinion the problem is in brew doctor rather than in your and my installation.\nI think you should ignore the issue rather than changing the ownership of /usr/local. Alternatively, you could fix your local brew doctor script until a fix is released. See below.\nI don't consider it correct to make /usr/local owned by a specific user. I have more than one admin user on this machine. You should leave /usr/local owned by root:admin as owner and group.\nMy investigation\nLike for you I have a /usr/local that is perfectly writable by my user which is also a member of the admin group:\n$ ls -ld /usr/local/\ndrwxrwxr-x  14 root  admin  476 22 Jun 23:33 /usr/local/\n$ whoami\nmgd\n$ dscl . -read /Groups/admin GroupMembership\nGroupMembership: root mgd rgd\n\nLet's test that the dir is really writable:\n$ ls -l /usr/local/newfile\nls: /usr/local/newfile: No such file or directory\n$ touch /usr/local/newfile\n$ ls -l /usr/local/newfile\n-rw-r--r--  1 mgd  admin  0 23 Jun 14:52 /usr/local/newfile\n\nFurther investigation into the brew doctorcode led my to the conclusion that the use of the ruby function Pathname.writable? is causing the problem. Consider this interactive Ruby session:\n$ irb\n>> require 'pathname'\n=> true\n>> Pathname('/usr/local').writable?\n=> false\n\nFunction Pathname.writable? says /usr/local is not writable even though we know it is.\nUsing Pathname.writable_real? instead gives the correct result – it says that the dir is writable:\n>> Pathname('/usr/local').writable_real?\n=> true\n\nThis should be fixed in /usr/local/Library/Homebrew/cmd/doctor.rb. You can fix it in your own installation while waiting for a fix.\nThe difference between the two functions are (according to the Ruby docs here and here):\nwritable?(file_name) → true or false: Returns true if the named file is writable by the effective user id of this process.\nwritable_real?(file_name) → true or false: Returns true if the named file is writable by the real user id of this process.\n\nA: I believe you just need this:\nbrew update\nThen try brew doctor again.\nYou might still get errors about any dependencies you aren't using (Java in my case), which is okay. If you have the Command Line Tools for Xcode installed instead of the full installation of Xcode you will also get an error message saying you have an invalid path, but right in the message you will also read that there is no valid path if you're just using the Command Line Tools for Xcode, so that's okay as well.\nFor the benefit of others: Keep in mind that you need to be logged in as an admin when doing this for it to work.\n\nA: I followed a combination of iolsmit's and Phil M's suggestions: I chowned these directories to my username, then ran brew update again followed by brew doctor. This got rid of all the error messages and brew installations now seem to work nicely. Thank you both! \n\nA: Thumbs up for @mgd's investigation and clarification... it's spot on!\nIt appears that a similar issue was raised on github.com about a year ago, but was never (properly?) resolved, at least not by using writable_real? ... maybe it's time for a pull request?!? :-)\n", "Q: Synchronize USB hard drive between Mac and PC I have a large (750GB) FAT32 formatted USB hard drive and two computers - a MacBook and a PC - and I want to keep synched and duplicate versions of my work folders (images, word documents, videos etc) on each device: the hard drive, Mac and PC.\nTo achieve this I imagine a folder synchronization software running on both Mac and PC (ideally the same software) which would sync selected folders between the computer and hard drive.\nDoes anyone know of such a piece of software?\nMany thanks!\n\nA: Yeah, it's new and it's call BitTorrent Sync, just came out of Alpha. It uses a 32 character code you create to create folder based sharepoints...on any computer on your network, without futzing with Preferences. Bittorent does all the work, and you essentially can create your own cloud at will, with any internal or external hdd's.\n\nA: I suppose you could find folder sync software for both platforms and do this manually, but really those solutions are starting to wither in favor of cloud based sync solutions.\nDoes what you're looking for, just over the internet (with a persistent cache on your local machine in case you're not online). I've used dropbox to do this exact task for a couple years now, and couldn't imaging going back to a more manual/client based solution.\nThere are numerous services that offer this, with more storage than you need (5GB is typical). The most well known are DropBox, Google Drive, Box.net and SugarSync. I would highly recommend you look at these before investing in client software to do this.\nedit: I just happened to run into a New York Times article that discussed this very issue. See A User’s Guide to Finding Storage Space in the Cloud\n\nA: You might want to take a look at using FreeFileSync to sync between the PC and the hard drive and then using Carbon Copy Cloner to sync between the Mac and the hard drive.\nHowever, a better solution would be to create a \"cloud\" with your own external drive.  If you have a spare machine lying around that you could convert to a Linux server, you could create your own cloud server for free using ownCloud or Tonido, both of which offer sync clients for Mac and PC.  If you don't have a spare machine or want a simpler way to do this, you can buy a PogoPlug or TonidoPlug which essentially turn any USB drive into a NAS (Network Attached Storage).  PogoPlug offers an easier to use interface, but TonidoPlug is more extensible.  Both of these offer sync applications as well.   \n", "Q: Unremovable directory I have a problem with a seemingly unremovable directory/bundle. I moved Spotify.app from /Applications to the Trash and later tried to empty the Trash.\nThe empty trash progress bar shows up but then nothing happens anymore. No error message, no progress.\nThen i tried to remove the directory with the following commands\nrm -rfv ~/.Trash/*\nsudo rm -rfv /home/<user_name>/.Trash/*\n\nBoth never return, can not be aborted with ^c and provide no output at all. I considered some filesystem corruption, rebooted in recovery mode and ran the disc repair. It found an error and fixed it, but the problem did not go away and i still have the same behavior.\nAnother potentially related problem is wrong meta information in the Finder. Since some weeks ago i repeatedly find files where the Finder shows no filesize, type, creation date, modification date.\nAny ideas how to remove the directory or what might be the problem?\n\nA: I was able to remove the directory in single user mode.\nBefore that i tried to remove the contents of the directory one by one and found that Spotify contained two Growl libraries one of which could not be removed. The library did not even show up with ls -l in single user mode.\n\nA: I use sudo rm -Rf (big 'R') when things are stubborn. It's a holdover from my Slackware days but I actually have no idea whether there's a difference on OS X.\nHowever, sometimes restarting Finder using killall Finder can release locks on the Trash, which coincidentally can have the same effect.\n\nA: Maybe some of the files are protected. In that case you won't be able to delete them the normal way. Apple provides a very handy manual for this. Just look for the section \"Advanced tip about deleting locked files\". I've used this procedure many times!\n", "Q: How to set PATH for Finder-launched applications Apps launched via Finder seem to not respect the PATH as set in .bash_profile.  So when I try to run code from an IDE (Intellij) I no longer have access to programs in /usr/local/bin, which is normally added to my path in the Terminal.\nApparently .MacOSX/environment.plist used to be the way to do this, but it no longer works in Lion.\nHow can I set the PATH for Finder-launched applications?\n\nA: If you are on 10.7 and not 10.8, the solution below works well:\nI had the same problem with eclipse, but now I've added e.g. the following to my .bash_profile and then it worked.\nexport PATH=some_path:another_path\nlaunchctl setenv PATH $PATH\n\nIn case you want to leave the original path intact use\np=$(launchctl getenv PATH)\nlaunchctl setenv PATH /my/new/path:$p\n\ninstead (or just launchctl setenv PATH /my/new/path:$(launchctl getenv PATH)).\nNote: Changing the launchctl PATH will not take effect until the Dock is \"restarted\".  A new Dock process will automatically start after the current one is killed with the command:\nkillall Dock\n\n\nA: On OS X 10.10 Yosemite, I used this command:\nsudo launchctl config user path <my path setting>\n\nBe aware that his sets the launchtl PATH for all users.  This worked well for my use case. Note that you'll be asked to reboot your machine for the effects to take hold.\nYou must restart all applications for this to have effect. (It doesn't apply to applications that are reopened at login after rebooting.) (Thanks @Brecht Machiels.)\n\nA: To answer you question to your 'new' problem, I've decided to write another answer - because it is easier to explain with samples.\nOne way to load the environment variables on startup of your tool (IDE) of choice is like it can be done with eclipse - I think there must be a similar structure in your tool (IDE) too.\nHow it can be done in eclipse - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/829749/launch-mac-eclipse-with-environment-variables-set\n(slightly re-written about the environment variables)\nCreate an empty text file called \"eclipse.sh\" in the Eclipse application bundle directory /Applications/Eclipse.app/Contents/MacOS\nOpen the eclipse.sh in a text editor and enter the following contents:\n#!/bin/sh\n\n. ~/.bash_profile\n\nlogger \"$(dirname \\\"$0\\\")/eclipse\"\n\nexec \"$(dirname \\\"$0\\\")/eclipse\" \"$@\"\n\nIn the Terminal set the executable flag of the shell script eclipse.sh, i.e.:\nchmod +x /Applications/Eclipse.app/Contents/MacOS/eclipse.sh\n\nOpen the Eclipse.app Info.plist and change the value for the key CFBundleExecutable from eclipse to eclipse.sh.\nMacOS X does not automatically detect that the Eclipse.app's Info.plist has changed. Therefore you need to force update the LaunchService database in the Terminal by using the lsregister command:\n/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister -v -f /Applications/Eclipse.app\n\nThe next time you launch Eclipse.app from the Dock or from the Finder the environment variables should be set.\n\nA: On Mountain Lion (10.8.4), $PATH is treated specially somehow. launchctl setenv PATH /your/path:/here does not have any effect on the $PATH in Terminal.app or Emacs.app instances subsequently launched from the Dock or from the Finder (whereas launchctl setenv SPONG foo works fine).  Also $HOME/.launchd.conf doesn't work. /etc/launchd.conf is the only way I have found to get PATH set correctly everywhere.  Unfortunately, one cannot use envars such as $HOME there, so all the users on my laptop have /Users/nb/bin on their $PATH. That's only me, so I don't care.\n\nA: On Mountain Lion all the /etc/paths and /etc/launchd.conf editing doesn't take any effect!\nApple's Developer Forums say:\n\n\"Change the Info.plist of the .app itself to contain an \"LSEnvironment\"\n  dictionary with the environment variables you want.\n~/.MacOSX/environment.plist is no longer supported.\"\n\nSo I directly edited the app's Info.plist (right click on \"AppName.app\" (in this case SourceTree) and then \"Show package contents\") \n\nand added a new key/dict pair called:\n<key>LSEnvironment</key>\n<dict>\n     <key>PATH</key>\n     <string>/Users/flori/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p362/bin:/Users/flori/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p362@global/bin:/Users/flori/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.3-p326/bin:/Users/flori/.rvm/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:</string>\n</dict>\n\n(see: LaunchServicesKeys Documentation at Apple)\n\nnow the App (in my case SourceTree) uses the given path and works with git 1.9.3 :-)\nPS: Of course you have to adjust the Path entry to your specific path needs.\n\nA: Inspired by the answer of @brki I wrote this script. \nIt takes the contents of /etc/paths and uses it to reconstruct the original path (and /usr/local/bin), then adds ~/bin and /some/other to it.\nif [ -f /etc/paths ]; then\n  ETC_PATHS=$(while read line; do\n    echo -n \"${line}:\"\n  done < /etc/paths)\n  PATH_OVERRIDE=${ETC_PATHS}${HOME}/bin:/some/other\n  echo \"overriding original path /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin with ${PATH_OVERRIDE} so that gpg and node will be on path for spotlight launched programs\"\n  sudo launchctl config user path $PATH_OVERRIDE\nfi\n\nI have verified that this works on macOS Catalina 10.15.1 \n\nA: On Mac OS X 10.8.4, Mountain Lion, the path environment incorporates the paths listed in this file:\n/etc/paths\n\nYou can edit this file using a command line tool, such as vim using the following command:\nsudo vim /etc/paths\n\n\nA: Try setting path in your ~/.profile or ~/.bash_profile or ~/.zprofile (for zsh).  This worked for me with VimR -- it wasn't reading the PATH when launched from the dock, but it worked when launched from the terminal.  I was running on OSX 10.11 by the way.\nI don't have a good enough handle on this to give you a great explanation of why it works, there are plenty of explanations online about the different config files and what they do:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/415403/whats-the-difference-between-bashrc-bash-profile-and-environment\nAlso, see a similar discussion here:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/3344704/path-variable-not-properly-set-in-gvim-macvim-when-it-is-opened-from-the-finder/24542893#24542893\n", "Q: Selecting multiple icons in Finder using the keyboard? Is there a way to select icons (using the keyboard) that aren't directly touching? In Windows, I'd press Ctrl+Down, but it doesn't work in the Finder view. I've tried all the usual keyboard shortcuts, but it doesn't seem to work. I can multi-select other icons just fine, but I can't multi-select these two.\nThe picture explains it better than I could. The icons in this folder are aligned to the grid.\n\n\nA: You could use cmd ⌘ + 2 to change to the list view and then just use Shift + Down.\n\nA: I thought Shift + Down should work. I tried and the results were, let us say, special:\nWhen your view is sorted by Name, Shift + Down does not go the last item.\nIf your view is not sorted, (Sort By: None), then Shift + Down selecs the last item as well.\nSee this screencast. (This is my first screencast, so not a very good one)\n\nA: The answer, it turns out, is fairly unintuitive.\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the last item (the PSD).\n\n*Press Shift + Up.\n\n*Hold Shift and press Right repeatedly until you get the selection you want.\n\n\nA: Selecting multiple icons with the keyboard in Finder's Icons View is very limited. Here's a few options:\ncmd+click: This definitely works in Icons View, but you have to use the mouse to click.\nshift+arrows: This only works properly in a single row or a single column. If you start trying to use the arrow keys to select more than a single row or column, you'll get inconsistent and strange results.\nThe only real solution, unfortunately, is to switch to List View to do the multiple selection.\nSome people mentioned that Icons View keyboard selection works when not sorted, but my testing on Sierra 10.12.6 found that it didn't matter whether Icons View was sorted or not, keyboard selection didn't work beyond a single row/column.\n", "Q: One Apple ID Required for iPhone and iPad My husband and I share a computer. We both have our own iPhone, mine a 4S and his a 3S. My husband also has a new iPad.\nThe problem: when I set up his new iPad it would not accept the Apple ID used on his iPhone, therefore I had to create another Apple ID for the iPad. Can one not have a single Apple ID and password for both devices? \n\nA: You can use the same Apple ID on up to five devices.\nI would reset the iPad and begin from scratch. I recently came across a similar problem with a new iPad and resetting it worked perfectly.\n", "Q: How can I prevent the iPad 2 from playing music in my rucksack? I have an iPad 2. \nSometimes, after I stow it away into my bag, it will start playing music (using the music app) at the most inappropriate times: during class, in meetings... This behaviour seems to be connected to the screen saver feature, but I can't seem to find a way to turn it off!\nIs there a way to turn this off, or to at least make it respect the volume setting? The music is audible even with the iPad muted otherwise.\nOr am I just too dumb to find the right setting? I'm not excluding that possibility.\n\nEdit: I have a passcode set.\n\n\nA: Arrrgh. \nI found the reason, my own stupidity. :) I use a Bluetooth keyboard whose keys are extremely sensitive to pressure when it's stowed in the backpack. It usually goes to sleep when not used, but wakes up when you press a key. The \"play\" key on that keyboard was what made the iPad blare away.\n\nA: A friend of mine recently had the same complaint.  I couldn't find a solution online, but came up with this workaround:\nGo to your Settings, General, Restrictions.  Enable restrictions, set a passcode and disable iTunes.\nIt's a bit of a nuisance if you regularly use your iPad to listen to music, but most people with iPads have an iPhone or iPod for that.\nGood luck!\n\nA: Got a few suggestions tough I'm not an iPad owner but it works for an iPhone.\n1)  how about turing the iPad completely off? ( by holding the power button, en slide to power off )\n2) play some music and turn the volume down with the volume buttons this volume setting will be respected.\n3) plug in head phones sound will be played trough the headphones so it won't be hearable.\nBut I find it really odd that it starts playing music in the first place, maybe your leather case does interact with the screen. After all leather is an animal skin.\n", "Q: OS X productivity application to block access to different websites? I am looking for an OS X application that would block you from accessing certain websites, like social and entertainment one and even hide applications.\nThe entire purpose is to create a working environment that allows you to focus on your job. \nI have to mention that, the web-browser cannot be banned because it is required to normal use.\nAlso, the solution I am looking for should provide a way to harden the switching from no-distration mode to unlocked.\nThis question is about a software solution, so please refrain from recommending books to read regarding productivity.\nI realise that using Parental Control and having a managed account would solve some of these but there are some essential problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*Applications are not hidden, the system just asks for admin password, yuck.\n\n*You have to create the list of denied websites yourself, that makes it impossible to manager. Is there a predefined list that we can import?\n\n*How to share the documents I'm working on between the two accounts: normal one and restricted one.\n\n\nA: I use Antisocial for this:\n\nAnti-Social is a productivity application for Macs that turns off the social parts of the internet. When Anti-Social is running, you’re locked away from distracting social media sites, including Facebook, Twitter and other sites you specify. With Anti-Social, you’ll be amazed how much you get done when you turn off your friends.\n\nBut of course this works only for web sites, not for local applications. \n", "Q: iTunes notifications I'd like to have a notification displayed in the dock every time a new song is played. Unfortunately, this doesn't exist as an option in the program preferences, but there are ways to do it, see this article for example.\nHowever, for some reason this doesn't work for me. Can you guess why? I'm using a MacBook Pro with iTunes 10.6.1 running on Mac OS X 10.6.8.\n\nA: This tweak is for OSX 10.7 only.\nFor something equivalent in OSX 10.6, you might want to give a try with 3rd party notifiers. The ones that come in mind right now are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Growl (my personal favorite)\n\n*Sizzling Keys\nThere surely are more notification apps out there, Google is your friend!\n", "Q: Transfer of iPhone Ownership I have an AT&T family plan.  My niece has an HTC smartphone and hates it.  I have a 3G iPhone.  I want to give her my iPhone and get a newer one with my upgrade.  I don't know how to transfer ownership of my 3G iPhone to my niece.  Do iPhones have SIM cards and if they do, how do you get to it?  Thanks so much for any help.\n\nA: To remove the sim card, insert the sim remover tool (that came in the box, shown below) or any other thing object such as a straightened paper clip, hair clip, etc. into the small hole on the top of the device to extract the sim card tray.\n\n\nA: iPhones do have SIM cards.\nIf you got the phone through AT&T, you will need to contact them about transferring ownership. I believe they recently began allowing iPhones to be unlocked, so check that out before doing anything else.\n", "Q: Can I create a Desktop Shortcut/Alias to a Folder from the Terminal? I'd like to create a desktop shortcut to a specific folder, buried deep within ~/Library/. Library is Hidden by default in Lion, and I'd like to keep it that way, for a variety of reasons. Is there a one-step, command line action I can use, to create a desktop shortcut to a given path? I'd like to avoid solutions that involve unhiding the Library, creating the Alias using Finder, and rehiding it. I know how to do that, but for my purposes, a single line that can be pasted into Terminal and be done with it would be preferable.\n\nA: It's possible to do it in one line of Terminal. Let's say you want to alias to the file \"/Users/me/Library/Preferences/org.herf.Flux.plist\".\nosascript -e 'tell application \"Finder\"' -e 'make new alias to file (posix file \"/Users/me/Library/Preferences/org.herf.Flux.plist\") at desktop' -e 'end tell'\n\nYou should replace to file with to folder if you have a folder.\nHere's a shell script that allows you pass in a file or folder path to create the alias:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nif [[ -f \"$1\" ]]; then\n  type=\"file\"\nelse\n  if [[ -d \"$1\" ]]; then \n    type=\"folder\"\n  else\n    echo \"Invalid path or unsupported type\"\n    exit 1\n  fi\nfi\n\nosascript <<END_SCRIPT\ntell application \"Finder\"\n   make new alias to $type (posix file \"$1\") at desktop\nend tell\nEND_SCRIPT\n\nIf you name this script make-alias.sh, chmod u+x make-alias.sh and put it in /usr/local/bin, you can run e.g. make-alias.sh ~/Library/Preferences.\n\nA: Try this on Terminal:\ncd ~/Desktop\nln -s ~/Library/path/to/folder\n\n\nA: In case you need to target the link at a specific folder (or give it a specific name), you can use set name of result to \"…\" as in \n#!/bin/bash\n\nif [[ $# -ne 2 ]]; then\n    echo \"mkalias: specify 'from' and 'to' paths\" >&2\n    exit 1\nfi\n\nfrom=\"$(realpath $1)\"\ntodir=\"$(dirname $(realpath $2))\"\ntoname=\"$(basename $(realpath $2))\"\nif [[ -f \"$from\" ]]; then\n    type=\"file\"\nelif [[ -d \"$from\" ]]; then\n    type=\"folder\"\nelse\n    echo \"mkalias: invalid path or unsupported type: '$from'\" >&2\n    exit 1\nfi\n\nosascript <<EOF\ntell application \"Finder\"\n   make new alias to $type (posix file \"$from\") at (posix file \"$todir\")\n   set name of result to \"$toname\"\nend tell\nEOF\n\n\nA: #!/bin/bash\n\nget_abs() {\n  # $1 : relative filename\n  echo \"$(cd \"$(dirname \"$1\")\" && pwd)/$(basename \"$1\")\"\n}\n\n\nif [[ $# -ne 2 ]]; then\n    echo \"mkalias: specify 'from' and 'to' paths\" >&2\n    exit 1\nfi\n\nfrom=$(eval get_abs $1)  \ntodir=$(dirname $(eval get_abs $2))\ntoname=$(basename $(eval get_abs $2))\nif [[ -f \"$from\" ]]; then\n    type=\"file\"\nelif [[ -d \"$from\" ]]; then\n    type=\"folder\"\nelse\n    echo \"mkalias: invalid path or unsupported type: '$from'\" >&2\n    exit 1\nfi\n\nosascript <<EOF\ntell application \"Finder\"\n   make new alias to $type (posix file \"$from\") at (posix file \"$todir\")\n   set name of result to \"$toname\"\nend tell\nEOF\n\n\nA: For people who would like a python solution, here is a function wrapping applescript, then calling subprocess.call:\ndef applescript_finder_alias(theFrom, theTo):\n    \"\"\"\n    (theFrom, theTo)\n    create a short/alias\n    theFrom, theTo: relative or abs path, both folder or both file\n    \"\"\"\n    # https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/51709\n    applescript = '''\n    tell application \"Finder\"\n       make new alias to %(theType)s (posix file \"%(theFrom)s\") at (posix file \"%(todir)s\")\n       set name of result to \"%(toname)s\"\n    end tell\n    '''\n    def myesp(cmdString):\n        import os, inspect, tempfile, subprocess\n        caller = inspect.currentframe().f_back\n        cmd =  cmdString % caller.f_locals\n\n        fd, path = tempfile.mkstemp(suffix='.applescript')\n        try:\n            with os.fdopen(fd, 'w') as tmp:\n                tmp.write(cmd.replace('\"','\\\"').replace(\"'\",\"\\'\")+'\\n\\n')\n            subprocess.call('osascript ' + path, shell=True, executable=\"/bin/bash\")\n        finally:\n            os.remove(path)\n        return None\n    import os\n    theFrom = os.path.abspath(theFrom)\n    theTo = os.path.abspath(theTo)\n    if os.path.isfile(theFrom): \n        theType = 'file'\n    else:\n        theType = 'folder'\n    todir = os.path.dirname(theTo)\n    toname = os.path.basename(theTo)\n    myesp(applescript)\n\n", "Q: What does \"com.apple.*\" mean in plist titles I have a programmable Logitech mouse, which allows me to assign different configurations to different applications, but ONLY .app files, but I wish to assign a profile to Java, which is a binary not enclosed in a .app file.\nWhen I nosed around into its preference file, it only refers to some sort of identifier associated for that app. For example, instead of saying /Applications/Safari.app, it would only reference it as com.apple.safari.\nWhat does com.apple.* mean? Is it some sort of application identifier? And, if so, how can I find the one for Java?\n\nA: That particular naming structure is known as \"reverse DNS\" naming. (Like Apple's website is at apple.com, so their plist entries are com.apple.) This is done so that items are sorted by manufacturer before product if you sort by name. \nThis nomenclature is used in Java packages (and other places) as well as OS X application identifiers.\nIf you want to specify Java as a whole, look for com.sun.* or com.oracle.*, as those are the two companies that have owned Java.\n\nA: The com.apple.xxxx.plist simply implies ownership of the plist file to Apple. plist files contain settings for launchd processes.\n", "Q: My iPod touch won't let me save the new iTunes security questions Whenever I try to buy new apps, my iPod asks me to type in my user name and password and answer some security questions.\nI tap OK to continue, but nothing happens. I have tried using a different account and even resetting my iPod but nothing seems to be working.\nWhat can I do to fix this?\nEven if I went on the compiter and enter my security questions it wouldn't let me save them. What will I do?\n\nA: I would suggest trying to download an app with iTunes on your computer. You may have better luck getting the questions there, and it shouldn't bug you about it on your iPod after you've done it.\n\nA: Are you under 13 ? Apple now block children from using iTunes - change your birthday to get round it (worked for my daughter).\n", "Q: Terminal hangs on startup I am on OSX Lion. After I Control C the building of Atlas under MacPorts Clang I can no longer get it to run. It start taking around 2GB on startup and even does this after a reboot. After killing the terminal the first time an error report was sent to Apple. The second time killing it did not trigger such a request.\nWhat do I need to do to get the terminal to run again in a normal fashion?\n\nA: You can try deleting Terminal's saved application state. It's in ~/Library/Saved Application State/com.apple.Terminal.savedState. You can also try deleting Terminal's preferences. Those are in ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Terminal.plist.\nIf you don't want to potentially lose the saved state or preferences, you can move them to the desktop before starting Terminal.\nIn Lion, you can get to ~/Library by holding the Option key while selecting the Go menu in Finder.\n", "Q: Errors on kernel.log... how do I fix them?

The machine will then only load certain kernel extensions.\nIf this results in less errors in the log, then there might be a problem with the kernel extensions cache (which I believe is bypassed in Safe Mode: see TS1884, although this is only marked as relevant to 10.5).\nIf there does seem to be a problem with the kext cache, then I believe you can safely delete /System/Library/Caches/com.apple.kext.caches/ and it will be rebuilt, as this superuser.com question and answer explain.  But I would do a little more research in that scenario to check first, since that question is about 10.6.\n", "Q: Do MacBooks have a true \"Hibernate\" option? I've recently switched from Windows to a MacBook pro. In Windows, there are the following shutdown options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Standby - the machine goes into a \"light sleep\" from which it can awaken very quickly (like, in a few seconds), but plenty of energy is consumed.\n\n*Hibernate - the OS dumps the current system state (including the contents of the RAM) to a file, then turns the machine off. Wakeup takes longer than from standby, but there is no latent energy consumption. \n\n*Shut down - the OS shuts down, and the machine is turned off. \nIn OS X, what I can see is\n\n\n*\n\n*Sleep - seems equivalent to standby, or an even lighter form of sleep as Mail seems to even continue to poll for new email? \n\n*Shutdown and restore all apps on next start - turns off machine, seems to start the OS from scratch and restart alls apps - from what I can tell, it's not hibernation\n\n*Shutdown and don't restore apps - shut down\nis this correct, and does OS X not have a true \"hibernate\" mode that can write its state to disk? Because that's what I'm looking for really. There's talk of a \"Safe Sleep\" mode on the Internets, but I can't see it in my OS X menu. Is it hidden in 10.7?\n\nA: Expanding on Max Ried's answer above, I've been using this free app to enable hibernation on my macs for at least the last 5 years: Hibernate by Patrick Stein.  I set it to \"hibernate only\" mode, and every time I put my mac to \"Sleep,\" it instead skips straight to SafeSleep.\nSo far I haven't had any issues that I can prove were caused directly by this app; that is to say my computer rarely crashes or hangs, and I repeatedly \"Hibernate\" it when I need to take my laptop someplace with me (rather than shutting it down) often for weeks at a time without issue.\nI should mention that my newest mac is a 4-5 year old MacBook Pro, so I have not tested this app on newer machines.\n\nA: When newer laptops are put to sleep, they should save the contents of the RAM to /var/vm/sleepimage but keep the RAM powered as well. Desktop Macs should just use normal sleep mode by default.\nman pmset:\nhibernatemode = 0 (binary 0000) by default on supported desktops. The\nsystem will not back memory up to persistent storage. The system must\nwake from the contents of memory; the system will lose context on power\nloss. This is, historically, plain old sleep.\n\nhibernatemode = 3 (binary 0011) by default on supported portables. The\nsystem will store a copy of memory to persistent storage (the disk), and\nwill power memory during sleep. The system will wake from memory, unless\na power loss forces it to restore from disk image.\n\nhibernatemode = 25 (binary 0001 1001) is only settable via pmset. The\nsystem will store a copy of memory to persistent storage (the disk), and\nwill remove power to memory. The system will restore from disk image. If\nyou want \"hibernation\" - slower sleeps, slower wakes, and better battery\nlife, you should use this setting.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*0 (traditional sleep mode): fast wake up and sleep, saves disk space\n\n*3 (default safe sleep mode): fast wake up and sleep, state is kept when losing power\n\n*25 (hibernation): saves energy, state is kept when losing power\n\n\nYou can see which mode your Mac uses with pmset -g | grep hibernatemode and change it with sudo pmset -a hibernatemode $mode.\nSome newer Macs support a standby mode on 10.8 and later. Even if hibernatemode was set to 3, they power off memory after a bit over an hour of sleep.\n\nA: Yes, it has a hibernate option. Apple calls it Safe Sleep. When you put the Mac to sleep, OS X dumps the RAM onto the disk and goes to normal sleep (like Windows's Standby). When the battery is too weak to hold the RAM in standby, the computer is turned off. Then it's in the mode you call hibernation which is technically called \"ACPI mode S4\" or \"Suspend-To-Disk\".\nYou can force \"Suspend-To-Disk\" by disabling the standard sleep via SmartSleep or via pmset on the command line. Its man page has a lot of information on Safe Sleep.\n\nA: Also, the original poster notes that sleeping OS X machines continue to periodically check mail, etc. This is a feature on new-ish machines (it debuted in the 2011 MacBook Air) called PowerNap. In effect, the computer wakes periodically and briefly from sleep in order to handle recurring tasks.\nA summary from Apple's http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5394:\n\nWhile sleeping, Power Nap allows your Mac to do things like periodically check for new mail, calendar, and other iCloud updates. When plugged into AC power, Power Nap can also perform things like Time Machine backups to an AirPort Time Capsule and download OS X software updates while your Mac sleeps.\nWhen your compatible Mac goes to sleep, Power Nap still works to do the following:\n\n*\n\n*Mail - Receive new messages.\n\n*Contacts - Your Contacts update with any changes you may have made on another device.\n\n*Calendar - Receive new invitations and calendar updates.\n\n*Reminders - Reminders updates with any changes you may have made on another device.\n\n*Notes - Notes updates with any changes you may have made on another device.\n\n*Documents in your iCloud account -  iCloud pushes any edits you made to a document to your Mac notebook.\n\n*Photo Stream - Your Photo Stream updates with new photos from your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch.\n\n*Find My Mac - Locate a lost Mac notebook even when it’s sleeping.\n\n*VPN on demand - Corporate email updates securely.\n\n*Mobile Device Management - Remotely lock and wipe the computer.\n\nPower Nap does more when your Mac is plugged in to an AC outlet:\n\n*\n\n*Downloads software updates\n\n*Backs up with Time Machine\n\n*Performs Spotlight indexing\n\n*Continues background downloads of Mac App Store items, including software updates\n\n*Updates Help Center content\n\n*Wake on Wireless support for Apple and third party wireless base stations\n\n\n", "Q: Bootcamp not working after partitioning Macintosh HD I installed Windows 7 using bootcamp on my Early 2011 MBP. I gave 130GB to Win7 and rest to Mac HD. Once all was done, I created a new partition within Mac HD. The partition was created successfully but when I restarted computer and pressed \"option\" key, I was not able to see the Windows(boot camp), only Mac HD and Recovery HD.\nHow to fix that, is it not possible to have further partition after boot camp? Coz if I created partitions earlier to boot camp, boot camp assistant gives error of making one single partition.\nneed urgent help on this.\n\nA: I also faced similar issue and was able to solve with post on apple discussions. \nHowever follow these instruction carefully and make sure to have all backups in place.\n\nBased on comment below, adding answer in post\n\n\nsudo gdisk /dev/disk0\n\nIf you get any error messages at this point, report the error messages, don't proceed further.\n\nYou're now in gdisk interactive mode. Menus/commands are single characters followed by return/enter. So type ? and  and you'll get the main menu listing commands. Type p  and it will print (display) the current GPT. Since you have 5 GPT entries, you can't use a 1 for 1 GPT to MBR scheme like Apple does. The following suggestion is safe, but all hybrid MBRs are non-standard inventions, and therefore I can't tell you how Boot Camp Assistant or Disk Utility will react to this hybrid MBR should you decide to make changes later. What I can tell you is Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X themselves have no problem with this MBR scheme.\n\nr         go to the recovery & transformation menu\nh         create a new hybrid MBR\n5         add partion 5 to the MBR\n          accept the default MBR hex code of 07\ny         set the bootable flag\nn         do not protect more partitions\no        print (display) the MBR\n\nYou should have two entries. One type EE, one 07, with the 07 entry marked with * under Boot. If you don't, report back. If you do, write out the update partition information, and hope  a power failure doesn't occur for the next few seconds...\n\nw      write partition table to disk\n\nreboot. hold down option - you should be able to boot into either Mac HD, Recovery HD, or Windows.\n\nI just tested this same five partition GPT and 2 partition MBR on a working system and the instructions above worked.\n\nNote, so long as CSM-BIOS and thus MBR are required for Boot Camp instead of EFI booting Windows, we're stuck with flaky MBR problems, as well as the 2TB disk limitation for Windows boot disks.\n\nAlso, I filed bug ID 11980880 at bugreport.apple.com and referenced this thread.\n", "Q: copy song info from mp3 file to aac file from terminal I am trying to create a script that performs various conversions between formats of audio files. In one particular step, I use afconvert in Terminal to convert an mp3 to aac(mpeg4/m4a), but in this process all of the info attached to the audio file (name, artist etc) is lost. I tried to id3cp to copy over the info but this doesn't work (I think because aac files don't use ID3 tags...).\nCould someone suggest a way of copying all of the associated info on the mp3 files to the aac (m4a) file? Is there a way it can be retained during the conversion (preferable) or alternately a Terminal command to copy the info over?\n\nA: I prefer the mutagen Python library for tag editing, since it has good support for a wide variety of formats with a consistent interface. Here’s a script for copying the metadata of a file:\nimport mutagen\nimport mutagen.easyid3\nold = mutagen.easyid3.EasyID3('example.mp3') \nnew = mutagen.File('example.m4a') \nnew.update(old)\nnew.save()\n\nYou can open any file with mutagen.File, but that gives you raw access to the coded ID3 tags like 'TPE1', instead of human-readable tags like 'artist', so EasyID3 is used instead.\n", "Q: bash file recovery? I think I messed up my bash file /bin/bash when trying to create my first script, it displays a message saying \"process completed\" and locks my terminal, if I switch to another shell e.g sh, then it's fine, is there a way to restore the contents of bash file or anything like that, i don't have a backup as I never managed to use time machine.\nThanks for the help\n\nA: The problem likely is with one of the three following files all located at the root of your home directory: .bashrc, .profile, or .bash_profile. Try this:\n1) While in an sh session, navigate to your home directory if you are not already there (type in cd ~).\n2) Run the command ls -al and determine which of those files (.bashrc, .profile, or .bash_profile) are present in your home folder.\n3) It is likely the file which is causing the problem is the last one you were editing or is linked to by one of the three previously named files. Either move or change the file name of one of those files in of your home directory. If you are not sure which file you were working with, I would start with .bashrc.\nExample command to move .bashrc: mv .bashrc bashrc.bak \n4) Once you have moved or changed the file name of one of the previously listed files, try opening a new bash session. If the session launches successfully, then you know which file needs to be edited further. If the bash session does not launch, restore the file back to its original location. If no one file appears to be the cause, try moving or changing the file names of all named files.\n5) Make a backup of the file which is causing problems.\nTo resolve the \"process completed\" message, you will need to troubleshoot the script looking for return or exit statements which may be written incorrectly. If those are not present, you may have to go the route of commenting lines of the script out to determine where the problem is. To comment a line out, add a # character to the beginning of the line.\nDuring this last step, you will need to move a copy of the offending file back to its original location. To make things easier, I would probably open the file using TextWrangler or from nano or vim in another sh session to make changes.\n(Note: TextEdit and XCode will also work. However, to open the file, you will need to issue a command such as \"open -a TextEdit.app ~/.bashrc\" to open the file because the Open File Window does not allow for opening files whose names start with a period.)\n", "Q: Is it possible to use both the GPUs in a MacBook Pro at the same time? The Macbook Pros come with two graphical processing units, one is made by ATI and the other one by Intel.\nIs it possible to use them both at the same time, to render one image/3D model/whatever on one GPU and at the same time another one on the other GPU?\n\nA: It depends what you mean by:\n\nuse them both at the same time\n\nSo, Apple's usage of two GPUs is based on using one or the other, not both. Meaning as a user, you cannot \"use them both at the same time.\"\nNow, if you're talking about using them both as a programmer, well then anything is possible, and you could probably target both GPUs using OpenCl.\nMost applications written for OSX though will target GPUs using OpenCL, which is Apple's abstraction of the GPU. This means apps will call on the GPU when needed, and because Apple's implementation is one GPU at a time (not both), then most apps will only use one, not both.\nNOTE:\nThis is in regards to using multiple GPU chipsets, not multiple core within a chipset. Obviously OSX and OpenCL can use multiple cores.\n", "Q: How do I find where an environmental variable got set? I installed a program to try it out, and decided I didn't like it so I moved the app to the trash.\nToday, in my shell, I noticed that there are a couple of PROGRAMNAME_BLAHBLAH environmental variables set.  I'd like to remove those, too.\nI don't even have a .bashrc or .bash_login, so I grepped every file I could think of (~/.* ~/Library/* /Library/* /etc/*).  The only place these variables turned up was a file ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist, so I removed it from there (Xcode can edit binary plists), but new shells still have these variables set.\nWhat other files does Mac OS X 10.7's terminal/bash run on startup?  How might these variables get set?\nOr is it something funny like \"need to reboot after editing environment.plist\"?\n\nA: ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist is read at session start. If you want your change to it to be tested immediatly you have to restart your session.\nA restart of the system is useless.\nYou can edit this environment initialisation file with:\nplutil -convert xml1 environment.plist\nvi environment.plist\n\nI advise you to simply recover it to its version prior to your software\ninstallation.\nOther hint, check all the files which were modified on the date\nof installation of your unwanted software.\nIf you installed your software 15 days ago, you can perform this with:\nfind / -mtime -16 -mtime +14 -ls\n\n\nA: This answer—which is not macOS-specific but probably much more likely to be relevant—solved the problem for me.\nIf you use zsh, this will give you a ton of output to search through:\nzsh -xl\n\nIf bash is your thing\nPS4='+$BASH_SOURCE> ' BASH_XTRACEFD=7 bash -xl 7>&2\n\nSee the original answer for more details.\n", "Q: How to change color profiles on ssh iterm2 on SSH? mac os x lion;\nUsing Iterm2;\nI wish to change my iterm2 color profiles if I do ssh on terminal.\nCan this be done ? \n\nA: Very late answer, but I've found a way here that I wanted to share. This assumes you're running Zsh and oh-my-zsh but with some shell scripting experience you should be able to adjust this to other shells.\nI've copied these instructions here for posterity:\n\nCreate two iTerm profiles:\n*   Your personal preference theme (can be named anything)\n*   SSH color theme (must be named SSH)\n\nGo into your ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom directory and create a new file entitled iTerm2-ssh.zsh. Copy and paste the following or copy from the repo:\nfunction tabc() {\n    NAME=$1; if [ -z \"$NAME\" ]; then NAME=\"Default\"; fi \n    # if you have trouble with this, change\n    # \"Default\" to the name of your default theme\n    echo -e \"\\033]50;SetProfile=$NAME\\a\"\n}\n\nfunction tab-reset() {\n    NAME=\"YOUR_CUSTOM_PROFILE_NAME_HERE\"\n    echo -e \"\\033]50;SetProfile=$NAME\\a\"\n}\n\nfunction colorssh() {\n    if [[ -n \"$ITERM_SESSION_ID\" ]]; then\n        trap \"tab-reset\" INT EXIT\n        if [[ \"$*\" =~ \"web*|production|ec2-.*compute-1\" ]]; then\n            tabc SSH\n        fi\n    fi\n    ssh $*\n}\ncompdef _ssh tabc=ssh\n\nalias ssh=\"colorssh\"\n\nThe breakdown of this code:\ntabc() grabs the ssh name after the command $ ssh is entered. This\nchanges the SetProfile name to ssh.\ntab-reset() is responsible for when you exit the ssh session to return back to\na profile name of your choosing. Remember to create a custom profile name and replace the _YOUR_CUSTOM_PROFILE_NAME_HERE_ with your profile name.\ncolorssh determines when to change the SetProfile name. Currently it will\nchange to the SSH profile when one of the following values exist after $ ssh:\n-   web *\n-   production\n-   ec2-.*compute-1\n\n\nAgain, not my code, just a happy user.

When iTunes completes the import there's an annoying finished chime that sounds loudly because I'm listening to music.\nThere doesn't appear to be anything relevant in the prefs dialog. Web searches weren't helpful, and I've looked around in itunes prefs files but nothing looks useful there either.\nI'm hoping that there's an undocumented plist pref.\nI use iTunes on a Windows 7 machine.\nEDIT: @daniel-lawson approach seems to be the only way to solve this.\n\n\n*\n\n*Searching for filenames beginning with complete in the iTunes directory, I found: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\iTunes\\iTunes.Resources\\complete.wav\n\n*If you might want to reverse this in the future, make a copy of complete.wav\n\n*Truncate/Empty complete.wav somehow.\n\n*No more Import Complete sound.\n\n\nAlternately just delete complete.wav.

Though it's been some time since the original asker has posted his question, I thought that it would be worth noting that, as of October, the Mac OS X 10.7.5 supplemental update resolved my Spotlight issues.\nI was experiencing symptoms similar to the original poster's, with the same error messages that he encountered.\n\nA: I also had strange Spotlight issues on my boot volume after upgrading from 10.6.8 to 10.7.2 and again after applying a combo update to 10.7.3.\nI finally got things working again by trying the Spotless 4 demo\nhttp://www.fixamacsoftware.com/software/spot4/index.php\nOn the boot volume, I shut off indexing, deleted the index and then turning indexing back on.  After the rebuild, Spotlight worked.\n\nA: For the record, I have solved this problem by doing a completely clean installation of OS X 10.8 on a new hard drive, and manually migrating over my old files, apps, and settings.  It's unfortunate it came to that, and I wish I could offer a better answer that actually fixes the problem, but a reinstallation has finally solved my problem and I can use spotlight again.\n\nA: I ran into a problem that was pretty much like this. In my case I had moved the /Users directory to another drive and mounted that drive on /Users. I wasn't getting errors, but no files were showing up in All My Files.\nI tried the suggestion J.C. put forward, but the only way I could purge the .Spotlight-V100 directories was:\n    host:Users itsme$ sudo killall -9 mdworker; sudo rm -Rf /Users/.Spotlight-V100/ \n    host:Users itsme$ sudo mdutil -i on -E /\n\nUnless I put the mdworker kill on the same line with .Spotlight-V100 directory purge, mdworker would restart and hang the directory purge.

According to apple's latest documentation (at the time of writing), the cap on the 2012 MacBook Pros is 8GB RAM.\nThe Mac Pros, however, can take up to 32GB RAM.\nSo, why do the MacBooks have this cap? Is it a hardware issue, because I don't think it's a software one.\nThe OS X that runs on the Mac Pros is the same that runs on the MacBook Pros. Being 64-bit software on top of a 64-bit Architecture (both the MacBooks and the Mac Pros), it's obvious that the OS can use as much as 32 GB of RAM.\nIs it simply because manufactures don't make RAM sticks larger than 4GB for laptops?\n\nA: Anyone who knows isn't saying.  But apparently they can use up to 16GB. Other World Computing tests various machines for their actual (not specified) maximum useable memory and sells a 16GB memory kit for the current MacBook Pro.\n\nA: The limitation imposed is based on the chipsets used on the computer's motherboard. For example, the noted Apple maximums you mentioned for the MacBook Pro and the Mac Pro, are smaller than the maximums that those machines can address in practice. The MacBook Pro tested maximum is 16 GB according to EveryMac's MacBook Pro max RAM listing. And as for the Mac Pro, its maximum is 128 GB according to EveryMac's Mac Pro max RAM listing.\nAs noted on Intel's Specs, the CPU supports a different maximum than the chipset on the motherboard does. The Xeon X5670 used in the Mac Pro supports up to 288 GB.\nAnd as for the i7s e.g. a i7-2860QM used in the MacBook Pros, it supports up to 32 GB.\nSo these limitations come from engineering decisions made by Apple based on what kinds of chipsets are selected to be installed on the motherboard and what those chips support is what enforces the maximum amount of RAM that a particular Mac can address at or below what the CPU can actually address.\nAs for why Apple underrates their maximum numbers for RAM on some Macs, that's for Apple to know and for us to wonder. However, admittedly it is a nice practice to under promise and over deliver for whatever reason Apple has. Although, the Mac Pro supports more RAM than Mac OS X can address, according to OWC's testing on Mac Pros, where they discovered Mac OS X unofficially will not address more than 96GB of RAM, but other 64-bit operating system can get to the full 128GB.\n\nA: The Apple specs are never updated. For the MacbookPro 2012 it was 8GB of Ram. Later it has been tested by many many users to be max 16GB. Mine has 18GB from the beginning even (1 week after I bought it in 2012). The only point that you must \"obey\" is that the Ram has the exact specs as prescribed by Apple specs. There are many producers of Ram for mac.\nIf you want the modern or updated limits, download Mactracker from http://mactracker.ca/ or from the AppStore\n\nA: Because they want to make more money by having you pay for more ram. I work with windows all the time. I have a dual boot on my mac. The mac end only sees 8gb of ram installed but windows utilizes all 16. hardware that meets the specifications required will work in the hardware world. It is the software that determines how it's utilized. Trust me I build gaming rigs all the time.\n", "Q: Active Directory Network Account does not have login keychain?

Ever since I enabled iTunes Match, I feel like Music.app on my phone has become somewhat unreliable, and cumbersome at best.\nWhen polling for the full list of artists or albums (much less songs), it sometimes takes a full 15-20 seconds of frozen, iPhone-lockup that I don't experience anywhere else. Once I give the list enough time to load, it's more or less good, albeit with noticeable stuttering while scrolling, or lag. Occasionally the whole app will appear frozen and crash. Switching between album and artist view is unfortunately an exercise in patience. This is the only thing that's slow on my otherwise fantastic 16GB iPhone 4, and if there's something I'm missing that could fix the problem I'd be glad to hear it.\nSome theories I had: I'm willing to bet there are some hour-long radio shows that got tagged as \"Music\"-type media, and thus synced up to iTunes Match. Could a handful of long mp3s slow down the service? My library is over 100GB, is this just to be expected with an iTunes Match library of this size? I would assume that regardless of the size of the data library, the information that must be stored locally on the phone to accommodate (album lists + miniature thumbnails) must not be very much.\nHow could I begin to troubleshoot this?\n\nA: The size of your iTunes Match is a possible cause for your slowdown in the Music.\nSince you cannot have your entire library cached to your device, your device is probably trying to download all of the meta-data, and cover art thumbnails.  I only have around 12GB of music in my iTunes Match library, and I notice some sluggishness whenever things are added or I setup a new device.\nAnother cause of slowdown is actually the amount of images in the view.  Unfortunately, it is common for the device to become less responsive when there are a large number of images in a single, scrollable view.\n", "Q: Display problem after installing Win 7 on Macbook Pro 15 (2011) After installing Win 7 on my macbook via BootCamp I get a black screen on booting my macbook.

Kindle also doesn't want to! I have a wireless network in my apartment.  Because the apartment is large and walls are concrete, it was very hard to get wifi coverage throughout the whole place. Therefore I have one Airport Extreme, and then multiple Airport Expresses, and I have configured the airport expresses to join and extend the wireless network that is created on the main (airport extreme) unit.\nThe question:  When I am far from the original (airport extreme) unit, my iPad has no problem getting a four-bars connection from the satellite airport express that is relaying the connection. BUT, my ipod touch (and my Kindle also) can NOT connect to it. They just want to connect to the main central unit.\nbelieve me I have re-configured this thing a DOZEN times... using the crystal clear normal method to get the distributed network going across all the airports... always the same problem. \nHas anyone found this to be the case -- that the iPod Touch, and a regular lowest-level kindle (bottom of the line unit as of 2012), will not connect to the WDS satellite, only the main unit?\n[I will admit, i am only somewhat sure that the method I use, where I configure the units to \"join and extend\" the main network, is actually the same as WDS.]\n\nA: I've pretty much solved this problem. I do not FULLY understand why, but now I can have my iPod touch (and I am hoping my kindle) attach correctly to the satellite/repeater airport express.  Here is what I did:\nI did two configuration changes to my central hub airport extreme router (i.e., the one that my other routers were merely configured to \"extend.\")  I realize now that these are both configurations that must be done at that central router, and the repeater routers then simply mimic or reflect accordingly.\n-- First, I used the most recent Airport Utility (v6.0) and clicked on my main router (which, crucially, is an airport extreme that has dual band 802.11, both 2.4ghz and 5ghz.) \n-- In the airport utility, I clicked on that Extreme router and then in its funky popup window, clicked Edit.\n-- Clicked the tab called Wireless.\n-- Clicked on Wireless Options button.\n-- the first config change I made on that page was to change the Radio Mode setting to \"802.11a/n - 802.11 b/g.\"\n     What nobody really tells you is that that hyphenated choice means that the 5GHz band will use the first of those two (namely, a and n, in other words the strong modern N standard will be used on this band ONLY) ... while the 2.4GHZ band will use only the second of those two, b/g, in other words, the devices that only can use that older weaker standard.\n     So, it's kind of a segregation. I'm telling it \"No, don't let the 2.4 ghz band try to handle traffic using N. That band will just take care of the old crappy clients.\" \n-- the second config change that I made on that page was to check the check box to make a totally separate wireless network name for the 5GHZ band.  Further segregating things.  When I tried my solution without this additional step, my problem did not fix itself, though I don't fully see why.\nAs I said, a few questions remain in my head, but the darn thing works, so I'm happy. Among many other questions... are those airport expresses dual-band too? I didn't think they were but somehow they are repeating this dual-band strategy?  Whatever. it works.\nWanted to say thanks to Richard, whose reply caused me to get off my butt and try more investigating into this.\n", "Q: iPhone 3G cannot send mail - rejected by the server because it does not allow relaying I am trying to send an email from my AOL account from my iPhone 3G, however everytime I try and send a mail I get the following error:\n\nCannot Send Mail\nA copy has been placed in your Outbox. The recipient\n   was rejected by the server because it does not\n  allow relaying.\n\nI used to be able to send emails from this handset and haven't had this phone connected to iTunes for a few weeks now.\n\nA: In general, this is probably because one of, or a combination of the following reasons:\n1. Outgoing mail server requires authentication\nTo avoid abuse by spammers, many outgoing mail servers require authentication for relaying messages across the the internet. You should check if the outgoing mail server you are using for this account requires authentication, and if so properly set it up in your account settings. These typically use the same credentials as the ones for checking your mail with the same provider.\n2. Outgoing mail server only accepts connections from the same network\nMany ISPs only allow connections from hosts which are connected through their own network. If sending mails through your ISP's outgoing mail server works fine from your home Wifi, but stops working over a cellular data connection, or an external Wifi hotspot, this probably is the case.\nIn this case you can use another outgoing mail server. If you have a Gmail or an iCloud account you can use those outgoing servers for sending mails.\n3. Incorrect settings\nDouble-check the settings for your outgoing mail server as they are specified by your email provider, especially server name, encryption and the port to connect to. If everything looks ok, try to recreate the account. For AOL and other popular services, there are presets for creating a new account which will fill out all the correct server details.\nThe specific settings for AOL's outgoing mail server are specified here:\nSMTP Outgoing Server Address: smtp.aol.com (Use port 587 for standard or 465 for SSL connections)\nSMTP Username: YourUsername@aol.com (or @love.com, @games.com, etc.)\nSMTP Password: password you use to login to Mail\n\nFor a secure connection, check the SSL option for IMAP/POP and TLS for\nSMTP in your mail program.\n\n\nA: I was able to receive emails on my iphone 4, however,I would get the \"failure notification\" when trying to send an email. Go To: settings/mail/choose email account/SMTP settings/primary mail server. Make sure you have your user name and password keyed in under the Outgoing Mail Server information. This fixed the problem for me. Hope this helps! \n", "Q: Does the performance increases when the memory increases in Apple products? I am planning to buy an iPad 3. My choices are,\n\n\n*\n\n*iPad 3 - 32GB with wifi\n\n*iPad 3 - 16GB with wifi + 4G\n\n\nI'm so confused to select my best choice.\nActually the problem is, some of my friends telling that, the performance and the OS update support depends on the memory size only. That is,\nthe higher memory capacity device has high performance with future OS update supports (Because, the new updates may eat more memory). So they are suggesting the iPad 3 - 32GB (wifi alone).\nIs their answer right?\n\nA: All 3rd generation iPads perform pretty much identically, because they have the same CPU, GPU and RAM (memory). Battery life varies between the Wifi and Wifi+4G models (with the 4G models getting a bit less battery life in exchange for a bit more connectivity).\nThe 16/32/64gb figure refers only to how much data (music, videos, books, apps and associated stuff) you can store on the device.\nI suspect when apple drop OS support for the 1st generation iPad, they'll drop them all at once, no matter how much storage space they have.\n\nA: You appear to be mixing up Memory and Storage Capacity.  The amount of memory (speicifically the RAM) is the same regardless of the storage capacity of the model you choose (or is when comparing different models from the same generation).  This memory, (which is something like 512Mb or 1Gb, I forget which but it's actually not that important) is important when it comes to performance, but not in the same way as for PCs, and because there is nothing you can do about it, they all have the same, it's not worth including in any purchasing decisions.\nIn terms of how much Storage Capacity you might need (16/32Gb) it's a matter of what you will use it for, rather than anything else.  Consider that the same OS is supported on an 8Gb iPhone 4, the base OS is less than 1Gb total and a ralatively minor part of your total storage.  Obviously the percentage of your storage that the OS takes up is doubled each time you half the capacity options, but it would only ever be an issue for you in terms of upgrades if you completely filled the iPad with apps and data, and only you can know what usage you will do as to if that is likely.  Games and video editing/lots of photos/music etc will eat up space, other apps less so.  I have a 16Gb iPad adn was initially concerned it would not be large enough given the size of new retina apps, but that is unfounded.  Having said that, I have no video or music on it, I stream all that.\nFuture OS updates will be carried out (in all liklihood, if the past is any indicator of the future) on a generational basis, not on specific models within that generation.  So your your original iPhone 4 supports the latest iOS release, you can be sure that it is all models of that phone that have the support, not just the ones with more storage.\n\nA: Nothing is like that.\nI am having \"8GB-iPod Touch\" bought 3 years back but it runs the latest iOS-5.1.1 very fine.\niPad storage capacity is just about the amount of storage of data.\nGo ahead with your budget.\nIts not gonna affect future versions of iOS.\n\nA: The statement of your friends is incorrect. The OS is installed on a separate partition that is the same size on all iPads and makes no change in the speed of the device.\n", "Q: How do I restore itunes library onto another computer I followed all the steps as suggested for backing up and restore iTunes library in the apple support website: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1751 but I have problems with the 'choose library' part in the last step. I clicked it and located my iTunes Media folder but all that happened was that it just opened the folder and showed me what I have inside and not restore it.\n\nA: I'm just echoing the Apple KB article for anyone else who comes across this answer. I have used this process many times when moving or reformatting my computer:\n\nProcess for restoring an iTunes library:\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit iTunes.\n\n*Copy your iTunes folder from your external hard drive to whatever location you desire on your internal hard drive.\n\n*Open iTunes while holding down the Option key (Mac) or Shift key (Windows).\n\n*In the resulting dialog, click the Choose Library button.\n\n\n*Navigate to the new iTunes folder you just copied and locate the iTunes Library.itl file\n\n*Click Choose (Mac OS X) or Open (Windows)\n\n*iTunes will open and your iTunes Library will be restored.\n\n\nA: You have to select the iTunes folder you just moved to the internal hard drive, not the iTunes folder currently on your computer.\nIf you were backing up to a disc, you have to follow these instructions.\n", "Q: Does a Macbook Pro have 1 or 2 Hard Disk Controllers? If SATA channel 1 (used by the hard drive) is damaged, could it be that SATA channel 2 (used by the SuperDrive) is fine?\nI would like to know if I can use a hard drive on the SuperDrive channel even though the hard disk channel is damaged.\n\nA: It has two and yes, you can make the controller that connects to the SuperDrive spot the primary controller and run your MacBook Pro exclusively off a drive attached to this controller.\nI'm writing this from a MacBook Pro that has an SSD installed into the SuperDrive spot using an OWC DataDoubler bracket. This is the primary drive in my machine and the mechanical drive has come and gone from the machine without any issues. The machine still booted, ran from my SSD in the SuperDrive spot.\n\nA: I'm not sure if its the same kind of SATA controller, but Other World Computing sells something they call the Data Doubler for certain types of Macs. It's a drive bracket that sits in the SuperDrive slot and supplies a second 2.5\" drive bay using the SuperDrive's interface.\nThe bracket contains a small ICB, but I'm not sure if it's converting anything to the standard SATA interface or going straight through. In either case, you would need something to mount your new drive in--it's probably not practical to route the second channel to the first drive bay since everything inside the case is designed so compactly.\n", "Q: Sorting of Spotlight's search results is disabled in Lion I can't sort Spotlight's search results - sorting by Name, Date Modified, et. al appears to be disabled.  Google seems to be useless in finding a resolution to this - although I suspect a previous installation of Quicksilver had something to do with this.\nI have forced Spotlight to reindex, but it still doesn't work.\nFinder otherwise functions normally.\n\n\nA: Finder has two different sorting modes (the new Arrange By and the old Sort By) on Lion. If the Arrange By mode is set to something other than none, you can't sort columns in list view by clicking the list headers.\nSo just select View > Arrange By > None.\n\n\nA: You can sort by selecting the column in the grouping dropdown (the icon to the right of the cog wheel on the screen shot). Names get sorted Z->A though, haven't found a way to change this yet.\n", "Q: Mac spontaneously restarts I'm running Snow Leopard 10.6.8. I leave my machine for an hour. When I return the machine is asleep and all the applications have been shut down. It is almost as if it has spontaneously restarted. \nAny ideas what could be causing this?\n\nA: I'm not sure what is causing it, but it sounds like a hardware issue, or that the power outlet the machine is plugged into may be faulty. \nYou can try going to the Energy Saver preference pane and unchecking Start up automatically after a power failure. If the computer really is shutting down and restarting this may help you find out.\nIf it is shutting down, it may be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Faulty power supply\n\n*Faulty power outlet or another electronic device complicating power in that outlet\n\n*Overheating\n\n\nA: If you are running Lion, you may be seeing the effects of Lion's auto kill feature. This feature automatically quits any applications that are open if they haven't been used in awhile. Try disabling it as such by typing this in Terminal:\ndefaults write -g NSDisableAutomaticTermination -bool yes\n\nTo turn it back on:\ndefaults write -g NSDisableAutomaticTermination -bool no\n\nFrom this answer.\n", "Q: iPhone app that allows simultaneous playing of music to multiple devices The idea is to use each iPhone as a speaker for one track of music. \nPicture it: you are in the park, having a picnic and you would like your music to be played louder. Why not sync all the iPhones to play the same song at the same time?\nDoes such an app exist?\n\nA: Yes. You can use Airfoil, to stream music from your Mac using Airfoil for Mac to any iOS device with the Airfoil Speakers Touch app (free). It is as simple as turning on a speaker system, one button and you have the streaming audio from your Mac on your iOS device. I would highly recommend this!\n\nA: I think Seedio and Seedio Free do what you want.\n\nA: back in 2013, I was one of the co-founders of Audibly, wireless synchronized surround sound for iOS.

Here is my configuration.\n13\" MacBook Pro, min-2010\n2.4 GHz Core 2 Duo\n4 GB RAM\nOS X Lion 10.7.4\n\nWould you recommend upgrading to SSD for fast processing or would upgrading RAM will be better?\nI am also worried about my pocketbook. 320 GB of hard disk can be used as external hard disk after upgrading, but in case of RAM previous RAM will be useless, as the Macbook Pro only has two slots. (Currently both are used, 2GB RAM slots each.)\nPS: I am a Ruby on Rails and iOS developer and using my MacBook Pro more than 15 hours a day for coding purpose. I have the 2 year extended warranty.\n\nA: It depends on how much RAM you're using. Use something like iStat Menus or MenuMeters to keep an eye on your RAM usage.\nIf you're constantly near or over 4 GB RAM used (wired+active), more RAM will be the better option. (You can also tell this by seeing how much swap space you use; if it's over some nominal value like 64-128 MB get more RAM.)\nIf, on the other hand, you never even get close to 4 GB of RAM usage, get the SSD. Or, get more RAM anyway and use the excess as a ramdisk, which will be way, way faster than an SSD.\n\nA: At current prices you can upgrade to 8GB RAM for about $56. If you buy it from Other World Computing, they will buy your original RAM back from you for $8. Net cost, $48 not including shipping.\n\nA: If your swap usage is low, then the SSD would be better.\nOnly if the memory is saturated (swap full), is more memory useful.\n\nA: I've just updated both my Macbook (black, not Pro) and my Mini with Seagate Momentus XT 750GB - Hybrid hard drives at a mere £120 (about $165) a pop. This is a combined conventional + SSD disk with optimizing software. The speed and disk space improvements are fantastic. highly recommended.\nNote: If you do a Carbon Copy Cloner swap out using a HD enclosure, note that the Momentus needs full power, one USB worth might not be enough.\n\nA: I'd have to say that at 4GB of RAM already, you'd benefit more from a fast SSD.\n\nA: A few points:\n\n\n*\n\n*You'll almost never see Active + Wired RAM usage exceed 70% of your total RAM. So don't think you're not maxing it out if you see ~25% \"Inactive.\" If your Page Outs are high after a couple hours of use (eg over 1GB) get more RAM for sure.\n\n*RAM is a relatively cheap and easy upgrade. I just got a new MBP and have quickly found 4GB just isn't enough... but I also use Photoshop a fair amount as well.\n\n*Some of it boils down to what your current HD is. I have a Hitachi 7k500 in my 2007 MBP, and it's MUCH snappier than this 5200RPM drive Apple is currently shipping in new MBPs. The Hitachi drive is easily 2x faster.\n\n*Your system doesn't have dedicated VRAM, so it's using your regular RAM for VRAM. Yet another reason to upgrade the RAM.\n", "Q: Is it possible to join the Apple Developer Program with a Visa Prepaid card? I have just ordered a Visa reLoad card where you simply put money on your card before you buy something. Will this work with an Apple Developers subscription? \n\nA: Visa Pre-Paid is a credit card. It will honored providing they can charge those $99 successfully to it. They don't really care if it's pre-paid, secured or non-secured. If they can charge it, they'll gladly accept it, like any other business would. The money is real either way.\n\nA: It's a safe bet that it ought to. I'm not sure there's any reliable way to tell what account number is a \"real\" credit card or debit card (i.e., linked to a checking account) vs. a prepaid debit card (like yours).\nBear in mind, though, that when it comes time to renew, the transaction will fail unless you have the funds on the card or change to a new card. \n", "Q: Frontmost USB port stopped working properly on a MacBook Pro 13\" Late 2011 I bought my Macbook Pro new this year in Jan 2012; it is the 13\" Core i5 SKU. The USB port furthest from the screen on the left does not work with storage devices, though I have tested it with a USB Mouse and it seems to work. However on hard drives, USB keys, and an Arduino it doesn't work.\nI cannot sync my iPod touch with it either.\nDoes anyone know what this may be?\n\nA: Just reset PRAM and it will start working again. It has done it for me many times.\n\nA: The port may not supply enough power for the power hungry units to work.  \nYou may have to use a powered USB hub.\n", "Q: What are the Time Capsule performance if used as a File Server for 3-4 clients? I plan to use time capsule as a file server into a production environment with 3-4 mac clients. \nCan you give me some information about possible drawback with this choice? What are Time Capsule performance?\n\nA: The drive is a nice, fast server grade drive but the controller is underpowered to be a NAS for professional video work.\nThat being said, even with two people reading / writing lots of small files, the Time Capsule works surprisingly well. At times when 3 or more people are hitting the drive at the same time for small IO, you will certainly see a slow down. Much more so than on a real NAS or server that has RAM to cache the filesystem and not be limited to the physical disk access.\nSo if the usage is low or you are on a tight budget, have at it!\nDo be sure to have one of your clients be responsible for backing up all data stored on that volume since most backup solutions do not read from a Time Capsule directly. Using the built in clone tool is not at all optimal for production use, but is fine to make a snapshot over night or over a weekend when you have occasional cause to snapshot the data.\n\nA: As bmike stated, backup of the Time Capsule is an issue. My advice is that you'd be better off using a NAS with RAID 1 or 5 and swappable drives so that you're not going to lose data.\nFor the cost of a Time Capsule, you could build a relatively good FreeNAS box, or buy an off the shelf NAS which both support AFP and will work happily with both OSX and Windows systems.\nYou'll get much more control over access rights with a dedicated NAS solution, and with RAID you get more redundancy in case of drive failures. Backup of NAS drives to other NAS' or external drives is also normally an out of the box option too.\n", "Q: Trackpad Gestures - Three-finger swipe unresponsive until I use two-finger scroll (OS X Lion) Sometime within the last week or so, I noticed this really weird glitch with my trackpad. I have always used the three-finger swipe to navigate forwards and backwards on web browsers, between tabs in my terminal, from the album view to the main iTunes display, etc. However, for some reason my trackpad is not responding to this gesture when I first select a given window, but as soon as I use the two-finger scroll in any direction, it suddenly starts working as normal.\nI've tested it in every application I use the gesture for, and it's the same in all of them. It was definitely not doing this a few weeks ago, and I haven't changed any system preferences since then. It's also incredibly annoying and slowing down my workflow, so I'm trying to troubleshoot the issue.\nI've tried changing the swipe from three finger to two finger, but the problem persisted. Google has turned up nothing, so I'm just hoping someone might have an idea what could be causing it. Any help would be greatly appreciated!\n\nA: I'm not sure that this really counts as an answer, but in my case the problem went away after I did two things:\n1) installed the most recent update from apple, and \n2) manually closed all my programs and restarted them (I usually just have them reopen automatically when logging back in) \n", "Q: QuickLook HTML plugin? I'm looking for a plugin that will display me the text of HTML files in QuickLook rather than a preview of the rendered HTML.\nDoes anyone know of such a plugin?\n\nA: You are looking for qlcolorcode. qlcolorcode allows you to have syntax highlighting in your quicklook preview:\n\n\nA: qlcolorcode didn't display HTML files by default on my installation of 10.8. I could get it to display them by adding public.html and public.xhtml to CFBundleDocumentTypes:LSItemContentTypes in ~/Library/QuickLook/QLColorCode.qlgenerator/Contents/Info.plist and logging out and back in.\nYou could also remove /System/Library/QuickLook/Web.qlgenerator/, but it also handles webarchive and svg files. Removing the entries for public.html and public.xhtml from the Info.plist didn't seem to work.\n\nA: I had to get rid of the Web.qlgenerator to make this work, using either the QLColorCode or the QLStephen plugins, in OSX Mavericks.\n", "Q: 10.6 PHD file type exclusion I manage an environment that uses portable home directories for users with 10.6 for both the client and server. I've setup syncing via Workgroup Manager of pretty much entire home directories except for ~/Movies and ~/Music directories.\nUnfortunately  I have a particular user that insists on downloading a lot of media (movies, tv shows) on the company provided laptop and leaving it in hierarchical folders on the Desktop, which then syncs multiple gigs every day to our fileserver when she gets on site.\nHow do I specify the exclusion of .avi and .mkv file extensions within just the ~/Desktop directory using Workgroup Manager?\n\nA: If you never intend on .avi or .mkv files to be synced you may want to try the following.\n\n\n*\n\n*Mobile Pane\n\n*Skip items that match any of the following\n\n*Choose Name Contains and type \".avi\" (without quotes). \n\n*\n\n*Do the same for \".mkv\" (without quotes).\n\n\n\nIf you do intend on syncing both file types and would like only to stop them from syncing when they are found within the Desktop folder you may want to try the following.\n\n\n*\n\n*Mobile Pane\n\n*Skip items that match any of the following\n\n*Choose Full Path and type \"~/Desktop/*.avi\" (without quotes)\n\n*\n\n*Do the same for \"~/Desktop/*.mkv\" (without quotes)\n\n\n", "Q: iPhone 4 won't charge Tried plenty of other cables and plugs but it won't charge.\nI tried plugging it into a Mac and it's not even detected.\nIt has had no major water damage; it just simply stopped working.\nReplaced battery with new battery, also replaced the dock connector with a new replacement but still no change.\nCould this be the logic board?

I am trying to get my new HP ZR30W working at full 2560x1600 with my mid-2010 MacBook Pro through a mini DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable.\nI have seen people saying they have it working, but I can't seem to get it to accept anything but the 1280x800 res, even with SwitchResX.\nI know the current Mac solution is a $100 mini DisplayPort to dual-link DVI adapter, but that seems rediculous to me when the monitor has a DisplayPort input.\nAnyone have this working and have tips?\nUpdate: I gave up after much tinkering and bought the adapter. I would still love to hear if anyone has made this work.\n\nA: It's likely that you just have a defective unit. There's no active circuitry in a mini-Displayport to Displayport connector, and a Google search suggests that this monitor has worked with Macs over Displayport (as you would expect), but some people have had resolution detection issues.\nIf the dual-link adapter is working for you, great; however it may be worth investigating a warranty exchange, as that adapter has not always been reliable for others.\n", "Q: Mail.app AppleScript to process POP3 mails stopped working in Lion I have a Mail.app rule script that worked fine in Mac OS X Snow Leopard. It is simply a script that allows for AND/OR boolean logic combined together to trigger one (rarely two) of the following actions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Move message to archive folder\n\n*Delete email message (move to trash)\n\n*Forward the message to someone\n\n*Color the message (to signal importance)\n\n\nYou can review the script here. The bulk of the script is made of the boolean conditions I’m looking at (and yes, I know my multiple 'else if's' could have been combined into fewer if statements, but I just found it easier to have each ‘condition’ that I’m looking for in its own if statement).\nIn Snow Leopard, everything worked fine, but in Lion I get some strange behavior. My Inbox gets tricked/stuck thinking it has emails to download. Basically every message that would have been ‘moved/deleted’ somehow doesn’t get flagged as processed on my POP3 server. So every time I get mail, I see the following under Mail Activity: ‘Incoming Messages… X of Y’ (where Y is the growing number of emails affected by my script), yet nothing new is downloaded.\nIf I turn my Mail Rule off that runs the script, all emails are re-downloaded again into my Inbox. A few points of note:\n\n\n*\n\n*I’m connecting to POP3 accounts\n\n*I used to use Growl 1.2.2, but I disabled that on a hunch that it wasn’t compatible with Lion. You’ll still see a sendGrowl function in the script, but you’ll notice that the entire function body is commented out.\n\n\nAny suggestions or ideas on how to get this working again so I could tame my inbox would be EXTREMELY appreciated.\n\nA: Judging from your description of the issue, it seems that Lion’s Mail.app has difficulties correctly executing a move AppleScript action on a PO3 server (or maybe just your POP3 server – not having a POP server to test myself, I cannot check). A solution could be to separate the two components of the move operation by replacing the line\nmove eachMessage to mailbox \"Archived/BTR Monitoring Emails\"\n\nwith\ncopy eachMessage to mailbox \"Archived/BTR Monitoring Emails\"\ndelete eachMessage\n\nin the hope that an express deletion command will fare better. If that doesn’t alleviate the issue (because the deletions suffer from the same issue – I can’t say for sure from your question), you could also try setting the delete status of the message instead of sending it a delete command, i.e.\ncopy eachMessage to mailbox \"Archived/BTR Monitoring Emails\"\nset deleted status of eachMessage to true\n\nthough I’m not entirely sure how that will go down within a POP server (it sounds like something designated for IMAP).\nFinally, you could try commenting out the set read status of eachMessage to true lines in the filing and deletion blocks – this should, by rights, not affect the server, as POP3 has no notion of a “read status” (you need IMAP to store that server side), but it might conceivably be an issue if Mail’s AppleScript thinks otherwise. Setting the message status to read can also be achieved within a rule without resorting to AppleScript, so removing this from the script should be a non-issue.\n", "Q: How to automatically start a VirtualBox VM in OS X Lion? I have a VirtualBox VM set up on OS X Lion. How do I have it automatically start when I log into my account?\n\nA: Add the .VDI file for the VM you wish to auto run to your System Preferences > Users > Login Item. You can find the .VDI file in the folder of the VM. The default name of the folder VirtualBox saves these to is called VirtualBox VMs.\n\nA: You have to add the .vbox file to the startup items rather than the .vdi like dennis.hempler said. The .vbox is specially designed for booting VMs without opening the app.\n\nA: I added terminal to open at login from the dock, added Virtualbox to also open at login at startup.\nPut a shell command to start up my VM. You can set that in Terminal app preferences under shell tab, there is a startup command you can enter.\nThe following is mine.\nVBoxManage startvm VirtualBox --type headless\nWhere VirtualBox is your box name whatever that may be.

I'm traveling overseas and I wish I had a regular iPod touch so that I can just use WiFi to check emails without paying a roaming fee. I have an iPhone with an AT&T sim card. I was wondering if I could remove the sim card and turn it into an iPod touch without having to pay a roaming fee? Does the phone still know it belongs to me even without the sim card? \n\nA: gentmatt's answer is correct, however if you don't need to make phone calls at all you can also just turn on airplane mode. I have done this many times abroad. Turn on airplane mode in settings, then turn wifi back on. Your cellular signal stays off.\n\nA: Yes.\nYou can use your iPhone's Wi-Fi without a SIM card, no matter where you are.\nIf you still want to be able to make calls, but avoid celluar data (data roaming) you can choose to disable just this feature.\nYou can get further information from Apple's support website at iPhone and iPad: Using cellular networks while in another country.\n\nIf you do not have an international data plan, turn off Cellular Data and/or Data Roaming to avoid data roaming charges:\n\n*\n\n*iPhone: Tap Settings > General > Network\n\n*iPad: Tap Settings > Cellular Data\n\nWhen data roaming and cellular data are off, you should not see a cellular-network indicator in the status bar.\n\n\nA: Yes, you aren't able to text or talk though. Also, you will have the phone on Airplane mode so you don't get any roaming charges.But you are able to use camera and stuff, if you take it off airplane mode then you can connect to wifi.\n\nA: The answer is Yes and No. Yes because WI-Fi can be used without SIM card where there is no authentication reqd. and NO because to use Wi-Fi at airports, railway stations you require  authentication where they send one time password(OTP) to start using the Wi-Fi services available.\n", "Q: How to get Mac OS X to run in a VM on Windows I want to be able to run RubyMotion on Windows 7 computers.  But RubyMotion only runs on Mac OS X Lion.  So it seems like the only option is to run a virtual machine on the Windows 7 computers which run Mac OS X.\nWhat's the best way to do this?  I assume I have to buy a copy of Mac OS X for each Windows 7 computer?\n\nA: You can technically run Lion in a VM, but I really really really wouldn't recommend it. Here's why:\n\n\n*\n\n*You're basically entering the murky world of Hackintoshes\n\n*Hackintoshes are inherently \"hacky\". The performance is rarely going to be as reliable as running OSX on mac hardware.\n\n*You're violating Apple's EULA.\nIf you really want to do it, here's a link, but I really think it's a fool's game.\nRecommendation\nYou'd be better off just getting a Mac Mini or something and if you really want to run Windows natively, then remote desktop from Windows to your Mac mini. I'd recommend that.\n\nA: The best way to do have both OS X and Windows running on the same computer is to buy a Mac and run a Windows 7 VM on it using VMware Fusion. \nApple sees itself as a hardware company and uses its software to get you to buy their hardware.  As such, Apple is very committed to preventing anything that would allow you to use their software without buying their hardware and they are doing a pretty good job of it. If you're going to be developing for iOS (whether you use RubyMotion or not), then you are into a professional realm where time = money and the money you save by not buying a Mac will be eaten up by jumping through hoops trying to circumvent Apple's enforcement measures.  \n", "Q: Inverted colors in Iphone Recently the colors on my Iphone 3g have started looking inverted or negative, I havent dropped my phone or had it damaged, but I cant seem to make it go back to normal.  i have also done some research on this and found out that you can purposely do this through accessibility but my phone doesnt give me that option....HELP! \n\nA: You need to look in General Settings. Scroll down to Accessibility. In there, you have a switch to turn White on Black on/off. That's the thing that reverses the colours on the iPhone.\nIs your iPhone jailbroken?\n", "Q: what is \"translate\" and why does it want access to my keychain? I use Entourage for my email accounts but I keep getting a pop up saying \n\"translate wants to use your confidential information stored in \"[my email account]\" in your keychain. Do you want to allow access to this item?\"\nBy always allowing I found the location through keychain - /usr/libexec/oah/translate but I can't locate it through finder.\nI am worried that this might be malware, does anyone know what it is?\n\nA: It looks like /usr/libexec/oah/translate is Rosetta, an Apple program to allow programs developed for PowerPC architecture to run on the newest Intel Mac.\nSo I don't think it's a malware, just Mac OS using Rosetta to run Entourage.\n\nA: /usr is a hidden folder, so that's why you normally can't see it. I use iTweaX to show these, but I'm sure there are other methods. \nI just today got this same thing in Entourage, so I scanned the libexec subfolder with ClamXav, just to be careful. It showed no viruses. After I did a hard restart of the Mac, all seems to be back to normal in Entourage. Unfortunately, I still have no idea what suddenly caused these keychain requests to appear, after years of using Entourage.\nI also just ran across this in Apple Support Communities: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2123451?tstart=0 \nFWIW, I'm running MacOS 10.6.8, and Entourage 2004 11.4.0, on a 2007 MacBook.\n", "Q: Mac Mini server - Dual screens? I'd like to setup dual screens on the new Mac Mini OS X Lion server, however as I understand it you need to use the HDMI port and the thunderbolt port. The only problem I have is I'm already using the thunderbolt port for a thunderbolt drive.\nWill a HDMI splitter work? Or a thunderbolt splitter?\nThe thunderbolt drive has an extra thunderbolt port in the back (2, I'm only using 1), can I connect the other monitor to that, will that work? I doubt it but I thought I'd ask anyway.\nOr, is there another way around this?\n\nA: You can daisy chain up to 6 Thunderbolt devices from a single port, so you can connect the display via an adapter to that without any problems.\n", "Q: Syncing bookmarks between iCloud and Firefox I use Windows 7 and I've just got myself a lovely new iPhone. I've installed iCloud and it synchronizes my iPhone's calendar with Outlook, which is great, but I also prefer Firefox over Safari, but iCloud only apparently supports Safari or Internet Explorer (yuck).\nIs there any way to sync bookmarks between Firefox/iCloud/iPhone?\nEdit: A bit of research brings up a thing called Firefox Home - How does this fit in?\n\nA: I use Xmarks, but this means that you'd have to have Safari or IE open (or at least the Xmarks client for them open) when you're on your desktop. \nThis way when you add/remove bookmarks from Firefox, Xmarks will bring it over to Safari, then Safari will bring it to iCloud.\n\nA: It seems to me that your goal is to sync your bookmarks across multiple browsers, particularly Firefox on your PC and the built-in Safari browser on your iPhone.  \nIf the use of iCloud isn't a hard requirement (and I don't know why it would be), then use XMarks instead.\n\n\n*\n\n*First, get an XMarks account.   \n\n*Second, install XMarks for Firefox. \n\n*Third, install XMarks for iPhone.\n\n\n[1] http://www.xmarks.com/\n[2] https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/xmarks-sync/\n[3] http://blog.xmarks.com/2010/08/xmarks-for-iphone-ipad-v127_8748.html\n", "Q: Google Street View not working on the new iPad (3rd generation iPad) Trying to use the Google Street View in Safari is crashing in the new iPad.

On a 24\" display, there is enough space to display all the toolbar icons of my applications.\nBut on the MacBook 13\" display some of them are not displayed.\nIs there a way to scroll the tools bar in order to see the entire set of icons?\n\nA: I use AccessMenubarApps which works on the basic principle of temporarily replacing the current menubar with a shorter one to allow all the menubar icons to be visible. It can be accessed by clicking on the icon, via mouse gestures, or a configurable hotkey.\n\nA: Not exactly what you are looking for (not a scrolling solution), but you could have a look at Bartender. By putting the least important icons in there, and leaving the most important ones in place, you could have 2 levels of icons, hopefully giving enough real estate to display all of them in your 13\" display.\n", "Q: What is a good RAW File Processor/Developer/Editor for Mac? What is a good quality, and ideally free or cheap, RAW file processor for Mac OS X 10.7? Until I switched to Mac from Ubuntu, I used RawTherapee, which served me well, but unfortunately it's not supported on Lion.\nIdeally I'd prefer not splashing out on a pro-level graphics suite; I just want some basic abilities like exposure/color adjustment, aligning, etc. - with output to .JPG. If the tool also has a general photo management capability, great, but I can live without that.\nI'm struggling to find anything that quite meets what I'm looking for. I tried Raw Photo Processor, but the interface is cumbersome and confusing.\n\nA: Apple iPhoto '11\nLet's not forget that Apple iPhoto '11 costs $15 in the Mac App Store, and that it has processing tools for RAW as well as frequently-updated profiles for working with many makes and models of cameras that produce RAW image files.\nGoogle Picasa\nGoogle Picasa is free and supports many RAW formats.\nCanon Digital Photo Professional\nversion 3.11.26 is compatible with Mac OS X Lion.

Otherwise, here is how you can get it:\nCanon Digital Photo Professional comes on a CD with a suite of programs called Canon Digital Camera Solutions Disk ver. 38.1.\nI recently bought a used Canon Powershot G10 whose seller did not provide the original software sold with a new Canon. So I called up Canon's customer service, explained that I bought a used Canon, and asked them if I could purchase their tools on CD. They sold me the suite for US $20 plus tax and shipping (it came to $27). \n\n...you may purchase the latest Canon Digital Camera Software Solutions\n  disc for your camera through Canon USA's Customer Support Center at\n  1-800-828-4040.

What currently happens is the person who is getting an upgrade comes in, activates the handset and I can then update it. I then add everything that they need on the phone from the iphone configuration utility and the appstore which involves them needing to be there to enter usernames/passwords.\nThis is all fine apart from it takes quite a bit of time out of the person's schedule. I feel it would be a much better approach if I was able to update all the phones beforehand and then have the recipient activate the phone. This would save on the large amount of time that is spent waiting for the phones to update, which is important when the recipients have very little time spare as they have incredibly busy schedules and getting the time required can be quite a squeeze.\nIs there anyway I can update first or am I out of luck?\nNote: We are using Windows so the Apple Configurator isn't an option\n\nA: You are forced to activate the phones OTA or via iTunes before you can sync apps over the 30 pin connector or access iCloud or the App Store on iOS.\nYou can put the devices into recovery mode and update the OS from iTunes to get part of the way there.\nJust because you're a windows shop, don't assume you won't come out ahead getting the configurator and a computer to use as an appliance for saving you valuable time in setting up the devices your employees are using. I understand not wanting to fight a battle with limited time, but this might be a nice time to branch out and come out ahead in experience and tools.\nIf I were in your situation, I would have each employee make iCloud and ensure the device is backed up to iCloud to do the migration. You can be there to guide them, but they are responsible for moving their data and settings to their new devices. (Your comment about data privacy means iCloud is clearly not something you want so I understand that with sensitive data but perhaps others can rely on that when they have a similar problem)\nYou can update all the new devices to iOS 5.1.1 and they can get help from you if they can't get their devices up to that level or backed up before they arrive for their exchange.\n\nA: Are you using the iPhone Configuration Utility, or Apple's new Configurator utility for 10.7?\nFrom Configurator's help section it seems you could configure a single new iOS device, back  it up, then restore that to multiple new devices.\n", "Q: What's a good sports tracker app for iPhone? I'm looking for an app for tracking activities like walking, running or bicycling. Lots of people I know with Android or Nokia phones use such apps, but I don't know what's a good option for iOS.\nRequirements:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can track time & distance covered (using GPS)\n\n*Should be very simple to use: 1) start the tracker 2) go for the walk/run/ride 3) stop the tracker and see the distance & time\n\n*Available on App Store (i.e. works on non-jailbroken devices)\n\n\nPreferably free, but feel free to recommend an excellent paid app too if you know of one.\nAlso, it's a plus if I can use the app for my simple needs without signing up to any service.\n\nA: There are a number of them in the App Store that meet your criteria.  Here are the ones I've used:\n\n\n*\n\n*Strava.  This app motivates people into exercising harder by bringing out their competitive side.  With Strava, you can compare your times with others who've done the same route.  This app is most useful when you workout in a group where you'll be able to push each other.\n\n*Runkeeper.  The unique feature of this app is in its \"coaching\".  Basically, if you like to change your pace at certain intervals, the app can notify you when to switch.  Additionally, this app can pair to a heartrate monitor.\n\n*MapMyRun.  This one tries to be your overall fitness app where you can also log your caloric intake and other activities such as weightlifting.\n\n\nThey are all good options depending on your specific needs.  Try them all and see one fits you best.  Have fun!\n\nA: I recently switch from RunKeeper to RunMeter. RunMeter provides a comparison chart for RunMeter, Nike +, RunKeeper and iMapMyRun+.\nMight give you a good idea. \n\nA: I have used Sports Tracker for the last two years. Its interface is IMHO better than any other interface I have seen and its integration to the web site is rock solid.  I have used Strava, Endomondo, Runkeeper, and Mapmyride (which would also be awesome except for the live tracking bugs.\nHere's what you get from the website:\n\n\nAnd the phone app is very similiar (but skinnied down).  Here is what I really like: on the data view tab if you click on \"Lap Info\", you get everything broken down into the splits; the cool part is when you mouse over each segment it shows you on the map.\nHere is what it is missing: Live Tracking, which is being talked about on their forums and is a coming feature.\nHere is what it does have:  Route Time/Speed comparisons, it has HRM functionality (I don't use that part so I won't speak about it, it posts to Facebook with ease (and Twitter).

I have a Windows server (Win 2003) not using AD, just a simple local file server.\nMy Mac clients can log in fine to the server using SMB in the Connect To Server window on the Mac, and they can access files fine, but I can't find any way of changing their server password from their Mac.\nA few years ago, we would go into the Mac's Terminal and type:\nsmbpasswd -r <serverIPaddress> -U <username>\n\nthe server would ask for the current password, then allow the user to specify a new password. But with the last few versions of Mac OS X (Leopard & Snow Leopard?) this doesn't seem to work anymore - and now with Lion smbpasswd isn't even included!\nIs there some other technique to change the user's server password on the Mac?\n\nA: You could install Samba3 through Macports and then you'll have smbpasswd available again.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Xcode from Apple - If you download Xcode from the Mac App Store, be sure to use the Xcode preferences to subsequently download the command line tools or use the xcode-select tool to get the BSD command line tools placed in your path. MacPorts needs make, gcc and other tools from Xcode to compile the samba3 code.\n\n*Install Macports for Lion (or whatever OS X version you are using)\n\n*Run sudo port -d selfupdate - just to be up-to-date\n\n*Install Samba3 in Macports: sudo port install samba3\n\n*Setup smb.conf: sudo cp /opt/local/etc/samba3/smb.conf.sample /opt/local/etc/samba3/smb.conf\nYou are done, and now you should be able to call smbpasswd -r <serverIPaddress> -U <username> again.\n\nA: Does the server has Remote Desktop enabled? If so, your users could open an RDP connection to the server and change their password.\nYou could also use this workaround, as Lion (as you wrote) does not comes with smbpasswd.\n", "Q: No output in right channel audio headphones The right channel output cuts off and on when using headphones. The laptop speakers work fine.\nI have tried 3 known working headphones, a USB headset (connected via USB not using the audio jack), cleaning out the audio jack, nothing fixes the problem.\nThe only fix I have discovered so far is twisting and moving the cords for all the headphones I have used, only problem with that is all these headphones work fine with other devices such as a PS3 a different PC ...\n\nA: It sounds like this is an electronics issue. Its probably a single wire (the one wire that carries the right channel sound). \nThere is little that you can do about this unless you know how to solder/feel comfortable doing this repair yourself. \nI would suggest checking if your computer is still under warranty and if it is having apple take a look at it.

I have many hosts on the LAN side. I would like to configure the AEBS such that pings sent from the Internet are returned by a specific host (or not if the host is down). I have a static ip set up on the LAN side (192.168.15.2), but since icmp ping does not use a specific port (tcp or udp) I do not know how to configure port mappings. Can anyone please direct me?\nPut another way, when I ping public ip, say 64.99.80.29, I want the AEBS to pass the ping through to a given host on my LAN. Is there a way to do this?\n\nA: You can make this host the default host in your AEBS settings, also known as the DMZ host.\nNote however that everything that isn't mapped otherwise will be routed to that host, effectively making that host public from the internet. This might make this host more vulnerable for break-in attempts, be sure to lock all services down properly, and consider putting on a firewall.\nDepending on your version of the Airport Utility client, you'll find the setting here:\nAirPort Utility 6:\n\nAirPort Utility 5.6:\n\nOverall, I wouldn't recommend this approach because of the security risks on the one hand, on the other hand it doesn't look like a very reliable approach. If the host doesn't respond to pings there's no reason the host can't still be up, and if it does respond, are you sure it is the host responding, and not for example the router after a config reset?\nI'd consider polling a dedicated service like httpd which you run on the host and you forward properly from the AEBS. You could run it on a non-standard port as well. With some scripting you could also return a whole lot more detailed information about the availability of the host and it's services.\nEdit:\nSince you mentioned the host in question is an ATM, I'd be even less inclined to make it the DMZ host. Consider polling it from another host on the local network and notifying you from there.\n", "Q: Can auto glass chip repair kits fix cracked iOS device screens? Can auto glass chip repair kits such as this item repair cracked iOS device screens? If so, what should I watch out for?\n\nA: Yes, glass chip kits can be used to fix a cracked screen, but only in the following conditions:\n\n\n*\n\n*The crack does not cover any of the touch surface (only the bezel area is cracked). Anywhere resin is left on the surface of the device or seeps under the glass can block the electrical signal from your finger and prevent the device from reading a touch in that area.\n\n*The \"suction cup\" (really, a gasket) included with the kit will likely only be partially attached to the device during the repair. It must completely cover the crack, but may only extend off one edge of the device (it will not work well on a corner) and the hole in the center of the gasket must not cover the touch surface.\n\n\nThese conditions mean a repair is not likely to work with an iPhone or iPod Touch, but may work with the larger bezel on an iPad, especially as most cracks begin near the edge of a screen.\nThere is one modification to the instructions included with the kits. At the point where you press the gasket sticker to the glass to make a seal, you should also fold it down so that it seals the edge of the glass as well. This is because the metal backing on the iOS device does not completely cover the sides of the glass. You need to seal the resin within the glass and prevent it from escaping. This is why a corner repair is unlikely to work well: it is difficult or impossible to get a good seal over a corner.\nThe last step of the process requires you to leave the device in direct sunlight, preferably outdoors, to allow UV light to cure the resin. Make sure not to do this on a hot day, or the heat can damage your device. I did my own repair on the day in the low sixties and still had a temperature warning by the time the resin had cured.\nEven following these tips, you may end up with an imperfect repair. However, this should be enough to prevent or at least significantly delay the crack from spreading, and thus likely save a much more costly or extensive repair. In my case, the crack is still visible, but only if I remove the protective cover (which I never do.)\nIt's also important to note that this will void your warranty, but as the warranty doesn't cover accidental damage anyway it's a case of pick your poison.\n", "Q: Keyboard navigation of Mac OS X Finder window's search options toolbar When I'm in a Finder window and enter terms in the spotlight search box (top right of window) and then press the TAB key the search location bar appears just below and the focus moves to the first location (usually \"This Mac\") shown (as it should).  But then the focus seems locked in place and no keyboard key or combination I've found will get it to move (most of the time, that is; at times it's possible to select one of the shown locations with the keyboard and sometimes I've found it possible to tab to the Save button or Add Option [+] button and on to the options themselves but most times it just gets stuck [like now!] and I need to use the mouse).  I've been annoyed by this for years now and am running out of new key combinations to try!  Is there a way to continue with specifying the search info using the keyboard?\n\nA: The Spotlight search box is the one in the top-right of the menu bar (commandspace). The Find search box is the one I think you're talking about, within a Finder window.\nTo get focus back to the search field, hit controltab or commandf.\nAnother option is found in System Prefs > Keyboard > Shortcuts. There's a radio button near the bottom labeled \"Full Keyboard Access\". \"All Controls\" will let you tab through the other search fields without modifier keys.\nThat said, in my testing, there're some flaws. Some of the fields aren't selectable, and if you try to select one of those and then hit commandf, you can no longer tab through the other fields anymore—you have to open a new Finder window and start over.\n", "Q: Looking for an iPhone app or script that turns off “Cellular Data” when on 2G and then BACK ON when on 3G As some of you might know, 2G (GSM) or 2.5G (GSM/Edge) does not support data and calls at the same time.

Together with all the apps I have, the phone finds itself using my Internet connection when on GSM, causing calls to be dropped. I'm effectively unreachable.\nI don't want to use 2G internet, only 3G. I would like cellular data to be on only when on 3G. My phone calls take priority over Internet connectivity when on 2G.\n\nA: A left field suggestion:  \nTurn off cellular data and use a Mifi device (such as the Huawei E585) for your internet connection.\nYes this does mean another device and another SIM card, but you may be OK with that.  \nI've used this combination with an iPhone and it works really well.\nYou can leave the Mifi in your pocket, so forget it's even there\n(just remember to charge it!).\nYou get other benefits, for example it means using a laptop or tablet \"in the field\" is possible also as they'll be net-connected.\n\nA: There are no scripts for the iPhone by default and apps can't really change settings like that for you. Your only option is to jailbreak and look around Cydia for something. I would suggest look for an app or tweak that does profiles but when I was jailbroken I couldn't find anything like that.\n\nA: Found a solution... BUT IT DOES NOT WORK ON THE IPHONE 4S.\n\nAll of the areas I drive through are covered by 3G (metro Houston area), and there is no reason that my phone could not stay in 3G. After some determination & google searching I have finally found a solution. (Note that I tried the “Edge” button in SBSettings, however it simply turns off ALL data, including 3G. My solution: edit the phone’s files to stop it from ever going to Edge!\nWhat is required for the edit:\n\n\n*\n\n*A jailbroken iPhone\n\n*SSH client (such as putty)\n\n*OpenSSH installed on your iPhone (found in Cydia)\n\n*Basic knowledge of command prompt/SSH use\nWhat you will need to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*SSH to your phone logging in as “root” (password is usually alpine).\n\n*Navigate to /var/wireless/Library/Preferences/\n\n*Edit the file csidata (I use nano as my editor)\n\n*Find the line that reads “GsmRegistrationModel::fRatSelection=0×1″ & change it to GsmRegistrationModel::fRatSelection=0×2 (For those that need to know, 0×1 = 3G & Edge Data, 0×0 is Edge only, and 0×2 is 3G only)\n\n*Save the file & reboot your phone!\nYour iPhone 4 will now ONLY use the 3G network. Note, this will NOT allow you to use your data service if you are in an Edge only area (yes, they do still exist). I should also note that the entire process will need to be redone if you accidentally use SBSettings to turn your data settings on or off.\nFound here \nhttp://planet-iphones.com/2011/04/01/iphone-4-3g-lock-disable-edge/\n", "Q: iPhone log for actions like deleting text conversations? I recently found one of my long-running text conversations cleared.  I may have deleted it accidentally, but I would like to know when I did.  Is there a system log that logs information at this level?  Maybe in /var/log/ ?\n\nA: iOS 5 had no such logs that I am aware of. To my knowledge, neither does iOS 6. The system logs record more \"important\" information regarding system operation and such.\n", "Q: How can I obtain and install duplicate license keys when copying to a new Mac? I have a desktop Mac and am getting a laptop, and I intend to use the migration assistant to copy software from the existing Mac to the new one.\nI would like to obtain duplicate license keys for the software on it: Serene Screen 3, Microsoft Office, VMware Fusion, Windows XP (guest OS), Windows 7 (guest OS), and possibly others.\nI don't know that the procedure for purchasing and installing duplicate license keys will be the same but how, for the software listed, can I purchase and install a duplicate key?\n\nA: If you're using Migration Assistant, the software will stay licensed, and if you intend to wipe and repurpose the old computer it's likely you're in the clear as far as licensing goes. \nThe Windows guest OSes won't notice any change: VMware's virtual hardware won't change, so they'll be totally oblivious to the migration.\nI know from past experience that Microsoft Office works fine after Migration Assistant runs. I'm not sure about Serene Screen or VMware, but I've never had any trouble with any licensed software after Migration Assistant, including notoriously picky stuff like Photoshop or LabVIEW.\nNow, on the other hand, if you simply want to clone the software and use it on both machines, you could probably get away with using the same keys, but you should check the license to see if that's allowed. If it's not, it should be as easy as buying a new license key and just replacing the old one on one machine.\n", "Q: Time Machine says disk is full, but it was fine before! I have a 4TB external Time Machine disk. There are three internal volumes totaling 3.3TB that have been actively backed up to that external drive for a few weeks. \nI was troubleshooting something and moving a bunch of files around, so I briefly turned off Time Machine. When I turned it back on, it started backing up... but then it stopped later, saying \"there is only 707MB available on the drive, but 3.3GB is required.\" \nIt's almost as if it refuses to overwrite the old backups. It wants to start an entirely new backup or something. How can I make it pick up where it left off without having to delete that entire backup and start anew? I don't like deleting backups!\n\nA: Since you state that you have three internal volumes, I am going to assume that when you were:\n\n\"troubleshooting something and moving a bunch of files around\"\n\nthat you moved files between volumes. Time Machine will want to make a backup copy of a duplicate file that is moved/copied to a different volume. It isn't smart enough to notice that it already has a backup copy of the file(s) when they existed on another volume.\nIt's possible that if you moved a bunch of stuff around while Time Machine was off that it is having trouble reconciling all the changes and it's being compounded by disk drives that are on the full size (as stated before, I agree with the 20% free space threshold.)\nExcluding some files from the Time Machine options or using the Time Machine app to delete some old files might help.\nThis is quoted from http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1427\n\nYou can also enter the Time Machine restore interface and find files that can be removed from the backup drive itself to conserve space. To do this, select the file(s) and from the Action pop-up menu (gear icon) in the Time Machine Finder window choose \"Delete All Backups of...\". Be sure to only delete files you are sure you won't need or want to restore later.\n\n\nA: Sadly, the system sometimes does a bad job estimating the space needed.\nIf you are lucky, you can start adding each drive to the Time Machine Exclusion list and pick one drive with only a few folders to not be excluded (say your boot drive - exclude users).\nAlso exclude the system files and then ask for a backup. Again, if you are lucky, this lower space estimate will cause the full backup to see that most files are unchanged and then you can slowly remove things from the exclusion list to nurse your drive back to health.\nOr, you could take this as an opportunity to make a backup of your Time Machine drive to semi-permanent storage and erase it, start over.\n", "Q: Changing keyboard shortcut for cycling through windows? (Lion) I recently received a MacBook Air (Summer 2011, Lion) from work and I'm in the process of configuring it to work like my personal MBA (same model, Lion).\nI was happily setting keyboard shortcuts when I came across a rather interesting problem. On my personal MBA I use the combination ⌘+` to open a Total-Terminal window. This combination is usually used to cycle through windows, in the opposite direction of ⌘+tab.\nWhen I was attempting to set this shortcut in Total-Terminal on my new MBA I got the error:\n\nThe key combination \"Command + `\" can't be used because it's already used by the menu item \"Cycle Through Windows\".\n\nI immediately went to Keyboard -> Keyboard Shortcuts to look for the key binding but I couldn't find it (⌘+tab is also bound to \"Move focus to next window\", changing this shortcut and disabling it does not fix the problem). I kept looking and couldn't find it.\nAm I just glossing it over or is it not there? Is there any way for me to remove this keyboard shortcut? System-level shortcuts don't seem to be on the menu.\n\nA: Many applications like Terminal also have a menu item like Window > Cycle Through Windows. It stays assigned to ⌘` even if you change the shortcut in the Keyboard & Text Input preferences.\nYou could add a custom shortcut for Cycle Through Windows in the Application Shortcuts preferences, or disable it with defaults write -g NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add \"Cycle Through Windows\" nul.\nYou could also force TotalTerminal to use ⌘` by editing ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Terminal.plist directly.\n<key>ToggleVisor</key>\n<dict>\n    <key>KeyCode</key>\n    <integer>50</integer>\n    <key>Modifiers</key>\n    <integer>9437184</integer>\n</dict>\n\n", "Q: Should I buy Coda 2 on the app store or directly from Panic? I'm very interested in buying Coda 2 (a web development IDE) when it comes out on the 24th. My concern is that the App Store version will have less features than the non-App Store version. Will Apple's new sandboxing policies be likely to limit the use of an application like Coda? Is there any reason to not buy direct from the developer?\n\nA: As you can read on the FAQ page of Coda, there is indeed a difference:\n\nShould I buy from you directly, or from the Mac App Store?\nIt's largely a matter of personal preference. Please refer to the pricing FAQ above to see which way gets you the best price.\nAt the moment, there is only one difference between the two versions: the Mac App Store version will support iCloud syncing of Sites and Clips, and the direct version will not. This is a restriction imposed by Apple.\nApple often changes the conditions for Mac App Store eligibility, and it's possible we may have to modify or remove features from the Mac App Store version in the future. It's our intent to keep them as close to identical as Apple will let us.\n\nSo there you have your answer.\nSo, if you like to sync with iCloud, you should buy from the Mac App Store.\nIf you like to have a 50% discount, buy from Panic directly!\nI would go for the 50% discount. :)\n\nA: I would buy directly from Panic (and have):\n\n\n*\n\n*All the profit goes to them (no 30% Apple cut).\n\n*The App Store does not allow for upgrade pricing (discounts on upgraded licenses).\n\n\nIt is the last one that most concerns me.  I bought Cornerstone (svn client) from Zennaware directly for those reasons.  They do give upgrade pricing, so it is well worth it.  \nEdit:\nTurns out that panic does offer upgrade pricing, so thats a big point in favor of skipping the app store.\nI just keep a dedicated folder in my email (and password keeper) for the license details, in case I have to reinstall.  \n\nA: This is a nice general problem to have and shows how many options developers are trying to see what strikes the best balance for them.\nThere are some real headaches involved on the developer and back end (store side) if Apple ever allows upgrade pricing so I wouldn't make any purchase assuming that a change there will come soon or ever.\nI would always engage the developer (Panic in your case) to see what they say about the merits of a direct download and the app store model. As other answerers have pointed out - the App store places many restrictions on an application in terms of needing to be signed (for gatekeeper), not being able to run with administrator permissions, and having to live with sandboxing security constraints. On the other hand, the Mac App Store apps will be able to use iCloud document syncing exclusively, and over time more exclusive benefits may come to make those apps preferable to you.\nThe best solution I've seen is MarsEdit where you can either buy the program directly from the author's website or the store for the same price. However, in the interest of getting some bug fixes to end users before Apple can review them, the app store version of the app also enables you to run the downloaded versions of the apps without needing a separate license.\nNot all developers have done this level of interoperability so do your research before assuming you can switch back or forth. To date, I don't know of any app that has allowed previous purchasers to convert to the paid app other than by announcing a short sale period where the app is offered for a discount or for free to all who wish to buy on the App Store.\nPanic's model of pre-announcing the sale and pre-announcing the discounted prices and durations allows new users to benefit from a reduced price as well as accommodate users that may be in an \"upgrade\" scenario without being able to integrate this upgrade pricing while maintaining the full price point for non-upgraders.\nIn the end - it's about how you prefer to have your software licensed. The standard Mac App Store model is sometimes more lenient in the number of personal copies, but not as flexible for negotiating a bulk or upgrade special pricing at an arbitrary purchase time.\n\nA: i chose to buy direct but i have not yet been able to install. the email and links Panic has sent to not seem to function at all. So Im stuck sitting here while app store downloads work fine. \nEmailed support, no response. \n\nA: Well, I bought from the App Store because you may choose after paying:\nIt says in the FAQ that after buying the MAS version you can switch do the \"Direct\" version by asking it to the support. BUT YOU CAN'T DO THE OPPOSITE. \nPS - When I bought there was no 50% discount :( So you may want to consider that.\n\nA: I bought on AppStore the first day and now I really want to update to 2.0.1 (v2 is not stable), the new version is available since the 4th but not on AppStore.\nIn my opinion, this is a big problem, if one day Apple make this own code editor, this is too long to validate app!\nMore here : http://www.panic.com/blog/2012/06/update-on-coda-2-0-1-mac-app-store-version/\nEdit : now (21 th june) 2.0.1 available on AppStore\n\nA: I would buy it straight from panic. That way, when updates are released you will be able to download them immediately without having to wait for the app store to approve the purchase. \nMore importantly, more of your money will be going directly to Panic instead of Apple. More money to Panic means more time and resources they can spend making Coda 2 better. Support the developer you like, not apple. Lastly, you can check for updates everytime you use Coda through the app instead of having to load up MAS to see when updates are released or subscribing to Panic's mailing list/visiting a version site like macupdate. This opinion might be a bit biased as I hate the mac app store, but the fact that you will get updates sooner and more of the money goes directly to Panic makes it a no brainer for me but this is the beauty of a developer who offers two methods of purchasing.\n\nA: My Personal Take on it is, buy/download it directly. Its always nice to have that copy floating around for use later when its needed for whatever random reason, although you could just require it from the app store the same way. But the draw back to that is, you never know when apple is gonna say we don't want this product here anymore. Like its done with handfuls of apps in the past. \nAlso from the app store or directly I think you can use icloud regardless. I dont use icloud with coda as Ive to many sites to worry about that take up gigs upon gigs of space. but I remember when I bought Coda directly I was given the option to set it up with iCloud. \nand theres my 2 cents.. \n", "Q: AirPort Extreme wired guest access The AirPort Extreme's manual says the following:\n\nCreate a guest network with or without password protection, to provide Internet-only access to wireless devices, such as computers, iPad, iPhone, iPod touch, and Apple TV.\n\nBut is it possible to have an ethernet port on the AE that connects to this guest network, so it can go to a guest user that is out of the wireless range? (to plug into a wap)\n\nA: Unfortunately that is not possible, anyone with wired access to the AEBS has full connectivity, and also skips any other access restrictions or authentication for that matter.\nHowever, you could use an AirPort Express for example to create a second guest network. When creating tgat network, you can use the same SSID as the guest network configured on the AirPort Extreme (make sure you also use the same encryption parameters and password) and clients will transparently switch to the one with the best signal reception while moving to different locations.\n", "Q: Is there a dock available that can dock an iPhone (with bumper) The Apple dock cannot take the bumper, you need to take off the bumper.\nI need a dock for work and at work where I can just slip my phone in (bumper and all).\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Amazon sells a dock from Oriongadget which will allow you to dock an iPhone with his bumper. It will cost you $23.00.\n\n\nA: Probably, not due to the large variation possible with iPhone cases it would be difficult for a exact fit to a specific dock you would almost nead a special dock for each case out there. \nThe good news is that there is a very good compromise solution and that is a dock connector extension that will allow the iPhone and case to be raised out of the dock and clear most obstructions with most cases and iPhone / iPod docks.  Something such as the Dock Extender by SendStation should do what you want. \n\n", "Q: SQL-Coding App for iPad I'm searching for an iPad App where i can write and proceed SQL Statements.\nI want to connect to my own Server.\nAre there any Apps out there? I can only find MySQL Apps which are offering GUI-Editing of my Database.\n\nA: There are quite a few SQL clients in the App Store, PostGres, MySql, Oracle, SqlServer\nImpathic make one for just about every database such as\n\n\n*\n\n*SQL Server Mobile Database Client\nI've not used these products myself, but they are known to be limited to creating queries graphically, you can't write your own SQL.\nThe higher end versions, do allow you greater flexibility and the iPad apps are pretty good, however and this is a caveat, if you run SQL that returns lots of data, the query runs slowly since the amount of data being returned can be large and the handling of the large amount of data is limited by the iOS devices memory.  Write more concise SQL to return only the data you need and the apps run fine.\n\nA: I don't believe Apple allows such apps because they execute code.

Network Home Folders\nThe home folder is automatically synced from and to the server, which can be very convenient when a user switches computers and still has access to his files.\nThe bad side(s): I found the syncing very buggy. Somehow conflicts would arise which needed manual intervention or the home folder would no longer be synced. Also considering how easily you can use cloud services like Dropbox, Google Drive etc for the same purpose, I personally find the network home solution inferior to modern day solutions.\nRelated to the above, my users relied too heavily on it, leaving them unable to work on files they modified at home because they didn't sync properly.\nAnd finally, typically a user only works on one computer anyway. For files that should be available on the server for multiple users, you would set up network shares. Also, while the network home folder will not get mounted automatically on the client computer, it can still be made available as a network share for the user to manually put some personal files on there.\n2. Restricting user permissions\nThis might be a valid reason to do OD authentication and it sure looked like a great idea to me at first. You can extensively configure permissions for your network users and computers in the Directory Admin tool.\nThe bad side(s): in the end we work in a very small environment with not that many users (and that's typically the environment where Mac OS X servers are used anyway), and setting up all these different permissions was too much of a nuissance for me, with no added benifit.\nWhen you restrict a user, you need to make sure the extra support requests you will get because a user can't do something he needs to do at any given time, outweigh whatever mischief the user could/would do on his computer without these imposed restrictions. I personally only got support requests from the users with restricted access, users with a local admin account could do their work just fine without my intervention.\nWhen you don't need directory authentication at login\nEven if your users login to their computer with a local account, they can still authenticate to file shares seperately with their directory login (and save the credentials in their keychain). You can still use the directory to easily manage these users and their groups. I personally use the Mac OS X server for file sharing and VPN access, but when setting up a user's laptop, I just create him a local admin account on his machine.\n", "Q: How to close application completely when clicking red button on any app? I'm a long time windows/Ubutnu user who have recently migrated to Mac OS X and running 10.7.4. One thing which i'm unable to get used to is that  while the red button closes a window, the program will remain open until you quit the application using the Menu Bar. One option to bypass it is use the key combination Command+Q but by doing that all the instances of that program opens up the next time I open that application. Is there a way out?\n\nA: You can't close the application by clicking on the red button, as you said it is meant to close the window...\nUsing cmd-q is not a bypass but the shortcut to close the application. And the windows are not instances of the application, they are in the same instance...\nWhat bothers you is the \"resume\" functionality that restores the state of an application -- e.g. all open windows -- when you restart it.\nLook here or here to see how you can tune or disable this \"resume\" feature.\n\nA: What you need is RedQuits.

Please Help.\n\nA: To isolate the issue, you can place the device in Airplane Mode and perform a normal slide to shutdown.\nWhen the device reboots, you will have a controlled platform to test. Third party apps will not run until you launch them and Apple's sync services will be  prevented from downloading new data and potentially triggering a memory error.\nYou will quickly see if it's the OS that is complaining or some app in the background as you run things offline.\nThis is a fairly obscure error, so you'll want to check that there's some space on the filesystem when you restart the phone. Feel free to edit your question with more details if this alone doesn't resolve the issue for you.\nI'd recommend making 500 MB of free space by deleting un-needed apps with no data to back up or deleting some songs if you have no apps to space. Some programs need more room to run, and you might even have several gigs free so it's some other cause that results in the dialog message. In that case, you'll have to pay attention and start things one by one to track down the process that is placing that error on your device.\nAlso - review the backup article below to be sure you understand what is backed up and what might be lost when you restore things.

The copy to itunes/media setting is enabled. \nDoes that mean after the music is copied I can delete the original? So all it needs is the music files it copies into home > music > itunes > itunesmedia > music. Or are they still used?\n\nA: Yes - unless there is something wrong with iTunes and it didn't copy the song, you can delete these second copies of songs.\nI would use spotlight to check before you delete things until you gain confidence that the copy is working as designed. In the long run, it will be faster to let iTunes move the files so you don't need to clean things up.\nAlso, a good Time Machine backup can help if you accidentally delete too much.\n", "Q: iOS Updating: OTA vs iTunes Is there a difference between updating iOS via OTA or iTunes? I have done some pretty good mucking around with my iPhone 4S's filesystem (e.g. deleting my Music folder). I have an inkling that the iTunes update is more thorough, and will reformat my entire filesystem, while I'm not so sure about the OTA update. \nDoes anyone have any in-depth knowledge they'd like to share on the matter?\nEdit: I'll be going from 5.0.1 to 5.1.1\n\nA: As @bmike notes, the processes are similar for OTA or iTunes. The OTA updates supply the deltas while the iTunes updates the whole build. The iTunes update also seems to run faster from my experience (purely anecdotal). \nOne big difference from my standpoint is the mandatory backup that occurs if you back up over iTunes - you can also transfer purchases and do any other management activities before the update. You can backup via Wifi with the OTA method as well, but that's a separate step that you'll need to explicitly kick off.\n\nA: My understanding is that the update process is the same for both methods.\nWith the exceptions that iTunes downloads a several hundred megabyte IPSW file that can be used to do a more complete \"restore\" if needed.  It is the \"restore\" that will reformat the filesystem etc.\n\nA: Yes at first approximation they are the same, but the mechanism of the update is different since one can be a delta and self-applied update and the other installs a complete build rather than patching the OS.\nDigging deeper, the OTA update implies the OS and device is working properly, so Finder or iTunes is a good bet if you really want to ensure the update goes well or want to put the device into recovery mode to ensure the new OS and only the new OS is written. Obviously, if the device is having problems, you may opt for a computer to control the update rather than hoping the device stages, installs and executed cleanup of the patch properly.\nAssuming your device is working well, you can safely update OTA and in many cases - the download is a delta update that is smaller than the entire image if you are doing an update that isn't a major version (4.0 or 5.0 which started the OTA capabilities and presumably 6.0 when it ships).\nUsing Finder or iTunes also gives you a chance to transfer purchases and reduce the number of apps you will have to re-download after a major update. Again, not an issue on incremental updates like 5.1.1 update from 5.1.\n\n*\n\n*iOS version history on wikipedia\n\n*About iOS 5.1.1\nIn practice, this even has been called out as a deciding factor for the jailbreak that was first released for iOS 7 where the notes said the exploit won't work against an OTA iOS 7 device, and only against a cleanly restored device. I don't know if that has to do with the signing key or an actual difference in the two images, but it shows that the processes are indeed different in some respects.\n\nA: If you want to jailbreak later like for ios 7.1.4 or lower so update it on itunes not OTA\n", "Q: Graphics capabilities of MacBook Pro? I'm considering purchasing a MacBook Pro, but a major issue for me is whether or not it has the computing power to support graphics-intensive applications. Specifically, the two most graphically intense applications I'd be doing are Final Cut Pro video editing (approx. 60 min vids) and playing Diablo 3. Since D3 is the more graphically challenging player here, I'll use it as the baseline. My current MacBook Pro (either 2009 or 2010) struggles with this game to be playable, so I'm a bit skeptical to trust the minimum system requirements for D3 since my current machine meets them:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Mac OS X 10.6.8, 10.7.x, or newer\n  \n*Intel Core 2 Duo (or better)\n  \n*NVIDIA GeForce 8600M GT or ATI Radeon HD 2600 (or better)\n  \n*2 GB RAM\n  \n*12 GB Available Disk Space\n  \n*DVD-ROM drive\n  \n*Video Settings reaching minimum resolution of 1024x768\n  \n\nGetting the obvious out of the way, I can see by looking at MacBook Pro specs comparison that I need to have at the very minimum a 15\" or 17\" model, since the 13\" does not have a separate high-performance graphics card. Additionally, I know that the 15\" and 17\" both have plenty of RAM and CPU power. The problem is, I have no idea where the MacBook's AMD Radeon HD 6750M/6770M stand against the technical specs.\nWould the MacBook Pro be able to reasonably support these use cases (Final Cut Pro and Diablo 3)? I define \"reasonably\" as: no choppy frame rate, responsive interaction, and not having to be set the game at the absolute minimum specs just to play (also, the computer not becoming as hot as the sun would be a bonus, but not a deal-breaker).\n\nA: I don't have a recent MBP, but in my experience the applications should run well. \nFor games, I suggest to look at youtube videos. For example, Diablo 3 Beta Gameplay MacBook Pro.\nYou can find a good comparison of the graphics chips here:\nApple 15-inch MacBook Pro (Late 2011) Review\nIf you have time, I would wait about one month (until June/July 2012); the chances for new MacBook Pros being released are high.\n\nA: The current MBP's have similar benchmark scores and performance to my 27\" iMac from late 2010.  Diablo 3 runs great, with only the shadows turned down a bit.\nBottom line is that if you can wait, it's always worth it to get the next model, assuming it is soon.  If you need a computer today, the current MBP's are great.  I've got a late 2011 15\" MBP at work and it's a workhorse.  And since graphics are your big concern, go for the best discrete GPU.\n\nA: There are many, many graphics card benchmark lists.  Here's one that shows the Radeon 6750M to be about 2.5 times faster than the GeForce 8600M:\nhttp://novabench.com/gpuchart.php?a=1\nOf course every benchmark is different, but you can be assured that the video card in the 15 and 17 inch MBPs will run this game well.\nUse google to find other benchmarks if you'd like more points of data:\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=compare+6750M+8600M\n", "Q: Why does my Terminal command line screw up like this?

Specifically, I'd expect it's related to incorrect escape sequences.  \nHere is a link with more information.  It's hard to tell exactly without seeing what your PS1 is set to.\n", "Q: Multi user network share and resource forks I have a scenario where multiple clients access the same NFS share, where they work with inDesign, Photoshop and such. They have problems with files and dirs going read-only (not in Terminal, though), and I have found the reason to be locks/extended attributes/resource forks. Over samba, it seem to work fine for them all, although they're not happy with the speed we've managed to squeeze out of the samba setup.\nHow do you manage scenarios like this? What are my options? Would a OS X NFS server not have the clients suffering from the same problem?\nLinux 2.6 NFS, tried mounting with \"nonamedattr\", \"noacl\" etc. Server forces uid and gid. Clients are OS X 10.6.\nEdit:\nAdobe.com states exactly the same problems (locks, long delays/pausing, intermittent by nature) as we're experiencing.\nhttp://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/kb/networks-removable-media-photoshop-cs5.html\n\nA: I've never used NFS for real file shares, but a friend recommended NFSManager for enabling NFS options on your Mac clients.\nYou could also try building netatalk to enable a native AFP share on the Linux server, which would certainly make your CS users much happier.  Adobe doesn't officially support opening and saving files over any network sharing protocols, although my users seem to have no problem when using Bridge to open directly off an OS X Server afp volume.\n", "Q: How to make a Lion install disk for a Mac Mini from a Mac Pro There are a bunch of pages out there for making a bootable Lion disk (either DVD or USB drive). However, the problem is that they all will only work on the machine they were created on - Apple is trying to be helpful by only downloading what you need for your current machine. What I need to do is to create a Lion install disk on a Mac Pro which I can use on a Mac Mini. I do not have physical access to the Mini at this time. Do I have any options? Is it possible to create a universal Lion install disk?\nThank you.\n\nA: If you have the latest \"Install Mac OS X Lion.app\" procured from the App Store, then you could use the InstallESD.dmg within that to make a universal installer (described elsewhere) -- it will have all the drivers needed for any/all Macintosh machines that meet its hardware requirements. Note if you're handy with SSH, ARD or other methods to remotely control the machine in question, the upgrade/installation could be entirely remotely.\n\nA: I have a 2008 MacPro and have successfully used the Lion installer I downloaded from the Mac App Store to install Lion on my two MacBook Pros. I believe the installer is universal. Which, if you think about it, wouldn't it have to be? It's in the Mac App Store after all. Bottom line though, I've done it and it worked for me.\n\nA: My experience doesn't match up with your claim that installers only work on the machine they were created for.\nI've used a MacBook Air to create an installer for an iMac at a time when my home internet was not working (I could easily take the Air offsite to download but not the iMac). I've also installed on a USB drive that I use as a rescue boot drive on a variety of machines. What happens on the Mini when you follow the standard procedure to create the installer using the Mac Pro? I'd be surprised if it didn't work, given my experience.\n", "Q: Show which iPads have been synced I am with a school and we have several iPads that have been synced to our iTunes account.  I do not have these iPads in my office.  Can I tell by looking in my itunes account which iPads have been synced to my iTunes account?\n\nA: Look in preferences in iTunes and list all the devices that have a backup stored on the computer. If you didn't get a backup, then it becomes much less likely to catch any information from the system logs.\nGrab yourself a copy of the iPhone configuration utility from the enterprise support site and it will log each serial number and details every time it's running and you connect a device.\nThe Apple Configurator does similar but is intended more for management than just remembering all the devices. It also only runs on Macs running 10.7.2 or later.\n", "Q: The system preference panes will not load When I open System Preferences and click on an item it says 'Loading Users & Groups' at the top of the window, but will not load the pane.\nI've tried deleting the property list file: \n /library/preferences/com.apple.systempreference.plist \n\nI also tried clearing the PRAM and booting in Safe Mode.\n\nA: Have you looked in the console? Maybe you'll find some error messages there which can narrow the problem down.\nYou can view log files in Console, located in /Applications/Utilities.\nHave you tried to check (and maybe repair) the file rights. You can do this with disk utility.\nAbout Disk Utility's Repair Disk Permissions feature\n\nA: Boot in single user mode (Hold down SHIFT key right after hitting the power button until the Apple Logo appears), Login, Launch System Preferences, Load the Preferences Pane that is not working, Restart Mac OS X.  That worked for me when nothing else did.\n\nA: Sometimes it's just enough to quit the System Preferences app. Check if the process was ended well, i.e. use Activity Monitor (also to quit \"System Preferences\" app). In my recent case it was not necessary to force quit, just select the process and quit was enough.\nAlternatively Force Quit if System Preferences is open and in the Doc, just do a secondary click on the System Preferences icon, hit [alt] key \"Quit\" will change got \"Force Quit\" and click that.\nAfter restarting the app the preference pane (in my case time machine pane) could be loaded as expected.\nLately it happened, that the described method didn't work, after force quit I still couldn't open the preference pane. I found that waiting a little (few minutes) before reopening helped, because when I was not able to reopen the pane I searched for a different solution, coming back to System Preferences – without doing anything else – was able to open the desired pane.\n\nA: What I've done is just simply open every pane from the left upper corner to the right lower corner. After that, the \"security and privacy\" pane resume normal. \nNo need for even a reboot. \n\nA: Restart, Hold Shift key right after your screen shut down to run safe mode, go to display preferences again to check if is can be opened, and then restart -> Done, I tried and it worked on OS 10.12.3. \np/s: I found out this solution of Claeton in this post.

I'm using a mini DisplayPort adapter and an HDMI cable to connect to an Asus VH232H monitor.  The problem is that using the native resolution (1920x1080) in Windows results in a black band appearing around the edges of the screen.  I know a lot of people seem to have run into this in the past. How do I actually fix it? \nSome additional info:\n\n\n*\n\n*My research tells me I need to adjust an \"overscan\" setting, but can find no way to do this with the display drivers provided by Apple.\n\n*I've seen many references to people fixing the problem by installing AMD's Catalyst Control Center, which does have an 'overscan' or 'scaling' option you can adjust.  However, because I'm using a MacBook Pro, none of the AMD install packages I've tried will actually install the Control Center on my machine.\n\n\nA: Try adjusting the overscan settings on the TV. There might be a \"monitor\" or \"computer\" or \"pixel\" or some other strangely named setting that (essentially) turns off the TV's built-in overscan allowances.\n", "Q: How to migrate iPhone (particularly Calendar) to a new Lion Mac from Snow Leopard My main computer is running Snow Leopard, so I am not using any iCloud syncing. It needs to stay on Snow Leopard because of several apps I'm still using that do not work under Lion. \nMy iPhone and iPad sync to this main computer.   \nI also have a laptop running Lion, and it does not have my iCal, Notes, Mail, or Address Book entries on it. \nI'm not going to have access to my main Mac for about a month.  I don't care a lot about the music in my iTunes library as I plan to leave it on the SL Mac because it has much more disk space, and I can live without it for a month.\nHowever, I need my calendar, notes, and contacts.  In particular, my calendar on my main computer has reminders and to-dos years into the future for legal and regulatory deadlines as well as historical records of when I made such filings, so I have to preserve that. Plus I want day-to-day usage of the calendar to still work.  \nThe change is now I want calendar, contacts, notes, and iTunes all to be hosted on my Lion laptop.  So what's the best way to move the data from my SL Mac to my Lion laptop and get the iPhone and iPad to sync to the laptop?  Particularly since I'm going to want to move them back to the Snow Leopard Mac later. \nI've read a lot of articles on how to move the iTunes library over, but because it is so big, I'd prefer not to move over the music.  In any case, just moving the iTunes library is not sufficient.  How do I move the other data over without wiping my laptop or my iPhone?\n\nA: I understand you want your iTunes library to be hosted on your main machine but not on your Lion machine. Bit of confused there.\nFIRST OF ALL. Back-up all of your calendar, address book, etc. data before you proceed for any inconveniences that may happen.\nAnyway. For migrating your calendar, contacts, notes & etc. :\n\n\n*\n\n*use the export features of those apps storing them on Snow Leopard machine and then import them to your Lion machine,\n\n*reset address book & calendar on your iOS devices by connecting them to your Snow Leopard machine and un-checking syncing of those data and finally syncing them for changes to take effect,\n\n*setup iCloud on Lion and also on your iPhone and iPad so that you can sync those information with your iPhone and iPad.\n\n\nNOTE: don't sync them through iTunes when you are on Lion because if you do so your iPhone and iPad will be wiped and then re-synced as you've said because those devices can be synced with only one iTunes library at a time. Since you won't be taking your musics with you, those will be gone if you sync through iTunes. Just use iCloud. But this also means that you won't be able to sync music and any other kind of media to your iPhone and iPad until you return to your Snow Leopard machine.\nAfter your return then you should:\n - export those up-to-date calendar, address book, etc. info. on Lion,\n - import them to your SL,\n - remove iCloud on everything,\n - return back to old fashioned iTunes syncing.\nI know it's a bit of a hassle but it's your only option as far as I can see right now if you don't want to move your iTunes library to your Lion machine.\nBUT if you choose to move your iTunes Library as well then you may follow Apple's guides here to do so. And be careful when you're migrating. Don't just copy&paste since iTunes' structure is complicated.\nIf you migrate then you can sync your calendar, address book, etc. through iTunes. But you gonna have to export&import those to your Lion machine as well. So the first option stands out.\nIf you've any other questions, just let me know.\n", "Q: Why is it that my Mac would rather swap than clear inactive memory? Why is it that my Mac (running 10.8 Mountain Lion) would rather swap than clear inactive memory? I know people say that the Mac OS manages itself and whatever, but there is a serious performance dip when my MacBook starts swapping out, even though it would have over 1.5 GB of inactive memory that isn't being cleared out. I have a launcher for the purge command in my dock - thats how severe it is!\n\nNote the 2.21 GB of inactive and the 127.1 MB of swap, which, through the use of all the programs in my workflow, (Photoshop + Illustrator + Dreamweaver + Publisher etc.) will grow rapidly unless I use the purge command, saving my computer from a slaughter fest of beach balls.\n\nA: I recently answered a question like yours, so thought I'd restate the major points for you, in case this is still a problem.\nMac OS X allocates and uses RAM differently than most versions of MS Windows and can be confusing at times. Microsoft originally built Windows to keep as much memory free as possible. Apple's memory model follows a guideline that empty RAM is a wasted resource that could be better utilized to enhance performance.\nHere is a quick and somewhat simplistic breakdown of how your RAM is currently being used:\n\n\n*\n\n*Wired: memory reserved and used by the operating system\n\n*Active: memory used by currently running programs\n\n*Inactive: memory used by programs you previously ran since your last reboot, but have since quit. Most people use a few programs repetitively all the time and may switch between them by quitting one program and then launching another. Rather than releasing the memory to be \"free\", the inactive programs are cached and ready to run again. Some or all of this memory will be combined with Free memory as needed by the system or programs. OS X at times seems reluctant to release inactive memory.\n\n*Free: memory as of yet unused since the last boot.\n\n*Used: total of wired, active and inactive.\n\n\nThe VM statistics are reset every time you reboot.\nIf your MacBook is capable of being upgraded beyond 4GB RAM, I'd definitely invest in a pair of 4GB SO-DIMMs for a total of 8GB installed. One other point to keep in mind concerning your MacBook is that typical notebook hard drives are slower than many of their desktop counterparts. I replaced my first generation unibody MacBook Pro's hard drive with a 256GB SSD. Performance incomparable with any \"modern\" MacBook Pro. The increase from hard drive to SSD was quite a bit more noticeable than my upgrade from 4GB to 8GB of RAM.\n", "Q: Can you resize a Keynote slide without resizing text? I'm currently using Keynote to layout a web design, but I've made my slide too short. When I try to resize my slide, all the text increases in size, destroying my layout.\nSo my question is, is there a way to resize my slide without resizing the text?\n\nA: Keynote files are zipped XML files. I created some little Apple Script to resize keynote files.\nSome caveats:\n\n*\n\n*It always resizes all slides, no selection possible. Maybe you can export the slides you want to resize to another file and only resize this, afterwards merging it back.\n\n*It requires xsltproc which is not included in Mac OS X by default.

Please save your document as a Keynote '09 document, as the script is not (yet) able to deal with the new format.\n\nThough I don't believe the script could mess anything up, please do a backup before applying it!\nkeyresize now resides on github.\n\nA: *\n\n*Select all the stuff on the page.\n\n*Cut it. \n\n*Change the doc size. \n\n*Paste it back. \n\n\nText comes in just like it was.\n", "Q: Password not working Today, out of the blue, my iPhone kept poping up a message that said my password was incorrect for my email account.

But the message kept popping up.  \nI tried to go my Apple password and have a link sent by email to change my password. But no email ever arrived. Any suggestions?\n\nA: Try to rule out the causes... Go to your inlog page of your mail account on your pc and try with your password. If you can access the mailbox, then you know it's your iPhone. If you can't, it's you.\nIf you can access your mailbox on the web, then make sure you've configured your mail-account correctly. You can always try Google to search for a setup for your e-mail client. For example \"How to configure hotmail with iPhone\", or so.\nAnd as a last resort, you can delete your mailbox and re-add it. Your iPhone will automatically rebuild your inbox, so nothing will be lost.\n\nIf you're using a POP-account (like hotmail), I could recommend an IMAP-account (like GMail).\n", "Q: How can I stop my iMac's remote management connection from defaulting to wifi?

Is there any way to force the iMac to connect to my Mac Mini via ethernet instead of wifi when wifi is enabled on the Mac Mini? \n\nA: In System Prefereces > Network set Ethernet above Wifi. That should do the trick.\n\nA: Use the System Preferences > Network > Action (cog) menu > Set Service Order to alter the default network.\nYou can change the Service Order of your network connections.

Automatic hourly backups probably won't work (but can be fired off manually) and navigating through your Time Machine snapshots in the Time Machine GUI is very flaky and problematic. \nSpending the whopping $50 however changes your Mac into a full fledged Time Machine server, and then it will act reliably. This is one of several features that make this \"upgrade\" a no brainer, in my opinion.\n", "Q: Mac laptop to TV issue: mirror display doesn't work? I can get the laptop display onto the screen but when I click Mirror Display it doesn't work and loses the signal. I have a MacBook Pro and the TV is a Samsung. I'm connecting via an HDMI cable. Any ideas? After all the videos I have watched when I click mirror display it should work.\n\nA: It seems to me that the frequency you have your laptop configured at is not supported by your TV.\nWhen using mirror displays, it usually mirrors your main screen (resolution & frequency). Your main screen would be the one where you have the Dock and Menu bar.\nCan I ask why would you want to mirror display on your TV? Is this for watching videos?\nIf so, I would recommend you to do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect your HDMI cable\n\n*Click on detect displays, disable mirroring\n\n*Install VLC player\n\n\nWith VLC you can use your second screen on full screen mode without the need of mirroring.\n\nA: You are definitely using an adapter for the Mini DisplayPort in your MBP so check the adapter for functioning or use a known good adapter to test. I have done what you want to do many times even with mid 2010 laptops so I'm sure your MBP can handle HDTV resolutions just fine, either 720 or 1080.\nTry making sure your TV is set to one of those two resolutions, and not set to 480p.\nIf all else fails you can try a Mini DisplayPort to VGA adapter if your TV has a VGA input (usually called \"PC\") on HDTV's. You won't have audio from the TV but you'll still get full resolution. Without knowing your specific model of MBP you probably aren't getting audio anyway through the HDMI adapter.\nTell us what you are seeing in the Display preference pane in System Preferences.\n\nA: I live in the UK and the solution to mirroring my (new) macbook to my TV (Panasonic) via an HDMI cable (with a USB C) connector was to change the frequency - Hz refresh rate in macbook preferences to 50Hz (the default was 60hz which I guess works in the USA).\n", "Q: iPod touch (iOS4) doesn't sync AddressBook after moving to iCloud I moved from MobileMe to iCloud.

Google's instructions for this are fine, so I won't repeat them here. If you sync your Mac/PC to the GMail contacts as well, this will give you similar functionality to iCloud, even on iOS4.\n", "Q: How can I rename the columns in Numbers? I'm working with a language file, with columns for different languages. My first row is the language names. \n\nIs it possible to have the \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", etc as language names instead. That way, when I scroll I can still identify each column.\n\nA: As often happens, a couple of minutes after posting the question, I found a way to do this. \nIn the Inspector, (opt-cmd-i), in the Table Inspector tab click on the middle button of Headers and Footers. Select the option Freeze Header Rows and the first row will stick to the top.\n\n\nA: I would think it would be better to freeze the first row and by so, it will be visible all over the document when you scroll. But unfortunately, this function isn't wasn't available in Numbers.\nYou might try editing the document in Print View. The columns and rows are repeated as you scroll, which allows you to see what column/row you are on. Numbers does allow editing in print view. It's not exactly what you are looking for, but it's a solution.\nEdit: And as you've answered your own question, it looks like this function is available at this moment.\n", "Q: How to press Control key on Mac I cannot seem to find out how to hit the ctrl key on a Mac. When I open a terminal and I want to exit an editor such as nano as I cannot since I don't know how to exit and save. How would I do this? I am using OS X 10.5.\n\nA: Different keyboard layouts have used different labels on the CTRL or Control key. It might be marked control or CTRL or even ^. Additionally, the behavior of that key can be easily reassigned using System Preferences, which means that the control key on your keyboard could be remapped to do something else (or nothing); if you are not getting results when you post, that could be the problem.\n\nI've created an instructional video on how to press the control key on a mid-2011 MacBook Air.\n\nA: When working in the editor nano (within Terminal) your ctrl key\ncombinations are listed at the bottom of said terminal window.\n\nNOTE: The following key combinations consist of only letters.\n\nThe key combinations you are searching for are:\nctrl + o =  Save (Will provide a prompt to chose name to save as)\nctrl + x = Exit\nOther popular combinations while on the standard nano editor are:\nctrl + g = Get Help\nctrl + r = Read file (Insert file from specific location)\nctrl + k = Cut Text (Will cut the entire line of text that your cursor is on)\nctrl + w = Where Is (Search current nano page)\nctrl + c = Current Position (Locates the current position your cursor is on and reports the line column and character)\n\nA: I understand the problem. For me, my Mac mapped the control key to Mission Control. Open up Mission Control in Settings, and disable the control key. That's it. The Control key will work now.\n\nA: Have you ever done a ^c to exit a program? It's the same key that the caret stands for. On my keyboard it is on the bottom left of the keyboard. CTRL stands for control, which is what is written on the key. If that doesn't work, try checking the System Preferences to see if it is enabled.\n", "Q: iPhone, iCloud and Mail syncing problem The Situation\nI work in an IT department for a law/property/ifa firm and we have iPhones rolled out to many of the important staff members. It is a UK firm, and as well as the permanent staff we also have consultants who may work for many companies come in who also get iPhones. We have a profile setup that allows our firm's mail and contacts to be synced with the phone. We also prohibit the use of iCloud as using it will breach the Data Protection Act as the iCloud severs are US based. The consultants who come in also have mail from other addresses they use to go to the phone. Our configuration we place on the phones disables the use of iCloud.\nThe Problem\nOne consultant uses a mobileme address as their email outside of the firm and needs their mail on the iPhone. The problem here is that mobileme is now part of iCloud, which as we mentioned we cannot use due to the configuration placed on the phones and will not use as the information we handle is incredibly sensitive and while someone may not bother taking legal action with a single consultant over using iCloud they would most certainly try their hand at taking it with a firm of our size considering we know about and acknowledge that using iCloud breaks the Data Protection Act. I have searched all over to see if it is possible to have the consultants email sync with the phone without using iCloud and the only ray of light I saw was that you can use mobileme email on devices that don't have the system requirements for iCloud.\nThe Question\nIs it possible to have mobileme email addresses sync without using iCloud on the iPhone? Is there a better way in going about it?\n\nA: I don't know the first thing about what the UK Data Protection Act covers, but you can clearly see in the iCloud and Mail, Contacts, Calendars settings that you can slide off Mail yet still slide on the other categories of data.\nContacts (addresses), Calendars, Reminders, Notes.\nIf it's OK to store that sort of information, then your consultant can continue to use Mobile Me / iCloud to put that information in the cloud. Again, you are trusting them to not store actual \"protected data\" inside an appointment as an attachment (mail message) as well as not enable the mail slider.\nYou might just decide to require them to use a hosted mail and account that complies with your data storage requirements. Period, full stop. Sometimes that is the cost of doing business as a professional. \nAlso - you can bank fairly certainly that Apple won't change the drop dead date to finish MobileMe since it's been published for about 13 months now.\nhttp://www.apple.com/mobileme/transition.html\nAll MobileMe mail will shut off on June 30th, 2012 - presumably pacific time in the US.\n", "Q: How to find out which file triggered an action from spotlight I've created an applescript application (in automator) to open ssh urls. The application is bound to the ssh:// url.\nI've got a lot of user@host.inetloc files and search these in spotlight. Selecting the file from spotlight opens the associated application, but i cannot figure out what the filename is which triggered the opening of the application.\nIt works if i add the \"get selected finder items\" action and open the .inetloc file from the finder.\nI've searched the net and the applescript reference, but it's just too specific.\n\nA: Would something like this work for you:\non run argv\n    set theFile to (item 1 of argv)\n    set theFilePath to quoted form of POSIX path of theFile \n    -- your script using the parameters follows\nend run\n\nYou could skip the first line and just pull off the path if you don't need to use the file itself later in the script.\nAlso, you'll really want to get ASObjC Runner to parse files and paths easily for 10.9 and older or BridgePlus for newer os. \n", "Q: Control System 4 with just a keyboard? Is there a reference of keyboard shortcuts for System 4, so I can use a Macintosh SE with a keyboard and no mouse?\nI found a Macintosh SE and a keyboard on the street several years ago. It didn't have any cables, so the only thing I could do with the Mac was use another power cable and turn it on. Yesterday, my ADB cable arrived, so I can use the keyboard, but I still don't have a compatible mouse. According to my Googling, the Macintosh SE runs System 4 and Finder 5.2. \nIs there a reference of keyboard shortcuts for System 4, so I can play around with the system?\n\nA: While it is reasonably possible to use a classic Mac without a keyboard, using one without a mouse requires a System software disk with the Easy Access control panel installed.\nWith Easy Access installed, you can press Command-Shift-Clear to toggle Mouse Keys at which point your numeric keypad can be used to control the mouse cursor and the computer will be frustrating, but functional.\nA limited number of shortcuts are still documented on Apple's site in Archived Technical Note 28141. Also, you can select icons in open windows by typing the first letters of the icon's name (for example, 'sys' will select \"System Folder\"), followed by Command-O to open.\n\nA: As far as I know, there aren't enough keyboard shortcuts (apart from your copy and paste, etc.) that'd allow you to play with the OS too much.\nI also couldn't find a reference - things like this are surprisingly scarce.\nI did find a Macintosh ADB mouse from here though - if you're alright with eBay or things like that.\n", "Q: Is the iPhone 4 antenna problem fixed in the iPhone 4S Is the iPhone 4 antenna problem fixed in the iPhone 4S?\nWas it secretly fixed for all new models or just the iPhone 4S or none?\n\nA: I think so. Since Apple placed an extra antenna (now they are two) in the iPhone and they redesigned the whole antenna system (an extra receiver in the frame inter alia). \n\nAnd according to the movies in this blogpost, it seems like the new system did fix the so-called antennagate! They compared the iPhone 4S reception with an iPhone 4 which is suffering from the antennagate.\nAccording to Apple itself, the system...\n\nIntelligently switches between two antennas to transmit and receive\n\n", "Q: Unable to boot into 10.4 installation disc I'm attempting to fix my friends old iMac G5 running OSX 10.4. There are a bunch of updates she needs, but she doesn't know her admin password. I'm attempting to reset it with her 10.4 install disc, but when I attempt to boot into it, the machine just runs and runs and runs and never seems to make it to the installation screen. I thought maybe it was the disc, so I downloaded an ISO of 10.4 and tried to boot into that, but that didn't help either. OSX seems to recognize the discs when I view it's contents in the folders, but booting into them just don't seem to work. Should I try booting from a USB version?\nI wanted to show her what Ubuntu might look like (so she doesn't have to pay $200 for Leopard, the last version of OSX her iMac will support), but booting into that LiveCD fails too.\n\nA: Most PowerMacs can't boot off of USB drives natively. They can boot off of a FireWire drive, however. If you have an external FireWire hard disk handy, you could try using Disk Utility to clone the 10.4 boot disk onto the drive and booting off of that. There is also (supposedly) a way to make the system boot off of an external USB disk, but it involves editing an nvram variable. This article explains how to do that.\n", "Q: Word 2011: Keyboard shortcuts for accepting/rejecting a tracked change AND moving to the next change Is there such a built-in shortcut for doing such action pairs? (e.g. accept+move to next, using a single shortcut)\nIf not, how can I define such a custom shortcut?\n\nA: This is actually quite easy to do, once you know where to look. (Unfortunately for me I didn't know about this until my thesis was done. Not that I'm bitter or anything.)\n1) In MSWord, go to the Tools Menu and then choose \"Customize Keyboard\"\n\n2) Under \"Categories\" choose \"All Commands\" and then look for \"AcceptChangesAndAdvance\". Select it, then click in the box next to \"Press new keyboard shortcut\" as shown here:\n\n3) Enter an unused keyboard combination (I chose ⌘ + ⌥ + Y for \"Yes I want this change\"). Note that the \"Assign\" button is now activated. Use it. Then click \"OK\".\n\nThat should be all you need to do.\n\nA: There are good help pages direct in the application or online.\nWord keyboard shortcuts\nThere are some for reviewing documents, but not for what you search.\nBut you should create your own: Create or delete a keyboard shortcut\n\nA: *\n\n*Save the document as Word 98/2000 .doc format\n\n*Open in Word 98\n\n*Tools/track changes/accept or reject changes\n\n*Find next\n\n*Either click accept or reject, which will do so and automatically find next, or \"find next\" which will leave the tracked change and find next\n\n\nA: In office 2007 you can set a custom shortkey at \"File -> Options -> Customize Ribbon\"\nThere set a nice key, like ctrl-shift-Arrow :)\n", "Q: Automate PDF actions To improve my paperless workflow, I'm looking to achieve the following, potentially using automator / applescript. I need to be able to run it using Hazel, or as a folder action (not run manually):\n1) Split a multi-page scanned & OCR'ed PDF into it's constituent pages, each in an individual file. Each file must contain the image and associated text.\n2) Append a single PDF page to an existing multi-page PDF.\nI've got a kind of working solution to the first item - create an automator workflow using the action that splits a PDF into odd and even pages, repeated several times. In my case I repeated it 6 times which produces 64 pages in the end, although most of them are blank and can be trashed based on their size. This takes a while to run though, so I'd like to know if there is a more streamlined way of accomplishing this.\nThe second one I've got nothing approaching a solution so far.\n\nA: The answer to your second question might lead you directly to a solution to the first.\nYou'll want a tool that edits PDF files to append docments (or conversely, split them up). I use PDFPen for the job, but there are others that do less but might meet your needs.\nHere is an article on using Hazel to script PDFPen as well as documentation on how PDFPen is scriptable in general. There is a Pro version of the app for a higher cost, so you might see if you need the extra features, but the normal version seems to meet your needs well enough.\nMany helpful PDFPen example scripts can be found after you install the software in your user library: \n~/Library/Application Support/PDFpen/Scripts\n\nOpening them in the AppleScript Editor is a great way to learn more.\n\nA: PDFPen example scripts can be found here: ~/Library/Application Support/PDFpen/Scripts. Opening them in the AppleScript Editor gives me a lot of ideas.\n", "Q: Reading PDFs on iPad without iTunes syncing I am trying to read for an exam and I want to download exercises to my iPad. I have downloaded the exercises from here. I have no Mac laptop or desktop computer. I am tired of clicking every pdf one-by-one. \nTrial 1: I bought the GoodReader app for iPad, but its developer said that I need a Mac computer (or something with iTunes) to download the folder like above. I have no Mac computer.\nTrial 2: I am now trying things with iBooks software on my iPad:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I easily get them to iBooks without Mac?\n\n*How can I edit iBooks (iPad) directory on Ubuntu?\n\n*Is this easier with Amazon Kindle rather than with iPad?\nI am not much interested in how you really get the PDFs from such directory structure to the iPad or other device, I am just trying to get more paperless because my printer is broken and not comfortable to read just with laptop.\nPerhaps related:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I study efficiently and paperlessly?\n\nA: Put your PDFs in a folder structure on your computer, in DropBox, or on a computer somewhere online that you have FTP or SCP access to.\nThen, in GoodReader, sync that folder. You can do it locally over WiFi and SCP or WebDav, remotely over SCP, or through DropBox.\nOnce the PDFs are in GoodReader, you can read them offline, mark them up, etc. If you set up bi-directional syncing, then when you are back online you can sync your notes back to your laptop.\n\nA: While you can't just download the whole directory into GoodReader you can still enter each individual URL and load that.\nOr more easily, browse into the directory with Safari, open each PDF and from within the PDF select \"Open in...\" to open and save it in GoodReader.\nOr email them to a mail account configured on the iPad and open them from there.\n\nA: I think @mankoff has the right answer here, and the OP may be struggling with an implementation detail. The solution is going to be Goodreader in some way or another.\nWhen I want to move a lot of files between my computer and Goodreader, I use the \"WiFi-transfer\" mode in Goodreader. In my hands, this only works with an ad-hoc local network, but that's pretty simple to start. I can then mount my iPad's Goodreader folder onto using a desktop computer, and then interact with the iPad just as with any server's filesystem.\nThis is, for me, easier than Dropbox when I have a lot of local PDFs I want to transfer. I also think it's a very platform-neutral approach.\nThe other way to do it, of course, is to run a little FTP server on your Ubuntu machine, and serve your own files to Goodreader from there. Or, even better, get FTP access to the server you linked to originally, at koti.kapsi.fi.\n\nA: Well to copy a PDF file to GoodReader, just download iTunes for Windows and install it. After installation, open iTunes and connect you iPad to your computer you'll find your iPad listed in iTunes. Just click on it and your iPad detail will be listed on the main windows. Click on app tab can scroll to the bottom of the page. You will find the GoodReader directory. Drag and drop your files there and you will find it on your iPad. \n\nA: If you download all the PDFs on your Windows/Mac/Linux/whatever machine and email them to an account you get in Mail on the iPad, you can open the attachments in Mail and it will give you the option to open the messages in GoodReader or iBooks. These apps should then save the files so you only need to send them once.\n", "Q: Can the boot drive select screen be used with a PC video card? Since installing an unsupported video card typically means you don't get a boot screen on OS X, does that also preclude selecting boot drives on startup by holding down the option key?\nI'm looking at getting a Radeon 6870 for a MacPro3,1 for use on OS X Lion. I've filled all the drive bays and sometimes have different OSs installed. I'd also like to know if I'm going to loose access to the recovery drive if I happen to need it.\nIf unsupported cards do prevent the boot drive selection screen from displaying, could I install a second 'supported' card in one of the PCIe x4 slots (the other x16 will be blocked) and get the boot drive selection screen back (by plugging in a monitor to it when necessary)?\nWhat there any other deficiencies I can expect with this setup? Is a card that works but is unsupported on Lion likely to stop working with future versions of OS X (e.g., Mountain Lion).\n\nA: The card works fine in Lion but, indeed, without a boot screen or boot drive selection. I've left an old supported video card in another slot, and hooking a monitor to that card shows the boot screen/boot drive selection screen.\nI haven't had a chance to try out Mountain Lion on it.\n", "Q: Is there any way to sync iPhone with Google contacts with custom labels? The problem is that when you sync iPhone with google contacts through Microsoft Exchange all numbers with custom labels just don't sync to iPhone. So is there any solution to this problem?\n\nA: Depends on how you sync  Google Contacts to iPhone. If you do it by setting up the gmail account on your iPhone using  the Exchange option, then fields in your Google contacts do not transfer to the phone. But the advantage of using the Exchange way is that syncing is instant--edit a contact on the phone and it changes in your Google account as well. \nIf you sync the contacts using the gmail option, the custom fields in Google contacts DO show up on your phone. The disadvantage is that syncing only happens when you sync the phone with iTunes on your computer.\nThat's my experience, anyway. I would like to know how to have both: sync custom field labels and sync instantly on the fly with every edit. \n\nA: Try the following:\n\n*\n\n*Export all your Gmail contacts in the form of a vCard file.\n\n\n*Once you have the vCard file saved to your PC, import it to your iPhone with the help of the following tool:\nhttp://www.copytrans.net/iphone-contacts.php\n\n\n*If by custom labels you mean contact groups, then you can also recreate the contact groups on your iPhone again via using the above program.\n\nA: I found a great solution and I've used it myself.\nYou should turn off your exchange contacts-sync first (confirm it will remove your contacts) and then you should follow the directions on this support page of Google.\n", "Q: Why is Facebook app for iPhone so slow to load the content? Why is Facebook app for iPhone so slow to load the content (in particular posts comments) and it sometimes doesnt retrieve the posts at all?\nThe website works quite well and fast but the app is significantly slower, using the same wireless network.\nIs something wrong in my phone or does anyone have hints how to debug something like this?\n\nA: The predominant theory as to why the current Facebook app for iOS is so sluggish is that the app:\n\n\n*\n\n*suffers from its heavy use of JavaScript in a UIWebView component which does not currently benefit from the \"Nitro\" Javascript engine which is available to Mobile Safari\n\n*is poorly designed\n\n\nThe app uses very little native code, and thus most of your interaction takes place within a UIWebView displaying HTML and executing Javascript.\nEssentially, anywhere where an app is displaying something that looks and acts like it's \"embedding a web browser\", that's a UIWebView.\nIn very simple terms, the Nitro Javascript engine makes Javascript \"faster\".\niOS 4.3 brought the Nitro engine to Mobile Safari, and IOS 5 brought the Nitro engine to web shortcuts launched from the home screen. This is one potential reason why your use of Facebook within Mobile Safari seems so much more responsive.\nAs of iOS 5.1, UIWebView does not benefit from the Nitro Javascript engine.\nThis issue has been recently discussed on the Mobtest blog, \"Here’s why the Facebook iOS app is so bad (UIWebViews and no Nitro)\" with a number of comments in the related Hacker News thread.\nWithin the current app, Facebook has recently increased their promotion of additional iOS apps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Facebook Messenger\n\n*Facebook Pages Manager\n\n*Facebook Camera\nThese apps -- ranging from \"old news\" to \"brand new\" -- seem to do a good job of focusing on doing a single Facebook-related task well, in some cases adding support for something which the general Facebook iOS app does not even support.\n\nA: I work around it by using a vpn. Then comments, videos and others load quickly. Perhaps the problem is caused by ISPs using Deep Packet Inspection (which is bypassed when you use a vpn). The problem is also on android. \n\nA: If you want to click FB links use the web version (at least until FB improves its design.)\n", "Q: How to enable the windows/linux-like \"click to open/reduce windows\" on the dock There is a really intuitive behavior in windows or linux systems: when I reduce a window, it vanishes to the corresponding \"dock\" icon. Then, when I click on the program icon, the window shows up.\nOn OSX, the reduced window goes to the right side of the dock. When I click on the corresponding program icon, nothing happens.\nIs there any software that can enable the windows/linux reduce/show behavior ?\nEdit\nAdditionally, is it possible to reduce the window when I click another time on the application icon ?\n\nA: Sounds like you just need to check \"Minimize windows into application icon\" in System Preferences → Dock. \nThe application will then get minimized into its own Dock icon and clicking it will restore it, exactly as you suggest (although the restore behaviour should also happen even if the icon is minimized into the right hand side of the Dock).\n", "Q: Sync MacBook and iMac I have both a MacBook and an iMac.\nIs there any way I can have them both sync with files, apps, everything, like if one was a copy of another?\n\nA: 2 options:\n\n\n*\n\n*CarbonCopyCloner which puts a nice interface on rsync.\n\n*Use the built in rsync command-line utility. It's what it is designed for. You might want to only sync the Application Folder and some parts of your User folder. You may encounter license problems if an application that uses the SMBIOS MachineID has a mismatch.\n\n\nA: You should look into setting up a Netboot server.\n", "Q: Wiki Server 3 Plugins We're running Wiki Server 3 on Mac OS Lion Server.

I know that SSH from the command line is easy enough, but would like to give my students that use OS X a GUI option.\nIs there a PuTTY equivalent for the Mac?\n\nA: You could also take a look as ZOC6 seems pretty cool.\nZOC6 product page\n\nA: The best GUI application for SSH (and everything else you can do on the command line) is iTerm 2.  While the original iTerm had a tabbed interface before Terminal did, iTerm 2 again eclipses Terminal by adding: \n\n\n*\n\n*Support for 256 colors (you'll never go back to 16 colors after using 256)\n\n*Split panes (the sort of thing you can do in GNU screen or tmux, but at the level of the terminal emulator rather than in a program running on the server)\n\n*Special provision for integrating with tmux (an alternative to GNU screen, and which most people regard as better & faster than screen)\n\n*Terminal-level auto-completion (I don't use this feature so I can't detail how it has advantages over shell-level autocompletion: especially if you use the fish shell or zsh, then it may not be better)\n\n*Growl support\n\n*an Exposé-like view of your tabs\n\n*a full-screen view (and you can choose from either its own or OS X's built-in full-screen mode; I greatly prefer iTerm's own full-screen mode, since it doesn't force you to move to a new 'Space', thus allowing Command-Tab to still work properly)\n\n*paste history (a good complement to the shells' command histories)\n\n*Search\n\n*Instant Replay \n\n\nand a lot more.  Some are mentioned here but some are not, such as co-processes, triggers,smart selection, semantic history, and so on.  Development is pretty active, but documentation seems to lag behind.  I highly recommend it.  I've been using it for years now and have never missed Terminal.\n(It's possible Terminal does some of the things I mention here--it's been so long since I've used it that I don't recall, but when I switched I paid close attention to the differences and there were lots of advantages to iTerm.  And it keeps getting better every few weeks or months.)\n\nA: Fugu is what you are looking for.\n\nA: Configure ssh options and connect to ssh hosts manually always make me feel bored and have a lot of trouble. At Codinn we made a couple of GUI tools to make using ssh effortless. Those tools helped ourselves, and may also help you.\nCore Shell is a PuTTY alike tool with lots of extra features:\n\n\n*\n\n*Full-featured terminal, supports 24bit true color.\n\n*Support everything in OpenSSH, agent forwarding, certificates, proxy jump, etc.\n\n*Can read your existing ssh_config file as the source of advanced options, especially helpful for experienced users.\n\n*Also included advanced options editor, a handy way to tune per-host advanced options.\n\n*Tightly integrated with macOS Keychain, don't have to enter passwords or passphrases repeatedly.\n\n*Always tries to restore your connections after network failure or waking up from sleep.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA: If you are looking for something that keeps track of servers/connections via a GUI, Terminal.app will already do that for you. Launch it and then from the menu select Shell > New Remote Connection. This will give you a connections manager window. \n \n\nA: You could try SecureCRT and SecureFX from VanDyke Software.\n\nA: I'm getting along well with Royal TSX.\nThis is useful for SSH, RDP and VNC based terminals or web-based interfaces.\nIt has a built-in credential management and team-sharing features.\n\nA: You need to try Termius (available also as mobile app)\n\nA: vSSH is actually an ssh client based on putty.  I got it from the app store for about $10.00, so it's a great deal compared to ZOC.\n\nA: Just download Wine and download PuTTy.exe and right click and run through wine and when wine opens hit enter (application support) and give it a second and it will open, just make sure you have a server\n\nA: If you want to start a gui program from ssh, you can use x11 and relay it with xeyes.\nSee https://dyhr.com/2009/09/05/how-to-enable-x11-forwarding-with-ssh-on-mac-os-x-leopard/\n\nA: CyberDuck is a great option. I used it this semester in complement with Terminal. (CyberDuck is fully functional, we just coded in VI, so using the Terminal for SSH worked better for me.) \nYou can get CyberDuck for free online, or at a cost on the App Store. \nAnother option is FileZilla. I used it on Windows for FTP, but I believe that it supports SSH as well. It definitely runs on Mac as well as Windows, so it's another option. FileZilla is also free. \n", "Q: /var file buildup I'm a (semi-new) Mac developer. I've been working on a component to my app that - in order to function properly - needs to download a fairly large file from the internet. I thought this file would be stored in memory (and would be automatically removed once the app no longer needed it via ARC), but it's actually stored in the /var folder. I've been running and debugging this component for numerous days, which means roughly 20GB of unnecessary files have built up. Of course, I quickly changed my code to remove this file once it's no longer needed, but now I have a big, single 20GB file on my system that I must get rid of. I have a 64GB MBA, so I need all the space I can get. This is the path: /private/var/folders/9r/s6cf1dsj0_30tbz14vmhxj1r0000gn/T\nAny ideas as to how I can hunt these files down and remove them? I know the system keeps some important files in the /var folder, so I'm really hesitant to just drag it to the trash. I also have a whole bunch of custom stuff on my system, so I really don't want to do a clean install if I don't have to. Any ideas? I appreciate your time.\n\nA: It looks like they system is going through and removing parts of this file. Over time, I notice this file getting smaller and smaller. No tools or re-installs necessary.\n", "Q: How do I get iTunes to just play one album? I'm new to iTunes and I was wondering how I get it to play just one album? At present I have \"Grid\" view enabled. I select the artist I feel like listening to, and it switches to Album by Artist view (songs and artwork).\nI double click on the album and it plays through, but then it continues down and plays the next album by the artist... Quite annoying!\nHow can I get iTunes to just play the album I've told it to?\n\nA: You can go to the menu bar and select View » Column Browser » Show Column Browser. Then you can pick an Album in the third column, and only songs on that album will appear in the iTunes window. Note that this will switch you from the Grid view to the List view.\n\n\nA: It's rather easier than these solutions. Click the icon view beside the search and select the Albums tab at the top so the icons show albums rather than Artists or Composers. Then when you hover over an album you can click \"Play Album\" to play it. You can also double click the album to see all the songs making sure they are ordered by song number (if necessary). \n\nThis way you can also by command or shift clicking select multiple albums. \nOr you can show with the second icon ordered by album by artist. In this view an artist search will help:\n\n\nA: While in List view you could:\n\n\n*\n\n*If using Play Random Song, just search for the name of the album, and play. Unless you clear the search box, the played songs will be the ones from the search.\n\n*If you're not using it, just order the list by Album and play the first song. The rest of the album will play afterwards.\nYou could, too, create a new PlayList, drag all the songs from that album, and play.\n", "Q: Recording screen via Quick Time Player along with the sound As seen from some of the youtube videos I tried to record a video playing on my mac but I couldn't hear anything. I chose File -> New Screen Recording in Quick Time Player. Any other software to do it or any other suggestions for how I can do it?\nThanks\n\nA: QuickTime alone won't capture computer audio along with a screen capture, but combined with a free utility Soundflower, you can do this.\nMacWorld has a step-by-step guide, but the basic idea is to install Soundflower and set your computer audio out to Soundflower, so system sounds play to it and not to the speakers. Then in QuickTime, when you set up a new screen capture, select Soundflower as the audio source. Then you can do a screen recording and capture system audio at the same time.\nNote that this is the free but messy version.

This will let you know if the machine is operating fine hardware and storage wise. If you can boot into your recovery HD with no issues - not only do you know the problem is isolated to the boot volume, but you have Disk Utility and an internet browser to run tests and see what step is next.\nMore and more Macs are getting updates to run Internet Recovery. Once you have your mac booted, you can then know where the problem lies. Worst case, with a current backup, you could just erase your Mac HD volume and reinstall Lion.\nThere are a few opions:\n\n\n*\n\n*If the HDD is not recognized, you need a hardware repair.\n\n*If the HDD is recognized but the Mac HD is not, you will need to create a new partition and reinstall.\n\n*If the Mac HD is recognized, repair disk and restart to test; if the issue persists, reinstall.\n\n\nIf you don't get what I described here, please say so and I'll extend my answer.

It sounds like you either have a virus or your hard drive is failing. I strongly recommend running \"disk warrior\", that seems to work very well if your hard drive is failing.

I just migrated from a 120 GB SSD drive to a 600 GB SSD drive. As I was lazy and didn't want to reinstall Mac OS X (Lion), I chose the following migration path:\n\n\n*\n\n*I created at GPT on the 600 GB target disk with exactly the same three partitions as they are present on my old disk, using gdisk. I placed the third partition (that holds the Lion Recovery System) at the end of the disk, such that there is empty space between the system partition (holding the \"Macintosh HD\" labeled FS) and the recovery partition. I chose this setup as I wasn't sure whether I wanted to expand my system partition later or use the new space for a separate filesystem.\n\n*I plugged my old 120 GB SSD into a linux box and saved three images, one for each partion, using dd\n\n*Then I plugged my new 600 GB SSD into the same box and wrote the three images to the three newly created partitions, again, using dd\nThen I installed the 600 GB SSD back in my Macbook Pro and started up the system. Everything works fine, with the exception that it seems to take forever for the computer to decide what partition to boot from - before the early password prompt (I use full disk encryption) I now have to stare at a white screen for about 10 seconds.\nDisk Utility reports that something is wrong with the partition table that might cause trouble when booting the system:\n\nNow, fortunately, up to now they only delay booting, but don't prevent it ;) Don't be confused by the screenshot, in the meantime I created another partition holding a filesystem labelled \"Storage HD\".\nWhat did I miss? Is there a boot flag or something like that for a GPT partition that I didn't set? Disk Utility is unable to \"repair\" anything. Also, when I boot with a Lion Installation Media and use Disk Utility from there, it doesn't report any error at all.\nI am aware of the recovery from TimeMachine / old disk / etc options of the Mac OS X Installer. I'm not interested in alternative ways to migrate a Mac OS X installation, but want to understand what exactly is going on here.\n\nA: A PRAM / NVRAM reset (⌘-⌥-P-R on startup) fixed the delay. The Disk Utility error report remains. Started again from my old drive, the error is reported there as well... probably it was there before the migration.\n", "Q: iPhone: App for Web Address recognition When I'm browsing a website on my laptop, I'd like to capture my laptop's screen with the iPhone's camera and be redirected automatically to the corresponding page.\nCan you recommend an app that automatically can recognize a URL in a picture?\n\nA: Handoff is a good solution for this.

You don't have to be recording. It costs $50 but will work for 10 minutes each session before inserting static into the audio.\n\n\n\n\nA: Another tool is audacity. It has a stereo level monitor.\nSee http://audacity.sourceforge.net/\nAudacity is free and open source, but it's a recorder and editor, which may be more than you want.\n\nA: Update: I've talked with Orban about updating this metering tool for OS X 10.10 and beyond and unfortunately they're not interested in doing this work nor did they want to release the code as open source for others to achieve it. I highly recommend looking at one of the other answers if you're on El Capitan or newer.\nFor the past 8 months or so I've been using the free Orban Loudness Meter to do metering on arbitrary audio signals on my Mac. It has pretty good support for snooping on the real audio interfaces I have connected to my machine. And when its built-in snooping doesn't work, I'll route audio through it using SoundFlower.\nThe UI isn't pretty but it is by far and away the best loudness meter I've used, including paid options. It's meant for professional metering with an audience of radio and television post-production audio professionals.\nIt implements some of the new weighted average standards in metering that are designed to get The Loudness Wars under control -- they're weighted such that maximal limiting of the signal ends up showing an overall lower output average power. It encourages mixing for dynamics instead of mixing for loud.\nTheir Mac 2.0.6 version has been running just fine for me on OS X 10.9.x Mavericks.\n\n", "Q: Setting the default calendar in iOS?

I am running iTunes, 10.6.1 on my Mac mini running OS X Lion 10.7.4. This Mac mini has my entire media library including a ton of DVDs that were ripped and transcoded to work on Apple TV. I have 3 of the very latest Apple TVs that stream content from the Home Sharing library of my Mac mini. Everything works great most of the time.\nI am running to an issue with increasing frequency, where the Apple TVs cannot load the library from the Mac mini (it shows the spinning gear). The only solution I have found is to quit iTunes on the Mac mini and then restart it.\nWhat I would like to do is have something on my iPhone that will allow me to stop and then restart iTunes on the Mac mini. I run Apache on this machine and I have written a little PHP script that will stop and then start iTunes using AppleScript and osascript. It works fine from the Terminal, but not from the web server. I am sure it is a permissions problem, but I do not really want to run the web server under my user account.\nAny suggestions? I can buy an app or script something using PHP or AppleScript. I do not want to use just an SSH or VNC client because I want my kids to do this easily as well.\n\nA: One option would be to run sudo visudo to edit the sudoers file and add the following line:\napacheuser ALL=(youruser) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/osascript\n\nBe sure to change apacheuser to the account that apache runs under and youruser to the account that iTunes runs under. This allows apache to run AppleScript commands as the chosen user without prompting for a password. You can find more information about this in the sudoers man page.\nHowever, this could introduce a security hole, since the apache user would then be able to perform any action as the user that AppleScript allows. A better option would be to create an intermediary shell script that takes start and stop as an argument. \n#!/bin/sh\n\ncase $1 in\n    stop)  /usr/bin/osascript -e 'tell application \"iTunes\" to quit';;\n    start) /usr/bin/open /Applications/iTunes.app;;\n    *)     echo 'Please use \"start\" or \"stop\" as an argument.';;\nesac\n\nSave this in a file somewhere, and make it executable with chmod +x. In this case, your line in the sudoers file would now be:\napacheuser ALL=(youruser) NOPASSWD: /Some/Directory/iTunesControl.sh\n\nThen, from your PHP script, call the shell script with:\nsudo -u youruser /Some/Directory/iTunesControl.sh stop|start\n\n\nA: From http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3180\n\nPress and hold Menu and Down on your aluminum Apple Remote for six seconds and then release when you see the LED light on the Apple TV flash rapidly.\n\nThis should fix your problem without having to do anything to iTunes or the Mac mini.\n", "Q: Clean install of Lion I have a 1st generation MacBook Air running Leopard 10.5.8.

I just picked up 16GB of RAM for my MacBook Pro, running the newest OS X. According to the NewEgg reviews, it should work in it. However, once I boot up, it shows the Apple logo and, after a few seconds, the spinner just freezes.\nIf I boot into my Windows 7 partition, it lists 16GB as installed, and 15.7GB available. Why, then, is OS X not recognizing it?\nI've tried each of the sticks themselves (1x8GB), and OS X still freezes. The RAM came as 2x8GB and are PC3-10600 @ 1333 MHz.\nI've tried holding D as the computer boots, but it just gray screens for a while, then jumps to the Apple logo.\nIt seems to me that 16GB may not work, but why then does the same hardware, just Windows 7 successfully run?\n\nA: \nYour Mac needs to meet specific criteria for this to work. In the case of the 2010 Macs, here’s what you must have:\n\n*\n\n*a Mac mini (Mid-2010), a MacBook (Mid-2010) or a 13” MacBook Pro (Mid-2010)\n\n*Mac OS X 10.7.5 or later\n\n*the latest EFI firmware update for your system\n\n*the proper specification memory modules\n\n\nSee Certain 2010 MacBook, MacBook Pro, and Mac mini models join the ’16GB’ MaxRAM club for details.\nYou will need (2x8GB) 16GB DDR3-1066MHz SODIMM.

(For machines that support 16 GB, it mentions that Apple says it supports 8GB but it'll actually work with 16.)\nSo OS X probably just doesn't know how to talk to 8 GB sticks on that chipset.

I have what I consider to be a large iTunes Library, ~38 days of music. Worse? I'm a stickler for tags to be correct. Worse still? I'm SUPER lazy, and like things to be done for me as automatically as possible.\nSome time ago I used a piece of software that had a particularly nasty bug which corrupted the tags on all of my songs with non-latin characters. I've since updated and re-run the same piece of software, and as I play songs previously corrupted, I see their tags update and become correct and intact again. However, after some amount of time, it seems that the tags revert back to their corrupted state.\nThis seems to manifest itself in other songs where no corruption has occurred, but the comments and some other custom keys I encode into the files disappear, or revert, as well.\nI think this is because there is the tag data in the files themselves, but also in the iTunes Library files (itdb, itl, and xml files). I think that the data in those files are taking precedence, or failing some sync, or in general just failing in mysterious ways causing the above stated issues to occur.\nWhat is the best procedure for updating a large chunk of tags in my library, and ensuring iTunes sees them, respects them, and will not continue to muck with them any further?\n\nA: This is what I have done:\nI backed up all my files, and then deleted ALL my music from my iTunes Library. I could swear I said \"delete from iCloud\", but that obviously did not occur. Some of the aforementioned data stuck around, and I didn't lose playlists I was quite concerned I had neglected to back up.\nI tagged my files externally, re-imported them into iTunes, and everything began to work fantastically (well, mostly, but the issues are better left for another question).\nFast forward to about two days later, certain songs started exhibiting the same corruption. I again have songs that are tagged as being on disc 1 of 128602 discs (note: completely wrong). iTunes Match is definitely at play here. But I assumed that already.\nI've been looking into how other apps interact with iTunes, and stumbled across iTunes integration plugins for MusicBrainz Picard. The tagging app I prefer to use en massé.\nI don't know if these plugins are still compatible with Picard, Picard has come a long way (especially as of the 1.0 release last week) since these plugins have been touched; But there is a lot of interesting notes. The author talks explicitly about notifying iTunes that there are changes, something the plugins will apparently do, but also points you BACK TO MusicBrainz, which lists some additional steps you can take to updating iTunes.\nI have an AppleScript that will invoke the \"refresh selection\" suggestions per MusicBrainz, but I have not yet fixed my tags... again. And even after that, I don't know exactly how long it takes for tags to revert and become corrupted again.\nThis road is still worth investigating further, but it's a hard one. I'm not exactly sure how to dig into the iTunes Scripting Bridges or other internal facets of iTunes itself in order to reliably update tag data from external applications, but that's certainly what should be done. Update it, and tell iTunes you updated it. Especially when an external repository of metadata is at play.\n", "Q: Can I hot-plug a DVI monitor in a Mac Pro? I have a Mac Pro with a DVI display, and I got a new DVI display for it.\nI want to unplug the (only) display, and plug in the new display to that DVI port.  And/or, unplug the existing display, and plug it into a DVI port on another (slower) graphics card.  (Does that make sense?)\nI've hot-swapped DVI displays on Mac laptops for years, but I've never done it with a Mac desktop.  Will a Mac be cool with temporarily having zero displays?\n\nA: Absolutely!  At work we have multiple Mac Pro's that have 1 monitor between them hot-swapped and while there's up to 5 seconds of delay for the video to come through, it works great.\nYou can hot-swap displays, but not video cards - if that makes sense.\n", "Q: How to memorize the Option key ⌥? I wonder if there is a good way to memorize the Option key ⌥.  I almost always think of it as the Shift key, because it looks like a lower level and a higher level (the small hyphen elevated).\nOr maybe a way to memorize it better is, what is the shape of this symbol for?  I mean, what does it represent symbol wise?\n\nA: The easiest way is this:\nThere is only one key on the entire bottom row of the keyboard with two items stacked on top of each other -- just like the ⌥ in question. I think this is a much simpler visual-mental association to remember.\n\nA: I don't have an answer to the question, but I can suggest a solution to the problem. The two unlabeled modifier keys on the wireless & Macbook Pro keyboards are ⌥ and ^, for \"option\" and \"control,\" respectively. If you imagine that the ^ symbol is sort of a sideways \"C,\" you can remember that's control. Since ⌥ isn't \"Control,\" it must be the \"option\" key. \nNot a perfect solution by any means, but it's a workaround until they start printing the symbols on the keys again. \n\nA: Weird/cool question!\nI think I went through a similar thought process at one point: the way I think of it is like a set of train tracks. The train enters at the left and reaches a fork or split, giving it the option of the upper or lower path to the right. In the glyph, the tracks are set for the lower option.\nShift does have its own glyph: ⇧, which can be remembered as pushing the case of the typed letter up.\n\nA: It's been suggested that the origin of the option key symbol lies in the symbols used in electrical diagrams to indicate a switch [1,2], allowing the electrical current to either go through the bottom or top route:\n\nSee also the section switches on the Wikipedia article “Electronic symbol”.\nI remember reading that this isn't just a suggestion, but is the actual origin of the symbol but I can't find an authoritative source on that at the moment.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.quora.com/Keyboards-computer/What-is-the-origin-of-the-Macs-option-key-symbol-%E2%8C%A5\n\n*https://discussions.apple.com/thread/1864469\n\nA: There is a slash, so you have the option of the side with the hyphen and the side without.\n\nA: All of the European Apple keyboards show, on the keys themselves, the icon for not just option, but shift, caps lock, command, tab, delete, and return.  Check out the different languages they have available.\nThe Japanese Apple keyboards, like the American ones, don't have any of these icons, so they can commiserate with us.\nI really have no clue why they don't do this for the American (and Japanese) keyboards, since it's so ridiculously useful.\nThe good news is that they seem to sell these keyboards in America now, and \"standard shipping\" is free, so if you can deal with some of the keys being slightly different (like \"return\" being double-tall), you can order yourself a nice new Belgian keyboard and sell your old American keyboard on craigslist!\n", "Q: App Store links don't work when App Store is running I have a 32 GB iPad 3 with WiFi. If I try to follow an app store link, like from Safari or AppShopper, it will activate the running instance of the App Store but will not navigate to the link destination. If I force close the App Store and try again, it will launch the App Store and navigate to the right destination. \nThe problem is 100% reproducible. I have tried restarting the iPad and disabling\\enabling Safari. \nI've also found this link which describes my problem (here), but I can't figure out how to apply the solution there without losing my data. \n\nA: It's annoying, but if you force close the App Store each time, it will pull up the correct link when you reopen it.\n", "Q: Word:mac 2011 preserve table formatting on copy-paste In Microsoft Word 2010 for Windows, I can duplicate a table simply by clicking its handle at the top-left (which selects the entire table), copying it and pasting it. When I do that in Word:mac, the table and contents is duplicated without any of the table formatting. This kinda sucks because the original table has a number of merged cells and all sorts of formatting going on. I'm basically using the source table as a template.\nI just updated Office:mac 2011 to SP2.\n\nA: Go to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Word → Preferences → Edit → Settings  (under cut and paste options use smart cut and paste)\n\n*Remove the check mark on \"Adjust table formatting and alignment on paste\".\nNow try copy-paste of a table.

I bought an iPhone4 from ebay, and it was marked as UNLOCKED, but in fact it was not.. After couple of emails, I gave this up, and I want to sell it. It is AT&T. The questions are:\n1) What would you do in my case? The untethered jailbreak came out, but needs iPhone to be activated. iOS was upgraded to 5.1.1 9B206, so also the baseband is quite new - no way to unlock it in the near future.\n2) iPhone must be activated with the original AT&T SIM or just any AT&T SIM ? So that, I could write it in description in case I would sell it.\nThanks.\n\nA: To answer your questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*I haven't tested it myself (but I'll in the near future), but there are SIM cards available, comparable to the Gravy SIM (but here is no need to dial 112), which will unlock your iPhone. It's not that expensive, so I would give it a try.\nSorry, it looks like this SIM only supports the iPhone 4S.\n\n*You can unlock the iPhone with any AT&T card, no need for the original card. At least, that worked with my T-Mobile locked iPhone. So I would guess it's the same for your AT&T locked iPhone.  \nDo you know you have a return policy on eBay? And in a matter of fact, if you've paid with PayPal, you can set-up a conflict and ask for your money back... But this just for your information. \n", "Q: Does plugging in an iPhone/iPad make a difference to its battery lifespan? I've been led to believe there's a difference between how a MacBook and an iPhone/iPad consume power: when a MacBook with a fully charged battery is plugged in, its components draw power directly from the charger while when an iPhone/iPad with a fully charged battery is plugged in, its components still draw power from the battery which is frequently recharged to keep it at 100%. Hence, it doesn't make a difference to the battery's overall lifespan whether the iPhone/iPad is plugged in while you use the device. \nOr in other words, if I'm using an iPhone/iPad and am not worried about battery life, there's no point in plugging it in anyway in the hope of prolonging battery lifespan?\nIs this correct or have I been misinformed?\n\nA: Deeper discharge/charge cycles shorten an Li-Ion battery's lifespan faster that shallow ones.  (e.g. One 100% cycle is more wearing that four 25% cycles, etc.)  Therefore, keeping an iPad or iPhone on a charger or always topped off between short uses will tend to lengthen the battery's total lifespan by reducing the number of deeper cycles per annum, all other thing being equal (such as total time of use).\n\"Calibrating\" has almost nothing to do with the battery lifespan.  It's mostly needed to help the battery gauge icon behave more accurately.  Once or twice a year is probably good enough for that purpose.\n\nA: According to this article on Li-Ion batteries, yes, it may reduce the lifespan, if the device is powered on.\nCharging a device while powered on introduces \"parasitic load,\" which unduly stresses the battery cells, and will shorten the battery's lifespan.\n(The section on parasitic load is the fifth paragraph after Figure 3)\n\nA: As far as I know, most mobile phones including iphone in the market will have their battery life shortened if you constantly use them plugged in.\nThe power keeps going charger - battery - phone.\nSince this batteries have what some call \"Memory\". If you have them constantly plugged in, it will affect that \"memory\". On a more technical term is like with old PC laptops, since the power is still going through the battery, the battery cell contacts get over used because of the constant power.\nThe best thing is once a month or every two months calibrate the battery like with laptops. Empty it completely, then plug it in and leave it charging without turning on your device. This will improve the battery life in the long run.\n", "Q: Fluid: when I try to login, my Fluid App launches the default browser instead I've created a Fluid App for my favorite website.\nBut there's a problem when I try to login to the website in the Fluid App I created: my default web browser (in my case, Safari) launches instead. \nWhy can't I login? Why does my Fluid App defer browsing to my default browser when I try to login to the website?\n\nA: Todd's answer is correct, however, Google has since updated their URLs slightly, so...\ninstead of:\n*google.com*/accounts/ServiceLoginAuth*\n\nuse:\n*google.com*/ServiceLoginAuth*\n\nPS I don't have enough rep to post this as a comment on the original answer :/\n\nA: Fluid Apps try to keep your browsing limited to the website or webapp you chose when you created the Fluid App. Therefore, any Fluid App will send you to your system default web browser (like Safari or Firefox) if you browse to a URL \"outside\" that website.\nNow, determining what constitutes a \"website\" is more black art than exact science. \"Website\" is in scare quotes because a website is a rather vague idea that may include documents and resources that are located on different servers... and therefore located in different URL domains.\nAlso, the login flow for many websites often quickly and quietly redirects you thru several URLs that may or may not look anything like the home URL you provided. This will cause Fluid to defer browsing to the system default browser.\nYour Fluid App looks at any URL it is asked to display and tries to guess whether the resource at that URL is part of the same \"website\" as the home URL you provided. This is a tricky guessing game, and Fluid can never be 100% accurate out of the box.\nThe good news is that Fluid has a whitelist/blacklist feature for allowing/disallowing browsing to any URL pattern you choose. Basically, you need to define what constitutes your Fluid App's \"website\" to control what your Fluid App is allowed to do.\nTo configure this feature, go to your Fluid App's Application Menu (to the right of the Apple menu):\nPreferences > Whitelist Preference Pane\n\nIn the Whitelist Prefpane, you can add/edit/remove URL patterns that will keep your Fluid App browsing only to URLs you would like. Select the \"Allow browsing to URLs matching these patterns:\" radio button.\nIn the \"Pattern\" table below, you should add a Wildcard Pattern for any URL which you want to your Fluid App to visit. Star (\"*\") is a special Wildcard character in this table. Star means \"match anything here\", and is a powerful way to easily include or exclude very large groups of URL patterns.\nAlternatively, you can use full Regular Expressions instead of Wildcard Patterns by wrapping your URL pattern in forward slashes / like: /http:\\/\\/google\\.com\\/.+/. If you don't know what Regular Expressions are, forget I mentioned them. They're much more complicated, and Wildcard Patterns can almost always get the job done more easily.\nIf you find that your Fluid App is unnecessarily kicking you out to your default browser (say, Safari) you should try to determine the first URL that is loaded in Safari. This first URL is the one that Fluid thinks is not part of your \"website\". After determining that URL, you should add a pattern to the table described above to match that URL. I suggest applying stars liberally to the pattern so that Fluid will be more accepting of browsing to a similar URL.\nFluid also ships with a fair amount of \"special case\" code by default for some of the more well-known webapps. Basically, this means that Fluid has a collection of URL patterns that are known to work for some of the more popular webapps (especially ones that quickly redirect you to URLs that don't match the common home URLs), and Fluid will automatically insert these patterns on first launch. Gmail is a good example and the default patterns for Gmail are shown in the screenshot above.\n\nA: If you're trying to do this with a local file, add the pattern file://* and everything works fine. \n\nA: Once I opened the Gmail Calendar in the browser and copied the FULL URL, I was able to use that URL in the Fluid app to create a standalone app that was my Google Calendar.  Previously I had only entered a shortened URL and was probably why a blank browser window was opening.\nMy advice is to go the the website first in your browser, then copy the URL for creating a new Fluid app.\n", "Q: Can't see new SSD when connected via internal SATA port I just bought a new Samsung SSD 830 and installed it my 13\" MacBook Pro (Mid 2010) in the hard disk bay, replacing the drive that was there (I actually have a second drive in the optical drive's slot). Unfortunately, when I started up my computer (from the other drive I have), I can't see the SSD in System Information (formerly Profiler) or Disk Utility.\nHowever, I see the drive fine when using a SATA-to-USB adapter and I also am able to see the old hard disk when it is connected via the internal SATA, so the internal wiring seems to be fine. Thus:\n\n\n*\n\n*HDD via USB: works\n\n*SSD via USB: works\n\n*HDD via internal SATA: works\n\n*SSD via internal SATA: completely broken\n\n\nAnyone have ideas for a fix?\n\nA: It turned out that the hard drive cable was broken. Replacing it fixed the problem completely.\n\n\nA: If you have a windows computer around you might try updating the firmware. Also I'm curious about what happens if you start the computer from the recovery disk. It's not the drive and it's not the cable. I suppose you can try really make sure the cable is seated well.  Alternatively, if it isn't too much of a hassle what happens when you take the extra drive in the optical bay out?\n", "Q: Is Bluetooth battery information readable in Windows on Boot Camp? Is there any way to see the battery level of a Bluetooth device (e.g. magic mouse) in Windows with Boot Camp?\n\nA: There is an application for Windows called \"Bluetooth Battery Monitor.\" It is in beta right now, but I use it for my Ghostek SoDrop 2.0 headphones, and it works well. \nYou can download the beta at: https://www.bluetoothgoodies.com/\nI don't think that BootCamp per se would make a difference as to whether the Windows program would work or not, or any program at all, for that matter.\n\nA: Our software Magic Utilities can read the battery state of all Apple Bluetooth devices. \nBesides this, we offer much better multi-touch and keyboard support than BootCamp and run on any Windows computer.\n", "Q: Can I start a new conversation with the same number or Apple ID in Messages? Sometimes my conversations get long and unwieldy over time, but being so sentimental I'd like to keep them around on my devices (and not just leave them in iTunes backups that I might not be able to access again later).\nIn the Messages app, can I start a new conversation with a person under the same number or Apple ID, while preserving our previous conversation on my iOS device? Or if not, is there a feasible workaround (somehow involving switching numbers in the person's contact card or something)?\n\nA: I think that when you send a new message and it has the same receiver, the messages app automatically groups that with any old messages. The threads are really designed to be conversations between people and not separate threads with new conversation topics like email\n\nA: The only way to start a new conversation, or thread, is if the recipient has a different email address. For example, multiple emails can be stored under one contact, but messages sent to and from different emails are stored in a new thread.\n", "Q: Display size problems with two monitors I just added a second monitor and my display is mis-sized.

I've tweaked with the display resolution to no avail. Any ideas?\n\nThere's a black box in the bottom right corner where the mouse won't go, so the actual image is a bit taller than this. Also note how the left side of the window gets cut off.\n\nI am running Snow Leopard; pretty sure zoom is not the issue.\n\nA: That's what it looks like and that's the behavior when you zoom in on the laptop screen.  You can zoom in (even under Snow Leopard) via the trackpad or scroll wheel or keyboard.  In Snow Leopard there settings for screen zoom in System Preferences under \"Universal Access\" (both \"Zoom\" and \"Zoom Options...\"), \"Mouse\", and \"Trackpad\".

Is there some setting I can change?\nI guess simply creating a second Parallels VM running XP directly would be a workaround, but I don't have a separate copy of XP handy, and would like to avoid having to buy one. \n\nA: As the comments have suggested, Parallels does not support Windows XP Mode in Windows 7 directly.\nParallels Knowledge-base article\nHowever, the VMware knowledge-base does list a pair of patches from Microsoft (x86 patch and x64 patch) that remove the requirement for the hardware virtualisation on XP mode which should allow Parallels to also run the XP mode.\nVMware Knowledge-base article\n", "Q: Is there a shortcut to get to the bottom of a long email on iPad or iPhone? I get some long emails in which the important stuff is at the bottom after many pages. It is tedious to scroll down.  Is there a way to get to the bottom quickly?

This isn't nearly as elegant as a tap shortcut, but does let you quickly skip to the bottom of a long view.\n\nA: Here's a workaround I just figured out:  Just make a comment at the top and bottom of the document.  When you view the top comment, you can then use the < in the comment navigation to quickly go to the bottom comment.  As mentioned before, you can quickly navigate to the top at any time by tapping the clock in the topbar.  Even if you make a lot of comments, you can always navigate < from the top to the very last comment.

The only issue is that when I am listening on headphones, occasionally it thinks that it is docked (which silences the headphones), then half a second to 10 seconds later, it thinks it has been removed from the dock that it was never connected to and thus pauses the audio.  Since all this happens in the OS while it monitors the status of the headphone jack and the media dock, it would be very easy to write a program to tell it to stop polling the media dock, and thus the faulty dock detection switch would be ignored.  So, has someone already written an iPhone app that is on Cydia that would let me turn off the dock detector switch?\n\nA: Unfortunately, this would require some very specific code that goes beyond anything I've seen on Cydia. That's not to say that a solution does not (or will not by the time I finish this post) exist. However, through my research and experience, this is handled by code much deeper in iOS than most Cydia apps care to touch. I wish I could offer a solution, but unfortunately, I think the only \"real\" solution is repair or replacement. Sorry. :(\nGood luck and happy listening!\n\nA: Perhaps more of a workaround than an answer, and it may only solve half your problem (plus a bit late), but anyway: my suggestion is to try a different music player. The standard Apple iPod app (and most other audio players) not only redirects audio when docked, but stop playing when undocked, as you noted in your description. However, there are some audio player apps that don't stop playing when undocked. Just one example is the free Cydia app MyFile (just tried this with my iPod and dock). So you'll still have the \"half a second to 10 seconds\" silence, but won't have to press play afterwards.\n\nA: I'd use eBay to swap the phone.  Upgrade to a 4S \nPeople will buy iPhones that are in much worse condition , and in one day auctions. \n\nA: I followed a tip in a reddit forum somewhere.. Using iFile, go to system --> Library --> LaunchDaemons and there search for a file \"com.apple.iapd.plist\". Make a backup of that first and then delete it. When you reboot your system, voila! you should have your audio back. It worked for me. I guess it deletes the docking detecting algorithm so make sure you back up the file in case you have to use some dock in the future.!\n", "Q: This script randomizes a MAC address--but I cannot renew DHCP afterwards #!/bin/bash\nNEWMAC=`openssl rand -hex 6 | sed 's/\\(..\\)/\\1:/g; s/.$//'`\nifconfig $1 ether $NEWMAC\nifconfig $1 down\nifconfig $1 up\n\nI pass en0 or en1 as the sole argument to the script and run as sudo. When I do this, the MAC does change, however I cannot restore connectivity until I reboot and the new MAC is lost.

I have an iPhone that was dropped in water. Once the backlight level goes below a certain point, the screen is completely black/useless. I need to go in iFile or some other file system browsing software to set the brightness level to 80% or something high. I've looked around and found the backlight level for SB Settings but I'm not sure if that will work. Anybody know where that setting is?\n\nA: User > Library > Preferences. The property is called \"SBBacklightLevel2\" in the com.apple.springboard.plist file.\nThanks @Andrew Larsson for the confirmation of this.\n", "Q: How can I synchronize my two Mac Computers? I have a Macbook and an iMac, generally I work on my Macbook, but sometimes I need that information on my iMac. My OS is Mac OSX Snow Leopard.\n\nA: If you are just looking to sync your files and document, give dropbox a try.\n\nA: Depending on your usage scenarios (which you don't specify), I use the built-in rsync command to perform a one-way sync of files from one machine to another connected to the same network. \nAlternatively, if you want full two-way synchronization (that is, sync changes made on either computer) then Unison (free/donationware) also works well.\n\nA: I use a similar setup (imac & macbook air)\nmy experienced recommendation is to use\n\n\n*\n\n*mobile me or icloud to sync email, contacts, calendars, bookmarks, etc… (google could be a substitute)\n\n*dropbox for files, documents, pictures & some application preferences (textexpander)\n\n*notational velocity with simplenote sync for notes\n\n**if something was still missing  can access the imac from parallels desktop via the iphone app (or any other remote desktop application)\n\nA: I use ChronoSync for documents and DropBox for essentials. Dropbox has my notes, 1Password, etc and is used to share between all devices. For documents and other work, I have ChronoSync pointing at my documents folder and code folders to sync between my laptop and desktop. In my case, whenever I switch between the two computers, I just run the sync on the laptop while on the LAN with the desktop before continuing. All changes on each machine are synched to the latest version on both.\n", "Q: Why does iTunes always lose my iPod's sync settings? I have my iPod set up to only sync certain playlists, so that I don't fill up the whole thing. However, iTunes keeps on losing my sync settings for my iPod across syncs. It doesn't remember any of the settings I set at all and I have to go back and check all the playlist again...etc. How can I fix this, as it is really annoying (and a big hassle)? I've tried restoring the iPod, repairing permissions. There are two other devices synced to my iTunes, an iPod nano, and an iPad.\nUpdate: The recent update to iTunes (10.6.3) doesn't seem to fix this issue.\n\nA: It seems like the problem was when I enabled disk use in my iPod's settings:\n\nUnchecking this box seems to have fixed this issue.

I use my dad's Apple ID. My dad has many apps and if I want a game/app that normally costs money he mostly has it, so I can install it for free. Now I want to make a new account but my dad says that I can't install his apps anymore so that I have to pay the apps again. E.g: My dad has cut the rope and I want it too, can I just switch accounts and install it or do I have to buy it myself on my own account? And when I make a new ID, do I lose my apps than?\n\nA: You can install and use apps bought via different Apple IDs on the same device. In case of application updates you have to be logged in with the matching ID to load the update though.\n", "Q: Script to move files under their first letter name i've a lot of files (1000+) in a single directory, and i would like to organize them into sub directories, according to their first letter.\nSo i've 200 files starting with A, and i would like to move them into subdirectory \"A\", then all \"B\" files etc. etc.\nHow to do ? \n\nA: In a terminal: cd into the directory in question, then\nfor x in `ls -1 | sed -e 's/^\\(.\\).*/\\1/' | sort -u`; do\nmkdir $x && mv -i ${x}?* $x\ndone\n\nThis assumes that no files have a single character name before you start. If they do, you might move them aside before you run the above procedure:\nmkdir singles && mv ? singles\n\nand then move them to their appropriate destinations aftwards.\nEdit: See the comments below for some caveats. If you run into problems with too long command lines, you could replace the second line by\nmkdir $x && find . -maxdepth 1 -name \"${x}?*\" -exec mv -i {} $x \\;\n\n\nA: Here's a Ruby one-liner:\nruby -e 'require \"FileUtils\"; Dir[\"*\"].each { |f| next if File.directory?(f); d = f[0]; Dir.mkdir d rescue nil; FileUtils.mv(f,d) }'\n\nIt basically iterates over all files, creates the directories if possible and moves the files to it afterwards.\nJust execute this line from the directory.\n\nA: This would also work if the filenames start with multibyte characters (like Ä or あ):\nls | iconv -f utf8-mac -t utf-8 | LC_CTYPE=UTF-8 cut -c1 | uniq | while IFS= read -r l; do\n  f=(\"$l\"*)\n  mkdir -- \"$l\"\n  mv -- \"${f[@]}\" \"$l\"\ndone\n\niconv -f utf8-mac -t utf-8 converts text from a partially decomposed form used by HFS+ to precomposed form. See Text Encodings in VFS or this question. LC_CTYPE=UTF-8 makes cut -c1 consider multibyte characters as single characters.\n", "Q: Server Admin: How to set up multiple mail domains? I've got a co.uk domain set up in Server Admin on an OS X Lion server for mail. It's all running fine.\nI'd like to also set up a .com domain to run through the same mail server.\nIs this possible? If so can someone give me details on how to set it up - without losing the .co.uk domain?\n\nA: Assuming you want the domains to be synonymous (e.g. richard@domain.com and richard@domain.co.uk both correspond to the same mailbox), it's pretty easy.  The trick is that the relevant configuration option is available in Server Admin.app but not Server.app.  To get Server Admin, install the server admin tools (v10.7.4 is here, be sure to get the version matching what you're installing on), then open /Applications/Server/Server Admin.\nIn Server Admin, connect to the server (if it doesn't autoconnect), then select the server name in the sidebar -> Settings in the toolbar -> Services tab -> enable the Mail service and click Save in the bottom right (note: the Save button doesn't highlight very clearly when there are settings that need saving; just get in the habit of clicking it after doing anything).\nOnce the Mail service is enabled, it should appear in the sidebar (although you may need to click the disclose triangle next to the server name).  Select Mail in the sidebar -> Settings in the toolbar -> Advanced tab -> Hosting subtab -> add the additional domain(s) to the \"Local Host Aliases\" list.\nNote: this configures the server to accept mail for additional domain(s).  In order for this to do anything useful, you also need to add MX records to DNS for the additional domain(s), so other servers know to deliver the mail to your server.\nEDIT: to handle non-synonymous (\"virtual\") domains, go to Server Admin -> Mail -> Settings -> Advanced -> Hosting, enable virtual hosting, and add the domain(s) to the \"Locally Hosted Virtual Domains\" list.  Then, add aliases to your user accounts for their virtual email addresses.  You can add aliases either in Server.app (right-click on a user account and choose Advanced Options), or in Workgroup Manager by adding aliases to the Short Names list.\nFor example, if you had domain.com as your primary domain, domain.co.uk as a host alias, and otherdomain.co.uk as a virtual domain, and your account was \"richard\", you would be reachable as richard@domain.com and richard@domain.co.uk, but would have no address at otherdomain.co.uk.  If you added \"rich@otherdomain.co.uk\" as an alias for your account, you'd then also be reachable at that address (but not at rich@domain.com or rich@domain.co.uk).\nNote: you can also add aliases in the file /etc/aliases (e.g. add the line \"rich@otherdomain.co.uk: richard\" to get the effect I described above).  If you do this, run sudo newaliases and then sudo postfix reload to get the change to take effect.\n", "Q: How to fix iMac losing Wi-Fi connection again and again? My iMac loses its Wifi connection from minute to minute. To make it active again, I have to run \"Assist Me...\"  from the Network preferences panel. \nThis is really, really annoying. \nDoes anyone know what's going on?\nI'm running Mac Os 10.7.4.\n\nA: You may find that another device is causing interference such as a cordless phone or microwave, or even a neighbour's wifi device. Try changing the channel on your wifi router.\nIt may be worth using the \"alt-trick\" to check what's going on with your wifi - when your wifi is connected, mouse over the wifi icon in your system tray, hold down the alt key then click on it. You should see some additional info, like the following:\n\nKeep an eye on the Transmit Rate and RSSI; if they're poor it could be a sign that you need to change the wifi channel.\nYou can also use Lion's hidden diagnostic app to see what could be causing problems for your wifi.\n\nA: My router settings were causing the problems for me. \nThe router was set to 11/B/G/N Mixed mode, and as a result I had constant WiFi dropping. I then set the router to 11/G/N and I have not had a single drop.\n\nA: Perfect fix, just turn off IPv6. That was all my router connection needed!\n\nA: This happened recently to me (after an OS upgrade to 10.15.6). I also suspect that this is because somehow the OS starts to treat the network differently as before. Anyhow, what worked is just removing the network from the list of known networks and reconnecting.\n\nA: Change your OS to either 10.6.8 or to 10.8.4\nIt will help\n", "Q: PDF rendering bug in OS X and iOS I received a PDF by e-mail which is unreadable on my Mac (Lion 10.7.3) and on my iPhone (iOS 5.1.1) but the same PDF renders perfectly on Windows. If I use Chrome on my Mac, (which has its own built in PDF renderer and doesn't use the OS X one), it renders correctly as well. So far it's the only PDF I've ever encountered with the problem, but others are having similar problems.\nI've attached a screenshot of the rendering problem, which is best described as rendering most text as a series of grayscale stepped gradients. Note that the grayscale 'bars' don't correspond directly to the missing lines of text. There's much more text than that.\nAnyone have any ideas?\n\n\nA: The issue would appear to be the font used for the text, a font called \"Corbel\"; it is a Windows only font created by MS and included in all version of Windows Vista and above.\nNormally, PDF's can be created with embedded fonts, in this case the font is not fully embedded, only a subset (e.g. those characters required for the docuemnt)\nFurther research shows that there are a lot of issues with Macs reading PDF's created with Word 2007\nNote, Chrome includes a copy of those fonts as part of it's PDF rendering engine.\n\nA: These PDFs usually contain non english words and in most cases are created using softwares other than adobe acrobat or print to pdf functionality of OS X.\nHowever these could always be opened by acrobat reader for mac.\nhttp://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/product.jsp?product=1&platform=Mac\n", "Q: Apps are muted on my iPad I have a 1st generation iPad and it is doing a very strange thing. All the installed 3rd party apps are muted. Video and music playback works and audio is ok, but all other Apps are muted.\nWhy is this happening?

Remapping a standard key to another standard key is slightly more complicated, but easy enough by editing or creating a keyboard layout. The tricky part is converting a modifier key to a standard one, or vice versa. For that, you need a specialized program.\nYou will need a System Preference Pane called PCKeyboard Hack.\nFirst, go the the Keyboard preference pane, select the Keyboard tab, and click the Modifier Keys... button. In the resulting sheet, set Caps Lock Key to No Action.\n\nThen, install PCKeyboard Hack.\nIn the preference pane it installs, go to Caps Lock, select \"Change Caps Lock\", and set the key code to 48 (the key code for the tab key).\nInstructions on a related question are available on Stack Overflow.\n", "Q: Do I need a step down transformer to charge my Iphone 4 in the UK? What wattage transformer is safe? Do I need a step down transformer to charge my Iphone 4 while traveling in the UK? What wattage transformer is safe to use with my Iphone 4?\n\nA: The UK iPhone charger give 5V DC at 1A (so thats 5W) on an input of 100-240V 50/60Hz with a draw of 0.25A\nIf you have the older two part chargers for iPod or iPhone 1st Gen, then they are fully 100-240V for all world supplies, all you need is the right connector (figure 8) to provide the AC to the charger.\nIf however you have the newer chargers that shipped with the 3G/3GS onwards, even though they are also 100-240V universal chargers, the pins are moulded into the chargers and you will need a plug converter.\nSo no you don't need a step down transformer, but you will need to provide a pin convertor.\n", "Q: Why do so many IMAP providers not work properly with Mail.app? I've been using Mail.app to read my email since 1992 or so, back when it was called NeXTmail. I'm generally pleased with it. Lately, though, I've been having a problem with the IMAP implementation, and specifically with Dreamhost. The problem that I'm having is that Mail.app sometimes doesn't notice when new mail is added to a mailbox, and the only thing I can do is \"rebuild\" the mailbox. This is a problem. Why does it happen? Is there an email provider that doesn't have these problems?\nWell, gmail doesn't have the problem, but it has bother problems.\nSo I would like to understand why this is happening and what I can do about it. Is there an IMAP server that's better than Courier (which is what Dreamhost is using)? Thanks\n\nA: You might want to avoid things like Notes, Calendars & Reminders as these try to create folders on you IMAP server and put data from your Notes.app and Calendar.app in those folders that the IMAP server may not like. At least from Lion up, when you setup email from the System Preferences, it tries to create these other services on the IMAP server.\nNote that IMAP is a standard which means every one that makes an IMAP server might have a different \"standard\"; remember \"The nice thing about standards is that you have so many to choose from.\" --Andy Tanenbaum\nRegarding GMail, personally I have a GMail account as my Apple ID and added iCloud email under that account. So when I set up my iCloud service it only sets up everything on iCloud. Then I setup GMail using the System Preferences, but turn off Notes (keeping Calendar & Reminders). If you leave Notes checked, it puts a \"[IMAP]/Notes\" LABEL in your GMail.\n\nA: \nIs there an IMAP server that's better than Courier (which is what Dreamhost is using)?\n\nWhen I used to run my own mail server, I was much happier when I migrated from qmail + Courier to Postfix + Dovecot.\nHowever, I eventually migrated to Google Apps, and I've never looked back. I know you say that Gmail has \"other problems\", but for me, I found that the benefits far outweighed any quirks/drawbacks. Mail clients of all sorts tend to have pretty good support for it because so many users (and developers!) have Gmail accounts.\n", "Q: Creating a Lion USB Drive from the Lion installer? I have bought Lion on the AppStore and burned an installation DVD from the DMG file (and subsequently lost the DMG file).\nSince DVDs are a bit clumsy and not available on all systems, I want to buy a 4 GB USB Stick and turn it into a Fresh Lion Installation DVD.\nI found some questions about how to create a Recovery USB Drive, but I don't want recovery, I want a fresh install, like the Lion USB Drive on the Apple Store.\nIs there a way to do that from the 10.6 DVD and the Lion download?\n\nA: Simply re-download Lion from the Mac App Store and then use Disk Utility to restore the DMG file to a USB stick.\n", "Q: Why does Lion mount a network volume twice at login? I just set up a new NAS at home and created a few volumes on it, along with enabling  access to those volumes (i.e. enabling the Mac File Service on the NAS), and creating an account for myself.\nOn the iMac, I went into Finder and provided credentials and stored them in my keychain. No problem - I can see and access the NAS volumes.\nI then went into System Preferences, Users & Groups, and added those volumes to my Login Items so that they'd be mounted automatically when I log in. I did this with my previous network storage (a Windows Home Server) and it worked fine.\nHowever, in this case, I'm seeing the volume I want mounted at login get mounted TWICE... the \"Home\" volume, which is unique to my account on the NAS, gets mounted twice and appears twice both on the Desktop as well as in Finder when I click on the NAS' name in the sidebar.\nWhy would a volume get mounted twice like that? Is there some other place I should be looking to find the duplicate mount setting?\n\nA: AFP mounts are tied to both a path and an authentication.\nAn exported volume might have multiple paths.  For example, an OS X server might export its root, the /Users/ folder, and the /Groups/ folder.  Each of these can be mounted separately.  In your case, your NAS may be exporting its volume under multiple paths.  It might even be exporting the same path multiple times.  Check the NAS' settings.\nEach AFP mount is tied to a particular authentication (username/password).  You can mount the same volume/path multiple times using different authentications.  Its possible that the credentials you used in those two different places are subtly different.  Depending on the NAS, it might even come down to whether your long username or short username are used.  Your NAS might not even require a username (only a password) and might ignore whatever username is given.  OS X has no way of knowing that and so two different usernames (long versus short) might produce two different mounts even though they lead to the exact same volume.\n", "Q: 10.7.4 changed my dock background—how do I change it back?

I searched on the internet and it is apparently not possible ( here for instance), or better it is possible but one track at time.\nIt seems so weird that nobody found a workaround or wrote a software which performs this acrion...\nSo, my questions are:\nis it possible to export the whole (ALL TRACKS) garageband project to audacity?\nis it possible to export the whole garageband project to any other multi-track recording software?\n\nA: GarageBand is basically a simple version Logic, in a similar way that iPhoto is a simple version of Aperture.\nWhat you want to do is easily done in Logic, and it also has the functionality within it that you probably wouldn't even need to export it to Audacity at all.\nYou can import anything created in GarageBand directly into Logic.\n(if it's something you can't justify buying Logic to do, you could get someone with Logic to export the GarageBand tracks for you)\n", "Q: What is the recommend location for storing compiled binaries for NON-admins? I know that administrators should be installing such binaries in /usr/local/bin, but what if a user doesn't have admin access? And/or what if a user wanted said binaries to travel with their home folder? Naturally, it would seem that any such location would have to be manually added to the $PATH, but I'm curious to know where other people are putting these?\n\nA: Small programs and scripts in $HOME/bin, and larger packages in $HOME/local subtree (which includes a bin folder)\n", "Q: Does Xcode Has Keyboard ShortCut for going back and forth in programming? In xcode you can go back and forth in your program by swiping the mouse.\nIs there an additional keyboard shortcut for that?\nIn visual studio 2010, for example, you do so by Ctrl - and Ctrl Shift -\nHow do you that in xcode with the keyboard?\n\nA: Yes. The keys in Visual Studio 2010 that you refer to (for others that are unaware) are known as \"Navigate Backward\" and \"Navigate Forward\" and work as described in the the following Microsoft Blog allowing you to quickly move back and forward between places you’ve already been in your code, via a \"Jump to Definiton\" in Xcode, for example.\nThe equivalent keyboard shortcuts in Xcode 4 are:\nNavigate Backward:\nCtrl + ⌘ + Left Cursor\nNavigate Forward:\nCtrl + ⌘ + Right Cursor\n\nA: Are you talking about ⌘-tab?

It's been bugging me for quite some time that switching desktops means the application stays at the desktop you're leaving, then pops up on the desktop you switched to. In Snow Leopard, the application stayed where it was and just floated with you when switching desktops, making it a lot easier to keep working in the same window or even to keep watching a movie. This of course applies only to applications you've assigned to all desktops.\nI hope this will be fixed in Mountain Lion and if so I will update to that immediately, but is there any way this can be resolved right now, in Lion?\nAny and all help will be very much appreciated! Also, I'm sorry if this has been asked before, I've done a bunch of searches but they came up empty.\n\nA: @RadicalRaid, how I have used the various desktops is to categorize by the projects. so Desktop 1 would be all  project A stuff and Desktop B would be all project B stuff. And if there is a workflow involved then D1 would be process1 and D2 be process2 so on and so forth. That helps me to *focus on a *project basis rather than application basis. On the Mountain Lion Mission control the animations and gestures are much smoother and more organized so that really makes this type of focusing much easier and usable. Hope that helps.\n\nA: Unfortunately this has not changed in Mountain Lion... (At leased not in the latest bata)\nI do not believe this is possible for any third party app to accomplish. Apple would have to build this directly into the OS.\n", "Q: How to transfer a file from iPhone to computer when there is no Internet? I have a word doc saved as an attachment in my inbox. I can read it using my iPhone 4S, but I can't edit it, and anyway, I want to edit it on my MacBook Pro. But there is (was) no Internet where I was, and so I couldn't access the file on my computer. Is there any way to transfer the file from my phone to computer using USB?\n\nA: If you can transfer the document to a general-purpose app that \"knows\" about files (like GoodReader, Air Sharing, or iBooks), you should be able to access it from the file-handling dialog from within iTunes. \nMost computers can create an ad-hoc WiFi network; using this, you'd use a network-sharing app (like Air Sharing) to mount a disk from your iPhone and transfer the files to your computer.\n\nA: The PhoneView program can read files from iOS devices through USB and get them to your mac in most cases.\n", "Q: Is the iPad Smart Cover flammable? I've looked everywhere for the answer to this. And it is honestly a important question.  Is the iPad Smart Cover flammable?\n\nA: No. In your case of the leather cover - I can't imagine any circumstance where someone would call leather flammable. (or inflammable or combustible or any other word which means \"easily set on fire\")\nLeather is what blacksmiths, welders and others working in hot or hazardous environments use for flexible protection when asbestos or other fireproof materials are overkill.\nI haven't seen a good chemical analysis of the makeup of the polyurethane cover, but in general urethanes begin to break down chemically at the same temperature that paper burns, so even if it doesn't ignite, you might not want to expose your smart cover to burning temperatures.\nNeither is going to ignite easily or need handling typical of a \"flammable\" substance.\n\nA: Pretty much everything burns given the right circumstances, but definitions of flammability rest on a lot of assumptions about specific environmental conditions.  If your question boils down to,  \"Under what circumstances can you expect to fear combustion on the assumption that the cover is attached to an iPad?\", then we can proceed with some well-reasoned speculation.\nI would say that if you are keeping in line with the operating requirements of the iPad itself, then without exposure to naked flame (which would likely fall outside said requirements) I can't see a) how it could catch fire, and b) why you would be worried about it rather than the iPad...\nSo, assuming that you haven't managed to get a bulk load of smart covers that you intend to insulate your central heating pipes with, what is your specific concern with regards to flammability?\nAlso, we need to take into consideration the colour of your smart cover.  As you know, darker colours absorb heat, and lighter ones reflect it.  A black smart cover being used to protect your iPad from a very naughty child with a magnifying glass and a line of sight to the Great Glowing Orb in the Sky (or GGLOITS as we worship it round here) may be able to acheive combustion more quickly than if you used a white one.  Also, firing that bad boy up and playing severals hours of Infinity Blade 2 whilst charging the battery might kickstart the combustion process if you can get if running hot like a Macbook running Flash Adverts.\nBut then we should not forget that the smart cover is more than just a nice piece of bendy screen protection, but has magnets and metal parts as well.  Will these burn, or will they merely melt?\nSo, yes, getting silly now, but figured someone had to do it.\n", "Q: Can I use my iPhone charger with my iPad? My iPad 1 charger was burned because of high voltage, so it stopped working. Currently, I am using an iPhone 3GS mini charger. It charges the iPad but only very slowly when the iPad is on but the display is off.\n\n\n*\n\n*Will it make any problem if I continue using mini charger for charging my iPad 1 or do I need to buy a new charger?\n\n*If yes, what is the price of new charger in India?\n\n\nA: The 5W, 10W and 12W chargers are all capable of charging an iPhone. The wattage is made up of two variables - voltage and ampage (or amperage if you're American). The wattage also states the MAXIMUM output of the power block.\nAll three chargers have the same voltage output (5V), the difference comes with the amp output (1A, 2A and 2.4A). For the sake of argument, let's ignore the voltage because it's not really relevant to this discussion (seeing as all the chargers give out 5V).\nWhen using a 5W power supply to charge an iPhone, you will be drawing the maximum current available (1A). If you use a 10W, you'll pull the SAME amount of amps (still 1A), and with a 12W....do you get the point yet? \nTwo things limit the charging time of your device:\n\n\n*\n\n*The MAXIMUM output of the charger\n\n*The MAXIMUM power draw of the device\nIf you are using the EXACT right charger (same voltage and ampage as the device) then it will draw the maximum amps/watts available. If you use a higher rated power supply you will STILL pull the same amount of amps/watts but it will no longer be the maximum amount the charger can put out. You will NOT charge your device any faster. A higher-rated power supply will NOT damage your device, because the device will only draw as much current (amps) as it needs. The charger will not force the little electrons into the device any faster than it can handle.\nOn the other hand, if you put a higher-rated device on a lower-rated charger you will get the following results:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your device will take a LOT longer to charge. In fact, it may appear not to be charging at all. Experiment for yourself: plug a new iPad 4 into an old USB 1.0 or 2.0 port overnight and see how much charge you've gained in the morning.\n\n*You've heard of \"trickle charge\" right? This is where the current being fed into the internal battery isn't actually enough to properly charge the battery. The battery will be discharging power at almost the same rate at which it is charging. Yes, this will damage your battery over time. You saw it a lot in the original Nokia USB-charging phones - the batteries died after a few years and would no longer maintain charge. There's nothing wrong with doing this as a once-off, for emergencies, or on an irregular basis, but you will do progressive damage to your device if you keep doing this.\nAt home I have an iPhone 4, 4s, 5 and iPad 4. They all get charged off the same power pack - a 12W (5V, 2.4A) power block that came with my iPad 4. All of my devices charge, none of them have been damaged.\nTLDR;\n\n\n*\n\n*Using a higher-rated power supply on an iPhone won't damage it or charge it any faster.\n\n*Using a lower-rated power supply on an iPad will charge it very slowly and do progressive damage to the battery.\n\n\nMoral to the story: buy a 12W charger and use it for all your devices to save carrying multiple chargers.\n\nA: As per the documentation on the Apple Store site:\n\nApple 5W USB Power Adapter\n  iPhones supported: Original, 3G, 3GS, 4, 4S, 5\n  iPods supported: Touch 1st-5th gen, some of the classic models, Nano 2nd-7th edition, Shuffle 2nd-4th edition\n  iPads supported: mini (and none other)\n\nand:\n\nApple 12W USB Power Adapter\n  iPhones supported, iPods supported: Same as for 5W\n  iPods additional: Touch 1st gen, Nano 1st gen, A lot more of the classic models\n  iPads supported: mini, 1st-4th generation\n\nSo while you can use the 12W charger to charge both iPhones and iPads, you can not use the 5W charger to charge the iPad, except for the mini.\nNote: As others have suggested here, it may (seem to) work, but if you experience any problems, like a burnt out charger and/or iDevice, having used an unsupported combination is sure to put a dent in the warranty plan for the damaged unit.\nNote 2: Since the two chargers sell for the same price on the Apple Store, if you have to buy one, buy the 12W charger.\n\nA: Yes, you can use your iPhone charger with the iPad.\nThis should not damage the iPad or the charger.\nHowever, since the iPad is provided with a lower current the charging takes longer. Both the iPhone and iPad charge with 5V, but the iPad charger provides 2A while the iPhone charger only provides 1A.\nThis is why it takes longer to charge. You should completely turn off the iPad in order to speed up the charging process.\n\nA: The official response to the \"Can I...\" question is yes.  \nHowever, here are the issues.  Using  5W charger on a device that requires a 10W charger, can and will damage the battery.  It produces what is called a \"trickle charge\" which drains as it charges.  Even when the iPad is turned off.  This leads the smart sensors in the cells to go haywire and not know when it is fully charged or not.  This often leads to people seeing their battery charge capacity lessen much faster over time.  \nThe blocks used in the chargers are what regulate the wattage.  A 5W charger cannot produce the needed 10W to properly charge the  iPad, however, the iPd 10W charger, CAN and will regulate itself for the 5W device.  \nWhen combined with the proper components, this 10W charger usage on the iPhone, will not cause any damage or overheating in the phone, unless the device has already been damaged, typically via water/liquid.  (proper components: Apple Charging block, Apple USB/Lightning cable, and undamaged dock/lightning port)\nWith the lightning cable and the iPhone 5/iPad 4 this will also charge the iPhone 5 faster than the 5W block.  Added bonus.  \nEDIT: Sorry, the 10W is the \"old\" adapter (which BTW still works for the latest iPads) though they now deliver with a 12W adapter. \n\nA: Sure you can. I am doing that quite often, and even though it takes longer to charge, for travelling, when I carry both my iPhone and iPad, it is nice to only carry the small iPhone charger.\n\nA: \nIf yes, what is the price of new charger in India?\n\nYou can find an Apple Retailer in your area to get pricing on a new Power Adapter. \n\nA: No, you can not do that.\nhttp://gaffeycat.blogspot.com/2012/07/can-i-use-my-iphone-charger-with-my.html\n\nA: No the iPhone charger will burn out.\nThe iPad charger is best for iPad and iPhone charger is best for iPhone.\n\nA: It's not advised to charge the iPad 3rd Generation or 4th Generation with iPhone charger. I'm not sure of iPad 2.\nThe following is the power capacity of the chargers:\n* iPhone -> 5 Watts or 1A\n* iPad 3 -> 10 Watts or 2A\n* iPad 4 -> 12 Watts or 2.4A\nIt's not advisable to use iPhone charger for iPad since it chunks out only half the required power. Eventhough it charges the iPad very slowly, overtime this might damage the battery. There are a lot many chances for this.\nYou may use your iPad 3/4 charger to charge your iPhone - this delivers express charging, but again this might damage the battery. I use express charging very rarely (only when i'm in a hurry) otherwise always use my iPhone charger or PC.\nIf you've got iPad 3, then you can get a iPad 4 charger to speeden up the charging.\n", "Q: Apple iPad 10W USB Power Adapter can you tell me what are the specifications of Apple iPad 10W USB Power Adapter i.e. power input,output,volt.ampher,etc\n\nA: Input\n\n\n*\n\n*Voltage 100V-240V AC\n\n*Frequency: 50/60Hz\n\n*Wattage: 0.45A\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n*\n\n*Voltage : 5V DC\n\n*Current: up to 2A\n\n*Wattage: up to 10W\n\n", "Q: iPhone Proxy auto-configuration with username / password I'm looking for a way to include the username and password to an auto configurated setting for proxies on iOS. Any ideas?\n\nA: HTTP GET logins have you include your username and password in the URL. For example, if you're using the fictional proxy that's located at www.an-example-proxy.com/proxy-login, and you were instructed to use port 3333, and your username is foo, and your password is bar, then you would put http://foo:bar@www.an-example-proxy.com:3333/proxy-login in the URL field on the Auto tab under Settings > WiFi > ESSID (Network Name) > HTTP Proxy (this doesn't sound too much like an automatically configured proxy to me, though, but this should get you logged on).\n", "Q: Image Editor with accurate dimensions I've recently purchased an iPad and I'm looking for an app that will allow me to resize and crop photos to specific dimensions.\nThere are plenty of editing apps that I have seen but nothing seems to have the ability to edit to set dimensions.\nFor example I have a photo that is 800x600 and I need to edit it to be 660x300.\n\nA: A program called Everclipper Plus would appear to meet your requirements, however this is not a full featured Image Editor, just purely one that provides a set of correctional tools.\nFrom the blurb\n\nFeatures\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Resizing.

I've now noticed that hitting the single button on my Etymotic HF-2's no longer play/pauses the media in the active player but launches iTunes if it's not running, and play/pauses iTunes content if iTunes is running. Historically on Leopard, pressing this button would cause the active player to play/pause, be it Spotify, VLC or any other media player (Though spotify and VLC are my most used players)\nAnyone know how to return to this behavior?\n\nA: You can do this with ControllerMate:\n\nAnd a little little AppleScript (each line for each function):\ntell application \"Spotify\" to playpause\ntell application \"Spotify\" to next track\ntell application \"Spotify\" to previous track\n\nIf you open QuickTime Player it will silently ignore the play/pause button and prevent iTunes from being opened, if you don't iTunes will still try to play something.\nAnother solution to prevent iTunes from starting is to disable the 'Remote Control Daemon', how to do this is explained in detail on superuser.\n\nA: You have to combine both answers posted here.\nConfigure ControllerMate as described by Luke for your program of choice\nand apply the Play Button iTunes Patch mentioned by Stephen.\nThen you can control your app of choice by using a headphone remote control without starting iTunes.\n\nA: I believe this will fix your problem MMFix.

The device reports \"Check if you have Internet Connectivity and try again\"\niPhone 4 with iOS 5.1\nMacBook Pro with Lion 10.7.4\nAny insights into how this can be resolved?\n\nA: I use my MacBook Pro to share internet to my iPhone and my friends' iPod Touch. \nMake sure that you're using WPA2 to secure your network, not WEP- I have had issues connecting my iPhone to WEP networks, and they're not only less secure but the password is more annoying to type anyway. \nOther than that, your IP schemes are also not compatible. You need to set the devices to have the same IP scheme; if your WiFi is set to a 192.168.1.1 address, your iPhone needs to be 192.168.1.2-255. Setting both to DHCP would help a lot here. \nFor my setup, I just left everything as DHCP and don't have any issues. \n\nA: You may need to check the firewall setting on your MBP.  In System Settings -> Security -> Firewall.\nWhen I was doing this I just disabled the firewall and that seemed to work. \n\nA: I advise you to onfigure your iPhone to use an IP address attributed\nwith DHCP.\nWhen you turn InternetSharing on, this will turn on 2 processes on your\nMacBook Pro:\nbootpd\nnatpmpd\n\nThe 1st one is also a DHCP server and will attribute a predefined IP address to your iPhone.\nIf this does solve your problem, please say so.\nIf not, please stay on DHCP configuration, since this is the way it should work with InternetSharing. In this last bad case, this is simply the evidence that the problem is somewhere else, and some more investigation will be necessary.\nAs an exemple, once DHCP is settled on, you can check within your\nsystem log on your MacBook Pro that your iPhone gets a correct IP address.\nJust type the following command within a Terminal or xterm:\ngrep DHCP /var/log/system.log\n\n", "Q: How to determine original location of file that is currently in the Trash?

(See figure below.)\n(I had hoped that this information would be available through running \"Get Info\" on the file, but I did not find it there.)\n\n\nA: Data containing a file's original location before being placed in the Trash is keep in the .DS_Store file in the ~/.Trash folder.\nSince the trash folder is hidden it can not normally be found using the finder application.  The easiest way to find this file is by using the Terminal and entering the following commands.\n$cd ~/.Trash\n$open -e .DS_Store\n\nThis will open the file in TextEdit.  From there you should be able to quickly search for the file by its name and its original path.\nIts seems that files in .DS_Store follow the pattern of:\nFILE_NAME ptbLustr ORIGINAL_PATH_TO_FILE\n\nNote spaces are added just for readability.\n\nA: The information about the original location is stored within DS_Store file. In older version of OS X it was stored in plain text, and now in binary format. These formats aren't documented by Apple, however, there is a tool created by Wim L which can read it.\nThe tool is written in Perl, Mac::Finder::DSStore project provides routines for reading and writing the .DS_Store files generated by the macOS.\nAs per initial commit, the above tool is based on Mark Mitrovai's work plus author own investigation.\nUsing examples/dsstore_dump.pl would attempt to dump a store file's records in a more human-readable format.\nExample usage:\n$ perl dsstore_dump.pl ~/.Trash/.DS_Store\n\n    &makeEntries(\"foo.png\",\n        ptbL => \"Users/username/Desktop/\",\n        ptbN => \"foo.png\"\n    ),\n\nSee: dsstore repo at hhhh.org and older repo at GitHub.\n\nA: There is a great write up and some easier solutions posted at http://ponderthebits.com/2017/01/mac-dumpster-diving-identifying-deleted-file-references-in-the-trash-ds_store-files-part-1/ \nIncluding this Terminal one-liner to convert a .DS_Store file to (mostly) text: \nxxd -p <path/to/.DS_Store> | sed 's/00//g' | tr -d '\\n' | sed 's/\\([0-9A-F]\\{2\\}\\)/0x\\1 /g' | xxd -r -p | strings | sed 's/ptb[LN]ustr//g'\n\n\nA: 'Put Back' the File, Use the search function to search for the file, When you find your file, Right-Click it and select \"Open Enclosing Folder\"\n", "Q: How can I upgrade OS X Snow Leopard 10.6.0 to 10.6.6 I need install an older version of XCode.

For years, we had our separate devices and PCs where our music libraries resided. However, recently, I activated iCloud for my new iPhone and iPad and now all of our data has meshed. I have her contacts, she has my contacts, music, etc. My question is how can I set up a distinct Apple ID for her but not have her lose her contacts, music, settings, etc.?\n\nA: If you set up a new AppleID account you will not have access to items bought from the iTunes store. But iCloud accounts are separate from AppleID accounts; she can have a unique iCloud account with her own contacts, email, and other settings, but will need to use the shared AppleID to have access to the apps, music, books, movies, etc... bought from iTunes.\nThere are some ugly hackish ways to get around this, but they sound like a waste of time and very sketchy to me.\n\nA: If you don't have too much music (you were talking about 25%), you could search for a tool called iRip. Put your music on an iPod /iPhone, plug it into your pc and use iRip on it. I think they have a trial version for free that should do the work for this one session.\n\nA: The easiest way is to use a backup and an iCloud removal to transfer all the contacts from the cloud to local contacts.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open iCloud settings and turn off each bin of data, one by one.

Is it possible (and how) to specify which devices should be called?\nFor example, when one of us travels, we want to be contacted on the phone, from the computer, and when the other travels, the reverse.\nI suppose we can turn it on and off on the various devices, just wondering if there was another way. (What happens when you forget?).\nThanks\n\nA: When you Facetime, the caller chooses either your phone number or the email address associated with your Apple ID. If it chooses the email address, it will ring both your computer, and your iPhone (as well as any other devices you have logged in with that Apple ID such as an iPad), and you may answer on either device. If the caller chooses your phone number, then just your phone will ring. In this case, the caller could use this to choose which device to ring you on.\nAs I'm sure you are already are aware, the device must be connected to wifi in order for it to ring (I believe there are cellular company outside the US that allow Facetime over the air as well), otherwise it will just ring and ring on the caller side without ever ringing you.\n\nA: Our devices were seeming to receive calls at random too... but here is what I have figured out so far. \n1) Each device you want to receive incoming calls has to be 'signed in' (e.g. if your location, IP address, etc, has changed because you're travelling you may need to go to the Facetime/preferences, and sign in again. (that should get the laptop receiving)\n2) Each device can (in the settings) turn facetime on or off (on the iPhone it's just Settings, scroll down to FaceTime, select it, and set the slider to on or off, on the computer it is on the main menu bar under FaceTime and you select 'Turn FaceTime On' and 'Turn Facetime Off'. \nIf you turn Facetime off on your home computer before you leave your wife won't have to listen to it ringing in the next room, and as long as once you've got your new IP from the hotel wi-fi, and you 'sign in' each time you are somewhere new (on bar on the right side of facetime) that should do the trick.

This way, by touching that email, it would ring on the related iPad, and by touching on the phone number, it would ring on the related iPhone. Now, with the new iOS7, no matter how FaceTime is set on the iPhone or iPad, on the contacts, there is just ONE choice for FaceTime, which, when touched, rings on both related iPhone and iPad. I don't know of any solution, and I assume is one of many iOS7 bugs or oversights. Apple should open the door for customers feedback through direct emails.\n\nA: I think information on this page can solve this problem.\nBasically, you can add additional emails to use for FaceTime, and thus distinguish different devices with the same Apple ID emails.\nhttp://ipad.about.com/od/iPad_Guide/ss/How-To-Use-FaceTime-On-The-iPad_2.htm\n", "Q: Exponential CD burn times in iTunes 10.6.1 (7) on OS X 10.6.8 The more I try put on a CD and the closer I get to the 80 minute mark, the longer it takes to burn with it on occasion never finishing, the time rises exponentially. I never try and burn more than 80 minutes (not sure it will let you anyway).\nIs this a known issue?\nI'm using the standard 'burn from playlist' method.\nAlso sometimes it goes nuts and starts generating random 'time remaining' times, changing every couple of seconds (see below).\n\n\nA: According to Wikipedia, the original playing time of an audio CD is 74 minutes.\nLonger play durations are achieved by \"squeezing\" the data tracks closer together. Also, because CDs are written from the inside out, the write speed is much faster on the outer sides of the disc — bigger diameter means more distance travelled in the same time.\nSo squeezing plus faster writing needs more precision. It’s likely that an older CD writer will struggle (on a pre-OS-level) with the precision requirements, leading to claims of absurd burning times. I think you will be on the safe side when burning shorter CDs. I hope this helps!\n", "Q: When do iTunes Connect Stats update? I've read in quite a few places that sales trend reports update anywhere between 3AM - 5AM Cupertino time once a day.\nBut what about other stats?\n\n\n*\n\n*When do app ratings update?\n\n*When do customer reviews update?\n\nA: Both of those usually update almost instantly. Sometimes it may take a few minutes, but I've experienced instant results from people posting ratings and reviews.\nThanks!\n", "Q: How can I tell whether a drive is asleep? Is there an application or command-line utility for Mac OS X to query a hard-disk to see if it is 'asleep' or 'awake' right now? (i.e. as controlled by Energy Saver / pmset disk sleeping preferences). Note that I'm after the current sleep state, not just whether the system will put the disk to sleep when its idle.\nI have two hard drives in my MacBook Pro, an SSD for the System and a much larger \"regular\" mechanical drive for various large files I don't often use.\nI'd like the physical drive to be put to sleep when not in use, and in general stay asleep unless I'm actually using it. I'd like this to be automatic, rather than mounting and unmounting the drive on a regular basis.\nI've set up Energy Saver to put the disk to sleep, but I can't actually tell when the drive is asleep or awake (even pressing my ear against the laptop its hard to tell what's fan noise vs disk noise), so I don't know if I've appropriately divided my files between the two drives.\nIs there some way of querying the drive to see if it's asleep, without actually waking it, so I can monitor this to see if its generally asleep or not?\nI guess an alternate, equivalent question is, What is the Mac OS X equivalent of the Linux command:\nhdparm -C <device>\n\nNote: It need not be an exact, command-line equivalent. Any means of finding out would be useful.\n\nSome places I've looked so far, without success:\n\n\n*\n\n*The built-in Disk Utility and System Information applications don't seem to provide any information on sleep/wake state of drives.\n\n*pmset -g (built-in command) offers various query functions, but the events seem to be about the system sleep events, not disks.\n\n*smartctl -i -n sleep (smartmontools via MacPorts) seems to always think all drives are asleep for me! (would be interesting to hear if this is true for others)\n\n\nA: No, there isn't any utility or tool to find out this kind of information.\nps. I'm posting this as an answer, because I have researched this question few months back and I'll be more than happy if someone proves me wrong.\nEdit: Seems to be the same conclusion as the developers of SmartMonTools based on their response to this issue, in which they claim the SmartMonTools' output of drives always sleeping is a bug, and have now corrected it to note that Power Mode is not available on Mac OS X / Darwin.\n", "Q: Can I install Mac OS X Lion (10.7) on my Windows XP PC? I am using Windows XP, now I want to install Mac OS X Lion (10.7). My problem is I want both operating systems. Is it possible? Will it be possible to use Mac OS X Lion (10.7) and XP simultaneously?\n\nA: Questions that detail how to actually installation of OS X on non-Apple hardware are off topic due to the violation of the Apple EULA, but let's see if we can have a good general discussion of the issues and assume everyone is here to learn where the virtualization issues lie. \nUsing non-Apple hardware\nYour only option is a hackint0sh.\nUsing a Mac computer\nIf you were using a Mac computer, you can use both operating systems:\n\n\n*\n\n*simultaneously: \nOS X (host), XP (virtual machine)\n\n*dual boot via bootcamp:\nOS X, XP ← this will allow XP full access to the hardware\nNote:\n\n\n*\n\n*Bootcamp in Lion does not support Windows XP. (Thanks to @DanBarrett for mentioning this)\n\n\nIt only supports:\n\n\n*\n\n*Microsoft Windows 7 Home Premium, Microsoft Windows 7 Professional, or Microsoft Windows 7 Ultimate with Boot Camp 4.0. Check this list for information on 64-bit support.\n\n\n\nA: There is a second way you can run on Windows hardware, although it pretty clearly seems in violation of the Apple EULA (at least to a non-laywer).\nYou can download and install VirtualBox. It will emulate the Mac OS X hardware and you can run Mac OS X on your Windows (this tutorial mentions Snow Leopard, but Lion will work as well).\nIt isn't easy (or recommended...) but this solution is pretty close to the answer you are looking for. \nPlease note, although they say you can download a copy of Snow Leopard/Lion, this is illegal. You'll have to buy a legal copy of the installation disk in order to do this legally... \n\nA: You can install Mac on your Windows computer using VMWare Player, which is a non-commercial software. It's easy, quick, and you can get a Mac OS X running within minutes.\n", "Q: How do you get a program to load earlier when you log in to Mac OS X? I'm running Mac OS X Lion 10.7.4 on a late 2011 MBP. I use a Logitech mouse with it, and rely on the Logitech Control Center software to configure the mouse speed/acceleration (I prefer it over the Mac OS X mouse acceleration).\nThe problem is that every time I boot up and log in, the mouse pointer will be extremely slow for about a minute, because it takes a minute before Mac OS X loads the Logitech Control Center. Is there any way to get Mac OS X to load it earlier? \nEDIT in response to gentmatt's answer:\nYou are right, when I uncheck the \"Reopen all windows when logging back in\" box, then the Logitech Control Center loads almost immediately when I log in.\nHowever, when I check that box, it doesn't take the Mac a whole minute to reload all my windows.  For example, I just tried it with 6 Firefox windows open and Activity Monitor open.  When I logged back in, all 6 Firefox windows and the Activity Monitor finished loading in no more than 10 seconds, however the Logitech Control Center still took about 1 full minute before it loaded.  I was watching the processes in the Activity Monitor, and during that minute there was no activity at all while I waited for the Logitech Control Center to load, and then all of a sudden 7 different processes loaded at the same time (backgroundinstruments, warmd_agent, imagent, AirPort Base Station Agent, Logitech Control Center Daemon, EpsonLowInkReminderAgent, and iTunes Helper).  Why would those processes take a minute before they loaded, when the Firefox windows and Activity Monitor finished loading after just 10 seconds?\nEDIT (June 3):\n@gentmatt: Do you run Firefox?  I just noticed that Firefox seems to be causing this problem.  When I restart with the \"Reopen windows when logging back in\" box and still have Firefox running, then I'll get the 60 second delay for the Logitech Control Center and other processes when I log in.  But if I quit Firefox before I restart, then there's no 60 second delay when I log in again and the Logitech Control Center and other processes load immediately when I log in.  I just tried restarting without Firefox open, but with some Chrome and Safari windows still open, and when I logged in again, the Logitech Control Center loaded almost immediately before the Chrome and Safari windows had finished reloading.  So the 60 second delay definitely seems related to Firefox.\n\nA: The only way I can think of is to add the Logitech Control Center app in the list of app which launched at startup.  \nPreferences < Accounts < Login Items\n \nBut considering the fact it takes your Mac about a minute to load this app, I'm guessing the app is already in the list.\nThe fact that you have to wait a minute or so means your Mac is still booting (and loading all the software). I can't think of a way to increase this speed beside adding a faster drive or adding more RAM. But that's quite radical (and expensive) just to make your boot process a tiny bit faster. \nAn other thing you can do to speed up the boot process is to limit the apps your Mac has to open automatically (so it will get to the Logitech Control Center faster) and to clear your desktop (so you Mac don't have to waste time and RAM by loading all these icons and shortcuts).\nThis and more tips, are listed in this (rather old) article. \n\nA: I assume that you check the \"reopen all windows upon next login\" window when you shut down. I have had the same problem.\nThe workaround is to disable reopen on login. Then the login items will be loaded much faster. I'm not sure if this is a bug and if Apple is working on it. But I'm sure that this is in fact your problem if you rely on a 3rd-party-app to use your mouse properly.\nHowever, you should also check the settings in System Preferences → Mouse → Tracking Speed.\n\nA: Something you may consider is loading all your login items with an AppleScript as such:\ntell app \"Logitech....\" to activate  \ndelay 10 --you don't have to have this, but it spaces out your items\ntell app \"Another app\" to activate\ndelay 10\ntell app \"3rd app\" to activate\n\nEtc. To save this as an application, in the save dialog, select \"Application\" for \"File Format:\"\n\nTo open the application on login, just add it like you would add any other application.\n", "Q: Rules for from account in Apple Mail I happily use mail with several accounts. When I send a new email I often forget to choose the correct 'From' account. Is there a mail plugin that allows to set the default 'From' account using some rules.\nOne example could be: if the recipient ends in '@example.com' use the work account.\nOr as an alternative is there a way to change the 'From' dropdown menu using a key combination? (this would not solve the case when I forget to set it but would at least speed up the process)\n\nA: If you use the unified inbox then this can be a problem. If you expand the mailboxes and read them from those, then you can set-up Mail to send using the account for that mailbox.\nI suppose this may require remembering to select the correct mailbox in a similar way to remembering to select the from account though.\n\n\nA: I struggle with the same problems. The answer is that there currently unfortunately is neither a plugin nor a hook for manually solving this problem.\nFor details look here: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/67082/93032\nSome workarounds for the problem can be found here: Mail.app extension to avoid sending email from the wrong account?\n", "Q: How to get the iPod Nano 5th gen battery health Is there any way I can get the battery health of an iPod, specifically a 5th gen Nano?\nI've done a little bit of googling and I don't think there is a way, but I though I could give it a try here.\nI would like to buy a used iPod Nano (5th gen), but I am worried that the battery might not last very long, so I was wondering if there is any way I could check that (other than playing a song over and over again).\nThanks\n\nA: Apple have software at the Genius Bars which can diagnose faults, read the current voltage, and assess the health of devices but I've never been able to find a copy before.\nThere is a diagnostic mode for iPods which you can access by resetting the device with Menu+Select and then upon seeing the Apple logo, press Rewind+Select. There are many tests on there including some battery ones within the Power section, however I doubt this will tell you much without a lot of research.\nBasically, no, there's no easy way to test the battery other than playing a song over and over as you've stated. Perhaps you could get a quick written agreement with the seller that you'd expect the battery to be at least 80% as good as the expected battery life or something along those lines, and if not they will refund you?\n", "Q: Circuit Simulator for iPad What is the best electronics circuit simulator app for iPad where I can draw a circuit and monitor its behaviour? \n\nA: There are a few, if you are a Spice fanatic then I'd give this one a try first:\nSpicy Schematics Free is a trial version of the full iPad app, Spicy Schematics\nCircuit Lab HD and DCircuit Lab HD are two fully featured node analysis simulators, the first is an analog simulator in the Spice mould, the second purely for Digital gate and logic combinatory analysis.\n\nA: Although I personally haven't used it the iCircuit app seems to provide everything you are looking for.\n\nA: Disclosure: I am affiliated with the company that makes and sells this app.\nThe paid version of our iPad app named Spicy Schematics would be best as it has more features of the original SPICE circuit emulation software, but you can also try the free version if you are not ready to buy.\nLastly, we also have PC, Mac and Web app versions of the tool, so that may sway your decision to use our iPad version.

Is there any way at all to use the mouse cursor to move the cursor in terminal, like click where you want it and press a key to move it there?\nThis is one of the most annoying things I've ever found using the terminal\nI know Ctrl+A will move to the beginning of the line but sometimes these commands are so long\n\nA: Try option-click, that is, click with option pressed.\nThis works on the command line and also in screen editors, such as vi and nano.\noption-click just sends the appropriate escape sequences to move the cursor to anywhere in the terminal screen. (To see this working, try it with cat.)\n", "Q: How does the Facebook Camera App know who I am the first time I go into it? If you have the Facebook App on your iOS device, and you download the Facebook Camera App, the first time you go into Facebook Camera, you get:\nContinue as David W.\n(or whatever you're name is)\nIn iOS, all apps are suppose to store documents under App specific folders. There is a keychain for storing passwords and other credentials, but again, this is application specific. I even found documentation explaining that although Safari can download certificates, they must be imported into particular apps. The idea is to sandbox each app, so a security issue in one app doesn't affect the security of the entire device.\nSo, how does the Facebook Camera app know who I am if it can't get data from the Facebook App itself, and can't use Facebook App's data from the keychain?\n\nA: This was covered by MG Siegler over at Paris Lemon last week, the explanation of how it does it is here.\nBasically, iOS provides it's own Keychain functionality and if you know the Keychain key, then you can save and read data between apps that you write.  In this case, the Facebook Camera app is reading data saved by the Facebook app.\n\nA: As it turns out, apps can share keychain data to each other. \nThere is a thing called iOS Keychain and it makes sure you don't have to log in every time you open the FaceBook app for example.\nAnd considering the fact both the FaceBook app and the Camera app are from the same company, I can imagine it shouldn't be too hard to exchange the stored password. \nIf you want more specific detail about how to use the iOS Keychain, I can recommend this tutorial.\nBut there seems to be more then meets the eye. Apps can even access some phone data, as described in this post. Some API's of the iOS SDK aren't protected and can be accessed without any authentication (like the name of your iPhone,...).\nIt's all a matter of cleverness :) And engineers at FaceBook, Twitter, FourSquare,... seems to be very good at it!\n", "Q: MacBook Pro: OS battery indicator doesn't match hardware battery indicator I recently upgraded my MBP to Lion, and now the battery indicator in the menubar at the top of the screen constantly shows \"(Charged)\", even when the indicator on the side shows almost empty. Any ideas on what's going on or what I can do to fix it?\nEdit: It does have an internal battery.\n\nA: If your MacBook Pro has an internal battery - seek service as they are supposed to self-calibrate and not need any sort of maintenance.\nFor reference: Apple Portables: Calibrating your computer's battery for best performance\nIf your model has a removable battery, those are older and the Mac needs you to periodically run a calibration where you charge it to full and leave it connected to power for two or so hours. Then disconnect power and run it down over a day or two - never connecting to power. Eventually, it will go to sleep and then you leave it for 4-5 hours in sleep to finally reach the low voltage shut off.\nThis will recalibrate the sensor for full and empty and perhaps fix the OS reporting a different charge level than reality. As the battery ages, the \"guess\" to how much charge capacity is left at a certain voltage level changes. This calibration run should be done every 6 to 10 months if you care to have a more accurate OS battery estimate. Of course, if there is a failure in the battery or the hardware - that will prevent this from working and you will again be seeking service for a repair.\nIf you are not near a support center - you could try the discharge run on a newer Mac with the newer battery.\n\nA: Got this from the tech support folks at work, and it solved the problem for me:\n\nShutdown.\nImmediately after the startup tone play, hold down Command, Option, P and R.\nHold until the 2nd Tones, then release.\n\n", "Q: Does the upgrade to OS X Lion include iMovie 11? I have a system with Snow Leopard and iMovie 09.\nIf I upgrade my system to OSX Lion, will it also upgrade my iMovie 09 to iMovie 11?\n\nA: No, iMovie is part of the iLife suite of programs, not the OS itself.

My super old desktop is currently having problems connecting to the Internet. \nIs there a way that I can update my iPhone to the new operating system without my computer connecting to the internet? \nI'm afraid that if I connect my iPhone to my newish laptop to do the upload that it will delete all of the files and songs from my phone since they are not on the laptop's harddrive. I have not updated my phone in almost a year due to this problem.\n\nA: If your iOS device is on version 5.0 or higher, then yes, you can do it directly from the handset by going to Settings/General/Software Update.\nIf you're on iOS 4.x then no, you will need a computer to do this.\nTo upgrade in your situation, I would recommend the following steps:\n1) On your new laptop, open iTunes, and in the preferences on the devices tab, make sure Prevent iPods, iPhones, and iPads from syncing automatically\n2) Plug your iPhone in to the new laptop, and in iTunes, select the iPhone on the left pane.\n3) Click Check for update.\nIt should find a newer version, and start to download the file. You can now disconnect your iPhone from your new laptop.\nOnce it has downloaded this file, you should be able to find it on an OSX system in your home folder/library/iTunes/iPhone Software Updates. On Windows it should be in your user profile folder\\Application Data\\Apple Computer\\iTunes\\iPhone Software Updates.\nYou can copy this file to your old computer, and then plug your iPhone in to that.\nOn a Mac, hold the Option key (alt on modern keyboards) (shift on Windows) and click Check for update. You should now be able to manually navigate to the ipsw file you just copied over.\nIt should now start the update process on your iPhone.\n\nA: If you are already running iOS 5, you can download and update your iPhone just by going to\nSettings > General > Software Update and tapping on Download and Install.\nYour device will do the download so a computer with iTunes can be skipped.\nIf your not, then you could try downloading the IPSW on a someone's computer, and then updating your device with iTunes by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch iTunes\n\n*Option+Click the Update button\n\n*Select the IPSW update file you downloaded.\n\n\niTunes will, then, update your iPhone with the latest version.\n\nA: Yes - this is exactly the point of iOS 5.0 and the PC-free functionality.\nYou don't need a computer or iTunes to install free iOS software updates. To see if you are ready, open the settings app and choose About. As long as you are running 5.0 or higher, then choose software update from the settings app.\nYou should be able to see if updates are available as long as you have a data connection. You may need to connect to Wi-Fi or plug in to install the updates.\nYou are right to worry about a backup, so even if you are on iOS 5 it would be good to review the backup article to ensure you don't lose things you could have saved before updating your iPhone.\n\n\n*\n\n*iOS: How to back up\n", "Q: Does Skype running in the background use more battery life than other background running iPhone apps? I have noticed that I can receive skype calls and messages on my iPhone for a while now. Does Skype simply stay sign-ed in until I restart my iPhone and does it use the same amount of battery as other apps with notifications WHEN running in the background.\ni.e. if I have Facebook with notifications and Skype with notifications running in the background, do these apps/notifications use the same amount of battery?\n\nA: Apple limits what can run in the background to ensure battery life is not dramatically reduced. Skype will be constrained to the same restrictions that all other App Store apps must follow.\nGiven this, it is fair to assume Skype uses no more than any other Internet telephony app running in the background on your iPhone.\nFraser Speirs's article may be helpful in better understanding how background processes work on your iPhone.\n", "Q: OS X Not booting into recovery I've got (I think) an late-2009 Mac mini.

To boot a different recovery partition or an external USB install disk, hold the ⌥ (Option) key at boot and select the disk you want to boot to.\n", "Q: I am having a near daily crash on my iPhone 4. Has occurred with every iOS 5.x release I took my iPhone 4 to the Apple store based on this problem. The iPhone crashes during calls, when spawning new apps, when navigating an existing app. They suggested it was due to too many concurrent Apps running. Since that time I have sought to keep the number of apps down, but continue to experience crashes. Any suggestions?\n\nA: Your first step for troubleshooting should be to restore the phone. I'm surprised that they didn't tell you that at the Apple store. It might help you to set it up as a new phone instead of as a back up when you get the option. You would have to reinstall all your apps and reset all of your settings but it's the cleanest start. \n", "Q: How to save and exit \"nano .bash_profile\" in Terminal?

The Lion server is behind a NAT. Do I need to forward ports to the lion server? \n\nA: Yes, you'll need to either forward these ports to your Lion server, or put the Lion server in your firewall's DMZ. You will also need to make sure that the DNS name of your Lion server is resolvable to devices outside of your network.\nThe Apple Push Notification service used by Profile Manager will tell your device \"Check in with this server\", but your server needs to be resolvable and accessible for your device to actually check in and get the command that you've set for it in Profile Manager.

I'm currently running the old version of Apple TV (4.4.4) but I've been considering upgrading, now that the new version has an untethered jailbreak. I use the Apple TV primarily for FireCore's Media Player (files off my NAS) and Netflix. \nNow that the new UI just throws a ton of icons out there, is there any way to order them? Or by chance, do they re-order themselves based on usage?\nI don't ever use iTunes Movies, TV Shows, or Music, so I'd really hate for the entire first row to always be useless to me. With the current version I can at least use Overflow to hide the menus I don't need.\n\nA: I don't know that you can reorder them, and they don't reorder themselves, but you can remove unwanted channels, according to this blog entry:\nhttp://imho.nu/iMHo/media-player-position/.\nEssentially, you SSH in and rename the file of channels you don't use. The website gives some more detail, so I would check it out.\n\nA: This forum post details what I think is a better way of hiding unwanted ATV apps:\nhttp://forum.firecore.com/topic/7696\nI've used it to successfully hide the icons for MLB, NHL, and NBA. I also hid MobileMe photos (com.apple.frontrow.appliance.internet.dot-mac) -- seeing as MobileMe is being retired this month. I suspect Apple will issue an ATV update to remove that menu item too at the end of June. But it's good to know us jailbreakers can handle this ourselves!\nI am not sure what com.apple.frontrow.appliance.internet.internet-photos links to?\nI note there is also com.apple.frontrow.appliance.internet.photo-stream (for Photo Stream) and com.apple.frontrow.appliance.internet.flickr (for Flickr.)\nNext up, I'd love to discover a way to re-order these icons...\n\nA: iOS 6 Beta Allows Reordering of Icons on Apple TV\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4XlSrc4Xuk\nhttp://www.macrumors.com/2012/06/27/ios-6-beta-allows-reordering-of-icons-on-apple-tv/\n", "Q: iCloud: Troubleshooting Safari bookmarks sync between Windows and OS X I've been trying to ditch Google Chrome and start using Safari both on my MacBook (OS X Lion) and my Windows 7 desktop.\nAfter setting up iCloud on my Mac, I've set up bookmarks sync with Safari via iCloud on the Windows machine, as suggested in this question. The initial sync went well, and all of my bookmarks appeared in Windows Safari.\nBut as far as I can see, the new bookmarks are not synced. Neither do new bookmarks added on Mac appear on Windows, nor the happens the opposite.\nI've tried to sign out of iCloud on Windows, then sign back in; tried unchecking the bookmarks sync option and turning it back on. It didn't help.\nWindows Safari is ver. 5.1.7, OS X Safari is ver. 5.1.5.\nI wasn't able to find a way to see the bookmarks in iCloud online, so I have no idea about which side of the sync is faulty.\nI haven't found any suggestions online, apart from the advice to wipe all bookmarks and start over, which seems a sad case of cargo cult to me.\nHow can i troubleshoot the issue? Is there any sync status reports or logs, or a way to see the bookmarks stored online? Or should I do cargo cult, after all?\nBy the way, i don't have any iOS devices or other Macs to test against.\n\nA: I diagnosed and fixed my sync problem. It's been three or four days of bookmarks syncing without any hiccups.\nNarrowing the scope\nThe original problem was so tough because I had no simple way to find it whether the Mac Safari, or Windows Safari, or both, failed to sync.\nTo find out if the iCloud on Windows works, do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Change the Sync bookmarks with option in iCloud to Internet Explorer, wait a bit (sadly, iCloud doesn't seem to display any kind of sync progress anywhere).\n\n*Open Internet Explorer, add a bookmark or two, wait to give iCloud a chance to sync.\n\n*Change the Sync bookmarks with option in iCloud to Safari, again, wait.\n\n*Open Safari, check if the bookmarks added in Internet Explorer are there.\n\n*Add another couple of bookmarks in Safari, wait.\n\n*Change the Sync bookmarks with option in iCloud back to Internet Explorer, wait.\n\n*Open Internet Explorer, check if the bookmarks added in Safari are there.\n\n\nNow, in my case, all worked OK on the Windows iCloud part, so next thing I had to do was diagnosing the Mac part.\nFixing the problem\nApple KB article iCloud: Troubleshooting iCloud Bookmarks was an excellent source of help, once I knew which part of the setup to fix.\nThe steps that actually helped me in my Mac Safari problem case were these (see Troubleshooting iCloud Bookmarks update/setup issues on OS X Lion):\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Quit Safari.\n  \n*Choose System Preferences from the Apple () menu and then choose iCloud.\n  \n*Remove the checkmark in the checkbox next to Bookmarks.\n  \n*Close System Preferences and wait about a minute.\n  \n*Open System Preferences and choose iCloud\n  \n*Replace the checkmark next to Bookmarks.\n  \n*Close System Preferences.\n  \n*Open Safari and test to see if the issue has been resolved.\n  \n\nFor Windows iCloud problems, there's a separate section,\nTroubleshooting iCloud Bookmarks update/setup issues on Microsoft Windows, which probably should be helpful as well.\n", "Q: Why does OS X keep forgetting my trackpad settings I am running Snow Leopard 10.6.8 on an early 2010 15\" MacBook Pro. After restarting from scratch (what I don't do often usually) my trackpad is set back to \"click\" instead of \"touch\".\nThis started happening lately and I suspect this came with an update.\nIs this a known bug and/or is there a solution to this?\n\nA: The symptoms you describe are caused by the preference not getting saved to disk. Sometimes the cause is that there is a problem with the file permissions (as per thaatz's answer).\nAnother possibility is that the preference file somehow got corrupted; if this is the case, you can move the preference file (I think the relevant one is ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.trackpad.plist) from its location: this will cause the preference file to be recreated.\nOf course this will work also for other preferences (though identifying the correct file isn't always as easy); remember to keep the file around (instead of deleting it) so you can restore it in case this fix doesn't work.\n\nA: Perhaps it is having problems writing and saving your settings due to some sort of permission error.  Have you tried verifying and repairing disk file permissions? (use disk utility)\n\nA: Your trackpad settings are not applied in the login screen, log into an account an they will be restored to that accounts settings.\n", "Q: Changing the range of addresses served to clients connected via Internet Sharing Macbook Pro Running 10.7.4 attempting to share ethernet connection via Airport(Wi-Fi) and trying to serve 192.168.1.x addresses to connected clients.\nI've tried the guidance provided here (Dead link as of June 2016) and the  article Mac OS Hints: Change the default subnet for Internet Sharing\nMy com.apple.nat file has the following: \nNAT =     {\n    AirPort =         {\n        40BitEncrypt = 0;\n        Channel = 0;\n        Enabled = 0;\n        Extreme = \"\";\n        NetworkName = *****;\n        NetworkPassword = <*****>;\n    };\n    Enabled = 1;\n    NatPortMapDisabled = 0;\n    PrimaryInterface =         {\n        Device = en0;\n        Enabled = 0;\n        HardwareKey = \"\";\n        PrimaryUserReadable = Ethernet;\n    };\n    PrimaryService = \"352E1799-A5BD-45F7-8C1C-49A963899CFC\";\n    SharingDevices =         (\n        en1\n    );\n    SharingNetworkNumberStart = \"192.168.1.0\";\n};\n\nBut no dice. ifconfig still shows en1 as 10.0.2.1\nI've rebooted, made sure System Preferences was closed. en1 up'd and down'd \nI'm guessing I need to be modifying a different file.

For some reason—presumably a sync by my iPhone that overwrote my iPad’s more recently downloaded library—the majority of my iBooks were deleted.\nThe books I purchased can easily be restored, but I had downloaded a bunch of samples to, well, sample, before I bought the books.\nShy of using the restore feature, which will probably wreak its own havoc the way my iPhone did, when I synchronized iCloud through it, is there any log or history of the samples I have downloaded? I am sure this will happen again, and I don’t think restoring your iPad is the intended user experience by Apple.\n\nA: I was able to recover the list of all books in iBooks, including sample chapters, with the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select a tool to parse iPhone/iPad backups on your hard drive. Google for \"iphone backup extractor\", there are various.\n\n*Select a recent iPhone/iPad backup from the list presented by your extractor software.\n\n*Select iBooks as the app you wish to extract.\n\n*Search for a file called iBooks_v10252011_2152.sqlite, or something like that.\n\n*Use a SQLite viewer (such as Base on the Mac) to view the ZBKBOOKINFO table.\n\n*Look for the ZBOOKTITLE field - this should contain a list of all your books, including sample chapters, from the time of the backup!\n\n*If you want to get fancy, try sorting on the ZSAMPLECONTENT field.\n\nA: I'm afraid no such log or history exist. \nApparently either restoring a device, as iTunes does not make a backUp of your sample books, or upgrading to the lastest version of iBooks, will make your samples to dissappear. \n\nA: Thanks Joshua C. Lerner,\nYour suggestion worked. However, there are some updates in new iOS Books:\n\n\n*\n\n*I used iMzing to extract backup from iTunes in MacOSX (https://imazing.com/download).

I have some PDF files on my computer that I'd like to read on my iPad on the go.\nWhat free software can I use to read any PDF file I want? I would obviously need to transfer these PDF documents somehow to the iPad device, correct?\nI prefer something with nice turn pages effects, if possible, but free is a must.\n\nA: Personally, I use iBooks for my PDF storage and viewing. It's already on my iPad to view iBooks I have bought, and you can send a PDF from any other application to it.\nHaving said that, Mobile Safari will also display PDFs if you follow a link to them.\nI also use DropBox, which will display PDFs, amongst other file types.

I want to make a bootable Windows 7 USB in OS X Lion. How can I do that?\n\nA: You need a install ISO image downloaded from Microsoft and a USB flash drive with 4GB or more.\nPer the offical Bootcamp Guide for Lion by Apple (see page 4):\n\nYou may be able to install Windows 7 with a USB flash drive that contains a Windows 7 ISO image downloaded from Microsoft. To check whether you can do so, open Boot Camp Assistant, click Continue, and see if the option “Create a Windows 7 install disk” is available. To install Windows 7 with a USB flash drive, you need the following:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*An ISO image of Windows 7 Home Premium, Professional, or Ultimate downloaded from Microsoft.\n  \n*A USB flash drive with 4 GB or more.\n  Boot Camp Assistant erases the flash drive, and copies to it the Windows 7 ISO\n  image and software drivers that let Windows work with your Mac hardware.\n  \n  \n  To see how much free space you need on your disk for Windows, refer to the documentation that came with Windows.\n\n", "Q: If I've lost access to my Apple ID, are there downsides to creating a new ID? I have an Apple ID that I can not longer access, so I wonder is it better to create a new one? \nLet's say I've purchased apps and other products using my old Apple ID, some of which are still on my PC, but are linked to my Apple ID. Can I still retrieve those if I create a new ID, or should I purchase the content again?\n\nA: Have you read the Apple FAQ about Apple ID here?\nThere is various information on how to retrieve access to an ID, could be a good place to start rather than abandoning the ID as previous purchases will be linked to that ID.\nAs covered in the FAQ, since you have never been able to merge Apple ID - it's probably worth the effort to contact Apple to get the original account unlocked / password reset.\nQ: I have multiple Apple IDs. Is there a way for me to merge them into a single Apple ID?\n\nApple IDs cannot be merged. You should use your preferred Apple ID from now on, but you can still access your purchased items such as music, movies, or software using your other Apple IDs. \n\n\nA: Unfortunately, app, iBooks, music and other similar purchases are very much tied to a particular Apple ID, and it is not currently (and has never been in the past) possible to merge accounts. \nAre you aware you can request a new password or change the email and/or the Apple ID now if it's only access to the email that you have lost?\nYour proposal to start new and buy is obviously doable if you don't mind losing the history and all use of the past purchases.\nShould you ever recover / remember / reset the past account, you would then have two accounts to enter to get both sets of content loaded. So, you can have up to 5 accounts on each iOS device, but it's a bit of a pain to keep both passwords, switch back and forth and remember which account should buy new content. (You can remove payment from the one you don't want to buy to mitigate that one confusion). I would strongly recommend you keep working with Apple support to get your old account password reset and then change the email to match your current email / password rather than starting new.\nYou can also read up on how some other people solved this issue:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I change a defunct Apple ID email address?\n\n*How do I unlock my iTunes account when my old e-mail is unavailable?\n", "Q: Safari \"Find\" is slow Safari is fast at everything, except \"Find\".  When I hit command-F, I get the beachball for 5 to 25 seconds (and then the Find bar appears as normal and everything's good again).\nI have plenty of free memory, and the system disk is an SSD with plenty of free space, and my CPUs are almost completely idle.\nWhat could be causing this?  Is there something I can do or reset or flush to make it not so slow at this one thing?\n\nA: I would check to make sure you don't have any extensions installed that might be causing issues. Also, you can try \"Reset Safari...\" and \"Empty Cache...\", both under the application menu. If neither of these work, you can download a new copy of Safari and replace the one currently in your /Applications folder.\nAfter that, make a reservation at your closest Apple Retail Store and see what a Genius says.\n\nA: With Safari 5, I saw this almost every time I hit command-F.  Since upgrading to Safari 6, I have not seen this happen once, even with the same windows/tabs open as before.  I guess it was a bug in Safari 5 that got fixed!\n", "Q: Why does Xcode always have trouble submitting archives to iTunes? Some Background\nXcode not submitting to iTunes flawlessly has ALWAYS plagued me! I just don't understand what's going on, ever!\nI know what I am doing, I have quite a few apps in the iTunes App Store and Mac App Store. I know it's just buggy software because these issues didn't start happening until Xcode v4.0.\nI Archive my application on iOS Device or Release mode and when Organizer appears, I login choosing the correct developer team, correct version and correct certificates. I also Validate my applications first and fore-most and always receive \"Passed Validation\" with no problem.\nMy applications also never build with any issues or warnings.\nMost of the time, Xcode will just sit there and hang for a while on Your application is being uploaded. It's a 5/50 chance I'll get either of the 2 screens below.\n\nSometimes it will just sit here and animate and do nothing, even after about 10 minutes.\n\nSometimes the progress bar will get to about 10% (more or less), then other times it will get to around 80 - 90% (guestimate).\nI have experienced extreme wait times with 2 applications I have done that have been over 300MB's which is understandable because there is a lot of data to upload.\nBut what I don't understand is why this same thing happens with, for instance my current application, which is around 15MB's archived.\nXcode seems to be very spotty and only seems to work some of the time and I have no clue why.\nQuestion\nHas anyone else experienced what I have mentioned above? If so, have you been able to narrow the issues down? And is there anything I can do differently to ensure that I have 100% successful submissions in the future?\n\nA: Just waited for some hours and suddenly received the \"No issues found. Passed validation. Has been submitted.\" notification. Very strange, but true.\nMust have someting to do with current numbers of uploads to the store. \n", "Q: iPhone 4S message to enter password for CalDAV My iPhone is asking me to enter the password for the CalDav account \"Yahoo\".  What does this mean?  Do I have to do it? Can I stop it from asking for it?\n\nA: From what I've seen, often when it asks for a password, the original one was entered incorrectly - something very easy to do on an iPhone. First, try entering the password to see if it goes away. Chances are, it is probably not syncing with your Yahoo calendar and won't unless the password problem is corrected.\nYou can also go to Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars, and select the account named \"Yahoo\", and turn off the calendar for that account if you do not wish to have it in the Calendar app.\nIf you currently are receiving mail to that Yahoo account (if there is one associated with it) on your phone, then it may be a different problem.\n\nA: I had deleted one of my email accounts from my home computer. I had forgotten to remove it from my phone. went in to settings - mail, contacts, calendars and removed it. No more calDav message.\n", "Q: Navigating to options in context menus When a context menu opens how do you know which keys are mapped to which entries in the menu? Is OS X just guessing or is there something that the developer specifically defined for these.  In this particular menu when pressing E it jumps down near the bottom.  Took a screenshot to show explanation.\n\n\nA: In cases where there is not a visible shortcut, it is based on the title of next item. If you type the first few letters of the title of the menu, it will be selected. So if I wanted to select \"Introduce Parameter\" in your example above, I could quickly type I N T or I N T R to select it. My guess is that the case of \"Extract\" above, it is taking you to the next unique case alphabetically - you have three \"Extract \" listings and the next unique letter, alphabetically is \"Extract *C*lass.\" If you wanted to select the previous entry, I think you'd be stuck with typing E X T T R A C T  I \nYou can select Finder items on the Desktop, or in folders, in a similar manner. If I want to select a file called \"my stuff\", I can start typing M or M Y instead of single-clicking the file itself.\n\nA: After repeated experimentation, it appears the principle involved as good old alphabetical order. A typed character causes the selection to jump to the item on the list first in alphabetical order that begins with the character you typed.\nIn your example, if you type E on its own, the selection jumps to the item on the list first in alphabetical order that starts with the letter \"E\". EX, EXT, etc. all will jump to that same Extract Class item because it comes first in alphabetical order.\nIf you wanted to jump to  Extract Superclass…, you would need to quickly type EXTRACTspaceS.\n", "Q: why is my ipod stilll using so much of the \"other\" catergory after it was restored? The keyboard on my iPod malfunctioned, and I couldn't get onto it. I then backed it up and restored it. After it was restored, I tried to put my previous files back on it, but only got my pictures and bookmarks on. It says the \"other\" category is using 2.5GB of space! I am wondering what possibly is going on? (If it helps, it was jailbroken and now is upgraded to iOS 5.1.1).\n\nA: Anything from applications (non-iTunes apps), saved games, stored files (using OpenSSH for example). Mainly jailbreak items etc ... make up the (Other) in iTunes.\nAnything that takes up space and can not be recognized by iTunes, shows up as 'other'.\nI think what is happening is it is installing things from all of your jailbroken apps even though your device is not jailbroken any more. I think what ZHENJiNG LiANG is saying is to restore your iPod as a new device and then sync everything (music, apps, photos) etc... manually instead of restoring from your backup. Because your backup obviously has files in it that no longer relate to your non jailbroken phone.\n\nA: Try to do a Fresh Restore, and reinstall you apps.\n", "Q: Clean up file names using Automator I’m fairly new to Automator, in that I’ve used it only once before. What I’m trying to do is clean up a bunch of Android app assets, which are named like so:\n01_something\n1_something_else\n002_something_too\n\nWhat I want to do is remove the leading digits + underscore, i.e. any leading non alphabetical characters. I imagine this can be done either by having a script that’s smart enough remove them, perhaps by some manner of regex, or by having a prompt that asks me how many characters I want to remove, if Automator even supports that.\nSecondly, I’d like to add a prefix to the files, like tile_ or ab_. Again, if I could select some files in Finder, and choose ‘Add Prefix’ or something, and enter some text into a prompt, that’d be optimal.\n\nA: There is no need for dedicated file renaming software to do such relatively simple batch renaming operations – Automator will allow you to create services that do what you want.\nYour first task (removing a numerical prefix followed by an underscore form file names) can be solved like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*create an Automator service (choose “Service” when prompted what kind of workflow to create by Automator). Set it to take “Files or folders” as input.\n\n*add a “Filter Finder Items” action and set it to filter on the condition “none” match “kind is Folder”  to make sure you have only files.\n\n*Add a “Run Shell Script” action and make sure it runs /bin/bash and takes its input “as arguments”. Insert the following code:\nshopt -s extglob\nfor f in \"$@\"; do\n    fpath=\"${f%/*}\"\n    fname=\"${f##*/}\"\n    mv \"$f\" \"$fpath\"/\"${fname/#+([[:digit:]])_/}\"\ndone\n\n– see the Bash Reference Manual’s chapter on Pattern Matching for an explanation of how this works (recommended reading for this kind of operation anyway :)).\n\n*save to the default location as “Remove Prefix”.\n– you will now have a “Remove Prefix” in the Service menu of Finder (and the context menu of files and folders) which will rename files so a numerical prefix followed by an underscore is stripped from the file name.\nThe second task (prefixing the files with a selectable string) is even easier to achieve, using a Standard Automator action:\n\n\n*\n\n*create an Automator Service as in the steps 1 and 2 above.\n\n*add a “Rename Finder Items” action. Set it to “Add Text”, enter a default prefix in the text box (if you like), set the string to be applied “before the name”. Select “Options” in the bottom row of the action and tick “Display this action when running” (disclaimer: I’m on a German system – all translations approximative).\n\n*save to the default location as “Add Prefix”.\n\n\n– when you run the service on one or more files, you will see the following dialog:\n\n(or rather, its equivalent in your system language), where you can edit the prefix you want to use before applying it.\nHappy renaming with OS X’ on-board abilities :).\n\nA: I've always found the commercial app A Better Finder Rename a time-saver when trying to work out complex actions like this.\nLast year I had a humongous set of PDF files (>25k individual files!) which needed their filenames changed from FirstName,LastName.pdf to LastName_FirstName.pdf. Although this is a relatively simple filename mod, ABFR has far more advanced features which will allow you to do what you need. \nWhat made the job even easier was the very cool mechanism whereby ABFR can create a droplet from your renaming specifications. Drop a folder or file on the droplet - ABFR processes the files in a flash.\n(Disclosure: I'm a very satisfied customer of this software, and have no financial interest in ABFR.)\n", "Q: How do I disable Lion's Resume feature? Some of my software will be loaded at login, but I don't want it to be loaded as-it-was when I closed it. How can I disable this feature?\n\nA: To turn off Lion's Resume feature just go to System Preferences > General and uncheck \"Restore Windows when quitting and re-opening apps\".\nOnce rebooted, won't do it again. \n\nA: When you confirm the re-start or turn-off of your mac, there's a checkbox that determines how apps will be loaded back, un-check it and it will not load the open software to the state you've closed your mac with. \n\nA: When you shut down your Mac, you can select \"reopen current applications\", try to deselect that option.

I cannot see anything on the screen and the buttons don't do anything, no backlighting either. The problem started when I wanted to plug my iPod into the wall to charge it (it was almost empty). When I plugged in my iPod, the screen went out and I have had no response since. I think the battery is broken, but I am not sure. How can I fix this? Or should I contact Apple?\n\nA: It sounds like there a good possibility of it being a hardware issue, in which case you should contact Apple. \nIf you haven't already, about the only thing to do, is plug it into your computer for about 15 minutes. Sometimes it takes awhile, if the battery is completely dead, to get the charge started. But, I'm pretty confident that won't work, considering it had life before you plugged it in. It would be something to try if you wanted to take the time.\n\nA: It sounds like you had some sort of AC power surge. You should, indeed, contact Apple. \n\nA: Try plugging it into a tested power supply and holding down the home button and the sleep/wake button at the same time. \n\nA: Contacting Apple is the best course of action here; however, you may not get support. It's a second-gen iPod touch, which means that it likely isn't covered by a warranty.\n", "Q: How to use Keep in Dock option with applications started form the console? I tried to use Keep in Dock option with a Java application that is started from the command line but when I try to restart the application it will fail - and this is happening because it will start java without any parameters.\nThere are two ways of starting the application on OS X but both of them fail if you want to use the Keep in Dock option.\n\n\n*\n\n*start it using the shell script olv.sh\n\n*start the jar file logview.jar by clicking on it in Finder.\n\n\nIn case you want to debug, the application is http://code.google.com/p/otroslogviewer but I know that the same problem applies for other apps too.\nHow can I solve the problem so I can start the application from Dock and eventually from Finder also.\n\nA: You could write a shell script to invoke the java app with the parameters you need, then wrap it up in an app with Platypus.\nThe resultant app can then be put in the Dock like any other app.\nI've used it for a variety of tasks, such as popping-up a help screen with a serial number for users to enter for a recalcitrant app which didn't like mass deployment and would ask the user to enter it at first run, to a complicated script which mounted a disk-image of a science textbook's additional media DVD and then ran the associated app to access the content. Platypus even allowed me to roll the disk-image into the final app itself, making deployment easier.\n", "Q: Where can I find an explained list of emoji (emoticons) used in iOS? Where can I find an explained list of  emoji (emoticons) used in iOS for use on Mac OS X?\nSome of them are not quite clear and I would like to see their base meaning (I know that you are free to use them, still as the glyphs they should have an Unicode name). \n\nA: There's also a list on my web site, that I just made. The list is viewable using a browser with emoji font support; this includes Safari.\n\nA: When you're in iOS, you can also turn on VoiceOver and it'll read the names of the Emoji as you move around the keyboard.\n\nA: First, in System Preferences, under the Keyboard tab of the Keyboard Preference Pane, be sure Show Keyboard and Character Viewers in menu bar is checked.\n\nThen, from the Keyboard menu in the menu bar, select Show Character Viewer. In the Character viewer pane, select Emoji. When you select an Emoji, on the right side of the pane, you get a large graphic of the Emoji and a text explanation of the shape.\n\n\nA: Wikipedia has a series of tables at w:Emoji. Additionally, they also organize it by what platform supports what character as well.\n", "Q: How can I downgrade an iMac12,1 from Lion to Snow Leopard? I purchased a refurbished iMac \"originally released May 2011\" from Apple (http://store.apple.com/us/product/FC812LL/A ), hoping it'd still have Snow Leopard on it.\nEnded up having Lion on it.  My Googling says it originally came with 10.6.6, so it definitely supports Snow Leopard, but I guess in the refurbishing process they upgraded it to 10.7 and now I can't get it to go back.\nHow can I downgrade an iMac12,1 from Lion to Snow Leopard?\n\nA: You can do this if you have an older Snow Leopard-compatible Mac.\n\n\n*\n\n*Put the new iMac into Target Disk Mode and connect it to the older Mac with a Firewire cable. Its hard disk should mount on the desktop of the other Mac. (Hold T at startup to enable Target Disk Mode)\n\n*Boot the older Mac from the SL DVD that came with that Mac and install onto the new iMac's hard disk.\n\n*Before Rebooting the iMac Download and install the Mac OS X 10.6.8 Combo Update while booted from the older Mac's normal operating system. Make sure to target the new iMac from within the Installer.\n\n\nA: You could always wipe (format) the hard drive and reinstall if you have a Snow Leopard disc available.\nI'd recommend not bothering, though. Lion is much better than Snow Leopard in so many ways.\n\nA: It's very rare that a Mac will support an earlier version of OS X - that is, a version that was released prior to the release of the machine in question. The drivers alone would be a pain, you'd probably have to do some crazy stuff with kexts (for some really good info on that kind of deep magic, check out the Hackintosh Support Communitites section of hackintosh.com for links to some smart people and conversations). In any case, it will likely be quite difficult to get it working. However...\nIf you really want to, you might as well try! Don't worry so much about wiping the drive; since the Mac came with OS X Lion installed (even though it originally didn't), and as long as you have installed all your Software Updates, you can use Lion Recovery to reinstall the entire OS, even to a blank drive (useful in the case of drive failure or replacement/upgrade).\nAlso, target disk mode would be a good place to start, I'd imagine. Your Mac will actually prevent you from booting from an earlier version's install disc, so you'd have to have a disc with 10.6.6 or later on it. For example, booting from the current Snow Leopard retail disc (10.6.3) won't do it.\nYour best bet is probably to see if you can find anyone selling the restore disc that originally came with your model. Try searching eBay/craigslist for your model number and good luck!\n\nA: As that model did initially come with Snow Leopard installed, you just need to find a SL restore disc that's specific for the iMac. eBay is probably your best bet.\n\nA: You'll need to boot from the SL install disk to perform a clean install. \n\n\n*\n\n*First, insert the SL disk in dvd drive, the install window should open but if not double click on the mounted drive to open.\n\n*Double click the \"install OSX\" icon.\n\n*You should have a couple of options now, one of them will be \"utilities\". Click utilities and the SL install disk will tell you that you need to restart to use utilities from this disk. Hit the restart button.\n\n*Once you restart you'll have to select your language then you should get the utilities option again. Select utilities and then \"Disk Utility\"\n\n*Select your hard drive from the left panel of the disk utility screen.\n\n*Click on the erase tab, make sure format is set to \"Mac OS Extended (Journaled)\", then  click erase.\n\n*Exit the disk utility screen and follow the instructions to install Snow Leopard.\n\n\nNOTE: USE ONLY THE CORRECT VERSION OF SNOW LEOPARD FOR THIS MACHINE >>> IF YOU TRY AND INSTALL AN EARLIER VERSION OF SL YOU RUN A VERY STRONG RISK OF THE DISK BEING INCOMPATIBLE AND YOU BEING LEFT WITH A MACHINE THAT DOESN'T WORK!\n", "Q: How can I get Xcode to install under Lion? I'm slightly confused under Lion as to how to get dependencies in place for Homebrew. It wants Xcode in place, and I can go to the app store and click on \"Install\", and it dutifully says \"Installing\"... and stays stuck on \"Installing\" after several minutes. I can find Xcode but apparently not get to \"Installed\", in the past indicative.\nHow can I install Xcode? Do I just need to give it more time to install? Or is there another way like installing from tarball? It's been \"Installing\" for a few minutes, and seems stuck.\n\nA: When the App Store is \"Installing\" keep in mind this  includes \"Downloading\", and Xcode is usually about 4 GB. Leave it overnight or monitor your network traffic to see the progress.\nOnce Xcode is installed, you will need to run xcode-select to expand your path since tools like make and compilers/linkers are in /Applications/Xcode and not in your typical bash path. You can go to settings and download the command line tools to keep them if decide to delete Xcode later. \n\nA: While this doesn't actually answer your direct question of Xcode on Lion, if you are only needing part of it for homebrew, Xcode 4.3 split many of the other parts of Xcode off into separate different downloads. \nIf you only need the command line tools for homebrew and the like, you no longer need to install all of Xcode. Here is another link as well.\nOtherwise, Apple used to allow downloads of Xcode from the Dev center, but most of this is driven through the App Store now.\nFinally, Xcode is a rather large application, and the installation is unique too. Make sure that another window hasn't opened waiting for input on the installation, etc. It also may take a long time to download, which should be noted in the App Store on its progress.\n\nA: With Snow Leopard Xcode could also be found on the installation disks. May you can find it on the Lion disks as well and install it from there.\n", "Q: Syncing iCal with Outlook2011 No matter what I do, I can't get new items that I add to Outlook 2011 calendar to actually show up in iCal. Is this a bug? Does anyone have a fix for this?\n\nA: To set up iCal calendars, open iCal > select iCal menu > Preferences > Accounts > \"+\" below account list, then add your email account used in MS Outlook. As long as it is a IMAP email account, this should enable the calendar in iCal. It also should sync automatically.\n", "Q: can .webloc file icon show a useful web page preview? Assuming Finder --> View --> View Options --> Show Icon Preview is enabled, is it possible for a .webloc file icon to show a preview of the referenced web-page?\nI think the browser would have to do this, when I drag from the browser URL box to the desktop.  But so far, with multiple popular browsers, I see nothing but not-very-informative standard icons.  For example, the Safari compass.\nDoes any popular browser support this, say,  through a preference setting or an add-in?\nMotivation:  I can now sort through a bunch of TextEdit files by putting them in a folder, view them as icons, and using the Finder option to increase the icon size until enough is visible -- document \"shape\" and larger text. Why not .weblocs?\nObviously, the browser-created .webloc file name should be useful, but often it is not, and --when I'm collecting a bunch of .webloc files for reference use-- it is a bit of a pain to have to edit the name of each.\nObviously the icon content would be a snapshot at the time of collecting the .webloc.  I assume there is no way to see the current content.  OK by me.  Thinking about the potential for just a minute, this possibility seems at minimum creepy ... to very undesirable, unless completely under user control.  Well, anyway, the kinds of reference pages I want to collect and sort through generally don't change much.\nTIA\n\nA: I did finally locate an application that provides the solution you are looking for.  The application isn't hands-free initially as it is a command line program.  \nsetWeblocThumb generates custom icon consisting of a preview of the web page that the webloc file points to.  It does not do this universally.  You'll need to \n\n\n*\n\n*point it at folders that you'd like it to watch\n\n*Assign a folder action to the folder that you'd like setWeblocThumb to watch and have it run setWeblocThumb.  \n\n\nIt's fairly straightforward, but is a bit more than simply downloading and installing an application.  The good news is that it's free. \n\nA: I think the \"HetimaWebThumbnail.qlgenerator\" QuickLook plugin from SafariStand did this. I'm not sure if it works with the newest Safari version though. I don't use Safari anymore.\n", "Q: Remove Jailbreak and restore to factory settings without iTunes A friend has an iPhone and they need to wipe it and remove the jailbreak on it. They don't need a backup.\nThe problem is they don't have access to a computer with iTunes on it to do this.\nCan this be done without iTunes? Will doing an 'erase all content and settings' lock the phone? Some posts I have read suggest if you do this the phone will get bricked.\n\nA: I believe all of the current jailbreak solutions work by modifying an IPSW file for the device, and flashing that back on to it. To remove it, you would need a clean IPSW and to do that you need to restore it through iTunes. If you don't back it up first (wether that be on iCloud or iTunes), then obviously you'll lose all of the settings, apps, and app data on the phone as well.\n\nA: You've heard correctly - tapping \"Erase All Content and Settings\" on a jailbroken device will just cause it to get stuck on the Apple logo while booting until you restore it with iTunes (because the filesystems of jailbroken devices are slightly rearranged).\nThe only way to remove the jailbreak from a jailbroken device is to restore it with iTunes on a computer.\n(If your device is stuck on the Apple logo and you want to restore it, you may have to put the device into DFU mode before iTunes can read it. You can do this by plugging your device into a computer that has iTunes installed, holding the power (lock) button and home button for 10 seconds, then releasing the power button while you keep holding the home button for another 15 seconds. Then iTunes should recognize it and allow you to restore it.)\n", "Q: How can I completly clear all browser history, caches, and keychain passwords? Borrowed a laptop from a friend and would like to clear all internet history and clear all flash caches etc, and forget passwords from the keychain (if it stores these?)\nBeen using incognito mostly but yeah, and weird cookies stored in a random subolder or anything?\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: If you're using Safari, go to Safari -> Reset Safari and select check every box. Then click reset. \nIf you're using Chrome, click Cmd-Shift-Del and check the desired boxes. Here's an image:\n\nHope this helps!\n\nA: If you have the password for the user account that you are using now (assuming it's an account with Administrator privileges), why not go to System Preferences: Users & Groups, and create a new user account with Administrator privileges. Then log out  and log back in under the new account you've just created. You'll have a completely new user account with a blank Keychain and no cookies and nothing in any caches.\n", "Q: Why do Location Services turn off on its own sometime? I have an iPhone 3Gs and the latest iPod Touch.  Neither have 3G data connectivity and are only connected to the Internet via WiFi.\nWhen either device spends a while not being connected to WiFi (for instance, when camping), the Location Services turn off on their own. \nWhy is this?  Is it by design?  How do I make Location Services stay on?\n\nA: Apple works very hard to conserve battery life, and determining location, no matter if it is through GPS, cellular, or wifi connections takes extra battery. The arrow displays any time a 3rd party app requests your location. For instance, when you open Maps, the arrow will likely turn on because Maps needs to pinpoint where you are. The arrow may also turn on for system level locations services (settings can be adjusted in Settings > Location Services > System Services), and depending on your settings, the arrow may or may not appear for that.\nAs for Location Services being on or off, you can set that in the settings (Settings > Location Services), but if you see the arrow, it is likely on already. \nThe arrow only appears when location services are active, and may or may not show when it is just on.\n\nA: It is definily a bug. I though it was my daughter who turned it off and I protected the location services with a password that only me knew, the location services turned off once more. It seems that happens every time that I upload a new update on the operating system.\n", "Q: AppleScript vs. Bash script? I'm a long-time Windows \"power user\" and developer who has recently decided to move over to Mac OS X.\nOn OS X Lion and indeed previous versions there seem to be two main options for scripting and automation in OS X: AppleScript and Bash script. The latter is of course a direct consequence of OS X using the Unix \"bash\" shell, while the former is Apple's own innovation. The syntaxes are clearly very different, with AppleScript having a pseudo-natural-language style.\nMy question is, are AppleScript and Bash script commonly used (indeed, should they be used) for disparate tasks and purposes on OS X. I am vaguely cognizant of the vast array of tasks I can accomplish with Bash script, though of course the code for some more advanced ones can quickly become convoluted. Do these two languages have overlapping or near-identical usage cases, despite Apple's later invention of AppleScript -- or are they intended to be used with different scenarios in mind? A high-level overview as well as some specific examples would be appreciated.\n\nA: While either scripting context can do anything the other can (because shell scripts can call /usr/bin/osascript to invoke an AppleScript, and AppleScript has the do shell script command), there are indeed contexts for which one is better suited than the other.\nBoth scripting languages are \"glue\" languages -- they can do minimal things themselves, and instead accomplish most of their tasks by invoking the capabilities of other programs. Shell scripts make use of Unix pipes, while AppleScript has the tell application syntax.\nWhere they diverge is that AppleScripts directly communicate with scriptable applications (almost always GUI applications), while shell scripts communicate primarily with command-line programs (some of which can invoke graphic user interfaces, but many do not).\nWhen it comes to file management tasks, both approaches can work. One can Tell Application Finder to copy files, or run the cp command in a shell script. So why use one over the other? Certainly some script writers are more familiar with one language than the other, and thus will prefer to use that tool. But a better consideration is of the user of the script. AppleScript can often be invoked from the Mac GUI: double-clicking an AppleScript application, or dropping files onto one, or using an AppleScript menu either system-wide or within a particular program. Programs like Mail can be set up to run an AppleScript on incoming messages to filter them. For users accustomed to using Macs in a \"Mac-like\" way (i.e. from the GUI), AppleScripts are often more accessible.\nShell scripts often (but not always) live in the Terminal. If one is already using Terminal, running a shell script there can be more convenient than invoking an AppleScript. On the other hand, many users are off-put by having to type commands in a Terminal window, or even clicking a script file that opens a Terminal window to do its magic. I personally find the syntax of shell scripts more readable than that of AppleScripts, but I suspect I'm in a minority on that one. Shell scripts are familiar to users of many different Unix-like systems.\nIn any event, both are powerful tools for gaining better control over your Mac.\n\nA: The other answers give great high-level overviews of the intention behind these two scripting techniques. Maybe I'll just give you examples of how I use them.\nWith Applescript, I've made processing rules for Mail, connected BBEdit to R for statistical processing, created complex Folder Actions, and done a massive time-based reorganization of my photos in iPhoto and Aperture. I've also created mini-apps with buttons and text displays. Basically, this is automatic manipulation of complex apps with GUIs.\nWith Bash scripting, I've created automatic image processing routines with Imagemagick, PDF processing routines with Ghostscript, time and date routines, and lots of text processing with Bash, sed/awk, and Perl. Unix utilities tend to be lean, fast, and flexible, and Bash is a great way to combine them into very powerful, easy tools. \nI do sometimes call Bash scripts from within an Applescript, usually for text processing purposes (GREP) or for light website fetching (curl). I almost always use this technique to obtain a bit of data or a variable to use further in my Applescript.\n\nA: It may be oversimplification, but shell scripting is for combining existing programs to perform new tasks whereas AppleScript is to control (mostly GUI) applications remotely. Classical Unix programs typically read some input and produce some output and shell scripting lets you combine them. AppleScript is to automate GUI applications.\n\nA: Both shell- and AppleScripts can be used just about anywhere either is appropriate.\nAppleScripts work better when talking to apps and user-level system facilities. (For instance, you can say tell app \"iTunes\" to play and it will, or tell app \"Finder\" to open the first file of the second window.)\nShell scripts (you referred to bash) work better when talking to low-level system objects and Unixy stuff. \nThey're both interoperable: you can call a shell command from AppleScript with do shell script \"command here\" and you can call AppleScript code from the shell with osascript -e \"AppleScript\". Further, there's quite a bit of overlap between the two (especially when it comes to file system operations).\nThere are certainly more resources for learning shell scripting online than AppleScript and it doesn't help that AppleScript has a reputation for being a \"read-only\" language (i.e., harder to write than read). \nIn any case, the most modern way to do scripting is with Automator, where you can use either shell- or AppleScripting (or both) along with pre-built modules from various apps you have installed.\n", "Q: iPhone 4S Auto-Correct Is there any way that I can get auto-correct on my iPhone 4S to stop changing the word \"Yo\" to \"To?\" I have tried adding a keyboard shortcut for \"Yo\" as well as adding Spanish to my International Keyboards, but its still happening.\n\nA: Unfortunately, Apple hasn't relegated any control of auto-correct functions to the user (natively), and it isn't possible to add or remove words that it auto-corrects - other then using the shortcuts like you mentioned, which don't work for everything. \n", "Q: How to disable Self Control application? I use SelfControl quite frequently for completing homework and such, but at school, while I was away from my keyboard at the white board, my friend thought it would be funny to set the timer to 10 hours.  I am currently using a proxy to ask this question.  Is there any way to disable this useful, but inflexible application?\n\nA: I had to remove the lines in /etc/hosts, change the date in /etc/SelfControl.lock, and reopen the SelfControl application:\nsudo sed -i '' '/# BEGIN SELFCONTROL/,/# END SELFCONTROL/d' /etc/hosts\nsudo sed -i '' 's|<date>.*|<date>2010-01-01T01:01:01Z</date>|' /etc/SelfControl.lock\nkillall SelfControl; open -a SelfControl\n\nJust deleting /etc/SelfControl.lock didn't work. If you have removed SelfControl.app, download it again first.\n\nA: It's simple, just open preferences, and change the date to the next day!\n\nA: Update: This still works in 2021\nQuit SelfControl.\nOpen System Preferences > Date and Time > Change the day 1 day in the future.\nLaunch SelfControl again. Quit SelfControl and then change the date back.\nThis works because SelfControl checks the date and time, sees that you are past the blocking period, and removes the host file additions.\n\nA: Have you tried opening Terminal (Applications -> Utilities -> Terminal) and using the commands:\nkillall SelfControl\n\nor\nsudo killall SelfControl\n\nAs it is not working try the hosts file:\nsudo nano /etc/hosts\n\nAnd look for something like this\n# BEGIN SELFCONTROL BLOCK\n127.0.0.1   www.nasa.gov\n127.0.0.1   nasa.gov\n# END SELFCONTROL BLOCK\n\ndelete the entire block and hit CTRL + O to save the file and CTRL + X to exit.\nEverything you put at hosts file like:\n127.0.0.1 facebook.com\n127.0.0.1 nasa.gov\n127.0.0.1 stackoverflow.com\n\nThose addresses will be blocked, you will not be able to access them while they are inside the hosts file\nTo stop and delete SelfControl running as a background process:\nsudo su -\ncd /Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/\nrm org.eyebeam.SelfControl\n\nTo delete the firewall rules that have been introduced by SelfControl, read this blog article by Joshua Kehn:\nhttp://joshuakehn.com/2010/10/25/Defeating-SelfControl.html\n\nA: Sometimes deleting what's between the # BEGIN SELFCONTROL and # END SELFCONTROL doesn't work. \nOn the other side, changing the Date or Time worked perfectly for me!

I found some icons that would be a good fit to my iPhone app based on the features/scenarios that the app will provide, but noticed that an app in the App Store already use those icons. So question is, is it ok to use those icons again? Or in another way, are the icons from the App Store apps allowed to be copied and used in other apps that are owned by different organizations? \n\nA: Icons are definitely not freely copy-able. Apps in the App Store still enjoy the copyright protections afforded under intellectual property laws in your region.\nIf you've found an app with icons that you're smitten with try contacting the developer about it. Often developers will purchase icon sets from icon factories like iconarchive.com (link omitted on purpose). These icon sets are licensed to you, for use in your applications, and come with the necessary license to allow you to redistribute and profit off any product that includes them. You can find free and paid-for icon sets out there. The developer might be forthcoming if they purchased their icons from a factory.\nIf the developer has designed the icons on their own they may choose to license them to you or they may say no. In which case: respect their wishes or you may find yourself on the receiving end of a cease-and-desist letter that prevents you from selling or giving away your app to the masses.\n\nA: Like everything else in this digital age, yes it is owned by someone, or a license was purchased for its' use. Would you want someone to 'take' your application for free? If not, then why are you willing to 'take' someones icons for your own use, without giving any credit to the creator.\n", "Q: How can I increase my font sizes without decreasing my resolution? I have a 24\" iMac at home which at the max resolution (1920 x 1200) is very comfortable for me to see my desktop and read text.\nNow at work I have a 27\" iMac with a max resolution of 2560 x 1440 which with my poor eyesight makes text extremely tiny and hard to read.\nIf I decrease my resolution to 1920 x 1080 it's back to being very easy to read, though it makes text in some instances (most notably in terminal) quite blurry and hard to read.\nSo, how can I increase font sizes for all applications without decreasing my resolution?\n\nA: Apple doesn't have an option for you to do that. However, you can try TinkerTool. You can download it at no cost.\nScreenshot taken from TinkerTool website.\n\n\nA: Unfortunately, there is no system-wide way to make the content fonts larger across all applications without changing the resolution.\nIt is possible to change the fonts used by the system, as the other answer points out so well. You may find Tinker Tool to be enough of a solution for your problem.\nThis question attempts to step through how to make individual programs increase their font size, but it focuses on Lion, not Snow Leopard. Still, you may find some helpful tips there.\n\nA: I believe that this can be done with either Tinker Tool System or Mac Pilot, but not with Mountain Lion Cache Cleaner or Cocktail. \n\nA: The best way to make text easier to read on your Mac is to adjust it within each app you're using.\nFor example, to make email text larger and easier to read in Mail, go to Mail > Preferences, choose Fonts & Colors, choose Select next to Message font, and then select a font size.\nIn Messages, go to Messages > Preferences > General, and then move the Text size slider to the right.\nYou can also change the font size for desktop icons by right-clicking the desktop and choosing Show View Options. Move the Icon size slider to the right, and choose Text size to pick a different text size.\nTo increase the size of items in the Finder and Mail sidebars, go to the Apple menu and choose System Preferences > General, select Sidebar icon size, and then choose Large.\nThere's also a zoom tool built-in to macOS\n\nA: From the age of this post, your 27\" iMac is a pre-Retina model, with a pixel density of only 109 ppi (compared to a Retina display at twice that - 218 ppi).\nUsing a display resolution of 1920 x 1080 is using a scaling factor of 1.3 pixels, in order to map to the full size of the display. This, combined with the low pixel density means that text and images will be blurry.\nYour best option is to set the display to full size, 2560 x 1440, and then display each window at a larger zoom factor or size where possible.\n", "Q: Can I get S.M.A.R.T. support on external hard drives?

It uses SAT (SCSI ATA Translation) to pass the SMART commands through to the hard drive, so only works if your enclosure supports SAT.\nSAT isn't something enclosures seem to advertise support for, but the one I use (WD MyBook Studio Edition) happens to support it, so it works for me. It'll probably be quicker to test the software with your drive/enclosure, than to find out if SAT is supported in the specs.\n\nA: There are satsmart drivers on github that work perfectly well for most (usb) disks.\nDisconnect all external disks;\nInstall the satsmart driver;\nrestart the mac, connect the disks.\nSee and download from here: https://binaryfruit.com/drivedx/usb-drive-support\n", "Q: No More Vocals Instruments in GarageBand '11?

My iMac (mid 2010) keeps pestering me to upgrade my EFI firmware to 1.8. Sadly, no matter how many times I try to to upgrade the EFI (from the manual install, or the auto update), it does not seem to go through and asks me again at the next reboot. \nThe main reasons seems to be that I am running Mac OS X on a completely external disk (firewire); I am reserving the internal disk for Windows. I believe it’s the reason for my trouble since you can find many people have similar problems when they are running os x from a second internal disk (usually when they replaced a MacBook or iMac SuperDrive by an SSD drive).\nSearching on the internet, I found a couple of resources that seem to indicate that manually blessing the firmware is possible. For instance this one; note their solution is for a slightly different problem, where installing Ubuntu messed up with EFI, but everything is running from the main disk.\nI downloaded the firmware, extracted the relevant file (IM112_0057_01B_LOCKED.scap), and tried—unsuccessfully—to manually push the update. \nI am not quite sure how bless works, nor where the efi update is supposed to live (i am surprised that it seems to live on the disk, not on the computer itself, but I could be misunderstanding the way EFI works).\nI tried:\nsudo bless -mount / -firmware blabla.scap\nsudo bless -mount /Volumes/Main -firmware blabla.scap\netc…\n\nNo success! If anyone who better understands EFI / the bless command can help me out, I would be super grateful.\nI can share the output of the --verbose command if it is helpful.\n\nA: To answer some of your questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*The firmware is stored on main board. However, when updating firmware, the EFI system partition is used as a staging area.\n\n*After serval testings, it seems that Mac only recognizes the EFI partition at primary internal disk as a staging area (note: at least not working at the optical bay of my mac or at any external drive). So, if you only got an external disk or there is no ESP in your primary internal disk, that would be mission impossible, at least not the bless command could get it done.\n\n*To solve your issue, you may try the following steps if your internal disk has a EFI system partition:\n\n\n*\n\n*boot the machine wish macOS\n\n*use bless command to prepare firmware update, including write scap file onto ESP.\n\n*make sure the scap file is on the ESP of internal disk. otherwise create one by copying it from ESP of external disk.\n\n*restart the machine. Hopefully, the upgrade will be processed.\n\n\nor\n\n\n*\n\n*backup your Windows\n\n*install High Sierra on the internal disk so that the firmware will be upgraded to latest one, or format the internal disk as GUID partition table (so that there will be a ESP on that disk for updating firmware), then use bless command to upgrade the firmware manually. note: strong recommend with --verbose and --recovery options.\n\n*restore Windows\n\n\nor\nI'm not sure is your mac be able to replace the internal drive with the external drive easily. If yes, I believe the fastest way is replacing the internal drive with your external drive temporarily to get the upgrade done.\n\nA: I have had a similar issue when using a newer version of OS X than the system originally came with. Booting into an external system of the original operating system (in your case, 10.6 Snow Leopard) allowed the firmware to install and stop asking.\n", "Q: How to limit search only to file name instead the content of files? \nPossible Duplicate:\nSearching by file name (as opposed to name and contents) in Lion \n\nI have a \"server\" with OS X Lion and a shared hard disk, and some clients with various version of OS X (10.4 to 10.7). \nWhen a client search for a file, I would like to limit the search to the file name and not the content of the files. \nIs there a way to do this?\n\nA: When you're in the Finder, hit Command + F.

I can't be the only one who runs into this with dual monitors so any advice for how to handle this?\n\nA: Just make sure you remember to activate the text area you want to type in by clicking on it first, condition yourself to be aware of what is active.\n\n\n*\n\n*Pay attention to which application is active\n[insert image of Mac OS x application bar]\n\n*Pay attention to which window in an application is active, notice the differences in title bar color and transparency.\n[insert image of window active differences in an os x app]\n\n*Pay attention to what and if any text input areas are selected and ready for text input.\n[insert image of blinking input cursor -->| in text area ]\n\n*Be redundant and just click if you don't want to do the above observations. \nThis seems to crop up since scrolling works with out having to click on the window / content, and I think this leads us into a confused state that we have activated the app / window by placing the cursor over it and scrolling. \nHowever that is not the case since scrolling a window by just mouse-ing over does not change which program was originally active. And to enter text or do other command actions that still requires that you tell Mac OS where your intending your input to go other wise it remembers the last active place selected.\nAnd actually for other OS's this is a feature, called focus follow pointer or mouse but unfortunatly is not really implemented at a system wide level on OS X according to comments and feedback noted here Focus-follows-mouse (plus auto-raise) on Mac OS X. So it is not something you can easily enable in system preferences, and as far as I can tell no 3rd party App exist to add this functionality to OS X.\nThere are some defaults work arounds for certain apps to allow windows in those certain apps to be activated on mouse over, but unfortunately there does not seem to be a system wide option for OS X.\n\nA: Have you tried using Isolator? It essentially darkens all windows except the one on focus. You have different options on the filter, so you can make sure that you can still read what's on other windows (otherwise it kind of defeats the point of having two monitors!). And of course you can set a keyboard shortcut for that.\nThe only drawback of Isolator is that it works by application, rather than by window. What often happens to me is that I start typing in the Matlab editor when I want to run something from the command line... and Isolator doesn't help in that case. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find a solution to that.\n\nA: The way I handle this is that I treat the second monitor as more or less read-only. I move windows over there that I want to read but only interact with windows on the main screen. If I want to work with a window that's on the second screen I just move it to the first screen first.\nAlternately, I use exposé and swap between entire spaces.\n\nA: To highlight a single window that has keyboard focus try Hazeover. It can either highlight one window on each display or dim all screens that you're not using. \n\nA: Some potentially useful advice for part \"focus on hover\" with dual screens. It doesn't fix \"typing\" when some input box is active on another monitor but it might help people who come here for all aspects of \"focus on hover\".\nWithout this fix I always had to \"focus click\" in a monitor before I can contextually click on anything at all.\nYou can get some aspects of \"focus on hover\" with this:\n\n*\n\n*Go into 'System Preferences'\n\n*Select option 'Mission Control'\n\n*In there you should see 'Displays have separate Spaces', untick it\n\nThen at least with Monitor1 selected, now you can instantly click on something in Monitor2, like an email or Tab, without needing the first \"focus click\".\nAs always can be the case, this may not work for everyone depending on OS version and probably other things.\n", "Q: What is this odd Excel file doing here? Recently, I was working on an Excel file when the program closed unexpectedly; luckily, my work was mostly saved by the recovery feature of Excel. However, Excel created a file on my desktop, titled \"FD4C0910\" that cannot be compressed, deleted, or moved. Upon attempting to \"Get Info\" (both with the keyboard shortcut, ⌘+I, and by right clicking and selecting \"Get Info\"), nothing happens. Double clicking the file, or even highlighting and pressing ⌘+O, does nothing. Here is an image of the phenomenon:\n\n\n(This is the message that appears upon attempting to delete the file.)\nCan anyone explain what this is and how to get rid of it?\n\nA: This is a known bug in Office for Mac 2011.  The icons represent temporary files that have been deleted.  (Probably before they were deleted they were invisible.) You cannot Get Info on the files or find the files via Terminal because they do not exists; the bug is that the Finder is still showing them.  If you force-quit the Finder it will restart and the file icons will be gone. \nThe best workaround to keep them from coming back seems to be to move files off the desktop and into a folder before opening them.  \n\nA: I have seen these as well and I believe that it is a temporary file. In my experience they are erased after a system restart. There is a more detailed explanation and a few suggestions on long term fixes (i.e. repairing the file permissions) on the Apple Discussion Board here: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2731410.\n", "Q: Enter \"vertical bar\" (or \"pipe symbol\") in Windows I have my MacBook late 2008 sometimes running Windows 7 via BootCamp.

In Keychain Access it looks like you can only untrust/delete certificates one at a time.\nBut there are a lot of certificates I want to get rid of. How can I take care of them all at the same time?\nAlso, what are the minimum certificate requirements? Is it possible to make the system unusable by untrusting a certificate?\n\nA: If You want to change set of system root certificates, they are in /System/Library/Keychains/.\nExample of using security there is in this answer to similar question.\n\nA: You can script keychain events from the command line with the security command. On Lion and earlier, the worst that will happen if you delete all the system roots is you won't be able to run software update or use iTunes and other applications that interface with secure web services.\nIt might be easier just to make a keychain file you like and shove that in place of the ones Apple provides and watch for changes when you do apply software updates.\n", "Q: How can I use iPhone GPS and share it with an OS X application to get live position on Mac?

Anyways, I am clean-reinstalling my mum's MacBook Pro and I came across a problem. First, I went into recovery mode (Command-R at startup) then erased the Macintosh HD drive. After have had with my computer previously:\n\n\n*\n\n*Date being set to 2001. (As a programmer I know this is a default NSDate.)\n\n*Microsoft Word keeps on bringing up random popups.\n\n*Warning that apps may behave erratically because of the date (maybe why Word does that).\n\n*Safari always needs to confirm some Facebook certificate keychain signing thing.\n\n*Quite slow/buggy\n\n*And also, the back of the MacBook screen has a problem that when I press on it the screen gets blurry at that part. (Like strongly touching the screen)\n\n\nSo then when I try to reinstall, the Macbook needs to check its authenticity with Apple, where it needs to gather some installation information. It just gets stuck here, nothing happens; I left it for 2 hours and it is still trying to gather information.\nSo, what do you think is generally wrong with this computer and how can I fix this problem? Do you think the only way out is to arrange an appointment with Apple?\n\nA: Most of the problems seem to be coming from having the wrong date (and possibly not having internet access).\nYou might as well zap the PRAM. If you have problems, see here.  Then be sure you are connected to both power and internet when you reboot.  If necessary, set the clock manually.  \nThe issue with the screen, well, it depends on how hard you're pressing and which model MacBook you're using, but it is not necessarily unusual.  \nUPDATE: I've been reminded that one cause of computer slowness is a failing hard drive.  Sadly, despite S.M.A.R.T status reporting, it's very hard to be sure if a drive is failing until it has completely failed.  See if you can boot off an external drive and compare the performance.\n\nA: My recommendation: try running the Apple Hardware Test.\nQuick version, hold D at startup. Long version, see link.\nThis will at least give you some more info to let you know if you should make a reservation to see an Apple Genius. As someone who actually works at an Apple Store, this is one of the very first things a Genius would do.\nAnd please make a reservation before you go in, it will make the whole process much smoother!

I don't know if this is normal, but about 10 minutes ago my MacBook Air shut down. I plugged it in and pressed the power button and my screen looked odd for about 20-30 seconds. I decided to take a picture of it because it does this every time my battery dies and I plug it in, so here it is:\n\nSee how it looks? I don't know why it's doing this. Does anyone know what this is?\nEdit (to @OldPro)\nHere's a picture of how the screen normally looks:\n\n\nA: Normally when you put the Mac book to sleep, it powers down the CPU but leaves power supplied to the memory and other internals so that when you wake it up it can start right away. When you run out of battery power, though, it has to write all of the memory to disk because it doesn't have enough power left to keep the data in memory.   This is called \"hibernating\" or safe sleep.\nWhen you wake up from hibernation, it takes some time (typically 20-30 seconds) to restore the data from disk to memory. I think that's what's going on in your case.  Is the computer responsive when the screen looks odd like this? If not, then that's almost certainly what's going on.\n\nA: This is the loading screen of you're MacBook recovering from safe sleep, after u carelessly allowed it to fall to 0% battery.\nSafe sleep is a feature which is similar to hibernate in windows, it stores the RAM's contents to a file on your hard disk (called the sleep image) and allows you to restore it in the case that power is cut and RAM loses its contents.\nNotice the progress bar near your dock? That indicates the progress of copying that sleep image back into RAM\n", "Q: How do I remove drafts from the iOS Notification Center? When I pull down the Notification center on either my iPad or iPhone, it displays 5 emails (I have it set to that), but they are not the unread emails at the top of my inbox. They all appear to be drafts! When I click on them they take me to that particular draft, and I can't seem to find a way to locate and delete that draft. I have looked through all of my accounts and mostly cleared out all the drafts that are listed, but none of them have been the five that show up in my Notification center. It has me stumped as to how that is happening on both of my iDevices. Note that it isn't the same drafts, but only the ones that were created on those devices. Also, when new email comes in, it does display on top of the others.\nThis is a somewhat recent problem, and both devices have worked as expected before.\nSo my questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I access a list (and delete) of drafts that have been created\non the iPhone, or iPad itself?\n\n*How do I fix the notification center? I suppose if I can delete the drafts, that the problem might go away.\n\n\nA: Apple does hide the settings for the drafts folder pretty well, but in general you have a choice of saving drafts on the device or on your mail server.  It seems you have set them to be on the device.  I suggest moving them to the server. \nHere's how I get to the setting for my account.  Your path might be slightly different as I think it is different for different kinds of servers:\n\n\n*\n\n*Settings\n\n*Mail, Contacts, Calendars\n\n*Under \"Accounts\", click on the mail account to bring up a popup with settings for that account\n\n*Select \"Account\" again\n\n*Select \"Advanced\"\n\n*Under \"Mailbox Behaviors\" select \"Drafts Mailbox\"\n\n*Under \"On the Server\" select the \"Drafts\" mailbox\n\n\nI like having them on the server as then they are synced everywhere.  \n\nA: Delete the drafts by going to the Mail app, then tapping on Mailboxes in the left hand corner, then tapping Drafts. Then you will see a list of all your drafts. (will post screenshots)\n\nA: You've already cleared the notifications by tapping the (ridiculously tiny) X button, but I just wanted to add more information about drafts for future readers.\niOS Mail does not display a unified Drafts mailbox in the Mailboxes list. You can access each account's Drafts folder (whether it's stored locally or on the server) by tapping on that account. If there's a Drafts folder, and there should be, you'll see it there.\nJust because the unified list of Drafts isn't in the Mailboxes list, doesn't mean it isn't there. At any time, you can tap and hold on the Compose button to access a list of all your unsent drafts in every account. You can swipe drafts to delete them, just like a normal mailbox.\n", "Q: How do I find out what entitlements an app has? Sandboxed apps have to declare their entitlements.  Of course, that doesn't do me any good if I can't tell what entitlements it declares.  A text editor that has entitlements for Core Location, Network Server, and my Address Book, without my knowledge, could be much worse than an unsandboxed app.\nHow can I see what entitlements an app has?\n\nA: After some more searching, I found a command-line answer:\ncodesign -d --entitlements :- /Applications/Whatever.app/\n\nThis will print out an XML plist with values like:\n<key>com.apple.security.app-sandbox</key>\n<true/>\n<key>com.apple.security.files.user-selected.read-write</key>\n<true/>\n\nFor more information see https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/qa/qa1798/_index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40014167-CH1-IOS_STEPS\nIf anyone knows an easier/nicer way, though, I'd love to hear it.\n", "Q: Can I have separate Game Center accounts on two different iOS devices registered to the same Apple ID?

Can we get a separate Game Center ID for him?\n\nA: Yes - the Game Center sign-in can be the same or different than the Apple ID entered in other places (i.e. iTunes Store and iCloud). \nMake your son an Apple ID for his Game Center and later he can use it for other uses.\n", "Q: Screen sharing fails to connect I have chronic problems connecting to my headless Mac Mini using Mac OS X's builtin screen sharing. Usually it works fine, but sometimes it will not connect. \nIt goes like this: \nI initiate a connection (either by clicking the Mac Mini in the sidebar in a Finder window and choosing the \"Share Screen...\" button, or else by launching /System/Library/CoreServices/Screen Sharing.app and enter the Bonjour name \"macmini.local\"), the throbber appears with the word \"connecting\", then the throbber disappears. If it's going to connect successfully, it does so at this point. Often, however the throbber disappears and nothing replaces it. The Screen Sharing app remains active, no message appears, and nothing happens, no matter how long I leave it. No connection seems to occur.\nI cannot cause the issue to occur reliably, but once it does occur, it can be observed from several different mac clients. If I reboot the remote machine (via shutdown over ssh), it goes away and I connect without problem, but I'm seeking a better solution.\nChecking the processes running on the remote Mac Mini via ssh, I see two processes, /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/screensharingd.bundle/Contents/MacOS/screensharingd owned by root, and a child process /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ScreensharingAgent.bundle/Contents/MacOS/ScreensharingAgent. If I try to kill either of these processes, they change their PID but remain running, and it does not allow me to connect.\nFrom this thread Restart Screen Sharing Service on Mac mini Server I learned how to properly restart the screen sharing daemon. Or actually two methods. Not sure which one is proper, so I do them both. Does not help, still cannot connect.\nFrom this thread Why is Mac-to-Mac screen sharing just hanging? I learned the suggestion to connect by IP address instead of bonjour name. Upon trying this, I get the login window, instead of the \"connecting\" throbber. Still no connection, though. And quitting Screen Sharing on the local machine doesn't get rid of the stuck login window. The only way to rid yourself of it is to kill NetAuthAgent, as I learned in this thread: How to kill stuck Screen sharing authentication dialogue?\nBoth machines run Lion (10.7.4), though I've been observing this behavior since 10.6, perhaps 10.5 I can't remember. Remote machine is a 2009 Mac Mini, and the local machine is a MacBook Pro (this behavior has been duplicated on many different client machines though).\nSurely there must be some process, server, daemon on the remote machine that I can bounce? Something short of rebooting?\n\nA: ssh into the remote Mac and kill the screensharingd daemon.\n$ ps ax | grep screen\n1234   ??  Ss     0:00.02 /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/screensharingd.bundle/Contents/MacOS/screensharingd\n$ sudo kill 1234 \n\nIt works for me. I have Mac OS X Lion on both local and remote computers.\n\nA: Screen sharing by itself worked perfectly well when enabled in my Mac Mini sharing preferences. However, as soon as I enabled Remote management, it removed Screen sharing and stopped working claiming that Screen sharing is handled by Remote management … what ever that is. I just disabled Remote management and used Screen sharing to get around the problem.\n\nA: Logging out of MobileMe on the client machine solved this problem for me.\n\nA: Logging out of MobileMe in System Preferences instantly fixed the issue for 2 coworkers who were having the same issue.  They were both on 10.7.4- not sure if it affects lower versions.  My system on 10.8 obviously was not affected as the MobileMe settings have been removed from System Preferences.\n\nA: I'm in a similar situation, and am never confident to run my 2010 mini headless for this very reason since Lion, or even before that.\nRunning Mountain Lion (10.8.3), Remote Management is turned off, and I think the problem may stem from issues with authentication. When I can't connect through Screen Sharing, I turn on the projector to see what it's doing. After I enter the screen saver password and get to the desktop, Screen Sharing works again.\nI'm going to try running the mini without any screen saver password to see what happens.\nI'm also running Rowmote Pro and Little Snitch, and am inclined to think the former would be more problematic as it's an additional input method.\nI'll report back later with my findings.\n\nA: Guys check the Firewall - it need to be disable or create an exception . thats the most common issue and this always works. \n", "Q: Mouse sticks only when dropping with drag and drop. I'm having a problem with dragging and dropping on my Mac. The icon is picked up, but it doesn't let go most of the time; it's almost as though I've still got the button down.\nPlease note: this only happens with dragging and dropping, not with highlighting text. When I do that, the trackpad releases as you would expect. If it didn't, I'd suspect a hardware error but it just works perfectly for everything else (highlighting text, playing games etc).\nWhat can I do to fix this?\n\nA: I had a similar problem and solved it by relaunching the Finder (Force Quit).\n", "Q: Can I transfer videos from iTunes to an iPad not associated with it? I've got some (non-DRM) videos in iTunes that I'd like to transfer to my wife's iPad. She bought the iPad and set it up without ever connecting it to a computer, so it's never been synched with iTunes anywhere.\nWhen I plug the iPad into my laptop, I'm asked if I want to register. When I click Register Later, I see this:\n\nI'm concerned that selecting Set up as a new iPad will wipe out my wife's settings and / or content. Can I select that option safely, or is there some other way of getting my videos onto her iPad?\nUpdate: I should note that I can't simply drag video files to the iPad in the iTunes sidebar. The iPad shows up like this:\n\nRight clicking on the iPad in the sidebar produces only two options: \"Eject iPad\" or \"Restore from backup\". No option to Transfer Purchases, though the iPad and Mac are both configured to use the same Apple ID for the iTunes Store.\nI assume I should be looking for the iPad to show up, as an iPhone does, with a list of media types underneath it so that I can view / drag things to its library.\nI've also confirmed I can't drag video downloaded from the iTunes Store, either, so it's probably not a format conflict.\n\nA: New set up will wipe out everything.\nYou can plug iPad into her iTunes and mark the option \"Manually manage music and videos\", save (sync), then plug again on your computer.\nIf you are careful when cross connecting, you can prevent cross-syncing the same information from two computers for this iPad, but still have each computer take care of part of the sync \"situation\".\nother option is:\nCopy the videos to her iTunes, then add them to her iPad from there.\nLast option:\n- Backup all the app data, videos, music and even pdf files with third party software (TouchCopy, iExplorer, PhoneToMac or any other you like). Do not backup system files.\n- Set up the iPad.\n- Copy everything back using the same third party software.\n\nA: I can confirm that, in fact, selecting \"Set up as new iPad\" in the dialog shown in the question had no effect on the iPad. This may or may not be because I had set iTunes to prevent iOS devices from syncing automatically in its Settings. \niTunes brought up the standard iOS-device user interface, and I was able to drag and drop media onto the iPad from there.\n", "Q: Macbook Air's keyboard malfunction after spill. How to work around it? I spilled coffee over my mac's air keyboard yesterday. The computer seems to work but the keyboard doesn't. The symptoms:\n\n\n*\n\n*The laptop boots into the drive selection screen every time (alt key constantly pressed?)\n\n*The caps lock, arrow, enter, esc keys all seem to work\n\n*I can't enter my password at the boot screen. Some key-presses seem to be registered but obviously not the correct ones. For example, pressing the N key once doesn't show a keystroke, but pressing it twice does. It feels like there's some function/alt/ctrl/shift key that might be constantly pressed, but I can't tell which one, or make it behave differently by pressing those.\n\n*An external keyboard (either bluetooth or usb) doesn't behave differently\n\n*If I choose the guest mode, the computer will boot into the Safari only mode. The same thing will happen there - some keys will show wrong signs when typed in the address bar, and at some points the keyboard stops responding.\n\n*The external keyboard however seems to work in that guest mode.\n\n\nQuestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can you help me understand what exactly is the problem with the keyboard?\n\n*Can anyone think of a way to log in to the regular mode?\n\n*Assuming the keyboard is the only thing broken, can it normally be serviced on a Macbook Air?\n\n\nThanks!\n\nA: keyboards are 2 layers of plastic film with tiny electric contact, separated by a third layer of plastic film with holes on the spot of every single key.\nwhen you press a key, the top and bottom plastic are pressed against one another inside the hole of the middle layer, and the electronic signal going from the top to the bottom layer tells your computer that the key is pressed.\nproblem is: separation is the same as an average good quality book paper sheet, or maybe the same as the aluminum sheet that makes a soda or beer can. also, the electricity that goes trough your keyboard is extremely tiny, and sensors are VERRY sensible, so your air battery can lasts longer.\nSo even if you have a single hair touching those circuits, your keyboard would \"break\" the same way it breaks when you spill coffee or whatever liquid; even after the liquid dries, the coffee and the sugar are probably still there \"pressing\" your alt key.\nsolution: (this will probably void any warranty) open your computer carefully, remove the keyboard, dismantle all keys one by one, separate the plastic layers with surgical precision so you don't cause any ruptures to the electric \"wires\", then wash everything with a lot of water and very little mild soap, take extra care to remove ALL the soap, leave everything to dry in the sun (you know electronic components don't like humidity, right?) assemble everything together with \"just-washed\" oil free hands (don't touch the inner part of the sensors now).\nDoing all this, if you have any luck your keyboard might work 100% again... or maybe you might make it stop working entirely, who knows? =)\nif you have some money, then backup you computer, go to the applestore and tell them you want to buy a new keyboard, because you broke the current one.\nthey shall give you a brand new (refurbished?) one, and charge you only the new keyboard. or they might give the same one back to you, who knows? haha.\n\nA: If the \"n\" key is only working after the second press, your option key is probably one of the ones shorted. Because option-n will activate the tilde mode, and the second press will give you an \"ñ\" character. \n\nA: Found a software workaround here\nI had the same issue (left alt key stucked after a water spill)\n\n\n*\n\n*Plug a usb keyboard to be able to log in\n\n*Download and install Karabiner.\n\n*Find exactly which key is faulty with Karabiner Event Viewer\n\n*Enabled sticky keys in accessibility system config panel\n\n*In my case, remapped the left option to it's right counterpart for my internal keyboard (first panel \"simple modification\") of Karabiner.\n\n*Set Karabiner config to be System Default Config so I can log before session opening (Misc, last panel)\n\nA: I’ll try to make my answer as short as possible.\nI spilled a small amount of coffee on my Macbook Air keyboard about a year and a half ago.  The keyboard went out.  Took it to an off-brand computer store to have it looked at.  They said it requires a new keyboard or just buy a new computer since they can’t guarantee the new keyboard won’t also go out and costs will add up.\nSearched online for help.  Didn’t want to go through tedious opening and dismantling macbook since I tried that with a previous PC.  So I purchased a generic keyboard that works with iOS and used it until I found by accident a post that said to “rinse” with distilled water the keyboard and let dry thoroughly because distilled water doesn’t harm the computer components.\nI was using my Macbook in a very humid and damp environment recently and the keyboard started to work inadvertently.  When I returned to a dryer environment it stopped working again.  I figured what do I have to lose - I’ll give the rinsing a try.  The coffee sugar and cream must be dried inside.\nI rubbed the keyboard with a very wet towel and then lay a thick layer of paper towels between the top and bottom and turned the computer upside down so any liquid gunk would soak into the paper towels.  I did this about five times.  Voila!  My keyboard works after all this time!!!!!\nI let it dry out over night and recharged it and it’s back to working.  Simple fix for rewetting dried sticky gunk under the keyboard and drawing it out.  Kind of like washing clothes.\n", "Q: can I get the \"date\" of a photo with iPhoto on iOS?

Only thing I can do is watch it.\nI'd like to be able to open the link to video in native youtube app, or at least open the YouTube web page of that video.\nIs there a way to do it?\n\nA: The following applies to IOS 8 on iPhone:\nA YouTube logo appears in the lower right corner of embedded YouTube videos. \nIf you click on the usual big round 'play button' in the center of the embedded video, it will play fullscreen inside Safari. However if you click on the YouTube logo, the video will open in the YouTube app.\n\nA: There's a way in iOS 5, but I don't know what happens in iOS 6 and 7, after they removed the YouTube app…\nIn iOS 5, at the top of the video is the video's title. That title is a hyperlink — tapping it opens the video in the iOS 5 YouTube app.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro won't find network boot disk My optical drive doesn't work on my MacBook Pro, and my Internet connection is too slow to use the recovery partition to download Lion. I have a disk and a Windows PC I can use on the same network.\nI installed the disk sharing software from Apple on the PC, and used the remote install program that comes on the disc.\nI hold down Option ⌥ when booting up my MacBook. It is plugged in via Ethernet to the same network, but the network disk never appears. If I press N then the network icon appears, pulsing, but it never finds the Windows shared disk.\nWhat am I doing wrong? Will this work better if plug the Ethernet cable directly from the PC to the Mac, skipping over the network?\n\nA: You need a network boot server to be running somewhere on the network as Macs can't just see another CD without more help. Internet recovery is Apple's way of solving this on the newer hardware.\nSomething like DeployStudio would be my first recommendation for a modern, free, and all in one setup. This tool will handle the network request from the Mac and provide it with software to run so that you can then start an installation. I don't know of a boot image that is capable of doing a remote disk installation so you might do some learning with net boot, but ultimately just go get a USB drive or get help from someone with the setup ready to do a restore. Many Apple Stores are set up to image a machine while you wait through the genius bar.\n\nA: The first other option you have is if you backed up your computer using Time machine, just turn the machine off, plug the drive in with your Time Machine Backup, Power the machine on and hold the option key. It will display the Time machine disk with the ability to restore from your backup or reinstall the  Operating System. If you don't have a backup.. great resource is just take it to the Apple Store and they can install Lion, Mountain Lion free of charge (clean install). The 3rd option that will work is find a friend with a Macbook Pro and target Disk your machine to his/hers and you can install the  Operating System that way by telling the installer to install it to the external disk (which is you HDD (Hard Drive))\n", "Q: ZEVO ZFS and Aperture I'ld like to use ZEVO (ZFS) on my Storage-Device. There shall the Aperture-Library be stored.\nAre there any issues using an Aperture - Library on ZFS formatted device.\nThanks allot\n\nA: You can't run an Aperture Library from a device that's not formatted Mac OS Extended (Journaled).\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT3509\nWhat can work is running a Referenced Library with the Library on an appropriately formatted disk and the Masters stored elsewhere.\nAnother workaround: Make a Disk Image formatted Mac OS Extended (Journaled) and store that on your device.\n", "Q: Is it possible to access a Mac via SSH without administrator access? I want to be able to SSH into my Mac, but it's disabled in System Preferences (Sharing --> Remote Connections, I believe). The administrator disabled this, and I'm looking for a way to re-enable it without an admin password. Is there a way I can re-install SSH to enable it, or something along those lines?\n\nA: Not easily and you may be running afoul of policy if you are circumventing the access policies of a computer to which you are not supposed to be modifying the security stance.\nIf you were to run sshd in your user space, you will need to use a port higher than 1024 and also hope that the firewall and network will allow you to accept inbound traffic on the port you chose.\nHere is a decent article on how you would do this with admin permissions. It's not a perfect fit for Mac OS - but should give you a feel for what the issues are in your quest to set up sshd.\nAlso, netcat.\n\nA: It's possible:\nUser:\ndseditgroup -o edit -n /Local/Default -u localadmin -p -a username -t user com.apple.access_ssh\n\nGroup:\ndseditgroup -o edit -n /Local/Default -u localadmin -p -a groupname -t group com.apple.access_ssh\n\nMake sure to insert your local admin's short name (localadmin) and the user (username) or group (groupname) you're trying to add.\n", "Q: Saving output from PDFs merged using Automator Using Automator, I tried to create a simple application, but I don’t know how to move ahead. I want to combine PDFs into a single file. The current workflow is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ask for Finder Items\n\n*Combine PDF Pages\n\n*?\n\n\nWhat should I do to ask for a menu to save the combined PDF using a specified name?\n\nA: When working with Automator workflows, it’s always good to check hat an action takes as its input and what it returns as output. Usually, this is indicated in the action’s description (accessible either in the bottom left below the action browser, or by clicking on “description” in the action’s bottom row. The actual output when running the action can also be checked (by clicking “result” in the bottom row of the action).\nIn your case, checking will show the “Combine PDF Pages” returns a PDF Document file. This file can be processed by any Automator action that can handle files in general (for file operations) or PDF files (for further editing). A look in the “Finder” category of Automator will show you likely candidates:\n\n\n*\n\n*Move Finder Items will move the file to a target folder of your choice. You can set a fixed one, or tick “Show this action when running the workflow” in “options” (bottom row again) to select each time you run the workflow. This action, again, returns a PDF Document, which\n\n*Rename Finder Items will rename a file. As the action returns a PDF Document, you can daisy chain rename actions with different settings, for instance to give it a selectable base name (choose “rename single item” and tick the show option), add a date stamp (add another actions et to append the date) and a time stamp (same procedure, now with the time).\n\n\nA: Here is my Services item Workflow for combining PDFs. Hope this helps.\n\n\n*\n\n*\"Get Selected Finder Items\" (Can also use \"Ask for Finder Items\")\n\n*\"Combine PDF Pages\" - (Combine Documents by Appending Pages Selected)\n\n*\"Move Finder Items\" - (To: Desktop)\n\n*\"Label Finder Items\" - (Red)\n\n\nA: As I know, the end of step 2 is a file somewhere in the HDD (maybe in var/tmp, I don't remember). \nSo, I did this a long time ago, and I use, as 3rd step, Move Items from Finder (or whatever it's name, note that I speak Spanish, and the system too) and I could select the folder to save this file. After that, change the file's name —it's like a random characters name.\n", "Q: Does activating Find My Phone deplete the battery on an iOS device being tracked? My phone is currently riding around New York City under the seat of a taxi cab. I'm watching its progress with the Find iPhone app. \nMy concern is the phone may soon die and a rider or driver will not see the messages for assistance being sent. \nDoes tracking my iPhone with Find iPhone deplete the battery?\n\nA: Yes - triggering a location update does use more battery than if the phone were simply idle and chatting from time to time with cell towers to be ready to receive a notification, email or phone call.\nNo - the high power location drain when you have a GPS mapping program running in the foreground isn't what happens when you use the web site to request one location update.\n\nAs long as you are not constantly sending a ping noise or managing to hammer the find my phone interface with a non-stop stream of requests, the phone will be quite efficient with the screen off, a quick location update and then it will go back to idle power and consume no more power than if it were sitting in your pocket.\nThink of the function as this:\n\n\n*\n\n*You log into find my phone (web or another iOS device) and the service looks up all your devices and sends one refresh to each.\n\n*The device gets a notification over either of the connections it always attempts to keep open to Apple via both Wi-Fi and cellular data channels.\n\n*Apple says - \"hey - figure out where you are and then report back\"\n\n*Your phone does it's location dance as best it can with available GPS, cell tower, and Wi-Fi and then tells Apple where it thinks it might be (and how accurate a fix it thinks it has achieved).\n\n*Apple says thanks and your phone goes back to being idle (presumably powering down GPS once not recently requested).\n\n*You then see that location update on your display. Apple caches the data, so you will see the last known location for quite a while before it goes to \"location unknown\" over a period of hours and the last fix becomes stale.\n\n", "Q: Can someone read messages on my locked iPhone? I left my iPhone in a taxi cab. I locked the phone to make sure nobody finds it and makes expensive calls. But does locking the phone prevent someone from seeing the texts I am sending? What if the battery dies? After the phone is recharged, will the texts I send still be readable if the phone is locked?\n\nA: Your sending a lock doesn't change the settings you had on the phone prior to losing it.\nIf messages were showing on the screen - they will still show.\nIf not, they will not.\n\nIf you have find my phone enabled and are concerned about changing this, you could send a remote erase (and then lose all ability to track it again) and have it resort to the default behavior. I'm hesitant to erase my phone now to test, but am fairly certain the default is towards privacy and further messages would not be displayed on the lock screen when the phone reboots or is powered on again.\n\nA: The messages, which you sent using Find my iPhone will be shown on the lock screen even if your phone is locked. \n\nA: If you locked the phone through iCloud / MobileMe it will appear the same as if you enabled the lock on the device itself, plus it will lock immediately (as soon as the action is done) and you'll receive an email notification telling you that it is done.\nThe iPhone will remain locked after it has been shutdown or lost all its charge. So, in theory, it shouldn't give up your messages.\n\nA: They may not be able to log onto AT&T or unlock your phone to read your texts. However, if they have access to your iPhone, they can listen to your texts!  Even under Settings → Notifications with the Show on Lock Screen option off, all someone has to do is ask Siri to read messages and she will! So turn off Siri to keep those text private!\n", "Q: Will I be able to use Find iPhone if my battery is dead? Will the location of my iPhone be updated if the battery is dead? Is there any way to know if the battery on my iPhone has died? \n\nA: On iOS 7 and a newer version of Find My Phone/iCloud, the battery level is reported so you can know approximately how much longer the tracking might be active without a recharge.\nWhen this question was asked, the battery level was not shown so the answer then was no.\nEither way, once your iPhone runs out of power, it will shut itself off. There is residual power left in the phone to run the screen and respond to buttons for a while, but once that last remaining power drains, eventually the voltage in the battery is not sufficient to run even the button sensing part of the device.\nPlugging it into power will re-start your phone and once it establishes a network connection, find my phone will resume.\nIn your case - if Find My Phone says your device is not found - you can't really tell if it was turned off by intention or automatically or has lost network connectivity (by having a SIM removed or just being out of range).\n\nA: I have lost my phone as well, but without the internet, I have a tip for discharged phone finding. One tip is to find the phone in the least obvious places ( start with your house). I actually found my phone in the artificial tree at our house! (Not really expected). Hope this tip helps!\n", "Q: Is there a second-generation Airport Express 802.11n? In late 2011 there were refreshes to Airport Extreme and Time Capsule. At the time there was speculation that there would be a second generation of the Airport Express 802.11n model. \nI'm in the market for a new one but I can't find any solid evidence that there was actually a new model ever released. I notice when checking my current model's serial number that Apple specifies it as AirPort Express 802.11n (1st Gen), which makes me think there's a later generation, but again I have no actual info on it.\nDoes anyone have an answer on this?\n\nA: Not yet on a 2nd gen 802.11n Express.\nApple has published four different manuals on the Airport Express:\n\n\n*\n\n*AirPort Express 802.11n (1st Generation) - Setup Guide\nThe three expresses prior to that were not 802.11n so perhaps that's where the three previous generations (and the 1st and only newer generation names have come to be) A tad confusing, no?\n\nA: It's out now i guess -- AirPort Express 802.11n (2nd Generation): Guide to ports and connectors\n", "Q: Any Way to Remotely Control (or at Least View) an iPad without Jailbreaking? There must be thousands of people in the same situation as me, so I find it hard to believe there isn't a solution.  But I've looked all over and have come up dry.\nMy elderly Dad got an iPad and is having trouble with it.  He's no dummy, but iOS is new to him and he's not good at describing his problem and what he's seeing to me, 1100 miles away.  I'm sure I could help him if I could just see what he sees.\nI had installed LogMeIn on his laptop, and could remotely control and view his screen when he had problems.  I know iOS is different and has different levels of sandboxing and other protection from Windows.\nBut is there any way to remotely view a WiFi-connected iPad, without jailbreaking?  If not, this seems like a great opportunity for an app developer, or maybe Apple if things are too locked down for a 3rd party app.\n\nA: The only workable solution I have found to the problem is a second device such as an iPod or iPhone running FaceTime or Skype so that you can see and talk with the person you are supporting.\nWith a gorilla tripod that flexes and something like the glif - this works amazingly well and everything needed has many other uses which does not lessen the impact on one's budget, but does ease the value proposition of this solution.\n\nAnd - the approved way to get video off your iPad is through AirPlay mirroring which works with bonjour to find an AirPlay receiver on the local network. Currently, Apple TV and a Mac with some software (like Reflector. So if you had a Mac with your Dad or equivalent software on his PC, you could at least see his screen. The two drawbacks to this (in addition to the extra hardware and software) are you can't see where he is tapping and you can't control the iPad remotely.\n\nA: If it's an iPhone 4S, iPad 2 or new iPad, Reflector can do this.\n\nA: Use Skype with mirrors, I haven't tried it but its possible\n", "Q: If my phone is lost and locked, how will someone know how to contact me? My iPhone 4S is currently in someone else's hands. I can see it with Find My Phone. I have sent a number of messages to the phone in the hope that whoever has it will return it. But since the phone is locked, does that mean I have to include contact information in the messages I send? Or is there some information in the message that lets this culprit know how to get in touch?\n\n\nA: While the phone is locked with a passcode, the only way someone could find the device's identity is to use a paperclip to remove the SIM tray. There the serial number and IMEI are printed on the tray. Also the ICCID (your SIM number) may be visible as well.\nAt that point, the finder could potentially reach out to Apple and/or your carrier that both presumably have some form of contact information to reach you - but your best bet is to send a message to the device with your contact information.\nUnless you want to call your phone and hope someone answers. That also could place some contact information on the lock screen depending on your settings.\n\nA: If your phone is already lost then the message you send via Find My Phone needs to include a number to call or other contact information.\nIt's best to prepare ahead of time by including contact information on your lock screen. In fact, it's even better to include emergency contact info, so that in case you are involved in an accident,  emergency services personnel can easily look at your iPhone and call your emergency contact.  (Yes, they check your phone for just that purpose.)\nThere is was a convenient and free app called If Found that makes such a lock screen image for you, but it, along with If Found, Please have been taken down.

Here's my situation: I have a Klipsch Promedia 2.1 system and the left channel died. The left speaker works fine when plugged in the right speaker output on the sub. Right now I have both speaker wires in the right speaker output in the sub so I get the right channel on the L and R speakers. Is it possible to play both the left and right channels on the iMac through the right channel so I at least hear everything from both channels?\n\nA: There is a Universal Access option to do this.\n\n\nA: Open System Preferences > Sound > Output. There's a slider that allows you to change the balance between the left and right channels. Sliding it all the way to the right will play all the sound from the system through the right channel (essentially mono instead of stereo).\n\nA: Buy a mono 3.5mm audio cable, plug it in, you will have both output channels hard-mixed and played on both speakers.\nIf the cable on your speaker is non-removable, simply buy a 3 inch male-to-female one.\nAnd if you can not find a cable like this, go to a shop that sells audio cables for guitar players and ask one to be made for you. You will hardly pay more than 10 bucks on such a thing.\nAnalog solution to a digital problem, YAY!\n", "Q: Where do certificates come from? On my system when I check Keychain Access I often find new certificates. They get put there behind the scenes. Is that normal? When does this happen? Is there a way I can get alerted when a certificate gets added to the keychain?\n\nA: Apple may occasionally approve additions to new Root CAs e.g. Verisign, who can then sign certificates for individual sites you visit.  \nThe root certificates for OS X El Capitan are here https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205204\nI assume these are done in software updates via the App Store, but I don't know for sure.\nAlso your company may add additional self signed certificates for internal reasons or installing development software.\nBut AFAIK keychain won't bloat over time as you visit new sites, so the list should be fairly static.\n\nA: If you get signed and or encrypted email from folks who use SMIME, Mail.app will helpfully add their public x509 certificates to your login keychain.\nA pretty good explanation of the process can be found at Secure emails with Apple Mail\n", "Q: Macbook Pro just started overheating and losing frame rate It's strange because I've had Diablo III for a couple weeks now and I've been able to play it just fine without any performance problems. Starting today though, I've experienced some serious performance problems. I can play for at most a minute, during which time the computer will get hotter and louder, until the frame rate completely drops off the map and I'm forced to quit. It's a similar story with HD youtube videos.\nI tried letting the computer just sit idle and cool down, but that doesn't seem to fix the problem. Only restarting seems to fix it, but that only gets me another minute of play time before I need to restart again.\nUpdate\nForgot to mention\nIt's a mid 2010 Macbook Pro 15\" with 8 GB of ram\n\nA: This sounds to me as a problem with the graphics processor getting overheated. I burned two of them playing WoW.\nReplacing the thermal paste, cleaning the fans and using the laptop in the right place (not holding it against the legs, in bed, or using it on a glass table) made a great difference. \n", "Q: What are the three different bookmark features in Safari used for? I'm confused as to how to use Safari's Bookmark feature. There are three different options when you go into \"Show all bookmarks\" view:\n\n\n*\n\n*Bookmarks Bar\n\n*Bookmarks Menu\n\n*Bookmarks (Located on the left beneath the \"Collections\" section).\n\n\nWhat are the differences between these three? How can each one of them be accessed? What settings are related to them (e.g. to show/hide them)? Will they all sync with iCloud? \nNote: the first two are easier to understand than the third, but for completeness, it would be helpful to include info about them as well.\n\nA: Think of it as a hierarchy.\nAt the top 'level', you have your full collection of bookmarks. This is what's accessed with the book icon and is where you can store, for example, rarely used bookmarks. \nWithin this larger collection there is a folder called 'Bookmarks Menu.' You can quickly access anything in this folder using the, well, Bookmarks menu in the menu bar at the top of your screen. I use this for frequent, but not constantly accessed pages. Its the closest analog to how most other browsers handle bookmarks. \nAnd within that, is Bookmarks Bar. Items in this folder are shown as a bar beneath the address bar for easy one-click access. I keep my most frequently used bookmarks here, as well as things like frequently used bookmarklets. \n", "Q: An iTunes Applescript that appends to tag only when it doesn't match part of the tag string? I'm trying to find a way to add a keyword or group of words/tags/strings to a set of selected iTunes tracks if they haven't been added. A use-case would be to add extra metadata in a comment such as (live) or (remix).\nIf some tracks previously contained (live) while appending, then it would not append it- only the non-matched files. So a comment tag containing (remix)(fast)(accordion)(random) would become (remix)(fast)(accordion)(random)(live) afterwards. However, if reapplied, it would skip this track.\nThe closest thing I can find is Smart Append, but its for Windows only (being JavaScript). \nThe well known Doug has an append to tag script, but it doesn't have any detection capabilities. I peeked into the code (by right click > Show Package Contents) and can't seem to wrap my head around editing the script.\nAnyone know of an existing script or a way to modify the existing script?\n\nA: This script works if the keyword is between parentheses as in your example, otherwise partial match will be a problem.

From the Mini the iMac appears as a \"mac' icon in the finder window - but the Mini appears as a \"generic PC\" icon from the iMac. Anyone know why this is and how to fix it ?\nI'm starting to get a few weird sharing issues cropping up but thought I'd address this first.\nFWIW, I'm running Lion 10.7.4 on both machines and have an airport extreme base station.\n\nA: Sounds like you may have enabled file sharing with SMB (Server Message Block, default for Windows, which is why the icon looks like a \"generic PC\") rather than AFP (Apple Filing Protocol) for the Mac mini. Check to make sure by going to System Preferences > Sharing. Choose File Sharing in the list on the left and click the Options button on the right. \nSMB is useful for sharing files with Windows/Linux-based computers, but if you only have Macs, stick with AFP. Things like permsissions, hidden files, etc. work much better if you use the native filesharing protocol.\n", "Q: Bluetooth controls from Notification Center on iPad I find myself spending a lot of time moving through the menus to re-connect my iPad to my iPhone to tether the network. \nIt would be great to be able to perform this task (or at least speed it up) from the notification center. \nNow that iOS 5.1.1 has been jailbroken I have SBSettings toggles working in the notification center on my iPad3 so I can toggle the bluetooth on and off from there, but I cannot get it to connect to my iPhone. \nEven something as basic as a shortcut-icon to open up Bluetooth Settings would work. Activator has an action that does this that I can assign but curiously there doesn't seem to be a way to add such an action as an icon in notification center. \n\nA: I just had a browse through the Cydia app and I found iTether w/OnDemand and it also has a SBSetting toggle to go with it.\nNow it is $5, so I am not goign to buy and try, but seeing your question it seems to solve what you want to achieve:-)\n", "Q: How to access the IR sensor of MacBook Pro Mid 2010 to be able to use non apple remotes I have an Audio to IR accessory for my iPhone which works very well with most of the TVs and DVD players as the app that comes with it supports them.\nI was wondering if it would be possible to write an iPhone App + Mac App that would let me control my MacBook Pro similar to how Apple remote works.\nIs the IR sensor on MacBooks accessible to third party applications ?\nAny Open Source Projects, SDK's or hacks you nice people can point me towards ?\n\nA: You may want to investigate candlair, or its big brother, Remote Buddy (google them). Candlair I believe only supports apple remotes, but remote buddy should let you configure other types of remotes with relative ease (they have a supported hardware list which is significantly larger than the stock IR port's driver). I've never used it though since my apple remote does everything i need. Good luck!\n\nA: You cannot access the IR signals directly (read impulses). Third party applications can only capture remote \"key presses\". You could attach third party IR receiver.\nWhy don't you take the better way - pair your apps via the local network and use it for communication. If you insist on using IR - you're limited to the 7 keys on the remote.\nps. I have an idea - research the security code sent by the remote control. If you could capture it on a software level, you could have access to many \"key codes\" on your mac app.\n\nA: Below is the original \"content of my post\":\nI use the Ignition app from LogMeIn on my iPhone/iPad via the network to fully control my Mac. \nIt works at home and I've also used it in an Iowa cornfield via a cellular data connection.\nI posted this in reply a few weeks ago in response to a different question regarding remote computer/screen control.\nI have no idea why it linked to this question. \n", "Q: iMac second monitor alternative I would like to have a dual screen setup with my 21\" iMac, but I'd like to avoid the expensive 27\" official monitor from Apple.\nIs there a specific 21\" screen that would fit well in size, resolution, disposition and colors with the iMac screen?\n\nA: My experience is that if you are doing pro level design where color matching is critical you won't be happy with a LCD panel that isn't of equivalent quality and also covered with glass. Look for a IPS LCD panel that has similar wide viewing angles since you won't want to move your head 15 inches sideways to get the same angle when comparing a critical design.\nThat being said, for casual use the iMac will drive pretty much any old or inexpensive you care to place next to the iMac. Many developers are happy to have a second window for email, chat, tailing server logs, twitter, messaging and don't really care if the second display actually matches the iMac since different content is being displayed on each display.\nSorry to offer a mushy - wiggly answer, but after seeing many years of people that were happy with even an old CRT next to a new iMac and others that go batty with even a really nice perfect LCD match (say by doing the work and finding that Dell sources the same IPS display as Apple for a near perfect match of hardware) and still being irritated that the appearance is different due to a piece of glass used on the iMac.\nIt comes down to your personal preference. Trust your gut - if you will look at an inexpensive monitor and get to work, glad you have more screen space - save as much money as you can stand. Even if you think you will notice the difference. Imagine a pile of 20 dollar bills (or in your case a pile of Euro notes) sitting there on your desk six months later down the road. Money you don't spend is still yours to spend later.\n\nA: I am a programmer and I have tried many monitors out there and nothing even comes close to the quality of apple cinema displays. I know that they are more expensive but you can get a 20\" apple cinema display on ebay for around $150. Definitely recommend apple displays.\n", "Q: Can I prevent websites from disabling zoom? I've noticed that more and more websites are disabling the ability to zoom on an ipad using Safari (or other mobile browsers, it seems).\nIs there a setting to turn this ability off, or some other way to prevent this?\n\nA: I created a bookmark in Mobile Safari with this url\njavascript:document.querySelector('meta%5Bname=viewport%5D').setAttribute('content','width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=10.0,user-scalable=1');\n\nThe easiest way to setup this bookmark is by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add a bookmark to any page\n\n*Edit the bookmark and set the url to the url I have above\n\n\nNow anytime you are on page that you can't zoom then click the bookmark icon and select the bookmark you setup.  Then you can pinch and zoom.\n\nA: There is not a way to prevent this using Mobile Safari. However, many alternative browsers will let you change the user agent sent to the server, which means you can make it look like you're connecting with a desktop browser instead of a mobile browser. While this will work, I understand it may not be exactly what you're looking for - unfortunately, you can't change the default browser without jailbreaking.\n\nA: There is not a way to stop a website from disabling zoom in mobile Safari. The zoom is disabled in the HTML code like this:\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no\" />\n\nTo disable this, you would have to have an HTML stripper that removed this HTML from the webpage. You might be able to use a Cydia app, but I haven't found anything that does this.\nYour best bet is probably to use an iOS browser that allows you to change the user agent. Most websites insert the HTML above when they detect that your browser is a mobile browser. Some free web browsers include:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mercury Web Browser (Free)\n\n*Terra (Free)\n\n*LastPass (Free)\n\n*Sleipnir Mobile (Free)\n\n\nA more complete list can be found here.\n\nA: Scott Walter's bookmarklet answer above is an excellent solution. \nA different, and more permanent, workaround is to enable Zoom in Settings > General > Accessibility.

When I google \"air print\" (based off of what the iPhone says) I see HP Wireless Printers.\nThat leads me to the question can I use the iPhone to print on any printer with wireless capabilities or does it have to be one of these HP Printers with \"ePrint\"? \n\nA: Does it have to be one of those HP printers?  No.  It can be a Brother, or an Epson, or others.\nFirst, did you read the page at Apple, regarding printing from your iPhone?\nSecond, after reading that page, at the bottom, did you follow the link to AirPrint-Enabled printers that was provided?\n\nPrinters not listed in this article are not supported by AirPrint.\nNote: Some printers listed in this article will require a firmware update out of the box to become AirPrint-enabed.

I had to create a \"service description\" for avahi and was printing to the printer via the GuruPlug's wifi using CUPS.  The printer wasn't fully supported by CUPS and while AirPrint would gladly send a page to the printer, the printer would not print it correctly.  Not sure who to blame in all that mess ( the GuruPlug only having 512MB of RAM didn't help things I'm sure...)\nThe ESP7's software on Windows installed Bonjour on each computer I installed the drivers on.\nSo I hope that is helpful in some way.  I think it is possible, at the very least by configuring Bonjour on the system that the printer is attached to correctly.  \n\nA: You can use any printer that works with a Mac if you have a free app called AirPrint Activator. It requires that the Mac be on in order to print from iOS, but that's the only restriction. If you can print from a Mac, you can print to the same printer from iOS.\nI currently have an Epson Stylus Photo R280 connected to my Time Capsule, and I can print to it from my iPhone as long as my Mac is on to facilitate the connection.\nhttp://netputing.com/airprintactivator/airprint-activator-v2-0/\n\nA: Don't have a printer supports AirPrint? Not necessary at all.\nUse AirPrint Activator to share local and network attached printers with iDevices.\n", "Q: Can anyone interpret verbose shutdown messages? I almost always boot up in Verbose mode so I can see what's happening during boot up/shut down. Usually critical errors make themselves obvious, some lesser errors aren't so obvious but can be cleared up, and yet other errors aren't really errors at all and should be expected. I've fixed a bunch of things on startup, and now I'm trying to figure out messages I see on shutdown.\nI'm basically just wondering if anyone can be an interpreter and tell me if any of this is bad or should not be happening, or if it all just looks normal.\nSorry for posting these messages as a photo. I'm not sure where to find a text log, if there is one:\n\nIt looks like there are a lot of processes that are staying alive until the system finally gives up on them and kills them all. If this is to be expected, that would be helpful to know. If not, how can I make the shut down run more smoothly?\nOh, and can anyone explain the anonymous.sudo processes? Is that okay? Where might that come from?\nThanks for any illumination you can offer!\n\nA: It depends on each executable.\nThe closedown process sends a signal SIGTERM to each process and the process should then cleanup and shut itself down. This includes subprocesses and that appears to be most of the lines in your log - perhaps the parent does not shut its subprocesses down when it does, also see Unix zombie processes in wikipaedia\nI would suggest that the original parent has not behaved 'properly' but probably does not matter unless there become many more zombie processes when the OS could run out of process handles.\n\nA: Interpreting error messages is not far removed from reading tea leaves. Having said that, I would start by uninstalling (or at least updating) your copy of TaoEffect Espionage. It looks like it installs a driver of some sort which is failing to quit.\n", "Q: iPad app to access Mac files? Is there an iPad app that that can open Mac files over WiFi on the iPad?\nI'm looking for something like Dropbox, I really like the feature it has where you can open the files in Dropbox in other apps on the iPad. I need something like that, just for regular files that are not on Dropbox. Something like Air Video but sends the files to the appropriate application instead of just playing videos in the app.\nTo be clear, I'm not looking for Splashtop or a similar VNC app. I want to use native iPad apps to open these files.\nI'm open to a jailbreak solution, too.\n\nA: Answering this \n\nIs there an iPad app that that can open Mac files over WiFi on the\n  iPad?\n\nI bought a app called Files Connect on my iPad, I use it to access files over the Network to access shared folders on my Mac using my iPad and iPhone.

The hard work will be setting your Mac up to give GoodReader access to the files you want. If you're looking for soemthing that will work while you're on your home network, you'll want to set it up as an AFP server. This might help. If you want to be able to access your files from anywhere in the world, you'll probably want to set up an FTP server.

To add an custom mail-signature in Lion you had to add an signature via preferences, and then replace the contents of the webarchive with your own.\nIn Mountain Lion, Apple replaced the webarchive format for signatures with an new format: .mailsignature. When I open such an file, I just see HTML (!). But when I change it, it doesn't take effect.. \nDoes someone have an solution to perform this?\n\nA: Quit Mail, edit the .mailsignature file with a text editor changing the HTML to whatever you like then right click the file in Finder and select \"Get Info\" then tick the \"Locked\" checkbox.  This prevents Mail from resetting the file to the original version and it uses your version.\n\nA: • open Mail\n• create a new signature\n• open this folder /Users/you/Library/Mail/V2/MailData/Signatures/ \n• open the latest *.mailsignature file with a text editor\n• replace everything under this code with your custom html (replace iso-8859-1 with utf-8 for umlaut support)\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\nContent-Type: text/html;\n    charset=iso-8859-1\nMessage-Id: <DDFB0C4D-5555-475C-9B54-115039EF5FE0@Speedport_W_722V_Typ_B>\nMime-Version: 1.0 (Mac OS X Mail 6.0 \\(1486\\))\n\n• save the file and open the Get Info Dialogue and check Locked, so that it doesn't get overwritten by Mail\n\nA: I wrote a Ruby script to batch convert .webarchive to .mailsignature files:\nhttps://github.com/paulschreiber/misc/blob/master/ruby/webarchive2mailsignature.rb\n", "Q: Why does the Mobile Safari Browser on iOS not allow file uploads? As already known, it's not possible for iOS users to select image files to upload from Safari on iPhone, because the browse button to display the \"select file\"- dialog is disabled. It works fine on Android, but not on iPhone... \nWhat is the particular reason for that issue? \nI heard that the browse button is disabled because there isn't a file browser on the iPhone. Someone other said that Safari just disabled root access. Is there any reliable source which explains the issue? (I need it for my thesis.)\n\nA: iOS apps can only read data in their own directory and thus only Safari would be able to use these files - so how could you create them and put them in Safari's directories?\nFrom Apple's Filesystem basics development documentation\n\nAn iOS app’s interactions with the file system are limited mostly to\n  the directories inside the app’s sandbox. During installation of a new\n  app, the installer code creates a home directory for the app, places\n  the app in that directory, and creates several other key directories.\n  These directories constitute the app’s primary view of the file\n  system. Figure 1-1 shows a representation of the sandbox for an app.\nFigure 1-1  Each iOS app operates within its own sandbox\nBecause it is in a sandbox, an app is generally prohibited from\n  accessing or creating files in directories outside of its home\n  directory. One exception to this rule occurs when an app uses public\n  system interfaces to access things such as the user’s contacts or\n  music. In those cases, the system frameworks handle any file-related\n  operations needed to read from or modify the appropriate data store\n\n\nA: iOS 6 fixed this problem by granting one exception to the sand boxing of apps from each-other's data. Upload buttons may now ask about taking/browsing for a picture or video clip to upload. \nOther than by exception, there still is no full filesystem access on iOS 6 and lower. \n\nA: From all of my research I cannot find a descriptive answers as to why this feature has been disabled in mobile safari. I don't know if you are interested but if you have your iOS device jailbroken there is a tweak called \"Safari Upload Enabler\" which gives mobile safari the ability to upload files. You can buy it on cydia for $1.99\n", "Q: How to get Lion a working auto_home client with NIS and NFS Server I have a working NIS/NFS server environment here, with multiple servers. One is the NIS server, that works just fine with Lion. But I can't figure out how to get the auto home mounting working.\nDo you guys have any hints, make this working?\n\nA: You'll need an automount record for your Directory, and you'll need home folder location records for your users or groups. I think you'll need to modify your LDAP schema so that these two types of entries are named the way a Mac expects. Not my area of expertise unfortunately.\n", "Q: Install Clang 3.1 What would be the best place to manually install llvm/clang binaries in OS X 10.7 without conflicting with existing/future versions shipped with xcode?\nThanks!\n\nA: The usual place to install your own compiled libraries etc and make them available for all users is /usr/local (Except if you use Homebrew package manager which uses this directory)\nApple can overwrite any directory that is in /System or /Library or /Applications so don't use these, but you can use anything else.\nsee Apple development document on FileSystem basics for more detail.\n", "Q: Best way to clear up space and dump to computer when getting iCloud storage backup prompt? When i sync my iphone, I am getting an error message saying it can't do a backup because i have more than 5GB of space used.\nI went to:\nSettings --> iCloud -->  Storage and backup --> Manage Storage.\nI see it says Next backup size 5.0 GB and 4.6 GB of that is coming from Camera roll. So i have a few questions on how to clean this up:\n\n\n*\n\n*When looking at my photos, I see:\n\n*\n\n*Camera Roll (500 pictures)\n\n*Photo Stream (655 pictures)\n\n\n\nSince it says, Camera roll on the iCloud storage page, I am assuming if I just delete some pictures and videos from this, it will free up space.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Is this correct?\n\n*Does iCloud simply backup latest state of camera roll at sync time and if i have previously backed up pictures and i deleted them on camera roll, it will be deleted from iCloud backup?\n\n\nMy second question is around getting all of these pictures down to my computer (I have a Windows XP computer).  I am currently NOT syncing pictures in itunes as I find it was making the sync time go from around 45 seconds to over 10 minutes.  After a bunch of research the advise everyone gave was to not sync pictures via iTunes.    Is there any easy way to download these all to my Win XP computer so I can free up space on my iPhone ?\n\nA: First question: yes, iCloud backs up your photo as it is. If you delete media from your photos library it will be deleted from iCloud. (I might add that videos are also stored in the cloud - and consequently take up the most room).\nSecond question: It is possible you can use the Scanner and Camera wizard to import photos from your iPhone. Here is are two articles that briefly describe the process.\n\n\n*\n\n*Tech Recipes\n\n*OSX Daily\nBefore you delete all (or most of) your photos off your iPhone, I would recommend that you double check that everything has been transfered correctly so you don't lose any pictures. \nYou probably already know this but it's worth mentioning anyways. When you go to delete photos from your iPhone, open the Photos app, click the Camera Roll album, then select the box with the arrow icon at the top right of the screen. Select pictures to be deleted, then tap the Delete button in the bottom bar (this is also a way to email more then one picture).\nOf course, the other option would be to turn off the iCloud backup of your photos. (You already know how to get there but go to iCloud > Storage & Backup > Manage Storage > [your name] iPhone > Turn Camera Off.)\n", "Q: Connect two 30\" ACD on a 17\" MacBook Pro (early 2011) My setup is a 30\" Cinema Display (2560x1600, DVI) from around 2007, and a 17-inch, Early 2011 Macbook Pro. I'm wondering if I can add a second external monitor via a USB adaptor or any other solution. Ideally another monitor of the same size and resolution.\n\nA: Yes, you can add another monitor if you use a USB video adaptor.  No, there are no USB video adaptors that support dual link DVI monitors such as the 30\" Cinema Display.\nMany USB video adaptors will support 1920x1200, some a little bit higher.\nHowever, you will find the USB video to be slow and annoying if you are used to high performance video.\nI suggest you consider using two Apple Thunderbolt displays which are a bit smaller and a bit lower resolution at 2560-by-1440, but you can connect two of them, and you'll actually find as good as your cinema display is, technology has improved noticeably since its release, and the thunderbolt displays are absolutely stunning.\nYou might be able to connect one thunderbolt display, then attach the thunderbolt-DVI adaptor to that display and attach your cinema display.\nTo that end, you might find some of the information in this question useful:\nHow to connect two non-Thunderbolt displays to the Macbook Pro 2011 via Thunderbolt?\n\nA: If you take a look at the Apple support pages, there is stated:\n\nDual display and video mirroring: Simultaneously supports full native\n  resolution on the built-in display and up to 2560 by 1600 pixels on an\n  external display, both at millions of colors\n\nSo I don't think you'll be able to hook up two 30\" screens (2560x1600) to your MacBook Pro.\nBut if you set your resolutions to something smaller, you can buy some 3th party hardware to support dual screen modus...\nHere is an overview of the available resolutions and the product you can buy (Matrox). \n\nA: I found a couple of ways that you might be able to connect multiple displays to your macbook pro. USB 2.0 to DVI Display Adapter, & Air Display. I don't know if either of these things will work but let me know!\n", "Q: Using Apple Xserve Xeon Nehalem 2.26 \"Quad Core\" as a regular computer? I don't know much about servers so I figured that this would be the best place to find out more about them. I have a friend who has 3 Apple Xserves with Xeon Nehalem 2.26 quad core processors. So my question is can this Xserve be configured to work just like a normal apple computer? My friend tells me that it can be set up just like any other computer. If this is possible is there some documentation out there that would explain how to do this?\n\nA: Yes just attach a keyboard and display see Apple's Xserver user guide and it is a normal Apple computer. OS X server includes all of normal OS X.\nHowever, it will need to be in a rack and I suspect is noisy and now not that powerful compared with current desktops (and possibly even laptops)\n\nA: Yes, it is essentially just a Mac, like any other (well, except for that it has LOM and dual power supplies). I'm not sure Apple officially supports it, but it should run just fine.\nThe only complication is that Lion (if that is the OS you intend to install) will not want to allow the install of the Client OS on a disk which already has the Server OS installed. If it stops you from purchasing/downloading, you can delete the following file:\n/System/Library/CoreServices/ServerVersion.plist\nRemoving this file will stop the OS from identifying itself as the Server OS, and will allow you to proceed with purchasing/installing Lion (Client) without also having to purchase Lion Server.\n\nA: Years ago I ran a G5 Xserve as a desktop for about a week. The noise was awful. IMO, you're better off selling it and buying a mini.\n", "Q: How do I click a button using AppleScript?

I would have an Apple TV connected to an LCD projector. \nMy question is whether I would be able to wirelessly stream a movie from my iPad with this setup, such that audio goes to the Libratone and video goes to the Apple TV...\nI couldn't find any information on this kind of setup.\n\nA: It just isn't feasible at this time. Video and audio need to stay perfectly in sync for your brain to not notice, and splitting up the streams of data to two different destinations creates a time lag that, at this time, is impossible to sync up.  The reason why it works at all going to one device is that the destination spools up both streams and starts them both at the same time.\n", "Q: prevent second hard-drive from spinning up after standby I have a MacBook Pro with two harddrives, an SSD in the main slot and a larger, normal drive in place of the superdrive.\nBecause of power consumption and noise I managed to get my Mac to not automatically start and mount the second harddrive when booting up, but it still spins up the drive when waking up from hibernation / standby / sleep (don't know the correct terminology here). \nIs there a way to prevent this? I have a script that ejects the disk, causing it to spin down. I guess I am looking for a postWakeup-hook of some sort to run it when the laptop wakes up.\nAny advice would be appreciated.\n\nA: Running your script on wake up, with Power Manager, or using SleepWatcher, for instance, should do the trick.\nThere are, actually, different sleep modes, and knowing exactly which one you are using may help too, as Sleeping your Mac should not use the Hard Drive, the second disk should stay idle. Here is a brief explanation of what happens with each sleeping mode.\n", "Q: iPhone external speak with Bluetooth and AirPlay? Most of the external speakers I've seen have either AirPlay [B&W Zeppelin] or Bluetooth [Bose Soundlink, Jawbone Big Jambox] but not both.  Anyone know of an external speaker system that has both?\n\nA: Samsung has announced some products that support both.\nHave a look at the high-end Samsung Audio Dock DA-E750, and the (only) a bit cheaper DA-E670.\nI have never listened to the Samsung speakers, but I do find them a bit expensive compared to the already 'premium' price of the B&W Zeppelin Air for example, which still has a better reputation regarding audio quality, although preliminary reviews speak well about the quality of the Samsung speakers.\nAlso AirPlay is technically the superior technology, as it has a much larger bandwidth than Bluetooth, and transmits the audio uncompressed to the speaker. Unless you have specific reasons for needing Bluetooth, perhaps traveling with your speakers or streaming from non-Apple devices, I'd prefer an AirPlay speaker.\n", "Q: Controlling which address my outgoing mail is seen to be from I have access to the company's general email as well as my own. Both are Gmail accounts. Seemingly randomly, even when I send from my own account, the other party's reply is to the general email account which everyone sees. How can I prevent this on my Mac Mini running Lion?\n\nA: There is a preference you can set so that composing a new message defaults to a specific mailbox rather than the currently selected mailbox. \n\nReplies go from the account to which the message was addressed. I'm not sure how it breaks a tie if both of your addresses are included or copied, but you can always override the \"from\" account by clicking on your name / email under the subject field.\nIn the message composition window, there's a pulldown above the message body, on the right, to select which email address you're sending from. The default for this depends on which mailbox you have selected in the main Messages window. It sounds like you're doing this.\nIf you're sure the above is being done for sure, then it's possible some gmail filters or tagging is getting in the way and making it look as though the reply lands in the inbox for one when really it's in another.\nI would check the webmail and see if the issue is also seen there. If it is, then you're likely not sending from the right account, even if you think you are.\n", "Q: Set MacBook Pro on energy saving mode I have a 2008 MacBook Pro (last one before the unibody ones) and have been monitoring a the laptop temperatures for almost a day. I used Temperature Monitor to graph the changes in temp and correlate them to my typical usage.  \nAside from obvious considerations (GPU getting HOT while playing 3D stuff), I noticed that when I unplugged the laptop from the AC adapter the temp dropped down by 15-30 °C.  \nI think this may be related to some energy-saving mode of the CPU/GPU but I didn't find any setting or hack that allow me to turn it on on purpose. Is there a way to do so?  \nPS: One may ask, why do you care about temperatures: well, first of all it's summer and this laptop is damn hot. On the other hand, I'd much prefer my laptop to use only as much resources it needs for common tasks and then turning it on when I need more computing power.\n\nA: The temperature drop when unplugging the power can be attributed to Intel's SpeedStep technology, which will conserve energy while working on battery by dynamically decreasing/increasing the clock speed.\nThere is no way to control this from Mac OS X itself, but for your processor you could use the 3rd party software CoolBook. I have no experience with this software though, and I'd be cautious, there really is no good reason to go fiddling with these settings manuals.\n", "Q: Xcode installation seems corrupt? I've been try to download Xcode for work, but for some reason the Mac App Store is giving me a bit of trouble. Activity monitor shows some network usage, but in Launchpad it seems the download isn't moving. \nWhen I go to the purchases panel of the Mac App Store, I see this. \n\nNo status, no pause button, in fact - the button has no text on it! I've tried restarting the App Store, restarting my computer, even removing the com.apple.appstore folder in /var/folders but alas, no luck.\nCan anyone diagnose the issue? When I removed com.apple.appstore, Xcode still showed up on Launchpad, and clicking on it did nothing - it was frozen in time. So can I kill off this partial download and start new?\n\nA: As near as I can tell, this might be a Hidden Purchase. Choose Store > View My Account, where you can see hidden purchases. You may be able to cancel or unhide the download from there.\n\nA: I always start by searching for \"troubleshoot\" in the help menu for the App. You will get this link:\nhttp://www.apple.com/support/mac/app-store/troubleshooting/\nThere are several things that could be going on, but I would follow this link - that has well sequenced steps to try for a quick fix. If those don’t work, the Apple support link at the bottom is where I would ask the vendor to look at the server side or walk me through cleaning folders by hand in terminal if needed I accomplished all the steps in their document to resolve this. \n\n\n*\n\n*Mac App Store: How to resume interrupted downloads\n\nA: sudo find /var/folders/ -ipath '*com.apple.appstore*' -print \nshould show you App Store related cache files.\nsudo find /var/folders/ -ipath '*com.apple.appstore*' -print | xargs sudo fgrep -i xcode \nshould show you any of those files which are related to XCode.\nYou could run\nsudo find /var/folders/ -ipath '*com.apple.appstore*' -delete\nwhich will DELETE all of the files that it finds (not just the xcode ones!) but that shouldn't be a big deal. I would expect the App Store.app would re-create any files it needs if they are not found in /var/folders/.\nI ran it it did not seem to cause any problems. As always, make sure you have a complete bootable backup before running any Terminal code suggested by some stranger on the Internet :-)\n", "Q: Is it possible to cluster multiple Xservers in to one logical machine? I have (3) 2009 2.26 Xserves and I am wondering if it is possible to tie them together so it acts as one computer?\n\nA: Yes and no.\nIt's certainly possible to create clusters out of disparate machines and use them in some co-ordinated fashion. But it's the realm of specialty software and specialty application programming.\nBeowulf can take separate machines and have them act as one, large SMP machine with shared memory and all but programs need to be Beowulf compatible for this to work. There are lots of specifics to making Beowulf work well: you should use nearly identical machines and your machine interconnect fabric has to be really high speed and low latency (read: better than gigabit ethernet...like InfiniBand)\nXgrid (tutorials), an Apple-designed, job scheduling framework based on the BEEP framework is available for use and sits somewhere between Beowulf above and Condor/GE below. It's a process distribution framework along with a message passing interface for distributed process co-ordination. You have to run an XGrid head node and XGrid slaves in your pool and your code needs to be XGrid-aware and complied against the XGrid libraries for it to take advantage of an XGrid. From that article linked to above:\n\nUnfortunately, Xgrid is not yet the silver bullet that can magically take an existing program such as iMovie, cut it in slices and run in on all the macs it can find in the neighborhood.\n\nThe above statement is true for every technology I'm talking about in this answer I'm afraid.\nCondor (and Oracle Grid Engine) can provide somewhat easy access to pools of machines for batch-based workloads -- you queue up jobs and these programs will take care of scheduling their execution on machines that you have joined to the pool as execution nodes -- but they don't share CPU power across machines (at least not without MPI interfaces in the software using them) and they don't share memory. The interconnect requirements aren't nearly as heavy as in Beowulf clustering and you can get away with heterogenous pools of machines as the schedulers will handle matchmaking based on job requirements.\nThere are some off-the-shelf Mac apps that will let you do clustering in an application-specific way. For example: Logic Pro 8 and Logic 9 let you run \"Logic Nodes\" in your network and you can offload audio processing to these nodes. How much and what specifically you can offload is very dependent on your network and your machines but it does work. There are options in the Logic installer to create a 'Logic Node' when you install the software and run Logic in slave mode on the instance so it can be found by a master Logic session running on another machine.\nThis sort of one-off speciality parallelization is pretty unique in consumer and pro-sumer level applications and far from the norm though.\nIt's worth noting that Apple used to sell something called the Xserve Cluster Node. The name is somewhat misleading here. It was a hardware configuration for the Xserve, without a graphics card or an optical drive, intended to be used in cluster deployments. But the configuration didn't include any additional clustering capabilities. You still needed something like above mentioned software to create a cluster for your workloads.\n", "Q: iTunes permissions on second drive I upgraded my mac to use an SSD for System and Applications and moved Users to a second HDD. iTunes will not allow me to authorize. \nHere are my paths:\n/Mac/... (System, etc)\n\n/Volumes/Pig/Users/\n  /Volumes/Pig/Users/arrow\n  /Volumes/Pig/Users/Shared\n  /Volumes/Pig/Users/wildcat\n\nCurrently permissions on Pig are 755 system:wheel on /Pig, /Pig/Users, and /Pig/Users/Shared.\nError on starting iTunes: \nYou do not have enough access privileges for this operation\n\nError on authorization attempt:\nThere was an error storing your authorization information on this computer.\n\nThe required directory was not found or has a permissions error. Correct this permissions problem and try again, or deauthorize this computer if the permissions cannot be changed.\n\nThis computer was previously authorized. I've deauthorized everything in my account so now we're starting zero. I've also followed the Apple Support Article regarding this issue. http://support.apple.com/kb/TS1277?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US\nI understand the gist of what's going on here, I'm just not sure how permissions need to be set up on the second HDD to accommodate iTunes. \nThanks~~\n\nA: Here's the deal w/ iTunes in regards to moving your Users directory to a separate drive or partition; it turns out that the Shared directory must remain on the system drive. For example, in my context the path should be /Mac/Users/Shared where 'Mac' is my system drive. The other users stay in /Volumes/Pig/Users/..., i.e., arrow and wildcat.\nI believe the permissions I listed above are incorrect and they've since been changed to:\n/Volumes/Pig - 644 system:admin\n/Volumes/Pig/Users - 644 system:admin\n/Mac/Users/Shared - 777 arrow:admin\nCorrecting the permissions to their current settings didn't solve the problem on it's own, moving Shared to the same drive as the iTunes binary did. \n", "Q: How can I change the cellular DNS server on iOS? Is there a way to set a global DNS server that will be used for all connections (both Wi-Fi + cellular data)? If there isn't a uniform manner to specify DNS, can I just change the DNS used by the cellular connection?\nIdeally, I am looking for an answer for vanilla iOS; however, I'd welcome any solution, including one that requires a jailbreak.\n\nA: I'll cover the no-jailbreak scenario and leave editing or another answer for someone that knows how to change this by modifying iOS.\nWithout a jailbreak, no. The cellular data is governed by APN settings. You can change these with the iPhone configuration utility and some learning.\n\nThe Wi-Fi settings are easy to override using the device itself, but it's not global but instead an override on a per-network name basis. Go to the network settings for a specific Wi-Fi. Under the detailed screen (tap the blue > sign once you are connected) and swipe up to expose the DHCP / BootP / Static IP address part of the screen. You can tap to edit DNS and append, delete or substitute your choice of DNS settings from that screen.\nWhen I need to run a custom DNS, I often use VPN to get to a router with known settings and this works over Wi-Fi and cellular data since all traffic goes to the VPN where I can control the DNS. This requires time and a server (Amazon web service free tier is ideal for low cost hosting).\n\nA: Yes, there is way. And since you're already jailbroken, it'll be so much easier. Just open up Cydia and search for GuizmoDNS. It's from the ModMyi repository, which comes preconfigured with Cydia. It allows you to select the DNS server to go through when using a cellular data network, and it does it right from the Settings app.\n\nA: You can use this app: https://www.dnsoverride.com/\nIt can override DNS settings for any Wi-Fi and cellular connection. One scenario in which it's not going to work is if your ISP intercepts DNS traffic. Some mobile operators do.\n", "Q: How to combine two images into one on a Mac? Say I have two photos (or any images), for example with the following dimensions: \n+----------+       +----------+\n|          |       |          |\n|          |       |          |\n|320 x 428 |  and  |320 x 428 | \n|          |       |          |\n|          |       |          |\n+----------+       +----------+\n\nI want to combine them into a single image, side by side. So the result should be\n+----------------------+\n|                      |\n|                      |\n|      640 x 428       |\n|                      |\n|                      |\n+----------------------+         \n\nWhat's the simplest way to do this on a Mac? Is it possible with some default app like Preview, or would you recommend some 3rd party tool for the job?\nSolution ✅\nIf I could, I'd accept these two answers:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you want a GUI solution, use Preview\n\n*For a smooth command-line solution, use convert from ImageMagick\n\nA: I was looking at this old post to do the same and I came with a simple method. \n\n\n*\n\n*Get Inkscape - cross-platform, freeware, open-source.\n\n*Open it, push File, modify document properties to the desired finished resolution.\n\n*Import desired pictures into the document and move around, stretch, bend, etc.\n\n*Export to chosen file type. \n\n*Use all your free time to something else!\n\n\nA: The simplest way I know uses Preview. Open both photos with Preview, position their windows side-by-side (flush) in front of your desktop and then use Preview's \"Take a screen shot\" command with the \"from Selection\" option. Select around the perimeter of both photos together and it will create a montage for you.\n\nA: How to do this with the tools to hand: Preview .app and Screen Capture.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open up any Application that lets you have a clean neat white\nbackground. Not strictly necessary but makes life easier.\n\n*Make a screensnap: command shift 4 > drag out an area 640 x428\npixel (the cursor shows the dimensions). \n\n\n*This will be saved as a .png to your Desktop *. Double click on this along with your two existing images to open them in Preview .app\n\n*Select each of your two images in turn and go command a (Select All) and command c (Copy)\n\n\n*Switch to your blank background image, command v (Paste) each in turn dragging them into position next to each other. \n\n\nYou can scale them by dragging their handles, and nudge them a pixel at a time with your cursor keys. \nThey will stay mobile until you Save.\n\n*When you are happy with the arrangement: \nMenu > File > Save As… > New name > Whatever file format you want\n/* Keep this as a Template size, with any others, clearly labelled with their dimensions for future use.\n\nA: I often have to do this with images of plots of data.  I use the command line tools that come in the Imagemagick package; I think I installed it on my system with MacPorts. You could also choose to install with brew (brew install imagemagick).\nThe actual tool you want to use from Imagemagick is the convert tool.  If you have your two 320x428 images, say a.png and b.png, you can do\nconvert +append a.png b.png c.png\n\nto create a new file, c.png, that has the a.png on the left and b.png on the right.  Alternatively, you append them vertically with -append (instead of +) and a.png will be on top of b.png.  With convert, you can do a ton of other things.  For example, you can switch to a different image format for the output\nconvert +append a.png b.jpg c.tif\n\nThis isn't a GUI application, but maybe some others might have a better solution.  Alternatively, you could put this in some sort of automator script.\n2020-12-10：\nI used it on 2020-12-10 and now the correct code is\nconvert +append a.png b.jpg +append c.tif\n\n\nA: Do it online for free...\nhttp://www.quickpicturetools.com\nBeats messing around or installing other programs.\n\nA: Open both images side by side in Preview, take a screenshot with command-shift-4.\n\nA: Here's one way I just managed to solve this with.\nDisclaimer: If you are not familiar with the Unix command line, you may want to pick one of the GUI-oriented solutions that others have posted.\nInstall the ImageMagick graphics suite, e.g. with Homebrew:\nbrew install ImageMagick\nAlternatively, use MacPorts ( sudo port install ImageMagick) or the Mac OS X binary release provided by ImageMagick. In my experience, Homebrew is the quickest, most hassle-free option.\nOnce you have ImageMagick installed, it's simple. Using Terminal, navigate to the directory containing the images, and create a combined version with a command such as:\nmontage -geometry 100% left.jpg right.jpg merged.jpg\n\nThere's multitude of options available; to learn about them, see:\nhttp://www.imagemagick.org/script/montage.php\n\nA: This solution uses only Preview and may be handy if you can't install software on a machine. It is, however, not elegant.\nSay your images are called A and B. Then:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open A in Preview.\n\n*Select All, Copy.\n\n*In the Tools menu, select Size and adjust the width to the sum of the width of the two images (in your example, 640 px). Keep the height. This will result in a stretched version of A.\n\n*Paste the copy of the original A and move it manually to the left.\n\n*In another window, open B.\n\n*Select All, Copy.\n\n*Paste into A, moving it to the right.\n\n*Save as a new image.\n\n\nSince, of course, Preview does not offer any proper image editing tools and no way to exactly position the two images, the ImageMagick solutions posted here are preferable.\n\nA: Pixelmator is only around $30 from the app store and its a full photoshop replacement for 99% of users. It will merge your images and do a thousand other things besides. Highly recommended.\n\nA: The easiest way is to use Graphic Converter. Open the Convert and Modify window, select all the images you want to stitch together on the left hand selection pane, and select a folder for the output in the right hand selection pane (otherwise you might overwrite your originals).\nOn the left hand side of the main window select Function -> Concat....\nClick GO (LHS at bottom), this will open a dialogue box that asks if you want them arranged in a row only, column only or a matrix of N x M images.\n\nA: Using TextEdit, you can copy paste (or drag) the 2 images in to TextEdit window side by Side.\nSave as PDF then Open- Save as JPEG after witch you can modify the image size in Preview.\n\n\nA: Speaking of free GUI tools, Seashore app is an open source project much better at working with images than Preview.app.\nIt has better tools much on the lines of popular editors (including shortcuts) and I guess if you try you should be doing just fine without much help from us.\nIt supports layers, filters, channels and supports almost all image formats, plus it has better image / layer selection and resizing tools that may be better suited for your image editing needs.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open both the images with Seashore.\n\n*Copy over the second one into the first one. Seashore will ask you if you want to create a New Layer or Anchor it with the one already there. (see screenshot).\n\n*Click on New Layer.\n\n*Use the Move tool (right most selected button in toolbar in the screenshot) to align your layer to the right of the previous one.\n\n*Choose Image boundaries option from Image menu (Third item from top Cmd + Opt + C) increase the image boundary to the Right in your case by the current width of the image (assuming both images are of same size).\n\n*Save as png or jpg according to your needs.\n\n\nVoila!\n\n\nA: I'm a know-nothing when it comes to computers, but this question is all over the internet.\nI make all kinds of pictures in Pages, then save the page as a pdf. I open the pdf in Preview and resave it as a jpg. Then I import the jpg in iphoto and do whatever I want to it there - crop it or play with the colors etc. Then I mail it to myself in whatever size I want. This is serious silliness by most people's standards.\nWell it works - and you don't have to be a geek to do it :)\n\nA: There is a free application available named Union in App Store that can do the job.\nDescription of Union from the above link:\n\n\n*\n\n*After installing and launching the app, activate it by clicking on its icon at top right, next to the clock;\n\n*Drag and drop images into it and press the \"preview button\" at the top left;\n\n*The native \"Preview\" app will display the final result -- which is now available for editing / saving / sharing.\n\n\n\nA: There is Graphic Converter (free to try).  So you could: open new picture 640 x 480; then in turn open each of the components, copy all, and paste into the new picture.  Drag them into place where you want them.  Then Save As... the format you want.\n\nA: Actually, there is a much simpler way to combine two photos into one page (one pdf) on a Mac. Open a new powerpoint file, open the photos you want to join or save into one PDF, use the Crop command (Shift+Control+Command+4) to crop the images one by one and paste them in the powerpoint file. Adjust the size of photos and placement on the slide. Save the slide or file as a PDF. Simple. \nHowever if you want to merge two photos into one (with one merging into the other) there are other apps out there which can do it for you.\n\nA: This is probably quite old, but for people who still encounter this stuff (I just had to merge 2 sides of my card which is the new \"car papers\".\nI tend to use pixlr.com, which does NOT require signup, it's simular to photoshop you can just upload your two images, crop, transform w/e move them on different layers etc. Then you can save it as a pixlr file or PNG / JPG\n", "Q: Are apps that use LSUIElement in their plist causing google account problems? I've noticed a pattern with some apps not logging into my Google account when they are hidden. After some digging, I think I have identified a common thread - the LSUIElement which is basically a flag telling Mac OS X to not show an \"agent\" app in the dock.\nMany things that I always keep open (RSS, Mail, etc) I will hide from the dock by using the LSUIElement key in the app's Info.plist. But, for some reason, I noticed this causes login problems. \nMy two problem apps in heavy use, Sparrow for email, Reeder for RSS work fine when not hidden. When I hide them, they fail to log in to my Google account.\n\n\n*\n\n*What might be causing this?\n\n*Can I prevent it?\n\n*If #2 is no, is there an alternative to LSUIElement? \n\n\nA: Modifying the Info.plist of an app usually invalidates its code signature, so it's not allowed to access the keychain automatically.\nYou can see if the code signature is valid with for example codesign -vv /Applications/Sparrow.app. An invalid signature can be replaced with sudo codesign -f -s - /Applications/Sparrow.app.\n", "Q: How can I open or export a abcddb file in Windows 7 Excel? I have a file in the abcddb format. This file was saved on a Mac. I am trying to open in Windows 7 in either Excel or Access. How can I do this?\n\nA: The file is actually an SQLite 3 datafile.\nThe closest match would be Access, but it will not open the file as such. You will have to install an ODBC connector, set up a connection and open each table. Not trivial, I am afraid, but doable.\nCheck http://www.ch-werner.de/sqliteodbc/ for an SQLite ODBC connector. Note: some antivirus show a heuristics alert for the executable, it is probably safe.\nCommand line:\nIf you have access to the sqlite3 command line tool (comes standard in OS X), you can list the tables (there are 24) with\necho .tables | sqlite3 file.abcddb\n\nand you can export each table to CSV with\nsqlite3 -csv -header file.abcddb \"SELECT * FROM TABLE;\" > TABLE.csv\n\nand open it with Excel or Access.\nOf course, you can \"play\" with SQL SELECTs. A CSV list of Name, Surname, Phone (with a line for each phone number, hence possibly more than a line for each person) can be got with:\nsqlite3 -csv -header file.abcddb \"SELECT ZABCDRECORD.ZFIRSTNAME AS 'First Name', ZABCDRECORD.ZLASTNAME AS 'Last Name', ZABCDPHONENUMBER.ZFULLNUMBER AS 'Phone' FROM ZABCDRECORD INNER JOIN ZABCDPHONENUMBER ON ZABCDPHONENUMBER.ZOWNER = ZABCDRECORD.Z_PK;\" > telephones.csv\n\nZABCDRECORD is the \"main\" table with a row for each contact. But data that cn be multiple for each contact (phone numbers as above, email addresses, physical address, URLs...) is in separate tables, each containing a ZOWNER column that \"points\" to column Z_PK (autonumeric) in ZABCDRECORD (technically, they have it as a foreign key).\nAlternative GUI software: you may download DB Browser for SQLite for OS X or Windows (PortableApps package available too for the later). Just open the file then use File->Export->Table(s) as CSV file.\n", "Q: I want to run an applescript whenever a certain person signs onto my Messages buddy list I want to run an applescript whenever a certain person signs onto my Messages buddy list\nExactly.

The next day, I always found my applications in the exact state where I had left them.\nNow, I have a new Mac Pro with Lion and every time I come back to work in the morning the system is locked down (i.e. I have to put my password), which is fine, and all applications are closed. They do however re-start and try to recover the state as I left them the day before. Alas, some applications crash (e.g. Mendeley, Quicksilver, Word), others don't succeed but let you recover the previous state (Chrome, Firefox), others simply dissappear (Emacs, scripts running).\nThe thing that worries me the most is that when I leave work, I usually leave some simulations running that can take more than 12h to finish. I have lost work when I come back in the morning.\nQuestion: what is going on here and how can I disable this \"sleep/hibernate/???\" behaviour.\nI have already tried to change System Settings - Energy Saver - Computer and Display sleep to Never.\nUpdate\nIt turns out that this had nothing to do with resume. My mac is randomly shutting down sometimes and it happens almost every night. Now it has happened to me while working a couple of times and now I realize why I had a login screen every morning: it was just that the machine was turned off and back on. This is why some apps crashed (they were shut down incorrectly) and some others dissappeared (Emacs, scripts and simulation do not restart when logging back in).\n\nA: I think this is the feature of logging out after inactivity that can be set in System Preferences. This is in the General tab of the Security pane with the option of \"Log out after ... minutes of inactivity\".\nAn Apple page describing this feature is available here.\nAdditionally, this issue is described in another Stack Exchange question that I saw recently.\nI'm only on my iPad so can't check this out at the moment but seems like it might be responsible. \n\nA: I suspect that Snow Leopard was hibernating while Lion is attempting to use it's Resume functionality, which has serious bugs.  In particular, there are various applications like Preview that reliably break on Resume.\nI'd imagine these Mac OS X centric applications you've listed all crash because they tell Lion they do resume, but their/Lion's resume simply doesn't work correctly.  I forget if Snow Leopard offered Resume at all, but it treated resume far more conservatively if so. \nYou should therefore experiment with disabling resume.  You could easily disable it system wide by unchecking Restore windows when opening and quitting apps in System Preference's General pane.  Lion should then be forced into doing a full hibernate like Snow Leopard.\n\nIf this works, you could experiment with disabling resume for individual applications.  You could prevent specific applications like Terminal, Preview, or you your simulation application from permitting resume using :\ndefaults write com.apple.Terminal NSQuitAlwaysKeepsWindows -bool false\ndefaults write com.apple.Preview NSQuitAlwaysKeepsWindows -bool false\n...\n\nThere is some chance that Lion simply cannot write the resume files wherever they belong.  You should therefore also repair permissions, make sure your drive has the 20% free that Lion requests, and plug in your time machine backup drive.  I've never encountered any problem fixed by repair permissions, but maybe this once.  There is a local time machine backup that Lion provides via that 20% free requirement.  If this were full, maybe the resume files could not be written.\nAs an aside, there is a separate resume function built into Safari, Chrome, and a few others that doesn't require Lion's resume functionality.  You'll should find their built in resume feature vastly more stable than Lion's efforts anyways. \n\nA: System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Advanced\nLog out aftex xx minutes of inactivity\nCan't post image :(\n\n", "Q: Is there any study on how which services/sensors consume the battery? I am looking for some study/comparison on how battery-consuming are specific services/sensors (3G, Wifi, GPS, Bluetooth, accelerometer) in the iOS devices.\nHas anyone stumbled across something like that?\n\nA: Unfortunately there is no simple answer to your question.  Battery life obviously depends on what is running and what your phone is doing when you are using it and when your not using it.\nHopefully this list will help you out:\n3G uses more battery life than Edge.  The lower your signal, the more your phone has to work, thus using more battery, in order to keep that signal.  If you have poor signal, phone calls/internet usage will drain slightly faster than on a good signal.\nWifi uses less battery than 3G, but still an ok amount.  Signal issues can cause more usage like in 3g cases.\nWifi and 3G are still used while your phone isn't being used to access Mail if you have Mail Fetching turned on.  A lot of times people who have bad battery life are always fetching their mail every 15 minutes, even if there is no mail to check, it still does this.  I recommend turing that off or switching to a Push Email Account like Gmail or Mobile Me.\nAlso, Exchange Emails can sometimes get corrupted on your phone and drain battery life like crazy by constantly syncing and checking for mail over and over again.  Removing and re-adding the Exchange email has shown to fix issues with Battery Life in certain cases.\nAlso, close apps that are not being used anymore in your Multitasking App Tray.  A lot of times having 40 to 50 apps in there can cause a bit more battery drain.  Now this doesn't mean clear it every time you use an App, just every once in a while.\nSame thing goes for restarting your iPhone/iDevice.  Every couple of weeks or so powering it off and then powering it on can clear up little things that could have been using slightly more battery life.\nBluetooth 2.1 Devices use a lot of battery.  Bluetooth 2.1, is one of the biggest killers of battery life.  If you do not use Bluetooth, turn it off now.  \nBluetooth 4 Devices are considerably better at battery life, since BT 4.0 has a better low powered mode, but the problem is still with 2.1 devices. I can have BT 4.0 device but if it is paired with a 2.1 device, it will consume more battery life.\nAccelerometer has never really come up ever as causing battery life issues or for draining more battery life than other things.  I wouldn't really worry about it.  Same thing goes for the compass inside the iPhone and Gyroscope.  \nGPS does use a good amount of battery, relatively between wifi and 3G standards, especially if you are constantly accessing it.  Still, you usually use this in a car, and if you are driving great distances then I would recommend getting a car charger anyway.  You can get them cheap and they are always useful.\nScreen Brightness, the unrealized killer of battery life.  Always make sure your screen is at an optimal brightness, with Auto Brightness (energy saving) settings always on in the screen brightness section of the Preferences App.  This setting helps a lot.  I would also recommend having your brightness at 50 percent. It may seem really dim at first, but your eye will get used to it and it can save a few percentages.\nI know its not the most perfect answer and doesn't give you extensive research study related material, but hopefully it will shed some light on the things you wanted to know.  I have a lot of experience with different battery issues and fixes when it comes to iPhones as a former Apple Employee.\nI hope it helps you out.\n", "Q: Troubleshooting a MacBook Pro that is not charging from power My MacBook Pro isn't charging, the light on the charger isn't lit, and the battery image indicates it is not charging . \nThe computer is approximately a year old.

I would recommend taking it to the Genius bar - they may replace the power supply for free (don't bank on it though). I believe they replaced my brother's free.\nAre there any other power supplies around that you could test? If not, it will be tested at the Apple store\n\nA: I've had a similar problem before and the charger wasn't completely broken. Here's what you can try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Plug you MacBook in some other location (seriously, it can be problem with the current in your location)\n\n*Plug the cable in the opposite way (I mean attach the charger to you MacBook in the way it caps the Ethernet plug).\n\n\nIf it won't help I am afraid you'll have to buy new charger. I would suggest trying another charger before buying a new one to determine if it is your charger or your Mac.\n\nA: If your computer is less than a year old, go to a genius bar, they will replace or repair it for free. I also advice you to get a extended warranty as it is kind of a repeating problem. In the past 2.5+ years, i had to replace my charger more than 2 times. But since i had the warranty they just gave me a new one. So it is definitely worth to invest in it. In my case its not only the charger they had to replace several other stuff on several occasions but going to genius bar is the best bet. \n\nA: A small tip for everyone; if this happens, attach a different charger to the macbook and then your old charger again. Works like a charm.\n\nA: I've literally tried everything, but the only thing you can do to get your Mac charging properly again is to buy a new charger. There are cheaper ones on Amazon that work just as well but make sure they are the same wattage as your current one so it does not cause any problems.\nI've gone through this four times and I had the battery replaced once but all in all you just need a new charger.\n", "Q: Is the iPhone always using Wifi (instead of cellular data network) when connected? When I'm in range and connected to particular Wifi, having cellular data transmission enabled at the same time, will the iPhone always use the Wifi connection?\nOr can the app developer choose which network has priority (e.g. always use cellular data transmission and not Wifi)?\n\nA: I believe you cannot chose programmatically whether to use the WiFi or the cellular data connection.\nIf the iPhone has a WiFi network available, it will automatically use it, otherwise, it will fallback on the cellular data connection.\n\nA: No. \nIPhone will use the cellular connection for push notifications at any time, unless \nSettings > General > Network > Cellular Data \n\nis turned off.  \nAlso, if the lock screen is on, then iPhone is connected to the cellular network, not wifi. \nIPad is always connected to wifi, lock screen or no.\n", "Q: FileVault 2 Login Issues on OpenLDAP Network with Admin, Managed, Mobile Account on Lion 10.7.4 This issue occurs on any machine with Lion in my environment. I install Lion and connect to OpenLDAP for authentication. I enable FileVault.\nSome users were reporting that when they'd wake their computer from sleep or reboot, the only available account to unlock FileVault was Administrator (not their local cached OpenLDAP account any longer).\nIn an attempt to reproduce this issue, I shut down all network interfaces on my test MacBook Pro and rebooted -- sure enough FileVault will only allow me to unlock my hard drive by using the Administrator password, just as it occurred for my users.\nAlso, when I tried to check to see if my user account was still enabled in FileVault (by accessing System Preferences -> Security & Privacy), System Preferences crashes. \nI found a workaround that sometimes works: Open any other System Preferences pane (for example, Users & Groups), and authenticate by clicking the lock icon. Then click Show All to go back to the main System Preferences UI, and access Security & Privacy again. It will work. In the FileVault tab, the text \"Some users are not able to unlock this disk\" appears (presumably my Admin, Managed, Mobile Account). I click on the \"Enable Users\" button and it brings up a dialog, but in this dialog my user account is the only one listed, and it has a green checkmark badge, as though it's set up properly (even when it isn't). If I click the \"Done\" button here, it appears to process something for a moment. If I reboot after doing this, it works, and I'm able to authenticate as myself.\nI think what is happening here is that the network is shutting down on MacBooks that are in sleep mode or shut down, and FileVault is then removing any accounts that authenticate with LDAP from the Enabled Users. I presume something is broken too here, due to the crash that happens when trying to investigate the FileVault configuration.\nSteps to Reproduce\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Lion.\n\n*Connect to my OpenLDAP server.\n\n*Enable FileVault 2, enable LDAP-authenticated user to unlock FileVault.\n\n*Reboot.\n\n*It works!\n\n*Log in, and disable network interfaces, with the goal of forcing Lion to use the cached LDAP credentials for user authentication in FileVault.\n\n*Reboot.\n\n*The only user that is available for authentication is Administrator.\n\n*After logging in as Administrator, then logging out, and logging back in as the LDAP-auth'd user, I try to access System Preferences -> Security & Privacy. This causes System Preferences to crash with the crash dump pasted below. The only way to prevent this crash is to authenticate by clicking the lock icon on any other System Preferences pane (e.g. Users & Groups), then click \"Show All\", then click \"Security & Privacy\" again. This time it will work. Details are noted in the above Summary section of this bug report.\n\n\nExpected Results\nI would expect FileVault 2 authentication to work for the user it is originally set up under. \nActual Results\nThis isn't happening, and the users end up not able to unlock their machine (and thus, can't work without me (the sysadmin) coming over and unlocking their machine as Administrator, then logging out and letting them log into OS X under their account). I have filed a bug report with Apple, but heard nothing from them. I'm going to get in touch with phone support to see if it is of any use, but I'm curious if anyone here has encountered and somehow overcome these issues.\nNotes\nHere is the crash log produced when trying to access Security & Privacy after the issue occurs:\nhttp://pastebin.com/2ewfZCUP\n\nA: FileVault 2 uses the GeneratedUID user attribute to save who is permitted to unlock an encrypted volume. If the GeneratedUID of a user differs from what was generated (or pulled from LDAP) when FileVault 2 was enabled, the user will not be permitted to unlock the machine, as their account will appear to be unavailable at the EFI menu. Also, this causes the crash of System Preferences on their Mac whenever they try to access the Security & Privacy prefpane.\nThis problem arises when /usr/bin/mcxrefresh runs and pulls a null value or a value different than what is stored locally from LDAP (if the attribute isn't defined for the user in question or is defined incorrectly, respectively), overwriting the GeneratedUID stored locally (which is generated and only stored locally when FileVault 2 is enabled without a matching LDAP attribute).\nIn other words, if an apple-generateduid value exists in LDAP for a user and is mapped properly on the users Mac to the GeneratedUID attribute, FileVault 2 will not generate a new value, but will instead use the value stored in LDAP.\nI was able to resolve this issue by adding an attribute called apple-generateduid to the LDAP entry of any user experiencing this issue.  I could generate a random value for this attribute in Python by running the following one-liner from my terminal:\npython -c 'import uuid; print str(uuid.uuid4()).upper();'\nThis isn't the only step, however. You must also add a mapping for this attribute on the client side. This is easily done using the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences.\n\n*Click Users & Groups.\n\n*Click Login Options.\n\n*Click on the Unlock Icon.\n\n*Under Network Account Server, click Edit.\n\n*Click to highlight your directory server.\n\n*Under Services, double-click on your directory service (in my case, it was LDAPv3)\n\n*In the window that slides open, highlight your configuration name, and then click the Edit... button.\n\n*Under Search & Mappings scroll down and single-click on Users to highlight it.\n\n*Click the Add button (the left one).\n\n*Choose GeneratedUID from the list of available Attribute Types.\n\n*In the right column, click the Add button, and type apple-generateduid. Click OK to save the changes until you're back at the main System Preferences dialog.\n\n*At this point a mapping from GeneratedUID to apple-generateduid has been created. Now when OS X looks up the GeneratedUID value it will get the value of apple-generateduid from the user in questions LDAP entry.\n\n\nFinally, it's important that the locally stored value of GeneratedUID and value stored on LDAP match. Run the following command and make sure the two GeneratedUID values match:\ndscl /Search search /Users GeneratedUID $(dscl . read /Users/$(echo $USER) GeneratedUID | cut -d \" \" -f2)\n\nA: Assuming they are mobile accounts (which should cache required user information locally on login) and there's a possibility of the network connectivity to the LDAP server not being immediately available / available at all, I'm highly suspicious of this log line:\n2   libcsfde.dylib                      0x00007fff8565af1f CSFDEGetUserEntryForUUID + 134\nThis is the thread that's crashing in your log and right before it crashes, it's attempting to get the length of a string returned as the result of that particular (private) library call.\nThe name of the call seems to imply: CoreServices Full Data/Disk Encryption (aka FileVault2) \"GetUserEntryForUUID\" - note: This is a function asking FileVault for user information based on a UUID, not the Collaboration framework, Identity Services, DirectoryServices / OpenDirectory, etc.\nThis bit of code is asking FileVault to provide details about a user with only UUID information, which sounds like FV is tracking user information separately (possibly) from the rest of OS X. This is accurate, because the FileVault2 procedure, as part of marking users available to unlock the boot OS partition, writes some information to the recovery partition.\nHowever, it sounds like there's a breakdown somewhere with OpenLDAP / mobile / \"alternative\" directory account authentication mechanisms and the necessary information isn't being written to be able to unlock it without network access to the OpenLDAP server.\nThis is just a shot in the dark - but maybe an Apple rep would be able to help more with this. Sounds like a legit real bug to me.\n", "Q: Time machine stuck on cleaning up/ Error -47 I have been using time machine with the same disk for a year or so and until now it was fine.

How do I recover a HFS Plus partition that somehow I've managed to delete or replace with a Linux command?\nI didn't do anything else, I mean, I didn't put any files or folders on the drive, so it is \"intact\".\nI just want to recover the partition, like I did once using Acronis Disk Director Suite, it was painless, easy and fast, but wasn't HFS+, was a NTFS formatted drive.\nI use Lion on may Mac and Linux Mint 13 on my PC.\n[Edit]\nThere is a method using Testdisk and/or Photorec, but I didn't get it. Does anyone know?\n[Edit]\nTestDisk & PhotoRec did the trick\n\nA: [I'm answering for anybody ending up here, as the original OP most probably is no more interested. I still refer to his problem description.]\nI tried using Testdisk 6.13 (latest stable release) and it worked like a breeze for both NTFS and HFS+. I had the luxury of an empty HFS+ partition, so I just removed it and recovered it using Testdisk - it was rather fast.\nI followed the following tutorials:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/linux-data-recovery.html\n\n*http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk_Step_By_Step\nIf you indeed just removed one partition, it should be fast. Otherwise, it might take more time, but probably waiting is the most sensible option. But if you're really impatient (as I am) and you know very well what you're doing, you might want to read on.\nA (dangerous) tip to speedup Testdisk from my own experience\nIf the partition entry is just removed, Testdisk will look for the start of the partition in sensible positions (by default, at the start of every cylinder, since partitions should usually be cylinder-aligned), ignoring the existing partition table. Once it thinks it found a partition and you confirm its guess, it will skip searching inside the partition.\nIf there is a lot of free space (without a filesystem) before the partition, this might be very slow. So I could speed up search a lot by creating a filesystem in an empty partition before the missing one, so that Testdisk would skip that space. However I knew perfectly where to create this filesystem, especially because it did not border with the lost partition. Otherwise, creating such a filesystem can easily destroy the wrong data - hence only attempt this if you know very well what you're doing.\n", "Q: Any app that will automatically size and lock Finder windows? For several years I was Windows-only at work and used a great utility that resized and locked my Explorer windows.\nI'm surprised I haven't come across this for the Mac as I am always repositioning, sizing my windows. Does anyone know if such an app exists?\n\nA: FinderMinder resizes Finder windows when they are opened. There is a small delay before windows are resized and you have to keep it running on the background though.\n\nI use this script to reset the properties of windows manually:\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    if number of windows is 0 then return\n    tell Finder window 1\n        set toolbar visible to false\n        set sidebar width to 0\n        set statusbar visible to false\n        set current view to column view\n        set bounds to {474, 250, 1318, 750}\n        tell its column view options\n            set shows icon to false\n        end tell\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nWhen you move or resize a window, Finder saves its dimensions to a .DS_Store file. You can make all folders use the default dimensions by deleting .DS_Store files:\nsudo find / -name .DS_Store -delete && killall Finder\n\nIt also removes Spotlight comments, resets the positions of icons in icon view, and removes folder-specific sorting modes and view options.\n\nA: What do you mean \"repositioning, sizing\" your windows? Are they always appearing in the wrong location, at the wrong size so you have to fuss with them and get them the way you like?\nIf so, the solution is built-in to the Finder. Close all but one Finder window and put it where you want it. Hit ⌘+J to show the view options window (fuss with any settings you want in there), and hit \"Use as Defaults\". Then close the options window and the Finder window and your settings should stick.\nOne caveat: any folder window for which you've set a position/size will open at that preset size and ignore your defaults. Just move it to the right position and it should stay there. If it doesn't, close it, delete the .DS_Store file from the Terminal, and reopen - it should then obey your defaults.\n\nA: If what you are looking for is a way of arranging a window to fill any of the sides of the screen, ShiftIt is the most popular choice.\nYou can find here a lot more. \n\nA: Finder Window Manager \"FWM\" is an excellent app that saves window setups (snapshots).

I have a Macbook Pro 15\" 2011 2.2 i7. Was running like a dream until I tried to add a second drive with an optibay. To cut a long story short a puff of smoke came out of the airport card. After the initial shock I rebooted to find no airport and the machine was running super hot when plugged in running off the mains. My dilemma is the machine works perfectly but is a potential fire hazard. As I soon as I plug into the mains the temps hit 70 quite quickly, too hot to touch underneath. When switched off it comes on by itself when plugged in also. So it has become a big silver coaster. Apple say they will replace the logic board and airport for £465 (which is actually not a bad price) but could it be something simpler. Any help would be appreciated. My household insurance will not cover 'mechanical' parts. If I had spilled coffee, dropped it or was stolen I would be fine. Any help would be much appreciated. I have Applecare also which makes it worse. \n\nA: Since you've paid for AppleCare - send it in. It doesn't make sense you would be charged for a repair unless there was some sort of external damage, so perhaps you misunderstand the quote.\nPerhaps the pricing was for an estimate if the fault was not covered so you could be prepared in case that were the case.\nCall back and ask to have your situation cleared up or drop by a store with if one with a Genius Bar is convenient. I would remove the third party RAM and accessories (as Apple will ask you and inspect for before beginning service) before presenting your Mac for service. Inform them you have had a second drive in the optibay and offer to let them have / evaluate the part if desired to ensure it didn't cause the malfunction.\nHere are the North American terms of service - and you can see that Apple may charge you a diagnostic fee if you send them a Mac and the failure is due to third party parts being the cause.\n", "Q: The iPhone is over 3 times more expensive than the iPod touch, how much more margin is Apple doing on the iPhone? Besides small differences like a minor camera, fundamentally the difference between the iPhone the iPod touch is the GSM/CDMA antenna and I guess more battery to support the antenna.\nYet the iPhone costs $650 and the iPod touch $200 which is quite surprising to me.\nIs it because Apple has a bigger margin on the iPhone or are the components of the iPhone really that much more expensive?\nedit: my question is not about the concept of demand and offer. To make it more explicit I'll change the question to how much more margin is Apple doing on the iPhone than on the iPod touch? Original Title: \"Why is the iPhone over 3 times more expensive than the iPod touch?\"\n\nA: The price for an object is the highest that the market will bear.\n\nA: According to iSuppli (as reported in the link by Reuters), there are $188 in parts in the iPhone 4S.\nAdding in the other costs, Horace Dediu over at Asymco suggests that Apple's operating margin on each iPhone is $319. He explains where he gets each number from.\niPod Touch margins, however, are much harder to track down. iSuppli has done a teardown of the components, but the costs are behind a paywall.\nYou'd take the iPhone component cost and, roughly, subtract out the amount for a cheaper display and less battery, a much worse camera, the cellular radios and antenna, the proximity sensor, the LED flash, the difference between a Bluetooth 4 chips and a Bluetooth 2.1 chip, and some additional circuitry for things like Airplay. However, how much those cost is, as far as I can tell, unknown outside of that paywall.\n\nA: The answer you are expecting won't satisfy you because the cost of making those devices is much less then the price they sell them for... \nBut in order to answer your question, I've made a table. Unfortunately,  I didn't find any records of the iPod touch 16GB and 32GB, but I expect they are quite alike.\n \nI'm sure Apple does get his share on the sold subsidized iPhones too.\nThe difference between US and Europe is the difference between a locked iPhone and an unlocked iPhone (because in Belgium, you pay this much for an iPhone...)\nHere is an interesting article about the difference in production costs between an iPod touch and an iPhone.\nAnd if you want to know what an iPhone costs in detail (every part), take a look at this overview.\nSo, although it seems like Apple is making an awe full lot of money on these devices, Apple invested billions and billions of dollars in R&D, design, production, marketing, distribution, stores, packaging,...\nSo in the end Apple is still taking a lot of profit on these devices, but not as much as you might think. In my opinion, they get paid for their hard work.\nTo answer your question why the iPhone costs more then the iPod touch, I think it's because, as you've pointed out, the design is quite similar so most of the costs of the iPod touch mentioned above (R&D, design,...) are already recouped with the iPhone, since the iPhone was released before the iPod touch.\n\n\nA: The premise that components are the primary cost to bring a product to market doesn't hold much water for any iOS device.\nThe most astute quip I have seen was by Horace Dediu on twitter as @asymco:\nThe iPhone is a salesman hired by the operator to sell mobile broadband service.\nHe gets a healthy commission because he's very good at it.\n\nI wouldn't confuse the initial price point or ongoing price point with the incremental cost to manufacture and sell a mass market product several years after release. The iPhone 3GS is still for sale and clearly it doesn't cost as much to make now as it did on the day it was released. It's also clear that each device released at the $650 retail price point doesn't really cost that to make. Retail pricing is more of a calculated gamble that the market will bear that price. Only months to years later can the margins be measured.\nI think the cart is a bit before the horse as I read your question. Also, I wouldn't say the difference between 3GS to 4 to 4S rear camera is small. The iPod touch rear camera is measurably worse than all of the above so I'm not sure how to address that other than offereing a different opinion.\n", "Q: Restarting speakers without rebooting?

Is there any way of asking for a password before picking up a call?\nThe iPhone's lock screen password works for not allowing people to access the iPhone main screen, but it allows anyone to pick up incoming calls.\n\nA: No unfortunately this isn't a feature that is currently supported on iOS (I suppose it would be possible on a jailbroken device).\n\nA: To go with the answer(s) that mention that this is not currently available, it isn't likely to become available in the future, as, with Siri, one can send texts and place calls without unlocking the device, and outgoing connections are more likely to need securing than incoming connections.\n", "Q: Is this a feasible security measure for my retail iPod Touches? I'm considering using several iPod Touch devices as mobile computers in a retail setting.\nIf I did do this, I'd have to provide some measure of security for them.

In theory all I'd need would be towers of the same frequency as the stickers.\nThe fourth generation iPod Touch teardown shows that the screen is easily lifted from the body of the device and shows an EMI shield covering the rest of the device.\n\nWould it be possible to attach one of these stickers and still have the screen close flush against the body?  Would it sitting between the screen and the bulk of the device interfere with the ability of the detection tower to detect the sticker?  Would the sticker interfere with the performance/lifespan of the iPod Touch?\nBasically, is this a feasible security measure?\nIf someone knows how Apple secures their retail iPod touch/barcode scanners that would also be very useful.\n\nA: You'd be better off looking for a sticker to put on top of your security sticker, and stick the sticker sandwich on the back of the device. Just use something that would be too time consuming to remove before trying to exit with the device, which would set off your alarm.  The theory being that by not hiding your effort to thwart a theft, you may deter the theft to begin with. Otherwise, it looks like a free iPod touch that nobody will notice is gone.

I have a Mac Mini with a few external drives connected that I use as a home server. Normally the Eject buttons next to the drive icon are really handy as they let me eject an external drive very easily (compared to Windows for instance).\nHowever on a Mac server, this comes as a detriment. I have some pretty mission critical stuff on external drives and there's a lot of scripts etc. I have set up that are dependent on those drives being there. Being able to so easily accidentally eject those drives makes me rather uneasy.\nSo far I've just chosen to not show them in the Finder sidebar, that way at least they're a bit harder to eject. However that isn't very ideal because: (1) I need to go to my Mac in the sidebar to access the drives rather than have the drives accessible directly and (2) the eject buttons still show in open/save dialogue boxes for those drives.\nIdeally, I'd like a way for them to behave the way internal drives do: no option to easily eject from the finder, but still possible to unmount through disk utility.\n\nA: Place a foot in the door.\n\n\n*\n\n*On each of your disks, create a text file, open it in TextEdit, add some line, and leave the file open unsaved.\n\n\nI think this trick will prevent ejection. \nTest this trick, try to eject the disk and come here tell us the result.\nThis trick can easily be automated.\n\nA: If your important external drive is mounted on the following mount point:\n/Volumes/important_disk\n\nThen you can protect it against an accidental removal by locking this mount point as opened. For this one very simple method consists in\nopening Terminal and doing this basic command:\n$ cd /Volumes/important_disk\n\nTo get rid of this locking, you might type within the same Terminal window:\n$ cd /\n\nor you might as well just close this Terminal window ($ exit, or ⌃+D, or ⌘+W).\n", "Q: Getting errors when trying to send something using Gmail and Mail 5 I've had a problem for awhile with a Gmail account linked to Mail, which arose last summer after I upgraded to Lion. When I try to send a signed message (signed, in terms of security, not a signature at the end of a message), a small error message pops up for no more than half a second (way to short for me to read), but I've been able to make out the message based on a well-timed screen capture: \n\nAn error occured while trying to sign this message with a certificate from [myusername]@gmail.com. Verify that your certificate for this address is correct, and that its private key is in your keychain.\n\nI have no idea what to do in this case, as my knowledge of digital security is superficial, to say the least. I posted this question on Apple Community Discussions awhile ago, but I got no answers whatsoever. Any advice?\n\nA: It took me a minute to find what he was talking about but near the right corner of the message toolbar you will see an icon that looks like a burst with a checkmark. Click this and it will turn to a burst with an x. Here is a screen shot.\n \n\nA: There is a little tick that adds the security certificate by default. Just click it to turn if off and it's solved. You can't miss it.\n\nA: The Digital Signature \"selection\" is now located in the subject box to the far right ... uncheck to not have the request come up for your user name and password\n", "Q: Some backup and restore questions? I have connectivity problems and I suspect the latest firmware version 5.1.1 is the source. I think it's impossible to revert back to the previous firmware, but my last backup was from before the update so I have an idea and two questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*If I restore from the pre-5.1.1 backup will the firmware be also restored, i.e., to pre-5.1.1?\n\n*If this is the case, and the problem was indeed caused by 5.1.1, then I would like to stay at that point in the update cycle, at least until 5.1.2 (or whatever). The question is: would I have first been able be able to backup my phone in its current state without affecting the pre-5.1.1 backup, and then (with the above restore done) restore, for instance, the videos and any other things not on iCloud, while leaving the firmware. (In other words, is there any way to cherry-pick parts of backups, as I would be trying to get the firmware from one backup and the content from another?)\nEDIT: Should have said, it's an iPhone 4S.\n\nA: Backups only contain your data, not the firmware. If you restore a device that's been upgraded to a new OS version from an older backup, you keep the new OS version. (This is, in part, because this is how iOS upgrades used to work: backup, wipe-and-install, then restore.)\nIt's actually pretty difficult (but not entirely impossible) to talk an iOS device into downgrading to an older version of iOS.\nTo your second question, I'm not certain of the degree to which you can cherry-pick what to restore from a backup. I've never attempted to do so, as I'm usually interested in restoring the entire previous device state. I imagine that it would be straightforward (if time-consuming) to simply restore everything to the device then remove what you don't want.\n", "Q: Using Apple's IR remote to simulate a left/right mouse click or navigate presentations I have a 2009 MacBook Pro running OS X 10.7 with an Apple IR remote. Since I create my presentations with LaTeX, which generates PDF files, I cannot use the remote to control my presentations (it only works with Keynote out of the box, not with Preview). \nSome searching around led me to this app that allowed one to extend the remote to other programs. However, this was last updated in 2009 for Snow Leopard, and it doesn't work with Preview on Lion. Some apps like Spotify, have dedicated addons/scripts  that will let you do this (for that app).\nIs there a way to get Apple remote to work with either Preview.app or Adobe Reader/Acrobat? At the very least, can it be made to simply do a left click and right click (i.e., Next → Right click, Prev → Left click), so that I can have the most basic navigation capabilities?\n\nA: I know that there are a few ways to add support for various apps, but you might want to consider paying for Mira.  \nI've used it for a few 10.6 and 10.7 laptops and it works great.\nThere's also Remote Buddy, although I've not tried it personally.\n\nA: I liked da4's suggestion to use Remote Buddy, and am accepting his answer. I've used the trial version (full functionality) for a few days now and it feels like a mature and polished app — certainly worth buying. This answer addresses how to \"simulate a left/right mouse click\" (that was part of the question) and changing the behaviour in general, using Remote Buddy.\n1: Changing the behaviour for an app that's supported by default\nRemote Buddy comes with some built-in behaviours for several apps like Chrome, Safari, iCal, Preview, Adobe Reader, etc. You can change the behaviour for any button by going to Remote Buddy > Preferences > Mapping and selecting the desired action.\nFor example, in the case below, I'm setting the Menu button to mirror the displays, instead of the default Remote Buddy menu.\n\n2: Adding support for an app not supported by default\nIf you notice above, I've added mappings for TeXShop, which is not an app that's supported out of the box. You can create custom behaviour by going to Remote Buddy > Behaviour Construction Kit > Behaviour factory. In there, click on the + sign to create a new app and drag your app to the \"Bundle Identifier\" field. Then switch to the Default Mapping tab and set the desired action for the buttons under Apple Remote. You can use the virtual keyboard or virtual mouse to simulate some common key/button presses.\nWhen you're done, click on \"Compile and testdrive Scripted Behaviour\" to test your remote controls, and if you're satisfied, you can choose \"Compile, testdrive and permanently install Scripted Behaviour\", which installs it in the list of default mappings.\n\n", "Q: How do I compose email first and then add a group to the bcc line?

I created a smart group that I would like to add to the BCC line after composing a message, however I can't seem to find a way to do this.  I am using the default Mail application.\n\nA: If I understand your problem well enough, in the Apple Mail program, once you have written your email you can click on View->BCC Address Field and that should open the BCC space to add your group.\n", "Q: After iOS 5.1.1 my ipod doesn't list artists/albums in the correct order Over the weekend I upgraded my iPod 3 to iOS 5.1.1 and jailbroke it.\nToday I noticed that artists and albums are not properly sorted and it doesn't display everything. However, all the tracks are on the iPod and in iTunes I can see all the tracks/albums/artists in the correct order.\nThis is what it looks like:\n\nAs you can see \"Everlast\" is listed under \"H\", \"Exciter\" is listed under \"I\" and \"J\", etc etc.\nI would rather not completely wipe it since re-encoding/uploading all the tracks will take a very long time.\nIt seems like I need to somehow delete/rebuild artist and album database on the ipod itself..\n\nA: This is a well known issue. There is a very long discussion going on on the Apple Support pages. As far as I can see, there are two solutions which proved to fix this issue.\n\n\n*\n\n*Switching the iPhone languages seems to work in some cases. Switch to Japanese and back to English (or your own language) and this should do the trick according to some users.\nHowever, I would advise you to memorize the navigation very well, since it's very hard to find your way back in Japanese :)\n\n*Another thing which seems to fix this is to this \"new feature\". When navigating to Settings > Music, there should be an option to toggle Group by Album Artist. Toggle it off and after a resync, the problem should be fixed.\nAnd while you're in the menu, make sure you've turned off Shuffle as well.\n\n\nI can't confirm neither of these solutions since I cannot reproduce this error. So I hope it helps you out. \n\nA: I was able to get my music properly sorted again.\nChanging languages did not help. Changing album grouping did not help.\n\n*\n\n*Using iphonebrowser I deleted (actually renamed, just in case)\n\n/User/Media/iTunes_Control/iTunes/MediaLibrary.sqlitedb\n  \n  This is the file that contains all of the primary the music metadata on your iOS device.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Next I rebooted my iPod and went back into the Music app to see that it was now totally empty. (that's good)\n\n*Next I connected my iPod to my computer and saw iTunes show ~20GB used by \"Other\" on my iPod. (that's good too)\n\n*Next in iTunes I selected every single track, right-clicked and did \"Get Info\". From there I changed a single tag that I knew would not affect anything in my collection: \"Sort Show\". In that field I just put \"qqq\". It can be anything just so that it'll change.\n\n*After waiting a few minutes for iTunes to update every single of my 5146 tracks, I synched my iPod. iTunes/iPod are smart enough to recognize that the actual files are still on the device, so all it had to do was re-upload current metadata information.\n\n*Next, back in iTunes I selected all my tracks again and deleted that needless \"Sort Show\" tag. After a few more minutes of iTunes updating all the files again I synched my iPod one last time and voila!\nAll my 5146 tracks are there and properly sorted in every category.\nI did not have to reset my iPod or restore from backups or do anything like that.\nI hope it helps other people.\n", "Q: Is there any way to disable the tone when changing the volume on Mac On my MacBook Pro, when I hit the F11 or F12 to change the volume, a tone is played I presume to preview the volume.\nThat tone can be rather intrusive when watching a movie or listening to music.\nYou can hold the shift key down to surpress that tone.\nBut is there any way to just disable it permanently? \n\nA: Yes. If you open System Preferences (found in /Applications/Utilities, or select it from the  Menu) and choose the Sound pane, there is a checkbox at the bottom of the Sound Effects tab which controls the default behavior (content edited out of image). The shift key overrides this, so if you uncheck the box holding shift will play the sound instead.\n\n", "Q: How to find the Lion installation image on the iMac? I recently bought Lion for $29.99 for my iMac on the App Store, and now want to burn a disc so that I can make another white Macbook that has Snow Leopard dual boot to Lion as well (Apple allows installing Lion on more than one machine that a user owns).  Also, I wanted to create a disc so that if there is an need in the future, there is a disc to boot to.\nBut I followed the instructions on \nhttp://osxdaily.com/2011/06/08/create-burn-bootable-mac-os-x-lion-install-disc/\nhttp://osxdaily.com/2011/07/08/make-a-bootable-mac-os-x-10-7-lion-installer-from-a-usb-flash-drive/\nwhich are both linked from Can I dual boot Snow Leopard and Lion?\nand the InstallESD.dmg file cannot be found.  In fact, if I type dmg in the Finder's search box, and chose \"Disc Image\" (kind / type), the whole hard disk doesn't have a file that is more than 90MB in size.  If I go to the Applications folder, the largest size shown is merely 495MB...\nHow can this be solved?  thanks.\n\nA: When you buy Lion from the App Store, it downloads an application named Install Mac OS X Lion to your Applications folder.  InstallESD.dmg is hidden inside this application.  Since it's hidden, a Spotlight search normally won't show it; you need to find the installer application, right-click on it, choose Show Package Contents, and then navigate to the image inside it (both links have instructions for this).\nThere is one more complication: when you run the Lion installer application, it installs Lion and then deletes the installer.  But you can re-download it if you know the trick: open the App Store, Option-click on the Purchases icon in the toolbar, and you should have a Download button available for OS X Lion.\n", "Q: Using FaceTime and Skype (both open at the same time) I would like to use both Skype and FaceTime at the same time (not while calling just having them both open).\nWhen I start FaceTime it switches on the camera and keeps it on.

In theory the camera is only needed during calls.\n\nA: There is an app for that :)\nManyCam will allow you to use the iSight camera over multiple applications. I haven't had the chance to test it myself, but according to the app description, it should work just fine.    \nSome customers complain about a slow Mac, some don't.

OR How do I disable QuickLook entirely? I've been watching lots of .MKVs lately, opened from the Finder. In Column View, when you single-click any file, QuickLook will load a viewable thumbnail into the next column over. This causes noticeable and repeated momentary hangs in Finder responsiveness. \nI have a feeling this is related to a non-Apple-kosher file-type like Matroska Video giving QuickLook some problems. \nHas anyone had experience with this problem, OR have a way to disable QuickLook entirely? I ask because I would rather have my OS always be responsive than have CPU time eaten so that a useless thumbnail can be loaded that I never use.\n\nA: Open Terminal, type:\nsudo nano /System/Library/Sandbox/Profiles/com.apple.qtkitserver.sb\nThis will open the nano editor with the rules file.

This will disable thumbnail creation for all movie files, not just MKVs.\nA better fix (if you know what you're doing) would be to restrict the Movie.qlgenerator plugin to only displaying content of certain video formats:\nRight-click on Movie.qlgenerator - you should be able to open its Contents folder and see its Info.plist file. You could try modifying this to exclude .mkv files; unfortunately there's no way to do this directly, but you could modify the LSItemContentTypes part to only include types that aren't .mkv.\nYou absolutely must backup Movie.qlgenerator before doing this. Anyway, once you've backed it up, open Info.plist in the original plugin within the Quicklook framework; you'll probably need to use XCode, or you could try using plutil on the command-line if you're comfortable with that (plutil -convert xml1 <path_to_Info.plist>), since the .plist is in binary format by default.\nFind LSItemContentTypes (in XCode look for Document types then Document Content Type UTIs). This is an array of items, with one entry of public.movie, which basically means \"any movie that Quicktime can open\".\nRemove this and instead add entries for the following UTIs:\ncom.apple.quicktime-movie\npublic.avi\npublic.mpeg\npublic.mpeg-4\npublic.3gpp\npublic.3ggp2\n\n(or the UTIs for the movie types you would like to keep the previews for)\n\nA: For OS X 10.8.5, the method below works well enough for me to stop looking for a better solution.

I had been using the phone for a handful of days. Last night however the phone ran out of battery.\nA few hours later, I plugged my phone to charge to find that when it got to the booting process with the apple logo, it stuck for a good ten minutes and then reboots. I let it reboot all night to see if anything changed.\nThere are a few things to note:\n\n*\n\n*Before that phone ran out of battery, voice control was getting activated without me pressing the home button. If voice control did not get activated, then the music app would play a track. This happened twice during the day before the phone battery died in the evening.\nI don't know if it is related. I blew on the button in case any dust was stuck. I also pressed the home in repeated succession to see if that would do anything. It eventually went away not sure how. Another reason that voice control and the music app activated because both happened when the phone was in a pocket.\n\n\n*Another thing to note is that my sleep/wake button is numbed from excess use. The button does not work and hasn't for over a year.\n\n\n*Finally the odd thing about when the phone shut down, the rotating circle did not appear. Just a black screen appeared and I don't recall a 10% warning coming up either but I am not certain of that.\nMy question is can I hard reset without using the sleep/wake button? Thank you\n\nA: You say that your \"display off button is numbed from excess use\".  Apple calls this the \"Sleep/Wake Button\"\nOne of the functions of the Sleep/Wake button is to power off the device.  Another is to hard reset the device.  A hard reset is performed by holding down the Sleep/Wake Button and the Home button until the device shuts off.\nIt seems likely based on what you've told me that the numbed Sleep/Wake Button has started intermittently being activated.  This, along with a stuck Home button is probably activating the hard reset function.  \nI say this because you said that the voice control was starting on its own (stuck Home button) and that the \"when the phone shut down, the rotating circle did not appear.\"\nThis is exactly how a hard reset works.\nThis would also explain why you didn't see the 10% battery life warning and why, if the hard reset keeps getting activated, your phone wouldn't finish booting.  You can activate the hard reset while the phone is in the process of booting.\n\nA: 1st, simply takeout your SIM out of your device and switch on 3G & data from your network settings. In case they are already on, simply toggle them & plug your SIM card back in.\n2nd (in case that 1st trick didn’t worked somehow), SSH your device or get iFile and go to your launch daemons directory (which probably is System/Library/LaunchDaemons) and simply remove 5 files (like com.apple.report.samplexx). For safety, just rename them with iFile with extension like _bkup or whatever you want and simply reboot your device afterwards. No annoying restarts, no Apple logo stuck, no need for battery replacement or restoring your device.\n", "Q: MagSafe Power Cable Going Yellow Well, my MBP cable has gone yellow after a while. I've tried cleaning it with water, and also toothpaste (with whitening) and that doesn't seem to have removed the yellow stains. I guess I'll try mouthwash next; I may have to gargle that myself first. Anyone have the same problem? I haven't been keeping it in unusual places, in my bag and on the desk.\nOn the left is the whiter clean cable.\n\n\nA: Depending on how old the charger is, it is possible the agent causing the discoloration is leaching through from what the casing covers instead of being caused by an external source. In this case, bleaching and cleaning will affect only the surface of the cable.\nI used to have several cables like this, on old barrel-shaped (non-MagSafe) chargers, but when the laptops were recycled, so were the chargers, so I don't have anything to dissect to prove my assertion.\nThe power charger can also get quite hot when charging, and if the charging cable is partially or wholly wound on the charger body's cable-storage fingers, they may become very hot as well, causing some of the discoloration you see. I always fully unwind the connection cable before charging.\n\nA: Typically when I clean my power adapter, I use a paper towel or cloth which is damp with rubbing alcohol. I have found this is be very effective for removing dirt. Rubbing Alcohol can leave a residue so you may also consider using a paper towel or cloth which is damp with water to rinse afterward.\n\nA: Cleaning the cable with a baking soda solution is likely to help. Baking soda will act as a mild abrasive. Alternatively, some web sites suggest using a bleach mix.\nDo not soak the cable and do not get either end of the cable wet. Please be careful!\n\nA: I got it replaced at the Apple Store. The \"genius\" explained that the old ones (pre-2011?) were softer and contained halogen from memory, whereas the new ones were more rigid and environmentally friendly.

So if you upgraded files you uploaded that matched to iTunes-Plus-type files, then you keep those once it cancels. \n\nA: \nYou are unable to down- or upload Music to iTunes Match\n\nSo be careful:\n\nBefore iTunes Match is expiring, download all your Music from the\n  iCloud (iTunes Match).\n\nSo, only the music you bought through iTunes is accessible.\nMusic which you matched through iTunes Match is lost, and cannot redownload on any device.\nOnly the files you have on your hard drive can kept, and those which bought through iTunes.\n\nA: You will want to download a copy of anything you wish before letting the subscription lapse if you don't otherwise have a copy of the music and playlists on a machine that is backed up.\nThe match provides playlist syncing, so your iTunes will act just like it does when not connected to the network. You will only be able to play songs that are cached or downloaded locally. I would presume that songs that only existed in the cloud would either be shown as missing or cleaned up and deleted - perhaps with a message letting you know what happened.\nI've not found a way to test this yet since subscriptions are only yearly and we haven't gotten to the point where someone can actually have this happen as part of the normal subscription expiration process.\n\nA: There are a few confusing responses here, so let's clarify: if you are going to let iTunes Match expire, make sure you have downloaded the music that is in the cloud to your local hard drive first. Once it is there and you turn off iTunes Match, those items will be left untouched on your computer. You will no longer has access to what was in the cloud.\nOne of the great benefits to iTunes Match is that you have the opportunity to have all of your music converted to the higher bitrate of 256 kbps. Whatever is matched in the cloud is available to re-download at this bitrate. It does not automatically do this to your library and only matched songs that iTunes Match has from the iTunes Store are available at this bitrate.\nI have found it is easiest to go into Album view in iTunes (select an album you know is in a lower bitrate) and delete it from your local hard drive. The cloud icon will appear below that album cover now. Re-download at the higher bitrate by clicking on that icon. There are a couple of prompts when you delete locally, do not check the box that asks you if you also want to delete it from the cloud for obvious reasons.\n\nA: My iTunes match subscription expired last week. Of 64gb of music, mostly from my CD collection, 12gb appears in iTunes with the song title & artist but no album grouping. A further 4gb only the song title appears in iTunes without a link to the artist/album. Also some songs are now linked to the wrong artist &/or wrong album. In all cases I have looked at so far, by playing the piece of music & selecting \"show in windows explorer\" the music is found in the correct artist/album folder on my hard drive. Deleting & reloading an album from the hard drive does not correct the problem. I think the only option is to find the music affected is to reload the CD's once again. Added to this, all of my ratings, done over many years, have been deleted. I had about two thirds of my music rated & I don't think I'll ever get back to this point again.  \n\nA: My itunes match expired today. And all my songs completely dissapeared, even the ones downloaded to my hard drive.\n", "Q: iPhoto keeps importing duplicates I have a \"MyPictures\" folder in which I keep my photos. I do not want iPhoto to manage my photos for me by copying them into its \"Library\", I just want to use the program \"pointing\" to the \"MyPictures\" folder. As I take photographs, I add them to the \"MyPictures\" folder; every now and then I'd like to update my iPhoto library \"adding\" the new photos just by \"reimporting\" the \"MyPictures\" folder. \nWhenever I do that, iPhoto re-imports the whole set of photographs, unable to detect obvious duplicates.\nCould you kindly help me fix this, please?\nMy settings:\n\n\n*\n\n*Operating system: Snow Leopard (10.6.8)  \n\n*Application version: iPhoto '11  \n\n*iPhoto library location: $USER/My/Application_Data/iPhoto, same problem when using defaults  \n\n*Home folder: uses FileVault, same problem when switching it off  \n\n\niPhoto preferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*Importing (Copy items to iPhoto library): No, but also tried saying yes to that\n\n*Look up Places: Automatically, but tried many times to switch this off to no avail\n\n\nFailed attempts:\n\n\n*\n\n*Repairing library database\n\n*Rebuilding small thumbnails \n\n*Rebuilding all thumbnails   \n\n*Recovering orphaned photos   \n\n*Repairing library permissions\n\n\nI am at a loss as to what to try next.\nIt seems like iPhoto itself \"adds some data\" to the photographs so that it does not recognise the original as such anymore. Whatever the cause, it is very frustrating for the app not to know it has already \"seen\" that photo and to re-import it every time.\n\nA: After waiting for quite a bit of time, I have to answer my own question and do so \"negatively\": doing what I want to do just seems impossible for the time being. Working with pictures one allows iPhoto to \"duplicate on import\" works fine, it just means that iPhoto will more than double the storage requirements for the photo library, essentially duplicating it and adding its own thumbnails, Places/Faces metadata, etc. How disappointing. :(\n\nA: Trash the Preferences File and try again.\nI'm curious, why do you want to run iPhoto in this mode? It offers no extra functionality, extra work for you and creates the possibility of problems later on - especially when migrating to other disks or moving to a new machine.\n", "Q: Can you force a mobile site on your iPhone to show full desktop view? Is there a way to force websites, when browsing them on your phone, to go into full desktop view? For instance, when I go to the NASCAR website on my phone, it displays a mobile version. But the mobile version doesn't give everything the full desktop site does.\nI can trick the site to think I am browsing it on a computer by putting something after the .com,like .com/News and it will work, but then when I go to their homepage by clicking on the logo, it redirects to the mobile version. I am using an Apple iPhone 4 for my device.\n\nA: I don't think you can do this in Safari on the iPhone but you could use a 3rd party browser app. Many of those will let you set the browser agent. One browser I know does this is  'Atomic Web Browser'. This may not work in all cases as some websites may use other ways of determining which content to show, for example, some will detect the screen dimensions.\nI've tried this on my iPhone with Atomic Web Browser. Within the browser, I went to settings, 'Identify browser as' and selected 'Safari Desktop'. Then I went to nascar.com and tapped on the nascar logo. It showed me the desktop version of the page.\nI checked in mobile safari and doing the same indeed took me to a mobile version.\n\nA: An additional recommendation: the free Puffin browser in the App Store displays full websites.\n\nA: Google Chrome for iPhone is my daily driver for Stackexchange and it works wonderfully well both in desktop and mobile modes. \n\n\n\n*\n\n*Tap the menu button\n\n*Reqest Desktop Site\n\nA: Using Safari on iOS 9 and iOS 10 you can hold down the reload icon in the address bar (top right) and then select \"Request Desktop Site\".\nYou can also tap the share icon (bottom of browser, next to forward arrow), then scroll across to \"Request Desktop Site\".  \nYou can also do this in Safari on iOS 8 but you must enter the URL, allow it to load, tap the url to bring up the menu, then pull down to unhide the \"Add to Favourites\" and \"Request Desktop Site\" options. Then select the \"Request Desktop Site\" option.\n\nA: A 3rd-party web browser should do the trick for you. I recommend iCab Mobile ($1.99). \niCab lets you change the UserAgent you're using, which should trick most websites into serving you the desktop version of their site, and not a watered-down mobile equivalent. \n\nA: I used Diigo browser, its got option to identify as desktop browsers and works fine with fb! - FREE too! ;)\n", "Q: How do I configure an .osx file? I have found the following repository on GitHub...\nhttps://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/master/.osx\n...that has some useful environmental settings I would like to adopt.  It appears they go into a .osx file.  Where is this file located?  Also, when does it 'run'?  Do I have to reboot the machine to get the settings in this to be recognized?\n\nA: Select settings that look interesting, paste them in a terminal, and then quit and reopen applications to try them out.\nYou might also save the whole script as for example ~/.osx and then run bash ~/.osx in a terminal. It includes commands for things like changing the computer name though.\nThe defaults commands modify files like ~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist, and you only have to run them once. Adding them to .bash_profile would only make your shell startup time longer. You might keep a personal file like .osx though in case you make a clean installation of OS X. And for example chflags nohidden ~/Library has to be run again after every OS X update.\nI have a file like .osx only for settings that can't be changed from the UI (defaults.txt). I think it's easier to transfer settings to new OS X installations by recreating them manually, by copying the plist files, or by using Migration Assistant.\n\nA: That looks like a shell script that is missing the shebang at the top of the file. \nIt could be that it is intended to be copied into an existing script to provide OS X-specific functionality so the main script can be portable (I'd expect there to be dotfiles for other operating systems, as well.)\nOn the other hand, it could be intended as a file of ideas and you pick the ones you want and paste them into your .bashrc or .bash_profile.\n", "Q: Different types of USB cable I have 30-pin-to-USB cables that came with iPod touch 3rd generation, 4th generation, and iPad 3rd generation. Are the cables different? If so, how can I identify which is which? I notice differences in the width of the cable, color of the plastic part on both sides of the connector (gray vs. white), and the length of the rubber tube that covers the connector, but am not sure if these are just minor variants or they are different products.\nI know that the newer models accept 2A current, as opposed to 1A on older models, and the AC adaptors are designed differently accordingly, but was not sure whether the cables are also different.\n\nA: The older USB cables from iPod days have deeper and thicker plastic enclosures on the 30 pin end as well as physical buttons on the sides to help disengage the metal \"ratchets\".\nThe connectors that came with the iPhones had much weaker springs for the side \"ratchets\" so you could just pull to detach the connector.\n\nHere is a Bluetooth iPhone charger (that is slightly larger and thicker than the iPod model) with a current iPhone cable for comparison.\n\nThe cables are all functionally equivalent once seated so you don't need to worry about current or power since even the oldest USB cable can carry all the signals needed for the latest iOS products and chargers. \n", "Q: Energy saver: do the battery settings apply during charging? I have my Macbook pro 17 (early 2011, OSX 10.6.8) set to turn off the display at 30 minutes on AC, and 10 minutes on battery.\nI've noticed recently that if the battery is charging (the little battery icon shows a lightning bolt and has a countdown timer to full charge) then the display goes to sleep at 10 minutes, even though it's plugged in.\nIs this normal behavior?  Is it configurable, aside from changing the battery settings to match the plugged in settings?\n\nA: This sounds like a bug in the power management software and I cannot reproduce the issue with my current MacBook Air.\nHave you been watching the power settings with the pmset command?\nThe -g log command might show you something to help debug why this is happening. Worst case, you can have a few tabs open in terminal and watch -g pslog and -g assertionslog to see if some program is somehow overriding the defaults that you have set.\nThese logs and the timings would also make for a good bug report if you determined that it was simply an error in programming on Apple's part.\n", "Q: iCloud not syncing with work machine I use an iMac at work and recently have been upgraded to Lion. I've used Lion at home since it came out.\nI've switched iCloud on on the iMac, but none of the calendar events are visible on my other devices.\nIs this because of some firewall or other security? What should I ask my IT dept. to fix this?\niCal is synced at work to my work email (Exchange) and at home to my personal GMail account\nMany thanks.\n\nA: In order for iCloud to work, you must be signed into that account on all devices that you wish to sync. For example, in your situation, you must be signed into your Google account on all your devices in order for iCloud to push those events to all devices. However, this must be explained more clearly, as that part can be confusing. All Apple devices handle multiple email accounts in a superb fashion, but you must be signed into each account to have it download those events/data onto that device.\nCase in point: you sign into both Gmail, as well as Exchange on all your devices, and it will sync events over all devices. It should be noted that Exchange calendars are completely separate from iCloud and MS Exchange handles it's own events. When you have more then one email address in iCal or the Calendar iOS app, you have the option of which account to put it on, and it will sync that accordingly.\nProbably the best for you would be to set up Exchange on your personal devices, and, if you don't want to receive mail, simply disable that, leaving the calendars synced. That way, when you create an event at work, it will show up on your other devices under the MS Exchange, but if you create it at home, it will show up as your Gmail (iCloud), unless you chose differently when creating the events.\n", "Q: WinOnX how to install DirectX I want to play a cool game called Just Cause 2. I have a copy, but there is a problem because it needs DirectX 11. Anybody knows how I can install that DirectX? Because I think it's only for Windows, but I don't know WinOnX is emulating Windows 7.  \n\nA: WinOnX is a repackaging of the Wine framework. Wine does not emulate Windows (strictly speaking), it just provides adapter libraries to allow Windows programs to run. According to this page, Just Cause 2's compatibility with Wine is rated \"garbage\" and it doesn't run. There is also a link to this page that shows the progress of re-creating the DirectX DLLs for Wine. As of early June 2012, they seem to be about 37% complete with DirectX versions 8-10, and there's no indication of work on DirectX 11 yet.\ntl;dr: It won't work. You need to virtualize a real copy of Windows using VMware or Parallels or run Windows in Boot Camp to play a DirectX game like that on your Mac.\n", "Q: searching an nfs-mounted volume Does anyone know of a GUI way to search  mounted network volume without using Spotlight? We use a cluster roughly 80TB and need a client-side way of searching for files without indexing the entire thing every two seconds...\n\nA: I'd recommend checking out EasyFind to see if it solves your problem. My shop has been using it to search SMB network volumes.\n", "Q: Is there an easier way to purchase commercial ringtones and use them on an iPhone 4? So I've only had my iPhone 4 (previous Droid user) for about 3 months or so now. Yes it has some great features that my Droid didn't, but one thing I really do not like is the ringtones. On the Droid, I could download an app, find a ringtone, download it and set it within a minute or 2, no problem at all! But with the iPhone, the only way to get a commercial ringtone is to sync it through iTunes? Which might be all fine and dandy if I always had my iPhone cord and my laptop on me 24/7. Another thing I ran into was finding the song name and artist have to be the same for the ringtone to sync? Does this also act the same for music?\nSo what it all comes down to is pretty much this, what is the easiest and non-confusing way to purchase and install ringtones on my iPhone 4?\n\nA: The trick should lie in converting your file to the appropriate format and renaming it so that it appears to be a regular ringtone file. (e.g. create an M4A file and change its extension from .m4a to .m4r). The top three links on a Google search are good tutorials if you like step-by-step instructions: https://www.google.es/search?rls=en&q=%22ringtone%22+%22iphone%22+%22m4r%22\nBTW, you can sync your iPhone over the air. Connect it to iTunes and look for the option \"Sync with this iPhone over WiFi\", first screen of the Summary/Info/Apps/Tones/Music/Movies/TV Shows/iTunes U/Books/Photos lineup.\n\nA: First, +1 for the switch :-)\nI find it makes it easiest to get a ringtone app which does most of the work for you. The one I have is called \"Ringtones\" (with a grey circle and orange music note in the icon) which is very intuitive and extremely easy to use. I believe it has a video, after saving the clip on the phone, that describes the process.\n\nA: If you are interested in jail breaking your phone, there is an app in cydia that is way, way, better than anything on the appstore. The app is called (UnlimTones).\n\nA: Are you using iCloud and gmail or other mail? If so you have to link all the contacts in all the groups together. \n\nA: I use ringer.org to make free ringtones for my iPhone:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Browse an audio file or upload from the Internet. Input file formats: AAC FLAC M4A MP3 OGG WAV WMA.\n  \n*Find the portion of the song you like by moving markers.\n  \n*Set the ringtone file format and delivery mode. M4R for iPhone, MP3 for most of the others.\n  \n*Convert the song to a ringtone by clicking Make Ringtone.\n  \n\n", "Q: Apple TextEdit - where is the file being saved? I used to use Save As… to remember the directory I was saving a file in, but that seems to have disappeared with the latest OS.\nI have a file open in TextEdit. How does one go about finding the directory that this file is currently being saved to? I can see the name and I can \"open recent\" (which just displays the name), but, once open, I can't actually figure out how to determine where this file is located.\n\nA: Try pressing Command⌘ while you left-click on the document window title text. It will show the folder hierarchy in a pop-up menu.\n\nA: If you want to do more than just look at the path, try this.\n\n*\n\n*Ctrl+Click on the filename in the title bar, or secondary click. That opens the list of \"Folder Proxies\" (a new term for me).\n\n*Option+Click on the folder name, right under the filename. That opens up a Finder window with the current file selected.\n\nIf Finder > View > Show Pathbar has been selected, the bottom of the Finder window will show the path to the file.

I am a French expatriate in Dubai and I would like to be connected to the French Apple Store instead of those of the United Arab Emirates. If I enter one address in France, the system requires a credit card number corresponding to a French bank account and I don't have an account in France anymore. What can I do to solve this problem?\n\nA: I had this problem as well. I thought of maintaining 2 accounts (one for each country) but that just seemed clunky, so I opted for having just one in my \"home\" country (USA). Which is what I'm guessing you did too.\nThis was a couple years ago, but I remember contacting iTunes Support and explaining the situation. They basically said it was OK to go either way, but there's no bending the rules about what country the account is paid from, and you're still liable for all taxes etc. as if you were in the country you choose.\nThat doesn't answer your question yet, but since I have credit cards in neither country, I've had to get a bit creative. I've ended up funding all my iTunes and App Store purchases with gift cards.\nIf iTunes/App Store gift cards are available in France, you're pretty much set. Get a friend or relative in France to buy the card and send you the code. Set the iTunes account up using the gift card.\nIf you don't have anyone in France to buy you cards, I'm sure there are sites where cards are sold by third parties (and the codes delivered digitally).\nI don't know of any for France, but I've used one to get my US cards and it worked perfectly. Do expect them to charge a commission on top of the value of the card. They have to stay in business too.\nIf gift cards aren't available for France then this option won't work for you.\nYou might be asking yourself how I bought the US gift card if I don't have a CC in the country where I am now. I have a prepaid VISA debit card here. Many sites will accept this as a credit card, so I used that to buy the iTunes gift card.\nYes, a bit complicated, but it occurs to me that, if this type of VISA debit card is available in France, you could just get one of those and use it in lieu of a credit card.\nI have no idea if the France iTunes store will accept it though, but the fees for creating a card like that are usually like $10US upfront, nothing recurring (which is what I assume you're trying to avoid by not having a card in France), and they last for 2 years or more. So that might be worth a shot.\nHope you figure something out. Let us know what you end up doing.\nPS: I helped a friend with this exact problem a couple months ago, actually walking them through the sign up. I noticed that since he was connecting from a non-US IP, it kept trying to sign up for the local store, even though the gift card was for the US store.\nThe solution is to use a VPN or proxy that makes it look like you're connecting from the country the card is for. This only happens if you're creating a brand new account with a card, and it only happens the first time.\nOnce the account was set up it continued working flawlessly WITHOUT the VPN, even when entering newly bought cards. I suspect this is just Apple trying to keep people from doing silly things, the same way you can't paste a password when changing your Apple ID password. It's a shame for those of us using password managers though...\n", "Q: How to enable push notifications of emails? A quick question with perhaps no answer,\nHow can I enable push notifications of emails?\nWhat currently happens when I get an email is that my phone vibrates or rings, then I look at the locked screen and no information is displayed.\nI'd like a preview of the email in a notification window with at least the sender.\nI currently have 3 mailboxes, one in google, one in hotmail, the other a private work exchange server.\nIs there a solution to receive push notifications for all of my mailboxes?\n\nA: You're talking about the notification settings for Mail, not whether push is on. To see new mail messages in the Lock Screen: \nSettings > Notifications > Mail > Make sure \"View in Lock Screen\" is turned ON. \nIf you're concerned about your mail's push settings, those are in:\nSettings > Mail, Contacts, Calendar > Fetch New Data > Make sure \"Push\" is set how you want it. \n\nA: For iOS 11+ users, find Push Mail’s Parameters by going to Settings > Accounts & Passwords > Fetch New Data.\n\nA: There is no push for mail settings for iPhone 5\n", "Q: OS X Server 10.7.4: VPN Authentication Failed for new users I can't seem to get new users to access VPN on our OS X Server.

But when I change to a recently created user I get a error window: \"VPN Connection Authentication failed.\".\nOS X 10.7.4\nVPN are set to L2TP.\nAre there any hidden settings pr anything I am missing?\n\nA: Have you somehow set things up so you need to add each new user explicitly to a security group to allow VPN? Check the Access tab in server admin to ensure all users are allowed to authenticate for VPN connections.\n\nA: Have a close look at /var/log/ppp/vpnd.log and see if you get any clues there.\nYou might also want to open /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.RemoteAccessServers.plist in your favourite plist editor and have a close look at that.\nI also assume you are creating the users as network users on your server using the GUI tool.\nDo you have any standard users working? If you create another administrator user do they have access?\n\nA: I also had one user which worked and one that would not authenticate.  The problem turned out to be a ',' (comma) in the password.  Setting up an identical user with a password that didn't have the comma corrected the problem.\n", "Q: Homebrew PATH error Mac OS X 10.6.8 So I've found this wildly helpful blog (http://blog.wyeworks.com/) and managed to muddle my way to step 5 (after leaving ridiculous comments after getting stuck on step one)\n    $ brew install memcached mysql postgresql\n\nI've gotten the \"your system is raring to brew\" message.

The Xserves do not have any operating system on them. What OS should I use for best results with Blender? Do I need OS X Server or can I get away with the client version or even Linux? \nI've never assembled a cluster, nor do I have any server experience to draw from.\nHardware:\n\n\n*\n\n*3 Xserves (specifically, the Xserve3,1 model)\n\n*5 CPU (20 cores total): 2.26 GHz quad core Intel Xeon 5500 series “Nehalem” processors (two CPUs each on two Xserves)\n\n*6 GB RAM on one of the dual CPU servers, 3 GB RAM on the remaining two Xserve\n\n*no Fiber Cards or Raid cards to complicate driver selection\n\n*no PCI cards\n\n*each server has a built-in NVIDIA GeForce GT 120 with a mini DisplayPort output and 256 MB of video RAM\n\n\nA: If you read the system requirements for Blender, it's pretty wide open. You could run Windows XP or newer, Mac OS X version 10.5 or newer and of course you could run Linux or perhaps even FreeBSD.\nSo, it's really your call which OS is easiest for you to maintain. For free (or pretty near to free) you could get a used copy of Snow Leopard or Leopard for probably $15 or even call Apple or go to an Apple store with the serial numbers and see what OS was shipped with those Macs. You might have to pay a shipping fee, but they will mail you replacement DVD for the OS.\nYou certainly don't need server for this software (reading the wiki linked in the question - it's clear the software handles all the clustering needed as long as all the devices are on the same network and can talk).\nIt depends on how expensive your time and what OS you like best to run and install. Mac is clearly the easiest since all the drivers you need will be vetted and ready to go. Once you have the software installed and running - should you find in discussions with the blender community that another OS handles a specific task better - you could always jump ship to that OS later.\nLooking over the Xserve specs, you might not be able to run 10.5 but unless you have a big reason to not upgrade - I'd run the latest client version of Mac OS that will run on that hardware.\n", "Q: Why does sudo ask for a password in terminal?

Is there a way to make sudo not ask for a password when you're logged in as the an admin anyway?\n\nA: sudo su asks for a password on my system. Did you run another sudo command before the sudo su? Once you've run sudo and entered your password, it doesn't require a password again for a period of time.\n\nA: You can just modify following lines in /etc/sudoers :\n# Members of the admin group may gain root privileges\n%admin ALL=(ALL) ALL\n\n# Allow members of group sudo to execute any command\n%sudo  ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL\n\nto\n# Members of the admin group may gain root privileges\n%admin ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL\n\n# Allow members of group sudo to execute any command\n%sudo  ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL\n\n\nA: sudo will always want a password once, but just set a crazy long timeout -- and note that it is specified in minutes:\nDefaults env_reset,timestamp_timeout=60\n", "Q: TextEdit key bindings modified in DefaultKeyBinding.dict stopped working I have customized text editing bindings in ~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict but they all stopped working in TextEdit.app when I upgraded to Lion. They still work fine in other Cocoa apps like Safari.\nThe system default bindings like ^F for moveForward: work as usual.\nHas anyone else who uses DefaultKeyBinding.dict noticed this? Is there a way to fix it or any other way of customizing the key bindings in TextEdit?\n\nA: The problem was that I had moved the actual DefaultKeyBinding.dict file somewhere else for version-control purposes and symlinked to it.\nMost apps were loading the file through the symlink, but TextEdit (and, it turns out, a couple other apps that I thought just didn't support key bindings) must do something different and didn't see it.\nSo, oops, lesson learned. Don't symlink your system configuration files.\n\nA: I had the same problem myself with symlinking this file, but I didn't want to give in to this limitation, so I created a git pre-commit hook to update ~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict whenever my version was committed.\nHere is the code (for Git):\n#!/bin/bash\n\n\nif [[ $(git diff --cached --name-only | grep '.configurations/DefaultKeyBinding.dict' | wc -l) -eq 1 ]]; \n\nthen\n   FILE_PATH_IN_LIBRARY=~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict\n   BASE_DIR=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)\n   FILE_PATH_IN_SCM=${BASE_DIR}/.configurations/DefaultKeyBinding.dict\n\n   NORMAL=$(tput sgr0)\n   BRIGHT=$(tput bold)\n   GREEN=$(tput setaf 2)\n\n   printf \"${BRIGHT}${GREEN}The file <%s> was modified, updating %s${NORMAL}\\n\" $FILE_PATH_IN_SCM $FILE_PATH_IN_LIBRARY\n\n   cp $FILE_PATH_IN_SCM $FILE_PATH_IN_LIBRARY\nfi\n\nTo use it all you need to do is replace FILE_PATH_IN_SCM=${BASE_DIR}/.configurations/DefaultKeyBinding.dict with the location of the file in your Git Repository.\nIf you never created a git hook before (this was my first) - you need to place this code in:  \n<your-git-repo>/.git/hooks/pre-commit\n\nDon't forget to run chmod +x <your-git-repo>/.git/hooks/pre-commit to make it executable.\nAfterwards every commit involving this file will show something like:\nThe file </Users/myuser/.scripts/.configurations/DefaultKeyBinding.dict> was modified, updating /Users/myuser/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict\n\n", "Q: When will Finder use large amount of memory? Sometimes I see the iMac with 4GB of RAM having a few MB of swap file only, and after I left for a few hours and come back, the swap file is 2.7GB.\nLooking into the Activities Monitor, the Finder is using 796MB.  How can it use so much memory -- could it be due to some \"Search\" that was left over in a Finder window?\nI then chose File -> Close All (by pressing down the Option key while clicking File, and closed all Finder windows, only that it still won't close but just hidden, and looks like the only way is to reboot.  How can this situation be prevented?\n\nA: Removing 1k screenshots and images from the desktop reduced Finder's RAM usage from 1.5G+ to 220 MB instantly without relaunch.\n\nA: This  inconvenience is caused by a finder prefs entry:\n\"show in new window: all my files\"\nthis is consuming too much mem. Select a different folder and all is fine\n\nA: I can't say much about preventing this, but there is no need to reboot.

If mounted on the desktop of a recent MacOSX System (eg. 10.5.8 to 10.7) typically files with data in the resource fork (font files, aliases, text clippings, icon files) are displayed as empty files in the finder. Fortunately the data seems not to be lost finally (see the results below). I could retrieve the resource forks separated as files with the prefix \"._\".\nIs there any known method to recombine/restore those separated hidden resource forks automatically with the main data to regular old style\" macintosh files for a whole disk? \nMy results:\nCopying the files back to disk with the finder via drag & drop does not solve the problem.\nCopying the files via terminal with the \"cp -r [source] [destination]\" option has neither a success.\nUsing the alternative \"cpmac\" command instead of \"cp2 has also no positive result.\nNow if I use the \"cp -r -p [source] [destination]\" option, I get errors with some permission issues, but I find files with the same basenames but a prefix of \"._\" on the destination disk. These files seem to contain regular font file resource fork data.\nThe logged errors were for each file:\ncp [sourcefilepathwithprefix] : could not copy extended attributes to [destinationfilepathwithprefix]\nwhere prefix is \"._\"&[filename]\nAnnother minor issue is that the filenames contain \"German umlauts\" that were replaced with underscores. I cannot figure out if there is any retrievable information there to restore the original encoding.\nI seems that the originally intended session containing the relevant hybrid mapping (HFS filesystem) for Apple Extensions was either lost or is now unreadable. \n\nA: If the resource forks are available under the names you're describing, here's a way to recombine them:\ncp -a /source/filename /destination/filename\ndd if=/source/._filename of=/destination/filename/..namedfork/rsrc\n\nThis will still not copy over the type/creator and other Finder metadata, but it will copy over the resource fork.\n", "Q: Maximize current window completely to hide background in Macbook While working on chrome/firefox/finder, I open several windows. Each window has some leftover blank space on right side. This is a huge problem while panning the page using the blue scroll bar.

I saw this for in Firefox with the 'inspect' feature (for HTML/CSS); I don't expect it to work for every application because of the variety of programming languages and custom classes. \n\nA: You can use a usability tool from Apple to see the structure of most user interfaces; try the Apple developer tool Accessibility Inspector. I believe it will do what you need.\nThe latest Xcode download may not include this tool as standard. You may need to download an additional package to find this tool.\n\nA: I've not come across anything of this sort, howwever the only solution I could think of would be to view the app's package contents and find the NIB files, of which there can be just a few or hundreds, dependant on the app in question.\nUsing a tool such as NIB Decompiler (although I've never personally used it) to then view the decompiled NIB within InterfaceBuilder/Xcode.

My iPhone 4 (going on 19 months of love) has recently started having a bit of an issue knowing the percentage of its battery it has remaining.  I will be using it and it will jump from 31% to 19% and pop up that annoying \"Low Battery\" notification.  A few moments after I dismiss it, the percentage jumps back up to 27%. This happens at least ten times, reliably, before it starts hitting 11% and then I know it was \"real\" and it needs charging soon. This feels like a NiCad issue… I know we've advanced past those days.\nSo my question is: how can I force a calibration of the percentage counter on iPhone 4?  Alternatively, and I don't know that I would like this even if it is possible (I doubt it is), can I disable the \"Low Battery\" notification?  It is excessively annoying when it pops up ten times over the course of thirty minutes. \n\nA: To recalibrate your iPhones battery, you should:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the iPhone until it shuts off due to low battery.\n\n*Charge it, without interruptions, to full charge (100%).\n\n*Reset the iPhone by Holding Home and the Power buttons at the same time. Ignore the Slide to Power off,  and let the iPhone restart itself.\n\n\nAnd for the notifications, as far as I know, no such thing can be achieved without jailbreaking. Cydia's app LowPowerBanner, for instance, should do the trick, though. \n", "Q: Is it possible to install Linux packages on OS X? I know that the Mac commandline is very similar to that of Linux operating systems, so it would be nice to use some features of Linux in my Mac, specially installing Linux packages. For example, in Linux we can install a package by simply typing sudo apt-get install \"package name\" at the prompt. Is it possible to do something like this on Mac?\n\nA: Yes, the open-source package ecosystem has expanded over the lifetime of macOS (neé Mac OS X). There are three main ones:\n\n*\n\n*Homebrew is the most active and stable, and should be your first choice for common libraries and apps. (It's based on community-maintained recipes written in Ruby.)\n\n*MacPorts is a long-lived and also popular system. It tends support a greater variety of systems (old and new) as well as software versions. MacPorts recipes are written in Tcl.\n\n*Fink is one of the oldest mac package managers and tries to emulate apt-get. I don't know anyone personally who's used Fink in the last decade.\n\nFinally, if you're looking for a more experimental and configurable package manager primarily aimed at developing scientific software, Spack is a great option. (Disclaimer: I'm a maintainer of the project.)\n\nA: Yes, it is possible to install and run a variety of UNIX applications on OS X. There are a few solutions out there, my choice and recommendation is Homebrew. I've found other solutions to be overly complex and unwieldy.\n\nA: Did you take a look at MacPorts?\n", "Q: Static IP for a adhoc wifi network Do you know if it's possible to give a static IP when creating a ad-hoc network on OS X? \n\nA: Of course, to actually do much in ad-hoc mode you even have to setup static IP addresses.\nJust start the ad-hoc network, then in System Preferences -> Network \"Click the lock to make changes\" and then click \"Advanced\".

It uses an evidence-based approach to determining where you are and, once your location criteria passes a certain confidence threshold, executes actions for you based on the confidence that you're \"in that location\".\nIt's pretty cool.\nOne of the evidence sources it supports is current power source. And its evidence source support is all based around event-driven sources.\nAnd it's open source.\nAnd free.\nYou can set it up to run an AppleScript (or a shell script) for you when ever the power source changes or just when it changes in one direction.\n\nA: I understand you do not want to use any third party applications.

I've been a Mac user for a few years now. Thinking about if it would be a good idea to set up a Mac for my parents, I came to think of the awesome feature of System Restore in Windows where making a System Restore point once a day would make it really easy to roll back any mistakes or installed software that made the computer not work well.\nIs there anything like it, perhaps a third party application or some cool github project, for Mac OS X?\n\nA: So far as I know there isn't a nice automated way to provide the benefits of System Restore as it is implemented on Windows. For all its utility for Windows users, though, System Restore can't be used to backup/restore individual files & whatnot at the whim of the user - that requires a separate backup system.\nTime Machine on OS X, on the other hand, can provide for the backup/restore of deleted documents, folders, etc, and can be used to restore an entire hard drive in the event of a crashed or munged drive. I've used this function a few times, twice on a very important server, and once on my own machine, with great success.\n\nMy Mom's new Lion iMac is setup with an inexpensive external 500 GB USB hard drive and Time Machine is running like clockwork. My Mom knows to check the Time Machine menu every day to make sure it is backing up. She's even started to recover files on her own now, without needing to call Tech Support (me).\nTime Machine was also very helpful in migrating her creaky Leopard Mac mini to the new iMac a few months ago. Instead of hooking the old & new Macs together via Ethernet cable, I simply ran a Time Machine backup on the old machine, shut it down, connected the USB drive to the new iMac, and the Migration Assistant app took care of the rest. Her new iMac was up and running in a little more than an hour.\n\nA non-Time Machine solution would be using Carbon Copy Cloner or SuperDuper! to back up the Mac to an external hard drive on a regular basis. This would allow for a mass restore of the drive's contents.\nAnother non-Time Machine solution would be to boot from the System Install DVD (pre-Lion)\nor an bootable external HD (Lion & after) and create a restorable disk image. After converting the image to ASR format, Disk Utility can be used to restore the disk image.\n\nA: May be I'm replying too late here. But I would like to share a good restore software for Mac OS. I'm Deep Freeze user. It is a Mac OS restore software by Faronics.I have installed it before 2 years on my Mac. It is protecting my Mac OS configuration since. Easy to use and simple to install. \n\nA: Cmd-R to the rescue.\nJust hold down Cmd-R during startup and OS X Recovery springs into action. It lets you choose from common utilities: You can run Disk Utility to check or repair your hard drive, erase your hard drive and reinstall a fresh copy of OS X, or restore your Mac from a Time Machine backup. You can even use Safari to get help from Apple Support online. And if OS X Recovery encounters problems, it will automatically connect to Apple over the Internet.\n", "Q: Trackpad switch pages with 3 fingers By default the Back/Next gesture works with two fingers (in e.g. Safari) on the trackpad. Now it often happens to me when scrolling through iframes (with two fingers) I accidentally activate the back gesture. Now I changed it in settings to 3 fingers, but the animation is gone, and in Safari it's not anymore like dragging the page before from the left to center but like hitting the back-button (without animation)... Is it possible to use the real 2-fingers gesture with 3-fingers?\n\nA: No.\nAll you can have is to activate both the 2-finger and the 3-finger gestures. They work differently, though.\nWith two fingers you scroll the page to the sides revealing the page \"below\" it or the page \"above\" it according to the tag history.\nWith three fingers you just tell the browser to \"go back\" (swipe left) or \"go forward\" (swipe right) without any animation at all. At least this 3-finger gesture is consistent in many apps, including Finder.\n\nA: If you download a program. But you should use 2 fingers. This is because you can use 3 fingers to move between desktop screens. I hope you take advantage of that awesome feature. you know mission control and screens\n", "Q: Should I buy an iPod touch in Canada in July or wait 'til September and buy it in Europe? My title is pretty clear: I'm going in Canada for a trip with my father in July and I wonder if I should buy a new iPod touch there or wait until the new one comes out around September and buy in Europe? The 8 GB version costs 199€ (roughly 256 Canadian dollars) in Europe and 199 Canadian dollars in Canada (roughly 154€).\nI'm going to use it mainly as a gaming and Internet device. I might listen to music with it from time to time but I won't take the 32 GB version only to have my entire music collection on it.\nSo, given my use of it, will the new version be worth the extra 45€ (assuming the price won't change)?\n\nA: The new model (if one comes out; it's not necessarily certain that one will) will be better. Will it be 45€ better? I don't know, and that's something only you can decide. If you don't need the extra disk space, the 8 GB model should be sufficient (despite what @comradsky's answer says, the internals of the 4th-gen touches aren't any different between the size models except the internal storage space.\nAll in all, I have to say the same thing I always say when it comes to buying Apple products: if you need it, buy it. If you wait, there's always the possibility that they won't release a new model when you thought they would, so you buy the old model, and then they release the new model a month after you thought they would.\nAlso: consider looking at the refurbished store on Apple's website. There are (from time to time) fairly good deals on current- or previous-gen items. \n\nA: Here's an awesome site for recommending when is a good time to buy all Apple products (including iPod Touch)\nhttp://buyersguide.macrumors.com/\nRight now the iPod Touch is in \"Buy only if you need it mode\".   In another month it could be \"Don't buy\" territory.\nI would wait if I were you.   \n\nA: The price won't change. And, yes, it is definitely worth it. You should get the 32 Gig but thats your preference - it has a better CPU. I need to add a picture to my question, but to do that I need 10 reputation. \n", "Q: Using the home (house) button in Logitech K400 keyboard I've just bought the Logitech K400 keyboard/trackpad combo. The volume buttons above the keyboard works just fine. But the home button (that has a small \"house\" icon) doesn't do anything on OS X Lion.\nIs there a way I can use it to display Launchpad? I've tried using System Preferences to use it as a \"hot key\" but it didn't register any key press there.\n\nA: With my S530 I had to install the Logitech Control Center for OS X in order to configure the custom keys. Once you install that, you'll see a control center entry in your System Preferences panel:\n\nBefore you can assign a shortcut to the Home key on the keyboard, you need to make a keyboard shortcut for Launchpad as there is none by default. Open System Preferences and go to Keyboard settings. Click the Keyboard Shortcuts tab and select Launchpad & Dock. Make sure 'Show Launchpad' is checked and then double click over the area that shows the shortcut to assign a new shortcut (I used Alt-Cmd-L in the screen shot). If you can't assign a shortcut try unchecking and re-checking the Show Launchpad setting:\n\nNow enter the Logitech Control Center, select your device and click the Configure button:\n\nClick the Keys icon at the top to configure custom keys on the keyboard. Find the Home key in the list. Set the 'Assigned action' for the Home key to 'Keystroke. And configure the keystroke issued to be the one you assigned to Launchpad above. In my case it would be Alt-Cmd-L.\n\n\nA: The K400 is not recognized on mac by logitech software. I think you need to rely on 3rd party things to customize behaviour. One tip I found out was that you can turn off touch to click by holding the blue FN key, and click the left mouse button on the trackpad.\nHope you can find a solution.\n", "Q: Where is the \"Home Computer\" information that prevents syncing with other libraries stored on an iPod Classic? The iPod Classic (and maybe others?) refuses to sync with more than one iTunes library at a time. This is very frustrating when I keep my music on multiple computers.\nWhere is the \"Home Computer\" information stored on the iPod? Is it a file? If so where in the iPod filesystem does it live?\n\nA: I've been able to do this successfully suing rsync to copy my ~/Music/iTunes/ directory from my \"Home Computer\" to other computers. I don't remember exactly where the magic is, but it is within iTune's metadata.\nOnce you sync the first time you don't ever need to sync again. The libraries can diverge after that and your iPod will still consider them both to be the same library.\n", "Q: Why doesn't iBooks save my place between the iPhone and iPad? Background: I finally bought a fiction book to read on my iOS devices. It's Redshirts by John Scalzi. I bought it from Apple. It was supposed to be DRM-free but wasn't. So the author got Macmillan to send a DRM-free version to anyone who sent a copy of their purchase confirmation. So I deleted the Apple Store version and replaced with the DRM-free epub file.\nProblem: My understanding was that when I stop reading on the iPad I could later pick up the iPhone and have the book open up to the place where I stopped on the iPad. But this isn't happening. I've tried placing a bookmark when I finish reading but it doesn't change anything.\nIs my original assumption incorrect?\nSync Bookmarks and Sync Collections are both on in iBooks settings on the iPad and iPhone.\nI haven't migrated from MobileMe to iCloud yet (still waiting for Bare Bones to get Yojimbo to sync over iCloud). Is that a problem? \nUpdate\nI switched over to iCloud and syncing still doesn't happen. My guess is it's because I have two Apple IDs the one I use to make iTunes purchases is not the .mac Apple ID that became my iCloud account. \n\nA: iBooks uses your iTunes account to sync bookmarks and places.  My wife and I share an account for app and book purchases, so I setup a separate iCloud account for her thinking that her bookmarks would go there.  It turns out that I'm wrong, and it's the iTunes store account that stores it.  I wish iCloud was the storage location, since the other app settings and backups do work using separate accounts.  \n\nA: Yeah it is an iCloud / mobile me issue. What you could do is set up a free iCloud account and then perhaps never use it if you do not want multiple accounts, but it would allow you to test it.\n\nA: If ever you have syncing problems, I find that turning sync off and back on solves the problem most times these days. I had this same problem (with an ePub file I purchased outside of Apple). All I did was open iBooks on my Mac (where I was having the syncing problem since I'd done reading on my iPhone but my place wasn't saved when I returned to my Mac) and hit the checkbox next to Sync, on the General tab.\n", "Q: Update from 10.5.8 to Lion with the Lion USB stick I bought this small OS X Lion USB stick for $69 today. The guy in the Apple Store said that I can simply upgrade from my 10.5.8 to Lion with this thing. Well I plugged it in and hello, I'm not able to upgrade.\nSo question is: Can I even use this thing? I just have this stick, no serial, no nothing. Just this stick http://store.apple.com/us/product/MD256Z/A.\n\nA: I know you can do a fresh install on a clean system, so you could try this: copy your existing install to an external drive (using Carbon Copy Cloner or SuperDuper!), wipe the internal drive, do a clean install of Lion, then use Migration Assistant to copy your old system onto the fresh Lion install.\n\nA: The Lion USB drive you bought works to upgrade a Mac with Snow Leopard (10.6) or you can of course use it to install Lion onto a bare (erased) drive.\nMost people will make a back up (using the bootable USB drive to run Disk Utility) to an external drive or alternately - install Lion onto an external drive.\nAt that point you can hand migrate things or see if the Migration Assistant will help to move your documents and the Apps that are compatible with Lion to the new OS.\nSince you just bought an Apple product, you get 90 days of phone support - so you can call AppleCare for help step by step if you prefer. The only catch would be if your Mac doesn't meet the minimum requirements for Lion in which case you might take it back and return it if you don't want to spend money on whatever needs updating to run Lion.\n\nA: Since the Apple Lion page points out that Snow Leopard is a requirement for the upgrade, the Apple Store employee should've pointed this out before you bought the Lion USB stick. If you're not willing to upgrade to Snow Leopard, @CajunLuke's answer would be helpful.\nThere are two paths to obtaining Snow Leopard. If you're currently a MobileMe user, this article notes that Apple is offering free upgrades to Snow Leopard to encourage user migration to iCloud. One other alternative is to purchase the Snow Leopard upgrade. Either way, install Snow Leopard first, update the OS, and then install upgrade to Lion.\n\nA: Are you sure your Mac meets the minimum system requirements?\n\n\n*\n\n*Macs with an Intel Core 2 Duo, Intel Core i3, Intel Core i5, Intel\nCore i7, or Xeon processor;\n\n*At least 2GB of RAM; Mac OS X 10.6.6 or later (Mac OS X 10.6.8 is\nrecommended);\n\n*At least 7 GB of free hard drive space.\n\n\nAny Mac with a Core Duo CPU will not run Mac OS X 10.7 Lion - basically any of the 2006-era first generation of ICBMs (Intel-chip based Mac).\n", "Q: Making all application windows stay fullscreen on relaunch I usually have 4+ fullscreen windows open whenever I use Xcode 4. When I quit Xcode, and reopen it, only one or two of the windows open as fullscreen, and the rest all open in a single desktop as normal windows. (I think the behavior is the same with Chrome and probably other apps to.)\nIs there anyway to fix this?\n\nA: I haven't tried this yet, but did a quick search and there is a free add-on called Maximizer available.\nIt may not be build into Lion yet (as far as I know) but this will get you close for what you want :-)\nhttp://chpwn.com/apps/maximizer.html\n", "Q: Returning iMac to iSpot when bought from online shop I bought an iMac from the online Apple Store and now, 2 days after purchase, it broke down. I want to return it/exchange it, but would like to avoid the tremendous waiting time, as this used to be my working tool (I work at home) and make the exchange at an iSpot, is this possible or must I bear that waiting time?\n\nA: You should be able to get any Mac repaired (including warranty repair) at any Apple Store or Apple Authorized repair shop, regardless of where you purchased the machine. \nIf you're actually looking to return the Mac, you should call Apple Customer Support to see if you can return it at the store.\n", "Q: Is it possible to receive SMS with the Messages beta for OS X? I feel like I've read 7 or 8 different articles on the Messages beta, but I'm not seeing my question's answer.\nSo, is it possible with Messages for OS X, to receive SMS texts sent to my phone number? \n\nA: No. Messages beta works like it does on the iPad and iPod Touch. You can only message other Apple iOS 5 (or Messages) users.\n\nA: To avoid confusion, we might be speaking about two things here:\n\n\n*\n\n*SMS, MMS - which are a GSM network feature, not a phone feature\n\n*iMessages - have separate notifications and format, but they look like ordinary SMS to you. They are not real SMS, but are working between iPhones, iPads, iPods and Macs. If Wi-Fi is unavailable, iMessages will be sent over cellular data. Carrier cellular data fees might apply.\n\n\n\nis it possible with Messages for OS X, to receive SMS texts sent to my phone number? \n\n\n\n*\n\n*For SMS: If you OS X operating system have been paired with the iPhone, which has this SIM-card with the phone number, you'll be getting messages on your Mac in Messages App as well, and you can even reply back. If no phone bound - then SMS will be not available.\n\n*For iMessages: this functionality will work with your Messages App on Mac, if your internet connection (cable/WiFi) is available, as it is not requiring carrier cellular network. It works between iPhones, iPads, iPods and Macs. It might reference not only your phone number, but Apple-ID (email) as a unique addressee identifier.\n\n\nA: Yeah it's like bassplayer7 said - it is because iMessage goes through Apple's own network and the normal sms go through the carrier's network. \nSince the iPad and iPod Touch do not allow for the carrier part, they are capable of receiving iMessages and so it is the same for the Mac.\n\nA: Since SMS is a byproduct of the mobile telephone technology GSM it isn't possible.\nSMS needs a phone number as the receiver, and that phone must eventually be connected to the network to receive it. The Mac has no GSM connection.\nThere could be services that receive and forward SMS to you, but I'm not aware of any, and even then, you wouldn't receive these in iMessage.\n", "Q: Cannot change owner and group of file mounted disk image I have an external disk which (for other reasons) is formatted using FAT32. On that disk I have created a sparse bundle image formatted using HFS extended (journaled).

Attempting to change the owner will not produce an error message, but simply fail silently.\nIn the Finder, select the mounted disk corresponding to the sparse image in question and Get Info (⌘I). At the bottom of the pane that opens, see if it looks like this: (i.e. the Ignore ownership on this volume box is checked)\n\nIf you uncheck that box, you should get the behavior you seek.\n", "Q: Can I restart my Mac remotely via screen sharing if the screen shows only linen? I am currently in Norway.  My Mac mini is in my apartment in Australia.  I can access screen sharing via Back To My Mac.  It connects fine, but the screen has only linen - no menu bar, no dock, no anything else.  I am fairly sure that is what is actually on the screen and that it isn't a problem with the connection or anything like that (it's happened once before while I was sitting in the same room...)\nI know the system is responsive because the one other thing that can poke through my router is the Transmission web interface, and that works just fine.  (Unfortunately I seem to have neglected to forward a port for ssh...)\nIs there any way I can reboot or otherwise regain full use of the system via the limited screen sharing access that I have?\n\nA: So apparently you can use the Back To My Mac infrastructure to get to SSH even if there's no port open on the router in front of the relevant Mac:\nFind your iCloud account number by executing this command in terminal:\ndns-sd -E\n\nExample output\nLooking for recommended registration domains:\nTimestamp     Recommended Registration domain\n23:45:15.660  Added     (More)               local\n23:45:15.660  Added                          icloud.com\n                                             - > btmm\n                                             - - > members\n                                             - - - > 123456789\n\n(Make a note of the number on the last line, in this case 123456789 (this is just an example).\nThe hostname you need to use for ssh is <computer's local hostname>.<number above>.members.btmm.icloud.com.

(You need a keyboard with an eject key.)\n\nA: If you want to remotely restart the machine without having to specify the user then you can specify an input file in the form of a plist. Do the following steps on the computer that you are remoting into:\n\n\n*\n\n*First you need to create a plist file that will have your\ncredentials, open up a terminal window and paste the following:\ntouch ~/.restart.plist.

On a couple of servers I work on, despite having access to edit files and all else, there is the occasional need to gain elevated privileges (like running sudo) with the file to actually save the changes.\nThat said I like working with my files in Coda 2 and not the Terminal directly. So is there either a way to sudo the file open through the explorer when viewing the remote files, or is there a way to trigger a file to open through the built-in terminal in Coda 2 so I can make the edits, save, and move on. \nCurrently when I double click on a file to open it, if I would need elevated privileges, the file will open only in a read-only state. \n\nA: No, it can not.  Coda 2, Coda, and Transmit all allow you to SFTP into a box, but when you try to access a file that is not in your user's accessible range, you have to log out and then log back in as a user who can.\nI use Transmit and Coda 2 constantly and just have made it to where I am only signing in as root because I ended up having to log in as different users to access one file and then a different file.\nI wish there was another way around it, like being able to have Transmit, Coda, or Coda 2 push some kind of command to the server or something but it isn't possible in any of the Apps current states.  I would highly recommend doing a feature request to them, I can't see how we would have been the only people who have ever wanted this.\nI would recommend trying to contact them through their twitter account.  They are pretty cool guys and have responded to things like this before on Twitter.\nhttp://twitter.com/#!/panic\nI know it wasn't the answer you were probably looking for but I hope it helps.\n\nA: An \"open as sudo\" command has still not been implemented in Coda2 so I have been using the following workaround to be able to edit a file that belongs to another user or root without having to use something as painful as vi\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal connection in a tab in the SFTP connection.\n\n*Run a chown command on the file to the user you can login as (this user must have sudo privs). Be sure to note who original user was.\nsudo chown your-user-name path/to/file\n\n*Navigate to the file and click to open it, edit what you need and click save and close the file.\n\n*Go back to the terminal window and chown it back to the original user:\nsudo chown original-user-name path/to/file\nObviously this is not the ideal situation, but it does make it so you can use all the awesomeness of Coda to edit the file instead of vi or other editors built into the command line.\n", "Q: Rename mail account? I hope this is not too obvious, but I would like to know if this is possible.  I made an email account without renaming it.  So it has the boring name Exchange.  How can I rename this email account on my iPad without deleting and re adding it?  I would rather not type all that info in again.  \n\nA: Go to Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars > Tap your Exchange account (for you, it will likely say Exchange) > Tap on your exchange email address (i.e. daniel@example.com) > scroll down to Description (past Username and Password), then enter the new name in there.\n\nA: I successfully changed the name others see when I email them (from my iPad Air 2) by putting the name I want them to see into Contacts and making sure to give that name the email address I want it to have.  I don't understand why it works but it does!  \nThis may only work on the iPad (possibly just the iPad Air 2), so if you want to change your 'from name' on other devices i.e. your main computer, you'll have to do whatever it takes on those devices.\n", "Q: How to set \"Input Sources\" for all users at the same time In Lion OSX, changing the keyboard layout \"Input Sources\" setting in the \"Language & Text\" only changes the setting for the current user.

I've used it myself, and it's pretty awesome. It gets rid of the repetitive lock screen and takes you straight back to whatever you were doing before.\n\nA: Apple didn't program a way to eliminate the “Slide to unlock” screen. Without jailbreaking the phone, you can't get around this preventative feature.\n(I guess the rationale behind this design is as a precaution against accidentally doing something unwanted while your phone sits in your pocket/purse/hand and the power button gets bumped. This also is how the lock screen is designed to work when the device is not powered off.)\nThe best you can do with a stock OS is to disable auto-locking in “Settings > General > Auto-Lock > Never”. However, whenever the phone is locked manually you will have to slide to unlock before using the device.\n", "Q: iPhone multitasking gestures On iPad, there are some useful multitasking gestures such as swipe between applications.\nHow do I enable multitasking gestures (a la iPad) on iPhone 4?\n\nA: iOS 4.3 beta had this feature.\nI used it and it wasn't that nice.  The all of your fingers toward the middle brings you home gesture was difficult to use at best.\nAs of right now, you have to jailbreak your device and install the Zephyr app from the BigBoss default repo.\nIt lets you configure how it works, which is a nice bonus.\n\nA: Unfortunately Apple hasn't given us these features on the iPhone, and I'm assuming it is because the screen is small enough that it would be a little awkward to fit four fingers on the screen.\nMaybe iOS 6?\n", "Q: iPhone screensaver Is there any way to get a real screensaver on iPhone?\nI realize this drains the battery fast, but that actually is no concern to me.\nHere's what I mean: after X minutes of no touch input, a pretty screensaver comes on and just goes until I touch the screen, at which point it instantly returns to where I was.\n\nA: You can't do this on any iOS device unless you jailbreak it.\nIf you do choose to jailbreak, then you can install various apps from Cydia such as ScreenSaver which will do what you want.\n", "Q: Does installing Xcode and it's mobile components slow down regular iTunes with iPhone syncing and performance? I haven't personally noticed any differences, but is there a toll on normal usage of iTunes and syncing it with your iPhone if you fit a developer profile by having Xcode on your system including relevant mobile components (Mobile Device Framework) that ask to be installed? I'm curious because during installation, iTunes is asked to be closed. I'm not part of the Developer Program yet and as such my phone is not yet marked as a development device.\n\nA: I have been a developer for little over a year and had have not noticed any slowing down since and because of Xcode - the only thing is that sometimes making backups takes a long time, if you do not backup your iOS device everyday - but I don't see that being related to Xcode.\n\nA: The short answer is no, it shouldn't. \nIt asks to quit iTunes because Xcode needs to install its own 'hook' to interact with iTunes. Quitting iTunes just reduces any risk as it gets installed. For example, one of the iTunes plist may be getting updated during install. \nAs with Jeff's answer, backups may take slightly longer because there may be more data on there, but I haven't even noticed this myself. \n", "Q: iphone WIFI behaviour I have setup a wifi network in a cafe. Some clients with iPhones have an issue. They connect to the network, then lock the screen and after 10 minutes (about) they unlock the screen. When they unlock the screen the iPhone is not connected to the wifi and they have to manually select the same wifi network and connect again.\nThis is strange because in other iPhones this doesn't happen.\nDoes anybody know the reason for this behavior?  \n\nA: When the iPhone locks (the screen turns off) it goes into power savings mode. Sometimes, because it does not always happen to mine, it re-connects to the wifi. \nNow if this is an Internet cafe, yes you will need to login again, because the router will assign a new IP address to them - which brings me to my next point.\nIf an iPhone disconnects from the network the router releases that IP address and other devices can take its place. When the iPhone then reconnects it needs a new address. Some iPhones do this and others don't - it may depend on how many devices are connecting at any given time to your set up.\nShort answer: nothing you can do about it - it's just the name of the game with wifi networks.\nIf however you have a regular device (say at home) you can assign it a dedicated IP address, but in an Internet cafe this is not relevant.\nHope this helps answering your question.\n", "Q: Blurry/aliased text on external LCD in Lion I have an external LCD hooked up to my MacBook Pro 5,5 running Lion.

Adding the -owners on option is (almost) equivalent to unchecking the checkbox in the image above:\n$ hdiutil attach -owners on testimage.sparsebundle/\n\nHowever, after unmounting and remounting the volume from Finder (or from the command line without the -owners on option), the checkbox is checked again.\nDoes anybody know how to make this change persistent using a command-line call?\n\nA: I found that both answers worked for enabling ownership in way that is remembered:\nsudo diskutil enableOwnership <diskname>s<slicenum>\n\nAnd:\nvsdbutil -a /Volume/<volname>\n\nHowever, the opposite is not true, at least on OS X 10.11.3:\nsudo diskutil disableOwnership <diskname>s<slicenum>\n\nAnd:\nvsdbutil -d /Volume/<volname>\n\nBoth temporarily change the state, but ownership is re-enabled next time I mount the volume. This appears to be a bug in the operating system. Fortunately I found a solution that works. Eject all external disks that you want to disable ownership for. Then delete the appropriate database using:\nsudo rm /var/db/volinfo.database\n\n\nA: Use vsdbutil to set it for a path instead of a physical drive:\nvsdbutil -a /Volume/Diskname\n\nAlthough the man page suggests it is deprecated, the man page for diskutil still refers to it and the mechanism appears to be based on Volume UUIDs not on physical disk/slice ids.\n\nA: You use diskutil for that. See diskutil(1) under enableOwnership and disableOwnership. Note that this setting is specific to a particular operating system installation, since it is stored in /var/db/volinfo.database. I.e., if you copy the disk image to a new computer the setting won't persist, but it does persist across reboots, mounts, umounts, etc. all on a single computer.\nUse diskutil to find the identifier, then change the option:\n$ diskutil list\n/dev/disk2\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:                            Disk Image             *41.0 MB    disk2\n$ sudo diskutil enableOwnership disk2\nFile system user/group ownership enabled\n\n", "Q: Is there a list of commands unique to the OS X terminal?

It shows 7000 songs.\nIs there any truth to this chart, or did eBay just goof?\n\nA: BestBuy says 1750 (Best Buy 4th Gen iPod Touch), so I think eBay just goofed.\nAccording to this answer (Yahoo Answers), the 8GB holds 1750. What's interesting is that, according to the Yahoo answer, the 32GB version stores 7000 songs, and it would make sense if eBay just got the two confused.\n", "Q: When using an second monitor, is it possible to move the cursor off both sides of the screen? For example, I have a MBP connected to an external monitor. I use both screens but hate the fact that I have to go all the way to the left side of the external monitor (which is huge) in order to go back to my primary screen. Say that I'm on my primary screen and I move my cursor off the left side of the screen, I'd like my cursor to appear on the right side of my external monitor. Also, if I moved my mouse off the right side of my primary screen I'd like my cursor to appear on the left side of my external screen. I'm sure that functionality isn't built into OSX, but are there third party products that do this?\n\nA: Yeah, sure. Use Wraparound (I haven't tried it, but it should do what you're asking). Download it here: http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/19599/wraparound.\n\nA: Wraparound does exactly what you are looking for, but it's worth noting for later readers what OS X will do without additional software:\n\nSay that I'm on my primary screen and I move my cursor off the left\n  side of the screen, I'd like my cursor to appear on the right side of\n  my external monitor.\n\nThis part you can do without adding Wraparound.  Go to:\nSystem Preferences > Displays > Arrangement\n\n\"Arrangement\" only displays when the second monitor is connected.  If \"Mirror Displays\" is unchecked, you will see two or more blue boxes.  The white horizontal bar at the top of one box represents the OS X menu bar, which is usually on your primary display (although you can move it to another display by dragging it there).\nBy clicking and dragging the boxes you can reposition the boxes relative to each other.  This lets you place the secondary display is to the left of the primary display, or along any edge other of that display.\nThis also allows you to position the secondary display higher or lower along each edge of the primary display, leaving corners open on the primary display for any Active Screen Corners that you have enabled in the Expose settings.\n", "Q: Upgrading my 3GS to iOS 5.1.1, I lost all my apps After backing up my iPhone 3GS and then updating to the new iOS 5.1.1, I lost all my apps and saved notes/data.

My computer is set up to require a login after its been put to sleep and it has a fairly complex password, so I'm not worried about anyone guessing it. The MacBook was stolen, and I'm wondering if there's a way for that person to access my files, or will they just have to wipe the drive (hopefully).\n\nA: As Kalamane's answer points out, unfortunately the thief can access your data very easily, as it sits on your disk unencrypted. It is unfortunately trivial to bypass OS X passwords by booting into single user mode.\nIt won't help now, but for the future, here are two tips that can help in case of laptop theft.\nFirst of all, if you're like me and carry your laptop almost everywhere (so the likelihood of it getting stolen/lost is relatively high), seriously consider Apple's FileVault 2. FileVault 2 encrypts your entire hard-drive, seamlessly. This means that you can still use your computer as normal (you won't even notice that FileVault is on), but in case it gets stolen, the attacker won't be able to read anything from the hard-drive without knowing your password.\nSecondly, enable the \"Find My Mac\" feature available in OS X Lion (go to Preferences - iCloud - Find My Mac). In case your laptop gets stolen, you will then be able to login to icloud.com from any computer, and see the last location where your MacBook has been on a map. You will also get the following interface, which you can use to remotely display a message on your Mac, wipe the Mac completely, or lock it:\n\n\nA: I'm sorry your MacBook was stolen.  That really sucks.\nSadly, there are numerous ways to read the data ranging from removing the drive or placing the Mac in target mode. Your password only protects things when the mac is booted into your unmodified OS.\nTo answer your question, Physical access is total access.\nIt would be trivial for someone to boot using a Linux LiveCD and mount your drive, thus accessing your files.  All they'd have to do to get past your sleep/password would be to hard power down the system.\nAdditionally, from the link above:\n\nMac OS X: Single User Mode\n\nTo boot a Mac into “Single User mode”, simply boot the computer and press Apple + S when blue first\n   shows up on the screen. Next, mount the harddrive, and either dump the\n   password and crack it with a tool like John the Ripper, or simply\n   overwrite the root password:\n# /sbin/mount -wu /\n# /sbin/SystemStarter\nTo dump the existing root password:\n# nidump passwd\nTo create a new root password:\n# passwd root\n\n\n", "Q: Software to losslessly optimize batches of image files I frequently work with large numbers of image files to be used in websites.\nI'm currently using Photoshop's 'Save for Web' tool to find the most efficient way to compress images, but that takes some time and isn't always perfect.\nI'd love to find a nice utility that can automatically go through my images and optimize each one.\nRequirements:\n\n\n*\n\n*Compression should be lossless.\n\n*Utility should be able to chug through a batch process automatically (i.e. without me interacting with it for each image).\n\n*Should support JPEGs* and PNGs, and ideally GIFs.\n\n\nThe app does not have to be free, as long as it's good.\n*By JPEG support I mean reducing file size without making the compression any more lossy than it already is (throwing out metadata, etc).\n\nA: ImageOptim?\n\nImageOptim optimizes images — so they take up less disk space and load faster — by finding best compression parameters and by removing unnecessary comments and color profiles.

I've been using Synk from Decimus off and on for a few years to sync files between two Macs.\nSince upgrading to Lion, Sync 6 has started hanging during the process of scanning before the sync. Upgrading to version 7 is $45 which seems like a lot. \nIs there another program out there that does the same thing? I don't need it to sync the contents of files that have been changed on both computers, just copy the most recent version of a file (or a new file) from one to the other. I'd also like to be able to have it ignore files with a specific Finder label.\n\nA: If you can use command-line tools, try rsync.\nFor the label part, see Rsync filter: \"OS X label\".\n\nA: I'm not sure how comfortable you are using Unix tools, but Unison should meet your needs (and it's open source). I don't know how well it supports Finder labels though.\n\nA: I decided to pay the $45 for the Synk update. I figured it would take more than an hour or two to try to get rsync to work with two-way syncing. It was worth $45 to me to not have to spend that time and to use a solution I already know will work.\n\nA: For a two way sync there is a free application with a GUI named Carbon Copy Cloner. Although Carbon Copy Cloner is a visual interface around rsync, you don't need to have rsync installed as it is already included in the software package.\nTo sync with a remote Mac, there is the option to choose \"Another Macintosh\" as destination/target. Such a remote sync requires the installation of a 143 KB package on both the local and the remote Mac.\nThe sync is on demand/upon request or can be scheduled. Though my guess is you need to create 2 jobs: one for each sync direction.\n\nA: Another sync solution is the $11.99 Apple App Store only application named FolderWatch.\nRemote sync is unfortunately only done over AFP protocol. In other words you need to enable file sharing on the remote Mac.\nThe benefit is that the FolderWatch synchronization is done almost real-time. The application needs to be installed on both computers to synchronize in both directions. \n\nA: I use Chronosync for this.  You can schedule to sync weekly, daily, or hourly with any frequency you want.  You can sync one way or two way.  It can automatically send you email alerts when things don't work.  It runs quietly as a service in the background.  It's total automation, which works for me.  Totally worth it's $40 cost.\n", "Q: How can I turn an iPod touch into a functional mobile telephone? Considering that the iPhone is three times more expensive than the iPod touch and that the iPod touch is much thinner than the iPhone, it would be quite neat to use an iPod touch as to send and receive phone calls.\nWhat would need to be done to enable an iPod Touch to send and receive phone calls (either Wi-Fi only or better interfacing to cellular data through an accessory)? \n\nA: There are three steps that would need to be completed to enable an iPod Touch to act as a mobile telephone.\nFirst, it would need to make phone calls. The answers to this question document how to place phone calls using an iPod Touch and VOIP. I personally have used Talkatone, and find that it does work, but has some substantial lags, particularly at the beginning of the conversation.\nSecond, it would need to receive phone calls. (Note that this is a key difference between using an iPod Touch as a mobile telephone, as asked in your title, and a calling device, as asked in the body of the first version of your question!) This is a much more difficult prospect, as presumably you would want the device to be able to receive calls at any time, and not just when a particular app is running. It would appear that the program Skype is available for the iPod Touch and could be used to make and receive phone calls.\nFinally, unlike the iPhone, the iPod Touch can only communicate with the rest of the world when it is connected to a WiFi network. A mobile hotspot like the MiFi carried with you could give the iPod Touch steady access to a WiFi network.\nAll that said, you'll end up paying for Skype in and out on top of paying for the data plan for the MiFi. It might be simpler and not a whole lot more expensive to just go with an actual iPhone.\nIn other words, it can be done to make an iPod Touch more like an iPhone, but that doesn't mean you'd want to, besides as a proof of concept.\n\nA: On the other hand. If you are trying to save money on your phone bill AND have a fast stable wifi connection at home and work, you may try the following solution.\nUse the TouchTone App with Google Voice or use Skype. Whichever one you have a preference for.  Skype can do video, but TouchTone will also send and receive text. There really isn't any reason you can't use both, but you will have two different phone numbers.\nBuy one of those disposable prepaid phone. (yes, you will be carrying two devices) Those can be as cheap to use as $10 for 30 minutes which expires in 3 months if you don't use it. If you don't talk a lot between wifi connections, you will not be using many minutes.\nNow forward to the number of your disposable phone if Skype or TouchTone doesn't answer. \nNEVER give out the phone number for the disposable phone. And HIDE the caller ID from the disposable phone.\nThere you go. For as cheap as $40 a year in phone charges if you're careful.\nIf you talk a lot between WiFi.. this may not be for you. But if you're the sneaky college student type, if you can get your parents to shell out $80 a month for the phone bill, you come out WAY ahead. Like $920 a year. But don't do that, its mean.\n\nA: Unlock your iPod, and then you'll have the ability to turn your iPod touch into a Mobile phone. But you have to be careful unlocking, because it could damage the iPod if your not knowing what your doing.\n", "Q: Can you use an iMac backup for a MacBook Pro?

It seems like it would be possible given that all it really backs up is the software, files, etc., and not the actual system drivers or anything.\n\nA: Yes, you can. The system, cache, or any hardware-specific data such as drivers are not backed up. Even if they were, any installation of OS X contains the necessary drivers for any supported Mac model by that version of the system (with the exception of printer drivers IIRC, which are not included to save space and will be downloaded).\n", "Q: How can i retrieve all my contacts from iCloud to a new iPhone - I have no back up on a PC My iPhone has had problems and they have had to delete all its contents - addresses, etc.\nEven if I have no back up on a PC - how can I download my contacts and apps from iCloud to the repaired iPhone.\n\nA: If your contacts were being synced to iCloud (and if you set up a new iCloud account, I am pretty sure this is on by default), all you have to do is set up the iCloud account on the repaired phone. \nThis is separate than the backup to iCloud too. If that was setup, it may also contain contacts on a restore, but they should have been backed up to iCloud with the contact sync feature that is part of iCloud.\n", "Q: Cannot read internal hard drive My MacBook Pro (Mac OS X Snow Leopard) would not start up and the apple service guy suggest me to take the internal hard drive and back up the data to another computer using an external hard drive adaptor. \nI did that and connect the \"Externalized internal hard drive\" to another PC. The hard disk is named \"Macintosh HD\" and I can only see system and application files but not any other directories or folders.\nIs there some special way to read data off a Macbook pro hard disk?\n\nA: Spinrite (www.grc.com) is awesome at repairing hard disks. The only caveat is you have to take it out and plug it into a PC as a drive. The PC won't read it, but Spinrite will.\n", "Q: Are \"Extensions\" something that disappeared many Mac OS versions ago? On a sheet of Mac keyboard shortcuts for booting, one of them says, \"hold down shift while booting and the computer will not load login items or extensions\".\nAm I wrong, or are Mac OS \"extensions\" something that were phased out a long time ago?  (In other words, with OS X Lion, the shift key simply cancels loading the login items, period?)\nNote that, of course, I know that \"extensions\" has meaning in other apps -- Firefox, Safari, Thunderbird, etc.  But please confirm my Mac OS X suspicion as I describe it above.  \n(Yep, I know this is related to my other question.  Getting this answer clear will allow me to resolve both questions clearly and designate their correct answers.)\n\nA: Your expectation that extensions are only a thing of the past is incorrect.\nModern Mac OS X uses kernel extensions, which are not identical to the \"old school\" extensions used in Mac OS 9 and earlier, but yes, there are still such a thing as extensions. You can find them in /System/Library/Extensions.\nApple expands on this in this support document about Safe Mode.\n\nA: To go along with @Daniel's answer: holding down the shift key on startup of OS X should prevent \"startup items\" from opening.\n", "Q: 2007 battery replacement for 15\" pro. 85w now 60w? Help! I'm looking at a replacement battery A1175 for my 2007 15\" pro (specs here: http://support.apple.com/kb/SP17), which is listed as 60w. My original battery charger was 85w. Is this going to work?\n\nA: That looks like the correct part. On the page where you linked the battery at the top right is a phone support and live chat Pre sales and apple will ensure you have the right part. \nIf there were no losses (there are and they are not negligible) and there were not a cutoff in the charging circuitry, then this battery would get charged fully in less than an hour from an 85 watt adapter. The circuitry limits the charging rate to prolong the batteries so you should expect between 2 and 4 hours to charge that \"60 watt hour\" battery. The extra \"capacity\" serves to run the device and peripherals and have extra to spare and still charge that battery when needed. \n", "Q: Search across networked drives that are only sometimes connected I've got networked drives at work and networked drives at home. What's a way to set up search so that it automatically applies searches to each drive when connected without having to rebuild the index each time I switch?\nI've tried Spotlight, Quicksilver, and Launchbar, and don't see where any of them handle this well. (I use sidekick to change all my other settings, so something that integrates with that could work.)\nOne thing that would work would be Launchbar or Quicksilver with Roo Switch. But that means maintaining three separate catalogs -- one for home, one for work, and one for everywhere else (i.e. not connected to either set of networked drives). Lame.\n\nA: EasyFind is the answer.\nDoes a search without indexing anything, in real time. Slower than Spotlight, but comforting to us Windows folks, who like to see exactly what the thing's doing. (And in practice it's actually very fast when searching for a filename.) \n", "Q: Could an app keep a trail of selected iPhone actions in a journal type style? Would it be possible for an app to be able to automatically keep a trail/log of iPhone actions? E.g., I could see all phone calls, text messages, emails and other actions I had taken in a day (all in one timeline/journal type display)? Ideally being able to configure the app to choose which actions I wanted to take a trail of?\nIs there an app that does this now?\n\nA: iOS applications run inside an individual sandbox, which prevents applications from accessing data etc. from another application. This also prevents a general \"Activity Log\" type application from working, unless Apple would provide an API for things like this.\nThings may look different in the jailbreak world but even there the applications to be monitored would need to \"publish\" their actions somewhere.\n", "Q: Subscribe to RSS feed in Mail app (iOS 5.1.1) In Lion's Mail app, I can subscribe to RSS feeds and have them show up in the inbox.  Can I do the same with the Mail app in iOS 5.1.1?\n\nA: No, the iOS mail app does not double as an RSS reader. Fortunately, however, there are many great RSS apps in the app store, my personal favorite is Reeder (iPhone, iPad).\n", "Q: How can I copy or reveal email password dots to text on iOS 5.1? How can I copy or reveal email password dots to text on my iPhone 4 running iOS 5.1?\nI have tried going to Settings -> Mail Accounts -> Gmail -> Account, but it only shows my password in dots and also does not allow me to copy it.\n\nA: You cannot. If you could copy it, someone who had your iPhone could find out your email password by copying it. \nIf you lost your Gmail password, you need to contact Google so they can reset it.\n", "Q: Help me determine what runs when I open a new Terminal window I noticed that when I started a Terminal window by accident and tried to close it quickly by pressing the X on the window, I got a dialog box like this:\n\"Closing this window will terminate the running processes: login, bash, bash, perl.\"\n\nMy computer was under heavy load at the time and slow.

Then about 30 min later it turned back on and has worked fine since. Should I be concerned about this and are there probable causes that could cause this behavior that I should look into? \n\nA: While not a definitive answer, I know someone with an iPhone 4 that did something very similar. After it happened several times, they contacted Apple support, and it was replaced under Apple Care. There's nothing that I'm aware of that you can or should do to help it, and if it starts happening more regularly, you should obviously contact Apple support.\nI'm confident you already understand this but while it could be a mere coincidence, factors such as extreme heat, and water damage could possibly have the same effect.\n\nA: Don't sweat it - if it's broken (or in the process of breaking) it will break thoroughly and completely in short order.\nDo get a good backup (and understand not everything is backed up or needs to be backed up).\nIf it happens again - here are three relevant support articles to get you to the bottom of the issue:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.apple.com/support/iphone/assistant/phone/\n\n*iOS: How to back up \n\n*iTunes: About iOS backups\n", "Q: iPod touch 3rd-gen won't play videos in Safari My iPod touch 3rd-gen won't play videos in Safari.

I travel to two different homes and spend six months at each one, taking my desktop 27\" Mac with me. I travel by car, and always pack it in the original shipping crate so it's well protected. Will all this driving cause things to loosen inside or anything else adverse?\n\nA: Apart from the obvious risk of significant damage from drops and what not (which you seem to have taken precaution against), the only real vibration prone component of computers is generally the hard drive.\nWhen a hard drive is shaken to violently, there is a risk that the read/write head will touch, scratch, and damage the spinning platter. However, in their off state, hard drives park the heads either in a \"parking zone\" in the very middle of the platter (where no data is stored) or on the outside, away from the platter. In this state, vibration isn't a threat, since the heads aren't able to reach any sections of the platters with data.\nTL;DR: It's fine so long as it's off during transport\n", "Q: What is the best option to keep Laptop and Desktop user account in Sync? I have a Mac desktop that is not always on and a Mac laptop that is usually on the same network. I have a new Synology drive that is always on and I'm considering making use of the LDAP server on it for the Mac accounts. Ideally, I would like to have the laptop and desktop's home directory syncronized through it as well. I'm aware of Portable Home Directories, but I don't have Mac OS X Server installed and my desktop isn't on all the time to sync with the laptop.\nAre there any other alternatives for keeping accounts on two computers in sync similar to Portable Home Directories?\n\nA: There are commercial programs that specialize in sync'ing folders between systems.  The one I use is Synk Pro, found at www.decimus.net.  \nSynk Pro allows either folder sync or Master -> Slave copying, so that one folder is designated as the primary repository.  Synk Pro can also remain running while the computer is on, keeping designated folders in sync.  \nBut there potential problems synchronizing home accounts across different machines.  The first one that comes to mind is ~/Library/Preferences, which stores the default setup information for your system:  some of the settings may not work properly on different machines.  The Mail folders in ~/Library could easily lead to data loss:  if you update Mail on both systems inadvertently, then synchronizing the folders could result in overwriting messages in one folder with different contents.  This can be avoided if you only retrieve mail on one system, and copy that Mail setup to the other machine.  If you only synchronize user folders, like Documents and Downloads, most of such pitfalls are avoided.  \nThere are also companies that provide data file sync through the internet, by copying your files to their servers, and then copying from their servers to the other systems you select, and authorize by password.  Two examples of these are Dropbox and www.sugarsync.com.  \nThese services cannot guarantee synchronization if you have the same file open on two machines, however.  There are some programs designed to work with Dropbox, that allow changes made on one computer to automatically show up on another machine;  for example, 1password or TextExpander.  But many programs are not so designed:  Apple programs like Pages and Numbers will not work this way.  You must close the file on all machines before the file can be sync'ed. And it should have been opened on only one machine at a time. And these services require $$ per year for large amounts of content.  Dropbox provides free accounts for up to 2 GB of data, so you could try their service for free to see if it meets your needs.  It has been very reliable for me.  \nSugarSync is designed to sync files through the internet and provide offline backup.  It has been working well after some initial problems, when their Mac program was still in beta.  Both these services allow you to sync files to Windows based machines also.  And both allow retrieving previous file versions from their servers.  \nNote that if a machine has been shutdown, it may take a long time to complete the updates over your internet connection.  My desktop remains running even if I am away from my desk.  \n", "Q: Installing ruby 1.9 on Mac OS X 10.7 I'm trying to install Kitabu on Mac OS X 10.7.4.\nWhen I tried to use gem install kitabu --pre to install kitabu, I got an error  \nERROR:  Error installing kitabu:\n        kitabu requires Ruby version ~> 1.9.\n\nAnd the preinstalled ruby is not version 1.9.\nruby -v\nruby 1.8.7 (2011-12-28 patchlevel 357) [universal-darwin11.0]\n\nCan I update preinstalled ruby to 1.9?

I've got a MacBook Pro from mid 2010 (6,2) and there is 2GB DDR3 RAM at 1067 MHz installed. I want to upgrade to 8GB but with 1333MHz as speed. Is this possible? Can my Mac support this kind of speed or will it generate a lot of erros and kernel panics?\nI already saw there were multiple topics about this, but none of them seem to answer the 1067-1333MHz clearly...\nEDIT: Will this memory fit my Mac with 100% certainty and without any issues?\n\nA: Mid 2010 MBPs (7,1) with Geforce 320M are known for freezing when using faster ram. Motherboard chipset supports it, but graphics chip doesn't and OSX freezes when initializes the graphics. \nMy recommendation - buy 1066MHz DDR3. If you can't find it in your local store, try OWC, it's a reputable online store that guarantees compatible ram at good prices.\nps. I'm not in any way connected with OWC.\n\nA: i just tried to put into my Mac Mini 2010 which normally swallows 1033Mhz DDR3 ram modules 1333mhz modules of my newer late 2011 MBP and it happens as mentioned above, kernel panic, Mac won't start up. Don't do it! ;)\n\nA: To support the point by @mspasov (sorry for unable to add comments), my MacBook Pro mid 2010 13\" (MacBookPro7,1) did not support Hynix 4GB PC3-12800 DDR3 1600 MHz sticks if used alone or 4GB+4GB, they work only if coupled (2GB+4GB) with pre-installed 2GB 1033 MHz sticks from Samsung.\n\nA: I tried 1333Mhz RAM in my 2009 MacBook Pro 5,5.\nIt seemed to work for days or even a week, but I had sporadic Kernel Panics and memory corruption Issues.\nI was completely stumped. Then I used an SPD editor on a Windows Notebook to set the default frequency of one of the modules to 1066Mhz which pulled the other one down as well. Now its working perfectly.\nSo due to NOT being able to change any settings of the RAM, I do not recommend to deviate from the recommended RAM specifications.\n", "Q: Disable system wide Ctrl+Click in OS X I'm used to navigating through my code using Ctrl+Click. In OS X this function still works in my IDE, but it opens a context menu as well, which is very annoying!\nI've done lots of Googling and didn't manage to find any answers that would let me disable Ctrl+Click system-wide in OS X 10.6.7. All the answers that I was able to find refer to Fusion and VMware.\nI have a proper mouse with two buttons, I never used Ctrl+Click and cannot see the use case for it. Could someone please tell me how to disable it?\n\nA: You can map control+click to command+click globally with KeyRemap4Macbook. Put the following in your private.xml:\n<root>\n    <item>\n        <name>Control+LeftClick Command+LeftClick</name>\n        <appendix>Control+LeftClick Command+LeftClick</appendix>\n        <identifier>control_click_to_command_click</identifier>\n        <autogen>--PointingButtonToPointingButton-- PointingButton::LEFT, ModifierFlag::CONTROL_L, PointingButton::LEFT, ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L</autogen>\n    </item>\n</root>\n\nThis will cause any ctrl-click you type to be seen by the system as ⌘-click.  That will prevent the contextual menu (since you won't actually be producing a ctrl).  You'll still need to change your IDE settings, but this way you can keep the muscle-memory for the shortcut.\n\nA: It's not possible to disable Ctrl+Click at a system-wide level.\nYou have two options: use Command+Click which is the de facto standard in all the Mac IDEs (which would be my suggestion, since going against such a well-established OS convention brings more headaches than it's worth), or configure your IDE to disable the shortcut: as you have noticed, remote desktop and virtualization environments offer the possibility.\n\nA: Following @statop's idea I used Karabiner-Elements and remapped Ctrl+Left Click to ⌘+Left Click.\nTo do that copy the mapping JSON snippet shown below to ~/.config/karabiner/assets/complex_modifications/foo.json:\n{\n  \"title\": \"Ctrl+LClick to Cmd+LClick\",\n  \"rules\": [\n    {   \n      \"description\": \"Ctrl+LClick to Cmd+LClick\",\n      \"manipulators\": [\n        {   \n          \"type\": \"basic\",\n          \"from\": {\n            \"pointing_button\": \"button1\",\n            \"modifiers\": {\n              \"mandatory\": [\n                \"left_control\"\n              ],  \n              \"optional\": [\n                \"caps_lock\"\n              ]   \n            }   \n          },  \n          \"to\": [\n            {   \n              \"pointing_button\": \"button1\",\n              \"modifiers\": [\n                \"left_command\"\n              ]   \n            }   \n          ]   \n        }   \n      ]   \n    }   \n  ]\n}\n\nthen in Karabiner go to:\nPreferences... > Complex modifications > Add Rule\n\nand you should see Ctrl+LClick to Cmd+LClick in the list. Enable the rule. Now configure your IDE to use ⌘+Left Click where you would normally use Ctrl+Left Click.\nUsing this opportunity I also swapped round Fn with ^, as on my Mac Fn is where ^ should be. To do that in Karabiner go to:\nPreferences... > Simple modifications > Add item\n\nand create two mappings:\n\n*\n\n*from fn to left_control, and\n\n*from left_control to fn.\n\nCarry on remapping and soon enough your Mac will become a usable machine!\n", "Q: MacBook Air charge plug light not working Strangely today the orange/green light isn't working when charging my MacBook Air.\nWhy might this be please?  \n\nA: According to a tech who works at a local Apple repair center it happens mostly on older plugs. But on newer and current plugs it's also not unseen.\nUsually unplugging plugging back the magsafe fixes the problem. If not the problem is usually fixed once the computer is powered off and the plug is reconnected.\nPersonally I have seen this on most of my macs. It never bothered me much. But on one of them this used to happen all the time until the battery was replaced.\nUsually the problem is the green LED being turned on instead of the amber LED during charge.

Marking as community wiki so that I'm not taking credit.\nIn this situation you will want to use the recovery tool built into the system's firmware, called \"OS X Recovery\". You can read Apple's documentation here. To start OS X Recovery, hold Cmd+R while you press the power button to turn on your computer.\nThis will download a full copy of OS X to install, so you'll probably want to hook your computer up to ethernet if it's at all available.\n", "Q: Zooming in Quicktime Screen Capture Doesn't Show I'm trying to record a screen capture with Quicktime, but whenever I zoom in, it doesn't translate to the video taken.

I have an iphone 4s and I got an error message saying it can't do a backup because I have more than 5 GB to backup (more details listed on my question here).   When i go into the detail i see that the Camera role was taking up 5.1 GB itself so thats why it can't do any more backups.\nI got suggestions on this answer to download files onto computer and then delete them off my phone.\nThe issue is that i just went and deleted all of my videos (which must have been over 1 GB) but when i go to the iCloud settings page it still shows the Camera Roll as having 5.1 GB.\nIs there anything that i need to do to have it realize that i just freed up a lot of space?\n\nA: Your answer lies deep in the settings app on your iPhone. \nGo to iCloud - Storage & Backup - Manage Storage - your device \nBackup settings allow you to save space in iCloud by excluding app data in the next back up. You can toggle on more and more buckets of data until the estimate is low enough to allow the next backup attempt to succeed.\nWhen you turn off data under iOS 7 where it says Backup Options: Choose the data you want to back up. - this does delete the backup copy of that data, so consider paying for more space (or cleaning up elsewhere) if you cannot afford to lose that backup copy.\nAssuming you have data you are willing to risk losing or is backed up to iTunes on a computer, then you can clean enough space and add things back slowly (triggering another backup after each addition) once a small minimal backup has been completed successfully. \n\nFurthermore, if you go to the above screen and turn off Camera Roll backup, it will prompt you to delete these files from the iCloud server backup, freeing the space immediately (just because you delete the videos on the device, they take up backup space on iCloud until you purge the backup by category or delete it entirely and start over). \nYour iCloud space has to remain full of files that were backed up and now deleted on the device for it to function. After a few days of backups, the old backups expire and no longer take space but in your case you might want to purge them intentionally rather than wait for it to happen programatically.\n\nA: Delete all excess photos/videos you don't want or are already downloaded elsewhere (iPhoto or something similar perhaps). In iCloud turn camera roll toggle off and on and it's instantly the actual size. \n\nA: In my personal experience, the usages shown on iCloud details page lag for some reason. Just try doing a manual backup from the main iCloud settings pane and see if it succeeds. If it still fails, then you should probably import your Camera Roll in its entirety to your computer and then sync the photos back – they'll end up getting downscaled when being synced back and will take up less space as a result.\n\nA: I had this problem in June.

To be honest, I'm surprised that you had the option to remember the setting, as I have never had that (and still can't duplicate that).\nI would recommend rebooting the phone to see if that, for some reason, fixes the problem. Also, as I'm sure you are well aware of, it should be mentioned that when you Message (MMS/iMessage) a picture or video it won't ask you the size, and when you email a video, it won't ask you the size.\nIf you really wanted to, you could reset the phone's settings (Settings > General > Reset (at the bottom of the list) > Reset All Settings). Honestly, I've only done the wipe all content and settings, so I'm not exactly sure what all it will reset, but it should take care of that problem.

Related question on Unix/Linux: How should I install software from source so that I can make my configuration manageable and reproducible? However, I've tailored this question more towards the Mac OS X ecosystem.\nI work with a lot of scientific software on Mac OS X (currently 10.7, but also 10.6). In order to maximize performance and get access to the latest features, it's often preferable to compile software from source.\nHowever, doing so is messy, and can lead to configuration problems. Since I also develop in Linux, I looked at all of the suggestions in the Unix & Linux question \"How to compile and install programs from source\" and the Unix & Linux question Where should I put software I compile from source? for some guidance. These questions are a good place to start, but it's not clear to me how I can manage dependencies and the configuration easily. For example, if I build the development branch of NumPy from source, how should I detect, manage, and resolve dependencies so that I can manage my configuration? A package manager like MacPorts, Homebrew, or Fink is one option, but if I go that route to manage my configuration, how do I compile packages so that I can use those package managers to manage dependencies? Is there something like something like checkinstall for these package managers? My goal here is to make installing and uninstalling software relatively painless without cluttering my configuration.\nI'd also like to make my configuration reproducible. By that, I mean I'd like to set up a workflow for installing software on my machine so that I could repeat it exactly on a fresh OS install. Is there a best practice for that? When it comes to standard packages in a Linux package manager, the simplest method for repeating a software install is to make a script containing the appropriate apt-get install <package> (or equivalents). However, when installing software from source, I could see this method getting very complicated. Is there a better way?\nFurthermore, for Mac OS X, many applications are installed by copying a *.app file to /Applications, or by double-clicking on a *.pkg file. Can I install these from a command line and script the installation of these packages? Furthermore, is there a good way to uninstall these packages?\n\nA: I think that a package manager will do most of what you need. I will show macports as that is the one I know but the others have similar functionality.\nIf you use the standard packages ie the up to date ones that have been packaged then macports will do all the dependencies for you. e.g. building scipy knows it has to build numpy first and will do it. You can also ninstall a port easily - macports will tell you if any ports depend on it. If a port is chnaged then macports will update the ports depending on it.\nYou can also manually chnage the port to deal with development versions of numpy for example. You will have to produce a copy of the port file and edit that see macports guide. The minimum would be to change the version and the rules for downloading so you get different code but can include many patches for OSX specific functions.\nYou can keep track of what you have installed by port list (also more advanced calls to minimise the number of commands you need. The changes you made will be in your local  Portfile repository  which will need to be backed up and a small change to the defualt macports config made.\n\nA: It sounds like there are really two questions here:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to auto configure distributed source code.\n\n*How to install pre-compiled application bundles from the command line.\n\n\nFor source distribution, it sounds like GNU autoconf is what you are looking for.\nFor pre-compiled .app bundles, command line installation is as simple as \ncp -R MyApp.app /Applications/\n\nThis assumes 10.5 or later, where the command line tools are fully OS X aware.\nFor pre-compiled .pkg bundles, command line installation is \ninstaller -package MyApp.pkg -target /\n\nBoth of the above commands need to be preceded by sudo if installation will require administrative privileges.  When in doubt, assume it will:\nsudo installer -package MyApp.pkg -target /\n\nBonus installer tip: you can turn any folder into a .dmg like this:\nhdiutil create -ov -format UDBZ -noscrub -srcfolder MyAppsFolder/ MyAppImage.dmg\n\nInclude a symbolic link to /Applications/ in that folder, along-side your .app, and end-users can drag-and-drop.\nAdvanced Bonus Tip: Look in PAM for the PERL utility Mac::Finder::DSStore.  This lets you edit the .DS_Store file in your .dmg's template folder so that you can precisely place icons and graphics.\n", "Q: How can I change the currency on the App Store? I bought my iPhone 4 in France, but since then moved to the US.

(They do show up in playlists, but this does not help my cause; selecting these videos through such at list at most lets me delete them from the playlist.)\nFWIW, the media kind for all these videos is iTunes U.  I am not able to change this media kind in the Get Info > Options dialog, because the option is grayed out.  (For no other item in this iPod do I see a grayed out Media Kind option in this dialog.)\nMy question boils down to:\n\nHow can delete these \"zombie\" videos?\n\nPossible complications:\n\n\n*\n\n*The version of iTunes I'm using is 9.2.1.  (Version 10 was hatred-at-first-sight for me, and I have never given it a second chance.)\n\n*The iPod is hugely out-of-sync relative to my main iTunes library.  I have disabled automatic sync-ing, because my main iTunes library is far bigger than I could fit in this iPod, even though, over the years, I have deleted stuff from my main iTunes library that I still have in my iPod.  (In general, I find iTunes' sync-ing behavior too bewildering, therefore disabling automatic sync-ing is the only alternative I consider safe.)\n\n*If I select the iPod icon in iTunes, and choose the iTunes U tab, all the controls on the resulting screen are grayed out.  (This is possibly related to [1] or [2] above)1.\n\n\nThanks!\n\n1 Complication #3 above suggests that I may be able to get some traction if I were to enable synchronization, since this could (conceivably) result in a re-enabling of the currently disabled iTunes U tab.  Unfortunately, doing so would, of course, set off synchronization, which I most definitely do not want.  One possibility would be to create a new empty iTunes library, start iTunes with this empty library as its library, and then enable synchronization.  This would ensure that nothing gets copied from my laptop to the iPod (or so I would hope), but it does not guarantee that the contents of the iPod would be left untouched.  (How do I know that the sync-ing wont cause the entire contents of my iPod to be wiped out?)  Of course, in any case, even if I can turn-on auto sync-ing safely, it's anyone's guess whether this will lead to an ultimate solution to the problem of deleting the unwanted files.\n\nA: On an iPod Classic there is no way to delete them from the device. It needs to be connected to iTunes to do it the official way. The problem will be that it has been so long since your last sync that it may make too many changes to your iPod. You could connect it to iTunes and cancel the sync, then go to the iPod's main page and select to sync manually. At that point you should be able to update the media on your iPod in a more controlled way.\n\nA: On iOS devices, iTunes U content is managed through Apple’s dedicated iTunes U app. Downloading it to your device is your best bet for getting rid of your “zombie” videos if they are of iTunes U type (which you can’t change, as it is a category entirely under Apple’s control – the “U” stands for “University”, and adding content is limited to registered education partners).\n", "Q: How can I remove the Job Title and Company from all Address Book contacts using AppleScript?

However, after going through the signup process, my Dad's name shows up because he is the credit card holder. How can I publish an app under my name, if I don't have access to my own credit card? Should I buy a prepaid one?\n\nA: Apple is a stickler for the legal name being legal and legitimate. As you're aware, you must be at least 18 years old to legally sign up for Apple's Paid Developer Program.\nI've seen children who publish apps with the by line saying \"By Child's Name and Parent's Name\" and the seller simply being the parent. Here's an example. The child, Thomas Suarez, is 12, and he published the app like above.\nI don't believe that there's any other way, besides creating a company and publishing through that.

I use column view, and it seemed that my old ^⌘1 and ^⌘2 keyboard shortcuts weren’t working.\nMac OS X Lion’s Finder introduces two ways to sort: Arrange By and Sort By.\nArrange By is more useful in icon view and list view. Setting Arrange by to something else, such as Kind or Last Opened, will have Finder ‘arrange’ the file listing into categories which are ‘sorted’.\nIf you go to the View menu you’ll see Arrange By. If you then hold down Option (⌥) you’ll get Sort By. Here’s where I got caught out. If you have the submenu open when you start holding Option, you’ll need to have the menu close and reopen before you get the right options.\nWhen working correctly, in column view it seems that the Sort By menu will be disabled unless you have Arrange By set to None.\nThere’s also a “Arrange” button in the toolbar now, which will display the Sort By menu when you option-click it.\nSo, if your sorting isn’t working the way you want it, here’s how to reset it:\nView > Arrange By > None (^⌘0)\nHold Option, View > Sort By > Name (^⌥⌘1)\n\n\nA: If @Michiel's answer doesn't work for you because you don't have a clickable list header, like in this picture:\n\nThen what you need to do is set Arrange to None.

I upgraded my iPhone from iOS 3 to iOS 5. It is now blocked: it shows a USB icon and the iTunes icon. How to proceed?\n\nA: Start iTunes on your computer (ideally on the one you used to sync your iPhone with) and connect the iPhone via USB.\nYou will get an error message or number if there is something else amiss, but usually getting iTunes to do the download and then the restore will fix things up for you.\n\nA: This is a normal part of the installation.

Plugging it back into you computer should fix this. \n", "Q: Size of text in the new Retina MacBook Pros I saw there is a new version of MacBook Pro is out which has Retina Display. This means there are more pixel per inch. Does this imply that text is smaller?\n\nA: It depends on your setting.\nThere is a new option to configure the resolution and rendering in System Preferences → Color LCD. While you actually change the resolution and redering, Apple only refers to the visual impact of the settings.\nSo basically changing the setting offers:\n\n*\n\n*Large text, but much crispier.\n\n*More space for visual content (and smaller text), but not as sharp.\n\n*Something in-between (default retina).\n\n\n(original picture from AndaTech)\n\nA: No. Text will be the same size. It will just have two times the resolution in each direction. Just like the difference between the original iPad and the 3rd gen iPad.\n\nA: As you can see on the new MacBook Pro page (under the Retina-feature item), if you use the binoculars on the text, it doesn't look smaller. It just looks much, much, much sharper! \nIt's the same as the iPhone 4(S) comparing to the iPhone 3G(S). You don't need better glasses to read the text, because it's not smaller. It's just much sharper and easier to read.\nMaybe, I can make my point even better with the iPad Retina page. You'll see you can fit as much text on both the Retina screen as the normal screen. It's just sharper!\nBefore you make a comment, YES, I know it's a screenshot of an iPad and the question is about the new MacBook Pro, but I didn't found any image with this much text on the new MacBook Pro, so hence the iPad Retina screen. \n\n", "Q: Can't get commands inside .bash_profile startup script to run From my bash shell (latest version of Lion) if I issue the command...\nsource ~/sh/bashmarks.sh\n\nThe bashmarks.sh script will run and the functionality it provides is available.

It is used to create, display, modify and otherwise manipulate text files.\n\n\nA: Since this question is about \"built-in\" editors \"like\" nano, this question needs an updated answer:\nThe command pico is just a symlink to nano, vi is actually vim as is ex and not counting awk or psed, cat, xargs, constructions and the like, thats about it, since ed is indeed present but very unlike nano (depending on the definition of \"editor\").\nThree CLI text editors (like nano) are present in the default of Sierra:\n\n\n*\n\n*nano (installed:  2.0.6, current:  2.8.7. \"Of course, you should always check the nano homepage to see what the latest and greatest version is.\")\n\nGNU nano is designed to be a free replacement for the Pico text editor, part of the Pine email suite from The University of Washington.

I'm interested in purchasing the new MacBook Pro with Retina display, but it's not clear from the tech specs page whether the RAM is user-upgradeable or not.\nDo I need to take into account future RAM usage when customizing my MacBook Pro order, or can I go with 8GB RAM and upgrade it later? \n\nA: I called Apple to find out, and they confirmed that it is not user-upgradeable: the tech explained that they used the same process they used for the MacBook Air to save space: there are no sticks of RAM, and the RAM has been soldered directly onto the main board.\nAs Russell Borogove noted in the comments, this is now confirmed when you configure the MacBook Pro before purchase:\n\nPlease note that the memory is built into the computer, so if you think you may need more memory in the future, it is important to upgrade at the time of purchase.\n\nSo if you were thinking you might want the 16GB RAM in the future, you'd want to choose it when you order the MacBook Pro, as you won't be able to upgrade later.\n\nA: iFixit has posted a tear-down of the new Macbook Pro with Retina display and on step 17 you can see that the RAM is soldered to the back of the logic board (red rectangle):\n\nPicture from iFixit.com \n\nAll iFixit content is licensed under the open source Creative Commons BY-NC-SA license.\n\n", "Q: Nvidia 9400M vs Intel HD Graphics 4000 I have done some searching on Google and found some tests saying HD 4000 is a great improvement over the previous generation, but I didn't get any tests that compared it with discrete chips.\nCould any of you guys that are more into hardware tell me if the Intel HD 4000 will be better than Nvidia 9400M? \nThe integrated graphics is in the Mid-2012 13\" MacBook Pro with 2.9 Ghz Core i7, while the Nvidia part is in the 2009 13\" MacBook Pro 2.53 Ghz Core 2 Duo.\nP.S. I only play Diablo 3 on my laptop. I don't care about graphics as long as the framerate is good. Currently, with the Nvidia chip, it's really bad. It is listed as low-performance on Blizzard's site, but the Intel HD 4000 is, too.\n\nA: According to the benchmark comparison tool here, the HD 4000 has between 2x and 6x the benchmark scores of the 9400M. (How relevant the scores are to your gaming experience is yet to be seen. Some of these are synthetic benchmarks, so they may not be wholly relevant.) The list is ranked with faster cards first, and the HD 4000 is #181, while the two 9400Ms are at #302 and #310.\ntl;dr: It seems that the Intel HD 4000 should be better than the Nvidia GeForce 9400M.\nNote: to be able to select the 9400M in the list, you need to deselect the \"Still available (not archived)\" box to show old cards.\n", "Q: How does do not disturb in iOS 6 differ from the physical silent switch? In iOS 6, we now will have a Do Not Disturb feature that prevents the phone from making sound when it receives notifications.\nHow is this any different from using the silent switch? Or is it just that it can be scheduled, unlike silent mode?\n\nA: Do Not Disturb stops all notifications from occurring (so your screen won't light up). Silent will still cause the screen to light up, vibrate if enabled etc. The notifications will still be shown in notification centre.\nIf you receive a call while on do not disturb the caller gets a call failure and you will be shown a missed call on the recent list as opposed to silent where it will still ring (screen change etc) and you can choose to answer.\nDo not disturb will allow certain selected calls to come through (you can customise this in notifications in settings). It can also be scheduled which is what I have been using most.\nThere is a section on Apple's iOS 6 page but it is not great. \n", "Q: iTunes song purchases I have an Apple ID and I have purchased some songs. My sister likes the same songs and wants them for her iPod Touch. I was wondering if I logged in with my Apple ID on her iPod and downloaded the same songs - would I have to pay again? I know Apple doesn't encourage ID sharing but my sister does't have a credit card or iTunes giftcard.\n\nA: You won't be charged again. I have done this before in a similar situation, and it works fine. However, if the device gets restored or if the songs get deleted, you will have to sign in again to redownload them onto the device, which can be a pain.\n", "Q: New MacBook Pro Retina Hard Drive Type I'm looking to buy a 15\" Retina MacBook Pro, I'm looking at the website Models and they seem to be pretty inflexible (for instance the 2.3 GHz model you are locked into a 256 GB HD).  \nSo I know this is a little preemptive, but I want to know how the hard drive is configured. For instance, on my current MacBook Pro I swapped out the standard hard drive for a 480 GB SSD. If the new thinner model has a standard SSD I will buy the 2.3 GHz model and add larger hard drive. My worry is it will use a proprietary hard drive like those found in the Air in which case I would be forced to buy the 2.6 GHz model just to get the larger storage I suppose.\nDoes anyone have any info on this?\n\nA: The flash modules and controller of the SSD are blades (think naked SSD). They are not up to 3rd party configuration (at this time), but according to bmike, they are not soldered onto the main board and are actually discrete components.\nHowever, there is no information as to what kind of proprietary (if any) configuration the blades come in, or whether they require an additional proprietary onboard controller (this may be likely given Apple's tendency to create speciality hardware for their line-up). So it most likely isn't the case that one could just crack open an existing SSD and use the blades within. A manufacturer would have to specifically design a unit for the new notebook. This isn't unlikely, but price will be the determining factor as it will be a speciality component.\nIt is also not clear at this time if Apple will make the components upgradeable, which is also a distinct possibility given how quickly SSDs are saturating the market place.\nAt best, it's a tentative \"maybe.\"\n\nYou can read more about the new machine here: http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/design/\n\nA: OWC are now offering 480GB replacement SSD modules specifically for the Retina MacbookPro. \nhttp://eshop.macsales.com/shop/SSD/OWC/Aura_Pro_Retina_2012\nThey are not a standard form factor, (and still a long way off being considered 'cheap') but at least it means that a route to increasing capacity from 256 to 480GB exists.\n\nA: The new MacBookPro from Apple uses flash memory directly embedded on to circuit board and currently not replaceable. \nP.S. This is part of the reason that the new model is so thin.\n", "Q: Why does AirPort Utility support file sharing? The AirPort utility app for the iPhone allows you to share documents between a computer and an iOS device.\n\nWhat kind of documents, if any, would I share between my Mac and the AirPort utility app?\n\nA: This is so that you can load configuration profiles. Say you want to set up a campus network where all the base stations have the same network name, admin password (or printing password or iCloud accounts). \nThis will allow you to make a copy of a configuration and load it from iOS to a computer or the other way for standardized setup.\n", "Q: Moving Drives Between Macs I'm considering buying a new MacBook Pro after today's refresh, and I am wondering if OS X handles simply pulling a drive out of one MacBook Pro and putting it in another. I know that in the Windows world this is — most of the time — possible, but I have never tried it with OS X. Does the OS handle the sudden change in hardware, or does it 'sh*t bricks' and abort mission? In theory you'd think it could handle it, but anyone with definite experience would be good.\n\nA: In general, this is a very safe, OS X boots other hardware in general situation.\nHowever, when new hardware is released - often a special build is made and until the next revision or two of software, you can't boot that hardware so you'd need to take a hard drive from the specialized machine to an older one instead of the other way around.\nIt's far safer to migrate from a Time Machine or target mode or from running OS using file sharing / network. That way each machine has the correct OS and can flag apps or system files for non-transfer when there is a known problem migrating them.\n\nA: Odds are, the new drive is larger than the old, no? Certainly younger, and harddrives have a failure rate that rises with age.\nI suggest you use migration assistant and just move the data over to the new machine. \n", "Q: What happens if iPhoto is opened and the volume with the library is not available? I'm considering purchasing a MacBook Air for my primary \"home\" computer.  Given that it won't have enough storage for an iPhoto library for all of my photos, I'd like to also purchase an Airport Extreme and put the iPhoto library on a network drive.\nWhat would happen if I set this up, and then opened iPhoto on the Air when the library is not available, such as not being on the home network?  Anything catastrophic?\nAs a corollary to this question, would a secondary MacBook Pro be able to share the same iPhoto library?\n\nA: To answer your first question, nothing really bad will happen when it can't find the library. Basically, if it can't find it, it will prompt you with which one to open. This would be the same as holding down Option when launching iPhoto (or iTunes, Aperture, etc). \nThe below folder was after I had created a new library on an external drive, and then disconnected the drive. When I plugged it back in, this list had a new option saying 'Test' (my test library), and default beside that. \n\nSo, all iPhoto is doing here is asking you if you want to open another library (because it can't find your default one). While not a benefit in iPhoto, aperture actually lets your export a project as a library, so you could take only a small part of your library with you on the go to work on, then re-add it back to your library when 'connected' again (I don't think iPhoto does this, but I am not sure, I use Aperture more than iPhoto). \nFor your second question, yes, the other MacBook Pro should be able to see it as well. In that case, you may want to hold down Option to select it from this drive, etc. \nThe only thing you need to be worried about in that case is not having it open on two machines at the same time (if it was on a network drive). It may prevent you from doing this in the first place, but if it doesn't, it may not be supported and may have issues. \n\nA: A strong warning: If you're trying to edit the Library (that is, make albums, move photos around, keyword, make books or slideshows etc.) or edit individual photos in it via Wireless be very careful. Dropouts are a common fact of wireless networking, and should one occur while the app is writing to the database then your Library will be damaged. Simply, I would not do this with my Libraries. \n", "Q: How to securely delete versions in mac os lion I know, that there is a possibility to delete selected versions in Mac OS Lion.\nIs there a way to securely delete versions?\nAlthough I already deleted the versions by now, that I wanted to delete, but what way can I make sure, that any remains of those version is removed? (Technically: not just the inode is removed, but also it's content.)\n\nA: I can't think of a targeted way to do this, but this should do the trick. Delete the versions that you want to delete using the method outlined in the question you linked to. Then use Disk Utility's \"Erase Free Space\" option (or diskutil secureErase freespace [level] [device]) to write over the data.\n", "Q: MacBook Retina Display for coding This is a question that could be better on Stack Overflow or Programmers, but I thought I'd try it here first.\nAs a programmer, I need lots of screen real-estate for the IDE and files that I'm editing.  If I need to work from a laptop, I currently use an Acer with 18.5\" screen and 1920x1200 resolution. It's old, heavy (almost 4 kg) and in need of replacement.\nMost of my work is on Windows, but the ability to do Mac and iOS development would be great, so I'm considering a MacBook Pro with VMware or Parallels instead.\nThe new MacBook Retina sounds great, but I'm worried that the ultra-high DPI won't work well when used with Windows on Parallels, and text will be so small it's unreadable (many Windows apps tend not to scale fonts well, and my eyesight isn't 100% any more).\nHas anybody got experience of running an IDE (Delphi, Visual Studio, whatever) on a Retina MacBook Pro under Parallels? Was there a significant increase in the amount of usefully legible information compared to a non-Retina MacBook?\n[Edit: I've just been reading some more detailed stuff about how the display can be scaled from AnandTech. The screenshot showing Portal with an illegible console is the thing that concerns me. ]\n\nA: I am an active software developer and DBA, who looks at the code all day long, and I absolutely LOVE my new retina MacBook Pro with Windows 7 installed under Boot Camp!\nA quick sidebar is that I am still confused when I read articles about the lack of NVIDIA driver availability and other issues posted in reviews even on prominent sites like Anandtech. I think they may have created their reviews before Apple started to officially ship these laptops... - i.e. I got my laptop on June 18th, used Boot Camp wizard to create USB with Win 7 Ultimate x64 with SP1 and installed it outright (after resolving a quick NTFS support issue using NTFS-3g under Lion) and have been happy ever since. There is a support folder created by Boot Camp that contains Boot Camp installer, which installs all of the drivers (including the supposedly missing NVIDIA driver) and everything is tip-top.\nNow, back to the resolution, and the use of this laptop for development…\nOut of the box you will get the maximum resolution (2880x1800) and Windows will apply 150% DPI scaling (actually it is 144 DPI as opposed to 92 DPI by default). And although you will marvel at the display, you will quickly realize that the text is still too small. I got a near perfect 20x20 and I still had to go up to 168% before I felt more or less comfortable. (Note that I tried 200%, 175% and some other values in-between, and although text gets bigger, many UI elements (even Windows / Office 2010) start mis-behaving, look pixelated, etc.) So, again, after some experimenting, I settled at 168%.\nOnce you settle in at whatever DPI you are most comfortable with, you will start setting up all of your apps – Office, Other browsers, RDP, Management Studio, Visual Studio, etc., and that is where it starts being a little challenging. Not all apps support high DPI (or non-\"standard\" DPI setting). While IE8 and MS Office 2010 handles everything reasonably well, other apps may require you to adjust compatibility setting and disable the effect of DPI, which makes them work right, but text is super tiny unless you go in and adjust default text size (which is what you will end up doing just about everywhere). So, get ready to Zoom like crazy, although many apps will remember and respect the zoom setting once you dial it in.\nQuick note regarding other browsers - as of this commentary, I somewhat refrain from using Opera and Chrome, because I could not find a right Zoom combination that worked well for web page UI elements. Sure – the text is bigger – but layout breaks and things look weird enough for me to go to another browser. So far, I am happy with IE8, Firefox 14, even Safari, but not with Chrome or Opera.\nAnother side note is that unless you have other super hi-rez monitors, moving the application form MBP screen to a monitor with less than 25XX resolution will present a challenge (unless aforementioned compatibility setting is set, and even then you will need to reduce text / zoom out.) This is because even a \"typical\" hi-rez 1080p monitor (i.e. 1920 x 1080) will display your app like 680 x 480 when you move it from MBP display - not physically, but perceptually - blame your new retina display if you like...\nBut back to the retina display - the display itself is amazingly sharp and clear, and with a little effort you will get tremendous benefit (especially if you are a coder) as you get smaller, but much, much... much clearer text (so smaller text is no longer a problem), which means you can display a lot more code on the screen and your efficiency will improve significantly!\nIn closing, once you go retina, you cannot go back - a few hours working with it and you will not be able to use a typical laptop (or low-rez display), because everything will look pixelated and fuzzy.\nThat's all I have to say - thanks for reading.\n\nA: I have \"bad news\" for you. You want the new Retina MBP.\nI'm running VMware 3 on mine right now, at the highest resolution of the 5 choices. Non-retina apps like VMware see it as 1920x1200. In Windows text is a bit small, but it works. The default, 1440x900, is the sharpest. Retina apps will use every pixel, non-retina apps will use four pixels.\nAn app that supports the retina display has access to the full resolution. If the app is written correctly, then all the controls and widgets and things say precisely the same apparent size, they just get way sharper. The Portal example is why they don't expose the full resolution.\nWhat this means is that I can run my machine at 1440x900 normally, getting insanely sharp text. When I want to load up Xcode and edit an iPad UI, I can then shrink my display to 1920x1200, for some (surprisingly minor) loss in sharpness, and fit way more on screen.\nAs I understand it, for sharpness reasons, when I ramp the resolution up to max it appears to be a 1920x1200 retina display - so retina apps render at 3840x2400 and that gets scaled down to the real native display of 2880x1800. That produces better results than scaling 1920x1200 up to 2880x1800.\nVMware doesn't include any retina APIs, so it does pixel doubling. Of course, even if it did support the retina APIs, I don't know if Windows apps have anything close. So: Windows apps look like 1440x900 or 1920x1200, or one of the other 3 choices (The Displays control panel doesn't tell you the actual resolutions, in typical Apple style.)\n\nA: I'm a Windows developer using Parallels 8 to run a Windows 8 VM on a 2013 Macbook Pro Retina 15\".\nI was able to solve the issues I was having with the Visual Studio applications and other apps (I describe some of the issues I was seeing below) by going to Parallels configuration through 'Configure... -> Hardware -> Video' and setting the resolution to 'Scaled'. And then in the Windows 8 VM set the 'Size of all items' to '100%' by right-clicking on the Desktop, selecting 'screen resolution', selecting the 'Make text and other items larger or smaller' link and then selecting '100%'. I have my Windows 8 resolution set to 1440x900 (I haven't tried a higher resolution since this is comfortable for me.) This seems to have fixed all of the issues I was having.\nI was initially very disappointed with the resolution of the Visual Studio 2010/2012 and SQL Server Management applications when I was using the Parallels recommended 'Video' setting 'Best for Retina'. This essentially sets the DPI in Windows to be very high (199%). The text wasn't horribly blurry, but it wasn't clear either. The way it affected the layout of the some of the Visual Studio windows was horrible. For example, when using SQL Server Management Console when trying to attach a new .mdf, the file explorer window to browse to the mdf would be completely blank and I'd have to maximize the window just to see a sliver of the folder hierarchy so I could browse the file I wanted. Sometimes text was cut off and, although text was an expected size for the resolution, mouse pointers and indicators were very small and splash pages were extremely small and disproportionate.\nSince switching over to 'Scaled' (and 100% DPI in Windows 8) I haven't seen any of these issues and I'm enjoying using the 15\" Retina for Windows development.\n\nA: This question about the font-size on a Retina MacBook Pro comes close to yours.\nIn short, it's the same amount of text on your screen, it has only much more detail.\nI'm guessing it's the same with Windows. (Here's hoping the Windows drivers will support the Retina graphics.)\n\nA: I recently wrote a review about windows programming on the MacBook retina, focusing on the windows specific problems of the laptop which are rarely talked about but should not be underestimated.\nShort version:\n\n\n*\n\n*Widespread lack of support for high DPI settings is by far the biggest problem. It often requires you to spend a large amount of time setting up new apps and searching on google how to fix the issues, and sadly some issues (such as the one shown in the screenshot below) cannot be fixed.\n\nOverall, it just feels very hacky. We can hope, now that very high resolution monitors are becoming more common, those issues will gradually disappear but this hasn't happened yet.\n\n*The battery lasts half the time on Windows than what it does on Mac OS. The reason is that Windows is only able to use the nvidia card, while on Mac OS the nvidia card is used only when running graphics intensive operations and the integrated card (which uses considerably less power) is used for day to day operations, such as browsing the internet.\n\n*The keyboard is optimized for Mac OS. An example is the swapped position of the windows and alt keys. This is the most minor problem.\nBesides those 3 issues, everything else works. The performance is great, bootcamp is easy to use and I never had a problem with it, the display is crisp, the laptop is beautiful.\nI just wish I didn't have to deal with the DPI issues.\n\nA: Based on this AnandTech article, it appears that there are five easily-accessible resolution settings. Each one is rendered at 2x the nominal resolution, then that image is put on the screen. Normal pixel-for-pixel mode uses 1440x900 as the nominal resolution, which is rendered at 2x (2880x1800), which fits the screen perfectly. There are two higher resolutions, the highest of which is nominally 1920x1200, which is rendered at double res and that is displayed. (The point of rendering higher resolution than the screen is so the image is downsampled instead of upsampled, which looks better.\n\nA: I can offer you some experience coding in a 200PPI environment (using Linux): I have an IBM T221 (22\" monitor and 3840x2400 resolution). There's a Chromium bug that the URL bar, the bookmarks bar and such does not obey DPI settings so that's almost unreadably small. I need to lean extremely close to read that. Usually, I zoom a lot while browsing because the default for websites is also unreadable and in Chrome some sites (Macrumors) ignore zooming (argh). Switch to Firefox, it zooms. Some Java applets (notably the BrettspielWelt boardgaming app) ignores the DPI setting too. This is simply ungood. You will use http://osxdaily.com/2012/01/02/enable-screen-zoom-in-mac-os-x-lion/ sometimes. Othewise programs which obey zooming are so so very beautiful :)\n\nA: An app is just an app is just an app, whether it's a virtual machine in parallels or a game, and the Keynote specifically mentioned pixel doubling for non-retina apps (which makes sense, they have to co-exist), so unless you boot direct in Bootcamp, I don't foresee an issue\n\nA: I use the MacBook at native 2880x1800 no problem but that is me. I got Windows running at default 96 DPI settings no problem. The 150% that the Mac driver automatically upped it to is huge IMHO.\nAnyway I use a T221 on Linux and have X set at 75 DPI and I have never had problems reading stuff so it really just depends on the person.\n\nA: If you're a coder and using a fixed width font, such as the original IBM VGA font and derivatives (Default linux font, \"one of the X11 VGA fonts with UTF support\", Fixedsys, Fixedsys Excelsior, etc), then your options must be limited to 2 x scaling?\nSurely the Fixedsys font must look less sharp at 1920x1200 resolution, on the macbook pro retina compared to a laptop with a native 1920x1200 display.\n\nA: Here's a video of someone running Visual Studio 2012 on Windows 8 via Parallels on the Retina MacBook Pro:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRwpCn2ennE\n", "Q: Wifi/Bluetooth/Ethernet all mixed up in Sys Prefs Today took my iMac out of sleep (9,1) and it was not loading anything over the internet.

I have and early intel iMac that also has the intel core Duo (two cores but not much shared between the two. You essentially have a machine with two 32bit processors. that live to serve separately. \nWithout special features of the \"soft bios\", that is, no Bios Chip on the motherboard the iMac will only boot with certain linux loaders that handle EFI booting properly. I am happily using super pup linux. I have tried booting with 20 differing linux packages and 17 of them have no clue what CDrom \"type\" I'm using and refuse to boot at all. Cool! soft BIOS..stupid BIOS. \nSince the original issue was, no internal CDROM, an external works just fine. I know, I just piked another up at a Good.. second hand store for $3. It boots my iMac at holding the option key.\nIf you are looking for pure 64 bit computing from the core duo.. probably not gonna happen.. beside the memory capacity of the machine is limited.\n\nA: This answer actually pertains to a this question and the closed question by mandesi c. Kaumba, which is titled Booting Linux on an 2006 iMac. The body of this question is given below.\n\nI have removed a hard drive from my 2006 iMac and installed Ubuntu on it from another computer. However, after putting it back in the iMac, it is not able to boot. I am getting a question mark instead. Can anyone provide assistance?\n\nThe current 20.04 LTS release of Ubuntu has the following in the list of system requirements:\n\n*\n\n*A 64 bit processor\n\n*At least a 2 GHz processor speed\n\n*4 GiB of RAM (system memory)\n\nNone of the 2006 iMac models meet all of these requirements. While some models can accept 4 GiB of RAM, not all of this RAM can be accessed. The following excerpt was taken from everymac.com.\n\nThe net result is that at least 3 GB of RAM should be fully accessible, while when 4 GB of RAM installed, ~700 MB of of the RAM is overlapping critical system functions, making it non-addressable by the system.\n \nUltimately, 4 GB of RAM may be installed, but not all RAM in excess of 3 GB can be used due to the possibility of memory \"overlap\".\n\nIf your 2006 iMac has a 64 bit processor, then you might be able to install the current release of Xubuntu, which currently requires less RAM. However, all 2006 iMacs have a 32 bit EFI, so 64 bit operating systems can not be EFI booted from these Macs. This is the most likely cause of the problem described in mandesi c. Kaumba's question. However, for 2006 iMacs with 64 bit processors, there exists the possibility to BIOS boot 64 bit operating systems. However, below are some issues which need to be noted.\n\n*\n\n*Many Linux installation DVDs (burned from Linux installation IS0s) contain more than one way to boot. For example, the DVD can be either EFI or BIOS boot. Many (if not all) 2006 iMacs can not boot from these types of DVDs.\n\n*Many (if not all) 2006 iMacs needed a firmware upgrade before being able to BIOS boot. To preform this upgrade, OS X needs to be installed on the Mac. Information on getting a Snow Leopard ISO file and creating an installer can be found here.\n\n*Some versions of Linux require the USB installer to be BIOS booted in order to install a BIOS booting operating system. The firmware for all 2006 iMacs can not BIOS boot from USB devices. However, the 32 bit Debian Linux USB installer can be 32 bit EFI booted and can install a BIOS booting Debian Linux. You can then use the Grub included with this installation to BIOS boot a 64 bit Linux installer (such as Xubuntu) and overwrite the 32 bit Debian with a 64 bit BIOS booting Linux. The procedure would be similar to what is post in this answer.\n\n", "Q: Apple wireless keyboard without num keypad Does anyone know how to delete line breaks after text please?\nI used to place the cursor after the last letter or symbol, take the page down to the bottom, and on the numeric keypad, hold down the delete key until the line breaks disappeared.\nI've tried fn and backspace, but that doesn't take out the line breaks.\n\nA: fn-delete (fn-⌫) should also be equivalent to forward delete (⌦).\n\nA: If you press the Delete key it removes content after the cursor, if you press the backspace key it removes content before the cursor. \nThat works on mine at least.

I have an HP 1022 printer attached to my Mac OS X Lion. \nWhen I try to print a 4-page PDF file from Preview or Adobe Reader, it prints pages 1 and 3 and then all 3 lights on the HP 1022 printer start blinking.\nI suspect that perhaps the printer or the system is in some kind of manual double-side printing mode, but I could not find where I can turn it on or off using the Mac OS printing dialogs.\nHow can one control manual double-side printing on a Mac OS X Lion?\n\nA: You can go to Print & Scan in the system preferences and select Options & Supplies for your printer. In there, you should see an option for Duplex Unit (if your printer supports it). If that is checked, you can use the automatic double-side printing (by checking the Two-sided box next to Copies). If not, or if that option is unavailable, you can't.\n\nIn case you can't select that option, here's how you can manually print double-sided pages.\nManual double-side printing\nYou can control manual double-side printing (i.e., you physically turn the sheets over) using the Paper Handling setting in the print dialog.\nIf you select Paper Handling, you'll find a Pages to Print option that lets you print either only the odd pages or only the even pages (default is both). To print double side manually, select Odd Only first and when it finishes printing, flip the pages over and select Even Only\n\nInstead of flipping each page over to its blank side before printing the even pages, you have a more convenient option of flipping the entire block of pages, so that the last sheet is on top (useful when you have a lot of pages to be printed). With this, you can then choose Reverse in Page Order to print the even numbered pages backwards. (Note: be careful that if you have an odd-number of pages in total, you might have to leave the last one out before printing the even ones.)\n\n\nA: In a search, I just found this great tool from HP that facilitates manual duplex printing from OSX with minimal steps. I just tried it with success using my Epson NX-515.\nhttp://whp-hou9.cold.extweb.hp.com/pub/softlib/software12/COL35975/mp-88750-2/HP_Two-sided_Printing.dmg\n\nA: With my printer I can:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select Paper Handling > Pages to Print > Odd Only and print the pages.\n\n*Insert the pile of papers on the tray again so that the printed side is facing up and the text is not upside down.\n\n*Select Paper Handling > Pages to Print > Even Only and print the pages.\n\n\nWith a printer that prints on the other side, follow the steps described by rm -rf:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select Paper Handling > Pages to Print > Odd Only and print the pages.\n\n*If the total number of pages is odd, remove the last page\n\n*Flip the pile of papers and insert it on the tray.\n\n*Select Paper Handling > Pages to Print > Even Only, select Paper Handling > Pages to Print > Reverse, and print the pages.\n\n\nA: I've found that for my printer at least (a Brother HL-3070CW), it's easier to:\n\n\n*\n\n*print the even pages first\n\n*flip the pages so the printed side is up and put them back in the tray\n\n*print the odd pages\n\n\nThis way you end up with the pages in the correct order when finished and don't have to worry about selecting reverse.\n", "Q: What displays are capable of displaying full resolution from the new MacBook Pro with retina display?

In simpler terms, you can use LineIn to play sound coming in through a microphone or any other device plugged in to your Sound In port, just as was once available with OS 9's \"Play input through output device\" option. \n\n\nA: It can. If the program you are using allows it. But realistically go into the sound prefs and have it where the input is via a mic, and the output is via the headset. This should do what you need. \n", "Q: Do multimedia messages sent with iMessage impact data? When I send a pictures from my iPhone (which has a SMS/MMS plan), does it impact data if I'm on a 4G network, and send it through iMessage?\nSimilarly, if I disable iMessage, then send an MMS over 4G, would it still use some data?\n\nA: iMessage is pure data usage, so yes it will affect your data.\nMMS use depends on your carrier, but most charge a fixed fee per message, so it may be worth finding out the costs for this.\nIn the UK at least, there are many high data and unlimited data tariffs, so it's far better to replace all SMS and MMS with iMessage (or alternatives such as WhatsApp) where possible.\n", "Q: Reinstalling OS X Lion vs restoring from Time Machine backup If the system doesn't boot up (it was due to this issue), is it better to reinstall OS X Lion, or restore from a Time Machine backup?\nI do see a Time Machine backup from 3 AM last night, so if that is used to restore the machine, will it read all 600 GB from the external backup drive and copy it to the iMac's hard drive, or will it just do the selective restore, kind of like Windows 7's setting a restore point, and any rollback should be partial - i.e., it only needs to restore a few files to make the system work fine again, but is it the same as on OS X Lion's Time Machine restore?\nIs restoring a better approach than reinstalling OS X?\n\nA: A Time Machine restore will restore to the last point in time in the backup. A fresh install of Lion will bring your machine to new status.\nHowever, if you do a fresh install and tell it to use the Time Machine backup to restore your data, it will also bring it back to the same point in time.\nSome people [citation needed] prefer to use this opportunity to do a fresh install and then selectively drag the data they want from Time Machine back again.\nHowever, keep in mind that if you set up a new backup, it could overwrite the old one.\n\nA: They are basically the same in the end - one lets you play with the new OS and the other installs and starts the migration. Yes - if you make a new account, you'll have to delete that and the old account you migrate will no longer be the \"first account\" created, but for most people, this is a hidden detail that won't change how they work.\nIf you are looking to isolate why the Mac failed and see if it works again after the re-install, you should take the time to install a clean system and then test. If that works, you will have isolated your backup from the list of potential causes of the issue.\nIf you go for the restore and it's still broken, you won't know if it's a problem with the hardware or your current image. (and then have to re-do the erase and then test).\nThere is no clear winner - it's a guess and you might waste time you don't need if a restore fixes everything. That could be a waste if you still need to run a clean install to determine something has failed and then seek a repair.\n", "Q: Forcing Rich Text by default for iPad/iPhone The company I work for uses an Exchange 2010 server, and we have a fair number of users that have iPads/iPhones as secondary devices.  We use a custom signature rule on the exchange server to sign each outgoing email that is not a reply (first-sent emails).  Unfortunately, the iDevices seem to only send in plaintext.  Is there some way to force them to always send as rich text, or alternatively, some sort of cheap/free alternative app that would do this?  Currently, we are unable to implement the signatures for the whole company (only IT has them at the moment) because they will look like trash coming from iDevices.\n\nA: It has been solved. \nThere seems no native way of doing this on iDevices, for some very strange reason.  \nBut, since they'll automatically encode in rich text if there are any HTML tags placed in the message by the device itself, putting a single space (&nbsp) in the signature via the mail app itself, and then bold/italic-izing said space makes it work.  \n", "Q: Accessing files in a Mac/network share on iOS? While on my home local network, I some times want to access images and plain-text files stored on an AFP network share.\nBut I have not found an app for iOS that allow me to do this.

I consider it as my iOS Finder (by lack of better solutions, sadly).\nIt supports a wide range of protocols and web services such as AFP, WebDAV, FTP, SFTP, Dropbox, Box.net, Google Docs, SugarSync, IMAP and POP3. It used to support iCloud as well, but the feature is gone for stability and legal reasons.\nIt also makes it easy to upload an annotated version of a file at the same place you downloaded it.\nOh, and if you want to access all of your Mac files, SFTP is the way to go.

The new MacBook line has a new turbo boost added to the processor:\n\n2.3GHz Quad-core Intel Core i7, Turbo Boost up to 3.3GHz\n\nWhat exactly does this mean? From what I've heard, the processor can runs above the clocked speed for a short period of time. (source) How does it work?\n\nA: As simply as I think it can be put: it overclocks the CPU without needing the user's interaction. This overclocking is done to meet computing demand. \nMore info here: http://gizmodo.com/5917500/what-is-intel-turbo-boost\n\nA: Turbo Boost is built into the Intel CPU. By default the processor runs at 2.3Ghz, and when under heavy load, it will automatically speed up the cores up to 3.3Ghz.\n\nIntel Turbo Boost Technology 2.0 is activated when the Operating System (OS) requests the highest processor performance state (P0).\nThe maximum frequency of Intel Turbo Boost Technology 2.0 is dependent on the number of active cores. The amount of time the processor spends in the Intel Turbo Boost Technology 2.0 state depends on the workload and operating environment.\nAny of the following can set the upper limit of Intel Turbo Boost Technology 2.0 on a given workload:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Number of active cores\n  \n*Estimated current consumption\n  \n*Estimated power consumption\n  \n*Processor temperature\n  \n  \n  When the processor is operating below these limits and the user's workload demands additional performance, the processor frequency will dynamically increase until the upper limit of frequency is reached. Intel Turbo Boost Technology 2.0 has multiple algorithms operating in parallel to manage current, power, and temperature to maximize performance and energy efficiency. Note: Intel Turbo Boost Technology 2.0 allows the processor to operate at a power level that is higher than its rated upper power limit (TDP) for short durations to maximize performance.\n\n(Source)\nYou can also view a video from Intel here\n\nA: Turbo Boost is a feature that, when fewer than the total number of cores are being used, the processor can turn off the unused cores and increase the clock speed on the rest of the cores. This increases performance (the cores that are being used get faster) and can reduce power usage.\nFor instance, if you have the 2011 MacBook Air with the 1.6 GHz Core i5 (as detailed in this AnandTech article), the \"Turbo Ratio\" is set to 0047. The number sets the amount of boost by digit (4 cores = 0, 3 cores = 0, 2 cores = 4, 1 core = 7; this is a dual-core CPU, so 3- and 4-core mode is irrelevant). The number specifies the boost in 100 MHz increments above the listed clock speed, so if two cores are running, they can be boosted to 1.6 GHz + 400 MHz = 2.0 GHz and if one core is running, it can be boosted to 1.6 GHz + 700 MHz = 2.3 GHz. \nTo see what your system is set to, go to Console and open the kernel.log (or system.log in Mountain Lion*), then search for AppleIntelCPUPowerManagement and look for \"Turbo Ratios\". The Mac I'm on now (a 2.0 GHz Core i7 MacBook Pro), for example, has Turbo Ratios set to 6689 for a maximum clock of 2.9 GHz when using only one core.\n* thanks to @gentmatt in the comments below\n\nA: This app works great on OS X 10.9 to see a graph of your CPU's clock speed:\nhttps://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-power-gadget-20\n", "Q: Safari can't connect to https Safari suddenly can't connect to any HTTPS site because it \"can't establish a secure connection\".\nThis is on an administrator account, not a managed account.\nA different administrator account is able to use Safari with HTTPS, so must be something specific to my account, but I have no idea what.\nGoogle Chrome has no problems connecting to HTTPS sites.\nThings I have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*emptied Safari's cache\n\n*deleted Safari's preferences\n\n*reset Safari entirely\n\n*repaired Keychain (no errors found)\n\n*deleted Keychain (didn't help)\n\n*repaired permissions in Disk Utility\n\n*rebooted\n\n*hoped it would suddenly fix itself\n\n\nAll of the google results I saw suggested either repairing the Keychain (which I tried and which did not help) or were only applicable if there were \"Parental Controls\" involved, which doesn't apply here.\nIf I had to guess, I would think that wherever Safari is checking for \"certificates\" is somehow corrupted, but I could be wrong. I'm not even sure where to look for those - maybe ~/Library/?\n\nA: This just reared its ugly head again, this time with Yosemite.  It also affected all of the browsers I commonly use (Firefox, Chrome, Chrome Canary).  \nI tried to follow the advice here, which involved getting information about the root certificate used by the offending website via the web browser:  How to fix: Safari can’t open the page because Safari can’t establish a secure connection\nI got no love here, since every browser refused to negotiate a connection far enough to get the name of the certificate issuer.

The above method doesn't work.\n\n*The test: Run the iPhone or laptop using cellular connection or mobile hotspot instead of the suspected WiFi or wired network.\n\n*The result: If the cellular connection works and the non-cellular doesn't, then suspect a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, or a corporate proxy that looks like one.\n\n\nA: A report on forums.macrumors.com seems to be fairly similar to yours. This happens as well in Safari 5.1 and is very recent.\nThe solution was to delete:\n~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.security.plist\n\n\nA: For me, it was a screwed up HSTS.plist. Removing that file solved that problem for me for multiple domains:\nrm Library/Cookies/HSTS.plist\n\nThen logout and login again (just restarting Safari won't do the job).\nAbout HSTS: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security\n\nA: I had a similar problem and found that the date on my computer was wrong and thereby all security website certificates were expired. I simply adjusted the date backwards and worked flawlessly. \nKept saying cannot establish a secure connection (because the security tag was outdated on the website...) This also will effect all apps that use time/date such as email apps etc...\n\nA: Deleting the ~/Library/Cookies/HSTS.plist file and restarting my browser worked for me.\n\nA: Reviewing and changing the certificate trust settings appropriately in Safari worked well for me.\nI had this \"can't establish a secure connection\" problem with HTTPS connections from Safari when I updated the self-signed certificate on a NAS. \nThe NAS forces HTTPS connections by choice.\nI'd already connected via LAN to the NAS and encountered the certificates and told Safari to 'trust'. \nTrying to connect via the NAS's DDNS look up gave the problem.\nChecking the certificate trust settings showed the certificates were only trusted for the LAN IP. Easily changed.\n\nA: Problem: Safari can't get secure connection.\nSolved: After going through other blogs, finally solved by deleting keychain log in password.\n", "Q: Why is OS X indexing *again*? For some reason, OS X thinks it's a good idea to reindex my entire hard drive (which takes it a few hours) about twice a week. This is really getting annoying, especially since it does this on battery, and drains it quickly.\nThere's nothing suspicious in the Console, when I grep for mdworker it only gives:\n6/12/12 6:04:40.870 PM com.apple.launchd.peruser.501: (com.apple.mdworker.pool.0) Throttling respawn: Will start in 2 seconds\n6/12/12 6:11:19.769 PM mdworker: CFPropertyListCreateFromXMLData(): Old-style plist parser: missing semicolon in dictionary.\n6/12/12 8:26:59.774 PM mdworker: CFPropertyListCreateFromXMLData(): Old-style plist parser: missing semicolon in dictionary.\n\nThere's also a huge number of these errors (about one every 5 seconds):\n6/12/12 8:29:25.000 PM kernel: SMC::smcReadKeyAction ERROR F1Mn kSMCBadArgumentError(0x89) fKeyHashTable=0x0xffffff800a715000\n\n(I posted a different question about that here)\nWhy is it indexing and how can I stop this annoying behavior? Why would it ever need to reindex the entire drive? Every sane indexing program only indexes new files. I don't see why would it need to reindex the whole drive, and I certainly don't see why it would need to do this twice a week.\n\nA: I found my disk was indexing a lot a few months ago, probably more than twice a week. Finally tracked it down to Backblaze - it turned out that backblaze creates a lot of temporary files as it backs up, especially if you're working with lots of small files (which I do, being a programmer). Spotlight would see those changes and initiate a re-index causing my fan to kick in and the laptop to get hot and burn through battery-life very quickly. Adding the /Library/Backblaze directory to blacklist in Spotlight's settings fixed the problem.\nI've also heard people can have the same problem if they have a very active Dropbox account.\nIf you're doing any video editing this can also be a cause; adding the working directories to Spotlight's blacklist should help. Or, basically, any app that creates a lot of files outside of the OS's temp directories.\n", "Q: Kernel SMC::smcReadKeyAction error I just looked in the OS X Console, and noticed that there's a huge number of errors looking like this:\n6/12/12 8:33:16.000 PM kernel: SMC::smcReadKeyAction ERROR F1Mn kSMCBadArgumentError(0x89) fKeyHashTable=0x0xffffff800a715000\n\nThere's one almost exactly every 5 seconds.

Now I'm trying to manage what syncs to my iPhone from the device itself rather than having to do it from iTunes on my machine. I checked out the Remote app, and while that hooks up to the library, I'm not able to select anything to sync. \nIs this even possible, or if I want to add any media from my library to my device do I need to select it in iTunes directly and then launch the wireless sync?\n\nA: My understanding is that you must be on your computer to select which media you want transferred to the device. After manually dragging media to your device or setting up what should be transferred under the correct tabs (i.e Music, Videos, etc.), you must then initiate a sync. I believe wifi sync to be, in short, the same as a USB sync, only over wifi instead of USB, minus a few features such as restoring a backup.\nOne note - you have probably already figured this out, but after your phone is plugged into USB, don't eject it, just unplug it. Wifi sync will work properly if just unplugged and not ejected.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro HD/SSD Dock mount drives as read/write Ok, so just bought myself a dock so I can wipe some drives and use others as storage. Most of these drives originated from windows Machines and thus are formatted NTFS and not FAT/FAT32\nCurrently I can dock the drives with little to no issue what so ever. However the one issue I do have is the fact that these drives are mounting as read only. I can take the files off of the drives I think, if I need to.\nNow I guess my question would these be read only because they are NTFS formatted drives, or is there another reason? If there is other reason, is there any means I can get around read only attributes. Or am I going to have to format the drives somehow? How would I format them to a useable medium if they are read only?\n\nA: Natively, Mac OS X cannot write to NTFS formatted volumes.  There are downloads like NTFS-3G which can enable you to read/write to NTFS partitions, but I've had mixed success with them.\nIf you want to format the drive so you can perform read/write operations and want to boot from it, please follow this link.  The format you want drives in is HFS+ (Mac OS X Extended Journaled).\n", "Q: How is the System Keychain secured in OS X? I'm looking for something either like this security white paper for iOS except for OS X or even better, some kind of security audit report from an independent expert.  After reading through documentation like the Keychain Services Programming Guide I'm even more confused about what is vulnerable to an adversarial attack on an unencrypted backup of an OS X System.\nLast time I checked, the user's login keychain under OS X was about as secure as the password.  I recall some issue that shrank the actual secrecy of the key to something like 111 bits (foggy memory, please feel free to correct me) due to some issue with how the password is converted to a key, but that was a long time ago and hopefully that's been fixed.\nOn the other hand, I've been told the System Keychain is inherently less secure because any administrator can access it and an intruder has many options for becoming an administrator besides guessing a single user's password.\nIn particular, I'm worried about storing passwords used in automated scripts in the System Keychain as the system files are backed up and stored off-site without further encryption.  Documents and other user data are encrypted before being taken off-site, but I have a nagging suspicion that there's a path I'm overlooking that recovers those keys once the System Keychain is compromised (due to our procedures, not necessarily any cryptographic flaws).  So I want to have a thorough understanding of how the System Keychain is simultaneously secured yet accessible to any administrator.\n\n*\n\n*How are the keys architected such that any administrative user can unlock the System Keychain?\n\n\n*Are there cryptographic restrictions that limit what an administrative user can do with information in the System Keychain in any way?\n\n\n*Given an unencrypted system backup without /Users, how would you gain access to the keys in the System Keychain?\nI'm interested in OS X 10.5 Leopard and later versions, but specifically limited to desktop or laptop Macs without a T2 chip or secure enclave. Apple's Spring 2020 Platform Security Whitepaper explains pretty well that the critical keys encrypting keychain data are stored on the T2 chip and the T2 chip itself manages and applies ACLs which restrict access to the decryption functionality. So on those computers, as with all iOS devices, the keychain database is tied to the hardware and cannot be used on a different device.\n\nA: System Keychain\nThe System Keychain has some unique capabilities. These are documented by the systemkeychain manual page. The mentions of the master password are likely to be your focus. The system keychain specific source code is small and available.\nThe System Keychain, /System/Library/Keychains/System.keychain, is a special Keychain for Apple and daemons to use. You should generally avoid using it for user level scripts.\nCode Review: Keychain\nApple published the source code for the Keychain and security framework for Mac OS X 10.5; you can review this code to discover how it works.\nAlternative Approach: Separate Keychain\nYou can create a separate Keychain to store your script's credentials. We recommend this practice to our customers. You can use the command line tool security to access, extract, and manage your Keychains without resorting to a graphical interface.\nConsider storing the passwords for your automated scripts in a separate Keychain – and exclude this Keychain from your off-site back-up.\nI appreciate removing the Keychain from your back-up is not ideal but it would address your concerns. On restoring the Mac, you would need to get the Keychain back from a different source; may be more trusted source or side channel.\nYou could always store the separate Keychain's password in the System Keychain. You could then unlock the separate Keychain from a script. If the back-up is attacked, you would only expose the password to the separate Keychain and not the Keychain itself as this file is not with the off-site back-up.\n\nA: Apple recently published a document outlining its security practices, you may find some answers there.  The document is specific to iOS but a lot of the security features have much in common with OS X.\n\nA: The system keychain is stored in /Library/Keychains/System.keychain and the key to unlock it is stored in /var/db/SystemKey (its default file permissions are readable by root only). The location of these files is referenced in the security-checksystem script (from the security_systemkeychain source). It is even possible to test to automatic locking/unlocking of the system keychain by using\nsystemkeychain -vt\n\nThe keychain security framework allows non-privileged programs to make requests for information provided they are in the ACL stored within the keychain entry. Obviously if a user has root they on a system they can directly access both the file storing the system keychain and the key to unlock it, thus they do not have make requests via the security framework and are not beholden to the ACLs stored within the keychain itself.\n(I didn't actually answer the original questions so let's give this another go)\n\nHow are the keys architected such that any administrative user can unlock the System Keychain?\n\nThe libsecurity keychain framework allows regular processes to interact with the system keychain in an authenticated manner using Apple's XPC interprocess communication framework (IPC).\nProgram A sends a request to access the system keychain information using IPC. A check is made that the requesting user is already in the wheel group and also knows the password of a user in the wheel group. Once authorization is confirmed, the privileged kcproxy daemon can be used to access material in /var/db/SystemKey, unlock the system keychain and return the requested information.\n\nAre there cryptographic restrictions that limit what an administrative user can do with information in the System Keychain in any way?\n\nNo - an administrative user is allowed to access/change anything in the system keychain. Even if they couldn't, they could copy the underlying files to another machine on which they have complete control and just unlock/access it there.\n\nGiven an unencrypted system backup without /Users, how would you gain access to the keys in the System Keychain?\n\nIf the backup contained copies of /Library/Keychains/System.keychain and /var/db/SystemKey then I would copy them to their respective locations on a new OS X system and use systemkeychain to make the later unlock the former and dump the keychain database using security dump-keychain.\n\nA: I don't have specific knowledge of Keychain* but this is a pretty standardized practice.\n\n\n*\n\n*You want to protect plain text file \"foo\". Foo may be of arbitrary size.\n\n*Create a symmetric key to encrypt foo.\n\n*Encrypt the symmetric key with a key seeded from a passphrase.\n\n\nOnce that's done you can change the \"password\" by entering the current passphrase, decrypting the symmetric key and then encrypting it with the new passphrase. This avoids lengthy decryption/encryption processes in the event that \"foo\" is very large.\nSo how does this work for multiple users who need to access the plaintext of foo? Pretty easy really, you simply create an encrypted copy of the symmetric key once for each user. In other words, do step three for each user.\nIn practice all of this is abstracted away from view and the end user only needs to deal with their own password.\nWith regard to part 3 of your questions, the users' keys are not stored in their home. They would most likely be stored in /private/var somewhere. So even without /Users someone who formerly had access would be able to unlock the system.\n\n*It is possible that Keychain works different.\n", "Q: AirPlay with just iPhone and Apple TV Can I stream things from an iPhone to an Apple TV with no additional equipment (i.e. no wireless router)?

Naturally, the \"native\" double-detail resolution is 1440x900. But what other resolutions can be used? And how crisp are they? (Are they just up-/down-scaled @2x graphics?)\n\nA: Supported resolutions\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Retina, Ratio 16:10\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*2880 by 1800 pixels\n  \n  \n*scaled, Ratio 16:10\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*1920 x 1200 pixels\n  \n*1680 x 1050 pixels\n  \n*1280 x 800 pixels\n  \n*1024 x 640 pixels\n  \n  \n  \n  According to the official tech specs by Apple.\n\nHow does the scaling work?\nAccording to an article in AnandTech:\n\nSelecting any of these options gives you the effective desktop resolution of the setting, but Apple actually renders the screen at a higher resolution and scales it to fit the 2880 x 1800 panel. As a result of this scaled rendering, there can be a performance and quality impact. \n\nThere is a new option to configure the resolution in the system settings. While you actually change the resolution, Apple only refers to the visual impact of the settings.\nSo basically changing the resolution offers:\n\n\n*\n\n*Large text, but much crisper.\n\n*More space for visual content (and smaller text), but not as sharp.\n\n*Something in-between (default retina).\n\n\n\n(original picture from AnandTech)\nNote:\nDue to the imprecise definition of \"retina display\", this answer may seem confusing, because at the top Apple speaks of 2880x1800 as retina, but the picture suggest something different.\n\nA: This also gives a good understanding on how it works: http://www.slideshare.net/MarkRiggan/retina-display-textures\n\nA: Another clear answer is obtained from using a Windows OS on a Mac. So, in terms of pure Hardware support (the other answers gave great summaries of software-answers, and I am by no means advocating or bashing Windows-on-Mac solutions, just giving the pure-hardware capabilities of the MBP w/Retina), the resolutions are:\n2880x1800\n2560x1920\n2560x1600\n2048x1536\n1920x1440\n1920x1200\n1920x1080\n1680x1080\n1600x1200\n1440x900\n1400x1050\n1366x768\n1280x1024\n1280x960\n1280x800\n1280x768\n1280x720\n1152x864\n1024x768\n800x600\nFrom this, it seems the max resolution is 2880x1920, not 2880x1800, but I cannot verify that. It seems like the maximum horizontal resolution is 2880 and the maximum vertical resolution is 1920, but not both at the same time. Further investigation would be nice.\n", "Q: How important is it to support older versions of iOS? Not sure if this is better suited for here or for Stack Overflow - a commenter on a post dealing with similar (though not identical) topic on SO suggested that it would have been better to post it here.  If this is wrong then I apologize.\nI hope you will excuse this somewhat of a philosophical question.  I'm an independent/individual iOS developer.  Recently, the one device I keep around for iOS 4.x compatibility testing (an iPod touch) gave up the ghost -- and I am having a devil of a time trying to replace it.  Of course new devices all have iOS 5 on them.  So one would think to hit up the used market.  But alas this is proving fruitless.  Even the used market is proving little help, as most sellers think it helpful to upgrade to the latest and greatest before putting them up for sale.  And after yet another day spent fruitlessly plowing through eBay search results, I finally had to sit back and think to myself:\nHow important is it to continue to support iOS 4.x?\nIt seems (at least if these blog posts are to be believed) that pretty much everybody is on iOS 5 these days, since it is still supported on even fairly old hardware; and that supporting older iOS versions will run you up against the law of diminishing returns, as supporting iOS 4 is both costly and largely unnecessary.  At the same time, I look at the new stuff we got to play with in iOS 5 (and soon we'll have even more toys in iOS 6) and I can't help but drool.  ARC alone looks like it will save me quite a bit of headache.  (Hey there retain/release, don't let the door hit you on the rear on your way out)\nSo I guess what I'm asking you is, as a user, how important is iOS 4 compatibility?  Did you upgrade to iOS 5, or are you still running iOS 4.x on any of your devices?  And/or do you know anyone still running iOS 4.x?  (The stereotypical tech-unsavvy parent comes to mind)  Any and all comments/advice/practical real-world experiences/etc. you can provide is greatly appreciated.\n\nA: It is indeed more of an opinion question, but here's my 2¢ anyways. I've heard a lot of talk about it, and it's an important question. Before I continue, let me note, that I think after iOS 5, people will be even more likely to upgrade quickly because of OTA updates, and my guess is the absorption rate of iOS 6, for example, will be far greater then previous major releases. This said, chances are, by the time you release your app and iOS 6 comes out, iOS 5 will likely quickly take the back seat, possibly making iOS 4 even less popular (except for older devices).\nOne key area is the client base that you intend to go for. If, for example, you are building an app that would most appeal to kids in school, or other people that have a higher possibility of being given devices, it would be important to build for iOS 4. This is because my understanding is that many schools are picking up 1st gen iPad, and older iPod Touches, as well as older iPhones. These obviously will only run on iOS 4. I think that is the main thing that will keep iOS 4 on the pie chart - older models.\nIf you are building a game or something that may appeal more to people that are more technically savvy, it would probably be a much better choice to go with iOS 5. As for other \"normal\" apps for the general user, valuable resources such as ARC likely will make iOS 5 the better option. I haven't written an app (yet, hopefully), but from what I hear, ARC is hard to pass up, not to mention all the other APIs that you get. \nHaving talked to developers that still work with iOS 3 and 4, I hear that it is a royal pain, and you will have to expect to spend more time (and consequently money) in the developing stages of the app.\nPersonally, if I was to program an app, I'm confident I would do iOS 5. From what I hear, iOS 4 is left to people building apps for schools, for example, as well as apps that larger companies that have more cash to work with put out as they obviously want everyone to be able to use their app.\nHere is another interesting thought while on those lines - instead of build for iOS 4, why not localize your application, and make it available in some other countries? This would be a way to reach a significant greater number of users.\nAgain, just my thoughts, but hopefully somewhat helpful.\n\nA: My take on this is that you must consider a couple of factors in deciding what devices and OS levels to support.  The first is that an elderly iOS device still commands a greater level of desirability that for older devices for competitors, and can retain a value at ages where an Android phone will often be recycled or thrown away.  As such secondly, there is a large market in \"hand me down\" devices.  I've no figures to back this up, but I am willing to bet that there are way more iPhone 3G devices kicking around than you would expect.  These devices often stay in the family, often tied to the same Apple ID, so it can be particularly annoying when an App you already own stops working.\nI have iOS 3 and 4 devices (an iPhone 3G and an iPod) that are both in daily use, one as a phone actively, the other as a learning toy for my child with counting/alphabet apps on it (mainly to stop her using my own phone, and because the device had no particular use).\nI have found numerous apps that no longer support these devices, when there seems no particular reason for them not to from a functionality point of view, however I agree that if you are producing a new App, I see no reason why you shouldn't choose support the newest OS, especially when you consider that the iOS 6 is going to cover 4 generations (!) of iphones when it is released on the next phone later this year.\nBut if your App was originally released on iOS 3.0, then I would try to keep it working on 3.0, and if new features require 6.0 APIs etc, then it's time to fork those changes into a new version allowing the old one to still work.\n", "Q: How I can start mongodb automatically?

I've noticed that opening the 'Date & Time' dialog from System Preferences will trigger the clock to resynchronize to Apple's time servers. I am running OS X 10.7.4 Lion on an 8,2 MacBook Pro.\nWhat might be causing this lack of automatic resynchronization?\nEDIT: I compared my /etc/ntp.conf file to a peer's also running Lion, and we noticed that my file contained:\n0000000: 7365 7276 6572 2074 696d 652e 6170 706c  server time.appl\n0000010: 652e 636f 6d2e 0a                        e.com..\n\nwhile his had:\n0000000: 7365 7276 6572 2074 696d 652e 6170 706c  server time.appl\n0000010: 652e 636f 6d                             e.com\n\nHis last modification date on the was mid-2010, while mine was last modified only a week or two ago (around when the issue started?).

Is there a way to globally disable AirPlay on a Mac OS X (10.6 or 10.7) system?\n\nA: Unfortunately, Apple hasn't provided an easy way to disable this functionality. However you can deny global access to the application that provides AirPlay mirroring by changing its unix permissions\nIn order to disable AirPlay mirroring, we have to deny the computer access to the application that allows the computer to AirPlay mirror: Fire up a terminal and enter the following command:\nsudo chmod 000 /System/Library/CoreServices/AirPlayUIAgent.app/Contents/MacOS/AirPlayUIAgent\n\nEnter the administrative password and restart the Mac afterwards. If you try to AirPlay mirror to an AppleTV now, the AirPlay icon will stay blue, as if it's still trying to connect but it never will. \nThe only disadvantage is that it locks up the menubar. The user won't be able to use any of the menu bar items after they tried mirroring the screen. You're still able to adjust the volume using the keyboard, though. Logging out and back in will restore the functionality of the menubar until you try to use AirPlay mirroring again.\nTo eliminate the temptation of using AirPlay you can hide the AirPlay icon by opening System Preferences > Displays and unchecking the \"Show mirroring options in the menu bar when available\" checkbox. You will need to repeat this step for every user on the system.\n\nA: It appears you can use managed preferences (MCX) to disableAppleTV:\n\n..but that will only affect iTunes, and I don't have an AppleTV on hand to test.\n\nA: Turning off airplay is done using Airport Utility app. Select the device click the edit button and you will then see a dialog box with various options.

Since the pixels in the new display are dense enough that they're imperceptible at a normal distance, doesn't that obviate antialiasing?\n(Assuming that the game is running at full 2880x1800 resolution, of course.)\n\nA: Antialiasing could still play a part in making the rendered scenes look their best, but, yes, the retina display probably obviates most of that. \nAs with AA on a non-retina display, it's a tradeoff between the processing resources used and how much better it looks, and that's something only you can judge for yourself. You may find that some AA looks good, but that more-intensive AA isn't necessary.\n\nA: In a 3D environment, you will see objects at varying distances, colors, lighting, and other types of scenery that will always make aliasing apparent at any resolution in any game with a lot of \"hard\" edges, or edges/shapes sculpted using fewer polygons.\nIn my opinion, antialiasing is always required for optimal viewing quality, but this requires substantial hardware at merely \"high\" resolutions.\n", "Q: Mac App Store - how to check which account was used to buy app I'm trying to update Growl, however App store says \"To update this application, log in with account which was used to buy this application\".

Restore the receipt backup from your desktop to\nit's previous location.\n\n*Repeat the process until you've found the problem receipt.\n\n\nA: It's probable the developer of that app (growl) has used the same bundle ID so that the app store version and the downloaded version appear the same to the app store. \nBasically, you may not have even \"bought\" the app, but downloaded it. \n", "Q: How can I get Siri to list all relationships? As can be seen in this screenshot: \n\nSiri seems to be able to list all of the relationships which it understands.\nDoes anybody know the command for this? I've not been able to work it out.\n\nA: Ask Siri \"Who am I?\", and then scroll down.\n\n\nA: I don't know how to make Siri display a list, but you can see all of your relationships on your contact card. Just go to Contacts and select your name, and it will display all of your relationships too.\n", "Q: Why does Force Quit Applications freeze? When an app freezes on my app, I will press Command ⌘+Option ⌥+Esc ⎋ to open the Force Quit window.\nHowever, this will often take minutes, and clicking on the Force Quit button freezes the Force Quit window and makes the beach ball appear. The window confirming the force quit only shows once the application unfreezes.\nAlso, if I right-click the Dock icon while the app is frozen, then the Dock will freeze, but it doesn't freeze when I just pass over the icon.\nIt is also possible to move the application's windows.\nSo how is it possible for some tasks not to be frozen, while the most important task (the Force Quit window) freezes at any interaction? And what do you do when the Force Quit window itself freezes?\n\nA: The Force Quit window usually freezes when the system is paging heavily. (Same with the Dock.) Your computer could probably do with more RAM.\nYou can move windows around when they're frozen because OS X's window manager isn't frozen, and it controls basic window functions like minimize and move.\n", "Q: Is there a full-featured Mac email app that natively implements labels (instead of folders) and archiving? I love Gmail's features, but I'm increasingly wary of having my entire email history depend on Google. Every Mac email app I know of, other than Sparrow, insists on being based around IMAP folders. Different clients integrate with varying levels of smoothness with Gmail, but at their cores they still use the file-it-or-delete-it paradigm.\nSparrow, of course, was designed as a lightweight Gmail client. It understands Gmail's labels, and it understands archiving, but it depends on the Gmail web interface for lots of core email features (filters, etc.), and I don't know how much of its Gmail-ness is lost if you use it with regular IMAP accounts.\nWhat I want in an email app is this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Native Mac app\n\n*Implements labels itself for all supported account types, not just Gmail\n\n*Allows archiving as the default \"I'm done with this\" action, even for unlabeled mail\n\n*Handles any discrepancy between these features and the underlying email protocol (IMAP, POP, whatever) under the covers with as little leakage into the interface as possible\n\n*Has all the usual power features that exist in other apps like Mail and Postbox\n\n*For bonus points, stores email on disk in some format that isn't a complete binary black hole\n\n\nIn general, I want my email to act like Gmail but live on my computer; and no matter what happens on any server anywhere, as long as I have a backup of this app's archive files, I should be able to move them to another computer, install this app on it, and have 100% continuity with zero fidelity loss. It's okay if the app DOES use Gmail as a back-end, as long as I don't lose any data fidelity if Gmail's entire database disappears.\n(Making such a setup work with mobile devices is a whole other problem, but I'll gladly deal with that tomorrow for this app today.)\nSo: I think what I've described is sufficiently difficult (dare I say \"unfeasible\"?) that it doesn't exist yet. I would love to find out that I'm wrong. Am I? If not, what's the closest thing to this setup that can be had on the Macintosh?\n\nA: I have two backup recommendations. Although these are not apps you'd use to manage your mail, they do backup your account to your system so you can use whatever management client you like (e.g. Sparrow, Mail, etc.). \nI use getmail by Charles Cazabon to back up my entire Gmail account silently in the background. The emails are backed up into a large .mbox file, accessible by any number of mail clients. This also makes it easy to move your entire account from one machine to another, or to restore. The program says it works with any IMAP account - support folders, labels, etc. I only use it with Gmail.\nA second backup option is Gmvault. There's a Windows GUI installer but for OS X one still needs to go to the command-line. Again it backs up your Gmail account (the sync option) and stores the emails locally on the file system. Emails are stored individually as .eml with an accompanying metadata file. You can manipulate those files as you like without messing up the gmvault functionality. There's also a restore option, and it's suppose to handle IMAP discrepancies with Gmail well, although I've never encountered any problems there that (of which I'm aware).\n\nA: You can do what you want if you are willing to work on the command-line. See email clients and indexers such as notmuch, mutt-kz, alot, and sup. I think sup has a GUI, but it is likely to be not very Mac-ish.\nAdditions to Apple Mail may also do what you want, but are not designed to do this from the ground up the way GMail and notmuch are designed. See Mail Act-On and MailTags 3\n\nA: Have you looked at Mailplane already?\n", "Q: Can iCloud synchronize contacts from Windows Mail? Can I sync my Windows Mail contacts into iCloud?  \nI don't use Outlook for Windows, only Windows Mail.\n\nA: I'm Michael and I work for connex.io and we do just that.\nconnex.io is an app that can sync, de-duplicate, clean and up-date your Address Book automatically. This means that you can sync between different devices such as your iPhone and Windows Live mail easily. Not only that you can sync it with a lot more devices and services (such as Facebook for example). You only have to connect them once and everything will be done for you automatically.\n\nA: No, it's not possible.\nInstead of syncing to iCloud, you can add your Windows Live Account as an email account, and choose \"yes\" for syncing contacts and calendars. This will sync your iPad and iPhone with the information saved on your Live Account. But that will only work if you have that on your account, not in the Windows Mail application.\n", "Q: Can I use a foreign power cord to power my MacBook? I have a MacBook Pro computer and I will be traveling abroad to Hong Kong for studies. The electric sockets and voltage are different than here in the US so I would have to use a converter but it is a big hassle carrying around a power converter everywhere I go... I'm hoping to find another solution. If I purchase a HK MacBook Pro power cord will it work with my computer which I purchased in the US?\n\nA: Yes, the MagSafe power adapters support dual voltage (100-240V).\nAccording to the specs on Amazon for the 85W version:\n\nInput: AC 100V~240V 50/60Hz\n\nSo long as the local input provides power in that range, you'll be able to get a local MagSafe compatible cord and your US MBP will be fine.\n", "Q: After a Time Machine restore, now it won't do incremental back up Due to the Thunderbolt 1.2 update, I had to restore from a Time Machine Backup, but after that, Time Machine won't do incremental back up any more.\nThe hard drive has 250GB of free space... It was 1TB and is used for backing up the iMac 27 inch which has about 700GB for the Mac partition (the other 300GB is for Bootcamp).\nSo after the restore, it won't incrementally back up any more.  It would try to back up everything from scratch and will fail because it tries to back up about 600GB into the 250GB free space and will stop.\nIs there a way to make it work again?\n\nA: Four options are available for you - none of them is a clear winner that works in all cases:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try to force the issue with the command line tmutil inheritbackup command\n\n*Ditch the backup history and start over (not good, but quick)\n\n*Use a tool like BackupLoupe and see if you can thin space on the drive to make enough room for the \"estimated\" amount of storage for the next backup.\n\n*Baby sit the backup, by excluding most of the drive and unexcluding it in less than 250 GB chunks.\n\n\nThis last option has gotten me over the hump several times when clients cannot afford to lose their backup. I image their backup drive before starting (just in case) and then use the Time Machine System Preference options to exclude most of the drive. The first option is the most precise if you are comfortable with the terminal application and command line tools.\n\nBy excluding everything except perhaps /Library and /System you should be between 10 and 30 GB for the estimated size of a Full Backup and Time Machine will let you make a new backup. Then the trick is to slowly remove items from the exclusion list in stages to not have the next backup estimate exceed the remaining free space on your backup volume.\n", "Q: Texting and phone I am texting is asking for my name I have my neighbor's phone number and he said that I could let him know if I needed any help moving.  When I went to text him, it seemed like his phone required my name or it wouldn't let me text him. First of all, how would his phone do this? And, second, why would I have to give a name?  Is this my iPhone 4 doing this or his phone?\n\nA: It sounds like you are just trying to send a regular text. \nHere's how to do it:\nOpen the Messages app, (tap \"Messages\" in the upper left corner if you are in a thread), tap the compose icon, enter the recipients phone number (I've never had it ask for my name), then type your text.\nIf you are using the Messages app, it should not ask you for your name.\n", "Q: Can not burn 1.4GB data into a 4.7GB DVD (file too big) I'm trying to burn 1.4GB of data into a 4.7GB DVD using Finder in Mac OS X 10.6.8 Snow Leopard.

My Mac doesn't have a TPM chip, but does an iPhone have of a TPM chip or how do I determine if the iPhone has a TPM chip or not? On my Mac, I use this command to check if TPM chip is there or not: ioreg -x | grep TPM.\n\nA: I'm assuming that your TPM reference stands for \"Trusted Platform Module.\"\nAccording to Wikipedia:\n\nDue to legal restrictions TPMs may not be deployed in a number of\n  countries. Possible reasons for these legal restrictions include the\n  fact that state security services may not be able to access data or\n  keys secured with a TPM.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*China\n  \n*Russia\n  \n*Belarus\n  \n*Kazakhstan\n  \n\nSince Apple sells iPhones in China (see this NY Times article), we can infer that the iPhone doesn't ship with TPM chips.\n\nA: See https://www.apple.com/business/docs/iOS_Security_Guide.pdf especially the part about the 'Secure Enclave' coprocessor.\nAll the Apple S2, Apple A7, and later A-series seem to have such a co-processor.\nAs stated here it's essentially a TPM: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10918999\nThough I guess you could still argue that, especially when not knowing the exact architecture and inner workings of this chip.\nI can't (couldn't, see below update) find any mention of a \"... unique and secret RSA key burned in as it is produced ...\" (Wikipedia, 2017) inside the enclave processor for example. But I guess you could do more research ;)\nUpdate 2-11-2021:\nBelow is a quote / excerpt from the 'secure enclave' description page.\n\nRoot Cryptographic Keys\nThe Secure Enclave includes a unique ID (UID) root cryptographic key. The UID is unique to each individual device and isn’t related to any other identifier on the device.\nA randomly generated UID is fused into the SoC at manufacturing time. Starting with A9 SoCs, the UID is generated by the Secure Enclave TRNG during manufacturing and written to the fuses using a software process that runs entirely in the Secure Enclave. This process protects the UID from being visible outside the device during manufacturing and therefore isn’t available for access or storage by Apple or any of its suppliers.\n\n\nBTW:  I'm not sure if (and how) the presence of the 'Secure Enclave' chip inside iPhones might be affected by the legal restrictions that country's have as @JW8 so clearly states in his answer.\n\n", "Q: Mac Pro (Early 2008) periodically crashes in unusual way, requires reinstall Update 07/10/13: I have traced this problem down to symbolic link corruption.  Eventually a symlink in one of the system components (frameworks, etc.) gets corrupted, which could explain the unusual (and in each case different) system-wide failures.  This see to affect a fair number of people.  Current working theory is that there is a bizarre bug introduced around 10.7 Lion that affects volumes greater than 2 TB in size, that eventually causes symbolic links associated with most frequently used software to corrupt themselves.  Third party software does not seem to affect this, people have seen this problem even on \"vanilla\" systems.  The only commonality appears to be volumes >= 2 TB in size.  Repartitioning to volumes < 2 TB seems to do the trick.  Here are two threads discussing the issue at the Apple Forums.\nMac Pro (Early 2008), 2x Intel Quad-core Xeon 3.2 GHz (8 cores), 14 GB RAM, 3 TB hard drive, NVIDIA GeForce GT 120 and/or ATI Radeon HD 4870), OS X Lion 10.7.4\nOK, I've got a weird one here.  Every few days (could be as short as two or three days, could be as long as up to several weeks), my machine crashes in an unusual manner.  Examples:\n\n\n*\n\n*The first time this happened, any attempt to play a video file (either from within iTunes or externally using Quicktime) would result in a blank, black video window, but I could still hear the sound from the video.  If I moved my mouse within the black window I'd get playback controls and when pressed, I could hear the audio rewind/fast forward/etc. (but of course the video window would remain black)  Also, any attempt to use screen sharing would result in a completely white window where the remote screen should be.\n\n*Another time this happened, I would constantly get the error message that VTDecoderXPCService quit unexpectedly, even if I wasn't playing a video.  Trying the suggested fixes from https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3193904?start=15&tstart=0 did not fix the issue.\n\n*Another time this happened, the machine appeared to work fine, except any attempt to access System Preferences resulted in the spinning beach ball of death and would completely lock up the machine.\n\n*Another time this happened, the machine still appeared to work OK, but graphic updates were REALLY REALLY SLOW (noticeably jerky animation when, e.g. moving between desktops or jumping to Mission Control or Dashboard)\n\n\nIn all cases, rebooting the machine does not result in the problem being fixed -- in fact, it gets worse.  After I reboot, I am unable to log in to my machine at all. Either the desktop window flashes briefly but then it goes back to the login screen, or the login screen never appears.  I have tried both the \"guest\" account as well as a standard \"test\" user I set up when I first installed OS X (i.e. a \"clean\" user), and none of those help.\nWhat does help, however, is doing a reinstall of OS X Lion (including running the combo updater to get back to 10.7.4).  Once I do this, the machine becomes usable again, and in fact runs perfectly, and I can use it error-free for a few more days to a few more weeks - after which it fails again in some strange manner.\nAt first I thought my hard drive might be failing; however replacing the hard drive did not help.  I then thought that I might have a glitchy graphics card (the black video windows and the VTDecoderXPCService crashing suggested this to me).  However replacing the video card didn't help either.  (I tried another GeForce GT 120 as well as an ATI Radeon HD 4870, both of which were known to be good in other machines).  I have also tried countless times fixing permissions, clearing cache files, etc. and none of that helps.  The only thing that brings this machine back from the dead is, like I said before, reinstalling OS X - but only for a little while.\nI didn't see anything out of the ordinary when checking the system log files.\nIn case there was some sort of hardware problem going on, I tried running Apple Hardware Test overnight in loop mode.  The hardware passed all checks.  I also tried running Memtest86+ overnight, again with no failures or errors.\nThe machine doesn't seem to me to run particularly hot - typically temps hover in the 40-45 C range, and can jump to 55-60 when doing heavy activity (mostly video encoding).  Voltage levels look good as well.  (I'm using iStat Menus for both the temperature and voltage readings)\nI posted this message in the Apple support communities, and someone suggested I run the following commands and post their output:\nkextstat -kl | awk '!/com\\.apple/{printf \"%s %s\\n\", $6, $7}'  \nsudo launchctl list | sed 1d | awk '!/0x|com\\.(apple|openssh|vix)|edu\\.mit|org\\.(amavis|apache|cups|isc|ntp|postfix|x)/{print $3}'  \nlaunchctl list | sed 1d | awk '!/0x|com\\.apple|edu\\.mit|org\\.(x|openbsd)/{print $3}'  \nls -A /e*/mach*  {,/}L*/{Ad,Compon,Ex,Fram,In,Keyb,La,Mail/Bu,P*P,Priv,Qu,Scripti,Servi,Spo,Sta}* L*/Fonts 2> /dev/null  \nosascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to get name of every login item' 2> /dev/null\n\nWhen he looked at the results, he noted that I was running SIMBL, and suggested that may be the problem.  However, removing SIMBL had no effect.\nI'm about at my wit's end here.  Unfortunately the machine is out of warranty (AppleCare, too) and I don't really have the money to take this into a shop and get it diagnosed.  So does anyone have any ideas?\nBelow I've attached the output of the commands I mentioned earlier (just ran it a few minutes ago).\nOutput of: kextstat -kl | awk '!/com\\.apple/{printf \"%s %s\\n\",

All, So I was able to fix the issue.\n  I spent a few hours on the line with a number of people at Apple support, eventually had to send the script and computation history to apple engineers, they called me back today with a solution.\nThe problem is caused by a corrupt video file, in my case it was an mp4 file. And because the file was on the desktop, each time I restarted, or opened a finder window that opened to the desktop folder, the error would pop up.\nI deleted the file and the problem seems to have been fixed.\n  Next time you have it pop up while navigating finder, check the folder that you just navigated from or to. Check for video files. The easy way to tell which one it is, is from the thumbnail. In my case, regular file thumbnails show the first frame of the video in question. Whereas the corrupted file shows a default video logo image (Like Quicktime logo, or likely whatever your default video player is).\nHope that helps,\n  Cheers.\n  TheDabblingDilettante.com  \n\nSource\n\nA: Thanks all for your suggestions.  Turns out that my crashes and instability were due to symbolic links getting corrupted.  There are a LOT of symlinks in OS X, especially within frameworks; and when a framework gets screwed up, really odd things can happen.  Reinstalling the OS effectively reloads the system from a known good state, so fixes all the corrupted symlinks, which is why reinstalling made things work again, for a while at least.\nTurns out I am not the only person to experience this, although it seems to be very rare, it has happened to some others.\nNow I'm not going to say that the problem has gone away for sure lest I jinx myself, but I haven't seen this happen in a while now.  Not since 10.8.2, possibly 10.8.1.  So it is possible that Apple may have silently fixed something.  keeps fingers and toes crossed\n\nA: Sounds like your installation is broken, as this is typical of a driver issue, as the hardware is ok.\nMake a Time Machine backup of your current computer, and then reinstall OS X and tell it to restore your user.  This should help quite a bit.\n", "Q: Enabling AHCI for SSD under Win7 BootCamp on Macbook Pro 2011 I've just installed a new Samsung 830 256GB SSD and have configured BootCamp with Lion and Windows 7.\nUnder Lion, I have installed Trim Enabler.\nUnder Windows 7 I have installed the Samsung (Wizard) software that came with the SSD. In this software I've applied all of the recommended optimisations under 'OS Optimisations', however, the Samsung wizard software is informing me that AHCI is not enabled at present and for best performance, this should be enabled.\nI'm not sure a) what implications there are if it's left disabled (will it affect the lifespan of the SSD or is it purely a speed thing?) and b) if there is a way under BootCamp for an Early 2011 MacBook Pro to have AHCI enabled?\nI was also concerned that if AHCI is not enabled, perhaps TRIM won't be enabled either? However, I did run a tool which I found online that said that TRIM was enabled on this Windows 7 install (despite AHCI not being enabled).\nThis is my first SSD drive so am not very familiar with the technology, terminology and best practices etc.\n\nA: You can't.  Apple has implemented a Compatibility Support Module (CSM) into the Mac firmware that emulates the PC BIOS specification.  Since the Mac firmware is not 100% UEFI compliant, that CSM is the only way Windows can boot on a Mac.\nUnfortunately, the ACPI tables in that CSM are just the bare minimum necessary to allow Windows to boot and nothing more. You lose several features when using it:\n\n\n*\n\n*No graphics switching (always uses the discrete card).\n\n*No AHCI support (SATA devices are in IDE compatibility mode)\n\n*\n\n*No support for TRIM\n\n*No support for Native Command Queuing (NCQ).\n\n\n*No support for advanced power management features (only basic S1, S3, and S4 states are supported).\n\n\nBasically Windows sees your SSD as just a really fast IDE hard drive.  This will not affect the SSD in terms of lifespan.  It may, however, make the SSD a little slower over time than it would otherwise be when running Windows.\nNOTE:  Some people have reported that they have been able to install Windows 7 in UEFI mode on a Mac, which would enable all those missing features.  However, it cannot be done on your model.  I've tried.  With sufficient hacking you can get it up and running, but it's plagued with audio and video issues.\n\nA: You can sacrifice sound or sleep mode and use the AHCI (it is extremely fast), but there isnt way to make it fully functional so far. So now I am using bootcamp and IDE. \nProblem is with the emulation of the BIOS, its too old.\n\nA: Uninstall TrimEnabler, windows does have it automatically, and when it does not work in the Windows partition, it does not work at all. It is still not sure which SSD Controllers are not working well with trim enabled. Marvell is not having any problems; but the Garbage Collection nowadays is so good that Trim does not contribute. Make sure that the SSD has enough free space, say 20-40GB.\n\nA: In windows go to Control Panel\\System and Security\\System, click on the \"windows experience\" link and \"Re-Run the assessment\" this will update info about the drive and enable trim.\n", "Q: Sandboxing prl_disp_service to prevent disk waking So there is prl_disp_service, a Parallels 7 background service that periodically wakes the internal hard drive in my Macbook Pro although it`s unmounted most of the time since I boot from an SSD I replaced the DVD drive with.\nFor reference: http://forum.parallels.com/showthread.php?t=114974\nIs there a way to apply some sandbox-exec profile to this process so it will continue functioning normally but won´t see /dev/disk1* and do stat or something else on it that causes it to wake up?\n\nA: Yay, I managed to sandbox prl_disp_service \\o/\nI put a file named prl_disp_service.sb into /Library/Sandbox/Profiles denying ioctl on disk1 (the harddisk I wanted to prevent from waking):\n(version 1)\n(allow default)\n(debug deny)\n(import \"system.sb\")\n(deny file-read* file-ioctl\n    (regex \"/dev/disk1*\"))\n\nAnd edited /Library/Parallels/Parallels Service.app/Contents/Resources/ParallelsDispatcherService:  \nsandbox-exec -f /Library/Sandbox/Profiles/prl_disp_service.sb \"${ParallelsDispatcherService}\" -e --logfile \"${LogFile}\" --pidfile \"${PidFile}\" >/dev/null 2>&1 &  \n\n", "Q: Full screen ad on iPhone in place of lock screen I own an iPhone 3GS and use it as personal hotspot for my MacBook Pro via USB.  \nThe iPhone is running iOS 5.1.1, and the MacBook is running a Mountain Lion preview.   However the question is not about Mountain Lion, nor is specific to Mountain Lion, so please bear with me.\nThe iPhone was in the locked mode and connected to the MacBook via USB when I pressed the lock button. However, instead of the usual lock screen and slide button, the iPhone showed a fullscreen ad:\n\n(Ironically, it advertises a game called “Worms: Reloaded”.)\nI was somewhat terrified by this so I didn't tap the image at all, and instead held the poweroff button. On choosing “Cancel” on poweroff confirmation screen, I was able to get back to my lock screen.\nI don't know what would happen if I tapped the image, neither do I know if this was just an image or an executable. It's kind of funny that the ad says to push OK (YES) button, but there is no such button on the screen. I decided I don't trust this interface because of strange arrow positioning in the top left button so I didn't tap Cancel.\nMy phone is not jailbroken.\nBy the way, there has been a similar question without a screenshot but I'm not sure it is exactly the same thing.\nMy only guess now is that I have MMS enabled, and maybe there is a kind of MMS messages \nthat show up on the screen without being saved (like flash SMS), and maybe my carrier decided to spam me. I'm also downloading a malware scan software for OS X.\n\nA: I get these messages when I connect to the China Unicom network. I think the \"Cancel/Accept\" dialog is hardcoded into iOS for the purpose of accepting the carrier's terms of use. These messages come from the sim card, and I think only the carrier can send them. It's sleazy for the carrier to use this functionality for advertising.\n\nA: It's a special type of SMS called a \"Flash SMS\" or \"Class 0 SMS\" (nothing to do with Adobe Flash), which doesn't get saved in your InBox and is deleted as soon as you Dismiss it.\nAs explained here:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/2365606\n\nA: This is quite strange. One thing's sure, that iPhone is definitely not locked. When you connect your iDevice to a computer, it'll usually start charging; it'll only lock when you actually lock it yourself. \nI've also never seen this kind of MMS display. Based on the Cyrillic, however, what the carrier does may be different than where I am (these things vary from country to country, basically).\nThere's also the remote possibility that, through iOS's restrictions and security features, a virus slipped through. \nOr, it could just be completely random.\nEither way, try resetting your iPhone's settings, then post an update.\n\nA: This is along shot but it coud be some sent you that image via bluetooth and the prompt is asking if you want to accept the image of not?  You were in a crowded public place?\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 13\" SATA controller Does anyone know from a trusted source if the new MacBook Pro 13\" (2012) has SATA III? \nOn Google, some places said SATA II and couldn't find any info on Apple's site. \nI also have one more question: if I connect an SSD (external case) on USB 3.0 will it be faster than a 5400 RPM on USB 3.0?\n\nA: Panther Point has 6GBit/s ports. There is zero reason for Apple not to utilize them. I know this is not a perfect answer but this is all I can help.\nSSD is much faster on USB 3.0 than a HDD. I would recommend reading this -- disregard the UASP part, it still gives you lot of benchmarks of running an SSD over USB 3.0. You can clearly see speeds well above 200 MB/s. There is no mechanical (notebook) drive that can do much more than 100 MB/s. Not the Savvio, not the Spinpoint M8, nothing. It simply doesn't and cannot happen.\nEdit: StorageReview mentions this Hitachi DeskStar being the fastest mechanical drive of all and it barely clears 150 MB/s.\n", "Q: Extracting zip does not store files in \"today\" in Finder I have a Mac OS X Lion 10.7. I downloaded a zip file from the internet which shows up in \"Today\". However, after extracting the zip file, it puts the contents in \"earlier\". is it possible to show the contents in \"today\" ?\nThis is very unusual because for some extracted files, it shows the files in \"today\" and other files, it shows \"earlier\"\n\n\nA: By unzipping the archive you did not modify any file or folder in it, hence the original creation and modification times are used.\nIn your example the Finder only sees \"7 October 2009\" as modification date for jquery-form-validate.\nThe only way to achieve what you want is to use a tool that updates all the modification times when

I know in OS X you can't go down (for now) to really (non retina) at 1440x900 and also in Windows (for no new bootcamp driver) you can't; but I see how in the gaming sessions you can choose the 1440x900, how does it look compared to a standard MacBook Pro display with a 1440x900 native resolution?\nBecause, in theory, it would look identical, without the problem about scaling to non-native resolutions (what happens, for example, when you go to 1280x800 in a display with 1440x900 native resolution), due to the fact who each 4px of retina display becomes exatly 1px at that resolution. There is any one who can try and check this? \n\nA: Images and icons look about the same because of integral scaling. But text in non-Retina apps looks clearly worse. The difference is that on a non-Retina display, text uses sub-pixel rendering. But with Retina, old apps use full-pixel anti-aliasing instead. (Those full pixels are then multiplied perfectly with integral scaling.) Not quite sure what Retina text on a Retina display uses, it's hard to eyeball.\nSeparately, other resolutions look pretty good. The highest is 1920x1200. The trick is they are also rendered in double-resolution (3840x2400) and then scaled down for the display (2880x1800). Because there are so many tiny pixels, the result is acceptable, but the optimal setting is definitely sharper.\nSo Retina apps at 1920 look pretty good, and non-Retina text at 1920 has smaller and slightly fuzzier full-pixel anti-aliasing.\n\nA: Late 2013 13\" Retina is very choppy both at native and scaled resolutions. You can notice the shuttering when resizing apps and going to full screen\n\nA: There are apps that let you use a non scaled (scale = 1), non HiDPI resolutions on the retina Macbook Pros.  Apps like QuickRes and RDM.\nCertain non scaled resolutions like non-HiDPI (2048x1280,1920x1200,1680x1050) look nice, without too much blurring.  Non-HiDPI 1440x900, in my opinion gives too much blurring and hurts my eyes.   \nThe sharpest non-HiDPI is 2880x1800; everything looks super sharp, but it also too tiny to read.  At that resolution there is no blurring.   \nYou can even go 2 resolutions up from that 3360x2100 and 3840x2400.\nMy preferred resolution is 2048x1280; it still has a tiny bit of blurring but it looks really nice and gives you allot of desktop space on the retina.\nSome other benefits to using non HiDPI resolutions on the rMBP are\n\n\n*\n\n*Less overall memory consumption\n\n*Less sluggish UI\n\n", "Q: How to dim non-jailbroken iPhone below dimmest factory setting? At night, in the dark, even at its dimmest setting, my iPhone 4S is still bright enough to annoy my wife.  I've searched all over for an app or setting tweak that would let me go \"dimmer than dim\".  But no app seems able to do that and the only tweaks I've seen are for jailbroken phones (mine is not).  \nDoes anyone know how I can make the screen dimmer?\n\nA: If you find the minimum brightness still too bright for night-time reading, Apple has finally added a screen filter in iOS 8.  Typically Android offered a way to reduce the minimum brightness via apps when the screen was still too bright for nighttime reading even when set to zero but now you can enable this in iOS:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings → General → Accessibility → Zoom.\n\n*Enable Zoom.\n\n*Triple-tap on the screen to bring up zoom options.\n\n*Choose filter: low light.\n\n*Go back to Settings → General → Accessibility → Zoom and change the zoom region to full screen.\n\n*Turn Zoom off.\n\n*Go to Settings → General → Accessibility → Accessibility Shortcut and set it to Zoom.\n\n\nNow when you push your home button 3 times quickly it will dim the entire screen for night-time reading.\n\nA: By definition, the software only allows certain brightness levels so only by modifying that software (jailbreak or perhaps Apple changes things) can you go dimmer.\nThere are many apps that use the colors and draw dimmer text (Instapaper uses black background at night and many stargazing apps only draw in red). You could try using the accessability features to invert the white / black system wide. Even though the screen is still as bright, the largely black screen will block most of the light from escaping. You can even set the triple press of the home button to toggle this rapidly.\nLastly, there are 3M polarized privacy screens (watch for vertical or horizontal privacy - most only work in one direction) to help solve the light escaping to your side issue. \nIf she is seeing the light reflect off of you, you're going to have to look for other options. Psychologically, most people can fall asleep with light, but light and motion or light and noise are much harder to sleep with. Hopefully it's just the light as you might just need to drop the phone or move to another location if it's not really the light that's the source of the irritation.\n\nA: Without jailbreak, it's not possible.\nI can even generalize and say that no app will ever be allowed to modify such system preferences.\n\nA: I often use \"Night web browser by Alex\" when I'm in bed and my girlfriend is trying to sleep. It dims the screen much more then iPhone can normally. \n\nA: You could also invert colors: Settings > general > accessibility > invert colors\nAll white will become black!\n\nA: wait for iOS 6, at least I think the dim function is improved since I installed iOS 6\n( I switched from a Jailbroken iOS 5 to 6 so I'm not 100% sure )\n\nA: I dont know if you are still having the problem, but I use the Dolphin Browser on my iphone and it has a \"night mode\" feature that makes the screen pretty dark. Maybe that would be helpful. Thats for a non-jailbroken phone. I believe it was free also! My phone is jailbroken & I also had the same problem so I downloaded a tweak called f.lux. It doesnt necessarily make the screen dark...it has settings for day & night which have adjustments that give it a dimmer more orangey halogen light for night instead of the bright white like in the new energy saving bulbs. You can adjust that setting along with the brightness setting on your phone to get it dimmer and not so annoying. It will dim everyday at a certain time( like 5 or 6pm) and goes back to your preset day settings in the morning. I found it to be pretty helpful. Im not sure if it can be installed on a non-jailbroken phone though since I got it from Cydia. I can try & research it and let you know..if you are interested. \n\nA: In iOS 8, there is a way to use Accessibility to drop your brightness below the minimum setting (without jailbreaking). I wrote a guide here: https://medium.com/@searls/how-to-make-your-iphone-dimmer-than-dim-d20fd3bbbb66\n\nA: I would think that, since videos are mainly what you're doing, night browser is your best bet. It lets you go very dark and do anything safari can do (including go to YouTube and play your vids in QuickTime player). For just navigating around, if you go into your accessibility settings, you can make it so that a triple-tap of the home button inverts colours-it's a very easy shortcut. \n", "Q: How can I set the priority of Wi-Fi networks on my iOS device? I have two Wi-Fi networks in my house, one at one end of the house and one at the other.  While signals crossing from one side of the house are usually audible on the other side, they are generally fairly weak and quite nearly unusable - something in the house's construction attenuates signals traveling through certain walls.  So, to enable good connectivity while roaming the house, I have to have my Wi-Fi clients configured for both networks.\nThis works fine on PCs where I can configure both networks and set a priority order, so that the system prefers the network closest to its normal location and should only roam when its usual network gets too weak.  However, I cannot find a way to set this priority in iOS.  This results in some devices occasionally connecting to the farther AP, despite being in their regular spot where they should prefer the closer one.\nHow can I customize the roaming preferences for Wi-Fi networks on the iOS devices?  I at least want to assign a \"preferred\" network for each, but would also like to know if there's a way to set a \"roaming threshold\" - a point at which the device should choose to change APs, versus remaining on the current one.\nI'm pretty sure all my iOS devices are running iOS 5 or higher.\n\nA: The answer is Apple's iPhone Configuration Utility. According to one of Apple's webpages, the utility:\n...lets you easily create, maintain, encrypt, and install configuration profiles, track and install provisioning profiles and authorized applications, and capture device information including console logs.\nConfiguration profiles are XML files that contain device security policies, VPN configuration information, Wi-Fi settings, APN settings, Exchange account settings, mail settings, and certificates that permit iPhone and iPod touch to work with your enterprise systems. \nIt's available for both Windows and OS X.\nHere's a tutorial of accomplishing setting a WiFi connection priority configuration to an iPhone.\n\nA: Setting an order of priority for the networks will not help you because the devise will only \"switch\" networks when the other network becomes completely unavailable and it has to reconnect. There is nothing that will indicate that if the signal drops to a certain threshold, search for a more powerful network.  I have a similar situation but slightly different.  \nI have a portable Wi-Fi in my car that has a pretty good range. I have an in-home network whose signal was not strong enough to cover the entire house so I installed a network booster.  It creates a different network segment with a different name (the one I have puts \"AMPED\" in front of the orriginal network name).  So sitting in my home, my device can see 3 networks (the mobile network in my car, the regular home wi-fi, and the \"AMPED\" home wi-fi).  The AMPED signal is almost always the strongest, which is what I would expect.  \nWhen I get into the car with my iPhone and iPad and leave the vicinity of my house, both devices automatically loose their connection to the home network and switch to the mobile network.  When I get home in the evening and walk into the house though, neither device will automatically switch from the mobile Wi-Fi to the home network, because the mobile device remains available.\nI either have to: 1) Remember to turn off the mobile network when I get home.  If I do that, the devices pick the \"strongest\" network signal they have available to them (not from a priority based list).  2) Switch the network connection manually.\n\nA: Unfortunately, at least the current iOS gives us surprisingly (because how much the phone depends on internet) little control over which wifi it connects to. It isn't possible to set priority lists, but what I have done for a somewhat similar situation is Forget wifi's (Wifi > Tap the arrow next to the wifi to forget > Forget this network). This is not a streamlined solution and really wouldn't work if you had solid passwords on both of your routers because re-entering the passwords would be impractical. This is mainly an option that you are likely aware of, although, for you, I'm sure it wouldn't be practical at all.\nI would recommend looking into strengthening a single wifi network. We have used signal boosters that help the signal. Also, just a thought, but I've been really impressed with the signal strength of the Apple Airport. It seems to be really strong.\n\nA: Apple documents the order in which a network will be joined in instances where the iOS device is rebooted and not unlocked as well as when the device is running normally at https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202831\nIn specific, to quote the article:\n\niOS will try to connect to networks in this order:\n\n*\n\n*The private network it most recently joined\n\n*A private network\n\n*A hotspot network\n\nIf iOS finds more than one network, it evaluates SSIDs by security\nlevel and chooses one based on the following order:\n\n*\n\n*Private network: EAP\n\n*Private network: WPA3\n\n*Private network: WPA2/WPA\n\n*Private network: WEP\n\n*Private network: Unsecure/open\n\n*Hotspot network: HS2.0/Passpoint\n\n*Hotspot network: EAP\n\n*Hotspot network: WPA\n\n*Hotspot network: WEP\n\n*Hotspot network: Unsecure/open\n\nIf iOS finds multiple networks of identical type and security level,\nit chooses the SSID with the strongest RSSI.\n\nOnce you know this, you can sometimes choose the settings on your preferred network or refrain from auto-joining some SSID that you know will cause your device to choose a less preferred (to you) network than the system is designed above. As a last resort - being physically closer to your preferred network would raise the RSSI - signal strength in case your device is set up for that to be the tie breaker when it has to choose between two otherwise \"equal\" networks.\n--\nA lot of comments and answers are also about roaming - so if that's your concern, check out the 802.11r FT / Adaptive 802.11r / 802.11k and 802.11v enhancements for roaming in this white paper by Cisco that is designed to take advantage of all of Apple's roaming implementations.\n\n*\n\n*Enterprise Best Practices for iOS Devices on Cisco Wireless LAN - see page 29 in specific\nRoaming is for when you have more than one base station broadcasting the same SSID and you will need to properly place the transmitters so there is overlap between the handful (ideally) of radios and adequate coverage that the device can talk to both base stations when in the middle to make an orderly transition.\n\nA: I'm pretty sure this is not possible to do on vanilla iOS, perhaps with a jailbreak.\nHowever, your solution of running two separate WiFi networks is generally not what you want. It is much more common to extend one WiFi network (i.e. a single SSID) with multiple routers. Devices should then automatically switch to the access point with the stronger signal.\nYou can check this question which describes how to setup two APs for the same network (i.e. a single SSID).\n\nA: Your phone would require to be jailbroken to get \"Vestigo\", a tweak available through Cydia. It does 90% of what you're asking for. I say 90% because you'll need to have a Cydia app called \"wifitoggle\" (at least I think it was called like that) and yet another app called \"Activator.\" Activator is simply an app that allows you to set custom gestures, i.e. two-finger swipe up, or double tap status bar.\nI was in the same boat as you, having my phone as a hotspot for my iPad while on the go, and when I get to either work or home I wanted my ipad to switch over to my house network.\n\nA: If there both on the same LANs give them the same SSID (Name) and your device will connect to the strongest. \nIf you can look at altering he multiplex settings and (if I remember multiplexing correctly) set it to high. \nFor iPhome priority, I think, if your using iCloud Keychain, you can change the preference in your mac, and it should sync over.. Failing this the guy up is right (last used)\n\nA: Creating a single SSID across your two WiFi Routers by no means guarantees that devices will automatically switch to the stronger router. I went to all the trouble of configuring this only to find that a lot of devices hang on for dear life to the router to which they first connected. \nWith a single SSID you can't manually switch to the stronger signal other than by switching off WiFi on the device and then switching it on again. Even then, some devices refuse to relinquish the connection to the weaker router and you have to go through a power cycle.\nIn the end, I have reverted to two different SSIDs and at least then I can manually force a switch to the stronger one if I know I'm going to be on the back-of-the-house/garden network for some time.  \n\nA: I did read somewhere that iPhone's have a \"feature\" where is gives preference to a) the last connected wifi b) alphabetical ordering of the SSID.\nI tried adding the letter \"a\" to the name of the AP I wanted to give preference to, and this seemed to work. The the problem I have now is that it stays connected to this connection too long when the signal is too low and my other AP is in range.\n\nA: The biggest annoyance with running 2 wifi networks with the same SSID is that a device will connect to the stronger signal, which is not always the \"best\" or fastest signal. I find this to be the case with 2.4ghz and 5ghz, where devices prefer the slower 2.4ghz band even when through-put is significantly better on the 5ghz channel.\n\nA: I believe it connects to the most recently seen network, Always.\n\nA: All you need to do is touch the arrow to the right of the network you don't want to automatically connect to and touch \"Forget This Network\".  It won't remove the network from your wifi list, it will just stop automatically connecting to it.\n\nA: first of all having 2 wifi switches or router on each end of the house? This create an signal overlap, to change this you have to put both switches/routers on the middle of the house but, create an aluminum shim barrier on the wall between both units, this will reflect or rebound the signal of the router to each side on the house, maybe the overlap gap will be small enough so you will not notice the interaction of the signal mixing. Once you pass the division of the house the blocked signal of the half you're leaving will be a small signature, then the device will connect to the new stronger signal of the other half of the house.\nNow: Router-interference zone-router.\nInterference zone, by signal overlap.\nNew: Router- aluminum shim wall -Router.\nNo interference, because aluminum shim wall create 2 different wifi zones,\n\nA: Hope you find this helpful\nAlthough it does not seem to work quite as explained...\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202831\n", "Q: How can app file be treated as a file in Package Explorer for Mac OS X? Can I customize Package Explorer to treat a folder as a file?\nActually, I want to keep a .app file in my project as a file. But when I keep it in Eclipse, it is treated as folder.\nCan I change this behavior of Eclipse for Project Explorer? Actually my .app is a file for Mac OS, so it should be treated as file only, which is unfortunately not.\nCan I change it programmatically?\nThis is also posted on Stack Overflow. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11035519/eclipse-how-can-app-file-be-treated-as-a-file-in-package-explorer-for-mac-os\nCan anyone add an eclipse tag also here? I can't as I have less than 300 reputation.\n\nA: You can't talk Eclipse into treating app bundles as files.\nMac apps are actually \"bundles\", which are special folders, not files. The Finder treats them as files, but anything that uses lower-level file system APIs will see a .app file as the folder it actually is. \nIf you look at the appify script on Github, you can see that just making a few plain folders in a specific structure will cause the Finder to treat them as a file.\n", "Q: Bug with regards to .tar.gz in Chrome when 'Asking where to save downloads' Every time I try to download or save a .tar.gz file, I get something like this:\n\nThe popup is simply wrong, I've used the right .tar.gz extension.

However, for the \"Newsstand\" icon, I cannot do it. Is there a restriction on the apps for this function to work?\n\nA: The Newstand app is built to be a more or less a folder of it's own. As you probably have noticed, you can't put folders inside other folders. Because this is a native app on iOS, we don't really know why they did this, but I'm confident it is indeed because of it's folder type style. \n", "Q: MacBook Pro makes a scratching noise? Whenever I pick up my computer and it's on, it makes this horrible scratching sound. Where is this sound coming from? Am i wrecking the computer when this happens?

They can be pushed a little. These sticks hold the aluminum bottom off the logic board and cause the disturbing mechanic noises that your are talking about.\nDo not take any chances and apply insulating tape on every place of the aluminum bottom that the sticks can contact.

I will use it mostly to write code when I'm not at home and I've read that non-native apps look horrible due to the resolution. I was wondering if someone has tried using Eclipse or Zend Studio and if they work well.\n\nA: To enable a retina rendered Eclipse\nFrom: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=382972\nHere's the workaround:\nDo \"Show package contents\" on the Eclipse.app.  Edit Contents/Info.plist using your favorite text editor.  Just\nabove \n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nPlace this:\n<key>NSHighResolutionCapable</key>\n<true/>\n\nThen, make a copy of the app so that OSX will notice the change. \nNow, the info window will not show \"Open in Low Resolution\" as checked.  Launch\nEclipse and enjoy your new retina awesomeness.\n\nA: I went to the apple store for just this reason. I downloaded and installed eclipse on a MBP, it looked awful. It wasn't just me, another programmer was looking at the machine with me and agreed. I called over one of the Apple guys, and he basically said, yup it'll look like crap till it's updated. \nI suggest you try it at an Apple Store. But I found it un-usable (so disappointed)  \n\nA: It should work the same, but each pixel it draws will take up four pixels on the screen. Look at a non-retina app on a retina iPhone or iPad and you'll see how Eclipse will look on a retina Mac.\n\nA: Eclipse will work as it always has, however the text and the graphics on screen for non retina optimized apps will look less sharp. To see a worst case example here is one provided from the MacBook Pro Retina Display Analysis done by AnandTech.  \nOn the left is a non-retina app while on the right is a retina app. \n\n\n\n\nA: I came across your question while searching how to fix the way eclipse displays on the retina mbp. It's not that text renders bad, it actually renders how you would see it on a normal computer. It's just that when you switch from looking at super crisp retina text to looking at ordinary text it's kind of like you put on somebody's light prescription glasses.\n", "Q: What is causing an error with getpwuid in Console, and how can I fix it?

The numeric suffix is the UID. In this case, an application attempted load a launchd job as user 501. That failed, since there appears to be no user 501 on your system.\nHave you installed software recently?

At home I have a USB hard drive that I typically use to read divx from connecting it to my tv that is able to play avi files. I'm wondering if I can connect it to the TC via an Ethernet port (that the external drive has) so that it can stay connected to the tv and I can manage movies wirelessly through the capsule.\nSo:\nMac --> wifi --> time capsule.                    ## CONNECT\ntime capsule --> Ethernet --> HD.                 ## SHARE FILES\nTv --> USB --> HD.                                ## READ MOVIES\nMac --> wifi --> time capsule --> Ethernet --> HD ## TRANSFER FILES\n\nHope this makes sense :)\n\nA: It sounds like your external HD is actually a Network Attached Storage device. If it somehow supports simultaneous access via the network (SMB which is windows file sharing) AND plugged in to USB (to your TV) then that might work out really well. Unfortunately I don't believe that there are devices that can do that.\n\nA: It's not likely the TV will see the files if you attach the drive to the Time Capsule. You'll have to determine how it wants to access files.\nTime Capsule only wants to share files only from a drive connected by USB and only to any network clients. This means that your TV - ethernet - TC connection will not allow the TC to see the drive and re-share it elsewhere.\nHowever, if you want to sequentially connect the drive for a time to the TV and then for a time to the Time Capsule all will be fine with this \"hard drive time sharing plan\" and either the TV or the TC will get access to the drive singly.\nThe Time Capsule is made to share the files to Macs and Windows PC using AFP (Apple's file sharing protocol) and SMB (Windows file sharing protocol), so it's basically can your TV access an AFP or SMB network share over ethernet (or Wi-Fi)? If so, you should be fine.\n", "Q: Can I use my early 2009 iMac as an external screen? I have an early 2009 iMac (24\" version). It has a mini display port in the back. Is it possible to use it as an external screen? If so, how do I do it? And can I attach all kinds of devices, e.g. a Raspberry Pi (with an appropriate adapter cable)?\n\nA: The specifications for the 24\" Early 2009 iMacs according to eveymac.com and the Apple Manual for the Early 2009 series of iMacs does not mention target display mode as a feature.  That unfortunately means that the Early 2009 generation of iMacs did not offer a target display mode so you will not be able to use that displayport output as an input source.\n\nA: Check in the user manual for your particular model for Command-F2 as a shortcut to enter target display mode. \nIf yours has a target display mode, you are good to go. If not, then no.\nI don't think that any 24-inch iMac model supports this. Initially the 27-inch models had this feature and later it trickled down to the 21-inch models.\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcuts for new window in Chrome or iTerm2 Is there any functionality in Chrome, iTerm2, or a keyboard shortcut app that will let me open a new window (Chrome or iTerm2) in a global environment?\nIt should open a new window regardless of whether previous windows exist or not.\n\nA: To make a single hotkey always create a new Chrome window, launch Automator. Tell it to create a new Service Have the service take no input. Assign a single action to the service: Run AppleScript (in the Utilities list of actions).\nHere is the AppleScript:\non run {input, parameters}\n    tell application \"Google Chrome\"\n        activate\n        delay 0.1\n        make new window\n    end tell\n    return input\nend run\n\nSave the service with a name like \"New Chrome Window\". Then, in System Preferences assign an unused keyboard shortcut to the service. You can then create a new Chrome window no matter what application you are in.\nTo improve the service substantially, replace \"Google Chrome\" with \"Safari\". :-)\nTo create a new window in a different scriptable app, replace \"Google Chrome\" with the name of the app you want to create a new window.\n\n\nA: Save these scripts somewhere in AppleScript Editor and assign shortcuts to them with an application like Alfred or FastScripts.\nmake new window or make new document often opens a new window:\ntell application \"Google Chrome\"\n    make new window\n    activate\nend tell\n\nhttp://code.google.com/p/iterm2/wiki/AppleScript\ntell application \"iTerm 2\"\n    tell (make new terminal)\n        launch session \"Default\"\n    end tell\n    activate\nend tell\n\nThere's a bug where shortcuts for Automator services don't always work until the services menu has been shown once from the menu bar. Automator services also have small delays and they don't work when the frontmost application doesn't have a menu bar or a services menu.\n", "Q: MacVim -- switch to tab where file is opened if trying to open an already-opened file Over the course of the day, I often open many tabs/windows open in MacVim, I forget exactly which files I've opened etc.\nThen when I try to open a file I have already opened somewhere, I get something like the following:\n\nSo I have to go look for where I opened the file before, which is annoying (I have to go through all windows one-by-one to find its tab).\nIs there a way to make MacVim just close the tab where I last opened the file automatically when I try to open the file again?\n\nA: You can remap tabnew to tab drop so you will be switched to already opened files or directed to newly created file.\ncnoreabbrev <expr> tabnew getcmdtype() == \":\" && getcmdline() == \"tabnew\" ? \"tab drop\" : \"tabnew\" \n\n\nA: You can use the SwapExists autocmd to take an action when this situation arises. If you wanted to just ignore the message and edit the file anyway you could add the following to your ~/.vimrc\nautocmd SwapExists * :let v:swapchoice='e' \n\nOr if you wanted to automatically recover what was in the swap file\nautocmd SwapExists * :let v:swapchoice='r'\n\nSee the help (:help SwapExists) for more information on your options. They are the equivalent of clicking the options in the dialog that MacVim presents.\nTypically a swap file is created when a separate vim process has the file open with edits. It may not be possible to track down that buffer in that other process, but if it were possible you can have this autocmd trigger the function or command to do it.\n\nA: This is not a complete answer, but combined with @claytron you may be able to get it working.\nLook up the drop command, e.g. :help drop.  I use it in conjunction with tab (tab drop) to open my vimrc in a new tab, or to switch to that tab if it is already open:\nnmap <leader>v :tab drop $MYVIMRC<CR>\n\nSo you should be able to do the following (NOT TESTED: I don't know if % will pick up the filename you are attempting to open, or the file name of the current buffer, but you get the idea):\nautocmd SwapExists * :tab drop %<CR>\n\nThe only thing that remains is to test the difference between a swap file that exists because this instance of vim owns it, or because another instance of vim owns it, or because of a crash.  In cases 2 and 3 you will have an infinite loop.\n", "Q: iMessage falsely reports \"could not send\" For some reason, since Monday iMessage on the iPhone 4S always tells me it couldn't deliver my message but the messages go through.

When I start the X11.app then it launches an xterm automatically.  I've long since switched from the \"ordinary\" xterm to rxvt-unicode so the initial xterm just hangs around like a wallflower never being used.  Whilst it's not particularly bad, it spoils the look of the place so I'd like to stop it launching.  How do I do it?\n\nA: Since I'm not at my OSX computer right now, I'll give you the fail-proof answer for this. 'true' does nothing and exits successfully, so I set that to run at startup.\nApple's old X11:defaults write org.x.X11 app_to_run $(which true)\nand for XQuartz:defaults write org.macosforge.xquartz.X11 app_to_run $(which true)\nand for MacPorts X11.app:defaults write org.macports.X11 app_to_run $(which true)\nIn case you are wondering, $(which true) will make a line read, for example,defaults write org.x.X11 app_to_run /bin/true.I write it as $(which true) because I am not at my mac and do not remember if it is in /bin/true or some other location.\nI have additionally read that you can set these to '' (that's two single quotes, so nothing at all), and it will do the same thing. I have not tried it, though.\n(Source: https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/wiki/X11-UsersFAQ)\n(edited because I forgot the all important 'app_to_run' in my examples)\n\nA: It appears that starting with xquartz 2.8 you would do:\ndefaults write org.xquartz.X11 app_to_run APP\n\nA: defaults write org.macosforge.xquartz.X11 app_to_run /usr/bin/true\n\nin a Terminal.

Or is it treated as an unmodified application, and therefore subject to scaling?\n\nA: Apple's Java 6 JRE will support HiDPI, however it is not currently supported by Oracle's Java 7 JRE. It also doesn't work under the latest dev builds of Java 8. Swing and JavaFX apps are blurry on a Retinia MacBook. This is why IntelliJ still runs under Java 6. Eclipse applications will require the PList mode that Jurriaan Mous mentioned. The milestone builds of Eclipse 4.3 don't require the edit. \n\nA: From: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=382972\nHere's the workaround:\nDo \"Show package contents\" on the Eclipse.app.  Edit Contents/Info.plist using your favorite text editor.  Just\nabove \n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nPlace this:\n<key>NSHighResolutionCapable</key>\n<true/>\n\nThen, navigate to the folder Eclipse is stored in and execute\ntouch Eclipse.app\n\nto make macOS notice the change.\nNow, the info window will not show \"Open in Low Resolution\" as checked.  Launch\nEclipse and enjoy your new retina awesomeness.\n\nA: I just tested this on my MacBook Pro with retina, so the answer is yes and no - at least under Mountain Lion.\nIf you use Java directly from the command line, the answer is yes: it will launch in HiDPI and render text in high resolution. Things rendered using Graphics2D will render in high resolution mode. (So if you render a line 0.5 AWT pixels thick and place it at 0.25/0.75 off an AWT pixel, it will render a single \"retinal pixel\" thick.) Likewise, rendering an image at half-resolution will render it at \"retinal\" resolution.\nSo instead of just g.drawImage(image, x, y, observer) you'd need to do:\ng.drawImage(image, x, y,\n    image.getWidth(observer)/2,\n    image.getHeight(observer)/2, observer);\n\n(Unless you have an odd width/height, in which case you should probably use Graphics2D and just scale(0.5, 0.5) to render a retinal image.)\nIf you use JavaApplicationStub, then you need the answer provided by Matt Solnit, otherwise it will launch in the \"scaled\" mode. (Under Mountain Lion, there are added hoops to jump through related to Gatekeeper, but that's a different question.)\nNote that this answer applies to both Mountain Lion and the Apple-provided version of Java for it (Java 1.6.0_33). It might be different under Oracle's Java 7 for Mac OS X, and it may not work the same way under Lion.\n\nA: It's likely treated as unmodified, given the number of questions asking about how Eclipse looks and how to make it look better. (Eclipse runs on Java.)\n\nA: At the store I wrote a HelloWorld in Swing, and text looked correctly Retina-sharp. (Didn't try SWT, which requires more downloading to setup.)\n\nA: I don't have a MBP Retina, but the VM renders using aqua as far as I know, and therefore should display buttons, sliders, text and any other Swing control with the retina quality.\n", "Q: What does Force Quit do in OS X?

I have three 24\" (1920x1200) Dells that I would like to use on a single setup. With the 15\" retina MacBook Pro having two Thunderbolt ports and one HDMI connector, would it be possible to connect them all up in addition to the built-in display?\n\nA: Yes. Much of the official documentation doesn't explicitly address the HDMI port as adding to the two thunderbolt and built in display, this has been shown to work by several early adopters of the retina MacBook Pro.

I intend to buy a third monitor and cable it via the HDMI port on the right hand side.\nIf you have a lot of cash to spare, you can daisy chain monitors via thunderbolt. In this process you purchase several apple thunderbolt displays and plug one end of the first thunderbolt cable into your rMBP, the other into your first monitor, then use the second thunderbolt port of your monitor to go to the next, and so on. I have seen video on youtube when the rMBP first came out of a guy powering 4 monitors  (5 total including the laptops screen) at full resolution. \nKeep in mind, the more monitors you use, the more of a burden it will be on your machine.\n\nA: You can run 3 to 4 external monitors (4 or 5 including the main screen). This is done through USB. By default you can only have 2 external monitors including your native display. But there is a way to add more.\nHere is how you do it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get a USB to HDMI adapter (this serves as an external graphics card that pulls from your CPU).\n\n*Plug adapter into your USB port\n\n*Plug your HDMI into the adapter and connect to monitor. It's that simple. You can also get adapters for display port, VGA, DVI.\n\n\nThis video demonstrates the steps above.\nhttps://youtu.be/w8gE-ckBwjE\n\nA: The MBP 15\" 2015's Radeon chips lack passive display connections (or timers?).  Pick up an “active” mDP cable and your monitors (3rd) should come to life.  These GPUs only support two passive connections, the rest NEED to be active cables.

I'm not sure if this is possible, but I've looked around for a solution, but never got any where by chance.\nBasically I need to rip or extract audio files from an PC executable file (.exe), there is Resource Hacker for PC but there isn't an equivalent one for the Mac.\nIt would be great if there's a decent app that can do what I wish to achieve - so, is there an app out there that can do this?\nI'm using OS X 10.7.3.\n\nA: Try File Juicer - it extracts images/text/audio/video from many types of files (see this list of supported inputs/outputs). The PC executable type (exe) is specifically listed as a supported file type. It's not a free app, but can be used in trial mode.\n\nA: Try The Unarchiver.\nIt is free, either from its website or from The Mac App Store and it can extract some files from EXE archives.\nIf that doesn't work, I would definitely try FileJuicer (which I own and use and love. It can even 'undelete' pictures on your camera card).\n", "Q: Functionally speaking, where will I see a difference between dual- and quad-core i7s? I am ready to buy a new MacBook Pro. I am drawn to the portability of the 13\" and the better specs of the 15\". If you take money out of the picture I would really like to know where I would see the difference in performance between: the 13\" i7 Duo Core 2.9GHz and 15\" i7 Quad Core 2.3 or 2.6 GHz?\n\nA: The analogy is the choice between having two really fast employees, or having four quick ones. If not a lot is going on, the two fast ones will be tearing things up. But if things are busy, and a lot is going on, having twice as many will really show up.\nNote that with the i7 Quad Core, if you need a lot of speed from one or two cores, you can get it through the Turbo Boost. \nI would lean toward as many cores as possible, because I like to have lots of programs open and be switching in and out. If you like to work on one thing at a time, and if those things aren't all that compute intensive, it may be a harder decision. \n\nA: I own both a 13 macbook pro dual core i7 and a 15 macbook pro i7 quad core. I am an iOS programmer and I can say without any hesitation that the 15 macbook pro is almost twice as fast, especially if you are trying to run multiple apps at the same time. One recommendation is no matter what computer you go with, if you are planning to run that many applications at once I would get at least 8 GBs of memory. \n\nA: FMZ after looking at how you are using you system, aka with 10+ program open, in a development environment, you are going to more than likely have programs that can make use of all those cores, and even if the individual programs don't the sheer number of programs open will be better suited to a quad core. And if you come across flash content in a browser you will thank yourself for getting more cores in that case too, especially with a large number of programs open. \nSo since you are really going to be exercising your CPUs, taking a look at bench-marking results from Mac Geekbench results,  etc will give you a good indication of how much total power you will have at hand. Going from dual core i7 to a quad core i7 is going to offer a noticeable improvement for you.\nOh and don't forget to get more RAM 8GB or more would suite you well. \n", "Q: Can I make a podcast out of any flash video to listen to on my iPod? Is it possible to make a podcast out of any flash video on the web that I can listen to on my iPod?\n\nA: Maybe. \nOne of the reasons content providers choose Flash is that it makes grabbing the video for your own purposes nontrivial. Some sites provide links for downloading video, even if the embedded player is Flash. But I don't think that's what you're asking.\nRealPlayer (http://www.real.com/realplayer/download) provides a free player as well as a program that will run in the background to try to grab Flash video. They also have a free converter program (RealPlayer Converter) for transcoding, if what you capture isn't something your iPod can play. If it's an iPod Touch, then you can play H.264/AAC or H.264/MP3 movies directly. Other formats you'd have to convert.\nIf you are talking an audio iPod, you need to pull the audio out of whatever movie you capture. I would do that using QuickTime 7 Pro, a $29 purchase. There are free alternatives, I'm sure. But taking just the audio from a Flash video is a bit obscure.\n", "Q: What is required for HiDPI mode? I followed the directions in this question.  I've checked \"Enable HiDPI display modes\" in Quartz Debug, and I've rebooted and logged in again, but no HiDPI modes appear.  I've rerun Quartz Debug and confirmed that the checkbox is still checked.\nAre there any other things that need to be set in order for this to work?  Are there any specific hardware requirements for this?\n(I have 2 large displays, for example -- is there a limitation that it only works on single displays?  I can't think of any reason it would be, but I'm out of ideas.)\nEDIT: I found something that suggested you need to log out of all accounts, not just the current one -- maybe something happens when all accounts are logged-out simultaneously?  But I tried that, too, and still do not see any HiDPI modes listed.\nEDIT 2: According to this post, HiDPI can work on the 30\" Cinema display (2560x1600 becomes 1280x800), so that's not the problem.  This screenshot shows HiDPI modes and an \"Arrangement\" tab (indicating multiple displays), so that's not the problem.  It even shows the mythical \"1280x800 (HiDPI)\" mode!\n\nA: As I've mentioned in the other topic...\nIf the checkbox is already enabled, but it doesn't work, disable it, logout when prompted to, login again, re-enable it and at the next login you should find the HiDPI settings in the Displays settings.\n", "Q: How to backup NAS using Time Machine I just purchased a new Iomega NAS IX2-200 4TB. I need to regularly backup this NAS. Time Machine would be the best option. How do I setup so the Time Machine will backup this NAS to my external Hard Drive? \nI don't want to backup my Mac, that's already been done on the Time Capsule. Instead I just want to backup my NAS drive. But I'm not sure how to go about this, as the NAS is a network drive. \n\nA: I wouldn't use Time Machine for this, it is best at backing up your local Mac. The NAS you have has a built in backup function that can use a local USB drive or a network share (as well as other options). So if you want to backup the NAS to a drive mounted on your Mac just set the share up on the Mac then configure the NAS to backup to that share on a schedule. If you really want to use Time Machine you would have to mount the NAS or more likely specific directories on the NAS then include those in Time Machine on the Mac, This article gives good info on backing up several types of network shares to your Mac thru time machine: http://lifehacker.com/5685547/how-to-set-up-time-machine-to-back-up-to-a-networked-windows-or-linux-machine\n\nA: First of all: Is your external hard drive big enough to store the backups? If your NAS has 4 TB capacity, I doubt it. Keep in mind that, because Time Machine keeps old versions of files, a Time Machine backup directory will require more space than the original files. For a (full) 4 TB NAS, I think 8 TB backup space would be adequate.\nIf this is not a problem for some reason, Time Machine will backup every data source that is available in the Mac's folder hierarchy, so just mount your NAS there and you should be set.\n\nA: Time machine does not back up everything the mac has access to. It is also not able to backup network sources in mac's folder hierarchy. At least not out-of-the-box.\nSo when you setup the time machine backups, by default it will disable external USB hard drives connected to the mac. You can however manually override that and have time machine backup a USB drive. You can't do that with network shares though. At least I've not been able to find a way to do that. To my knowledge that's impossible. You can't even see those shares in the tree structure when you use the file browser from within Time Machine.\nI backup my photos on my nas, and I would like to have the option to include that folder with the time machine. I've not been able to figure out how to do that so it seems that it's not an available option.\n", "Q: How will the free update to Mountain Lion work? I am planning to buy a MBP 13\" in the coming days. Although as soon as I buy it I will remove its HD and replace it with Crucial M4 256 SSD. Will that stop me from getting free update to ML? \nIf so, backing up the HD on TM and then restoring from that on SSD would solve the problem ?\n\nA: I suspect it will be serial number based, or model number based.  As the new models will no doubt all have serial numbers and indeed model identifiers (iMac 9,1 for example) that will allow them to clearly identify which machines are applicable, and allow the upgrade as appropriate.\nIn previous \"up-to-date\" schemes it has been this way, and not reliant in any way on what is installed on your drive.\nIf you are transferring to a different boot volume, I would recommend using an image file rather than Time Machine.  You can pick up a USB enclosure for your SSD, image the existing drive onto it, and then simply swap them over - this is how I have done things in similar scenarios.\n", "Q: Managing giant eBook collection with iPad after iTunes update broke compatibility with Calibre? In an effort to upgrade security, a recent iTunes update broke functionality to Calibre - my favorite eBook management tool. Now I am without a way to effectively manage my eBook collection in a organized fashion between my iTunes library and my iPad. I find that although iTunes handles music well, it doesn't manage eBook libraries very well at all.\nHere is message board post describing the iTunes security update.\nDoes anyone know how I can manage my eBook collection so I can keep track of what I have on my iPad and easily sync and manage my hundreds of books? \n\nA: I had the same issue when iBooks got updated. The way I access Calibre when on my iPad is to put my Calibre library in Dropbox. Then, I can just access ebooks in Dropbox and 'Open With…' iBooks, read them, and delete them again. I used to do the same thing but using the CrashPlan app; either would work (it basically depends on what cloud storage system you have the most space with).\nIt's inelegant, but there's no more elegant way that I can think of.\n", "Q: Waking display from terminal, general waking This is a two part question.  A practical, \"how to\" question is first, and then I ask for configuration suggestions.\nFirst, I put my displays to sleep at night, and I would like to be able to wake the display remotely.  Is there a command line utility I can use to wake it via SSH?  I know about WakeOnLan, but that seems like overkill.\nSecond, the whole reason for me wanting to wake my display remotely has to do with how Lion's power savings settings changed.  The Apple infrared remote no longer wakes the display.  This is a huge deal for a machine I originally bought to be a combined desktop/home theater pc, since it defeats half of its purpose.  So, does anybody have any ideas/suggestions what to do about this?  This is open ended, I know.\n\nA: Waking the Display from the Command Line\nFor waking your display remotely, try running an AppleScript on the command line:\nosascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to key code 123'\n\nThis will simulate pressing the cursor key ⬅  and should make Mac OS X 10 believe a user is active on the computer.\nThis AppleScript is based on the answer, How do I automate a key press in AppleScript?\nWaking the Display after Waking with the Remote\nIf you are waking your Mac using the remote and the display is not powering on, try Wake Assist. It is not designed for this situation but might just work.\nWake Assist simulates a mouse click after your Mac wakes up. The mouse is clicked twice in the upper-left of your main display. Wake Assist will do nothing if it detects a user but if the computer wakes and is idle, then the mouse is clicked for you.\n\nA: The easiest way to do this over SSH is to use caffeinate  -u (available since OS X 10.9 I think) to simulate user activity. \nAdd the flag -t 5 to specify a timeout of 5 seconds (else you'd have to ctrl+c out of caffeinate, it seems).\n\nA: wuc wrote:\n\nYou can use\npmset schedule wake \"01/01/2012 20:00:00\"\nto wake up a sleeping display on an otherwise \"awake\" Mac. Replace the date/time part with current time of course.\n\nHowever, that didn't work for me on a circa 2008 iMac running 10.9.1 or a late 2010 MacBook Air running 10.9.2. I'm not sure if this has something to do with Mavericks' energy management or the hardware, or what.\nI was able to get it to work by setting the wake time to be 15 seconds into the future. Occasionally I was able to get it to work with the setting as low as 12 or 13, but not reliably. But there may have been other factors I didn't realize at the time, but 15 worked, so I used 15.\nBut how do you calculate 15 seconds into the future programmatically?\nI used gdate from the GNU Coreutils package (date in OS X might be able to do this, but if it can, I don't know how, and I already had gdate installed):\n[to use date instead of gdate use alias set_wake_time='date \"-v+${OFFSET}S\" \"+%D %T\"']\nHere's the script I used:\n#!/bin/zsh -f\n\n# how many seconds into the future we want to wake the display\n# 15 seems to work reliably.

Replace the date/time part with current time of course.\n\nA: Oh, how I wish I had enough rep to upvote @wuc's answer the 10 times it deserves for this maddeningly frustrating problem (or to at least be able to leave a simple comment with the praise it deserves). \nApple, in its paternalistic wisdom, added a \"feature\" that intentionally made it harder to wake the display on Lion and Mountain Lion.  This has made life much harder for those desiring to remotely wake the display (using IR remotes or via VNC) to interact with their Macs .  For some reason, this became more pronounced with OS X 10.8.2.\nUsing pmset was a marvelous workaround for me. \nStep 1: Login to the remote machine using ssh myname@192.168.1.2 (replace with an appropriate username and ip for the remote Mac).\nStep 2: Wake up the display using pmset schedule wake \"06/27/2013 04:20:00\" (with an appropriate future date of your choosing).\n\nA: Option if you don't want to use gdate:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enable SSHD (Remote Login) under System Preferences, Sharing\n\n*Enable 'Wake for network access' under System Preferences, Energy Saver\n\n\nput this code in a file like 'wakeup.sh' in your home folder:\nshopt -s expand_aliases\n#NB: 7 is the waiting interval. Works for me. Increase as needed. \nalias myDate='date -v+7S \"+%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S\"'\necho MacBook will wake up at: `myDate`\necho yourMacPW | sudo -S pmset schedule wake \"`myDate`\"\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Make it executable with 'chmod +x wakeup.sh' and enter your password if you like. Otherwise drop the echo and -S. \n\n\nIf you want to automate this process to work from a windows machine:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get PuTTY and a command line WakeOnLan tool (ie Aquila on SourceForge)\n\n*Make a one line text file containing './wakeup.sh'\n\n*write a batchfile like this:\n@echo off\nc:\ncd \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Aquila Technology\\WakeOnLAN\"\n:tryAgain\nwakeonlanc.exe -w -mac 00:00:00:00:00:00\nping 192.168.1.101 -n 1 | find \"unreachable\"\nif %ERRORLEVEL% EQU 0 GOTO tryAgain\ncd C:\\putty\nputty.exe -ssh 192.168.1.101 -l yourUser -pw yourMacPW -m c:\\putty\\macWake.txt\n\nThings you need to change: your IP, your MAC address, the word 'unreachable' may not be what you get - you might get 'timed out'. Storing a root password in plain text is of course, not a good idea, but this how to do it completely automatically from Windows to OSX. \n", "Q: Bootcamp over external USB drive Is it possible to use boot camp on external drive? I would like to install windows on an SSD connected using USB 3.0 and boot from there. Has anyone done it ? Any problems with that ?\n\nA: Boot Camp will not install to an external drive, (pg. 6) but you might be able to clone a Windows system to the external volume; not sure if a Mac will support booting it via USB 3.0 though.  I'd say you should wait for the next Boot Camp update which will likely bring USB 3 support (and hopefully native drivers for all the new Mac models introduced at WWDC 2012).\n", "Q: Unable to install Xcode 3.2.6 in Mac OS X version 10.7.3 My old app is made in Xcode 3.2.6 and now I have purchased a new Mac with Mac OS X version 10.7.3.

There are cases where they happen to work, or can be made to work with some expert tweaking, but in the general case developers are much better off migrating their projects to a supported release of the developer tools.\nOne common misconception many developers have is that they have to use the older tools to support their users on older OSs. This is only true if you are still supporting PowerPC users... in which case you're much better off sticking with PowerPC hardware to produce those builds.\nBased on your tags it looks like you are an iOS developer. The latest version of Xcode can still target any version of iOS, IIRC.\n", "Q: Running one more display when MacBook is in clamshell mode I was wondering if anyone has tried running one more screen off their MacBooks by closing the lid of the MacBook. This is a common practice of many Windows laptops that support only 2 screens but have multiple video outputs.

This possibly may not work because of bandwidth limitation of Thunderbolt, not that the video card can't handle it.\nClarification: The configurations I list are what should happen if my hypothesis is true. I am asking for people to confirm this by using thir own MacBooks since I do not own this hardware to test.\n\nA: Here is some documentation.\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT5219?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US#dispnum\nSpecifically this, noting the footnotes.

What if you don't do such a fix, then what will happen?  (why is the fix not built into the Time Machine restore?)\n\nA: The permissions fix is to Open Disk Utility, select your boot disk and run the Repair Disk Permissions\n\nWhat this does is compare the permissions of the files and directories installed by Apple to what is expected and changes them if needed.\nIf you have just installed OSX and then installed from a good backup then all the files will have the correct permissions and will not change anything.

I would not run this as if there was a difference between expected and actual permissions I would want to know what it is and work out what action broke the set up and fix that error and fix that action.\n", "Q: Why is my Advanced Add Printer mode disabled? I am using a Unibody MacBook Pro on Lion. I am trying to add a networked printer at work so I can print to it, but OS X is not cooperating with me.\nTypically for adding networked printers on a Windows network, most instructions online suggest you open the Print & Fax preference pane, hit the + button to Add Printer, then use the Advanced tab to select the type of networked printer, and type in a specific URL to reach it.\nI would like to follow these steps, but I am unable. As you can see in the screenshot below, everything under the Advanced tab in the Add Printer window is disabled. \n\nI don't understand how or why this is. My user definitely has full administrator privileges, and this tab of all the others in the dialog should be open-ended and allow you to type and search for printers to add regardless of environment, or perhaps what OS X may have already detected as plugged-in or over Bonjour.\nI have searched the web for any indication of why this area of my Add Printer dialog is unusable, but have not been able to find any clues. Any tips to get this thing unstuck are appreciated.\nP.S. My connection to the Windows network at work seems to be fine. I am able to mount and use several of the shared network drives over SMB.\n\nA: Hey I ran into the same problem. If you turn off System Preferences -> Sharing -> Printer Sharing the advanced tab becomes enabled again.\n\nA: Try:\nsmb://workgroup/server/sharename\n smb://server/sharename\n\nA: The 'Add' button on MacOS Big Sur is disabled if it doesn't like the url. Be sure the \"Type\" that matches your print server url is selected.\neg: The default \"Type\" is \"Internet Printing Protocol\", which expects a url starting with \"ipp://\". If your print server's url starts with \"http://\", the Add button will be greyed. If you select \"Internet Printing Protocol (http)\", you'll find it enabled and can add your printer.\n\nA: just right click on the \"add toolbar\" and the go to customize toolbar\" and add it from there..Done\n", "Q: Why do I have 8.3 GB mail on my hard drive even when using gmail? I am short of space on my 128 GB SSD so I've been using Grand Inspector to see what has been using up all this space. I found that in Library/mail/v2 there is 8.2 GB of email. \nWhat is this and how can I get rid of it considering that I use Gmail and have all my email in the cloud?\n\nA: Why, because Mail.app keeps a local copy of your mail (in case you are offline, and to avoid downloading 8.3 Gigs of mail every time you use Mail.app).  The reasonable way to go about the issue is to \n\n\n*\n\n*sort your mail and remove stuff you neither need/want anymore, then\n\n*Stop using Mail.app and use GMail online if having local copies of your mail bothers you\n\n*you could disable your GMail account, delete all your mail, then you can create a second GMail account, forward there ONLY the emails you'd like to have on your laptop and set up this 'private important account' in Mail.app for local offline access.\n\n\nThe fact that your mail is in the cloud means that it is on your laptop -- GMail would not go to Apple Cloud by itself.  \n\nA: This is a feature of the default set up of Mail.app on OS X. It is storing all your messages for \"offline viewing\" you can turn this off.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Mail > Preferences click on Accounts\n\n*Click on your Gmail account on the left\n\n*Then click on the Advanced tab.\n\n*Under \"Keep copies of messages for offline viewing\" set that drop-down to \"Don't keep copies of any messages\" '\nAlso make sure that you gmail e-mail account is setup as IMAP and not POP3 you can see the type under the \"Account Information \" tab.\n\nA: You can configure the way Mail.app handles local copies in the definition of the mail account:\n\n", "Q: Is there a hotkey/shortcut for Print to Web Receipts folder? I love the \"Save PDF to Web Receipts Folder\" in Safari and use it all the time. The only minor annoyance is that it takes a few steps (cmd+P -> click \"PDF\" -> select \"Save PDF to Web Receipts Folder\") to use it. Is there a way to setup a hotkey/shortcut for it so that it just takes one quick key combo?\n\n\n\nA: Create a very basic Automator Service Applescript with GUI Scripting.

Is it possible to have a pre-retina Application have good retina text. As in MenuBar text, and textbox and textfields and other text locations as long as the original developer used native OS X text handling API's. \nFor applications that do their own graphics and text rendering we know that there is a difference when trying to run on a Retina display as noted by the MacBook Pro Retina Display Analysis (see AnandTech comparison picture below).\nThe example of Non-retina Google Chrome vs Safari is noted to be a worse case caused by Google doing their own thing for rending text / graphics in the Application. Does this imply that if your not doing your own text rendering you get retina text for free?\n\n\nA: Applications using standard Cocoa APIs should get retina text for free. \nThis was the same way it was released with the iPhone 4 in iOS. If you used standard UIKit, you basically got it all for free, and just had to update resources, etc.\nSo, with a Retina MBP as of right now, many apps need to add @2X resources (for things like images, etc), but otherwise standard applications should render all other content as retina. \n\nA: There is an app which forces retina text for non-retina applications.\nhttp://retinizer.mikelpr.com\n", "Q: Kinesis Function Key Bindings I've a Kinesis Advantage Pro Keyboard and am using OS X Lion. I want to bind the function keys to what they are on the MacBook Pro - i.e. controls for brightness, mission control, etc.\nHow can I do that?\n\nA: Check this question on SuperUser: https://superuser.com/questions/403493/kinesis-advantage-os-x-media-keys\nHave you noticed sluggishness/hanging using the Advantage in Lion?  I've had issues with the shift key sticking (not physically, but it's like CAPS LOCK is on until I hit shift again), and delete key taking multiple presses to work, and other weirdness.\n\nA: I have added this to private.xml in KeyRemap4MacBook:\n<autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::COMMAND_R, KeyCode::COMMAND_L, ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L | ModifierFlag::CONTROL_L | ModifierFlag::OPTION_L</autogen>\n<autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::KEY_1, VK_CONTROL | VK_OPTION | VK_COMMAND, KeyCode::VK_CONSUMERKEY_BRIGHTNESS_DOWN</autogen>\n<autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::KEY_2, VK_CONTROL | VK_OPTION | VK_COMMAND, KeyCode::VK_CONSUMERKEY_BRIGHTNESS_UP</autogen>\n<autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::KEY_6, VK_CONTROL | VK_OPTION | VK_COMMAND, KeyCode::VK_CONSUMERKEY_MUSIC_PREV</autogen>\n<autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::KEY_7, VK_CONTROL | VK_OPTION | VK_COMMAND, KeyCode::VK_CONSUMERKEY_MUSIC_PLAY</autogen>\n<autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::KEY_8, VK_CONTROL | VK_OPTION | VK_COMMAND, KeyCode::VK_CONSUMERKEY_MUSIC_NEXT</autogen>\n<autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::KEY_9, VK_CONTROL | VK_OPTION | VK_COMMAND, KeyCode::VK_CONSUMERKEY_VOLUME_DOWN, ModifierFlag::OPTION_L | ModifierFlag::SHIFT_L</autogen>\n<autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::KEY_0, VK_CONTROL | VK_OPTION | VK_COMMAND, KeyCode::VK_CONSUMERKEY_VOLUME_UP, ModifierFlag::OPTION_L | ModifierFlag::SHIFT_L</autogen>\n\nThe first line remaps the right command to control + option + command.

I'm trying to route just specific traffic (a specific domain) on my Mac over my company VPN. This seems to be the most recommended way to do it, \nCreate the file /etc/ppp/ip-up with following content:\n\n#!/bin/sh /sbin/route add SUBNET $5 replacing SUBNET with subnet, you want to route through VPN (for ex. 192.168.0.0/16)\n\nexecute as root:\n\nchmod 0755 /etc/ppp/ip-up This file will be executed each time you connect to VPN.\n\n...but I don't understand how to determine the SUBNET value. Do I need to create a subnet? Is the subnet name for the VPN in network preferences somewhere? I really don't have a good idea of what a subnet even is, so I'm not following how to implement the solution above.\n\nA: You don't need to create a new subnet, you just need to figure out what subnet (or subnets) your company's network uses. For example, if the IP addresses on your company's network are in the ranges 10.0.0.1 to 10.0.0.255, then you can use the subnet mask \"10.0.0.0/24\". If the range is 10.0.0.1 to 10.0.255.255, then you can use the broader range \"10.0.0.0/16\". You can search for \"subnet calculator\" to find some tools that can help you figure out the notation for the subnet range you want to capture.\nMake sure your local network doesn't overlap with the range, though. Your home network should use a different subnet (like 192.168.0.0/24 for example) that won't conflict with your office's network.\n", "Q: Can an Xbox 360 be hooked up to a Thunderbolt display? Having both the video and audio going to the display would be optimal, but if I can just get the video on the display and use headphones plugged into the Xbox, that's perfectly fine and probably easier to achieve.\nI have an HDMI to mini DisplayPort adapter, so I tried using that and plugging it into the Thunderbolt port, unfortunately I didn't get sound or video that way.\n\nA: The Thunderbolt display expects a full Thunderbolt signal (that is, muxed PCI-Express and DisplayPort). It will not work with DisplayPort-only sources.\nTo date, I've not heard of any announced (let alone released) adapters that could drive a Thunderbolt display from a non-Thunderbolt source.\nIf you really need to do this, you might be able to hook the Xbox up to an HDMI capture card (it needs to support HDCP) that is connected to a Thunderbolt-equipped computer to which the display is connected. These capture cards are usually used by professional video editors and can be quite expensive.\n", "Q: Has anyone found a download for a Mountain Lion resembling Dock theme?

On a particular wireless network, most internet access is blocked by a captive portal but certain websites are not blocked, e.g.:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.apple.com/ is redirected to a captive portal login page.\n\n*http://www.my-university.edu/ is accessible without having to log in.\n\n\nI want to access a website that is not blocked. When I try to connect, however,\n\n\n*\n\n*iOS automatically displays the captive portal after connecting.\n\n*iOS automatically disconnects after I close the captive portal.\n\n\nHow can I escape this aggressive automation?\n\nA: As documented in the Apple knowledge base:\n\nIf you cancel before logging in to the network\nTapping Cancel on the Log In screen disassociates the device from the captive Wi-Fi network.\nIf you joined the network from the Wi-Fi screen using the ⓘ button, or you joined less than eight minutes ago, you'll see a message telling you the network isn't connected to the Internet. You can choose one of these options:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Use Without Internet: this option will dismiss the Welcome screen, turn off Auto-Login for the network, keep your device associated with the network, and allow you to interact with the network in other ways.\n  \n*Use Other Network: this option will dismiss the Welcome screen, disassociate your device from the network, and return you to the Wi-Fi Settings screen. From there, you can choose a different network.\n  \n*Cancel: this option will return you to the Welcome screen.\n\nTherefore you can (now—I don't know in which version of iOS this was introduced) click cancel and then \"Use Without Internet\".\n\nA: \nTo implement a Wi-Fi popup login page:\n  1) DNS request for www.apple.com must not fail\n  2) HTTP request for http://www.apple.com/library/test/success.html with special user agent CaptiveNetworkSupport/1.0 wispr must not return Success.\n\nIf you find a way to invert one of these result it shouldn't popup\n\nA: I'm not sure you can disable the captive portal system; can you log in to the captive portal so apple.com is reachable?\n\nA: What you are seeing here is completely expected with a locked-down wireless network which requires authentication. A well-designed captive portal keeps you from accessing the internet for  a very good reason - security - and this is obvious because you need credentials to authenticate to this University's user directory through the portal. This is also borne out by the fact that you can only access the University's internal web-site/network without credentials. \nI'm not trying to cast aspersions on your ethics or motivation, but without more information it does appear as if you are trying to hack past this portal authentication page without proper credentials. You neglect to mention that you have successfully authenticate to the captive portal on a regular basis and you do not indicate that this portal authentication login page is spurious and unexpected. \nIf you are trying to hack past the authentication, then you may be opening yourself up to legal prosecution if you are caught, successful or not.\nAgain - your motivation to get past the portal seems suspect without further information.\n\nOn the other hand, if you are not trying to hack the portal, perhaps a Tech Support request to the University's IT staff is in order. You may not be the only one trying to get to the blocked site.\nNo flames please. Just doing a bit of 'due diligence' for the greater good. Please don't use this site to get information on how to break the law. \n", "Q: Does my MacBook DisplayPort support video input? I have been reading through all these resources here and here, but I couldn't find an answer.\nMy question is simply: can the DisplayPort on a MacBook take a video input source?\nMore Details:\nI have:\n\n\n*\n\n*Macbook Pro Model 6,2 (Mid-2010) that has a DisplayPort output\n\n*A camcorder that has HDMI output and NO FireWire outputs. \n\n*A HDMI to DisplayPort adapter.\n\n\nI want to know if its possible to use my camcorder like a webcam, i.e, to capture live video for the purpose of streaming. As a primary test, I should be able to connect the camcorder and do a capture using iMovie. \nWould this be possible? I am pretty sure input through USB won't work. And from what I have seen there is no easy way to convert the HDMI video stream into FireWire. So, any suggestions?\n\nA: No, it does not, I fear: the DisplayPort is an output only.\n\nA: So if the DisplayPort does not support input, how then does the built-in iSight camera on the external monitor work so well through the DisplayPort connection?\n", "Q: Memory exhaused error in Redsn0w When I tried to build a custom iOS 5.1.1 firmware (ipsw file) using redsn0w 0.9.12b1 almost in the beginning of the process I receive a message:\n\nCustom IPSW creating failed\n  Memory Exhaused\n\nWhat should I do? I tried to run redsn0w on Windows Vista and XP and and as Administrator and with no results. Always the same.\n\nA: This is a tricky error. A couple options to try, based on successful reports from this thread and this one:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run redsn0w as administrator and in Windows XP (SP2) compatibility mode. Also try other compatibility modes, such as Vista SP1.\n\n*Move redsn0w to a place where it will have a short file location - something like C:/redsn0w/redsn0w.exe - and put the stock IPSW in that directory too.\n\n\nIt'd be interesting to see if those steps work. If they don't, another option is to simply use sn0wbreeze instead, which is available here: http://www.ih8sn0w.com/ - it supports building custom firmware for the same devices that redsn0w does.\n", "Q: Reinstalling my Windows machine and wanting to preserve iTunes backups Is there a way to preserve the backups from all my iDevices stored into the iTunes folder - photos, audio notes, SMS etc. and move them to the new Windows installation. \nIs this possible? How?\n\nA: Depending on the iOS version of your devices, I suggest backing up to iCloud instead. If you have iOS 5 installed, find iCloud in Settings, select storage and backup, and backup all of your devices.\nIf you do not have enough room for all of your devices under iCloud or if they don't have iOS 5, you can follow this guide to back them up.\n", "Q: In terminal, how to get \"say\" to say things \"right\" ? ie using custom phonetics? I'd like to use \"say\" in the terminal to create audio files with a custom phonetic dictionary, or at the very least, say things how I think they should sound. From my understanding, this can't be accomplished through the \"Voice Over Utility\" configuration screen.\nSo to have say \"speak\" things correctly, I'm willing to:\n\n\n*\n\n*use a custom phonetic dictionary or\n\n*change my input text to some phonetic variant\n\n\nFor example, I'd like to be able to have the word \"colossians\" said as I expect it, which is phonetically something like \"kuh LOSH uhnz\" without the pauses that the spaces cause in the word.\n\nA: The Speech Synthesis Programming Guide describes the embedded speech commands that you can use to adjust how the speech synthesis engines process your input text.\nThe [[inpt PHON]] command enables the use of phonemes and phoneme modifiers.\nFor example, the following text includes a phonemic version of your chosen word  (select the text, Control-click, and select Speech > Start Speaking to hear it directly in Safari):\nIf you don't like how I say \"colossians\",\nthen perhaps you will be satisfied with\n\"[[inpt PHON]]kUH2lAASUHnz[[inpt TEXT]]\".\n\nThis syntax is accepted by the say command in the shell and AppleScript (though you will have to modify the (above) use of single- and double-quotes to suit the string literal syntax of your chosen context).\n", "Q: Can one Mac boot up to several OS X installation?

Use the Startup Disk preference pane or hold down Option at boot to choose which partition to boot.\n", "Q: Does the Macintosh classic have the signatures of the original Mac team? I am huge fan of Apple, and I just bid on one a 1990-era Macintosh Classic. The bid is going higher, but I only want it if the computer has the signatures of the original Mac team.\nIt's before I was born, I wish I was born in that era. But please let me know if anyone knows whether this model has those signatures. I am 100% sure the original Macintosh (128k) had those signatures.\n\nA: No. The signatures were really only in the 128K. Each time some the case saw some minor modification, some of the signatures would be cut off in part or in whole. The 512K Mac contained some of the signatures, and the Macintosh Plus contained a few less. At some point, the signatures disappeared entirely.\nThe Macintosh Classic was an entirely new case design, though, six years later. There were no signatures on it.\nAlso, not being fully satisfied, I found a picture:\n\n\n*\n\n*Cracking Open the Apple Macintosh Classic\n", "Q: How to change 2 properties in Xcode 4?

In Xcode when I go to commit files, I get a sheet with \"Cancel\" and \"Commit\" buttons, where the latter is the default (colored/pulsing) button.  I can hit Escape to Cancel, but I haven't found any way to Commit with just the keyboard.\nIn particular, pressing Return doesn't work.  There's a multiline text area on this sheet, so pressing Return adds a new line there.\nIn this question, the first answer suggested command + first letter (which would be command-C, which is Copy, as usual), and the second answer suggested turning on \"Full Keyboard Access\" (which I don't want).\nIs there any way to click a pulsing default button with just the keyboard, without turning on Full Keyboard Access?  Or is the pulsing purely to indicate to me that it's the default choice that I should click to continue?\n\nA: When the focus is on a multiline text view, pressing enter (⌤ or fn↩) usually selects the blue default button. (At least it does in some bug report dialogs.)\n", "Q: What's the difference between Final Cut Pro X and Final Cut Studio? I visited the Wikipedia page about Final Cut Studio, which is apparently aimed at professional movie studios. The page says that it's now only available via a 1-800 number, but the link to the official page for Studio at Apple now points at Final Cut Pro X. Also, the prices are wildly different. $299 for Pro X. Around $800 for Studio according to some results on Google.\nIs Studio an old, retired product and the high end editor suite is now Pro X (with an apparent huge slash in price), or am I missing something? \n\nA: Yes. Final Cut Pro X is the new high-end professional video editor. When it was released, the pro video editors revolted, as they rewrote Final Cut Pro, changed the interface, and took out a lot of features they relied on. So, if you're a pro and you want to spend a lot of money on the old version, you call Apple and make an arrangement.\n\nA: Final Cut Studio is the discontinued version of what is now Final Cut Pro X, the newer version of Apple's pro video editor. Final Cut Studio had some features and structure that Final Cut Pro X doesn't have, which is why it's more expensive, as it is now more specialized.\nI would like to point out that you can find Final Cut Studio 3 on sites like eBay for significantly less than $800. I've found some full installation disk sets for about $90, making it cheaper than Final Cut Pro X. I would check eBay and other sites as it's cheap enough that you buy both and if you don't like one of them, you have the other, or if one doesn't have a feature, the other may have the feature you need.\n", "Q: First Sync my iPad.

Can I make a backup of my iPad, Sync the Apps and then get my data back on my iPad?\n\nA: Have you authorized your iMac with the iTunes account(s) that is linked to data on the iPad? If no, do it by going to Menubar > Store > Authorize This Computer. It should allow you to sync without the data loss warning.\n", "Q: Time Capsule slow on Ethernet I'm having issues with my just-purchased Time Capsule (2 TB). I have it in my room connected wirelessy to an existing network. I think this means I'm not taking full advantage of 802.11n, right? I'm doing the intial backup of some files. It is taking 20+ hours to transfer 40GB of data.\nI expected the wireless transfer to be slow, but not so much! So I tried to connect to the Time Capsule from my MacBok Pro via Ethernet, but the connection speed didn't change, and this left me wondering: shouldn't be the connection via Ethernet be way faster? What is the proper way to configure this?\n\nA: If you connected the Ethernet cable while the backup was running, it is probably still utilizing the wireless interface. It can not re-route an established connection in the middle of the backup.\nStart by cancelling the backup. Then do one of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable the Wi-Fi interface on the computer; OR...\n\n*Open Network in System Preferences; click on the cog button below the list of network interfaces; click on \"Set Service Order\"; drag the services so that Ethernet is on top of the list; click OK and Apply.\n\n\nNow, restart the backup.\n\nA: It may also be a network problem.\nYou said you connected the Time Capsule to an existing network: what kind of network?\nTo use WiFi \"n\", your wireless access point (generally, your router) has to support WiFi \"n\" too.\nAlso, even when using WiFi \"n\", depending on your router (and its antennas) you may get different speeds, from 300 mbps to 450 mbps.\nLast thing about the WiFi connection: the channel you are using may be \"congested\". This is especially possible if your neighbors have WiFi networks too. You may want to try with a different channel (you can change that in your router's settings panel).\nAbout ethernet...\nDid you connect your Mac to the Time Capsule directly? If the Time Capsule is connected to a network, you should never connect to it directly (it won't work as you expect!).\nThat may also explain why you are not seeing differences in speed: your Mac was still using WiFi to connect to the Time Capsule.\nThe best thing to do, in my opinion, is to connect the Time Capsule to the network via gigabit ethernet.\nFirst of all:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you have a router with gigabit ethernet ports (or it will be actually slower than WiFi \"n\"!)\n\n*Make sure your cables can support gigabit ethernet (have to be \"class 5e\" or higher, preferably)\n\n\nThen, connect the Time Capsule to the router via cable. You may then connect to it using either your existing WiFi network or via gigabit ethernet (plug the cable into the router, not into the Time Capsule!).\n", "Q: Schedule text message on iPhone Is there an iPhone app in the App Store which allows scheduling of text messages? For example, I would like to setup birthday messages, so I don't forget them, or reminder messages. I know of such apps, but they run only on jailbroken devices.\nIf there are none, is there any specific reason why no developer creates such an app? Android and Windows Phone have them, why not iOS?\nEDIT: Apparently Apple prevents automatic sending of SMS over the SIM card (i.e. over the network carrier). But there are ways to get around this limitation without violating Apple's App Store terms.\n\nA: You can use Launch Center.\nIt won't send the message automatically (Apple doesn't allow automatic sending of SMS), but you'll have a notification that will open a new message with the contact already selected. All you have to do is write the message and press send.\n\nA: The reason I want this feature is because I have employees that go into work at 4am, and I think of things I need to tell them at 11pm.  I'm not waking up at 4am to tell them they need to do something.\nWith a jailbroken iPhone, I use biteSMS to write a text, schedule it, and my employees get it at 4am. \n\nA: Up to now, I haven't got a satisfactory answer to this question. There really was no app on the App Store which let you schedule your text messages. And no, jailbreaking is currently no option.\nSo, we created our own app which solves this problem: n8message\n(just search the App Store for n8message, there is also a Lite version which has no SMS credits bundled)\nYes, the app sends your messages fully automatically.\nNo, the app doesn't do anything that is forbidden by Apple.\nSending of E-Mails is free, but for text messages you need to buy credits. If you send a text message over my app, you're causing costs to us, so we cannot give away those text messages for free. There are, however, some ways to obtain a few credits for free, so you don't have to pay just to test the app.\nThe app does not yet work in all countries (due to some cell phone operators blocking messages), so currently it's available in those App Stores where it is working. For example, it does not work in the Americas, so you won't currently find it in the US or the Canadian App Stores.\nPlease tell us what you think about n8message, comments and feedback are very welcome.\nEDIT: Here's some more explanation as to why the app does not work everywhere: When you send an SMS through n8message, we have to send the message in a way such that the receiver sees your phone number as the sender. Without that, the receiver would see something as Unknown or 000 or some random number as the sender.\nThis is done through what's known as Dynamic Sender ID. Unfortunately, in some countries (like the United States, Canada, China, and many more) dynamic sender IDs in SMS messages are forbidden, for various reasons. The most frequently heard reason is that dynamic sender IDs can be abused for spam, harassment, or even fraud.\nThat's the reason why n8message currently does not work in the US, and likely won't be working in the near future.\n\nA: Birthday messages and reminders for yourself?  Why not use the calendar and reminder apps for that?  If you're asking for reminders others of presetting those happy birthday texts then yup, Jailbreak is the only way.  I use BiteSMS (Jailbroken).\n\nA: Take a look at Future Scheduler for iPhone this will help you in scheduling text messages but also emails, status update and phone calls. \nApple, does not allow third party apps to automatically send a message or email unless user confirms it. That is part of their security set up and we have to follow that.\n\nA: Personally I use an app called the Auto Sender. It works by storing your scheduled messages on their server, and then automatically sending the message at your scheduled time. While it is not free, you have to pay for each message, it is cheaper then any of the other apps I have used. It also sends the message from a different number since it cannot send it through your phone number; but you can have a signature at the end with your name, and your actual number will always appear at the end of the message.\nIf you are okay with paying for it, and fine with it coming from a different number then this is something I would recommenced checking out.\n", "Q: Gmail SMTP server going offline I have a Google Apps account, with 2-step verification, set up in Apple mail. Typically it works great for several weeks, or a month, but then the SMTP server has (Offline) next to it, and it will refuse to send from that email address. I still can receive mail into that account. I believe deleting the account from Mail.app and adding it back in fixes the problem for awhile, but is there something that I should look for in the configuration of this account that has problems in particular?\n\nA: Are you sure google isn't simply kicking you out after a month or so, because you have to refresh your two factor auth login?\nSMTP uses password authentication, and two factor auth sets up your account so that a password alone is not enough to access your account.\nI think this is unlikely to be a problem with mail.app, and deleting/re-creating the account is a red herring. The real issue is happening on google's server and something else is solving it. Deleting the account in Mail.app and creating a new one with the same username/password has no impact at all on what data it sends to google's server, so it's impossible for that to solve the problem you're having.\nPerhaps if you log into google in safari, go through the two factor auth process, Mail.app will suddenly start working again? I'm not sure how google's two factor auth uses, I think if you have used two factor auth from that IP address recently, it will accept password-only authentication.\nFailing that, you might have better luck on a google specific support forum, or just waiting for it to be fixed (you can't be the only person experiencing this issue).\n\nA: I'm doubtful this is your issue, but note that the password for the SMTP server is configured independently from the incoming (IMAP) server. Double-check both are set to a valid app-specific password in Mail.app's settings.\n\nA: FWIW I've been having this problem with my account since setting up two-factor-auth. I've had to reset my app-specific password for the GMail account on my mac profile several times. The most recent time I actually just needed to restart Mail.app though.\n\nA: Worth checking that you aren't suffering from a Captcha-based issue. See here.\n\nA: I have this same problem as of this morning (9/30/15) after upgrading to Yosemite on my Macbook Pro. It worked fine for one day. Can receive but not send as the account is offline.  I've tried every tip I've been reading about and nothing is working.  I can send emails from my Mac if I go on the internet to mail.google.com.  The problem is with MacMail.\n", "Q: How to remove unsupported format podcasts from iTunes download queue on iPad/iPhone I tried download some video podcast episodes a few days ago but the iPad displayed a message saying it can't download them because they were in a format it couldn't read.\nThe problem is they are now still on the download queue in the iTunes app.\nAny ideas on how to fix this ?\nThanks\n\nA: In the iTunes 'Downloads' section, select and delete any downloads. Quit iTunes. \nLook in your iTunes folder, where the audio files get stored. For example ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes\\ Media/. Here, you should find a 'Downloads' folder. Inside it, 'Podcasts' (assuming that the file you're downloading has the media type of podcast).\nInside here should be a folder with the name of the podcast subscription with '.tmp' appended. Inside here should be the partial file that you've downloaded. Trash the folder and its contents.\nRestart iTunes. Note that iTunes can be a bit sticky when it comes to automatic downloads (e.g. I am asked to log in twice when launching iTunes). The actions above should result in there not being a 'Downloads' on the sidebar. If for some reason, there still is, select and delete the items there again.\n\n", "Q: Does the Mini DisplayPort to DVI Adapter work with 2048x1152 resolution?

I thought spotlight was able to do this but it doesn't seem to work (in Lion) (I noticed Dictionary isn't even listed in spotlight preferences).\nI (stupidly) forgot to mention that I forbade spotlight from indexing my main drive. I thought that would just keep it from searching my files and not affect dictionary search, but I'm guessing that they're all bundled up together. \n\nA: Spotlight can do this.  You just need to hover your mouse over the \"Look Up\" entry:\n\n\nA: Spotlight is able to search in you dictionary. Just make sure it is selected in System Prefernces -> Spotlight\n", "Q: Most similar Apple TV software for OS X ? I really love the way latest Apple TV front-row works. Its easy, clean and fast.\nI've been trying many different Media Center applications for my Mac Mini, but none of them are just like the one Apple TV provides.\nI could buy an AppleTV, but I really don't want to have yet another device at home, so I think there should be an application that replicates Apple TV menus/workflow.\nDo you know of any?  Plex, XBMC or Boxee are far of what I'm looking for\n\nA: I'd say go with Plex. I've been using and testing different media center apps for years, and, like you, stuck with Front Row until Lion came out, because nothing else felt quite right. Since then, Plex has won me over, especially with the huge progress made in the last year or so.\nIn terms of user experience, Plex is the closest thing to Snow Leopard's Front Row. I always disliked the visual clutter of XBMC and Boxee, and even earlier Plex versions. But the current Plex version has a VERY clean interface and works great with the Apple Remote.\nIt can handle almost any file format (without installing extra codecs), unlike Front Row, and you can have it watch any folder on your machine (or network), not just the ~/Movies, ~/Videos and iTunes.\nIt automatically downloads artwork and metadata for movies and TV shows in your library based on their filenames, and there are many high-quality channels (plugins for streaming content) that you can install right inside the client.\nThe channels have to present their data in the same layout as the native Plex library, so the interface is consistent. Plex integrates with iPhoto and iTunes as well, showing them as available channels.\nFinally, since Plex is really a two-part setup (client and server, both of which can easily run on the same machine), it's expandable. Once you set up the server, you can use it with the client on that machine, and you can also view your library on other Macs, PCs, iOS devices, Android devices, Google TV, Roku, LG Smart TVs, and DLNA TVs. I think they even released a WebOS client too.\nMost of the client apps work with absolutely zero configuration. As long as you're on the same network, all available Plex servers and their libraries just show up. Start playing something, and the server will even transcode the video or audio (in realtime) if the client device doesn't have the necessary codecs to handle it.\nPlex isn't perfect, but it's under very active development, and constantly improving. And the UI finally looks and feels natural. \nAlso, it's everywhere. Practically every screen in my house has access to my Plex library. Some of the apps (iOS, Android etc.) cost money, which is good for the long-term survival of Plex as a platform, but the Linux (server only), Mac (client + server), Win (client + server) are all free.\n\nA: Like you I have been looking for this forever and sadly it seems no such thing exists right now. Plex comes as pretty good and pretty feature rich app, but it's currently very un-Mac-like. Even though it started off as bringing XMBC to the Mac, its focus now is very cross platform and does not fit well as a Mac app at all in terms of look/feel/behaviour as well as leveraging OS X specific technologies.\nHave a look at Squire. It looks like a promising, very slick and Apple-like app. Sadly it's still in early development with no apparent ETA.\n\nA: If you liked Front Row, then you should take a look at nessMediaCenter. It is the only media center I know, which is like Front Row and gives access to iTunes DRM (bought or rented motion pictures and TV shows).\nBut nessMediaCenter has some disadvantages too: its GUI is old fashion (with a high contrast) and metadata is only available for DVDs (it is its philosophy to keep movie titles private). But you can edit / save metadata for (EyeTV) movies and DVDs by using \"Movie Info\".\n\nA: Squire\nSylion recently came out with a 1.0 release of Squire. At first glance it looks very barebones and minimal compared to Plex or XBMC, but it has almost everything I need. I see it as the first true Front Row replacement.\nSome of my favorite things:\n\n*\n\n*Only a handful of settings - not hundreds of settings like XMBC or Plex.\n\n*The helper app is great. It tore through my ~5TB video library in seconds. It's ~90% accurate at tagging my media, and only a couple clicks to match those it misses.\n\n*Adding media is dead-simple. Drag any folder(s) your Mac can see into the helper app. Internal, external, network, etc. drives all work.\n\n*No skins, add-ons, etc. to complicate things. Can it be a DVR? Show RSS feeds? Manage your torrents? Control your home lighting? None of the above. All it does is play your movies and TV shows - and it does this extremely well.\n\n*Extremely easy to understand interface, a la Front Row.\n\nThings I don't like\n\n*\n\n*No music support.\n\n*Picky with file names. It doesn't appear to use folder names for anything but show name. So if, like me, you have things organized as Show/Season/Episode it probably wont like it.\n\n*While otherwise great, when the helper app mistags something it's almost always way off. It matched The Roots of The Matrix with Marley. An easy fix for me, but still not something I should have to do in the first place.\n\n*No AirPlay support.\n\n*The backgrounds are a little gaudy, but that's just nitpicking.\n\nNone of the other big name media center apps really click with me. I don't want to spend time looking for a simple skin or fiddling with hundreds of settings - why on earth should I have to choose or know what the \"A/V sync method\" is? While Squire may not have near the feature list of others, it doesn't come with the headache either.\n\nA: If your like Squire and see it as a first replacement for Front Row, then you should definitely take a look at nessMediaCenter.\nI would like to agree to your statement that less settings are helpful! Applications should be easy to use.\nBut I would like to disagree that playing my movies and TV shows is enough: in my opinion a media center should give me access to all media. Just some examples:\n\n\n*\n\n*iPhoto media (albums, events, pictures and videos)\n\n*iTunes music aka playlist, DRM (bought or rented motion pictures or TV shows)\n\n*internet content, if available by different selection (categories, newest, latest, next page...)\n\n*Other local media like pictures, EyeTV movies, DVDs or just movie files (like \"MOV\", \"AVI\", \"DivX\").\n\n*Direct access to folders and volumes - I do not want to do all work again to set up another library.\n\n\nAs already mentioned, the GUI is \"old school\" (just a list of names and a preview and description for the current selected entry) - but you do not have to search for any skin.\nI have one big problem with the \"cover view\" of some media centers: I know my movies, and what I need is to see as much entries as possible. 10 feet interface is needed as well - the small covers and low contrast of the common media centers is less helpful in my opinion.\nAnother problem: I have thousands of videos which are recorded by myself. And I do not want any application to share its titles by searching for metadata. Beside the fact that it would make no sense...\n\"Double-click\" is very important, too. Seeing a list of movies, I can recognize very quickly if I want to see the next page. Moving one page down to see the next 9 - 13 next entries helps me a lot.\nAnother feature which is important for me: selecting folders. Just think of a folder which contains short music videos or many pictures: I need the feature to select one of this folders remotely - and then I want to watch this content continuously.\nI could go on with many features I am still missing if I test other media centers... :-)\n", "Q: Enlightenment on Lion - make default WM I ran the Enlightenment e16.dmg file from here, http://trac.enlightenment.org/e/wiki/MACOSX , it works pretty good, but it runs on top of the mac osx default Window Manager (Quartz Compositor? i think its called).  Is there a way to just run the enlightenment manager?  \n\nA: You mean, booting into an X11 powered Window Manager instead of the Finder and Quartz? No, this is not possible (unless you install Linux of course and boot this directly).\n\nA: Apparently Aqua and Quartz-wm (the X11 implementation) can't be separated, if someone is a glutton for punishment, then they could get XFree86 to work, like was outlined in this thread, http://hintsforums.macworld.com/showthread.php?t=21116 .  But then you can't run native Mac apps which try to communicate with quart-wm, so its kind of pointless.\n", "Q: Is There a Coda 2 Plugin that does change highlighting for git / svn like netbeans has In netbeans, it highlights changed lines of code in green, blue or red and lets you revert changes per line.

I currently have Snow Leopard and do iOS development. I'm wanting to play with the new iOS 6 SDK, but I need to have Lion installed.

Is it not possible?\n\nA: No, it is not possible.\nSee this Apple Support Document for more information:\n\nMovies rented on iPad cannot be transferred to other devices and can only be viewed on iPad.\n\nYou'll have to expand the section on \"Movie rentals on iPad\" to see the above quote.\nYour only option is to free up enough space to watch it on your iPad.\n\nA: I have an Apple dock cable with an HDMI connector. Using that cable I was able to play the movie \n\nA: That is a disgrace. My parents bought an Apple TV on the promise of compatibility between Apple devices, and yet now they find that for some bizarre reason the rules are different for their iPad. They rented a film on iTunes on the iPad whilst they were out of the house, and found that it could only be watched on the iPad, unlike films rented on their MacBook which can be watched on all devices. There was no warning or disclaimer about this, only a bit of small print on the we page linked to. I think that is a con.\n\nA: if you have an apple tv all you have to do is stream a movie from your iPad or other apple device.

How can I stream my movies and TV shows from the cloud and watch them on my MacBook Air when I'm out of town? Download to watch isn't a good fit because of limited HD space.\n\nA: No. iCloud does not have movie streaming for Macs (yet).

I've looked on Apple's site and I can't seem to find any information on whether having an iPad engraved will add a substantial amount of time to the shipping. Does anyone have any first hand experience?\nWill there be a delay? If so, for how long?\nI'm based in London, I'm not sure if that will make any difference.\nAlso: I'm not bothered by the idea that I will be \"devaluing\" my iPad by getting it engraved. I tend to use electronic devices until the end of their life.\nThanks!\n\nA: In my experience, yes, there will be a delay.\nThe thing is that when you order engraving (at least it was like this when I ordered), Apple does it in a factory somewhere in China, and ships it from there, which takes forever (it took a little more than a week if I remember correctly to ship it to New York).\nIf you don't order the engraving, Apple can send an iPad that they have in stock somewhere much closer to where you are, which will be faster.\n", "Q: How can I send smtp mail via gmail and osx Lion mailx? I would like to be able to send email from utility/batch/launchd scripts via my gmail account and the mailx client that is bundled in OS X Lion. I cannot find how to configure this. I found http://www.andrews-corner.org/mutt.html#sending which describes doing this for mutt, but I'd rather not have to install mutt. I do have Thunderbird installed and use that to read/send mail (instead of Mail.app).\nWhen I run \n   mailx -v -s subject myemailaddress@gmail.com < file.txt\nI get no errors, but instead of getting an SMTP transaction log, mailx tells me \nMail Delivery Status Report will be mailed to <David>.\n\nWorse, there is no /var/mail/David folder, so this report appears to go into a bitbucket.\n\nA: One way to fix this is to install the official server app in order to re-enable this feature.  You don't have to setup a mail server through the app.  Just installing it will allow use of mailx through the command line.\nIn the past, you had to buy and install OS X server as a separate product and now it's available from the App Store and gets installed on top of the normal OS.\n", "Q: Managing pictures and videos between my iPhone and iPad I take a lot of photos and videos with my iPhone, and like to have most of them on my iPad. However, often, I take and combine videos with iMovie eliminating the need to have 10-20+ videos of whatever that was in my Photos app. Right now I sync through iTunes into iPhoto, but that has become an immense space hog for two reasons. One is the videos, (I have the one completed video, and don't need all the clips) and two, iPhoto likes to create Photostream events that downloads all my Photostream pictures into separate Events(resulting in loads of duplicates as well). To finish the loop, I have my iPad sync the last three months of events.\nIs there a better way to manage pictures and videos?\nI would like to use something like a (iPhoto) Smart Album that only imports media, and then lets me delete whatever out that I want to.\n\nA: Apple wants you to use their PhotoStream or do manual syncing all the time. From my personal experience it's impossible to manage some parts in PhotoStream and some others outside. I'm sure it's possible to do some crazy scripting, symlinking and syncing. But hey... that's not the reason why we use Apple products in favor to the more open Android ones, right?\nI ended up re-creating my Aperture and iPhoto libraries and a big upload session to PhotoStream. Works fine so far.\n\nA: what i would do, turn of automatic download in iphoto on your mac, therfore you know what u want from you photostream and what not! second, deactivate photostream on you iPad, but share a photostream from you iPhone to your iPad, rather from your self to yourself. when ever you wanna move to your iPad, just share the pics pic up your iPad, go nuts, and when you are by your comp, just select the ones you want.... \nwas i clear enough?\n", "Q: Why have 3 songs from a recent download from iTunes got a ''! next to them and won't sync to playlist? We paid for and downloaded an album from iTunes store and 3 of the tracks have an exclamation mark next to them and we cannot move them to the playlist to sync with the ipod. Does anyone know what we can do about that?\nThanks\n\nA: You are seeing the exclamation point because iTunes doesn't know where to find the song. \nUsing iCloud, you can download those three songs again without having to pay. You can do this by going to the iTunes store, navigate to Quick Links on the right, and click the Purchased link. Search for your songs and you can redownload them.\n", "Q: Is grounding important?

I do know the dangers of not grounding an equipment that needs grounding but -- does the Macbook Pro need it?\n\nA: The short answer is no.\nIf you remove the cable or \"duck head\" from your AC adapter, you'll see that there are only two prongs that actually make contact with the power cable. The ground wire doesn't make it to the adapter. You're safe to convert the cable to two prongs.\n", "Q: How do I get a Unix Executable File to run from anywhere, like Java or Git?

Preface this by saying I will be launching this script whether it be applescript or bash script with Alfred.app.\nSorry to be so blunt and unknowledgable but I need to run a couple lines of bash in an applescript. I think a simple bash script is capable but I do not know for sure. Here are the details (note that the commands should probably be different so if you have suggestions, please feel free to state them as they are probably correct):\nI want the script to\n\n\n*\n\n*rm ~/Library/Vidalia/vidalia.conf'\n\n*unzip ~/Library/Vidalia/vidalia.conf.zip'\n\n*launch Vidalia.app\n\n\nStep below I do not believe is possible since the Vidalia.app is not scriptable and I don't want the applescript/bash script to be running until Vidalia quits... but if it's possible to implement without the script needing to stay open:\n4) On quit of Vidalia.app rm ~/Library/Vidalia/vidalia.conf\nIs this possible. I can use bash or applescript whatever is easiest for you guy's & gals to help me with. If I could get the first three steps to run I would be plenty happy! Thanks for your time and sorry for my lack of knowledge. Any tips or pointers are welcome.\nHeck, I don't even know if those are the \"proper\" shell commands to use, they did the job but if they are \"sound\" I do not know.\nThank you for your time and patience.\nUPDATE - Question: How to move unzipped file into different directory?\nOkay I have one last question. How would I do this same sort of action, but I wanted to keep vidalia.conf.zip in another directory? \nSay, for example, an external volume named tor - I moved into the mounted volume named tor with pushd, but when I go to extract the file with what I think should work -d I get the error that I  cannot create extraction directory \nWhich is good because I don't want to replace the directory, just move what get's unzipped into the pre-existing directory. Yeah, I will probably have to remove the file already there depending on what I am doing so what I have looks like this...\npushd ~/Library/Vidalia/\nrm vidalia.conf\npopd\npushd /Volumes/tor\nunzip vidalia.conf.zip -d ~/Library/Vidalia/\npopd\n\nI haven't quite tried this too much once I ran into the error with plain old -d. As I was typing this I realized that I had to be navigating directories more with pushd and then out with popd.  Originally I just had lines 4 and 5 but added the top 3 to remove the .conf that currently is there ... if ... it is there...\nWhich bring me to one more question… Is it harmless to tell bash to remove a file that doesn't exist? I would have no idea where to even start with if then statements.\nLastly, can anyone recommend a good beginners intro to Bash book? I'd love to actually learn this stuff instead of just having to google and then turn around and bug you all. Thank you again for your help. You solved my earlier problem perfectly, I even learned a lot from the simple example (I think.)\nCheers!\n\nA: As @laaph mentioned, if you just want to run bash commands, use a bash script.\nThere are, however, a few issues with your commands.\nYour script has to look like:\n#!/bin/sh\n\npushd ~/Library/Vidalia\nrm vidalia.conf\nunzip vidalia.conf.zip\npopd\nopen /Applications/Vidalia.app\n\nIf you didn't change to the correct directory, unzip would unzip the file into your home directory, or wherever you launched your script from.\nThere are ways to look for when an app quits, but in your case this seems useless, you're removing the .conf whenever you launch the script anyway. But if you really want that, you could simply do:\n#!/bin/sh\n\npushd ~/Library/Vidalia\nrm vidalia.conf\nunzip vidalia.conf.zip\npopd\nopen -W /Applications/Vidalia.app\npushd ~/Library/Vidalia\nrm vidalia.conf\npopd\n\n(This would make the script wait until you close the app, and then it'd delete the configuration file. Again though, this is useless and redundant if you'll be only launching the app with the script.)\nAlso, you could try a simpler solution: I assume that what you want is just to have the same vidalia.conf whenever you start the program. If that's the case, try just making the .conf read-only.\n\nA: What you have so far is exactly what you want, and to open a program, use \"open\", so your script will look like this:\nrm ~/Library/Vidalia/vidalia.conf\nunzip ~/Library/Vidalia/vidalia.conf.zip\nopen /Applications/Vidallia.app\n\nThere are all sorts of tricks to monitor if Vidalia is running or not, so if you were willing to leave the script running, you could delete the conf as well, and then have the script exit.  And, as you say, this could be done (differently) in Applescript, Automator, or a million other ways.\n", "Q: How can I force iOS Mail to download the entire email every time?

But the last time I was out and about, I found I had a new email, but only the title and sender appeared in the Mail app. I had to connect the iPad to a public Wifi network to download the whole email.  \nHow can I force the iPad to always download the whole email message (attachments can wait) so I can read the whole message when I have time?\n\nA: Exchange ActiveSync 12.1 (introduced with Exchange Server 2007 SP1, released on Nov 29 2007) added a policy called mail body truncation size (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_ActiveSync#Exchange_ActiveSync_12.1).\nThis is a server-side policy that can be enforced for a group of users, as stated in the Microsoft Exchange documentation (see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/office/exchange-server-2007/bb123484(v=exchg.80)):\n\nExchange ActiveSync mailbox policies let you apply a common set of policy or security settings to a user or group of users.\n(...)\nMaximum HTML e-mail body truncation size\nThis setting specifies the size beyond which HTML-formatted e-mail\n  messages are truncated when they are synchronized to the device.

I'm not a Mac dev so I find reading that hard. \n\nA: Here is a simpler fix for the non-techies like myself, that worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Finder and select \"Hide Others\" from the Finder Menu\n\n*Right click (or control-click) on the Desktop\n\n*Choose \"Change Desktop Background\"\n\n*Select a new picture (I had to click on a few to get it to change)\n\n*Go to Activity Monitor and Force Quit the Dock app\n\n*The Dock will restart itself within a few seconds and presto:  no more 100% CPU usage\n\n\nFor what it's worth, I took this problem to the Genius Bar at an Apple store and they escalated it to \"engineering\" at Apple.  The answer that came back was that it's Parallel's fault, even though I clearly told them that I wasn't running Parallels.  I don't think Apple realizes this is their fault yet.  It's pretty simple - all about the background desktop picture!\n\nA: I had this same problem on my new MBP Retina.  I do have Parallels installed, but the similar issue caused by Parallels has been fixed in a Parallels update (which I've installed).  Moreover, none of the workarounds (e.g. deleting the Windows Applications folder from the Dock) suggested on the Parallels forum fixed the problem for me.  I also tried to delete the Dock's plist, restart the process, and restart the computer several times.  None of these fixed the problem.  The Dock process would go back to using 100% CPU.\nHere's what I did to troubleshoot and fix it:\nRun this from the command line.  This command will list the files the Dock process is accessing or tying to access.\nsudo opensnoop -n Dock\n\nI found that Dock was repeatedly trying to access /System/Library/CoreServices/DefaultDesktop.jpg, which is a symbolic link to /Library/Desktop Pictures/Galaxy.jpg.  The only problem was that /Library/Desktop Pictures/Galaxy.jpg didn't exist.  I'm not sure if the OS came without it at that location or if I deleted it or moved it mistakenly.  Regardless, to fix this I repointed the symbolic link to another desktop picture using the following two commands:\nsudo rm /System/Library/CoreServices/DefaultDesktop.jpg\nsudo ln -s /Library/Desktop\\ Pictures/Lion.jpg /System/Library/CoreServices/DefaultDesktop.jpg\n\nIt seems that the problem was that Dock was repeatedly trying and failing to access the missing Galaxy.jpg file to set my desktop background via the DefaultDesktop.jpg symbolic link.  Once that symbolic link pointed to a real JPG file, Dock's high CPU utilization stopped. On earlier MBPs, DefaultDesktop.jpg was a real JPG file (of a galaxy).\nAlso this fixed another problem I was having where if I locked my screen and then typed my password to unlock it, my computer would hang while trying to log me in.  My hunch is that the Dock was trying to access the same missing file and was hanging on the login screen.\n\nA: One thing to try is to temporarily remove the Dock preference files & see if the CPU badness stops. Try this in Terminal: \ncd ~/Library/Preferences\nmv com.apple.dock.db com.apple.dock.db_backup\nmv com.apple.dock.plist com.apple.dock.plist_backup\nkillall Dock\n\nOnce Dock.app restarts it should open with only the default set of icons. Depending on the presence of installed Apple apps, (iWork, iLife, & etc,) icons for them will be created in the Dock for them, too. You will also have to reset your Dock preferences and add other apps as you see fit.\nIf you are satisfied with the fix, and the Dock doesn't hammer the CPU, delete the old Dock preference files which caused all the problems:\ncd ~/Library/Preferences\nrm com.apple.dock.db_backup\nrm com.apple.dock.plist_backup\n\nOn the other hand, if you wish to restore the original preference files for some reason, do this:\ncd ~/Library/Preferences\nmv com.apple.dock.db_backup com.apple.dock.db\nmv com.apple.dock.plist_backup com.apple.dock.plist\nkillall Dock\n\nTroubleshooting tip: Alternate between the old & new preference files & restart the Dock to see if the CPU is hammered. If a restore of the original preference files causes the Dock to misbehave, something in one or both of the two files is munged.\nOn the other hand, if the Dock still hammers the CPU with fresh preference files, something else is amiss.\n\nA: Does this happen with the stock Dock or only after you add your own icons? If you remove the Dock plists and reboot, will this happen again without you touching the dock?\nIf you don't have anything custom in the dock, the only thing that I can think of (other than some obscure MBP-R bug) is that you may have something in the Download's folder or Apps (or one of the folders that appear in the default Dock) that is causing the Dock hang while reading the filesystem.\nA possible fix might be to \"empty\" the Downloads folder (move the contents to a temporarily location outside the Dock's reach) and fix your Permissions (in case something is amiss inside the Application's folder. \n\nA: The suggestion about the symbolic link did the trick for me. I had to use this command instead, which contains a slightly different link for the desktop picture folder:  \nsudo ln -s /Library/Desktop\\ Pictures/Lion.jpg /System/Library/CoreServices/DefaultDesktop.jpg\n\n\nA: This happened to me too and freaked me out for a bit, the computer became almost unusable. Fired up the console and all errors were something about \"Cannot find default desktop wallpaper\". Changed the wallpaper to default from the settings app and everything went back to normal. \nIMO this is a bug in Lion and the way it handles wallpapers. Very, very weird. \n\nA: In addition to the good answers above, as you have migrated from another system, I would suggest the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Repair Permissions until all is well.\n\n*Make sure you have applied the software update fix that came out late last week for your system.\n\n*Send the computer to me, so I can play with it :)\n", "Q: Whats a good software title to take video (mp4, avi, other..) and burn it to DVD I got some home brew videos from my webcam, and I got a couple movies on the drive I'd like to burn to DVD. The thing is, I don't know what's a good product for that, being a recent Mac convert and formally a heavy Windows user. \nI keep finding things about iDVD when I search but from further reading iDVD is no longer available. So doing a quick search on google you get your standard \"This app will do it all\" type sites, usually really crappy software so I don't want to waste 20, 50, 100+ dollars on an app that I'll use once in a blue moon or on an app that's actually worthless.\n\nA: If you're going to burn to DVD, you need a replacement for iDVD, and you don't want to spend beau coup cash, use Burn. Burn is free, and works swimmingly.\n\nA: *\n\n*To burn DVDs: Toast Titanium\n\n*To rip DVDs: RipIt or Mac The Ripper\n\n*To convert between video formats: Handbrake, ideally together with VLC\n", "Q: After getting a Mac, how to install Lion again on another partition? After getting a Mac with Lion and creating a partition to install Lion again (to have different versions of Xcode and Xcode beta on different partitions), how can Lion be installed on the new partition?  (Since Lion doesn't have an installation disc).\n(update: the Mac already has Lion and so in App Store, it doesn't list Lion as \"purchased\" but need to pay $29.99 for it)\n\nA: I usually just use a disk cloning app like Carbon Copy Cloner to duplicate my existing Lion install to the other partition. Then you can boot into your new partition and install the Xcode beta.\nThis method is nice because it moves all of your documents and settings along with the OS so you don't have to use Migration Assistant after installing on the new partition. It's also convenient if you don't have the original Lion installer.\n\nA: I've just done what you're looking for: Install Lion on another partition. The steps follow.\n\n\n*\n\n*Locate the Lion Installer that you previously downloaded (assuming\nyou have it at a backup drive somewhere). Not a problem if you don't\nhave it backed up, just launch the Mac AppStore on any Mac (that is\nconnected to the partition), find the Purchased and re-download the\nLion Installer and save it to the partition (the partition has to be\nformatted as Mac OSX compatible i.e not FAT).\n\n*When the download is completed, launch the Lion Installer.app from\nthe partition.

I really want to use the native music selection from the phone.\nI don't really want to buy AppleTV, as I already have enough computers in the house in theory to make this kind of system possible.\nDoes anyone know how I can make this work?\n\nA: Yes, you can. I use ArkMC to stream all my music to Samsung Smart TV. I even can browse artists, playlists, albums from Samsung TV.  For me,  it's more convenient.   \n\nA: I don't have first hand experience with this, but http://www.imediashare.tv/ looks like it could possibly work. Looks like it connects to DLNA capable TVs. In any case you're going to need to use 3rd party applications on the iphone to connect to the TV.\nIf you want to use Apple's Airplay, you can either buy an AppleTV (Which you've said you don't want to do), use a PC to connect to your sound system and install XBMC or other software capable of Airplay connectivity, or buy an Airport Express.\n", "Q: Freezes on MacBook w/ Lion with Intel 330 SSD I installed an Intel 330 SSD (120GB) in my MacBook (4,1) a few weeks ago. I reinstalled a fresh Mac OS X Lion (10.7.4) to make sure there are no issues with the new drive.\nHowever, since then I encounter random and pretty frequent freezes (~10, daily).\nThe entire OS freezes for 10-30 seconds, the cursor (the infamous beach ball) still moves but no application responds to input.\nI don't know whether the drive is malfunctioning or the problem is with the OS. I see other people having this issue and I'm wondering if anyone has any clues as to where to start investigating. If I am to return the drive, I need some proof that it's malfunctioning. Or, if the OS has incompatibility issues with Intel drives/SandForce controllers, I might buy a second different drive.\nAt the moment I'm trying to use fs_usage (as I'm writing this message), hoping to find a clue about what's causing the freezes.\nAs suggested by various blogs/tips, I disabled the power-saving feature for disk drives. I even tried the Trim Enabled utility, but it only seemed to make the freezes happen more often, so at the moment it's disabled.\nAny input on this issue would be appreciated.\n\nA: Turning off the FileVault seems to be fixing the problem with me. I also have TRIM enabled with Trim Enabler and \"Put hard disk(s) to sleep when possible\" in the Energy Saver setting unchecked.\n\nA: I have the same problem with my MacBook 3,1 and an OWC Mercury. I think an SSD with a white MacBook is fairly uncommon so you are going to have to experiment with a non-SF drive to get any answers. OWC told me they don't have any other reports of the issue. One clue I'll add is that I saw somewhat similar behavior with when I had previously upgraded to a new hard disk before going SSD. It was somewhat different with more frequent but short pauses. I've sort of resigned myself to living with it until I get a new MBP at some point.\nI also tried TRIM Enabler without any improvement. One thing that did help was upgrading to 6GB RAM and restarting my browser when free memory gets low. This minimizes paging and, while paging shouldn't be an issue, it does help quite a bit.  When I get the beach ball, it's almost always when there's no free memory.\n", "Q: How do I make a terminal alias that edits root owned files in a GUI text editor? How can I quickly edit root owned files like /etc/hosts and /etc/apache2/httpd.conf in a text editor such as TextEdit which would let me do modern text editor operations, without actually running the editor in sudo -b mode first, or without using nano, vim and other terminal based editors?\nEver since Lion came out, doing\n$sudo open -e /etc/hosts\n\nno longer works - the file remains locked when TextEdit opens it.\n\nA: sudo and open provide all the functionality already for editing files of other users so you can just run\nSUDO_EDITOR=\"open -FWne\" sudo -e /etc/hosts\n\nto edit /etc/hosts. Make sure to quit Textedit at the end (Cmd-Q) because otherwise sudo won't notice that you're done with editing.\nTo make life easier add the following to your .bashrc (or .alias if you have it)\nalias sudoedit='SUDO_EDITOR=\"open -FWne\" sudo -e'\n\n\nA: Here is a step by step solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the free TextWrangler app ( http://www.barebones.com/products/TextWrangler/ )\n\n*Create a .profile file in your home folder if it does not exist\n$ touch ~/.profile\n$ open -e ~/.profile\n\n\n*Edit the file and give it the following aliases, along with any others you may wish to add:\nalias edit_hosts='sudo open -a /Applications/TextWrangler.app/Contents/MacOS/TextWrangler /etc/hosts'\nalias edit_vhosts='sudo open -a /Applications/TextWrangler.app/Contents/MacOS/TextWrangler /etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf'\nalias edit_httpd='sudo open -a /Applications/TextWrangler.app/Contents/MacOS/TextWrangler /etc/apache2/httpd.conf'\nalias edit_alias='open -a /Applications/TextWrangler.app/Contents/MacOS/TextWrangler ~/.profile'\n\nalias reload_alias='. ~/.profile'\n\n\n*Save the file and run:\n$ reload_alias\n\nNow when you run edit_hosts or the other edit_* aliases, the TextWrangler app should open the hosts file. It will still be locked, but this application can unlock it once you start editing, it will prompt you. You now have a one-line command to edit the root owned files of your choice.\nYou can also alias just the first part of the path:\nalias edit='sudo open -a /Applications/TextWrangler.app/Contents/MacOS/TextWrangler'\n\nwhich will let you execute commands such as\n$ edit /etc/hosts\n\nand still achieve the same results.\nEdit: other answer looks to be a better solution as it does not require the download and installation of another application.\n", "Q: How do I get songs previously purchased on my old iPhone onto my new iPhone? I just got a new iPhone as my old one was broken. My old one was a iPhone 4 and this new is a 4S. Now I purchased songs from on my old phone and when I look at these songs on the iTunes music store it says they are purchased but they are not in my iTunes library, how do I get them there?\n\nA: The iTunes store has a 'Purchased' section that you can use to view and re-download purchased music.\nOpen up iTunes on your computer and select iTunes Store in the sidebar. In the iTunes Store homepage, click the Purchased link in the Quick Links box on the right:\nOnce on the Purchased page, select the Music tab on the left and the 'Not on This Computer' tab on the right. Select All Songs in the list on the left and click the Download All button at the bottom of the page.\n\nOnce your downloads finish you should have all your music in your library, ready to be synced to your new iPhone.\n\nA: On your iPhone, in iTunes.app, on the bottom navigation bar click the button labeled More. There should be a Purchased table cell there. Tap it, then, on the top right side tap where it says \"Not on this phone\". Now tap on the top right side (again) where it says \"Download All\". This should initiate a download of all the songs you purchased through iTunes.\n\nA: I solved the same thing when it happened to me.\nGo to iTunes Store on your new iPhone and you should find it, I think.\n", "Q: Can anything else be done to fix the white screen on a 3G besides restore/upgrade and DFU/restore? Can anything else be done to fix the white screen on a 3G besides restore/upgrade and DFU/restore?\nIt sat in a box for ages, so was completely dead. I plugged it in to charge, got the white screen (oh noes). Left it like that for a bit.\nTried a home+lock 15 second reset, screen went black, came back up to white.\nI did the upgrade->4.2 first via iTunes (latest, 10.6.x), no such luck. Still a white screen. So .. Ok, maybe the firmware didn't overwrite something, let's do a DFU update.\nPut it into DFU mode (took a couple tries, but only like 3 tries, I promise :p) and saw the DFU on iTunes and Windows 7 system tray, so I know I loaded the DFU mode correctly.\nDid the restore, still a white screen. Note: since the 4.2 upgrade I can work it blindly, for things like swipe to unlock, press and hold power for 3 seconds, swipe to shut down. So I know the logic all works, it's literally just the white screen.\nAny last takers on tips before I consign it to the bin? (give it back to my buddy who had it in a box and thought it would work)\n\nA: If everything but the display works, you can try adjusting your display cabling and/or replacing the display unit. On that model, the digitizer is not tightly coupled to the display, so you can get a piece on ifixit. I remember once breaking the display on my third gen nano. It went white. Probably a defective display, but nothing that can't be replaced. \nBefore messing with it, I'd definitely give it a shot at the Genius Bar, if you're local to one. They have diagnostic tools and such. \n", "Q: Uk apple shop won't fix my phone under EU warranty My iPhone 4's button has stopped working properly.  I went to the apple shop today to get it repaired, and was told I had to pay £119 as it was 22 months old and outside of the one year warranty.   I then asked why it was not covered for a two year warranty due to EU law enforcing this, which then turned into a pointless argument of the guy at the genius bar continually saying \"we only cover a one year warranty\" in which I gave up and left.  I just do not understand however if I am right or wrong - should it have been covered?\n\nA: This is a legal question, not a technical one BUT... the EU 'law' you are referring to is the European Directive 1999/44/EC.  In the UK, the Sale of Goods Act meets or exceeds most of the directive's requirements, overriding the directive.  The bottom line is, you are almost surely covered, do check what the Sales of Good Act says, see if these chaps chan help you\nhttp://www.adviceguide.org.uk/consumer_e\nand be ready to stir up as much trouble as you can.  I once had to deal with a faulty screen in a new MBP, I did complain, they guys at Apple were not helpful, I kept complaining, calmly (you cannot ever lose it in these situations, because you give the opponent an excuse to stop dealing with you) and after 30 minutes the manager basically rolled belly up and did what I told him he had to do all along.  Be prepared to ask to talk to mangers etc, and take note of times and names.\n\nA: I would add, that Apple has stepped up in linking to consumer rights as well as their standard warranty.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.apple.com/legal/warranty/statutoryrights.html\n\n*http://www.apple.com/legal/warranty/\nGetting into an argument with store staff only weakens your case, since any reasonable person would back off and just ask for facts and what the person can do for them.\nEven if you feel Apple is perfect and always does right by their customer, expecting the staff there to advise you on your rights seems like asking the fox to explain hen house access rules.\nI would read up on what Apple says their policy is and if you feel a staff member isn't meeting that agreement, politely ask to get a second person to confirm that you don't have options in the store to get assistance.\nYou would be better off consulting a local consumer protection group or lawyer if you really feel your consumer rights are not being respected by any company.\nA layman reading of the UK consumer rights is you need to contact the exact seller and not Apple Service to exercise your consumer rights instead of the 1 year Apple Warranty. From those rights:\n\nAny defect or non-conformity of goods with the contract which becomes apparent within 6 months of delivery are presumed to have existed at the time of delivery. After the expiry of this 6 month period, the burden to prove that the defect or non-conformity of goods with the contract existed on delivery generally shifts to the consumer.\n\nSo, if you push it, you might have to prove you didn't damage the button if you don't request service for a button that was defective on initial purchase. Apple's warranty is actually more consumer friendly IMO than your consumer rights in this case so seeking service at 22 months looks like Apple was legally and technically correct to explain to you that they only perform warranty service at the genius bar and that you have exhausted that period where it's Apple's responsibility to perform service under warranty.\n", "Q: how to force sync of calendars on iPhone? I have various calendars from iCloud and Google and it's very often that an event will be deleted from Google calendar but the iPhone will still show it.  The same calendar is on iCal on my Mac and it shows it correctly there. If it doesn't, I can ⌘ + R or ⇧ + ⌘ + R to update it.\nMaybe I'm missing the place or configuration to do the same on the iPhone calendar application.\n\nA: EDIT: This has been fixed in recent versions of iOS. Please see Freewalker's answer which describes simply pulling to refresh the calendars in the Calendars list.\n\nFor deprecated versions of iOS:\nAs of iOS 5 there is no super easy/obvious way to do this. What I have found that works, is opening Settings > Mail, Contacts, and Calendars > Tapping the email account you'd like to refresh > turn the calendar off > wait while it deletes it > turn the calendar back on.\n\nsometimes by forcing a New Event, it triggers syncing.\n\nA: On iOS 6 or earlier, my experience is that the easiest way to sync the calendars is, from within the Calendar App on the iPhone, tap the Calendar Button in the upper left corner. You now have a display with a grey Edit button in the upper left, A blue Done button in the upper right, and down at the bottom on the left is a white clockwise circular arrow. Tap it and it will sync the calendars.\n\nA: In iOS 7 and later:\n\n*\n\n*Open Calendar app\n\n*Tap Calendars\n\n*Drag down to refresh\n\n\nA: I had this problem in iOS 8. For some reason, all the events from my work Gmail calendar disappeared. What I did was go into the settings then into mail contacts and calendars and then selected my work Gmail account. I turned off the calendar, then turned it back on. Then I went back to the calendar, and it started to sync. Hope that helps\n\nA: I was able to refresh my google calendars on iOS 8 by clicking on \"Calendars\" on the bottom of the screen, then just swiping down, just like you would when refreshing your mail inbox. \n\nA: If you open the iCal app on your phone, go to \"Calendars\" and swipe/pull down it will refresh it (you'll see the spinning circle thing). Refreshed and updated it right away. \n\nA: I had this problem today and the solutions above did NOT work.  \nIn my case the problem was I did not have calendars enabled for cellular data.  Since I wasn't on Wi-Fi, my calendar was not updating.  \nThe solution was:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings > Cellular\n\n*Make sure Cellular Data toggle is turned on (shows green).\n\n*Scroll down to Calendars & Reminders.  Make sure toggle switch is turned on (shows green).\n\n\nThat solved it for me!\n\nA: What solved this for me was:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn calendar sync off and back on again.\n\n*Re-enter your Apple ID password in settings.\n\n", "Q: Are retina graphics a burden all Macs (including non-retina) must carry? I'm in the process of downloading a rather chunky iMovie update (1.89 GB), and I'm wondering if the \"Retina support\" described about the update is something my non-retina MacBook must have lingering around?\nI, like pretty much every other person, have a non-retina Mac and are these unused retina graphics are going to be present as inactive redundancies of all interface files/graphics in all retina supporting apps?\n\nA: Yes, retina optimized apps will typically ship with both versions of graphics.\nYou can easily have a look at the retina graphic files yourself by viewing the package contents of the app. They should be located in AppName.app/Contents/Resources. At least for the Apple ones, the retina versions seem to have '@2x' appended to their base name, for example badge-info-N@2x.tiff is the retina version of badge-info-N.tiff.\nWhile you probably could delete these files, it probably isn't a good idea as it will break the code signing, which in it's turns makes KeyChain access impossible without signing the code again, for example.\nAs to how much overhead or 'burden' the retina graphics are, I had a quick look at iPhoto.app (I don't have iMovie installed). In total, the retina graphics seems to add about 10% to the total app size (or in iPhoto's case, about 124MB). I think for a typical user, when most apps are retina-optimized (not sure when/if that will happen), this will not amount to more than 1GB in total.\n\nA: Probably, if you ever poke around in an iPhone app you will see both the retina and non-retina graphics and resources, this would most likely be the approach Apple and third-party developers take. One app bundle means half the hosting costs, and no need to try and detect retina vs. non-retina in the App Store or on download pages. As a plus it allows you to copy the same app from a non-retina computer to a retina one and visa-versa. \n", "Q: Python no longer working, Config directory empty I tried debugging this on my own, but to no avail.

But it seems that's now the case because when I type python into the terminal, it refers to my python 2.7 as you can see from the path above. \nCan anyone help? I was hoping to begin playing around with python after a long time today but this error is making me go crazy! Also, I play around with a lot of things in python and have a lot of packages installed. I have not been able to find a command to list all the packages installed under easy_install.\nCan anyone help with either of my problems??\n\nA: I've solved this problem (I hope)\nI simply went online and downloaded the python 2.7.3 DMG installer for Mac and installed python again. Hopefully, this will let me run everything I want.\nAs of now, easy_install has started working and I'm going to start playing with Django... :)\n", "Q: What is the purpose of the small arrow pointing to applications in the Dock Just curious: Why do some icons have a small arrow pointing at them in the Dock?\n\nA: On a Mac, these \"arrows\" are dock indicators for which apps are currently opened. (the arrows exist in up to 10.4 tiger, but since 10.5 leopard are now little lights)\nThe Mac OS revolves around an application based system, as opposed to Windows' window based approach. What i mean by this is, that in Windows (before 7), closing the last remaining window of an application (such as Firefox), quits the process. This means that the next time Firefox is used, it needs to be loaded again.\nThe Mac OS however, is application based. Applications are launched and remain open regardless if the windows have been closed. These running applications get a dock indicator, while they are open. This system, although consuming more system resources, means that (for example) Firefox is really snappy to open, since the application has been open all along, and doesn't need to be loaded again just because all the windows were previously closed.\nHope that helps, feel free to comment anything I can clarify on!\n", "Q: Any free software for writing HTML? I've written some Objective-C in Xcode before, but I can't find any free software for writing HTML! I need to create a small website for an online course I'm taking, and figured that HTML is the way to go. Thank you for your help!\n\nA: TextWrangler is free, but packed with a lot of features. \n\nA: Now I'm using Aptana- there is a stand alone version, and also just a eclipse-plugin. \nFor HTML you don't need a special software, you can write it on every text editor. but it's really better and faster using a IDE\n\nA: Personally I use a basic text editor with syntax highlighting, Tincta is my favorite, but try and find the best fit for you. Any text editor that can save plain text files would work, anything from echoing into a file to a commercial product like BBEdit or Textmate. If you're hunting for a free editor I'd check the Mac App Store, check out some classics like Emacs and ports (Aquamacs and Emacs for MacOS X), Vim, and GEdit, try TextWrangler, a stripped down version of BBEdit, and test out your google-fu. I'd put links in, but it only let's me put two per answer.\n\nA: As noted you can use any editor for html but ones like Kompozer also provide some form of interactive GUI layout as well as text editing. (For more complexe text manipulation I would also use Aquamacs with the nxml-mode or other css/html modes)\n\nA: Mozilla SeaMonkey\nwhich is based on FireFox, and is free, has a Composer mode, which is a fine basic WYSIWYG tool for HTML authoring with some code-editing tools as well. \nSeaMonkey is kept up-to-date and receives updates whenever there is a new version of FireFox. It is much more up-to-date than Kompozer, which has not been significantly updated in several years and has always been referred to as a \"beta\" product.\n\nA: HTML is a simple markup language and doesn't, arguably, require an IDE like Xcode. I'd recommend anyone starting to learn HTML (and related web tools like CSS and JavaScript) to start with a simple text editor. Learn your skills manually before relying on an app to speed up the process. Most of the time you'll find you can do a lot faster with a really good text editor than an all-in-one IDE. For something free on Mac try TextWrangler.\nTo be honest there aren't that many amazing and free editors/IDEs for websites on Mac OS. For some money there are a lot of amazing tools such as Sublime Text, Coda and Espresso to name a few. If you just need it for a short time it's not likely worth it however all of them currently provide some form of trial period.\nEdit: Changed scripting language to markup language. Not sure what I was thinking.\n\nA: Technically, HTML can be coded using any plaintext editor, like TextEdit (which — strictly speaking — is a Rich Text editor, but can be forced to save as .html). While that's all well and good, it's really no fun. In fact, it's terrible. You don't see what your design looks like, and believe me when I say that coding without visual feedback is the worst.\nIf you want an alternative with a preview, I'm not sure there's a free one. There are some cheap ones, like Coda; while I've never tried it, apparently, it's quite good.\nIf you just want an alternative with code hinting, MonoDevelop has an HTML document creation mode, with appropriate code hints, and HTML5 compatibility.\nBest f luck!\n\nA: Personally\nI try: \n\n\n*\n\n*Smultron, also known as Fraise – version 3 is free and open source (for greater compatibility with features of Lion, there's more modern version 4 at low cost in the App Store) – not a fan, just nice preview and clip\n\n*Komodo Edit – not beautifull but a lot of functions for free\n\n*jEdit (in java) – not really fast but open source!\n\n\nI use Coda 2, it's not perfect but really smart!\n\nMore generally\nA comparison of HTML editors on Wikipedia with an option to sort by cost and software license. Some of the comparisons are with titles that are both free and open source.  \n", "Q: MacBook Pro Freezing My MacBook Pro just started acting up. The screen will flicker and I end up having to reboot my computer. I can still move the mouse around, but that's just about it. Would you have any ideas what the problem may be?\n\nA: Suggestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run Mac in recovery mode (keep holding ⌘ cmd + R on startup), then try to Repair Disk and Repair Disk Permissions using Disk Utility.\n\n*As suggested in Mountain Lion Screen Freeze thread, try OnyX software which allows and to verify the startup disk and the structure of its system files, etc.\n\n*Run dmesg and check /var/log/system.log for more detailed errors.\n\n*Run Console app to check crash logs including backtraces if any.\n\n*Run newproc.d or iofile.d dtrace scripts to find anything suspicious (e.g. sudo newproc.d)\nRelated:\nApple.SE: Mountain Lion Screen Freeze\nApple Discussions: Mountain Lion Screen Freeze (over 177 replies)\n", "Q: How do I move an iPhoto '11 book project from one mac to another I have iPhoto '11 with Photostream set up on my Mac Mini and on my Macbook Pro. I'm getting rid of the macbook pro, but have a photo book I've been working on on it that I want to move over to my Mac Mini (to finish up the work and print it). Is there a way to do this? I have the same pictures on both computers, I just can figure out how to move the project...\n\nA: The only way to move a project is to move the Library that contains it. There is no way to move a book from one Library to another.\n", "Q: Slow typing on iPad I am using:\n\n\n*\n\n*iPad 3\n\n*Prompt (SSH app)\n\n\nThere is about a half-second to 1 second lag between pressing a key and displaying on the screen. This happens even if I use an exernal Bluetooth keyboard paired with an iPad.\nMy friend has a similar issue with SSH on his Android 4.0 ICS tablet.\nThe server I am connecting to is Amazon EC2 Ubuntu 12.04 instance. When I SSH into it on my laptop it runs flawlessly without any noticeable lag. Why is it so slow on the iPad? What are some possible fixes for this issue?\n\nA: When it comes to using SSH on Prompt, which is a super awesome piece of software, there is lag for me as well.  Now, I SSH into servers all the time because of my job and on my computer, there isn't any lag either, but at the same time, there is lag on my new iPad (3rd Generation).\nThe lag that you are experiencing is completely normal when it comes to the way SSH works on tablet like devices.  The internet connection and the software you are using on a MAC, PC, Linux machine is usually tightly integrated into the system of the machine.  Such as with terminal on the Mac, this software is ridiculously refined and made in such a way to be super fast because of its super tight integration.\nPrompt and other pieces of iOS software that use SSH are not true terminals like the ones that you have on your MAC, PC, Linux machine.  They are pretty much emulations of SSH terminals.  All iOS software is sandboxed into its own little area. This sandboxing is good because it provides security but it is back because it doesn't allow certain apps to be as tightly integrated with the system in the same way as a terminal application on your computer.  Because of this there is always going to be a bit of lag from when the when you press a key, it has to be sent across the wire to the server, the server has to accept that the key was pressed and then respond to the terminal with a update to what is on screen.  Not only that, but the software has to reinterpret through emulation everything it is getting back in the stream from the server, which continues to add to the delay that you are experiencing.  \nIt is the same as using VNC or Remote Desktop, no matter how good of a connection you have or how close you are to the machine you are connected to, there is a still a noticeable delay when refreshing. More so than what you would experience on a much more powerful than an iPad desktop/laptop computer. \nIn short, there are multiple reasons for the delay, iOS sandboxing, emulation of an SSH environment, hardware specs, software integration.  But at the same time, it doesn't mean that the software is useless, Prompt is great and I use it all the time on my new iPad.  \nYou can also read more about what happens during SSH here:\nhttp://www.notesbit.com/index.php/scripts-unix/what-is-ssh-how-does-it-work-your-complete-guide-with-simple-practical-solution-linux-unix-windows/\nSo, don't worry about your keyboard, there isn't anything wrong with it. I hope that this helps answer your question.  \n\nA: The keystrokes are sent to the server when you type them and if the servers network connections is slow and it is having to handle many different tasks at once, it may be slow at responding to the information you sent it.\n\nA: I've even SSH'd to 127.0.0.1 on my jailbroken iPhone (with prompt) and I still get a slow response time. But with iSSH and Remoter VNC (with the SSH in-app-purchase) I get a much faster response time, at the penalty of poor support for external keyboards. As far as I can tell, it all depends on the implementation, and despite all of the excellent features in prompt, responsiveness is not one of them. I'm sure this is due to being an emulation of SSH, but I would like to point out that some iOS apps have worse response times than others.\n\nA: The text that appears when you type do not come directly from your keypad. You should understand how the ssh works. The keystokes are sent to the server and then the display is updated from the server. So, basically the lag is due to the network latency not due to bad keypad. \n", "Q: Reinstalling Lion My Mac has gotten pretty dirty from all the stuff I've installed and the files I have accumulated these past months. I have tried reinstalling by holding Command-R and following the process. However, doing so has not cleaned up my file system. In fact all it seems to have done is broken some of my already installed programs (e.g. Xcode and MacPorts). Is there a way to reinstall Lion so that it will behave like its just been taken out of the box?\nI have previously been an Ubuntu user, and in Ubuntu I think I was presented with the option of scraping the existing file system when I do a reinstallation.\n\nA: The different thing to try after booting in to Recovery Mode is selecting the \"Disk Utility\" program first in order for you to erase your existing OS X install.\n\n\n*\n\n*Once Disk Utility is open you can select the Macintosh HD or so named hard drive where your existing OS X install is at, then erase the selected drive from with in the Disk Utility.\n\n*Quit Disk Utility, and then you should be at Mac OS X Utilites window again as pictured below. Then from there select \"Reinstall Mac OS X\" as was done before.\n\n*This procedure should allow a clean install of OS X, as opposed to a re-install over an existing copy of OS X.\n\n\nA: Since Lion doesn't come with a physical installation disk, Apple has invented a way to install Lion over the internet. Apple has dedicated a whole topic about this on their support pages but I found the information there rather unclear.\nInstead, I can recommend you this tutorial by MacWorld. It describes everything you need to clean your entire Mac and reinstall Lion in order to get a machine like it was just when you unpacked the device.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: How do I examine my iPad for malware? Lately I occasionally get redirected to other websites when I load some news websites.\nIt could be a banner redirect I guess, but I suspect something more sinister.\nThe iPad is NOT jailbroken and runs the latest iOS 5\nLast three incidents were  \n\n\n*\n\n*clicking a link in an email from linkedIn which linked to an article on Forbes.com. When the article loaded, it was replaced (or a link popped up in a new window - not sure now) with a site that was surely not a forbes advertiser.\n\n*using the twitter app, I clicked a tweet from spitsnieuws.nl, it opened a pane inside the twitter app with the article, once it had loaded, it was replaced with a site surely not a spitsnieuws advertiser.  \n\n*this URL got replaced after load. So I'm pretty sure it is an ad server issue\nhttp://www.java-forums.org/java-applets/30447-java-print-service-applets-ie.html\n\n*another URL http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2168061/French-electrician-stranded-Moroccan-desert-rebuilt-wrecked-car-motorbike-drove-civilisation.html\nI can only imagine both situations were safari or embedded safari, but I do not know how the official twitter app loads web pages into its own pane\nGoogling for malware on iPad has so far turned up nothing.\nSuggestions? I can of course revert to factory default, but it would be useful to know what I had encountered.\nLooking at the dsn settings, they start with 10. so local to my network - none of my other devices (iPad3, iPhone4/4S, iMac, macBook (yes, I'm a fanboy) ) on the same network shows this behaviour.\nFor now I have cleared cookies and application data. I will try to reproduce.\n\nA: If your device is not jailbroken the odds of malware on iOS are basically 0, at least for what you're describing. There is currently no way anything could be installed without going through the App Store. Even then, a malicious app could only access its own files in its own sandbox. So, no installed app on iOS could modify anything outside of it.\nThis is also why you won't find any app scanning your iPad for malware. A malware scanner would need access to all system files but no app on iOS could do that (except for Apple's own apps).\nThis sounds more like a problem made by the particular websites themselves.\n\nA: I have not heard of any exploit that would produce this behaviour.\nThe fact that the pages DO load, and only switch to another page AFTER they have loaded, indicates to me that the problem lies within the page itself. For instance some \"evil\" Javascript is inserted into the page causing it to redirect.\nIf the problem was in the OS, for instance messing with DNS, I would expect that you would never be able to reach the page and you would immediately be getting the \"evil\" page.\nAd networks have often been used for this kind of abuse because there are many parties providing content for ads, so it is hard to check everything that goes on. I would think that an evil advertisement is much more likely to be the cause of this problem than any malware on your iOS device.\nYou could try using your iPad via proxy and monitor the traffic that comes through. You could set your computer to share its internet connection over Wifi, and run a html proxy on your computer. And then look in the transferred code to see if you can identify the cause of the redirects.\n\nA: Sure sounds like something with the target websites. You could install Wireshark on a laptop with wi-fi, monitor your traffic when you visit the site and see what happens.  You could then do the same from another (working) machine and see if the same HTTP messages are sent/received.\nAlso, now that Chrome is out on the iPad, you could try that to see if it behaves differently.\n\nA: If a malware want to infect in you iPad from Safari, it need a exploit from Safari, if a exploit like that was found and they post it on the news, Apple will fix it to avoid Jailbreak ASAP. So if you running latest iOS and not jailbroken so no need to worry.\n\nA: Are you travelling in Spain when the redirect happens? If so, I'm seeing it here as well and I believe it is the ad serving network serving a geographic ad from Spain (perhaps other countries too) that is redirecting to the porn ads. \n", "Q: Outlook 2011 Keyboard Shortcut for going to Inbox Is there a keyboard shortcut in Outlook for Mac 2011 that allows me to jump back to the main Inbox folder? Under my Inbox, I have a long list of folders that spans more than a full screen. If I'm at one of the folders close to the bottom of the list, let's say Sent Items and want to quickly go back to the Inbox folder, I have to use the mouse to scroll up in the folder list and then click on Inbox.\nIs there a way to go there faster? I remember there being a shortcut for this on Windows if I'm not mistaken.\n\nA: I wrote a little AppleScript to do this. If you copy it to your \"~/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/Office/Outlook Script Menu Items\" folder you can assign a shortcut key to it using System Preferences/Keyboard.\nWorks like a charm.\nThe script is:\non run {}   \n    tell application \"Microsoft Outlook\"    \n        set selected folder to inbox\n    end tell\nend run\n\n\nA: I dont think there is any shortcut available for it. But still here is a list of shortcuts for your reference.\n\nA: I modified the post from thatdamncat a little so that it will change to the mail view if the window is not on there. although if you have multiple main windows this may mess with your flow.  \non run {}\n    tell application \"Microsoft Outlook\"\n        tell the first main window\n            set view to mail view\n        end tell\n        set selected folder to inbox\n    end tell\nend run \n\n\nA: I've been trying to emulate Outlook for Windows' SHIFT-CTRL-I (Go to Inbox) command and came across this script.  I modified the post from @greenwar because it was throwing errors if the main windows was not mail view AND the Inbox was not selected.  Here goes:\non run {}\n    tell application \"Microsoft Outlook\"\n        if view of the first main window is not equal to \"mail view\" then\n            set view of the first main window to mail view\n            if selected folder is not equal to inbox then\n                set selected folder to inbox\n            end if\n        end if\n        -- end tell\n    end tell\nend run\n\nI'm still looking for a way to make this a keyboard shortcut ONLY when Outlook is running.

If yes, which software does it require? (The client machines run on Windows.)\n\nA: Yes, it is possible. But both computers must be running Lion.\nIn the Host Mac go to System Preferences > Sharing > Screen Sharing and enable it. Check the preferences, too.\nIn the Remote Mac just hit Command+K and type vnc:// and the IP address of the Computer.  \n\nA: Yes, you can do this in Mac OS X 10.7 and later. Just set up an account for each user and enable VNC (System Preferences => Sharing => Screen Sharing).\n\nA: Late 2012 Mac Mini with 16GB using RealVNC. On LAN have run 3 active users at once running Xcode 6 simultaneously. Biggest problem is in setting varying screen resolution since Mac has multiple giant screens and The Windows PCs don't. Works great. We could add another user if we wanted to with 16 gigs. \nAs to how this applies to the original question, while one person works on the Mini, two others can log in from Windows workstations on the LAN, all running xcode.  From Windows workstations.  I think that was the original question if I understand correctly. \nI would just add that the setup was remarkably easy.  Install VNC on the mini and on each PC.  That's pretty much it.  Took about 30 minutes to get the kinks worked out.  \n\nA: Not sure how it was 2 years ago when this question was asked but I confirmed that this work out of the box for me now.\nMid 2010 Mac Mini running OS X Mavericks 10.9\nClient machine tested: Windows 7 Pro using TightVNC Viewer, iPad using iTeleport.\nBoth client devices were able to connect to Mac Mini via VNC and log in to different user accounts at the same time.\nOn every VNC session, it will show the mac login window which user can choose to access specific user accounts.\nThough I would agree that it might be using up more resources when multiple users are connected at the same time, furthermore using for development.\n\nA: Mac OS X doesn't support this out of the box, as far as I know, at least not for Windows clients.\nBecause of that you will want 3rd party software such as Aqua Connect or iRAPP terminal server. \nApple have screen sharing, but it is VNC-based (the extensions to 'screen sharing' to allow more than one connection requires a mac client, I believe) and all indications are that the Lion implementation of VNC is broken, especially when trying to access it from Windows clients.\n\nA: You can login several user at a time by enabling \"Remote Login\", however this will enable many user to login via ssh / scp means.  Which might be workable if you want access to terminal tools including xcode's command line interface for building projects you can use things like gcc or xcodebuild via a ssh session.\nIf getting each additional user access to their own GUI is your goal, I am not sure that is possible with the built in VNC server. There is an interesting solution\n10.4: Use multiple simulataneous GUI accounts  noted on Mac OS X Hints that may be the answer to your question, however it was tested on Mac OS 10.4, not sure if it sill works on OS X Lion, etc.\nTheir solution is:\n\nAfter you have two or more accounts set up on one Mac, install OSXvnc and start the server. Once started, Fast User Switch to the other user on the machine.\nNow from another computer, use a VNC viewer like Chicken of the VNC and point it to the Mac. Even though the Mac is logged in as another user, your VNC session goes to the original account, allowing both of you to use the machine at the same time.\nWhen testing, this is seemed to work well, although you have to wonder if there will be problems with system calls from the same programs happening simutaneously. I've only been running this for about two hours, but no problems so far.\n\n\nA: Ok, so it's possible, but there are some issues to do it in a workable way.\nFirst option: Native OS X Screen Sharing feature\n\n\n*\n\n*In the Host Mac go to System Preferences > Sharing > Screen Sharing and enable it.\n\n*In the remote windows machine use a vnc software (client or viewer) such as TighVNC, UltraVNC and RealVNC. They work mostly the same, with some different drawbacks each.\nYou will have problems with windows vs mac keyboard layout and some keys wont't work. Mostly the Mac alt / Option explained here: Can't get Alt (Option) key to work while remote controlling a Mac from Windows with VNC\nThe performance (speed) will be terrible. And the viewer speed settings won't do anything due to poor compatibility with the mac implementation of VNC.\nTo activate the multiple-user concurrently / simultaneously function, you may need to activate fast user switching functionality on OS X.\nSecond option: 3º Party VNC Server software\nI used RealVNC. Others may workout the same:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install RealVNC server on the host mac\n\n*Install RealVNC viewer on the windows\n\n\nPerformance will improve considerably, better keyboard compatibility including the missing keys and Copy and Paste support across host and client computers. (server and viewer)\nBut you won't have the multiple users option. Every viewer will connect to the same user on the mac.\nThird option: 3rd Party VNC Server software together with Native OS X Screen Sharing feature\n\n\n*\n\n*Do option 1 and option2\n\n*Change the port option 2 uses to allow both vnc software to be enable at the same time.\n\n*Login with option 1\n\n*Start realvnc usermode , not the serive mode (It's located in Application folder > RealVNC folder > Advanced folder > VNC Server (User Mode) )\n\n*Connect with option 2\n\n*Close the option 1 client.\n\n", "Q: Can iTunes reveal which songs are currently on a device? How can I get iTunes to show at a glance which items are already on my iPhone.\nI'd like to add some new tunes to my iPhone, but find myself adding songs that are already on the device.  I start looking through my collection, but I can't see what's already on my iPhone. I'd like to be able to see what's not currently synced to my phone, so I can focus on adding them. \nOn my Zune, all synced items were marked with a little icon so you could see if it was already on the device. Like so:\n\nThe only place where summary information of what has synced is this following screen. (But obviously, it's a really ugly and unpleasant way to browse your music!)\n\n\nA: As I understand your desired functionality, iTunes does not adjust the main library view based on a connected device. You have to select the specific device and see what it contains. \nThe closest you can get is to plug-in your iPhone into your computer so it appears under Devices in iTunes. If you click on the little arrow in front of your iPhone's name, you can browse its content easily.\n\nIn addition you can also see which playlists, artists, genres and albums get synced in the  Music section of the syncing window.\n\nA: Yes - the screen you posted has the key to solve your dilemma.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make one normal playlist with the name of your device.\n\n*Drag any song you want on the device into that playlist. (You can even open a second iTunes window so you can use one window to browse and the other to serve as a convenient place to drag artists, songs, mixes, whatever you want into that playlist.)\n\n*Only sync that one playlist to your device.\n\n\nNow you can know at a glance which songs are on that device whether it is connected or not.\n", "Q: Sync a computer as an iPod: Is a way to sinc one computer's iTunes library from another in the way of an iPod available?

Copying files and creating a fresh iTunes library every \"sync\" seems unproductive.\n\nA: I would highly recommend looking into iTunes Match.\nIt allows you to sync all your music across multiple computers, iPads, iPhones, and iPods.  Not only that, but it will let you stream music that is in the cloud that you have synced and not on your computer.  This may be a good solution for you when you want to listen to songs but don't have them on your machine.  It is 25 dollars a year and it does require a internet collection to stream.\nYou can also just download a playlist of songs you want to listen to if you need to have the songs with you when you don't have an internet connection. \nIt also syncs playlist together between all your machines.  Also, in iOS 6, it will allow you to stream the music as well. \nIt also works with music that you have ripped and not purchased.  \nYou can read more here:\nhttp://www.apple.com/itunes/itunes-match/\nI know it isn't the most perfect solution but at least it will probably save you from a few headaches of trying to make sure things sync between the hard drive and your external.\n", "Q: How do I create and save multiple iPhone backups in iTunes? I had a near death experience this weekend. After purchasing a new 13\" MacBook Pro I migrated all my data from my old MacBook Pro over to the new one and in the process with iTunes auto-backup/auto-sync I almost lost all of my iPhone data. By going back to a full back up that I preformed right before the migration I was able to recover the iPhone data but it was too scary for comfort.\nBy default iTunes keeps only one backup of the iPhone or iPad data. I would feel a lot more comfortable if I knew that I had at least one archive version of my data. Is there a way to create and save multiple backups? If so how is it done?\nThanks.\n\nA: Well, there is always the option to copy the contents of\n~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup\n\nto some other place on a regular basis.\n\nA: \nIs there a way to create and save multiple backups? If so how is it\n  done?\n\nOther than manually or programmatically copying the files from ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup to some other location, Time Machine is your best solution here, and will provide months of mobile device backups. You are running Time Machine on your Mac, yes? If not, a small external USB hard disk is really cheap insurance. Purchase 2 of them and have rotating backups. Keep one drive off-site for peace of mind.\n\nA: In iTunes, choose Preferences.\nNext, choose the Devices tab. You'll be presented with a list of Device backups. Select the most recent backup for the device in question.\nInvoke the popup menu for that backup; three choices are available.\nSelect Archive and the backup will be archived with date and timestamp.\nNow you have an archive that won't be overwritten on the next backup cycle. Do this with every backup you want to archive and you'll have a library of multiple backups.\nSee example here: \n\nA: Using the latest realise of 3rd party soft DiskAid you can keep versions of your backups by choosing the Backup & Archive feature.\n\n...and also define whichever location you want to store those.\n\n\nA: Correct me if I'm wrong but I have a mac and I have never had to manually save or copy multiple back-ups to iTunes. This has always been done automatically. When I click to restore a previous back-up, I have the ability to select which one I would like to restore. I once restored five different back-ups (some were from several months to almost a year earlier) in the same night.\n\nA: As far as I know, you can't have multiple iPhone backups on one and the same computer unless, you create multiple iTunes libraries and back up the iPhone via a new library each time (which is in itself a PIA). On PC there is a workaround worth checking out\nHow to save multiple iPhone backups without overwriting the old ones\nbut the method uses neither iTunes, nor iCloud. \n", "Q: How do I revert iTunes contact sync? I first upgraded my operating system (Windows Vista) and then iTunes.\nDuring the upgrade, I accidentally chose contact syncing should prefer my Windows' contacts over my iPhone's contacts. Now I've lost my phone's contact directory.\nHow do I revert the iTunes contact sync so I can get my iPhone contacts back?\n\nA: I'm Michael and I work for connex.io, an address book app.\nYou can probably retrieve your contacts by taking the following steps:\n\n*\n\n*On your iPhone go to Settings -> iCloud\n\n*and disable ‘Contacts’\n\nThey should re-appear.\nIf you want your contacts to be safer, you can always try connex.io. With our service you will always have your contacts with you. So even if you lose your phone, your contacts will still be in the cloud. It can also sync, de-duplicate, merge, clean, complete and update all of your contacts automatically. So you connect your devices once and then you will always have your contacts where ever you need them.

I don't care about erasing its whole content. I have a bunch of CDs, and I want to know how can I restart this machine so it boots from the CD and reformat the whole system. I am very new to MAC world. \nI realise this is a MAC 101 question type, but I need to start somewhere......\nThanks :-)\n\nA: You can restart while holding down the C key to boot from a valid Mac OS X Install CD / DVD for that G5 based Mac. To pick and choose what disk your machine can boot from hold down the option key while starting the Mac.\nAlso depending on which version of Mac OS X is installed there are different ways to reset the password in single user mode. This may be an option for you if you just want to  unlock and add / remove users and you have a startup CD/DVD for that Mac.\nSee  Changing or resetting an account password for some instructions on how to reset the password.\n\nA: Do we have a FAQ?

Right now I have to go into each reminder and delete it - something that is particularly cumbersome on the iPad, but easier on the iPhone.\nIs there an easy way to delete completed reminders, or have it do that automatically?\n\nA: There is an option in Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars\nYou can set it to only Sync Reminders 2 Weeks Back\nThat's the lowest value you can set.\n", "Q: iTunes 11: Viewing albums by Date Added? I buy music on a regular basis, so it's important to me to be able to see what albums I've just added to my collection. That way I can listen to my new purchases easily, without having to remember some obscure band name that's buried deep within my collection.\nI used to be able to do this in the Zune software, is it possible in iTunes 11?\n\nA: Yes, just right click on the top of the list, where it says Album, Artist, etc, and check 'Date Added'. This doesn't work in the album art view, but does work in the list view (the first two options). \nThis should work by song (its how the Recently Added playlist works), but most of my music is added by an album or single. \n\nA: Sure - just make an intelligent playlist with the following criteria:\n\n\n*\n\n*date added in the last week\n\n*mediatype is music\n\n\ndon't forget the checkmark for refresh automatically at the end\n\nA: I know this answer is a bit late. Here's how you can view songs by date added in iTunes 12.3: \nGo to Songs/Show columns/stats and click on \"date added\" (shown below)\n\nAfter you do this, there will be a \"date added\" option on the top bar. Just click on it and you'll see all your songs in the order that they were added.\n", "Q: How to transfer large videos from iPad 2 camera roll to Windows XP? iPad 2 16GB WiFi iOS 5.1.1\nWindows XP SP3 All updates installed\nI have one video on my iPad 2 that is 24:13 in length that I filmed myself and stored in the camera roll. My goal is to upload it to YouTube directly or via my computer.\nHere is what I have tried so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click \"Send to YouTube\" when viewing the video in the Photos App. I get the error that the \"Video is Too Long\" even though my iOS is up to date, I am on WiFi and YouTube has a 10 hour limit.\n\n*Plug the iPad in to the USB drive and drag and drop the video from the iPad to my desktop. The file appears to transfer after a few minutes of copying, however the file is always 0 bytes so it doesn't actually work. Mind you I am doing the drag and drop method, not using the Windows Camera Wizard which has issues with large files.\n\n\nSo what can I do to put this video on YouTube? I have replicated this problem with another iPad 2 and another Windows XP computer and it appears that others have had this problem go unsolved from other discussion boards.\nIs it really impossible to get a ~20 minute video from my iPad 2 to YouTube or my own computer without the use of 3rd party software? I thought this thing was supposed to \"just work.\"\n\nA: There's an iOS app called Photo Transfer App that should do exactly as you want. Transferring from iPad to Windows. \nNot sure I know the answer to why YouTube isn't taking it. \n\nA: You will get lots of answers since basically two things are conspiring to prevent you from grabbing the file.\nThe first is the iOS file size limit uploading to youtube. I don't have a hard limit, but it's been known for a while that past 5 minutes on most iOS devices, either the youtube API or the software declines to transfer a movie as a direct upload.\nThe second is likely a Windows filesize (or perhaps transfer software limitation) since iOS exposes the camera roll to computers as a camera DCIM folder. This means you can use your choice of transfer software to grab the movie when you connect it without needing iTunes or any other Apple help. Do you have any digital camera software that you could try? If not, simply head to the Apple support article that explains how to transfer these files by navigating directly to them when you connect your iPad.\niOS: Importing personal photos and videos from iOS devices to your computer\nAlso - check that your quicktime is updated and that you try transfering the file to an external drive with enough free space. This seems like something XP should be able to do as long as the destination drive is has a healthy filesystem and you're not exceeing any file size limits.\n\nA: This is my latest method for MOV files. Maybe late in the day for some but anyone else landing here might find my solution handy.\niPad2 via USB to Windows XP.\nGet yourself QuickTime installed on the Windows PC. My version 7 allows for Save As... Maybe you need Pro for that Save As feature.\nPlug the iPad's usb into the PC. If itunes opens up on the PC - kill it.\nYou might have to wait for the iPad to show up in your drive explorer. \nThe one I connect comes up with a drive icon that looks like a snapshot camera without a drive letter. Right click it and choose explore. OK. You can at least read the thing.\nNow launch QuickTime. Use the Open File and open a MOV from the iPad. It will take a while if it's big. When it displays on screen, give it a short play to check it.\nNow use the Save As and save it to a folder on your PC. The progress bar will show up. That will take a while too.\nCheck the PC folder and play it from there to check it.\nThis is working smoothly where drag and drop copying stalled or refused to copy the larger MOV files, over 550 MB in my case though the iPad showed 3.8 GB free space.\n\nA: Ok, there is a way to get those videos off.  It is possible, but you are going to have to accept a few things in order to get things done.\nThe first is that you are on Windows XP, an operating system that Microsoft will be discontinuing support for soon, especially since Windows 7 is a big success and Windows 8 is on the way.  There seems to be some kind of file size limit that has to do with your version of Windows and your file system.  I have not run into any issues with transferring large videos from my iPad or iPhone on my Mac or my Windows 7 Machine, everything just comes over as smooth as butter.  \nSecond, there isn't anything wrong with your iPad.  bmike is right in what he is saying about the youtube file size limit when uploading from your iPad.\nNow, the easiest way to get those videos off in my opinion, which you might not like, is to take your iPad over to a friends/family/coworkers house that has a computer running Windows 7 64bit or a Mac with Snow Leopard or later (Don't forget to bring your transfer cable too).  You will be able to plug in the iPad into these more up-to-date OS having machines and use Windows Photo Transfer or iPhoto on the Mac. Also, you should bring a flash drive/external hard drive with you in order to leave with the video. And hey, no 3rd party software and its technically free.\nAlso, if you plug your iPad into your friends machine and iTunes opens, just close it, you won't be needing to use iTunes in order to do any of this. \nI know it isn't the answer you are looking for and it technically should just work, but it seems that the biggest issue you are facing is that you are running an older OS.  It sucks, I know, it should just plug and play and work but the OS is the thing giving you the problem.  I have had similar issues with things that work perfect in Windows 7 just face planting for no apparent reason in Windows XP.  This is the reason I upgraded all my machines to Windows 7 because it is the most up to date and receiving a lot of support.  It fixed all the little drive issues and bugs that were happening with new peripherals/software/hardware on such an old OS.  Windows XP is 11ish years old after all.\nAlso, I know this doesn't solve your problems in the future, if you take a huge video again, you will still have the same issue until you upgrade your OS or buy another machine.  \nI really hope that my answer helps you out even if it's not in the spirit of no additional tools in case no one else has a better solution for you.\nUPDATED\nYou have informed me that you are working on a machine that is locked down by your job, a work computer from a company.  This complicates things further and continues to make my answer one of the easiest and simplest answers for you.\nYou need to use a different machine that is running an up to date OS.\nYour job might be locking something down and not allowing you to do something.  I have done a lot of work with AT&T laptops that are super locked down for too many security reasons, yours may not be as locked down or secure but it might be one of the things stopping you besides the smaller file size limit from your OS and the fact that it is 11 years old.\nI know, it sucks, you want it to work the way you want it too, but you aren't going to get it to do that. I can't put diesel fuel in a regular car.  The engine will not work with that fuel. You need a different engine. You need a different computer. I am not saying to go out and spend money on a new machine but if you plan on doing things that are up to date and in the current mode of technology and things that are currently supported, I would highly recommend getting a home computer that is more updated and current.  You iPad is a year old, the OS your trying to use with it is 11 years old.  I am not trying to sound mean, I am just really trying to get my point across. I understand it sucks that your machine won't do what you want it to do but technology does that sometimes, it gets old and obsolete and new things don't work with the old stuff anymore. There isn't really a way around it.\nI had a similar issue with a friend of mine who had a older macbook pro 2006.  Its a great machine and ran games like WOW and others fine.  But Diablo 3 will not work on it.  He had to buy a brand new computer in order to have it work. He complained because the computer is only six years old.  A lot can happen though in six years.  Its just how technology is. There are always going to be certain things that have legacy support but not everything will and just because it says it does doesn't mean everything will always work or work 100% of the time.  \nSo, in short. If you use a new computer to pull the video off, it should work fine. Your older work-locked-down computer with the outdated OS will not work with it. You will need to get a new machine eventually, so keep that in mind.  Your older computer isn't going to work with a lot of new things going forward, especially when Windows 8 comes out.  \n\nA: Okay, another option is a linux live cd, or live usb pendrive . If the machine can boot from usb or cd/dvd, you can boot it with a live cd/pendrive, like ubuntu live . Then connecting the Ipad to your pc once it is up and running . Also plug a (or other) pen drive into your pc and though the easy to locate file browser locate the ipad (which will be seen as a camera) and open it like a folder (double click) then right click on the video and copy, the use the file browser to open the pendrive and paste . I have not had this issue with machines having an old processor . I have even copied files of great size over usb 1.1 with success . Once in awhile you'll get a stall, but wait like 10 sec. and things resume . It didn't stop working, it was just doing something your progress bar couldn't express . When you are done copying the file just tell Ubuntu live to restart, and at the provided time take out the live cd or pendrive . Then reboot to your XP system which in no way has been altered by this experience .  \n\nA: There are very few ways to do this, the easiest way to do this is download a free app like Dropbox.\nIf you do this you will need to set upa Dropbox account (free) and in the uploads sections hit the + and in your camera roll select the video. Once imported to Dropbox, visit http://www.dropbox.com in your browser and download the video. \nIf you own iMovie for iOS you can create a new project, and add the video. Go back to the main iMovie screen hit export and hit send to itunes. Connect your device to your computer and open up iTunes. In the sidebar click the name of your device and go to the apps section, scroll to the bottom of this page and there should be a list of apps that can share files with your computer. In this list click iMovie, and in the box on the right find (yourprojectname).iMovieMobile. Click this and hit Save To. Once you have saved you can open it up with iMovie for Mac, you can then export it to a normal video file. You should then be able to upload it to YouTube.\nP.S. The most probable reason that you can not directly upload from your device is because the file is too large for the devices small processor.\n", "Q: Can Lion support resolutions higher than 1920 by 1200 on the retina MBP main display? The new retina display MacBook Pro is advertised to have a native display resolution of 2880 by 1800. On the Lion 10.7.4 build, the system preferences limits the highhest resolution at 1920 by 1200.\nCan this be raised easily in Lion?

Fair warning, I am new to Postfix, and this may all be incorrect.\nIt seems various editions of Mac OS X use one of two root directories for mail:\n\n\n*\n\n*/var/spool/postfix\n\n*/Library/Server/Mail\nThese two seem to have been muddled over time. (Note /var is actually a symlink to /private/var, so you often see those used interchangeably.)\nFrom what I can tell, /Library/Server/Mail is a directory that Mac OS X Server uses for its Mail services, which depend on, but are not the same as, Postfix. /var/spool/postfix, on the other hand, is the preferred directory (p. 14)  for Postfix's internal operations.\nThere are two major configuration files which references these directories:\n\n\n*\n\n*/etc/postfix/main.cf\n\n*/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.postfix.master.plist\nYou're seeing the \"No such file or directory error,\" I suspect, because the queue_directory variable in Postfix's main.cf refers to /Library/Server/Mail/Data/spool, which does not exist. On regular Mac OS X (unlike Server), the entire /Library/Server directory doesn't exist. Instead of creating it, try correcting the queue_directory variable to be /var/spool/postfix.\nA second point of inconsistency is in the default settings for launchd, Mac OS X's daemon manager. It isn't necessary to run Postfix all of the time, as launchd can watch a directory for outgoing mail and only run Postfix when there's something to send. To make sure this will happen, the QueueDirectories key in org.postfix.master.plist needs to list the maildrop subdirectory of the directory in main.cf's queue_directory variable. For example, I changed my org.postfix.master.plist file to include:\n<key>QueueDirectories</key>\n<array>\n        <string>/var/spool/postfix/maildrop</string>\n</array>\n\nWith these two directories consistent, Postfix should launch. You should be able to watch /var/log/mail.log while you run:\n$ sudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.postfix.master.plist\n$ sudo launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.postfix.master.plist\n$ sudo launchctl start org.postfix.master\n\nThe last of these commands kick-starts Postfix, so you can watch mail.log for immediate debugging feedback, but again it isn't necessary to execute on a normal basis. Launchd will run Postfix as needed. (If you are certain you want Postfix running all the time, use the KeepAlive key detailed in the launchd.plist man page.)\n", "Q: .bash_profile not running with multiple commands I am having an issue with my .bash_profile script.\nIf I simply have the line\nsource ~/sh/bashmarks.sh\n\nthe bashmarks.sh script runs as expected.\nHowever, if I add an alias\nsource ~/sh/bashmarks.sh\nalias gs='git status '\n\nI get the message:\nNo such file or directory/bashmarks.sh\n\nI should be able to add additional commands after I specify the script correct?

Go to the All Inboxes general inbox or the main account-selection screen to hit the \"Compose new email\" button.\n\nA: In brief, though this isn't an Apple-specific answer, check your settings to see what SMTP servers (not POP3 or IMAP4) you're using and see if it isn't gmail.  I'm pretty sure if you use Gmail to send an email, the return path is set to that gmail account.  This helps bring down the usefulness of a zombie Gmail account for spammers.\nSee a little bit about From, Reply-To, and Return Path here.\nThe deal is that the server stamps the Return Path; it's not something you can edit with your mail handler.  As the above post says, Return Path isn't a client-set header.\nSo to build off of @CajunLuke, if you're reading an email that went to your Gmail account in Mail, then reply using, by default, Gmail, even if you have From and Reply-To set to My.Real.Email@example.com, you'll receive replies via a return path set for Gmail (depending on the replyer's mail hander).\nNote that anything sent with Gmail's SMTP server will return path to your gmail account.  If you use Gmail's SMTP server as your default SMTP server, it'll stamp that gmail return path no matter what your client uses as its mail headers.  Try another SMTP server as your default and see if that doesn't work.  \nIirc.  IANAL. ;)  I do recall having a similar problem with Gmail as the default SMTP server [for me, on Thunderbird, but it's the same in Mail.app].\n\nA: I looked at my outgoing settings and the port had changed.

No desire to do any of the various sharing options, I just want to make sure I keep a copy of the photos in a safe place. Would it be better to use Dropbox? I'm thinking I need to choose one or the other. \n\nA: If you have your Photostream set up in Aperture and on your iPhone, the photos will also get automatically downloaded to your computer. Dropbox has a similar feature, so if you wanted automatic backups, you could set up both Photostream and Dropbox sync and then back up your Aperture library (from Photostream) to your external HD. That way you have three copies, one of which you cannot modify from your phone.\n", "Q: Issue when syncing iPhone to iTunes when adding movies I'm having some trouble with my wife's iPhone (4 running ios5.1.1).\nFirst what works\nIf I plug it into iTunes (10.6.3) it will sync happily, backup happily and appear to work.\nI can also change without issue the photos and apps that are sync'd.\nThen what doesn't\nIf I try and change the movies (or music) that are sync'd (currently none are) then when I click apply the following message is shown. \n\"The iPhone “XXX’s iPhone” is synced with another iTunes library.

How many monitors can the new retina MacBook Pro handle and at which pixels resolutions?  \ne. g. Does it support three cinema displays?\n\nA: The Other World Computing Blog shows that the new MacBook Pro 15\" with Retina Display Can Run 3 External Displays:\n\n\nimage source: http://blog.macsales.com/\n\nThese resolutions were used:\n\n\n*\n\n*Retina on laptop @ “best for Retina”\n\n*iMac used as a display @ 2560 x 1440 via Thunderbolt\n\n*iMac used as a display @ 2560 x 1440 via Thunderbolt/DisplayPort\n\n*LG monitor @ 1920 x 1200  via HDMI\n\n\nQuote from the MacRumors news article on that:\n\nThis makes the Retina MacBook Pro the first Mac -- other than a tower-based workstation like the Mac Pro -- to natively power four displays simultaneously.\n\n\nA: No, the Macbook Pro Retina can support: \n\nDual display and video mirroring: Simultaneously supports full native resolution on the built-in display and up to 2560 by 1600 pixels on up to two external displays, at millions of colors\n\n(emphasis mine)\nSource: http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/specs/\nupdate: It has been dully noted that using the included HDMI connector one can run a third display using a max resolution of 1920 x 1200. \nIt is important, however, to note that one cannot daisy chain more than two thunderbolt displays (at least according to Apple so far).\n\nA: It would appear that when using 60Hz 4K and display port MST on my late 2013 MBP, the \"MST\" feature actually consumes both displayport connectors into a single cable.\nSo when I enable MST, the second displayport connector goes dead. I have not tried the HDMI connector yet.\n", "Q: Restoring a MacBook from backup I have a MacBook Pro that is just being ridiculous, so I'm planning on erasing the hard drive and restoring from a Time Machine backup. I hear that Time Machine will only restore from backups that have been made from the computer.\nIf I erase the hard drive in Disk Utilities will it think the Time Machine back up is a different computer?\nIs it possible to perform a clean install and retrieve all my personal files back from the Time Machine? Rather than just reinstall around my personal files?\nOr even better is it possible to do a clean install and then pull files manually from the Time Machine backup as and when I need them?\n\nA: All of the above are possible.  Thought it is possible to restore from a Time Machine Backup on a Brand new Mac or Newly Installed Drive.\n\nIf I erase the hard drive in Disk Utilities will it think the Time\n  Machine back up is a different computer?\n\nThis won't matter at all because when you do a clean install and then boot, it will ask you if you want to restore from a Time Machine Backup, another computer, etc.  SO that is completely possible.  \nIf you just want files, not preferences or user account information or applications, and you can access the drive on the Time Machine and find the backup folder it uses to do the Time Machine Backup, you can just copy over those files. You can very simply traverse through the folders, BUT DON'T MOVE OR DELETE ANYTHING IN THOSE FOLDERS OR ELSE! \nSorry to use all caps its just important that you don't. I have done this many times. Back up with Time Machine.  New OS comes out.  Erase and Install.  Reset up like a new machine.  Copy over my iTunes and iPhoto and Documents.  JUST DON'T DELETE OR MOVE ANYTHING ON THE TIME MACHINE DRIVE.\nIf you go the other route and do a restore from a Time Machine Backup, it will just make your computer exactly how it was since it last backed up.  I personally like clean installs but some people don't like setting up a computer from scratch every time and reinstalling things.\nWhich ever route you prefer.  I hope my answer helped.\n\nA: I don't understand the I hear that Time Machine will only restore from backups that have been made from the computer part. You can use your Time Machine backup to restore your files on any new computer you have. I doesn't even have to be the same one, that would defeat the purpose of Time Machine (or any other backup mechanism for the matter). \nSay your computer is stolen and all you've got is your Time Machine backup? ;)\nThe only problem you may face is that if there was a problem in your configuration, restoring the whole Time Machine backup will bring the problem back. I'd try that first tho. It's easier to reinstall a second time and do the tedious \"manual\" restore that could have been avoided.\n", "Q: 3G Speed on Verizon 4 vs 4S I need to outfit some of my field staff with iPhones. They will primarily be used as hot spots. On Verizon, is there any appreciable gain in OTA network speed between the 4 and 4S? I know the AT&T version is faster, however I need to stay on Verizon. \n\nA: Since you appear to only want the gains to be for tethering, then I would say no, the 4S would not be worth the money for you.\nThe higher capacity of the 4S antennae's HSDPA is not supported on CDMA, you would need a supporting GSM carrier to take advantage of this. So no, you will not see a difference in network speed itself.\nHOWEVER! Much of the sense of speed is in the phone hardware itself. Your phone needs to render the data it receives in browsers and apps. So you would still likely see performance gains that may appear to be network related, but are not, from upgrading to 4S.\nCaveat: Might as well wait for the new iPhone model this year if you're going to be throwing down any money for handset upgrades.\n", "Q: Is there a way to tell if I can use a SATA III SSD in my early 2011 MBP 15\"? I put my MBP next to the new Retina MBP today, and although the new display was incredibly crisp, and normal usage distance, it's just not that much better than mine as I'd opted for the high res (1680x1050) display. I'd thought I could for a lot more on the display, but it's not enough of a difference to justify cost, so I'm sticking with this, and going to upgrade the HDD to SSD instead.\nI've heard that some of the early 2011 SandyBridge models had a problem with the SATA controller and that they didn't actually support SATA III.\nIs there a way to check this out without actually just installing one to see if it works?\nIntel 6 Series Chipset:\nVendor:   Intel\n  Product:  6 Series Chipset\n  Link Speed:   6 Gigabit\n  Negotiated Link Speed:    3 Gigabit\n  Description:  AHCI Version 1.30 Supported\nI see from the system info that it has a 6gb link speed, but obviously the standard HDD is only SATA II, other than that I'm at a loss to see how to tell.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: I have the low-end MBP 15'' early 2011.\nIt has a SATA3 interface. As I have a SSD build-in, the negotiated link speed is 6Gb/s as well. Benchmarks achieve speeds of up to 510 MB/s, which is clearly SATA3.\nAlso, make sure that you have the latest firmware installed. The early 2011 MBP received firmware updates which enabled full link speed (as of revision 2.2).\n\n", "Q: Bought iPhone 3GS with iOS 5.1, can downgrade to 4.1, any hope of going to 4.2 or 4.3? I'm an iOS developer and have been searching for devices running older versions of iOS to use for compatibility testing.  (the iPod touch I have been using for this purpose recently gave up the ghost)  You wouldn't believe how hard this has been, even on the used market -- either sellers don't specify the iOS version in their item descriptions (meaning you have to take your chances), or they \"helpfully\" upgrade to the latest iOS before selling it.  Anyhow, I thought I finally hit pay dirt when I found an iPhone 3GS whose auction prominently listed iOS 4.x as a selling point.  Well either the guy was outright lying or he didn't know what the hell he was talking about, because when I received the device, it had iOS 5.x on it.  I know I could probably file a Item not as described claim or something to that effect, but I am not in the mood for a long drawn out battle, hostilities, negative feedback war, etc. and so at this point I was ready to cut my losses and live with it running 5.x.\nThat is, until this afternoon, when I was idly playing with TinyUmbrella, and found, to my delight, that Cydia has a saved SHSH blob for this device running iOS 4.1.  Apparently this device must have been jailbroken at some point in its lifetime.  So I was able to restore to iOS 4.1, and jail broke using limera1n.  All is well.\nNow for my question: Is there some way I can get this device to 4.2 or 4.3?  (4.1 is a bit too old for my taste)  My (admittedly very minuscule) understanding of SHSH and related matters leads me to believe that the answer is \"no,\" but I'm asking anyway in the vain hope that there is some hacking trick or something that would make this possible.\n\nA: I'm surprised that you found an SHSH blob for a firmware that low. Consider that a treasure. Unfortunately, though, you can only install the version of iOS that corresponds to the SHSH blob. The blob contains a signature that is unique to the device and unique to the iOS version. It is like the key to your device for that version. It can't be faked, but it can be saved. So in short, you're stuck with iOS 4.1 or 5.1.1, and there isn't anything that can be done now to change that (besides, the change from iOS 4.1 to 4.3 only added AirPlay/Print, Safari's Nitro JavaScript engine, iTunes Sharing, and Ping; which shouldn't be big enough features to worry about unless your app integrates AirPlay).\n", "Q: My download button has moved too far to the right for me to download podcasts directly to my phone I used to download new podcast episodes by going to the podcast on my phone and pushing the \"get more episodes\" button. I have done this for years now and had no problems. \nSuddenly on June 14th the download button has moved too far to the right so that I can't access it to push it and download the podcast. It doesn't work to flip the phone and I can't pull the screen over to access the button. \n\nA: Super frustrating—same thing happened to me. I found that if I went to read the ratings (an option at the top of the screen) and then back, they had moved back to regular position. See if this works for you.\n", "Q: Using a font that came with a Mac App Store app in other apps I'm sort of generally curious about this, since pre-Mac App Store apps one could simply open the font file from within the app's package contents and install it through Font Book to allow use outside that particular app.\nWhen I use Add Fonts from within Font Book to add the fonts, I get the following 2 \"serious errors\":\n\nCorrupt font name\n  - Font basic parsability\n  - System Validation\n\nNow, is this something I'm just not supposed to be doing? As in, am I breaking a rule here? I'm not using these fonts for publication or commercial use - I just want them available throughout the system.\n\nA: In the case of iA Writer, they licensed a commercial font called Nitti Light for use in their application and their application only. That's why you cannot copy it into FontBook and use it elsewhere. Try Cousine from Google Fonts for a free font that is quite similar.\n\nA: It may be they did some custom/proprietary fussing with the font file to make it invalid in general, but still readable to the app. (This fussing could be anything from simply reordering the file's header data to encrypting the file with a key the app has stored internally.)\nIf so, it's probably that the app's makers licensed the font for use in their app and not for general distribution.\n", "Q: Can I connect mini DisplayPort to DVI-D to VGA? I have a mid-2010 15\" MacBook Pro. I have purchased a mini DisplayPort to DVI-D adapter onto which I have connected a DVI-D to VGA (D-Sub) adapter which then connects into my new monitor. The Displays screen seems to recognised the monitor, but the monitor says \"No Signal Detected\". Is it valid to connect mini DisplayPort -> DVI-D -> VGA?\n\nA: No. DVI-D only carries digital signals. Most (if not all) DVI -> VGA converters use the analog signal DVI-I carries. A mini DisplayPort to DVI connector will only pass on digital signals (as you correctly identified by referring to it as a DVI-D signal), so your DVI to VGA adapter is left out in the cold. You need to get a mini DisplayPort to VGA adapter.\nThe reason the computer sees the display is that one of your adapters is identifying itself as a display.\n", "Q: Overnight accelerometer usage I use the Sleep Cycle app almost every night, but am concerned about the \"health\" of the accelerometer in the phone. For the app to work, I set a time frame for it to wake me up, then I lay it on the mattress (not under anything to protect from heat buildup - I've never felt it get warm), and it uses the accelerometer in the phone to track my movement. Nice idea.\nDoes this kind of 7+ hour per night wear matter?\n\nA: No. weather you're taking readings or not from the accelerometer or not, the components inside still move around the same way.\nFor more information on how accelerometers work, check out this insightful, easy to understand by the engineerguyvideos channel on youtube.\n", "Q: Deleted /etc/, can't boot from DVD I accidentally deleted the files in /etc/ (yes into /private/etc) and my iMac gets stuck on a blue screen after the initial apple logo now. I tried to boot from install DVD but it hangs at the apple logo when I do that.\nAny suggestions on how to fix or reinstall the OS?\nThis is an iMac with OS X Snow Leopard.\n\nA: See Startup key combinations for Intel-based Macs (HT1533) for a list of available key combinations during startup. In your case you should use either of\n\n\n*\n\n*C: Start up from a bootable CD, DVD, or USB thumb drive (such as OS X install media)\n\n*Option ⌥: Start up in Startup Manager, where you can select an OS X volume to start from. In your case the volume to select is the OS X Snow Leopard DVD\n\n\nA: My iMac would loose its boot sequence because I had it booting into Windows mode. What Apple told me to do was to hold down the Option ⌥ key while the machine was rebooting. \n", "Q: Vertical lines on iMac I have vertical lines showing up on my 2.16 GHz 2 GB RAM Core 2 Duo iMac. Any idea what's going on and what I need to do to fix it? My computer is also freezing frequently.\n\nA: It could be either a driver issue or a hardware problem. If you are still under AppleCare, I would just take it to a Genius Bar so they can do a diagnosis and see if it's a hardware problem (the easier fix). Otherwise, I'd recommend doing a full backup and installing a fresh copy of OSX.\n", "Q: How to execute a Folder Action or another Automator script when I make changes to a folder? How to execute a Folder Action or another Automator script when I make changes to a folder?\nAnd by changes I mean not just deleting or inserting new file, the most important for me is when the content of a file is changed the action will be triggered.\n\nA: Using launchd, you could save a property list like this in ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ and load it with something like launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/automator_test.plist or by logging out and back in.\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC -//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\nhttp://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd>\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>automator_test</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>     \n        <string>automator</string>\n        <string>/Users/username/Desktop/Test.workflow</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>WatchPaths</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>/Users/username/Desktop/</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>StartInterval</key>\n    <integer>0</integer> <!-- run at most every 0 seconds, by default 10 -->\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nLaunchd only detects changes to files when they are saved atomically (or deleted and recreated every time they are saved). Most OS X apps perform atomic saves, but for example TextMate and vim don't.\n\nA: This kind of requirement goes beyond the simple fsevents hooks exposed as Folder Actions. I’d recommend using Paul Kim’s Hazel, which will allow you to create “watch and react” rules of almost unlimited granularity and complexity.\n", "Q: How can I log in to ICQ using Messages? It used to be possible to log in to ICQ accounts with iChat by using your ICQ login info as an AIM account. However, that functionality seems to have been removed - if memory serves, with the introduction of Lion.\nIs there any way to use ICQ with Messages under Mountain Lion?\n\nA: Setting Server to login.icq.com and Port to 5190, unchecking SSL in Server Settings tab should help.\nAdd:\nEnter only the first eight characters of your password, leaving off any extras.  This consistently worked for me.  I use OSX 10.9 Mavericks and Messages.\nSome have had results leaving the last character off their password.\n", "Q: Is it possible for a mobile phone manufacturer (other than apple) to make their phone sync with iTunes and iCal? I am wondering why some mobile phone company other than apple doesn't make their phone sync up to a Mac in the same way that the iOS devices do, and sync their calendars, music, etc. We can ignore the sync-by-wifi method for now -- even just using the regular cable to USB would be fine.\nIs the barrier to this only a legal/licensing one?  Or is there also a software or hardware technique that is used by apple to prevent this?\n(I am an iOS user that doesn't want a big slab iPhone in my pocket, so I would love it if some smaller phone would grab just the essentials from the mac. That's the context here.) \n\nA: Remember the Motorola ROKR? Apple did license the technology at that point in time to build an iTunes compatible phone with Motorola, before the iPhone era. The Motorola SLVR L7 was one of the other few non-Apple devices compatible with iTunes.\nThere was also the case of the Palm Pre which supported iTunes syncing (unlicensed), but Apple kept breaking the syncing (purposedly?) with new iTunes versions, forcing users of Palm Pre's to search for hacks to get it working again.\nI think this shows that it is technically possible (even through reverse engineering), but Apple is not going to sit by and allow it. This probably is even more true nowadays, as they are fiercely protecting the iTunes/iOS eco-system.\nYou could also use iSync to sync contacts and calendars with many different phone models, but it has gone missing since Mac OS X Lion. Here's a hint to install it again though.\nEDIT:\nFound a quote from Apple regarding \"non-supported\" devices, which illustrates their stance:\n\nApple is aware that some third-parties claim that their digital media\n  players are able to sync with Apple software. However, Apple does not\n  provide support for, or test for compatibility with, non-Apple digital\n  media players and, because software changes over time, newer versions\n  of Apple’s iTunes software may no longer provide syncing functionality\n  with non-Apple digital media players.\n\nAnd here's a reaction from Apple to Business Week regarding the Palm Pre:\n\niTunes 8.2.1 is a free software update that provides a number of\n  important bug fixes. It also disables devices falsely pretending to be\n  iPods, including the Palm Pre. As we've said before, newer versions of\n  Apple's iTunes software may no longer provide syncing functionality\n  with unsupported digital media players.\n\n", "Q: Transferring app account ownership Is it possible to transfer an app from one app store account to another? I want to be able to update some apps that my father bought on his account that are currently on my iPhone, but I'm pretty sure that I'd have to transfer those apps to my account first. Do I need to transfer the apps to be able to update them? If so, how would I do that?\nEdits\nFrom looking at this question, I guess that the only option that I have is to transfer app account ownership to my account in order to update those apps.\n\nA: Like it's stated in the linked question, this isn't possible... As a matter of fact, a lot of users are suffering from this issue and some of them even have contacted Apple about it and here is what Apple said: \n\n... they told me to reset my password so that both userids have the same\n  password. When you get notification that an app is to be upgraded, you\n  will get a prompt to enter your password. The prompt will indicate\n  which userid you bought the app under. I have not had to logon to\n  either id's to see which apps are updated. But you do have to log off\n  and logon in iTunes to see the apps you purchased under that specific\n  userid.\n\nI have multiple accounts myself (one for the US App Store and one for my own country) and I switch accounts in the Settings < Store menu in order to get to donwload/update apps from the different stores.\nIn my opinion, that's the only way to get/update apps bought with different accounts. \n", "Q: How to find the source of a sound on an iPhone? In the last few weeks my iPhone occasionally makes some kind of notification sound.   It's not any of the built-in sounds, and I've gone through all the \"Sounds\" settings just to make sure.  It's a two-step tone on a marimba or something like it, but not the built-in one.  It happens about once every 10 minutes.\nHow do I figure out which app is causing the sound?   There is no other notification.  It's infrequent enough that it's hard to tell whether killing any particular app fixes it,  and I use enough apps that killing them is impractical.\n\nA: Try disabling sound notification permissions for all apps that you don't need sound notifications for in your notification settings (Settings > Notifications, scroll down to Apps and disable from there)\n\nA: I just went through this. I had a sound which was incredibly infrequent (1-4 times a day), not a standard sound, and seemingly random.\nIt was driving me batty. Here's my process:  \n\nGet the iPhone Configuration Utility (near the bottom). This will let you look at recent log entries from your phone's console log --- analog to Console.app. \nWhen your phone is connected, in the left sidebar a \"Devices\" section will appear. Select the phone, and then in the top-tabs, you'll see \"console\" at the far right (see here for a screenshot). \nThe next time a sound occurs, take note of the time, then plug it in, and save the console log to a text file. \nOpen the saved log file in your editor of choice. You'll want to focus on the time the sound happened -- for me, I only knew the time down to the minute, but it sufficed. I think my job was made easier by the fact that my phone was idle at the time.\nHere's what I saw in my log: \nSep 25 15:24:28  CommCenter[68] <Notice>: Release assertion for reason: operation queue is empty\nSep 25 15:24:28  backboardd[28] <Notice>: MultitouchHID: device bootloaded         \nSep 25 15:24:28  backboardd[28] <Notice>: MultitouchHID: detection mode: 6->6   \nSep 25 15:24:28  configd[55] <Notice>: network changed: v4(en0:142.244.166.94, pdp_ip0) DNS Proxy\nSep 25 15:24:28  wirelessproxd[66] <Warning>: CoreBluetooth[WARNING] <CBCentralManager: 0x17e88250> is disabling duplicate filtering, but is using the default queue (main thread) \nSep 25 15:24:28  kernel[0] <Debug>: launchd[4555] Container: /private/var/mobile/Applications/DF67F833-5955-4E49-8101-87B804F5C04C (sandbox)\nSep 25 15:24:30  locationd[52] <Notice>: need a scan, count, 0, 0, lwatchdog, 0.0, interval, 60.0, needWatchdog, 1\nSep 25 15:24:30  locationd[52] <Notice>: scan result, count, wait, 1, retry, 0, error\nSep 25 15:24:30  locationd[52] <Notice>: scan result, count, wait, 1, retry, 1, error\nSep 25 15:24:30  locationd[52] <Notice>: scan result, count, wait, 1, retry, 2, error\nSep 25 15:24:31  mediaserverd[45] <Warning>: 15:24:31.746 [0x379e000] Sub_AudioSessionSetActiveWithFlags: WARNING translating CMSession error: -16980\nSep 25 15:24:34  locationd[52] <Notice>: loc watchdog expired, count, 1, 3         \nSep 25 15:24:34  locationd[52] <Notice>: scan result, count, wait, 2, retry, 0, error\nSep 25 15:24:34  locationd[52] <Notice>: scan result, count, wait, 2, retry, 1, error\nSep 25 15:24:34  locationd[52] <Notice>: scan result, count, wait, 2, retry, 2, error\nSep 25 15:24:37  backboardd[28] <Notice>: ALS: SetDisplayFactor: factor=0.0000  \nSep 25 15:24:37  kernel[0] <Debug>: AppleMultitouchN1SPI: updating power statistics\nSep 25 15:24:37  backboardd[28] <Notice>: MultitouchHID: detection mode: 6->255 \nSep 25 15:24:37  kernel[0] <Debug>: ALS: AppleARMBacklight::setBacklightEnableGated 0 (set level to 0x1d7)\n\nThe key line here is this: Sep 25 15:24:31  mediaserverd[45] <Warning>: 15:24:31.746 [0x379e000] Sub_AudioSessionSetActiveWithFlags: WARNING translating CMSession error: -16980.

Best of luck to those tearing their hair out trying to find something similar. \n", "Q: Should I make my primary user an Administrator or not? For a long time, I have had two accounts on my Mac : an administrator account that I normally don't use, and a \"normal user\" that I use for day-to-day work. I did this because it should be more secure to work in an account with fewer privileges.\nThe drawback is that I get more security popups. And I believe Apple's standard practice is still to give you administrator rights when you do a standard install.\nI will be installing a clean system soon, so my question is: should I continue using two accounts or just have one account for everything? Is having two accounts more secure in practice? or am I just annoying myself for no real reason?\n\nA: Let's differentiate a user being one individual from a user being a single UNIX user account.\nAs for the purpose of limiting privileges to the computer account and not for the individual operating it, creating two separate user accounts in Mac OS X is overkill and if you ask me rather impractical. Even an administrator account lacks the privileges to modify anything system critical without authenticating as the root user, which requires manually re-entering your password.\nThe only significant extra privilege an administrator account has is the ability to switch to the root (privileged) account. If you are familiar with the sudo command in the shell, this is very much the same thing.\nYou would create a regular user account as opposed to an administrator account if you want to limit privileges of the individual operating the computer, for example with kids or employees.\n", "Q: What keyboard command can be used to move the cursor to the end of the next word on the Mac? In Windows and Ubuntu one can move the cursor to the end of the next word in text by pressing ctrl+ left or ctrl+right.\nWhat's the equivalent of this on the Mac?\n\nA: option + left and option + right\n\nA: This is a late return from an outlying precinct on this question, but on my 2014 MacBook Pro using Word 2011, I stumbled on to how to move to the beginning and the end using \n\"fn\" + option + Left arrow, and Rt arrow respectively.\nThese combinations also work for the Word for Mac Preview v 15.8.\n\nA: It's really quite simple: just us Command + right or left. \n", "Q: Is there a Mac utility to create an executable Zip/archive? Is there a corresponding utility similar to the Windows Zip-to-Exe utility?\nI would like to compress an archive with a flash presentation (containing a lot of files), and make it executable in Mac, so it starts with a single click.\nIs it possible?\n\nA: Yes it is possible.  Is it worth the extra time to achieve what you want?  You'd have to be the judge.  My research hasn't turned up any point-and-click solutions so you'd need to use some standard UNIX tools to get the job done. It might take some effort, but you could do it yourself for free :D  If you're only going to need this once or twice, what I mention below might not be worth your time unless you are comfortable with command-line tools. \nOne option that I would use if I were in a pinch for time would be makeself. makeself is a command-line tool that strings together common UNIX programs to achieve the type of result you've mentioned in your question. I've seen this archiver used by companies that distribute software for Linux. The tools necessary for makeself to run are available on your Mac by default.\nmakeself will compress a directory into a self-extracting archive.  It will optionally run a script of your crafting after extraction.  If your presentation can be started by clicking on a single file in MacOS, then this script would be as simple as the command open FILENAME. \nSo your solution could be as simple as a putting the appropriate commands into a post-extraction script and running makeself on the directory you wish to compress. \nAs a quick example, suppose you have a directory of lots of html files that you would like to compress.  When the file is decompressed, you'd like the file index.html to be opened in Safari. The following would get the job done:\nmakeself /path/to/html_directory self_extract_html.sh \"Example\" open index.html\n\nWhat would result is a self-extracting archive named \"self_extract_html.sh\" which (when double-clicked) would extract the files and launch Safari to view the index.html file in the unarchived directory.\n\nA: As far as I remember executable zip archives are not what you imply: by executing them you  don't start a compressed executable file in the archive but you simply uncompress the zip file: in other words the unzip program is packaged with the zip file.\nNow: on Mac OS the system is able to unzip an archive natively you don't need to use tool or to embed it with the archive. A double click will uncompress it on any Mac.\nI don't think that there is a tool that allows you to execute a compressed executable:\n\n\n*\n\n*this would be a security issue: you don't have a way to check the content of the zip file before executing it\n\n*there should be a standard way to decide which executable inside the archive should be executed\n", "Q: Safari does not restore tabs / not Resuming It seems my Safari is not resuming correctly. \nI open some tabs, then quit and when fire up Safari again it's opened like wasn't have any tabs opened before.\nIs it some version bug, or i should look for something in Safari prefs?\n\n\n*\n\n*Safari 5.1.7 (7534.57.2)\n\n*MOX 10.7.4 (Build 11E53)\n\n\nEDIT:\nIn reaction to Michiel i've checked whether i have Resume turned on.\n\n\nA: It's not a setting in Safari, but a general setting.

Yes, I know there is a solution available from Apple for USB 2.0 to fast Ethernet (10/100).\nI am looking for an adapter to plug into a USB 3.0 port, providing me Gigabit (10/100/1000) LAN capability via wired ethernet.\n\nA: StarTech makes the USB31000S, which is a USB 3.0 to Gigabit Ethernet adapter with support for VLANs, jumbo frames and checksum offloading. List price is about USD 55.\nThese are based on the ASIX AX88179 chip, which has drivers for OS X 10.6 - 10.8 available (bottom of previous link). Any other product using this chip would also work.\n\nA: It's not USB 3.0, but the Belkin F5D5055 USB 2.0 Gigabit Ethernet adapter is supported out the box by 10.7 (haven't checked 10.6) and delivers better performance than the Apple 10/100Mbps adapter. I can get speeds of around 35MB/s with my mid-2011 i7 Air.\n\nA: Yes.  I have used Anker's USB 3.0 to Gigabit Ethernet Adapter on my MBP (2008 and 2011), iMac, Surface Pro and various laptops.  As far as OS X goes, it worked with 10.8 through 10.10\nUpdate:  It has been tested to work on El Capitan (10.11) and macOS Sierra (10.12) with no issues.  It was tested on a MacBook Pro 2011 and a 2012 iMac.\n", "Q: Which version of iOS is the May 12 security paper referring to? Apple has published a paper on security controls in iOS, which specific version is this referring to? \n\nA: The given information seems pretty generic to me. A statement of how Apple manages security with the iOS devices seems more plausible rather than how security is handled with a specific version of it.\niOS 5 is referred a couple of times in the paper, though, while no earlier version are, but in a very vague way.\n\nA: I would hazard a guess by saying iOS 5, simply because of the date.\n", "Q: Can you connect iPhone/iPad to Apple TV without WiFi network in place I would like to make a presentation from an iPhone or iPad using an AppleTV and projector. Is it possible to do so without either a WiFi or LAN network in place (like in a bad hotel)? Is the AppleTV able to act as a WiFi/Bluetooth access point so that iDevice can connect to it and show the presentation? Or is that not possible? \nAre there any workarounds for this, or do I have to bring wireless router with me as well?\n\nA: You cannot connect directly to the Apple TV, so you will have to bring a router.\n\nA: If you have a laptop, you could set it up as a DHCP server, and run an Ethernet cable from the laptop to the Apple TV.  Theoretically.\n\nA: You can with a 3G + Data Plan iPad 2 / iPhone and above. \nCreate a Personal Hotspot wifi with a certain name and password.\nHave the Apple TV connect to it. \nNow take you Apple TV anywhere with you. \nTo setup an airplay/projector broadcast.\nStart the Personal Hotspot wifi.\nConnect the Apple TV to any hdmi projector.\nDone. You can airplay your keynote or video to the projector.\nNEXT...\nThis will work with any AirPlay enabled app. Using Keynote with AirPlay is no different. \nTap Keynote to launch it on the iPad, and then open the presentation you want to give.\nDouble tap the Home button on the iPad itself, and the multitasking bar will appear at the bottom of the screen. \nSwipe to the right to reveal the media bar, which has the AirPlay button just to the left of the Volume slider.\nTap the AirPlay button and select Apple TV, then tap the Mirroring switch to turn that on. The TV screen should now have your presentation on it, ready to go. \nYou can also use this method to send the signal from any AirPlay enabled app video-out to an AppleTV.\nEnjoy a \"walk around, ipad in hand\" wireless presentation.\nPS. There are also some older VGA projectors, for those you might need an hdmi to vga \"active\" converter cable to hook the apple tv to it. Haven't tested this, and that cable is around 40-50$.\n", "Q: Transmit - Copy files instead of downloading I have files and directories on an FTP server that I want to copy to another directory. I select them, and option-release to copy into another directory on the same FTP server. However, Transmit starts \"Downloading dir/\" for the files, instead of just copying them.\nHow can I get Transmit to only copy the files? I don't want to download them all to my local server first and then re-upload them, since they are large files and my internet connection gets charged per mb.\nI'm using Transmit 4. \n\nA: There is no copy command among the list of basic FTP commands. You have get (pull a file from remote to local) and put (push a file from local to remote) and that's it. If you want to make a copy of something on an FTP server you first have to download it and then upload it to the new location.\nThere might be FTP servers with extended command sets, but detecting this and writing the necessary special cases for these servers in to Transmit is likely more time consuming than it's worth.\nI don't know of any graphical, remote file access tool that will do what you're asking for: execute the copy completely on the remote host instead of copying them down and then pushing them back up. It's really very rare that a remote file access protocol has a copy command like that.\nFor at-remote copying like that it's best to use a shell. As Gerry mentioned: ssh is the way to go here. With a remote shell, copy commands can be executed and run completely in the remote environment. Saving you bandwidth and potentially a lot of time.\nIf you'd like to see if your remote FTP server has an extended set of commands, try connecting to it using the command line ftp program:\n> ftp user@hostname\n\nAnd then running:\nftp> help\n\nAt the FTP prompt to see a list of commands the remote server supports. It may support an extended set of commands with copy being one among them.\n", "Q: Power Nap support I read that Power Nap coming with Mac OS Mountain Lion will require a Mac notebooks with flash storage. Do they mean that by upgrading an early 2011 MacBook Pro to a Crucial M4 SSD would allow Power Nap to operate?\nAny hints towards this new feature and whether it'll be available to all SSD users, or only the ones that purchased the new 2012 MacBook Pros is greatly appreciated.\n\nA: No. What they meant was that it runs on Macs with \"built-in flash storage\"1. That is to say, the MacBook Airs from 2010 to 2012 and the Retina MacBook Pro, i.e., the Macs with the (semi-) proprietary Flash hard drives and RAM soldered onto the logic board and Thunderbolt ports.\nThis means that it isn't supported by the 2012 non-retina MacBook Pros.\n1 Source: footnote 2 on your link, at the bottom of the page.\n\nPower Nap requires a Mac notebook with built-in flash storage. May require a firmware update.\n\nEdit: As of the official release of 10.8, Apple changed the set of supported Macs for Power Nap to not include the late-2010 MacBook Airs. Update: as of 10.8.2, Power Nap is now supported on late-2010 MacBook Airs again.\n", "Q: How does iPod reproduction counter works? What triggers iPod reproduction counter to add +1? It is currently visible on iTunes and I was wondering if you have to listen untill the very end or a good portion of it, say half way through.\nI don't know if that matters but my device is an iPod Classic 80 GB.\n\nA: Presumably it works the same way as it does in iTunes. Therefore, you must wait for the song to change to the next one by ending for the reproduction count to be increased by one.\nClarifying Edit: The counter increases each time the song changes by it self, either to other one, if there is, or to the menu, if it was the last song of a play list. Therefore, the portion of the song you've listened to has nothing to do with the reproduction counter increase. \n", "Q: charging in power off I am using ipad 1 and I have some charging problem in it so,I want to ask that is there any problem if I charge my ipad in power off mode.\nIf yes yes what can be the problems that can be seen in my ipad\nCan I use Chinese chargers for charging it. \n\nA: You can charge your iPad 1 while in power off mode.\nWith regard to using a Chinese non-Apple branded charger, this is possible. However you should be aware that Apple's chargers are recommended. The price difference between a non-Apple branded charger and Apple's own charger is significant; that difference is because of Apple's design costs and additional safety features.\nKen Shirriff's article showing the inside of an Apple iPhone charger demonstrates why the price difference exists.\n\nA: there are no problems with this. You can swap chargers however you want, although it is recommended that you use ones that are manufactured by apple.\n\nA: The iPad is designed to draw more than the 500mA specified for USB. It even exceeds past 1A that is not unusual anymore these days but still not exactly standard USB2 current.\nSo, with the Apple charger for the iPad you get 10W at 5V and 2A. With any iPhone charger the iPad will only receive 5W at 1A, and most USB2 ports only deliver 500mA, resulting in only 2.5W. The iPad will charge with all of these currents, but it will take longer the lower the current falls.\nMake sure you get a charger that safely delivers at least 1A, better 2A.\nAnd yes, you can charge it when its off. It should be even quicker than charging while turned on.\n", "Q: I'm using Hazel to move photos from the iPhoto catalog into Lightroom. Is this a terrible idea? I use Lightroom and not iPhoto, and I'm on a MacBook Air, so HD space is premium. I want all my PhotoStream photos to find their way into Lightroom. I've set up a Hazel rule that looks at ~/Pictures/iPhoto Library/Masters and searches all the subfolders for images and MOVES them into a separate folder that Lightroom then scans and processes, moving photos into its own folders based on date stamps.\nIt seems to be working well. All the photos in iPhoto are now broken links of course. \nAny non-obvious downsides I should be aware of?\n\nA: As long as your Hazel script is working properly and you don't care about the iPhoto library, I don't see any downsides to this approach. I would just make sure you have all your photos backed up incase something goes wrong.\n", "Q: Can you reinstall OS X on a FileVault 2-encrypted drive? I've been researching FileVault 2 to make sure that I understand it before I enable it on my Mac. While reading Macworld's Complete guide to FileVault 2 in Lion, I encountered an unexpected caveat (emphasis mine):\n\nIt's probably worth mentioning that someone who steals a FileVault-enabled Mac can never shut down or restart the machine without losing access to the booted machine's startup drive. (Although they probably wouldn't realize this until after shutting down or restarting.) This also means they can't install updates that require a restart, let the battery run down to zero, or even wipe the hard drive clean and reinstall the OS to get a \"working\" computer.\n\nThis doesn't make sense to me. In my mental model of FileVault 2, a tiny decryption program stored on the hard drive is loaded during the boot process. This program asks the user for the key and uses it to begin decrypting the drive and start the OS. If you were to reinstall the OS, it would overwrite the decryption program and boot normally.\nWhy can't you reinstall the OS on a FileVault 2-encrypted drive?\n\nA: When you try to run the OS X installer it will refuse to install to a disk encrypted with FV2 and Disk Utility will refuse to partition or erase FV2 volumes.\nThat being said, if you know your cli-fu you can destroy the partitions using the Terminal app included on the installer (which I've done, although now I don't remember if I used diskutil or just brute forced it by overwriting the partition table with dd, point being that it can be done).\n\nA: If you don't care about the data, it's pretty standard (almost doesn't quality as \"cli-fu\" even); from Recovery HD, you can do it all in Terminal (Utilities > Terminal)\nFirst, do a diskutil cs list to see the CoreStorage information on the volume. Grab the longish UUID of the Logical Volume Group you want to nuke (typically near the top of the output; scroll up). Now, diskutil cs delete UUID (where UUID is the LVG's UUID). Requires no knowledge of the key or an authorized user. Just blows the volume away. \nAgain, if you don't care about the data. A completely legitimate example of this is a laptop my predecessor used to test FileVault 2. Didn't use an Institutional key or a local one he left where anybody could find it, and his account was the only authorized user. \n", "Q: When running Windows (or Linux) on a Retina MacBook Pro, what resolution does it report? I use parallels and vm software to run Windows and Linux on my Apple machines. When running Windows (or Linux) on a Retina MacBook Pro, what resolution does it report?\n\nA: Windows\nAccording to AnandTech:\n\nWindows 7 by default starts up at 800 x 600 on the Retina MBP, Windows 8 defaults to 1024 x 768. This behavior isn't specific to this system, the GeForce GT 650M doesn't have native driver support in either OS at this point and these are the defaults for the standard VGA driver in both cases.\nWindows 7 won't expose any resolutions higher than 1600 x 1200 without an actual NVIDIA driver, while Windows 8 will let you select the full 2880 x 1800 panel resolution.\n\nThis is a report about Windows via bootcamp. I don't know how this differs from Windows being used in a virtual machine. It would probably also depend on the options that the VM software offers.\nLinux\nWhen using the NVIDIA drivers on Linux (and on Windows too) you can select the full native panel resolution (2880x1800). You can also select any of a number of scaled resolutions which don't look as sharp. In general, running at native resolution is actually less of a problem for Linux than it is in Windows and OS X because of the way it's designed. There are no blurry fonts on 3rd party apps like on OS X and it is easier to set your DPI so that apps are scaled properly than on Windows (it is set automatically in Linux).\n\nA: According to this thread: http://forums.opensuse.org/english/get-technical-help-here/laptop/476258-howto-2012-retina-display-macbook-pro-opensuse-linux.html\nOpenSuSE needs a little help during installation, but after that seems to run at native 2880x1800 just fine.

The note on the site for this says its for 3 Macs in the same household. A friend and I want to split the cost of the family pack. We don't live in the same household. I had a  chat on the MS Office site with a representative and he said it would be breaking the license agreement to split the license keys between friends. Does anyone know how or if this is enforced?\n\nA: A velociraptor will jump out of your DVD drive.\nSince you are only licensed to use the software in one single household, one of the two of you will be using pirated software, and since you are \"splitting the costs\", the other one will be selling pirated software.\n", "Q: Can I kill pboxd? The \"com.apple.security.pboxd\" process is taking 10-20% CPU, and has been for a while now.\nFrom searching around, it seems that this is responsible for showing the \"open file\" dialog boxes on behalf of sandboxed apps.\nIt seems odd that it needs 40+ MB of RAM and 20% of my CPU to do this, especially since there don't seem to be any such dialog boxes visible right now.\nIs it safe to kill this process?\n\nA: Probably not a good idea. It has a very important job, displaying open and close dialog boxes in sandboxed apps (Most app store apps and some built-ins). Sandboxed apps cannot acess the filesystem directly and rely on this daemond to do it for them. Even if it relaunches, force killing parts of the OS can lead to instability and is generally a bad idea. \nSource: http://arstechnica.com/apple/2011/07/mac-os-x-10-7/9/ (search page for \"pboxd\")\n\nA: If it lets you kill it without being root, odds are that yes.\nThe \"safe\" alternative would be to restart, I guess...\n\nA: As @houbysoft mentioned above, it is safe to kill this app.  How do I know?  I just did it.  My MB Pro fan spun up this morning with a bunch of apps going over 100% CPU usage in Activity Monitor.  I killed all of them, but it looks like pboxd was the source as it was still over 100%.  \nI had to Force Quit it in Activity Monitor to get it to go away and once I did it was completely gone, not running.  I opened Textedit and did a cmd-O to open a file and pboxd came back at a much more reasonable 2-3% CPU usage while it was open.\nSo yes, there is a higher process (securityd?) that governs the state of pboxd and it will get restarted if it is not running (or you Force Quit it).\n", "Q: In iTunes, is there way to switch easily back and forth between tracks in two different playlists or library parts (say podcast and music)?

First, I understand that I'm walking a fine line but, to be clear, I am sticking to the FAQ and I am not asking for hardware recommendations.  Instead, I simply want to know if there are any car stereos out there that have AirPlay built in.  If not, why not?\nThis seems like a no brainer, especially considering that AirPlay has been around for a while.  Nevertheless, other than hack-it-together solutions, I can not find a means of getting AirPlay to work in my car.\nDoes anyone have any insight?  Is there a chance that I'm searching for the wrong type of product (i.e. Apple allows for car stereo manufacturers to integrate with iOS devices through some other means) and that's what I should be looking for?\nAny tips would be helpful.\n\nA: AirPlay works over UDP and it requires that both the sender and receiver device exist on the same TCP/IP-based network. That's generally not possible in your car because you aren't running an 802.11-based wireless network in that space.\nFor wireless audio streaming in your automobile you want to look for a head unit that  supports the Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP). This is a BlueTooth spec that lets two BT-enabled devices exchange high quality audio streams. Your iDevice supports it, you just need an A2DP compatible head unit and you can stream your music to your car system without any wires.\nHappily, there are many head units that support A2DP on the market today, both aftermarket and OEM.\n\nA: Kivic one is what you want; when it gets here!\n\nA: I realize this is an old thread but I thought I'd share.

If the Apple logo was placed such that it\n  was right side up when the lid was opened then it ended up being\n  upside down when the lid was closed, from the point of view of the\n  user.\"\n\nSo when closed, it appeared right-side up from the point of view of the user. But when opened, it appeared upside down from the perspective of on-lookers. Joe Moreno states that \"Opening a laptop from the wrong end is a self-correcting problem that only lasts for a few seconds. However, viewing the upside logo is a problem that lasts indefinitely.\"\nAll of these decisions of course went through Steve Jobs. With the release of the current Macbook product lines, Jobs reversed his decision and had the logo appear right-side up from on-looker's perspective.\nSources:\nUpside Down Apple Logo - \nhttp://blog.joemoreno.com/2012/05/upside-down-apple-logo.html\nThe Upside Down Apple Logo: A Steve Jobs Mistake - \nhttp://www.cultofmac.com/168377/the-upside-down-apple-logo-a-steve-jobs-mistake/\n", "Q: Time Machine stuck on \"Preparing backup\" whenever returning from Boot Camp to OS X I have Windows 7 installed in Boot Camp. Whenever I go into Windows 7 and then go back to OS X Lion, and then run a Time Machine backup, Time Machine is stuck on the \"Preparing Backup\" stage for a long time (roughly 30 minutes). It usually takes 30 seconds in this stage in most cases.\nThe reason it's stuck at this stage is probably because it is re-indexing everything again (per this KB article), but the question is, is there a way to make it so that it does not have to re-index everything again after restarting out of Boot Camp? I think this only started happening in the past few weeks, while I've had Boot Camp installed on this computer for a few years now.\n\nA: Okay so I figured this out a while ago, but I'll post it here too. The problem was I was using MacDrive, which allows me to read and write to Mac partitions while in Windows (using Boot Camp).\nMacDrive sometimes modified files on the Mac partitions even if I didn't open them; I think it sometimes perform optimization actions to speed up the reading of Mac partitions.\nThis means that when I return to Mac OS X, Time Machine notices that a Mac partition was changed while outside of OS X, so it reindexes everything to be sure it doesn't miss anything.\n\nA: If you stop the backup and delete the 2012-09-30-094332.inProgress folder (substituting your exact date and time) as this will let it start cleanly as sometimes it spends more time deciding what has already been backed up partially to the Time Machine destination\nIf you don't have a partial backup on the destination, then you might need to look deeper at spotlight indexing issues or perhaps wait it out over night to see if the volume of files actually needs several hours to sort out.\nI presume you've used Disk Utility to verify all volumes and if not, that might be a good isolating step to perform if this condition persists.\n", "Q: How can I have my Mac mount a network drive when an application launches? I outsourced the storage for my \"iTunes Media\", \"iTunes Music\" and \"Mobile Applications\" using symlinks onto a network drive.\nI didn't outsource the complete media library because of performance reasons with iTunes.\nIt would be nice to connect to my network drive when I launch iTunes as it fails less than gracefully when the network storage isn't already mounted.\nIs there a way to mount a network drive prior to a particular application launching?\n\nA: Using Automator and the excellent SleepWatcher utility, I have a setup that automatically connects to my network drive when the computer starts, then automatically reconnects when the computer wakes from sleep.\nI've written a tutorial in a blog post.\nAn update in response to CajunLuke's question:\nThe Automator app connects to the network drive and incorporates a 10 second delay to ensure the network connection is ready.\nSleepWatcher runs as a daemon, and allows you to schedule the execution of scripts when your computer goes to sleep or wakes from sleep. In this case you configure it to run a shell script when the computer wakes that calls the aforementioned Automator app.\n\nA: And easy solution would be to automatically have your network shares mounted for you when you log in. A program like Network Drive Launcher would aid in automatically scripting and connecting to networked shares when you log in.\nAlternatively you could write an Apple Script that would replace  clicking on the iTunes icon to start iTunes, not ideal since you would have to click the script first.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the AppleScript Editor application.\n\n*Type in the following\n\n\n:\n--open the network location first\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    open location \"smb://... OR afp://...\"\nend tell\n\n--wait 10 seconds adjust this time to meet your needs\ndelay 10\n\n--open iTunes\ntell application \"iTunes\"\n    activate\nend tell\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Save the script File > Save\n\n*Name it what you like but be sure to set the file format to \"Application\" on the \"File Format:\" dropdown.\n\n*Run the script, you can treat it like any other Application.\nLastly, it looks like it may possible to write an Apple Script that does exactly what you want, here is a link to something that may be able to work with some modification. I could not get it to work on Lion, some syntax issues need to be resolved.  Run a script whenever an application opens\n\nWhat you need is an applescript that stays open all the time and performs its tasks periodically. So here's an example applescript for you. Save it as an application and check the \"stay open\" box to make it stay open after you launch it. The way a stay-open script works is there's 2 main handlers, the \"on run\" and the \"on idle\". \"on run\" runs once at application launch. \"on idle\" runs every so often. You set how often it runs by returning a number of seconds at the end of the handler. So here's the example... it sets up the application parameters in the \"on run\" handler and then in \"on idle\" it can check those parameters. Right now this script just displays the results but you can make it do whatever you want at this point.\n  global applicationsToWatch, idleTime ...\n\n\nA: I made a script that connects to a network drive when iTunes is running. You can download it from this gist page (look for the \"raw\" download link).\n#!/bin/sh\n\nHOST=\"hostname\" # AFP server, e.g. server.local or 192.168.1.94 or…\nUSER=\"your_user_name\" # for connection to AFP server\nPASS=\"your_password\" # for connection to AFP server\nVOLUMENAME=\"your_volume_name\" # name of volume to be mounted, typically username on AFP server.\n\nwhile :\ndo\n    if [[  $(ps axo pid,command | grep \"/Applications/[i]Tunes.app/Contents/MacOS/iTunes \") ]]; then\n\n        if [ ! -d \"/Volumes/${VOLUMENAME}\" ]; then # iTunes runs, Server not mounted\n            echo \"iTunes runs, now mounting ${VOLUMENAME}...\"\n            mkdir \"/Volumes/${VOLUMENAME}\"\n            mount_afp afp://${USER}:${PASS}@${HOST}/${VOLUMENAME} \"/Volumes/${VOLUMENAME}\"\n        fi\n    fi\nsleep 2\ndone # start over\n\nBasically, it runs in an infinite loop and checks every two seconds if iTunes.app is running. If so, it checks whether your AFP volume is mounted already, and does so if not.\nYou’ll have to configure the script before running it for the first time, see the variables on top of the script. VOLUMENAME is the name from the normal AFP connection dialog (ssd in this case):\n\nTo check if the thing works in principle: Let’s say the script is on the Desktop, in Terminal type cd ~/Desktop/, then ./mount_afp_when_itunes_running.sh.\nIn case of Permission denied, set the file permissions so that you can run the script with chmod 755 mount_afp_when_itunes_running.sh, then try again.\nFinally, if everything works, you could then launch this script automatically via a Launch Agent. \n\nA: This may be a bit off topic, but there’s no need to symlink the iTunes directories! To select any iTunes library residing anywhere on any disk, just hold ⌥ immediately after launching iTunes. \n\n", "Q: How to securely restore new MacBook air after someone else was first admin user I've just received my new MacBook Air.

I just read this review in the New York Times about the Samsung Galaxy S3. Apparently, the phone comes with the ability to communicate with TecTiles: \n\nsmall, embedded-circuit stickers ($15 for five). When your phone gets near a sticker, it activates some task that you’ve selected from a list of dozens in the free TecTiles app: make a call, send a text, adjust a phone setting and so on.\n\nThis seems like a tremendous idea with a near-unlimited capacity for customization. Does such a product or capability exist for the iPhone or iPad? If not, is there any evidence that suggests Apple is developing such a product?\n\nA: No and no. The TecTiles rely on NFC (Near Field Communications) to work. No iOS device yet shipped has NFC, and it's not particularly likely that any iOS device will come with NFC1. It would be possible to make an iPhone/iPad case that had NFC built-in, but, as iOS has no NFC drivers, you'd have to use a specialized app to use the hardware, and apps have limited ability to perform non-in-app actions for the user (i.e., if it were to compose a text or tweet for you, you'd still have to tap a send button for it to go, which kind of obviates the utility of tapping your device to the tile).\n1 If you believe the rumors and rumor-analysis, Apple's planning on using Bluetooth 4.0's low-power mode to do what Google's trying to do with NFC.\n", "Q: Can I automatically copy a directory after iTunes rips a CD?

I would sincerely love a new MacBook, but I can't justify spending the prices that are being touted by Apple what with life to pay for and everything.  I upgraded my memory to 2GB a while ago, but am thinking of now upgrading the HD to a SSD seeing as the MacBook is still performing OK, just a bit lagging behind the times.\nFor the record, my MacBook is the 2.0GHz Intel Core 2 Duo (13-inch White) MB061LL/A version.  I have upgraded the HDD 2 or 3 times since this purchase in 2008.  The current RPM is 5400, but I have just found out I was missold as I have never knowingly bought a HDD other than 7200rpm (!).\nCrucial recommends their 256GB Crucial M4 2.5-inch SATA 6GB/s SSD. But I know that the SATA controller in my model is only 1.5Gb/s. So is this actually worth the upgrade?\nTo give some idea on usage, I mainly surf the internet for long periods so no real heavy usage apart from spinning or streaming a film now and again. But I will now be looking to use this as my main music recording computer due to my dedicated PC dying.\nThanks in advance\n\nA: Yes,\n... because there are other advantages besides the faster access times.\n\n*\n\n*SSDs work inaudible\n\n*SSDs are shock-resitant\n\n*SSDs use less energy but the total impact is very little...\n\n*SSDs max out the SATA 1 throughput, which your old HDD will probably not.\n\nAlso, you might get a SSD and then use it in your newer Mac which you will buy in a few years. Make sure to get a SSD with a SATA 3 interface - which is backward compatible to SATA 1.\nWhat about TRIM? The current SSDs have very efficient garbage collection which make the need for TRIM dispensable. But as such performances largely differ depending on the hardware manufacturer, make sure to study performance reviews of the SSD which you'll consider.\nI've written some more in this post.\n\nA: I've got the next newer model with a an OWC Mercury Electra 120GB SSD and 6GB of RAM.  The disk performance is roughly doubled but it's far short of a new MacBook Air/Pro with an SSD.  However, there is a caveat.  I get pauses that last 20-30 seconds on a regular basis (say once an hour).  I've never figured out the cause but it happens much more frequently when I run out of free memory and paging starts.  Paging should be fast so it should not be an issue, yet there's a definite connection.  Others have reported the same thing but it's rare to find SSD's in old MacBooks so experience is limited.  I experienced similar, but different, pauses with a 500GB mechanical disk that I was using before.\nBrowsers consume crazy amounts of memory but it's not too bad for me since I have 6GB of RAM.  It might be an issue specfic to my SSD, system, or model but the same issue on a 2GB max system is going to be ugly.\n120GB is tight so going with 240GB is the right idea for size.\nJust to give a feel for the performance differences, I ran Black Magic Speed Test and got around 100 MB/s write and 125 MB/s read compared to a YouTube video of a Crucial M4 128GB on a MacBook Pro 2011 which got about 200 MB/s write and 506 MB/s write.  The OWC is a similar speed drive so the 1.5 vs 6.0 interface is the difference.  I couldn't find any numbers for a stock white MacBook but here's a video that compares boot times.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_hbdkz71xg&sns=em\nHere's a new MacBook Air vs an older one.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecZCe3RUtWA&feature=relmfu\n\nA: *\n\n*Your Macbook can have as much as 3GB of RAM. Check it first.\n\n*Buy an Optical Disk Drive to HDD adaptor on ebay (9.5mm PATA to SATA variant). Put you HDD there.\n\n*Crucial is good. 64GB is enough for me, SATA150 and probably you. Small read/writes are same between different sizes and you will not get those faster linear RW anyway — why pay more when you can have platters to store those big files?\n\n*Still it's wiser to sell your Macbook as is and buy anything unibody(used) for a bit more — you'll get better graphics to help with flash (I have such a notebook and know how pathetically slow it becomes when flash is on). And then max that unibody Macbook with RAM (which is DDR3 and cheaper) and SSD.\n\n\nA: SATA I is still going to be an enourmous speed increase on your existing spinning drive.\nI upgraded to a SATA III compatible drive in my iMac, which only supports SATA II, and initially the auto speed negotiation for my particular drive controller resulted in only acheving SATA I speeds - and it was still a huge improvement.  I got it up to SATA II speeds by forcing the link speed on the drive through firmware updates.  The point being that a good SATA III drive will be backwards compatible for your Macbook, and you'll still benefit from being able to take it with you should you ever upgrade to a machine that supports faster speeds.\nYou may want to look into replacing the optical drive with a caddy bay adapter for the SSD, if you have issues of price/capacity, and use the SSD as boot and your existing drive as bulk storage of data.\n\nA: This is one of those questions where the only valid (enough) answer is \"it depends ...\".\nWe can begin with your question about whether using a Crucial M4 SSD is \"worth it\" in your MacBook. \nNo, it is not. \nAs you pointed out, your MB only supports SATA I with a max throughput of 1.5 Gbit/s. It makes no kind of cost/benefit sense to pay the premium for a recent SATA III capable SSD when your MB will only be able to use it at a fraction of the speeds it is capable of.\nAnother limiting factor is that your MB uses a 667 MHz Front Side Bus (FSB). Strictly speaking this is a memory (RAM) to CPU throughput limitation, not SATA. But I bring it up because it is a factor limiting your MB's overall maximum performance. That is, it is another reason you would not enjoy the full benefit of a SATA III capable SSD. Your MB is unlikely to be able to move data between RAM and the CPU fast enough to stress even your SATA I controller's throughput.\nSo if you ultimately do decide to move to an SSD, I would suggest you consider older SATA II models which would be a better fit to the throughput of your MB. The older SSDs should also be relatively less expensive.\nAnother concern with using an SSD in a MB is if your version of OS X supports the TRIM command. My understanding is that you would need either Snow Leopard (10.6.8) or Lion (10.7). Also, since Apple's OS X only supports TRIM for Apple supplied SSDs, you may still have to jump through hoops to enable TRIM for the SSD you choose to use.\nOf course, not having support for the TRIM command does not make your SSD worthless. However, it can mean that, over time, you will suffer a significant degradation in your SSD's write speed. So it is something you might want to look into further before deciding whether or not to move to an SSD.\nFinally, an SSD is not really a good choice for storing large amounts of data such as music files. You would probably be better served using a traditional HDD with a larger capacity.\nAnother possible alternative might be using Seagate's 750GB hybrid HDD, the Momentus XT. While you will never see the SSD performance from a hybrid, you may get enough of a boost to make you happier using your MB. And you would also have the extra storage space for storing large (music) files.\n\nA: I have a similar white MacBook 2.0gig core 2 duo made in late 2007. I filled up the mem banks with 4 gigs dd2 667, and replaced the original 80 gig hard drive with a 120 gig SSD. I am aware of the 3 gig of ram limitation, and the limited transfer rate of the old serial ATA interface, but overall, the update was cheap a total of $130 usd, for the 2 x 2gig ram and a refurbished ssd drive.\nThe overall result to me is great. Boot time is very low, compared to the same computer back in 2008. Browsing the internet feels natural as if it was a new MAC, NetFlix works great. For few more $$ got OS 10.7, and it works as if it was made for it.\nCompared to a new MacBook Air, the old white plastic should be slower but that new fresh speed is irrelevant to me. I get to keep an optical drive and firewire interface that are absent with the new MacBook Air, and I still having the chance to replace my battery anytime I want.\nTo me it is, indeed a wise upgrade\nDD\n\nA: I have a mid-2007 Macbook that I upgraded to Lion, 4GB RAM, and a 256GB SSD. I was referred to Other World Computing by an Apple tech, recognized by Apple as an authorized parts vendor. If you have not upgraded to Lion, go ahead and do it and will the max upgrade in OS. I think it cost me to about $150.00 for the RAM and SSD upgrade. I know that 3GB RAM is all that your Macbook uses but I went ahead and added 2 2GB modules, which resulted in a noticable improvement in performance. With the 256GB SSD upgrade, the Macbook now boots up in 20 seconds and runs great. My 16 year old uses it for high school work. You might find it interesting that I bought a 2012 Macbook Pro with an i7 Quad-core, 8GB RAM, and a 500GB SATA, which was a little slower due to the SATA hdd. I immediately upgraded my Macbook Pro to a 500GB SSD, provided a great boost. OWC prices are very competitive and their products are great. \n", "Q: Mac OS X Disk Imaging Software I'm looking for some good disk imaging software, so I can store some of my Mac's applications on a flash drive and then export them to a newer machine.

Since the remote triggers action on both the AppleTV and iMac (they are in the same room), I disable the iMac from taking remote signal already.\nBut can I buy another Apple remote, and pair it with the Mac, so that this new remote will not trigger action on the AppleTV?  That is, one remote for the Mac, one remote for AppleTV, and they don't interfere with each other.\n\nUpdate: I actually went down to Apple Store and got another remote, and paired it with the iMac, and confirm that this remote will not trigger any action on the Apple TV, so now each remote works independently... I just put a sticker on one of the remotes to tell which is which.\n\nA: Yes.

I have an iPod Classic (the 160 gig one) that I use, and I want to have album art for all of the songs.\nProblem is, I cannot just use the \"Get Album Art\" option on iTunes, because that will only find art for songs currently on that particular computer, and I have many songs on my iPod that are not on my computer.\nShort of manually adding the art to every album (like I have been doing), is there a way I can get iTunes (or any other program) to go through my iPod and find the appropriate album art for the songs there?\n\nA: There is no way for iTunes to know what is on your iPod if you manage it manually. So the answer is NO.\nI assume you are aware that you risk losing all your iPod-only tracks in case your iPods breaks down, gets damaged or stolen. So it may be a good idea to get all tracks into iTunes (and your computer) anyway.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro with retina display external monitor connections Is it possible to connect two external monitors to a Retina MacBook Pro without using Thunderbolt displays?\nFor example, one connected with HDMI and another using Apple's DVI connector and also use the screen on the laptop.\n\nA: Yes, that should definitely be possible, as both Thunderbolt ports are also mini DisplayPort ports and the other would be connected via HDMI.\nSee also this answer: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/54306/14994\n\nA: Yes. In addition to the HDMI port, you can use either of the Thunderbolt ports as mini DisplayPort ports, just like all Thunderbolt ports.\n\nA: I can confirm this. I have three monitors connected and running in addition to the retina screen. two via the thunderbolt ports and one hdmi\nHowever this caused my retina display to flicker. \n", "Q: Which Personal Hotspot mode uses least battery?

Therefore I was wondering:\nWhich connection type uses the least battery of the device providing the Personal Hotspot service?\n\nA: USB tethering will use the least battery because the phone will charge while it acts as a hotspot. Bluetooth should be next (especially if both devices go into Bluetooth 4.0's low power mode), with WiFi last.\n\nA: USB uses the least power by far, only one radio working, plus the phone may run cooler, some people have had heat issues with extensive WiFi/Bluetooth use.\nI did an more complete comparison of all three types here: WiFi or Bluetooth (or USB) for iPad Tethering\n\"Bottom Line: USB is the best if range isn't an issue, If distance is needed use Wifi with WPA2\"\nSources for heat issues: \nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/2046464\nhttp://forums.macrumors.com/archive/index.php/t-593613.html\n", "Q: When does my one-to-one subscription expire?

But if I activate one-to-one when my MacBook Pro arrives, will I have wasted a month of One to One?\n\nA: I just got a reply from rep at Apple Store, who agrees with CajunLuke above.\nAbout the One to One, do not activate your new One to One until you receive your computer.\nSo that You do not lose those  one month.\nOne to one starts when you activate that code online.\n\nI'm in Japan which explains why the English ain't right.\n", "Q: Is there a way to sort the apps by usage frequncy? I want to know if there's a quick way to find out the number of times one opens each app so that we can know which apps are really used by us frequently and we can sort them in that order.\nI've tried to Google it but couldn't find any information that is really useful. Is it possible to do so?\n\nA: I haven't seen any Spotlight metadata that counts the number an app is launched, you can, however, use the Date Last opened as a reference.\nOpen your /Applications folder and right click on the sort bar (where it says name, date modified, Size, etc.) and select Date Last Opened. Click on that to sort by that column and that's as close as you can get.\n\nIf you're feeling fancy, you can create a smart folder that only shows the apps that you've opened in the last  number of days, weeks, etc. :)\n\nA: No, this isn't a native feature.\nAs of a default installation on iOS 6, this isn't possible. Like you mentioned, desktops in OSX can automatically re-arrange due to use, but iOS does not include any features along this line.\nI would really enjoy this feature. You could always recommend this to Apple.\n\nA: The iOS multi-task bar (double tap on the home button to bring up) displays apps in the order they were last used.  Not a frequency sort, but a last-used sort, which may be closer than your icon arrangement to frequency-or-use, and thus possibly a quicker way to find an app you use frequently.\n\nA: A tool like Alfred could be nice for your workflow and another tool like Slife\n\nSlife is an activity browser for the MacOS X.

The specs are that this battery should hold a capacity of 5600 mAh.\nOSX Lion System Information reports:\n\nFull Charge Capacity: 4936 mAh\nManufacturer: Sony\nCycle Count: 6\nCondition: Normal\n\nWhen fully charged/overnight, the OS will report that the battery is ~97% full. If it's taken off AC power, the OS will report ~4:00 time remaining. The system will sit idle for maybe 2 hours, and will turn off due to battery drain around 90 minutes. It can't be powered back on until AC is used.\nOn restart, Lion will show the battery's status with the warning \"Service Battery\". The battery has ~8% remaining. System Info also shows \"Service Battery\", and the Full Charge Capacity is 2680 mAh.\nIs this normal behaviour for a MacBook Pro with an A1175?\nMy theory is that this is a defective battery. I'm suspicious of the Sony attribute on the System Info as well.\n\nA: No. The service battery warning indicates an abnormal (but perhaps not to be unexpected) situation.  You'll want to call Apple or visit a repair shop for a diagnosis. Chances are 10 to one or more that your battery should be replaced. \n\nA: It sounds like you've got a bad battery, no doubt, and should have it replaced, gratis. While this shouldn't be a problem, it won't hurt to have the most ammunition possible when you arrive at the store or have to place a call to Apple Care. \nTake a screenshot of the \"Service Battery\" menu icon (Shift + command + 3), and collect all the data you can (like the kind you've included in your question). I've had three defective batteries replaced by Apple, two of them close to the 300 cycle mark, which is what Apple guarantees 80% battery health to. The screenshots and data have been instrumental in getting a rapid, no questions asked replacement. Of course, if your battery is showing the health problems that it is after only six (!?!) cycles, then you've got a good shot at it anyway.\nGood luck! \n\nA: How old is the battery? It seems unlikely you would have only 6 cycles on a thousand day old machine. This could simply be normal aging if the battery is also 4 years old like the laptop. That is about as much as you can expect from a battery from Apple or anyone else. \n", "Q: Apple TV with a household of more than one Apple IDs Can you log in more than one account as long as you log off the one that is signed on before signing in another? For instance, if you buy an AppleTV and your house has two other members with different Apple IDs, can each person use the AppleTV as long as the one that is logged on is signed off then another person logs in? Or does it only allow one Apple user use the tv? \nWould each person have to own the AppleTV or can more than one family member share one?\n\nA: This is possible.  You can log out of your Apple TV and have someone else log in.  This can get kind of annoying though. But it is possible.\nIf you have multiple computers in the house though, each with stuff bought with different Apple IDs, and you just want to access the content on the machines, that is very possible too.  You can set up home sharing with one Apple ID on your Apple TV and then on the rest of the other machines.  It has to be the same ID across the different machines but it will let you access all the computers that are on the network from the Apple TV and access and stream the content stored on them.\nYou can find a great tutorial over here.\nYou can still do things the old fashion way and log out and log back in, it can just be kind of tedious.  Home Sharing can really simplify the process if you just want to share content from multiple computers though.  \n\nA: Apple TV software update 5.1 allows for multiple Apple ID accounts to be entered and easy switching between them. This makes family and workplace use much nicer in my opinion. The old way of signing out was painful in practice to do more than as seldom as possible.\n\nA: I think they key is Airplay, if you use the AppleTV as your starting point, then it will only connect via homeshare etc to a single user ID at a time without changing the login, which is a pain if you have a decent password.  But if you take your devices as the starting point, then using your iPod/Pad/Phone or Mac and searching for Airplay compatible receivers, then you can push the content without having to make changes at the AppleTV end.\n", "Q: Some of \"Services\" menu is in Portuguese I tend to assign keyboard shortcuts to the services I use most often.

[MBA vs MBP] I am an indie game developer. I am in love with the Mackbook Air [13 inch], and want to buy it. I was wondering:\n\n\n*\n\n*Will I miss the DVD drive, and upgradability if I am choosing a Macbook Air over Macbook Pro or a Thinkpad Machine? \n\n*Is the form factor and battery backup time worth the choice?\n\n*Is it good for iPhone/Android Development? \n\n*Will I be able to run my favorite open-source tools from Ubuntu, like GIMP/Blender etc.? If not, will I be able to dual boot Ubuntu? (I know I can do Windows)\n[PS: Please don't suggest me the new Macbook Pro Retina, as it is quite an investment to afford. And, I am very new to the Mac world. :-) ]\n\nA: Michiel's answer is quite complete but I think I can contribute a bit more as I'm in a situation similar to yours. I come from series of DELL and Compaq workstations, I switched to the Mac about 10 years ago for work and at home. Now I work on both, a 2010 MBA and old (circa 2008) MBP.\nHere is my experience relative to your questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Will I miss the DVD drive, and upgrade ability if I am choosing a Macbook Air over Macbook Pro or a Thinkpad Machine?\n\n\nConcerning the DVD drive probably not. I haven't used one in 2 years (the one on my MBP broke in 2010). I mostly use the MBA on the go... with the usual dev tools you won't need the drive. With my git repo and redmine for task management I have no problem with sharing data and projects between the computers. When it comes to quick backups I have a stack of USB keys and a NAS for Time Machine. When it comes to DVDs and CDs, rip them and you don't have to deal with the plastic relics anymore.\nConcerning the upgrades, yes you will probably \"miss\" them. You can only upgrade the flash storage on the MBA... The 2010 MBA I use is just enough for Xcode, iPhone simulator, Eclipse, Android emulator and LAMP. If you buy a new one take the 8GB of RAM upgrade as the RAM is soldered to the motherboard. The 4GB will be your first and most limiting bottleneck.\nBut missing the upgrade ability is not the same as really needing it. So it's up to you.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is the form factor and battery backup time, worth the choice?\n\n\nYes & yes. It's genuinely the best thing. Not having to cary an entire desk with you (computer, power supply, cables and stuff) when you have to leave the home/office for a few hours is a relief. Carrying the MBA is equivalent to carrying a magazine (that you can't roll). Put it in a bag or a briefcase and you don't even notice it's there. Also not the least important factor, when you use it outside of the usual desk setup (on the couch, in the train, on the plane, waiting for the boarding...) it's extremely comfortable and light.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is it good for iPhone/Android Development?\n\n\nAs good as any equivalent computer. The mid 2012 MBA is really good. Mind that you can't do native iPhone dev on a non Apple computer, well... You can go the hackintosh way, but boy, it can be a pain in the %$$ when an update breaks the compatibility with your hardware.\n\n\n*\n\n*Will I be able to run my favorite open-source tools from Ubuntu, like GIMP/Blender etc.,? If not will I be able to dual boot Ubuntu? (I know I can do Windows)\n\n\nYes, most of the tools (when not distributed as apps) compile on OS X. Also have a look at the multiple open source distributions systems: MacPort, fink, homebrew, rudix. Check each of your tools as there is no general rule.\nIf you can't run your tools natively you can always use a VM: VirtualBox, VMWare Fusion, Parallels Desktop or dual boot to any OS you like.\n\nConcerning other aspects of the MBA the screen is very good. I was worried it would be too small, but when my MBP failed I switched to my wife's MBA and got used to it in a mater of days.\nThe flash storage is great, hard drive intensive tasks are improved, boot time is very short (but that's tertiary as I reboot only once per a month at most).\nGrab an external Ethernet adapter. For initial/full backups over LAN and in other situations it will be very useful.\nYou don't need a mouse. Contrarily to all the laptop PCs I owned, the mac has a truly unrivaled trackpad. It's so good I never cary a mouse with me. It seems like a secondary feature but wait until you get used to it and all the gestures...\n\nMy MBP is fixed now, and my wife reclaimed her MBA otherwise I would still be using it instead of my MBP.\n\nA: You'll do just fine with a MacBook Air, at least, that's what I'd go for (and I'm in love with the Air as well :))\n\nI will miss the DVD drive, and upgrade ability if I am choosing a\n  Macbook Air over Macbook Pro or a Thinkpad Machine?\n\nWho uses a drive more then 2 times a year these days? I don't and I think most of the Mac users don't. And if you really need one, you can try Apple's USB Superdrive or if you don't want to pay, you can try the DVD and CD sharing within Mac OS X.\n\nIs the form factor and backup time, worth the choice?\n\nIt's the smallest notebook of the two (MacBook Air vs. MacBook Pro), so form factor will do just fine. About the back-up time, I'm not sure what you mean, but as it's all Flash storage inside, reading and writing to the hard drive will go extremely fast.\n\nIs it good for iPhone/Android Development?\n\nYep. It's full size keyboard and gorgeous screen will allow you to do everything you can on a MacBook Pro, but you'll have a lighter and smaller notebook.\n\nWill I be able to run my favorite Open Source tools from Ubuntu, like\n  GIMP/Blender etc.,? If not will I be able to dual boot Ubuntu? (I know\n  I can do Windows)\n\nYou'll be able to dual boot Ubuntu without any hassle. Here is a good tutorial how to install it using a Flash drive\n\nA: I was looking at going the rMBP 15, but by time I had done the ideal tweaks it was getting expensive. I then looked at the MBA 13 with i7, 8gb RAM and the Thunderbolt 27 display, all up about $3k, still cheaper than a rMBA. This also means if I do upgrade in the future I still have the lovely display on hand. I highly recommend this method as you have great real estate when you are in desk mode and the terrific flexibility of mobility. The 13 MBA has tolerable real estate for VS2010 projects. I do hear the rMBA is on the cards but the text will likely be far to small.\nDeveloping on the MBA is good, and I feel it is pretty bad to make comparisons to my Xeon Workstation at work as this is really the ducks nuts, but the MBA keeps up. I found that booting into windows rather than using the virtual environment is best all round, especially if there's nothing in osx you don't need - as is my case. Please be gentle, but I develope mostly in the fledging Silverlight enviroment and the current project is huge (deal with 14 svc's and 6 separate DB instances in one project). The MBA doesn't handle the SQL DBS due to disk size limits, so deploying a DB to a server rather than local host is a must,for me. Typically I'll only do less intensive development on more serious projects and clean/tweak designs and GUIs. VS plugins slow things down a fraction too, but the 8gb memory makes the difference. When in debug mode the process can typically consume 2gb and saturate the processor (Fourier algorithms for medical image processing is the culprit) but I find it doesn't heat up at all, perhaps flash is to blame?! I also have another SL5 project that is small-medium in size that runs just as it was a work station, and easily suitable in VMWare with 4gb assigned.\nXCode is fine. I attempted to do a mobile interface for some aspects of the same project and was suitably impressed.\nThere are two pricks for me, 1, is the SSD space and cost and 2, adjusting to the keyboard was the thorn as this was my first foray into Mac, but using something constructed so well, that feels so nice was the rose. Being flexible and adapting to how you work a little will make something likes this a great buy!\nGood Luck\n\nA: Why choose the Macbook Air?\n\n\n*\n\n*Fast flash memory. (short boot time, support for Power Nap1,...)\n\n*Slightly higher pixel density: 127 ppi vs2 113 ppi\n\n*Less weight, smaller dimensions.\n\n\nWhy not?\n\n\n*\n\n*Better color space coverage3 of the Macbook Pro display panel (78%-100% vs 56%-79%).\nI personally made the switch from a 15\" MBP (2011) to a 13\" MBA (2012) and I find the difference quite significant. Overall the colors on the Air are more whitish which I could not 'fix' using a custom color profile. The black on the MBP is darker. Both of my MBP and my MBA have (had) a LG display panel.\n\n*Setting up install USBs for Linux distros is still troublesome on Macs.\nIn fact, I've experienced that the official Ubuntu guidelines4 don't work for most people. The optical drive will avoid much pain when setting up Linux distros.\n\n*More disk space, which is also user serviceable.\n\n*Weaker CPU.\n\n*Weaker graphics.\nYes, both the 13\" MBA and 13\" MBP run on Intel HD 4000 graphics, but in the MBP these run at higher clocks: 350-1150 MHz on a  1440x900 display vs 650-1250 MHz on a 1280x800 display.\n\n*Less RAM for the same price.\nThe high-end option of the MBP provides 8GB of RAM at the same price. You can even upgrade the RAM to more than 8GB which MBA can't.\n\n*Ports and other things...\nEthernet port, Audio with subwoofer, Kensington lock slot, SDXC card slot, Firewire (I know, most people don't need all of these...)\nA personal suggestion...\nIn case you are willing to spend $1,499, you could get the $1,199 Macbook Pro 13\" and upgrade to a SSD with the money that you got left - you can get one that's faster than the Macbook Air OEM SSD.\nSuch a solution could be just as costly as similar configured the 13\" Macbook Air, but you get a faster CPU to take advantage of the SSD and more powerful graphics.\n\nA: That depends all on you, what is your answer to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can I live with the smaller screen?\n\n*Can I live with the slower hardware?\n\n*Do I need the degree of portability\n\n\nIf you can answer yes to all these then go for an MBA else if you can't answer yes to both of the first go for an MBP \n\nA: It's a good question. I preffer to work on MBP, because it's bigger(display) and faster, and MBA is better for surfing, reading or watching a movie in a train/airplain. The display of MBA is too small for development.\nBoth of the macbooks have the same OS, that means when you can run a program on MBP, you can also do it on MBA.\nIf you will miss the DVD - only you can say it. Since 2 years I'm having MBP and I have used the DVD-drive only once :)\nMy advice : if you want to work with the macbook, you need the MBP\n\nA: Many iPhone developers have developed many apps on MacBook Airs, even MBA 11s.  There were tons of MBA's seen in use at last weeks WWDC conference.  It would not surprise me if tons of MBAs were seen at next weeks GoogleIO developer conference.  So in the normal case, you will likely miss nothing (unless your vision requires a larger display or your apps require a massive amount of video content and editing, etc.).  You can borrow a desktop system to copy data from DVD's to an MBA.  I upgraded the SSD on my earlier model MBA, no problem.  Get the max RAM you can afford, as that is non-upgradable.\nUnless you like being stuck at a desk, an MBA is a great choice.  Perfect for coding on the train or short flights.\nBut having a large external monitor when at ones office desk helps greatly with proper ergonometrics.\n", "Q: Cmd+3, Cmd+4 not working!

I know that I can right click in the display and view/change the ratings from there.\nCan the ratings be added to the Mini Player view in some way? This would allow me to see the rating and check whether I have already rated that particular song.\n\nA: The new iTunes 11 Mini Player has the option to view and change the ratings. In the Mini Player, hover over the player to show the controls instead of the title of the currently playing song. Then click the small arrow pointing to the right - not the forward control, but the one on the left of the player, next to the album artwork.

I frequently use and edit config files inside /etc on OS X Lion.\nI would like to be able to access this dir in Finder easily, but don't want to unhide hidden files system-wide using defaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles.\nAnyone know how?\n\nA: On my system running Lion (10.7.4), the command sudo chflags -h nohidden /etc revealed the /etc folder at the top level of my hard drive.\nThe -h flag to chflags makes it act on a symbolic link rather than on the linked file.\nThe man page for chflags states \"Unless the -H or -L options are given, chflags on a symbolic link always succeeds and has no effect.\" The behavior I observe when I run it is not consistent with this description: I very much do see an effect when I run chflags on this particular symlink.\nIf that solution doesn't work for you, or if you don't want to make /etc visible to all users on your system but you do want to easily navigate there in the Finder and in Open, Save, etc. dialog boxes, you could run a command like ln -s /etc ~/etc. That would create a (visible) symbolic link to the /etc directory in your home directory. When you double click it, it would open the /etc directory (actually the /Private/etc directory because /etc is a symlink thereto in OS X).\n\nA: Enable ShowAllFiles one more time, long enough to drag /etc onto your Finder sidebar.

As I understand it, Apple does not do currency exchanges when they pay the app developers, they just forward the 70% share in the currency the customers bought it. So, if an app is available in different markets, the developer receives payments in different currencies.\nIs there a way to enter one bank account for every currency? For example, I'd like to set up a bank account in EUR for payments in EUR, one in GBP for payments in GBP, and likewise for USD etc.\nIf all payments are going to the same bank account, my bank charges high conversion rates every time a payment in a 'foreign' currency comes in.\nUPDATE: It seems that this is not possible, nor is it necessary, since Apple seems to forward all payments in USD. Can anyone answer if this is true? Does Apple pay European developers in USD?\n\nA: No you can't, and no that is not what happens when Apple sends you a payment, so there's no reason to do it.\nApple will send you a single payment in USD, regardless of the currencies used to buy your app.\n\nA: The iTunes Connect and Developer portals currently allows only one bank account to be entered per Developer account, no matter how many countries (and currencies) in which an app is on sale.\n\nA: Currently (06/2013), it seems Apple does the conversion and sends aggregate payment in the currency you selected for your account.\nI received a payment that corresponds in amount to worldwide sales, sent in CZK (which I selected when adding the account to iTC). The payment was sent from an UK bank.\n\nA: Update for 2023:\nIt appears that you can provide exactly one bank account. You may specify the preferred currency for your bank account when entering the bank account information. A single payment is made each fiscal month by Apple to the bank account using the currency that you provided.\nRelevant Apple documentation is below.\nhttps://help.apple.com/app-store-connect/#/dev6a92b6d7b says:\n\nIf you meet those requirements, payments are made to the bank account and the currency you provided within 45 days of the last day of the fiscal month in which the transaction was completed.\n[...]\nAll payments are made by direct deposit or electronic funds transfer (EFT.) [...] Apple's bank will consolidate proceeds for each currency in which you have sales on the App Store, resulting in a single payment to your bank each fiscal month.\n[...]\nOur bank converts payment amounts into the currency of your bank account. The exchange rate is established by our bank and, due to Apple's volume, is generally a more favorable rate than used by your local bank.\n\nFor more details, start by browsing using the links under the \"Managing agreements, tax, and banking information\" heading at https://developer.apple.com/support/app-store-connect/.\n", "Q: iPhone 4 (and 4s) won't take a screen shot. What should I do? After owning an iPad for a couple of years, last week I purchased my first iPhone.  I've been well aware of the feature where you press the power button + Home key, and iOS will take a screenshot of the display.\nToday I tried to take a screenshot in my iPhone and after numerous attempts it just won't work.  Could this be a problem with the hardware or is there an alternative way of taking a screenshot?\n\nA: Numerous people have reported the problem above and, unfortunately, this is being caused because you are instructed to \"release both the power and home buttons at the same time.\"\nReleasing two buttons at the same time, at computer processing speeds is impossible, so this could be problematic for some of us.  However, I have discovered that if you follow the mechanism outlined below, you will be able to always take a screenshot.\n\n\n*\n\n*Press and hold the power button.  \n\n*Tap the home button.  \n\n*Release the power button.\n\n\nYour screen will flash, and your image will be saved to your camera role.  This is effectively the same operation as you are instructed to do on every HOWTO page on the internet.  \nHowever, if you were releasing the power button a little faster than the home key, you were preventing the operation from taking place.\nUPDATE\nAfter reading stuffe's comment on Ryokuchasan's answer, I decided to test out a few different way's of pushing these buttons and seeing if I could take a screenshot.\nIt turns out,  The following operations all produced a screenshot, in addition to my instructions above.\nOption #2\n\n\n*\n\n*Press and hold the home button.\n\n*Press and hold the power button.\n\n*Release the home button.  (Image is saved)\n\n*Release the power button.\n\n\nOption #3\n\n\n*\n\n*Press and hold the power button.\n\n*Press and hold the home button.\n\n*Release the power button.  (Image is saved)\n\n*Release the home button.\n\n\nIt was the fourth, and final means of attempting this that has failed.  See below.\n\n\n*\n\n*Press and hold the home button.\n\n*Tap and release the power button. (iOS locks the device)\n\n*Release the home button.\n\n\nThis may be a bug, or intentional.  I think what is going on is that myself, and numerous others have been 'tapping' the power button, while holding the home.  I know this answer is a bit overkill but I think it's worth documenting the full observation of this issue for reference.\nUPDATE #2\nGreat news!  Since iOS 7's recent release, I recalled this problem.  After loading the OS, I attempted the fourth method, outlined above, that wouldn't work.  In this case, iOS took the screenshot and did not lock my device.  Apparently this was a bug and it has been fixed.\n\nA: Many people find it difficult to do. It requires pressing and releasing the Home and Power buttons together very quickly.\nI do it this way:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press and Hold the Power button\n\n*Quickly press and release the Home button.\n\n\nIf you see a momentary flash of white on the display you were successful and will find the screenshot in the Camera Roll of the Photos app.\n\nA: Whatever screen you are on, just hold the home button and then press and release the \"power\" button. your screen will flash and it will save a picture of whatever was on the screen at the time.\nYour photo of your screen will be saved on your Gallery.\n\nTo take a photo with the Camera, simply open the Camera app to start recording or to take a picture.\n", "Q: Word stop when navigating text with option-key I use option and command to navigate text (which is awesome).

For example: development machine is a Mac mini (Intel Core i5 dual-core at 2.3 GHz); emulated test machine similar to a MacBook Air (i5 dual-core 1.7 GHz).\n\nA: One way to accomplish this would be to test the performance in a virtual machine configured to represent a more limited processor. \nAssuming you're using a Mac which came with a pre-installed OS, you'll probably need to buy an additional Mac OS license, but the virtualization can be done for free with VirtualBox, or for a moderate cost with Parallels or VMWare Fusion. \nIn the case of VirtualBox, when you create a virtual machine, you can adjust the amount of RAM, the number of CPUs/cores, and the Execution Cap to limit the virtual CPU to a percentage of a real CPU. I believe Parallels and Fusion offer similar functionality. \nMost virtualization use cases for Mac involve running a virtualized Windows OS, so you will find a lot more information about Windows licensing with these products, but virtual Mac OS is a legitimate option, as long as you comply with Apple's licensing requirements. \nApple allows virtualization of many of their operating systems as long as the hardware platform used is an Apple one, but the specific details vary depending on the operating system version and how you got it. \nFor example, if you buy a Mac with Yosemite pre-installed, you don't get virtualization rights for that OS, but if you get your Yosemite license from the App Store, you are granted the right to run two additional virtual instances of Yosemite on your Mac, as long as it's for \"personal\" or \"development\" use. \nBecause there are different rules for different versions, the best way to ensure you're complying with Apple's legal requirements for virtualization would be to contact Apple directly and explain your requirements.  \n", "Q: iPhone Google Reader client with updating home-screen badge for unread item count? Could you recommend an iPhone Google Reader client with updating home-screen badge for unread item count?\nI'm interested in an app that's able to update the badge while the app is not running.\nUpdate: I'm aware that when you quit an app it can no longer perform certain tasks. However, iOS is capable of receiving push notifications to update badges on the home screen regardless of whether the app is running or not.\n\nA: No Google Reader App that I have used/seen has had an option to do this.  It would require the app to be running in the background and checking, which Apple doesn't technically allow in the case that we are speaking of. This mostly has to do with how Apple gives certain privileges to Apps when multitasking.  It may be something that gets expanded on in the future but I have not seen any apps at the moment that will do what you asking.\nI use the Reeder on both my iPad and iPhone and it has an unread counter home-screen badge but it won't update it will my phone is sitting idle.\nI know it probably wasn't the answer you were looking for but I hope it helps.  Until Apple allows for better multitasking features to be available to developers, we won't see any apps that do this without extreme work arounds by developers or jail-breaking.  \nI don't recommend jail-breaking your iDevice but other will probably mention that it might be possible to do it through that kind of means, but that is your choice to go down that route.\n\nA: The tasks that apps can complete in the background are strictly limited to the following functions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Audio - continue playing audio with requiring the app to be in the foreground\n\n*Location - provision of GPS data to background apps\n\n*VOIP - Maintaining a connection fo Voice over IP applications\n\n*Task Completion - Basically asking for a 10 minute (I'll stick with 10 during this answer, but it may be different) \"pass\" to stay running, ostensibly to complete a task like an upload or download, but often co-opted to just keep the app running for 10 minutes\n\n\nSome included apps, but not 3rd party ones, have extended background capabilities for maintaining mail connnections, downloading into Newsstand etc, but these are not available to us mere mortals.\nStrictly speaking it's true to say that apps can stay running for any purpose so long as they claim to be meeting the above limitations of use.  Sometimes (I think the Sparrow email client tried this) an app can register as a VOIP service, even though it's not, thus enabling it to cheat the system and stay running at all time for some other purpose (in this case mail), but these apps are usually not successful in the review process, and even if they are are quickly pulled afterwards.\nBasically, none of these capabilities will allow an RSS reader to regularly poll for updates whilst not being the active task.  Most will implement the task completion service so any updates that come in within 10 minutes of leaving the app will continue to show etc, but after that you're out of luck.\nSome apps (Instacast is one example) are quite clever about things, and at least combine the task completion capability with local notifications.  When you leave the app, it will continue to download podcasts for 10 minutes.  If they complete in this time, it will  display a local notification, if not, they will register a 2nd local notification that will display saying downloads are paused to trigger when the 10 minutes is up, allowing you to quickly flip back in and out and grant it a further 10 minutes.\n", "Q: Retina MBP - \"time remaining\" not available on menu-bar battery icon?

Does it means that I will be able to restore it without any pain?\n\nA: Look into finding a copy of Winclone.  The main problem for SuperDuper and CCC is the inability to write to NTFS volumes.  They can backup your files, but often not necessarily capture the extended attributes with regards to ownership and permissions etc, resulting in an inability to make a sensible restore.\nWinclone is no longer in active development, but it is effectively CCC for windows/bootcamp partitions.  I've used it to transfer bootcamp partitions from one drive to another in the past.\n\nA: There is no effective way to back up or duplicate your Windows boot partition while booted into Mac OS X.\nThe only effective way to back up or duplicate your Windows partition is to boot into Windows and use a Windows backup utility. There are many available, such as Symantec Norton Ghost.\n\nA: You could use dd to clone the partition bit by bit. Be sure to use the rdisk instead of the disk (should be much faster).\nExample:\nsudo dd if=/dev/rdisk6s1 of=/dev/rdisk7s1\n\n", "Q: iOS iTunes Store app changed podcast page formatting The podcast page format changed recently. I was getting a format that listed the episodes in order and at right would be \"download\" button to download that episode to the Music app. Now it's a down arrow (but it does the same thing). I could press the episode title to listen, but that doesn't seem to work anymore. Also the new page format has a subscribe button that wasn't in the previous format. What's happened?\nWas working as usual iTunes > Podcast then went to use an hour later and all podcasts are in the new format. I have no computer access and tried resets.\n\nA: The iTunes Store app uses a web view, so Apple can update the how the app looks remotely without touching your phone. \nSince all podcasts are free, there's no need for it to look the same as the music purchases. Tapping the podcast title should still work to play it.\n", "Q: Not charging iPhone when using GPS apps I have GPS Drive App Motion X-GPS. I tried to use this app with my iPhone/iPad cigarette charger plugged in, but the battery is keep draining even with the charger to make this app almost useless for long distance driving. I used the charger without any problem with other apps. \nWhy iPhone is not charging with GPS apps? Is this iPhone's known issue? Is this an issue with Motion X-GPS? Or new/better cigarette charger is needed to solve this issue?\nI use Scosche that has 2.1A port, but it doesn't charge when I use this port with iPhone. \n\nA: It's not a bug, it's just because the GPS app is using much more power then the charger can deliver. You should check the amp. of your charger. I have one of 2100 mA and I can use my iPad with Navigon while my iPad is charging.\nThis charger sold in the Apple Store will provide your iPhone enough power to both run the GPS app and charge at the same time.\n\n\nA: This may be a (possibly unavoidable) problem with that particular type of GPS app on that particular device model.\nAn app using lots of graphics GPU features at high display frame rates in addition to continuous access to the GPS radio plus with the cellular radio power turned up in weak cell signal areas might consume more current than the battery charge circuit is capable of replenishing on some device.  e.g. even with a 10+ watt USB charger, the iPhone (operation plus charging) circuitry may only be able to use 5 watts total to avoid overheating.\n\nA: Something is wrong if your high amp charger doesn't work with any device (and with your device in particular).\nYes - it's well known that some GPS apps can use more power than a charger can provide - drawing down the battery over time. I have seen the battery drain about 10% to 20% capacity an hour when everything is operating properly.\nIf your drain is higher than that, then perhaps the phone needs to be restored or there is some problem with the charger. Have you sent the developer a support request to see if you can use a setting to slow down the CPU if it turns out to be a software issue?\nBasically, it depends on how much a deficit your device is running to know what to blame in your instance, but you could test things by enabling the detailed charge indication and testing how long it takes to go from full to 75% charge. Both in the car and in your house connected to the Apple AC adapter.\nIf the car charger isn't keeping up with the wall adapter, then you can replace that. If it's draining equally at home, then it's either the device or the software.\n", "Q: What is barred circle icon in dock after install to new HD? I just bought a SSD for my MacBook Pro and installed Lion on it and restored from a Time Machine backup. After a few updates and configuring a few things I am mostly good to go. However, Xcode and Aperture have a ghostly barred circle over their dock icons. I needed to download some components for Xcode to get it to run, but it seems fine, but the icon is wrong:\n\nI assumed that it meant that there was a problem restoring the application, but I can't find any information on this. I guess I want to know what it means and how to get rid of it.\n\nA: Somehow, there was an error while restoring your backup.  \nSome user blamed Norton Anti Virus (but I doubt you've installed this software), others just re-installed the app. Both cases seems to work for some users, so you could try both :)\n\nA: The icon is used in the Mac OS to identify applications that will no longer run due to OS-level changes.\n\n\n*\n\n*Classic Mac apps (pre-OS X) got the icon in OS X if they weren't Carbonized to run natively in OS X. You could use the Classic environment (essentially an OS 9 virtual machine) to run these apps until Leopard ended support for Classic. \n\n*PowerPC apps got the icon in Lion as the Rosetta emulation system was no longer supported.\n\n*The Dock will also use that icon to show apps that do not exist anymore and cannot be found. (If you put the apps back, the Dock won't remove the icon until it is relaunched.)\n\n", "Q: What are safe CPU temperatures ranges under heavy load in the unibody Macbook Pro? I noticed that under heavy CPU load, the temperature differences between the CPU and CPU heatsink are very high:\n\npicture from iStatPro; 2.0 GHz quad-core i7 (2635QM) Sandy Bridge; Macbook Pro 8.2\nThat's a difference of 41°C! Is this safe? Is this normal?\nWhen using the discrete GPU, an entry \"GPU heatsink\" will show up. The temperature difference between the GPU and GPU heatsink are never more than 10°C. This is why I think that the something's wrong with the CPU cooling.\nI have never removed the CPU/GPU heatsink in this Macbook Pro.\n\nA: This model of MacBook Pro has a totally passive heat sink, so the two temperatures you mention are on the main die / logic board and not some measure of how hot your heat sink itself is running. The only way to correct this difference would be to have a new logic board installed (or get a new CPU mounted on your logic board).\nAs a technician, I'm more worried when the heat sink isn't closer to ambient than to the core when stressing the CPU with constant computing load. Then, it might be worth it to crack the case and re-apply the thermal paste between the metal cover (the CPU heatsink) on the logic board and the finned device (a.k.a. the Mac heat sink part) that gets the heat from the CPU heatsink to the air flowing out the back hinge area of your Mac.\nIf you had a faulty CPU you should be able to expose that in a geek bench test where it would throttle itself down under premature overheating. If you still had warranty left, I would open a support ticket (visit a genius bar or call AppleCare) to document this. They can then enter your concerns and offer a logic board swap if you are out of spec. I've had good luck getting concerns on the record and having Apple cover a repair if they had the chance to cover it under warranty, chose not to, and then the device failed within a few months after warranty.\n", "Q: Which version of gcc is on Mountain Lion? I am looking forward to migrate my c++ code to C++11, which might requires at least g++ 4.6.\nSo what is the GCC installed on Mountain Lion?\n\nA: Mountain Lion doesn't ship with any GCC, but you can install GCC 4.7 . I have done this on my machine.\n\nA: Apple doesn't ship compilers with their App Store OS versions (Lion and now Mountain Lion) so the answer is none.\nIt does provide an llvm-gcc binary that serves as gcc as part of Xcode and the developer tools. This is a free download and you can use it to bootstrap to whatever version of gcc you please if the shipping version isn't to your liking.\nHere is gcc version that ships with Xcode v4.3.3\nAir:~ mike$ which gcc\n/usr/bin/gcc\nAir:~ mike$ gcc --version\ni686-apple-darwin11-llvm-gcc-4.2 (GCC) 4.2.1 (Based on Apple Inc. build 5658) (LLVM build 2336.9.00)\nCopyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\nThis is free software; see the source for copying conditions.

Are the non-retina 2012 MacBooks supposed to look like this?\nWhenever I search for the unboxing/review videos of the newest model, they only review the retina one.\n\nA: It's easy. The non-retina MacBook Pros didn't get a redesign on the outside. They stayed the same (so, no HDMI \"and stuff\"). They only got updated on the inside, so your confusion on differentiating them is reasonable.\nFrom Apple's site - here are images of the new 15\" non-retina MacBook Pro:\n\n\n\nA: If you want an image of the non-retina 15\" 2012 MBP, Apple has one here as a part of this page.\nThe real answer is simply open your System Information - About this Mac ⌘+I window and see that you have a Mid 2012 model.\n\n\nA: You can have a look at the product pages on apple.com, which among other things, lists all tech specs and even has illustrated pictures of all connections and ports:\nhttp://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/specs/13-and-15-inch/\n", "Q: Can't uninstall Mac App Store apps As of late I can't uninstall any Mac App Store apps once they've been installed.\nI follow the standard procedure of opening Launchpad, pressing Option ⌥, and clicking on the little x on the top left corner of the app's icon.\nWhat happens is that the icon vanishes for a second, and then reappears in Launchpad.\nThis is a typical error I get in the Console right after trying to uninstall an app:\n\nLaunchPad: Uninstall failed Error Domain=com.apple.uninstalld.request Code=2 \"ErrorMissingBundle\" UserInfo=0x7fa12509b4f0 {Missing bundle string=/Applications/OmniFocus.app} file://localhost/Applications/OmniFocus.app/\n\nI am running Lion (10.7.4).\n\nA: I finally got it fixed.\nIt turns out it was a Spotlight problem, caused by me adding the Macintosh HD to the Privacy exclusions list in Spotlight.\nAside from preventing the uninstallation of Mac App Store apps, it also prevented updating the already installed ones. Trying to update manually an app would give a \"You have updates available for other accounts\" message. The updates tab on the Mac App Store app would be empty of apps to update, even if there were in fact some with available updates.\nSo I deleted the exclusion, and everything went back to normal.\n", "Q: Is this a potential symptom of a hardware issue? Button visual data is behaving buggy? Recently, I opened my Gmail application on my (brand new) iPhone 4S.  I've been using the phone for a couple of weeks, and I downloaded the Gmail application a couple of days ago.\nAs you can see from the image below, the buttons on the far right started to behave in a funny manner when I launched the application.  I hit the home button and opened the app again, and it still looked like the image below.  So, I double-tapped the home button, closed the app and re-opened Gmail and that fixed the buttons.\nI could choose to ignore this is because it could be a one-off error or it could be a problem with Gmail.  However, I am also aware that this type of visual error can be caused by some form of hardware error.\nDo I have anything to worry about, considering the nature of the error?  Should I take this image into an Apple store and have them service my phone?\nI'd rather get this taken care of if there is something that can be done before to long, especially since my phone is so new.\n\n\nA: If that doesn't happen in any other app, it's likely a bug in the Gmail app. You should raise this issue with Google's support.\n", "Q: How to remove an app stuck in \"waiting\" mode from the Mac App Store? I've got 2 applications that I installed via the Mac App Store that are still in the \"waiting\" mode. How do I get these applications to finish installing? Or how do I remove them and try again?\nBy \"waiting\" mode I mean they are showing a download progress bar and have the word \"waiting\" overlaid their icons inside of the launchpad app. (I would take a picture but it doesn't seem to let me while showing the launchpad)\n\nA: I had a problem with not being able to stop an old OS from downloading. In order to delete it and stop the download, once opening launchpad, I held down the 'option' on my keyboard which caused the apps to wiggle just like on the iphone. I could then click the 'x' and delete them/stop the download.\n\nA: Do not delete or remove any downloaded part or file. Just do the following and it will resume the download.\nIn the Activity Monitor, for example, kill the storeagent process. \nThen restart App Store and click resume. That's it.\n\nA: The actual downloads are done by a process called storeagent, which sometimes get stuck. Exit App Store, kill storeagent (e.g. in Activity Monitor), restart App Store (which will revive store agent) and go back to the Purchases tab where you click on the app to restart it.  \n\nA: Thanks to Jason's response since it got me on the right track.  The icon of the installing icon in LaunchPad would not, however, respond to double clicking.  But when I selected and held the icon (as in 3 fingers on the trackpad) until all the icons started to \"wiggle\", then I could click on the \"X\" on the icon which halted the update.\nThe offending app was \"XCode\" and there is another topic on this site which refers to the problem with trying to update XCode via the App Store.\n\nA: Here's what worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the launchpad\n\n*Hold down on App that is stuck in \"Waiting..\" mode until it displays an 'X' in the upper left corner\n\n*Press Enter and it should finish downloading or exit the infinite loop it's stuck in\n\n\nAgain, this is what worked for me, may not work for everyone but I thought I'd post it.\n\nA: Maybe another apple ID logged in to the appstore - launchpad/appstore is still trying to update software that isn't linked to your apple ID. Log in using the original ID and complete or cancel the downloads, then log in with your own ID again.\n\nA: All my iBooks downloads where in waiting mode too so I decided to kill storedownloadd (os x 10.10.3) which unstuck both app downloads. \n\nA: With the latest update to Mountain Lion I am now able to fix the issue with ease. Now you can double-click a partially downloaded program to throw away all the currently downloaded parts and start over. This only starts working once the computer thinks it has stopped. I'm guessing there is some hidden timeout value that needs to be exceeded to enable this feature.\nIn one case (ClamXav) I had to reboot to get Mountain Lion to recognize that it wasn't downloading any longer. Double-click still worked to restart the download.\n", "Q: How can I force Parallels to ask about re-associating my USB drive with my Mac or VM? When I plug in a USB drive while my VM is running, Parallels offers a dialog lightbox asking whether the USB drive should associate with the Mac or the VM. Once this choice is made, Parallels tends to remember/respect it on every subsequent reconnect. Sometimes I want to change this association, but I don't see how I can. Is there an easy option to change the USB drive's association on the fly? Or do I need to select something to make Parallels forget all USB associations and start over?\n\n\nA: I had the same problem, with a USB disk drive. Parallels was configured to ask each time yet always put the device to the guest I'd first used it on. Choosing Parallels Preferences didn't help. The device wasn't listed as one that had a permanent assignment.\nI think this is expected behavior as the documentation talks about a \"New\" device.\nThe fix for me was to Option-click (Alt-click) the Parallels icon in the Dock and choose Devices -> USB and there I saw the device listed with a tickmark next to it. Selecting the device removed the tickmark. Next time the devise was connected I was asked.\n\nA: Even though you aren't telling it to remember devices, you can remove any 'permanent' assignments by following this guide. This should list all the devices for which it remembers Host vs VM assignments\nSpecifically: \n1. Do one of the following:\n    Option-click (Alt-click) the Parallels icon in the menu bar and choose Preferences.\n    If the Parallels Desktop menu bar is visible at the top of the screen, choose Parallels Desktop > Preferences.\n2. Click USB.\n\n\nA: I have this same problem on my MAC.  In the Parallels preferences, no permanent connections exist.  I can usually get around it by unplugging the drive and plugging in to a different USB port.  Sounds silly, but works.\n", "Q: Associated Voila files to finder by mistake An associate of mine has managed to associate all his Voila files to Finder, and now he just has a bunch of folders for them.  He wants to revert this but, when he does, at Get Info he has no option to re-associate the folders/files to Voila.\nHow can this be fixed?\n\nA: You could reset/unregister Finder file associations with the following procedure:\n\n\n*\n\n*In the Finder, press\n⌘+⇧+U to open the\nUtilities folder.\n\n*Open Terminal.app () in the Utilities folder.\n\n*To unregister the associations, paste this into the Terminal window, followed by ↵ : /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -u /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app -domain user\n\n*To restart the Finder, type: killall Finder, followed by ↵\n\n*Voila documents should be Voila documents again.\n\n\nLet me know if this works!\n", "Q: Why am I getting Facebook push notifications even though I have all Facebook push notifications disabled? I have an iPhone 4S. No Facebook push notifications are activated on my phone. Nevertheless, several times a day I receive a push notification that I have been invited to X event or Y person is in my vicinity. I can't seem to figure out why I'm receiving these notifications and I would rather not get them. Any clue what's behind this mystery?\n\nA: The answer Matthew Frederick gave should do the trick, but if you want to disable them from within the Facebook app itself, the alternative approach is to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Facebook app\n\n*Press the ≡ button in the upper left and scroll down to Settings\n\n*Select Account Settings\n\n*Select Facebook Notifications\n\n*Select Push Notifications\n\n*Uncheck any of the four boxes there\n\n\n*\n\n*Close Friends List Activity\n\n*Group Posts and Comments\n\n*Tags You in a Post\n\n*Mentions You in a Comment\n\n\n\nIf you are receiving additional notifications, they may be coming from the Facebook Messenger app which is separate from the main Facebook app and I believe has it's own settings for push notifications relating to private messages.\n\nA: When you say that none are activated on your phone, do you mean in the Facebook app or in Settings?\nTo check, go to Settings->Notifications, and then scroll down to the Facebook item and tap it. Make certain that you have both \"Notification Center\" set to \"Off\" and have \"Alert Style\" set to \"None\".\n", "Q: Why can't I hide my active application (e.g., Chrome)? This happens from time to time: the \"hide\" option is just grayed out and the usual shortcut doesn't work. I'm not doing anything special or stuck in a modal window—it just isn't available.\n\n\nA: This is OS X default behavior in every app if you have hidden all other apps before with \"Hide Others\" or ⌥+⌘+H. In such a case it's not possible to hide the front most app, that's why both options are greyed out/inactive.\n\nA: Here's a workaround:\nIf you hold the ⌥-key and click the desktop, your app will hide. \n\nA: The same thing happened to me. I figured out that Google Chrome was in full screen mode on another (secondary) display. Consequently, OS X could not hide it.\n\nA: Go to the Chrome to and select \"Show All\", the option will reappear.\n", "Q: iCloud and Comcast Email I have been using MobileMe to sync emails from my two comcast email addresses from Outlook on my PC to my iPhone and iPad.  With MobileMe being turned off at the end of this month it will be necessary to migrate to iCloud.  It was my understanding that I would no longer be able to get email from my two Comcast email addresses synced to my iPhone and iPad after moving to iCloud, rather, only email send to me at my me.com email address would only be synced.\nAm I correct in assuming that email from my two Comcast email addresses will no longer be synced after MobileMe is gone?\n\nA: Depends on what you mean by sync. Yes your comcast mail will not be synced to iCloud.\nHowever you can read the comcast email on the IPad etc (assuming hat comcast is IMAP).\nTo set up the Comcast mail go to Settings->Mail then add accounts. Googolling for Comcast iphone email provides more help including this video.\n", "Q: Is there a way to switch between two folders for iTunes Media, especially for Macbook Air or Macbook Pro for limited storage? For Macbook Air and Macbook Pro, with SSD, the drive might be limited to 128GB or 256GB.  The drive also might have bootcamp for Windows, so that will further decrease the drive's size for Mac.\nWhen the drive is closer to being full, can we \"switch\" between \n/Users/mike/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media\n\nand\n/My Passport/iTunes Media\n\nany time we want?  (My Passport is a Western Digital Passport Drive with 1GB).\nThat seems ok as the Help in iTunes's Preferences says:\n\niTunes Media folder location\nTo change where songs and other files you import into iTunes are\n  located, click Change.\nTo change back to the original location for files (Home/Music/iTunes),\n  click Reset.\n\nThis is also useful if we want to keep, say, 20GB of music on the MBA or MBP, so we can take it with us any where, and keep all the PodCast videos, movies purchased on iTunes, iTunes U videos on the external drive, so when we are home and plug in the external hard drive, we can change the path back for the videos.\n(This is not so convenient, as we need to change the path for music and then for videos, but at least it may be a workable solution.  My library is about 550GB on iMac so I am afraid it may mess things up if I change it to the external drive and change it back and all the references to songs and videos, and the indexing for search are gone).\n(what if we create a \"symbolic link\" from /Users/mike/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/iTunes U to /My Passport/iTunes Media/iTunes U and the same for Movies and Podcasts as well, and copy all those files over?  Then when the drive is plugged in, things should work, but if we unplug the drive and take the MBA or MBP to a coffee shop, will iTunes act weird or lose the references or index to those missing videos?)\n\nA: Hold the Option Key (alt) and then open iTunes and it will ask which iTunes library you would like to use.\n\nI use one as my main library and another on a NAS as an archive for stuff I hardly ever listen to but can't bring myself to delete.\n", "Q: Is Time machine able to restore my Windows Partition? I have 2 partitions on my computer. One with mac os x, another for Windows XP. I want to replace the disk with another one and I  wanted to know if Time  Machine will be able to restore the Windows partition too? \n\nA: Winclone 3 is the best way to backup/restore a Windows Boot Camp partition. I have used it numerous times to restore such a partition.\nhttp://twocanoes.com/software.php?software=1\n\nA: No Time Machine does not restore whole partitions: it backs up files and directories on mounted drives and restores files and directories.\nUntested\nYou can create an image of the Windows partition with DiskUtility, backup the image (copy it on a different disk) and restore it later.\n", "Q: Can I play Assasin's Creed II on my Macbook Pro? I have a Macbook Pro 13\" and pretty much all the requirements asked on the Mac App Store are met in order to play AC2.\nIt says at the top of the page though, \n\nThis app is not compatible with Macbook Air and Macbook Pro 13\"\n\nWill it still work?\n\nA: You should check your graphics card... The minimum AC2 requires is\n\nNvidia geforce GT 8800 or ATI radeon 4850 or better\n\nI wouldn't buy it if I were you, chances are you will have the play the game with a huge lack or not at all as some users seems to complain about...  \nSome people share my opinion in not buying the game...\n\nIf Assassins Creed 1 runs anything like 2, I wouldn't recommend anyone\n  buy it for the 2010 13\" MBP.\nIt runs ok (its playable), not anything like the ps3 or xbox 360 which\n  pretty much ruins the experience.\n\nBut if you lower the graphic performance on the game, maybe your 13\" will play the game just fine.\n", "Q: Nvidia MCP79 SATA controller caps link speed Why is my SATA controller capping the link speed? This is what it says in my System Profiler under the Serial-ATA page:\nVendor:                 NVidia\nProduct:                MCP79 AHCI\nLink Speed:             3 Gigabit\nNegotiated Link Speed:  1.5 Gigabit\nDescription:            AHCI Version 1.20 Supported\n\nThe link speed is as expected (3 Gigabit), but I don't see why it is negotiated into a 1.5 Gigabit link speed.\nThe drives attached to the SATA interface are a Hitachi 320GB 5400rpm hard disk drive and a MATSHITADVD-R UJ-868 superdrive.  \nI have a MacBook Pro 5,3 with Snow Leopard 10.6.8. My question is why the negotiated link speed is lower than the actual link speed.\n\nA: Because devices connected are SATAI devices. How can you connect to a device at 3Gbps if it doesn't support it?\n", "Q: How can I upload high-res photos to Facebook from my iPad I've bought the New iPad and have been using iPhoto to upload my pictures to Facebook. However, when I view them the quality doesn't look good. When browsed from the desktop Facebook site, the site does not provide a high quality version to download either.\nHow can I upload high quality images to Facebook from my iPad?\n\nA: Probably the best way is to do it through Safari. As far as I know Safari doesn't change the size or quality of uploaded images.\nKeep in mind that max size in pixels of an image on Facebook currently is limited to 2048x2048px. If you try to upload a bigger image Facebook will resize and reencode it automatically and the result will not be optimal.\n\nA: I uploaded a photo through Facebook, but it had bad quality, so I tried uploading it with iPhoto, and it did it with the highest quality. I also compared a the quality difference between uploading it with the FaceBook app and the iPad version of iPhoto and it too looked better!\n\nA: I think that iPhoto would not give you a choice of photo resolution. Just upload the photos through the Facebook app for iPad.\n\nA: Here is official Facebook answer to your question: https://www.facebook.com/help/266520536764594\nYou may also consider this option while creating FB album:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/help/187741037945488\nAlso, if you use Facebook iPad App to upload photos, make sure you have 'Upload HD' option turned on in Facebook iPad App -> Menu (upper left corner) -> Settings -> Videos and Photos -> Upload HD.\nYou may use any application on iPad (for instance, Snapseed, which is good), however all of them will meet same limitations caused by Facebook policies mentioned above.\n\nA: Have you tried using the official Facebook app?\nhttp://www.facebook.com/mobile/ipad\nThis allows you to upload pictures directly from your iPad photo library and providing those are of sufficient quality you should be ok.\n\nA: The Facebook Camera app will allow you to upload photos in higher resolution. Most other apps (incl. the offical facebook app) will convert the photo to low res before uploading.\n", "Q: Enable All HiDPI Modes I want to know how to enable all HiDPI modes, particularly the 1280x800 mode for my 1440x900 MacBook Air. How can I do this?\n\nA: Yes, this is possible:\nReference\nFirst you need to get SwitchResX.\nAfter installation, you then click System Preferences > Other > SwitchResX > select your Mac / Monitor from the right column -> Custom Resolution > and click + button to add a new resolution.\nNow you need to select \"Scaled resolution\" inside the select option field & enter the resolution inside the scaled to Text field. So lets say if you want a 1920 x 1080 Hidpi setting, you need to create a custom 3840 x 2160 etc.\nAfter all, just click save and then restart it, once you restart your mac, you should be able to see the new hidpi setting under display setting.\n\nA: The answer is that it is not possible, when the  13\" MacBook Air's higest native resolution is 1440x900. It simply does not support 1280x800 or 1440x900 HiDPI modes, since it does not have a retina display or a display with enough pixels to do HiDPI. For the MacBook Air in its current form, it would need to have a LCD display with at least 2880 X 1800 pixels to enable HiDPI modes.\nTo do HiDPI 1280 x 800 you would need a display with resolution of at least 2560 x 1600, again, not possible on the 13\" MacBook Air's display.\nAs noted in Signs in Mountain Lion point to \"retina\" display MacBooks sooner than later retina displays and graphics require 2x the resolution of normal graphics and displays. \n\nA: You can add HIDPI on any Display Monitor with or without retina using Quartz Debug: http://www.osx86.net/view/2224-quartz_debug.html (It's official, extracted from Apple's Xcode).\nThe problem is that it will only enable half native resolution for HiDPI.\nFor instance: my MacBook Air is 1440x900; with this tweak, I could pick 720x450 (Native Resolution / 2).\nThe hidpi on OS X is only for 200% increased size, not just a 110%-150% to fit a resolution near your native resolution (like 1280x800, etc.). \n\nA: It took me a while to figure it out but you need to do two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get Quartz Debug and enable HiDPI mode\n\n*Get SwitchResX and then you will see the HiDPI resolution\n\n\nIn my case, an 11\" MacBook Air, the only HiDPI resolution I get is 640x400, which is the highest resolution you can get on the 11\" MacBook Air (1280x800) divided by 2 in each dimension. With a 1920x1080 external monitor, I could get 960x540 on that in HiDPI mode.\nThe end result is a bit small resolution for certain applications like iTunes, but otherwise looks fantastic with fonts just the right size.\n", "Q: What is the equivalent terminal command to findsmb on Lion The findsmb command present in SnowLeopard and older, is not available from terminal in Lion.

Accessing it via the blogspot.com domain made the error go away.\n", "Q: Why does Apple Activity Monitor report that my Mac with a dual-core Intel i5 Ivy Bridge CPU has 4 cores? I just got a new Apple MacBook Pro 13\", mid-2012, which has a dual-core Intel i5 Ivy Bridge CPU. When I run Activity Monitor and turn on the Floating CPU Window, it shows a 4-bar graph (indicating 4 cores).\nOn my older MacBook Pro with an Intel Core 2 Duo dual-core processor, Activity Monitor only showed a 2-bar graph (indicating 2 cores).\nWhy does Activity Monitor seem to indicate that my Mac has 4 cores, when clearly it does not?\n\nA: This is a technology called Hyperthreading those i5 chips support.\nIt means two threads can run simultaneously on each core resulting in two additional virtual cores. OS X's Activity Monitor only shows virtual cores, not physical cores. Likewise, a quad-core chip has eight virtual cores and that's what's presented in Activity Monitor.\nTo sum it up:\n\n\n*\n\n*1 CPU\n\n*2 physical cores\n\n*4 virtual cores (2 per physical core)\n\n", "Q: Is there any way to search for text in the *body* of a message in Sparrow on the iPhone? Sparrow for iPhone seems to only search the same fields that the Mail app does: from, to, subject, or all of them.\nGiven that gmail (sparrow's data source) and the sparrow Mac app both allow full text searches, and presumably the \"work\" is done on the gmail server side, it seems odd that you can't search the body of messages.\nAm I missing something?   If not, does anyone know if this might be planned for a future release?\n\nA: From my experience, and at least with Sparrow for iPhone 1.3.2 build 507.11, All does not refer to FROM+TO+SUBJECT, but all available fields, including the email body.\n", "Q: Unbrick iPhone 3GS? I have an iPhone 3GS running iOS 5 and baseband 5.16. After reading various blog posts and threads, I was told that in order to unlock it, I had to first upgrade it to the iPad baseband (6.15) and then downgrade it. Well, when I tried upgrading to 6.15, it took me halfway through the process and then said I had to first activate the iPhone. Not having a SIM card yet, I couldn't proceed. Now, WiFi doesn't work, Bluetooth doesn't work, calls, tons of things. The modem firmware is blank. The top left of the screen just says \"Searching\", and iTunes won't even recognize it. I think it may be bricked. Any suggestions?\n\nA: Could it be that your iPhone 3GS was not compatible with the iPad baseband ?\n\nThe iPad baseband is not compatible with 3GS units manufactured week 34 of 2011 or later.  If you have an iPhone3GS and if digits 3-5 of its Serial Number are 134 or later (xx134…), then you should NOT try to install the 06.15 baseband on your 3GS!  It will brick your radio, preventing both the downgrade from working and normal iPhone software from using it as a phone!  Be warned!\n\nSee this post on the iPhone Dev Team blog.\n", "Q: Time Machine on Time Capsule backup verification never seems to complete I have a MacPro running Mac OS X 10.7.4 with a Time Capsule connected by Ethernet.  When Time Machine runs a verify of the backups it seems to stall at 72%, and if I let it run a LONG time I think I have seen it jump up to something like 92% done.  But I am not at all sure I have seen it actually complete the verify (I typically end up doing Skip Verification.)  Right now I have a verify running that has been stuck at 72% for maybe an hour, and I have waited 12 hours and a good bit more without getting to completion.\nGranted there a pretty good number of files and folders, and the backups go back over a year and half - Time Machine prefs shows 193 GB out of 998 GB available on the Time Capsule  \nMy question is if I just don't have sufficient patience, or if there is a problem.  If there is a problem how do I attack it?\n\nA: Since the verification process is akin to running fsck the filesystem check utility, this is the thing that will repair the backup or pronounce it dead.\nIf it fails too many times, you will then be left with a read-only Time Machine directory that you could clone somewhere else, restore the files you care, or wipe and start over.\nSadly, you are seeing all the progress that is normally available without running the tmdiagnose tool to collect detailed status and log when you ask Apple or a technician to help with time machine problems.\nIn most cases, I would say pick a time you can afford to be without backups (a day, a long weekend, a week) and set the Mac to not sleep and let it chug and see if it finishes. At the end of the period, you can decide to clone off the data to an attached USB drive just in case you need to retrieve something or just wipe the disk and start over.\nHave you rebooted your Mac and run a filesystem check (or safe boot) to make sure your Mac doesn't have any directory damage?\n\nA: There is possibly another way to handle this (had the same problem the other day on a system running Yosemite: go into System Preferences > Energy Saver, and set the sleep time to 3 hours or longer. Once I did this, the verification ran all the way through successfully.\nPer a user on another thread (lost the link), it can sometimes be due to cross-linked files in the volume.\nAt first, I had assumed the worst, but after this one change, all appears OK on my system now.\n", "Q: Is it better to use AirPlay to push from Mac to AppleTV, or use AppleTV to pull from a Mac? If we have an iMac and an AppleTV, is it better to use the AppleTV to pull content from the Mac to play it, or is it better to start from the Mac and use AirPlay to push to the AppleTV?\n\nA: There's no difference in quality, so it's purely a personal choice and depends on how your home network and systems are set-up.\nI have a Windows PC running iTunes 24/7 and that has my entire library of music and video on it, so the Apple TV can pull whatever I want from it.\nSometimes I'll play content such as BBC iPlayer or Youtube videos from my phone, or from my laptop if I've downloaded a video I want to watch without importing it on the other system but it really makes no difference. It's just about convenience really.\nThe only thing that really makes a difference is network connection for the caching, wired ethernet is obviously a lot faster than WiFi.\n\nA: For many things, it doesn't matter but AirPlay only does 2 audio handles while the ATV can do multi-channel audio so it can play a 5.1 soundtrack when streaming iTunes. I encode my TV shows with both stereo and 5.1 soundtracks and the audio difference is obvious when I use AirPlay.\n\nA: In my system, pushing from Mac works more reliably.  Pulling from ATV sometimes gets drop-outs, but pushing from Mac is nearly flawless.  For this setup (push from Mac):\nDownside: you can't listen to iTunes on your Mac and push different iTunes content to the ATV.\nUpside: you can blast the music to your Mac speakers and the ATV at the same time, and walk around your house and hear the same music in different rooms (if they are in different rooms).\n\nA: When I play music using the ATV interface, the sound quality is horrible.\nWhen I hit play in iTunes and route to ATV, it sounds fine.\nI've done a blinded test on this, and it is horribly obvious.\nI'm not going to downvote the answer that says there's no difference, since it might have something to do with which version of the ATV I have. But on my setup, there is definitely a difference.\nNote: This is for streaming music from my iTunes library to the ATV. Much of my music is not on iTunes Match.\n", "Q: Is it possible to use mac trackpad gestures on, say, a linux virtualbox machine? Specifically, I would just love to use the trackpad to do \"three finger swipes\" and switch between Linux workspaces (desktops), that would be extremely slick.\nI imagine this might require a plugin or some such thing, in addition to the disabling of the underlying Mac OS's responding to the gestures, which is what it currently does.\n\nA: Using BetterTouchTool on the Mac host machine,use a application specific rule for the VirtualBox VM to map the swipe gesture to keyboard shortcuts to change desktops. To tie the rule to the VM and not the prefs app, issue ln -s /Applications/VirtualBox.app/Contents/Resources/VirtualBoxVM.app ~/Desktop/VBVM.app, to create an alias to the VM's app bundle on the desktop. Next, make the rule and set the app as the alias on the desktop. Finally delete the alias on the desktop and try it out.\n", "Q: Getting a list of currently running processes I'd like to get a list of all the applications currently running on my machine using the command line. It should be similar to what you get when you open up Activity Monitor and choose to save the list.\nI noticed that the ps -a command does something similar, but it cuts off the names of the processes.\nI'm only interested in the name of the processes, so I don't need all the columns that Activity Monitor outputs.\nUpdate: I should have been more clear... I don't want the entire path to the process to be displayed. I just want the name of the process, as it appears in Activity Monitor. For example, ps causes lanchd to be displayed as /sbin/launchd rather than as it is displayed in Activity Monitor (i.e. just lanchd). This is a problem because processes that have very long paths end up being truncated (depending on my terminal window's size), and I can't even see the process name.\n\nA: ps -axc -o comm\n\n\n\n*\n\n*-a displays processes from all users (or root)\n\n*-x includes processes that don't have a controlling terminal\n\n*-o comm outputs command paths or names\n\n*-c makes -o comm output names only\n\n\ntell app \"System Events\" to name of application processes would list only processes launched from an application bundle.\n\nA: Right command, wrong flags.\n\n\n*\n\n*Use ps -Ao comm if you want process names only.\n\n*Use ps -Ao command if you want process names with arguments.\n\n\nA: You mentioned that you'd like to save it to a file.  In the simplest case (the one that you are most concerned about), use\nps ax > /path/to/outfile.txt\n\nwhich will print a list of all running processes (with the full name) to the file designated by the path. The \">\" redirects the printed output (in overwrite mode) to the file.  Simply issuing ps ax will print it to the screen. \nHint: If you don't feel like typing out a full directory, drag a folder to the terminal to get the path for you and manually complete with the name of the file\nIn case you end up wanted some of the other columns at some point... Also, check the man page for ps by typing man ps at the command line and look at other options. Here's another example which prints the cpu-usage and memory for each process (in percentages) followed by the command (process):\nps ax -o %cpu -o %mem -o command > /path/to/outfile.txt\n\nUse \n# Sort by cpu usage with the 'r' option\nps arx -o %cpu -o %mem -o command > /path/to/outfile.txt\n\n# Sort by memory usage with the 'm' option\nps arm -o %cpu -o %mem -o command > /path/to/outfile.txt\n\nEDIT\nIn order to print just the command, there are probably more durable approaches, but in a pinch I'd just do what follows. You'll probably notice a bit of cruft near the end related to strings that weren't meant for basename (like -bash), but the rest of what you want will be there with this quickie. \nps ax -o comm | xargs -I % basename % > /path/to/outfile.txt\n\nNOTE: Some processes that are running are not necessarily executable names.  They could be a straight call to sh with a string of commands that follow.  \n", "Q: My AirPort Extreme Base Station will not power on. No lights appear. I have tried all the recommended resets. I have ensured that the electrical outlet is working properly. I have tried both of various factory resets (soft, hard). No lights. Nothing. Time to hit the Apple Store?\n\nA: Yes. Unless you can test connectivity of the LAN ports to see that it's powering up, but it's not much use if it doesn't boot or let you hook up an ethernet cable and re-configure it.\n", "Q: Show sent emails in my inbox on iPad Is there a way to make my sent emails show up in my inbox on the iPad, similar to how it is shown in the gmail web view?  I can do this in the Mac app by creating a smart mailbox that includes both inbox and sent messages. Is there something I can set up, either on the iPad or in gmail, that would let me do this?\n\nA: You could always simply view the \"Gmail/All Mail\" folder.\nInside Mail on your iPad, go to Mailboxes-> Gmail (under accounts) -> All Mail.\nYou'll see messages you've sent as well.  If Gmail is your only mail account, simply stay in the All Mail folder all the time.  \n\nA: Go to Settings>Mail, Contacts, Calendars and turn on \"Always BCC Myself\".

I got my retina Macbook Pro this week and have been waiting for my Thunderbolt to DVI adapters to get here so I can hook them up to my external displays. In the meantime, I am using an HDMI to DVI cable to hook up to my monitor.\nI've noticed every once in a while, the monitor I am using will sometimes go blank for a second and then back. It doesn't happen very often, but I'm not sure if this has to do with the cable, monitor, or my retina Macbook Pro.\nI've tried multiple cables, and have been using this monitor previously to the retina Macbook Pro, so I don't think the monitor is the issue.\nDo you think this is an issue with the laptop? Something graphics card related? I can't seem to figure out why this randomly happens.\nI was able to catch this happening on video...\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vGeDR48E8w\n\nA: Try disabling Automatic Graphics Switching in the System Preferences-Energy Saver.  This may be working for me, though I haven't figured out how to reproduce the 1-2 second blanking, so only time will tell.  \nI'm running 10.8.2 on a new rMBP and have the same issue - The external display goes blank for 1-2 seconds when connected to a 1680 x 1050 display via the HDMI connector and the rMBP is closed and in a stand. There is no movement of the rMBP, the HDMI cable or monitor when this happens.\nI have not experienced the same momentary blanking of the rMBP's display when using only the native display.\nIt doesn't happen often (2-3 times per day) so it's more of an irritation that I don't expect from a nearly $3,000 piece of hardware.\n\nA: Here's the connection from MBP to monitor:\nMBP - Adapter - Cable - Monitor\nLet's assume MBP has no problem, and you've ruled out your cable since you've tested many , also the monitor should is fine as it's working fine. That leaves the adapter.\nAnd I've had experiences with a few bad adapters, and that has happened to me.\nI am not completely sure if it's the problem, but I will start there. Since Retina MBP and MBP use the same graphics, so I don't think MBP is the problem.\nGood Luck\n\nA: This is a known issue with OSX and the Retina MacBook Pro. Apple are currently working on a fix.

But i couldn't find anything for making a shared folder on a MAC OS X client. Can you guys help me with this?\n\nA: Take a look at this article by Mike Barron, NetBoot Part 4.\nIn the article Mike walks through the dscl commands he used to share folders on Mac OS X for the Apple Filing Protocol (AFP) and Server Message Block (SMB) protocols:\n\nThe toughest one so far has been file sharing. In our lab we share all our Work partitions to the entire internal network over AFP and SMB. In the past we used SharePoints to modify the NetInfo database to do so, but this functionality has all been moved over to Directory Services. To complicate matters, SAMBA no longer relies simply on standard SMB configuration files in standard locations, and the starting and stopping of the SMB daemon is handled completely by launchd.

The link speed of the hard disk drive is negotiated to 1.5 Gbps as, according to this answer the device is a SATA I (1.5Gbps) device.\nThis is what my system profiler says about the SATA controller:\nVendor:                 NVidia\nProduct:                MCP79 AHCI\nLink Speed:             3 Gigabit\nNegotiated Link Speed:  1.5 Gigabit\nDescription:            AHCI Version 1.20 Supported\n\nNow I'm wondering the following:\nIf I would replace the Hitachi HDD with an SSD of any brand will the negotiated link speed be 3Gbps? The SSD being a SATA II or III device. Or will this be capped because it has to divide the 3Gbps over the HDD/SSD and the Superdrive?\n\nA: There are two independent SATA channels available. Each channel will negotiate highest possible speed based on client capabilities. It will not divide 3Gbps between two clients.\nAnd as a side answer to your question: in case you don't use Superdrive look for SATA to SATA 9.5mm optical bay caddy. This way you'll be able to put SSD in place of Superdrive and have plenty of storage on platters.\nYour Macbook even accept 12.5mm thick HDDs in HDD chamber.\n\nA: I've replaced the Hitachi 320GB 5400rpm with a Seagate Momentus XT hybrid drive (4GB SSD + 500 GB HDD) and this is what it now says in my system profiler.\nVendor:                 NVidia\nProduct:                MCP79 AHCI   \nLink Speed:             3 Gigabit   \nNegotiated Link Speed:  3 Gigabit   \nDescription:            AHCI Version 1.20 Supported \n\nSo this confirms what iskra is saying\n", "Q: Is there any way to view saved wifi passwords on the iPhone? I've previously connected to a wifi network on my iPhone but I've no way of finding out the password. So is there any way to view saved wifi passwords on the iPhone?\n\nA: As of iOS 11 devices will offer to share the password to nearby devices when they try to connect to the same WiFi SSID as it has joined, but not show a plaintext password.\n\n\nA: as answered by stuffe, one of the possibilities is to use keychain syncing. \nthere are 2 requirements\n\n\n*\n\n*phone must have the wifi password already\n\n*computer must be able to access the internet\n\n\nif your iPhone is able to use \"personal hotspot\", then you can do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*turn on personal hotspot\n\n*connect computer to personal hotspot - this will initiate the keychain sync, which will then populate the key/password in the app\n\n*turn off personal hotspot\n\n*connect to the wifi with the new populated key/password \n\n\nA: *\n\n*If you have a Mac connected to the same network, you can find the stored password in it's Keychain using the Keychain Access app\n\n\n*If the router is an Apple Airport based device, you may be able to log straight into it via Airport Utility (available on Mac and iOS) to see the password at source\n\n\n*If you are on iOS7, then you can use iCloud Keychain Syncing to allow the stored password on your iPad to be synced elsewhere (assuming you have a Mac too), allowing you to then read it in your Keychain as per point 1.  In the screenshot shown, most of these  WiFi networks are in other cities that only my iPhone has connected to:\n\n\nA: Unfortunately, on the iPhone it is not possible to access this information.  The passwords are kept on your phone in a safe place that is not accessible through any regular means on the phone.  This is done for your protection, if you were to lose your iPhone and someone picked it up, the passwords that are stored on it would be up for grabs.  This would lead to a lot of security problems.  \nI would recommend apps like 1password or the many other pieces of software out there that do the same thing to keep your passwords safe and backed up. I have way to many passwords to remember and it has been a life saver.  1Password even has the ability to back up your passwords to dropbox just in case something happens to your phone and you need to access it from somewhere else.\nThere are a lot of different password managing apps out there, just find the right one for you.  \nAs gtm above me stated, there is a way to access your passwords but it is through jailbreaking. I do not recommend jailbreaking, that is something that you have to make the decision on for yourself. Jailbreaking is not for everyone.\nI know this may not have been the answer you were looking for, we have all been there when we forget a password and there isn't a way to retrieve it.  The easier thing you can do is just reset the password on your router and make sure to keep that password safe.\nI hope this answer helps somewhat.\n\nA: Yes on iOS 16 this is added to see and copy the password.\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings > Wi-Fi\n\n*Tap your network\n\n*Tap the password field and copy the text or observe it in clear text\n\nNo on iOS 15 and older, you need to use iCloud Keychain to sync it and look it up from a Mac.\n\nA: If you have a jailbroken iPhone, check out Wifi Passwords on Cydia.\n\nA: Using the Keychain app is a great way to organize your passwords. With Keychain you can access all passwords (including Wi-Fi passwords) from your Mac. But the Jailbreak tweak WiFi Passwords from Cydia is the best one for viewing passwords directly on your iPhone.\nYou just need to open the App and you can see all wifi passwords that are stored in your iPhone. Then you can share the passwords with your friends in public places. That's cool app.\nCredits: http://www.unlockboot.com/2016/02/how-to-view-saved-wifi-passwords-on.html\n\nA: I didn't try this, but it may work: if you have a Mac and sync it to the Apple ID in the iPhone then it may appear in Keychain Access > passwords in the Mac as \"Airport Network password\" (just search for \"airport\") or by searching for the WIFI network name.  \n", "Q: Using iTunes match on a computer that has two libraries I was thinking of subscribing to iTunes Match. I share my computer with my sister who also has a iTunes library. She has no interest in iTunes match what so ever but I don't want her songs in my cloud. Can I:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a separate library under the same user account (on the actual computer) and only match one library leaving the other one unaffected?\n\n*Make another account on the computer, having the two libraries under different accounts, and only matching one library leaving the other one unaffected?\n\n\nSee what I want to do? I don't want my sister's library to be affected by the fact that mine is being matched. Anybody have any experience in this or have any thoughts?\n\nA: In general it's recommended to have one computer account per user (in your case one for your sister and one for yourself), each with its own settings, home folder, iTunes library etc. This also takes care of separating mail, calendars, iTunes Match settings etc. without having to go through a lot of loops. \nIn addition you need a separate AppleID for each user (especially if both want to use iTunes Match independently).\n", "Q: Mobile Safari Browser and HTML5 I'm clicking through the internet and start being confused a little bit about if the mobile Safari Brwoser is HTML5-capable now or not. I wanted to open the webqr-Site on my safari Browser on iPod Touch 3rd Gen with the newest iOS and they say, I have to open this site with a browser being capable of HTML5. But actually the mobile safari browser should support HTML5, (Link1, Link2). I'm not into HTML5, that's why I get confused. Does that mean, that the mobile Safari browser started being compatible to some Tags of HTML5, but still not supports the whole functionality? Is there any reliable source for that? I need this information for my thesis. \n\nA: Mobile Safari is HTML5 capable since v1.0, so since 2007. The exact implementation details for various specs changed over time obviously.\nAt the moment there is no browser on the planet supporting everything mentioned in the HTML5 spec. That's because it's a working draft, not a finalized specification.\nThere're a lot of components forming what we call HTML5 and the site you're mentioning needs a specific feature which Mobile Safari doesn't support. So the error message is a bit misleading and user unfriendly.

I am going to buy the high end MacBook Pro mid 2012. I want to get an SSD, but the BTO options given by Apple are too pricey in my opinion.\nWhich third party SSD (512 GB) are recommended (for performances and prices)?\nEdit: at a local shop they told me that changing the drive of an Apple product invalidates warranty. Do you know if it's true?\n\nA: Your warranty won't be invalidated although Apple can refuse to work on it until you reinstall the original drive (so put it away on a shelf).  A local shop might be more flexible. Or not.  \n\nA: I recently abandoned mechanical drives after 2 mechanical drive failures that were too close for comfort.  I went with the Crucial M4 series because:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have never had any trouble with Crucial products (can't say the same for others)\n\n*Mac forum searches turned up many success stories where MBP owners installed a Crucial M4 SSD.\n\n\nI'm completely satisfied with the drive after 1 month of use and highly recommend it. Watch the prices.  They are currently on a downtrend in price.  My drive is now 10% cheaper than when I purchased it. \n\nA: I bought and installed an OWC SSD in an older MBP a few years ago and it was fast, reliable, and never caused any problems.\nhttp://eshop.macsales.com/shop/SSD/OWC/\nThey have a decent warranty and stand behind their products.\n\nA: What you've asked is very difficult to sufficiently answer without a specific price range and more specific performance expectations (what you use your computer for, etc) This is probably not what you want to hear, but you're going to have to do some research to find your own ideal price to performance ratio. Check out Storage Review as a good place to start and Tom's Hardware is another good resource to determine what to buy. Each site has reviews and benchmarks on specific SSD models.\nBoth Crucial and OWC are great recommendations for notebook SSDs, but there are also other great brands such as Samsung, Kingston, Corsair, Intel, and more. In my own research Samsung 830, 840, & 840 Pro series seem to be a top choice for notebooks due to their lower power demands while also providing good speeds, but they cost more. OCZ seems to have good performance, but also generally with higher power demands better suited to desktops. SanDisk Extreme SSDs also seem to be a good value, but you have to be careful as some models have had firmware issues.  But that is just scratching the surface...there is no easy answer.\nHowever if price isn't an issue for a 512GB: check this out.\n\nA: MBP 13in mid 2012 has lots of room for upgrades making it a relevant machine for 5+ years.  OWC computing has lots of information on SSD drives.  I would recommend looking into the best solution for transferring over your current HD contents to what would be your new SSD, as that seems to be the most \"complicated\" part of the process. \nMacbook Airs in general are non upgradeable.  You are locked into the machine for 2-3 years until the new ones make yours obsolete and you will have to buy new again.\n\nA: With the Macbook Air 13\" you get an SSD and a screen with an higher resolution for the same price.\nthe MBP has the same core features, only offers some more ports and a CD/DVD burner, if you don't need this features i higly suggest a MBA 13\".\nthe downside for the MBA is due to the fact that it gets hot under heavy load and the MBP has more room for the air and the cooling system.\n", "Q: Best file system for an external hard drive sharing between OS X and Windows I would like to buy an external hard drive that I'll use on Mac OS X and on Windows, but I don't know the best file system for it (reading and writing on the both system).\nI know I can used FAT32 easily, but I have files bigger than 4 GB so I can't use this file system.\nSo, I think for NTFS or HFS, but I know I can use on the two systems with software, but I don't know the fastest one to transfer files. Also, I don't know if I can use ext3 or ext4.\nIf someone knows one of the best way to use an external drive on Windows and Mac without used FAT32, please tell me.\n\nA: Which versions of OS X and Windows do you need it to work with?  If they're recent enough, ExFAT is probably the best answer.  Support for it was added to OS X sometime around 10.6.5 and AIUI it's built into Windows 7 and available via updates for everything since Windows XP.\nBTW, if you're formatting via the Partitions tab in OS X's Disk Utility, be sure to use Options button to select the MBR partition scheme.  If you use the Erase tab, just select the disk (not the volume listed under it) and it should automatically use MBR partitioning.\n\nA: In my opinion, NTFS is better than FAT for larger drives.\nI've had great success with NTFS-3g and NTFS partitions on more than 10 different external drives that I use rather frequently for a large amount of data.  NTFS-3g adds NTFS write support to MacOS. I've been using it since the beginning with no data problems--and I write (and delete) a lot of data for work on external drives from Mac OS and Win.    \nI only use FAT FS for thumb drives.  \n\nA: My solution to this is to partition a drive into two partitions: one for actual data formatted as exFAT and one small partition for variants of exFAT driver for WinXP, you may also add latest Vista SP if you wish) and latest 10.6.x combo update.\nAnd I format that small partition in NTFS under Windows so it will not become corrupted with improper eject like FAT32 usually do.\n", "Q: OSX program similar to 'Fences' Is there a Mac program resembling the Windows program 'Fences' (see screenshot below), which allows you to group icons on your screen?\n\n\nA: Desktop Groups (Which I would describe as the best alternative to fences) is made by the same people who make Desktop Shelves.

I got a new router that is ridiculously good and has exceptional range.  A side effect of this is when I go for a walk, I have to be walking for at least 5-6 minutes at a brisk pace, before the WiFi connection on my iPhone 4S is lost.  Basically, beyond 100 yards/meters there will be 1 WiFi bar and it will be all but unusable (e.g. Web Browser times out, Siri doesn't work, etc...).  Under these conditions, I'd rather use 3G (ahem, 4G).\nIs there a way to automatically disconnect from the WiFi when it gets down to 1 bar?\n\nA: There isn't a way to specify this in the current OS, but I've found when I am in the margins of coverage - flipping AirPlane mode on and then off will prevent re-joining the Wi-Fi. Basically, the OS is trying to maintain an existing connection for as long as possible to avoid inconveniencing people who have spotty coverage or temporary disruptions and for you it's not so good.\nWhen the signal is this low, the phone won't re-join until you get closer so you'll kick things to cellular data sooner than waiting to get out of range or it to eventually time out.\n", "Q: Default list of Quicklook Plugins for a fresh LION install? What QL plugins \"should be\" in /System/Library/Quicklook/? This is an easy one for you all. I simply need people to list what Quicklook plugins they have installed in /System/Library/QuickLook.\nI ask because I have a QL plugin named: Icon.qlgenerator in my system's quicklook folder and I do not think it should be there. Even a google search of \"Icon.qlgenerator\" turned up only a couple hits and they were no help.\nAll in all: I need members to 1) help me out and simply list which QL plugins they have in their system/library/quicklook folder (everyone should have the same.)\n2) If Icon.qlgenerator is not supposed to be there, does anyone have any idea where this could have come from? Did previous versions of OS X's /System/Library/QuickLook directory contain Icon.qlgenerator? \nMaybe I am freaking out and it should be there but if that was the case I think google would have found me some better info.

If it's not supposed to be there I will drop some more questions about determining what uses this ql plugin etc... \nFile in question: /System/Library/QuickLook - Modification date: 4/12/12, Creation date: 4/12/12, last used: 4/12/12... version 3.2\n\nA: I have Mac OS X Lion 10.7.4, and that file is present. The file is copyrighted by Apple (\"3.2, Copyright Apple Inc. 2007-2011\").\nLooking at the content of its info.plist file, I see that its purpose is generating a preview for files with a content type UTI equal to com.apple.iconset, which (as far as I remember) is the type of files containing a set of icons.\nThe computer I am using is a Mac Mini middle 2011. I don't actually remember if It came with Mac OS X 10.7 already installed, or it came with Mac OS X 10.6, and then I installed Mac OS X 10.7. I have also installed Xcode.\nProbably that can explain why some computers don't have that plugin, and some computers have it. It could also be the difference is caused from installed software, or an update of the operating system.\nI would not say the plugin should not be there. It is not a file created from malware, or viruses to cause any issue with your computer.\n\nA: I have a fresh Lion install and the only file in /System/Library/Quicklook is:\niWork.qlgenerator\n\nNote: I do not have iWork installed\nI have a MB running Snow Leopard and while it does have a number of files under the folder in question, Icon.qlgenerator is not one of them.\nThere is no harm in simply moving the file if it will put your mind at ease.  The most harm that moving it could do is give a blank preview when using quick look (or potentially CoverFlow).  \n", "Q: Applescript array of applications I have a script that reload the active tab of an open browser, but I want it to do with all opened browsers.

Also, will it void the warranty attached to the device?\n\nA: During the process of jail-breaking an iDevice, there can be complications.  It can sometimes render the device unusable or it can brick the device. \nThe device being unusable is usually fixable by simply putting the phone in DFU mode and restoring the software back onto the device.  This would cause your device to lose its information such as contacts, emails, photos, apps, app information.  This is usually recoverable because we usually have a back up.\nWhen a device is bricked, it will not function. Your iDevice will not turn on, as if the device has no battery at all or will just sit at the Apple Logo and keep restarting.  This is the worst case scenario.  Sometimes, a brick device can be restored.  This is very very rare occurrence though and never usually happens. \nIf my iDevice is not working, you take it to the Genius Bar.  Make an appointment and see a Genius.  Now, if you take a jailbroken iDevice to a Genius, they can not service them in their current condition.  \nExample: I have a battery issue where the battery only lasts half an hour, I take it to the Genius Bar and tell them that this is happening, I am under warranty.  They will look over your device and inspect it to see if something else could be causing the issue before replacement.  They see it is jailbroken.  Usually they will tell you that reason this could be happening is because it is jailbroken.  You did something to the iDevice that you \"weren't\" supposed to, so it is technically your fault.  Every time this happens though, they will tell you to just go home and restore it back to normal.  Removing the Jailbreak might fix the issue, if it doesn't, bring it back un-jailbroken and they will replace it.\nThis is just a small example of one of the things that would cause you to go to the Genius Bar to have service done.  But it shows that if your device can be looked through and they can tell it is jailbroken because they can see the software that is on it is obviously jailbroken, they can not act on their warranty until the jailbreak is removed.  \nThis being said, if your device is bricked or you device is at a point where your device can't be powered on or they can not turn it on to see it is jailbroken, then they will assume positive intent and replace it under warranty if it possible about 80% of the time. (Physically Damaged Items are Replaced for a Fee).  This is never a sure fire thing but just optimistic and don't say that you have ever jailbroken your device if they ask.\nSo, if you are going to try and jailbreak your iDevice, the best thing you can do is learn as much as possible about it before hand.  Know the risks that come with it.  Always have a back up of your information.  Don't update to the newest version of iOS if you are on an older version because it will remove the jailbreak.  And if you are having issues with your iDevice and it might need to be replaced, simply remove the jailbreak before hand, see if that fixes the issue, if not, then take it in.  As long as it is under warranty and it isn't jailbroken, you should be fine, or as long as they can't tell it is jailbroken (IE it won't boot and you obviously didn't smash it or disassemble it and it is totally obvious that you did)\nI hope that this helps clear some things up about jail-breaking and helps you out.\n\nA: it messed up my iphone's hardware, so i wouldnt recommend it unless you have warranty through apple, not your service provider. once you reset your phone, there will be no evidence of jailbreaking but if you take your phone to apple itll automatically be a hardware issue. be careful \n\nA: It can 'brick' your device leaving it useless.\nAnd your warranty is not valid while jailbroken.\n", "Q: Completely recover space from sparse bundle when \"hdiutil compact\" is not enough Current situation: I have a large sparse bundle image whose size is reported as 91GB (cmd+I from Finder).

I deleted a game from my iPad and was wondering if i could retrieve the data somehow, because the game was backed up on iCloud and when i reinstalled it all my data was gone. How do i retrieve the data specifically for this app from iCloud.\n\nA: According to the Apple Support topic on the subject, your only option is to restore your entire phone from a recent backup.  \nThe article does not explicitly report that there is not a way to selectively restore data, but it does explicitly state the way in which data is restored to a phone--all at once from a backup.  \n", "Q: Need AirPlay and a network drive - is having two devices my only option? I am replacing a PC in my house with a Macbook Air, and there are two primary functions that the Air won't replace:\n\n\n*\n\n*Streaming music to a whole-house audio system.\n\n*A home-base for my main photo/video/document hard drive.\n\n\nI'm interested in the AirPort Extreme for the network drive feature.  But, sadly, it doesn't have AirPlay and audio out like the AirPort Express does.  I can buy both... but I'd like to be able to take care of the two functions in one device.  Are there any other solutions that might work for this?\nI thought of buying an Apple TV instead of the Express — if I had to have two devices, am I missing anything by getting the TV instead of the Express? It seems like an obvious choice, so I feel like I must be missing something.\n\nA: I believe that most of the features offered by the Express would be redundant with the AirPort Extreme, so perhaps the Apple TV would be a more appealing option. Since the Apple TV is exclusively a media device, you gain a remote control and video streaming.  The Apple TV will only output audio over HDMI or Optical, so you would need to ensure that your current sound system is compatible. The AirPort Express outputs audio over standard 3.5 mm as well as 1/8\" TOSLINK optical.\nAn alternative would be to replace your current sound system's receiver with one that features AirPlay streaming: http://usa.denon.com/us/Airplayus/index.html\nThis would be significantly more expensive than an Apple TV or an Airport Express, but would cut down on the number of devices involved in your set up.\n\nA: For your usage, ATV is the way to go.  But, to answer your question, there are 2 other things you'd be \"missing\" with ATV:\n\n\n*\n\n*Wi-fi extension point (extend your Wi-fi further in your house)\n\n*Wi-fi-to-Ethernet converter (if you configure your Express as an Extension point (I forget the official term), the Ethernet jack allows you to plug in an Ethernet-only device into your network, like maybe a non-Wifi-enabled TV or BD player)\n\n\nI have both, and I recommend the ATV for your use.\n", "Q: Other than enabling Trim, is there anything else I should do with an SSD? I've installed a Samsung 830 series 256gb SSD into my early 2011 15\" MacBook Pro, and running 10.8 DP4, and 10.7.4 via a firewire 800 drive.\nI've used Trim enabler on both installs as it doesn't enable itself, and both installs seem OK. (I'd read about Trim Enabler causing problems in the early days, but can't find anything else to say it's likely to cause problems recently, feel free to correct me if I should do something different/better)\nI'm just wondering if there's anything else I should be aware of using an SSD on OSX?\n\nA: Yes and No. There's not a final answer on this. There are some basic things you don't want to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Never fill your drive, always try to have a minimum of a 20% of the drive free, SSD performance goes down fast when the drive is full or close to it.\n\n*Even with trim and whatever the OS does, at some point in 1, 2, 3, n years you might have to completely reformat/repartition the drive to gain some speed. This has been true on Windows Machines (I've seen it). My MacBook Air (1 year old) hasn't yet shown any signs of slowness. \n\n*SSDs have a limited number of writes before they wear out. At some point blocks just stop working, so if you are constantly writing/deleting files, you're essentially wearing out your SSD faster than the average (however this number is huge, say it can last 10++ years under normal usage). One is expected to change the drive by then :)\nI recommend you google around, there are multiple guides and advice pages. You will find this life hacker article relatively accurate and up-to-date.

I appreciate all the help!\n\nA: When your computer gets locked this way, you need to hold down the option key while booting in order to get access to your computer.  You will select the drive it is on and then enter a password to unlock it.\nIn the case where that doesn't allow you to fix the issue, you may have an issue with your hard drive. When the folder picture appears in the way it does it can mean that the computer can't find the OS to boot.\nThis can be because of a few things:\nIt can't find the drive with the OS to boot\n\n\n*\n\n*OS got corrupted\n\n*Part of the drive where the OS is stored has failed\n\n*The Hard Drive went bad or is failing\n\n*Worst case: The logic board is failing\nYou should have him hold down the option key while booting and see if it finds his hard drive, if it does, have him select it and see if it boots.  If that fixes it, great.\nI would still have him see a Genius so that they can check his drive to see if it is failing.  If he is under warranty and it is failing, they pop a new drive in for him for free as long as the computer isn't physically damaged.\nThis has happened to me, the option key thing while booting got me around it until I could get my drive replaced at the Apple Store.\nI hope this answer helps you out.\n", "Q: Is it possible to buy an iPhone from Apple without a plan?

My workflow involves a lot application windows, mostly terminals. With a very large dual screen setup, I find myself regularly looking for the currently active window. More than often I type in the wrong terminal, or even start typing in a browser window, because I thought the active window was somewhere else.\nI could not find a way to change window properties such as opacity and border / title bar colour. My title bars are either light grey (active) or very light grey (inactive). I am looking for hints on how to make it visually more prominent where the currently active window is.\n(Note: I am not looking for keyboard shortcuts or anything that requires interaction)\n\nA: There isn't a lot that's easily customizable about color schemes on OS X. One suggestion is that if you're using the Graphite color scheme, switch to the Blue color scheme. In earlier versions of OS X,there used to be quite a bit of difference between them, and many developers went with the more subdued Graphite scheme, but by Lion, one of the only surviving differences is the traffic-light dots in the upper left corner of a window. In the graphite color scheme, they're all grey, but in the \"blue\" scheme, they're colored when the window is the active one.\n\n\nA: Besides the brighter metal borders of inactive windows, the shadows are a good indicator to distinguish an active window from an inactive window.\nActive windows have a much more emphasized shadow.\nIn order to increase the visual impact I recommend to use a bright, monocolor background. This will create a maximum contrast in the shadow area.\n\n", "Q: How to create OS X Server Admin firewall rules using ip address groups by command line? The (Lion) Server Admin.app has a nice ability to apply firewall rules to ip address groups without having to edit ipfw config files.\nBut having to enter large and long lists of IP addresses using the Server Admin GUI is a tedious task.\nTherefore I am wondering how can a firewall IP address group be made from the command line?\nI know there is a /usr/sbin/serveradmin which has the ability to output settings, like using $ sudo serveradmin settings ipfilter:ipAddressGroupsWithRules:_array_id:10-net:* which outputs:\nipfilter:ipAddressGroupsWithRules:_array_id:10-net:rules = _empty_array\nipfilter:ipAddressGroupsWithRules:_array_id:10-net:readOnly = no\nipfilter:ipAddressGroupsWithRules:_array_id:10-net:allowAll = no\nipfilter:ipAddressGroupsWithRules:_array_id:10-net:addresses:_array_index:0 = \"10.0.0.0/8\"\nipfilter:ipAddressGroupsWithRules:_array_id:10-net:name = \"10-net\"\n\nWhich one can dump to a file using $ sudo serveradmin settings ipfilter:ipAddressGroupsWithRules:_array_id:10-net:* > 10-net.txt. But then editing that file to rename it to a new group, like:\nipfilter:ipAddressGroupsWithRules:_array_id:11-net:rules = _empty_array\nipfilter:ipAddressGroupsWithRules:_array_id:11-net:readOnly = no\nipfilter:ipAddressGroupsWithRules:_array_id:11-net:allowAll = no\nipfilter:ipAddressGroupsWithRules:_array_id:11-net:addresses:_array_index:0 = \"11.0.0.0/8\"\nipfilter:ipAddressGroupsWithRules:_array_id:11-net:name = \"11-net\"\n\nand loading that into serveradmin using $ sudo serveradmin settings < 10-net.txt doesn't create a new \"ipAddressGroupsWithRules\" rule in ipfilter. As verified using $ sudo serveradmin settings ipfilter:ipAddressGroupsWithRules:_array_id:11-net:*.\nWhat am I doing wrong?\n\nA: After 12 hours of searching and and not finding any example for ipfilter:ipAddressGroupsWithRules this https://help.apple.com/advancedserveradmin/mac/10.7/#apdA0111C46-F018-4C2C-B8D1-EDAEF73AC27E brought a helpful insight.\nThe only thing that need to be changed to create a new rule, and not update an existing one, is a first line that creates the rule. For example:\nipfilter:ipAddressGroupsWithRules:_array_id:11-net = create\nipfilter:ipAddressGroupsWithRules:_array_id:11-net:readOnly = no\nipfilter:ipAddressGroupsWithRules:_array_id:11-net:allowAll = no\nipfilter:ipAddressGroupsWithRules:_array_id:11-net:addresses:_array_index:0 = \"11.0.0.0/8\"\nipfilter:ipAddressGroupsWithRules:_array_id:11-net:name = \"11-net\"\n\nNow the output of $ sudo serveradmin settings < 10-net.txt is no longer:\nipfilter:ipAddressGroupsWithRules = _empty_array\n\nbut:\nipfilter:ipAddressGroupsWithRules:_array_id:11-net:readOnly = no\nipfilter:ipAddressGroupsWithRules:_array_id:11-net:allowAll = no\nipfilter:ipAddressGroupsWithRules:_array_id:11-net:addresses:_array_index:0 = \"11.0.0.0/8\"\nipfilter:ipAddressGroupsWithRules:_array_id:11-net:rules = _empty_array\nipfilter:ipAddressGroupsWithRules:_array_id:11-net:name = \"11-net\"\n\nWhich is the synonym for that entering the new setting succeeded.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro Battery Life Problems - only 2 hours with light usage At some point in the past 2 weeks, my MacBook Pro (13\", early 2011) began running hot and getting poor battery life.  The battery life used to last 4-5 hours even when I was using it regularly.  Now, it will die within 2 hours of idling.\nWhen I say 'running hot' - I have noticed it on my lap and the fan comes on more often.\nI have been checking Activity Monitor, but I cannot find a particular culprit.

I've also calibrated my battery according to these instructions\nHow do I begin to troubleshoot this problem?\nUPDATE:\nFound a culprit.  I haven't tested yet, so I'm not sure if this is THE culprit, or even if I've completely kicked it...\nWith some extensive googling, I found a bunch of users have issues with Adobe Version Cue CS3 or CS4.  I had CS3.  I made the HUGE mistake of uninstalling it manually (dragging system prefs to the trash).  This caused CrashReporter to run at > 100% CPU constantly and caused Console to light up with Bus Errors.\nHowever, by right clicking the prefs pane and disabling it, I was able to get \"launchd\" down from 7-8% to 1-2%.\nI'll update as I learn more.\n\nA: I found the problem, so I thought I'd update here in case anyone else has this issue.\nI'm running a 13\", MBP with OS X 10.6.8.  This problem will not present itself for previous versions of OS X but will likely appear in later versions.\nA few weeks ago I installed some Adobe CS3 software - particularly the Design Suite, although I had later versions of photoshop and dreamweaver already installed.  As part of the CS3 suite, I installed Adobe Version Cue CS3.  This software does NOT play nice with OS X.\nAt first, I tried manually removing it (easier for most uninstalls in my opinion).  This was a big mistake.  When I deleted the preference files, my CPU began running at over 100% for \"CrashReport\".  This didn't stop until I restored via Time Machine (thank God for Time Machine!)\nSecondly, I disabled it, which did lower launchd and others by 5% or so, but did not ultimately result in my machine running cooler, or my battery lasting longer.\nNote: my fans would come on full speed even while the computer was idling!\nFinally, I ran the complete Adobe uninstaller for CS3 suite which cleaned up my problem completely.  Turns out Adobe CS3 is Unsupported for Snow Leopard although quietly.  You can barely find any mention of this on adobe.com and the software still seems to install quite fine.\nBottom line - if you have a Snow Leopard Macbook Pro - do NOT install Adobe CS3 software - in particular Version Cue.\n", "Q: How do I disable Front Row?

After it is finished syncing, it will be ready to go. If the iPod was previously synced to another computer and not set for \"manually manage music\", syncing with the new computer will replace the songs on the iPod.

Moving to Austria in two weeks. AT&T is going to unlock my phone for me before I leave since my contract is in good standing with them.\nWill I be able to use my iPhone 4 with European carrier sim cards once I get there?\n\nA: iPhone 4 supports four GSM frequencies (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz). Phones like these are usually referred to as \"quad-band\" or \"world-phones\", because of these frequencies, most carriers around the world will support one or more of them.\nOnce unlocked, you should be able to use it pretty much anywhere that has a GSM network. You won't be able to use it on carriers that use CDMA networks as that's a different type of wireless radio entirely.\nCDMA doesn't use SIM cards, so that's an easy way to tell them apart.\nOne other thing you should keep in mind is that iPhone 4 uses a micro-SIM. If your European provider doesn't provide micro-SIMs, you'll need to take a regular sized SIM and cut it to size.\nDue to the popularity of the iPhone outside the US, even in countries where it's sold only on the gray market, it's pretty easy to find small cellphone vendors that can do this for you.\n\nA: Just a heads-up: I unlocked my iPhone 4 (using AT&T's unlocking service) but found that it does not function with the Vodaphone simcard I bought in Greece. I hear that there are two kinds of unlocking, one for domestic service and one for international (GSM) service.\n", "Q: AppleScript and Growl: How to choose the display style? I'm using AppleScript and calling Growl notifications and I notice that it ignores my choice of using Bezel as my system default style. It only changes if I manually change it in Growl's preferences.\nHow can I choose a style through AppleScript?\nI ask this because different styles would be better for different notifications type.\n\nA: Each Applescript you use Growl with registers itself as a different application with Growl.\nAfter the first time you use a script, you can go to Growl's settings. Look for the application name you registered the script as. (This is configurable in the register as application \"Application Name\" line when scripting Growl.)\nOnce you've used the script once, it should show up in Growl's settings. In there you can customize the display location and style specifically for that script, or as Growl calls it, that \"application\".\nIf you need more info about using Growl with Applescript, I have a blog post here, which explains how it works and provides a pre-built Applescript handler that you can drop into your scripts and call with a single line of code.\n", "Q: Will I be able to use an unlocked AT&T iPhone 3GS with European carriers?

I ended up getting a new Mac since the computer was old anyway. \nI'm worried that the last couple days of Time Machine backups will be bad due to the dying hard drive, so I'd like to use an earlier backup date from before it started dying with Migration Assistant.\nI don't see any way in Migration Assistant to select the date of the backup that I want to use.\nShould I just \"delete\" the latest backup folder dates from the Time Machine drive? Will that screw up the backup?\nAny other way to accomplish this?\n\nA: You should temporarily move the backups from the corrupt/unwanted version of the system to a different location, and then attempt the Restore. You may also try renaming the unwanted backups. For more, please go to:\nhttps://thedesignspace.net/2014/01/11/osx-migration-assistant-doesnt-see-all-time-machine-backups/\n\nA: It seems possible to just move away the unwanted backups and re-linking the Latest directory. A few things to know about TM first:\n\n*\n\n*It uses directory hard links, which are kind of black magic\n\n*It's super fragile, and once this is done, I would format the disk and start backing up from scratch\n\nNow, the finder is \"\"smart\"\" and tries to block the user from modifying TM backups by hand. Also the terminal does the same, so no luck. The first thing to do is to rename the backup folder so they don't think it's TM anymore:\ncd /Volumes/Time\\ Machine # or your disk name\nmv Backups.backupdb Backups.backupdb_1\n\nNow the folder is unprotected. You can move the unwanted backups to the parent directory (do NOT delete them), with the finder or the terminal.\nMake sure to also move away the \"in progress\" backup and the Latest folder. You'll need to re-create it with the terminal, it's a soft link:\nln -s 2021-[the latest backup] Latest\n\nDo not include any trailing slash, I'm not sure if this step is sufficient alone to restore from a previous backup, it's worth trying out.\nOnce this is done, to verify that the correct backup is loaded, check the date shown by the migration assistant.\n\nA: Just select the drive to restore from - the Migration Assistant will then give the list of backups by date to choose from.\n", "Q: How can I send my computer's audio to multiple outputs? I'm sending my system's audio to Soundflower, but I want to send it to my headphones at the same time. Is there any way I can achieve this?\n\nA: That's where the Soundflowerbed application comes into play. It lets you select out of which output you would like to play the sound that the rest of the system is feeding into sound flower.\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Open Audio MIDI Setup from Applications > Utilities.\n\n*Click the + button in the bottom left corner and select \"Create Multi-Output Device\".\n\n*Check “Built-In Output” (this may already be checked) and the Soundflower output of your choice.\n\n*Right-click (or control-click) the device you just created and select “Use this device for sound output”.\n\n\n\n", "Q: How can I speed up Mouse Keys? I have been exploring the OS X accessibility option to control the mouse from your keyboard (as described here) and I am curious if there is a way to make it go faster.  \n\nA: KeyRemap4Mac is a nice program that has a large number of various configurations which allow you to modify the function of your keyboard, including the ability to speed up you mouse navigation via the keyboard!\nLook in look in Mouse Keys section.\n\nA: Step 1:\nFirst I turn off Mouse Keys, then I open Terminal and execute this command:\ndefaults write com.apple.universalaccess mouseDriverInitialDelay -float 0.05\ndefaults write com.apple.universalaccess mouseDriverMaxSpeed -int 32\n\nAfter re-enabling, mouse starts moving almost immediately.\nStep 2:\nInstall the demo version of ControllerMate ( http://controllermate.com ), and create something similar:\n\nNow pressing the Ctrl key will act as a turbo key, moving your mouse very fast instantly. (If anybody knows an alternative to the otherwise great ControllerMate, please leave a comment.)\n", "Q: Easiest way to browse iPhone filesystem What method of browsing the root filesystem is least likely to make any modifications to it?  Hooking to a pc is an option.  Jailbreaking is not an option for this question. \n\nA: I'm using DiskAid which is a good file manager to access the iPhone file system from your desktop Mac or Windows. You can connect to your device through Wi-Fi or USB, access your App contents, Music, SMS etc. Transfers are stable and reliable, for example if you disconnect your USB cable during a transfer the transfer will automatically continue via Wi-Fi.\nhttp://www.digidna.net/diskaid\nThe root file system is accessible in DiskAid but as the other similar solutions only if your device is jailbroken.\n\nA: Despite the fact Steve Jobs didn't support this idea because it's making things complicated for the users, there are some apps which will allow you to do so.\nThere is i-FunBox which allows you to browse through your iPhone files on your Mac. And if you're a Windows user, you've more options. There is iPhoneBrowser or iPhone Folders.\nAll of these solutions will allow you to browse the iPhone file systems using your computer. \nIf you want to be able to browse on your iPhone yourself, I'm afraid I only know one solution, called iFile. But this is only accessible on a jailbroken device...\n\nA: Sorry to break the news...but...\nYou cannot reach the root directory without something being compromised on the phone itself. You may be able to access your music/photos/ringtones, but the root directory is off-limits to non-jailbroken iPhone users.\n\nA: Theres more than 1 option. Download dropcopy on your iPhone. Press the circle. Press preview. Press Root Filesystem. There you go! You don't have to be jail broken.\n", "Q: How can I get rid of this context menu option? I deleted AppDelete from my computer because I used it once and it sat on my computer for like forever. Now every time I click on something in finder, it gives me the option to delete it with AppDelete. How can I get rid of this?\n\nYou can see it is the bottom option in the popup menu.\n\nA: From: http://www.reggieashworth.com/appdelete\n\nAppDelete keeps a .workflow file to provide a contextual menu item for convenience. If ever removal is required simply delete it from your /Library/Services folder. Or on Leopard your /Library/Workflows/Applications/Finder folder.\n\nIt appears you should be able to remove that menu item by deleting an item from one of the afore mentioned folders depending on which OS you have installed.\n", "Q: Is there a way to burn a Lion installation DVD-R from a new Mac mini or Macbook Pro? I got a new Mac mini and Macbook Pro, and hope to burn a Lion installation DVD-R if it needs to be used in the future.\nBut I searched for any file greater than 1GB on the hard drive and didn't find any.  Since we can use command r to boot up a partition for reinstallation, is there a way to mount that partition and burn the image to a DVD-R?\n\nA: You can easily create a bootable USB drive as long as it's at least 1gb by using Apple's Recovery Disk Assistant. This will create a recovery partition on the drive but still needs to download Lion if you need to reinstall it at a later date.\nYou can create a bootable image from the original Lion installer download if you kept a copy of it, but you need an 8gb drive, so unless you have dual layer blank DVDs, then this isn't really worth the hassle, and using a spare USB drive would probably be easier. A great guide for doing this can be found here.\n", "Q: Export OS X Lion Blog / Wiki We have a blog on OS X Lion Server with about 750 Entries and would like to export them in order to migrate to a different platform (Confluence). \nAlthough I found a solution to export a Snow Leopard Blog/Wiki to CSV, I couldn't find anything to export the Blog Data of a Lion Server installation.\n\nA: There is no ready-made solution for this AFAIK. This article tells how to backup and restore the whole wiki or just a single wiki (or blog?), but the output created by \"wikiadmin export\" seems to be some binary dump of the database which can be fed only to \"wikiadmin import\".\nThe Lion Server Blog/Wiki itself is kept in a Postgres database named \"collab\", which you can access from the server's command line: sudo -u _postgres psql collab. The table structure seems quite complex, though - I have a test wiki with 2 documents and it still has 67 tables. You might want to try some graphical frontend for Postgres \n to look through the tables and export those needed.\n", "Q: Can Xcode compile C programs? For the last couple of hours, I have been trying to find and install a gcc compiler so that I can compile C programs using eclipse C/C++ IDE. Eclipse doesn't come with a compiler, so I tried to find one but I haven't found a way to get one. I looked up Xcode in the App Store and I heard from some sites that it can compile C programs. Can it compile C programs? Is it better than Eclipse? If not, does anyone know where I can find a gcc compiler for my Mac? I'm running Mac OS X Lion.\nThis is the version of Eclipse I am running: http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-cc-developers-includes-incubating-components/indigosr2\n\nA: To get a free C/C++ compiler you have to download Xcode. It includes two C compilers; clang (the compiler Apple currently supports) and an old version of gcc. (Note current versions of Xcode >=5 I think only have clang) Make sure you install the command line tools if you want to use the compilers from outside Xcode. (These command line tools also seem to be available from Apple's developer site if you register but I would get them via Xcode unless you have a very good reason and understand the difference).\nAll other compilers I know of use one of these two compilers and their binary tools to set themselves up. (e.g. package management systems like macports, fink and homebrew need these command line tools to run parts of their infrastructure as well as to compiler their ports - however these package managers include ports of  other c compilers e.g. newer versions of gcc.)\nIDEs like Eclipse use these command line compilers to do the building of programs.\nThere are some commercial compilers like Intel's C++ compiler but I do not know if these require Xcode or are C compilers.\n\nA: Yes, Xcode can compile C/C++ programs.\nAnother option would be to use Macports to install gcc.\nEdit: As stated in the comments, you actually need Xcode to install Macports, I blame me missing this on the fact that I haven't had an OS X install without Xcode since I started using OS X. Still, Macports is good for getting slightly more up-to-date versions of things, Xcode tends to be more about stable than new (not that it matters all too much for most users when it comes to C compilers).\n", "Q: Mac Mail with Exchange stopped working, LibSasl2SASLClient error I've had Mail.app on Lion (and previously Snow Leopard) successfully working with my company's Exchange 2007 for the last couple of years, but today it seems like it's decided not to work. Instead, I get an error message in the UI that it was unable to connect, and in Console.app, the only related message I get seems to be:\n25/06/2012 12:32:01.490 Mail: [<_LibSasl2SASLClient: 0x7fcb2944de10> mechanism:\nPLAIN security layer: no] Failed to start the SASL connection\nSASL(-1): generic failure: \n\nAnd that's all. The connection does work with Outlook, however. A Google search hasn't turned up anything useful. Any thoughts on where I can go with this? Unfortunately our IT team doesn't support Mail.app (only Outlook) and they're even reluctant to support Lion, so they won't be much help, and I'd really rather use Mail.app than that horrible bloatware.\n\nA: It looks like this was some kind of configuration problem on the Exchange server. It was resolved by my IT team. Unfortunately I don't have any more details than that.\n", "Q: move to trash on ~/.Trash folder Why finder application is showing move to trash on ~/.Trash folder? If you will click on move to trash it will show an indefinite progress indicator that will never ends.\n\n\n\nA: Almost all Mac users won't ever see hidden files and folders in Finder. There's no need for Apple to hide actions on stuff which is already hidden in the first place.\nExperienced users like you, who know how to show hidden folders in Finder, should also know that moving the Trash into itself is a weird idea.\n", "Q: What size is my iPhone 4? I always thought my iPhone 4 was only 8GB in size, does this mean it is 16GB?\n\n\nA: Yes, you do have a 16 GB iPhone. The other 2.2 GB are taken up by iOS, etc. See here for more information.\nYour model, MC676LL, confirms this: it indicates that you have a Black 16 GB iPhone on Verizon. See this Bestbuy page for more info. The 8 GB phones have different model numbers.\n\nA: Yep, looks like it's a 16GB. The reason you see a \"Capacity\" value less than 16GB is that the remainder of the space is used by the phone's operating system, so isn't available for your use.\nAFAIK, before the introduction of the iPhone 4S, and the \"low-end\" 8GB model of the iPhone 4 at a reduced price, all iPhone 4 models were 16GB or higher. So if your phone is older than October 2011, there's no way it could be 8GB.\n\nA: Indeed, you have a 16Gb iPhone right there.  If it was 32Gb then the capacity would show as 28.5Gb.\nYou may have been confused because (perhaps) the currently selling iPhone 4 tops out at 8Gb, but if you got one when it was the most recent model (i.e. before the 4S) then it came in 8/16/32 capacities.\nThe actual available capacity as compared with the nominal capacity is always less, as the operating system and default apps all take up some of the avaliable space, as well as setting some aside for emergency use.  It's possible to fill an iPhone such that it says 0bytes free, and still be able to take and store a screenshot of that message... - the usage stats are not necessarily to be relied upon.\n\nA: There are only 3 sizes available for the Verizon iphone4 (reference)--8, 16, and 32 GB.  Yours is clearly the 16GB.  Apparently, Apple shows capacity as total-capactiy minus the size of iOS.\n", "Q: execute login items one after another instead of all at once? I have quite a lot of startup items, because when I open up my mac, I want everything to be ready to go. In my preferences, I've put them in the order I need them, so for example, the first thing I do, is browse to arstechnica and stackoverflow, so chrome starts first. next up are iTunes and spotify. iTunes to make sure that all my podcasts are downloaded, and spotify for my music, and then, my text editor of choice, and some other stuff.\nThe problem is, that all of these take quite some time and processing power to start up. They all get started up at about the same time,  so that when I start typing in the chrome omnibar, it's  slow and laggy, because of all the other stuff starting up in the background.\nIs there a way to make them start up one after another? Or is this impossible? I really don't know wether apps send some kind of event to the OS to tell that they are completely ready.\n\nA: You could make an automator action that starts each item serially, with staggered delays, or sleeps to ensure a delay between each start, and then simply place that single script as your startup item :)\n", "Q: What is the max resolution output by the HDMI port of the MacBook Pro Retina? Does the MacBook Pro (Retina, Mid 2012) output 2560x1600 to the HDMI port?\nThe reason I ask is that I would like to drive 2x30 inch 2560x1600 monitors while still using the Gigabit Ethernet adapter. (My backup plan is to get the USB 2 to 100 Mbit adapter and use that and then just use the Thunderbolt for graphics). So I would appreciate any additional caveats to this plan as well. \n\nA: If it's HDMI 1.4 as noted above, it should support \"4k\" resolution (4096×2160p24)\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI#Version_1.4\n\nA: The hardware on the mid-2012 Retina MacBook Pro technically supports up to 4K resolution over HDMI.\nHowever, OS X seems to limit the resolution to 1080p60 (1920x1080 at 60 hertz).\nThe NVIDIA drivers on Windows support higher resolutions, for example I have no problem using an Asus 27\" 2560x1440 at 60 hertz over HDMI on the rMBP (Windows 8.1 in Bootcamp). The same display will only go up to 1080p when run on OS X Mavericks (10.9).\nIt might be possible to enable higher resoutions on OS X via HDMI using SwitchResX (I haven't tried).\n\nA: Given that the new (late-2013) Mac Pro supports 4k over HDMI, this is wrong. \nI believe HDMI is limited to full HD resolution, i.e., 1080p (1920x1080), so nothing can drive a larger screen through that.\nEven if HDMI isn't restricted to 1080p, 2560x1600 requires dual-link DVI and I'm quite certain that HDMI doesn't have those pins, restricting it to the resolutions single-link DVI is capable of (2,098 × 1,311).\nYour best bet is to use the 10/100 Fast Ethernet adapter over USB.\n\nA: DisplayPort can display without problem at 2560x1440.\nUnder Windows 7, you can set a personalized resolution for HDMI to use 2560x1440.\nUnder Windows 8, this personalized resolution didn't work :( Perhaps W8 is too young and we must wait a bit.\nUnder Mac, I don't know.\n-> HDMI is in standard limited to FullHD, but with some tweak, you can go higher.\n\nA: From the MacBook Pro Retina Specs Page(2013):\nHDMI video output\nSupport for 1080p resolution at up to 60Hz\nSupport for 3840-by-2160 resolution at 30Hz\nSupport for 4096-by-2160 resolution at 24Hz\n\nIt'd be nice if they mentioned the 2560x1440 resolution at all, but they don't appear to in the official specs, despite mentioning higher resolution support.\n\nA: Where is all this \"HDMI is limited to full HD\" falseness coming from?  For years HDMI has supported resolutions well beyond any what TV set could display... or at least any TV set mere mortals can afford.\nIf you don't trust Wikipedia, then go to the source and look at the HDMI 1.4 specs for yourself.  http://www.hdmi.org/download/press_kit/PressBriefing_HDMI1_4_FINAL_8_0_061809.pdf\n", "Q: SVN client for Mac I cannot seem to find any good Subversion client for my Mac! I use TortoiseSVN at work, and it's awesome, but it's for Windows only. My colleague uses Cornerstone for his Mac, and it is not bad and has a good interface, but it does cost money.\nI could stick with Terminal, but a GUI makes it easier when a lot of merging is needed.\nSo, any suggestions?\np.s. I like sleek graphical interfaces, my philosophy is this: if the app doesn't look good, stick with Terminal.\n\nA: Xcode has a built-in SVN client which is merely okay. Some people seem to like SvnX, but I've not been happy with its user interface.\nBut here's a different idea: unless you have some specific reason to stick with SVN and ONLY SVN, you could try Git. Git comes with a few GUI tools (which are invoked from the command line), and you can continuously integrate between Git and SVN repositories with very little effort. The Git branching model is also especially fantastic for collaboration, although even for single-person projects I like it much more than SVN, as it gives me a lot more flexibility in how I manage and release my projects. There are also a number of fantastic GUIs for Git on OS X, many of them free, and I believe Xcode supports git directly now, too.\n\nA: Source Tree is a good free app for SVN, Git and Mercurial. Support is great and it as good look!\n\nA: svnX is an graphical client to subversion (svn) for Mac OS X.\nNot the most pretty client but svnX is open source and has been actively supported for many years.\n\n\nA: There is also uberSVN - I haven't tried it myself, I use SVN via the Eclipse IDE and/or the command line, so I can't comment on it's quality.\n\nA: I'm using CRAX and I'm finding this software good enough in SVN local repo management. Using it is very similiar to the using TortoiseSVN and TotalCommander on Windows. And this soft is cheeper than other SVN clients for MAC.\n\nA: You can also use the terminal (terminal.app) for small operations.\nType \"svn help\" to find out how to use the svn with the promp. ;)\n\nA: i know its a bit old but if you dont want any client you can just right click on finder and connect to server input your url and username and password and you can view all the files and folder\n", "Q: Speed up the transition between spaces? Is it possible to speed up the transition between spaces?  I often open my applications in full screen mode but I would like the transition to be a bit faster, is there a way to speed this up (i.e. when I hit Ctr rightarrow it moves one space to the other quicker than the default setting).\n\nA: What you are looking for is TotalSpaces.\nThe new version has the ability to remove the delay completely. Working great so far.\n\nA: I'm not sure if this works, as I have not tested it out myself, but I found this terminal command here:\n\nDisable the switching Spaces animation in the terminal by typing:\ndefaults write com.apple.dock workspaces-swoosh-animation-off -bool YES && killall Dock\nTo enable again, type the following:\ndefaults delete com.apple.dock workspaces-swoosh-animation-off && killall Dock\n\nThis completely disables the animation, and I'm not sure if that's what you want, but I imagine that if the animation is completely disabled, the switch between spaces would be instantaeneous.\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Simulator to run iOS apps on laptop? Is there a simulator that I can run iOS on a Mac that would allow me to launch and use apps as if I was on the device?  This is for consumer testing not for development. \nWhat I am trying to do is to load the simulator app that would allow my Mac to act as if it was an iPhone/iPad. Then that laptop would join a consumer panel (ooVoo or Adobe Connect) and give the user control so that they can use and interact with an app that is available, while the research team is talking to them about the app.  \nDoes anyone know how I can do this?\n\nA: I agree with Ryokuchasan: the only simulator I've heard of is the one bundled with the iOS development tools. This only works with apps you have the source code to because it compiles the iOS app for Intel to run in OS X (using the Simulator window as a screen).\nIt also has limited multi-touch capability, generally limited to pinch-to-zoom, so you likely won't be able to demo the majority of many apps. (Also, using the mouse to drive an iOS app can be awkward.)\nIf you want to do consumer testing with iOS apps, you need a physical device in the same room as the test user.\n\nA: No that's not possible because the iPhone has an ARM processor, while your Mac has an Intel x86 or a i386 processor. To get the application to run on your Mac you need the source code, compile it with Xcode, and run with iOS-Simulator.\nBut you can remote your iPhone screen from Mac with \"Veency\" from Cydia and \"Chicken of the VNC\" a short tutorial on how to do that you can find here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HPkWysj324\n\nA: There are several web services such as App.io and Appetize.io that run apps in your browser.  \nSee https://www.tenorshare.com/iphone-tips/ios-emulator-for-pc-mac.html for more options and details.\n", "Q: How to import Notes.app notes into Simplenotes.app?

I'm open to any solution that doesn't involve manually going note-by-note.\nThanks, guys!\n\nA: Answer from SimpleNote Agent\nSpoiler alert: Not unless you want to copy/paste. If you're a premium user of SimpleNote, you can email all of your Notes.app notes and import them that way.\nThe only other solution is if you can find a way to import a SQLite database into SimpleNote, in which case you would use the files located at:\n~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes/Data/Library/Notes/\n\n\nA: I had to copy and paste each note! A real chore!!\n", "Q: How can I specify a smaller block size for a Ramdisk? I use a ramdisk to speed up a git repository with a lot (> 60k) of small (~200 bytes) files.\nIs there a way to create a ramdisk with a smaller block size?\n\nA: Executive summary: I don't believe this is possible, at least not for volumes formatted as HFS+.\nMy current understanding is that HFS+ chooses its file system block size (separate from the physical device block size) according to a fixed default allocation block size that cannot be manually overruled.\n\nDiscussions in other forums spanning from 2002 to 2011 ( CompGroups, MacRumors among others) suggest using newfs_hfs(8), which has a -b <blocksize> option, to manually set the block size when creating a new file system.\nI tried using newfs_hfs  on various kinds of partitions, on both .dmg diskimages and on physical SATA hard drives (through SATA<->USB interface) and with various file systems (HFS+, FAT16, FAT32.)  When I ran newfs_hfs with different -b sizes (512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192,) indeed it reported success in creating the filesystems with the specified block sizes. I could mount & read/write these volumes normally.\nBut when I examine the test volumes with diskutil info <diskname> (where <diskname> is disk1, disk4, or whatever your disk is), I always see:\nTotal Size:               104.9 MB (104857600 Bytes) (exactly 204800 512-Byte-Blocks)\nVolume Free Space:        102.4 MB (102385664 Bytes) (exactly 199972 512-Byte-Blocks)\nDevice Block Size:        512 Bytes\n\nNoting that the end of the newfs_hfs(8) man page includes this tidbit:\nHISTORY\nThe newfs_hfs command appeared in Mac OS X Server 1.0 .  As of Mac OS X\n10.6, this utility no longer generates HFS standard file systems.\n\nIt would appear that OS X 10.8 (and probably 10.7, and perhaps earlier versions) overrides whatever block size newfs_hfs claims to create, in favor of default sizes imposed by a higher authority. (??)\n\nOne article I came across suggested using OS X's software-RAID utility to create a RAID mirror. Software RAID allows one to specify a RAID stripe size, but as this is generally geared towards improving throughput for large files rather than tiny ones, I believe the minimum RAID stripe size is 4KB - not useful for your purposes.\n", "Q: Discrepancies in available capacity of Macbook Air SSD I bought a MBA with an SSD advertised to be 256GB.\nThe actual unformatted capacity, according to the system info tool, is only 251000193024 bytes.\n\nThis is only 233 Gibi (2^30) bytes, or 251 Giga (10^9) bytes. Regardless of whether Apple means Giga or Gibi in their spec sheets, this capacity is still outrageously lower than advertised.\nIs a part of the SSD reserved for some hidden function and is subtracted from the size that appears in the system info?\nOr is Apple consciously cheating its customers?\n\nA: It is interesting to note that Hard Drive Manufacturers use the correct meaning of \"Gigabytes\" when referring to hard drives, and not what most people think of as a GB which is actually a Gibibyte:\nGigabyte = 10 to the 9 bytes = 1000000000bytes = 1000 megabytes\n\nGibibyte = 2 to the 30 bytes = 1073741824bytes = 1024 mebibytes\n\nSince Mac OS X also switched to this \"proper\" definition for storage units such as Gigabytes as of Snow Leopard, then the size of the drive should be understood in these terms, noting that on a Mac the OS and the Hard Drive will be talking the same language, there is no need to do the conversion from Gibibytes to Gigabytes.\nThe given size should be correct and accurate as reported on a Mac as they have a common understanding of what a Gigabyte is, and incorrect on Windows which uses the commonly misused Gibibyte structure on it's filesystems whilst users incorrectly assume it is measured in Gigabytes.\nTechnically manufacturers should use GiB not GB when marketting and packaging their drives, but they don't/won't, and use Gigabyte which they know practically everyone uses incorrectly.\nIn your case the available unformatted capacity is indeed low even for using the correct maths, but as referenced in another answer the size of 256Gb refers to the total storage capacity of the drive, and you have to not only accept that formatted capacity is lower, but also that the capacity that is available to format can also be lower, if portions are reserved for the purposes of replacing bad blocks through the lifecycle of the drive.\n\nLengthy comment follows after the first 2 comments below - too long for a comment tho, but not really part of the answer other than background info perhaps\n\nThe space reservation thing is not something I feel I can be canonical about, I know the theory, I can't really backup it up once and for all, especially because this is an Apple non-consumer drive.  However, almost all drives over provision, providing more space than they state in order to have capacity for replacing worn areas.\nIt's not 100% clear, but it certainly appears to be the case, that in the case of these Apple supplied drives, the provision of \"backup\" blocks is taken from the stated capacity from the off.  I think this is how most manufacturers do it, hence the fact that you see way more 60Gb drives than 64Gb etc.  The implication being that there is 64Gb of storage capacity, and 60 of it us user addressable.  Whether you call that a 60 or a 64Gb drive could potentially be taken either way.  I would call it a 60, but from a legal perspective I would imagine both cases are arguable accurate.  As for the instances you see where the available capacity is equal to or greater than the nominal capacity (in the case of the 128Gb drives you see) then it could simply be the case that some manufacturers are either more generous, or more worried about failure, than others and genuinely put in more chips worth, say 132Gb for example.\nSo in you case, you likley have a 256Gb drive in terms of chips, the fact that the user addressable space is lower, even before formatting is likely just how it is.  I have an Apple supplied 128Gb Air SSD which shows much the same behaviour:\nAPPLE SSD TS128C:\nCapacity: 121.33 GB (121,332,826,112 bytes)\n  Model:    APPLE SSD TS128C                        \n\nA: No its a thing that has been going on since are drives were first introduced (when I was young and 20Mb Hard Drives were the whizz bang and DOS 4 was hot, it wasn't such a big deal)\nHard drive manufactures quote their hard drive sizes in thousands, millions, billions, just like cash, in base 10 (GB)\nPeople who use computers calculate size in multiples of 2^10 bytes (1024 bytes)\nThe difference mostly is the conversion, plus some that is left over from partitioning that cannot be partitioned due to the way that partitioning works, and quite probably the Lion Recovery Partition.\nFinally, in answer to your question, does Apple engage in false advertising.  No, it does specifically state on all its product pages where appropriate to the device, that the HD capacity is measured in GB.\n\n1GB = 1 billion bytes; actual formatted capacity less.\n\nYou should also be aware that some SSD's come with a default space used for formatting, and redundancy for wear levelling and can be up to 5% of the nominal capacity of the SSD drive.  This area is managed by the SSD firmware and is never seen by the OS and the OS reports a lower size than the actual SSD size.\n\nA: As has you have guessed, this does not have to do with how decimal and binary numeral systems measure a GB.\nApple has released a knowledge base article (see last paragraph) where they mention briefly why the capacity in Solid State Drives is smaller:\n\nUnderstanding storage capacity in Solid State Drives\nStorage capacity displayed in Disk Utility by for Solid State Drives will show a slightly smaller size. For Example, the 256 GB Solid State Drive (SSD) should have a total of approximately 250 GB.  \nThese items may account for the additional space used in your Solid State drive:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*EFI Partition\n  \n*Restore Partition \n  \n*Wear-leveling blocks\n  \n*Write-buffer area\n  \n*Metadata\n  \n*Spare blocks\n  \n*Grown bad blocks\n  \n*Factory bad blocks\n  \n\nWhat's surprising is that Apple talks about Solid State Drives and not Flash Memory even though they are basically the same.\nI had thought that this is because this article is about SSDs in general. But this can't be true because not all third-party SSDs which you can use in your Macbook Pro use that much space for wear-leveling for example. I have used a 128GB SSD Crucial m4 SSD in my Macbook Pro and the capacity reported by Disk Utility is 128GB.\nTechnical details about the management of the flash memory in the SSD differ depending on the manufacturer. Therefore I'll think this article refers to Apple SSDs only (which does not mean that some of the points raised here aren't true for other SSDs as well).\n\nA: I don't think the typical discrepancy between 1000MB or 1024MB being 1GB is the issue here.\nApple's OS uses the same metric as storage manufacturers (1000MB = 1GB), so a 256GB drive should be reported as 256GB. My 128GB SSD is reported as 128.04GB in OS X's 'System Report'\nMy guess is that some manufacturers make 250GB drives and others make 256GB drives, and Apple is sourcing from both and just listing both as 256GB.\nedit: Space reservations for bad memory cells could also be the possible cause in this case. I know some manufacturers do that.\n\nA: The capacities Apple advertises on their website are not consistent with industry standards.  Samsung, the industry leader, does not include over provisioning in their advertised capacities.  And Samsung provides the flash drives that Apple includes in the latest MacBook Pros with Retina.\nThe total capacity of the internal flash storage on my 256GB rMBP (which is manufactured by Samsung, APPLE SSD SM0256F) as reported by Disk Utility is:\nTotal Capacity :    251 GB (251,000,193,024 Bytes)\n\nAnd the total capacity of my 250GB Samsung 840EVO SSD as reported by Disk Utility is:\nTotal Capacity :    250.06 GB (250,059,350,016 Bytes)\n\nYou can see that Apple should be advertising that its flash is 251GB -- not 256GB.  It's too bad.  They don't need to resort to this type of deceptive marketing (including the name APPLE SSD SM0256F).  Shame on Apple.\nIt doesn't matter, but for those who think it does I have installed OSX to the external drive using the recovery utility before getting these numbers.\n\nA: All this over ?\nbase 10 and base 2 math.!\nand formatted and un-formatted capacity which in fact varies by , drum roll...?\nthe actual format you used or picked day one. (wiki that, and learn)\nif anyone read the product data sheet (yes, try that...) it's all there clear as day.

Is it possible to manually put an external hard disk to sleep? Right now, I've already got \"Put the hard disks to sleep when possible\" checkmarked in the Energy Saver preference pane, and so they should sleep after 10 minutes of inactivity, but I'm wondering if it's also possible to do this manually whenever I want.\nI just bought an external hard drive and it's already spinning constantly, compared to my current external which is completely quiet, so I'm wondering if I can put it to sleep when I need to to stop it from spinning all the time.\n\nA: Not an exact answer to your question, but when using Terminal.app there is an option to even further reduce hard disk sleep time from 10 minutes to 1 minute, with this command:\n$ sudo pmset -a disksleep 1\n\n\nA: On macOS, there's isn't a way to do so from the command line.  To put your drives to sleep (aka spin down) you need to send an ATA command to the drive.  This becomes problematic when trying to do this to USB drives because it would be dependent on what the USB to ATA bridge (controller in/on the USB enclosure/interface, not in the Mac) was capable of supporting (this is also why you can't reliably get SMART status from USB drives).\n\n\n*\n\n*In Linux, you can use the hdparm -Y /dev/sdX\n\n*In Windows, there is an app called RevoSleep\n\n*BSD has the atacontrol and camcontrol utilities to send ATA commands\n\n*SpindownHD was a utility with Apple's CHUD tools, but it's last release was in 2006\n\n\nUnfortunately, at current for macOS,  there is nothing that allows sending ATA commands directly to drives.  It would need to be embedded into something like diskutil or a 3rd party app to get the functionality you are looking for.  Though (IMO) it's unlikely because with the increasing prevalence of SSDs, there's really no more need to \"spin down\" a drive.\nFor more info, see this post on SuperUser: Ways to shut down/sleep and wake up hard drives on command?\nYour best bet is to either eject the disk or set the sleep timer to 1 minute.\n", "Q: Battlefield 2 via CrossOver: Graphic Bug With High Terrain I'm trying to play Battlefield 2 with CrossOver on 10.7.4 but it produces a graphic glitch:\n\nI've already checked the software updates for new graphic-divers but can't find any anything. Is there maybe a way to update the drivers without the \"Software Update...\" seclection from ? Does anyone have ideas how to fix this?\nThanks for every answer!\n\nA: Unlike on a Windows gaming machine you don't have many choices to fix such issues on a Mac. As far as I know there are no dedicated drivers sections on the NVIDIA or ATI pages and no possible beta-drivers from Apple.\nAfter a couple of years I ended up with a separate Bootcamp partition for the gaming fun because (forgive the harsh words) all the CrossOver, Wine, whatever crap sucks! Take a look in the AppStore and see the comments on Civ V as an example.

Is this something to be concerned about or is this an expected event?\n\nA: NTPd can be configured to get time from any host. Notably many use http://www.pool.ntp.org\nThat IP is running a ntp server with accurate time; and a http server, the page is mostly invalid HTML with Google Ads. It doesn't look terribly nefarious, so I'd guess that something else is going on here.

I have Mac OS 10.7.4 and I'd like Finder to use \"Is Folder?\" as its first sort criteria, or in other words, group folders before files regardless of the sorting method.\nWindows and Linux both do this by default.\n\nA: On macOS Sierra, there is a way to group folders together. Launch the Finder. Then head to Finder > Preferences in the menu bar. Head to Advanced and check the option 'Keep folders on top when sorting by name'.\n\nA: Finder > Preferences > Advanced > Keep folders on top when sorting by name\n\nBefore macOS 10.12 Sierra, this wasn't an option.\nBefore 10.12, Finder just didn't have a \"group the folders\" at the top/bottom. There are legions of Mac users that put all sorts of characters in their folder names so that they sort above or below when sorted by name.\nThere are all sorts of hacky ways to manipulate the \"kind\" strings internally, but then everything is arranged by kind first, and secondarily alphabetically.\nIf this is a deal breaker - check out the many apps that run in place of the Finder. Here is a query to get you started:\nhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/search?q=finder+replacement\n\nA: TotalFinder also has an option to keep folders on top:\n\n\nA: It is pretty simple to make it just like Windows, with folders (alphabetical) starting at the top then other files (also alphabetical).  You can do it all using the regular finder application on OS X 10.9.  Unfortunately, any applications (.dmg files) will still be stacked above folders.\nGo into finder and under view options sort by name, then kind.  It doesn't put them in the grid by type now.  You'll have to make that the default and probably still change it in all of your favorites from Finder.  Hope this works for others too.\n\nA: I've put together a snippet that does this a la terminal. It uses the \" Folder\" trick to sort folders above files and works in list view only.\n\nUnfortunately files are sorted by kind first then alphabetically. Check the location of bootstrap.sh in the screenshot for example.\n\nA: In the Finder: View Menu -> Arrange -> By Kind\nIn Mountain Lion (OS X 10.8): View menu -> Sort By -> Kind\n(Or use the Finder's shortcut keystroke Command-Option-Control-2)  \n\nA: This can be done. You have to move \"Folders\" to the top of the Spotlight search results list in Spotlight's preferences. Then, arrange by kind in the Finder. This works. Here is what you need to do.\n1) Type something in the SPOTLIGHT search (located on on right top corner of the screen)\n2) At the bottom of the search, click on Spotlight Preferences.\n3) In the preference box, just drag and move the Folder to the top of the list.\n4) That's it. Now no matter how you arrange or sort in Finder window, folders will be at the top followed by other documents.\n5) This is amazingly simple.\n", "Q: How to isolate vocals with Logic I'd like to isolate the vocals on a track I have using Logic.  Can anyone provide some advice on how to do this please?\n\nA: Playing with the equalizer seems to be effective, and there are some presets that help isolate vocals, or boost vocals.\n\nA: You could try also this tricky method.\nNo miracle, just tricky, but it's time-saving because performs a sort of auto tuning.\nJust saying, it's the opposite of cancelling a vocal from a stereo track.\nProvided that most solo vocals are mixed \"in front\" (no panning), when you process the stereo track in a Mid/Side network (M=L+R and S=L-R) and discard the M(id) information, the remaining S(ide) channel has a good attenuation on the direct signal of every sound mixed in center.\nI say \"direct\" (=everithing is exactly in phase) because FXs do not behave this way. For this, a very wet signal (=heavily processed) will be hard to isolate.\nFor this reason, this method has very little effect on live takes made with field recorders.\nBounce the S channel on a new track (and mute the original), plug in the MatchEQ and let it learn its frequency response.\nFlip the curve (save it) and apply it on the original track.\nWith MatchEQ you can also tweak the resolution of the curve and the overall percentage.\nWarning! Mangle ONLY duplicate files!\nIn most cases the M channel is useless, because good mixing engineers always check mono compatibility of their works, but it might be convenient to try MatchEQ on it, as a second chance.\n", "Q: Keyboard ghosting on mac notebooks I recently bought a Retina Macbookpro and want to make sure I can keep it in good condition in the event I need to sell it in the future. Assuming the keyboard is not much different from the integrated keyboards of other computers in the product line; do you think I should buy a keyboard cover? It's not the type of thing I really want, but if it means avoiding wear on the keys' texture, I'll have to go for that. I know that the keyboards are back-lit, but do any of you with Macbooks or apple keyboards experience significant degradation of the keys into that oily look?  \n\nA: I own a late 2008 aluminum MacBook unibody machine, and I use it daily. There's no real \"degradation\" of the keys, though there's one smooth \"polished\" spot on the right of my spacebar, due to heavy use. \nI don't think you have anything to worry about. It's a laptop, the keyboard is meant to be used. \n\nA: The “oily look” to which you refer is, more often than not, literally a coating of finger grease on the keys that can be cleaned off.  It turns out that those Mr Clean Magic Erasers work pretty well for removing grease.  Actual wear on the surface of the keys is less common, unless you type with abrasive gloves or your fingernails; even then, the keys should be fine for at least a decade, as my good old first-generation MacBook can attest.  Probably the best reason to buy a keyboard cover is to protect the keyboard from dirt, foodstuffs, and whatever else might get underneath the keys.  If you clean your keyboard and take good care of it, it shouldn’t decrease resale value.  Just don’t clean your keys so obsessively you wear them out.\n", "Q: iCloud in OS X Implementation - which protocol does it use? In Mountain Lion, iCloud is \"integrated\" in every program.

In addition, for speed iCloud transfers META properties about the files it know about per application before loading content, which enables it to more speedily show you what is available.\n", "Q: How can I have Qt Creator to recognize my environment variables? I use Qt Creator as my main IDE for cross-platform C++ application development. In doing so I had set it up so that it depends on a set of environment variables that I define in .bashrc. \nOn Linux (Ubuntu specifically) that works fine but on OSX Lion I cannot get it to work. I have defined my variables in .bashrc and .bashrc is sourced inside .bash_profile. The variables are defined when I do echo $VAR inside the terminal but when I open the IDE (from Dock) it does not recognize the variables. Does Dock not use bash to launch applications?\n\nA: Apps launched from the dock or desktop or any GUI do not use bash. They are all children of the workspace (the loginwindow process).\nTo set the environment variables you need to edit ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist which is read when you login.\nThis is a text plist and you need to set a key element to the name of the environment variable it uses and the next string element to its value.

I've got a little business with around 1000 customers and I like to take advantage of a mobile plan that lets me send a lot of SMS messages per month. \nI've got my customers' emails and phone numbers on a spreadsheet. I'd like to export that phone list to the iPhone and create a \"customers\" group on my address book, and from there be able to send this group offers and news through SMS from my phone.\nIs there some iOS app that would let me this, or maybe another parallel solution that combines my desktop PC on my iPhone to perform this task?\n\nA: Although its not exactly what you were asking for, this App does exactly what you want. It seems a little expensive, though. \nAnswering your question, there are a couple of ways you could import the contacts to the iPhone. You could, for instance, do it by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Saving the file as .cvs\n\n*In Outlook Express, choosing File / Import / Address Book, and opening the .cvs file.\n\n*Connecting your iPhone and in iTunes, tick the box next to Sync Contancts With: and choosing Outlook Express.\n\n\nAfterwards you could use an App such as Group SMS, or Group Text! or even create your own group to send the SMSs.

I was quite surprised to discover that both releases and beta versions of LibreOffice and OpenOffice.org do crash on OS X 10.7 when you try to access the preferences screen.\nI even paid to get a copy of NeoOffice which I was able to use, quite well in the last week but ended up finding an ugly bug: bibliography references from inside frames are not numbered, they just use [0] but they are listed in the bibliography list.\nYou end up having a bibliography like:\n[1] ...\n[2] ...\n[3] ...\n[0] ...

And assuming you care about future enhancements and compatibility, LibreOffice is the way to go now. I used to use NeoOffice when it was the only native port of OpenOffice for OS X, but since LibreOffice has a maintained OS X port I just moved to LibreOffice.\nI am on OS X 10.7.4, LibreOffice 3.5.4 and all works fine for me.\n\nA: Here is NeoOffice's list of features that it offers that are not found in LibreOffice or OpenOffice.org:\nhttp://www.neooffice.org/neojava/en/features.php#newnewfeatures\nNeoOffice supports Mac OS X 10.7 Lion's Versions, Media Browser, Full Screen Mode, Apple Core Text for font rendering, and many user-interface elements that use Mac OS X's API code (implemented by the NeoOffice development team) to replace the ported code found in LibreOffice or OpenOffice.org.\nWith the beta of the forthcoming version, they have announced that they have removed the use of Java and have replaced all those Java functions with their own NeoOffice code written in Cocoa.\nYou'll have to decide whether NeoOffice provides a better experience on the Mac for you compared to LibreOffice for Mac.\n(I used NeoOffice and supported them with annual donations for the past decade. This year I finally broke down and purchased Microsoft Office 2011 for Mac to use instead, because I decided I could no longer live without some Microsoft Word features that will never be made available in OpenOffice, LibreOffice or NeoOffice. But I feel the latter three suites are the best choice for most users.)\n\nA: OpenOffice is far from dead, it's just been passed over to Apache for stewardship. I would recommend OpenOffice any day, I've used all Libre Office and Open office with Lion on my wife's macbook air and have found that libre seems to be prone to crashing, whereas we've never had a single problem with open office.

Could it be plug-ins?\nTechnical Details: 2GHz PowerPC G5 iMac OS 10.4.11 running Safari 4.1.3\n\nA: If you are keeping an application like Safari open and constantly running for multiple days at a time, this is the reason itself that is causing you the issue.\nWhen you quit an Application, not close its windows, but actually quit it by either clicking on the name of the application in the top left hand corner and choosing quit or by hitting Command + Q while in the application, it will free up its RAM and resources that it is holding on to.  \nThis happens a lot for people who don't like to restart their machine and constantly leave things running or always open.  Its convenient, no argument there, but it can bog down your computer because it is constantly holding onto everything you have been doing.\nIt would be similar to never cleaning off your desk, always keeping everything you need on your desk at all times.  Things would pile up and pile up and get more and more cluttered.  Its convenient because you have everything in arms reach but after a while, the time it takes to find things in the piles of stuff that you have becomes longer and longer.  That is what safari is doing, it is keeping track of all the stuff you have looked at and watched and done on the internet, just in case you want to return to it quickly.  By leaving Safari open and running for days at a time, it is lugging around so much stuff that even doing simple things becomes a chore.  \nNow I am not telling you to turn off your computer every time your done using it.  Using sleep mode is fine, but just remember to quit your applications.  An easy way to see what Apps are open is by hitting command + tab.  If there are a lot of things open, quit them.  If they are quitted, they won't show up in the little box that pops up when you hit command + tab.  Restarting your machine is good to do every couple of days, because it lets the computer free up resources that it may be holding on to that you probably aren't even using.  Its just part of regular computer maintenance. \nSome people will say to never restart your machine and others will argue and tell you to restart it or turn it off when your not using it.  Everyone will have their theories and opinions when it comes to this.  The important thing to remember either way is that you need to quit the apps that your aren't using anymore.  If you are putting your computer to sleep, and you don't need what was open anymore, close those applications, free up the RAM they are using, give more resources back to the computer so that when you pull it back from sleep, it will be ready to work, instead of remembering to lug around those things you don't care about anymore.  \nYou can also google search ways to keep your mac running smoothly, and you'll notice usually in that list is the advice to quit applications when not in use.  \nI know this was kind of winded, but I hope it helps you keep things optimized and running smoothly.   \n\nA: Browsing on my mac with OS X 10.4.11 was very slow.  I discovered that the culprit was my router having ipv6 enabled.  I ran speedtest.net and was getting blazing speeds so I know it was not my internet connection.  I recently installed a new router and had ipv6 support enabled.  Loading websites the site would have to timeout for each page connection.  I figured that 10.4.11 was old enough to not support ipv6 so I disabled it and now web sites load very quickly.\n", "Q: How can I change Terminal so that I don't have to press ESC every time I want to type a meta-modified key? Currently in emacs/terminal, I have to press ESC every time I want to send an escaped keystroke, eg: to go forwards two words, I have to press:\nESC+f; ESC+f\n\nHow do I change the system so that I just have to press and hold ESC once?:\nESC+f+f\n\n\nA: Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a way to get ESC-f to repeat and it has something to do with ESC. Here's one solution that will work:\nCurrently, Terminal.app is using ESC as META. You can change this to ⌥ (option) like this. \n\n\n*\n\n*Visit Terminal -> Preferences ( ⌘-, ).\n\n*Select the Keyboard Tab on the right\n\n*Check the \"Use option as meta key\" box at the bottom of the Keyboard pane\n\n\nNow enjoy repeating commands that involve meta by using the option key instead of ESC.\n\nA: Select “Use option as meta key” in Terminal > Preferences > Settings > [profile] > Keyboard. Then you can press the Option modifier key and type f twice.\nThe “Meta” key sends an ESC before the character you type in combination with the modifier.\nAlso note that you can use the Keyboard preference to map other keys to commonly used sequences like ESC f.\nIn fact, as of OS X Lion 10.7, Terminal's default keyboard map makes the standard Mac keys for moving left/right a word at a time (Option-Left Arrow/Right Arrow) send ESC b and ESC f, respectively.\n", "Q: Filevault 2 and Changing the Password If I have a system with FileVault 2 enabled on the system and on the Time Machine drive, what happens if I change my system password? Is the encryption based on my login (being able to log in) or is the encryption tied to the password (somehow hashed to the password value so if it changes, the new password can't decrypt the files?)\n10.7.4 running FileVault 2, migrated from 10.6.x installation, if that makes any difference...\n\nA: IIRC, FileVault2 generates its own encryption keys when you start using it. It uses those keys to encrypt the drive, not your password. This is unlike FileValut1 which uses your password itself.\nThe keys themselves, when stored on disk, are THEN encrypted using your password, and therefore can only be  used to read the disk if you have the password. This is the reason multiple accounts can unlock the disk in FV2, and how the \"master key\" can exist (multiple encrypted copies of FV2's storage keys).\nYes, changing your password will mean that this new password is required to access the storage keys, and hence the drive. But this only triggers a re-encryption of the keys, which are very small, and not the entire drive.\nSince FV1 and FV2 are 2 totally different encryption schemes, the fact that you migrated from 10.6 shouldn't matter. Not sure if Lion is backwards compatible with FV1 directories, but as long as you're actually using FileValut2, changing your password should work as described above.\n", "Q: Problem installing rpm using macports I am trying to install the rpm package using MacPorts, but this is what I get:\n~ wdb$ sudo port install rpm\n--->  Computing dependencies for rpm\nError: org.macports.activate for port rpm returned: error renaming \n\"/opt/local/var/macports/build/_opt_local_var_macports_sources_rsync.macports.org_release_tarballs_ports_sysutils_rpm/rpm/work/destroot/opt/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/rpm\"\n to \n\"/opt/local/var/macports/build/_opt_local_var_macports_sources_rsync.macports.org_release_tarballs_ports_sysutils_rpm/rpm/work/destroot/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5/lib/python2.5/site-packages/rpm\": no such file or directory\n\nPlease see the log file for port rpm for details:\n/opt/local/var/macports/logs/_opt_local_var_macports_sources_rsync.macports.org_release_tarballs_ports_sysutils_rpm/rpm/main.log\nTo report a bug, follow the instructions in the guide:\n    http://guide.macports.org/#project.tickets\nError: Processing of port rpm failed\n~ wdb$ \n\nWhat is the exact problem?

I'm running Snow Leopard.\nOne of the frustrations I've had over the past couple weeks is that I can't easily navigate large numbers of windows.  \nI'm used to alt-tab and the task bar.  I'd use alt-tab to go to the most recent windows, and the task bar to go to very old ones.\nOn MacOS, I've been using command-tab to switch between applications, then command-backtick to switch between active windows, but command-backtick is inconsistent, and command-tab isn't consistent in Firefox with multiple virtual desktops (it seems to take you to the most recent window on the active desktop, rather than the most recent window in the app).\nWhile Expose shows me my three-dozen windows in a neatly tiled, seemingly random mosaic.  \nSomebody who grew up on Macs might be able to tell me the secret.  What am I doing wrong?\n\nA: For the full Windows functionality for switching windows look at Optimal Layout or Witch which both make AltTab switch to all windows.\n", "Q: How can I advertise my app on the App Store? When I released my iOS app on the App Store, how can iPhone user know that this new app is released?\nI mean, I do not advertise my app anywhere.\nSo if my app is already released to App Store, I think no one can know about my newly released app. Is that right?\nIf they don't know my newly released app, my iOS apps are just useless.\nI don't want to advertise with money for my app because I am just a beginner iOS developer. So I don't that much have money.\nIs there anyway let user to know about my newly released app without money advertisement?\n\nA: You can link to apps in the appstore. For example:\nhttp://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pinball-arcade/id455826958?mt=8\n(This is just a random app I picked to serve as an example)\nNow, if you have your link to your app, you can:\n\n\n*\n\n*Write a blog about the app and link to it\n\n*Have websites review your app and they will link to it\n\n*Does your app serve the need of a particular community?

I want to use a custom app dock icon, and followed instructions found online, which specified the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find image in Finder\n\n*cmd-i on file to \"Get Info\"\n\n*Click the little icon in the top corner\n\n*cmd-c to copy ... something.\n\n*Open the Applications list in Finder\n\n*cmd-i on the application to \"Get Info\"\n\n*Click on the little icon in the top corner\n\n*cmd-v to paste ... something.\n\n\nThis worked great. Except, not really.\nThe problem: It appears some app, in associating itself with images, has set all those \"Get Info\" icons to generic \"PNG\" and \"JPG\" icons, like so:\n \nThe only image app I've installed is GIMP, and I've played with its and X11's settings but didn't find anything. \nPerhaps there's a way to reset PNG / JPG icons?

Instead it copies the PNG icon which you showed in your screenshot above.\nPinki is a free app I use to create icons from images and copy them to other apps.  Their homepage also lists a couple other options to convert the image to the icon.\n", "Q: OS X Color matching on dual displays I have an iMac and a second display - an LG 24\" panel.\nUsing any colour picker (eg Digital Color Meter) on exactly the same colour gives a different result depending on which screen I pick the colour from.\nAs an example - on a web page, the body colour is defined as #c00202.\nOn the iMac's display, the colour picker gives me the expected value of #c00202, but on my other display, I get a different value - in this case #bc0007.

Worse, any intermediate certificate can fail or expire in a chain of trust so it may not be the first certificate you inspect that causes the failure.\nIn the 2012 case, a temporary mismatch between what Google assumed was a trustworthy certificate chain and what apple has actually shipped caused this.

When working late, I'd like to lower the screen brightness further than the OS X allows in using the brightness keys.\nWhile you can use ⌥+⇧+F1/F21 to change the brightness in smaller quaterish increments, this does not have an effect between 0 and 1 bars.\ni.e. The values 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00 have the same brightness. The brightness only incrementally increases for quaters above 1.\nIn Ubuntu I've accomplished very low brightness settings by manually changing integers in the configuration files. Is there something similar that I could do in OS X?\n\n1 - This works for the volume the same way.\n\nA: QuickShade, available on Mac App Store is a great very simple solution.\nYou can add keyboard shortcuts to it (I picked Fn + Option + F1/F2).\n\n\n*\n\n*QuickShade\n\nA: Check out the app called Shades:\n\nAbout Shades\n  Shades is a FREE utility for controlling the brightness of your screen. It runs in the background providing always-available fine-grained control over the brightness of your display via a slick Mac-like interface\nThough all modern Apple laptops have brightness controls for dimming the screen in dark conditions, there are several situations where the built in controls are unsatisfactory. The granularity of control is rather coarse, and the minimum brightness setting still quite bright when working in pitch darkness.\n  Perhaps you need to use your machine in a darkroom, or like to work late at night without disturbing your partner who sleeps beside you?\n  Perhaps you need to dim the screen on a desktop machine, and the display you are using offers no such facility?\n  If this is the case for you, then try Shades.\nNote: Shades may interfere with colour calibration software, and should not be used if colour accuracy is critical.\n\nMy iMac has a \"fault\" in that the lower I set the brightness, the noisier the screen buzzes, due to an issue with the capacitor that does the work.  But using this app I can get the brightness down way further than using hardware controls on the backlight, and the buzzing is not introduced either.  Double result!\nIt's also useful to use this tool for altering the brightness on external displays which do not respond to the brightness key controls.\n\nA: No longer maintained nor available\nA newcomer here is Desktop Dimmer, an open source project hosted on GitHub.\nIt is currently actively developped and provides slidebars for each of your monitor (internal and external):\n\nI just tried it on El Capitan but it works only on one space per monitor (which can be a huge limitation).\nAccording to its home page, it is compatible until Sierra.\n\nA: My recommendation is a hitherto-little known gem, called ScreenShade.\nThere are several decent Mac software screen dimmers out there, of which I've found the ones whose dimming method is to apply an increasingly opaque black 'overlay' over the screen to be the most superior in appearance (providing much higher quality 'low blacks' than Shades which does its dimming via color profile/gamma level tweaking) and in doing so, also playing nice with famous color temperature regulating app, f.lux.\nThe best examples in this group, are Shady (whose development has been abandoned by its dev and has a no better rogue clone in the Mac App Store), ScreenDimmer, Screen Shade, and Work at Night. (N.b. these last two, confusingly appear to be clones, by the same dev on the Mac App Store.)\nBut if you're looking to more fully emulate the Mac's in-built hardware dimming in software, you're looking for an app that can have the dimming triggered via hotkeys, system-wide.\nAnnoyingly, none of the just-listed quality 'overlay method' apps actually provide keyboard shortcuts (at present).\nSo for all the above criteria AND having keyboard shortcuts, the only one I have found is the humble Softonic-hosted ScreenShade, est. 2008!\n\nIt's working on Yosemite 10.10 no problem, and has a decent little preferences window including even customisable support for multiple/secondary monitors! Its only drawback, is that the hotkeys' granularity in dimming up and down is a little less than one would ideally want (i.e. the jumps are fairly large), but this is a small concession given it at least provides hotkeys, and it does go down to very low levels (with fairly good clarity), all the same.\nSo until contenders like ScreenDimmer, Shady, or Screen Shade / Work at Night do anything about it, if you want something with hotkeys and simultaneous operation with f.lux (and to do it in software), this looks to be only app that can do it.\n\nA: Many of these answers seem rather old,  https://joshjon.github.io/nocturnal/ is one I've found that be up to date and also open source.\nFeatures include dimming, night shift, and disabling the touch bar for the newer macs.\n\nA: Another application for decreasing brightness is Shady. But like Shades, it just draws an overlay over the screen and doesn't actually turn down the backlight.\nLCDs require a similar amount of energy to display bright and dark pixels, and some LCDs actually require slightly more energy to display dark pixels, so Shady and Shades might even increase energy use.\nThere is a small Objective-C utility (https://github.com/nriley/brightness/) for changing the brightness of displays, but it cannot set the brightess below the normal minimum value either.\n\nA: Discovered a better solution by modifying system kexts that doesn't rely on 3rd party apps and actually lowers the actual lcd brightness levels.\nDISCLAIMER: Modifying kexts has risks and can mess up your mac. I am not to be held responsible if your your OS breaks. \nI used Xcode to change the data for my lcd panel in AppleBacklight.kext/Contents/Info.plist. \nIn my MacBook Pro 13\" 2011, the panel data is in IOKitPersonalities > AppleIntelPanelA > ApplePanels. There is a string of hexadecimal values for each panel ID, e.g. my panel is 9cc5, which shows up as F10T9cc5 and the values are \n<00110000 00210029 00340042 00530069 008700ac 00d30103 013e0187 01e20252 02de038f>. (Your panel ID can be found by going to System Preferences > Displays > Color > Open Profile > mmod).\nThe lowest brightness starts from the second pair of hex values (0021). In this example the second step is 0029 then 0034 and so forth, up to the max value of 0x38 (038f).\nYou can change that string to get a wider range of brightness, e.g.:\n<00110000 00100015 00250034 00490060 008000ac 00d30103 013e0187 01e20252 02de0710>\n\nAfter setting the values fix permissions and rebuild cache (you can use terminal or Disk Utility to Fix permissions and DCPIManager to rebuild cache).\nMake sure to allow OSX to load the modified (unsigned) kext by entering this in Terminal:\nsudo nvram boot-args=kext-dev-mode=1\n\n\nNote: the 0710 at the end of the data is the maximum brightness\n  allowed by my HD3000, meaning my color control can go much darker and\n  brighter than stock. I also want to point out that the values are\n  given above are not linear at all, I'm too lazy to work on the steps\n  right now. But the idea is to get your desired minimum and maximum values\n  and enter the proper values in between if you want a smooth\n  transition.\n\n\nA: If you are doing a lot of typing, and not working with photos or videos, etc you could always use the color reversal trick. Just press control+option+⌘+8, and all the colors on the screen will be totally reversed. No more white screen; black instead. Much easier on the eyes.\n\nA: I'd like to call attention to the f.lux program, which basically decreases brightness as it gets \"toward bedtime\" by removing blue light from the monitor.  It helped me be able to see my screen at night without as much pain, since just removing the blue light has a dimming effect, and it kicks in at bed time which is when I need/want it most.\nYou can also make it \"dimmer\" via flux menu -> preferences -> drag the top slider to the left more.  It won't get totally black (kind of a washed out red'ish) but it will be dimmer which may be easier on the eyes, i.e. easy enough.\nYou can accomplish similar functionality using the built-in mac \"night shift\" option (preferences -> displays -> night shift tab) (though flux seems more customizable somehow, like it can make it darker).\nI also did find a free one that works with only one monitor (\"Brightness Slider\" on the app store).\n\nA: None of the apps got the screen totally black.\nNeither id using the F1 Mac screen brightness.\nBut using BOTH DO!\nYea\n\nA: I only know how to lower the brightness at its lowest by the way you already mentioned on your post and just like you, it's not enough. My alternative when I work late at night is an app called Candlelight and I fairly enjoy it! It's not a free app but it's just about $1 to help your eyesight on the long run! \n\nA: The best one that I've found, after a lot of searching, is Brightness Control:\nhttps://www.splasm.com/brightnesscontrol/index.html\nIt's really small, free, simple to use, and the only one that reduces the brightness of the mouse cursor.\n", "Q: How to unload kernel modules When I run kextstat, it gives me a list of the currently loaded kernel modules. How to I go about using the information gathered from this command to unload a kernel module?\n\nA: You can unload kernel modules with kextunload either specifying the whole path to the kernel extension as a parameter (they reside in /System/Library/Extensions/) or by specifying the bundle identifier displayed by kextstat, e.g. if you want to unload Fuse for OS X:\nsudo kextunload -b com.github.osxfuse.filesystems.osxfusefs\n\nYou can then use kextload for loading extension in the same way.\nBonus hint: If you only want to see 3rd party kernel extensions that aren’t from Apple you can use inverse grep:\nkextstat | grep -v com.apple\n\n", "Q: Mac OSX and enabling user root All I am running OSX 10.6.8 I have enabled root login through Directory Utility.

Since you are not connecting remotely in your example, I recommend:\nsudo su\n\nto switch to root user if you need to run several commands in a row.  This keeps you from needing to do the much safer\nsudo commandname\n\nwhere you need to prefix every command with sudo. If ssh is a requirement, you can simply:\nssh user@host\n\nand then\nsudo su\n\nto switch to root user. This is a much safer approach from a security standpoint. \nLastly, if you really think you must enable root login over ssh, see this link for instructions.\n", "Q: How do I switch first/last name order in the iOS address book?

When the external display is auto-detected, the resolution is set up as 800x600.\nI have tried using two different mini DisplayPort to VGA connectors and separate VGA cable to rule out the connector/cable issue. The monitors work fine as I have been using them with Windows 8 and they work perfectly fine (all autodectected).\nMy monitor's native resolution is 1680x1050 at 60Hz. \n\nA: The issue is probably the VGA adapter (not faulty; just not capable of that high a resolution).  I think you need a DVI adapter to get the higher resolutions.\n", "Q: WiFi internet sharing from iMac unreliable I want to share an internet connection that my iMac gets via Ethernet over WiFi, so that I can connect to it with other devices.\nI went into System Preferences > Sharing > Internet Sharing on the iMac and turned it on for sharing Ethernet over WiFi, but I'm finding it unreliable.\nParticularly, the internet connection of devices connected to the WiFi created by the iMac seem to randomly die, even though the iMac still connects to the internet just fine. Note that the WiFi created by the iMac itself is always visible, it just doesn't seem to provide access to the internet after a while, even though it should, since the iMac sharing the connection can access the internet just fine.\nWhat could be wrong?\n\nA: From my own experience Internet Sharing is not, and has never been, as reliable as it should. Connection coming back and forth is a usual behavior of the service, heavily depending on the usage of the machine which is sharing the internet connection.\nApparently, updating to 10.7.4 makes things even worse. \n\nA: This doesn't exactly answer the question but it did fix my problem.\nI simply used the Connectify Widows program instead, which works SO MUCH BETTER. I've been using it for about a week now without a single glitch.\n\nA: I have this same problem of reliably sharing an ethernet connection. This is 10.12.6, but this behavior has been the same through several system upgrades. The \"arrow\" wifi icon will revert to the light gray bars and the wifi signal stops connecting. One partial fix I found was to change the wifi channel to try a less crowded radio space. This helped for a while on 2.4 GHz, but seems better broadcasting at 5 GHz. Still turns off intermittently though, just not as bad. Perhaps the issue has to do with interference?\n", "Q: Host name change notification from System Administrator root@server.com Our Mac OSX servers sends me this message every day:\nName: System Administrator\nEmail: root@server.SERVER.nl\nDept: Support\n\nThe host name of SERVER1 has changed to SERVER2.

What does it mean, and what could I do to solve this (get rid of this message). The server seems to work just fine, just as it did before.\n\nA: I was having the same problem & found this thread on Apple Support Communities.\nThe short of it is that unless the name change is done through the command line with sudo changeip, it will forever complain about the change. The command goes like this:\nsudo changeip OLDIPADDRESS NEWIPADDRESS OLDNAME NEWNAME\n\nUse the same IP address and name in both spots and it's happy.\n\nA: If your hostname changes regularly, you can suppress the notifications by opening Server.app, going to Alerts → Delivery and disabling the Network Configuration alert (for Email and/or Push).\n\n\nA: Shutting off the Network Configuration (change) alert is the equivalent of putting electrical tape over the \"Check Engine\" indicator on your car. You are simply ignoring a an important warning.\nChanging the IP address or the hostname on OS X server has always been a bad idea. Both are foundational to Open Directory working properly, just for one important example. The hostname gets \"baked\" into 8-12 configuration files. Changing the hostname in one location can create a mismatch in all the other locations. So don't ever change it unless you have a really important reason! And if you must, then you should use changeip to do so.\nThe changeip command ensures that the hostname is set up properly across all locations.\n", "Q: Code-signing issue.

Usually when I use Preview, it is when I see a .jpg or .png and I double click on the file to take a look at the file, but sometimes Preview will open up all the .pdf and .png I opened previously, possibly taking up a couple hundred of MB and opening 7 or 8 windows.\nSo it is a case I hope an app will not open all previously opened files.  I know it can be done by clicking File, pressing Option, and then choosing Close All, but is there a way to tell an app not to open all previously open files such as for the case of Preview?\n\nA: In addition to the other answers you an also use Option ⌥ + Command ⌘ + Q when you close preview instead of Command-Q which will ensure that it does not remember which files it had open.\n\nA: This is part of resume. A feature introduced with Lion.\nPer default, windows are restored the next time you open the application. If you want to completly close all windows just one time, you can quit an application using ⌘+⌥+Q instead of the standard ⌘+Q to quit an application.\nUndo resume for a specific application\nType the following command in the Terminal. Then restart the specific application.\nIn general the syntax is:\ndefaults write com.\"producer\".\"program-name\" ApplePersistenceIgnoreState YES\n\nThus, in your case (Preview.app) it is:\ndefaults write com.apple.Preview ApplePersistenceIgnoreState YES\n\nIf you prefer a graphical interface, you can use TinkerTool.\nThis application gives you access to additional preference settings and allows to activate hidden features in the operating system.\n\nUndo resume for all applications\nIn order to disable this for all applications do this:\ngo to System Preferences->General->Restore windows when quitting...\n\nA: One way is to use the old adage, leave it as you expect to find it!\nIf you have several windows open when you close it, then those windows will open next time.  If you close the windows before you close the app, then next time you should have no windows.\nSo, if you are using Command ⌘ + Q to quit the app with open windows, try using Command ⌘ + W before doing so to closing the currently open windows.\nOther than that you are just seeing the normal \"resume\" features at work.\n\nA: If you want to DISABLE restore for a particular application, you can close all open documents for a program, quit the program, then go to ~/Library/Saved Application State/«app name», Get Info, and lock the folder.\nThis could work to preserve the state of \"no windows open\", or, as a bonus, you could use this to preserve any other window state that you always want to launch into.\n", "Q: Disable Mail notifications on a per account basis In the iOS Mail app I have two accounts configured.\nIt is possibile to have notifications (banner and sounds) turned on only for one of the two accounts, or the setting in Notification under Settings is global for all the accounts? \nI'm using an iPhone 4 with the latest version of iOS 5.\n\nA: You can't do that, but you can set the Mail account you don't need to be notified to only fetch new mail when you open the app.\nGo to Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars > Fetch New Data > Advanced and change the schedule to Manual.\n\nA: This is possible with iOS 6.

Is there a way for me to merge them into a single Apple ID?\nApple IDs cannot be merged. You should use your preferred Apple ID from now on, but you can still access your purchased items such as music, movies, or software using your other Apple IDs.\n\nA: I suspect it goes like this:\nYou can change your iTunes account ID, and still use the apps you loaded with your original account. You may have to swap back to your original ID to update the apps you bought using it. This means you can aggregate apps from different iTunes accounts to one iPad, say.\nYou can have two ( or possibly more) iCloud accounts (mail, calendar, address book, notes, etc) on one iDevice. These will live side by side and you can view either only one account's data, or all of the accounts' data at the same time.\nThese two types of account are independent, so changing one will not change the other.\n", "Q: Trying to get things clear with iPod touch 3rd Gen 8GB MC model Well, I'm kind of new to this support communities as this is my first time to make a discussion here.\nSo, as most of all iDevice users knew that a late-2009 iPod touch 2nd gen 8GB MC model was referred by stores as the 3rd Gen 8GB.\nAfter all these years, I've finally had time to solve the issue a few weeks ago. I bought the unit on April 2010 which was claimed by a guy from the authorised reseller at my location as the newest 3rd Gen iPod touch. At that time, I trusted this guy (salesman) and start to use the unit throughout the years and finally I got stuck on iOS 4.2.1.\nLater on, I thought that probably Apple hadn't release the 4.3 version for the iPod touch 3rd Gen, so I waited dumbly until the release of iOS 5.1.1. Recently, I brought my unit back to the same store, trying to find out why did the store misleaded me.\nAnother guy from the store explained to me that before June 2010, they didn't know from Apple that iPod touch 8GB MC was different from its siblings with greater capacity. They only knew it officially from Apple in June 2010. He also stated that the official basis from Apple for the store to compare between iPod touch 3rd Gen 8GB and the 2nd Gen was the MC and MB numbers, not the A12XX and A13XX (in apple support webpage).\nSo I want to ask anybody who knows the real thing behind these statements.\n\n\n*\n\n*Did Apple made the statement that the MC model would be different with the 32 & 64 GB models since the launching in late 2009 (I really mean at that time in September 2009 until the June 2010)?\n\n\nIf there was another time when they officially announced that the MC model would be different, please give me the date (this is an important fact to me).\n\n\n*\n\n*Is the official comparison basis from Apple to distinguish between iPod touch generation  is true (The MC and MB numbers), or did that guy lied to me again ?\n\n\nIf there was another official way such as in http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1353, should all Apple authorized reseller use this page as their basis ?\n\n\n*\n\n*When did this page released with the inclusion of the late 2009 iPod touch lineup ?\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT1353#iPod_touch_late2009\nI really need any truth that would help me to understand things. Thanks in advance (I really thank everyone for answering my questions truthfully :) )\n\nA: Since I was once working as salesman in an Authorized Reseller in Australia, let me enlighten the essential parts :\nApple had implicitly mentioned in the press release that the MC model would not have the same spec as its sibling, which means the MC model is not the same with the 3rd Gen model.\nSo what is a MC model ?\nMC model is a 2nd Gen iPod with a modified bootrom so it was meant to be UN-jailbreakable. But as you see, maniacs out there were able to jailbreak it too (this really bugs me). You may notice that the MC and MB models are quite different but they were the same since both of them were A1288 iPods.\nSince the time when Apple made the press release, many stores advertise the MC model as the 3rd Gen. This is absolutely wrong ! Although my store didn't notice about the differences until iOS 4 was released, we took the liberty of advertising it as The New iPod Touch 2G 8GB in February 2010. Actually, Apple ever advertised in fine text that iPod touch 8GB won't support all features on iOS 4 in March 2010. The salesman at your store should've told you this before.\nAbout the method, well, beats me. Most stores have their own way to distinguish such as the part number (MCXXXX and MBXXXX), however since part numbers are different in every sales region, Apple used a more common way which is the model number as shown in http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1353#iPod_touch_late2009. However, you won't be able to check the model number unless you buy the iPod, opened the case, and use a magnifier on its backpanel. A lot of online websites made profit from this thing, since people bought the product and they complained 6-12 months later (assuming the purchase was done in late 2009 - early 2010), and they were terribly dissapointed.\nIf you carefully notice that the link in the webpage for the 4th Gen iPods was HT1353#iPod_4G while for the 3rd Gen iPods was HT1353#iPod_touch_late2009. See Apple designated the iPod touch which was released in 09/2009 (at the same time with the press release) only in 32GB & 64GB capacity. So what is the designation for the 8GB ones ?\nThey were just iPod Touch 2G 8GB - MC model, any other name for this iPod would be considered unlikely to be accurate.\nThe store where I worked once also experienced the same problem back in May 2011 where users who bought the product before our new advertising was launched. Well, we apologized because it was my store's mistake and told the customers why wouldn't they bring the problem back to us earlier ?. Well, that's not the important thing (as long as the customers were happy, it was enough for me). The customers demand the true iPod touch 3G 8GB in exchange for their old The New iPod Touch 2G 8GB. But there was no such thing called iPod Touch 3G 8GB, so we made a deal with them. We let them keep their iPods and offered them the new iPod 4G 8GB for only A$49 (about 20% of normal price at that time). since there wasn't a 3G 8GB. Fortunately, there were only 3 customers at the time and we revoke one of them because the iPod unit wasn't functional. They accepted the deal and we sold 2 iPod Touch 4G 8GB for A$98.\nNow since you would likely to demand compensation from your local Authorised reseller, tell them how we settle things here in Australia. Your local store might've misled you when buying your product, so you have the right to demand compensation even it's been 2,5 years since the released of the iPod touch 3G. I think that refund might be an overdo since it's been quite some time, so I suggest you demand for 80% discount for purchasing the new iPod touch too :).\n\nA: I see that both of us may have a similar problem. Let me tell you my own story :\nI brought this problem back in January 2012 to my local Apple Authorized store. They played dumb (I guessed) with me and insisting that the product was indeed a 3rd Gen 8GB iPod. I didn't have any proof at that time, so I went to Apple support website and asked some guys there. Several days later, I came back to the Authorized store and presented them with the evidences. Finally they admitted it and they gave me a free iPod touch 4th Gen 8GB White :) in return of my effort (but they still let me keep the bogus 3rd Gen as a mementos). They also admitted that there were some false advertising everywhere around the world but Apple never made an official statement for the problem. So I think this is a strict consumer-store issue.\nI see that you have 3 questions to support your position, I'll try to answer it as simple as possible.\n\n\n*\n\n*From the press release, well, Apple never stated anything about MC model, you may look into this page : http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2009/09/09Apple-Introduces-New-iPod-touch-Lineup.html\nIt was also stated in Pricing and Availability that all three of them were considered new iPod models NOT 3RD GEN MODELS. If your local store advertised that the MC model as the 3rd Gen model, they were wrong. \nHowever, specifically speaking, Apple did mention in the press release that the 32 GB and the 64 GB model was 50% faster (from the 8GB model, so this should gave you a clue that the 8GB model would be somehow weaker than its siblings). If the store told you that they were the same even before the release of iOS 4, the store might be lying. I don't know if the guy at your store is a fool or what, but I think that by letting you know that the 32 GB version is stronger than the 8GB one, the store might have gained more profit by selling you the 32GB instead of the 8GB one.\nYour local authorized reseller should've known the fact since the time of the release. But it's possible that your store didn't read carefully the press release which ended up misleading customers. (It's not their fault 100%, but they were still guilty)\n\n\n*\n\n*I don't know what kind of method they used since all 4th Gen iPod is a MC model (so how does they distinguish 3rd Gen and 4th Gen ?) But a legal and official way to distinguish between generations is indeed the http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1353. Otherwise, according to my local authorized reseller, it's wrong or not official.\n\n\nIf you look at the back of the casing, you should see A1288 on your iPod. But on the true 3rd Gen, A1318 was printed. There was no way to find out this number unless you opened the case and see the unit for yourself.\nIf they were a Authorized reseller, why wouldn't they use an Authorized system as depicted in support.apple.com ? Even my local store use the support website as references in order to let customers and the store communicate in the same frequency. You should clarify that your local store is indeed an Authorized or not.\n\n\n*\n\n*When I asked the my local store, they claimed it to be updated several hours after the press released. Although I'm not so sure about this fact, I guessed that Apple should have updated the page within 6 months of the release (I bought the unit in February 2010). As you can see in the address, Apple did not write the link as HT1353#iPod_touch_3G as in HT1353#iPod_touch_4G but rather as HT1353#iPod_touch_late2009 (see that apple designate the 3rd Gen as the iPod touch late 2009). What my local store explained that Apple only released 3rd Gen or the late 2009 model in 32 & 64 GB (the MC model has its own classification). This is the root of our problems, many stores (especially the non-authorized ones), classified the MC model as the 3rd Gen model.\n\n\nFinally, the MC model is indeed a MC model (it's neither 2nd Gen nor 3rd Gen). Should the authorized store claimed it to be a 3rd Gen, they were totally wrong. They should advertise it as Refurbished 2nd Gen 8GB or as what some sellers at amazon did : \"3rd Gen 8GB MC model (OLD MODEL). I guess the OLD MODEL designation was used because in the press release, \"The 8GB iPod touch is now available for just $199, along with new models which deliver twice the capacity for the same price, with the iPod touch 32GB model for $299 and 64GB model for $399\". New model designation is given only to the 32GB and 64 GB while the 8GB excluded from the designation.\nSummary :\nI'm sorry that my answers weren't as simple as it would be, but I thought that it'd be great to help someone else with the same trouble. Go to your Authorized reseller again and show them these evidences. I guess that they might realized that they were wrong and I hope you might as well get your own 4th Gen iPod (you might wanted a full-fledged iPod from the date of the purchase, not the one which has been expired.)\nHope it helps :).\n\nA: I don't know what you're about to do with the your local reseller, but I got into the same hole. I guess what you're asking if your local store gave you fraudulent information, isn't it ?\nI bought the same iPod 3rd Gen 8GB from my local premium reseller for US$199 at January 2010. The premium reseller advertise this as a ipod touch 3G with MC086XX part number. They convinced me that this is a real 3G iPod because it has MC written on it. But I knew from the http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1353#iPod_touch_late2009, only 32&64GB ipod were released. So I asked for their supervisor to clarify the product.\nThe supervisor came and explained to me that recently Apple released ipod 3G 8GB and she claimed that all three models will be having the same features. Then I purchased the unit and used it for 6 months until the release of iOS 4. It was a great disappointment in me when the multitasking didn't work on the ipod.\nThen, I brought it back to premium reseller. The same supervisor came to me and explained that the premium reseller didn't know anything about it and put her blame onto Apple and me for not looking into the net for more info. But in the end, they offered me free iPod 4G similar capacity as Apple never gave off official refund for products.\nWant to know what I did to convince them ?\nI showed them the apple support web and I checked the serial number in front of the supervisor and then she admitted that the premium reseller had wrongly advertised the product. Furthermore, I showed her http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1353#iPod_touch_late2009 and then she admitted that the model number is the official and reliable way to distinguish iPod touch's generation.\nI might not be directly answering your questions, but I guess this is what you should tell to your local store if they did sold you a 2G iPod MC model but advertising it as a 3G iPod. So right now I got 2 iPods, one the 4G and I still keep the 2G to let me remember how a Premium Reseller ever misled a customer. \nOne other thing you should know. Currently, this is a worldwide issue which means there are a lot of misled customer who purchased iPod 3G MC086XX because they were told it was a new 3G iPod but still it wasn't. Actually, I preferred that this product was advertised by New 2G MC iPod. Well, Apple, your guys at marketing should do better at advertising.\nThe point is why would an Authorized reseller made a wrong advertisements and statements or even misled by itself ? Did Apple itself didn't make things clear with its reseller ? \nSince I can't answer those myself, I recommended that you shouldn't push your local reseller to much by asking for refund (Apple never authorized any refund) but rather ask for iPod 4G compensation. I agreed with Badboyz31's 80% discount, but getting the iPod for free might be better. \nGood luck\n\nA: Wow, there's actually a discussion here. My brother was the one who had the unit but now he already get a 4th generation unit. I accompanied my mother to an authorized store in Thailand, January 2010. My mother wanted to buy an iPod as a present for my big brother who just finished studying abroad back in December 2010 (I was 14 at that time).\nWe went to the store and a seller there showed me a brochure. There was 8GB/32GB/64GB capacity under iPod touch 3rd Generation. My mom bought the 8GB version considering that the price was the cheapest of all and the seller guaranteed that all 3 versions were different only in the manner of capacity. After the purchase, the seller offered us to register the product in apple website directly under my mother's name. \nNow, strange thing happened, when the seller put in the serial number, the apple website showed that my Apple was a 2nd generation unit. Unfortunately, my mother didn't realized what was happening. But I asked the seller, how was that possible ? The seller assured us that since 3rd generation was just launched, the 3rd generation name wasn't used yet. We trusted his words and received the unit back. Then the iPod become my brother's.\nHe used the ipod comfortably until the release of iOS 5 in 2011. He was confused why would his ipod won't update to iOS 5. So he brought the unit back to the same authorized reseller (again accompanied by me). Another seller came to us and my brother explain his problem. The seller immediately identified the ipod as a 2nd generation MC unit. My brother was surprised to hear that and asked why did they said the unit was a 3rd generation one. The seller explained to us that they didn't know that ipod touch 8Gb 2nd generation would be re-released and as you all might expected, a lot of people bought the wrong model, believing that the 2nd gen MC unit was indeed a 3rd Gen unit.\nSince the seller acknowledged that it was partially the marketing mistake, he asked his manager to talk with us. My brother again explained to the manager what was going on. The manager said that, in the press release, apple never said that the new ipod released was indeed the 3rd gen. The 3rd gen naming only came out on apple support page. He also didn't know why would apple only release 32&64GB 3rd generation ipod.\nI asked the manager immediately, \"Sir, is there any compensation for us, since your store has sold us a product that wasn't what we were asking for ?\"\nHe said that he would discuss the matter with his superior and took our unit for inspection. 2 weeks later, the manager email-ed my brother to come to the store and took back his ipod unit. After receiving back the ipod, the manager said that there wasn't anything they could do since Apple too told them conflicting stories.\nApple even accused us for not knowing that there was a statement in the press release that the sentence \"The 8GB iPod touch is now available for just $199, along with new models which deliver twice the capacity for the same price, with the iPod touch 32GB model for $299 and 64GB model for $399\" means that the new model were intended for 32 & 64 GB only (they were really new since the 2nd generation 16&32GB were improved with twice the capacity). Also in the sentence \"The 32GB and 64GB models also include up to 50 percent faster performance and support for even better graphics with OpenGL ES 2.0\" also indicates that the 8GB model was intended to be different from the 32&64 GB models.\nThen, the manager apologized for not knowing the matter and granted my brother a complimentary 4th gen 8Gb ipod. Hope this helps you too.\n\nA: I've just resolved this matter 3 weeks ago with a local premium reseller in KL, Malaysia. The guys there were great because they still took my matter into their account. In December 2009 they didn't advertised the 2G iPod MC model as a 3G iPod 8GB model but as a New ipod. It's logical to think 2G MC model is a newest 8GB at that time, but the problem came when a marketing guy who sold the ipod to me misinterpreted the meaning. For your information, I bought the ipod in March 2010 at the same reseller but I noticed the product to be wrong in June 2011.\nBasically after a 2G ipod, 3G came out isn't it ?\nBut it wasn't, a quick serial number type-in at apple website shows that MC086 is definitely a 2G ipod, hence, it had to be advertised as such. \nThis is what I dislike from Apple, for every press release, it didn't explain what kind of product they were releasing. I think Apple loves fine texts too, because almost all proves which tell how a 8GB MC model was different from its brothers. And this point was missed by a lot of authorized and premium reseller.\nJonathan, you should know that maybe it wasn't the store's fault for selling you the wrong product but rather a marketing guy's misinterpretation when he was selling you the product. I don't care if the store DID KNOW THE FACT OR NOT, BUT a MAN's FAULt IN REPRESENTING HIS STORE IS PUNISHABLE BY HEAVY COMPENSATION.\nI was fortunate to have quick responses from my local premium reseller since they acknowledged their mistake and offered me free 8GB ipod touch 4G white edition with the purchase of a ipod touch 4G case. It's still fair considering that the true usage of ipod 2G officially died with the release of iOS 4.2.1 so the users only have 8 months of full usage before it ran out of apple support.\n\nA: 1). Things should be as clear as quoted by L0n3Sheep :\n\"The 8GB iPod touch is now available for just $199, along with new models which deliver twice the capacity for the same price, with the iPod touch 32GB model for $299 and 64GB model for $399\" means that the new model were intended for 32 & 64 GB only (they were really new since the 2nd generation 16&32GB were improved with twice the capacity). Also in the sentence \"The 32GB and 64GB models also include up to 50 percent faster performance and support for even better graphics with OpenGL ES 2.0\" also indicates that the 8GB model was intended to be different from the 32&64 GB models. \nI believed that many stores have no idea in what way a 8GB model would be different \"under the hood\", but they should've figured out the \"difference in performance\" as mentioned earlier.\n2). Yes, when I called 1-800-APL-CARE, that's what apple said. If other Authorized stores used part number, they should take full responsibility for misleading a customer.\nOnly buy Apple product directly from an authorized reseller to be assured. \n3). Only apple that would be able to answer that question. But i guessed it should've been there quite a long time. For your information, iPod 4G were included there almost instantly after the release.\nMy personal advice : demand a compensation from the store since it has misled you, a free or huge discount (75%-95%) should be fair enough.\n", "Q: Mac support for Blu-Ray I would like to buy an external Blu-Ray drive. I have a specific model in mind (the LG CP40NG10), but I'm open to suggestions if anybody has a different one they recommend.\nThe documentation says that it has \"Mac support: Yes (DVD)\", but does this imply that it has Blu-Ray support on Macs?

I currently have iTunes set to sync all unplayed episodes of all podcasts to my iPhone.  (I'm a bit behind - there are nearly 70 of them.)  Today I downloaded Apple's new Podcasts app, and was pleased to find that it \"picked up\" the podcasts that were already on the iPhone.  I have listened to a few podcasts today, and just now synced to my Mac (twice).  I was disappointed to find that the podcasts I had listened to were not marked as played, either in iTunes on the Mac, or in the stock Music app, and therefore not removed from the phone.\nI can't seem to find any settings for the Podcasts app - either in the app or in the Settings app - that might affect this behaviour.  Is there anything I can do to make the Podcasts app update the played status in the Music app or in iTunes without manually marking them as played or scrubbing through them?\n\nA: I upgraded to iOS 6 yesterday, and it seems that this has been resolved itself, either through updates to iTunes or Podcasts.app (or both).\nWhen I sync with my Mac, the podcasts I had listened to in Podcasts.app were correctly marked as played in iTunes.

I've seen that on one of these new MacBook Pros.\nHowever, having very good eyes myself, I was wondering how small one could set the font size in an editor. I quickly tried this in TextEdit, simply loading some big text file and changing all the text to a font size of 4pt, which was too small to be comfortable, then 5pt which was already much better (remember, this equals the amount of pixels of a 10pt font size on a non-HiDPI setup).\nThis of course is not the way to go, since these font sizes stay with the document and would look just as small on any other display, even though it might not be one with enough resolution to show it in a readable way.\nNow, code editor windows are another thing entirely. They don't store the font size, as the code is not something that is for print. Its just letters in a file and the font size is a preference in the editor and set up to accustom the user. So this would be an excellent way to really leverage the incredible resolution and just reduce the font size, in for example Xcode, to get a huge amount of lines of text out of the 15\" display.\nI'm not talking about the 1920x1200 scaled resolution that Mac OS X offers, as I've seen that already, it looks ok, but still not really sharp. To achive this scaling the screen gets rendered at 1920x1200 HiDPI mode, equal to 3840x2400 pixels and then downscaled to 2880x1800 pixels, making it quite slow.\n\nSo, I'd like someone with the Retina MacBook Pro to take a screenshot of Xcode or Coda or any other Retina aware Editor that is focused on writing text or code that is not intended as Rich Text. And to do so like I imagined, reducing the font size for the main text/code editing component. Be sure to also show enough text to sufficiently fill it up with text, in order to be able to judge the gain.\nIn Xcode you can do this like follows:\n\n*\n\n*Open Xcode\n\n*Go to Preferences --> Fonts\n\n*Duplicate \"Default\" theme\n\n*Change all the Source Editor font options (you can use Cmd+A) on the right to Menlo 6pt or 7pt.\n\nAdditionally I'd also like a screenshot of the same Application with normal font sizes but using the full 2880x1800 resolution. You can turn that on using SetResX from http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/vi9yf/set_your_retina_macbook_pros_resolution_to/\nPost full sized screenshots, please.\n\nA: It is impossible to deliver an \"answer\" to this question. You are asking for something that is purely opinion-based. I have friends who use super small fonts and it's very comfortable for them. I also have friends who use larger fonts, and that works best for them. I personally use a variety of font sizes depending on what Mac I am on and what App I'm using. Your best best is to work with whatever font size suits you, despite what anybody else tells you.\nThere is no \"one-size-fits-all\" answer to your question.\n", "Q: Which versions of Xcode are not updated to take advantage of HiDPI/Retina displays? I've been looking over the release notes for Xcode and can't find one that says it's been enabled for HiDPI mode and the retina display MacBook Pro.

Most notably the little \"LCD\" screen that sits in the top middle of the toolbar, it looks quite blurry on a retina MBP.

I am using OS X 10.5.8 and in spite of having 5GB of RAM memory, I face a lot of inactive RAM, and go to the terminal and purge it via the \"purge\" command (of course without quotes).\nI do this almost every two days, some application(s) is(are) probably not freeing up memory.\nI would like to know if this command is harmfull/if it can \"damage\" anything in the system/in open applications?\n\nA: No harm will come to your system through using the purge command. The purge command clears out pages which have been written to memory which the system thinks it may need again. Usage of purge can cause some applications to temporarily run slowly if resources need to be reloaded.\nFrom the purge man page for Xcode 3.2.5:\n\nDESCRIPTION\nPurge can be used to approximate initial boot conditions with a cold disk buffer cache for performance analysis. It does not affect anonymous memory that has been allocated through malloc, vm_allocate, etc.\n\n", "Q: Faulty 2006 iMac - what is it useful for? I own a 2006 iMac, which, alas, has a known manufacturing fault. Because of the poorly-designed cooling system, the graphics card (soldered to the motherboard) has become defective and the system shuts down spontaneously minutes or seconds after being turned on.\nI have used a different computer for three years and I have really no need of this iMac at the moment.\nHowever, I'd like know if I can nevertheless do something with it. It has a processor, lots of RAM, and a good hard disk. Can I use its computational power and its hard drive without employing the graphics card? I'd like the idea of turning it into a file server and being able to run non-graphical programs in it. The best would be being able to run X11 programs in it and see their graphics on another computer.\nEverytime I turn the computer on it only worsens the problem, damaging the graphic card even more. So far, it didn't shut down when I put it in \"single user mode\", but I am afraid that even this little workload could damage the graphics card more and more. Basically I do not want to use the graphics card at all. I am prepared even to install a different operating system. (But how would I do so when the computer keeps shutting down?)\nEdit: The problem is also reported in this petiton\n\nA: Recycle or sell it for parts. Since the GPU is soldered, you likely cannot bypass the temperature sensors that the system monitors to ensure safe operation with consumer skills at soldering. Have you looked into a logic board repair or buying a Mac with a shattered screen at low cost to assemble one workable Mac?\nOperating a machine where you know the protection mechanisms are shutting it down to prevent overheating and persist in doing so, being frugal crosses a line into taking risks with fire if you don't go to great lengths to protect yourself and other property nearby.\nAlso - your characterization of design flaws seems unsupported with one link to a 540 entry discussion thread.

So I'm a semi-new Mac user (loving it btw), but one thing I'm finding super annoying is that when I hit the \"+\" to maximize/minimize windows it doesn't behave like I think it should.\nI see many threads on here about windows but what I am looking for is some level of consistency about how to minimize/maximize them.\nFor example, if my monitor is 1920x1080, and I manually sized the window to 800x600 and then I want to maximize the window so I can see more, I'll hit the \"+\" button to maximize and one of the following happens:\n\n\n*\n\n*Instead of the window maximizing to full screen (e.g., 1920x1080) it will ONLY maximize vertically, so if the window was 800x600 when I press the \"+\" button, it'll maximize to 800x1080 (it maximized from top to bottom but not left to right).\n\n*Sometimes, if the window is already maximized, when I hit the \"+\" to un-maximize it, it doesnt do anything; it just stays maximized.\n\n*And, sometimes, it behaves like Windows does and takes full width/height after pressing the \"+\" button. \n\n\nIt becomes annoying because I'm working on a 13\" MacBook Pro and an external 23\" monitor at 1920x1080 that I use at work. When I want to bring a window over from the 23\" monitor to the 13\", I have to always manually re-size things.\nHow can I make the maximize button behave in a predictable way no matter what Application I'm using? Even better if that predictable way matches the way Windows does it.\n\nA: If you want it to behave like Windows, the only real answer is to simply use Windows.  I know that sounds flippant, but you cannot use one operating system and expect to be able to pick and choose it's behaviour based on your personal preferences of other systems.\nThe maximise paradigm simply doesn't work on Macs, where the ideal is that the function is to set the window size to best fit the content rather than the screen.  The point being that the content is what is important, and that stays the same regardless of if you are on a 11\" laptop screen or a 27\" desktop behemoth.  Now we all know that this isn't always properly implemented, but we also know that it is the developers prerogative to do the implementation, it's not a failing in the OS, and given a choice of \"one size fits all full screen\" that always does the same thing, or intelligent (when the developer adds it) maximising to meet the needs of the content, then I prefer the existing system.\nIf maximise as per the Windows system makes sense for a given app (bearing in mind that for many, I would say most, it simply does not), then you really want to be looking into the Full Screen options that are provided from Lion onwards, which are further improved upon in Mountain Lion for external displays etc, as this will provide you with exactly what you need, you just have to use another icon.  If your app does not support this yet, then there are a number of workarounds like this one for the time being.\n\nA: It is easy to see why many users coming from Windows think that the green button means 'maximize' versus how it actually works on the Mac. On the Mac, this is called Zoom. This is actually a carry-over from the Classic Mac OS, closer to the button on the top right of a window starting around Mac OS 7. \nThis also doesn't work with the menu structure in the Mac OS either, with how the menu bar is on the 'system' level, not per application like it is in Windows. Exactly what stuffe mentioned - the focus on the Mac has been content versus real estate. \nThis button has two features, depending on the application, content, and development:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fit the content of the window better (similar to stuffe's answer). \n\n*Switch between a user state and standard state. \n\n\nThis is somewhat like what you see in iTunes now, but it actually works two ways in iTunes. In iTunes starting with Mac OS 10.7 Lion (it may be slightly before or after), the green button now switches from the normal player to the mini player. But before that, it acted like many other applications did (and if you hold down Option and click the button, you get this feature back). Basically, the application would switch between several different possibilities:\n\n\n*\n\n*Full-screen (somewhat) - as in filling the remaining area of the screen, minus the menu bar with the window. \n\n*Reset the window to a view that the developer thought was an 'optimized' way to use the application. This may be a certain window size, snapping to the full height or width.\n\n*Switch between the standard view and a user defined resized view (for example, resize your window in Safari, click the green button, and it usually goes to the height of the screen, click it again, and it goes back to your resize - basically between 'optimized' view and 'user' view. )\n\n*A developer chosen 'other feature' view - which is like what you see now in iTunes, switching from full player to mini player. As in, completely changing the window state. \n\n\nBeing a very long time Mac user, I personally prefer this setup than the Maximize functionality in Windows. Once you know the power and actual use for it, it can actually really help ones workflow. \nThe closest you would get to the Maximize functionality in Windows would be full screen mode introduced in Lion. This is the two arrows pointing away from each other in the top right of the screen.   While it doesn't work exactly like the zoom button either in Windows (since it puts the full screen application on a different virtual screen), it is rather close, and much closer than the Zoom buttons behavior. \n\nA: Shift+green button. works for me!\n\nA: I haven't tried it my self, but there is an App called \"RightZoom\"  which runs in the background and makes the zoom button function as a maximise button (RightZoom is not available on the AppStore). There is also an App called iSnap on the AppStore which brings Areo Snap to the Mac. There are many handy tools like this that fill the gaps in the Mac experience.\n\nA: For lion and above the nearest equivalent of Windows Maximize is go to full screen.\nMany apps will have the icon at the top right to go to fullscreen.\nWindows and OSX just do window management differently and so there are no exact mappings between the behaviour on the different OSs \n\nA: Press Option(alt) key, this will turn the green button to '+' sign. \n   Many times clicking the '+' sign does not maximize the window (esp.\n   when you have two monitors).  \nTo overcome this I found this method...\nWhile keeping the Option key down click and hold on the '+' sign in\n   the window.  Now release the Option key first and then release the\n   mouse.\n\nA: Move the mouse to the corner of the window where it becomes a resizing arrow and option double click to fill the screen, WITHOUT going into full screen mode.\nMore details:\nDouble clicking on any side when the resize arrow is visible will move that side to the edge of the screen. Adding option makes it affect the opposite side as well.\n\nA: Press Opt while clicking on the green button.\n", "Q: Any way to trigger Folder Action when adding file to any subfolder? I've created a Folder Action in Automator and applied it to a folder. But it only gets triggered when a file is added to the root of that folder, not to one of its subfolders.\nIs there any way to get Folder Actions be trigger when changes occur in subfolders?\n(And, no, I do not want to apply the Action to each subfolder; they are always changing, so I need it to be dynamic.)\n\nA: You should take a look at an amazing app called Hazel, from Noodlesoft which will trigger even AppleScripts to folders.\n\nA: Without writing a full-blown Objective-C app, this is pretty difficult to do well.\nI wrote something you might be able to use a while back. Just put it up on Github here. It's a Ruby script that you should be able to use as long as you're comfortable in a shell and text editor. No Ruby knowledge required.\nIt's a bit dumb, in the sense that it just runs a shell command when a change is detected in the watched folder (or subfolders). You can use that to call an Applescript though. Should be some way to do the same for Automator workflows.\nHowever, if you depend on the input from the folder action (i.e. the files/folders that triggered the action), this won't work.\nYou could probably modify the Ruby script to catch the path of the files/folders triggering the event, and then pass that to an Applescript or Automator action, but I didn't need anything that complex, so I just hacked this together.\nGood luck.\n", "Q: Precise search inside a pdf I wanted to search inside a PDF with Adobe Acrobat Reader for MacOS (or the one built in with MacOS).

For example if it is downloading a podcast, and I try and watch something off my apple tv via home sharing on this library, it fails to load.  Same thing if it is syncing my iPhone.\nImporting new media into my library also seems to take much longer than it did before, for instance importing a 700mb movie takes ~20 hours.\nWhat can cause such a degrade in performance?\n\nA: First off, maybe you should check in Activity Monitor if it is iTunes that is the cause of the slow performance or if it is some other process that is taking up a lot of memory/CPU. \nIf it is indeed iTunes that is causing the problem, try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off iTunes Match and/or Genius as they are known to take up a lot of memory and downgrade the responsiveness and performance of iTunes. \n\n*You could rebuild your library by following the steps here (offical Apple document): http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1451. This excerpt was taken from there and is why I am recommending that you rebuild your library:\n\nYour iTunes Library file may become damaged and cause iTunes to become unresponsive.\n\n\n*I doubt this will make a huge performance difference, but you could try disabling smart playlists and reducing the number of criteria by which your sort the songs (e.g. In the music tab of iTunes, don't sort your songs by name, album, time, bitrate, artist, date-added, date-modified, etc. - only pick a couple criteria).\nI hope some of these suggestions helped you!\n", "Q: Problems connecting to WiFi Quite often my computer has trouble connecting to my home WiFi.\nSometimes once started, the computer does not find the WiFi on available networks. Sometimes it will find it, try to connect, then get \"connection timeout\" and WiFi disappears.

Any suggestions as to what could cause this?\nThe router is d-link dsl-2640r\n\nA: I had a similar problem.\nIn my case when I pulled down the airport icon it saw the connection, but would then not connect. Along the way to not connecting it would ask me to enter my password. Even after entering the proper password it would not connect.\nI finally solved the problem by going in to /Application/Utilities/Keychain Access.app and deleting my home wifi's stored password.\nThe next time I connected - it asked for the password and from that point on it has connected just fine.\n", "Q: Retina Macbook Pro: fonts look terrible I was checking out a MacBookPro with Retina display a few days ago in the mall, and I noticed something:\n\n\n*\n\n*Photos look awesome\n\n*Apple apps had super sharp text\n\n*All other apps that I tried had awful looking text (Microsoft Office, Adobe Acrobat)\n\n\nI tried running at different resolutions, but it didn't help. I did note that PDF files created in MS Word (which looked awful in MS Word) looked beautiful in Preview, so I don't think its a problem of source files.\nI'm a developer, so I'll likely be using tools like Ruby Mine, Coda, Textmate, Visual Studio in Parallels, etc. I assume vim in the terminal is going to look fine, but I didn't check.\nWhat can help with this? How can I prevent text from looking awful? It's my livelihood, so it has to work. \nNote: fellow programmers.stackexchange.com user has added this comment below:\n\ntext in the Eclipse IDE and Xcode look fine. MS Word not so much.\n\nThis came from a discussion about programming on \"high resolution screens\" that may be of good reference to anyone reading this. https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/154710/do-higher-resolution-laptop-displays-matter-for-programmers\n\nA: Apps that use Apple's APIs to draw text will have crisp text. Apps that draw the text in other ways (such as using an off-screen buffer) or render everything to an image before displaying it will have fuzzy text. \nOne mail client in particular (I believe it's Sparrow) has both crisp and fuzzy text in the same window: the email list is custom-rendered and has fuzzy text, while the message view is using a standard text component and has crisp text.\n\nA: You'll have to wait for those apps to be updated with support for the display.\nApple's updated most of theirs (though not iWork) Some third-party developers have as well, but I'd expect Microsoft and Adobe to take their time.\n\nA: The simple solution is to wait until the applications are updated.\nI have a MBPR.  I use Parallels with Visual Studio, Office, WebMatrix, and some other applications on Windows 7.  The text looks great on the max scaled display setting.  An update to parallels has been released to make things look better: http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13727_7-57470587-263/parallels-update-brings-retina-display-support/\nI was so impressed by the performance of the 2.6/16/512 that I decided to take it back for the  2.7/16/768.  Being able to swipe between VS and XCode is super convenient for when I'm developing iOS apps that talk to a ASP.NET Web API.  There is plenty of screen real estate with the scaled mode.  Personally, I do not like the \"Best for Retina\" setting, because it feels like a netbook display.\nOffice for Mac 2011 looks pretty awful, as of right now.\n\nA: Apple announced in the 2012 WWDC Keynote that applications needed to be updated to take advantage of the Retina display. Apps calling Apple text display APIs may benefit from Apple's improvements thereto without needing to be updated. Apps that use routines that had not been updated would use pixel doubling, which would make their text display using half the resolution of apps properly designed for the new machine.\nApple, naturally, has updated many of their apps, but the versions of third-party apps on the machine you tried had likely not been updated.\nThere is little you as an end user can do to make the programs render text better, but if you are using products from reputable vendors who update their products frequently, such updates should be released soon to take advantage of Apple's new HiDPI settings.\n\nA: An alternative to waiting for all your apps to update to Retina, is to use the native 2880x1800 resolution. Apps that are not updated will look fine, but text will look small. Most of the apps that have a problem with retina have zoom though so you can just zoom their display area. \nFor some annoying reason Apple has disabled the ability to use the native resolution in the Display prefs, but you can still get it pretty easily using third party tools like Quicksilver or SwicthResX - Macbook Pro Retina running at native resolution.\n", "Q: How can I see my iPad from my MacBook? Is there an easy way to see my iPad screen from my MacBook?  I have Mocha VNC Lite and I can see my MacBook from my iPad, but I want to go the other way.\n\nA: This is possible in a way, but your question might need more detail if the answer is to be useful.\nBecause Mac OS X is a fully multitasking OS, you can VNC onto it and do all your normal stuff.  iOS though is very app centric, so to do this the other way would require you to run a VNC server type app on your iPad, but you would then be stuck in that app only without the possibility of subsequently running other apps, and not be able to actually use your iPad remotely at an OS level.\nSo, if you want to see it in order to be able to interact with it, using it normally from afar, the answer is no (although there may be jailbreak tweaks that allow this sort of thing to an extent - can't really comment on that tho).\nIf, however, I was to take your question literally, you just want to see the iPad screen on your iPad, then bingo, piece of cake if you have an iPad 2/3 - you can use Airplay mirroring to mirror the output of your iPad screen on your Mac using one of a variety of airplay receiving apps on OS X.  See this answer for more details.\n", "Q: Using SD Card as external storage for Macbook Pro retina I am getting a new Macbook Pro retina display with 256GB flash storage. The capacity may be a little bit too tight, but I should be able to manage it. I am considering to get a 128GB SD card as a secondary storage. I'd store files that I do not frequently use in the SD card. It would be less bulky than an external HDD.\nI heard that different SD cards can perform very differently with the MBP, so was seeking some advice on which product has the best performance. Does anyone know what models of SD cards have the best read/write speed when used with a Macbook Pro (with or without retina)?\n\nA: SD cards are categorized in different classes according to their speed. Generally, SD cards perform even slower than a normal HDD drive which is why I do not recommend using them as a major storage option.\nYou should invest in the most expensive type of SD to have an acceptable I/O performance. E.g. an Ultra High Speed SD card (UHS) such as this one.\nFor $179 you get 128GB storage which is even more expensive than some SSDs models at that capacity. But the I/O throughput is much lower. The minimum guarantee is only 60MB/s for this particular model. SSDs in the same prize category offer up to 550MB/s of transfer speeds.\nIn sum, you're better off using an external SSD an connect it via USB 3.0 or Thunderbolt for best I/O throughput.\n\nA: It's true an SD is considerable slower then an external SSD via Thunderbolt or even USB 3.0.   But, if you're just looking for a way to keep your internal SSD free of low speed data, like say an iTunes collection or iPhoto collection, then this idea works just fine.\nYou don't even have to go crazy with UHS cards.  Most type 10 cards with do just fine and you can plug it in and forget about it. \n", "Q: Command-line arguments for \"Remote Desktop Connection for Mac\"? I haven't been able to find any documentation that would indicate this is possible, but is there any way to pass the hostname you'd like to connect to as a command-line argument to Microsoft's Remote Desktop Connection for Mac? \nSome background info for those interested:\nI'm a systems administrator, and I'm in the process of moving to a MacBook Air as my primary work computer from a Windows 7 laptop. I frequently use Remote Desktop Client to connect to servers, and in Windows, I use Launchy as my keyboard launcher. I've assigned \"rdp\" as a keyword so when I invoke Launchy, type \"rdp {tab} servername\" it passes the text after the tab key as the hostname to mstsc.exe (i.e., mstsc.exe /v:servername). This results in the remote desktop client opening a session to the hostname specified.\n\nA: I don't love CoRD. It works, but it seems to flake out periodically. I made my own CLI script for Microsoft RDP. I created a sed+open bash script to make it possible to pass 2 arguments to Microsoft Remote Desktop Client. I can pass a host name, and I can throw a switch to connect to the console of Server 2003 hosts.\nI know this could be taken further. For Example: \n\n\n*\n\n*My bash script will not work with spaces in the paths or file names :)  \n\n*I imagine any of the XML data in the .RDP file could be modified with sed.  \n\n*I included a number of variations of a switch for connecting to the console because I'm old and can never remember which one I like. I bet that bash scripting has a more elegant solution than I use.  \n\n\nHere is how I did it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a Microsoft RDP template profile with all of your preferred settings. Name it 'template.rdp'. Make it connect to a fake server. I used a server name 'zzxyzyz'. This gets used in the 'sed' command as the string to search for and replace with a real server name.\n\n*Create a bash script to copy the template.rdp to a temp.rdp, then sed the temp.rdp with the desired host name that gets passed in when invoking the script. I named my bash script 'rdp.sh'. \n\n*Modify your '~/.bash_profile' to include an alias to 'rdp.sh'\n\n*Make the bash script executable: chmod +x rdp.sh\n\n*Bob's yer uncle \n\n\nContents of my bash script:\n    #! /bin/bash\nrdpTemplateFile='/Users/levi/Dropbox/RDC_Connections/RDS/template.rdp'\nrdpTempRDP='/Users/levi/Dropbox/RDC_Connections/RDS/t.rdp'\nrdpRunCommand=\"/Applications/Remote Desktop Connection.app/Contents/MacOS/Remote Desktop Connection\"\nrdpHost=${1}\n\nif [ \"${2}\" = \"/console\" ] ; then\n    rdpHost=\"${rdpHost} /console\";\n    echo \"rdpHost is: \" ${rdpHost}\nfi\n\nif [ \"${2}\" = \"-console\" ] ; then\n    rdpHost=\"${rdpHost} /console\";\n    echo \"rdpHost is: \" ${rdpHost}\nfi\n\nif [ \"${2}\" = \"-admin\" ] ; then\n    rdpHost=\"${rdpHost} /console\";\n    echo \"rdpHost is: \" ${rdpHost}\nfi\n\ncp -f ${rdpTemplateFile} ${rdpTempRDP}\n\nsed -i '' \"s|zzxyzyz|${rdpHost}|g\" ${rdpTempRDP}\n\nopen -na \"${rdpRunCommand}\" --args ${rdpTempRDP}\n\nAlias added to .bash_profile\n(This assumes my rdp.sh script file is in my home directory, ~/ )\nalias rdp=~/rdp.sh\n\nMake the script executable:\nsudo chmod +x rdp.sh\n\nRun the script:\nHere is an example that includes the console switch. I left a debugging line in the script that shows what is going to be sed'd into the t.rdp file.\nLeviMAC>rdp MyServer -console\nrdpHost is:  MyServer /console\n[~/]\nLeviMAC>\n\n\nA: I don't know when this changed, but the Microsoft Remote Desktop Client does handle rdp:// links now:\n\nMicrosoft Remote Desktop uses the URI scheme rdp://query_string to store pre-configured attribute settings that are used when launching the client. The query strings represent a single or set of RDP attributes provided in the URL. The RDP attributes are separated by the ampersand symbol (&).\nFor example, when connecting to a PC, the string is:\nrdp://full%20address=s:mypc:3389&audiomode=i:2&disable%20themes=i:1 \n\nAll the attributes are documented on the Remote Desktop Client URI Scheme Support TechNet page.\n\nA: Well, after consulting my Microsoft TAM, I've found that there is no way to pass a hostname to the Microsoft client via the command line.\nCoRD, on the other hand, can actually do what I'd like by handling rdp:// links. After installing CoRD, if you type \nopen rdp://servername\n\nin Terminal or iTerm2, it will open a session to the host servername within CoRD. \nI use Alfred (http://www.alfredapp.com/) as my \"Launchy\" alternative on Mac, having just discovered it after being a longtime user of Quicksilver. I bought the Powerpack for Alfred, which allows you to use a number of extensions, one of which give it the ability to launch shell scripts. So I created a shell script extension, assigned the keyword rdp, set it to \"required parameter\", and set the script to: \nopen rdp://{query}\n\nThis allows me to invoke alfred, and type rdp {tab} servername {return} to open a Remote Desktop Connection session to the remote server. \n\nA: There is no command line access for the Microsoft Remote Desktop Client. But the free and most excellent CoRD remote desktop client does handle rdp:// links which would let you call it from a launcher of your choice or even via open on the command line.\nThe CoRD documentation on github lays out how you can use URL encoded parameters to open full-configured RDP sessions.\nrdp:// URL syntax\nCoRD handles rdp:// URLs, which you can use from many places inside OS X. Unfortunately, there is no way to extend Finder's \"Connect to Server\" dialog, which supports launching VNC URLs, so we can't launch CoRD from there. If Apple changes this (or if anybody is aware of a way to extend it) we would love to hear about it.\n\nSaved Servers\nIf you want to use rdp:// urls with existing saved servers, you can (as of 0.5.3)! Just use the label in place of a hostname:\nopen rdp://label\nNew Servers\nFrom a shell (using Terminal):\nopen rdp://hostname\nAdditional parameters can be used to start a fully-configured session via the URL:\nopen rdp://[username[:password]@]hostname[:port][/domain][?parameters]\nThe following parameters can be set for the session via a query string (as of 0.5.2):\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*screenDepth ### [8|16|24|32]\n  \n*screenWidth <width in pixels>\n  \n*screenHeight <height in pixels>\n  \n*consoleSession ### [true|false|yes|no]\n  \n*fullscreen ### [true|false|yes|no]\n  \n*windowDrags ### [true|false|yes|no]\n  \n*drawDesktop ### [true|false|yes|no]\n  \n*windowAnimation ### [true|false|yes|no]\n  \n*themes ### [true|false|yes|no]\n  \n*fontSmoothing ### [true|false|yes|no]\n  \n*forwardDisks ### [true|false|yes|no]\n  \n*forwardPrinters ### [true|false|yes|no]\n  \n*forwardAudio ### [0|1|2]\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*0 - Forward Audio to the Local Machine (Currently not used since CoRD doesn't present audio)\n  \n*1 - Leave Audio at the Remote Machine\n  \n*2 - Disable Audio at both  Machines\nExample\nopen rdp://jsmith:securePassword@hostname.bigco.com/BigCoDomain?screendepth###24\\&consoleSession###true\\&themes###false\\&screenWidth###1280\\&screenHeight###800\nNote:\nWhen using ampersands (&) from the command line, they have to be escaped with a backslash (). Colons (:) can be used in place of ampersands for the same effect, without needing to be escaped.\nPasswords with any special characters in them, @, :, &, etc need to be encoded according to the URL Encoding Format\nCommand Line Use\nCoRD supports the following command line options: -host -port -u -d -p -a [8|16|24|32] set screen depth -width set screen resolution width -height set screen resolution height\nExample\n/Applications/CoRD.app/Contents/MacOS/CoRD -host example.com -port 3389 -u username\nCaveats\nLaunching CoRD from the command line this way causes a fresh instance of CoRD to be opened. One symptom of this is multiple Dock icons. This overrides or decreases the effectiveness of many of CoRD strong points, including unified sessions, etc. For that reason, we recommend using the open command, and rdp:// URLs to launch sessions.\n\n\n\nA: The script above doesn't work with the latest \"Microsoft Remote Desktop\".  Referencing the application with a variable was problematic so I hard coded the path (which is different from the original example).

Walking in to a Apple premium reseller's store today I was told that there is no difference range-wise between Express (the June 2012 model) and Extreme.\nTrue story?\nWhere can I get more detailed specs on the models? Apple's site isn't exactly thorough…\n\nA: The Wireless specs are the same.\nThe Features of each one, however, are not. Here's a few differences:\n\n\n*\n\n*Packaging (obviously)\n\n*USB connection: On Express, only printers work. On Extreme, Printers and External HDDs.\n\n*Airport Extreme is able to create two wireless networks (one regular, one guest). Apple site states it has a guest network.\n\n*Airport Express has a P2 connector for AirPlay audio.\n\n\nA: I can say there is not noticeable difference between the two when it comes to signal strength and wireless performance when transferring between two wireless devices.\nBut concerning the spec. there is one serious gotcha with the Express, it has no Gb Port. The WAN and LAN ports are both 10/100Mbps ports. This means that if you have a 300Mbps Wireless connection to the Airport Express your real access to the network will be limited by the wired connection.\nThis can have a negative impact on large file transfers and Time Machine backups.\nThe power supply of the Express is built-in while with the extreme you need to make room for the power supply where it will be installed.\nSubjectively the Express seems to be slightly better at dispatching WiFi through the floor bellow it.\n\nA: It is True, as the technical specs are the same. \nWith the old Express models, what really made the difference was that while those had to be plugged into the electrical socket, Extremes could be placed in a much higher level, widely increasing their range.\n\nA: NO.\nLAN ports of both Airport Express and Airport Extreme are the same in speed, 1GMbps.\n", "Q: Trackpad firmware doesn't update and now stopped working (Lion & MacBook 13\" Unibody) I bought an oldish MacBook 13\" Unibody (late 2008) and when I got it one of the first things I did was to install Mac OS X Lion.\nEverything was working fine, until I applied an update that made the trackpad stop working (it only accepts clicks, no touch is recognized).\nThis is the \"Trackpad Firmware Update\" from the automatic updates.\nWhen starting this firmware update a window appears with a status message, \nCancel and Update buttons. After clicking the Update button, it starts installing, appears to complete, status changes to Finishing..., and Update button comes back active at some point.\nAfter that I have tried (unsuccessfully):\n\n\n*\n\n*downloading and installing the update directly from Apple Support - http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3288\n\n*same thing, but using the 'root' account \n\n*leaving the computer on overnight to see if actually \"finished\" the\nprocess\n\n*Reset PRAM PVRAM - http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1379\n\n*Reset SMC - http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3964\n\n*Hand palm pressing over 30 seconds on the trackpad (read this on\nanother thread...?)\n\n*Reinstalling Mac OS X Lion using a DVD\n\n*Indifferent to USB devices being connected or not\n\n\nI'd be thankful for any ideas to try out.\n\nA: Ended up taking it to an apple technician and they fixed it...\n", "Q: Playing DVDs from other regions I moved to different continents a few times (Europe -> North America -> Asia -> Europe) and ended up with a stack of DVDs I can't play now.\nI looked around for a firmware update for my iMac, but it doesn't look like it exists:\nhttp://www.rpc1.com/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=49450\nSince I got the DVDs legitimately, I feel like I have the right to play them. So my question is, I mainly have a whole bunch of DVDs from North America. Is my only safe option to buy a secondary external DVD player for this region, or is it possible to find a region-free DVD player altogether (I'm in Germany right now). I had trouble finding it.\n\nA: VLC may not be an adequate solution -- on some Macs (my 2009 Mac Pro, for one), if a drive doesn't have a matching region code, it won't serve data to VLC or any other software. If you have such a drive, your only solution will be to get another DVD drive that is not so restrictive. The external superdrive that I use with my Macbook Air, for example, allows the VLC trick to work, and allows me to rip non-U.S. discs so I can convert them to universal format and play them on my DVD player.\nI don't know of any way to tell the friendly drives from the unfriendly ones except by trial and error.\nRemember to go to System Preferences, \"CDs & DVDs\" and set \"When you insert a video DVD\" to \"Ignore\" before you try any of these tricks. If it's set to \"Open DVD Player,\" that program will do a region check every time, which you do not want.\n\nA: What I believe you can do is to use VLC instead of the built-in DVD Player app to play your DVDs.\nI've had a similar problem, because DVD Player always wanted me to pick one region. I then discovered that if I play the DVD in VLC it doesn't ask me about any region settings and just plays the movie.\n\nA: I have a MacBook Pro and I followed a similar solution to the one above.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download VLC.\n\n*Open System Preferences → CD's and DVD's.\n\n*Set When you insert a video DVD to VLC.\n\n*Restart your MAC for the settings to take effect.\n\n\nWorks like a charm (confirmed: still the best step-by-step answer as of Jan. 2015.) It is the DVD player that is bound to regional restrictions.\nNote, your video may not start up automatically when you insert a DVD (but VLC will) so you may have click \"open file\" to play it. It will then play with normal functionality, except that you will have to manually select \"fullscreen\" if you should so desire.\nAlso works for MacBook Air (tested on 2014 model with OS X Yosemite)\n", "Q: What should I do before I give up my iPhone? I am changing jobs and so I am giving back to the old company an iPhone 3GS running iOS 5. I am searching for a To-Do list for things to copy from the iPhone to a Mac computer so that I don't lose anything. Here are the things I could remember:\n\n\n*\n\n*Photos: copied to the Mac using the Preview.\n\n*Music: All are already in Mac using iTunes.\n\n*Email, Contacts and Calendar: from iCloud account are still available in Mac Mail and Clendar programs.\n\n*Apps: the apps installed are downloaded in iTunes, but, as far as I know, the app data will get lost.\n\n*Maps bookmarks: would be nice to copy them from iphone, but I have no idea whether this is possible!\n\n\nAre there any other things to copy from my iPhone?\n\nA: You can save all the app data to migrate to another iOS device at a later date by backing the iPhone up to iTunes or setting up a free iCloud account.\nThis will nicely complement your existing plan in case you forget something until after you turn in the phone. You can restore your backup on to a friend's device long enough to retrieve that additional data and then erase the device. As long as you maintain the iTunes backup on the computer or iCloud access - your backup will be waiting until you get another iOS device to load the backup.\nHere are some other apps you may have used occasionally and want to transfer to your Mac:\n\n\n*\n\n*voice memos can be imported to iTunes\n\n*call history, SMS messages and voicemail (using an app like PhoneView)\n\n\nIf you have a good backup, you can feel better about having the phone erase all content and settings so you give it back clean and with no personal data just in case your company doesn't do a great job sanitizing the device before re-issuing it to someone else.\n\nA: Backing it up will save stuff such as app data, including Maps bookmarks but by default, needs to be restored to a replacement iOS device.\niTunes: About iOS backups\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT4946\n", "Q: Best keyboard mapping approach to make a Mac work like Ubuntu? Through the day I work on both a Mac and Ubuntu.\nWhat's the best option for mapping the Mac keyboard (an external, non-Mac one) to Ubuntu style keys - when using the Mac (OS X).\nBasically I want to have:\nControl on keyboard to trigger Command ⌘ keystroke on the Mac\nAlt on keyboard to trigger Option ⌥ keystroke on the Mac\nWindows on keyboard key to trigger Command ⌘ keystroke on the Mac\nAside from whether this is a good idea or not and which one I should pick, I am just posing the question of how to make the Mac, when used with the external keyboard, to be more Ubuntu-like.  My biggest interest is in making sure that vi/vim/macvim and tmux, both of which have a large number of keyboard commands, work the same for my fingers.\nI initially thought about this posting on Ask Ubuntu but it actually seems more suitable here.\n\nA: Ok, what you want to do is remap your modifiers:\nGo to System Preferences and select Modifier Keys:\n\nThen swap Cmd and Control.\n\nnote: in the shot they are not swapped\nFor reference, I do this with an external Razer Blackwidow for Windows (I want it to be like my Mac keyboard because I've been using Mac keyboards for 10 years).\n", "Q: Mac OS X 10.4 - Thunderbird 3 to Thunderbird 13 I'm working with an ancient PowerPC Mac running Tiger. I managed to migrate the POP email from Apple Mail 2 to Thunderbird 3, but I now need to migrate it to a newer machine with Thunderbird 13. How would I go about doing this?\nDoes Thunderbird 13 store email in the same format as Thunderbird 3?  Can I just copy over files? What should I do?\n\nA: It seems that installing Thunderbird 3 on a newer Mac--non PowerPC--is the correct way to go about it.\nI'll refer to the older Mac as \"machine 1,\" and the newer Mac as \"machine 2.\"\n\n\n*\n\n*Find an archived installer for Thunderbird 3.\n\n*Install Thunderbird 3 on machine 2, and launch it.  Do not answer any questions, and quit Thunderbird: this will generate the appropriate folder structure in ~/Library.\n\n*On machine 1 locate the applicable profile in ~/Library/Thunderbird/Profiles/, and copy it over to machine 2.\n\n*\n\n*I archived it with tar -cf ~/Desktop ~/Library/Thunderbird/Profiles/profile so it transferred faster, and saved a copy to our fileserver.\n\n\n*On machine 2, place the profile in ~/Library/Thunderbird/Profiles, keeping in mind that in Mac OS X Lion ~/Library is hidden in Finder.\n\n*\n\n*Extract the profile with tar -xzf ~/Library/Thunderbird/Profiles/profile.tar.gz.\n\n\n*Copy the name of the generated profile to the clipboard, and delete it.  Then rename the profile you copied from machine 1 to the name of the generated profile.\n\n*Launch Thunderbird, and you should be good to go!\n\n\nA: TenFourBird is an option for upgrading Thunderbird on PowerPC Macs. TenFourBird is a community port of Thunderbird which requires 10.4 or later and is based on the efforts of TenFourFox. The current stable version of TenFourBird is equivalent to Thunderbird 17. TenFourBird targets only ESR versions of Thunderbird, so version 24 is currently in beta.\n", "Q: How do I prevent a scheduled shell script containing an rsync command from causing a kernel panic? I have a simple backup shell script that runs daily at 1:00 AM. It uses rsync to copy twelve different directories onto my Windows computer's external hard drive. Here's an example:\nrsync -a --delete-after --progress --stats \"$HOME/Downloads\" \"/Volumes/Backups/MacBook Pro\"\n\nIt used to work fine, but one day it kernel panicked. Then the next day. And then the next. I did some troubleshooting and found that the kernel panic only occurs when the \"$HOME/Documents\" directory is included in the list of directories to be backed up.

I assume you have a VM running during the backup. In the past few months I've had kernel panics (nowhere near consistent as yours), from varying apps, but I eventually realized they only happen if I have VMs running and a high CPU load (like rsync would create).\nI have no idea why yet, but you could probably test that on your system.\nYour rsync command looks OK. I second the comment that says you should use launchd rather than cron though. Cleaner, more reliable, and once you create the plist in the right place, you won't have to worry about accidentally running as root.\nThere's a nice app called Lingon that provides a GUI for launchd. Very nice to work with, even if you're comfortable editing plist files manually.\nAlso, make sure the shell you specify at the top of the script is the same as the shell you're using in Terminal. Doubtful that's it, but you never know.\n", "Q: What should I do after I lost my MacBook data? I lost my data on my Mac and now I don't know how to recover it. Do I have to go to a recover shop and pay for the costly recovery?\n\nA: It depends on what condition the hard drive is in, if the drive is still at least partially working and can be connected and recognized by a computer, your in luck and you should be able to do your own recovery. Note that the drive does not have to be mountable it has to be able to show up in Disk Utility. If there was a mechanical or electrical controller failure with the storage drive then a recovery shop is the answer.\nA Do it yourself solution if the drive is not dead \n\n\n*\n\n*If you are using the drive to boot from, stop. Don't use the drive anymore until you have performed a recovery of the data.\n\n*If you don't have a external hard drive that you can boot from to do the recovery I recommend getting one, you can use it as your backup drive later. For now install SnowLeopard or Lion onto it, then boot up from it. Make sure it will be big enough to hold all the files you may want to recover including the size of OS X on the drive you are recovering data too.\n\n*Obtain a software recovery tool, I have used Data Rescue with great success several times in the past year. Additionally it is available at a great price Data Rescue at the Mac App Store, its cheaper since you can't recover from a hard drive you are booted from. This is not a problem, since besides one should not really recover onto a potentially failing drive or a drive where one accidentally deleted stuff.\n\n*Perform the recovery and save the recovered files onto your clean external drive you are booted from.\n\n*Recover and salvage whatever lost files you want to keep.\n\nA: Try as MrDaniel has posted. In the future, make an investment if possible and take advantage of the features TimeMachine offers. http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1427 Let this be a lesson learned and allow for a simple fix in the future! :) Have a great day & good luck on the recovery!\n\nA: If you have a backup, use Migration Assistant to recover your files from your Time Machine backup to a new user.\nIf you don't have a backup, you can use file recovery software to try and recover some of your files.\nFirst, as described on another answer, stop using the computer with the deleted files right away.\nEach time you turn on the computer, space marked as empty is overwritten -for cache purposes, local Time Machine backups, etcétera- and your chances of recovering your files diminish.\nThen, put the computer with the deleted files on Target Disk mode and connect it to another Mac. On this second Mac, install recovery software. I've used TestDisk with success.\nOther users recommend Disk Drill, which has a GUI, and may be easier to use.\n", "Q: Hard Disk Transfer to SSD - 2007 MacBook and Lion I've recently asked a question regarding fitting a Crucial 256GB SSD (Part No : CT1742109) into my 2007 MacBook (model MB061LL/A), however when researching the transfer process something isn't too clear.\nI have had to replace my hard drive a couple of times since I purchased the MacBook so I know I used to boot from the DVD and re-install.  With Snow Leopard, I used to insert the disk and select 're-install from a Time Machine Backup' or something similar and it would go through the process.  Why couldn't I do this using my most recent (albeit 'Lion') backup?  I wouldn't be re-installing Snow Leopard, just merely using the DVD to access the option to re-install from backup.\nA follow up question is should I stump up the extra for the data transfer kit offered or is this a waste?  Note that I do not want to replace my optical bay and I also don't want to run two HD's at once.  I would preferably like to clone the drive onto the new one.\n\nA: My favorite method is to install a Recovery HD onto an external USB drive and then do a final backup to Time Machine. You can use any USB flash drive that has 1G of space and can be erased or partitioned for your Recovery HD storage.\nNow you can place the new drive in your mac and install a fresh copy of Lion and play around a bit to make sure it works. Once you are happy, erase Lion and re-install a fresh copy but instead of making a new account, just migrate over from the Time Machine backup.\nFor advanced users, using Disk Utility or SuperDuper/CarbonCopyCloner can be fun, but even knowing how to do all that, I prefer the opportunity to test my backup since being able to restore a backup is so overlooked and catastrophic when it fails on you should you need it.\nI'd say save your money on the transfer kit unless you want that anyhow. No need to move things over and in fact, it's sometimes better to let the system lay out the files in order rather than block copying the old structure on to a pristine new drive. With an SSD, access times are so fast, you may not notice, but I'd rather have one process that works either way - SSD to HD or back, larger drive to smaller, etc...\n\nA: Your question is not 100% clear to me. Under Lion you don't have a \"bootable media DVD\" (unless you have a USB-Key which you don't mention). If your current drive has Lion, probably the fastest way to deal with all this is to use Carbon Copy Cloner and any external ssd case, clone the drive (CCC can recognize Lion's recovery partition and clone that too), when the clone is finished and you're sure it boots (by pressing ⌥ upon power on and selecting the external drive), you can then proceed to swap the drives and put the SSD you just cloned/tested in the internal bay, with luck, if you've gotten a flexible enough disc enclosure, you can even use the internal drive as a backup ;)\nUPDATE: Since you find stupid the fact that you are trying to boot an older operating system to restore a newer one, then why don't you just go ahead and create a bootable drive of your newer operating system so you can restore your backup they way it should be? Any USB dongle will do.\nGo ahead an use Lion Recovery Disk Assistant.\n", "Q: Use Logitech g15 multimedia keyboard with Apple Logic 9 That's what I'd like to do: use my Logitech g15 multimedia keys (stop, pause etc) with Apple Logic 9.\n\nA: Download the Logitech Control Center for OS X. It will allow you to set all the setting for your keyboard, including the stop, play, pause, and volume up/down buttons.\n", "Q: Mac Mini does not startup despite entering the password When entering the administrator password while starting up the mac mini, the login screen keeps appearing again and again, prompting me for password. \n\nA: This is a great troubleshooting question since there are about 5 things that come to mind that can cause this and you'll need some time and or another mac to did into the logs to determine the cause.\nBefore we start - does the password field shake left and right to indicate the password you typed was not accepted, or does it fade out smoothly to indicate the password was accepted and the user log in process is starting?\nNext, you might find out your OS level to see if you have Lion or later and can use a recovery HD to boot and look at the logs. Alternatively if you know ssh and command line tools, you could try remotely logging into the mini.\nBefore you start down this road - try disabling the log in items by typing your password and then immediately hold shift down after pressing return. This is something quick to try before you reach out for support.\nHere is where I'd start:\n\n\n*\n\n*review this - http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2674 - _It looks from your description you have failed the last step in the table. Ignore the link at the bottom of the page - it's probably far too old to be of help.\n\n*try this - http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1455 - This safe boot is similar to the \"safe login\" above, but much deeper.\n\n\nIf you reach out to Apple or another technician, they should be able to walk you through the steps to make a new admin user in 30 minutes or less. Then you will know if it's your user or the system that has failed and you can start to proceed from restoring a backup or picking apart why your user has failed to let you log in.\n\nA: If you've \"forgotten\" your login password, you can boot from the appropriate OS install disc and reset your password.\nOnce you've booted up from the Install disc, Choose Reset Password from the Utilities menu at the top of the screen.\nOne caveat:  If you've encrypted your data with FileVault, DON'T DO THIS.\n", "Q: How to login to a network account on a MacBook without network? I currently have a MacBook with Lion (fully updated), using the network account from a Lion Server (also fully updates) and I'm able to login to the network account just fine.\nHowever, when I'm offline (away from my home network), I can't login to my account. How do I make the MacBook cache the network account login information for posterior offline use?\nI'm able to login at home, put the mac to sleep and use it without any network, but if I reboot it for any reason, I'm locked out (only local accounts are \"loggable\").\n\nA: According to this answer in the Apple Support Communities, I'm needed to create a mobile account on my server:\n\nIn Workgroup Manager, select your username in the list of users.\nClick the Preferences button.\nClick the Mobility button.\nTurn it on using your desired settings.\n\nThanks to HopelessN00b for pointing me to the right direction.\n", "Q: Fast and easy OS X app, to copy and paste and store and retrieve, code and text back fast? Sometimes when coding I use TextEdit to copy and paste some snippets in it, buts it's not efficient. \nSo I look for some personal recommendations for a fast easy OS X app to copy and paste and store and retrieve code / text back fast?\n\nA: You can select snippets of text and drag them to the Desktop, thus creating a Text Clipping file that you can drag back to another app.\n", "Q: URL to individual email Is it possible to have an url that links to an individual email message on my local machine? So that if I click on osxmail://759847982 my mail client will open that specific message.\nGMail can do this, but I wonder if it's possible in a native client.\nI'm open to any application, it doesn't have to be Apple Mail.\n\nA: You can simply drag the message from Mail.app to a folder to create the link you want. The link that is generated is automagically named using the subject line of the email message. Yes, there are many such situations where Mac OS will do the natural thing.\nYou can also drag any message to TextEdit.app (as long as it's to an RTF document).  Sadly, I haven't gotten this to work with Pages '09, but TextEdit isn't that bad.  The same is reported to work with Stickies. See this link for a stickies example.\nHere is another approach:\nIn Mail.app, on the message that you'd like to link to, select \nView->Message->All Headers\n\n(or ⇧⌘H)\nand look for the a line that begins with Message ID.  Copy the text to the right of \"Message ID\" and use it to link to that message via\nmessage://<copied-messageid>\n\n.  Make sure to copy the < and > along with the rest of the id. I've tested this and it works with Safari.app as described in this article on MacOSX Hints. \n\nA: \nI'm open to any application, it doesn't have to be Apple Mail.\n\nI have used Airmail in the past which has this functionality.\nI don't have it installed anymore (the iOS app was full of bugs and got on my nerves so I'm back to Mail.app) but it was somewhere in the menu bar (search for \"copy link\").\n", "Q: How to prevent loading some LaunchDaemons? I just took a look into /Library/LaunchDaemons and was wondering how many different things I opened up there :)\nCan I easily remove strange one? How can I disable them during system boot?\nI see the next list\nat.obdev.littlesnitchd.plist\ncom.adobe.fpsaud.plist\ncom.bresink.system.securityagent3.plist\ncom.google.keystone.daemon.plist\n\n\nA: On boot all plist files in /Library/LaunchDaemons are scanned. The plist files which contain \n    <key>Disabled</key>\n<false/>\n\nare loaded.\nWhen you want them to not be loaded during next boot, change <false/> into <true/>.\nFor exemple with terminal command $ sudo nano /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.google.keystone.daemon.plist\nThe built in command which prevents loading a daemon on next boot and immediately unloads (stops) the requested daemon is called like this:\n$ sudo launchtl unload -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.google.keystone.daemon.plist\n\nThe -w switch makes that  is being written into the plist.\nThe -w switch makes that the daemon is not loaded on next boot.\nTo verify that the daemon is unoaded with succes, issue:\n$ launchtl list | grep com.google.keystone\n\nShould return something like:\n-   0   com.google.keystone.user.agent\n\nWhen the output line starts with a \"-\" (minus sign) then the unload succeeded. \n12132   0    com.google.keystone.user.agent\n\nIn case there is a number (the PID) at the first position than the unload failed.\n\nA: AFAIK, it's safe to remove files in /Library/LaunchAgents/ and /Library/LaunchDaemons/ normally without booting in safe mode or anything. The jobs will stay loaded, but won't be loaded again on the next login.\n\nA: Use the safe boot to disable many non-essential Apple Daemons as well as all third party daemons. Basically hold shift when you hear the boot chime and wait a few extra minutes as some safe mode checks run before the limited tasks get started by launchd.\nSee http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1455 for more details.\nThen you can selectively delete, modify, inspect the system without these daemons. The ones you listed are all well known, common, third party apps so unless you have some odd trojan or virus that wrote these instead of installing the software that matches these, you should be safe. It's good to know you're safe so happy learning about the launchd process and how things work under the hood!\n", "Q: Time machine backup/restore: \"This user's data doesn't need to be transferred\" So, I had a MacBook Pro 15\", Late 2011, that I've been using daily since I got it last October. I set up time machine and every day after work, I would bring my laptop home and plug it into my time machine disk and let it do it's thing. I even used my backups from time to time, when I deleted some bit of code on accident (or on purpose) and decided I wanted to use it after all.\nLast week I sold my trusty old MacBook and bought a new MacBook Retina. The guy I was selling it to wanted to keep some of the apps I had installed and he didn't want a full wipe/restore, so I did what I have done before when I sell a Mac: create a new user account and delete the old one, effectively wiping all of my user data.\nHowever, I created the new user and deleted the old one (and ALL of my data) with my time machine hooked up and running.\nNow, in restoring my time machine backup to my new laptop, all of my user data is gone. I see my user in the Users list in the Migration Assistant, but under my user name it says \"This users's data doesn't need to be transferred.\"\nI tried selecting everything that's available and restoring, but all of my data is gone.\nLooking through my backup files, I see the backup for this laptop with all of the different dates. I can expand any of the dates and navigate down into Users, but my user account is gone from every single backup on every date.\nIs this an expected behavior? Has anyone ever seen anything like this?\nOne other thing of note : I had FileVault turned on on the old MacBook, encrypting my home directory. Is there some magic combination of things I need to do in order to restore from an encrypted home directory?  \nThe strange thing is, the restore re-created my user and it remembers my password.  But everything, everything about the account has been lost. Keychain, mail settings, all files and libraries, preferences... The only thing it seems to have kept is my login photo, username, and password.\n\nA: Just restore from a snapshot that is a bit older than when you did the wiping. If for some reason this isn't easy, you can also delete the folders by time in your backup.\nIf you have any doubts, you could use a tool like BackupLoupe to make sure you prune only the \"bad\" backup events and data.\n\nA: Time Machine cannot back up a FileVault I user while the user is logged in. Normally it will offer to back up the user when you log out, but if you never log out, or always decline the offer when you do, your user account never gets backed up.\nIf TM did back up your user, it did it while the user was logged out. In that case, what it backed up was essentially an unmounted sparse bundle disk image. If you log in as a different admin user, you should be able to restore the entire home folder. I don't have a FileVault I user available to test with, but I remember doing this, just as a test, and it worked. I may have had to restore the home folder under a different name, and then use my admin's sudo powers to give it the correct ownership and name before the FV-using user could use it.\nThe important thing is that when browsing through the backup, do no not attempt to descend into the FV user's home folder. It has to be restored in its entirety or not at all, and cannot be restored in-place.\n", "Q: How much GPU memory do iPhones and iPads have? I'm wondering how GPU memory works on the iPhone and iPad. After reading the Apple tech specs on the iPad 3 (http://www.apple.com/ipad/specs/) it says the A5X is a system on a chip with a dual core CPU and quad core GPU. Do they share the same system RAM? How does the GPU do fast operations if it has to work in system RAM? I'm sure it's my lack of understanding of the system on a chip architecture that is confusing me, but if someone can chime in with their knowledge that would be helpful.\n\nA: On the newer processors such as the A5X, A6 and A6X Apple has doubled the bandwidth to memory for the GPU to 128bit whereas the CPU still has 64 bit access.  \n\nA: iPhones/iPod Touches/iPads all have a Unified Memory Architecture which mean that both the CPU and GPU share system memory.  There is no dedicated video memory on these devices.\nThe advantage is that you don't need to worry about running out of video memory for your textures or vertex data (your app will be terminated by iOS for using too much memory before that happens). The disadvantage is that you share the same memory bandwidth for gameplay and graphics. The more memory bandwidth you dedicate to graphics, the less you will have for gameplay and physics\n", "Q: Copy message_id from selected message In Mail, when I've selected a message, I would like to have a shortcut to copy the message_id (see my previous question) to the clipboard.\nHow do I manage that?

Then open a Finder window and do ⇧⌘G, type the path to the Mail Scripts Folder and hit enter to view that folder.  Now drag your newly created script to that folder. \nWhile you're in the AppleScript Editor, you probably want to go ahead and enable the AppleScript Menu for the toolbar so that you can find and run the script easily.

Sometimes it also skips to the next song or podcast. It's very annoying.\nIs there some way to tell my iPhone not to do that?\nThe headphones are original Apple headphones for the iPhone. I bought two pairs and it happens with both pairs but only with that iPhone. I have a second iPhone 3GS which doesn't appear to react like that.\n\nA: It happens because a quick jog of the plug causes a short interruption in line level.  It's the same with headphones -- Apple or otherwise -- that include a play/pause button (usually place on the cable itself, where it splits to go to each ear).  That button functions in exactly the same way, by momentarily interrupting line-level on the phone's cables.  iTunes starts playing because it assumes the interruption from plug movement (or a dirty plug) is a play/pause signal.  As a simple demonstration, start iTunes playing something and wiggle the phones jack, same conditions as make iTunes launch and play, only if it's already playing this will make it pause.\n\nA: I've tried many of the fixes on here, NONE of them worked... I noticed my phone was showing \"Less than 20% battery\"... Maybe... Took it home, charged it.. No more pausing... Maybe the issue is no more than that! I'm using the same headphones, and the podcasts have been playing without issue...\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Where is the manual for the Apple iPhone Podcasts app? I have the recently released Apple iPhone app \"Podcasts\", released June 2012. Is there somewhere that gives more than just a cursory explanation of how to use it?  \nFor example, when does it chose to download podcasts? Can you force it to update the podcasts without going one by one and clicking on the download link? Will it download over cellular? (I don't want it to do that). Can it download the podcasts but play through the normal music app?\n\nA: \nIs there somewhere that gives more than just a cursory explanation of how to use it?\n\nProbably not - Apple's not big on providing manuals when they don't think they're necessary. \n\nFor example, when does it chose to download podcasts?\n\nProbably hourly. There's no option to change this that I can find.\n\nCan you force it to update the podcasts without going one by one and clicking on the download link?\n\nIt downloads new episodes for subscribed podcasts automatically.\n\nWill it download over cellular?\n\nYep, it does. It also streams over cellular, and well enough that I didn't notice that that was what it was doing at first. (I'm on Verizon 3G.)\n\nCan it download the podcasts but play through the normal music app?\n\nNope. It's totally separate.

How do I make it stop?\n\nA: Try making your hostname permanent by typing this command into the Terminal:\nsudo scutil --set HostName yourcomputer\n\nMy hostname kept changing when I connected to the network because the router was broadcasting a different hostname, and this fixed it.\n", "Q: How do I delete a BootCamp partition using Terminal's diskutil? For some reason, the BootCamp Assistant app won't let me delete my BootCamp partition. How can I do so using Terminal and the diskutil terminal app?\n\nA: Have you tried booting from OSX installation media? Those have both a Terminal (with diskutil) and the GUI Disk Utility, which might start working as you're no longer trying to partition the drive you're booting from.\nCaution, from now on: here be dragons! Make sure you understand what's going on before you start on this, you can't back out halfway! Check your backups are readable!\nIf both versions of diskutil fail here too, stay in the installation media's terminal and get the raw partition table using:\ngpt -r show disk0\n\nWhat has likely happened is that the two partition tables, the GPT and the MBR, have gone out of sync. This happens if you try to partition your Mac disk from Windows. The above shows the GPT version (which OSX uses). This shows the MBR version (which Windows uses):\nfdisk /dev/disk0\n\nMake sure this is the disk you want to change (might be disk1, disk2, etc). Note the number (index) of the partition you want to delete in both the GPT and the MBR. They might not be the same!\nIf confused, post the output from the above 2 here, and don't proceed.\nUnmount all mounted partitions on the disk you want to partition, e.g.\ndiskutil unmount \"/Volumes/Macintosh HD\"\ndiskutil unmount \"/Volumes/BOOTCAMP\"\n\nThen comes the dangerous bit (make sure you have backups): Delete the partition using the gpt utility:\ngpt remove -i 4 disk0\n\nMake sure to substitute the index of the partition to delete (IN THE GPT) instead of \"4\" and the exact disk you're partitioning instead of \"disk0\"!\nFinally, you'll need to delete the same partition from the MBR (you may need to unmount again at this point).\nOption 1: Remove all trace of bootcamp (only boot OSX on this disk)\nIf you want to completely remove any trace of Boot Camp (no OSes other than Mac OS X) you can completely destroy the MBR partition table and replace it with a so-called \"protective MBR\":\nfdisk -e /dev/disk0\n\nThis lands you at the fdisk command line - the parts in bold are what you type.\nfdisk: 1>p\nThis will show your partition table, same as earlier.

You'll need to quit out of fdisk with\nfdisk: 1>q\nNext: reboot and pray.\nOption 2: Remove only the affected partition (go from triple boot to dual boot or so)\nIf you want to keep the hybrid MBR, just not the one partition, begin editing the MBR like so: \nfdisk -e /dev/disk0\n\nThis lands you at the fdisk command line - the parts in bold are what you type.\nfdisk: 1>p\nThis will show your partition table, same as earlier.\nFind the entry that corresponds to the partition you're deleting, e.g. 4, then edit that entry (replace \"4\" with your entry):\nfdisk:*1>edit 4\nPartition id ('0' to disable)  [0 - FF]: [7] (? for help)0\nPartition 4 is disabled.\nfdisk: 1>p\nThis should now show a partition table with the deleted partition missing.\nfdisk: 1>w\nWrites your changes to disk. You'll need to quit out of fdisk with\nfdisk: 1>q\nNext: reboot and pray.\n\nA: The answer is to boot off the recovery HD partition, use disk until and select the Bootcamp partition.  Then on the erase tab select the format and change it to Mac OS Extended journaled.  Now you can erase the drive.\n\nA: Here's what worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*use diskutil list to find the small Microsoft Reserved partition you're trying to delete but disk utility (or the command-line equivalent diskutil) won't allow.  Let's say it's on disk 99 partition 400 (mine was on disk 0 partition 4)\n\n*sudo diskutil eraseVolume JHFS+ deleteme /dev/disk99s400\nThe above reformats the partition to journaled HFS+ and once you've done that you can just simply delete it (and then resize etc. as you wish).\nNote:  I've used /dev/disk99s400 because that should not ever work, you have to replace those with the right disk and partition.\nWARNING: Destructive, high risk. ALWAYS do a full back up first before screwing with partitions.  ALWAYS.\n\nA: I am not certain we have the exact situation, but through following/translating advice on another thread, http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/145292/i-deleted-my-bootcamp-partition-but-cant-resize-my-os-x-partition\nI was able to restore functionality to Bootcamp Assistant.  I lack the \"reputation points\" to comment there, but wanted to pass on that this worked for me.\nMy system/hardware specifications are as follows:\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015)\nOSX Yosemite:  10.10.5 (14F1605)\nProcessor: 2.7 GHz Intel Core i5\nMemory:  8 GB 1867 MHz DDR3\nGraphics: Intel Iris Graphics 6100 1536 MB\nMy specific information:\nI, unfortunately, followed errant advice from apple support, and followed instructions by phone support to enter Disc Utility and erased my BOOTCAMP partition and set the format to OS X Extended (Journaled). Following this action, Windows was erased, several megabytes of \"other\" remained, and my partition was still in place, with 98 GB of inaccessible storage.\nThis was how I created the same situation as you seem to be describing.\nAs a result, my Disc Utility no longer responded to efforts to modify my partition, and my Bootcamp assistant now had a greyed out tab which, if I had been directed to it initially, would have erased the windows partition AND Restored a single drive.\nNote that bootcamp began as part of a single drive, this is important.  I have no idea if this solution will work for bootcamp set-ups on separate drives. My problem went to a supervisor, and after two weeks I have had no response from Apple support, so I researched online and found what worked!\nSOLUTION:  As advised on the thread, I ran Disc Utility again.  Two members suggested setting the format to something other than OS X Extended Journaled.  Re-erasing and formatting was the only option Disc Utilities provided.\nOne comment from  user102419 suggested erasing and formatting to \"microsoft FAT\".\nA second, more detailed answer from http://apple.stackexchange.com/users/5472/bmike suggested a similar quick fix, but specified formatting to MS DOS to trick the computer into believing Windows was still installed within the partition.\nEnd result, this worked for me, but the terminology used for the drop-down menu in Yosemite was \"DOS FAT\".\nErasing and formatting the partition in DOS FAT resulted immediately in a return to functionality of the Bootcamp Assistant choice to add or remove Windows.  I happily made the choice, pushed continue and was given the option to RESTORE my drive to a single 248 GB OS X.  \nThe process took about 5-7 minutes...which is a long time when you are worrying you may have messed it up..... but, voila, 249.78 GB of available space on my Macintosh Hard Drive.  No need to enter internet recovery mode, no need to erase the entire system and reboot from Time Machine.\nI did back up everything before trying..just in case.\nI hope this answer is helpful for you, and for others trying to reclaim space from a windows Bootcamp partition after following advice to erase windows through the Disc Utility.\n\nA: For those who tried to install windows and something messed and cannot restore partition and it shows gray (-) sign, launch windows installer and remove windows reserved partitions first. You can check those partitions by first going to terminal on mac and type: \"diskutil list\". You will see there windows reserved portions which apparently can only be removed with windows installer by simply highlighting them and clicking delete on the screen\n\nA: I had the same problem and I HAVE THE SOLUTION.  The problem is that when you install Windows with bootcamp it is creating a Logic Volume Group.  What you need to do is delete the Logical Volume Group.  Very similar to if you have ever undone a manual fusion drive. Bust out terminal:\ndiskutil coreStorage list\nCopy the Logical Volume Group ID\ndiskutil coreStorage delete lvgUUID \nIT WORKS!\n", "Q: Does Thunderbolt support a net topology like FireWire? Does Thunderbolt support the same kind of network architecture that FireWire does?\nIf you have a Mac with two FireWire ports, you can daisy-chain FireWire devices in a loop with the Mac at both ends of the chain. Then you can disconnect any single connection in the chain, and all devices will continue to work so long as they're ultimately still connected to the Mac.\nNow with the Retina MacBook Pro's two Thunderbolt ports, it's possible to try this out, but does anyone know if this should work?\n\nA: Since Thunderbolt is based on PCI Express, it appears that it is possible to connect to multiple hosts using the PCI express standard. However there may be additional software or hardware  required to do such bridging of multiple hosts sharing multiple devices, whether this is true on Thunderbolt or not is not clear.\nThings to look into are Non-transparent Bridging of PCI Express and subsequently Non-transparent Bridging of Thunderbolt.\nPCI Express and therefore Thunderbolt are both peer to peer interfaces just like FireWire so thats a plus. However PCI express appears to have some host specific needs according to PCI Express Peer-to-Peer Interconnect from GE.\n\nIts low latency, high bandwidth, widespread support and costeffective silicon have made PCI Express ubiquitous. It can however, be used for more than merely communicating between a host and a peripheral: it has many advantages as a peerto-peer communications technology. Enabling this, however, demands an understanding of how PCI Express works. This paper outlines the complexities that need to be understood and overcome – and describes a GE software product that delivers a solution that masks those complexities from developers.\n\nAs of now the only thing that Apple has defined for connecting two Macs via Thunderbolt is Target Disk mode running over it.\n", "Q: SataIII SSD and 1,5 negotiated speed MBP5,1 I bought today a SSD hard drive (Kingston HyperX 3K 120Gb) and the problem is the negotiated velocity speed is set to SATA I (1.5 Gigabit), but the negotiated velocity should be SATA II (3 Gigabit). My MacBook Pro is a late 2008 (5,1).\nWhat is going wrong?\n\nA: The problem stems from what i believe with that model is that if you stuck the hard drive into the optical drive bay the actual link speed of the SATA in that bay is only SATA I (1.5 Gigabit). If you take that hard drive out and swap places with the hard drive in the regular slot you should be able to get full SATA II out of your SSD and should not notice much of a speed difference of your old hard drive if it is placed in the SATA I optical drive slot.\n\nA: If nothing else solves the problem, perhaps you should return your Kingston hard drive and purchase a different brand with better support for Apple Macintosh.\nI have had good success with an SSD from Other World Computing (macsales.com). They specialize in products designed for compatibility with Apple Macs.\nThey also have knowledgeable Mac-friendly tech support for the products they sell.\n\nA: You needs to do a SMC RESET procedure on the MBP after the installation. It might help reset the AHCI driver to the new SSD disk to get the 3.0Gbps negotiated link. It might work depending on the revision of the MCP79 chip that the MBP uses. I have the same model and researched all the problems with it.\nIf the SMC reset did NOT work, you are stuck with 1.5GB but be happy that the disk actually works because others are getting ramdom hands/slowdown and after a few weeks the SSD becomes DEAD (would not boot anymore).\nOn the OCZ models, they did a firmware tweak to FORCE the link to be SATA2 to get the 3GB speed, but this will make the CD driver not workable in some cases. The issue here was the AHCI specs were not implemented fully by Nvidia and there are power issues when the drive is operating. On many cases, a large read will cause the beachball wait effect since the drivers will be reset by the hardware several times in an effort to recover the operating link. It will reboot if the condition gets worse. From what I hear , OCZ nailed the problem at the expense of CD driver operation which is acceptable to the user. Apple never wanted to do this for fear of legal repercussions they might endure. So OCZ is the only way to go for this MBP model becuase other drives with SF 2281 controllers are having serious problems. There are people with Rev B logic board that did NOT have such a problem. Unless, you had your board replaced recently, you are likely stuck to the Rev A board which had this weakness.\n", "Q: How does FireWire daisy chaining work between two Macs? After taking a look at this question Does Thunderbolt support a net topology like FireWire?\nI was wondering how FireWire works when it's daisy-chained with multiple devices between a Mac on each end of the chain?\nHow does this work in the external drive case? For example, you have the following setup between two Macs running OS X normally. Note that the hard drive is switched off at first:\nMac 1   <-----FireWire----->  Ext HardDrive  <-----FireWire-----> Mac 2\n\nWhat happens when the hard-drive is turned on in between the two Macs? Does it connect to both, race condition  to 1 of the 2, fail connect to any or does it do something else.\n\nA: Found the solution, and that is that both system will mount the drive simultaneously in a potentially data corrupting manner. \nSource: Macintouch Reader Reports FireWire: Connecting Drive to Two Computers\n\nQ: Vy Tri Truong\n  I have a stack of 2 FireWire Hard Drives next to my Mac Mini. I also have a PC laptop that I sometimes use to access the drives. My Windows XP PC has MacDrive 6 installed which allows it to recognize Mac formatted discs (which these drives are). On one of occasion, I accidentally left the drives plugged into the Mac while connecting my PC to it. I found that both computers were able to access files and write to the discs.\n  Is having 2 computers access the same hard drive simultaneously advisable?\n\nTurns out it is not a good thing to do, may cause data corruption, according to the same source.\n\nA:Daniel Figucio\n  Is having 2 computers access the same hard drive simultaneously advisable?\n  No, it is not advisable in this configuration at all. The file systems on the drives are not concurrent file systems. This means that the PC has no idea where the Mac may have written data and vice versa - which means that they may both try to write data to the same block on the disk because they think it is free, when the other has already written data there - which will obviously corrupt data. The Mac and the PC WILL NOT communicate and tell each other what they have done. So use at your own risk..\n...\n\n", "Q: Simultaneous use of Airport Express and Time Capsule I know Apple likes us to think everything works by magic, but...\nTo use Airplay one needs Airport Express. To backup wirelessly one needs Time Capsule. There is, in particular, no way to Airplay music through Time Capsule, as one can do with Airport Express. I hope there is a better reason for this than selling these two devices. (Note also that the 4th-gen AppleTV + Time Capsule are also not a satisfactory solution for those whose HiFi lacks HDMI.)\nMy question is: if one has both Airport Express and Time Capsule, what are the terms of their co-existence? Does one, for instance, get to choose which of the two is the wifi router? If one chooses Time Capsule, would Airport Express be using the same band (2.4GHz? 5GHz?) for transferring the music? Is the quality of Airplay affected if one is using the bandwidth to capacity?\n\nA: You just extend the network created by one of the two devices. I.e. you start with the Time Capsule, making it create the WiFi. The AirPort Express then gets configured to just extend this network. If you've setup the Time Capsule to use the 5GHz band then yes, the Express will use that too.\nIt's effectively just one WiFi network (or two, if you count the 2.4GHz fallback for older/mobile devices) powered by both stations. All devices connected to that network have access to both stations and they will always get connected to the base station which is nearest. Here's this setting in the AirPort Utility:\n\nWhen setting up a new network with the AirPort Utility you will be asked for this, so it's really easy and happens in two clicks/taps.\nApple also has a good support article on this:\nWi-Fi base stations: Setting up and configuring an extended wireless network\n\nA: They both work together quite well. You can connect them with a wired ethernet cable, wirelessly with the express or the time capsule being a client of the other, or they can both share the network and let all the rest of the clients connect to either of them.\nBoth now do simultaneous dual band networks. This also includes a guest VLAN in addition to the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz channels for your private use. Older clients can connect on the 2.4 GHz as well as more distant clients that need to get through several walls where at your fast more modern clients that can run the 5 GHz range get much better transmit rates.\n", "Q: iPhone app for easy dictation and sending Here is what I want:\nI click a button in the app, and I start dictating. When I am done I press OK, and it either sends the sound-file directly to a predefined email or at least prompts me to do so.\nThink of it like dictating something and sending the wav/mp3 of it to an assistant straight away.\nDoes an app like that exist? I tried Googling for dictation apps etc, but could not seem to find a good match.\n\nA: If you don't mind an extra step, Voice Memos does almost exactly that. It comes with iOS.\n\n\n*\n\n*Run Voice Memos\n\n*Tap record (left button)\n\n*When you're done tap stop then list (both are the right button, in other words double tap)\n\n*Select the memo and tap Share\n\nA: I found something called Pocket Dictate, that comes rather close to what I am looking for. \n\nThe most important feature is, that you can set a default email, that you can send to without having to type it in. \nThe app is not terribly well designed, but so far it is the best I have seen for this specific purpose.\n\nA: If you have an iPhone 4S, or third-generation iPad, you can use the built-in dictation feature in iOS. This won't send a sound file, but will transcribe your speech to be sent.\n\nA: I use DropVox this way. \nIf you do need an email it's very easy to make DropBox send you an email when he get a new memo. I do it. \n", "Q: Screen brightness decreases when I middle-click I have a logitech wireless mouse hooked up to a macbook pro running 10.7. Whenever I middle-click the mouse button, the laptop's display brightness decreases. It behaves just as if I had pressed the F1 key. The middle-click still works in applications (e.g. Firefox opens a new tab), it just has this annoying side-effect. How can I correct this behavior?\n\nA: What you need to do is change the key mappings on your mouse. What this does is tells your computer what to do when you press key X.\nFor Mac… \n\nMapKeyboard is a free program to remap your keyboard. Using MapKeyboard, you can alter any key on your keyboard to function as a different one or altogether disable it as well.

It can also notify you of our device’s battery status, and whether Caps Lock and Num Lock are on.\n\n", "Q: Dialog pops up everyday for less than a second I'm running Mac OS X Lion, I've noticed that about once a day (at different times of the day) a dialog pops up in the center of my screen, then disappears within half a second. It doesn't stay on the screen long enough for me to read anything on the dialog. All I can tell you about it is that it has the big yellow warning icon, perhaps 2 buttons, and some text.\nI would like to find out what application is causing this dialog to appear, and what it says on the dialog.\nAny suggestions as to how I can go about doing this?\nI was thinking of using some screen recording solution, and then when it happens to play back the recording. The software would need to have a really high frame rate in order to record the popup because it disappears so quickly. Any suggestions as to a product that would work and wouldn't use too much CPU?\nAre there any other ways I could solve this problem?\nI tried getting a list of running processes right after it happens, but there's more than 100 of them, and its not guaranteed that the dialog is still running after it pops up on the screen. Plus, I don't really have anything to diff the processes with to find the problematic process because as far as I can tell, my system is always running the process that causes the dialog to appear.\nMore info:\n\n\n*\n\n*It's about the size of the standard unlock form in System Prefs (i.e. what pops up when you press the unlock icon and it asks for you password), but as far as I can tell, it doesn't have the two text boxes at the bottom.\n\n*It seems like the foreground app doesn't matter either. I've seen it popup when Safari is in the foreground, as well as other apps.\n\n\nA: If you look at the Console application (/Applications/Utilities/Console.app), you can see system logs of errors and other activity. If you open it and view log entries for the time of the error, you may be able to find the source and purpose of the message.\n", "Q: Width of the column view separation line in Finder I'm using Mac OS X lion. In Finder, I use the column view. I know how to set up the width, but the thin line you use to drag the columns has suddenly become thicker and very visible. \nI know this isn't a huge problem, but I don't know how it happened and don't know how to change it back.\nI hope you know what I mean and how to get it back to default.\n\nA: You must have a mouse plugged in.\nIn System Preferences > General, under the \"Show Scroll bars\" section, there are three options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Automatically based on mouse or trackpad\n\n*When scrolling\n\n*Always\n\n\nEach act differently.\nAutomatically... with a mouse plugged in will show the scroll bars. When you are just on the trackpad, the scroll bars will be hidden until you scroll. This is the default setting.\nWhen scrolling will always hide the scrollbars unless you are scrolling. If you are on a MacBook, this is probably what you are most used to seeing, so turn this on if you use a mouse occasionally and hate the look of the scroll bars. (This is how I have mine set).\nAlways will always show the scrollbars, so if you like them, they will always be there for you.\n[Edit: I just saw that there was a response up at the top. Hopefully this here will help someone searching to find the answer quicker.]\n\nA: On Mac OS X 10.8 go to System Preferences -> General -> Show scroll bars and select \"Automatically...\".

On a desktop computer, the middle mouse button or shift + insert does the trick. How about on a MacBook Air?\n\nA: If you're using an external mouse, clicking both buttons (if it's a two button mouse) should do it. \nI'm not aware of a way to do it with the trackpad only unless you use a third party tool like KeyRemap4Macbook which will let you bind, eg, ⌥ + left click to a middle click. I've just tested exactly that combination and it works fine for pasting into an X11.app Xterm so should work fine with your VM.\n\nA: Most terminals on Linux allow you to paste with Control+Shift+V. \n(The shift is to make this match Control+Shift+C for Copy, because you can't use Control+C in a terminal because that's already mapped to kill the running process [^C].)\n", "Q: Do Apple Geniuses check if computers are \"lost\" with iCloud's Find My Mac before performing firmware password resets? Firmware password protection1 is nice, but would the Genius Bar actually mind my \"lost\" status noted online if my computer ends up in a store to reset the firmware password (which is the easiest method to reset it)? Do they match the serial this way?\n\nA: I doubt it, and even if they did, you should not rely on it.\nI assume you are concerned about the case where your laptop gets stolen; you want to protect your data. In that regard, the firmware password is utterly useless, the thief could just pull the drive out and access your data anyway.\nI suggest you look into something like FileVault 2 instead.\n", "Q: Editing System/Library files with Property List Editor (PLE) I want to update the schedule in /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.locate.plist.

Try modifying the permissions of the file in the Finder or Terminal.\n\nI don't want to make myself the owner of a System file.  Is there a way to edit this file without manually changing the permissions?\n\nA: Couldn't you just use a code editor? At least TextMate and TextWrangler can convert property lists from binary to XML and authentificate as root in order to save files.\n\nA: I was able to edit it by enabling the root user and editing it directly as root with the PLE.\n\nA: I usually do\ncp /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.locate.plist /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.locate.plist.bak\ncp /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.locate.plist /tmp\n# run PLE on /tmp/com.apple.locale.plist\nsudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.locate.plist\nsudo cp /tmp/com.apple.locale.plist /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.locate.plist\nsudo chown root:wheel /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.locate.plist\nsudo launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.locate.plist\n\nor (if in a hurry) I just change file ownership, do the edit and change ownership back to the original setting.\n\nA: Lingon is a great App with a nice UI for managing these types of files.\nhttp://www.peterborgapps.com/lingon/index.html\nNo hassle other than authenticating at file save.\n", "Q: How can I empty my Camera Roll from my iPhone? I don't want to save anything—just wipe out the Roll like one would reformat a digital camera's memory card. Is there any easy non-computer route? If there aren't any system settings, do any apps do this?\nAssume I have too many to delete individually (1,000+).\n\nA: I'm afraid there isn't an easy way to do so. As far as I know, there is no app which can do what you want... So I've come up with two alternative solutions.\nThe most easy one is to connect your iPhone to your Mac, launch Image Capture (which comes by default on your Mac), select all the photos and delete them. Here is a tutorial how to do so. \nYou can do this on your iPhone as well, without a Mac, but you'll have to do it manually. Which isn't a grateful job if you've got over a 1,000 photos...   \nOpen the camera app, hit the upper-right icon (share), tap all the photos you want to delete (they are marked with a red check-icon) and then hit delete.\n\n\n\nA: There is no feature to do this with one tap. With the advent of iCloud photos, you could conceivably enroll in that to convert the camera roll into cloud backed storage and once that processing is done, sign out of iCloud / disable photos on that device.\nTo start, make a backup of your phone (just in case iCloud fails you) and then open the settings app. Go to iCloud and then tap on Photos. Enable iCloud Photo Library and then connect to a fast WiFi network to allow all the photos to be removed from the camera roll.\nIt's not going to be faster than connecting to a computer in 99% of the time, but for the stated goal of doing it all without a computer, it's now possible.\n", "Q: How different amperage could affect a rechargeable device? I have an iPad with it's own charger that has 2 components: a USB connection cable and an electrical adapter that outputs 5.1 V and 2.1 A.\nAlso I have a car charging device that is suitable for phones that can be charged via the USB data cable. This one has the fallowing output specifications: 5.1 V and 1.0 A.\nMy question is if it is safe for the iPad to connect it to the car charging device and if the difference in the current output would affect it's accumulator.\n\nA: The iPad and other iOS devices are very good about only charging from appropriate voltages and currents. In fact, the iPad even is programmed to detect and show a not charging message in the status bar when it is connected to a power source with current too low. This is most commonly seen when the iPad is plugged into a computer that only supplies the normal USB current of 500 mA.\nIn your specific case, one amp at 5.1 V will charge the iPad slower than normal but still provide a useful charge even when the iPad is in operation. Should you be consuming a lot of data, a lot of graphics, and using GPS location you could possibly use more current than the one amp charger supplies, so just watch your battery level while it's charging and you should be fine.\n", "Q: How can I know how much I paid for an iOS app? I'd like to know how much I paid for a specific iOS app. Is there any way to do this?\nI realize that you can see your order history in iTunes, but its really hard to find a specific app using that interface.\n\nA: I get receipts by e-mail from Apple whenever I buy something in the iTunes store.  If you don't delete them they should still be there.\n\nA: When you get a receipt on your desktop or laptop you can click on 'Print' and then go down to PDF and find 'Save as Web Receipt' This will keep everything in one place all neat and tidy. :-)\n", "Q: Should I get a mini DisplayPort to DVI or HDMI to DVI adapter? I bought the new Retina MacBook Pro, which has an HDMI out and two Thunderbolt ports. I have an external display that I've been using that has a DVI input. Should I get the Thunderbolt/mini DisplayPort to DVI adapter or an HDMI to DVI adapter? Presumably, an HDMI adapter would be cheaper, because I wouldn't have to buy the Apple one. Is there a reason to go for mini DisplayPort instead?  I remember reading that DVI and HDMI are the same as far as video quality is concerned. Any other pointers or recommendations in this area are also appreciated. I guess one consideration could be that they are on opposite sides of the computer so I could pick the one that is on the side I plan to put the monitor. \nAnd yes, I do know that my old display will look like crap next to the retina display.\n\nA: Additionally, don't forget that Thunderbolt really means mini DisplayPort where video adapters are being considered. Since a DVI connection is required for your external display get something that will end in a DVI connection. Additionally don't forget to shop around for adapters, places like MonoPrice can help you save a bundle on adapters and Cables when compared to retail prices.\nSolutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mini DisplayPort to DVI adapter (from MonoPrice)\n\n*HDMI to DVI adapter (from MonoPrice)\n\nA: It should be noted that an adapter isn't even necessary, they generally add bulk because it's a device needed in addition to the cable. You should consider an HDMI to DVI cable (very common, simple, cheap) which just has those 2 connectors, and doesn't require extra bulk in the form of an adapter(hdmi's video is hardware compatable with dvi, the connector is just different).\n\nA: An alternative is to use the retina MacBook Pro's HDMI port and use a HDMI to DVI cable or HDMI to HDMI with a HDMI/DVI adapter. \n\nA: So I just noticed How many external displays can I power with the 15\" retina MacBook Pro?.  I actually have two displays that I can use, so I'm thinking that what I'll do is get one of each (since the ports are on opposite sides of the computer).  Thanks to all for the advice here.\n\nA: I would go for HDMI; when I connect an external monitor to the Thunderbolt port on my retina MacBook Pro, I loose my WiFi signal. I have no such problems when using HDMI.\nThe issue is discussed here https://discussions.apple.com/message/19380075\n", "Q: Lost audio while converting video files in OS X 10.7.4 I was using Lion's conversion feature to change .MPG video files to a compatible format (set by OS X).

But it only comes with a 256gbyte hard drive.  I probably use 30gbytes for all my data and 500gbytes for home videos (growing fast too).\nCan I easily attach a USB/thunderbolt external hard drive to store my videos through iPhoto when connecting my iPhone to my computer?  Is there a good solution to then back up that external hard drive on a cloud?  Dropbox and Google Drive are amazing backup solutions, but they cost so much money as I get closer to a terabyte and they don't seem to work with iPhoto so well.\nEvery 10 minute video from my iPhone takes up 2gbytes, this has to be a very common problem among parents...\n\nA: It's awkward to have iPhoto libraries on both internal and external disks. Aperture might be a better solution or you might want to just manage your videos outside of iPhoto instead.\nCrashplan has some inexpensive unlimited backup plans available. It also can do additional backups to another local machine or locally attached hard disk.\nMy personal practice is to have a local backup and a remote backup using two different technologies so I use Time Machine locally to a Mac Mini that's my home server (although a Time Capsule or local hard disk would work just as well) and Crashplan for remote backups. Having a local backup is much more convenient so the remote is strictly for major disasters.\n\nA: If you're only interested in backing up the data, I can't recommend BackBlaze highly enough. I'd tried Carbonite and Mozy with many little niggling issues and some larger flaws after several months use. I've been using BackBlaze for more than 2 years now and have restored data on several occasions, and migrated to 2 new systems with no problems. It's $5 per month for unlimited backup space.\nWorth pointing out though that you don't access it as a share or folder as you would with something like Dropbox or Google Drive. It's a client app which just manages backups.\nI use this in conjunction with Dropbox for all of my personal documents (I have 12gb from referrals now so that's enough for me) and Time Machine at home.\n", "Q: Plugging iPad into computer turns on Personal Hotspot with one connection I have an iPad 3 with personal hotspot turned on. I also have a Macbook Air connected to my local wireless network (the Air is not connected to the iPad personal hotspot). However, when I plug the iPad into my Macbook via USB, the iPad personal hotspot turns on and I see the blue bar at the top with one connection.  Can you explain why this is happening?  \nDid the Macbook stop using my local network wifi internet connection and start using the iPad's personal hotspot connection? Is this using up my cellular data allowance while I use the Macbook when the iPad is connected to the USB port?\n\nA: If you plug any cellular enabled iOS device with Personal Hotspot turned on to a Mac via USB, the Mac will automatically open a network connection using the Personal Hotspot.\nSo yes, your Macbook Air will be the 1 connection you see.\nThe second part of your question is a little trickier and the answer is both complex and confusing but I will try to explain as best I can.\n.\nBased on older knowledge with other multiple interface *nix systems is that it will be a complete toss up as to which connection your Mac will use since both active connections could possible provide the same route to the destination for any network query.\nI have even seen, on both Windows and Unix networks, traffic coming in on one network connection and going out on another, which rarely works well.\nTo get round this, in the Network panel you could disable the \"iPad USB\" in your default location, but then set up a new location where your \"iPad USB\" is not disabled.\nFinally, the order of your devices should mean that if your wifi is above the iPad USB device in your list when both are enabled, it will get priority over the hotspot, but there are still caveats and this could still use cellular data, but of a lesser amount.\n\nA: Just disable the hotspot from the iOS device when it's connected to the macbook.

My usage of the machine will be mostly for development work (MySQL, Eclipse, Xcode, Android, etc.). I will also be running Windows 7 with SQL Server in a virtual box or by using Boot Camp. My question is which upgrade will result in the most bang for the buck: more RAM or a faster processor? Does putting higher memory/processor make the machine run hotter?\n\nA: In general - the advice is to spend money on SSD first, then RAM, and lastly the CPU. Most consumers are not CPU bound running simulations or graphics rendering calculations. \nThe CPU is usually waiting for it's cache to be filled (from RAM) or the RAM to be filled (from storage) so it can idle down and not use the maximum clock speed and be hitting the max thermal generation/power use.\nIn practice, the CPU/RAM/SSD does not make a measurable difference unless you are running benchmarks that load the CPU/GPU perfectly. In actual use - having more RAM allows many programs to be in memory, so spending your money there might make more sense if you have many programs running at once or do Photoshop/Aperture photo editing of large images.\nThere are no bad choices in the current Air line - all are ridiculously fast compared to the Pro Macs from a generation back. Heck, my 2011 Air still is fast and responsive even next to the new retina MacBook Pro which has seriously more RAM and CPU/GPU. Yes the new IPS retina display is gorgeous even not considering the resolution, but the 11 inch Air's display is way better than most of remaining line up if you are looking for contrast or color fidelity and doing a lot of code work.\n\nA: With all that stuff you're running, you probably won't be happy with 4 GB of RAM. If it's truly an either/or decision, up the RAM unless you know that you won't be paging with only 4 GB. \nThe processor goes from a 1.8 GHz Core i5 to a 2.0 GHz Core i7. I'm not sure that's all that much of a noticeable increase.\nAs for temperature, Apple will put in a sufficiency of cooling regardless of the processor you choose. I don't really get why people get freaky about laptop heat output: any heat problem I've ever heard of is due to environmental factors that the user (not the manufacturer) has control over.\nAll that said, I got a 2012 MacBook Air with 8 GB RAM and the 2.0 GHz Core i7, and I'm super happy with it. It's noticeably faster than my previous, a 2011 Air with 4 GB RAM and the 1.8 GHz Core i7, but I suspect that's mostly the RAM and the better graphics between the 2011 and 2012 models. \ntl;dr: probably the RAM, maybe the processor. It all depends on how you're going to use the machine.\n\nA: The following are some stats of my MacBook Pro (4GB RAM, 2.3 GHz i5) right now. I'm using it for similar things you plan to use your Air for. I have a VM with Windows XP open, some Terminal windows, iTunes playing, Xcode, X11 running, and some Finder windows.\nThe CPU is more or less idle:\n\nBut check the RAM (yes, I have two 8GB sticks coming for an upgrade to 16GB :P):\n\nI think that you can see quite clearly where's the bottleneck. \nYou should definitely upgrade your RAM.\n\nA: This is how I think you should consider it:\n\n\n*\n\n*The extra .2 GHz (200,000,000) clock cycles that your CPU will perform every second are only actually useful if they are needed, otherwise they are running idle. You won't notice a difference until the 2 GHz processor starts cranking at about 90%, which would otherwise be the limit of the \"slower\" 1.8 GHz model.\n\n\nPercentage wise, the CPU is only an 11% boost noticeable only at very high usages\n\n\n*\n\n*The RAM upgrade, is an extra 4 GB, which will be useful most of the time, especially running VMs, which consume vast amounts of memory. This extra memory will be noticed much more, since it's effect kicks in beyond 50% usage, unlike the 90% CPU usage needed for the CPU upgrade to become advantageous,\n\n\nPercentage wise, the RAM is a 100% boost noticeable at mid range usage and up.\n\nA: In my experience, I just have the new macbook pro with 8G memory. And I am very happy with it for the development. I am mainly using eclipse, database, listen music and safari for my work and lots of other text editor. And I sometimes checked the memory usage and it seldom has the pageout. So I think you should just upgrade your memory from 4GB to 8GB and that would make you happy.\n\nA: This might sound counter productive, but given the non-upgradable nature of the MacBook Air hardware, I would very strongly suggest you save up for a wicked machine that will be future proof. I hope you don't end up in a situation where you regret not spending the extra buck now, but suffer from lower specced hardware for the entire useful life of the MBA.\nIn my case, I saved 3 years (as a teen) to buy a >$2,000 MacBook, and I'm still using it today, 4 years later, with quite solid hardware.\n\nA: I see no reason to buy RAM from Apple. After that, decide on the processor you need and get the right model. If you see you are getting many page outs get some memory from Amazon for few bucks.\nI can't tell much about the memory temps. I would guess with more memory you get less/no page outs which would probably make it cooler as it will work less but doubt its going to affect overall temps.\nCPU temps depends on model and use you got to look that up if its important.\n", "Q: Can I clone my existing MacOS and Windows partitions onto a new SSD in my Macbook Pro? I have a MacBook Pro (early 2012) with Lion and Windows 7 installed on the internal HDD. I use Bootcamp to swap between them when booting the machine.\nI want to replace the optical drive with an SSD. There are lots of instructions online, but my question is this: can I just install the SSD in the machine, then use Carbon Copy Cloner to copy my HDD to the SSD, then afterwards wipe the HDD to be partitioned as storage space? The HDD is 750Gb but the SSD is only 256Gb - but there is minimal data on the HDD at the moment.\nWhat I'm thinking of doing is:\n1. install the SSD in place of the optical drive.\n2. Clone the HDD to the SSD.\n3. Boot from the SSD (how?)\n4. Wipe and partition the HDD to be shared as storage space 50/50 Windows/Mac.\nThanks for your help,\nDavid\n\nA: Yes, you can use CCC to clone your OSX partition, but not the Windows/Bootcamp. (source: CCC Help). If you read that carefully, it says that it can clone the win partition, but won't make it work afterwards.\nTo clone and make your windows partition bootable, you need to rely on a Windows utility. Take a look at this thread (or google \"clone my bootcamp partition\") for a good starting point.\nBooting from the SSD will be a matter of putting the SSD in the machine and turn it on, if it's the only drive, it will boot from there. \n\nA: *\n\n*you already know how\n\n*yes CCC is fine for all OS X partitions. You can have a look at Winclone for the Bootcamp partition\n\n*open System Preferences -> Startup and choose your SSD partition. Alternatively, hold the option key alt at start, you will be prompted with a bootable partitions list\n\n*once you have cloned your data on the SSD and booted from it, you are free to do what you want with the HD\n\n", "Q: Move external HD to a new drive, but have Time Machine think it's the same? I have two external drives, one for data and one for Time Machine backups. Time Machine backs up both my internal HD and my external HD. My external HD is dying, so I bought a new one and plan to migrate the data over.\nIs it possible to somehow move the data to the new HD and still have Time Machine think that the new HD is the old one, since the data is the same? I usually just use Finder to move files from the old HD to new one (and then remove the old HD and rename the new one to use the same name), but from what I understand that wouldn't copy over the Time Machine data, however.\n\nA: Instead of using the finder to copy your files - use a program like 'carbon copy cloner' or 'super duper'.\nThis will get you the closest to the two drives being exactly the same.\nHowever, I should warn you that when I did this myself, I could not get Time Machine to treat the new drive as if it were the old drive. It insisted on keeping a backup of it as if it were a new drive. (however, in my case this was the OS internal drive and not an external data drive)\nIn the end I decided that it was OK that Time Machine didn't know it was the same drive, as I now had two copies of the data (before time machine even backed up) from the original flaky drive, and the new drive.\nI just had time machine back up the drive as if it were brand new.

How do I add a system link to the Applications folder and have it show up in spotlight.\nAlternatively how do I add a specific folder to spotlight search priority. Easy to rearrange but I can not add anything.\n\nA related question but not covering what I am interested in is:\nCan I make a symlink (to a .app folder) in Applications directory show up in spotlight?\n\nA: A Finder alias (not a symlink) will be added to spotlight, if it's sitting in a visible folder, like Applications.\nYou can create them programmatically using AppleScript (use osascript to integrate with other shell scripts.) \nTo create an alias use make alias file to {file to alias} at {destination of alias}.\nBy default (ie. if destination isn't specified) the alias is created on the current user's Desktop, ie. ~/Desktop.\nHere's an example script to create an alias of a file in /Applications\nset target_app to POSIX file \"/usr/path/to/app\"\nset alias_dest to POSIX file \"/Applications\"\n\ntell application \"Finder\"\n  make alias file to target_app at alias_dest\nend tell\n\nBy the way, osascript accepts input from stdin, so to run an AppleScript in a shell script, using a heredoc will work.  It may make it easier for you to setup the target file better:\n#!/bin/bash\nTARGET=/usr/path/to/app\nosascript <<EOS\n\nset target_app to POSIX file \"$TARGET\"\nset alias_dest to POSIX file \"/Applications\"\n\ntell application \"Finder\"\n  make alias file to target_app at alias_dest\nend tell\n\nEOS\n\n\nA: Unfortunately, it's not possible. Spotlight creates an index of everything (except the folders specified in the 'privacy' tab, seen on your screenshot). There is no way, to the best of my knowledge, to set priorities to specific folders. \nHowever, the spotlight index is updated regularly, and takes into account the results of previous searches. That means that by using regularly spotlight, you will improve it. \nPersonally, I think spotlight is a bit too restrictive. I use Quicksilver, a free launching, searching, do-it-all app. It's the first thing I install on a mac. Give it a try! You can customize almost everything, and there are simple ways to tweak the results of your searches. \nHope it helps. \n", "Q: What determines whether applications can broadcast to multiple AirPlay speakers?

This happens on both Safari and Firefox. My HP computer is working fine on this network and has no problem going on the Internet!\nI tried establishing a diagnosis and it says that apparently my connection is fine. I tried putting in a manual IP address but it didn't work so I don't know what to next! As far as I know I'm on 10.6.8, but I don't know which updates I've applied.\n\nA: This is going to be a starting point answer, hopefully you can find something strange while comparing the shots and fix the problem. \nIf you can connect to Skype that means you have connectivity, but your computer is unable to perform name resolution (that is, convert the address of a service -like a webpage- to an ip address). Skype may work because it relies less on DNS and instead uses its own discovery protocol, or the entries that Skype requires may be saved from previous sessions. \nIn any case, start by going to System Preferences and typing DNS in the top right corner: \n\nnote: the shots come from Lion (10.7.4), so you may see some differences\nNow tap on Network (I believe Snow Leopard was the same).\nYou should be in a page that has multiple tabs, so let's see the important ones: \nTCP/IP: let's see if you're using DHCP. If that's the case, then the DNS should be automatically set up for you, but this may not the working (some routers fail to provide this info or provide old info).\n\nThere isn't much to see here; I am using DHCP, so my network is automatically configured for me. Let's check the DNS.\n\nNow things get more interesting. I have two that correspond to OpenDNS (which you can use to test if you wish, they are free and open). One thing to note is that they are grayed out, meaning I can't change them. The reason behind this is because DHCP configured them for me. The real reason is because I have configured my router to provide these two DNS addresses to my computers and devices, so we all use a reliable service. But I could override this if I wanted by adding more (notice the plus symbol at the lower left corner). When you press that, you're given the option to type an IP address (use OpenDNS for this test or the Google servers: 8.8.8.8). Add just one, it's just a test. \nWhile we are here, we can check one more thing, Proxies. Go to the proxies tab and make sure that -unless instructed by a crazy network administrator- everything is unchecked, specially the first two. Look at it: \n\nAll right, you're all set, go ahead and test your machine by opening Safari and typing www.google.com, performing a search and then testing any of the results. \nWhat to do if this doesn't work? \nDespite the above, things can still not work, so don't panic yet. If that's the case take some time to provide us with some details about your network, for example: \nIP Address, Subnet Mask, Router, etc. etc. etc. \nWe can try to see what's going on from there. \n", "Q: How to delete leftover files from aborted migrations? I recently got a new MacBook Air and used Migration Assistant (henceforth abbreviated as MA) to transfer my stuff from my old MacBook Pro. However, until MA actually worked all the way, I had to abort it and restart both machines three times. This resulted in around 50GB of wasted space in my new macbook (but no extraneous user accounts, as I read elsewhere) that I don't know how to eliminate. I assume there are some cache files that MA creates & uses until the entire migration is complete. \nWhere can I find these files, to delete the leftover ones from the incomplete migrations?\n\nA: For me it was in /var/folders/zz/, but all you need to do to reclaim space is reboot your computer and it gets deleted automagically for you.\n\nA: You could use OmniDiskSweeper (free to download and use) to search for and remove big folders. To find the problematic area fast, run it in parallel on both your macs (to see the differences) and start at the top level.\nIf you don't want to install additional software, you can start by running du -sg /* on both Macs, drilling down into the directories with the biggest difference and repeating du until you found the problematic files.\n", "Q: Where to find Apple product images I am looking for some current, high quality Apple product images for my website, anyone know a good source?\n\nA: Apple Press Info contains a bunch of pictures you can probably use.

The Apple trademark page is a good place to start and contains wording that you cannot use Apple images without express written permission, but the contact information is also provided in this link to ask for that permission.

If you have two remote locations in Transmit 4, say an S3 and an FTP location, and you move a file between these two locations, Transmit will automatically download that file, and then upload it.\nWhere does Transmit 4 store these temporary files?\n\nA: The opensnoop program is remarkably useful, but to answer the actual question in case somebody is in a quick bind, for Transmit 4 the location of the temporary files is:\n/Volumes/<Macintosh HD>/Users/<current user>/Library/Caches/Cleanup At Startup/Transmit/server-to-server-B18AC7A9-81C6-4AAD-8F2C-6CD70E65D7FD/data-file-being-transferred\n\nTransmit appears to clean up after itself within a second or two of the upload completing.

This works fine. Now I want to move songs from my large iTunes library into the new library and just have one library shared across the two computers\nI'm not afraid of the command line, but I wanted the easy way to do it.\n\nA: The easiest way to do this is with iTunes.\nTurn on Home Sharing for your iTunes account and enable the feature in iTunes on your NAS-connected machine and on your machine you wish to use as a source for material to copy.\nStart iTunes on both machines.\nFrom the MacBook Air machine, look for your other iTunes library under the SHARED section in the left-hand list of iTunes.

Select 'Music' to show all the music in that library:\n\nSelect all the music in that library by clicking on the top song in the list and pressing Cmd-A to select everything:\n\nNow click the 'Import' button in the bottom right corner:\n\niTunes will copy all the music from your large library in to your MacBook Air's library, storing the data on your NAS. You can speed the process along by doing the copy over a wired network connection instead of WiFi.\nYou can repeat this process for all content in the remote library, not just music.\n", "Q: Is there an easy way to clear/empty the clipboard? I would like to find a combination of keys to clear the contents of the clipboard or better yet an application that can configure a timer to clear it automatically one minute after last paste operation.\n\nA: Yes, you have a choice of three built in methods for clearing the clipboard.\nAppleScript/Automator are two simple methods for programmatically manipulating the clipboard.\nHere's a little script that does what you want.\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    try\n        set the clipboard to \"\"\n    on error err_message\n        display dialog err_message\n    end try\nend tell\n\nAlso, Automator allows the same. You'll need to define a variable, double click on the name text to set it to null, and then drag in the set clipboard action before running / saving it. The benefit of using automator is that you can assign it as a service and then use system keyboard shortcuts to call it.\n\nFor AppleScript or one of the nice terminal answers here that use pbpaste you might want to look at a free tool like FastScripts to launch the action from anywhere.\n\nA: This terminal command replaces the clipboard with an empty string: \necho -n '' | pbcopy\n\nYou could put this in a script, then use cron or make a launchdaemon to automate the execution and timing.\nCredit for the solution goes to: ShadowOfGed @ Applenova Fora \n\nA: https://langui.net/clear-clipboard/\n\nClear Clipboard allows you to clear the clipboard content manually or\nautomatically, preventing your clipboard data from being peeped while\nyou are absent.\nYou can chose to clear the clipboard content every few seconds and\nenable clearing clipboard on computer sleep / display sleep / screen\nlock to maximize protection of your sensitive clipboard data.\n\n\nA: To set a combination of keys to clear the clipboard, you can create a Service using Automator.\nYour service will have a single action, Run Shell Script\nThe shell script you will use is this:\n pbcopy </dev/null\n\n\nThen save the service and assign it a keystroke using System Preferences » Keyboard » Keyboard Shortcuts » Services.\n\nThe challenge of an application that automatically clears the clipboard one minute after the last paste operation is that said application would have to monitor all the copy and paste events across all applications; presumably you would want the action cancelled if you pasted and then copied new text (you wouldn't want to clear the new content from the clipboard one minute after the last paste of the previous clipboard contents). Such a program could be written, but implementing it with AppleScript or Automator would be a challenge.\n", "Q: Photo indexing software for Mac OS X 10.5.8 with the ability to upload to a photo printer / sharing service? I want to scan old color slides using a Nikon Coolscan on Mac OS X Version 10.5.8.  I want a program that will allow me to index these files and add descriptions, dates, locations and other information.  I would like this program to upload to an image sharing service like Picasa, Flickr, or Shutterfly so that I can print them out and share them with others but also keep them private.  I don't want third parties to be able to copy and print them.  \n\nA: That's precisely what iPhoto is for.  Google has discontinued the Picasa exporter for iPhoto, but there are numerous other exporters including:\nFlickr exporter, and an exporter for Shutterfly. \n", "Q: Which app will help me remove limitations on DVDs? I purchased an exercise DVD that was created by a local health practitioner. Whoever created the DVD for her used some wonky settings that prevent me from being able to go into fast-forward mode on my DVD player. The DVD is not copy-protected.\nIs there a Mac program that I can get that will let me make a copy of the DVD but without silly settings such as \"no fast forwarding\"?\n\nA: I have found MacDVDRipperPro to work very well for me. It also removes the protection on dvd's.\n\nA: You mean a DVD protection remover? I believe many tools have been designed for this purchase so far. From my opinion, I prefer dvdaid since it has successully copied all my DVD collection. No need for the original disc anymore.\n\nA: Try MakeMKV, I use it to rip DVDs and Blu Rays to a single MKV file.\nI then use Handbrake to rip the MKV to an MP4 file.\nI then use MetaZ to tag the files appropriately.  This includes cover art, year, genre, description, etc.  If you're watching your content on an AppleTV, these are the only tags you need to worry about.\nAs they're MP4 files, they drag and drop right into iTunes and play on my AppleTV.\n", "Q: Better Way To Show Running Applications in OS X Lion I'm looking to either find a better method (visually) to show running applications on my Macbook Pro. The easiest method would be to increase the size (or make more prominent) of the running program indicator(s) that are present on OS X dock:\n\nAlternatively I would be open to some other method that provides the same \"at a glance\" feedback as to what is running without having to manually launch a process.\nI have looked at a lot of Apple related blogs and Google'd around to no avail. I could obviously increase my stock resolution of 1920 x 1200 to something larger but overall I am very happy with this resolution so I would prefer an alternate method. I also really have no desire to hook up to a larger monitor.\n\nA: The easiest way to do this (in my mind) is to not have any applications permanently stored in your Dock.  In other words, the only applications down there are running ones. (This is what I do, and it works great; I can at-a-glance see what's running without having to use cmd-tab).\nThat being said, OS X is moving in the direction of \"you shouldn't have to care\".  Things like Sudden Termination and User Interface preservation are aiming to make it so that a process can disappear silently in the background, but quickly come back when you need it.\n\nA: The easiest method for foreground applications is to press ⌘-TAB. It requires interaction, but it is visual and it doesn't take reworking Apple's interface.  \nAnother approach is to simply enlarge the size of the dock. \n\nSystem Preferences -> Dock -> Size\n\n\nA: TinkerTool (free)\nYou can use TinkerTool to disable the 3D Dock effekt while the Dock is at the bottom (just like when the dock is on the left/right side).\n\nCandyBar (free trial)\nYou can also use Candybar to customize the look of the dock.\n\n\nA: DragThing\nI use a commercial program called DragThing, which has been around since the early days of Mac OS X and is still in development. Among its many other features, it includes a floating palette in the upper corner of your screen that shows just the programs that are currently running and also lets you click on an icon to bring that program to the forefront. This is in fact an emulation of a feature in the user interface from Apple's Mac OS 9, if you go back far enough to remember that.\n\n\nA: Are you familiar with things like command-tab or Mission Control (F3/gesture/dock icon), which has been designed with exactly what you want in mind?\nAlternatively, what you could do is simply \"unpin\"/remove all of your Applications' icons from the Dock. Then an icon will only appear there for currently running applications.\n", "Q: Home folder different than account name I have to edit this question after spending a frustrating (frightening?) afternoon looking at this friend's computer. \nHe is older and quite vulnerable (he just lost his wife), but he is mac-literate, having used them for years. He relies on his photo albums - he is a well known architect.\nAnyway, he bought a new machine some months ago, and hired a local consultant to set up the machine and migrate his files from his old system.\nThe user accounts are set up so that \"consultant\" is the account name.\nThe user part of the file system looks something like this:\n/Users/consultant/files\n/Users/friend/files/files\nAll files (documents, images, etc) are owned by consultant.\n(The frightening part is that the consultant (who has skipped town), left an open login so he can connect anytime, without any kind of password control).\nSo, my question is this: I need a reality check on how to proceed. Copy the user files to an external drive? Script? What about the accounts?\nIs there something else to check?\nI want the files to end up in:\n/Users/friend/\ni would welcome any more advice (shell scripts, methods, etc).\nA friend has a iMac which has been recently set up by a consultant. I found that the home folder doesn't match the name of the user account name—rather, it's the name of the consultant (grrrh).\nIs this a problem? Should I rebuild the system? Add a new user account?\n\nA: The Apple Support Knowledgebase is your friend.\nThere are a few steps needed to change the homefolder name, requiring logging in as the root user, which requires that the root user be enabled and then disabled when the task completed.\nThe process is much simpler in 10.5 or greater and is a bit more cumbersome in 10.4 and earlier.\n\nA: Just to finish this question, I finally got the computer fixed, but it was harder than the Apple Knowledgebase would suggest. While that worked fine to bring over all user files, it did not seem to bring the ~/Library. I had to build this manually. That is, reload the ApplicationSupport, Preferences and other folders. It was tedious. Maybe I made mistakes on the way, but I really tried to follow the steps as outlined in the Apple document.\nThe second thing that did not work was the Keychain access. The way the document is written, it appears that you only have to fuss with KA when using 10.4. That's incorrect. Keychain Access has to be updated to reflect the new user information. This was on a 10.7.4 system.\nAnyway, thanks for all the advice. I hope the client appreciates what has happened.\n", "Q: Data Backup/Storage Using an NAS with Mac OS X and Windows It's probably not pertinent, but I'm a Mac user since the 1980's. I freely confess that as a middle-aged dog I find it increasingly harder to keep up with the latest and greatest in available Apple technology.\nI also use Windows and for the last six years or so my main desktop was a Windows XP system. I have files spread over three different HDDs on this machine.\nI now have a 2011 iMac running Lion and Windows 7 and I am gradually migrating to this machine. I'd like to be able to keep applications on the internal HDD and data-- documents, photos, and so forth-- on an external HDD. I have considered buying this drive and partitioning it (half for Windows, half for Mac), but before I throw any money at this I thought maybe I should ask the wise folks here what they think of this idea. \nI also have a related question. I recently upgraded to a new router, and it has a USB port, so I was thinking to attach a separate external HDD to the router and use it for Time Machine. I'm also wondering about the wisdom of this.\nThanks in advance for any helpful replies.\n\nA: In order to use the drive for both purposes, you would need to partition it into two. In my breakdown below, partition 1 is for moving data and partition 2 is for Time Machine, but this can be swapped around if you prefer.\nI would recommend formatting the partition on which you access data on in ExFAT. It is newer than FAT and does not have the 4GB file size limit. It can be read and written to on both Mac (Snow Leopard and later) and Windows (Vista and later, XP with a supplementary download). This allows for easy transfer between both platforms. \nI would read up on the formats that the router supports, as I cannot access an ExFAT drive connected to it. If that does not work, the best option for connecting from both platforms is FAT, but keep in mind that there is a 4GB file limit.\nThe other partition can then be formatted in the HFS+J format as Ethan mentioned in his comment. \nIn order to get the drive working remotely, I first set mine up on my Mac and started a backup. I then cancelled this and deleted it. I then attached it to my Airport Extreme and then browsed to it through Finder. I needed to access the drive before Time Machine would pick it up (on both my iMac and Air). I cannot say whether the router you link to will work in the same way or not. Please be aware that the way I am doing it is not recommended or supported by Apple and if you do a similar approach, you do so at your own risk.\n\nA: The G-drive is targeted at professional who needs a rugged enclosure.\nFor the same amount of money you can get a NAS with Time Machine support. Search for names like Synology/Thecus/WD/Seagate - pick what you like/need.\nFor my personal needs I just have a HP microserver and put Linux on it - works really well.\n\nA: Partition your disk locally first. You can't partition it while its on the network (easily).  Use Disk Utility, click the name of your drive (not a partition) and go to the Partition tab.  Click the + and adjust the size as you wish. Then, name it and change the format to MS-DOS (FAT).  Click Apply to apply your changes.\nThen, adding onto Alain's answer, here is a detailed explanation and instructions in Terminal on how to setup a network-attached storage device with Time Machine. \nIt's more complicated than it might seem, but here's a rundown of the steps provided by the above link:\n\nMake sure that the network device is mounted. Then, open Finder and at the menu bar, click Go > Network.  Double-click your storage device and enter any authentication details if needed.\nYou'll need to find the name of your computer on the network. Go to System Preferences > Sharing and make a note of what it says as \"Computer Name.\" \nEnter Terminal. You can find it in /Applications/Utilities.\nRun defaults write com.apple.systempreferences TMShowUnsupportedNetworkVolumes 1 to allow Time Machine to work with devices that it normally doesn't.\nNext, we'll need to find the MAC address of your computer.  Run ifconfig en0 | grep ether\nThe output should look like ether XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX - make a note of everything after ether.\nNext, we'll have to create a .sparsebundle for Time Machine. Read this carefully, as this is a pivotal step in the setup process. \nStill in Terminal, run hdiutil create -size 100g -fs HFS+J -volname \"Time Machine\" NAME_XXXXXXXXXXXX.sparsebundle - where NAME is the name of your computer (all spaces will be dashes) and the X's are your MAC address without colons.\nAlso, make sure that the -size argument is the space you want to create for your Time Machine.  This will make the partition in HFS+J however large you want. In this particular command example, we have created a 100 GB partition for Time Machine.\nYou can replace -size 100g with anything you want ( 50g, 150g, even OVER 9000g [but only if your NAS has this much capacity])\nNext, run rsync -aE NAME_XXXXXXXXXXXX.sparsebundle /Volumes/DRIVE/. - where DRIVE is the name of your storage drive. Remember that NAME is your computer name with dashes and the X's are your MAC address without colons. \nYou can also simply type rsync -aE NAME_XXXXXXXXXXXX.sparsebundle and drag in your network drive icon from Finder; it'll automatically enter its name after. This step might take a few moments. Wait for it to finish; you'll know when it prints Your-Mac-Name:~ Username$ again.\nFinal Terminal command: rm -rf NAME_XXXXXXXXXXXX.sparsebundle to remove the copy of the .sparsebundle from your computer.  After this, you can close Terminal (whew).\nYou can start backing up as normal now. Go to System Preferences > Time Machine and click Choose Backup Disk... and select your network drive.\nAlthough it will show the drive's full capacity, Time Machine will be limited to the size specified in the step where you ran hdiutil create by the -size argument.\nTime Machine will start backing up. \n\nA: In case someone else is searching for answers to the same question, I thought I should leave a record of what I ended up doing.\nI got a Synology DS212j NAS and put a couple of 2TB Western Digital Red drives in it.\nI can back up my Apple computers on the OS X and Windows 7 partitions since the Synology NAS supports both Time Machine and backup from Windows (using the software supplied by Synology with the NAS).\nIn late 2012/early 2013 the total cost was around $450, including shipping.\n====================== August 2017 Update ======================\nWell, four years later my 2TB Synology DS212j is still working well. I've backed up a number of computers, both Windows and Mac, on it with minimal hassle. Since my main desktop just died about a week ago, I've now had an opportunity to make use of my backups, and here's what I have learned.\nBackstory, my main desktop is/was a mid-2011 iMac 27\" machine, in which the graphics card died a short time ago. A family member had a similar vintage 21.5\" iMac which needed to be replaced a few weeks before that. Using an AirPort Time Capsule, it was very quick to restore everything using Migration Assistant on the replacement for the 21.5\" machine. When my 27\" iMac died, I decided to replace it, and set about using Migration Assistant to restore everything on the successor machine, a 2017 iMac 27\". For some reason, pulling data off the Synology DS212j is much slower than pulling it off the AirPort Time Capsule. I don't recall what Migration Assistant what transfer speeds I got from the AirPort Time Capsule, but I sure noticed when Migration Assistant reported the transfer speeds off the Synology DS212j were around 7MB/second, and only 15MB/second when I bypassed my network and connected it directly to the new iMac with an ethernet cable.\nAnyway, the Synology DS212j is still fine, so I plan to keep using it for Windows 10 backups, but I popped for a new AirPort Time Capsule to use on the Mac machines. I will definitely consider buying another Synology when the time comes, and it did achieve what I wanted, which was backing up both Windows and Apple machines on the same NAS.\n\nA: Format as FAT32 and it can be read by both Windows and Mac OS X.  I do not know if Time Machine works with FAT32 as it stores less details with the file.\n", "Q: How can I delete Mail.app's cached e-mails that are saved to disk in OS X Lion? I am running out of some disk space, and noticed Mail has about 30GB of emails stored.\nWhat is the best way to delete these emails? I don't need them as a server has a copy.\n\nA: Go to Mail -> Preferences -> Accounts\n\n\n*\n\n*Choose the mail account  \n\n*Choose the advanced tab  \n\n*Change the status of \"Keep Copies of message for offline viewing\" to \"Don't keep...\"\n\n\nApples's documentation does not say what happens when you change the status, but goes on to state:\n\nIt’s recommended to use the default selection (“All messages and their attachments”) so you can search entire messages. Additionally, keeping copies of messages on your computer improves junk mail filtering and includes the messages in Time Machine backups.\n\n\nA: Same thing happened to me. I went to ~/Library/Mail/V2 and deleted everything (actually copied to up to My Documents for later import). That let me open Mail.app. I then deleted the exchange account and create it again.\n", "Q: Stop iPhone from reacting to Apple remote My iPhone, when docked, reacts to the Apple remote. I cannot find the setting to disable the behaviour. Any idea where the setting is?\n\nA: The answer to your problem is actually in the manual for your Universal Dock. The link is for a recent model.  Pairing should be the same for many.  Consult the manual for your model if in doubt. Following the instructions in the manual. \nThe best approach is to pair the dock with a particular remote so that it only responds to a single remote. if you have a spare remote (sounds like you do) then choose one of them and pair it with your dock.  \nIf this is not an option, then you'll need to physically block the infrared receiver on the dock to keep it from \"seeing\" any remotes. \nYet another option: take the dock out of the situation.  Plug your phone in directly via an iPhone cable.  \n", "Q: Which 8GB iPod touch do not support iOS 5? I wanted to upgrade the software to iOS 5 through iTunes but I've never been able to get past iOS 4.2.1 so I waited for a year to see if Apple release another update yet. \nI purchased the iPod touch 3rd Generation 8GB 2.5 years ago as I saw in Apple press release that Apple was releasing a new iPods model lineup. My local authorized store did advertised it as 3rd Generation 8GB. The part number was MC086ID/A, yet the seller assured me that it indeed was a 3rd Generation, because the 2nd Generation 8GB had MB part number. As I recalled, the 3rd Gen iPods may receive upgrade up to iOS 5.1.1.\nI live 3 hours away from an Apple authorized reseller and there are no Apple Retail stores in my country. Is it possible that iOS 5.1.1 can't be received without authorized support in some countries?\n\nA: I will attempt to straighten all this out. Apple has a nice tool to enter a serial number into a web site and it will look up what model you have for you.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://support.apple.com/manuals/#\nYou can even paste your serial number after the # sign above rather than pasting it into the search field. This is generally all you need to determine which generation of device you are being sold or have been sold.\nThe simple answer for OS levels for a specific device is to trust iTunes to always update a device if it is capable of a newer OS than it detects: If you connect your iPod touch to iTunes on a Mac or PC and click on the \"Check for Update\" button, and it does not indicate that there is a new iOS update for your iPod touch, then your iPod touch is already running the most recent version of iOS that it can run. Thus, it cannot run iOS 5.1.\nI own a 4th Generation 8GB iPod touch, model MC540LL, and it does indeed run iOS 5.1.1. So it is not true that there is no 8GB iPod touch that can run iOS 5.1.1.\nIt appears from MrDaniel's link to everymac.com that the 8GB iPod touch owned by @Harriz_shiddiq does not run anything higher than iOS 4.2.1. Here is further evidence:\nAccording to the complete history of model releases of the iPod touch, there is no such thing as a 3rd Generation iPod touch in the 8GB size. The 3rd Generation of the iPod touch only exists in 32GB and 64GB sizes. You can see for yourself in the internet archive's way back machine by examining the treatment of the model comparisons at the bottom of this page. The tech specs make you choose between identically sized models (visually identical externally) to see the specs for the 8GB model for sale or the 32/64 GB model for sale. The latter ones allow for headphones with remotes - the former ones do not. As far as I can tell, this also is a nice way to tell apart 3rd gen and later iPod touch as they can all use headphones with Apple remotes. All 2nd generation devices can not.\nThe downloadable free app MacTracker provides a database of comprehensive specifications of all the iPod touch models along with their chronological release history. From using this app, I've found the following information.\n\n\n*\n\n*September 2007: iPod touch 1st Generation in 8GB and 16GB sizes (iOS 3.1.3 maximum)\n\n*February 2008: iPod touch 1st Generation in 32GB (iOS 3.1.3 maximum)\n\n*September 2008: iPod touch 2nd Generation (MB model designation) in 16GB and 32GB  (iOS 4.2.1 maximum)\n\n*September 2009: iPod touch 3rd Generation in 32GB and 64GB (iOS 5.1.1 or latest)\n\n*September 2009: iPod touch 2nd Generation (MC model designation) in 8GB (iOS 4.2.1 maximum)\n\n*September 2010: iPod touch 4th Generation in 8GB, 32GB and 64GB (iOS 5.1.1 or latest)\n\n*October 2011: iPod touch 4th Generation in 8GB, 32GB and 64GB in white color (iOS 5.1.1 or latest)\n\n\nI cannot find Apple model number MC086ID/A, reported by Harriz_shiddiq, within the MacTracker database. MacTracker reports that there were two Apple model numbers for the 2nd Generation 8GB iPod touch: MB528LL/A, released September 2008, and MC086LL/A, released in September 2009.\n\nA: MrDaniel above is quite right but I have something more to tell you.\n\n\n*\n\n*The part number you mentioned above belongs to Indonesia region. All MC086ID iPods are definitely a  2nd Geneneration iPod. MC iPods are produced as the latest batch of 2nd Gen iPod touch, while the MB models were the earlier batch. Hence, iPod touch 8GB MC models should be classified as a 2nd Generation iPod (limited update to iOS 4.1.2) because it has model number of A1288.\n\n*Besides, in the link given by MrDaniel above, Apple advertised the 32GB & 64GB models are 50% faster than the previous model, which is the 2nd Generation models in this case. These newer models were also shipped with different earphone while the 8GB models were shipped similarly as the previous models. This means that Apple itself effectively classified the 8GB MC models as the previous model a.k.a 2nd Gen model. \nFinally, I might sound dissapointing but the answer to your first question is that you might have been misled because the seller was not aware of the discrepancy.\nFor your second question, you should go to the same store, not for an update installation, but to hold them responsible for their informing you incorrectly (either on purpose or by mistake). You could ask for a discount for purchasing a new iPod touch 4G as compensation.\n\nA: The iPod touch 3G 8GB (also known as iPod touch 2G 8GB MC model) cant run iOS 5.\nAccording to everymac's specs the iPod touch 3rd Generation 8GB can only go to iOS 4.2.\n\nAlthough they originally were sold as a single lineup with 8 GB, 32 GB, and 64 GB of storage, this 8 GB model effectively is the same as the 8 GB configuration of the iPod touch 2nd Generation and does not fully support iOS 4. \n\nLastly iTunes knows best, if you try to update the iPod touch with the latest version of iTunes and it fails to find any new updates your device, it is already up to date to its most current OS version.\n\nA: I'll have to disagree with MrDaniel. iPod touch 3rd Gen has iOS 5.1 support, well that's actually their last. You should first consult http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod_touch and http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1353 and you'll see what I meant. \nPaul Schiller himself had presented in September 2009 Special event (you could search the youtube) that iPod 3G will be released ONLY in 32GB and 64GB models. In his presentation, he put the 8GB model aside while explaining that 32GB and 64GB models will be having better performance and gaming support.\nWhat about the 8GB models ? \n\n\n*\n\n*It was meant to be re-released along with the new 3G iPods but with a lower price of US$199 at that time (it was $229 before). He said that Apple would lower the price of the previously released iPod touch 8GB. That's all. He never stated that 8GB models would be received performance upgrade which its siblings received. \n\n\nHence, there's no reason to take this matter with your local store unless you were sure that you were misinformed to believe that the 8GB MC model was totally similar to the 32&64GB models.\n\nA: The chronological release of iPod touch from MacTracker posted by Wheat Williams seems to contain some contradictory information. From the data of wikipedia and http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1353, here's what I found :\nSeptember 2007: iPod touch 1st Generation in 8GB and 16GB sizes (iOS 3.1.3 maximum)\nFebruary 2008: iPod touch 1st Generation in 32GB (iOS 3.1.3 maximum)\nSeptember 2008: iPod touch 2nd Generation MB model in 8GB, 16GB and 32GB (iOS 4.2.1 maximum)\nSeptember 2009: iPod touch 3rd Generation in 32GB and 64GB (iOS 5.1.1 maximum)\nSeptember 2009: iPod touch 2nd Generation MC model in 8GB (iOS 4.2.1 maximum)\nSeptember 2010: iPod touch 4th Generation in 8GB, 32GB and 64GB (iOS 5.1.1 or latest)\nOctober 2011: iPod touch 4th Generation in 8GB, 32GB and 64GB in white color (iOS 5.1.1 or latest)\n\niPod touch 3rd Gen itself were released in 32GB and 64GB capacity (with the same price of the 2nd Gen 16GB and 32GB) in September 2009 along with the another re-introduced 8GB iPod touch 2nd Gen (with lower price than the 2008-release of 2nd Gen 8GB)\n@BadBoyz31, I've seen the video of the September 2009 release and indeed, Steve Jobs said that iPod touch 3G would be released only in 32 and 64 GB models. The 8GB models would only be re-released with a lower price, hence, logical deduction would classified the 8GB models to be re-released as a 2G model. So Badboyz31, you should've deducted that the 8GB MC models are 2G iPods/\nIndeed, I must admit that many people would find that the 8GB 3rd Gen iPod to be quite a deal since Apple lowered its price in addition to a \"confusion\" as a result of blurry apple press release, misinformed stores, and a tight release date. \nHowever, an iPod touch 2G MB models at that time were about 20-40% cheaper which offering the same capabilities as a iPod touch 2G MC model. Many people were interested to own the MC model because they think that the MC model would have received upgrades compared to the 2nd Gen MB model. However, ethically speaking, as an Authorized store, I think its mandatory to explain the difference between the 2G MC iPods and the 3G iPods. \nHad they not give you what you were asking for, you have the rights to demand discount (75% would be fair considering your trouble), for a 4G iPods (I agreed with dOom_bah for this matter)\n\nA: First look into Trying to get things clear with iPod touch 3rd Gen 8GB MC model.\nI think the guy there also looking for the same answer as you do.\nBut I'd better answer it myself :\n\n*\n\n*The most important thing is to identify whether you have the right iPod or not. See the back of your iPod for some fine texts. You should find a A1288 or A1318 there. A1288 means that your iPod is an iPod 2G (4.1.2 max) while A1318 means an iPod 3G (5.1.1 max)\n\n\n*Make sure to register your product's serial number to Apple website so you may get the idea of which iPod you're having.\n\n\n*I'm sorry to tell you that if you purchased that iPod during 09/2009 - 07/2010, you'll most likely to be misled to buy a re-released iPod touch 2G 8GB. Many stores did not heed apple support page and the press release, and probably the Steve Jobs' September 2009 presentation in order to get accurate information.\n\n\n*If you carefully paid attention to the presentation, you may see that Apple put the 8GB away from the remaining 32GB & 64GB iPods, claiming it to be 50% faster and OpenGL support. Here you can see that, the only change given to the 8GB model was a lower price but the 32GB and 64GB models got better hardware and internal capacity.\nI assumed you purchased the iPod from an Authorized reseller in Indonesia then it might be late-informed/misinformed during that time. Nevertheless, you should only try for a compensation (even a free new iPod) if the seller there said that the 8GB MC model was the same, except in terms of capacity, with the 32GB and 64GB iPods.\n", "Q: Move files from CineXPlayer to OPlayer on iPad? I have found myself in quite a difficult position; before travelling I transfered some movies in the .MKV-format to my iPad-app CineXPlayer, unknowing that that app could not play that file.\nNow I have no computer that I can use to transfer to another app, OPlayer for iPad, but fortunately, CineXPlayer offers an easy way to transfer files from device to device - unfortunately for me, I don't have two devices. It works by letting you access your files through your iPad's local IP-address via port 8080, and accessing it from an iPhone works fine, but not from the same iPad. Any ideas how I can do this?\nAny other ideas as to how I can transfer the files from app to app? Both feature a download-function with a browser, so if I could access the local 8080-port, I should be able to transfer the files internally.\nThanks for any and all help/ideas/thoughts!\n\nA: If it is jailbroken, nothing could be simpler. Use iFile (downloadable from Cydia store). If it is not, tough luck, I have no idea. You might make it with FileBrowser from the AppStore, but no promises here. Good luck!\n\nA: If jailbroken use iFile, just cut and paste from/to\nFiles on CineXplayer are on:\n/private/var/mobile/Applications/18BA69CC-B03C-416F-A85E-84B0CD75E020/Documents\n\nFiles on OPlayerHD are on:\n/private/var/mobile/Applications/14BEB5AF-1363-4BB7-861A-5AE0FAD08017/Documents\n\nGood luck with this starting point to mapping apps to storage on the filesystem.\n\nA: iFile is the way to go. However, the folder names above with all the number are out of date. You don't need new numbers. Just go to settings in iFile and choose \"Show app name\". Then you can easily find the apps you want to move files between using copy and paste.\n", "Q: How do I avoid inadvertently switching workspaces? I keep accidentally dragging windows into other workspaces on my Macbook Air running OS X Lion.\nCan I disable dragging into other workspaces or make doing so more difficult?\n\nA: There's a hidden preference for adjusting the delay in seconds:\ndefaults write com.apple.dock workspaces-edge-delay -float 0.5\nosascript -e 'quit app \"Dock\"'\n\nIt can be set to an arbitrarily high value to disable dragging windows to other spaces.\n\nA: TinkerTool has this option in the Applications tab, Mission Control, Delay when dragging window to adjacent space: Default / Short / No Delay.\nNo Delay was selected on my computer, but I don't remember if I chose that at some point. I looked into this because I wanted the \"windows aero snap\" feature, I just found and installed Cinch by Irradiated Software. The Spaces \"swipe\" would happen before Cinch was able to do its thing.\n\nA: With the Warp pref-pane, you can set a delay and/or require a modifier key(s) to allow a space change.\n", "Q: How can I manually replace the addressBook files on my iPhone? I upgraded from iOS 4 to iOS 5 and after it installed, I realized my contacts and apps were no longer there. I'm not too concerned about retrieving my apps, but I would really like to retrieve my contact list.\nI looked at the files from my last sync and used the iPhone Backup Extractor tool to get all of the files from my sync. There I found my 'AddressBook.sqlitedb' and 'AddressBookImages.sqlitedb' files. I jail broke the iPhone and installed iFile so I can get at the files on the iPhone. When I try to edit the current 'AddressBook.sqlitedb' file with the contents of the old one, it doesn't seem to affect the contact list.\nHow can I retrieve my old Contact List?\n\nA: The best way is to syncronize with your computer's address book.\nDid you not do a backup before upgrading?  Either way, when you tell your phone to sync your address book, it will get the contacts out of your outlook or Apple address book.\n", "Q: Is it necessary to disconnect the battery when installing new RAM in the early 2011 MacBook Pro? I want to install additional RAM to my early 2011 MacBook Pro.\nI originally was only looking at the official Apple guide, but then while searching for a better screwdriver I found the iFixit guide, which tells you to disconnect the battery.\nIs this necessary? Apple's guide doesn't mention it.\n\nA: I just did it without disconnecting the battery and it works fine, so disconnecting the battery is not needed.\n\nA: In case your computer is really shut down it's not necessary since memory is not powered.\nI believe ifixit instruction tend to be on safe side: for example this one is just to be sure that memory is really not powered and computer not just in sleep mode accidentally.\n", "Q: Bootcamp won't run on OSX in RAID0 I have my MacPro booting into Lion off a 3 disk (software) RAID 0 array. I want to dedicate a fourth drive to Windows 7 via Bootcamp. However it won't run at all on my system, exiting with a 'RAID is not supported' message.\nIs there a way around this? Or a reliable, easy-to-use third-party bootloader like grub or similar I can use to set-up a dual-boot?\n\nA: Preliminarily, these guides may help:\nhttp://alexgarlock.com/macbook-pro-2011-raid-0-with-bootcamp/\nhttp://huguesval.com/blog/2012/02/installing-windows-7-on-a-mac-without-superdrive-with-virtualbox/\nRead the top one first - and yes I know it's a bit confusing the way he writes it (it doesn't make complete sense to me either, but at least points in some direction).  And yes, they don't completely answer your specific question, but they do provide helpful guidance in the form of pointing you towards the right direction...and perhaps a bit more.\nActually, I'm just about to try all this in a few minutes - I'll try to relay the outcome.\nThen, if I get bootcamp to work in RAID-0 mode...the final challenge is hacking the EFI boot that your Bootcamped windows is stuck with - so I can emulate a bios setting in the EFI that allows me to switch to AHCI mode in bootcamp.  I've successfully done this before, and it turned bootcamp into a POWERHOUSE.  The difference was sickening.\nIf any users are interested in also doing the above I suggest you start here and read as much of the thread as you can.\nhttp://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/126089-howto-boot-macs-with-intel-chipset-in-ahci-win7-vista-xp-linux/page-7#entry1498839\nAssuming I get there...the tricky part will genuinely be stacking both of these ridiculous things simultaneously.\nI havn't yet found anything anywhere that addresses or even mentions my above proposed \"bootcamp-super-stack\" about stacking a RAID-0 running in AHCI mode in Bootcamp.  \nLet's see how this adventure turns out.\n\nA: I've been thinking about this, as I have the same problem.\nWhat if you created 3 partitions when setting up your machine? One for OS X, one for the recovery partition and one for Windows...?\nYou'd have to slice each hard drive into 3 and then create each RAID separately, but it might work.\nThe only way I've solved this is to run Parallels and install windows on an external FireWire drive.\n", "Q: Zooming on Xcode on Mac I have seen in many tutorial videos people zoom in and out on Xcode to show the code a little better. I tried with 'control' + 'two finger swipe on trackpad' but this does not work on Xcode. What is the shortcut for zooming on Xcode?\n\nA: Screen Zoom is a system-wide feature. In Lion, this is part of Universal Access.   \nThe short version is:\nVisit System Preferences->Universal Access->Seeing \nAnd set \"Zoom\" to on. \nYou'll then be able to scroll using the control key and the scroll gesture of your input device. \nFollow the instructions here for more detailed instructions. \n", "Q: How do I type the prime and double prime characters on OS X? When typing in feet and inches, the prime ′ and double prime ″ symbols are used, e.g. 5′ 5″. How do I type these characters?\n\nA: I don't know if it's the easiest way, but here's one way:\nIn the \"International\" system preferences, turn on the keyboard layout called \"Unicode Hex Input\".  When you need to type a prime, type commandspace to switch to this keyboard layout, and then hold down option and type 2 0 3 2.  For double prime, it's 2 0 3 3.\n\nA: Character Palette\n\n´ (prime): 2032\n˝ (double-prime): 2033\n(thanks to Paul Berkowitz)\nUnicode Hex Input Keyboard\n\n´ (prime): option 2 0 3 2\n˝ (double-prime): option 2 0 3 3\n(thanks to @Ken's answer)\n\nA: Using the Character Viewer, search for \"Prime\". You can then click \"Add to Favorites\" for more convenient access. \n\nIn Mavericks, the following shortcut is helpful to bring up the character viewer: \n\nControl + Command + Spacebar\n\nClick the button in the top right corner to switch between the \"Characters\" window and \"Character Viewer\". Note: to get that button or the search bar to appear, you'll need to scroll up.\n\n\nA: Modify the Press & Hold keys\nFor entering special characters such as the primes, I prefer the Press & Hold method since it's easy to remember and really quick if you shorten the Press & Hold time.\n\n\n*\n\n*Navigate to System/Library/Input Methods/PressAndHold.app/Contents/Resources/.\n\n*Backup the Keyboard-en.plist file.\n\n*Append the following to the Keyboard-en.plist file (before the closing </dict></plist>).\n<key>Roman-Accent-t</key>\n<dict>\n    <key>Direction</key>\n    <string>right</string>\n    <key>Keycaps</key>\n    <string>t ′ ″ ‴</string>\n    <key>Strings</key>\n    <string>t ′ ″ ‴</string>\n</dict>\n\nFeel free to change the Roman-Accent-t to any character you wish, providing it does not already have Press & Hold keys assigned.\n\nA: On my new MacBook Air 2013 running Mountain Lion…\nPress ⌥ alt/option + E to get single prime. ´\nPress ⇧ shift + ⌥ alt/option and G to get double prime. ˝\n\nA: Using the character palate is definitely the way forward, but instead of typing \"prime\" in the search box, which presented me with accented apostrophes, I found typing \"apostrophe\" gave me exactly what I needed.\n\nA: *\n\n*Opt-e PRIME ´\n\n*Opt-j DOUBLE PRIME ˝\n\n\nA: Try \nPrime: ⬆⌥] \nDouble prime: ⬆⌥[\n", "Q: Can I copy a recovery partition from an HD to an SSD?
