["Q: Do Ubuntu repos/servers perform log analysis to identify & block retrieval program? Many server administrators want their server to be used only by humans and not by retrieval programs like wget. One way to block such programs is to use log analysis. Log analysis identifies retrieval programs by looking for statistically significant similarities among the requests, often through timing.  \nWhenever I try to use wget to download packages through a shell script (one similar to those created by synaptic, mostly they are actually created by synaptic), only a few packages are downloaded and most of the packages fail to download due to connection refusal.\nSo I strongly think that the most probable reason why the connection is refused is that Ubuntu servers use log analysis to block programs.\nDo Ubuntu servers use log analysis to block (package retrieval) programs?\nEDIT:\nI executed some scripts which contained packages of small size (i.e., they would get downloaded in less time). Such scripts work properly as expected. The error comes up with packages that are large in size (consequently they take more time).\n\nA: wget has an option, --random-wait, that is designed to avert log analysis blocking. From the docs:\n\n--random-wait\nSome web sites may perform log analysis to identify retrieval programs such as Wget by looking for statistically significant\n  similarities in the time between requests. This option causes the time\n  between requests to vary between 0.5 and 1.5 * wait seconds, where\n  wait was specified using the --wait option, in order to mask Wget's\n  presence from such analysis.\nA 2001 article in a publication devoted to development on a popular consumer platform provided code to perform this analysis on\n  the fly. Its author suggested blocking at the class C address level to\n  ensure automated retrieval programs were blocked despite changing\n  DHCP-supplied addresses.\nThe --random-wait option was inspired by this ill-advised recommendation to block many unrelated users from a web site due to\n  the actions of one.\n\nSo chances are, if the server accepts you with the --random-wait option turned on but not without it, it is using log analysis.\n\nA: Most of the mirrors aren't controlled by Ubuntu and their configuration is completely up to the sysadmins. By extension there may be some blocking on some mirrors. I personally don't see why they would but given the defaults, wget is pretty simple to fingerprint through its user-agent string even before you start considering behavioural tracking.\nYou can make wget look like the current apt quite simply:\nwget -U \"Ubuntu APT-HTTP/1.3 (0.9.9.1~ubuntu3)\" ...\n\nAnd as another user pointed out, if your current mirror is controlled by somebody who doesn't want you using wget, you could just use another mirror. There are loads of them.\n", "Q: How to install Python 3.4 properly on Saucy? For my project I need Python 3.4 (beta 2) for its asyncio module, but there is no official package for Ubuntu yet (unlike Windows, which has an MSI already). I'd like to know how can I install Python 3.4 (beta 2) from the downloadable tarball without breaking my system. By not breaking my system I mean that I can use the update-alternatives and env scripts, have the python3.4 and pip3.4 binaries without conflicts, etc. as usual on Ubuntu. As far as I know the default make script does not 100% respect default system paths in Ubuntu (I previously had problems installing Python 2.7.4 before the official deb package came out for it).\n\nA: Too late for you, probably, but in case this is useful for anyone else... here's how to take advantage of the fact that Python 3.4 is in the Trusty repositories.

Does \"spin-down\" have any affect on SSDs for preserving battery life?  Is there a delay in SSDs in the event that the device is needed again?\nDoes it actually shut off the device's circuitry (saving power) or does it just put the HDD into a special spun-down mode which wouldn't be implemented on an SSD.\nOverall, should I set aggressive \"Save Power\" settings on the secondary?\nShould I do the same for the primary?\nThanks!\n\nA: There is nothing spinning in a SSD so there is nothing to spin down. Modern SSDs use only a fraction of a watt so there would be no power consumption savings. The drive must be awake enough to know when to receive commands so the power can't be totally shut down. Maximum power consumption, still a fraction of a watt with the latest drives, is during writes; much less during reads. \nThis answer is OS independent and applies to Linux, OSX, Windows, whatever. Modern OS releases, since Windows Vista for example while less so for Linux, understand that they are working with a SSD and don't defrag the drive. \nDo make sure you are backing up your data because as SSD speeds have increased, their lifespan has decreased (number of times a given bit can be rewritten). If you never use more than 20% of your drive, it might last 50 years. If you fill it to 90%, it could start failing within a year. \nUnlike a hard drive, they rarely fail dramatically. The drive can detect when some bits are \"wearing out\" and switch to some backup areas. Eventually you'll notice the maximum size of the drive decreasing as worn out areas are made unavailable. In large data centers, SSDs are used for their speed and not reliability, they have about the same failure rate as data center quality hard drives.\nThat said, I have 3 SSDs in my HP Z420 Workstation and really enjoy the performance improvement while saving energy. Have been considering replacing the power supply with a smaller, more energy efficient one except the 6-core Xeon processor does use a fair amount of energy. \n", "Q: Is there any REAL Skype alternative where I can add my Skype friends (without asking them to join to a new app)? I have installed Skype but, despite the recent updates, it still seems to have bugs. Anyway, I am looking for an alternative for it, and I saw from internet that there are plenty of Open Source alternatives to Skype: Ekiga, Linphone. Blink, Jitsi, Empathy so on. \nAnyway, I did not installed and tried any of those, except for Empathy which looks promising but it was a big disappointment to me and I will unistall it. \nSo, the idea is: What other app should I use in order to keep contact with my Skype friends? I don't wont to install, let's say, Ekiga, and then ask my friends to create IDs on Ekiga. I don't think is polite from my part to ask/force people to change their software just because it doesn't fit my taste. \nAs a Windows user, I did used Yahoo Messenger and Gtalk app. Now, when I'm on Linux, I use Pidgin to chat with my friends from both these accounts. Well, I need something like Pidgin, but for Skype. I need an app which I can use with my Skype ID and I can add my Skype friends to it, without having to ask them to join the new app. In extremis, I am willing to create an ID for the new app, but I still need to add my Skype friends to it in the conditions mentioned above. \nIs there any such app where I can import my Skype friends (just like I did with my YM and Gtalk friends in Pidgin)?\n\nA: The short answer is: no, only skype can mannage skype accounts.\nAlso Pidgin is a client not a server, you did not import your friends. If you are interested in using Skype in Pidgin you can go to the third party plugin site and check for the Skype IM plugin.\nNotice that for skype buddies to show in Pidgin you will need to run both skype and pidgin at the same time and that this functionality might stop working in the future due to api changes in skype that will, if you insist in using it, \"force\" you to keep an old version of skype installed with all the issues involved.\nhttp://code.google.com/p/skype4pidgin/\n\nA: Short answer: Just log into https://web.skype.com/ and leave it open.\nLong answer: Skype has closed source, closed/obfuscated protocol, spyware crap, full of ads, buggy, bloatware, resource intensive and here comes the worst: ALL the things you ever say/do/send will be stored in their data centers forever without the possibility of deletion (that's what it actually says in their TOS) All your history will be always there and protected only by a exploitable (if you are a target) password. [Verification needed]\nThe above reasons are more than enough to say \"Nobody should use Skype ever\", but you might ask: Why they are still alive and are the number one IM!? The answer is simple: because a lot of people are ignorant (on technical details and implications of their actions) and are only interested of end-user experience/convenience - that's the main reason we are forced to use this kind of software, because work, friends, family, don't know or care to use something open source, open protocol like SIP which IMO is way better.\n", "Q: Facebook chat history I would like to ask, if it is possible in Empathy to have facebook chat history, because Empathy shows only messages sent/received specifically on this device and not from my other PC or my android. Thank you for your help.\n\nA: Histories and logs are stored locally, which is why you can only see your local exchanges. What you want would require a server-based (or at least shared) history, which Empathy cannot provide since it is not installed on all your devices (you probably use various clients). By the way, I don't think it offers synchronisation, even if installed everywhere, since it has no proper account management (it only connects you to other services on which YOU have an account).\nIn order to have a shared and synchronised history system, you need the server to handle the storage, and well... it does not.

I am using three different USB sticks formatted as NTFS and all copy operations are falling.\nFirstly, the files are transferred but when I eject/inject the USB again, I get the following error:\n\nError mounting /dev/sdb1 at /media/gotqn/Joro: Command-line `mount -t\n  \"ntfs\" -o\n  \"uhelper=udisks2,nodev,nosuid,uid=1000,gid=1000,dmask=0077,fmask=0177\"\n  \"/dev/sdb1\" \"/media/gotqn/Joro\"' exited with non-zero exit status 13:\n  $MFTMirr does not match $MFT (record 0).

Please\n  see the 'dmraid' documentation for more details.\n\nI have firstly thought that there might be something with the USB sticks themselves, so  I have formatted them using gparted to NTFS again but nothing changes.\nWhen I formatted the sticks  on Windows 8 and copied the files, everything is OK.\nHow to fix this? \n\nA: As @falconer pointed out, 80MB/sec is impossible on USB2.0 and also very-very unlikely on USB3 for a pendrive.\nThe reason of such fast speed is probably writing cache. While the Copy Dialog shows you 80MB/s, the actually write speed is 5-6MB/s and OS caching everything rest and write it later. So even Copy Dialog report about files are copied, they're actually not.\nOS still writing on the disk and if you press Unmount option on drive it will tell you that there are operations with the drive and you need to wait. After a several minutes(or more if files are big ones) it actually finish write data on drive and make pendrive inactive. Than you can eject drive and open files on other PC or TV.\nThere are two posts questions that may help you with disabling writing cache:\nHow to switch off caching for usb device when writing to it?\nand \nhttps://superuser.com/questions/526248/turn-off-write-cache-on-all-usb-external-drives-debian-ubuntu-linux\nI used the second one for my problem and it helped me.

A bridge is a layer 2 network device. On physical bridges we only have an IP address for operation and maintenance.\nI'm a little bit confused why we need in KVM an IP address for the bridge.\nI understand that the VM's interface get's an IP address and that the physical interface attached to the bridge has no IP address. This ensures that the VM's Ip address is visible to the outside.\nIn an server environment, I would only use static IP addressing for the VM's. \nLet's assume, I use static IP addressing for the VM's, than why do I need an IP address on the bridge?\n\nA: You do not need to assign an IP to a Linux bridge.\nHere is an example of what it looks like in /etc/network/interfaces. br0 is the bridge, which is connected to the eth0 interface:\nauto br0\niface br0 inet manual\n    bridge_ports eth0\n\n\nA: You do not need to have an IP configured for a bridge, the same way you do not need to have an IP configured for an ethernet device, on any machine (be it host/guest or whatever).\nHowever, if you have a device/bridge that has no IP address, you cannot expect it to be usable by the party that has it not properly configured (be it host or guest).\nSo for example, if I have a KVM host with a bridge called \"br_vm\" which I assign to all KVM guests as their only interface (the guests will most likely call it \"eth0\"), and if br_vm is not configured at the host, you cannot expect the guests to be able to talk to the host through their eth0 interface.\nYou ask why you need an IP for a bridge and the answer is you don't. However, if you want to know in which scenarios you would wish to have an IP for the bridge at the host, I can think of a few:\n\n\n*\n\n*You want your VMs to communicate to the host, even if for DHCP or DNS only;\n\n*You may want to disable VM-to-VM traffic. If you share that bridge with many VMs, that is something worth considering;\n\n*You may want to have a firewall at the host-level in addition to any firewalling you may have set-up for your VMs. Concentrating all firewall rules on the host can be wise if the policies, zones, etc for all your VMs are about the same. It is easier if all rules, IP addresses, policies, etc are kept in one place (although I would set-up basic firewall on each VM just in case);\n\n\nAnd, by the way, you can have dynamic IP addressing on your guest VMs, that has nothing to do with whether or not the host has an IP on the bridge (unless, of course, the host is the DHCP server for the network).\n\nA: This is more of a quirk in documentation I find. I'm assuming your host uses the /etc/network/interfaces file for network configuration. \nIf, in the bridge interface (br0 for this example) stanza, you specify an address of 0.0.0.0 you get exactly what you're looking for: VM's attached to the bridge are still connected to the network, and retain their own IPs.\nHowever, you then lose the host's \"port\" on that bridge. If (in the interfaces file) you specify an IP address, that effectively becomes your host's IP on that bridge, just the same as a management interface on a traditional switch. \nRemember that a bridge is just like a standalone switch, but the host is still \"managing\" it, so adding an IP simply adds an addressed management interface (if that makes sense)\n\nIf, like me, your host has two NICs: one for VMs and one for itself, you can put an address of 0.0.0.0 on the \"VM bridge\" and rely on the other physical NIC for management to get a similar setup.\n\nIf that's not what you're asking, let me know and I will edit to suit.\n", "Q: Cannot Install shutter I get this error when I try installing shutter:\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\n$ sudo apt-get install -f shutter \nReading package lists...

I did manage to install and boot from the netinstall, but then for some reason installed ubuntu studio and didn't always start the desktop after logging in. it just got stuck. but even so is there something wrong with the 64-bit 12.04 iso? i also tried with 32bit, but it didn't boot it.\nI also have managed to install and boot Debian which worked, but it also found the same problems as it did with the netinstall ubuntu. which was no wifi, ethernet only worked first time, Debian complained about the driver for the graphics card not being present therefore not functioning properly. \nplease help find drivers and all the stuff i need to get it working. i hate being stuck with windows.\n\nA: If anyone else should have any issues with installing ubuntu on the ativ 9 here is what you need to do.\nOne of the problems was making the USB. not managing to make it bootable in Windows, I made a Tails OS live USB from which I made the Ubuntu install USB. Then it worked. Why it didn't in windows i do not know. \nSecond problem:\nWhen it boots from the USB and you can choose between Try Ubuntu without Installing and Install Ubuntu, choose install. \nThe drivers for the graphics card are proprietary and do not automatically install, therefore you will not be able to start the desktop fully. \nWhen installed and rebooted press CTRL + ALT + F1 to access console login. \nType in your username and password.\nThen install fglrx with \nsudo apt-get install fglrx\n\n(make sure you are connected to the internet.)\nreboot and all is good :) \nregarding the network card - this does not seem to be an issue after all. \n", "Q: How to change mysql port number in ubuntu How can I can change port number of mysql from 3306 to my choice of number (1023) in Ubuntu 13.10? I tried by editing the port number in file: /etc/mysql/my.cnf. But after this change mysql doesn't  start. Please guide me so I can fix this.\n\nA: There may be multiple files containing mysql configuration. Their full path may exists in file /etc/mysql/my.cnf by lines starting !includedir.\nFor a sample, mine is:\n!includedir /etc/mysql/conf.d/\n!includedir /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/\n\nSo, after listing the second dir, I found a file named:\n/etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf\n\nSo You have to change the port number in this file.\nThe best way for you is viewing the file:\n/etc/my.cnf\n\nor\n/etc/mysql/my.cnf\n\nand then changing port number in a file inside one of directories included my.cnf file.\n\nA: For Ubuntu Desktop about version 18.04, it was enough to edit the /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf file:\nFrom:\n[mysqld]\npid-file    = /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.pid\nsocket      = /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock\ndatadir     = /var/lib/mysql\nlog-error   = /var/log/mysql/error.log\n\nTo:\n[mysqld]\nport        = 3308 (or other number) <-------------------\npid-file    = /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.pid\nsocket      = /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock\ndatadir     = /var/lib/mysql\nlog-error   = /var/log/mysql/error.log\n\nFinally, it's mandatory to restart the server by running: sudo systemctl restart mysql in the terminal.\nYou can confirm the new settings by running the command: SHOW VARIABLES LIKE '%port%'; in the MySQL Console (mysql>) which generates output something like:\n+--------------------------+-------+\n| Variable_name            | Value |\n+--------------------------+-------+\n| admin_port               | 33062 |\n| large_files_support      | ON    |\n| mysqlx_port              | 33060 |\n| mysqlx_port_open_timeout | 0     |\n| port                     | 3308  |\n| report_host              |       |\n| report_password          |       |\n| report_port              | 3308  |\n| report_user              |       |\n| require_secure_transport | OFF   |\n+--------------------------+-------+\n10 rows in set (0.02 sec)\n\nAs you can see, I now have the port value: 3308.\n\nA: MySQL server and client uses a file called my.cnf. You need to open /etc/my.cnf (Global mysqld configuration file) to specify new port.\nMySQL Change Default Port\nOpen /etc/my.cnf file:\n# vi /etc/my.cnf\n\nSet new port 5123:\nport=5123\n\nHere is is my sample /etc/my.cnf file:\n[mysqld]\ndatadir=/var/lib/mysql\nsocket=/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock\nport=5123\nold_passwords=1\nbind = 10.10.29.66\nkey_buffer = 500M\ntable_cache = 4000\nsort_buffer_size = 3M\nread_buffer_size = 2M\nread_rnd_buffer_size = 8M\nmyisam_sort_buffer_size = 64M\nmax_connections = 400\nquery_cache_type = 1\nquery_cache_limit = 1M\nquery_cache_size = 100M\nmax_allowed_packet = 1M\nthread_cache_size = 8\n# Try number of CPU's*2 for thread_concurrency\nthread_concurrency = 4\nlocal-infile=0\n[mysql.server]\nuser=mysql\nbasedir=/var/lib\n[mysqld_safe]\nlog-error=/var/log/mysqld.log\npid-file=/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.pid\n[mysqldump]\nquick\nmax_allowed_packet = 16M\n\nSave and close the file. Restart mysqld:\n# service mysqld restart\n\nPlease note that once port changed, you need to update all your php, perl, python scripts including iptables scripts.\n\nA: *UPDATE\" - See Bert's answer below .. yes have done my.cnf three changes 2 for port and change user to \"root\" and yes it starts as port 1023 ... netstat -tln shows 1023 as the listener .. kudos Bert ...\nJUST tried 1023 ... and noted \"failed to start\" message ... checked and 1023 is RESERVED\n1023    TCP UDP Reserved[1] Official\nYou'll have to use another number ... soz ...\nRemember there are \"two\" places to change the mysql port number in the /etc/mysql/my.cnf\nThe First:\n[Client]\nport          = 1234\nThe Second:\n[mysqld]\nport          = 1234\nthen restart the service ... hope this also helps ... worked for me just now to test it ...\n\nA: In order to start MySQL or any other service on a port number below 1024, you need to start the service as the root user.\n", "Q: Install Fedora over Ubuntu partition?

I have a problem with uninstalling packages that were used by xorg-edgers' version of nvidia drivers that I have installed and after that removed (331.20), e.g.:\n$ dpkg -l | grep libxcb\nii  libxcb-composite0:amd64                1.10-1~xedgers~saucy1                            amd64        X C Binding, composite extension\nii  libxcb-dri2-0:amd64                    1.10-1~xedgers~saucy1                            amd64        X C Binding, dri2 extension\nii  libxcb-dri3-0:amd64                    1.10-1~xedgers~saucy1                            amd64        X C Binding, dri3 extension\nii  libxcb-glx0:amd64                      1.10-1~xedgers~saucy1                            amd64        X C Binding, glx extension\nii  libxcb-icccm4:amd64                    0.3.9-2                                          amd64        utility libraries for X C Binding -- icccm\nii  libxcb-image0:amd64                    0.3.9-1ubuntu1                                   amd64        utility libraries for X C Binding -- image\nii  libxcb-keysyms1:amd64                  0.3.9-1                                          amd64        utility libraries for X C Binding -- keysyms\nii  libxcb-present0:amd64                  1.10-1~xedgers~saucy1                            amd64        X C Binding, present extension\nii  libxcb-randr0:amd64                    1.10-1~xedgers~saucy1                            amd64        X C Binding, randr extension\nii  libxcb-render-util0:amd64              0.3.8-1.1                                        amd64        utility libraries for X C Binding -- render-util\nii  libxcb-render0:amd64                   1.10-1~xedgers~saucy1                            amd64        X C Binding, render extension\nii  libxcb-shape0:amd64                    1.10-1~xedgers~saucy1                            amd64        X C Binding, shape extension\nii  libxcb-shm0:amd64                      1.10-1~xedgers~saucy1                            amd64        X C Binding, shm extension\nii  libxcb-sync0:amd64                     1.9.1-3ubuntu1                                   amd64        X C Binding, sync extension\nii  libxcb-sync1:amd64                     1.10-1~xedgers~saucy1                            amd64        X C Binding, sync extension\nii  libxcb-util0:amd64                     0.3.8-2build1                                    amd64        utility libraries for X C Binding -- atom, aux and event\nii  libxcb-xfixes0:amd64                   1.10-1~xedgers~saucy1                            amd64        X C Binding, xfixes extension\nii  libxcb-xv0:amd64                       1.10-1~xedgers~saucy1                            amd64        X C Binding, xv extension\nii  libxcb1:amd64                          1.10-1~xedgers~saucy1                            amd64        X C Binding\n\nThat causes other problems with dependencies. Therefore I would like to uninstall them, and install versions provided by Ubuntu, e.g.: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/saucy/amd64/libxcb1/1.9.1-3ubuntu1\nBut when I try to remove them (I may as well remove the whole system): \n$ sudo apt-get remove libxcb1:amd64\nReading package lists...

But if you will use Skype for chatting / phone (headset;microphone) call, you will have nothing to worry about.\nIf you still persist on video calls via Skype the best solution for you would be installing Windows in Virtualbox ( you can find it in Ubuntu software center ). Therefore you will be able to communicate with video call if you install Skype inside Windows ( installed on your Virtualbox ).\n", "Q: 12.04 computers can't \"see\" each other or 10.04 computer, but not vice-versa There are three Ubuntu computers on our lan: 2 X 12.04, 1 X 10.04 and one Win XP.

I've partitioned my USB stick into 2 partitions, one vfat and one ext4. The vfat partition has the ISO and GRUB2 installed to it, such that GRUB2 boots the ISO. \nThe ext4 partition has the volume label casper-rw and is used as the persistent data store for the Live USB. I've modified the grub.cfg such that I get two options at boot, one to boot the ISO in persistent mode and one to boot normally.\nHowever, when booting in \"normal\" mode, the casper-rw partition is mounted as a normal drive and changes made in persistent mode don't stay. \nWhat I would like is the casper-rw partition to be mounted overlaid on the / filesystem, but when I ask Ubuntu to boot normally (i.e., without the persistent option in GRUB2), I'd like that partition to be mounted read-only so that changes made in the persistent mode persist.\nWhat is the best way to achieve this?\n\nA: What i did is I modify casper script inside initrd.lz.\nThe script will mount casper-rw as read-only and then on overlay it on top of /.\nIt will then mount tmpfs on top of the overlay.\nI use mint btw, not sure about ubuntu, hope it works for you.\nHere are more details:\n\n\n*\n\n*Extract initrd using instruction from here.\n\n*Edit scripts/casper, modify the setup_unionfs() function. \nYou find the modified function here.\n...\np_ro_mount=\"\"\nif [ -n \"${PERSISTENT}\" ]; then\n      cowprobe=$(find_cow_device \"${root_persistence}\")\n      if [ -b \"${cowprobe}\" ]; then\n            p_ro_device=${cowprobe}\n            p_ro_fstype=$(get_fstype \"${cowprobe}\")\n            p_ro_mountopt=\"ro,noatime\"\n            p_ro_mount=\"/persistent\"\n            mkdir -p $p_ro_mount\n            mount -t ${p_ro_fstype} -o ${p_ro_mountopt} \\   \n              ${p_ro_device} \\\n              ${p_ro_mount} || panic \"Can not mount\"\n...\ncase ${UNIONFS} in\n...\n   overlayfs)\n       mounts=\"\"\n       for mount in /cow $p_ro_mount $rofslist\n...\n\n\n*Replace initrd.lz, or in my case, I just created a new one.\nfind . | cpio --quiet -o -H newc | lzma -7 > ../ro-initrd.lz\n\n\n*Add more boot option to syslinux.cfg\nappend initrd=/casper/ro-initrd.lz file=/cdrom/preseed/linuxmint.seed boot=casper  splash -- persistent\n\nNote: I use Mint 16 (x86) and unetbootin.\n", "Q: window vista 32 bit installation I am a not a computer geek, so I probably think this is dumb questions..

The top-level folders are there (Users, Windows, Program Files, etc.), but they seem empty.  Does anyone know if this is some sort of compatibility issue between Linux and Windows?\nThe thing is, I also tried checking the files using the Windows command prompt (from the builtin diagnostic tool) and the folders look similarly empty there, which probably isn't looking good.\nThe machine is a Dell Inspiron 660 desktop with Windows 8, which I bought just over a year ago. It has an Intel Core i5 processor and about 8GB RAM. I confess that I didn't get round to creating a recovery disk or make any system backups (I know, my bad ...). I know there is an option in the Windows diagnostics to reset the system back to 'factory settings'; however, I haven't tried that yet as I'm still hopeful of being able to recover my files.\nIf anyone has any ideas or suggestions, I'd be very grateful.  Btw, I'm quite enjoying this little taste of Ubuntu and I'm seriously considering switching permanently (getting a bit fed up with this Windows 8 trash ...)  :-)\n\nA: I did figure out what the problem was in the end and I posted some updates on the Windows 8 forums in this thread here:\nhttp://www.eightforums.com/general-support/39343-windows-8-automatic-repair-loop-issue.html\nThis was the solution that I gave in that thread:\n\nOk, so I've marked the problem as 'solved', because I've figured out\n  what was going on. Basically, almost ALL the files on my HDD\n  (including the Windows system files) had been crammed into a found.000\n  folder on the top level, so it's no wonder the OS couldn't boot up!\n  What seems to have happened is that the HDD was damaged during the\n  sudden power down and it must have unfortunately hit just the right\n  part of the disk to wreck the filesystem. Then, scandisk found all the\n  'orphaned' files and put them into found.000.\nIt took me a while to figure out where all the files had gone, but\n  it's all ok now and I've recovered 95% of my data, which is a relief!\n  I've also re-installed Windows from the disk that Dell gave me - it\n  was pretty straightforward.\nThanks very much to everyone who posted with advice - I really\n  appreciate your help. Also, that HIRENs boot disk is an amazing tool -\n  I highly recommend it for PC maintenance. I'll definitely learn my\n  lesson and create backups and restore points from now on. :-)\n\nSince then I've been running Ubuntu & Windows 8 dual-boot on my machine with some success, although I have the occasional issue with WIndows overwriting my bootloader  :-( .\nSo, what exactly is the problem you are having?\n", "Q: First install, Nvidia GeForce 4 4200, GPU lockup I used my Wintel box to download Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.

I've switched to Gnome 3 recently, and now trying to figure out how the contacts app/integration works. I had some issues in the beginning with my google account and now it mixed a \"local adress book\" (another application had the brilliant idea to import my google contacts and store them as local) with a google adressbook. Now i am left with a lot of duplicates and mixed contacts. \nI wanted to reset the contacts, and start fresh, but can't figure out how i would do that.\nI did try restarting the initial setup, by disabling dconf \"org > gnome > contacts > did-initial-setup\" - which triggered it, but that did not reset my contacts either.

Is there a way to get rid of this screen so it doesn't show again?\n\nA: It sounds like you want to have Ubuntu installed to your flash drive, not use it as a live disc. First, you're going to want to back up your files. You can install Ubuntu to the flash drive like a normal hard disk, then restore your files from your backup. I am not sure if this would allow you to switch between computers or not, but in theory the generic drivers should allow it.\n", "Q: How to play MSS2 encoded video files VLC player and totem video player can't play MSS2 video encoded video files but i could play them under Ubuntu by compiling FFMPEG library. now ffplay can play these files.

(Why two commands? Why two arguments?)\ngit config --global user.email \"your_email@example.com\"\n\n\nA: In short because git's configuration is a simple key/value database. To change the configuration, you need to tell it both the config key and the new value.\nAs for syntax, as long as it doesn't interfere with the Bash syntax, anything goes. The reason some people use named arguments (as opposed to positional arguments) is it makes them easy to be in any order and optional. The parser is completely application specific. One example is Python's argparse module.\n\nA: Like many version control systems, git uses a sub-command system. \"config\" here is the sub-command .. any common options would go before it, and sub-command specific options afterwards, such as --global in this case. The two parameters here, (git) option name and value, are parameters to the config sub-command, not to the --global option (which merely modifies the action of the sub-command.) Two parameters are entirely reasonable here - the name of the git option to be set and the value to set it to.\n", "Q: Is the a way to download a file to ftp from chrome?

I recently installed Ubuntu 13.10 alongside Windows 8.1 and I had a question about preventing the unmounting of my windows drive. When I go into the file browser (I think it's called nautilus. It's the Ubuntu default one, anyways), I see my Windows drive on the left panel. However, it has a little eject icon next to it. I'm afraid I'm going to accidentally click that button and completely wreck my windows partition. Is there any way to remove this button and make that drive permanently mounted (or at least make it harder to unmount it)? Thanks!\n\nA: You can go ahead and unmount your Windows partition. That will not hurt anything. Unmounting a partition means making it no longer accessible to currently running system until it is mounted again.\nThis should have no effect on the Windows system itself. Unmounting a partition does not damage it in any way. Unmount does not mean anything like format or erase.\nTherefore there is no reason for you try to to prevent yourself from unmounting it by accident. The damage you're worried about will not occur just from the partition being unmounted.\nAs psusi explained, the only situation where it would be harmful to unmount a partition is if there are open files on it that need to be written to disk before the partition is unmounted. But when that is the case, Nautilus will not unmount the partition when you click the \"eject\" button on it. So whether or not and to whatever extent you're using files on your Windows partition when booted into your Ubuntu system, this is not a problem either.\n\nTo clarify further, you asked:\n\nSo just to be sure, if I do press the button, it should automatically remount when I boot into Windows again?\n\nYes.\nOr, more precisely: Whether or not your Windows partition is mounted in your Ubuntu system is completely unrelated to what happens when you actually use Windows.\nWindows must (in a sense) mount this partition every time you boot into Windows, whether or not it was mounted before in Ubuntu. In fact, your Windows partition, like all your other mounted partitions, is automatically unmounted when you shut down or reboot your Ubuntu system.\nWhether or not a partition is mounted is almost entirely a matter of what state the currently running operating system is in, not of what state the partition itself is currently in. When your Windows partition is mounted in Ubuntu, this means Ubuntu can access data on it. It has nothing at all to do with what Windows can do, next time it runs.\nTotally optional reading: I say \"almost entirely\" since some types of partitions keep information on the disk about whether or not they're currently mounted, so that if they are not unmounted when they should be, like during reboot, automatic corrective action can be taken. Such repairs apply to situations where a partition is not unmounted as needed, rather than those where the partition is unmounted. Specifically, when you write a file to a partition, it's possible the file will not be (fully) written to disk until the partition is unmounted.\n", "Q: I'm trying to install nodejs-legacy and it keeps failing I have no idea what the problem is, but I keep trying to install nodejs-legacy by running sudo apt-get install, but it keeps failing.

I use Ubuntu 12.04 in a machine for working,and don't know why Libreoffice doesn't upgrade to last version,and Firefox does.\n\nA: Actually, it's the opposite. Ubuntu is a stable system, meaning that we don't get big version upgrades for software. \nThe goal was to not keep upgrading Firefox. But Mozilla shortened its support so that it became impossible for Ubuntu to support older versions. That's why Firefox gets new versions even though the system is stable. \nLibreOffice is supportable, so it doesn't get upgraded.

The method to do that is with the package pam_motd (it will already be installed on your system). \n\nWhen logging into an Ubuntu server you may have noticed the informative Message Of The Day (MOTD). This information is obtained and displayed using a couple of packages: \n\npam_motd executes the scripts in /etc/update-motd.d in order based on the number prepended to the script.

I want to recover the whole partitions not copy some data, which means I will have to write a new table. is this ok, both being on the same hard drive? or do I have to do it from a live session? this will need a new search and 4 more hours!!\n\nA: We can't change the partition table of a harddrive in use. Furthermore all partitions of a drive need to be unmounted before we can rescue partition tables on that drive.\nThis can easily done by booting a live system.\nTo prevent further data loss it is however not recommended to change the partitioning on a drive directly.

Since the drivers had worked (till the latest package update wrecked my GUI again *), I tend to believe it is normal.

That the driver still reports 8670 is not an issue.\nFor determining the driver in use, I use lspci -v and look for the \"Kernel driver in use\" in the \"VGA compatible controller\" section.

What am I doing wrong?\nBest regards an thanks in advance,\nMarkus\n\nA: First, and most importantly, do not use uppercase variable names. You risk overriding environment variables and special shell variables, and in this case you did just that by overwriting the PATH variable.\nSecond. Quotes are very very important in shell scripting; quoting variable expansions avoids the result from being subjected to pathname expansion and word splitting. \nFor example, if var=\"St. Elmo's Fire.mpg\", then $var will become the three words St., Elmo's and Fire.mpg, while \"$var\" will become the one word St. Elmo's Fire.mpg. So always quote variable expansions. \"$var\", not $var.\nSomething like this should be more correct:\n#!/bin/bash\nread -ep \"Enter path for the .mpg-file: \" file\nIFS=: read -rp \"Where should the trimming start? (HH:MM:SS): \" shour smin ssec\nIFS=: read -rp \"When should the trimming end?

You can then do whatever you like with generated command.\nNot all monitors will support a custom resolution you create.\n\nA: I was just having this same problem the other day with my LCD TV. It overscans with the default resolution setting. I had to create a custom setting at the native resolution that doesn't seem to get reported with a minimal install (though the resolution is listed under xrandr in the 12.04 live cd).\nAnyways, you are on the right track. Getting the custom mode line that works is the hard part. I found a resolution setting that worked in the live cd and then copied the modeline from that. Once you have the modeline you add it to xrandr using the --newmode flag such as you did. Two more commands and you'll be set.\nAll of the information can be found at:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Config/Resolution#Setting_xrandr_changes_persistently\nFirst you need to identify the display port that you want to use. Based on your original post, I would guess this to be HDMI-0. You'll also need the name of the mode you are trying to add to the port. The name is the first column of numbers listed under each port in xrandr (i.e. 1024x768 or 1360x768 etc.). If you created the modeline, then it is the part between the quotes in the --newmode command (\"1824x1036_60.00\" in your case).\nNow that you have that information you can add the new mode to the port you want with...\n$ xrandr --addmode HDMI-0 1824x1036_60.00\n\nNow you should see that new mode listed in xrandr under the HDMI-0 port.\nYou can switch to it with this...\n$ xrandr --output HDMI-0 --mode 1824x1036_60.00\n\nxrandr settings (including added modes) are lost on shutdown/restart.

Ok, here's the story. \nI installed Ubuntu a couple of days ago (alongside Windows 7), I have a 128 gb SSD, a 1TB HDD and a 500GB External HDD. I accidentally installed Ubuntu onto the External HDD. I didn't feel like this should matter, I had plenty of space and the files on my externall HDD weren't extremely important. The installation went fine, the next time I booted it came up with a 'no such device' error which I fixed by re-installing GRUB via an Ubuntu CD. \nTHE PROBLEM IS everytime I boot my pc, I must go into my boot menu (ASRock motherboard) and select to boot from my External HDD, GRUB then pops up and gives me the option of booting WIndows or Ubuntu. If I don't go into the boot menu, my PC displays nothing on the screen. I can't set my boot priority to the External HDD (for whatever reason) so I am struggling to see a fix for this.\nMY QUESTION IS! How can I set my PC to boot either:\n\n\n*\n\n*GRUB (Boot from the external HDD)\nor \n\n*Windows 7 (being my preferred operating system [at the moment], so I then I have the option to manually do what I'm currently doing to boot Ubuntu when I want to use it)\n\n\nP.S I will happily give you any information you want so long as you guide me a little!\nThanks in advance,\nFletcher.\n\nA: You could try to disconnect the external hard drive, then see if it boots. My guess is that at its worst you would have to rewrite the master boot record or something, for wandows but i don't know if your windows is on the solid state drive or the terabyte drive, anyways there are a number of ways to approach this you can drop in the old windows 7 disk and fire up a dos command prompt and type fixboot, or fixmbr you could us a generic freedos, and do the same i have not worked much with solid state drives so much so i cant tell you from experience but i think if you know how to run the command prompt you should be fine  \n\nA: Fletcher,\nI'm not so sure, but if I've correctly understood you have a situation more or less similar to this scenario:\n128 Gb SSD, say /dev/sda, with Windows 7\n1 Tb HDD, say /dev/sdb, for data \n500 Mb external HDD, say /dev/sdc, originally for data, now with ubuntu AND grub\nand you want to boot both from windows or ubuntu without being obligated to choose the exterrnal HDD from BIOS.\nIn this case, what about reinstalling grub on /dev/sda?

Now you likely have only one of them there. You can use that present line as a pattern on how to add 2 new lines for the missing ones. The new lines will only differ in the UUID, where you will have to add the UUIDs of the missing swap partitions. \nOr you can combine all your swap partitions to a single swap partition as they are contiguous. Boot from a liveCD and use e.g. gparted. First swapoff all the swap partitions if any is mounted in the live environment, then combine the three swaps to a single swap partition, then edit your /etc/fstab file to contain the UUID of your new swap partition at the swap line.\n(If this is not clear just post the output of your /etc/fstab file and the output of ls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid and I give more detailed instructions.)\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.10 vs 14.04 for a Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro Laptop? I just picked up a Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro laptop today and want to install Ubuntu on it. I intend to dual boot for the moment with Windows 8.1 and will try to maintain the secure boot setup. As some of you probably already know the laptop is cutting edge with features such as a 3200 x 1800 screen resolution, backlit screen and touchscreen, and a \"laptop to tablet folding behavior\" which has created an endless number of issues for early adopters wishing to install Ubuntu or other Linux distros on it. \nI normally never install alpha software on a machine but was thinking about it on this machine since the newer kernel and modules may allow better handling of cutting edge hardware. I realize that I will be installing alpha software and will avoid doing any mission critical work on the machine. I will also maintain a separate home partition in case I need to downgrade the install or rescue user data.\nSo 14.04 or 13.10 for this machine?\n\nA: At this time, 14.04 is not a stable release.  If you don't want to deal with bugs as much, you should use 13.10 and not 14.04.

MUXed have a \ndisplay MUX to switch the displays between the discrete and integrated cards. \nMUXed systems can be switched using vgaswitcheroo. MUX-less do not have a \ndisplay MUX and the displays are only connected to the integrated card. On \nMUX-less systems, the discrete card is solely for rendering, not display. X \nServer 1.14 is required to support rendering and display from different cards. \nMost new laptops (2011+) are MUX-less.\n\nSo I think it's highly likely that my system (being a very recent laptop) is MUX-less (i.e. only the Intel card is actually connected to the display), and although I can \"switch\" through the AMD Catalyst Control Centre (should I be brave/foolish enough to install fglrx) this really just amounts to: \"High performance\" -> outsource hard graphics calculations to dGPU then reroute them back through the iGPU for display, \"Low performance/good battery\" -> do calcs on iGPU, then send directly to display. I also have no ability to switch GPUs in the BIOS, which also suggests MUX-less.\nThus, I probably will never be able to use VGA switcheroo.\nOne other consideration is that the radeon driver does not officially support my card yet (the 8670M code name Mars XT solar system series, not to be confused with OLAND). Thus when I boot up with open source drivers I get messages like No screens found for the radeon. Given that switcheroo needs radeon and intel both to there, it could be somehow failing because the radeon driver doesn't support my card. \nIf this is true, it leads to the question of how does one switch between ATI/Intel cards (without fglrx) in a MUX-less system.\n\nA: \nAccording to this\n\nMUXLESS SYSTEMS\nFirst thing you need to do is turn on your discrete GPU if it's not turned on already:\n# echo ON > /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch\n\nVerify that this worked by issuing this command again:\n# cat /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch\n\nNow, we have to know IDs that xrandr assigned to your cards. Do this as the regular user again, not root:\n$ xrandr --listproviders\nProviders: number : 3\nProvider 0: id: 108 cap: 0xb, Source Output, Sink Output, Sink Offload crtcs: 3     outputs: 4 associated providers: 2 name:Intel\nProvider 1: id: 69 cap: 0xf, Source Output, Sink Output, Source Offload, Sink Offload crtcs: 6 outputs: 0 associated providers: 2 name:radeon\nProvider 2: id: 69 cap: 0xf, Source Output, Sink Output, Source Offload, Sink Offload crtcs: 6 outputs: 0 associated providers: 2 name:radeon\n\nIn my case 3 cards get listed. Notice that both provides 1 and 2 have the same id. In this case my discrete card has id 69 and my integrated card has id 108.\nLast thing we need it to tell X to use your discrete GPU for rendering:\n$ xrandr --setprovideroffloadsink 69 108\n\nWhere the first number is your discrete card and the second one is your integrated card. To verify this worked:\n$ DRI_PRIME=1 glxinfo | grep renderer\nOpenGL renderer string: Gallium 0.4 on AMD TURKS\n\nYou should get Gallium 0.4 as your renderer. From now on all your 3D apps will be rendered on your ATI card, no need to restart X.\nWorked in my lenovo u400 with kubuntu 13.10.\n", "Q: The file casper/filesystem.squashfs is corrupt I tried burning Lubuntu 12.04 to a CD-RW with Xfburn and braseo, but it keeps be corrupted.

I also recently upgraded to 13.10. The problem didn't change, so that is irrelevant except to the fix I suppose. While looking around, I found Psensor and decided to check my stats.I have linked to a screenshot displaying the results, since I can't post a picture. \nhttp://imgur.com/yGBKctZ\nYou can see that the fan speed has a minimum of over 850 rpm. It is my understanding that Psensor displays the minimum and maximum values that have occurred since the program was opened. Herein lies the problem. The fan does not stop or slow down. Ever. Let me know if you need any more info or if I need to run any tests that would help. I'm willing to try whatever. \nThanks!\n\nA: I confirm that the min/max values displayed by psensor are the min/max values which have been measured since the monitoring application is started.\nYou can also see that the temperature of the CPU did not varie (45-46) so that's normal that the BIOS did not change the fan speed, there is simply no reason.\nThe BIOS is controlling the fan speed, so if you want to stop the fan you have to look in the BIOS settings. Many BIOS only allow to change the fan speed according to temperature threshold but not stop it.\nAlternatively, you can change the fan speed by software (see http://www.lm-sensors.org/wiki/man/fancontrol). Note that it is less reliable than the BIOS. Your particular hardware might not be perfectly supported by lm-sensor (mostly because manufacturers do not always publish specifications) and it can lead to hardware damage due to overheating.\n", "Q: What does -1 mean for modeset? What are other options for modeset? I have a rough idea what KMS setting is: \nKernel mode-setting (KMS) shifts responsibility for selecting and setting up the\ngraphics mode from X.org to the kernel. When X.org is started, it then detects\nand uses the mode without any further mode changes.

I had a look and there is no longer a user even set on them to remove or edit them. Somehow it has removed itself as me being the creator of them. I was listed as being about to last time I checked. I can't simply delete the folder by CLI as I have files in there I need still but I need to delete the folders that are in there. I could transfer the files out and then delete it but that would take to long to transfer them and I need to delete the existing folders now to free up space.\nSo my question is how can I delete multiple folders without an assigned user creator or any as none is listed anymore?\nMy user account won't let me change the permission because for some reason my username was removed from the folders and files so I can't even chmod them from the GUI as there is no assigned username listed in the permissions tab even though I am the creator.\n\nA: One option, assuming the old account is gone for good, is to change the whole thing to belong to thy own account.  Obviously this can't be done from the GUI, as thou'lt need to be root, but thou canst always issue sudo chown -R your_username: /path/to/folder.   Omitting the : will also work, but will leave the group-owner set to what it was before - which may of course be desired.\nThe advantage of this over deleting them directly from the terminal, is that those files which remain will be owned by thy user afterwards.\nThe disadvantage, of course, is that if some things are meant to be owned by another user, they'll need changing back.\n", "Q: CHMOD Folder + subfolder + subfolder etc I've been overlooking this problem for several hours and I'm starting to get crazy.

I have a very basical question to ask on the everyday use of the Ubuntu system.\nI plan to migrate from a version* to another, but before that I would like to be sure if it is possible to save what has been set and that so that works properly, before doing so.\nPutting the question in an another way around :\nIt is necessary to wonder about those points when Upgrading or it is just  necessary as an Backup in case of an Upgraded System thas has gone wrong?\nThanks in advance.\n*12.10 QQ >> 13.04 RR\n\nA: You should ALWAYS backup files you deem important. Regardless if we are talking about upgrading. \nUpgrading can go wrong at any given time and it is not always the installer that goes bad. A power failure in the middle of upgrading can be the end of that installation. \nI myself have my system set up such that my personal files (read all the directories in /home/$USER/) are on another disc so I can happily format my main installation and /home without worrying. For me downloading re-installing goes a lot quicker than upgrading (takes about 15 minutes to re-install once I start and another 10 minutes to install all I need but at that point I can already use my notebook). \n\nA: Following the offcial release upgrade path through the Update Manager or command line do-release-upgrade should not do any harm to your data in your home directory. I continuously upgraded one of my boxes since 9.10. and never had any data loss.\nBut\nWe do hear of people having issues during or after an upgrade. So even if I was never faced with these personally I always perfom a backup before I start the upgrade. This is the recommended way to secure our precious data.\nPlease also note, that Ubuntu 13.04 reaches it's end of life this month. Ubuntu 12.10 will be supported until April, but you will not have an upgrade path to a newer release by then. After January 2014 you will not be able to upgrade to or upgrade from Ubuntu 13.04. Therefore it is recommended you now also upgrade to Ubuntu 13.10. (after the upgrade to 13.04. was a success).\n\nA: If you're concerned about losing data like documents, music, videos, ebooks, and so forth, upgrading is very unlikely to destroy such personal data, even if the upgrade ends up going badly.\nThe reason for this is what while an upgrade might go wrong and leave your Ubuntu system unusable, you could then boot from a live CD/DVD/USB and retrieve your files. Upgrading carries some risk of breaking your OS installation, but there's no reason to think it carries an elevated risk of deleting or otherwise damaging your documents.\nOf course there is always a risk of hard disk failure, or you deleting your documents by accident, or a severe bug or security intrusion producing data loss. While I strenuously doubt any of these risks are made higher in an upgrade than they already are, it is with equal emphasis that I say, the other answer are right, it is important to keep backups at all times, whether or not you are upgrading.\n", "Q: Can I control the position of a console window on the screen? I want my c/c++ program's console window to chose a specific position. is it possible either within the program or by system call?\n\nA: There are X server extensions that allow a program to specify where a window it creates should be drawn.  I don't remember these off the top of my head, but given that it's part of the X libraries (which are presumably used directly or indirectly if the program is creating windows) they should be easy enough to find?\nIf, on the other hand, this is a console application looking to change the position and/or size of the virtual console from which it is launched... my understanding is that there is no system for doing so.  It's possible to discover its dimensions and terminate with a message if it's too small, but actual direct control is not possible.  This is because a console application could well be run in a dumb text console without the X (GUI) server running at all.\nAll that said:  I think this question would possibly be more at home on Stack Overflow than on Ask Ubuntu?\n", "Q: New hardrive for broken laptop, now like to install Ubuntu. How? I have broken the hard drive in my Acer laptop, so need to reinstall. I will get a new one, but how can I install Ubuntu?\nI have a USB with NetBoot on it, but how can I get it to work in the BIOS settings, and boot from it?\n\nA: To use a netboot install medium (I'm assuming something much like mini.iso?) it'll be necessary to have a wired internet connection.  If this isn't feasible, download the desktop USB image and use that for the install.  Frankly I'd suggest doing that anyway, as it's rather more user-friendly.\nAs for the actual process:  Ensure the laptop can boot from USB.  Install the new hard drive.  Insert the bootable USB.  Power the machine on and access the boot device selection part of the BIOS menu.  Choose to boot from the USB stick.  Install as per the instructions.  That ought to be enough, but for more specific advice do come back here!\nThe normal Ubuntu download page (and the best place to get a desktop image) is here, and instructions on its use can be found here\n", "Q: My bios will not recegnise Ubuntu as a valid os now I downloaded the ISO and burned it to a dvd. Restarted the Laptop and the bios tells me that Ubuntu is now an invalid OS. Is there some special thing you have to do to get it to boot now? I have had ubuntu on other Thinkpads before.\n\nA: It is possible that the new thinkpad is attempting to use UEFI boot, but that some setting is causing it to accept only Windows (this shouldn't happen, but my own laptop will only load Windows 8 by UEFI because it appears to be using some broken custom implementation.  This despite the fact that there's an MIT-licensed UEFI implementation out there, which most manufacturers use.  But I digress).  To test this, try making sure UEFI is disabled (it should be safe to change this temporarily) in the BIOS settings, then booting from the CD.

Because my computer did not support wired internet (it is a thin model; to thin for a \"thick\" RJ45) --> no port, I had to be \"creative\":\nI had to go back to windows (or another computer, whatever), search the internet for \"bcmwl-kernel-source.deb\" and download a recent copy and then put it on a USB drive (or store it on the windows partition, you know, anywhere linux can get at it.)\nThen, on Linux, open the file with Ubuntu Software Center.

Can you please post \n# cat /etc/passwd\n\n\nA: This \n[[ -s \"$HOME/.profile\" ]] && source \"$HOME/.profile\"\n\nwill source your .profile file in your .bashrc\nOn my Ubuntu install and I think on all Ubuntu/Debian install .profile contains this:\nif [ -n \"$BASH_VERSION\" ]; then\n    # include .bashrc if it exists\n    if [ -f \"$HOME/.bashrc\" ]; then\n        . \"$HOME/.bashrc\"\n    fi\nfi\n\nThat means your .profilealso sources your .bashrc.

Remove that line.\n(What I don't understand how can you login at all?)\n", "Q: IP address on virtual bridge? I would like to configure a static IP address on the virtual machine. This interface should be connected to one of the host physical interfaces via a bridge.\nIf I have understood the documentation correct, the physical interface attached to the bridge has no IP address. Only the Interface in the VM has to be configured with an IP address and must be on the same subnet like the default router which is a physical router connected behind a layer 2 infrastructure.\nAll the configuration examples shows an IP address configured on a virtual bridge. Why?\n\nA: If I'm interpreting your question wrong, just let me know and I will edit to suit\n\nIt is important to keep the distinction between host and guest clear, so I will try and do this with a hypothetical. I have a host (let's call it kvm1) with one physical NIC (eth0). That host is running one guest (let's creatively call it guest) which has been configured with one NIC. From inside guest, this NIC appears as eth1 (for clarity). If you want eth1 to have a static IP, all you need to do is add the IP using the /etc/network/interfaces file on guest, for example.\nNow for the host configuration on kvm1: I'm going to assume you're using /etc/network/interfaces to configure host networking and that you have created a br0 interface and added eth0 to it (whether using brctl or virt-manager or virsh). Now, as long as the guest's VM configuration has its single NIC set up to be attached to br0, you should be good to go.\nIf you're using virsh/virt-manager, you can try running brctl show from a terminal to check. You should have a vmnetX interface showing up as a member of br0, and your guest is now directly bridged to the physical interface eth0. Now, connect eth0 to the nearest Ethernet switch in your LAN subnet, and guest should retain its static IP and be accessible from the rest of the network.\n\nI'm hoping that made sense. \n", "Q: rotated monitor. login screen needs rotation I rotated my screen, and once I login, it works fine. \nBut, the greeter (login) screen hasn't got the message that things are rotated 90 degrees. How can I change the rotation of the login screen?  \n\nUPDATE:\nlock screen is in correct position. I only see this when I boot, or log out. \n\nA: falconer pretty much nailed it but I'd like to point out a simplification.\nYou can put an xrandr command directly in /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf as a system hook. You don't need to create a shell command to call a separate script containing a shell command (though of course you can if you see a reason to do so). Also, there's no mention of /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/ in man lightdm and I didn't have either this or lightdm.conf on my system. So, although I'm sure it probably does work as suggested by Stephen, again, you don't need to do this.\nSo, if it doesn't exist already, something along the lines of the following in /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf (sudo, obviously) should work just fine:\n[SeatDefaults]\ndisplay-setup-script=xrandr --output DVI-1 --auto --rotate left\n\nSee man xrandr for configuration options.\nBTW: I could probably have got away with comments/edits here but I don't have the rep and I did want to add the sources for this information.\nVersion\n$ lsb_release -a\nNo LSB modules are available.\nDistributor ID: Ubuntu\nDescription:    Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS\nRelease:    14.04\nCodename:   trusty\n\nReferences\n\n\n*\n\n*man xrandr\n\n*man lightdm\n\n*https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LightDM\n\nA: 16.04\nThe only fix that works for me is to copy ~/.config/monitors.xml to /var/lib/lightdm/.config/, similar to the method in Steve Dee's answer, but with a copy of the file rather than just a symlink to it. Making a symbolic link doesn't work.\nNeither falconer's nor Stephen Ostermiller's answer worked for me. I just saw the correctly rotated screen for 2 seconds after boot, then it rotated back to horizontal orientation.\n\nA: Add this line to the /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf file (in the [SeatDefaults] section):\ngreeter-setup-script=/etc/lightdm/greeter_setup.sh\n\nThen make the file /etc/lightdm/greeter_setup.sh with the following contents:\n#!/bin/bash\nxrandr -o left\nexit 0\n\nThen make it executable with sudo chmod +x /etc/lightdm/greeter_setup.sh. Then reboot.\n\nA: Another option that should work is to copy ~/.config/monitors.xml to /var/lib/lightdm/.config .\nThis certainly works for my monitor position and resolution information, so I would assume it would work for rotation too.\nEdit: For maximum flexibility, one could make a symbolic link between the above:\nsudo su\ncd /var/lib/lightdm/.config\nln -s /home/<your_user>/.config/monitors.xml .\nchown -h lightdm:lightdm monitors.xml\nexit\n\nThis way, if your monitor setup changes in the future, it will automatically reflected to the login screen. Notice the necessary -h flag on the chown command, as explained in chown is not changing symbolic link.\n\nA: 14.04 and above\nFalconer's answer helped me very much, but lightdm changed for Ubuntu Trusty 14.04.  There is no longer a /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf file on my system.  lightdm has now gone the \"Debian way\" and had its configuration broken up into a conf.d directory.  You now need to create the following file:\n/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/80-display-setup.conf\n[SeatDefaults]\ndisplay-setup-script=xrandr -o right\n\nAs suggested in Electric Head's answer, the xrandr command can go right in this file, no need to create a separate script.       \nIf you want a xrandr command that deals with multiple monitors, you can use arandr to generate it for you.  My xrandr command actually ends up being: \nxrandr --output DVI-1 --mode 1920x1080 --pos 1080x0 --rotate left --output DVI-0 --mode 1920x1080 --pos 0x0 --rotate right\n\nTo get that I used the following commands:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install arandr\n\n*arandr\n\n*Use the GUI to configure your monitors like you want them: \n\n*Use \"Layout\" -> \"Save As\" to save it to a file that contains your monitor configuration command.\n\n\nWith this in place, my monitors are properly rotated when I log in as well, so there is no need to do additional configuration in Gnome, XFCE, or KDE.  The only other place that I need to configure monitor rotation is in virtual framebuffer terminals, as explained in How do I rotate my display when not using an X Server?\n\nA: I had the same issue with the incorrect greeter screen in Ubuntu 18.04 on a vertical monitor. I tried some of the mentioned xrandr commands as indicated in other replies, but these did not work for me. I then followed the reply which advised to copy the ~/.config/monitors.xml file to the /var/lib/gdm3/.config directory. After rebooting the greeter screen still had the incorrect orientation.\nMy next step was to look to the contents of the /var/lib/gdm3/.config/monitors.xml file. I noticed that it contained a history of various monitors and configurations which I have used over the years. I edited this file to only contain the setup of the current configuration. \nThe structure of the monitors.xml file is that it contains one set of <monitors> and </monitors> tags, at the beginning and end of the file. In between these tags are one or more set(s) of <configuration> and </configuration> tags. Each of these sections contain one or more set(s) of <logicalmonitor> and </logicalmonitor> tags. Each of these sections specify one monitor, with parameters such as brand and type, orientation (if not horizontal), width, height, x, y and refresh rate. It also specifies if a monitor is the primary monitor. In my file was the current setup listed near the bottom of the file. I removed all <configuration> </configuration> sections which did not describe my current setup. The result looks like this:\n<monitors version=\"2\">\n  <configuration>\n    <logicalmonitor>\n      .. primary monitor specification (vertical)\n      <primary>yes</primary>\n      <transform>\n        <rotation>left</rotation>\n        <flipped>no</flipped>\n      </transform>\n    </logicalmonitor>\n    <logicalmonitor>\n      .. secondary monitor specification (horizontal)\n    </logicalmonitor>\n  </configuration>\n</monitors>\n\nNow I rebooted my computer. This time the screener window did have the correct orientation. I guess that the history as captured in the original monitors.xml file was causing issues.\n\nA: Have you tried xrandr -o value? As a value use either left or right\nAlso you can create a custom shortcut by following this HOW TO\n\nA: Same question and my results in 18.10:\nfalconer's answer is good. Let me add 2 details that I had to figure out in 18.10:\n\n\n*\n\n*Instead of [SeatDefaults] current versions expect [Seat:*]\n\n*More importantly: I had to experiment a little with the above script using logger and then xmessage to conclude, that it does get called, it does set things right, but then its effect is unfortunately undone by unity-greeter.\n\n\nI tried other greeters, and they all honor the solution and start up nicely rotated, except the default unity-greeter. I ended up using slick-greeter.\n", "Q: Nautilus error after upgrading from 12.10 to 13.04 The desktop icons were missing. I installed the compizconfig-settings manager to restore the icons.

I tried to partition and install Ubuntu 12.04 a week ago and got very far. I shrunk my Windows partition and formatted it for a fresh Ubuntu install to dual-boot alongside Win7. I got so far as the partition screen in Ubuntu and had no idea what I was doing at that point. I screwed around a bit and almost got through the installation until I received this error:\n\nThe title of the message was:\n\nUnable to install GRUB to /dev/dm-1\n\nAnd the contents of the message were:\n\nExecuting 'grub-install /dev/dm-1' failed.\nThis is a fatal error.\n\nI can't afford to screw up my Windows as I don't have another computer and have virtually no time to fix the mistakes except on the weekends. \nI know that there are a ton of posts on this but unfortunately, I have no idea what \"swap partitions\" or anything are. I'm literally brand new but don't want to start over from scratch. Is there any way I can do this safely without harming my existing windows partition?\n\nWhen I boot from the USB installer I created it doesn't give me the option to install alongside. Is this because I am not using the .iso and booting from that? If I could avoid the manual partitioning and let Ubuntu do it, I would gladly do so.\n\nA: The extra partiton Ubuntu can't use may be preventing it from automatically partitioning.\nYou said \"I shrunk my Windows partition and formatted it for a fresh Ubuntu install to dual-boot alongside Win7.\"\nIf you're able to shrink the Windows partition and you make sure to shut down or reboot Windows normally before attempting to install Ubuntu (that is, do not have Windows just hibernated when you boot the installer), Ubuntu should be able to make its own partitions. You said you shrunk down the Windows partition. I'm guessing you did this in the Disk Management utility in Windows or some other utility you're comfortable using (since you said you don't really know how to use the manual partitioning utility that's part of the Ubuntu installer).\nBut it sounds from what you said that you created a partition yourself for Ubuntu to use. Ubuntu will not automatically use this (and probably cannot, as NTFS is not supported and by default Ubuntu makes two partitions for itself).\nTherefore, the best thing to do--especially since your preference is for Ubuntu to partition itself, and that appears most in line with your needs--is to remove the empty partition you made for Ubuntu to use. I believe the odd error installing GRUB is probably the result of incorrect manual partitioning. If that is the case, it should go away if you can get Ubuntu to make its own partitions.\nAfter removing the partition you recently created, try booting the Ubuntu live CD/DVD/USB and attempting installation again. If there's free unpartitioned space on the disk large enough for Ubuntu to be installed comfortably, then Ubuntu's installer won't try to resize partitions, and it should just work.\n...Unless your whole disk is formatted as a Windows dynamic disk. Ubuntu cannot install to such a disk. In that case you'd have to convert it back to a \"basic disk\" (or install to a different physical drive). You probably are not--Windows does not make your disk \"dynamic\" unless you tell it to--but it is possible.\nRelated information:\n\n*\n\n*How do I install Ubuntu?\n\n*How can I install Ubuntu without removing Windows?\n\n*Install Alongside Windows or Something Else - Which should I use?\n\n*The official installation instructions.\n\n*\"Install alongside\" option missing. How do I install Ubuntu beside Windows using \"Something Else\"?\n\nShrink down the Windows partition manually in Windows, or leave it for Ubuntu's installer?\nYou asked:\n\nI did everything exactly as you guessed/described. I have since rejoined that partition back to my Windows partition. Just for final clarity, you are telling me NOT to partition anything at all from my current, existing windows C: partition and to just run Ubuntu from the USB/CD and it should be able to create its own?\n\nUbuntu's installer should be able to resize your Windows partition, but sometimes it is not able to do so (even if you are not currently hibernated in Windows). Since you are able and willing to repartition in Windows, I think it does make sense to create space for Ubuntu in Windows's Disk Management utility.\nHowever, this space should be unpartitioned. That is, it should not be a new additional partition, just empty space on the disk with no partition in it. This is the result of shrinking down the Windows partition without making a new one (or alternatively, of deleting the new one but not expanding the Windows partition).\n", "Q: Virtual console not reading ~/.bashrc I'm using Ubuntu 13.04, and have set up some custom functions in ~/.bashrc.\nThe custom functions work fine when I open a terminal within the GNOME environment.\nWhen I switch over to a virtual console (with Ctrl+Alt+F1), I don't get those functions.\nHow can I resolve this issue?\n\nA: Edit your ~/.profile or ~/.bash_profile to include the line:\n[[ -f ~/.bashrc ]] && . ~/.bashrc\n\n\nA: For more information about config files used by BASH please check below links\n\n\n*\n\n*Bash's behaviour\n\n*The Bash Shell Startup Files\n\n*Bash Startup Files\n", "Q: No sound - often problem Many times , when i open my pc the sound is dead , though when i go to system settings / audio , everything seems right. when I restart my computer the sound is back to normal again .

This can have irreversible side effects on your system and should be performed with supervision of an experienced user. If one is not available, I recommend you join #ubuntu on irc.freenode.net and ask for a mentor.\nNow on to troubleshooting your sound issues:\nReference the following community documentation: Community Documentation: Sound Troubleshooting Procedure\nThe easiest method to troubleshoot is to force pulse audio to restart\n1A. If you are using Ubuntu 12.04.3 LTS (Precise Pangolin) or later, try this first:\nkillall pulseaudio; rm -r ~/.config/pulse/* ; rm -r ~/.pulse*\n\nwait ten seconds, then run this:\npulseaudio -k \n\n1B. Should the approach above fail to correct the problem (it is only known to work on some variations), you can try this next. If you are using Ubuntu 12.04.3 LTS (Precise Pangolin) or later:\nkillall pulseaudio; rm -r ~/.config/pulse/* ; rm -r ~/.pulse*\n\nwait 10 seconds, then reboot (putting the machine to sleep is not enough -- fully power it off and then back on).

Why is it that almost all instructions regarding appending text to system files like fstab and /etc/apt/sources.list.d/<name>.list involve using tee and echo to append said text?\nTake the following examples, which are run as root:\n## 1\necho 'deb http://downloads-distro.mongodb.org/repo/ubuntu-upstart dist 10gen' | tee -a file1\n## 2\necho 'deb http://downloads-distro.mongodb.org/repo/ubuntu-upstart dist 10gen' >> file2\n\nRunning diff -u file1 file2 returns nothing; running md5sum file1 file2 shows their checksums are identical, which brings me back to my original question: \nWhy is the | tee <FILENAME> so prevalent across Ubuntu docs, is it just good practice, otherwise wouldn't it be easier to just use example 2 instead of passing the output from echo to tee?\n\nA: tee takes the standard input stream and writes it to both the standard output stream as well as a file stream. If it helps people remember, the command name comes from a T-splitter in plumbing.  There is a nice Wikipedia article where I learned about the origin of the command name. \n\n\n\nA: First of all, tee itself doesn't append text, nor does >. \nIt is tee -a and its complement, >> that APPENDS text.\nI don't believe all shells support the >> function, so that is why tee is more commonly used. (Think of just plain old sh). Tee is a command, while >> is an operator.\nIf you use (my personal favorite) bash, > and >> are much nicer/easier.\nUsing tee also allows you to sudo JUST that command so you don't have to sudo the entire statement, as in sudo sh -c \"echo foo > bar\". tee also allows you to split the output. Of course, all of this can be seen in man tee. It's mainly just your personal preference.\nFor further reading, see here and here.\n\nA: There is a difference: tee duplicates the output: it sends it both to the file and to the display.\nBut there is more:\n\n\n*\n\n*For example, if you want to write some string into two files at once, the command with tee you can use is: \n echo \"some text\" | tee file1 > file2  \n\n\n*Another thing tee can help you is to avoid one problem when using sudo. The normal output redirection operator is always executed with your user privileges, also when you write a sudo in front of the command which generates the STDOUT text. In other words, this will fail if you dont have the permission to write to that file: \n sudo echo \"something\" > bar  \n\nBut with tee, everything will go well: \necho \"something\" | sudo tee bar  \n\n2 examples from this site.

It can\n  switch and resize desktops and perform many other useful\n  operations.\n\nThen, man wmctrl tells us that the -l option will:\n\nList the windows being managed by the window  manager.  One\n  line  is  output  for  each window, with the line broken up\n  into space separated columns.  The first column always con‐\n  tains the window identity as a hexadecimal integer, and the\n  second column always contains the desktop number (a  -1  is\n  used  to  identify  a  sticky  window). If the -p option is\n  specified the next column will contain the PID for the win‐\n  dow  as  a  decimal  integer. If the -G option is specified\n  then four integer columns will follow: x-offset,  y-offset,\n  width  and  height.  The  next  column  always contains the\n  client machine name.

I think this will detect the Ubuntu installation and add make a menu to choose between Ubuntu or Windows.\n\nA: As you installed Ubuntu after installing Windows 8, you shouldn't have to change the boot order in the BIOS. Ubuntu installs a bootloader (GRUB) which should see Windows 8 and add it to it's startmenu.\nIf you change the boot order to the HDD, it doesn't work because Grub is not installed on the HDD.\nDoing a boot-repair as Wouter suggested is the best option to repair a lost bootloader. \n", "Q: Is Network Manager widget supposed to be installed by default in KDE?

It's working great so far except I can't get it to work with dual monitors unless I disable 3D acceleration (then it becomes too slow to use due to unity).\nAny ideas what I could try next?\n\nA: Virtual Box can provide up to eight virtual monitors for a guest operating system. These will be presented in multiple windows on the host. Only in fullscreen mode (or seamless mode if supported by the guest) we can address the physical monitors attached to the host.\n\nHowever, in full screen and seamless mode, they will use the available physical monitors attached to the host. As a result, for full screen and seamless modes to work with multiple monitors, you will need at least as many physical monitors as you have virtual monitors configured, or VirtualBox will report an error. You can configure the relationship between guest and host monitors using the view menu by pressing Host key + Home when you are in full screen or seamless mode.Virtual Box Manual\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Fullscreen mode may need the guest additions to be installed in the guest OS. \n\n*Seamless mode is not working correctly in the guest OS when running OpenGL with Compiz as the compositing manager.\n", "Q: Strange POST requests to my Ubuntu server - am I in trouble? I have an Ubuntu Server 12.04 installed on a VM. This server has apache2-mpm-prefork  and libapache2-mod-php5  installed.

If you are not running it, you should be pretty safe. This is a quote about how the attack is done from Computer World:\n\nA command executed by the exploit contains several arguments that are intended to disable security mechanisms that might exist on the server, he said. These include the “allow_url_include=on” argument which allows the attacker to include arbitrary PHP code and the “safe_mode=off” argument. “As a final step Suhosin, a PHP hardening patch, is put into simulation mode. This mode is designed for application testing, and effectively turns off the extra protection.”\n\nIn the POST request we can see the 3 vertices of the attack, which is in fact the first 3 commands sent -d allow_url_include=on -d safe_mode=off -d suhosin.simulation=on. The rest is just crawling more in your server.\nYou may want to know more about the CVE-2012-1823 that address this issue. Parallels provided a workaround to protect their users/costumers. This issue has been fixed in all versions of Ubuntu, only old unmaintained servers are in danger. If you are using version equal or superior than 5.3.10-1ubuntu3.1 of php5-cgi, you are out of danger.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.10 Press S To Skip Mount Or M For Manual Recovery corrupted fstab can't modify I recently made changes to my fstab file and, upon reboot, noticed I had an error in it. I get the typical mount error on boot. I went to try and modify it by entering the read-only mode but then, since it's read only, I can't access it. Is there a way around this or some way to delete the file so I can use the backup (which I'm pretty sure works)?\n\nA: Remount the filesystem read/write, either using the option on the menu, or by running mount -o remount,rw /\n", "Q: Curious about the text when booting So whenever I boot up Ubuntu or shut it down, it displays the whole process on black screen with white text, instead of showing only the loading screen of ubuntu.  Why is that?  It does not look really good..\n\nA: If you want to disable the text boot, you can do that. Here's how:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal window (press Ctrl + Alt + T) and to edit the /etc/default/grub file type:\nsudo nano /etc/default/grub\nthis should open the file. Look for the line GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT= and change its value to \"quiet splash\" so that the line would look like GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\n\n*Press Ctrl + O to save the edits, and Ctrl + X to exit the editor,\n\n*Now, run this command:\nsudo update-grub\n\n\nA: Many Linux distros will display the boot loading process and the shutdown process in a command-line style. This happens before the window manager has loaded, and after it has closed down. It's normal, though not always pretty. I've never investigated if there are any methods to make those processes \"quiet\". In some cases, it can be handy if something goes awry during those processes, as it is a command shell of sorts and you might be able to recover from an error though it, or see what process is causing problems.\n", "Q: Is it possible to toggle between Ubuntu and Windows 7 with the click of a button? I would like to know if there is any kind of software that will allow me to have Ubuntu and Windows side-by-side and toggle between them instantly.\nSay, for instance, I'm on Windows then by clicking on a button, Windows would be suspended and Ubuntu would be initiated (and vice versa).\nIs this possible/available?\n\nA: The only way to easily switch between windows and Ubuntu OS's was by running Ubuntu on virtual machine softwares like VMware,virtualbox,etc.\n\nA: Short answer: impossible. A virtual machine is the closest you can get to that.\nLong answer: an operating system requires constant access to the hardware. The operating system needs to be built to allow dynamic switching in mind for such a thing be come to reality.\nP.S.: With an SSD, you can hibernate between operating systems pretty darn fast, but that will dramatically reduce the longevity of your SSD.\n", "Q: Wubi fails to install Lubuntu 12.04 Exception: Could not retrieve the required installation files\n\nThat happens everytime Wubi is finished installing Lubuntu.

Any help is greatly appreciated.\n\nA: This doesn't seem to be supported any longer by Avast.

I decided to delete everything on the hard drives and tried a fresh Ubuntu install.\nHow do I setup all the partitions for all the drives? The only pointers that I found were for setting up partitions for only 1 HDD, but that didn't work for me. I followed these steps, but after installing and rebooting I get a black screen that says:\n\nerror : no such partition    grub rescue>\n\nI tried installing and running boot repair, but nothing changes. I still get that error and Ubuntu doesn't boot. Following the steps above, I have only partitioned 1 HDD, the 160 GB one, with a 4GB partition for the swap area and the rest of the available memory is for the ext4 partition - for my Ubuntu install. The other hard drives remain intact and are seen as free space. How can I partition all my drives and install Ubuntu correctly?\nOn the first install, I have stumbled upon some other problems as follows:\n\n*\n\n*My motherboard has an integrated sound card (the only one I have available) Realtek Ac97, but after install only my front 2 speakers work. I have a 5.1 sound system that is connected via my 3 jack ports, rear speakers plugged in the auxiliary jack port, mid/subwoofer plugged into the microphone port. I followed another guide that said I should change the alsamixer channels from 2 to 6 (for 5.1), but I don't know if this works as my Ubuntu crashed because of my next problem.\n\n\n*Ubuntu asked me to update my Nvidia driver. It gave me a list of possible updates and due to my inexperience, I chose the one that had (Recommended) at the end of the line. It asked me to reboot, but after the reboot, I got to a screen full of loading commands with one faulty line:\n\nStarting load fallback graphics devices [fail]\n\nThese 2 problems can wait because for the moment, I can't run anything on my desktop.\nEdit: I installed Ubuntu from a USB flash that I made and there doesn't seem to be any problems with it.\n\nA: Was Win8 completely erased and are you gonna reinstall it?\nI'd suggest splitting the smallest HDD evenly between the two and using the other for both as media (like I do).\nNVidia + Ubuntu = Bad\nThere's probably a better way, but I'd suggest using a Live CD/USB to back up your files and do yet another fresh install. Make sure you have wired internet plugged up during installation.\n\nA: So it seems like you killed your nvidia drivers. I assume that after boot, you have a blank screen (and maybe hear the drum sounds).\nAs this answer may help new linux users during their first install (since failing Nvidia is a common problem), I will be very descriptive in the following explanations.\nWe'll first go in a shell. What you usually use in Ubuntu is X (or desktop environnement). That's just a nice and sleek graphical interface to interact with your computer. Other than that, you can interact with the computer through a text interface\n\nWhat to do (paritions)\nInstalling Ubuntu Alongside a Pre-Installed Windows with UEFI\nIt treats the issue with pre-installed windows on which you slap over Ubuntu. This direction (windows first, linux second), is usually the easiest get things to work out.\n\nWhat to do (fix grub)\nYou will want to install the grub from one of your linux partition, since sometimes, boot-repair fails. Let me explain.\nWe will first boot from a live-cd, then chroot in your linux partition, then call update-grub. To \"chroot\" means to make the shell think the root directory is in a different place. It allows terminal access to a partition as if you booted from if. You can use that method to run an apt-get update, too.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from live-usb.\n\n*In a terminal (or shell: ctrl+alt+F1), call sudo fdisk -l\n\n*Find your linux partition. I will assume your partition is /dev/sda1 from now on, but it may be sdb2 or else\n\n*Call sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt.\n\n*Mount the filesystems too. This allows you to call the partition’s commands while chrooted.: \nmount -t proc none /mnt/proc\nmount -o bind /dev /mnt/dev\nmount -o bind /sys /mnt/sys\nNow, just call sudo chroot/mnt, and you're in your partition. We'll install, check and update the grub:\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda\nsudo grub-install --recheck /dev/sda\nsudo update-grub\n\nNote that you only call the drive name (sda) and not the partition name (sda1).\n\nWhat to do (graphic card)\nOnce your computer is fully booted, press ctrl+alt+f1 until you see the shell appear. you should see:\nUbuntu 12.04.4 LTS <computer> tty1\n\n<computer> login:\n\nFor reference, \"tty1\" just means you're using shell #1. By default, you have access to 6 independent shells through ctrl+alt+F1-6.\n\nFirst let's clear all nvidia drivers installed. Call the following commands:\nsudo service light-dm stop\nsudo apt-get purge nvidia*\n\nThe first line stops the graphical interface, in case it was active but failing. The second removes anything Nvidia related, as the asterisk can be anything. Finally, the \"sudo\" part that precedes the commands just means \"superuser do\". It allows you do anything to your computer, including irremediably corrupting it. Whenever possible, try not to use sudo, but this case requires it.\n\nNext, we'll install nvidia drivers:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current nvidia-settings\n\nFirst line adds a repository where packages can be fetched from. We need to get the drivers from there. \nThe second line triggers an update: your package list will be checked, and if any discrepancies between available versions and installed versions, they will be downloaded. Note that it only downloads \"minor\" updates such as bug fixes. Usually, little to no new functionalities are installed by running apt-get update.\nThe third line installs both the nvidia-current package and the nvidia-settings packages.\nFrom there, call sudo shutdown -r now to trigger a restart.\n\nIf it doesn't work\nWe'll try different versions of the drivers.\nsudo apt-get purge nvidia*\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-XXX nvidia-settings\n\nAgain, remove all nvidia packages and install the new one. From personal experience, XXX can be any of the following: 331, 325, 319, 304. Older versions (like 304 on certain Nvidia models) will not support things like 3D acceleration, so I would recommend trying 331, 325, 319, 304, in that order\n\nIf it doesn't work (bis)\nThen it means the current drivers don't mix well with your system. We'll trigger a dist-upgrade, then install the drivers again.\nsudo apt-get purge nvidia*\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get instal nvidia-current nvidia-settings\n\nThe dist-upgrade line will upgrade your whole install to the newest versions of all packages. \n", "Q: How to publish my joomla site on local server to the web?

I feel like I have scoured the internet and the forums here for an answer but none of the suggestions or how to guides are helping. Now, onto the problem.\nMy Ubuntu CD will not boot, no matter what I do. Every time I try to boot from a CD/DVD or USB, Windows 8 boots instead. I have already disabled Fast Start Up in my Power Options; I have disabled Secure Boot in my BIOS (I even left it enabled to see if that would work); I changed my boot up options in the BIOS to load either a CD/DVD or USB first (depending on which one I was using at the time); I used the boot up options menu to select which device I wanted to load from; I downloaded Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit AND 13.10 64-bit, created separate CD/DVDs of each, and even created a bootable USB device for each one (I was hoping that one of the CD/DVDs or USB sticks would work). I re-downloaded and re-created bootable CD/DVDs and USB sticks (after formatting the USB sticks), hoping that it was just a download error or image burn error that prevented from the CD/DVDs and USBs from not booting. I tried wubi, which will not fully install for whatever reason. I even updated my BIOS, hoping that would fix some kind of boot up problem. I just can't figure out why Ubuntu will not load.\nI managed to get it to install when I changed to Legacy mode, but in order to go between the two operating systems, I'd have to change the BIOS from UEFI to CSM or vice versa.

Is anything listening on port 8000? If nothing is listening on a port but the port is not blocked by a firewall nmap will report it as closed. From here:\n\nclosed\nA closed port is accessible (it receives and responds to Nmap probe packets), but there is no application listening on it. They can be helpful in showing that a host is up on an IP address (host discovery, or ping scanning), and as part of OS detection. Because closed ports are reachable, it may be worth scanning later in case some open up. Administrators may want to consider blocking such ports with a firewall. Then they would appear in the filtered state, discussed next.\n\nSo the nmap report: \"996 closed ports\" actually say that those ports are not blocked by a firewall but no program is listening on them. nmap reports a blocked port as filtered:\n\nfiltered\nNmap cannot determine whether the port is open because packet filtering prevents its probes from reaching the port. The filtering could be from a dedicated firewall device, router rules, or host-based firewall software. ...\n\nSo if you put an application in listening state on port 8000 it will likely show up in the output of nmap. You can do this if you just run python3 -m http.server or python -m SimpleHTTPServer on the machine on which you are trying to open the ports, this will put a HTTP server listening on port 8000. Then run nmap again to scan the machine.\nUPDATE:\nYour netstat output has this line:\ntcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:8000          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      4134/python  \n\nThat means your python program is only listening on localhost (127.0.0.1), so it is only accessible from localhost, not from outside. The program has to listen on the IP of your network adapter or on the universal 0.0.0.0 IP. The problem is what I wrote above, no program is listening on the 8000 port (from the outside world) so nmap says it is closed.\n\nA: To Enable Port In Ubuntu\nsudo ufw allow <port_nr>\n\ne.g to allow ssh\nsudo ufw allow 22\n\nsudo ufw enable\n\nThats IT\n", "Q: RTL8188EE doesn't detect any wireless signal I am new to Linux, and I finally got 12.04 to dual boot with windows 8.

Yesterday I decided to re-install Ubuntu using a bootable USB. I should have chosen the custom option and picked out a specific partition to install Ubuntu into since I already had a working dual booting version of Grub but I just chose the automatic re-install option for Ubuntu. \nAfter the re-install I found I could not longer boot into Windows 8. I had experienced this before and was prepared for it but to my surprise, when I booted into the BIOS there was no option to use the Windows Boot Loader. So I went back into Ubuntu and found out that there were only two partitions on my normal hard drive. The normal Windows partition and the, also normal, Windows Recovery partition, but nothing else (before there had been a Windows boot partition). My SSD has the correct Grub Boot, Ubuntu, and Ubuntu Swap partitions, Ubuntu works fine and I can still access all my Windows files through Nautilus or the terminal. I just can't boot into Windows.\nI tried the boot repair utility provided by Canonical and a few other things but have had no luck. Grub started showing a Windows 8.1 option after doing a few things and running sudo update-grub but when I select it I get the following:  \n\nI do not have a Windows Recovery CD and do not know how to make a Windows Recovery USB from Ubuntu. I am at a loss and DO NOT want to have to re-install Windows because the amount of stuff I have on there will take weeks to completely recover.\nAny suggestions on how to get my Windows Boot Partition back?\nI don't even care if Grub can't find it.

Make sure that the volume you make active is not the same one as the one with your Windows OS in it or the System Recovery Information on it. For me it was Volume 1.\nAlso GParted did not show the volume I used with DISKPART. I think this is because there is a difference between Volumes and Partitions although Microsoft claims the term is interchangeable.\nI was able to boot Windows by using the BIOS boot menu or the Grub menu.

Any ideas or help would be great.\n\nA: If I'm interpreting your question wrong, just let me know and I will edit to suit\n\nWhat you're suggesting is definitely possible and is in fact easier with virtualised networking than traditional physical stuff (think VLANs in place of separate switches). In your example, you have br0 and br1. I'm going to assume that br0 is your service network and br1 is your management network. In that case, what you have sounds about right.\nOn your guest, you need two NICs, one connected to br0 (eth0 in your example) and configure applications on your guest (FTPD, syslogd, apache, whatever) to use eth0 (or to bind to eth0's address more accurately). Your guest's other NIC, eth1 should be configured with a static IP of its own, and configure applications like SSH to listen on eth1's address. You have now got the same concept as most network appliances.\nCheck that on your host you have a physical interface connected to your services network (let's call it net0 for clarity), and add it to the br0 bridge. Connect your host's other physical NIC (let's call it net1) to your management network (if you're using managed switches, that's just a matter of adding the ports to the right VLANs). Add net1 to br1 on the host, and you're good to go.\n\nComing from networking, I see what you mean, but in server-world it is a bit more manual to achieve the same effect.\n", "Q: Upstart service not starting when a service it depends on starts I have a service called service C.

However, When I start A, C doesn't start unless I stopped and started B as well. \nI want C to run whenever A and B are both running, and the above conditions don't achieve that. Any ideas on what the start conditions should look like?\nThanks!\n\nA: Change your start stanza to 'or' like so:\nstart on ( started A or started B )\nThen add a pre-start script that checks whether both services are running, and abort the start if they aren't. Something like:\npre-start script\n  if [ -z `status A | grep running` ] || [ -z `status B | grep running` ]; then\n    stop ; exit 0\n  fi\nend script\n\nSee the 'pre-start' section of the cookbook. There's probably a better way to check if a service is running, but this works for me.

Whenever a sound is playing, the volume icon in the bar goes between normal and mute icon about 10 times a second, and the sound I hear is according. And when I adjust the volume either with the keyboard buttons or with the slider that comes from the said volume icon, it seems like something is trying to put it back to where it was.

Dell XPS has the following option in Windows 8: I assume it's a hardware switch that is set somehow, so does it stick when rebooting to Ubuntu? Is there a way to check or switch this option from Linux?\nI assume there's a driver somewhere since Dell makes the XPS 13, a Linux-preinstalled version of the XPS.\n\n\nA: As previous answers have mentioned, this is not a hardware switch, but instead a software function. There is a kernel module available (tp-smapi-dkms), but it only works for Lenovo ThinkPads.\nEnabling this function on your Dell laptop would require you or the vendor to write and implement a kernel module for your laptop model, the same way as they wrote the software for Windows.\nRight now, your best bet is to unplug the battery manually when it's reached 80%. If you have some coding skills, you can use acpitool and notify-send to write an script to let you know when the battery has reached its 80%. acpitool -B will display information about your battery, from where you can grep some information.\ntl;dr: No, you cannot do it at this point, your vendor would need to write the software as it's not a hardware switch.\n\nA: no, it is not a hardware swtich. it is a software function. you can even set the same thing to happen in ubuntu. look at the link below for clarification.\nHow can I limit battery charging to 80% capacity?\n\nA: Dell longevity feature is only usable on Windows OS via driver.\nDell haven`t developed any program to support that feature on Linux, also there no third party drivers for that.\nMy thinkpad Supports Tp smapi that allows battery charging and discharging control, hard drive active protection.\n\nA: For what it's worth, on the Dell XPS 15 (model 9550), this option seems to work in linux if you enable in the BIOS. That is, the XPS 15 provides both an Windows tool (Dell Command Power Manager, or something like that) and BIOS options to set the battery change behavior.\nIf you set the BIOS options, they seem to work in Ubuntu. That is, I've set it to 90% max change, and the change state in Ubuntu goes up to 89% and stays there. \nThere are some inconsistencies though - sometimes it breaks through the 89% barrier and goes up to 100%. I haven't figured that out yet.\n\nA: There is a command line tool from dell\nhttps://www.dell.com/support/article/de/de/debsdt1/sln311302/dell-command-configure?lang=en\nwhich is probably doing what you want\nhttps://www.dell.com/support/manuals/de/de/debsdt1/command-configure-v3.3/dellcommandconfigure-cli-3.3/--peakshiftbatterythreshold?guid=guid-82cdbc77-c6ed-4590-ac36-281862cf0593&lang=en-us\n\nA: I just stumbled upon this link and it looks like it's working..\nNo errors.

Here we intend feature a collection of 5 really good bit torrent clients for Ubuntu which we think are among the best.\nDeluge Bit Torrent Client\nDeluge is among my favorite bit torrent clients for Ubuntu. It is fast, slick and packed with all sorts of functionalities. Deluge is not available in Ubuntu by default, but its in the repositories.\n\nTo install sudo apt-get install deluge\nNow, if you want to install the latest bleeding edge version of Deluge instead, you need to do the following in Terminal.\n    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deluge-team/ppa\n    sudo apt-get update \n    sudo apt-get install deluge\nTransmission Bit Torrent Client\nAs you all should know already, Transmission is the default bit torrent client in Ubuntu for a long time now. Transmission is a nice mix of simplicity and functionality. And it is my second favorite bit torrent client(after Deluge). It incorporates all the basic features you would expect from a torrent client.\n\nTo install sudo apt-get install transmission\nTransmission is available by default in Ubuntu. But if you want to install the latest bleeding edge version of browser in Ubuntu, you need to do the following in Terminal.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:transmissionbt/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nqBittorrent Bit Torrent Client\nThe qBittorrent project aims to provide a Free Software alternative to µtorrent. Additionally, qBittorrent runs and provides the same features on all major platforms including Linux, Mac OS X and Windows. Like the ones we featured before, qBittorrent is also available in Ubuntu repositories by default.\n\nTo install sudo apt-get install qbittorrent\nNow, if you want to install the latest bleeding edge(and unstable) version of qBittorrent instead, you need to do the following in Terminal.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:hydr0g3n/qbittorrent-unstable\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install qbittorrent\n\nKTorrent Bit Torrent Client\nThis is not really a tailor made bit torrent client for Ubuntu GNOME. KTorrent is a KDE application and it looks complete out of place in a GNOME desktop. But apart from that, from a functionality point of view, KTorrent is a more than adequate torrent client of Ubuntu.\n\nTo install sudo apt-get install ktorrent\nYou can install latest version under development version of KTorrent instead via Kubuntu backports PPA(though I haven't tried it myself). \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:kubuntu-ppa/backports\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ktorrent\n\nVuze Bit Torrent Client\nVuze bit torrent client is also a widely used alternative among Ubuntu users.

How do I use it? I've seen a few mentions about DKMS recently but it's not clear what it's actually doing on my system.\nWhat does DKMS actually do and how do I use it?\n\nA: \nDKMS (Dynamic Kernel Module Support) package (http://linux.dell.com/dkms/) provides support for installing supplementary versions of kernel modules. The package compiles and installs into the kernel tree. Uninstalling restores the previous modules. By default, installation is into the current kernel tree, but any kernel tree can be selected with command-line options. Furthermore, DKMS is called automatically upon installation of new Ubuntu kernel-image packages, and therefore modules added to DKMS will be automatically carried across updates. \nOverview\nTo use a module with DKMS, one places the module installation files (could be source code or binary) in /usr/src/-, along with a configuration file dkms.conf that tells DKMS how to build/configure the module and what its name is. Under more advanced scenarios, conditional build instructions and patching can be done by the dkms system, but considering on your case this may not be necessary. \nWalk-through\nLet's say you want to install a module for your fancy \"Awesome Adaptor.\" You are given a source tarball awesome-20091211-v1.1.tgz. \nWith DKMS, we tell DKMS how to do that for you by creating a dkms.conf file with the appropriate entries. For example, after we've unpacked the tarball:\n\n# cd awesome-20091211-v1.1/\n# touch dkms.conf \n# create dkms.conf file\n# vi dkms.conf\n\n\nInside dkms.conf, we might add the lines:\n\nMAKE=\"make -C src/ KERNELDIR=/lib/modules/${kernelver}/build\"\nCLEAN=\"make -C src/ clean\"\nBUILT_MODULE_NAME=awesome\nBUILT_MODULE_LOCATION=src/\nPACKAGE_NAME=awesome\nPACKAGE_VERSION=1.1\nREMAKE_INITRD=yes\n\n\nAll directories are with respect to the location of the dkms.conf file. This tells DKMS\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*The command to build the module (run make in the directory src/). \n  \n*The command to clean the source tree (run make clean in the directory src/).\n  \n*The name of the module without the .o or .ko extension. This may actually be an array of modules if multiple modules are built, see man dkms.\n  \n*Where DKMS can find the built module.\n  \n*The name and version DKMS should associate with the module(s).\n  \n*To remake the initrd image after installing the module.\n  \n  \n  You can also add options to call scripts before or after build or install, provide additional (conditional) make commands, patch commands, etc. The dkms.conf is in fact sourced into a shell script, so a fair amount of trickery can be done if necessary. These options and more are described in the dkms.conf section in man dkms.\nNext, we install the module into DKMS by copying the module installation files into the kernel source tree /usr/src/- and tell DKMS about the new module:\n\n# ls\n    README dkms.conf lib src\n# sudo cp -R . /usr/src/awesome-1.1\n# sudo dkms add -m awesome -v 1.1\n    dkms does its thing...\n\n\nThat's it! DKMS has now added our module to its list of modules to build for future kernel installations. To make sure it works and to install the module into our current kernel, we can instruct dkms to build and install the module:\n\n# sudo dkms build -m awesome -v 1.1\n    dkms does its thing.... watch for build errors... you may need to tweak dkms.conf\n# sudo dkms install -m awesome -v 1.1\n    dkms does its thing.... module is copied into current kernel module tree\n\n\nWith some luck, your module will be installed and reinstalled into future kernel updates. \nExamples\nThe DKMS man page has helpful information on setting up your favorite kernel module for use with DKMS. It is not comprehensive documentation, but it will answer lots of questions. It may help you to note the following examples, even if the modules used are not the ones you want to setup:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*RocketRaid - Two examples on how-to setup the Highpoint RocketRaid drivers RR26xx and RR62x with DKMS. \n  \n\nFrom: help.ubuntu.com\nMore information can be found here:\n\n\n*\n\n*DKMS how-to with the latest Intel E1000E driver\n\n*DkmsDriverPackage.

I have a terribly limited download allowance and have multiple computers. So, my questions folks is. Would I be able to save what has been installed thru apt-get and any other terminal installations I attempt?\n\nA: When you install a package using apt-get corresponding deb files are downloaded in your /var/cache/apt/archives. Unless user deletes them all those files should be there. You can copy and preserve them for future use. \nAll you need is to set a local repository[Source]. Then you could install all those packages as usual using apt-get from it. Make a folder localrepo say at you home directory and put all the .deb files from /var/cache/apt/archives in it.\n$ mkdir ~/localrepo\n$ cp /var/cache/apt/archives/*.deb .\n\nNext you need to create an index file for your repository. For that you need to install dpkg-dev (on your source machine only). \n$ sudo apt-get install dpkg-dev\n\nTo create index file,\n$ cd ~/localrepo\n$ dpkg-scanpackages . /dev/null | gzip -9c > Packages.gz\n\nIt will create an index file named Packages.gz in ~/localrepo. In future you just need to copy the whole ~/localrepo to other machines where you want to install. If you modify the deb files in ~/localrepo you also need to update the index file.\nNow you need to show apt-get the repo editing your source list in all machines where you want to install packages from your local repository. First backup your original source.list\n$ sudo cp /etc/apt/source.list /etc/apt/source.list.original\n$ sudo gedit /etc/apt/source.list\n\nWrite the following line in it and save,\ndeb file:/home/<user_name>/localrepo ./\n\nReplace <user_name> with your exact user name. Now you are ready to install any package that exists in your source machine. \nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install <package_name>\n\nYou may need to give additional affirmation. As the repository is not trusted. For home use purpose it should be just enough as creation of a trusted repo requires quite a lot extra efforts. But your software center will not probably work with untrusted repo. But the advantage is that it will take care of all the dependencies for a package by itself.\nIf your /var/cache/apt/archives in your source machine do not contain any package. You can download deb files for all your existing packages using the following command in terminal,[Source]\ndpkg -l | grep \"^ii\"| awk ' {print $2} ' | xargs sudo apt-get -y install --reinstall --download-only\n\n\nA: Assuming you have a server/spare box, you can setup Apt-Cacher, which will store all of the .deb files for you.\n", "Q: How to remove or delete single cron job using linux command?

For example I want to remove cron job \"0 0 * * * wget php -q http://www.example.com/event_reminder.php\" from server.\nI tried crontab -r command which removes all cron job from my server but i want to remove specific cron job.\nCan you please help me for solution?\n\nA: crontab -l | grep -v 'wget php -q http://www.example.com/event_reminder.php' | crontab -\n\ncrontab -l lists the current crontab jobs\ngrep -v filter some line\ncrontab - adds all the printed stuff into the crontab file.\n\nA: From a root prompt type\ncrontab -e\n\nYou can now edit the file and remove the line you want remove. You can also use this to edit crontab for users if you have the prompt for that user.\nBy the way: I prefer to add cronjobs to /etc/crontab. Seems a bit more flexible to me.\n\nA: To comment out the cron job at say line 2, use this command in your shell:\ncrontab -l | sed '2 s/^/#/g' | crontab -\n\nReplace the number 2 by the line number of your choice, or remove it altogether to comment out all the jobs.\nIt can be programmatically called via a cron job itself, for instance to comment all jobs at 12:00, add this line to your crontab:\n0 12 * * * crontab -l | sed 's/^/#/g' | crontab -\n\n\nA: View Users Cronjob\nUse the following syntax to view waqleh user's cronjob:\ncrontab -u waqleh -l\n\nView current user's Cronjob\nJust type the following command:\ncrontab -l\n\nSpecific user's cron file\ncrontab -u USERNAME -l\n\nThis should list the contents of the crontab script. \nView /etc/crontab\nA cronjob can be also run from /etc/crontab file. To view it, enter:\nless /etc/crontab\n\nRemove all cron jobs\nIf and only if you want to stop all cron jobs, you can remove them entirely with:\ncrontab -r\n\nThis removes the entire crontab file for current user so be careful if you've got other cron jobs listed in there!\nAdd/Edit/Delete cron job(s)\nYour user's cron file\ncrontab -e\n\nSpecific user's cron file\ncrontab -u USERNAME -e\n\neach line represent a cron job. You can remove any cron (if you are using nano by clicking ctrl+k) then save and exit\n\nA: *\n\n*To add a job to crontab:\n(crontab -u mobman -l ; echo \"*/5 * * * * perl /home/mobman/test.pl\") | crontab -u mobman -\n\n\n*To remove a job from crontab:\ncrontab -u mobman -l | grep -v 'perl /home/mobman/test.pl'  | crontab -u mobman -\n\n\n*Remove everything from crontab:\ncrontab -r\n\nNothing is tricky: - is STDOUT in Linux!\n\nA: For those who like me can't get out of vi:\nEDITOR=nano crontab -e\n\nIn editor you can delete/change everything what you want\n\nA: You can run crontab without arguments, and feed it the new crontab via stdin.\n\nA: The best way to go about removing individual crontab jobs is simply to go into the script and comment out the line of script that performs the operation.\n", "Q: Dell XPS15 L502x Mini Display Port not working Ubuntu 13.04 Before i had Ubuntu 12.10 running on this laptop and the mini display port worked.

ClamAV is in the official security software repositories from Canonical, but on running freshclam, it reports:\nClamAV update process started at Tue Jan 21 10:31:59 2014\nWARNING: Your ClamAV installation is OUTDATED!\nWARNING: Local version: 0.97.8 Recommended version: 0.98.1\n\n(I have backports repo enabled, too.)\nI would assume that there's little point with a virus scanner that is not up to date. I can think of two answers, I'm hoping the second is correct:\n\n\n*\n\n*Canonical don't take security seriously in this regard, you'll have to go outside the software centre to download something from elsewhere. I can't accept this from the most secure popular OS available\nEDIT: I feel me stating my opinion on Canonical's policy in the question has skewed the tone of answers. All answers say (2) but in fact answer (1): you have to fetch in code from outside Ubuntu LTS, probably because those people can accept this as fine.\n\n*You clearly haven't done X. Type this or click that, and you'll get proper security updates for Ubuntu LTS from official sources.\nPlease advise! Thanks.\n\nA: There is an option three: \n3. The packagers at Canonical make a well-considered trade-off between stability and security, and you should worry less.\nAs the next three lines of your freshclam output most likely show (please add them to the question), your virus definitions are up to date. That's because Canonical -- or rather Debian, who do the original packaging of the package -- take security seriously.\nWhat your freshclam output does show is that the installed software version (0.97.8) is behind the current production release (0.98.1). That's because Debian and Canonical are also serious about stability, in particular for an LTS release. You are on 12.04 for a reason, right?\nTo judge how well the packagers have made the stability-security trade-off, examine the ClamAV change log. I count 18 changes, 11 of which are not security-related or for different target platforms, leaving us with the following 7 potential security improvements (against an unknown number of newly introduced bugs):\n * Improvements to OLE2 extraction and scanning\n * xz file type support\n * bb #1570: Support ADC compression in DMG\n * libclamav: Add support for scanning xar/pkg archive files.\n * bb #8385: PDF ASCII85Decode zero-length fix\n * libclamav: SCAN_ALL mode fixes\n * bb #7436: elf64 header early exit\n\nTrade-offs like security-stability are difficult to make, in particular for someone who isn't well informed.

Note that this does not work - first you'll get errors like:\ndpkg: error: parsing file '/var/lib/dpkg/status' near line 8140 package 'ipe':\n field name `#,' must be followed by colon\nE: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (2)\n\n... then if you try to add that colon, as in #:, you'll get:\ndpkg: error: parsing file '/var/lib/dpkg/status' near line 8141 package 'ipe':\n user-defined field name `#' too short\nE: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (2)\n\nApparently, these files do not use comments; and they seem to be documented in Debian Policy Manual - Control files and their fields. Then I found:\n#353040 - [DPKG-DEB] don't be so noisy about user defined fields in DEBIAN/control - Debian Bug report logs\n\nThe right way to include a field in the .deb is to use\n  fields named \"XB-*\".\n\n... so, basically, instead of using a comment character to \"comment out\" - I just used an user-defined field, instead, which I arbitrarily called XB-Ignore:; so that portion of /var/lib/dpkg/status ended up looking like this: \nPackage: ipe\n...\nDepends: libc6 (>= 2.4), libcairo2 (>= 1.2.4), libgcc1 (>= 1:4.1.1), libipe7.0.10, liblua5.1-0, libqtcore4 (>= 4:4.6.$\nXB-Ignore: , texlive-latex-base, gsfonts\n...\n\nWith this change saved, I could perform the install using apt-get directly, without a problem:\n$ sudo apt-get install dropbox\nReading package lists...

I would like to add emblems to a file in Thunar using a script, but I can't find any documentation on this.\nIs it possible to do this? And if so, how?\nThe same question was asked here, but they mention a ~/.cache/Thunar/metafile.tdb file which does not exist on my system. I think that question and the answer are outdated.\n\nA: Thunar, since version 1.6, has started using the gvfs-metadata daemon to store metadata.  The metadata is stored in ~/.local/share/gvfs-metadata, however you can't read it from the files (it's stored in some binary format I think). In order to read metadata you use the gvfs-info command like this:  \ngvfs-info -a metadata:: /some/location  \n\nWhich will print out the metadata of /some/location.  \nIf you want to change metadata you can use the gvfs-set-attribute command like this:  \ngvfs-set-attribute /some/location -t stringv metadata::mdtype value  \n\n/some/location is the location of the file/folder whose metadata you want to edit, -t stringv tells the command to expect string input, mdtype sets the type of metadata you want to change (e.g. emblems) and new value sets value as the metadata for mdtype. For example:  \ngvfs-set-attribute Downloads -t stringv metadata::emblems emblem-default  \n\nGives the Downloads folder the default emblem. \nSet the value to none to remove emblems. You will have to restart the file manager to see the changes. \n\nI wrote a small script that allows you to change the emblem of more than one folder/file at a time:  \nrun() {    \ncd # make sure we're in the home directory\necho 'What emblem do you want to apply?'\nread emblem\n\nif ! [ -z $emblem ]; then\n    for i in $@\n    do\n        echo 'Changing stuff...'\n        $(gvfs-set-attribute $i -t stringv metadata::emblems $emblem)\n    done\n    echo 'Done!'\nelse\n    echo 'Emblem must be specified!

My indicator-fortune here will give you a first step into writing a Python 3 (and GTK+ 3) indicator.  There's a multitude of indicators listed which will give you other examples.\nThe hard part is figuring out how to connect to taskwarrior - does it have an API or some way to send/receive information which is accessed via your indicator?  Would you instead parse it's config/data files (it that's what it uses)?\nYour first step might be (after getting the vanilla indicator running) to simply display information from taskwarrior, so the indicator is read-only.  After that you might then push your luck and see if you can send data back from the indicator.\n", "Q: Unable to add subdomains with nginx server I have nginx running on my server and I'm trying to set up a sub domain in the server.

Thanks in advance for the help.\n\nA: Let's solve:\n\n\n*\n\n*the ports under 1024 (like 554) are reserved to the Administrator (root), so any software which uses them must be executed as root (or safer with the sudo software).

Then execute:\nsudo ufw allow <port number>\n\n...for any port number you want to open (81,8000 and 554) to any type of connection from any host (the sintax may vary from version to version, always read man ufw).\nThe sintax to control the ufw interface is reported here, I suggest to read it.\nAfter that you need to open the ports on your default gateway (a router or a switch) if it features an hardware firewall (like the Netgear and Belkin routers).\nNow you have the desired remote access. :-)\nLet us know by commenting down here if it's all ok & have a nice experience.\n\nA: Update:\nThis is how solved it:\n1) Insert rules for three ports:\nufw allow 81\nufw allow 8000\nufw allow 554\n\n2) in /etc/ufw/before.rules I added the following lines in the NAT section (just before POSTROUTING):\n:PREROUTING - [0:0]\n-A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 81 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.0.101:81\n-A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 8000 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.0.101:8000\n-A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 554 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.0.101:554\n\n3) Reload the firewall:\nufw reload\n\nIn Firefox I type http//myserver.com:81 (http://myserver.com is our regular webpage) and I'm redirected to the DVR on the internal network which runs the CCTV programs I need to access from the internet (ports 8000 and 554 are used to access the system using a smartphone)\nAgain, thanks for the help.\n", "Q: Installation / Uninstallation doesn't work when executing sudo apt-get install or similar commands, I'm getting this message: \nYou might want to run 'apt-get -f install' to correct these:\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\n postgresql-client-9.1 : Breaks: postgresql-9.1 (< 9.1.11-1.pgdg12.4+1) but 9.1.10-1.pgdg12.4+1 is to be installed\n postgresql-contrib-9.1 : Depends: postgresql-9.1 (= 9.1.11-1.pgdg12.4+1) but 9.1.10-1.pgdg12.4+1 is to be installed\n synaptic : Depends: libvte9 (>= 1:0.24.0) but it is not going to be installed\n            Recommends: rarian-compat but it is not going to be installed\nE: Unmet dependencies.

You'd have to have the tcpdump program, or similar, actually running on the router.\nThere are plenty of software router implementations, some of which may do this for you already.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_router_or_firewall_distributions\nOr, you may have a router that supports DD-WRT, which is Linux.  You can install tcpdump on such installations.. here's an example.\nhttp://emtunc.org/blog/04/2011/installing-tcpdump-on-dd-wrt-wrt54gl/\n", "Q: increase linux partion size(file system) i have have a message today that say i need to increase my file system size in ubuntu \n/dev/sda12       4797600  4233236    297612  94% /\n\n\nhear is current condition of my ubuntu file system partition. can anyone tell me a how to increase sda12 partition size.\n\nA: To get 2 GB space from /dev/sda9 and add it to /dev/sda12,follow the below steps,\n\n*\n\n*You must had to boot from ubuntu live disk.So that all the partitions will be unmounted.And make sure that no one is mounted.\n\n\n*After opening gparted,Right click on the /dev/sda9 partition and select Resize/Move option.Resizing it to get 2 GB unallocated space.It was placed just below to the /dev/sda9 partition.\n\n\n*You need to move the 2 GB unallocated space just below to the /dev/sda12 partition,so that it can be combined with your ubuntu /dev/sda12 partition.\n\n\n*Right click on the sda9,select Resize/Move and move the dragger to the extreme right,so that the unallocated space will be moved just above to the /dev/sda9 partition.\n\n\n*Try the above step to move the unallocated space just above to the linux-swap partition(/dev/sda8).Now both the unallocated space will be combined into one(2 GB+5 MB)\n\n\n*Now right-click on the /dev/sda12 partition and select Resize/Move option.Now you can be able to add the unallocated space to the /dev/sda12 partition.\n", "Q: Super Key does not invoke activities in Gnome Shell 3.8 Pressing the Super  key does not launch the Activities, although the hot key to the top left corner to activate Activities do work.

As I failed to set up LAMP, on several occasions using the links and other prescribed methods in this forum. \nI get to “Look it Works” on the browser, when you restart Apache, then enter the code lines   to obtain the PHP display page, after reading a long message, which  tells me certain facets of the php install were deprecated, do you want to continue, “y or n” the terminal goes blank upon typing “y” and followed by a series of new lines starting with a comma, ending with a red line message “E353: nothing in register”.\nEntering “php -version” or “mysql -version” commands in the terminal, it informs me I do not have either installed, but gives the option to install either with the following “sudo apt-get install php5-cli” or “sudo apt-get install mysql-client-core-5.5\n” commands. Though Apache comes with multiple choice? Sort of grasp why there is nought in the register.\n\n\n*\n\n*Security issues, I was informed to enter a new password for MySQL, then re-enter, went with my computer root command password. By the third or fourth attempt I used a new password for MySQL. Boy that cooked the system. Delete and re-installed 12.04.\n\n*The system only recognises the 127.0.0.1, which it didn't like either, and I couldn't find an option to enter my IP localhost.com, shown on the example graphic or the preferred 192.168.00.000 modified address used in other examples.\n\n*Is “Head First, PHP & MySQL” still the best way forward for Ubuntu 12.04, if not can you recommend..!\n\n*Would it be prudent to download PHP, MySQL and Apache using the sudo apt-get install command first, then attempt the set up using “tasksel”, which is now installed.\nFeeling like a NUMPTY and totally lost. \n\nA: Use the commands it suggests (sudo apt-get install php5 php5-cli mysql-client mysql-server)  to install PHP and MySQL, and reboot the Apache server using sudo service apache2 restart.

It's happened to me that a USB Keyboard gave problems at boot because it wasn't being recognized by the system).\n\nA: What do you mean you cannot highlight Ubuntu.

This is unfortunate because the kernel has no knowledge about neither userspace application support nor user preferences.  The problem in your case is that MBIM was selected by the kernel, but isn't yet supported by the ModemManager version you have.\nThe long term solution would be a newer ModemManager with proper MBIM support.  But until that is available in Ubuntu, you can tell the kernel to make a different choice. The default preference can be temporarily overridden by doing\n echo N >/sys/module/cdc_ncm/parameters/prefer_mbim\n\nor more permanently changed by creating e.g. a /etc/modprobe.d/ncm.conf file with a line like this:\n options cdc_ncm prefer_mbim=N\n\nNote that this new preference will only take effect on the next driver probe, so you will have to \"unplug\" and replug the modem to make it effective.  And as your modem is built-in, that probably means using rfkill. Or just create the file and unload/reload the drivers.  Or reboot if you find that easiest.  Be aware the temporary solution given above will only work with the rfkill based method.\nThe above should only be considered a temporary workaround. There are good reasons why you would want to use MBIM for mobile broadband devices in the future, as soon as the ModemManager support is in place. The NCM interface management is based on a few vendor specific AT commands. MBIM provides a standardized and much more complete 3G/LTE modem management protocol.\n", "Q: Simple way to setup Triple Boot of Win 7, Ubuntu and Fedora I want to do triple boot with Win 7, Ubuntu and Fedora (for the full gnome 3 experience) on my 4GB Ram 500GB HD, please show me how to do so.

To fix this, I had to manually edit:\n/var/lib/AccountsService/users/<username>. \nIn the [User] section, I had to change \nSystemAccount=true to SystemAccount=false\nAfter restarting the AccountsService daemon (sudo service accounts-daemon restart) my username reappeared in the System Settings->User Accounts GUI.\nNotably, this was an account that was carried over from a previous install of 14.04, and had had its uid manually changed.\n\nA: In my case for some reasons my account disappeared from the User Accounts GUI. Checking the answers above I managed to do the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*From terminal I changed directory: cd /var/lib/AccountsService/users/\n\n*Then I opened up my account there (check it with ls) with nano: sudo nano <username>\n\n*Then I changed the SystemAccount property to the opposite value (like from false to true).\n\n*Saved it and opened up again and changed the SystemAccount value back to it's original.\n\n*Restarted User Accounts GUI --> Woala it's working again.\n\n", "Q: Syncing Ipod Shuffle Hello i've tried to sync my ipod shuffle (latest gen) for 2 hours now...\nI've tried banshee (I can put music on my device but not listening to it, \"use itunes blablabla\"), I've tried gtkpod (not launching), Floola (no ipod connected).\nHow can I proceed ?\n\nA: Answer is simple: Use Amarok.\nsudo apt-get install amarok\nIt is a music player and music manager from the KDE suite.\nOnce you install it, connect the iPod and it would appear as a local device (with ipod somewhere in its name). Before you can sync, you need to setup your local library. For this: from settings menu, go to Configure Amarok, and then in the collections tab, make sure you tick your local music folder.\n\nPerform full collection rescan by going to Tools menu, and Update Collection.\nNow coming back to the iPod section in the left hand side pane, if you right click on an artist/album/genre/song, it would allow you to copy to the local collection. Vice-a-versa, in local collection, if you right click on any artist/album/genre/song, it would allow you to copy it to your ipod.\nRefer http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/4791/how-to-use-amarok-to-manage-your-ipod/ for more detailed info on this.\nUpdate: Just read your question once again. If this was prompting you to sell your ipod Shuffle, then definitely no need to do that anymore :) .\n", "Q: Remote file transfer? (transfer files on local machine from remote machine) I have a file server that seconds as a media centre. Lets call the server Barton. It has 2 external hard drives plugged into it. It also constantly has video files playing on it which are outputting to a TV.\nNow I have a laptop (both machines are running Ubuntu 13.10) on the same LAN and I would like to organize my files on the two external hard drives connected to Barton, without having to use the actual machine Barton because it is being used to watch video files. So I've trying SSH and Samba connections with the laptop, which is fine for moving files around on the same disk, but when I want to transfer a folder from one external drive to another, this is where I have an issue.\nIf I copy a folder from one external hard drive to another from the local machine Barton I get a transfer rate of around 10-20mb/s (which is pretty much the maximum that Barton will allow given it's hardware specifications. Now if I do a similar transfer from my laptop using SSH or Samba I get a transfer speed of around 100kb/s and this is not usable for trying to organize files.\nSo I figure when  using SSH or Samba that the files have to get transferred over the network and that is why they are so slow. Is there any way to get my laptop to tell Barton to do the file transfer locally instead of trying to do it over the network? As in, some way I can run commands from the laptop and have Barton carry out the transfer at 10-20mb/s? Thank you.\n\nA: When you SSH from your laptop into Barton, and issue a command, all the disk transfer is actually taking place on Barton.  It should be no different than if you are logged into Barton.\nSMB is a different beast.  On Windows it can get pretty ugly if you're doing this with Windows Explorer.  The Microsoft people couldn't seem to keep it simple, and there's all this extra analysis on the files during the copy operation which adds a bunch of overhead (it's digging for file properties, icons and so forth)\nSSH or local login should theoretically always be faster.\n", "Q: Unity and gnome-panel fighting over global bar 12.04 Like so many others I wish there was a way to stop a window's title bar from merging with the global bar at the top of the screen.  Today I installed gnome-panel to get the handy gnome-desktop-item-edit app because I wanted to add some scripts to the Unity launcher and I'm very happy to have the old familiar Applications and Places menus back.  I noticed that when my mouse travels between the global bar and the focused window, it toggles the global bar between the title of the window and gnome-panel.  Very annoying.  I already did sudo apt-get autoremove appmenu-gtk appmenu-gtk3 appmenu-qt to get the File Edit etc. menus out of the global bar and back into the window, as suggested here.  I'd like to make gnome-panel be always there.  I've get a relatively good idea of the title of the window that I'm in, after all, and I don't need it hiding gnome-panel.  Any way to fix this?  Or is it a \"use a new desktop environment\" scenario?\n\nA: I ended up going with Gnome Classic and launching gnome-panel and unity-2d-shell as startup applications.  It might be perfect.  For me anyways... I get applications and places menus back on the top bar, windows key -> dash home, ALT+F2 run, and the unity launcher bar.

For any number of reasons, I need a python version that isn't in mainline repositories.  Where should I look?  \nIn my particular case I want 3.4 alpha/beta, but where should I look for non-standard python versions in general?\n\nA: I asked this in chat some time ago, and got a probably simple enough to compile 3.4 yourself... which is true.  \nI, however, thought it should be documented on-site that a good ppa to use for this purpose is the deadsnakes repo.  Reasoning is that if pip uses travis-ci... and travis-ci uses deadsnakes... I should get on the train or get out of the way.  \nI'm confident 3.4 will be there ahead of mainline adoption, if I need a testing environment.  So, it's not there yet, but it will be -- is probably the best answer I could have gotten.\n\nA: Python 3.4 is already packaged in the development series for Ubuntu 14.04.

The following would just be something to a more manual boot repairing, if helpful :) (the length doesn't fit in the comment)\nBIOS -> MBR -> bootstrap loader -> kernel -> os\n\nfirst of all, be sure which is 'bootable device'. usually BIOS picks up the first device. so normally the installer will also try to install MBR there, can be changed though.\nsecond, the MBR in the booting device, read bootsector & loads the bootstrap loader in the 'active partition'. from your disk partition list, the one with '*' symbol found is the 'active partition'. (/dev/sda1, /dev/sdb1). \nthird, the kernel image, this can be chainloaded from second step, specially when the bootstrap loader is GRUB.\nassume your Ubuntu is installed in /dev/sdb, from the partition table, it is a big possibility there's only '/' filesystem mounted on /dev/sdb6. then you could boot from live cd, and then try 'grub-install'. read 'man grub-install', that's how lots of users survived, as long as the concept is clear.\nhope this helps\n", "Q: Asus H87-PRO /usr/sbin/pwmconfig: There are no pwm-capable sensor modules installed On an Asus H87-PRO:\n$ sudo pwmconfig \n# pwmconfig revision 5857 (2010-08-22)\n(...) \n/usr/sbin/pwmconfig: There are no pwm-capable sensor modules installed\n\nhere's the output from $ sensors:\nacpitz-virtual-0\nAdapter: Virtual device\ntemp1:        +27.8°C  (crit = +97.0°C)\ntemp2:        +29.8°C  (crit = +97.0°C)\n\ncoretemp-isa-0000\nAdapter: ISA adapter\nPhysical id 0:  +40.0°C  (high = +86.0°C, crit = +92.0°C)\nCore 0:         +32.0°C  (high = +86.0°C, crit = +92.0°C)\nCore 1:         +33.0°C  (high = +86.0°C, crit = +92.0°C)\nCore 2:         +40.0°C  (high = +86.0°C, crit = +92.0°C)\nCore 3:         +31.0°C  (high = +86.0°C, crit = +92.0°C)\n\npkg-temp-0-virtual-0\nAdapter: Virtual device\ntemp1:        +41.0°C\n\ndo I need/should I try https://github.com/ambrosa/Asus-P8P67-Ubuntu-lm-sensors-driver ?\ndo I need some acpi_osi=...

I guess it's because of escape chars...\nCan anyone shed some light?\nThanks\n\nA: In circumstances where the replacement string or pattern string contain slashes, you can make use of the fact that GNU sed allows an alternative delimiter for the substitute command. Common choices for the delimiter are the pipe character | or the hash # - the best choice of delimiting character will often depend on the type of file being processed. In your case you can try\nsed -i \"s#_HOME_DIR_#$HOME_DIR#\"\n\nAlso note that you mistyped your variable name $HOME_DIR (it does not start with an underscore).\n$ HOME_DIR=/opt/my_home\n$ echo \"_HOME_DIR_/config/data/_DOMAIN_/users.conf\" | sed \"s#_HOME_DIR_#$HOME_DIR#\"\n/opt/my_home/config/data/_DOMAIN_/users.conf\n\nJust fyi you may want to avoid using all-caps for user variables in your script - they should be reserved for system variables.

I've not seen this behaviour before -- I certainly didn't open these files, and I'm the only one who uses this computer. Why would the File Browser list these files?\n\nA: When you open a file through gedit Linux implicitly create a temp file in the /tmp directory with ~ sign which indicate this is a temporary file actually whatever you make change in that file that dose not effect the physical file directly rather it effect the tmp file when you save the file then actually the tmp file replace the physical file. some times what happens due to some inconsistent state of your system environment tmp file with ~ sign remains there.

Have installed any extra AppArmor profiles required to secure your customizations. (or SELinux additions, respective to your particular configuration)\nHow to detect a SYN attack\nIt is very simple to detect SYN attacks. The netstat command shows us how many connections are currently in the half-open state. The half-open state is described as SYN_RECEIVED in Windows and as SYN_RECV in Unix systems.\n\n\n\n# netstat -n -p TCP tcp        0      0 10.100.0.200:21            \n237.177.154.8:25882     SYN_RECV    - tcp        0      0 10.100.0.200:21            \n236.15.133.204:2577     SYN_RECV    - tcp        0      0 10.100.0.200:21            \n127.160.6.129:51748     SYN_RECV    - tcp        0      0 10.100.0.200:21            \n230.220.13.25:47393     SYN_RECV    - tcp        0      0 10.100.0.200:21            \n\nWe can also count how many half-open connections are in the backlog queue at the \nmoment. In the example below, 769 connections (for TELNET) in the SYN RECEIVED state \nare kept in the backlog queue.\n\n\n\n # netstat -n -p TCP | grep SYN_RECV | grep :23 | wc -l 769 \n\nThe other method for detecting SYN attacks is to print TCP statistics and \nlook at the TCP parameters which count dropped connection requests. While under \nattack, the values of these parameters grow rapidly.\n\n\n\n # netstat -s -P tcp | grep tcpHalfOpenDrop         tcpHalfOpenDrop     =   473 \n\nIt is important to note that every TCP port has its own backlog queue, but only\none variable of the TCP/IP stack controls the size of backlog queues for all ports.\n\n\nA: Have a look at the following links which may help strengthen your Ubuntu install:\nhttp://www.maketecheasier.com/protect-ssh-server-with-fail2ban-ubuntu/\nhttp://www.rawcomputing.co.uk/linux/linux-firewall-part1.html\nhttp://blog.lavoie.sl/2012/09/protect-webserver-against-dos-attacks.html\n\nA: These links you might find helpful:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://securityinabox.org/en\n\n*https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BasicSecurity\n\n*http://www.ubuntugeek.com/list-of-security-tools-available-in-ubuntu.htm\nSome software might be useful:\n\n\n*\n\n*Nmap -- The Network Mapper.\n\n*Kismet -- Wireless 802.11b monitoring tool.\n\n*Chkrootkit -- Checks for signs of rootkits on the local system.\n\n*Rkhunter -- rootkit, backdoor, sniffer and exploit scanner.\n\n*GnuPG -- GNU privacy guard.\n\n*Snort -- Flexible Network Intrusion Detection System.\n\n", "Q: How do I upgrade releases from a Live USB with the command line? If I create a Live CD/USB and boot from that, is there any way that an existing system on the hard drive can be upgraded by use of the command line, and not the Ubiquity installer?\n\nA: Sure. It's fairly similar to most remote-fixes (namely fixing Grub) where you chroot into the system but mount some the runtime elements from the Live environment over the top. It's quite easy but it sounds and looks horrific if you're not used to it!\nThe following assumes that / is the live environment and that sdb1 is the disk where the actual install is (check that first with sudo fdisk -l!). Other than that, it's just a pile of commands to throw in:\nsudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt\nfor i in /sys /proc /run /dev; do sudo mount --bind \"$i\" \"/mnt$i\"; done\nsudo chroot /mnt\n\nBy this point you're root on your actual system and you can fix a whole load of things. Obviously this is the point where you need to be careful what you do but as long as you're not running around rming a load of stuff, you'll probably be fine.\nYou probably could run the graphical updater but why muddy the waters with silly Xauth issues? The following will update your install's apt databases, download the command-line updater (if it's not installed already) and run it. You're already root so sudo isn't necessary but I'm including it just in case you've dropped to another user (it doesn't hurt)\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-release-upgrader-core\nsudo do-release-upgrade\n\nWhen you're done, just reboot onto your main disk.\n", "Q: How to install Python library from a repository? I mostly understand apt-get and the Ubuntu Software Center, but one thing that I can't get at all is manually installing packages for which apt-get does not work.  The file structure and layout of Ubuntu is really odd to me.\nI am running Ubuntu 12.10 and have a Python library that I need to install.  It's not one that you can get through apt-get or pip.\nI have downloaded the zip file without any problem.  As far I can tell I have to then extract it to usr/share/doc (at least this is where my other libraries store files to install for Python through apt-get).\nI have no idea how to do this though since the GUI doesn't let me do anything that's not in my account folder. As far as I can tell, the usr is some completely disconnected file structure when it comes to a terminal (I can't simply back up a level from my user account to usr for instance).\nWhat's the right way to install this Python library?\n\nA: You should not put the file (or, actually, anything) into /usr... manually - this area is managed by Ubuntu's package manager.\nI suppose you need the library because you want to write some Python script/program, right?\nIn this case you can just put it in the same folder as your program/script and do \nfrom clientsubnetoption import ClientSubnetOption\n\nNote that the library has a dependency on dnspython which, luckily, is in Ubuntu repositories so you can install it with\nsudo apt-get install python-dnspython\n\n(as a side-note: normally Python libraries are distributed as \"python eggs\" which are published in the central \"store\" called Python Package Index: https://pypi.python.org . From there they can be installed using special tools, such as easy_install, pip or zc.buildout. You can also create isolated Python environments using virtualenv and zc.buildout so there's absolutely no need to install even complex libraries system-wide)\n\nA: Here's a suggestion, you need to start using an IDE if you're not already. Inside the link you provided is a single .py file, which you can save to ANYWHERE on your computer an then import it to an active Python project using an IDE.\nOnce it's in the project then you can call on it all you want.\nI'm in the same boat as you, pretty new to Linux and started Python programming and personally I rarely use Terminal to do anything Python related.\nAs far navigating through terminal you go back a directory by typing \"cd ..\". You can jump straight to your Home directory by type \"cd ~\". \n\nA: A way you could use the script in any of your own python scripts is by adding it to the pythonpath. This is what the python interpreter uses to decide where to look for importable python packages. To add a directory or folder to the pythonpath type the following into the terminal:\nexport PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/my/other/path\nthis will temporarily add \"my/other/path\" to the python path. \"my/other/path\" should be the path to the directory/folder that ClientSubnetOption is housed in. For example, you could put it in the directory ~/python_packages/clientsubnetoption. The ~ signifies the home directory.\nIf you would like to add this directory permanently to the pythonpath, add the above line to the bottom of your \".bashrc\" file. It should be located somewhere in your home directory but it is a hidden file so if you are using the gui to find it you will need to press CTRL-h to view it.\nThe final thing you will need to do is make the directory ClientSubnetOption is housed in into a python package. This is actually much easier than it sounds. I would suggest putting ClientSubnetOption within its own directory with python_packages so the path would look something like ~/python_packages/clientsubnetoption/. then within the clientsubnetoption directory create a file called __init__.py. The file needs two underscores preceding and following init to work. This file doesn't need to contain any code it just needs to be present within the directory to make a python package. \nNow that is done add the path to clientsubnetoption to your python path by opening the file .bashrc and adding the following line to the end of the file:\nexport PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:~/python_packages/clientsubnetoption/\nBefore any of these changes take effect, you will need to restart your shell by typing the following command into the terminal:\nsource ~/.bashrc\nnow you should be able to import clientsubnetoption by using the following import in your script:\nfrom clientsubnetoption import ClientSubnetOption\nhope that wasn't too convoluted. \n", "Q: Installed packages have unmet dependencies When i tried to install lxc-docker-0.7.6 on ubuntu 13.04, i get the following errors:\nThe  following package was automatically installed and is no longer required:\n  libsdl-ttf2.0-0\nUse 'apt-get autoremove' to remove it.\nThe following NEW packages will be installed:\n  lxc-docker-0.7.6\n0 upgraded, 1 newly installed, 0 to remove and 61 not upgraded.\n1 not fully installed or removed.\nNeed to get 2,681 kB of archives.\nAfter this operation, 14.4 MB of additional disk space will be used.\nGet:1 http://get.docker.io/ubuntu/ docker/main lxc-docker-0.7.6 amd64 0.7.6 [2,681 kB]\nFetched 2,681 kB in 3s (857 kB/s)             \n(Reading database ... 171665 files and directories currently installed.)\nUnpacking lxc-docker-0.7.6 (from .../lxc-docker-0.7.6_0.7.6_amd64.deb) ...\ndpkg: error processing /var/cache/apt/archives/lxc-docker-0.7.6_0.7.6_amd64.deb (--unpack):\n trying to overwrite '/usr/bin/docker', which is also in package docker 1.4-5ubuntu1\ndpkg-deb: error: subprocess paste was killed by signal (Broken pipe)\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n /var/cache/apt/archives/lxc-docker-0.7.6_0.7.6_amd64.deb\nE: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)\n\n\nA: Try the below commands on terminal,\nsudo dpkg -r docker\nsudo apt-get -f install\n\n", "Q: Server disk encrpytion prevents connection after SSH remote reboot newbie here.

There you can find an alternative too if you do not wish to modify your /etc/sudoers\n\nThe other bad way [not recommended] is to ask sudo to read your password from a file where  your password is already stored. But this may be severe security concerns. -S switch enables sudo to read a password from standard input. \nIf you store your password in a file mypsd.txt that contains only your password followed by a new line character.

As of this writing the stable build is v3.14.1-trusty (this would work for Ubuntu 13.10 as well).\nDownload the *.deb files based on your architecture. Refer this section on Ubuntu Wiki on what you need to download. Once downloaded, open your terminal, cd to the downloaded directory and run sudo dpkg -i *.deb to install them. Then reboot to check if it works for you.\nNote: You won't get automatic updates for this version of kernel.

Ufw has a command that lists out profiles to which you can further explore their profile definitions\n$ ufw app list\n\nAnd \n$ ufw app PROFILE {app profile title}\n\nI was wondering how you can create a profile for an undefined program, like virtual box and have that profile run the same definitions I have given iptables for my Ubuntu distro.\n\nNot only am I trying to use Ubuntus firewall to service my virtual machine. I am also sincerely curious as how to create a profile for an application that doesn't come with one.\n\nA: To answer the real question, about how to create your own application file, you only need to know that it is using windows INI file format.\n[appname]\ntitle=1-liner here\ndescription=a longer line here\nports=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,30/tcp|50/udp|53\n\nThe ports line can specify multiple ports, with /udp or /tcp, to limit the protocol, otherwise it defaults to both.  You have to split the protocol sections up with |.\nSo, for a real-life set of examples I made:\n[puppet]\ntitle=puppet configuration manager\ndescription=Puppet Open Source from http://www.puppetlabs.com/\nports=80,443,8140/tcp\n\n[AMANDA]\ntitle=AMANDA Backup\ndescription=AMANDA the Advanced Maryland Automatic Network Disk Archiver\nports=10080\n\nYou can list multiple versions of the app in a single file, like this one from apache:\n===start of apache2.2-common file===\n[Apache]\ntitle=Web Server\ndescription=Apache v2 is the next generation of the omnipresent Apache web server.\nports=80/tcp\n\n[Apache Secure]\ntitle=Web Server (HTTPS)\ndescription=Apache v2 is the next generation of the omnipresent Apache web server.\nports=443/tcp\n\n[Apache Full]\ntitle=Web Server (HTTP,HTTPS)\ndescription=Apache v2 is the next generation of the omnipresent Apache web server.\nports=80,443/tcp\n\n===end of file===\n\nOnce you have defined your application file, put it in /etc/ufw/applications.d, then tell ufw to reload the application definitions with\nufw app update appname\nufw app info appname\n\nUse it with something like:\nufw allow from 192.168.1.10 to any app amanda\nufw allow amanda\n\nassuming 192.168.1.10 is the IP of your amanda server.\n\nA: It's actually all there in the manpage under the \"Application Integration\" section.\nThe basic syntax is:\nufw allow <app_name>\n\nOr you can use the extended syntax to be more specific:\nufw allow from <some_address> to any app <app_name>\n\nThe manpage specifically says not to specify a port number:\n\nYou  should  not  specify the protocol with either syntax, and with the\nextended syntax, use app in place of the port clause.\n\nThis probably means it will let <app_name> use whatever port it wants to..\nOther useful commands:\nufw app info <app_name>\n\nWhich lists the information on <app_name>'s profile.\nufw app update <app_name>  \n\nWhich updates <app_name>'s profile. You can use all to update all application profiles.\nYou can use the:\nufw app update --add-new <app_name>  \n\ncommand to add a new profile for <app_name> and update it, following the rules you set out with ufw app default <policy>.\nApp profiles are stored in /etc/ufw/applications.d and sometimes /etc/services.\nFor more information see man ufw.\n", "Q: How to upgrade Ubuntu in multiple sessions?

So can I download some part of upgrade in first session,later in second and then apply it?\nThis can be useful when it is impossible,or difficult to download large data(generally more than 750 Mb)\n    in a single go(due to speed drops,data limits etc). \nCurrently I am using Ubuntu 12.10 and I want to upgrade to 14.04.\n\nMany users in Asia and Africa rely on connections with  limited data,\n  which are slow and discontinuous.Ability to upgrade in multiple\n  session can be of great help to all such users.\n\n\nA: I think that the most advisable in your case is simply downloading the ISO image and do an in-place upgrade instead of going thru the whole upgrade path. This way you can control how much data you use per day and upgrade at any time.\nRemember to do backups.\n", "Q: An easier way to launch JPCSP So im getting aggravated that I need to open a terminal and type \n\nseal@seal-Dimension-4700:~$ cd /home/seal/Jpcsp\nseal@seal-Dimension-4700:~/Jpcsp$ start-linux-x86.sh\n\nim wondering if there is a way to make a quick launch so i can skip all that and just launch it from a shortcut?\n\nA: Add the directory path to the PATH variable by adding the below line to .bashrc file,\nexport PATH=$PATH:/home/seal/Jpcsp\n\nTo open .bashrc file,\ngedit ~/.bashrc\n\nThen source the .bashrc file,\nsource ~/.bashrc\n\nAfter that you can run the start-linux-x86.sh file directly by simply opening the terminal.\n\nA: Create a shell script on Desktop.The steps are as follows.\n\n*\n\n*Right click anywhere on desktop(or in any file,if you wish) and select create new document>empty document.\n\n*Open the file in gedit,and type the following in it.\n\n#! /bin/sh\n  cd /home/seal/Jpcsp\n  start-linux-x86.sh\n  \n*Save the file as jpcsp.sh\n  \n*Open a terminal and type sudo chmod +x ./Desktop/jpcsp.sh\n  \n*Now every time you want to execute jpcsp,just run jpcsp.sh file on desktop.\n  \n\n", "Q: What's wrong with my partition table?

Then close the empty tabs until you are left with a single view.\nIllustration\nDrag the tab into the other windows tab-group\n\nOnce you have 3 open terminal tabs in a single view, close the extra, blank, terminal tab/window and you have achieved the desired result.\n\n", "Q: Deploying a Node.js app using Juju A little background.

There is many good methods that provide backing up your system, some of them also provide incremental backups. \nAnswering exactly what you want step by step\nAs I can see from your df -h output, you do not distribute your /boot, /usr, /var and other folder to a different partitions. So\n1.\nFirst of all you should create your Live CD or bootable USB stick with Ubuntu. Here is guide for Live CD and for USB stick.\n2.\nNow boot Ubuntu from CD or USB, you should see a menu with \"Try Ubuntu without any change to your computer\" at the top. In loaded Ubuntu open gnome-terminal (Ctrl + Alt + T), and run sudo gparted. Create new 55Gb ext4 partition using this tutorial. Remember this new partition name, it should something like /dev/sda6.\n3.\nNow you should mount your new successfully created partition (Lets say /dev/sda6) and your previous partition /dev/sda5. And copy all your files and folders hierarchy. Open gnome-terminal and do this line by line:\nsudo mkdir /media/old_partition\nsudo mkdir /media/new_partition\nsudo mount /dev/sda5 /media/old_partition\nsudo mount /dev/sda6 /media/new_partition\nsudo cp -ax /media/old_partition /media/new_partition\n\nThis last command can work very long. Do not interrupt it. It should output nothing at the end if everything is ok.\nLittle quote from this guide.\ncp -ax / /new-disk\nThis is the simplest method, but will only work if your original Linux system is on a single disk partition.\nThe -a option preserves the original system as much as possible. The -x option limits cp to a single file system; this is necessary to avoid copying the /new-disk and /proc directories.\n4.\nNow you need to update fstab in your new backup partition.\nFind UUID of /dev/sda6 (new partition):\nsudo blkid /dev/sda6\n\nFind UUID of /dev/sda5 (old partition):\nsudo blkid /dev/sda6\n\nThen edit /media/new_partition/etc/fstab:\nsudo gedit /media/new_partition/etc/fstab\n\nAnd substitute UUID of /dev/sda5 to UUID of /dev/sda6. Be carefully, substitute only UUID.\n5.\nNow adding new entry to grub menu. Open /media/old_partition/etc/grub.d/40_custom using gedit and add this at the \nend of the file:\nmenuentry \"Boot backup Ubuntu\" {\n    set root=UUID=XXXX-YYYY\n        linux /vmlinuz root=UUID=XXXX-YYYY ro quiet splash\n            initrd /initrd.img\n    }\n\nWhere XXXX-YYYY is UUID of new partition (/dev/sda6).\n6.\nUnmount everything and reboot. Before do this close everything what you have opened (gparted, gnome-terminal, gedit, others).\nsudo umount /dev/sda5\nsudo umount /dev/sda6\nsudo reboot\n\nRemove your LIVE bootable device.\nNow you should see new entry in your grub boot menu.\nNotice that this method do not backing up other than / mount points, such as /home, /var, /usr others, if they distributed between partitions. In such situation you should do steps 2-4 for each partition.\n\nA: I cannot explain here step by step, but you should be able to finish with this explanation!\nFirstly, create a partition, that is big enough.\nThen, copy your ubuntu installation to this partition, remaining the file attributes.\nCreate the entry in grub, by copying and adjusting the partition id.\nI guess now you only have to edit fstab on the new partition.\nSo easy ;)\n\nA: You even don't need a separate partition, you can move your whole system to a subfolder then add a a grub menuentry to boot into it. I just posted how to do it in different thread, check out my answer named kenn here Installing Multiple Linux Distros in a single partition\n", "Q: How do I install fglrx on an AMD Kaveri machine? I have recently built a Kaveri machine, but I'm having trouble getting the fglrx drivers up and running. I can install them, but the LightDM screen will simply be black.\nThe machine has an AMD A10-7850K APU and an Asus A88XM-PLUS motherboard. I have done tests using both Ubuntu 13.10 and 14.04. In the end I don't mind using either.\nI have tried the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the regular fglrx-updates -> No result\n\n*Install the xorg-edgers ppa -> No result\n\n*Manually install the official AMD beta version via this cchtml guide -> No result\n\n*Remove all kernels and install the 3.12 kernel from the mainline ppa, and install the official AMD beta version against that kernel -> No result\n\n\nIt must be possible, because Phoronix has tested fglrx against the exact same APU on a slightly different motherboard of the same series, except they didn't provide any instructions on the installation bit.\nAny help is welcome, as the internet is currently a barren desert when it comes to AMD's new APU on Linux.\n\nA: Problem solved. AMD released their Catalyst 14.1 driver with A10-7850K support for Linux. Note that THIS IS A BETA DRIVER, AND IS THEREFORE EXPERIMENTAL. The performance I've got out of it is okay, though. Trine 2, Dota 2, Minecraft (OpenJDK 7), Europa Universalis IV and Guns of Icarus Online all ran reasonably well on 1920x1080 with medium/high settings.\nInstructions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the driver from AMD.\n\n*Unzip the file.\n\n*Make the new file executable. sudo chmod u+x amd-driver*.run should do the trick.\n\n*Install the prerequisites: sudo apt-get install cdbs dh-make dkms execstack dh-modaliases linux-headers-generic libqtgui4 lib32gcc1\n\n*Create .deb files from the installer: sudo ./amd-driver*.run --buildpkg Ubuntu/saucy  Replace Ubuntu/saucy with your version if applicable. AMD says it's compatible with Ubuntu 12.04 as well, so you'd put --buildpkg Ubuntu/precise at the end.\n\n*Do the actual installation bit: sudo dpkg -i fglrx*.deb  This installs multiple .debs.\n\n*Optional-ish, initialise the xorg.conf file after restarting your computer: sudo amdconfig --initial -f\nAnd that's that.\n", "Q: how to unity avoid in preseed file ubutu12.04 I wrote a preseed file for the Ubuntu 12.04 installation.\n\n\n*\n\n*But I want to avoid the unity-desktop.

When I boot the VM, I get a grub rescue line. I suppose from this https://www.vmware.com/support/ws5/doc/disks_dualmult_ws.html#wp1046601 and http://fds-team.de/cms/articles/2013-12/use-a-real-windows-7-partition-in-virtualbox-kvm-vmware-player-u.html that I somehow need to create an mbr but I've failed at this or rather at using it so far. Maybe someone with a grasp of what I'm doing could digest the tutorial for me and help get this thing running on my partition configuration? I want to not have to reboot to use AutoCAD 2014 and am hoping for decent usability in a VM, albeit I don't know what settings (SCSI? 6 GB Ram for the VM?) would be a good choice nor whether this is even worth the effort and I won't be too unhappy with the VM-Performance to ever use it.\nAny comment, suggestion or advice appreciated.\nThanks, Philipp\n\nA: I would advise against this because when you run Windows 7 in the vm it will detect it as a hardware change and may require you to reactivate your license, if the os came with your computer then it's an oem install which means it likely won't allow activation on the vm, additionally if you activate it for the vm successfully then it will detect the host system as a hardware change and may wish to be reactivated again, causing you to enter an endless cycle. Additionally the VM will need Vmware Tools installed, which could cause problems when booting to the host since it will need the drivers you had before installing tools. \nAs far as your boot problems go, I'm not familiar with the details of the guide you're working on but a simplistic way would be to create a virtual hard drive as the primary drive, and the real-access drive as the secondary. Then using an installation disc, or using the freely available winpe (not recommened) you create a new mbr boot entry for the os on the virtual drives mbr. Before doing anything you should make a backup of your windows installation so you can restore it if things go wrong and ideally have a re-installation disc.\nIn regards to settings and performance. I've never used cad but it sounds high performance (is it similar to 3D Max?) so you will need to dedicate anything you can to the vm. VMs aren't intended for running high performance applications. However many cores you have on the host dedicate to the vm, this may slightly reduce speed but it will make things run smoother and reduce the chance of freezing. Ram wise you have the right idea, 6gb. I usually run my windows 7 vms on 1gb if I'm just using them to run something light like a web browser (and it's shaky) but when I need to run something more serious I use 4gb or more.\nLong story short, you would be better off creating a normal vm and installing windows on it. If you don't have another license/install disc then you can always consider running it in Windows XP. Some versions of Windows 7 qualify for a free download called XP Mode which is actually a Windows XP Professional SP3 install in a Virtual PC VM. According to the AutoCad website Windows XP SP3 is still supported in the 2014 edition of AutoCad, though it won't be in the next version. Since you are using a Mint host there is a slight problem. Virtual PC is only available for Windows hosts, however there are many guides out there for running XP Mode in Vmware or Virtualbox without voiding the vm such as this one: http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&cmd=displayKC&externalId=2014936\nThe other option would be to if you have access to a windows 7 or 8 installation disc you can install it as a 30day trial, install the program you want, reset the slmgr so the trial starts when the vm boots up next time, create a backup of the vm in a .zip, and then every 30 days just delete the vm and restore it from the backup you made. If you need you can get Windows 7 - Ultimate X86-64 from here: http://msft.digitalrivercontent.net/win/X17-59465.iso \nYou may also want to consider running AutoCad in Wine? \n", "Q: Shell: echo Multi character string Lets say I have strings like this:\n/somefolder/andsubfolder/my_first_text.txt\n/somefolder/andsubfolder/my_second_text.txt\n\nand I want to create a loop to echo\nmy_first_text\nmy_second_text\n\nAfter some research I found out that the cut command is not abled to do so. I think awk might be an option but I did not fully understand how to get it working properly on this example... so any help would be very appreciated. \n\nA: I think that the simplest way is to use string operators. For example, if:\nstr=\"/somefolder/andsubfolder/my_first_text.txt\"\n\nthen you can use somethink like:\nstr=${str##*/}\necho ${str%.txt}\n\nBut, you can still use cut with the help of rev (see man cut and man rev for more info):\necho $str | rev | cut -d/ -f1 | cut -d. -f 2- | rev\n\nAnd the solution using awk is:\necho $str | awk -F/ '{print $NF}' | awk -F.

If I go for the LTS, will I be capable of installing and testing new apps and programs released in the future?\n\nA: There are two contrary arguments for this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use what's most actively used. You can work that out with something like the Steam Hardware Survey (or wherever you can find that sort of breakdown). In this case it suggests the latest version is most popular but remember the biases. Steam survey statistics are gamers.\n\n*Use what's been around the longest. 12.04 was the latest release when it was first released and there has now been over a year of people bumping into problems, asking questions and having things fixed.\nWhile you might find more people are currently using 13.10 (and might be more inclined to help you), you'll probably be more likely to be able to help yourself with an older release because the support already exists.\nYou're speaking as if a 13.10 user won't answer a question about 12.04 but you have to remember that even if the issue is very specific to 12.04, many 13.10 users used to be 12.04 users. Many (myself included) have installs of both. For the vast majority of problems, version means very little so I'd just go with whatever works best for you.

Hope this helps a bit.\n\nA: The SSH client is not very helpful when something is wrong.\nI suggest you SSH into the server (I assume you have some other way to get shell access) and look into /var/log/auth.log.\nIf there is no useful info here, try increasing LogLevel in sshd_config to VERBOSE or DEBUG and then reload the SSH server using sudo service ssh reload.\n", "Q: How to get Ubuntu installed and running for development (I.e. ruby on rails) Ok, I am mostly a windows user but for for learning RoR at work, I had to get used to a mac . Once I did I found that I enjoyed it, especially the terminal, I could load up projects in moments what would take a fair bit longer on windows. \nNow Obviously Mac isn't Linux but they both work similarly at least in regards to things like terminal (correct me if I'm wrong).\nSo I could have that same flexibility at home I installed Ubuntu on a separate SSD, but things started to go wrong. I installed gnome 3.1 and my cursor vanished, but I fixed it. However I was still stuck with unity (Hate this desktop) and doing 'gnome-shell --replace' didn't do anything and my mouse cursor on the login screen was invisible so I couldn't change it by clicking on it. \nI installed ZSH as my terminal shell (like I had on mac) and Oh-myz-zsh  but nothing I did in the zshrc file did anything, none of the theme stuff changed, none of the plugins I selected worked. \nNone of the terminal commands worked i.e. rails = no command found, git = no command found, subl (sublime text editor) = no command found.\nAnd then, when I tried closing down, everything went wonky and now it loads up all funny, ( e.g. the text menu on the terminal window vanishes and re-appears constantly).\nNow, I need to get this working for work related purposes so can some one explain to me, how to:\n1) get Zsh and oh-my-zsh working properly (I honestly prefer zsh to bash)\n2) install ruby, rails, git, sublime and get all the nice terminal commands working\n3) get gnome working \n4) anything else you might recommend\nTo any that help me, Thank you very much, this has been driving me nuts like nothing else.\n\nA: 1) You'll have to provide more info as to what exactly is the problem. Are you even running zsh ? ie what is the output of ps -p $$ ? How did you install it ?\n2) To manage my ruby versions and my gems I use rvm. See for instance here how to set it up and use it. Once it's installed getting rails is as easy as gem install rails. Git is in the repositories, you say you know how to use apt-get so you should know that you just need to sudo apt-get install git. Sublime text is not in the repos, you can download and install it from here.\n3) How did you install Gnome shell ? This tutorial will show you how to install Gnome 3.10.\n", "Q: After ubuntu upgrade the cursor of the mouse is no more displayed I have just upgraded ubuntu and restarted. The problem is that when ubuntu started the cursor was no more displayed.

It did not work.\nThe HDMI does not appear in the sound settings section, however my wireless headset/mic does show up and works perfectly when selected.  \nNeed help.\n\nA: Well, my advice to you would be to try to isolate the problem and then try to find the cause. \nHave you tested the sound through the HDMI cable from an device? Maybe another computer or a dvd player? Or plug the ubuntu + HDMI into something other than the target TV? Just to be sure that the cable and the TV work.\nThen when you are sure the problem is in the ubuntu system, then you focus should be on  a couple possibilities in the hardware itself, the firmware, and then the configuration.\nFor hardware errors, Look in the log files, syslog or Xorg.0.log. After a boot of the system, any hardware problems might be evident if present.\nFor the firmware and configuration, look up the actual hardware you have and find out what the kernel driver is. Then google the hardware for people who have workarounds for your setup.

The blue Xubuntu loading picture appears first, but then it freezes and login screen pops up only on laptop (with different background picture, which changes if I plug/unplug the VGA cable), after login, it works fine.

The owner of the file (or root) can change permissions with the chmod command, or of course with Nautilus' graphical interface.\nIn Ubuntu, by default, the first user you create belongs to the \"sudo\" group, which has the possibility of becoming root by only entering their password.

With Both hard drives plugged in I cannot boot windows. The motherboard is an MSI 990XA-GD55.\nI had installed Ubuntu first. Unplugged the Ubuntu drive to install windows to avoid overwriting the MBR (assuming windows still does that these days).\nEdit:\nI think that windows only boots when the EFI boot option is selected in the BIOS, whereas usually the hard drive is specified. Have I somehow managed to install one as EFI and one as MBR? If so what does that actually mean, is this why grub cannot see the Windows installation?

When I check in system settings the UK Keyboard is correctly selected.\nThe only way to get this error to correct itself is to Log Out and back in again. \nI don't touch the keyboard settings and when it starts up again the keyboard layout is correct.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: I am having the same issue with Ubuntu 13.10. However I am able to resolve the situation without having to log out and back in again. If you have the \"Show current input source in the menu bar\" checkbox selected in System Settings -> Keyboard -> Layout Settings (a.k.a \"Text Entry\" settings), then even though \"English (UK)\" will be selected in the drop down menu when you click the icon in the menu bar, if you deselect it (by clicking on the \"English (UK)\" entry in the drop down list) then it will give you back your UK layout, which is a little odd. You can then reselect it if you wish and it will still be the UK layout.\nI know this isn't exactly a fix, but its a little less drastic than logging out and back in again. \n\nA: Try this--at the top of your desktop is a bar that contains buttons for various services such as Bluetooth,wifi, and system power etc. There must be a button that says En2 or En1 depending on the layout you've selected. Adjust your keyboard layout using this button. A keyboard layout chart is available in the same drop-down menu which can be used as a reference.\n", "Q: How to stop dist-upgrade from removing MariaDB?

I am using Teamviewer to access it remotely, but I obviously lose access when it crashes.\nIs it possible to switch the default behaviour from shutting down to restarting? Then I could put Teamviewer in my startup programs and solve my post-crash access issues.\n\nA: If you mean to reboot when there is a kernel panic, you can edit /etc/default/grub and add the panic=10 parameter which will reboot after 10 seconds of a panic. Add it to the line containing GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=, e.g that line should read:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash panic=10\"\n\nYou can change that number to the seconds you want to initiate the reboot after the panic. To reboot immediately after a panic add a negative value, e.g. panic=-1. After editing that file run sudo update-grub.\nAlternatively you can edit /etc/sysctl.conf and add the\nkernel.panic = 10\n\nline there. It has the same meaning.\nAlso if you want to reboot on oops-es too, you may add the oops=panic kernel parameter in the /etc/default/grub file, so the line will read something like:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash panic=10 oops=panic\"\n\nThis will trigger a panic on oops-es too and reboot after 10 seconds.

I recently tried to install the \"Cedar Trail in DKMS Format\" through Additional Drivers in system settings and got that error in installation that somehow screwed my system up so it can't boot. After numerous hours on google and trying out the suggested fixes, I finally just settled on reinstalling Ubuntu. However now I have these problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*After re-installing Ubuntu, the log-in screen after waking from suspend is filled with multi-colored vertical lines with a square white box where the mouse pointer should have been. I've encountered this error during my original installation but was able to fix it, although already forgetting how since its been almost a year. I've tried adding nomodeset, acpi_backlight=vendor, removed quiet splash -- everything, but the outcome is the same. I have no choice but to Ctrl +Alt+ F1 and either restart lightdm or to just sudo poweroff or reboot.\n\n*Attempting to try to fix above problem, I've resorted to again installing the graphics driver. I downloaded cedarview-graphics-drivers on synaptic (that goes with cedarview-drm) and the cedarview vaapi driver and now my netbook won't boot. It gets stuck in the boot screen with the Ubuntu logo with the five dots under it and the message that /tmp is not ready, and even if I press S or M to skip or manually restore, nothing happens. Also, cannot continue with the failsafe graphics on recovery, and already ran file system check and broken dependencies. Removing cedartrail does not do anything either. Could there be a way to fix it without having to reinstall Ubuntu again?\nI just want my netbook to go back as it was during the original installation, with the log-in screen fixed. Although now I can't boot unless in recovery mode.\nMy netbook is an Acer Aspire D270 (Intel Atom N2600, so it's Intel GMA 3600), running on Ubuntu 12.04.04 32-bit.\n\nA: Couldn't wait so I tried out stuff and finally solved my problem. I eventually just reinstalled ubuntu and this time, I'm not activating cedarview.\n\n\n*\n\n*Okay, so add this on the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT line\nnomodeset acpi_backlight=vendor\n\n\n*And this, after GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX\nacpi_osi=Linux\n\n\n*Update grub. \nAfter this, I only get a black screen (with the backlight on) after waking from suspend. Note that only the screen is black, but the system has woken up and is working so it is possible to just blindly log in, open terminal and command to reboot or poweroff. \n\n*So my next fix was to check if this works and if my system resumes after that. Ran terminal and typed sudo pm-suspend --quirk-vbemode-restore. It did not, and so I tried this out: \nsudo pm-suspend -quirk-vbemode-restore\n\nand my system came back just as I had left it. To use this option, run (i know I have gma3600 but it works anyway): \n gksudo gedit /etc/pm/config.d/gma500\n\n\n*then add this code:     \nADD_PARAMETERS='-quirk-vbemode-restore'\n\nSuspend now works normally for me.\n", "Q: Dual hardrive Ubuntu installation I have a computer with two hardrives.

So it might be just useless in Ubuntu SDK.\n\nA: You can manage resource files with the Qt resource system, but it's only meant to be use for applications mixing QML AND C++, not for projects started as simple Touch UI:\n\nThe Qt resource system allows resource files to be stored as\n  binary files in an application executable. This can be useful when\n  building a mixed QML/C++ application as it enables QML files (as well\n  as other resources such as images and sound files) to be referred to\n  through the resource system URI scheme rather than relative or\n  absolute paths to filesystem resources.\n\nFor projects only made of QML files, the way to use images resource is by using relative paths in your QML application, e.g:\nImage {\n    anchors.fill: parent\n    source: \"../../svg/test.svg\"\n}\n\nAll images files will be included automatically by the <My_project>.qmlproject file.\n", "Q: Installing rails 12.04 error I have followed all stapes from this page https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-install-ruby-on-rails-on-ubuntu-12-04-lts-precise-pangolin-with-rvm\nIt all goes well until command to install rails\ngem install rails\n\nI get this error:\nERROR:  While executing gem ...

This works flawlessly, and results from gmusicbrowser are now visible in the music-dash, like I want them to show up.\nBut I have still one small problem: How can i implement the available filters in the scopes? I think the relevant lines in the code are (line 372 ff):\ndef do_get_filters(self):\n    '''\n    Adds filters\n    '''\n    fs = Unity.FilterSet.new()\n    #if FILTERS:\n    #\n    return fs\n\nUnfortunately however there's everything commented out, and there is no serious documentation or something similar\nFilters in the scope would let me to filter Music, so for example to select only Rock music etc.; I think the screenshot explains what I mean (it's german).\n\nAs you can see, there are no results even though I have a lot of music from the 00s in my collection...\nEDIT: I have found a scope with a similar loader (unity-gdrive-scope) : https://gist.github.com/wa4557/e3a9cdef5806dc3c13c9, where the filters are added. Frankly I don't understand how this works.

Now I defined a new search string\nMY_SEARCH_SQL = '''SELECT title, filename, artist, album, albumartist, art_automatic, year, genre, art_manual, track, length\n               FROM songs\n               WHERE (year  >= %s AND year <= %s AND (album LIKE '%%%s%%' OR artist LIKE '%%%s%%' OR title LIKE '%%%s%%') )\n               ORDER BY disc, track'''\n\nwhich I call with\n    tracks = get_music_from_clementine(MY_SEARCH_SQL % (str(start_year), str(end_year), search, search, search))\n\nWith this search string I only get the results I'm interested in directly from the database query and the scope is definitely more snappy, dunno if something similar can be done for the genre case since in that case the number of filters is variable (you can select more than one genre at the time and not just a range like for the \"decade\" filter)\n", "Q: Changing brightness at startup My Lenovo T440s starts up with maximum brightness.

The display was always at max brightness on boot, but my bigger concern was that the brightness function keys were (usually) not working.  Xbacklight would (usually) work, but not always.  If I'd change the brightness to 80 using xbacklight, that would work.  If I'd change it to 70, nothing would happen until I pressed the reduce-brightness function key.  Then it would drop to (about?) 70%.  It was really weird. \nFor unrelated reasons, I switched to Mint 16 Cinnamon before I found a solution.  The function keys are working fine now, so I haven't looked into it further.  (I'm NOT suggesting switching distros as a solution, BTW!)  Before I switched, here's what I learned:\nI read (somewhere??) that the 3.8 + kernels address a hardware trend related to Windows 8:  Win8 requires hardware to report back 101 brightness levels; the t430 only supports 16. I'm guessing that the kernel is \"asking\" hardware that \"thinks\" in 1/16ths for a brightness change of 1/101th!  (Please don't quote me on this.)\nInstead of using acpi_backlight=vendor in /etc/default/grub, you could try acpi_backlight=\"!Windows 2012\" -- i.e., tell it \"I'm not using Windows 8!\"  Some of the OpenSuse folks were having success with this, though none of them were using Thinkpads.  Give it a shot.\n", "Q: ubuntu desktop installation I've been searching on the internet for quite some time to find a solution. I've been trying to install Ubuntu Desktop on a new computer build. I would like to install ubuntu desktop on a ssd and setup my 4 hdds in a raid 10 array. I mainly want to use it as a media server, but want the desktop version to possibly run windows programs also. Is there any info you could suggest on out to install ubuntu with the os on the ssd and to keep all my files in a raid 10 array? Also my Asus Motherboard supports fakeraid would it be suggested to use that or ubuntu software raid? Thanks.  \n\nA: First off, let me point out that Ubuntu Server supports adding RAID partitions already during installation. But since you want to install Ubuntu Desktop, let's focus on that.\nSo if I got you correctly, you want the system itself to be installed on the SSD drive (not RAID), but your media files etc. on a RAID partition. So then, I would setup two partitions:\n\n\n*\n\n*one normal partition on your SSD, say /dev/sda1, which is mounted on / (that is where your system resides);\n\n*and one software RAID partition (distributed on your four HDDs), say /dev/md0, which is mounted on /home (that is where your user's files reside).\n\n\nSince Ubuntu Desktop does not support setting up RAID partitions during the installation process, I would proceed as follows.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install a perfectly normal Ubuntu Desktop with a single partition on your SSD (plus, maybe, a swap partition that you could also install on your SSD - see this AskUbuntu thread for a discussion on swap partitions on SSDs; in a nutshell, it is fine).\n\n*Once your entire Ubuntu system is set up on your SSD drive, you still have four big empty HDDs there. From your new Ubuntu system you can now comfortably set up a software RAID using these four HDDs. For this, we will need two pieces of software: parted to partition your HDDs, and mdadm to set up your softwate RAID.\nsudo apt-get install parted mdadm\n\nNext we use parted to partition the four HDDs. Each HDD will contain a single partition. Let's say your four HDDs are known to the system as /dev/sdb, /dev/sdc, /dev/sdd, and /dev/sde. Issue the following commands to set up a single big RAID-ready partition on /dev/sdb. This will erase any data on /dev/sdb:\nsudo parted /dev/sdb mklabel gpt\nsudo parted -a optimal -- /dev/sdb mkpart 2048s -8192s \nsudo parted /dev/sdb set 1 raid on \n\nRepeat the procedure for /dev/sdc, /dev/sdd, and /dev/sde. We intentionally leave 8192 sectors free at the end to avoid headaches if ever you come into the situation where you have to exchange one of the HDDs, to compensate for small size differences that exist between drives. We intentionally leave 2048 sectors free at the beginning to guarantee an optimal alignment.\nNow that we have four big equally-sized partitions, we're all ready to create a software RAID. We will use the mdadm utility for that. There are excellent (and detailed) tutorials in the Internet on how to do this, so it wouldn't make sense for me to write that up here. Instead, I recommend this ArchWiki article which explains how to do it. It is aimed at Arch Linux, but it will work on Ubuntu just fine, and you'll learn a lot of things along the way. (There is also this ubuntuusers article which is good and aimed specifically at Ubuntu, but it is in german - however you could use Google Translate if you like, and, anyway, the commands are universal; sorry, the corresponding article on the english page is, surprisingly, outdated). Mainly, you need to (a) assemble the RAID array using mdadm, and (b) format the RAID filesystem with your favorite filesystem type, using a tool such as mkfs.ext4.\n\n*Finally, you want to mount your /dev/md0 device on /home, and make that persistent. That way, in the future, all your home directories will be on the RAID, while your system resides on your SSD!\na. First, make sure that you can mount your RAID:\nsudo mkdir -p /mnt\nsudo mount /dev/md0 /mnt\n\nIf that works fine, unmount it again:\nsudo umount /mnt\n\n...now we are only left with making this our future /home. Since we will fiddle around with /home here, I recommend not being logged in as a user in X.\nb. Log out from your X Session (such that you're back at the graphical login screen).\nc. Type Ctrl+Alt+F1\nc. Log in as your normal user on this non-graphical login screen.\nd. Issue the following set of commands:\nsudo mv /home /home.bak\nsudo mkdir /home\nsudo mount /dev/md0 /home\nsudo rsync -av /home.bak/ /home\n\nMake sure you don't miss the slash at the end of /home.bak/. Do type /home.bak/ and NOT /home.bak. The subtleties of rsync... You can delete /home.bak some day in the future, but there's no hurry. Let's first make sure everything works fine.\ne. Type Ctrl+Alt+F7 to get back to the graphical login, and, well, login to make sure it's all working :)\nf. If everything is fine, the last thing to do is to make the changes persistent, so that your /home will always be your RAID in the future. Open /etc/fstab with your favorite text editor as root. For instance, type\nsudo nano /etc/fstab\n\nAdd the following line (assuming you used ext4 as a filesystem, otherwise change accordingly):\n/dev/md0     /home      ext4      defaults 0 2\n\nThat's it! Have fun with your media server :)\n", "Q: Can I optimize Ubuntu for touch integration? I recently installed a usb touch screen to my Toshiba Satellite. Can I optimize Ubuntu 13.10 for touch integration?\nI have heard of the new Ubuntu Touch, seemingly only for phones, but I was curious as to whether this same idea is possible on a desktop or laptop. All my computers run Ubuntu (I have around twenty six, feww) so this would be a great help to set towards setting them each to their individual needs. I cannot program coding but I can run the terminal quite well if that helps any.\n\nA: The current version of ubuntu was not designed with touch in mind. For the future, the idea is to have a shell which scales to all the different devices (unity 8). This one is still a work in progress and it is at the moment used only on smartphones and tablet (soon in theory).

And then type ./ and press TAB and keep it pressing/pressed until the interactive menu completion kicks in and then just select passwd with the cursor keys. \nOr if you have mc (Midnight Commander) installed you can use that to select /usr/bin/passwd and then press ENTER on it to launch it or ALT+ENTER to copy the selected filename to the command line. (In this case you will likely need the latter as you will have to supply the username also to the command line because you are not changing the root's password but some user's. So simply launching passwd is not want you want.) \nOr any similar interactive selection program should work, but obviously these should be already installed on your system as now you don't have access to the admin password so you can't install anything.\n\nOr if you have only passwd in /usr/bin/ which has only one letter before asswd (on a default setup this is true) then of course you can just use bash's globbing features and simply type:\n/usr/bin/?asswd\n\nto launch passwd.\n", "Q: Time and Date not showing and the options are faded I like being able to see the date and time in the upper-right hand portion of my screen.

But on the Linux OS, it's saying that I haven't got a lot of space left, I haven't downloaded anything except for maybe 5 or 6 small files and it's saying that I have 500 megabytes left. I'm pretty sure I'm using a whole new hard drive that has 500 gigs of memory.\nI probably made a mistake during the setup and put only 700 or so megabytes in Ubuntu, if I did please tell me how I can put more memory in!\nPicture of Gparted: http://imgur.com/3R67UKy\n(I meant Megabytes, sorry!)\n\nA: Boot from a live media, then use the Gparted on it to expand the partition with low space\n\nA: first, Ubuntu needs 5 GB to install in the first place, but\nto check if your system is really only above the required space, go to the file browser, (\"Files\") right click \"computer\" in the left coloum(second to bottom icon, and did I spell that right?) and click properties. under the key for the pie chart. It'll tell you what you have in total.

These are where the patching comes in.\nGetting the tablet working in general is easy; getting the buttons working including hotplugging is fiddly and I never succeeded at it. The script for the Wacom Manga submitted by a user at the end of the thread got the buttons on my P&T working once I added made that script executable and added it to my Startup Applications. The difference between \"working\" and \"working including hotplugging\" is that if I unplug and tablet and plug it back in, the buttons don't work until I run the script again.\nIt seems that 14.04 will support the new Intuoses out of the box, by the way.\n", "Q: cat and Pipe to Run Command Won't Take Two Arguments I have been using this command:\ncat urls.txt | xargs -n 1 -P 10 wget -q\n\nto download text files of URLs.

Those can be found in /etc/passwd and /etc/group.\nIf you added one of those lines to your /etc/fstab file, you can now mount the share:\nsudo mount -a\n\nYou should now see those shares mounted under the ownership of the local user and group you indicated in USERID and USERGROUP.\n", "Q: Why do I need administrative privileges to use chsh? I was working on a Ubuntu system where I did not have administrative privileges, and I couldn't change shells (from tcsh to bash) using chsh. I solved the problem writing in the .tcshrc to open bash.\nI can't understand why I need admin privileges to use chsh in my own home directory.\nIn case I need privileges because chsh changes something in the /etc folder, how is this any different to changing my password? I can change my password even though I'm not an admin, and this also makes changes within /etc.\nWhat's the difference between changing my password and changing my shell?\n\nA: Both chsh and passwd allow the user to change their default shell and password. In both cases the user will be required to provide their current password to authorize the change. The user does not need sudo (administrative) privileges. \nThe command would be:\nchsh -s /bin/tcsh\n\nchsh tcsh would not work as it needs the full path. However, you also need to log out and log back in as the X-session will continue to present you with the shell that it read from /etc/passwd when it first loaded. A quick way to confirm that indeed your shell has changed would be to switch to one of the virtual terminals and logging in there (such as Ctrl+Alt+F1).\n", "Q: How to install ubuntu 13.04 on to a usb I'm trying to install ubuntu 13.04 to a 32gb usb stick so I can bring It to and from school.

That means ca. 12 GiB writes per power on hours on your SSD. That is kinda lot for a typical consumer SSD usage. What do you use the SSD for?\nYou are still way below the write cycle limit of your SSD, which is an MLC based one, so should tolerate ca. 3000 write cycles, which would mean ca. 256GB*3000=768 TB writes. So I would say you are safe.\nBut your SMART data shows that now you have already 238 reallocated (failed) sectors. That number is still very low compared to the few hundred million sectors on your drive, but for me it is surprising that after only 60-70 write cycles your SSD has failing blocks. Do you have some spare space on your SSD? The SSDs needs some spare space to be able to efficiently manage the wear on the drive. If the drive is almost full it wears faster because of the increased writes of the wear leveling algorithm.\nHere is a graph showing a 840 PRO 256 GB SSD under write test. It has still zero, or very close to zero reallocated sectors after 300 TB writes. You have more than 200 after less than 20 TB.\nYou are using the latest firmware of the drive. I don't want to worry you but I think you should contact Samsung with that SMART output, and ask about their opinion. I think your drive has some kind of problem.   \n\nUPDATE:\nAfter Samsung's response - who basically said everything is fine -  I would say that as long as you don't encounter data loss, (that is as long as the badblocks discovered during a write operation) I think you shouldn't worry then. \nYou can see the badblock count in the Runtime_bad_block line (238, the Raw value) that is the sum of the Program_Fail_Cnt_Total (238, which is the failed write operations) the Erase_Fail_Count_Total (0, which is the failed erase operations) and the failed read operations. So the failed read operations on your drive at the time the smart output was generated is 238-238-0=0, so you didn't have any failed read, you don't have any data loss.\nIf your drive starts to encounter failed reads too in the near future (that means the Runtime_bad_block will not equal Program_Fail_Cnt_Total + Erase_Fail_Count_Total), potential data loss, I would recontact Samsung. Until that time just enjoy your SSD.\n\nA: It eventuated that that Samsung 840 Pro SSD had a catastrophic failure later in 2014. It was replaced under warranty with the Samsung 850 Pro, which has now been running successfully since then, and still does not report any bad sectors. I'm pleased about that, because I thought maybe it was an \"undocumented feature\" of SSDs.\n", "Q: Wifi not connecting (ASUS N76VZ + Intel centrino 2230 + Ubuntu 13.04) i have recently installed ubuntu 13.04 alongside windows 8.1. The wifi is detecting the other wifi devices but when i try to connect, it goes on and on and then it doesn' connect. I have tried the additional drivers but nothing appears in that list. Can you help me please.\n\nA: I've had a similar issue with an Acer Aspire (4339-2618) on multiple versions of Ubuntu. While I haven't fully diagnosed the problem, I have found a very stable work-around that you might try. The problem turned out to only occur when I used the native network-manager. That is what you use to find your local wifi networks in your window manager, it is installed by default on Ubuntu.\nAfter attempting multiple variation on driver/kernel fixes, I turned off network-manager and used wpa_supplicant which should be installed by default, or otherwise can be installed with the command:\nsudo apt-get install wpasupplicant\n\nThis assumes that the wifi network you are trying to connect with is using wpa (most are). If you know your wifi network and password, you should run the following command:\nwpa_passphrase mynetwork mypassword\n\nThat will output something like this:\nnetwork={\n    ssid=\"mynetwork\"\n    #psk=\"mypassword\"\n    psk=69e49214ef4e7e23d0ece077c2faf3c73f7522ad52a26b33527fa78d9033ff35\n}\n\nYou should delete the #psk line, as that presents your password in plaintext in a config file and is not a very secure practice (the psk hash itself isn't so great to have in a config file, but that's another topic).\nCopy that output and paste it at the bottom of the file /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf.\nYou will only have to do this once. If you want to add additional networks, you can re-run the wpa_passphrase commands with those network names and passwords and paste those into the wpa_supplicant.conf file.\nThe final steps are to disable network-manager and run wpa_supplicant. I put this all in a bash script called run_wifi.sh and run the script as sudo from the command line:\n#!/bin/bash\nservice network-manager stop  # stop network manager\nkillall wpa_supplicant        # exit any running wpa_supplicants\nwpa_supplicant -B -iwlan0 -c/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf\ndhclient wlan0                # get ip address from router\n\nHere it is assumed that your wireless network shows up as wlan0 when you type ifconfig, you may have to change that to wlan1 or whatever the case may be.\nMake this script executable (chmod +x ./run_wifi.sh) and run it with the line:\nsudo ./run_wifi.sh\n\nAfter the next reboot, you can simply use the previous line to connect to your network. If you want to connect to the ethernet port using network manager again, you can turn it back on service network-manager start or simply run sudo dhclient eth0.\nIf this doesn't work for you, please let me know and I will delete this answer.\n", "Q: VIM does not refresh properly I have a VM box with LAMP installed\nI use the shell (with ubuntu 12) to connect to the VM box and real server (dell poweredge), every time I press page up or page down, the screen does not get refreshed on both VMs and Physical servers.\nBoth VM and real server have this config:\n\n\n*\n\n*2 gigs ram\n\n*1,8G processor\n\n*250g hdd\n\n*2 x gigabit LAN port #1 used, port #2 not used\n\n*Both are plugged to a 1u switch\n\n*all servers has Ubuntu server 12.04\n\n\nClient's computer:\n3.2 G I5, 16g ram, SSD, Nvidia gtx550ti with Ubuntu 12.04\nI tried this solution: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7078538/refresh-vim-buffer\n works but it's a pain to do every time i press up arrow, page up etc...\nI have this in my .vimrc:\nset nowrap\nset showmatch\nset tabstop=4\nset shiftwidth=4\n\"set expandtab\nset ruler\nset foldcolumn=2\nset nowrap\nnmap <F8> :set wrap! wrap?<CR>\n\"nmap <F6> :e /tmp/a<CR>\n\"nmap <F7> :w! /tmp/a\\| wq!<CR>\n\n\" change // style comment to phpDoc comment\nmap <C-P> :!php -l %<CR>\n\nset hlsearch\n\"set incsearch\nset background=dark\n\"set textwidth=1000\n\"set number\n\"set backspace=indent,eol,start\nset noshowmatch\n\nsyntax on\nlet g:loaded_matchparen=1 \n:set nocp\n\nis there a solution to fix the problem?\n\nA: You can try to put these in your .vimrc:\n  autocmd GuiEnter * set background&\n\n  set ttimeoutlen=100\n  set ttyfast\n  set lazyredraw\n\n  :au CursorMoved\n  autocmd BufReadPost quickfix map <buffer> <leader>qq :cclose<cr>|map <buffer> <c-p> <up>|map <buffer> <c-n> <down>\n  set synmaxcol=120\n  set nocursorline\n  set re=1\n  :redraw\n\nAnother solution can be:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/19030290/syntax-highlighting-causes-terrible-lag-in-vim\nI had the same issue and these worked for me on my 15k drive.

I have a very disturbing problem running LyX with Ubuntu 12.04 on my Dell Inspiron.  Ever since I purchased this laptop and installed Ubuntu 12.04, it periodically freezes and nothing can be done to wake it up except a hard reset.  That by itself is not a huge deal as I am always saving important files, etc.\nHowever, three separate times now, when I am working in LyX and the freeze happens both the file that was open in LyX and the backup file (filename.lyx~) are completely destroyed.  After reboot, the files still appear in the file system but are of size 0 kb.\nNeedless to say, this is a dire situation to encounter and requires constantly backing files on a flash disk or remote machine.\nHas anyone else had this problem?  Or, any ideas what might have happened to those files?  Perhaps LyX backs them up somewhere else temporarily, and they are stuck there when the OS crashes?\nI couldn't find a single crash log or any other useful information.  But I will gladly post other technical details if they are of use in diagnosing the problem.\nThank you!\n\nA: I had some luck with a workaround that I thought I would share.  Instead of letting LyX back up files in the present working directory (the default setting), I created a backup directory in ~/.lyx/ and changed LyX's default settings (under Tools > Preferences > Paths) to save backups there. \nMy laptop inevitably hard-froze again and the .lyx file I was working on was again destroyed.  However, upon reboot I was able to restore the document from the new backup directory.  \nIt's certainly not a perfect solution, but not a bad temporary fix and perhaps gives a little insight into the larger issue of how the files are being corrupted when the OS freezes.\n\nA: I had recently the same problem (Ubuntu 14.10, LyX 2.1.1). Let's say the name of the file is paper.lyx. \nI found that my work was saved not only in paper.lyx and paper.lyx.emergency, which were indeed empty after the crash (not entirely, though, 12Ko instead of 130), but also in the hidden file paper.lyx~.\nI renamed this file paper2.lyx, and it was almost complete (only my very last update was missing).\n", "Q: LTS for 12.04.02 Since 12.04 is an LTS version, does that means that it will have long support no matter what 12.04.X it is? \nE.g.: Can I have 12.04.01 and still be supported until 2017?\n\nA: Yes. GNU/Linux Ubuntu \"Precise Pangolin\" 12.04 LTS is supported until April 2017.\nWhich means that we get updates/security fixes for 5 years from the date of release. We can set Ubuntu to check for updates every day, every 2 days, weekly, every fortnight or never.\nPlease see the following links:\n\n\n*\n\n*Precise Upgrades\n\n*Ubuntu LTS\nAs soon as GNU/Linux Ubuntu \"Trusy Tahr\" 14.04 LTS is released you can upgrade from 12.04 LTS direct to 14.04 LTS.\n\n\nA: Yes,you can have Ubuntu 12.04.01 point LTS release still  be supported until 2017.\n\nLike other LTS releases, 12.04 will include point releases that bundle updates to shorten downloads for users installing the release later in its lifecycle.\nThe point releases and dates are: 12.04.1 (23 August 2012), 12.04.2 (14 February 2013), 12.04.3 (scheduled for release on 22 August 2013, but actually released on 23 August 2013) and 12.04.4 (6 February 2014). No further point releases of Ubuntu 12.04 are scheduled.\n\nSource\nWhat are point releases in LTS versions?\n\nA: Actually if you installed 12.04.y and you upgrade it to be up-to-date then you are basically running the latest 12.04.x. The only things which not get automatically updated to the latest 12.04.x are the kernel and the X-server. The latter ones don't get automatically updated because of the If it ain't broke, don't fix it policy. \nYou can check this if you run lsb_release -a on your machine. I installed 12.04 in April 2012 and now for me this is the output of that command:\nDistributor ID: Ubuntu\nDescription:    Ubuntu 12.04.3 LTS\nRelease:    12.04\nCodename:   precise\n\nI only installed the important and recommended upgrades but you can see it reports 12.04.3 LTS for me.\nIf you want to get the kernel and X-server present in a point release released after your installation you just have to opt into the hardware enablement stack for Precise by installing the kernel and X-server of a point release. For more info on the hardware enablement stack and how to opt into it visit this site. \nBut you can keep your kernel version and X-server of course, those are supported for 5 years too. From the aforementioned site:\n\nThe original 12.04 stack in Precise will remain supported for the usual 5yr life cycle of the LTS release.\n\n", "Q: How do I SSH into Ubuntu on VirtualBox? How do I SSH into Ubuntu from an outside network? It's running in VirtualBox and the network adapter has to remain NAT. I can't seem to figure out how to set it up. Are there any ways to directly SSH into the VirtualBox session?\n\nA: When the VM networking is based on NAT, you need to use port forwarding to remotely access the VM (here named ubuntu).\nVBoxManage modifyvm \"ubuntu\" --natpf1 \"guestssh,tcp,,2222,,22\"\n\nThen you'll be able to access the VM by connecting to the host on port 2222, eg:\nssh -p 2222 user@host\n\n", "Q: Modifying the appearance of gvim I wanted to set the color scheme of gvim to 'evening' and have line numbers displayed everytime I start. But I can't find the right .gvimrc file and how can I set these default settings. Help much appreciated. Thanks!\n\nA: That should be in the .vimrc file in your home directory (if you have none, just create one with that name), the .gvimrc is typically for things that rely on gvim, like say, hiding the menu bar or toolbar would go there, all vim behavior itself goes into .vimrc\nAnyway both should be placed in your home directory, and gvim will load both .vimrc and then .gvimrc afterwards when starting.\nTo get the evening scheme and numbers working, add this to your .vimrc\n\" look & feel\nsyntax on\nset background=dark\ncolorscheme evening\n\n\" for showing line numbers\nset number\n\n", "Q: MySQL won't start after removing bind-address So, I am running mysql on an ubuntu server (command-line) VirtualBox, on a Windows 7 host. In the Virtual machine, I changed the /etc/mysql/my.cnf file by commenting out the line\nbind-address = 127.0.0.1\n\nso it looks like\n#bind-address = 127.0.0.1\n\nI then restarted the server like so:\nperrin@LinuxServer1:~$ sudo /etc/init.d/mysql restart\n[sudo] password for perrin:\n * Stopping MySQL database server mysqld    [ OK ]\n * Starting MySQL database server mysqld    [ OK ]\n\nAfter this, I started getting this error whenever I try to connect to mysql, like so:\nperrin@LinuxServer1:~$ mysql -u root -p\nEnter password:\nError 2002 (HY000): Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/\nrun/mysqld/mysqld.sock' (2)\n\nI searched for help and found out that my MySQL server was NOT running, even though it had SAID [ OK ] when starting back up. (lying P.O.S.)\nSo I try to start it, using both start and restart like so:\nperrin@LinuxServer1:~$ sudo /etc/init.d/mysql start\n * Starting MySQL database server mysqld    [fail]\nperrin@LinuxServer1:~$ sudo /etc/init.d/mysql restart\n * Stopping MySQL database server mysqld    [ OK ]\n * Starting MySQL database server mysqld    [fail]\n\nSo I go back to the my.cnf and un-comment the bind-address = 127.0.0.1 line, so that everything is EXACTLY as it was before, and try again to start/restart the server. It fails again in exactly the same way.\nI've searched all over the web for help and found a few SIMILAR problems people were having, but nothing ultimately useful, or that gave me any tips that led to a solution.\nDoes anyone have any idea what is going on here? I'm stumped.\n\nA: In the list of related questions here on AskUbuntu, I noticed one titled \"12.04 - MySql won't start by using service mysql start\".\nReading this alerted me to the fact that MySQL can be stopped/started/restarted with:\nperrin@LinuxServer1:~$ sudo service mysql stop\n\nor\nperrin@LinuxServer1:~$ sudo service mysql start\n\nor\nperrin@LinuxServer1:~$ sudo service mysql restart\n\nThese methods worked for me, even after commenting out the bind-address line in my.cnf, and I can now log into mysql again after starting/restarting it up.\nIt just bugs me that I don't know why the init.d method doesn't work. :(\n", "Q: Change Permissions I need to change permission for all the files on my hard disk [not system files].

I have always seen people discuss using UUIDs in hard drives instead of /dev/sdN.\nWhat is the real benefit of using a UUID? Is it faster, more reliable, easier to remember (ha lol no), what?\nAnd, isn't it possible to change a UUID? Is there a way to identify a drive (especially in GRUB) that can never change?\n\nA: What is the real benefit of using a UUID?\nGenerally, the UUID is constant for the same drive/partition no matter what system it is attatched to.\nThe /dev/sdN naming scheme  increments the final letter (N) for each device plugged in (a, b, c, d, etc.). This means that the /dev/sd identifier assigned to the device changes if it is attached in a different order.\nAnd, isn't it possible to change a UUID?\nYes, see here.\nIs there a way to identify a drive (especially in GRUB) that can never change?\nThat's what UUIDs are for. They're probably the most stable solution you can get.\n\nUsing UUIDs in scripts and the like\nIf you are instructed to perform a command like this:\ndd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/null \n\n... you can replace /dev/sda with a file in /dev/disk/by-uuid/ to reference the disk by UUID instead of sdN.\nRun these commands to get the UUIDs (and sdN notation) of drives on your system:\nfor disk in /dev/disk/by-uuid/*; do\n    readlink -e \"$disk\"\n    echo \"${disk#/dev/disk/by-uuid/}\"\n    echo\ndone\n\n\nA: It becomes important because numbers can, and sometimes do, change. That happens usually if you change the partition table in some way. For example you may have had 2 partitions: sda1 and sda2, you later delete sda1 and make two separate ones out of it. Normally fdisk will not change the number of sda2, but some other tools (gparted i believe) will, so now your sda2 becomes sda3, but it will still have the same UUID.\nUUID is impossible to change without changing the actual partition, and if you do that, then it really isn't clear if you still want to mount that newly created one.\n\nA: What is the real benefit of using a UUID? Is it faster, more reliable, easier to remember (ha lol no), what?\nHere is a real life example of why you should be using UUIDs instead of /dev/XXX when mounting in fstab. (So yes, it is more reliable as the UUID won't change when a drive from the chain is out.) \nThe other well known real life situation where UUIDs come handy is at booting to identify the device which you want to boot in GRUB. Because without the UUID the drive numbering scheme is dependent on the BIOS boot-order and changing the boot-order in the BIOS can cause problems. (Say you were booting from a SATA drive, then you plugged in an ATA drive and changed the boot-order to first boot the ATA. After that you fromat the ATA drive (which is now not bootable) but not revert the boot-order. Your BIOS will boot the SATA drive as the ATA drive is not bootable but is is totally possibly that GRUB now won't find your drive if you aren't using UUIDs.) This is written in the GRUB's manual too here.\nAnd, isn't it possible to change a UUID?\nYes you can change the UUIDs, but this doesn't defeat the purpose of the UUID. The purpose of the UUID is to be constant across reboots and across machines no matter what is the machine's setup or where you plug in the drive. The purpose is not that to give your drive an unchangeable name for its lifetime.\nIs there a way to identify a drive (especially in GRUB) that can never change?\nTechnically for some of the drives it possible to identify them in a way that can never change as the drives have a World Wide Name and/or a serial number. Normally these values are not changeable and they are unique to the drive. (Technically it might be possible to change these values too.) You can view such info about your drive with e.g. sudo hdparm -I /dev/sda . (Likely that the mass manufactured cheap or not cheap USB pendrives/memory cards doesn't always have such identification.)\nBut these unique identifiers are for the drive and for the OS and for you the more important is a unique identifier for the partition, thats what the UUID is for. And since partitions are changeable on a drive of course the UUIDs are changeable too.\n", "Q: BURG - Cant Boot computer because of BURG (PLEASE HELP!!)

I've been looking around the internet for tutorials on how to add the Korean keyboard. As of now, the only thing I've done is I added the Korean language in my Region & Language system settings. Please help!\n\nA: I hope that this helps. I struggled for some time with this exact same problem. I used to have no problem prior to Ubuntu 13.10. I just upgraded to 14.04 and decided to figure it out again... got it this time and it is REALLY SIMPLE and WORKs... it just isn't too straight forward and there are misleading problems with the adding keyboard step... anyway... try he following and let me know if this works for you!!!\nSummary: How to set Ubuntu 14.04 to utilize Hangul.\nBackground: Since Ubuntu 13.10, the ibus interface became difficult to setup for Hangul. There were issues (most resolved by 14.04) with switching keys. Primary issue appears to be if you want to set the Right Alt key to serve as the \"Hangul\" key to switch between input modes. This is compounded by the fact that Linux utilizes many keyboard shortcuts and conflicts with modifiers persist. In the past, the dialogs required for setting up IBus for Korean were much different. Ubuntu is on the correct track with the Keyboard Language setup; however, it is confusing for those of us that utilized previous procedures due to lack of information.\nIssues:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ability to utilize the Right Alt key for selecting Hangul.\n\n*Zenity (the program that provides GUI interfaces for many scripts,\ndoesn't display the im-config properly. For that reason, recommend\nrunning from command promt (terminal) with -c option. \n\n*It is misleading for users of a clean install to be able to select \"korean\"\nkeyboard from Text Entry prior to installing the correct package (or\nrather, that the selection doesn't trigger installation of the\nibus-hangul package.\n\n\nProcess:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install ibus-hangul\nCode:\nsudo apt-get install ibus-hangul\n\n*Run im-config to configure the IM client. If your system is not a \"COMPLETELY clean\" install where everything is new (ie - did not remount an older \"home\" partition), recommend that you run im-config twice. First run, delete the config in your home directory. Second run, select ibus as the input method. From a terminal (CTRL+ALT+T)\nCode:\nim-config -c\n\n\n*Setup \"Text Entry Settings\". From Dash, type \"Text\" and select \"Text Entry\" option. Alternatively, select system syettings (Power/Config icon top right of screen), then select \"Text Entry\" option. Once in the screen, execute the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*In bottom left, click the + to add a keybaord.\n\n*In new dialog box - filter list by typing \"Korean\"\n\n*You will SEE three options:\nKorean\nKorean (101/104)\nKorean (Hangul)\n\n\n\nSELECT \"Korean (Hangul)\" and click ADD.\n*If you do not see Korean (Hangul) in the list, restart the computer.\n\n\n*\n\n*Configure Korean Keybaord -- Select \"Korean (Hangul) in the \"Input Sources to Use:\" part of Text Entry. Now, in bottom right of the \"input sources to use\" you will see a \"configure\" button right next tot he small \"Keyboard\" icon. Select that to configure the Hangul input options.\n\n*OPTIONAL: You may wish to configure the keyboard switching options. Default is \"Super + Space\". I don't like that, so I default mine to an alternate key (currently the \"menu\" key which I rarely use). Right Alt doesn't work (my preferred since that is the location for the \"hangul\" key normally.) \n\nA: Select System Settings -> Text Entry and add it there.\n", "Q: Command line tool file top: ftop? On RH-epel there is an useful tool ftop to see file top, io and which files are used.\nAre there an alternative tools in ubuntu??\n\nA: Have you tried htop?

I already saved the most important stuff. Now I'm sitting in front of a Mac OS X client with the terminal open (ssh).\nI need to save the whole or at least the most important install commands I wrote. So basically the first 1k commands...\nI would like to print that & save it to a file. So I can easily reinstall everything.\nBy the way, also save some hard researched config files that I don't remember where they are.\n\nA: There is already a hidden file in your home directory called .bash_history which you can print it. One observation here: this file, in a default configuration, doesn't contain the commands used in your current opened terminal session. So, close the terminal before to print it.\nBut if you want to save the terminal history in another file, then you can use the following command (this new file will contain also and the commands used in your currently opened terminal session):\nhistory > history_for_print.txt\n\nA new file called history_for_print.txt will be created in your currently working directory containing your last used commands (by default HISTSIZE=1000 and HISTFILESIZE=2000, but you can change these values in your ~/.bashrc file).\n\nA: To save your code outputs which display in command window you can use\nfor example\n./ABC.sh &> output.txt\nThis command save all outputs include errors and esults into text file\n", "Q: What is the role of lock files in a system? I can see there are many lock file here and there in my system. What is the exact role and purpose of those lock files?\nIn my system I got this list,\n/run/lock/whoopsie/lock\n/proc/sys/dev/cdrom/lock\n/var/lib/dpkg/lock\n/var/lib/apt/lists/lock\n/var/cache/apt/archives/lock\n\n\nA: They are all lock files. Link for more information.\nDifferent applications and daemons create their lock files, if they need to protect themselves from crashing or from corrupting information. \nFor example:\n/run/lock/whoopsie/lock\n\nlock for whoopsie, it is Ubuntu Error Reporting daemon. It collects information about crashes, so it need to protect some information from changes until it collects everything.\n/proc/sys/dev/cdrom/lock\n\nLock file for you cdrom device. Only one application at a time can control cdrom device, that's why it is there. The same thing for every devices.\n/var/lib/dpkg/lock\n/var/lib/apt/lists/lock\n/var/cache/apt/archives/lock\n\nLock file for package managers. They usually blocking their sources database\nAlso a little quote from wikipedia:\nThe following example illustrates the interceding update problem:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Process A reads a customer record from a file containing account information, including the customer's account balance and phone\n  number.\n  \n*Process B now reads the same record from the same file so it has its own copy.\n  \n*Process A changes the account balance in its copy of the customer record and writes the record back to the file.\n  \n*Process B, which still has the original stale value for the account balance in its copy of the customer record, updates the account\n  balance and writes the customer record back to the file.\n  \n*Process B has now written its stale account-balance value to the file, causing the changes made by process A to be lost.\n\nThis is one of examples. There many other situations that can lead to a problem. That's why OS need lock files\n\nA: They're generally used to ensure only one instance of an application is running at once. \nThis is particularly important in programs like apt-get which may break if more than one instance runs at once.\n", "Q: What does `do-release-upgrade` really do? We know that do-release-upgrade “does a release upgrade”. But at a little lower level what does it really do?\nI plan to do a more manual upgrade, for instance the Debian way: aptitude update and aptitude full-upgrade after setting up the sources. Actually, I plan to do it entirely interactive with aptitude. But that leaves me curious about what else do-relase-upgrade does, except hosing up my sources.list.\n\nA: do-release-upgrade is part of the package “update-manager-core”. The script seems to determine which release you are going to upgrade to, try to find out if it’s supported or not and complain about the latter. – If it’s convinced to work, it downloads the release-specific UpgradeTool and runs it.\nPart of the “update-manager-core” package is the file /etc/update-manager/meta-release, where you can find the URL http://changelogs.ubuntu.com/meta-release and there you find the URL for the UpgradeTool to download.\nThe downloaded UpgradeTool tarball is packaged from the source package “ubuntu-release-upgrader” (before it was “update-manager”). The version corresponds to the latest updates for the target release.\nThe source has an old README from warty and hoary release times. It discusses what should be done during a release upgrade. It also mentions a link to a more detailed UpgradeTool proposal.\nI list here the actions mentioned there and checked if they are actually implemented:\n\n\n*\n\n*repository related\n\n\n*\n\n*switch to new sources.list entries\n\n*remove unknown 3rd party repositories\n\n*possibly swap mirror (not implemented)\n\n\n*package related\n\n\n*\n\n*check there are no broken packages before upgrading\n\n*update current release before upgrading (apt-get update only)\n\n*remove and install specific packages\n\n*check if {ubuntu,kubuntu,edubuntu}-desktop is installed\n\n*get rid of old kernels\n\n*have a removal-blacklist and -whitelist\n\n*remove or replace obsolete packages which existed in earlier releases\n\n\n*configuration related (possible in quirks: see below)\n\n\n*\n\n*adding the default user to new groups (not done for the versions I checked)\n\n*check some config files\n\n\n\nThe UpgradeTool is configured for each release using the following files (open them to see!):\n\n\n*\n\n*DistUpgrade.cfg\n\n\n*\n\n*UpgradeTool-related configuration\n\n*release-related configuration\n\n*repositories (e.g. [Sources] ValidMirrors)\n\n*custom changes ([Distro] PostInstallScript)\n\n*special packages; processed only by DistUpgradeController.py:\n\n\n*\n\n*[Distro] RemoveObsoletes, ForcedObsoletes, BaseMetaPkgs, MetaPkgs\n\n*[meta_package_name] ForcedObsoletes\n\n\n*...and by DistUpgradeCache.py:\n\n\n*\n\n*[Distro] MetaPkgs, RemovalBlacklist, RemoveEssentialOk, BadVersions, BaseMetaPkgs, PurgeObsoletes, Demotions, KeyDependencies\n\n*[Distro and meta_package_name] KeepInstalledPkgs, KeepInstalledSection, PostUpgrade*\n\n*[KernelRemoval] *\n\n\n\n*DistUpgradeQuirks.py\n\n\n*\n\n*runs (release) specific functions (same file) and plugins (plugins directory)\n\n*functions must have specific names (e.g. from_nattyPreCacheOpen()) and plugins special condition attributes (e.g. * or PostInitialUpdate)\n\n*one of those functions, StartUpgrade(), is another grab-bag itself: among others it calls _applyPatches(), which goes over the files in the patches directory\n\n*all these do pretty much nothing on my installation (i386, packages not older than natty-updates)\n\n\n*more from DistUpgradeCache.py\n\n\n*\n\n*runs get_kernel_list.sh (not in trusty) and makes sure one kernel is installed\n\n*some handling about Nvidia drivers\n\n\n\nChecked versions:\n\n\n*\n\n*natty → oneiric\n\n*oneiric → precise\n\n*precise → trusty (final as of 2014-04-18)\n\n*trusty → utopic (hours before release on 2014-10-23)\n\n", "Q: Executable files, office, mathematical equations I am student of software engineering, so for those purposes, I need some software to run it. \nI have to create c++ programs and I have got a development environment.

And if not, then what can I use to type mathematical equations, like fractions, squareroots, derivatives etc.\nAnd which software can be use to create flow charts and graphs?\n\nA: Unless you are willing to accept a new toolset, rather than using the old tools through wine, a change to Ubuntu doesn't make a lot of sense to me.\nI'm sure there are lots of competent people here who can give advice on cross-compilation in Eclipse (or any other IDE) under Ubuntu.\nLibreOffice with its modules (Writer, Calc, Impress) is a good replacement for MS Office (MSO). LibreOffice Writer comes with an Equation Editor, comparable to that in MSO. The latter is a stripped-down version of MathType.\nIf you want high-quality, publication-ready math typing, graphs, etc., please consider to give LaTeX a chance.\n", "Q: Partitions created in Windows are not showing in Ubuntu I want to install Ubuntu 12.10 64 bit alongside Windows 8, so I created some free space in Windows 8.\nWhen I try to install Ubuntu using a Live USB, the free space created is not visible and the partitions shown are completely different.\nBut when I click the option \"Try Ubuntu\", I am able to use my Windows partitions.\n\nA: Ubuntu does not support Windows-specific \"dynamic\" disks. This may be one reason for partitions not showing up on installing Ubuntu or when partitioning a drive from Ubuntu.\n\nBefore we partition a drive on Ubuntu we therefore have to change the partitions type from \"dynamic\" to \"basic\".\n\nObviously this can only be done from Windows (see Window Server Support and Microsoft Technet), e.g. with a partitioning tool (e.g. AOMEI Partition Assistant).\n", "Q: Unable to find GIMP after installation through Software Center I installed Gimp through the Ubuntu Software Center and the software center says it's installed, but it doesn't appear in the dash and I can't find a way to start it. \nI tried connecting to the Gimp website and tried to sign in/create an account & it won't remember my password, thus I can't log in.

I've got it to work in one way, by adding the following line to /etc/rc.local:\nsh /opt/jboss-eap-6.1/bin/domain.sh\n\nAlthough from what I've read this isn't really a recommended approach. From what I can understand the approach we used for JBoss 5 involved putting a symbolic link into the run level initialisation directories (/etc/rc2.d/ for example) that referenced another script in /etc/init.d to start the service. \nI've tried this for JBoss 6.1, and although if I manually start the process up with \"sh /etc/rc2.d/S01jboss6.1\", JBoss starts to run, this process does not run of it's own accord on startup.\nI believe I'm correct in thinking Ubuntu starts up in run level 2 so is it not the case that this script in /etc/rc2.d/ should run when the OS is booted?\nThanks.\n\nA: I don't know JBoss. Is your script a one shot or does it keep running? For services that keep in foreground (on a terminal) and stay running you can write an upstart service something like the following. If it is a one shot or spawns a daemon process you need to edit the start script below, otherwise upstart won't have control over the process or tries to execute it several times.\nThe script needs to be executable and in /etc/init/myscript.conf. Then make a symbolic link from /etc/init.d/myscript to /lib/init/upstart-job\nln -s /lib/init/upstart-job /etc/init.d/myscript\n\nYou can start your script like this: service myscript start\ndescription     \"myscript\"\nauthor          \"you\"\n\nstart on (local-filesystems and net-device-up)\nstop on runlevel [!2345]\n\nkill timeout 50\n\nrespawn\nrespawn limit 1 5\n\nenv USER=\"user\"\nenv PIDFILE=\"/var/run/myscript.pid\"\nenv DAEMON=\"path/to/script\"\n\npre-start script\n  do smothing\nend script\n\n# starting ...\nexec start-stop-daemon --start --chuid $USER --pidfile $PIDFILE --make-pidfile --exec $DAEMON -- all my options 2>&1 >> /var/log/my.log\n\npre-stop script\n        do something\n        sleep 2\nend script\n\n# spring clean\npost-stop exec rm -f $PIDFILE\n\nFor more infos see : http://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/\n", "Q: apt-get install --reinstall --install-recommends not installing a recommended package With either one of the following commands, I expect python-omniorb-omg to be installed, which didn't get so however.

Unlike the \"upgrade\" target, which installs the\n  newest version of all currently installed packages, \"install\" will\n  install the newest version of only the package(s) specified.

Note that a recommended package is not a dependency.\nAlso, --reinstall re-installs only the packages that are already installed.\n--install-recommends has no effect in this case because no package is going to be installed (only upgrades). I think this is the expected behavior. If you choose to not install (or to remove) a recommended package, you will not want that package installed whenever you do an upgrade.\nMaybe the recommended package wasn't installed at the first time due to download failure (or maybe something else).\n", "Q: Ubuntu boot failed I have Kubuntu 13.04 installed and it was working fine until today, it's failed to boot with mounting failed message.\nI've run the Boot Repair but didn't fix my problem.\nIf anyone can help, that would be much appreciated.\nThanks!\n\nA: *\n\n*Change Legacy/Bios mode into UEFI mode in bios.\n\n*And then follow the steps given in this link to convert Ubuntu into EFI mode.\n", "Q: GnuPG with GPA & Seahorse I recently installed the GnuPG GUIs on Ubuntu, GPA & Seahorse.

You can't upgrade directly to 64 bit from 32.\nThe safest and cleanest procedure is to do a backup of your personal data and, after that, a new installation of Ubuntu over the existing one. It will not harm or wear out your computer but be aware that the 64 bit versions are in some cases less stable and have different packages and (obviously) different bugs.\nIf you want to run a server there is Ubuntu Server, which is done specifically for that.\nFollow my instructions to install Ubuntu 64 bit without losing your current software configuration:\n\n\n*\n\n*In a terminal execute sudo dpkg --get-selections > ~/softwarelist.\n\n*Install the x64 Ubuntu over the existing one. If asked to preserve Home, say yes.\n\n*Execute sudo dpkg --set-selections < ~/softwarelist.\n\n*Execute sudo apt-get -f install. You will have some errors, but all should be fine.\n\n*Reboot.\n\n\nThis procedure is valid for the 12.04, it can change with older/newer versions.\nPlease, press the UP arrow if I'm usefull and mark as best answer if you solve. \nHave a nice experience and comment down here for any issue, you'll be helped if possible.\n", "Q: Installation Ubuntu in text mode How to install Ubuntu 13.10 in text mode?

(sudo apt-get install ...). \nThe reason why I need to do this is that:\nMy '/' is mounted with my SSD(16GB) and my hard disk(500GB) is mounted at '/home'. \nI have already installed my Ubuntu 12.04 on that SSD. There is not much free space under '/' now.  \n\nA: You can not do that with sudo apt-get install. \nEither...\n\n\n*\n\n*Get a bigger disc.\n\n*If the disc has more operating systems re-partition such that Ubuntu has at least 10Gb. Ubuntu works perfectly fine with 10Gb. I have never even reached that (and I use both apache and mysql on my system where mysql does not use my ssd for the databases ;) )\n\n*Re-install your system such that the directories where software is installed are mounted on the other (500Gb) disc (like /home is mounted in your 2nd disc you can also mount /etc/, /bin/ on that disc). \n\n*Install all software manually from source. But this will not help when installing the base system and all its default software. \n\n\nAlternative:\n\n\n*\n\n*you could also switch to another operating system. Redhat has an option (--relocate) in their package system where you can set where to install. So does Gentoo (prefix; but entoo installs from source so this is not a package manager).\n\n", "Q: How to sync a data from windows app to cloud within wine? I am using xin inventory which is a very nice inventory management windows application. I bought it a couple of years back and I use it to manage around 600 products.

I wanted same in ubuntu. \nKindly suggest me the best possible way of achieving this.\nThanks & regards\n\nA: If you have no problems running xin under wine but you want to synchronize other folders outside the wine installation, you could try with a symbolic link:\nln -s $HOME/Dropbox /path/to/.wine/folder\n\nI use something similar to synchronize saved games between computers under Wine.\n", "Q: How to reduce the command line prefix length in Bash How to reduce the command line prefix length (i.e folder name or path in bash)?\nFor example:\nvenu@venupc:~$ cd Documents/Code/new/\nvenu@venupc:~/Documents/Code/new$\n\nI want to display present folder name new instead of complete path (venu@venupc: new$).\n\nA: Read man bash, the PROMPTING section, and about the PROMPT_DIRTRIM environment variable.\n  PROMPT_DIRTRIM\n          If set to a number greater than zero, the value is used as the number of trail‐\n          ing  directory  components to retain when expanding the \\w and \\W prompt string\n          escapes (see PROMPTING below).

It's pretty ugly but it works.\n\nBut I don't think it's the best. I personally prefer pacman (sudo apt-get install pacman), mostly because it looks like the original Pacman game...

I want an answer that does this automatically.\"\n\nWhile researching the solutions to this problem I've stumbled upon this question from stackexchange, which allows binding CtrlJ to a sequence of commands: Ctrla (move to beginning of line), place \"mesure\" string in front of the command you entered, Ctrlm (execute)\nThus you get functionality of auto-completion and separate ENTER command for measuring time, while perserving original purpose of the second function i posted bellow. \nAs of now, here are the contents of my ~/.inputrc file:\n\"\\C-j\": \"\\C-a measure \\C-m\"\nAnd here are the contents of .bashrc (note , I haven't been using bash in forever - I use mksh as my shell , hence that's what you see in the original post.

And you want to use a command through it so that it will give you desired notification if running time of your command is more than 15 sec. So here is it.\n\nwrapper(){\n    start=$(date +%s)\n    \"$@\"\n    [ $(($(date +%s) - start)) -le 15 ] || notify-send \"Notification\" \"Long\\\n running command \\\"$(echo $@)\\\" took $(($(date +%s) - start)) seconds to finish\"\n}\n\nCopy this function in your ~/.bashrc and source ~/.bashrc as,\n. ~/.bashrc\n\nUseage\nwrapper <your_command>\n\nIf it takes more than 15 sec you will get the desktop-notification describing the command and its time of execution.\nExample\nwrapper sudo apt-get update\n\n\n\nA: In ~/.bashrc there is an alias alert defined as:\nalias alert='notify-send --urgency=low -i \"$([ $? = 0 ] && echo terminal || echo error)\" \"$(history|tail -n1|sed -e '\\''s/^\\s*[0-9]\\+\\s*//;s/[;&|]\\s*alert$//'\\'')\"'\n\nwhich can be used to notify the completion of command execution.\nUsage:\n$ the_command; alert\n\ne.g. \n$ sudo apt-get update; alert\n\n\nYou may customize the alias as per your need and desire.\n\nA: You want https://launchpad.net/undistract-me (installable from the Ubuntu archives with sudo apt-get install undistract-me) which does precisely what you're asking for, including working automatically (that is, without having to remember to add something extra to potentially long-running commands). \n\nA: Apart from a wrapper like souravc suggested, there isn't really any good way to do this in bash. You can hack your way around it with a DEBUG trap and a PROMPT_COMMAND. A DEBUG trap is triggered whenever you run a command, and PROMPT_COMMAND is run just before the prompt is written.\nSo stuff for ~/.bashrc becomes something like\ntrap '_start=$SECONDS' DEBUG\nPROMPT_COMMAND='(if (( SECONDS - _start > 15 )); then notify-send \"Long running command ended\"; fi)'\n\nThis is a hack, so don't be surprised if you encounter odd side-effects with this.\n\nA: Your script works quite well, just make sure you include the 'shebang' (#!/bin/bash) line. Other ones to #!/bin/bash are mentioned here, but most of the time, #!/bin/bash works fine for Unix bash scripts. It is required by the script interpreter so it know what type of script it is.\nThis seems to work as a test script:\n#!/bin/bash\nstart=$(date +%s);\n   echo Started\n   sleep 20;\n   echo Finished!\n[ $(($(date +%s) - start)) -le 15 ] || notify-send -i dialog-warning-symbolic \"Header\" \"Message\"\n\nTo modify this script, put the command(s) where the echo and sleep lines are.\nNote with notify-send, you can use -i to specify an icon as well :-)\nAlso, make sure it is executable by running chmod +x /PATH/TO/FILE on it first.\n\nA: You can modify Bash to implement the wrapper functionality you want.\nIf you're inclined to make many such modifications to your interactive shell, you might consider switching to an intrinsically hackable shell like eshell, which is built using Emacs elisp and has all its storied customizability:\nhttp://www.masteringemacs.org/articles/2010/12/13/complete-guide-mastering-eshell/\n\nA: You can also do this with a simple if statement like this\n#!/bin/bash\n\nSTART=$(date +%s)\n\nTIME=$(($START+15))\n\nORIGINAL_COMMAND;\n\nEND=$(date +%s)\n\nif [ $END -gt $TIME ]\nthen\n    notify-send \"Task Completed\"\nfi\n\nYou can use your own variable names.\nI can confirm that this works, I tested with a command that takes a long time to finish and one that does not and the notification comes for the one that takes a long time\nYou can also do this with any command by replacing ORIGINAL_COMMAND with $@ and running the script as ./script command. \n", "Q: How to install php IMAP for php5-fpm?

I am trying to setup virtio-serial to communicate between a virtual machine and its host. For this, I am following the instructions given here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using virtio serial to communicate\nI understand that there is a port on the host at tmp/foo on the host which is exposed as a special character device at /dev/hvc0 on the guest. The instruction manual asks to use socat on the host and agetty on the guest to spawn the console ports.\nHowever, on using agetty, I do not get any console port, whereas, on using socat on the guest as well, I can communicate with the host.\nI would like to know what are the primary differences between socat and agetty and whether this is the correct way to use socat, considering /dev/hvc0 is a special character device.\nI have given a look at the manual pages of both and would like a detailed description.\n\nA: Socat is a command line based utility that establishes two bidirectional byte streams and transfers data between them. Because the streams can be constructed from a large set of different types of data sinks and sources, and because lots of address options may be applied to the streams, socat can be used for many different purposes.nixCraft\nsocat can do serial line stuff, and it can do fairly advanced functionality, like having multiple clients listen on a port, or reusing connections.  The life cycle of a socat instance typically consists of four phases.\n\n\n*\n\n*In the init phase, the command line options are parsed and logging is\ninitialized.\n\n*During the open phase, socat opens the first address and afterwards\nthe second address. These steps are usually blocking; thus,\nespecially for complex address types like socks, connection requests\nor authentication dialogs must be completed before the next step is\nstarted.\n\n*In the transfer phase, socat watches both streams' read and write\nfile descriptors via select() , and, when data is available on one\nside and can be written to the other side, socat reads it, performs\nnewline character conversions if required, and writes the data to the\nwrite file descriptor of the other stream, then continues waiting for\nmore data in both directions.\n\n*When one of the streams effectively reaches EOF, the closing phase\nbegins. Socat transfers the EOF condition to the other stream, it\ntries to shutdown only its write stream, giving it a chance to\nterminate gracefully. For a defined time socat continues to transfer\ndata in the other direction, but then closes all remaining channels\nand terminates.\n\n\nagetty opens a tty port, prompts for a login name and invokes the /bin/login command. It is normally invoked by init(8).  agetty has several non-standard features that are useful for hard-wired and for dial-in lines:ManPage\n\n\n*\n\n*Adapts the tty settings to parity bits and to erase, kill,\nend-of-line and uppercase characters when it reads a login name. The\nprogram can handle 7-bit characters with even, odd, none or space\nparity, and 8-bit characters with no parity. The following special\ncharacters are recognized: @ and Control-U (kill); #, DEL and back\nspace (erase); carriage return and line feed (end of line).\n\n*Optionally deduces the baud rate from the CONNECT messages produced\nby Hayes(tm)-compatible modems.\n\n*Optionally does not hang up when it is given an already opened line\n(useful for call-back applications).\n\n*Optionally does not display the contents of the /etc/issue file.\n\n*Optionally displays an alternative issue file instead of /etc/issue.\n\n*Optionally does not ask for a login name.\n\n*Optionally invokes a non-standard login program instead of\n/bin/login.\n\n*Optionally turns on hard-ware flow control\n\n*Optionally forces the line to be local with no need for carrier\ndetect.\n\n*Supports ringback, if desired. The actual procedure that getty uses\nis as follows: Initially, getty parses its command line. If no errors\nare found, and the tty type from the command line is set to \"unknown\"\n(the default value), or not set, getty checks for the tty type in\n/etc/ttytype if the program was compiled with TTYTYPE defined. If a\ntty type is found, either on the command line or in the /etc/ttytype\nfile, then it is placed into the TERM environment variable. Next,\ngetty scans the defaults file, normally /etc/default/getty, to\ndetermine certain runtime values (/etc/conf.getty if compiled with\nFSSTND option). The values in the defaults file (whose compiled-in\nname can be altered with the optional -d defaults_file argument) take\nprecedence to those on the command line. Getty then opens the port\nfor reading and writing, and disables stdio buffering. If an\ninitialization was specified, it is performed.\n\n\nExtra Sources: Socat, agetty MP\n", "Q: Font for Keyboard Layout I want my keyboard layout as per Anmol Font.

This would appear as a notification in the top-right, similar to if a command was sent using notify-send. Since upgrading to 13.10, though, the notifications have stopped using the notifier, and instead pop up with a grey box with the track details in the background as below. \n\nI don't know what changed in between Ubuntu versions (this has been ever since I upgraded to 13.10, never saw anything like it before).\nI've tried playing around with the Song Change function, putting notify-send \"%T\" \"%a\\n%b\" as the command to get the track details at least (%T is the track title, %a is the artist and %b is the album title), but there doesn't seem to be any way of displaying the album art at all (the filepath to the album art isn't listed as a possible variable, only the path to the track -- and even though I have them all stored as /path/to/album/Folder.jpg, using dirname to extract the folder and adding \"Folder.jpg\" doesn't seem to work.\nThe command I'm trying is notify-send \"%T\" \"%a\\n%b\" -i \"$(dirname %f)/Folder.jpg\", but this doesn't work. If I do similar in a shell window, but explicitly put path/to/file.mp3 instead of %f it works - I assume this is because of how the %f variable is being expanded; but no permutation of double and single quotes around various parts seems to work properly.\nIs there any way of restoring the old behaviour, or getting the new command to work with finding the album art at least?\nEDIT: From a little bit of testing, it seems that the notification box could be being generated by something along the lines of notify-send -t 0 - a zero timeout seems to send a box like this by default (cf. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NotifyOSD#org.freedesktop.Notifications.Notify). I don't really know why this would happen starting with 13.10, but if anyone knows a way of taking this out of Audacious (short of changing source code and recompiling) I'd love to hear it; or maybe this would belong better as a bug report?\n\nA: Recent versions of Audacious added the \"Pause\" and \"Next\" button to the notification.  The problem is, for some odd reason, Unity will display any notification that has buttons as a message box, like you are seeing.  There is a setting you can change in Audacious to hide the buttons and get the old notification style back.

The passwords will not match and the program exits with an appropriate error message.\n(You can't use signals to quit, because passwd ignores every signal. Except SIGKILL should work, but it is unnecessary and maybe insecure to use here.)\n\nA: \nBased on that response, I have an indication that my root has no password. \n\nNo. Since your admin is the one changing the password the current password is not asked. Otherwise changing a password for an account would require asking the user for his/her password. \nCheck /etc/shadow. Those files tell you if a user has a password and what encryption is used. \nThe colums in /etc/shadow are :-seperated and indicate: \n\n\n*\n\n*User name : It is your login name\n\n*Password: It your encrypted password.

I've probably put 14 hours into solving this problem.\nWhen I use the suspend option on my computer, it breaks the operating system. The OS suspends as it normally should (dark screen, blinking power light, etc.) but it does not wake up properly. When I try to wake it up, the backlight turns on and the fan starts and everything but the screen is black. I've tried different key combinations (CTRL+ALT+F2 for example), putting in USB drives, pressing the power button, but none of it will turn the screen bright. The screen stays frozen black and the computer is running as if it were awake (fan whizzing and stuff). \nI am forced to hard restart the system every time I choose the suspend option. \nHibernate is similar. When I type \nsudo pm-hibernate\n\nThe computer will go dark, but will not power down. If I move the mouse it will turn back on to a black screen with a blinking cursor. CTRL+ALT+F2 will go to a terminal window, but upon typing anything in the terminal window will freeze. \nI've tried a number of ideas including\nall of them here: Ubuntu freezes/crash after wake when upgraded to 13.10 \nand here: http://wafflesatnoon.com/2012/11/17/ubuntu-suspend-wont-wake-up-my-quest/\nHelp?\nUbuntu 13.10 on a HP Pavilion g6-2235us\nTrinity [Radeon HD 7520G] video driver\n\nA: The same thing happens to me. I have researched that it was a driver problem. I can't do anything to get out of suspend or hibernate without force-restarting cinnamon (In my case, I have Linux Mint 17 cinnamon on an HP Pavilion g6 with AMD Trinity driver) by doing Ctrl+Alt+Backspace several times. THEN when that works, GRUB appears after a long wait, then everything works fine when you load Linux again. I have also heard Ctrl+Alt+F1 then Ctrl+Alt+F7 while suspended should work, though I have never tried it.

It shows up as a 8MB drive in fdisk:\nDisk /dev/sda: 8 MB, 8388608 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 1 cylinders, total 16384 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x00000000\n\nDisk /dev/sda doesn't contain a valid partition table\n\nPretty much everything on there is backed up, but I would like to create an image just to be on the save side. dd seems to only see the 8MB drive:\ndd if=/dev/sda of=/home/ubuntu/data/sda.img conv=sync,noerror bs=64K count=160G\n128+0 records in\n128+0 records out\n8388608 bytes (8,4 MB) copied, 0,20943 s, 40,1 MB/s\n\nHow can I create an image of the full 160G drive and how do I fix the drive to use it again?\nPS: I have read all sorts of Wikis etc. (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DataRecovery) but none of them seems to deal with the kind of issue I have here. \n\nA: There was a bug in some intel SSD's firmware which caused this problem. This bug was corrected a while ago but you likely didn't upgraded the firmware to the newer one.\nRead about the bug and the new firmware here https://communities.intel.com/thread/24205\nUnfortunately your data cannot be recovered, but your drive could be made usable again:\n\nWhat should I do if I have already experienced this issue?\nIf you have already experienced a drive failure or encounter this problem before the firmware update was released, please contact your Intel representative or Intel customer support (via web:  www.intel.com or phone: www.intel.com/p/en_US/support/contact/phone) for an SSD replacement.  An alternative option is to use the Intel ® SSD Toolbox or similar tools to perform a secure erase in order to restore the SSD to an operational state;  all data will be erased.  After secure erase, update your SSD with the new firmware.  The firmware update will not recover user data.  \n\nTo solve this using linux: (Source and this)\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot up a live environment\n\n*sudo apt-get install hdparm\n\n*sudo hdparm -I /dev/sdX\nwhere sdX is your SSD device. This command will just print out some info about the drive. If you see in the output this: Serial Number: BAD_CTX 00000150 that confirms that you are hit by this bug. If at the Seucrity section it reads frozen you can't continue, you have to use a workaround to eliminate the freeze:\n\nIf the command output shows \"frozen\" one cannot continue to the next step. Some BIOSes block the ATA Secure Erase command by issuing a \"SECURITY FREEZE\" command to \"freeze\" the drive before booting an operating system.\nA possible solution is to simply suspend the system. Upon waking up, it is likely that the freeze will be lifts. If unsuccessful, one can try hot-(re)plug the data cable (which might crash the kernel). If hot-(re)plugging the SATA data cable crashes the kernel try letting the operating system fully boot up, then quickly hot-(re)plug both the SATA power and data cables. \n\n\n*sudo hdparm --user-master u --security-set-pass SOMEPASS /dev/sdX\nAgain /dev/sdX is your SSD drive, and SOMEPASS is a password you want to set for the SSD. (This password doesn't lock the SSD or anything similar, it is just needed for these low-level dealing with the SSD.) We will need that SOMEPASS later on, so remember it/write it down. (But after the secure erase this password will be reset anyway so it is not important in the longterm.)\n\n*Check the drive again: sudo hdparm -I /dev/sdX\nNow it should say enabled and not frozen  at the security section:\nSecurity: \n    Master password revision code = 65534\n            supported\n            enabled\n    not     locked\n    not     frozen\n    not     expired: security count\n            supported: enhanced erase\n    Security level high\n    2min for SECURITY ERASE UNIT. 2min for ENHANCED SECURITY ERASE UNIT.\n\n\n*sudo hdparm --user-master u --security-erase SOMEPASS /dev/sdX\nThis issues the secure erase command. Again /dev/sdX is your SSD, SOMEPASS is the password set before. The completion of this operation can take a few minutes. After this your SSD should be functional, if not, try again with this command:\nsudo hdparm –user-master u –security-erase-enhanced SOMEPASS /dev/sdX\nThis latter command takes much more time (30-40 minutes) and you will have to reset the password (with step 4.) before running it because SOMEPASS is likely already reset by the previous command.\n\n*After this check the drive again sudo hdparm -I /dev/sdX . The BAD_CTX thing should be gone and your drive should be functional.\n\n*After all this don't forget to update the firmware of our SSD.

It happened when the dvips swallowed some \".eps\" figure. \n(Otherwise, try to add a small example file --- so that people can check). \n\nA: Thanks, but that's not it, gsfonts-other is installed, and gv can display the fonts. It is also not just a warning, the symbols are really missing.  E.g. when I use the Symbol font, the characters are in the .eps when I directly look at it with .eps, but not in the final .eps when I feed the very same file into a .tex document and go through dvips.  When I look at the intermediate .dvi with xdvi, the syms are there, but as soon as I dvips them, I get aforementioned error message and the syms are gone in the .ps, so I guess it must be an issue with dvips.\nThoughts much appreciated :)\n\nA: The \"official\" dvips home page http://www.radicaleye.com/dvips.html says\nthat for error messages or core dumps, use option -j0 to work around some\nissues with current versions of dvips until it gets fixed someday.  I have\nno idea what this option does, but it worked for me to get latex to work\nright with imported eps files that have timesroman and helvetica fonts;\nthese same eps files used to work fine for many years on older versions of\ndvips, but now don't work with current versions.  Using the -j0 option,\nI still get the error messages, but the output of dvips now comes out\ncorrect with no missing characters or symbols.  So give it a shot.\n", "Q: Audio card in ubuntu 13.10 has lots of noise when a sound is being played It's not enjoyable to listen to music anymore, of course for me and everyone like me that has the same problem.  \nWhen I play a music it has lots of noise, the real track has no problem though.  \nThis is the output of my sound info:  \ncat /proc/asound/cards\n 0 [Intel          ]: HDA-Intel - HDA Intel\n                      HDA Intel at 0xfe9f8000 irq 43\n\nWhat should I do?

It will scan the network for about 30 seconds and then a small error window pops up saying \"Network disconnected, You are now offline\".  \nI have been trying to fix the issue for almost 3 days now; I even re-installed Ubuntu from my bootable USB.  This was a scratch install of Ubuntu 12.04 LTS via a bootable usb (which was created on my Macbook pro after I converted the .iso to a .img file) on a new computer that I just recently built.  I already contacted my school's IT department, and my MAC address is registered with them.  However, I am the only student running linux on the entire campus and they are unable to give me further support.  I have researched the forums extensively and have tried various solutions, but none seem to work.  I was advised by the IT department to leave my internet connection for IPv4 on automatic DHCP, rather than setting it to manual and copying the information from my laptop.

I have set up a restricted user, who should not be able to use the microphone. The restricted user should, however be able to have sound output. \nIs there a way of reliably disabling the microphone for a restricted user?\n\nA: After experimenting a lot this seems to be the solution:\nsudo setfacl -m u:user:- /dev/snd/pcmC0D0c \n\nOn my computer, /dev/snd/pcmC0D0c is the microphone. Blocking write access for a specific user seems to forbid capturing. \nWith the above command, I reduce the rights for the user \"user\" to --- (check with getfacl /dev/snd/pcmC0D0c), which does not allow for capturing sound. \nHint: for finding microphones in /dev/snd/ the c for capturing at the end of the name may be an indicator. \nNOTE: As all changes made to /dev/ will be lost at reboot, as these files are placed in RAM, you would have to additionally add the above command (without sudo as /etc/rc.local is executed with root rights at boot) to /etc/rc.local before the \"exit 0\" line.\n", "Q: Getting error running sudo apt-get -f install E: Waited for /usr/sbin/dpkg-preconfigure --apt || true but it wasn't there\nE: Failure running script /usr/sbin/dpkg-preconfigure --apt || true \n\nI know this question has been asked before but the answer given returns an error. \nUbuntu version 10.04.3\n$ sudo sh -c \"echo 'DPkg::Pre-Install-Pkgs {\"/usr/sbin/dpkg-pr econfigure --apt || true\";};' >> /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/70debconf\" \neconfigure: 1: Syntax error: Unterminated quoted string\nsh: true;};' >> /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/70debconf: not found\n\n\nA: Use\necho 'DPkg::Pre-Install-Pkgs {\"/usr/sbin/dpkg-preconfigure --apt || true\";};' | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/70debconf\n\ninstead of \nsudo sh -c \"echo 'DPkg::Pre-Install-Pkgs {\"/usr/sbin/dpkg-pr econfigure --apt || true\";};' >> /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/70debconf\" \n\n", "Q: SSD slows down six months after install Have a Samsung 840 SSD in a Thinkpad R60i running Xubuntu 13.04 /w 3GB usable RAM.

In any event, it seems to me like there is a data bottleneck somewhere.  So, check to see that you have sufficient internet speeds for your video quality (try scaling it back from 1080p as most internet connections are too slow, and will cause a \"pixel\" image accompanied with distorted audio), or it could be the audio card on your motherboard is not compatible with the new flash player audio output.  However, the latter is less likely. If i was you, I would check my hardware to make sure the speed is sufficient for the video quality, and if you are using an older computer, try setting the video settings to the lowest possible quality.  Let me know if it helps at all.\n", "Q: How do I use a PlayStation 3 Sixaxis controller with Ubuntu to control games How do I use a PlayStation 3 controller with Ubuntu?\n\nA: There is nothing to install anymore on recent versions of Ubuntu, as Dualshock 3 (and 4 I believe) is natively supported by the Kernel, in both USB and Bluetooth.\nUSB Usage\nIf you want to use it also via Bluetooth, prefer to make the Bluetooth setup first.\nConnecting the controller via USB just works™ out of the box. The main drawback is that the controller remains paired with your PlayStation, so when you disconnect the controller, it turns on the PlayStation. Remember to turn it off.\nTo avoid this, you need to pair the controller via Bluetooth.\nBluetooth usage\nFirst connection\n\n*\n\n*If you controller is connected over USB, disconnect it first.\n\n*Open Bluetooth settings in the Gnome Control Center\n\n*Ensure Bluetooth is enabled, and keep that window open\n\n*Connect the controller via USB\n\n*Accept the confirmation dialog that opens:\n\n\n*Disconnect the USB cable\n\nFrom now on, you just have to press the PlayStation button to connect it via Bluetooth to your PC.\nNote that this will dissociate the controller from your PlayStation (otherwise it would still turn it on when you press the PlayStation button). If you want to re-associate it, you will need to connect it via cable first, like you did with your PC.\nTurning off the controller\nThere are 2 options to turn off the controller:\n\n*\n\n*Hold the PlayStation button for 10 seconds; or\n\n*Go to the Bluetooth settings, select your device, and disconnect it with the toggle.\n\n\nA: You are able to connect the controller to the pc via usb cable. This is supplied with a PS3 device (it is the primary way to charge the controller). I don't know how to connect the controller via bluetooth to your computer (if you even have a bluetooth receiver), so this answer focusses on usb connection. It might be that the controller already works if you do this (You can test this with jstest-gtk as listed below). I use another similar PnP controller, and it works without difficulty. \nif it does not work automatically, this link might answer your question. In summary:\n\n\n*\n\n*install xboxdrv from the Ubuntu Software Center or with sudo apt-get install xboxdrv\n\n*start xboxdrv with sudo xboxdrv --detach-kernel-driver\n\n*If you press the Playstation button, the computer will receive its input and simulate it as an Xbox 360 controller, which should work the same as the playstation controller.\n\n\nYou can test the functionality of your controller through Jstest-gtk (install: sudo apt-get install jstest-gtk)\nGood luck, let me know if it works.\n\nA: You should use sixad/QtSixA http://qtsixa.sourceforge.net/ . Just install from the repo and pair with sixpair while the sixaxis is connected with usb, and then connect with Bluetooth by pressing the PS button.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:falk-t-j/qtsixa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install qtsixa\n\nConnect with USB\nsixpair\n\nDisconnect sixaxis from USB\nsixad -s\n\npress PS button to connect over bluetooth\n\nA: Sorry to be that guy but compiling from source worked for me and the PPA has been pretty quiet for a while now (not weird at all considering the GitHub hasn't been updated in 4 years and the \"final\" version was released around the same time), so don't hold your breath for a xenial package.\nThe excellent guide I linked gives you a few commands to download all prereqs and compile but I will summarize here:\nsudo apt-get update &&\n  sudo apt-get install git dialog build-essential pyqt4-dev-tools libusb-dev libjack-dev libbluetooth-dev python-dbus checkinstall -y &&\n  git clone https://github.com/falkTX/qtsixa.git && \n  cd qtsixa &&\n  make &&\n  sudo checkinstall\n\n\nA: On Ubuntu 15.10/16.04 and Linux Mint 18, you can still use the QtSixA PPA, but specifying \"vivid\" as the Ubuntu version (15.04), since that was the last officially supported version. To do so, execute the following:\nsudo add-apt-repository \"deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/falk-t-j/qtsixa/ubuntu vivid main\"\nsudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 736E4F0B\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install sixad\n\nNote: as far as I can tell, the GUI based application is no longer useful, at least to detect and connect controllers through Bluetooth. Because of that, you need to use the command line-based applications, i.e. sixad and sixpair\nEdit: Apparently and according to my tests, sixad automatically starts at the boot, but doesn't work at all when that happens, having to stop it an re-start it to make it to work. To prevent sixad from being started at the boot, you have to execute:\nsudo systemctl disable sixad\n\nand, when you're going to use it, execute:\nsudo sixad -s\n\nof course, all the above is because QTSixA is no longer supported. The PS3 and PS4 controllers are supposed to work natively in Linux, but I still prefer to use it instead of the native support. I haven't been able to connect my PS3 controllers natively, and when I use QTSixA, I can do other things like specify the Bluetooth MAC address to be paired with.\nI think I will mail the developer to know if it's possible for him to resume the support. I believe that only applying small modifications, the project could work properly out-of-the-box. And, even without doing anything, the PPA could still work.\n\nA: PPA won't work on Ubuntu Xenial derivates but there is a solution. If you have Ubuntu 16.04 and would like to use qtsixa, you can use these commands to trick the PPA into thinking that you’re running 15.10:\nsudo cp /etc/lsb-release /etc/lsb-release.backup\nsudo gedit /etc/lsb-release\n\nChange the following lines to the values below:\nDISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu\n\nDISTRIB_RELEASE=15.10\n\nDISTRIB_CODENAME=wily\n\nDISTRIB_DESCRIPTION=\"Trusty Tahr\"\n\nand save.\nNow install the PPA for qtsixa. Then copy the original lsb-release file back to were it was.\nsudo cp /etc/lsb-release.backup /etc/lsb-release\n\nNow you can reboot.\nsudo reboot\n\nUseful for using Intel Graphics Installer for Linux™ too, tested in Linux Mint 18 thanks to this post.\n", "Q: how do I config a Foscam FI9821W IP camera on Firefox I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 and Firefox. I've got a Foscam FI9821W IP camera and I'm trying to get live video on Firefox. Then I want to add to zoneminder. I opened the IPCam Client page and downloaded and installed the plugin as prompted, hit \"login\" and there was the next page of the IPCam Client. No live video, like the Foscam users manual said. Is there something wrong with the plugin? I've been reading online that Foscam doesn't really support Linux, like they claim. I managed to add the camera to zoneminder, but the IP address is red and not orange like it should be. Which means it's not working. Has anyone had experience with Foscam HD cameras? Can someone help me?\n\nA: Install the Foscam Client with Wine. With that you can configure the cam.\nThen use vlc to view the video\nrtsp://[username]:[password]@[IP-of-the-cam]:443/videoMain\nwith the client tool you can control the position and vlc is your view.\n\nA: It is possible to use the cam with zoneminder but I do not recommend, it's a hell of a job to find out the settings and it will not always connect.\nSince the latest version of firefox server push doesn't work anymore.\nTo see a streaming video you have to use Google Chrome browser.\n\nA: I have found Zoneminder to be a power hog so I don't use it. I have not had any luck using VLC. Foscam requires a plugin which sometimes works with Wine+Firefox+myfoscam.com. I have never been able to use myfoscam.com in Ubuntu+Firefox. \nI have had success using Ubuntu+Chrome+MyIpCam-apt from the Chrome store.

The context\nI wanted to audit my installed packages. I created a Python helper invoking dpkg-query, to create a packages database using Python dictionary and lists. The helper is smart enough to check dependencies are indeed present in the dictionary cloning the installed packages database. I get an error with the wings3d package: the helper notified me a package named erlang-abi-13.a is missing. Synaptic tells me this package is not installed. It still list this package as a wings3d dependency, but displays it in dependency, using italic instead of regular font.\nThe question(s)\nWhat does it mean when Synaptic displays a dependency using italic? How a dependency may be missing while the package seems not to be broken?\n\nA: All packages starting with erlang-abi, are virtual packages. This will be apparent from the apt-cache output:\napt-cache show erlang-abi-15.b\nN: Can't select versions from package 'erlang-abi-15.b' as it is purely virtual\nN: No packages found\nYour helper is not accounting for virtual packages so it fails. This is also why Synaptic shows the packages with italics.\n\nA: Do \napt-cache depends erlang-abi-13.a # see what depends upon it\n\nand \napt-cache rdepends erlang-abi-13.a # see what it depends upon\n\nThen do the same of wings3d. to see if erlang-abi-13.a is listed.\nPackages and requirements can get a bit mixed up when you do a Distribution updates. That might be the cause of this.\n", "Q: Any reason to NOT install both bootloader and Ubuntu to external HDD? I currently have a dual boot arrangement on my primary (internal) HDD which includes Win7 and Ubuntu. I've also procured a 500 GB external USB HDD and was thinking of installing one or more distros on it. \n\n\n*\n\n*Would it behoove me to also install Grub to the external drive and\nthen use my boot order option at machine startup to select the\nexternal HDD at a time of my choosing?\n\n*It seems like adding multiple distros to a single bootloader on the\ninternal drive could have some disadvantages should my internal drive\nfail?\n\n*I suppose a usb stick drive would still be an option as a bailout\nplan but a fully operational and bootable install would seem even\nbetter. Is this sound logic or are there disadvantages to that plan I\nhaven't considered?\n\n\nA: It doesnt sound logic to me because the whole point of grub is to load different OS from a drive at boot up.\nIf you have an external drive just make it bootable.

I am unable to left click on the desktop and do anything like I used to. Any ideas of why it is all of a sudden hiding my desktop icons and folders? And how I can have the show back up, and to activate my left click on the desktop.\n\nA: It would seem that the issue you're having is that the file manager that runs your desktop, typically Nautilus, has crashed. I'm not sure why it's doing that repeatedly for you, but I'm sure in one of the next releases, the issue will be resolved. That's usually how things work.\nI'm assuming that you are still able to access the Unity Dash and/or applications menu. If you happen to be using Nautilus as the desktop manager (which is the default in Ubuntu Unity), usually just opening your home folder will start Nautilus and it will say to itself \"oh hey, I need to fill the desktop with the files in ~/Desktop\" and will correct itself.\nLike I said, I'm not sure why you're having this issue repeatedly, nor why the application crash dialog isn't coming up, but I'd say keep up to date on software updates and Ubuntu releases, and the problem should be solved eventually.\n", "Q: Applying proxy button is not shown In my system whenever I try to apply proxy I never see \n\"Apply proxy system wide\" button\nI have seen this problem on some other ubuntu systems too!\nWhat should I do? ?\nHow do I apply proxy system wide?\n\nA: This is normal.

I would really appreciate any help!\n\nA: You said that you made a 70GB partition in windows. Did you format it to ext4 or ext3 before continuing to install ubuntu. That could be the problem. Partitions made from windows get formatted into FAT or NFTS. Windows doesn't give you an option for formatting them into linux filesystems.\nDon't worry if that's the problem then it's solvable. Read below.\nWarning: If you are not careful when following below steps then they can harm your data in hard drive. So proceed with a little caution. I suggest you backup your important files.\nWhen you try to install Ubuntu through a Live CD or a USB simply choose all the specifications normally and when you come across a option\nwhere it asks for installation type, choose something else and click continue and then in the partition table it gives you, select the partition you want to use for Ubuntu installation and format it to ext4 or ext3(whichever you find preferably) and partition type as \"Primary\" by using the options given there. Click image link given below to see and get base idea.\n\nAnd then don't forget to select the Mount point as root ( / ) for installation and press Ok.

Even if disabled, the USB devices work under the Windows environment. \n\nHow can I achieve this on the R31?\n\nA: The BIOS of the R31 doesn't support booting from an USB pendrive/HDD. You can check it here.\nThe R31 can't boot from USB pendrive/HDD/CD but it can boot from an USB FDD. There is a minimal chance that you have an USB FDD lying at home, but if you have, use that one to make a bootable FDD containing a boot manager (GRUB or plop as it is mentioned more for this method.) and configure the boot manager to boot the USB drive. \nThat page also suggests that you laptop has an internal FDD so if it is working you can use that one the same way.\nIf you don't have an FDD drive I think you shouldn't buy one, as buying a new optical drive for your laptop would be likely cheaper anyway.\nYou may also try booting from network as your laptop supports it.

I'm not sure exactly what these are, but I assume that you want them to be the same.  Mine are very different, with the \"From sRGB\" looking about right and the \"To sRGB\" looking very dull and wrong.\nI have a monitor that has been calibrated with the i1 Display Pro and dispcalgui.  Why are these images so wrong?\nI also notice that if I load a picture into Gimp and select to use the system color profile under color management, that is looks dull and incorrect (like \"From sRGB\" above).  If I turn off the color management in Gimp, it looks more correct (like \"To sRGB\").  I don't know if these are related, but I'm thinking that they probably are.\n\nA: My understanding is that you see differences, because the ICC profile you checked, is a correction profile. I use one I found on the Net, to fix my poorly calibrated DELL Inspiron LCD screen. Without it, I have issue with unnoticeable contrast. As the profile correct/fix the colors, the to/from sRGB tabs, shows different results.\nThe sRGB profile, is more and more the default profile, that is, it is assumed to be the profile of most of machines (computers, smart‑phone, etc) and even the default profile for images without a profile specified (and if the profile specified is sRGB, then no color correction should be applied before rendering to the screen which is supposed to be sRGB).\nAs output to screen is supposed to be to sRGB (hence, no RGB correction if it also is from sRGB), if instead of any profile, you open an sRGB profile, you will most likely see no or very little differences in both pictures.\nYou may check it downloading the profile provided here: sRGB Appearance profile (color.org). If you open-it with the color profile installer (don't worry, it will not install it unless you ask it to), click the “Show details” button then go to the to/from sRGB tabs, you will see both images are near to be the same (I can only see little differences on the water on the left).\nIn short, unless the profile you are inspecting, is a version of an sRGB profile (there are multiple versions), you will see a difference.\n", "Q: Will this backup the partition contents of both linux and windows? The partition table of my /sda disk got corrupted. I don't know the details of what happened exactly, but I can still read the disk, and boot into Linux, but not into Windows 8 anymore. I'm quite new to Linux and this doesn't seem to be easy to fix, so I decided to just backup my data to another disk, format the /sda disk, and put the data back.\n/sda contains:   \n/sda2 which is Win8 *NTFS*  \n/sda3 is an extended partition containing:   \n    /sda5 which is Linux / (filesystem root) *EXT4*   \n    /sda6 which is swap.\n\n/sdb is a one partition NTFS disk containing no OS, and only data.\n/sdc5, a partition on my third disk, contains /home. EXT4\nHere is how I was planning to backup my data:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Boot Linux from USB,  \n\n*Use sudo cp -afv to copy /sda5 contents to a folder on /sdc5,  \n\n*Use sudo cp -afv to copy /sda2 contents to a folder on the /sdb disk.\n\n\nFormat the /sda disk, partition it the same way again, and copy the data back using the same sudo cp -afv command (all from a Linux Live USB).\nSo my big question is, will all this work?\nDetails regarding my partition problem in case you're interested.\n\nA: I would recommend to do an image of your disk. If you are able to access your partitions with Nautilus better do that. Again, you may want to repair Windows boot instead of messing with your partitions.\n\nA: You may not need to backup and restore at all. testdisk is an amazing utility that can fix partition table errors. You can install it with:\nsudo apt-get install testdisk\n\nThen run \nsudo testdisk\n\nAnd go from there. There's an excellent guide about testdisk here. I've used this utility many times when windows screwed up my partition table.\nKeep messing with those partition types until you eventually figure out the right combination. It's a bit tricky. Try the deep scan too. Pay attention to partition types and sizes for clues. There may be some false positives for partitions in the scan.\n", "Q: wine nsf screen resolution I play NFS with Wine in Kubuntu. \nAs usual, NFS changed my screen resolution to low, but after it finished, it didn't restore the screen to normal resolution. \nI found some code to restore the resolution, but I have to restart the system. \nIs there any other solution without restarting?\n\nA: Previously I got similar problem with NVidia proprietary driver.

I created Ubuntu server in VirtualBox and created additional user. Than locked it with passwd -l user. Then when I try to ssh that user, it keeps asking for password, but even if I input password, that was there before locking, it appears it isn't valid.\nI'm new to Ubuntu so I'm a bit confused here.\n\nA: A locked password doesn't mean the system won't ask for a password. It will ask for a password but it is impossible to give a correct password and login. That's how it works. If you unlock the password the old password will be reset.\nFrom man passwd:\n   -l, --lock\n       Lock the password of the named account. This option disables a password by changing it to a value which matches no possible encrypted value (it\n       adds a ´!´ at the beginning of the password).\n\n       Note that this does not disable the account. The user may still be able to login using another authentication token (e.g. an SSH key). To\n       disable the account, administrators should use usermod --expiredate 1 (this set the account's expire date to Jan 2, 1970).\n\n   -u, --unlock\n       Unlock the password of the named account.

To be precise, it's two modules.\n  Bulldozer uses modules, and each module consists of one FP scheduler\n  and 2 int schedulers. \nThis is AMD's answer to \"hyperthreading\" - it's cheaper to\n  manufacture, can potentially result in faster overall performance at a\n  marginal manufacturing cost, and it lets them get away with selling\n  crappy cpus to people who don't understand or read benchmarks/reviews\n  etc. \nIn the end, Bulldozer was a flop. The per-core performance is what\n  matters and it loses to Intel by a significant margin.  Even when all\n  core are loaded, Bulldozer doesn't compare very well to Intel, but can\n  pull ahead ever so slightly in some highly-threaded apps. \nFinally, hyperthreading doesn't need to be enabled on the modern CPUs\n  that do support it (yours does not).\n\n", "Q: Blocking specific MAC address from contacting me Could I block a specific MAC address on my LAN from contacting me?\nI know I could do it from router or switch.\nBut I wanna learn if it is possible in Ubuntu(Linux) commands.\n\nA: You can drop from a source MAC address, yeah:\nsudo iptables -A INPUT -m mac --mac-source 00:00:00:00:00:AA -j DROP\n\nObviously, you'll need to change that address.\nIf you want to make that permanent, make sure ufw is installed and then edit /etc/ufw/before.rules to have something like this before the COMMIT:\n-A ufw-before-input -m mac --mac-source 00:00:00:00:00:AA -j DROP\n\n", "Q: setting up remote access to VPS where Wine runs; is window manager needed? I have a VPS running Ubuntu 12.04. My purpose is to let a windows application run under Wine, around the clock, 24/7. It consists of two .exe's, both have to open their GUIs to run. From time to time I would like to have look on them, by connecting to VPS from my Windows laptop. I do not mind launching applications in Wine conncting with SSH and using command line; but I do need seeing their GUIs afterwards. \nKnowing that, what do you think is an appropriate way to run Wine (using it's own window manager or Ubuntu's one) and arranging remote access (VNC? something else?)? \n\nA: Wine expects the DISPLAY variable to be set to a working X display. That's not a massive problem and there are a lot of solutions here.\nI would personally look at starting an Xvfb display and then run your applications under that DISPLAY variable, including a VNC server.\nsudo apt-get install xvfb wine x11vnc\nXvfb :99 &\nDISPLAY=:99 wine regedit &\nx11vnc -display :99 -forever\n\nA few notes:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can tweak the Xvfb for geometry and colours.\n\n*You could have a separate X/VNC server for each application.\n\n*You can take screenshots of an X server with:\nDISPLAY=:99 import -window root screenshot.png\n\n\n*For production, you'll probably want an Upstart job making sure the X server stays up. You could do the same for the Wine applications.\n\n*None of this is secure. Don't use that in production without a firewall. I'd probably suggest limiting VNC to SSH access (tunnel the port back over SSH) if you're putting this anywhere near the internet.\n\n", "Q: how can I increase my RAM size with a swap partition? Presently my RAM is 2GB. I heard that in linux we can get extra memory to RAM from the harddisk by using swap partition. What is the procedure for that?\n here in the pics i'm giving my system info.\n\n\nA: In a default Ubuntu installation you will always have a swap partition which will be created by the installer. In your setup it is the partition /sda5 but this location may change from system to system.\nThis partition will obviously not be able to increase the physical RAM but it is storage memory on your hard disk reserved for the kernel to use whenever we run short of physical RAM. This may never happen on a system with 2 GB of RAM unless we perform very memory demanding tasks (e.g. \nvideo processing, huge image processing) or have many applications running simultaneously.\nNote that memory usage on swap is extremely slow, so we do not really want to have that other than in emergency situations.\nIn case you need a larger swap you can do so after installation either by creating a larger swap partition:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I add a swap partition after system installation?\nor by adding a swap on a file (which can not be used for hibernation):\n\n\n*\n\n*Adding a new swap file. How to edit fstab to enable swap after reboot?\nMore about swap can also be found here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why is swap being used even though I have plenty of free RAM?\n\n*How do I configure swappiness?\n\n*I have 16GB RAM. Do I need 32GB swap?\n\nA: You've piece of (hardware) RAM of 2GB and you can't 'create' more RAM with software. But I think I know what you've heard of.\nFrom Linux.com\n\nWhen the system requires more memory than is physically available, the kernel swaps out less used pages and gives memory to the current application (process) that needs the memory immediately. \n\nSo when you have a SWAP space that is twice as big as your memory (in your case a swap space of 4 GB) your system will be able to putt the entire memory on swap space, and read the other 2 GB in on the memory. In other words, it is able to swap the entire content of your memory with the 2GB data on the swap disk.\n", "Q: wifi issue with ubuntu 13.10 and lenovo ideapad s405 I installed Ubuntu 13.10 on my laptop lenovo ideapad s405.

Download either 32- or 64-bit, depending on your version of Ubuntu (run uname -a at the command line, and look for either i386 (32-bit) or x86_64 (64-bit) in the output), then at the command line navigate to where you downloaded it and run\nsudo dpkg -i sublime-text_build-XXXX_YYYY.deb\n\nwhere XXXX is the build number (currently 3059) and YYYY is either i386 or amd64. This will automatically install Sublime Text in /opt/sublime-text, create a /usr/bin/subl command, and automatically create /usr/share/applications/sublime_text.desktop along with the associated icons. It should also create a launcher in your Unity taskbar.\nSublime Text 3 is the future of the editor, and every day more and more plugins and extensions are released or revised on Package Control that are compatible with ST3. If you purchase a license, which is required for long-term use after evaluation, you will also have access to the bleeding edge development releases which are released more frequently than the public beta versions and so are more up-to-date as far as new features and bug fixes are concerned. Sublime Text 2 is basically a finished product as far as development is concerned, and while it is quite stable for most people, many plugins do not work with it, especially those under active development that depend on some of the advanced features that ST3 provides.\nIt's worth noting that ST2 and ST3 can coexist peacefully on the same system, as the plugins and data are stored separately. You obviously can't have two subl commands, but you can rename one of them subl2 or subl3, for example.\n\nIf you still need to create a .desktop file for ST2, its contents should be as follows. Please note that it assumes you moved the Sublime Text 2 directory from where you unpacked it to /opt/sublime_text_2.

However, if I specify a second destination (same database but different table) with a seperate log command that uses a different filter to identify the traffic I want in that table, logging does not work.\nI assumed it was to do with threading so I enabled threading but still see the same. \nI am using Ubuntu 13.04 raring and version 3.5.3 of syslog-ng OSE.\nAnyone else seen this problem?\nThanks\nPete\nThanks for the reply Tom.  The relevant sections of the syslog-ng.conf file are below.  I have put on both the destination and log for each table that I want data in.  At the moment, this is a test so the parsers are the same but I am trying to split out the traffic as the parsers will be different.\nWhat I find is that if I start syslog-ng, sometimes I get data being sent to one of the database tables but not the other, or neither gets data sent.  I've run a SQL profile and the insert statement is not seen so its not a SQL issue.\nOther things that may have an effect, the syslog-ng server is running on Hyper-V but I've allocated 4 logical CPU's to it, but I'm thinking that if each SQL destination uses a seperate thread, Ubuntu might not be handling virtualisation and so not presenting the CPUs to the app.\nYour thoughts on that would be appreciated.  \nRelevant sections of the .conf file below:\noptions { threaded(yes);};\n\nsource s_net { udp(ip(x.x.x.x) port(514) flags(\"syslog-protocol\", \"threaded\"));

You can install LibreCAD from the Ubuntu Software Center. Using one of these two programs you import DWG files, edit the drawing and export it to PDF.\n\nQCad offered a command line tool to convert DWG to PDF directly - I'm guessing it's also available in LibreCAD.\n./dwg2pdf.sh drawing.dwg\n\n\nA: Best linux-native solution for dwg should be TeighaViewer. Teigha technologies are used by hundreds of companies around the world. Teigha is for dwg what LibreOffice is for office files (doc, xls, etc). Teigha is basically a Design Alliance, a common effort around the world to break the dictatorship of Adsk's dwg. Bricscad, DraftSight, Ares Commander, CorelCAD, Intellicad and many others are members of teigha.\nInkscape can also open .dwg files. But it doesn't always read them right (display errors and scale errors), depending on what app generated the dwg file.\nInkscape deals better with .dxf files, because dxfs can't contain advanced entities, just basic entities like lines, arcs, splines, points and dimensions. \n\nA: I used FreeCad.\nsudo apt install freecad\n\nIf you are using Ubuntu 18.04, you could get the error No module named WebGui. In that case install it from the another repository as follows.  \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:freecad-maintainers/freecad-stable\nsudo apt-get update\n\nAlso, you need to install a third-party plugin ODA File Converter from https://www.opendesign.com/guestfiles/oda_file_converter to support import of DWG formats.\nAnd set the path to the converter executable manually. open Edit → Preferences → Import-Export → DWG and fill \"Path to Teigha File Converter\" appropriately.\nAfter installing the .deb package on Ubuntu, the executable's path is /usr/bin/ODAFileConverter. Looking at the extracted RPM file, it seems to be installed under /usr/local/bin/ODAFileConverter.\n\nA: Lx-viewer do the job since its pretty easy to use and offers what you looking for, you should give it a try\n  \nfor more info check this link\n\nA: Qcad works, of course you have to pay for it. Varicad was a last resource but it crashes reading new files (autocad 2017).Same with Teighaviewer.Lx-viewer do\nes not exist.\n\nA: DWGsee\nis a windows only application to open and view DWG files. It also offers some limited modification capabilities, as described here\nSince quite recently, DWGsee started working quite nicely with wine, allowing us to open, print and plot DWGs in Linux.\nSteps to install DWGsee in Ubuntu/Debian:\nTL;DR\nInstall wine.\nConfigure it for windows 10 emulation.\nRun DWGsee installer and complete installation.\nDone.\nStep by step:\n\n*\n\n*Download DWGsee from their site\n\n*Install wine:\n\n*\n\n*open a terminal and type\n\n*sudo apt install wine\n\n\n\n*configure wine:\n\n*\n\n*open a terminal and type\n\n*winecfg\n\n*this will open wine configurations\n\n*select \"windows 10\" from the drop down menu\n\n*click \"ok\"\n\n\n\n*run DWGsee installer with wine:\n\n*\n\n*open a terminal and type\n\n*cd Downloads\n\n*wine dwgseepro2020.exe\n\n*follow the installer/s steps, until finished\n\n\n\n*All done. You can now open DWGsee from the aplication menu\n\n*Additionaly you can set DWG files to open automatically with DWGsee\n\n*\n\n*right click on any DWG file\n\n*click \"Open with other application\"\n\n*click \"view all applications\"\n\n*look for \"DWGSee MFC Application\", and click on it. This will open DWGSee for that file.\n\n*To make the configuration stick for all dwg files, right click again on the file, and this time click \"properties\", and then the tab \"open with\"\n\n*select \"DWGSee MFC Application\", and that's it.\n\n\n\n\nA: I used in past Draftsight to convert dwg to PDF\nDrafsight its a complete free CAD program that has a export to PDF function. Cross platform but not foss and free with on-line activation for Linux. I didn't used it for a time now but back in time was an amazing piece of software. Consider to read  this guide how to install it.\nMore dwg viewers and software recommendations you can find here on Ask Ubuntu by following software that can view dwg files link\n\nA: Try bricscad, is the best software out there for linux, it has the same features as autocad and more, its much better and low resources.\nhttps://www.bricsys.com\n", "Q: mpdboot and mpdtrace gives Alarm Clock as a result I try to execute\nmpdboot -n 2 -f /home/user/mpd.hosts\n\nand then\nmpdtrace\n\nHowever, both of them return:\nAlarm clock\n\nI have a virtual machine with mpd installed on it.\nI copied the .vdi (the hard drive) to another machine.\n\nA: Finally I found it. This indicated a licence problem.\nThe reason is that I installed Licensed mpd (not free mpd) in my virtual machine.\nThen I copied the virtual machine to another computer.\nThat´s why the mpd can not be used in the new machine. I should update the licence.\n\nA: You should probably try updating your version of MPICH.

I am trying to download a file using the bittorrent protocol but I can't get my browser to open the magnet link in my torrent client. I have qbittorrent installed but I still can't seem to download from magnet links.\nA little box always shows up asking what application I want to use and there is a button that says \"browse\" but I can't choose anything.\nHow can I use such links on Ubuntu?\nAnd when you go to explain, please explain every detail as if you are talking to someone who doesn't know anything about Ubuntu.\n\nA: *\n\n*Click the torrent link to open which should start the Launch Application window where you should check mark the Remember my choice for magnetic links, and click the Choose... button;\n\n\n*Now in the next window that appears you can browse to and select the file /usr/bin/qbittorrent. For this click File System on the side pane and browse through the directories usr -> bin where you'll have to select the executable file qbittorrent to open.\nOr, just click the File System and click the \"edit path\" icon to type a file name manually (or use the shortcut Ctrl + L);\n\n\n*Then in the path input box labelled Location: type the path of the executable of the application - /usr/bin/qbittorrent and click Open;\n\n\n*Having the desired launch application selected, now click the OK button. This will start the application qBittorrent and you can continue managing your download from there.\n\n\nA: So to download Ubuntu from torrent, you can also save the .torrent file to ~/Download for example.\nThen you open your favorite torrent application. Opening torrent from file should be like \"File\" -> \"Open\".\n", "Q: Trouble installing Ubuntu on a secondhand IBM server I recently picked up a secondhand IBM x365, and I want to install Ubuntu on it. I've installed Ubuntu on countless personal computers, but never before on a server. I made my bootable disc (I have a bunch, ranging from Ubuntu Desktop 10.04 up to Ubuntu Server 12.10, in both 32 and 64 bit), put it in my server's CD drive, went to BIOS, configured it to boot to CD-ROM, then the Diskette Drive, then Hard Disk 0, then the Network. Every time I start it up, it skips right over everything without displaying anything on screen, then shows me a graphic of a floppy disk and an indication to press the F1 key.\nI think it's either a bad CD drive or has something to do with the RAID controllers or something. I've never used RAID before, so I wouldn't know what to look for there.\nAnybody have any suggestions for what to try next?\n\nA: I know this is very late, but I had this problem and maybe someone will need it in the future. If you want to use your server like a desktop and you are having problems installing ubuntu with a \"Raid\" type error, you need to take out all of the hard-drives except one and try installing.

I have a flash drive to get software from the Mac to the Ubuntu box if necessary. \nIs there a way to do this?\n\nA: You can bridge the wireless connection to the wired connection on the mac system.\nThen you connect both pcs by an ethernet cable. If at least one system has GbE, you don't need a crossover cable.\nI think it will be much easier to buy an 10€ usb wifi connector.

Menus are still there but you cannot click on them but shortcut strokes still functioning. I checked some of the solutions from internet but none of them worked. Any suggestion or further comment is appreciated?\nHere Is the current state of nautilus window:\n\n\nA: Seems not to be a \"feature\" question, but a \"profile\" topic: when running nautilus as root (sudo nautilus or gksu nautilus in a terminal window), the top bar is back there, but on the root-nautilus session only. If you quit all nautilus (nautilus -q) and run a root-nautilus and then return to \"normal\" nautilus, the top bar is missing again.\n\nA: On another machine I have, the windows are exactly like that in File Manager - nautilusversion 3.10.1. This does not seem to be a problem in versions of Nautilus like 3.8.2.\nThe easiest solution I found was to use Nemo instead - which is the official file manager for Cinnamon, and is based on an earlier release of Nautilus. It is pretty much the same, but works better, still has dual pane etc:\n[ \n\nAnother method would be to downgrade the nautilus package if you still can - there is a guide on that here - you should be able to do this if you run this an find older versions:\napt-cache showpkg packagename\n\nYou can find the current version using\ndpkg -l nautilus\n\nAnd install it with:\nsudo apt-get install PACKAGE=VERSION\n\nYou can get the version from the aboe apt-cache command/\nIf you can't downgrade it, you will probably have to download the deb file from here or somewhere, and manually install it with:\nsudo dpkg -i PACKAGE.deb\n\nAfter doing either method of downgrading it, you will need to lock the version of the package so it is not automatically updated. You can do this with Synaptic:\n  \nOr with this command:\nsudo echo “PACKAGE hold” | sudo dpkg –set-selections\n\nWhere PACKAGE = nautilus.\n", "Q: USB support with VirtualBox This isn't really a question but more like my frustration and criticism -   \nAfter spending countless hours, searching web for answer, there seems to be a lot of confusion about the Virtual Box versions i.e. OSE - PUELand I still don't know which version I am using, I mean i know it is 4.3.6r91406 but which one\nhere is one post here describing steps to install which is exactly what I followed PUEL and 2nd post here saying it is only possible with OSE and 3rd post suggesting different solution altogether here\nI still managed to use USB support with VM, without deleting or installing - I used USB as it is now.\nSo, what is criteria for maintaining these forums and who does it ? or may be I did not use it the way it is meant to be ?! \n\nA: USB support will work without the extension package - but only 1.1\nSeems like they don't want to make the modules for usb 2.0 open source, so they offer it as extension pack.\n", "Q: Certain programs won't open Ubuntu fails to start the following applications:\n\n\n*\n\n*viz\n\n*Skype\n\n*Firefox\n\n*Thunderbird\n\n*Chrome\n\n\nWhen i try opening Mozilla Firefox or Thunderbird it says \"Firefox is alresdy running, but not responding . To open a new window you must first close the exsiting firefox process, restart your system. Also neither of the LIBRE applications run.\n\nA: My first question would be, have you restarted your computer?  This can often correct many issues.  Which version of Ubuntu are you running?  \nNext, try running the System Monitor application (gnome-system-monitor for Unity or GNOME desktops) and look for those processes running in the background.  Sometimes these programs stay running in the background even after you click the X.

So I finish a 1 TB backup which may take a full day or 24 hours (many small files), simply unmounting the drive can take hours or days when it says it is \"writing data to disk\". If I kill it then I get file system errors and have to fix them in windows which takes a while.\nI tried different disks with similar results. It seems that Ubuntu either does not write or just writes poorly and/or causes file-system errors.\nIs it possible to stop this, maybe disable write-back cache or something, just to make sure when I write something to disk, it is written completely without needing to write more when un-mounting. Thank You.\n\nA: Are you using a 64-bit version of Linux with a lot of memory and the attached disk is a relatively slow one (any USB 2 will qualify)? \nIn that case the problem could be that Linux  can locks/delay for long time on big writes on slow devices; it depends on caching too much data during writes.

Thanks :D\n\nA: Ubuntu 10.10 and newer.\nAll of your questions are in this quote (Source): \n\nHow to switch the GPU\nThe kernel shipped in Ubuntu 10.10 supports hybrid graphics by means of the vga_switcheroo flag. See vga_switcheroo below. \nEnabling vga_switcheroo\nvga_switcheroo is the kernel mechanism that allows you to switch\n  between GPUs if your machine has a hardware mux. Note that this method\n  is not supported by all machines and only works if you are using the\n  opensource driver (nouveau, radeon) and not the proprietary ones\n  (nvidia, fglrx).\nTo check whether your kernel is compiled with the proper option you\n  can examine the file config-2.6.nn-mm-generic in the /boot directory:\ngrep -i switcheroo /boot/config-*\n\nThe vga_switcheroo mechanism will only be active when the kernel is\n  booted with either the modeset=1 kernel option, and/or the\n  nomodeset option being absent.\nTo test if vga_switcheroo is enabled, look for the switch file:\nls -l /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch\n\n\n", "Q: Zeal from the PPA has unmet dependences I'm trying to install Zeal through ppa in Ubuntu 13.04, but is giving the error:\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\n zeal : Depends: libqt5core5 (>= 5.0.2) but 5.0.1+dfsg-0ubuntu4.1 is to be installed\n        Depends: libqt5gui5 (>= 5.0.2) but 5.0.1+dfsg-0ubuntu4.1 is to be installed\n        Depends: libqt5network5 (>= 5.0.2) but 5.0.1+dfsg-0ubuntu4.1 is to be installed\n        Depends: libqt5sql5 (>= 5.0.2) but 5.0.1+dfsg-0ubuntu4.1 is to be installed\n        Depends: libqt5widgets5 (>= 5.0.2) but 5.0.1+dfsg-0ubuntu4.1 is to be installed\n        Depends: libqt5xml5 (>= 5.0.2) but 5.0.1+dfsg-0ubuntu4.1 is to be installed\nE: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.\n\nI tried to install qt5-qtwebkit but keeps the same error.

I have used other PPA's also but they failed because of unmet dependencies.\n", "Q: What happens when I install Ubuntu? I have a windows 8 laptop and i am interested in downloading and installing Ubuntu 12.04.3, but what happens next? Can I change back to my old desktop? How do i use Ubuntu?\nPlease I need advice\n\nA: You can dual-boot both operating systems. \nThe general steps are as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*From Windows, shrink the partition Windows uses (it uses the entire disk by default). You want to give yourself enough space for Ubuntu, which doesn't require much compared to Windows. If you shrunk it 100GB, you would be fine for the foreseeable future.\n\n*Download the Ubuntu .iso, and create a bootable flash drive or CD/DVD. There is free software out there to do this.\n\n*Put in the flashdrive or CD/DVD, then turn off your computer.\n\n*Turn the computer back up, stopping the boot process so you can get into BIOS.\n\n*Tell the computer to boot from either flash or the CD/DVD drive, whichever you put Ubuntu on.\n\n*You will be greeted with some options, just go into Live mode.\n\n*You can now mess around and test how things work. Once you're happy, click on Install to Hard Disk (something along those lines) and follow the instructions :)\n\n\nYou now have both Windows and Ubuntu installed on the same computer. When you turn on your computer now, you will be given the GRUB screen where you can choose whether you want to boot into Windows or Ubuntu.\n\nA: I recommend trying WUBI which stands for Windows Ubuntu Installer. It installs Ubuntu just like you would any other Windows software.  \nIf you like or dont like it, you can just uninstall as you would any other software in Windows (Control Panel > Uninstall Software).  If you like it, I would then recommend that you uninstall wubi then do a complete dual boot install.  But this way you can get the feel of things without messing around with Partitions should you not like it, and want to revert to a Windows only system.  \n\nA: I was nervous about Ubuntu -3 months later i have it installed on my SSD and crappy windows on a 1TB HDD when i have to use WIN for my steam games.\nOther than that i havent looked back. Ubuntu is amazing -and so damn fast!\n", "Q: Having trouble with partition while dual booting Ubuntu 13.10 and Windows 7 So I have already made a partition of 100 GB in windows but when I loaded ubuntu 13.10 from a usb stick and tried installing it ubuntu didn't give me the option of installing along side windows. When I clicked something else and then clicked on 100 GB free disk space it still wouldn't let me. This is the first time for me to install a new OS so simple anwers would be the best.\n\nA: 100 GB partition created on Windows should not be an ext4 partition,so you can't install Ubuntu on it.\nTry to format the 100 GB partition into ext4 filesystem.To do this,\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot the Ubuntu live disk.Select the try Ubuntu option on startup.\n\n*Now open Gparted partition Editor from dash.\n\n*Right click on the 100 GB partition and select \"Format to\" option to format it into ext4 filesystem.\n\n*Now run the Ubuntu installer and then choose something else option.This time you can be able to install Ubuntu on that 100 GB partition.\nNote:Make sure that the 100 GB partition is unmounted. \n", "Q: Where can I find the correspondent of \"temp\" folder in Firefox? If I'm right, if I play a video on Youtube, when I'm using Firefox on a Windows machine, the browser stores the video file in the temp folder. So, theoretically, I should find that video already downloaded in the temp. But I don't know how to find in Linux the correspondent of the \"temp\" folder. I have tried in the \"etc\" folder but got nothing useful. Do you have any ideas how to sort this out? \nYesterday I have been playing a video on Youtube all day long, and now I see it's gone \"for copyright infringement, blah-blah\", but I think the played file should be \"hiding\" somewhere on my system, only if I could get to it somehow... Can you help me with this? \n\nA: You can put about:cache in the location bar, it should display where it keeps the \"temp\" folder.\n\nA: I think you mean firefox cache folder not ubuntu temp folder.\nFirefox cache folder is located in ~/.cache/mozilla/firefox/xxxxxxxx.default/cache/\nSimply, go to your home folder and press cntr + h to view hidden files. Then go to the .cache/mozilla/firefox/xxxxxxxx.default/cache/ folder and search for your videos.\nxxxxxxxx is a random string of characters.\n\nA better approach is to install gnome-search-tool via terminal using this command sudo apt-get install gnome-search-tool.\nLaunch it via the dash, its called search for files, choose the firefox cache folder for the look in folder option.\nChoose select more options and in available options choose size at least and set it at about 5Mb, thats about 5120Kb and search. Leave the name contains blank.\nIn the search results you will find all your videos and all you have to do is copy-paste them to another folder.\nAll the best.\n\nA: The temp folder on linux is /tmp/. Most of the linux softwares use it for storing temporary files, firefox does so too. For example when you say Open with ... for a file instead of downloading it firefox stores that file in /tmp/. But this folder is emptied on every reboot (since these are temporary files which shouldn't be kept across reboots) so you won't find the files there after a reboot.\nA few years ago youtube video caches were also saved here, like it is mentioned in this question, but things have changed. You can see what happened in the two most upvoted answers to that question: There was a time when the cached videos were simply moved to another folder, but later they moved it back to /tmp/ but now they unlink the file so the file is not present in the file system but is still accessible with that trcik mentioned in the second most upvoted answer there. This latter method (from the second answer) is still working for most of the flash video websites, but it doesn't work anymore with youtube. Youtube have changed to not cache at all the video (or they cache in RAM, I don't know).\nTo sum up: That file is not on your drive, no need to search for it.\n\nA: I think you are looking for the Firefox temporary files download directory.\nJust try looking into:\n/tmp/mozilla_username\n\nusername = your Linux username\n", "Q: Non-deterministic behaviour in bash script for screen window opening and naming I have the following bash script to set up a screen session with four windows from the command line in 13.10.

The rest of the time I get anywhere between one and four windows,  some of them named correctly, other times with the default, 'bash' name. Why am I seeing this behaviour, and how do I fix it?\nBetween each time I run it I make sure the screen session has ended, by typing exit in each window and checking screen -ls to see that there are no screen sessions active.\nOUTCOME:\nFrom the comment by \"chris\" on this page I now have a project specific dotfile that I invoke from .screenrc using source .projectscreenrc - when the file is present it contains screen -t commands as suggested in glenn jackman's answer. When it is not present screen runs as normal. I'm still not sure why this works and why my original approach didn't, but this is much cleaner.\n\nA: Not answering your question, but this is how I would use screen this way:\nPut this in your ~/.screenrc:\nscreen -t server\nscreen -t vim_1\nscreen -t vim_2\nscreen -t console\n\nEach time you want to enter screen, use screen -DR -- that will create the screen session if it does not exist, or reattach to it if it's running.\n", "Q: Which Desktop Environment has (or can have) global menus (apart from Unity)?

I installed Ubuntu 12.04 and upgraded to Kubuntu 13.10. Works well so far. Then I installed the vmware-tools to get a large screen. Seems to install nicely, no errors or nothing, I rebooted but my screen stays small (640x480). How do I get a larger screen?\n\nA: You have to drag the vm windows corners, or use a display manager that's installed on the os. For example in Ubuntu it's under \"system settings/displays\", in KDE you may need to install randr (sudo apt-get install kde-workspace-randr), and then it's under system settings/displays. When you reboot the screen will start small, but upon login it will return to what-ever size you last had it set to.\n", "Q: Problem in installing Ubuntu on Toshiba Satellite laptop I have a Toshiba Satellite laptop and I have tried to download Xubuntu on it using a software that gives you a virtual flash disk .. because I didn't have one ..\nAfter that, I followed the steps of installing .. . the computer was restarted / I shut it down and turned it on again.

I need a command to list all open ports in my PC, and another command to close a port.\nAny suggestions?\nI need to close some applications' port.\n\nA: You can use iptables to block the port on the network level without having to close the application. The port would still appear open, but will be unreachable.\nalternatively, this is dependent on the application, some permit to disable some port ( think dovecot and the pop3 or imap port ), and some cannot. Some application can also be configured to listen only on localhost or a specific address.\n\nA: You can use netstat -nalp and lsof -i:port tools to identify process/binaries behind open port.\nIf you want to close port you have to kill process or stop relative service.If you want run services only for your local box you can configure respective service to listen on localhost/127.0.0.1 not on all available (0.0.0.0) ips.\n\nA: netstat can be used to see the ports stat.\nsudo netstat -lnp\n\nTo list all Listening ports Numbers with the Process responsible on each one.

The kernel, and everything written in C, is compiled, so the source code is read and translated into machine code. All comments are stripped during this process. So you don't need to worry about any slowdown in comments.\nInterpreted code, in, say, shell or python, could potentially suffer from comment-induced slowdown. But I'm certain it would be negligible.

I see entries describing BTRFS on Ubuntu 12.04 has some concerns due mostly to the maturity of the BTRFS product.  Now that we have 13.10 available, is the BTRFS file system reliable?\n\nA: BTRFS is and will be for the time being in development. This is being shown in the BTRFS FAQ page:\n\nIs btrfs stable?\n\n*\n\n*Short answer: Maybe.\n\n*Long answer: Nobody is going to magically stick a label on the btrfs code and say \"yes, this is now stable and bug-free\". Different people have different concepts of stability: a home user who wants to keep their ripped CDs on it will have a different requirement for stability than a large financial institution running their trading system on it. If you are concerned about stability in commercial production use, you should test btrfs on a testbed system under production workloads to see if it will do what you want of it. In any case, you should join the mailing list (and hang out in IRC) and read through problem reports and follow them to their conclusion to give yourself a good idea of the types of issues that come up, and the degree to which they can be dealt with. Whatever you do, we recommend keeping good, tested, off-system (and off-site) backups.\n\n*Pragmatic answer: (2012-12-19) Many of the developers and testers run btrfs as their primary filesystem for day-to-day usage, or with various forms of \"real\" data. With reliable hardware and up-to-date kernels, we see very few unrecoverable problems showing up. As always, keep backups, test them, and be prepared to use them.\n\nThis also applies to Ubuntu implementation of BTRFS.\n\nA: It is not stable enough for a server in production yet.  From my own experience, the file system gets corrupted at times and this goes as far as the system restarting!\nI had to revert back to ext4 after having 4 1TB SAS drives running on it for two weeks.\nUpdate: It seems my corruption problems stem from a hardware problem, since similar errors appear if I run ext4.\nUpdate: It's pretty stable since kernel 3.17.  I've had many unscheduled shutdowns at a client site and the system recovers properly without any corruption.\n\nA: I have been running btrfs on Kubuntu 14.04 since I moved to Kubuntu 1404 alpha a year ago.  It has been running faultless for me.  I've been using Linux since 1998 and until a year ago EXTx.   I'm staying with btrfs.\nFWIW, Facebook moved its data centers to btrfs last May and is still enthusiastic about it.  They are using 3.19.   Kubuntu 14.04 is using 3.12.\n\nA: btrfs- is \"NOT super stable\" but its supercool though, brtfs file system seems to have performance problems. It takes extra time for booting up when compared to ext4. Especially on low end hardware.\n", "Q: Add resolution mode for xorg-dummy I am trying to to add a resolution mode for X with the xorg-dummy driver to be able to fit the x11vnc server's output to my screen resolution. \nI am running \nx11vnc -xdummy -xrandr\n\nwith the x11vnc Xdummy script in my path. If I don't add a xorg.conf file in /etc/X11 then I get only a bunch of lower resolutions. \nTherefore I added this xorg.conf file\nhttps://www.xpra.org/xorg.conf\nwith which I also have a number of higher resolutions. Among them is 1920x1200 which I need, but rotated by 90 degrees.\nUsing http://www.arachnoid.com/modelines/ , I therefore computed the Modeline\nModeline \"1200x1920_10.00\" 27.20 1200 1192 1304 1408 1920 1921 1924 1932 -HSync +Vsync\n\nAnd added it to the xorg.conf file together with the corresponding Mode. After restarting, however, I still don't have this mode. \nIn my /var/log/Xorg.log I see thigs like\nNot using mode \"1200x1920\" (no mode of this name)\n\nbut also\nNot using mode \"1920x1200\" (no mode of this name)\n\nThe later works in fact. The former does not. I also tried adding it with xrandr, but I get\nFailed to get size of gamma for output default\n\nFurthermore I tried supplying the mode using the argument -geom 1200x1920 to the Xdummy script. This does not add the resolution either.\nDoes xorg-dummy only support the modes already specified in the sample xorg.conf or am I making a mistake? The goal of of the exercise is to be able to switch the vnc-server resolution dynamically. I could use other vnc-servers but most of these seem to have issues related to the use of KDE. KDE's own krfb is unfortunately much slower.\n\nA: Official guide to compute modeline (with cvt) is here:  \nResolution: Adding undetected resolutions \nI think will be adequately to quote this part here:  \n\nDue to buggy hardware or drivers, your monitor's correct resolutions\n  may not always be detected. For example, the EDID data block queried\n  from your monitor may be incorrect.\nIf the mode already exists, but just isn't associated for the\n  particular output, you can add it like this:\n$ xrandr --addmode S-video 800x600\n\nIf the mode doesn't yet exist, you'll need to create it first by\n  specifying a modeline:\n$ xrandr --newmode <Mode``Line>\n\nYou may create a modeline using the gtf or cvt utility. For example,\n  if you want to add a mode with resolution 800x600 at 60 Hz, you can\n  enter the following command: (The output is shown following.)\n$ cvt 800 600 60\n# 800x600 59.86 Hz (CVT 0.48M3) hsync: 37.35 kHz; pclk: 38.25 MHz\nModeline \"800x600_60.00\"   38.25  800 832 912 1024  600 603 607 624 -hsync +vsync\n\nThen copy the information after the word \"Modeline\" into the xrandr\n  command:\n$ xrandr --newmode \"800x600_60.00\"   38.25  800 832 912 1024  600 603 607 624 -hsync +vsync\n\nAfter the mode is entered, it needs to be added to the output using\n  the --addmode command as explained above.\n\nBe careful and pay attention for last sentence.\nEither, look your modeline for the words -hsync +vsync that typed with small letters. Use official guides. Enjoy.\n", "Q: Removing grub completely I decided to dualboot Ubuntu 12.04 LTS on a laptop with preinstalled Windows 8. After some work i got both running. After some thoughts I decided to go back to only Windows 8 by restoring from factory settings. When doing this the ubuntu partitions disappeared, and windows loads like it should. But ubuntu is still a boot option in bios. If booting this, i get the grub command-line.  \nHow do I remove the grub loader completely? (I've tried the windows \"fixes\", fixmbr and fixboot but these yields no results.)\n\nA: I solved the problem by \"trying ubuntu\" on a usb stick. Then i mounted the hidden efi partition by using \"Disk Utility\" which allowed me to delete the ubuntu folder. Then I deleted the boot option on bios.\n", "Q: I lost my ownership to my personal files I tried to link some files to plex media player and made a mistake when changing rights and ownership. I made a user named plex and gave it (not intentionally) all the rights and ownership of my personal files. \nResult: I can not longer access my personal files from my normal user name.\nWhat to do?\n\nA: This will convert USER & GROUP the owner of DIRECTORY:\nsudo chown -R $USER:$GROUP DIRECTORY\n\nReplace this command with your values and run it. \nFor instance if your personal files are under /home/pepe/ do sudo chown -R $USER /home/pepe/.

Also to add, delete, modify users, in the terminal? I need a command to list all users as well as commands to add, delete and modify users from terminal - any commands that could help in administrating user accounts easily by terminal.\n\nA: Ok here is a trick that will help you sort this. The terminal has auto completion if you type user and hit Tab key twice it will list all the commands that exist with user as the first 4 chars. \nuser (tab tab)\n\ngives me as possible options\n    useradd      userdel      usermod      users        users-admin\nif you want to know more about a command google it or type man \n    man useradd\ngives\n    useradd - create a new user or update default new user information \n    ...\n    ...\nto list users you should go with what Mitch said.\nHope that helps I love tab completion in bash saves me from remembering things.\n\nA: The easiest way to get this kind of information is getent - see manpage for the getent command . While that command gives the same output as cat /etc/passwd it is useful to remember because it will give you lists of several elements in the OS.\nTo get a list of all users you type (as users are listed in /etc/passwd)\ngetent passwd\n\nTo add a user newuser to the system you would type\nsudo adduser newuser\n\nto create a user that has all default settings applied.\nBonus: To add any user (for instance anyuser) to a group (for instance cdrom) type\nsudo adduser anyuser cdrom\n\nYou delete a user (for instance obsolete) with\nsudo deluser obsolete\n\nIf you want to delete his home directory/mails as well you type\nsudo deluser --remove-home obsolete\n\nAnd\nsudo deluser --remove-all-files obsolete\n\nwill remove the user and all files owned by this user on the whole system.\n\nA: To find out the users which have home-directories in the /home-folder on the machine, run the following commands\ncd /home\nls \n\nYou can then see the users who have authorization to log into the server. If we want to look into the files of any users, you must be the root user.\n\nA: You can use compgen GNU bash built-in too:\ncompgen -u\n\nWill lists all users.\n\nA: This should get, under most normal situations, all normal (non-system, not weird, etc) users:\nawk -F'[/:]' '{if ($3 >= 1000 && $3 != 65534) print $1}' /etc/passwd\n\nThis works by:\n\n\n*\n\n*reading in from /etc/passwd\n\n*using : as a delimiter\n\n*if the third field (the User ID number) is larger than 1000 and not 65534, the first field (the username of the user) is printed.\n\n\nThis is because on many linux systems, usernames above 1000 are reserved for  unprivileged (you could say normal) users. Some info on this here:\n\nA user ID (UID) is a unique positive integer assigned by a Unix-like\n  operating system to each user. Each user is identified to the system\n  by its UID, and user names are generally used only as an interface for\n  humans.\nUIDs are stored, along with their corresponding user names and other\n  user-specific information, in the /etc/passwd file...\nThe third field contains the UID, and the fourth field contains the\n  group ID (GID), which by default is equal to the UID for all ordinary\n  users.\nIn the Linux kernels 2.4 and above, UIDs are unsigned 32-bit integers\n  that can represent values from zero to 4,294,967,296. However, it is\n  advisable to use values only up to 65,534 in order to maintain\n  compatibility with systems using older kernels or filesystems that can\n  only accommodate 16-bit UIDs.\nThe UID of 0 has a special role: it is always the root account (i.e.,\n  the omnipotent administrative user). Although the user name can be\n  changed on this account and additional accounts can be created with\n  the same UID, neither action is wise from a security point of view.\nThe UID 65534 is commonly reserved for nobody, a user with no system\n  privileges, as opposed to an ordinary (i.e., non-privileged) user.\n  This UID is often used for individuals accessing the system remotely\n  via FTP (file transfer protocol) or HTTP (hypertext transfer\n  protocol).\nUIDs 1 through 99 are traditionally reserved for special system users\n  (sometimes called pseudo-users), such as wheel, daemon, lp, operator,\n  news, mail, etc. These users are administrators who do not need total\n  root powers, but who perform some administrative tasks and thus need\n  more privileges than those given to ordinary users.\nSome Linux distributions (i.e., versions) begin UIDs for\n  non-privileged users at 100. Others, such as Red Hat, begin them at\n  500, and still others, such Debian, start them at 1000. Because of the\n  differences among distributions, manual intervention can be necessary\n  if multiple distributions are used in a network in an organization.\nAlso, it can be convenient to reserve a block of UIDs for local users,\n  such as 1000 through 9999, and another block for remote users (i.e.,\n  users elsewhere on the network), such as 10000 to 65534. The important\n  thing is to decide on a scheme and adhere to it.\nAmong the advantages of this practice of reserving blocks of numbers\n  for particular types of users is that it makes it more convenient to\n  search through system logs for suspicious user activity.\nContrary to popular belief, it is not necessary that each entry in the\n  UID field be unique. However, non-unique UIDs can cause security\n  problems, and thus UIDs should be kept unique across the entire\n  organization. Likewise, recycling of UIDs from former users should be\n  avoided for as long as possible.\n\n\nA: list of all users who can login (no system users like: bin,deamon,mail,sys, etc.)\nawk -F':' '$2 ~ \"\\$\" {print $1}' /etc/shadow\n\nadd new user\nsudo adduser new_username\n\nor\nsudo useradd new_username\n\ndelete/remove username\nsudo userdel username\n\nIf you want to delete the home directory (default the directory /home/username)\nsudo deluser --remove-home username\n\nor\nsudo rm -r /path/to/user_home_dir\n\nIf you want to delete all files from the system from this user (not only is the home diretory)\nsudo deluser --remove-all-files\n\n\nA: To list\nTo list all local users you can use:\ncut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd\n\nTo list all users capable of authenticating (in some way), including non-local, see this reply.\nSome more useful user-management commands (also limited to local users):\nTo add\nTo add a new user you can use:\nsudo adduser new_username\nor:\nsudo useradd new_username\nSee also: What is the difference between adduser and useradd?\nTo remove/delete\nTo remove/delete a user, first you can use:\nsudo userdel username\nThen you may want to delete the home directory for the deleted user account :\nsudo rm -r /home/username\nPlease use with caution the above command!\nTo modify\nTo modify the username of a user:\nusermod -l new_username old_username\nTo change the password for a user:\nsudo passwd username\nTo change the shell for a user:\nsudo chsh username\nTo change the details for a user (for example real name):\nsudo chfn username\nTo add a user to the sudo group: \nadduser username sudo\nor\nusermod -aG sudo username\nAnd, of course, see also: man adduser, man useradd, man userdel... and so on.\n\nA: Just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal.

My company has a large amount of document review work that must be done manually by temp workers. The work is done on our website, accessible via VPN only.\nWe are planning to just show scanned images of the documents on the webpages (page by page), without allowing to download the document file locally.\nHowever, I am worried that a person can take a screen shot of a web page on the computer and somehow store it on USB drive or send via gmail.

Or, to put it another way, an installation where the only thing a person can do is open a specific url in a browser and do nothing else?\n\nA: Sure I did something similar to this. What you can do is use LiveCDCustomization to remove packages you don't want.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCDCustomization\nWhat I'd do is set network rules to only allow the live USB's to access your companies IP. But if they need to use the internet I'd set up a limited user account which has nothing but Firefox in it. I'd use SElinux for this.

I start up SpeedFan and it comes up with a error saying \"Privileged instruction\". I'm very new to this, so if someone could tell me how to fix this step by step, it would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: SpeedFan is a Windows-only program. It will not work in Linux. There is an application in the default Ubuntu repositories that has similar functionality to SpeedFan called Psensor. Psensor is an application for monitoring hardware sensors, including temperatures and fan speeds.\nInstall Psensor. Also install lm-sensors to detect your computer's hardware sensors, and detect your computer's hardware sensors by running these commands:\nsudo apt install psensor lm-sensors\nsudo sensors-detect\n\nThen you will get asked a lot of questions about what hardware you want the program to detect.  It is generally safe and recommended to accept the default answers to all questions, unless you know what you're doing.\nIn Ubuntu 16.04 and later Psensor detects your computer's hardware sensors automatically without running sudo sensors-detect\nPsensor displays itself on the desktop as a little thermometer icon in the notification area in the upper right corner of the desktop. You can right-click the thermometer icon at any time to display the hardware temperatures.\n", "Q: Architecture - 32-bit handling 64-bit instructions tomasz@tomasz-lenovo-ideapad-Y530:~$ lscpu\nArchitecture:          i686\nCPU op-mode(s):        32-bit, 64-bit\nByte Order:            Little Endian\nCPU(s):                2\nOn-line CPU(s) list:   0,1\nThread(s) per core:    1\nCore(s) per socket:    2\nSocket(s):             1\nVendor ID:             GenuineIntel\nCPU family:            6\nModel:                 23\nStepping:              6\nCPU MHz:               2000.000\nBogoMIPS:              4000.12\nCache L1d:             32K\nCache L1i:             32K\nCache L2:              3072K\n\nI can see that my architecture is 32-bit (i686). But CPU op-mode(s) are 32-bit and 64-bit. The question is: how come? How is it handled that a 32-bit processor performs 64-bit operations? I guess it's a lot slower than native 32-bit operations. Is it built-in processor functionality (to emulate being 64-bit) or is it software dependent? When does it make sense for a 32-bit processor to run 64-bit operations?\n\nA: Use the lscpu command to check if your computer supports multiple CPU operation modes (usually either 32-bit or 64-bit mode).\nFrom the terminal run:\nlscpu | grep op-mode\n\nExample output on a 64-bit processor:\nuser@computer1:~$ lscpu | grep op-mode\nCPU op-mode(s): 32-bit, 64-bit\n\nExample output on a 32-bit processor:\nuser@computer2$ lscpu | grep op-mode\nCPU op-mode(s): 32-bit\n\nEither Ubuntu 32-bit or Ubuntu 64-bit can be installed on the computer in the first example. Only Ubuntu 32-bit can be installed on the computer in the second example. Either Ubuntu 32-bit or Ubuntu 64-bit can be installed on the computer in the question.\nA 32-bit application will run on either a 32-bit or a 64-bit operating system. A 64-bit OS will only run on a 64-bit processor. A 64-bit application will run on a 64-bit OS, and by doing some heavy lifting it may also be possible to run some 64-bit applications on a 32-bit OS. By \"heavy lifting\" I mean that you will need to install the 64-bit kernel1 and do other unpleasant things as well, depending on what 64-bit application(s) you are trying to install. Installing a 32-bit application in a 64-bit OS is a breeze by contrast.\n\n⠀Summer breeze\n1https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/134391/64-bit-kernel-but-all-32-bit-elf-executable-running-processes-how-is-this/134394#134394\n\nA: lscpu is telling you that your architecture is i686 (an Intel 32-bit CPU), and that your CPU supports both 32-bit and 64-bit operating modes. You won't be able to install x64 built applications since they're built specifically for x64 architectures.\nYour particular CPU can handle either the i386 or i686 built packages. There are a number of ways to verify your architecture & OS preferences.\nTry uname -m. It will show i686, that means your CPU is 32 bit support.\n\nA: It means:\nArchitecture: i686              # <-- your kernel is 32 bit (you are using 32 bit Ubuntu)\nCPU op-mode(s): 32-bit, 64-bit  # <-- your cpu can handle 32 or 64 bit instructions\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to do a dual boot for Acer Iconia W700?

The group of interns that installed all them did not keep the same eth port.  When installing it looks like they rolled a D20 and installed the Switch 10G connection on what number came up. Maybe there is a pattern, but I can not see one.  The first 6 systems have connections as follows.:  eth0, eth2, eth3, eth0, eth10, eth14.  If you see a pattern, let me know!\nWhen installing I need to detect the only active Ethernet interface. In Fedora I would normally use ethtool or ethtool-lite and script an installer.  The Ubuntu Server installer does not seem to have this.  \nAnd before you ask, I do not have switch access for these systems so matching MAC addresses to Switch logs will not work.\n\nA: If you have access to the install media you could install ethtool by running:\napt-get install ethtool\n\nIf they are installed based on the same disk image.

I want to use it now as external SSD drive under Ubuntu. I formatted it with Gparted to remove recovery partitions of Windows (that were unallocated). I have noticed that now the disk is much slower than before formatting.\nWhat do I have to do ?\nThanks !\n\nA: If you connect your SSD with USB to your computer you are limited by the USB bandwidth.\nA Samsung 840 SSD can do ca. 500MB/sec read, the USB 2.0 has a theoretical limit of only  60MB/sec but practically it can only do about 30MB/sec. This is likely your problem, USB2 is just too slow.\nWith an USB3 port (and USB3 cable and USB3 capable casing) you should be able to utilize most of the speed of your SSD even externally. (or with an eSATA port, or something other which is faster than USB2.)\nAlso if your drive is formated to NTFS it will be significantly slower on linux than on windows, because the linux NTFS driver is a slower one. This is because the NTFS file system is proprietary, and Microsoft didn't release the specifications of it, so the guys who wrote the linux driver had to reverse-engineer the file system.  If you swtich to a linux native file system, like ext4, you will likely get better performance.\n", "Q: Output Directory Contents to File I have a directory html.

We are not in the 90s anymore (Microsoft tried to get defragmentation out of users heads during development of Windows Vista). EXT4 and other filesystems avoid fragmentation where possible. If you care about performance use SSDs... for which Windows Disk Defragmenter will refuse to defrag, because that's a stupid idea.\ntl;dr: The filesystem already takes care of data consistency and performance.

This will allow you to send email. \nJust be sure that, if you want to run a full email server (with inbound traffic), you setup your DNS zone file to handle inbound mail traffic.\nFor the PHP script you're referring to... do you mean that you want to send email from something like a form, with form data as part of the email and perhaps some other default info?\n", "Q: No such file or directory when installing liblinear for use on Ubuntu in MATLAB MATLAB version is 2010a Student Version (32 bit), Ubuntu version is 13.04, 64 bit.\nI first use make in the directory liblinear-1.94.

Thanks in advance.\n\nA: Did you read evry errors appearing while installing r8168? Make sure so it is located in exact directory before blacklisting r8169. But, r8169 must work, but with horrible perfofrmance. For me it works great, until I change my video driver from Nouveau to NVIDIA 331.89. When I change them, r8169 almost does not work. I have tried to install r8168, but from my experience, that time my OS got broken. Just driver 8169 got deleted, 8168 did not install, and I had to pay 30eur to fix it(could not re-install OS- it blocked me). \nRemember: To avoid problems like that, watch for errors and ask help to the ones, who places tutorials.\n", "Q: What software is available for Book Publishing? Can anyone offer advice on a program for compiling and publishing a book?\nI have Scribus but am having a rough time with it. I was very good with Quark... I need something that has style sheets, page numbers, contents. \nIf Scribus is the best for those purposes, I guess I'll have to keep working with it but as of now I really hate it.\n\nA: It has a very steep learning curve, but I  think that the best option for books is still LaTeX, unless your book is very images-oriented. The fact that is basically a language hinders the start, but then gives you a flexibility that is difficult to find in other programs.\nIt is very well supported in Ubuntu, and has even a very friendly and useful \nStack Exchange site.\nYou can get started or explore the system here: https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/155863/getting-started-with-tex-latex\n\nA: use Quark in Ubuntu\nIf you are good at Quark, you can use it in Ubuntu as well with help of wine.

This means that you enter the content and the system works out the best layout. As the user does not have direct control over layout, LyX isn’t optimised for free-form documents such as posters, but it comes into its own in the creation of longer, more complex projects such as a book. The LyX interface doesn’t qualify as WYSIWYG, but it does reflect elements such as emphasised text, and it does allow you to see images (called figures in LaTeX-speak) and tables within the document. Although it is a front-end to a markup system, you can typically complete a complicated project without ever encountering any LaTeX code, but you can dabble with it to add customised effects.\nMore information and step by step tutotrial here:http://www.linuxuser.co.uk/tutorials/publish-a-book-with-lyx\n\nA: I don't know what your needs are exactly but you can try the Zim Desktop Wiki. It's a great tool for capturing and organizing you ideas, thoughts and writings, etc. \nFor typesetting, page layouts, etc the best option is, as Rmano mentioned, LaTex. The basic idea behind LaTex is to focus on writing and leave the \"decoration\" to the software. If you find LaTeX difficult to master, you can try Texmacs which is a WYSWYG alternative for Latex. (It doesn't use Latex internally but can import from and export to latex).\n", "Q: Issues installing netflix-desktop I installed the Netflix desktop client and clicked on the icon, but I lost my internet connection during the Wine installations. \nI tried to purge it and reinstall, but now when I click on the icon, nothing happens.

I have also lowered/adjusted the CPU execution cap to 50%, but to no avail.\nDoes anybody have any idea what could be causing this issue and how I can resolve it?\n\nA: I tried doing the same procedure this evening and ran into the same issue. I fixed it by doing the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*When it hangs, power off the virtual machine (I waited a bit, but I don't think it's necessary).\n\n*Go into your System Settings, and remove the .iso file from the Storage->Controller settings. I set mine back to Host Drive 'D:'.\n\n*Start the virtual machine back up. It should now boot into Ubuntu with your configured settings.\n\n\nI'm using VirtualBox 4.3.6 and Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.\n\nA: If it shuts down almost completely, it might want you to press space. Somehow it's not shown.\nIn this case, the OS has already been installed anyway. Just remove the .iso for the next boot!\n", "Q: Operating system not found after shut down I recently broke my Harddrive, so i'd put a new one in and installed Ubuntu 13.10 on it through LiveUSB, but the PC could not find the Operating system.\nI have a Acer eMachines e640, with amd64 processor.\nSo I did some research here and found out that I should install GRUB and MBR, so I did by installing the boot-repair. i ran the application and rebooted. Now here's my problem, the first time booting up worked, booting me up to ubuntu, but then I shut down the PC later to see that same  Operating system not found message.\nI am here asking for what could be the problem?\n\nA: Its probably due to improper boot order. \n\n\n*\n\n*Get to BIOS, find the boot order menu\n\n*Give top priority to your harddisk. Optionally, disable all other bootable media listed there.\n\n\nThis should fix your problem. If it doesnt, come back to BIOS again to see if the boot order remains exactly the same as you saved previously. If not, then you may be screwed.\n", "Q: Error installing sdl2 on lubuntu 12.10 Trying to install the love game engine but I seem to be unable to install the SDL2.

What can I do to address this error message?\n\nA: If you want to view the error report go to the /var/crash/ directory and there you will find the error reports which you can view with any text editor. \nIf you can't figure out the problem and the message keeps coming up:\n\n\n*\n\n*It is possible that this error only happened once, but the error report got stuck and pops-up on every boot. So just delete the error reports from /var/crash/ (you will need root privileges for some, so use the sudo rm /var/crash/* command). If after this the error message doesn't come back then all is good.\n\n*If the error message is not from a stuck report, but the errors are constantly happening and you can't figure out the problem on your own then submit a bugreport. See How do I report a bug?\n", "Q: Is Dell Bios article on Ubuntu Wiki outdated? I came across this \"immutable\" page on the wiki.\nAccording to this, Dell doesn't support Ubuntu?? Even if they advertise it preinstalled?\nAlso, it seems the non-Windows instructions don't match the non-windows installation instructions, here for example.\nAm I right in assuming the Dell instructions are the correct ones for Bios updates?\n\nA: I can only assure you, that the following steps worked for me. This \"What worked for one user on a Dell Inspiron 1525 and Xubuntu, using Wine to extract BIOS image etc\" on the mentioned wiki page is quite similar to my steps: \nI've recently updated the BIOS of my Dell Latitude E6500 from version A27 to A29 under Linux Mint 17 KDE (= Ubuntu 14.04 LTS Trusty Tahr) with the CLI and here is what worked very well for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the needed DELL Software sudo apt-get install firmware-addon-dell smbios-utils wine\n\n*Check your BIOS version: sudo dmidecode -s bios-version My output: A27\n\n*Download your BiosUpdateFile.exe (in my case E6500A29.exe) for your specific device from the DELL Support Page\n\n*Switch to the directory which nests your E6500A29.exe and extract the *.hdr file from it with the command: wine E6500A29.exe -writehdrfile\n\n*Update BIOS: sudo dellBiosUpdate -u -f E6500A29.hdr\n\n*Reboot: sudo reboot now\n\n*Check your BIOS version again: sudo dmidecode -s bios-version My output: A29\n", "Q: Easy desktop icons I would like an easy way to have most of my programmes,like chrome,firefox,emapthy,rythmnbox  - on the desktop.\nI am running 13.10 with Gnome 3 and have not found an easy solution.\nPlease is there an easy solution?\n\nA: For a single icon at a time:\n\n*\n\n*Open the Dash by pressing the Super key (aka    key in Windows keyboard),\n\n\n*Search for the application you want on desktop,\n\n\n*Drag and drop the app icon on your desktop.\nHere are the snapshots:\n\n\nFor multiple icons at a time:\n\n*\n\n*Open Nautilus or other file manager and browse to the directory /usr/share/applications. (Or in the Nautilus window, hit Ctrl + L) and type in the path/location: /usr/share/location/ and hit enter as shown in the snapshot.)\n\n\n\n*Select the application icon of the those which you want to copy (to select multiple, press-hold Ctrl and click the icons), and then Ctrl + C to copy, and go to the desktop where you'd paste them using Ctrl + V. Or with all desired icons selected, right-click on any selected icon and from the context menu select Copy to -> Desktop.\n\n\nA: Creating shortcut links to launch applications:\nOpen a terminal (press Ctrl + Alt + T) and copy the target applications *.desktop file to your Desktop. e.g. for VLC Media Player the *.desktop the command would be:\ncp /usr/share/applications/vlc.desktop ~/Desktop\n\nNow make the copy on the desktop executable with using chmod. e.g.: for vlc.desktop it would be\nchmod +x ~/Desktop/vlc.desktop\n\nAnd then you should be able to launch the application by double clicking the icon on the desktop.\n\nSearching the *.desktop file for the application:\nIf you need to make a little search for the proper *.desktop file for the target application using some related keywords (e.g. for vlc it could be vlc, media player or others), here's some codes that should help.\n\n\n*\n\n*Direct search for the keyword in the filename:\nls /usr/share/applications/*your_app_keyword*.desktop\n\nso if you're looking for vlc, it would be:\nls /usr/share/applications/*vlc*.desktop\n\n\n*Searching the files contents to see if the keyword is there:\nFor this, you can copy the entire line of codes below (select entire line and press Ctrl + C) and paste it in the terminal using the shortcut key combo Ctrl + Shift + V make changes to fit your context like you can replace the /usr/share/applications with the path where you want to look in and here I've used \"media player\" as the keyword which you should replace with that of your choice and hit enter. (Also remember to use the double quotes if you're using white spaces in your keyword.)\nfor i in $( ls -R /usr/share/applications/*.desktop); do if grep -i \"media player\" \"$i\" > /dev/null; then echo \"$i\"; fi; done;\n\nThese should output some *.desktop file. See if they're the one you are searching for. If yes, that's your target *.desktop file to be used to create the application launch link as explained above.\n\nAn example with demonstrating the complete process:\nThe command:\n$ for i in $( ls -R /usr/share/applications/*.desktop); \\\n  do if grep -i \"rhythmbox\" \"$i\" > /dev/null; then echo \"$i\"; \\\n  fi; done;\n\noutputs these:\n/usr/share/applications/rhythmbox.desktop\n/usr/share/applications/rhythmbox-device.desktop\n\nand among these, /usr/share/applications/rhythmbox.desktop starts the application's UI. So now we'll use this path to create a desktop launch icon.\nTo copy the file to your desktop, use:\n$ cp /usr/share/applications/rhythmbox.desktop ~/Desktop\n\nThen you'll have to make it executable with this:\n$ chmod +x ~/Desktop/rhythmbox.desktop\n\nSimilarly, you have the other on your desktop.\n\nA: You can run these commands:\nsearch='VLC'\ngrep -Ri \"Name=.*$search.*\" '/usr/share/applications' \"$HOME/.local/share/applications\"\n\nreplace VLC with the program you want to add to the desktop (leave the quotes).\n\nExample output:\n$ search='Ubuntu'\n$ grep -Ri 'Name=.*$search.*' '/usr/share/applications' \"$HOME/.local/share/applications\"\n/usr/share/applications/ubuntuone-control-panel-qt-gnome.desktop:Name=Ubuntu One\n/usr/share/applications/ubuntu-software-center.desktop:Name=Ubuntu Software Center\n/usr/share/applications/UbuntuOneMusiconeubuntucom.desktop:Name=Ubuntu One Music\n/usr/share/applications/ubuntuone-installer.desktop:Name=Ubuntu One\n\n\nYou can then run\ncp -v /path/to/file \"$HOME/Desktop/\"\n\nReplacing /path/to/file with the value in purple of the program you'd like from the above commands.\n\nA: Should be as simple as dragging an icon from the dash to the Desktop. But unfortunately we have to use the terminal.\nYou must install the following package.\nsudo apt-get install gnome-panel\nThen just run the command:\ngnome-desktop-item-edit Desktop --create-new\n\nIn the example I'm creating a shortcut for firefox. My interface is in Portuguese but I think you can understand the example.\n", "Q: How can I rename an external drive? I would like to rename an external drive (USB). \nHow can I rename an external drive?\n\nA: Among many other options, you can start application Disk Utility and select the disk/device to rename. Unmount the partition if needed. You can then find an option for assigning new label to the disk - the Edit a Filesystem Label, click that to rename the device. \n\n\n", "Q: Node.js application is not working ARM Ubuntu I use a Samsung ARM Chromebook as a dev machine, and as a result Node.js is absolutely essential.\n In the past I've had no issues with it whatsoever. However, due to unfortunate circumstances I was recently forced to wipe my computer and start fresh.

How do I set to start with the middle one?\n\nA: This is a nice idea. I don't know if there is a GUI way to do this (most probably, no), but you can use, for example, the following script at start up to make Ubuntu change to the top left workspace with the middle one:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n#check if xdotool is installed\nif [ ! -n \"$(dpkg -s xdotool 2>/dev/null | grep 'Status: install ok installed')\" ]; then\n    echo -e \"The package 'xdotool' must to be installed before to run $(basename $0)\\nUse 'sudo apt-get install xdotool' command in terminal to install it.\"\n    exit\nfi\n\nxdotool key Ctrl+Alt+Right\nxdotool key Ctrl+Alt+Down\n\n\nA: An adaptation of Radu's answer.

Such is not the case. Perhaps the reason the installer keeps kicking back to the beginning is because it sees the unallocated space of the hard disk and doesn't know what to do with it, so it goes back to let you choose the \"something else\" option.\nIf you don't feel like going into manual partitioning, I recommend expanding your Windows partition back into the space you cut before and then choosing the \"install Ubuntu alongside Windows 7\" option in the installer. You'll be able to resize the Windows partition from here. Just make sure you're not cutting into used space, or else you'll lose all of your files!\n", "Q: Completely remove windows 7 and install ubuntu I have installed dual boot windows 7 and Ubuntu. Now I'm totally into Ubuntu. I found I just have to simply delete the windows 7 by using \"Disk utility\" in Ubuntu. I did it. Then I wanted to spread my Ubuntu OS to the those partitions as well. Then I find a good video tutorial. It says to use \"gparted\". \nSo I'm going to use it. But when I'm checking my hard disk data usage by using Disk utility, I'm a bit confused how to extend the hard disk space for Ubuntu. It shows several partitions. I want to clarify which partitions I should add to Ubuntu. So I have attached a snapshot of my hard disk data usage. Please help me on this.\n\n\nA: You can't expand partitions forward on a disk. My advice would be to extend the ext4 (Ubuntu) partition as much as you can (using \"edit partition\"), and then make another partition in the remaining free space with an ext4 filesystem to use under Ubuntu. \nIf you only want one partition for Ubuntu, I would boot from the live USB drive and select \"Erase everything and install Ubuntu\". This will erase everything on your hard drive, so back up your files first (especially your home folder).\n\nA: *\n\n*You can add 105 GB and 172 GB unallocated space to your Ubuntu partition.For this first you had to boot Ubuntu live disk.\n\n*Click on try ubuntu option on startup and then open gparted from Dash.Make sure that all your partitions are unmounted.\n\n*Now rightclick on your Ubuntu partition and select Resize/Move option,now you can be able to add 105 GB unallocated space to your ext4 partition by dragging the left arrow to the extreme left.\n\n*Apply the changes.Now your Ubuntu partition size become 135 GB.\n\n*To add 172 GB unallocated space(which was outside the extended partition) with your Ubuntu partition,follow the below .\n\n*Right-click on the extended partition(not your Ubuntu partition) and select Resize option.Add 172 GB unallocated space to your extended partition by dragging the left arrow to the extreme left.Now the 172 GB unallocated space would comes just below to your ext4 partition.\n\n*Add the 172 GB unallocated space,now your Ubuntu partition size will become (172+105+30 GB)\n", "Q: How do I get the ath9k driver of backports-3.12-8 installed on Xubuntu 13.10? I downloaded the 3.12-8 kernel files linux-headers-all.deb, linux-headers-generic_i368.deb; linux-image-generic_i386.deb from kernel.org and installed them via:\n dpkg -i *.deb\n\nNow I'm trying to eliminate some wifi signal dropouts, which are probably caused by the driver itself. Apparently there have been some fixes to the ath9k driver, so I'd like to replace the default by a backports version.\nI downloaded backports-3.12.8-1.tar.gz from kernel.org and tried to get the ath9k module ready by:\ncd ~/.source/backports-3.12.8-1/\nsudo apt-get install build-essential\nsudo apt-get build-dep linux-image-$(uname -r)\nsudo ln -s /usr/src/linux-headers-$(uname -r) /usr/src/linux\nmake defconfig-ath9k\n\nThis leaves me with following \"missing-prototypes ERROR\":\ncc -Wall -Wmissing-prototypes -Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer   -c -o conf.o conf.c\ncc -Wall -Wmissing-prototypes -Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer   -c -o zconf.tab.o zconf.tab.c\ncc   conf.o zconf.tab.o   -o conf\n\nBut when I continue with:\nsudo modprobe -r ath9k\nsudo make\nsudo checkinstall\n\neverything works!!!\nSo my questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Does this module depend on certain other kernel modules?\n\nYes following command does tell you:\nmodinfo ath9k\n\n\n*If so, where's information about that stuff?\n\nHave a look at wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Drivers/ath9k.\n\n\n*Is there a right way to install this kernel module resp. driver?\n\nProbably by getting a pro in kernel compiling :-).\n\nTHX \n\nA: For those who might stumble across this question, like I just did:\n\nThis leaves me with following \"missing-prototypes ERROR\":\ncc -Wall -Wmissing-prototypes -Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer   -c -o conf.o conf.c\ncc -Wall -Wmissing-prototypes -Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer   -c -o zconf.tab.o zconf.tab.c\ncc   conf.o zconf.tab.o   -o conf\n\n\nThese lines aren't actually errors. The make command runs a bunch of other commands, as specified in a file called Makefile. By default, make will write out these commands to the terminal before running them. For example, if Makefile says to run foo then bar then baz, make will write foo to the terminal then run the foo command; then it will write bar to the terminal and run bar; then it will write baz to the terminal and run baz.\nIn this case, those cc lines are commands that make has been told to run by Makefile. The cc command will run the system's default C compiler, which is probably GCC. Those things beginning with - are options, which affect the behaviour of the C compiler.\nFor compilers like GCC, options beginning with -W tell the compiler to give out warnings when it sees code that's technically valid, but is often a bad idea (e.g. some pattern in the code which many programmers think will act in some way, but will actually act in another).\nIn this case -Wall turns on many (not quite all!) of GCC's warnings. -Wmissing-prototypes and -Wstrict-prototypes turn on extra warnings, to spot problems relating to C's function prototype feature.\nHence, these messages are really telling us that the cc command is about to be run, and that (among other things) it should warn us if it thinks the code is dodgy; in particular, if function prototypes are being misused.\nGCC warnings look something like this:\nmain.c: In function ‘main’:\nmain.c:1:5: warning: traditional C rejects ISO C style function definitions [-Wtraditional]\n int main(int argc, char **argv) {\n     ^\n\nSince nothing like that appears in your output, no warnings or errors occurred; even with these extra -W checks enabled.\n\nA: I would recommend installing a newer kernel although it should be working since correctly since 2.6.30 or a version like that. I'm using it as an AP in kernel 3.13.0-24-generic, even though i know it is better to install a new kernel.

I have an 256GB SSD and a 2TB HDD in my system. I had windows 7 on the SSD until a couple of days ago and ubuntu on a partition on my HDD. Not so familiar with ubuntu btw, just getting into it.\nI had some issuse with windows so I decided to switch to ubuntu full time, but I needed to keep windows for some essential software.\nOk, main story now. Ubuntu on SSD, no problem. Had windows on a partition on the HDD, but it didn't boot. \nAt this point I already switched to ubuntu and made both partitions of the HDD, the storage one and the windows one, auto-mount on startup. \nI did this through the \"Disks\" application(program? idk, new to ubuntu).

However from your ftsab Ubuntu was not aware of this. It still assumes tzhe drive is present and tried to mount it, of course with no success, hence the error you got. The solution is to remove this fstab entry.\nSimply renaming a partition by giving it another label would not change it's UUID but the mount point when is generated from the disk label may be renamed then.\nOther than by UUID we can also mount a disk by label from the /etc/fstab:\n\n\n*\n\n*Constant UUID on USB install\nThis has the advantage that we can change drives, alter partitions or else without an issue as long as the drive will get the identical label as listed in the fstab.

Turns out it was the grub2 bootloader, which is loaded even if Ubuntu is your only OS (i.e. not multi-booting).  Turn on computer -> grub loads and confuses screen resolution -> Ubuntu loads and tries its best but gets it wrong by 10px to the left and 10px up.  It even confused Windows when I used grub to load it.  Grrrr grub.\nI fixed my problem by editing the grub bootloader and manually setting the resolution.  I'm no wizard, so I used Grub Customizer.  In my case, I have a 1440x900 monitor and setting it to 1280x1024 worked great.  Once Ubuntu loads, I have ful 1440x900.  I even got to set a custom background for Grub, so that's cool.\n\n\n*\n\n*Grub Customizer\n\n*Install Instructions\nI couldn't promise this will fix your problem.

I would like to cleanly install windows 7 on another partition to ubuntu 12.04.\nI originally had a windows 7 only machine. I subsequently installed ubuntu 12.04 alongside it by creating a partition.\nWindows 7 now seems to be corrupted - when it starts loading it eventually shows a blue screen with what looks like a memory related error message. The boot loader (if that is the right terminology) appears to be working as I can get into ubuntu fine, and windows does start to load.\nI am confused about what hard drives and partitions I actually have, and where each OS is. I am not even sure if I have one or two physical hard drives. Here are screenshots of my drives / partitions.\n\n\nI have a windows 7 CD (came with my PC).\nWhat do I need to do to get windows 7 working again?\nFYI: I am not experienced with partitioning, nor massively experienced with windows nor linux.

If it's a partition, remove it from GRUB to make sure it doesn't break your Ubuntu install -- GParted will complain if anything bad is about to happen. Make note of current /boot device. If that doesn't show up there, make note of the / device. The device name is something like sda5.\nStep Two\nInstall Windows 7 into the space you just made\nStep Three\nLoad up from your Ubuntu live CD, and then run these commands.\nIf you DO NOT have a separate /boot partition:\nsudo mount /dev/DEVICENAME_FROM_STEP_ONE /mnt\nsudo rm -rf /boot    # Careful here, make sure YOU ARE USING THE LIVE CD. I tried,\nit works.\nsudo ln -s /mnt/boot /boot\n\nIf you have a SEPARATE /boot partition:\nsudo mount /dev/DEVICENAME_FROM_STEP_ONE /boot\n\nStep Four\nThen continue with those commands:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install grub-pc\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda     # NOTE THAT THERE IS NO DIGIT\nsudo umount /boot\n\nAnd restart. It should work fine and boot both systems.\n", "Q: Lenovo TP X230 + Series 3 Docking - Toggle between DVI and DP working?

I'm using Ubuntu 13.10 now.\nOne day I mentioned that my discrete AMD graphics card is not working, after some googling I found a way how to check it and command fglrxinfo gave me X Error of Bad Request. And so started my big quest for trying to make it work. \nI tried so many ways from Google but no one of them really helped - I still can't use discrete card. I wouldn't even want to be able to switch them - I just want a discrete one work.\nThe last one I tried is installing driver from official site. Ok, so I installed it with sudo sh ./amd*.run, it processed and gave me DKMS error in the end or smth like that. After that I rebooted and got a message that system couldn't detect drivers and so on.\nSo my question is: \n\n\n*\n\n*how do I install drivers for my graphics card now, in 2014?\n\n\nA: You can try with this tutorial: https://xpressrazor.wordpress.com/2013/10/08/enable-and-use-open-source-radeon-drivers-in-a-muxless-hybrid-graphics-intelamd-setup/\nI have an AMD/Intel Hybrid graphic system, anda thar was my choice.

Because tab will align the cursor on the next multiple of 8 column and due to the 4 chars of the prompt, tab will just move the cursor 4 to the left to have it aligned on the 8th column. So that's not the python interpreter, but the terminal that have this behavior. You can see by using a space before hitting tab, it will still be aligned, even if python will not like it ( cause python internally will count tab as 8 chars, no matter the position or what is before or after ).\nAFAIK, this is a purely cosmetic issue, but if it bother you, I would suggest to use ipython, which is a much improved python command line.\n", "Q: grub rescue no file error I installed Ubuntu 13.04 along side windows 8 it works fine. \nWhen I just use Ubuntu only but once I restart and use Windows and then switch off and again switch on something error displays with grub rescue and nothing more no Ubuntu no Windows only black.\nI need help i have just begin using it I haven't tried anything.\n\nA: You need to have Ubuntu Live CD or Live USB.

I came across this in the command line help.\n\nA: trap is not a external command, but a built-in command of bash. It can be used in a script to run a bash function when some event (like Ctrl+C, or a signal) is received by the script. For example, if you create a temporary file in the script, it is seen as best practice to remove it when the script finish. However, if the script is killed or interrupted, the end of the script will not be run, unless if that's handled by trap. \nIt doesn't serve much outside of a script, so you can safely ignore it.\nAnd I would suggest to search \"bash trap\" to see various tutorials about programming and scripting explaining in details the usage.\n\nA: AFAIK trap generally is used as a shell builtin which executes the command when the shell receives signals.\nWe can also use this ignore and clear leftover signals at some process interruption. \nThere some documents which can help you with trap:\n\n\n*\n\n*Errors and Signals and Traps\n\n*Unix - Signals and Traps\n", "Q: xte called from xbindkeys is not working I am trying to setup xbindkeys in Kubuntu, since I got a new mouse with some useless buttons.

That file is just a list of mounts which should be automounted (or not). The mountall command runs as root when you boot, and mounts everything which is listed in the fstab. (Except those mounts which have the noauto options set in fstab, those ones are not automounted.)  So you don't have to care about sudo. \nIf you put sudo -i into fstab then the mountall command likely can't parse that file because of that syntax error: The mountall command is trying to mount the sudo -i drive or something more wrong. So yes, this is your problem.\nYou rebooted your computer with a syntax error in fstab. As the system boots, it calls mountall to mount the listed things from fstab. mountall reaches that sudo -i line which he doesn't know what to do with. Your system is likely stuck at this point and waiting for interaction on what to do.\n", "Q: USB stick shows up as two drives!

Windows 7 drivers were giving me this problem. I downloaded usb 3.0 drivers from dell website but they gave errors of newer drivers are already installed. Then i downloaded drivers from intel website they too gave the particular error but i was able to force install and now after testing my problem is resolved. So this problem arises when you don't have proper windows usb 3.0 drivers and you try to attach usb 2.0 device in usb 3.0 port in linux.\nThese are lsusb and lspci outputs if it can help:\n\n\nA: First you should try to installing proper USB3 drivers in windows, look for them on your motherboard/laptop manufacturers website. If this doesn't solve the issue read on how to workaround this problem:\nI couldn't find the same problem with dual-booting on the web, but I found similar problems with Windows not detecting the USB3 ports at all, and some similar linux USB-problems when the USB's are only detected after suspending. For both of these problems the solution (or more likely a workaround) is to go into the BIOS and\n\n*\n\n*change the XHCI Pre-Boot Mode from auto to disabled, or\n\n*change the XHCI Mode from Smart Auto to auto\nFrom here and here are some explanations:\n\nSmart Auto\nThis mode is available only when the BIOS supports the xHCI controller in the pre-boot environment. This mode is similar to Auto, but it adds the capability to route the ports to xHCI or EHCI according to setting used in previous boots (for non-G3 boot) in the pre-boot environment. ... If you reboot the OS, during this reboot BIOS phase, BIOS is \"Smart\" enough to avoid downgrade the USB 3.0 port back to 2.0 functionality before OS USB 3.0 driver load. So Smart Auto is faster than Auto on 2nd boot onward.\nXHCI Mode = Auto\nThe on-board USB 3.0 port function like a 2.0 port before OS USB 3.0 driver load.\nIf you reboot the OS, the on-board USB 3.0 port again function like a 2.0 port during this reboot BIOS phase before OS USB 3.0 driver load.\n\nI think this will solve your problem. But likely this is just a workaround, I think one of your USB3 driver is the guilty. I would go for that it is your windows driver. You should do some speed tests on your USB3 ports if they provide proper USB3 speeds in windows and in linux, both with these BIOS options turned on or off.\n", "Q: Adding a Google Docs link to my desktop How can I add a Google Docs link with a Google Docs icon to my Desktop?\n\nA: Write a desktop file with the contents:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Google Drive\nType=Application\nIcon=google-drive\nExec=x-www-browser \"https://drive.google.com/#my-drive\"\nStartupWMClass=DriveGoogleCom\n\nsave it to ~/.local/share/applications/ with the name GoogleDrive.desktop (for example).

There is nothing like sudo make-prepare or sudo get-apt kernel-devel right?\nA workaround suggested to copy the version.h (cp -v /usr/include/linux/version.h /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build/include/linux) which lead to this error:\nERROR: If you are using a Linux 2.4 kernel, please make sure  you\neither have configured kernel sources matching your  kernel or the\ncorrect set of kernel headers installed  on your system.  If you are\nusing a Linux 2.6 kernel, please make sure  you have configured kernel\nsources matching your kernel  installed on your system. If you\nspecified a separate  output directory using either the\n\"KBUILD_OUTPUT\" or  the \"O\" KBUILD parameter, make sure to specify\nthis  directory with the SYSOUT environment variable or with  the\nequivalent nvidia-installer command line option.  Depending on where\nand how the kernel sources (or the  kernel headers) were installed,\nyou may need to specify  their location with the SYSSRC environment\nvariable or  the equivalent nvidia-installer command line option.\n\nWhere are the kernel sources installed? \nI even tried to run the ...pkg1.run with --kernel-source-path /usr/include/linux (where version.h and many other .h Files are) as parameter but this lead to:\n ERROR: The kernel header file\n '/usr/include/linux/include/linux/kernel.h' does not exist (...)\n\nHas anybody an idea?\n\nA: Ok, seems like you have been playing way too much with your installation... please read everything before doing anything.\nThe only thing you need to do was install the kernel headers and everything would be fine:\nsudo apt-get install linux-generic\n\nThat was the only thing you have to do and would solve the \"The kernel header file\n'version.h' does not exist.\" error... Now we need to revert what you have done to make it right.\n\nHow can I configure the kernel source files? There is nothing like sudo make-prepare or sudo get-apt kernel-devel right?\n\nYou don't need to configure anything. If you use APT everything will be placed just fine. Also, you don't need sudo to do make. There is no get-apt nor make-prepare commands, so wherever you saw those just close that page and don't trust anything said there.\n\nA workaround suggested to copy the version.h (cp -v /usr/include/linux/version.h /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build/include/linux) which lead to this error:\n\nYou must only follow the guides in the last 1 year and from people that knows what they are doing... the /usr/include/linux/version.h file and /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build/include/linux are essentially provided by different packages. The one in usr is provided by linux-libc-dev while the one you need is provided by linux-headers.

I have been using Ubuntu for a short period of time. I have seen the term \"bash\" in many places, including a terminal. I have still not understood what it is.\nCan somebody please explain clearly?\n\nA: Bash is a command processor, typically run in a text window, allowing the user to type commands which cause actions. Bash can also read commands from a file, called a script. Like all Unix shells, it supports filename wildcarding, piping, here documents, command substitution, variables and control structures for condition-testing and iteration. The keywords, syntax and other basic features of the language were all copied from sh. Other features, e.g., history, were copied from csh and ksh. Bash is a POSIX shell but with a number of extensions.\nThe name itself is an acronym, a pun and descriptive. As an acronym, it stands for Bourne-again shell, referring to its objective as a free replacement for the Bourne shell. As a pun, it expressed that objective in a phrase that sounds the same as born again, a term for spiritual rebirth. The name is also descriptive of what it did, bashing together the features of sh, csh and ksh.\n\nA: Expansion for   Bash is  Bourne Again shell.\n\nBash is the shell, or command language interpreter, for the GNU\n  operating system. The name is an acronym for the ‘Bourne-Again SHell’,\n  a pun on Stephen Bourne, the author of the direct ancestor of the\n  current Unix shell sh, which appeared in the Seventh Edition Bell Labs\n  Research version of Unix.\nBash is largely compatible with sh and incorporates useful features\n  from the Korn shell ksh and the C shell csh. It is intended to be a\n  conformant implementation of the IEEE POSIX Shell and Tools portion of\n  the IEEE POSIX specification (IEEE Standard 1003.1). It offers\n  functional improvements over sh for both interactive and programming\n  use.\nWhile the GNU operating system provides other shells, including a\n  version of csh, Bash is the default shell. Like other GNU software,\n  Bash is quite portable. It currently runs on nearly every version of\n  Unix and a few other operating systems - independently-supported ports\n  exist for MS-DOS, OS/2, and Windows platforms.\n\nSource\n", "Q: How te reinstall Unity?

To quote the manual for apt-get (man apt-get):\n\nautoremove\n       autoremove is used to remove packages that were automatically installed to satisfy dependencies for other packages and\n  are now no longer\n             needed.\n\nThe problem with this is that is it thinks those packages are no longer needed, as packages with those packages as dependencies are not installed, etc. This is only designed to remove supposedly unneeded packages, with the flaw that they are sometimes wanted (e.g. skype-bin). Those packages also only amount to 0.1 Gigabytes, so will not take up loads of space.\nIf you want to remove some you think you don't need, you can remove them individually with sudo apt-get remove .... Leaving them installed should be fine, it is rare that something just being installed to cause damage. \nAnd if you do decide to remove those packages, hopefully reinstalling them afterwards should resolve any issues - just make a note of what will be removed.\n", "Q: Corrupted HD recovery, non-PAE machine I was trying to fix a corrupt hard drive  I was given information on trying to recover the files on a failed drive by getting ubuntu and looking around.  \nMy laptop is awaiting a new drive so I only have an old xp desktop and the newer versions of ubuntu won't work.

I do not have an azbuddy folder under ~home/.azereus/plugins/ and do not see an installer or source package available here: http://plugins.vuze.com/plugin_list.php.\nI've looked for hours through the vuze wiki and forum where there is not much dedicated to Linux.

Does transmission have that capability*?*\nI'm posting this in the vuze forum with title: Ubuntu azbuddy (Friends) Plugin Issues.\n\nA: On a fresh install of Ubuntu 12.04, The Vuze Plugins menu does not work when installing from the Ubuntu software repositories.  There does not appear to be any support of the azbuddy plugin feature.  It is not offered from the Vuze plugins list and a folder with configuration files is not adding automatically to /home/username/.azureus/plugins.  The Vuze GUI lists the plugin as installed and lets you configure it, but does not take affect.  Basically, it's just misleading.\nTransmission does have the capability to privately share torrents with friends.  From the Transmission application menu select:\n\nFile/New\nselect the \"Private torrent\" check box.  \n\nThere are just 2 directories where Vuze configuration files are stored (when installed using the repositories version rather than manually): \n\n/home/username/.azureus\n/usr/share/app-install/desktop/azureus:azureus.desktop\n\nTo completely uninstall, use thepurgeoption. autoremovewill get rid of any java packages you aren't using.

I don't want to restart immediately.\n\nA: I don't really understand why you are using the root directory for this \"test\", and I don't really think that's what you want to do (you can end up breaking your system badly). Also, notice that if you are root (the # prompt) you don't need to \"sudo\".\nPlease consider editing the question to reflect what you are trying to achieve.\nI will repeat, for the sake of completeness:\n\nConsider putting the conf file in ~/.config/upstart/ so that you don't need to sudo: you would use initctl start testing to start the script for example. (I am assuming that your conf file doesn't need root privileges.) \n\nOn reading the cookbook, it says that the pre-start, post-start, and post-stop stanzas are rerun on a respawned job. This means you can do something like this:\nstart on runlevel [2345]\nstop on runlevel [016]\n\nchdir /path/to/a/folder\nrespawn\n\nexec python testing.py\n\npost-stop script\n  sleep 1\nend script\n\nThis way there will be a 1 second delay before the script is respawned.

I have looked in the synaptics configuration GUI but couldn't find an option to change this behaviour. Am I missing something or is there some other way to achieve the desired behaviour?\n\nA: I first met with success when I tried disabling the soft button for right click by moving it out of the bounds of the trackpad.

Windows boot loader does not detect Ubuntu so you wouldn't be able to boot into it because you won't see it on startup.\nTo reinstall grub after you finish the windows installation, prepare an Ubuntu live USB, boot from it and and follow these instructions:\nhttp://howtoubuntu.org/how-to-repair-restore-reinstall-grub-2-with-a-ubuntu-live-cd\nor this:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair\nI guess that's all :)\n\nA: Here's the general outline:\n1.Make space for Windows 7\n2.Install Windows 7\n3.Reinstate GRUB\n4.Mount the /boot partition\n5.Install the boot loader\nStep One\nOpen up GParted, and make sure that you have at least 20 GB available for Windows 7, either as a partition you can remove, or as unpartitioned space. If it's a partition, remove it from GRUB to make sure it doesn't break your Ubuntu install -- GParted will complain if anything bad is about to happen. Make note of current /boot device. If that doesn't show up there, make note of the / device. The device name is something like sda5.\nStep Two\nInstall Windows 7 into the space you just made\nStep Three\nLoad up from your Ubuntu live CD, and then run these commands.\nIf you DO NOT have a separate /boot partition:\nsudo mount /dev/DEVICENAME_FROM_STEP_ONE /mnt\nsudo rm -rf /boot   \n\nCareful here, make sure YOU ARE USING THE LIVE CD.

The nvidia Optimus is actually integrated graphics (or hybrid graphics https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HybridGraphics). So it's new technology where the GPU and CPU are physically wired together. \nAlso because nvidia is nvidia they suck at open source (Linus actually flicked them off at a conference) and their drivers for Linux to allow the system to run aren't working properly. They stated they had no plans to support at this time(https://askubuntu.com/tags/nvidia-optimus/info). Instead it's fallen to users, hackers, and whoever else (not sure who is working on which thing) to develop the drivers for the integrated graphics. However without knowing the full details of how it's built the best anyone else can do is try to implement things based on reverse engineering the system itself. This has led to the many issues. So overall it's currently a sad state of affairs. \nThere does seem to be hope coming in update 14.04 (http://m.webupd8.org/2013/12/more-work-to-support-nvidia-optimus.html?m=1).

I'm using bash_completion version 1.3 release (I got this from the comments on the /etc/bash_completion file)\nI thought bash always did auto complete for files and directories after a command. But after a google search and reading more about the bash_completion thing, I realized that this was different for different commands. But I'm facing a problem with this auto-completion feature of bash when using an alternate way to invoke emacs -nw.\nI have defined ee as a function in my ~/.bash_aliases file. I know this is not an alias, but I am just using a function to do what an alias would do:\nfunction ee () {\n    emacs -nw \"$@\"\n}\n\nexport -f ee\n\nI thought that I could still use tab completion with the ee function if I typed a partial file name. This just doesn't seem to work. \nWhereas if I typed in emacs -nw followed by a partial file name the tab completion works perfectly. I really don't understand what is missing here. \nI checked the output of the command complete -p and I get the following for both emacs and ee: \neakangk@eakan-u-vbox:~$ complete -p | grep 'ee'\ncomplete -F _filedir_xspec ee\neakangk@eakan-u-vbox:~$ complete -p | grep 'emacs'\ncomplete -F _filedir_xspec emacs\n\nWouldn't that mean both commands should give me the same sort of behaviour when attempting auto completion?\nEdit: I hadn't seen the ee line in the /etc/bash_completion file when posting the question. But now I know it is there. \nBut the /etc/bash_completion file has the following lines:\ncomplete -f -X '!*.@(gif|jp?(e)g|miff|tif?(f)|pn[gm]|p[bgp]m|bmp|xpm|ico|xwd|tga|pcx)' ee\ncomplete -f -X '*.@(o|so|so.!(conf)|a|[rs]pm|gif|jp?(e)g|mp3|mp?(e)g|avi|asf|ogg|class)' vi vim gvim rvim view rview rgvim rgview gview emacs xemacs sxemacs kate kwrite\n\nWhat am I doing wrong here?\n\nA: This has to do with the bash-completion package. It has some custom completion set for emacs, and apparently that same completion fails when the command name is different.\nI don't use bash-completion myself, but I did a quick look at the source, and found this:\n_install_xspec '*.@(o|so|so.!(conf|*/*)|a|[rs]pm|gif|jp?(e)g|mp3|mp?(e)g|avi|asf|ogg|class)' vi vim gvim rvim view rview rgvim rgview gview emacs xemacs sxemacs kate kwrite\n\nwhich is probably used to say \"for these commands, do not complete files ending with .gif, .mp3, .avi etc\", and I'm guessing that if there's no _install_xspec line for your ee command, it doesn't complete anything.\nLooking at the _install_xspec function, it simply puts these values in an associative array named _xspecs using command name as key, so if you run, _xspecs[ee]=${_xspecs[emacs]}, the ee command should get the same completions as emacs gets.\n", "Q: If I download Ubuntu, with CD, or Windows Installer, will it automatically dual-boot? So I want to install Ubuntu, just to learn how to use Linux. Currently I'm using Windows 7 and I have ample HDD space. If I burn this OS onto a CD, or use the WI, will it erase Windows or cause Windows problems? Or will it give me a dual boot option at the beginning of the boot.\n\nA: During the installation process for Ubuntu, you get to choose \"alongside\" the existing Windows system, or \"something else\" where you can manually set up individual disk partitions.  This usually requires shrinking the Windows partition and then creating a separate partition for Ubuntu in the (now) unallocated space.  See for example: http://techsultan.com/install-ubuntu-13-10-dual-boot-windows-7-8/\n\nA: During installation you will get the option to install Ubuntu \"alongside\" Windows.

Disturbing the partitions may cause data loss.

To access exfat with read-write, add the ppa relan/exfat and install the package exfat-utils :\nsudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:relan/exfat\nsudo apt-get update -qq\nsudo apt-get install exfat-utils\n\n\nAnother solution would be to format your card in NTFS (non open-source, but Ubuntu should be able to write it with ntfs-3g package installed) or EXT4 format (free open-source yeay!), but it depends on the use you have of the card. \nHere you can learn more about the various formats. \nTo change the format of your card, you can use a GUI programm like Gparted (root access needed) :\nsudo apt-get install gparted\n\n", "Q: run all command inside script with typing the password one time i want to write script inside the script i will do many commands that require to be root\nlike\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get install eclipse\n\nbut i want to write the password just one time \ni tried to write in top \nsudo su\n\nto run as root but it stop the script\nso what i can so to write the password\n\nA: The obvious solution: run the script as root\nsudo /your/script\n\nThen all commands in the script will be run as root.\nIf some commands don't need root, just use sudo to change back to a normal user\n\nA: If you have commands that don't require sudo, you might check out my answer on this question.\nFor brevity, though, here is a quick answer:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nPW=$1\n\necho $PW | apt-get update\necho $PW | apt-get upgrade\necho $PW | apt-get install eclipse\n\nRun with bash file_name.bash sudo_pw\nThe reason for passing it this way is people can't necessarily tell what the parameter you're passing means, so even if someone monitors in some way (even looking over your shoulder), it's still secure.\nThe primary reason I do this is because most of the commands I run with sudo create objects that need to be manipulated later on, and using sudo command will usually make them inaccessible, even if I sudo next_command. A simplistic example would be creating an Excel file and wanting to manipulate it with another process. Even running with sudo, most of the time, I can't access it again without overwriting it, which then recreates it as an inaccessible object.\nNote: This also works as a shell script as there is nothing BASH specific in the syntax, so you could use #!/bin/sh and ./file_name.sh sudo_pw instead, if that is your preference.\n", "Q: How to install SNMP I installed Ubuntu on my black BEAGLEBONE and now need to install SNMP, but use\napt-get install snmp snmpd and gives error. How to install SNMP?\n\nA: Before you typed sudo apt-get install did you type a sudo apt-get update first?\nI usually have this problem on a VPS that I use, after a fresh install i have to type the apt-get update and only then i can install packages.\n\nA: use these commands:\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install snmpd snmp\n\nAfter installation, you can view the service status with the following command:\nsudo service snmpd status\n\nfinally, you must configure snmp.

Is there something I can do to change that?\n\nA: Programs are only upgraded automatically if you installed them via\nsudo apt-get install <program>\n\nor the Software Center.\nIf you install if from another source (.deb, .tar.gz, etc.), you'll need to manage updates yourself.\nSometimes, you can find a PPA for the software which updates as long as the PPA maintainer updates it.\n", "Q: How to compile wireless driver for 13.10 im trying to compile a wireless driver for the Realtek RTL8812AU chipset.\ni got the tar file from github.\ni did a \"sudo make\" but i got some errors.\n\nAnd i would like to learn how to install it.\n\nA: First, there is no reason to use 'sudo make.'

In windows 7 I believe it may make a partition for boot if its installed first. Its also possible that you just need to shrink down one or both your partition’s to make free space. \n", "Q: blocksize error when mounting ufs drive in 12.10 I have an external hard drive that I was using with a NAS4FREE computer. The computer died, and I would like to use the files on the external hard drive. NAS4FREE is based on freebsd, so the external hard drive is formatted as ufs. \nI can almost get the external hard drive to mount on my Ubuntu 12.10 laptop. When I plug in the hard drive to my laptop, I am told that it didn't mount via a popup message. I check dmesg | tail and am informed that ufs filesystems can only be mounted in read-only mode. No problem, I input the mount command and give it the \"-r\" (that is, sudo mount -r -t  ufs -o ufstype=ufs2 /dev/sdb1 /media/wshareTest). It still doesn't mount, and dmesg | tail says \"UFS: failed to set blocksize\". The mountpoint exists, it's a mountpoint I'd created to test stuff with. Nothing is mounted there usually, only when I physically tell something to mount there is there anything there.\nThis is where I've been hitting a wall. As far as I can tell, the mount command doesn't have a blocksize setting for the ufs filetype. \nAny thoughts or ideas would be appreciated, thanks. \nedit: I realize I should include the output of fdisk -l.

I started downloading Ubuntu 12.04 LTS through Wubi installer and it shows nearly 10 hrs required for download. Disk space required is 18 GB which is readily available. Should it actually take that long to be downloaded?\n\nA: It completely depends on the speed of your internet connection.If you had highspeed internet connection then it would be downloaded within a hour.For slow connections it takes long time.\n\nA: It will vary depending on the capabilities of your internet connection, the capabilities of the server's internet connection, and whether you are using any of your internet bandwidth for other activities at the same time. My internet connection is rated at 1.5mbs which considered slow and is the bare minimum to qualify as highspeed internet. It takes me about 1 hour and 35-45 minutes to download 700mb of data if I can get a download speed of 150-180kbps which is usually as high as I can get unless I'm downloading from the itunes store in which case it's more around 360kbps.

Is it worth trying to re-install the Windows office suite?\nthanks :)\n\nA: Yes, you will keep windows and all your data if you select that option, when you turn on your computer the GRUB will ask what operative system you want to start, in my experience it's better if you have two hard disks or two partitions done before the installation, I tried to install Ubuntu and Windows 7 and the installation program had an error when creating the partition, so I recomend you to do so. You can import all your data from the another partition,from a usb pendrive or from internet,except your apps, some will have its version for Ubuntu and maybe you will have to look for some equivalent app. Libre Office is great, I used it before in Windows and now in Ubuntu and it works very well,it has improved a lot in the last years.\n\nA: First of all, yes you can install install Ubuntu without having to loose Windows or any of its DATA's only if you're installing to a separate/clean partition where Windows is not installed. Generally, Installing Ubuntu will only replace the GRUB (which is the boot loader for Linux) though it won't harm if you follow proper process. There are two methods to install Ubuntu, which are;\n\n\n*\n\n*Install inside windows using Wubi (Unfortunately its not compatible with Win 8 & does not support 13.10)\n\n*Install onto a separate partition (I personally & most users would recommended this)\n\n\nAssuming I've answered to the point 1; \nI found this article about SwitchingToUbuntu/FromWindows/TransferringFilesAndSettings, which may interest you on how to transfer your files as in your point 2.\nLibre Office is better but not like MS Office. Here's a comparison between both. In any case, you need MS Office within Ubuntu, you may also achieve this by using wine, an application to run windows compatible programs within Ubuntu. Installation predeceases can be found by searching here within this community.\nHope this clears all your questions which is asked.

When I do resolve it, I will post something here.]\n\nA: So, the final answer is a bit embarrassing, as I should have been able to figure it out, but I was looking in the wrong place. The crucial clue was in the question regarding the speed of the HDD -- tests indicated that it had slowed down as well.\nMy class that handles reading the data on disk has a default read size for its internal buffers. When doing random access this should be relatively small, because you aren't going to use any of the buffered data later. When performing operations across the full file sequentially, larger values give better performance because you will re-use the data. Given that this was a constant in a piece of shared code, tuning for one application using the code essentially broke the tuning for random access, thus causing the massive slowdown I was experiencing.\n", "Q: How to permanently set CPU power management to the powersave governor? I'm currently using this: \ncpupower frequency-set --governor powersave\n\nbut it resets after each reboot. \n\nA: For 16.04 there's one more step to add to Jayen's answer. The complete set of steps are\nsudo apt-get install cpufrequtils\necho 'GOVERNOR=\"powersave\"' | sudo tee /etc/default/cpufrequtils\nsudo update-rc.d ondemand disable\n\nThe last step disables the \"ondemand\" daemon, which would otherwise overwrite the changes created by cpufrequtils.\nSee also How I can disable CPU frequency scaling and set the system to performance?\nYou might also consider adding, for example, MAX_SPEED=\"2GHz\" to /etc/default/cpufrequtils if you have an overheating, say, 2.2GHz processor, to limit the maximum possible speed.\n\nA: To set the governor permanently to powersave, firstly install cpufrequtils:\nsudo apt-get install cpufrequtils\n\nAnd then edit the /etc/init.d/cpufrequtils file and change GOVERNOR to \"powersave\" (GOVERNOR=\"powersave\"). You can do this automatically by using the following command:\nsudo sed -i 's/^GOVERNOR=.*/GOVERNOR=\"powersave\"/' /etc/init.d/cpufrequtils\n\nFrom here: Prevent Your Laptop From Overheating With Thermald And Intel P-State\n\nA: Based on Alin's answer, but will persist when cpufrequtils is upgraded:\nTo set the governor permanently to powersave, firstly install cpufrequtils:\nsudo apt-get install cpufrequtils\n\nAnd then create/edit the /etc/default/cpufrequtils file (which is read from /etc/init.d/cpufrequtils) and set GOVERNOR=\"powersave\". You can do this automatically by using the following command:\necho 'GOVERNOR=\"powersave\"' | sudo tee /etc/default/cpufrequtils\n\nAnd if you are on Ubuntu 16.04 or later, you need to disable the built-in service that sets the governor to ondemand:\nsudo update-rc.d ondemand disable\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 3.13 Kernel update not working I started on Linux a week ago.

Seriously, I want to see some answers on this question, so if you will, please refrain from not answering this question if you know(or think you know) what went on with my computer. I'm tired of seeing my questions go unanswered.\nI was using my computer as I normally do, when my computer(Ubuntu + KDE) notified me that I was running low on available disk space(since my linux install is only 30 GB). Because of the message, I was going to go through my installed programs/games/files a bit later to get rid of anything that I have on my Ubuntu install that I don't use or can do without. \nI was doing some system setting changes, changing my splash screen and decided to restart my computer. upon returning to the login screen(KDM), it informed me that basically there was not enough free space to log me in to my Ubuntu installation on my computer. I thought to myself \"WTF?!?!?\". So basically, my first thought was to grab my copy of Puppy Linux that I already had on a Live CD, pop it into my computer and go through any pictures/music/downloads that I had on my computer I don't really need or can easily get back(from another drive I have), then go back and see if doing that was enough to be able to log in. Sure enough it was and I was able to log in.\nSo then as I logged in and this is where I started experiencing odd problems with KDE.\nFirst off, I had no window decorations/borders(window title bar with the minimize, maximize, close buttons), unable to type anything within the terminal(keyboard not working with he terminal), and most of the time couldn't type anything in the search box in the kickoff application launcher.\nLuckily, I had Cairo Dock which I was extremely fortunate that I was able to use my keyboard with it's terminal. My fist thought of why I had no window decorations/borders/title bar was because kwin was simply not running and needed to be restarted. So naturally I typed into to Cairo Dock's terminal \"kwin --replace\", it informed me that \"The program 'kwin' is currently not installed. You can install it by typing: sudo apt-get install kde-window-manager\". First off I was completely and utterly puzzled as to why it said that kwin wasn't installed. How?!?!? How could it not be installed when it came with KDE and I have never uninstalled it! So after typing in the command to install kwin, everything is back to it was before I was experiencing this problem. I later uninstalled some games in wine that I no longer needed to have installed in Ubuntu(because I have them on my Windows installation) and freed up more disk space.\nSO here are my questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I set up Ubuntu with KDE(or Ubuntu in general if desktop environments don't matter in this case) so that my computer will never run \"low enough\" on disk space that I will be unable to login?\n\n*Why was I unable to use my keyboard with KDE's terminal?\n\n*How on earth did kwin get uninstalled from my KDE installation when I did absolutely nothing to the installation of kwin that came with KDE by default?\n\nA: As I do not have enough information to write a comment, I am forced to write an answer.\nFirst of all, I see what you mean and often ran in the situation of having no space left, especially if experiment with small installs. \nI noticed different issues, but none of the issues 2. or 3. \nIn case of KDE Plasma for example suddenly all my desktop widgets were gone when I removed files in order to free space (and no, I did not remove the config files). \nFor explaining a few factors it would be important to know:\n\n\n*\n\n*what filesystem you were using\n\n*if you were using prelink (which can corrupt binaries in case of low space left)\n\n\nTo your first question: You could setup a root and a home partition, which does not solve the issue, but at least makes sure that nothing unexpected happens to the root partition if home is full. \nIn case you cannot login anymore: You do not need another live cd: Just log-in in a virtual terminal: (By pressing Ctrl + Alt + F1) and make space free.\nI think the warnings of too less space available are there for some reason. You cannot simply restrict disk space so that still for example 3 MB would be free but not writable. What difference would the latter make? You cannot write it anymore anyway, which is required by X to log in as user. \n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu 12.04 LTS I have a separate machine Dell 1545 laptop. I was wondering how to have  a full install using 12.04 LTS on my Vista machine? Can I just put the burned ISO disc in the disc tray and restart then go into Bios- selecting Boot from CD or is it more different than that? I Do Not want to Dual Boot!\nThanks.\n\nA: Copy pasted from: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/install-desktop-long-term-support\nIt’s easy to install Ubuntu from a CD. Here’s what you need to do:\nPut the Ubuntu CD into the CD/DVD-drive.\nRestart your computer. You should see a welcome screen prompting you to choose your language and giving you the option to install Ubuntu or try it from the CD.\nIf you don't get this menu, read the booting from the CD guide for more information.\nUsing a USB drive?\nMost newer computers can boot from USB. You should see a welcome screen prompting you to choose your language and giving you the option to install Ubuntu or try it from the CD.\nIf your computer doesn’t automatically do so, you might need to press the F12 key to bring up the boot menu, but be careful not to hold it down - that can cause an error message.\n2\nPrepare to install Ubuntu\nWe recommend you plug your computer into a power source\nYou should also make sure you have enough space on your computer to install Ubuntu\nWe advise you to select Download updates while installing and Install this third-party software now\nYou should also stay connected to the internet so you can get the latest updates while you install Ubuntu\nIf you're not connected to the internet, we'll help you set up wireless at the next step\n\n3\nSet up wireless\nIf you are not connected to the internet, you will be asked to select a wireless network, if available. We advise you to connect during the installation so we can ensure your machine is up to date. So, if you set up your wireless network at this point, it’s worth then clicking the Back button to go back to the last screen (Preparing to install Ubuntu) and ticking the box marked ‘Download updates while installing’.\n4\nAllocate drive space\nUse the checkboxes to choose whether you'd like to Install Ubuntu alongside another operating system, delete your existing operating system and replace it with Ubuntu, or — if you're an advanced user — choose the 'Something else' option\n5\nBegin the installation\nDepending on your previous selections, you can now verify that you have chosen the way in which you would like to install Ubuntu. The installation process will begin when you click the Install Now button.\nUbuntu needs about 4.5 GB to install, so add a few extra GB to allow for your files.\nNot sure about this step? Windows users can use the Windows installer, which will install and uninstall Ubuntu in the same way as any other Windows application. It's simpler and completely safe.\n6\nSelect your location\nIf you are connected to the internet, this should be done automatically. Check your location is correct and click 'Forward' to proceed. If you're unsure of your time zone, type the name of the town you're in or click on the map and we'll help you find it.\nTIP: If you’re having problems connecting to the Internet, use the menu in the top-right-hand corner to select a network.\n7\nSelect your preferred keyboard layout\nClick on the language option you need. If you’re not sure, click the ’Detect Keyboard Layout’ button for help.\n8\nEnter your login and password details\n9\nLearn more about Ubuntu while\nthe system installs…\n…or make a cup of tea!\n10\nThat’s it.\nAll that’s left is to restart your computer and start enjoying Ubuntu!\n\nA: If you are not interested in dual boot with vista 7. I'd recommend you to check the option erase disk and install ubuntu 12.04 and just follow the instructions.\nI'd Recommend you to have a working internet connection since you might have to install the latest updates for your system.\nAnd If there is a graphics card in your system make sure you install the driver otherwise you may heat up your system.\n", "Q: How to install picasa with wine Whenever I try to install picasa with wine it get this,\nmr-yeomans@mryeomans-Dell-DE051:~$ wine ~/picasa39-setup.exe  \nfixme:wininet:InternetLockRequestFile STUB\nfixme:wininet:CommitUrlCacheEntryInternal entry already in cache - don't know what to do!\nwine: Unhandled page fault on read access to 0x00000008 at address 0x7e5585e3 (thread 0029), starting debugger...\nwinedbg: Internal crash at 0x7e8685e3\nmr-yeomans@mryeomans-Dell-DE051:~$ \n\nI don't know where to go on this.\n\nA: The easiest way to do this is by using playonlinux.

I then changed the view layout from, \"Folder\" to \"Default Desktop\" and then clicking apply.\nI was then able switch back to \"Folder\" as my view layout and whatever settings had created the calendar had been wiped.\nSorry, this does seem like a hack but it worked for me.  I am sure there is a setting somewhere that just removes it but like you I was unable to find it.\n\nA: I was able to clean it up by just killing and restarting the desktop:\nkillall plasma-desktop && plasma-desktop &\n\n(This will restart the desktop, but your applications should keep running)\nThis happens to me when the panel is moved to the left or right side of the screen, then resized to be big enough that a calendar appears in the panel.

If the widgets are on the desktop, you have different options:\nIf you hover over them, clicking the X on the applet handle will remove them;\n      If you use the Add Widget dialog, you can click on the minus symbol icon next to the widget name to remove it. \n\nThere is also some more info in relation to widgets on this page.\nYou may also find it useful to look at the general widget settings. Plasma Settings\n\nTo see the widgets that are installed on your system and ready to use open the Plasma Widget Explorer by either opening the Desktop Toolbox in the upper right corner of the screen and selecting Add Widgets, opening the Panel Toolbox furthest to the right in the Panel and selecting Add Widgets, or right clicking on the Desktop and choosing Add Widgets from the context menu. To place a widget on the Desktop simply drag it from the Widget Explorer to the Desktop. To place a widget in the panel first open the Panel Toolbox and from there open the Widget Explorer (click Add Widgets), locate the widget you wish to add and drag it to the desired position in the Panel. \n\nFinally this is a link from the Ubuntu help pages.

Check in /home/ for any other directorys.\nIf it really is gone (and you happen to have no backup), go boot up a live cd immediately.

Since Ubuntu can read from the Windows-partition (all Windows-files are accessible using Ubuntu), but Windows can't read from Ubuntu's ext4-partition, I will use the Windows-partition for both Windows system files and other files such as pictures and local videos, and the Ubuntu partition only for system files and installed programs. \nTo the question: \n\n\n*\n\n*Is there any way I can redirect the Nautiles library folder's to point to C:/Users/Windows-user instead of default home/users/ ?. \n\n*Also, the recommended space of Ubuntu is 30 gigabyte, but today, my Ubuntu system (wothout other other files) takes 10 gb, with some programs installed. Maybe 20 gigabytes are enough? But I don't want to have any problems in the future, with need of repartitioning the drive to increase the amount of space and delete my Windows-installation. \n\n\nAny thoughts? Thanks in advance.\nComputer: Dell Latitude D630, 64-bit compatible.\nSSD: Logitech SSDNow V-300, 120 gigabyte\n\nA: Ubuntu recommends 30 GB :\nAs usual, it depends on what you will do with your system. 8 GB is enough, but some programs may take a lot of space (Google-chrome cache, for instance). My everyday installation with a lot of programs takes only 7,6 GB. And I don't really think I'll need more than that for the system only. \nUsing 20 GB would be the best choice for you, in my opinion. I'll explain why in the second point. \nRedirect /home/user/ to C:/Users/Windowsuser :\nYou can't have your Home partition on a NTFS disk, NTFS can't read permissions the way Linux was meant to. You will have to use you /home/user on an EXT4 partition. \nAnd because Ubuntu stores a lot of configuration files in your /home/user, you will need some space (mine takes now 800 MB, but I used to have 10 GB and more when I used Wine to emulate Windows Programs. \nBut, fortunately, you can make a \"shortcut\" that points C:/Users/WindowsUser to you /home/user using the symbolic link feature :\nln --help returns: \nln [OPTION]... TARGET LINK_NAME : create a link to TARGET with the name LINK_NAME.\n\nSo, let's say you want to link /home/user/Music to C:/Users/WindowsUser/Music, you can do that easily. First, mount your NTFS partition on Ubuntu, then :\nln /path-to-your-mounted-ntfs-partition/Users/WindowsUser/Music /home/user/Music\n-> where /path-to-your-mounted-ntfs-partition is the path of your mounted ntfs partition. \nUsing this, you will have a /home/user on your EXT4 partition, allowing Ubuntu to store the needed files and their permission, and in this folder, you'll have shortcuts to your NTFS partition (more precisely to your WindowsUser folder). \n", "Q: What is the role of a Bug reporter? What is the role of a Bug reporter in reporting bugs and after reporting bugs?

For instance, he/she wouldn't get any benefits of bug report if he/she didn't update his system. So he/she should do something.

Reporting bugs don't help you at that time; but may help them to make it easier to find bugs.\nAlso, Ubuntu is now Open source. So anyone who has some knowledge about how to fix the bug can contribute to fix it, and such persons are called Bug Fixers.\nReporting Bugs help them to understand that some users are experiencing an issue and it needs to be resolved.

During the last month Ubuntu starts having some problems: it shuts down suddenly without any apparent reason.. I figured out that the problem is in the hard disk, if I run this command:\n$ sudo badblocks -sv -b 512 /dev/sda\n\nI get 24 bad blocks all in the Linux partition (I have Windows in another one and it does not have the same problem). The question is if there is a way (different from changing the disk) for avoiding this shutting down. Maybe isolating the bad blocks?\n\nA: If a disk has bad sectors (that is what bad blocks detects) then it will still work. Hard disks have extra sectors on them that are automatically remapped so the disk will continue to work.\nIn Ubuntu you can use Disks (in older versions is was call Disk Utility) to check on the SMART status of the disk. It can give predictive failure information. \nUsing a utility like SpinRite you can check the disk and definitely find out if they are bad or not. If run at the highest level it will check every sector and reinstate any sectors that are marked bad when they are actually okay, and mark any that should be bad.\nIf the disk is on the way out I would replace it rather than take any chances.\n\nA: By the time you start seeing bad blocks in utilities like badblocks, the disk is already unsafe to use. The badblocks utility was written in another era, before disks could automatically remap a few bad sectors, as quaeritate describes; it's not really very useful today, except perhaps as a very short-term band-aid solution. If the disk has bad blocks, replace it immediately.\n", "Q: Taskbar and panel icons disappearing On Ubuntu 13.10, after installing VirtualBox Guest Additions, my taskbar and panel icons disappeared and do not come back after a restart.\n\nA: Opening a terminal and running the following commands will restart the panel:\ngconftool --recursive-unset /apps/panel\nrm -rf ~/.gconf/apps/panel\npkill gnome-panel\n\nSource: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=766281\n", "Q: Identify all deleted files and folders in the command line I have an ext3 image that I am working on for school.

I believe I need to use the blkcat command but I am unsure of the parameters that I need?\n\nA: Can you speak with the dead?\n\nAlmost the same it is happening with deleted files... Pretty much impossible. When a file is deleted, it's simply gone. On most systems, this is not logged anywhere.\nIf you're using rm from the command line, the system does not generally ask for confirmation before removing files.\nIf you deleted files using a GUI tool, they may still be in some kind of \"trash can\".

To watch for deleted files and folder use the following command:\ninotifywait -m -r -e delete dir_name > deleted_files.log\n\nto log the deleted files from dir_name directory in deleted_files.log file.\nTo install inotifywait, use:\nsudo apt-get install inotify-tools\n\nSource: How to find which files and folders were deleted recently in Linux?\n\nA: It sounds like you are talking about the forensic tools from The Sleuth Kit (TKS). There is a sleuthkit package that is available from the standard Ubuntu repository, so your first step would be making sure that is installed. Probably the fls tool is a better starting point than blkcat:\nDESCRIPTION\n       fls lists the files and directory names in the image  and  can  display\n       file  names of recently deleted files for the directory using the given\n       inode.  If the inode argument is not given, the  inode  value  for  the\n       root directory is used. For example, on an NTFS file system it would be\n       5 and on a Ext3 file system it would be 2.\n\nAfter that I really can't help you but there is an online wiki, and this article Why Recovering a Deleted Ext3 File Is Difficult should get you started.\n", "Q: Available computer-assisted translation (CAT) software for Ubuntu Does anyone know any good (if any) computer-assisted translation (CAT) software for Ubuntu 13.10?\n\nA: The list is quite extensive.

Let's say my internal IP is 192.168.0.1 \nAnd my external is 2.222.333.444 \n1.222.333.444 is dynamic and monitered everytime it changes to the hostname www.website.com \nI want to link my external ip so that when I connect the hostname, it goes: \nwww.website.com > 2.222.333.444 > 192.168.0.1 \n\nA: First, you need to register your domain (www.my-website.com) with a DNS provider that provides API access, such as Amazon Web Services (Route 53). \nThen you need to have a little script on your home network that continuously checks your public IP, e.g. like the following bash command.\nwget -O - -q icanhazip.com. \nThe script should detect if the IP has changed (different to cached value) and if so, uses the IP in an an API request to update the nameserver records.\nFinally, you need to use port-forwarding on your router to route incoming requests to the static IP that you want to have handle the request, e.g. 192.168.0.1. You will also need to keep your computers private IP the same by either setting static IPs or configuring whatever is providing your DHCP service (usually your \"home hub\"). Unfortunately all hubs have different features so I cannot help you there. For example, my BT hub can map the port forwarding to devices based on the MAC rather than to IP's, so you can still have a dynamic static IP.\nI recommend AWS purely becuase they have lots of SDKs that accommodate a variety of languages, so you are likely to find one for your preferred language, however you would need to set up an account and it's not \"free as in beer\".\n\nI only just noticed you have tagged the question \"minecraft\", in which case I highly recommend that instead you just get a VPS as this will have a much better upload speed as well as a much more reliable internet connection. e.g. the VPS will have a static IP so you won't have any downtime whilst nameservers get updated. It is also slightly more difficult to take a minecraft server offline with a DDoS attack than a home connection, depending on the provider you go with (some even offer DDoS protection as a product, which is beyond the scope of this answer).\nIf however you decide to continue down the home-hosting route, you will need to forward TCP port 25565 to your private IP on your router for Minecraft unless you change the default port on your server.\n\nA: Easy as 1, 2, 3...\n\n*\n\n*Subscribe to a DNS service\n\n*Install a DNS updater on your local network\n\n*Route incoming traffic to desired computer\n\nSubscribe to a DNS service\nA Domain Name Server, or DNS, maps IP (external) addresses to domain names. While it is possible to create your own DNS, its best to leave this to the pro's such as:\n\n*\n\n*DYN Remote access - This is what I use, $25 a year. You may provide your own domain name or select a sub-domain from one of there many domain's the own, (yourchoice.homedns.org). You're can route 31 different IPs.\n\n*no-ip - Has a three verison that can route 3 IPs, and you must use their domain names. Pay for version is $19. I've never used them, but they are very popular.\n\n*Amazon Route 53 - $0.50 per hosted zone / month for the first 25 hosted zones. Probably the cheapest route if you only need to route 1 IP.\n\nYou can't go wrong, just choose one and sign up! For more information on DNS see:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System\nInstall a DNS updater on your local network\nEach of the above DNS service providers will provide software you can install that will automatically send your external IP address to their servers. This tools work well although your computer must always be one in-order to send the updates.\nI however, would strongly suggest using your router instead, they consume little power, are always on, and more reliable then a computer. Most routers will allow you to insert your dyn (or other services) username and password, and it will do the rest. Some ISPs provide routers/modems that are unable/unwilling to do this. If this is your (or anyone else's case) just comment and I'll include those instructions.\nAfter your either enter your credentials on your router or install an update client, log into your DNS account on you provider of choice's website and verify it is all working.\nRoute incoming traffic to desired computer\nYour home network most likely has a router which is responsible for router incoming/outgoing traffic through certain ports through the router's firewall. The basic steps are:\n\n*\n\n*Determine required ports to forward. This is dependent upon the type of application, and who wrote the software, and how it is configured, but for mindcraft you need 25565. portforward.com provides resources for many applications.\n\n\n*Log into your router\n\n\n*Assign your computer a fixed IP address (you may use DHCP if it is capable of forwarding to a MAC address\n\n\n*Forward desired ports to IP / MAC address\nAdditional Resources\nThis answer is meant to provide a broad overview of the required major steps, not the nitty-griddy detail.

If I have to download 64 bit version for my Intel PC (which has a 64 bit processor), which one should I download?\n\nA: Here is the link for 64bit (AMD) download and you can install in intel also\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop\nAll Intel Core 2 Duo and Intel Core i3, i5 and i7 support either 32 Bit or 64 bit. You will not have a problem with this. With what you might have a problem is with the amount of memory you need. For 32 Bit the minimum for a good running system is 512MB, the maximum is 4GB. For 64Bit the minimum recommended is 2GB and the maximum is \"let your imagination fly!!!\". I have tested 64Bit versions on 1GB and they can run very slow sometimes. The more memory the better.\nIf your Core 2 Duo laptop has at least 4 GB of ram I would recommend 64 bit but since it is a laptop and the more memory you have in a 64 bit the better, I would recommend sticking with the 32 Bit version. You actually don't loose to try both but for your case I would go more with the 32 Bit version (Except if it is some kind of 4GB+ Ram Laptop).\n\nA: 32 and 64 bit go with several different names, listed below:\n32 bit\ni386\ni586\ni686\nx86\n\n64 bit\namd64\nx86_64\n\n\nSo, to answer your question, \"ubuntustudio-12.04.3-dvd-i386.iso\" is 32 bit because it has i386 in it.\nTo download the 64 bit version, get a .iso file with one of the 64 bit names in its filename.\n", "Q: How to make a script that backup System in Ubuntu 12.04?

Create a bootable USB, install wipe and wipe everything\nsudo apt-get install wipe\n\n\n\n*\n\n*RestrictedFormats - Community Ubuntu Documentation\n\nA: The community here on AskUbuntu would be more than happy to help you with any issues you have with Ubuntu, and can get Ubuntu running the way it should. If you're simply not satisfied with Ubuntu, I would recommend checking out the link Florian gave to get Windows back on your computer.\nI'll address some of the issues you mentioned. For example, you said that you couldn't play DVDs. This is likely because Ubuntu doesn't ship with any video codecs installed in Totem, the default video player. This is because the codecs are typically proprietary. I recommend getting VLC Media Player. It's served me well, and comes loaded with it's own decoder. You can get it in the Software Center, through Synaptic, or by opening a terminal and typing sudo apt-get install vlc.\nAs for not being able to run Windows programs with PlayOnLinux, you actually would use an application called WINE to run Windows programs. You can get it by opening a terminal and typing sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-wine/ppa, followed by sudo apt-get update, and then sudo apt-get install wine1.7. WINE is a pretty large package, so it might take a while to download. Once that's finished, you will be able to install and run most Windows programs as they were originally intended.\nFinally, if you're still not happy, I recommend firing up you're live drive (the LiveCD or USB drive you installed Ubuntu with) and opening up gparted, the partition editor. When it's open, delete both the ext4 and linux-swap partitions. If you want to, you can fill in the unallocated space with an ntfs partition, and then running the installation of Windows.\nThe reason the Windows installation said that you have no disk space is because Windows cannot read ext4 or swap partition types, so to it, those were unreadable spaces on your hard drive that it can't format or use, and there was no unallocated space to throw down an ntfs partition in.\nHopefully this helped. Remember, if you ever want to stick around with Ubuntu, there's a ton of fine people here who will always welcome your questions. :)\n", "Q: How do I make a DCHP server? I want to finish making a minecraft server (TCP/UDP)\nI already have a system that uses a private ip of 192.168.0.9\nAnd a DNS on it that uses the public ip of 2.220.217.108, then redirects to it from helloworld.dyndns.org with ddclient\nBut when I start the server it lets me connect on minecraft through the internal ip but not the public ip or the hostname? The server uses port 25565 but I always get connection refused if I attempt to connect with the hostname or public ip?\nI can connect to the server in my web browser but although the config is correct (as far as I know) I can't connect to it on minecraft, also even when I connect from the public ip it doesn't say if anyone attempted to connect to the server and was refused. Was this because the connection didn't get past the public ip or hostname firewall?\nMaybe it's because my config in /etc/network/interfaces isn't right?\nI am not able to use a static ip address in the config because my isp doesn't offer it\n/etc/network/interfaces:\n# This file describes the network interfaces available on your system\n# and how to activate them. For more information, see interfaces(5).\n\n# The loopback network interface\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\n# The primary network interface\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet dhcp\n        post-up iptables-restore < /etc/iptables.up.rules\n\n\nA: I am going to start my answer by clarifying some facts/assumptions I pulled from your question:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your domain name is helloworld.dyndns.org \n\n*helloworld.dyndns.org points to public IP 2.220.217.108 (this I tested and know)\n\n*2.220.217.108 is your home IP.\n\n*The computer you are running a minecraft server on, has a private IP of 192.168.0.9 inside your home network.\n\n\nCongrats, the good news is that you only have one more step and it does not require setting up a new DHCP server, rather just setting up port-forwarding on your router/hub, and optionally tweaking its DHCP settings.\nAll that remains is to set up port forwarding on your \"home hub\" (router). Unfortunately, every router I have seen has a different interface and feature set, but 99% of the time there is an \"advanced\" are you may need to log into, and then there should be a tab/menu called \"port forwarding\" where you just need to specify the IP/MAC/Hostname of your computer (192,168.0.9) and the port you want to forward (TCP 25565)\n\nDHCP Settings\nYou can optionally tweak the DHCP settings on the router to prevent your private internal IP of your minecraft server (192.168.0.9) from changing (assuming its set to DHCP and not statically set). However minecraft should still work in the meantime. This is just to prevent you having to re-set up port forwarding every time your internal IP changes. It is best not to manually set your private IP to an address in the same range as the DHCP pool of your router as this can (low risk) lead to an IP clash (two devices using the same IP)\nThus the easiest solution is to check the IP range of the DHCP pool (shown below) and set your server's IP to something that is in the same subnet but not the same address pool. 192.168.1.1 - 192.168.1.63 in the picture below:\n\nEither that, or some routers allow you to manually set a static/reserved IP from within the DHCP pool to a device based on its MAC/hostname.\nReference Material - Minecraft Wiki - Setting Up A Server\n", "Q: SSH: Connection refused from windows but NOT from linux I have an issue when I try connecting to my Ubuntu server from local network. when I try to connect from my PC (static IP) with win7 and putty, I get\nNetwork error:connection refused\n\nBut when I connect from my smartphone, everything is OK.

I am learning about Graphical User Interfaces in Ubuntu and constantly come across different terms, which cause a lot of confusion for me. I have tried reading easy-to-understand tutorials about the relationship between the named packages, but I don't have a complete picture.\nLightDM appears as a service on my installation and is a 'Window Manager', how is this related to Compiz, which is also a Window Manager but not a service? Is Metacity also a Window Manager?\nThen there comes Gnome 3, Unity, Gnome Shell and Gnome - all of which seem to be different things. Please help me understand the relationship between all this terminology.\n\nA: You only need to know 4 terms:\n\n*\n\n*Display manager\n\n*Window Manager\n\n*Graphical User Interfaces (GUI)\n\n*Desktop Environments\n\nDisplay manager\nExamples are LightDM, GDM, KDM, and LXDM. They normally have display manager somewhere in their names.  These start the X server at boot and provide a login screen.  They often let you select a window manager and/or desktop environment as part of logging in.\nWindow Manager\nCompiz, Metacity, Mutter, W9dk, fluxbox are window managers. There are too many to list.  If you want you can check all the packages that provide x-window-manager to get an incomplete list of the window managers in Ubuntu. These only are responsible of drawing the application borders, managing the position of the windows, themes and decorations.\nGrapical User Interfaces (GUI)\nAnything that the user interacts with in any graphical way, with icons and representations. Window Managers, Display Manager and Graphical shells, applications, etc. falls in this category. Whatever the user is using that is represented predominantly in a graphical way is a GUI.\nDesktop Environments\nIn the Linux world, it's referred to as a set of applications, packages, services, etc. that provides a complete and balanced ecosystem for the user. Unlike Window Manager or Desktop Manager, Desktop Environments take care of everything. From the login screen through your mail application, the network manager, text editor, the system settings, image viewer, file manager, etc. There are 4 well known Desktop Environments in Linux and Ubuntu:\n\n*\n\n*GNOME\n\n*KDE Desktop Environment\n\n*LXDE: Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment\n\n*XFCE Desktop Environment\n\nThese all have a complete set of applications, settings, services, desktop/file/window managers, internet browser, etc.\n\nSo, to address your specifics concerns:\n\nLightDM appears as a service on my installation and is a 'Window Manager'\n\nFalse, LightDM is a Display Manager.\n\nhow is this related to Compiz, which is also a Window Manager but not a service?\n\nHave nothing in common. Both have different functions. Compiz is a window composer, window decorator, a window manager.\n\nIs Metacity also a Window Manager?\n\nYes.\n\nThen there comes Gnome 3, Unity, Gnome Shell and Gnome - all of which seem to be different things.\n\nGnome 3, Gnome Shell and Gnome are terms used colloquially as the same thing. Unity is totally different. Unity is another shell opposed to Gnome/3/Shell. Gnome 3 Shell has been commonly called as Gnome Shell in the past, right now saying GNOME, GNOME 3 Desktop Environment or Gnome Shell carry the same meaning.\n", "Q: Install Ubuntu on 64-bit PC alongside Win7; Will Ubuntu see Windows partition? Acer w/ AMD Athlon 64 x2 dual core 3800+ 2.00 GHz, 4 gig RAM, 32 bit Windows 7, originally built for Windows Vista. Added an NVIDIA graphics card.  \n1 TB barracuda hard drive partitioned into 3, 1 partition [201GB] set aside for Ubuntu, \nWin 7 on one and files on the third. \nI want to put Ubuntu 12.04 LTS on the empty partition to work alongside Windows. Am also concerned, as I read that Ubuntu 64bit may not see the existing Windows installation – especially if it is a 32 bit program. \nCan anyone tell me the safest and most effective means of installation ? \n\nA: Thanks to Kevin Wyamn who answered this at Installing Ubuntu 12.04 along Windows XP and Windows 7\nYou can install Ubuntu alongside Windows 7 just fine. Assuming you're trying to go the easiest route, boot from your Ubuntu LIVE DVD/USB and select \"Install Ubuntu\".\nIn the very early steps it will ask you what you want to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Ubuntu Alongside [existing Operating System/s]. This will\nreplace Windows MBR bootloader with GRUB/GRUB2 bootloader. USE THIS\n\n*Replace [existing Operating System/s] with Ubuntu (this will format\nyour entire drive and install Ubuntu). Like above, this will include\nthe GRUB/GRUB2 bootloader.\n\n*Something Else (this is for if you have created a partition\nexplicitly for Ubuntu with the appropriate file format [ext4] and\nwant to install Ubuntu here). This is a bit trickier though because\nthe installer will expect the drive to be bootable.\nYou'll be presented with a menu [GRUB/GRUB2] during the boot process (as long as there is more than one Operating System present) that will allow you to choose which operating system you want to start up from. \n", "Q: How to connect to WiFi on Asus F5RL? I recently installed Ubuntu 12.04.4 LTS with Xfce 4.10 on my Asus F5RL AP033C laptop.

However, the CPU you select, since that generation of Intel CPUs also include the GPU, will determine the exact driver to select at http://www.intel.com/support/graphics/sb/cs-010512.htm \nTo enable SNA, you have to modify or create /etc/X11/xorg.conf to add the following:\nSection \"Device\"\nIdentifier \"Card0\"\nDriver \"intel\"\nOption \"AccelMethod\" \"sna\"\nEndSection\n\nAfter doing this, reboot. You can check SNA is running by opening up a terminal and entering:\ngrep -i sna /var/log/Xorg.0.log\nIf there is output from the above command, then SNA is running.\n\nA: The best way to know is to try it on a live cd or usb key.

Thank you for your help.\n\nA: \nI have a laptop that I set a BIOS password on and have since forgotten. (...) So I'm wondering if I were to take the HDD out of the laptop and set it up in an External HDD enclosure and format that and install Ubuntu onto it from another computer and then put it back in my laptop, if that will work to install it instead of continuing the fiddle wit he BIOS password.\n\nIt sounds like you're assuming the BIOS password is somehow stored on the hard drive, which is incorrect. If you do what you suggest, the BIOS will still be password protected. Your primary problem here is how to get rid of the BIOS password, and your proposed solution will not work. I'd guess that you probably need to get the motherboard battery out in order to reset the BIOS memory.\nFurthermore, this question is in no way Ubuntu related. The first sentence tells the story:\n\nI have a laptop that I set a BIOS password on and have since forgotten.\n\nThe BIOS is independent of what operating system you may or may not have on your harddrive.\n\nA: Boot using Ubuntu live CD on the other desktop. Install Ubuntu on that drive mounted as external. Ubuntu installer support USB drives.\nJust avoid installing 3rd party proprietary drivers till you boot from target host. Most problems coming from Graphic drivers like NVidia & AMD/ATI ones.\n\nA: This is something that you can do, as the Linux kernel is maiden to support many different kind of material.

(Note that ClamTK GUI app has a versioning separated from the core clam deamon/clamscan, which is on version 0.98 something.)\nFirst of all, I would recommend downloading and installing the latest ClamTK version (currently v5.05) from http://code.google.com/p/clamtk/ (choose the Debian .deb package and allow Gdebi or Ubuntu software centre to install, either will probably start when you choose to open the file). The GUI of version 5 is much richer than of the v4 series.\nWhen opening ClamTK GUI, you should select \"Update Assistant\" and choose \"I would like to update signatures myself\" (unless you have manually set up a cron job or similar). Ubuntu does not automatically update the clam AV signatures (as far as I know...not happened on any of my systems).\nAfter having selected the manual option above, go back to the home screen of ClamTK, then select \"Scheduler\". You will now get another window allowing you to set a time of the day for your computer to check/update signatures (virus definitions). The same window will also allow you to schedule a daily scan of your home directory.\nFinally, you should go back to the home screen of ClamTK and click \"Settings\". In this window, you should also tick (enable) the option \"Check for updates to this program\". (Unless you realise a performance issue, you should tick all options in order to stay as safe as possible.)\nHope this was helpful!\n:-) alfs\n\nA: Based on reading other posts, ClamTK runs a service that updates freshclam so you don't have to manually do that.  If you want to update the GUI, open ClamTK and click on \"Home\" which takes you to the version downloads.  Select the version for your Linux system and save to file.  It may work on other systems to take the default of \"Open with Software Install\" but it didn't work on Ubuntu 20.04.  I had to save the file to downloads and then run with software installer once downloaded.  In this case the .deb file will open the app installer with \"Remove\" for your old version, then launch the file again to install the new version.  Sudo apt-get install clamtk will give you version 6.02 and the current version is 6.06.  Again, this is only for the GUI.  If you have ClamTK you don't need to manually update the signatures (ClamAV) unless you have specified manual update in the settings.\n", "Q: Desktop enviroments for Ubuntu Does anyone know if Canonical will ever release Ubuntu with more then one (Unity, which is currently official) desktop environment like Linux Mint does (Cinnamon,MATE,Xfce)?\n\nA: This question would be best answered by someone from Canonical but till then ...\nCanonical's focus seems to be on \"convergence\": having as close to the same experience across form factors.

Using 'Restart' from either Ubuntu or Windows will still result in audio problem on Windows, though.\nSo it's not ideal, but it works for me (i.e. I only use Windows for playing games, and it's a just a small nuisance to shutdown and power on for Windows only).\n", "Q: Restore GRUB after creation of a NTFS partition? I have a desktop machine (HP Pavilion Slimline s5-1020) that came with Windows 7 and I installed Ubuntu 13.10 beside it. Used to boot into either OS just fine, until I pulled a really stupid trick (>.<)\nWhat I had before Ubuntu 13.10 was my 105 Mb System Part., 600 Gb C:\\ Part., 300 Gb Extra Files Part. (used as shared on my network), and the last fraction was HP Restoration.\nIn order to install Ubuntu, I decided I'd condense my Extra Files into a folder on my C:\\ Part. and use that 300 Gb for Ubuntu. This setup worked well until I decided I wanted my Extra Files Part. back...\nBooted into Windows 7, I used EaseUS Partition Master to split my 600 Gb C:\\ Part. in half and use the new 300 Gb Part. as my Extra Files space. After EaseUS PM rebooted the system, ran pre-OS to set up the partitions, and restarted the system again, I get a message:\n\"error: file '/boot/grub/i386-pc/normal.mod' not found.\nEntering rescue mode...\ngrub rescue> _\"\nI have no idea what to do from here and I'm thinking that if  I can delete that new partition and add it back to C:\\, it should work like before and I'll just get an external HDD to run on my network as file storage.\nHow would I go about deleting my new Part. and adding it back to C:\\? I tried GParted in my LiveUSB for Ubuntu (From which I installed) and it can't do anything... It says something about needing the Part. to be unmounted (even though it already appears unmounted). Is there a way I could \"boot\" EaseUS PM from a CD and use that to revert back?\nIs there some other way of doing this?\n\nA: What worked for my situation was to use Edwin's suggestion of using this Ubuntu wiki help page on restoring GRUB in dual boot with windows Vista/XP/7 and just reinstalling Grub to my HDD from LiveUSB by following the steps on that site.

I used bootRepair to repair common problems. The BIOS is set to boot from the primary drive. It boots to the selection window and allows selection of either the Linux or Windows, both of which boot normally.\nHOWEVER, I if I pull the drive caddy and put the DVD device back in the system will not boot (grub rescue).

You can run lsblk -l to check for the correct letter, it might be something like sdb or sdc, I think. (If in doubt, just edit the question to add the output of lsblk -l.)\nReboot (with caddy plugged) and make sure that grub loads correctly and lets you boot both OS's correctly (check booting Ubuntu then check booting Windows).\nTake out the caddy and restore the Windows bootloader on the primary drive (look at this help article for that).

Fixed\n  block deduplication takes fixed blocks of data and hashes those\n  blocks. Variable block deduplication attempts to find natural breaks\n  within stream of data an creates variable blocks at those break\n  points.\nFixed block deduplication is performed at volume defined fixed byte\n  buffers within SDFS. These fixed blocks are defined when the volume is\n  created and is set at 4k by default but can be set to a maximum value\n  of 128k. Fixed block deduplication is very useful for active\n  structured data such as running VMDKs or Databases. Fixed block\n  deduplication is simple to perform and can therefore be very fast for\n  most applications.\nVariable block deduplication is performed using Rabin Window Borders\n  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabin_fingerprint). SDFS uses fixed\n  buffers of 128k and then runs a rolling hash across that buffer to\n  find natural breaks. The minimum size of a variable block is 4k and\n  the maximum size is 128k. Variable block deduplication is very good at\n  finding deduplicate blocks in unstructured data such as uncompressed\n  tar files and documents. Variable Block deduplication typically will\n  create blocks of 10k-16k. This makes Variable block deduplication more\n  scalable than fixed block deduplication when it is performed at 4k\n  block sizes. The downside of Variable block deduplication is that it\n  can be computationally intensive and sometimes slower for write\n  processing.\nVariable block deduplication can only enabled when the volume is\n  created using the --hash-type=VARIABLE_MURMUR3.\n\n", "Q: Broadcom wireless and Realtec audio driver problem in linux mint 16 petra How can I install my wireless and audio driver in Linux mint using command line ? \n\nA: To install Wireless driver:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Driver manger from Administration\n\n*Select bcmwl-kernal-source\n\n*Click “Apply changes” (requires a few minutes, depending on your network speed)\n\n\nAnother way to install wireless driver:\nYou are required to connect to the Internet with the LAN interface before proceeding.\n\n\n*\n\n*After successfully installing LMDE, you have to update it first prior to installing the driver.\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\n\n\n*After a successful update, we can now install the desired driver for our Broadcom wireless card:\nsudo apt-get install b43-fwcutter firmware-b43-installer\n\nAll you have to do is wait for the installation to finish and you will be able to use the Broadcom wifi card.\nHere's an update if you're trying to install the driver on a netbook with low-power b43 chipset:\nsudo apt-get install b43-fwcutter firmware-b43-lpphy-installer\n\nUpdating my LMDE with the latest kernel had my Broadcom wireless messed up.

This will direct the user to specified directory. Login as the user and see whether it points to **/var/www/sitename.com by also checking for any permission issues.

E.g. mxtoolbox\nThe reason for asking, is that i can't see any client restrictions for your server. Implying that it might have ran as an semi open relay, that will easily get you blacklisted. \nTo get a bounce after you have transmitted data, is a common way to throttle spam senders. So the error is possible caused by the hyperlink to trig the spam threshold at the receiving server.\nSpam thresholds is often a measurement made different from every organization running a service. It exist some golden rules that will make it easier to get content through.\n\n\n*\n\n*Do not allow spam to leave your domains. If you wanna work it out you\nmost likely need to make sure you are not serving as an open or\nsemi-open relay.\n\n*Set up dkim and spf records for your domain, and start signing your\noutgoing emails.\n\n*Start the work getting your domains removed from blacklists.\nFeel free to improve, or comment : )\n\nA: In a case I recently encountered, it was a Man In The Middle box put in place by a sender's hosting provider.  It was programmed to inspect all port 25 traffic and if it saw a couple of strings from an old, expired Spamcop report, it would drop the connection at end of DATA, with the sender getting the \"550 Action not taken\" message.\nNo other email from the sender was affected.\nPretty sleazy.\n\nA: Michael's MITM mail scanner answer above helped me. \nI'm not sure if it is the webhost, our ISP, or possibly our firewall, but something was preventing seemingly random Word doc and docx attachments from our website running on a VPS to the office. \nTurning on STARTTLS on this email routing \"fixed\" the issue (the web server and the destination email domains were the same, so there was an overlooked setting to turn this on). The hint was that the same emails going to Google did work, and this used encryption. The encryption prevents whatever was snooping on the email from doing it's thing.\nOr maybe I stumbled on a bizarre bug between hMailServer and postfix. \n", "Q: Intel wireless 7260 driver crashes, how do I work around it?

I've used iwldvm here, but you should use iwlmvm if you get no results from the command lsmod | grep iwldvm.)\nsudo modprobe -r iwldvm\nsudo modprobe -r iwlwifi\nsudo modprobe iwlwifi\n\nThere is no need to run sudo modprobe iwl?vm because iwlwifi will take care of that automatically.\nSee also:\n\n*\n\n*http://marc.info/?l=linux-wireless&m=138718659005765&w=2\n\n*https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1305305\n\n*https://bugs.launchpad.net/intel/+bug/1265436\n", "Q: Using Ubuntu live CD how to mount my old backtrack install? I have an old install of Backtrack 5 amd64 and yesterday i tried to upgrade it. \nFor some reason that upgrade failed and i cannot manage to get it working. \nSo I now want to copy my data from some file locations to an external hard disk in order to perform afterwards a clean install with ubuntu. \nI booted a live usb with ubuntu and i am able to see the files within the file explorer. However some of the i cannot copy i.e. do not have sufficient permissions.\nProvided I know the root password of my original backtrack installation \nHow can i mount it using this password from the ubuntu live cd so that i can do any file operations with granted permisions???\nWhat I ve already done:\n\n\n*\n\n*Booted the Ubuntu Live CD.\n\n*\n\n*Pressed Ctrl-Alt-F1\n\n*sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt\n\n*sudo chroot /mnt\n\n*Pressed Ctrl-Alt-F7\n\n*Clicked on try ubuntu\n\n*I can now copy some files but not all of them.\n\n\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: What you could try is start Nautilus as root and then copy the files.

Update Manager should open up and tell you: New distribution release 'XX.XX' is available. Click Upgrade and follow the on-screen instructions.\nI would also recommend you read this brief guide and backup your installation.\n", "Q: How to save \"initctl\" log-priority options?

Can you please name some tools that will help me analyze and administrate network and server?\n\nA: A very good tool to use is NMap. You can install it easily with :\nsudo apt-get install nmap\n\nIs is useful for security purposes to find if any unwanted ports on a computer are open, it can also be used to check IP addresses (I find it useful when the router resets and i\nI need to find the IP address of my network printer.)\nA command that would scan for a computers Operating System (-O), as well as script, version and trace route scanning.:\nsudo nmap -A -O IP_ADDRESS\n\nor for more informative output (verbose - -v):\nsudo nmap -A -O -vvv IP_ADDRESS\n\n\nFor example, if I run this:\nsudo nmap -A -O -vvv 192.168.1.6\n\nit shows this for some Network Attached Storage (Closed):\nStarting Nmap 6.40 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2013-12-22 16:32 GMT\nNmap scan report for 192.168.1.6\nHost is up (0.00037s latency).\nNot shown: 991 filtered ports\nPORT     STATE  SERVICE      VERSION\n21/tcp   closed ftp\n22/tcp   open   ssh  \n2049/tcp closed nfs\nMAC Address: **:**:**:**:**:** (MANUFACTURER-OF-NETWORKING-HARDWARE)\nDevice type: general purpose\nRunning: Linux 2.6.X\nOS CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel:2.6\nOS details: Linux 2.6.9 - 2.6.27\nNetwork Distance: 1 hop\n\nTRACEROUTE\nHOP RTT     ADDRESS\n1   0.37 ms 192.168.1.6\n\n\nOS and Service detection performed.

I use a laptop and like to migrate during the day from one (physical) workplace to another and connect to an external monitor if available. \nI also must multitask a lot, so I have a lot of windows open at any given time and many (virtual) workspaces to organize them on.\nBut each time I connect / disconnect the external monitor all my careful arrangement is gone. This makes me really mad.\nIs there a desktop environment that just leaves the windows alone when you connect / disconnect a second monitor? Or even better, that remembers the window arrangement per monitor arrangement? So that when I went from my home office (17\" monitor on top of the laptop screen) to my usual workplace (21\" monitor left of the laptop screen) or my colleague's desk (19\" monitor right of the latop screen), the windows end up where they were the last time that monitor was connected - or stay put if they never saw this monitor. \nThe way unity \"handles\" external monitors just makes me sad and wish I didn't have all those extra monitors to connect and once I connect it makes me chained to this arrangement, as if I had a desktop machine nailed to the floor.\n\nA: I am providing you two shell scripts. It will help you to save your arrangement of windows positions and size. If somehow your desired windows arrangements get disturbed, you will be able to restore those arrangements with exact windows size and positions for all windows using these script.\nYou need to install wmctrl unless you already have it.

I deleted the /etc/passwd file and cannot login now. I don't know the root password and tried lots of passwords, but none of them worked.\nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: This question seems to already have the suitable answers, I will just expand on @Lekensteyn 's comment:\nsudo cp /var/backups/passwd.bak /etc/passwd\nsudo chmod 644 /etc/passwd\n\n\nA: Here are the steps to do this graphically:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to a live Ubuntu environment using an Ubuntu bootable media;\n\n*Start Nautilus file manager and mount your Ubuntu partition (here in the snapshot, it's the 129 GB Filesystem);\n\n(Hit Ctrl + L to see the partition's UUID.)\n\n\n*Start Nautilus with root privilege (Press Alt + F2 and type gksu nautilus and hit enter);\n\n\n*The Ubuntu partition should show up in the side bar with its UUID. Click to mount it, and go to the /etc directory;\n\n\n*In /etc directory, scroll down to find the file named passwd- and make a copy of this in the directory (press-hold Ctrl key, place your mouse pointer over the file, press-hold the left mouse-button, drag the mouse pointer, and then release the mouse button followed by Ctrl key to make a copy in the same directory; a file named passwd- (copy) will be created);\n\n\n*Select the copy file, right-click and select rename. Then rename the file to passwd;\n\n\n*After the file has been renamed to passwd right-click and select Properties from the context menu, and in the tab Permissions set the appropriate permissions, i.e. the Owner root should have Read and write permission while for the Group and Others set the access to Read-only and close the properties window;\n\n\n*Now reboot your system and you should be able to log in with your password.\n\nYou can do the same using terminal in a live environment.\nThe steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to live Ubuntu session;\n\n*Open a terminal or a tty and type in the command:\nsudo fdisk -l\n\n(and note your Ubuntu partition's device name which will be in the form /dev/sdX.)\n\n*Mount the device,\nsudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt\n\n(repace sdXY with your target device.)\n\n*cd to the target systems /etc directory:\ncd /mnt/etc\n\n\n*Use the backup file to restore, and set the appropriate permissions:\nsudo cp passwd- passwd\nsudo chmod 644 passwd\n\nOr use the backup in /var/backups/passwd.bak:\nsudo install -m 644 /mnt/var/backups/passwd.bak /mnt/var/backups/passwd\n\n(as pointed out by Lekensteyn in his comments)\n\n*Then reboot your computer:\nsudo reboot\n\n\nA: If you are can login just open terminal and try this :\nsudo cp /etc/passwd- /etc/passwd\n\nsudo chmod 644 /etc/passwd\n\nElse\nBoot  into recovery mode  or from Ubuntu live Cd . Then, mount your old drive:\nmkdir /olddrive\nmount /dev/hda5 /olddrive\nassuming that your old drive is on /dev/hda5.\nthen, cd to /olddrive/etc\ntype:\necho \"root::0:0:Superuser:/:/bin/bash\" > passwd\n\nthen reboot. That will set no passwd for root. \nThen, you can login, create all of your accounts over again, etc.\nYou may also use the back up which is called(i think) /etc/passwd-\nEdit:(another method \"I don't try that before bu i think it should work also\")\n\n\n*\n\n*Start GRUB on boot (press ESC while booting)\n\n*Press e over (recovery mode)\n\n*Press e over the line beginning with kernel\n\n*Press Space bar and enter \"init=/bin/bash\"\n\n*Press enter\n\n*Press b\n\n*At command prompt type: \"cp /etc/passwd- /etc/passwd\"\n\n*Reboot to GRUB again\n\n*Press e over (recovery mode)\n\n*Press e over the line beginning with kernel\n\n*Press Space bar and enter \"init=/bin/bash\"\n\n*Press enter\n\n*Press b\n\n*At command prompt type \"mount -o remount,rw /\"\n\n*Type \"passwd YOURUSERNAMEHERE\" (IF you don't know your username type \"ls /home\" (that is a Lower case L and lower case S) for a list of users)\n\n*Enter new password at prompt\n\n*Reboot to normal boot.\n\n\nSource\n", "Q: Ubuntu Bind9 set up and resolv.conf I found this tutorial the best I've come across and it works! Well done although I can't vote and comment on it due to my site privilege as yet.\nHow do I do a complete BIND9 DNS Server Configuration with a hostname?\nMy question is, I'm unsure about the resolv.conf file, where the tutorial states to insert the nameserver, domain and search. My resolv.conf file has a comment above it saying \"do not edit this file by hand - your changes will be overwritten\". Can anyone clarify this for me please?\nThanks in advance,\nMario.\n\nA: The tutorial you refer to is outdated insofar as it tells you to edit /etc/resolv.conf by hand. In Ubuntu 12.04 and later you don't edit /etc/resolv.conf by hand but configure resolvconf to put the correct content in that file. If you have followed the other steps in the tutorial and want to use the locally running BIND 9 named to resolve DNS names then the right thing to do is (1) make sure that /etc/resolv.conf is (still) a symbolic link to ../run/resolvconf/resolv.conf and (2) set RESOLVCONF=yes in /etc/default/bind9 to cause BIND 9 named to register its local listen address 127.0.0.1 with resolvconf when it starts; (3) do /etc/init.d/bind9 restart.\nIf you would like to add search domain names to the resolver configuration then add a dns-search line to the iface lo stanza in /etc/network/interfaces.\niface lo inet loopback\n    dns-search name1 name2\n\nAfter doing this you have to ifdown lo and ifup lo to cause the information to be added to resolv.conf.\n\nA: when editing resolv.conf it shows:\nDynamic resolv.conf(5) file for glibc resolver(3) generated by resolvconf(8)\nDO NOT EDIT THIS FILE BY HAND -- YOUR CHANGES WILL BE OVERWRITTEN\nit's not about resolv.conf, it's about resolvconf. The two filenames look almost the same except for the missing dot. When you execute resolvconf, it provides more information. Okay, let's check the manual:\nTo make ifup push name‐server information to resolvconf when it configures an  interface,  add dns- lines to the relevant iface stanza in /etc/network/interfaces.  To add nameserver addresses add a line beginning with dns-nameservers.\ndns-nameservers 11.22.33.44 55.66.77.88\n\nin other words what you write in resolvconf will be added in resolv.conf so if you added lines there it will be deleted when you restart and overwritten by resolvconf .\nYou can also specify your dns server in /etc/network/interfaces \nthat's the answer!\n", "Q: Translation - \"Adding the key to the list of trusted software vendors failed\" I am translating for Ubuntu.

One of those numbers I want to extract, but for many, many web pages, too many to do manually. So I'd like to use WGET to get those web pages one after another, and write another program to parse the .html and retrieve the number I want. But the .html file saved by WGET when using the same URL as the browser does not contain the data table. Why not? It is as if the server detects the request is coming from WGET and not from a web browser, and supplies a skeleton web page, lacking the data table. How can I get the exact same web page with WGET? - Thx!\nMORE INFO:\nAn example of the URL I'm trying to fetch is:\nhttp://performance.morningstar.com/fund/performance-return.action?t=ICENX&region=usa&culture=en-US\nwhere the string ICENX is a mutual fund ticker symbol, which I will be changing to any of a number of different ticker symbols. This downloads a table of data when viewed in a browser, but the data table is missing if fetched with WGET.\n\nA: As roadmr noted, the table on this page is generated by javascript. wget doesn't support javascript, it just dumps the page as received from the server (ie before any javascript code runs) and so the table is missing.\nYou need a headless browser that supports javascript like phantomjs:\n$ phantomjs save_page.js http://example.com > page.html\n\nwith save_page.js: \nvar system = require('system');\nvar page = require('webpage').create();\n\npage.open(system.args[1], function()\n{\n    console.log(page.content);\n    phantom.exit();\n});\n\nThen if you just want to extract some text, easiest might be to render the page with w3m:\n$ w3m -dump page.html\n\nand/or modify the phantomjs script to just dump what you're interested in.\n\nA: Instead of --recursive, which will just go ahead and \"spider\" every single link in your URL, use --page-requisites. Should behave exactly as the options you describe in graphical browsers. \n       This option causes Wget to download all the files that are\n       necessary to properly display a given HTML page.  This includes\n       such things as inlined images, sounds, and referenced stylesheets.\n\n       Ordinarily, when downloading a single HTML page, any requisite\n       documents that may be needed to display it properly are not\n       downloaded.  Using -r together with -l can help, but since Wget\n       does not ordinarily distinguish between external and inlined\n       documents, one is generally left with \"leaf documents\" that are\n       missing their requisites.\n\nFor more information, do man wget and look for the --page-requisites option (use \"/\" to search while reading a man page).\n\nA: If the server's answer differs depending on an asking source, it is mostly because of HTTP_USER_AGENT variable (just a text string) that is provided with a request from the asking source, informing the server about technology.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*You can check Your browser agent here -> http://whatsmyuseragent.com\n\n*According to the WGET manual this parameter should do the job\n--user-agent=AGENT.\n\nIf this does not help, i.e. JavaScript processing may be needed to get the same page as a browser, or maybe appropriate request with GET parameters so the server will prepare answer that doesn't require JavaScript to fill the page.\n\nA: You can download a Full Website Using wget --mirror\nExample:\nwget --mirror -p --convert-links -P ./LOCAL-DIR WEBSITE-URL\n\nThe above command line which you want to execute when you want to download a full website and made available for local viewing.\nOptions:\n\n\n*\n\n*--mirror turns on options suitable for mirroring.\n\n*-p downloads all files that are necessary to properly display a given HTML page.\n\n*--convert-links after the download, convert the links in document for local viewing.\n\n*-P ./LOCAL-DIR saves all the files and directories to the specified directory.\nFor more Info about Wget Options Read More this article:\nOverview About all wget Commands with Examples, or check Wget's man page.\n", "Q: Ethernet driver Intel 82579LM e1000e update \n*\n\n*I have a problem with my ethernet wired connection that doesn't work on ubuntu 13.10, using Intel 82579LM controller.

However, if this report from battery is consistently off, estimated power should still match it.\nValues in \"Power est.\" column are estimated by PowerTOP, by observing power usage under different loads and display brightnesses. PowerTOP gets baseline power when your display is off and processor (and GPU) is in sleep state. On top of that, there're power estimates.\nThere is no mechanism to obtain power usage of single component or process. For example, some peripherals could consume remarkable amount of power, but PowerTOP have no way to measure that. It is better to show best possible estimates for impact of each process, and have (relatively large) chunk of unaccounted usage than to scale estimates to match discharge rate.\nTo improve estimates, you can try (re)calibrating PowerTOP with\npowertop --calibrate\n\nFrom man 8 powertop:\n--calibrate\n    runs powertop in calibration mode. When running on battery, \n    powertop can track power consumption as well as system activity. \n    When there are enough measurements, powertop can start to report \n    power  estimates.  One can get more accurate estimates by using \n    this option to enable a calibration cycle. This will cycle through \n    various display levesl (sic) and USB device activities and workloads.\n\nTry running calibration with unplugged charger. There's small chance that either your laptop reports battery charging status incorrectly, or you hit a bug in PowerTOP. \n", "Q: How to update a device driver?

I have an ASUS X501 with Windows8 preloaded and I decided to install Ubuntu Studio last year. Everything was great, I was able to choose to boot into Ubuntu or Windows when I turned on the computer. \nYou know how Windows is, so my brother used the laptop the other day and \"accidentally\" updated some components of Windows, which screwed the boot menu and always booted directly into Windows.\nI had no way to run Ubuntu, so I searched for help and I found that I needed to run Ubuntu through a Live USB (my laptop doesn't come with DVD unit) and then inside Ubuntu I should run boot repair. \nI downloaded the ISO and created the USB live stick, managed to boot into it, ran Boot-Repair through terminal and followed the recommended option to repair it. It said it was ready and I should reboot the computer.\nSo I did but I got into this screen. \nGNU GRUB version 2.00-19ubuntu2.1\n\nMinimal BASH-like line editing is supported.

It seems that the memory on the USB 3.0 was not being recognized, I put it on other normal USB port and worked. It seems to me it has to do with some UEFI things. Since this is the only thing that can boot, the other options Windows bootloader and ubuntustudio doesn't say anything about \"UEFI\" at the boot menu, only the usb stick..\nI have ran again boot-repair and played around on the advanced options enabling and disabling options but nothing changes.. \nFor me, it has to do with something that Windows and ubunu partitions need to be set up as UEFI, and they currently are not..\nNo matter which option I select it will take me back to the GRUB GNU screen, unless I select UEFI Kingston which is the live USB..\nThanks \n\nA: You did this. Better to undo it. This is for those systems that only boot Windwows from UEFI menu, but then can only boot Windows backed up file bkpbootmgfw.efi from grub menu.\nWinEFI detected. Do you want to activate [Backup and rename Windows EFI files]? yes (if any choice fails, please retry with the other)\nTo undo & to rename files to their original names, you just need to tick the \"Restore EFI backups\" option of Boot-Repair.\nYou show grub installed to protective MBR.

Get out of 'tail' with Ctrl+c.\n\nA: You need to use the tail command which output the last part of files in real time including all incoming logs to a standard output device such as screen. the commadn to use is \ntail -f /path/to/log/file\n\nEDIT: TRY this\ntail -f --retry /path-to-log-file\n\nThis will try to reopen the file with the new contents\nOr this\ntail -F /path/to/log/file\n\n\nA: I'm not sure exactly what you are trying to do but you could use the watch command in conjunction with the tail command... Something like this:\nwatch tail /path/to/file\n\nA: As Atari911 said, you can use watch along with cat to do this. Use\nwatch cat <filename>\n\nthis will output the contents of the file given by filename every 2 seconds to standard output. To change the interval for updating the output to something like 1 second(you can't reduce beyond 0.1), you can use\nwatch -n 1 cat <filename>\n\nI am using cat to output the complete file, you could tail but that would only give you the last n lines of the file, where n is 10 by default.\nRefer to the manual page of watch for more info.\n", "Q: Unable to open Ubuntu Software Center I have got Ubuntu 13.10 to my old laptop.

I had similar issues -- Ubuntu installer was booting to EFI, but was unable to create EFI partition. After installation it was trying to boot via legacy BIOS.\nLong story short, I believe you have two ways -- decide, whether you are using EFI or legacy boot, pick one of them in settings and stick to it (either switch entirely to legacy mode or don't use legacy mode at all).

I've known about the ability to drop to a root shell for quite a while. You just hold shift and select (recovery mode) from the list of kernels presented.\nI would mess up an install, then drop to root shell and be confused as to how that's useful when it's read only and I can't actually fix anything. Recently I discovered this post from 2012, showing how you can run:\nmount -o remount,rw /\n\nWhich will remount root in read-write mode. I was happy that now I can edit things, and fix whatever config file I shouldn't have changed in whatever ways, but now I'm root, with access to everything root can access? \nPretty cool I thought, unless I'm somebody who doesn't own my computer. I can read all of the password containing files with permissions of root:root 400. I can modify config files and cause all kinds of mayhem.\nSo the question is, if someone has physical access to my machine, is my system vulnerable to their knowledge of this? Is there something I'm missing?\nIs full disk encryption the only way to go?\n\nA: Yes, disk encryption is pretty much the only way to go to protect your data. For example, without it and with enough physical access, one attacker can just take the disk out and put it in a external usb enclosure to read it from his system.\nAnd setting the root password is not enough, one can boot with init=/bin/bash to bypass any checks, that's a well known trick.\nSo I would recommend to check the bios ( so someone cannot boot on a livecd, or at least, not without fiddling with bios ). Then you can also set a password on grub to prevent people from messing with the configuration, among other things.\nThat should prevent the most common attacks. Then you have more sophisticated ones like Hardware keylogger, Evil maid attack where your bootloader is replaced, etc, etc, but that's IMHO complicating the answer.\nSecurity is a complex matter, and you have to see what kind of threat you face before choosing what you want to do.\n", "Q: 12.10 Movie Player crashed entire system Having intermittent issues using Movie Player to view video files.\nMost of the time, I can watch the first video fine.

How do I configure my DNS so that it checks a website for my public ip address?\nI have set up a DynDns hostname that updates the public ip address every hour, so I can connect to that without a problem, but now I need to configure a static internal IP? (I can't make a static public address because my isp doesn't provide it). I know /etc/resolv.conf comes into it somewhere, can somebody explain to me how this works?\nAnd I know that my interfaces need to be configured so my network card uses a static internal ip that is linked to the public IP that is always changing? Can someone help me and explain how I can do this,\nThank you!\n\nA: You shouldn't need to mess with resolv.conf or any of your internal DNS settings.\nFor what you need to achieve, I've found it easiest to make all the changes in my router by adding a reserved internal IP address for the machine(s) that I want to have the same internal IP address all the time. Almost every router has some type of Web interface that you can access through the router IP, so if your LAN is running on addresses in the 198.162.0.x range, the router will be at 192.168.0.1. Because each router is different, it's hard to give exact directions on where to find where you set the reserved IP addresses; look in the LAN settings section, or it may be plainly visible in the menu options. Once you have your machine set on a reserved IP in the router, you can set up Port Forwarding for the specific ports you want routed to that machine: if you're running a Minecraft server, you would forward port 25565 to it.\nMany routers also have options for using dynamic DNS services like dyn.com in which you enter your account info for dyn.com, and if and when your public IP changes it notifies dyn.com of the change and they will update your DNS A records with the new public IP of the router.\n", "Q: can I install multiple ubuntu distros at once?

So when I switch on the mac, it displays a grey screen with a question mark in a folder at the start-up. Then, I took it to the mac store where they said that the hard drive is done, but I thought I can just boot it from a USB, Now, I am currently on my Windows computer (Windows XP) and I have a 16GB USB where I used unetbootin to copy Ubuntu (the actual .ISO onto the USB). But when I plug the USB into my mac it doesn't boot and it goes back to the same grayed screen with a question mark in a folder.\nWhat can I do to this?\n\nA: First of all, If the store techs have said that the hard drive is done (busted), then how are you planning to install any operating system on it despite Ubuntu?\nSecondly, I cannot exactly predict whether this is something to meddle with hardware or software issue as I'm not physically presented to diagnose the issue. \nBut before that I'd suggest you to refer \"A flashing question mark appears when you start your Mac\" KB article from the official Apple website itself to acknowledge. And also, Apple support community, to find out similar threads. \nTip: I cannot confirm whether this would work as I've never tested it on a Mac. But make sure you've created a proper bootable USB with proper instruction. Then plugin the USB, hold down the option key while switching on the system to boot into the menu selection.

Is there any sollution for that?\n\nA: As user68186 commented there is a fix for the black screen issue. \nMoreover, there is always a possibility that Ubutnu 12.04.3 will also have the black screen issue or some other issue.\nThus in deciding whether to use 12.04.03 you might also want to consider the fact that it is an LTS (Long term support) release and thus is guaranteed to be supported for 5 years after it's release, which is in April of 2017.\n13.10 comes with the latest and greatest software, but it's support will end  9 months from it's release date which is July 2014.  Because of this you may want to choose a different Ubuntu derivative that uses a rolling release.\nSo if having the most up to date software is most important to you, you likely should choose 13.10, where as if you would prefer not to need to update your operating system in 2 years, than 12.04.3 is likely a better choice.\nSee this question for more on why Ubuntu limits support.\n", "Q: How do I tell the kernel which driver to use? My wifi is behaving strangely (not scanning, not connecting to networks) to remedy this I'm trying to install drivers from Intel. The device is an Intel Centrino Advanced-N 6205. The documentation wasn't very clear on how to install it. I downloaded the iwlwifi-6000g2a-6.ucode file from this Intel page, and copied that ucode file to /lib/firmware directory. That's all the documentation that came with the file told me to do. The information on this page is pretty much the same info I got with the ucode file from intel.

You have used the manual command line way using two commands.\nsudo mkdir /media/alexandru/Hard\nsudo mount /dev/sda5/ /media/alexandru/Hard/\n\nThe first command creates a folder (also called a directory) Hard inside the folder /media/alexandru/. I assume the parent folder /media/alexandru/ already exists.\nThe second command actually mounts the partition to the newly created folder.\nWhen you reboot the computer, the second command is undone, but the first is not. That is, once the computer boots up again, the partition is not mounted on its own. Only thing that remains is an empty folder called Hard inside /media/alexandru/. This is why you didn't find any data inside the folder.\nIf you issue the second command again after the computer boots up, the empty folder will again be assigned to the Windows partition and you will see the data again.\nThere is another way to quickly mount a Windows (or any other) partition.\nThis is through Nautilus, the file manager. You should be able to see an icon for this partition in the left panel of Nautilus under Devices. \n\nClicking on this icon will mount the partition. The mount point will probably be different from the one you created, but this is the easiest way to quickly access a file from that partition. However, if you do this and then try to mount same partition using the command:\nsudo mount /dev/sda5/ /media/alexandru/Hard/\n\nThen you will get the error you got, as the partition is already mounted on another folder. Conversely, if you mount the partition using the command first, you won't see the icon for the partition in Nautilus.\nThird, automatically mount the partition on every boot\nTo do this you have to edit the etc/fstab file and add a line for the partition you want to auto-mount.

Don't know how to show you the output I see on the screen.\nUpdate\nI used a kernel boot flag acpi_os=Windows noapic on my Ubuntu 12.04 on Lenovo ThinkPad S440 because I suppose that if they've build it with Windows8+ in mind, it could help somehow, but I'm not sure.

Here is the snapshot of what i see after the crash.\n\nA: Decided to move my comments to an asnwer, I don't have a complete answer, but at the very least I can help explain the messages you are seeing and point you in the right direction.\nBIOS  on modern computers is a HUGE legacy kludge. ACPI is a function of the BIOS. There are a lot of little chips and sensors that control all the small things on your computer, a little gpio chip dumping fan speed, another dumping temperature readings, etc. They are like little micro-controllers that handle all the little stuff and talk to hardware directly. All of these feed into an ACPI controller which is either its own chip or a part of a different chip. When people talk about the motherboard \"chipset\" this is part of the picture.  These devices need a way to communicate with the larger system so that your OS (or BIOS) can correctly decide what it needs to do (thermal shutdown, raise fan speed, etc.). The easiest way is to just carve up a little bit of memory that the ACPI controller will read/write from, the details of exactly which block of memory is up to the BIOS/mobo designer, but thats irrelevant. Your ACPI driver will look up (or know) what that memory section is and write directly to it. Most of this stuff is completely transparent to you, as the user, only time it becomes an issue is if the driver, kernel, and bios do not agree on what is going on.\nMemcheck is letting you know these little details, by telling you the following\n[    0.000000] e820: BIOS-provided physical RAM map:\n[    0.000000] BIOS-e820: [mem 0x0000000000000000-0x000000000009cfff] usable\n[    0.000000] BIOS-e820: [mem 0x000000000009d000-0x000000000009ffff] reserved\n[    0.000000] BIOS-e820: [mem 0x00000000000e0000-0x00000000000fffff] reserved\n[    0.000000] BIOS-e820: [mem 0x0000000000100000-0x00000000afc61fff] usable\n[    0.000000] BIOS-e820: [mem 0x00000000afc62000-0x00000000afe63fff] reserved\n[    0.000000] BIOS-e820: [mem 0x00000000afe64000-0x00000000be97efff] usable\n[    0.000000] BIOS-e820: [mem 0x00000000be97f000-0x00000000c2e7efff] reserved\n[    0.000000] BIOS-e820: [mem 0x00000000c2e7f000-0x00000000c2f7efff] ACPI NVS\n[    0.000000] BIOS-e820: [mem 0x00000000c2f7f000-0x00000000c2ffefff] ACPI data\n[    0.000000] BIOS-e820: [mem 0x00000000c2fff000-0x00000000c2ffffff] usable\n[    0.000000] BIOS-e820: [mem 0x00000000c3000000-0x00000000cf9fffff] reserved\n[    0.000000] BIOS-e820: [mem 0x00000000f8000000-0x00000000fbffffff] reserved\n[    0.000000] BIOS-e820: [mem 0x00000000fe101000-0x00000000fe112fff] reserved\n[    0.000000] BIOS-e820: [mem 0x00000000fec00000-0x00000000fec00fff] reserved\n[    0.000000] BIOS-e820: [mem 0x00000000fed08000-0x00000000fed08fff] reserved\n[    0.000000] BIOS-e820: [mem 0x00000000fed10000-0x00000000fed19fff] reserved\n[    0.000000] BIOS-e820: [mem 0x00000000fed1c000-0x00000000fed1ffff] reserved\n[    0.000000] BIOS-e820: [mem 0x00000000fee00000-0x00000000fee00fff] reserved\n[    0.000000] BIOS-e820: [mem 0x00000000ffc00000-0x00000000ffffffff] reserved\n[    0.000000] BIOS-e820: [mem 0x0000000100000000-0x000000012f5fffff] usable\n\nIf you work out the math, the last line tells you that the last 6.5 GB of memory is free for the os to deal with as it wants (a memory address points to a byte of memory, the number is a hexadecimal 64 bit address so its easy to compute how many bytes are in the range). Upon closer examination you see that really this is just all the memory above the 4GB 32bit address limit up to the maximum address that the memory controller can deal with (even if your physical memory is less than this ~10GB limit). Above that in the list, you can see how lower 4GB of memory have some parts of it carved off by the BIOS for various reasons (primarily legacy), but the bulk of your lower 4GB is marked \"usable\". The OS reads this information and basically knows that it cannot use those sections of memory to map general OS functions and virtual memory. In the middle you have about 70MB of memory carved off for the ACPI controller.\nNow, turning to your errors.\nAs the OS loads, various drivers are loaded up and run through some basic initializations and checks (verifying the device, turning it on, etc.). On a number of times, you get a complaint that there are conflicts between what certain (low level) system drivers are assuming is their memory chunk and what the OS thinks should be there. Combined with warning messages about not being able to determine the ACPI namespace for certain devices, tells me that there is a very large possibility that not everyone is on the same page about what needs to go where, Meaning that there is a potential that somebody will overwrite some pages of memory that they shouldn't or other mischief.\nAs for your crash message.\nkthread is a generic name for a kernel process, a kernel process is started in kernel space and not user space, so its ability to cause mischief is greatly increased as they have direct access to the system memory, typically they represent driver daemons and other low-level kernel functions. \nYour computer crashes out of a kthread with a tainted warning, meaning that the kernel has determined (through a variety of complicated algorithms) that the memory or the inputs the process is working with are not trustworthy, and rather than risk continuing on, it throws a kernel panic and crashes the system. Taint analysis and taint detection is a way to dynamically catch and prevent exploits from attackers, but in this case caught a kernel bug that is, most likely, related to your ACPI/wifi issue.\nFinally, getting to the solution for your issues.\nIt is hard to determine exactly what is causing mischief just from those logs and the snapshot, however its safe to say that the wifi driver is not working correctly, and your attempted ACPI fix only made the issue more complicated, as such I would recommend the following sequence of steps.\n\n\n*\n\n*I would revert whatever ACPI flags that you added to your boot command\n\n*I would revert the wifi driver to what was working previously\n\n*I would update the system kernel at least, an maybe the entire system.\n\n*I would try to update the driver again\n\n*If it doesn't work, then file a bug report on the driver\n\n", "Q: Ubtunu 12.04 x86_64 Which Proprietary Nvidia Driver for nVidia GT216GLM [Quadro FX 880M] supports brightness controls on Lenvo W510?

If so that would imply that there is something in your user settings that is causing the problem.\nIf you can run a terminal from Guest mode, you should be able to \"su \" to access your normal account. From there you could e.g. move your .config directory out of the way (e.g. to .config.bak) and see if that enables you to login, or add a new user account and copy your data/documents to that without copying the settings.\n\nA: I had similar problems with the update today.

So clearly it is working.\nHowever, I cannot access any other devices on the same network. I have set up IP forwarding by uncommenting the line net.ipv4.ip_forwarding=1 and restarting syctl.

Or is that step complete and there is something else missing? \nHelp!!\nThanks\n\nA: When testing the connection out, be sure to enter the server and port number.\nMinecraft server must be running and listening on 25565.  You need to also go into your router's configuration, look for a Port Forwarding section and forward incoming requests to 25565 to the machine  running your server.\n\n\nA: You need to tell your router to forward incoming connection attempts to the desired port number to the IP address of the machine you want to use as a server. The option will be in your router settings somewhere .. sometimes it is referred to as \"DMZ\" (de-militarized zone) settings, though on home routers the concept is not really the same as the DMZ used on corporate networks.\n", "Q: nautilus-dropbox : Depends: dropbox but it is not going to be installed I was trying to install dropbox on ubuntu 13.10\nMy first attempt was to follow the steps from official site:\ncd ~ && wget -O - \"https://www.dropbox.com/download?plat=lnx.x86_64\" | tar xzf -\n~/.dropbox-dist/dropboxd\n\nAlso it installed dropbox, I was not able to see the icon on the panel (I tried this post, but the icon has not appeared).

Although Dropbox was running at the background, I was unable to see the Icon on the task bar. I needed this for the Selective Sync in particular. I tried several things from reinstalling Dropbox to using the .deb files.\nAfter various attempts this has worked:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the cloud synchronisation CLI and Nautilus extension for dropbox from the Software Centre. Check to include Python-gpgme in the additional add-ons.\n\n*Then install the Dropbox from Software Centre.  It will ask you to remove the CLI Nautilus, choose to install anyway. This one and the above both appears if you search for dropbox.\n\n*During the installation, it will ask you first to start dropbox, and then to restart Nautilus. In my case, when I made those choices, those pop-up windows didn't close automatically. \nAfter the installation is completed, I was able to see the Dropbox icon on my task bar. Great! After allowing it sometime to download the folder list, I could do the Selective Sync as well.\nNote that I removed/purged all Dropbox related stuff before doing this. And not sure if it had any effect, but had done this before.\nsudo apt-get update && upgrade\n\nand \nsudo apt-get install lib32z1 lib32ncurses5 lib32bz2-1.0\n\n\nA: First of all, you could use deb http://linux.dropbox.com/ubuntu saucy main instead of precise, but since all the \"versions\" of the repository end up in the same package pool, that ought not to change anything.\nNow, to your issue. I'm not sure, but since nautilus-dropbox is a transitional package for dropbox, try installing dropbox directly; it might solve your installation problem.\n\nStep by step\nFirst of all, let's assume you haven't downloaded any package from Dropbox's website.\nEnable the repository:\nRun these lines from the Terminal.\necho 'deb http://linux.dropbox.com/ubuntu saucy main'>>'dropbox.list'\nchmod 644 'dropbox.list'\nsudo chown root:root 'dropbox.list'\nsudo mv 'dropbox.list' '/etc/apt/sources.list.d/dropbox.list'\nsudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 5044912E\n\nThe first line creates a line containing the repository in a file named dropbox.list (note that this uses saucy, but you can use any previous version, as all repos end up in the same package pool). The second and the third give some necessary access and group permissions to the file. The fourth line moves the file to the place all repos are located. Finally, the fifth line adds the Key File so that the repository can be authenticated.\nNow, let's install the package:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install dropbox\n\nNow you can launch Dropbox from the application launcher of your choice.\n\nA: I had the same problem. My solution was: Uninstall the existing Dropbox client from the Ubuntu Software Center and install the client version from the Dropbox website ( https://www.dropbox.com/install ).\n", "Q: Ubuntu WILL NOT boot, no matter what i do.

My new printer (1 month old) can not be recognized  Canon Pixma MG5420. \nThe Canon site said clearly that it does not work with Linux, but I know there are so many experts here that perhaps know some trick to make it works. I'm very very new in this platform, I'd appreciate step by step instructions if it is possible.\n\nA: I will try to help you. On the European site of Canon, you can find the drivers for MG5400 series printers. The drivers you need are the two Debian Packagearchives (Ubuntu is based on Debian), one for the scanner, and the other for the printer.\nHere is the link where you can get your driver.\nhttp://www.canon-europe.com/Support/Consumer_Products/products/Fax__Multifunctionals/InkJet/PIXMA_MG_series/PIXMA_MG5440.aspx\n\nA: I went a slightly different direction - as of 2017, the UK driver is looking for deprecated dependencies - libtiff4, which depends in turn on libjpeg8.  \nThose are available here for libjpeg8 under wheezy, and here for libtiff4 under wheezy as well.  \nOnce you have the UK driver, and these two packages into one directory, your commands will look something like:\nsudo dpkg -i libjpeg8_8d-1+deb7u1_amd64.deb\nsudo dpkg -i libtiff4_3.9.6-11_amd64.deb\ncd cnijfilter-mg5400series-3.80-1-deb\nsudo ./install.sh\n\nThe install script will then run properly and you should be able to answer the questions without any trouble.  The network detection might take a second or two.  \nSolution works for:  Linux Mint Debian Edition (Betsy), but should also apply to Ubuntu and other Debian distros based on the 3.16.0-4 kernel (wheezy). \n\nA: If Canon themself says it doesn't work, I doubt anyone would step in to make some reverse engineering and make it work (a la nouveau driver for Nvidia video cards). Normally, the makers should release the documentation of their products so the community could create some modules. If this have not been done with your printer you are pretty much out of luck.\n\nA: I went to the canon usa site and as predicted there is no linux driver there.  however the european site did have the drivers as a deb package to download.  I downloaded the 2 debian driver files that were gzipped tar files.  i untarred them in the download directory and then used gdebi to install them... the 32 bit and 64 bit are both in the .deb file so you have to click on the \"packages\" sub directory to see the 64 bit and 32 bit packages inside.  then i find that there is a \"common\" and a \"model specific\" driver in each of the 2 packages i downloaded (1 for scanner and 1 for printing) so i installed 4 pakages total (64 bit common for scanning, 64 bit model specific for scanning, 64 bit common for printing, and 64 bit model specific for printing.  then i used the normal everyday \"add printer\" in linux and voila it woiks.

Is there a way to deny an IP address from connecting to my Pc?\nIs there a way to deny an Ip from connecting to specific Port?\n\nA: You can use ufw as well, and IMO, it's much simpler.  \nTo deny an IP address from any connections use:  \nsudo ufw deny from <ip_address> to any  \n\nOr to deny access to a specific port:  \nsudo ufw deny from <ip_address> to any port <some_port>  \n\nor you can specify protocol:  \nsudo ufw deny proto tcp from <ip_address> to any port <some_port>  \n\n(replacing tcp with either tcp or udp depending on what protocol you want)\n\nA: One of the options is using iptables that will activate a real  firewall to your system; this is probably the most safe way (see the other answers). \nThis answer is useful if the problem is that you see repeated attempt to enter in your system via the sshd daemon (SSH server service). \nNotice: as per 14.04, denyhost support has been dropped.\nThe new solution is to use fail2ban. It's more powerful and as easy as it gets to install with the default configuration. See http://bodhizazen.com/Tutorials/SSH_security \nold answer\nYou haven't explicitly stated which kind of problem you see, but if the problem is that someone is trying to enter your system via brute-force ssh attacks (hardly dangerous if your system is well configured, but still annoying), I suggest you have a look at DenyHosts. \nYou can install it from the repository with apt-get install denyhosts and it just works out of the box, blocking automatically for a week any host which attempts to login in your machine and fails three times. \n\nA: \nBefore we go any further, lets make note of a couple things.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*The majority of the Internet does not have static IP addresses.  Therefore, proxies, Tor, etc. can be used to try and bypass single-IP blocks.\n  \n*It is usually safer to do the inverse, to block all traffic on a port, and accept only certain addresses.  This is not feasible in most web-facing situations, but it is still a generally-accepted security practice.\n  \n*We do not do any filtering in here on the Internet in general - we do not take into account point #1 with the below answer, and you must consider the likelihood that if you block one IP, they'll find a way around it and get access to a different IP, and continue attacking.\n  \n\nBefore anyone comments that ufw is less complicated than iptables, I used iptables here because the OP answered this question using iptables commands, which led me to assume they wanted an answer that had iptables commands and not ufw commands/\n\nA good iptables firewall configuration will deny everything except the bare minimum requirements that you need on your system(s) in terms of \"acceptable connections\", and should only accept connections that have been explicitly allowed in the rules.\nTo do this, we have to configure iptables AND ip6tables to block traffic by default, except traffic you've initiated from inside your computer (such as web traffic from Firefox, etc., if you're on a system, or a wget stream to download software, or to allow apt to update the packages).  We also have to allow you to be able to add acceptable rules for traffic you WANT to have reaching your system.\nIn order for these rules to be persistent so they work all the time on every reboot, you should install the iptables-persistent package, which will allow you to save these rules and then automatically load them at system boot.  Run sudo apt-get install iptables-persistent first, then add your rules.  We'll make sure to update the ruleset that is loaded at boot after we've created a rule set.\nAssuming we've started with a blank iptables and ip6tables setup (which is the default in Ubuntu), you'll need to add a bunch of rules.  I'll start with iptables, then we'll work with ip6tables.\n\niptables\nThe following is a basic ruleset that will restrict all data and packets attempting to reach your system, regardless of what connection you're on:\nAccept localhost data\niptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT - accept all traffic on LocalHost, which is traffic that is local to within the computer only.  This is necessary for your computer to function correctly.\nAccept data related to outbound connections that your system has initiated\niptables -A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT - accept all traffic that is related to connections going in an outbound direction, including responses from remote servers (such as the apt mirrors, or any website you're visiting).\nICMP rules\nNote that I do not filter out ICMP packets, as those're generally OK to accept, unless you're paranoid.  If you really want to block ICMP, then you need to use these rules to accept some critical packets:\nAccept \"Time Exceeded\" ICMP\niptables -A INPUT -p icmp -m icmp --icmp-type 11 -j ACCEPT - accept \"Time Exceeded\" packets which is necessary for certain time-restricted connection setups.\nAccept \"Destination Unreachable\" ICMP\niptables -A INPUT -p icmp -m icmp --icmp-type 3/4 -j ACCEPT - accept \"Destination Unreachable\" ICMP responses from remote servers.  This allows the system to operate correctly with remote sites which you can't reach.\nAccept PING requests/responses (\"Echo\" ICMP)\niptables -A INPUT -p icmp -m icmp --icmp-type 8 -j ACCEPT - accept \"Echo\" (aka \"Ping\") requests.  This is good to keep around because your system's connection to certain sites and/or services may require a PING for a keep-alive request.\nCreate an iptables table to hold acceptable traffic ports/rules\niptables -N acceptable_traffic\niptables -A INPUT -j acceptable_traffic \nBy doing this, you have a table where you can put rules for what traffic you wish to accept on your system from external connections.  If you have an SSH server, you'd do iptables -A acceptable_traffic -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT (or replace 22 with the SSH server port).  You'd add other acceptable traffic rules here too.\nReject all traffic for which there are no rules set\nThere's two options for this.\niptables -A INPUT -j REJECT --reject-with icmp-host-unreachable - This is the first option, and what I consider a more sane way of blocking traffic, when an individual attempts to reach the server, they'll receive a \"Host Unreachable\" ICMP packet which then terminates the connection attempt.\niptables -A INPUT -j DROP - This is the second option.  This will automatically drop all incoming packets that're sent to your system which don't match an ACCEPT rule.  This means the packets are completely ignored.  The connection attempts from the remote location will just time out on their own with no response from the system being connected to.\n\nip6tables\nLike iptables for IPv4, you have to configure ip6tables for IPv6.  The rules are similar, but different.  *If you do not have IPv6 on your system, you may not have to worry about this, however having the rules in the system won't hurt.\nAccept localhost data\nip6tables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT - accept all traffic on LocalHost, which is traffic that is local to within the computer only.  This is necessary for your computer to function correctly.\nAccept data related to outbound connections that your system has initiated\nip6tables -A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT - accept all traffic that is related to connections going in an outbound direction, including responses from remote servers (such as the apt mirrors, or any website you're visiting).\nICMPv6 rules\nip6tables -A INPUT -p icmpv6 -j ACCEPT - I do not block IPv6 ICMP packets, because unlike IPv4, there's a billion more IPv6 ICMP packets that you should accept (i.e. all of them).  To that end, you can do this to accept all of them.\nCreate an ip6tables table to hold acceptable traffic ports/rules\nip6tables -N acceptable_traffic\nip6tables -A INPUT -j acceptable_traffic\nBy doing this, you have a table where you can put rules for what traffic you wish to accept on your system from external connections.  If you have an SSH server, you'd do ip6tables -A acceptable_traffic -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT (or replace 22 with the SSH server port).  You'd add other acceptable traffic rules here too.\nReject all traffic for which there are no rules set\nThere's two options for this.\nip6tables -A INPUT -j REJECT --reject-with icmp6-addr-unreachable - This is the first option, and what I consider a more sane way of blocking traffic, when an individual attempts to reach the server, they'll receive an \"Address Unreachable\" ICMPv6 packet which then terminates the connection attempt.\nip6tables -A INPUT -j DROP - This is the second option.  This will automatically drop all incoming packets that're sent to your system which don't match an ACCEPT rule.  This means the packets are completely ignored.  The connection attempts from the remote location will just time out on their own with no response from the system being connected to.\n\nSave all the rules\nSince I told you earlier to install the iptables-persistent package, you'll need to actually save the rules so they can be loaded later.\nNOTE: This set of commands actually drops you into a superuser shell.  YOU SHOULD NOT DO ANYTHING ELSE IN THIS SHELL EXCEPT THESE COMMANDS I STATE HERE!\nExecute the following commands:\nsudo -s\niptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4\nip6tables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v6\nexit\n\nThis will save the rules so they can be loaded at every reboot.  IF YOU EDIT THE RULES LATER, YOU WILL NEED TO RERUN THESE COMMANDS TO SAVE THE RULESETS.\n\nWhat if I actually want a list of bad IPs to block?\nWe can still do this!  You may want a list of blocks for 'bad' traffic.  So, here's my solution for this, and like before I'll split it into two sections, iptables and ip6tables.\n\niptables\nCreate a table for prohibited_traffic\nWe need to now create a prohibited_traffic table.  You'll add 'bad IPs' here.  We then need to insert the prohibited_traffic rule into the INPUT table.  (In the example below, I use 2 to indicate the rule number location for where we insert this rule, which puts it right after the rule that reads ACCEPT     all  --  anywhere             anywhere             ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED:\niptables -N prohibited_traffic\niptables -I INPUT 2 -j prohibited_traffic\n\nAdd rules to block certain IPs\nNow we add IPs to block to this prohibited_traffic table.  Here's the template:\niptables -A prohibited_traffic -s SourceIPAddress -j DROP\n\nReplace 'SourceIPAddress' with the IP address you want to block.  If you have a range of IPs to block you will need to take the 'range' and determine the CIDR range that contains all the IP addresses, and then use the format IPV4ADDRESS/cidr to block that CIDR range that includes the IPs.  Range blocks can't be done without CIDR or adding a LOT of IPs one by one.\n\nip6tables\nThis is almost identical to iptables \nCreate a table for prohibited_traffic\nWe need to now create a prohibited_traffic table.  You'll add 'bad IPs' here.  We then need to insert the prohibited_traffic rule into the INPUT table.  (In the example below, I use 2 to indicate the rule number location for where we insert this rule, which puts it right after the rule that reads ACCEPT     all  --  anywhere             anywhere             ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED:\nip6tables -N prohibited_traffic\nip6tables -I INPUT 2 -j prohibited_traffic\n\nAdd rules to block certain IPs\nNow we add IPs to block to this prohibited_traffic table.  Here's the template:\nip6tables -A prohibited_traffic -s SourceIPAddress -j DROP\n\nReplace 'SourceIPAddress' with the IP address you want to block.  If you have a range of IPs to block you will need to take the 'range' and determine the CIDR range that contains all the IP addresses, and then use the format IPV6ADDRESS/cidr to block that CIDR range that includes the IPs.  Range blocks can't be done without CIDR or adding a LOT of IPs one by one.\n\nA: iptables -A INPUT -s IP-ADDRESS -j DROP\n\nReplace IP-ADDRESS with your actual IP address. For example, if you wish to block an ip address 192.168.0.100 for whatever reason then type the command as follows:\niptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.0.100 -j DROP\n\nIf you just want to block access to one port from an ip 192.168.0.100 to port 80 then type command:\niptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.0.100 -p tcp --destination-port 80 -j DROP\n\n", "Q: How do I make my native Windows 8 Lenovo laptop boot grub?

Most of the forums that I have read on the subject seem to deal with the sound or Unity, neither of which interest me.\n\nA: Well I figured it out,\nIts kind of hackish, I wish I could have found a better way but this way works for now.\nI am running Xubuntu 13.10 and Mozilla Thunderbird 24.2.0. \nWhat I wanted was for a notification bubble to pop up when I got a new e-mail. \nWhat I did was installed the extention \"Fire Tray 0.4.8\" in Thunderbird, which showed a Thunderbird icon in the notification area plugin in my panel. Then if you right click the icon and go into the preferences option there is an empty field that says \"Launch on count change\". \nI wrote this python script and \"chmod +x\"'d it:\n#! /usr/bin/python\n\n\"\"\"\n    This program is meant to be launched when\n    a new message is detected by the mozilla\n    thunderbird extention \"fire tray\"\n\"\"\"\n\nimport pynotify\nimport sys\nimport getopt\n\n# full path to the icon to be displayed in the notification bubble\nICONPATH = '/usr/share/icons/numix-icon-theme-circle/Numix-Circle/48x48/applications/thunderbird.svg'\n\n# Time out is in seconds\nTIMEOUT = 45\n\n\ndef sendmessage(title, message):\n    pynotify.init(\"Mail Notify\")\n    notice = pynotify.Notification(title, message, ICONPATH)\n    notice.set_timeout(TIMEOUT)\n    notice.show()\n    return\n\ndef cmdLine(argv):\n    title = 'NEW MESSAGE'\n    message = '{0} New Messages'.format(argv[0])\n    sendmessage(title,message)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    if (int(sys.argv[1]) > 0):  \n        cmdLine(sys.argv[1])\n\nthen I saved it in my /home/user_name/bin/ as \"mailnotify\"\nThen in that field in the preferences of the Fire Tray plugin I typed the full path to the script, in my case, /home/jesse/bin/mailnotify. \nWorks like a charm now. I wanted to just change a parameter in a config file but oh well. \nHope this helps some one else out.\n(The timeout parameter doesn't seem to do much, so if anyone could correct me that would be great)\n\nA: I tried several thunderbird addons and I could only make \"New Mail Attention\" to work.\n(New Mail Attention 1.2.1, Thunderbird 31.5.0).\nIt will flash the application in the desktop's panel, no notification messages, but it's also good for me.\nIt's also great, because you can use it in Tools -> Message Filters, because it defines an action \"Get Attention\". So you can configure the thunderbird application flashing only for selected (important) emails.\nI hope it may help others.\nRegarding the script posted by Jesse, based on my experiment the TIMEOUT parameter seems to be in milliseconds, not seconds (maybe different pynotify versions).\nI could test this script by running it from a terminal, but I could not make Fire Tray to run it (even after restarting Thunderbird).\n(Also, if Fire Tray would work, using notify-send could be also an alternative, e.g.: )\n#! /bin/bash\n\nnotify-send -t 45000 -i /usr/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps/xfce-newmail.svg \"NEW MESSAGE\" \"$1 New Message(s)\"\n\n", "Q: How do I get my ASUS laptop to start at the right brightness level? I want to make it so my laptop starts at a low brightness level, which is comfortable for my eyes and easy on the laptop's battery. I found some instructions here on AskUbuntu, and so by using this command:\ncat /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness\n\n... I discovered that the maximum brightness is 4080 and the ideal brightness that I want to have my laptop default to is 700. So, I edited my /etc/rc.local file to have the following line in it:\necho 700 > /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness\n\nHowever, that didn't work. So, after a little more research, I tried this line:\necho 700 > /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness\n\nBut that also changed nothing.\nNow I'm a bit stuck. How do I get my brightness to start at the right level when I log in on my laptop?\n\nNote: It seems that this problem may be made worse by another more general issue of commands not running at startup, which I've asked about in a separate question. I think some of the answers suggested so far may actually work in principle, but I can't verify any of them unless I'm sure my startup programs are executing at all.\n\nA: I had the same issue. \nSolution = xbacklight:\nInstall xbacklight:\nsudo apt-get install xbacklight\nThen add \"xbacklight -set x\" (where 'x' = 0 to 100 desired brightness) to the startup applications via dashboard. For example, xbacklight -set 50.\nThis works with UX32VD and UX31A Asus Ultrabooks.\n\nA: First let us check yiour VGA device code\nlspci | grep VGA\n\nThe device code looks like 00:03.0 for example.\nTo set brightness\nsudo setpci -s '00:03.0' F4.B='xy'\n\nwhere 00:03.0 is your VGA device code && xy is hexadecimal value of your screen brightness varies between 00 and FF.\n\nEDIT:You can try this also..\nfirst know the output name\nxrandr -q\n\nfor example my output name is DVI-I-2\nThe brightness can be changed like this:\nxrandr --output DVI-I-2 --brightness 1\n\n\nNow add this command to your startup programs or to the /etc/rc.local file.\n\nA: I found this: LINK\nAs to avoid issues with dead links, I will add it here as well. :)\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal window.\n\n*Type in the following commands then hit Enter after each.\nsudo apt-get install xbacklight\n\n*Open the Startup Applications Preferences menu.\n\n*Click the Add button and add the following information:\nName: Brightness\nCommand: xbacklight -set 60\n\n*Replace 60 with whatever brightness level you prefer. \nAnd of course, credit where credit is due:\nJim Lynch for the blog post with the answer. :)\n\nA: sudo apt-get install xbacklight\n\nTo run on startup\non unity dash search for startup applications and enter name and the command \nxbacklight -set XXX\n\nReplace XXX by the appropriate value\n\nA: Try this, it works for me.\nsudo sh -c \"echo $VAL > /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness\"\nwhere, $VAL ranges from 0-100(lowest-to-highest)\nExample\nsudo sh -c \"echo 7 > /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness\"\nSOURCE : Setting a display's backlight brightness to be lower than is possible via the normal brightness controls\n\nA: In the end it turned out that there was a conflict with the power management preferences. The default brightness setting for when my laptop is on AC power is somehow over riding the default for when the laptop is on battery power. I've determined that if I uninstall all power management tools, then any of the commands suggested in the other answers will work.\nIn order to have the optimal system, I need to figure out how to get power management and screen adjustments to play nicely together, but that is a different journey from this question.\nThe lesson learned here, though, is that when dealing with screen brightness, or other startup commands, there may be multiple commands exerting an influence. So one necessary step in solving the problem is to try and determine all the relevant programs that might be having an impact.\n", "Q: Text editor to handle extremely large files I generated 300mb text file, trying to edit it using sublime 3 on xubuntu 13.10 64 bit, it's so slow and crashing, I'm not a vim/vi user, what is the best editor to work with these kind of files.\nI only need to search for and remove duplicated text.\n\nA: There is a graphical vim - gvim - that may be more acceptable to you than the less graphical versions. I haven't tried it on large files though.\nBut it really comes down to personal preference. vi could do the job, but you're not comfortable using it. That's fine, but you might not like anything suggested either. So just try a few until you find one that works both for your large files and yourself.\nThe problem you will find is that no editor will work well if it doesn't have the system resources available to do its job. There are limitations that may stop you no matter what editor you try - for example a 32bit system will cause problems for all editors past a couple of hundred meg. A lot of the better known editors will have tricks like disabling features, increasing swap space, etc, to allow large files to be edited.\n", "Q: Issues with running Ardesia on Lubuntu 13.10/14.04 I am trying to achieve the setup described by Roman in this thread: Drawing over the desktop (I'm trying Option 2, using Ardesia with xcompmgr)\nI really could use this solution to make instructional videos for my chemistry class (I'm a teacher). I have installed xcompmgr and ardesia (according to Roman's solution), but when I run ardesia I get a blank grey toolbar (without the icons showing that are supposed to be there). The buttons on the toolbar--although not visible--do work (the pen cursor shows up when I click pencil, the colors change properly, etc.), but nothing happens when I try to write anything. I have also tried using compton instead of xcompmgr. I am running lubuntu 13.10 [UPDATE: 14.04]. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated, as this would really be a killer tool for making videos for my class. Thanks.\n[UPDATE]: Upon further investigation, others seem to be having this issue with the latest version of Ardesia (1.1-1), and recommended trying the penultimate verison (1.0-1). I tried this, and while it gives slightly better results (the toolbar icons show up, annotating with text works but disappears after a few seconds, pen drawing is still impossible), this is still far from being usable. I'd still appreciate any help. Thank you.\n[UPDATE 2]: As a test, I ran a ubuntu (not lubuntu) live CD, installed ardesia on it, and ran it using compiz. This worked perfectly, but I have no interest in making the switch to ubuntu. So, I then tried installing compiz on my lubuntu system and using that with ardesia, but achieved the same failing results. Still trying to figure out what the issue might be (perhaps a problem with openbox?). I'm really no expert here, but I'm trying anything I can, and I'd really love any help that people could provide. Thank you.\n[UPDATE 3]: Upon trying the suggestion in the comments by @fossfreedom, I got the following error from ardesia:\n\nI then tried it a few more times, and I got it to not break down once, but it still wouldn't draw.

I used a macbook a little while ago and was quite amazed at how easy it was to install applications. This method seemed easier to use than both windows and all other unix based operating systems I've ever used.\nDragging a file into an install folder is about as easy as it gets. \nI do like the idea behind the ubuntu software center - but due to it almost always being out of date, it's usefulness is quite limited.\nThe functionality of apt-get is quite good as far as things go, but it's command line interface is quite unusable for non tech-savy users.\n\nA: People who come from Windows expect everything to work like Windows does. People who come from Mac expect things to work like Mac does. Ubuntu is its own OS with advantages and disadvantages compared to Mac and Windows. The reality is that installing software is by no means difficult. You have the software center, apt-get, and also Synaptic, none of which are exceedingly difficult to use. Also, a quick google search can help you find out how to install pretty much anything you can't figure out yourself.\n\nA: WOW, \nYou think its hard to install an app now? You should have seen Ubuntu just a few generations ago having to manually install every app with the command line... its not super hard but you have to remember commands, and thats always been my issue with it... now it has the software center I can use Ubuntu more then just a little thing on a live CD...

Use Libreoffice Base or MySQL to import the data and then use Libreoffice Calc to do the calculation and/or manipulation on that data. \nRegarding the limits this depends on the Libreofficeversion you are using:\n\n\n*\n\n*pre 3.3.3: limit is 65 536 rows\n\n*3.3.3 and later: 1 048 576 rows (1M)\n\n\nIf you want you can do 4m records with 3.3.3+ with 4 pages but the Base module of LibreOffice can import with almost no row limit at all if that is not enough. Here is an intro in how to do this and here is an example database with import file. Manipulating the data in Base is easy and quick. \n\nA: You can use the split command: \nsplit -l N /path-to-file\n\nWhere N is the maximum number of lines that could be in a file. \nThis command will split the file into smaller files each with N number of lines. \nUse man split for more info.\n", "Q: I want to uninstall ubuntu but my mac reads my Live USB as if it was the linux partition not the installer? So I am trying to uninstall Ubuntu Linux from my mac. I am trying to use the Live USB to go into the gparted app to delete the linux partitions. \nAlthough, something strange is happening. When my Live USB is plugged in, and I restart my macbook and hold the option key in the start up screen, I get two hard drive icons. One says windows (which is the linux partition), and the other one is reFit. I choose reFit and then I choose boot from legacy (it is the new icon that pops out and it even has an icon telling me it is an external not internal hard drive). However, when I enter it, the linux installer screen does not show up. Instead, I am asked if I want to boot linux normally, recovery mode, and all those other options. When I choose to start normally, it takes me to my old login screen and has my username and all my ** in there. IT IS NOT THE LINUX INSTALLER FROM MY LIVE USB! IT IS THE ACTUAL LINUX PARTITION. The same happens when I choose all other linux icons I get on my start up screen. \nwhy is this? why is linux reading my live USB like as if it were the actual linux partition on my mac? I really do want to uninstall linux from my mac. \n(I set it to dual booted. and I have uninstalled it before and installed it again using the same Live USB. It worked before why not 6 months later?)\n\nA: Ok I dont have Linux installed on a mac, so I am not sure but there are two thing I would try:\n\n\n*\n\n*maybe you can just format the ubuntu partition from the mac operating system? I can not help you further with that.\n\n*Maybe your usb is not installed correctly.

It will start and stop correctly as open without any order to play anything. It used to work great before Ubuntu 12.04 reinstall, but now I have this strange problem.\nSymptoms:\n - VLC does not play any kind of video. Just opens it and stays frozen on first second of file.\n - VLC opens an icon in notification bar just as it does regularly, but this time there is not an option to close it. Menu over there opens but do not respond. \n - At any attempt to play a video file VLC will open another \"dead\" icon in notification bar.\nAttempted solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*At first I thought it is lack of codecs, so I installed Ubuntu Restricted Extras - no improvement\n\n*I removed VLC .config folder and reinstalled VLC through apt-get install VLC - no improvement\n\n*I removed VLC through apt-get remove --purge VLC followed by apt-get autoremove, and reinstalled it using terminal - no improvement\n\n\nA: I had a similar issue with VLC media player on my 32bit laptop with Xubuntu 14.04 LTS. So I have tried different approaches, here's what solved it:\nFirst put in terminal:\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras\nsudo apt-get install libdvdcss2 libdvdnav4 libdvdread4\nsudo /usr/share/doc/libdvdread4/install-css.sh\nsudo apt-get install libav-tools\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nThen restart your pc.

If still not working, open VLC and go to\nTools > Preferences > Video\nMake sure \"Accelerated video output (Overlay)\" and \"Windows decorations\" are checked. Look at \"Output\" and test all available options with a video that isn't working. See if you find an option that plays the video accurately. For me, it was \"XVideoOutput (XCB)\" but it could be a different one for your needs. You can leave the \"Preferences\" window open while testing. Videos should then also be working in gxine (don't ask me why, could be packages?).\nTo play encrypted DVDs look at this official site. Necessary packages are already included in code above.\nHope this works for you, too!\n\nA: My video was not being played, but the audio was okay.

I want to set it once and forget. It has to do the switch automatically everyday.\nWhat would be the easier way to do this, considering that i'm a super newbie.\n\nA: I would recommend you looking at something like Dansguardian:\nhttp://dansguardian.org/\nThe documentation is quite good and there some resources on time based browsing restrictions.\n\nA: We'll use a combination of Iptables, Bash Scripting and Cron to achieve this.\nIptables\nIptables command to block a domain looks like this:\niptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -m string --string \"Host: yourdomain.com\" --algo bm -j DROP\n\nSimilarly, unblock command looks like:\niptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -m string --string \"Host: yourdomain.com\" --algo bm -j ACCEPT\n\nBash Scripts\nMake a file, say, block.sh, in which you define Iptables rules to block outgoing connections the domains you want to block, and a reverse script to unblock them. \n#! /usr/bin/env bash\niptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -m string --string \"Host: yourdomain.com\" --algo bm -j DROP\n# other stuff you want to do when you block a domain\n# add blocking commands for each domain here\n\nRun chmod +x block.sh to make the script executable. Now you can run it as /path/to/file/block.sh.\nThus, you'll have two scripts like:\n\n\n*\n\n*/path/to/block.sh\n\n*/path/to/unblock.sh\nCron\nNow, add a crontab entry to run your scripts like this:\nRun crontab-e. In first run, it'll ask you to configure a text editor. Use nano, if you are not sure.\nAdd these lines to the end of the file:\n0 9 * * * /path/to/block.sh\n0 17 * * * /path/to/unblock.sh\n\nSave the file with CTRL+O, press ENTER and then, CTRL+X to exit.\nNow, at 9 am everyday, the first script will block all the domains, and at 5 pm, the second script will unblock them back.\n", "Q: Generating .ovpn Config for android phone I'm using an Ubuntu Server and I wanted to use OpenVpn  for my server and my android phone.

In my case, I chose \"Default for GNOME\" since I am using Ubuntu Gnome 16.04.\n\nA: See here for a way to disable Ubuntu shortcuts programmatically and only if windows of certain applications are active. \nSpecifically, use these values (assuminging you use the JetBrains Toolbox with its standard install path; adapt otherwise):\napppattern = \"JetBrains\"\nbackupfile = \"~/.local/share/JetBrains/keymap_backup\"\n\nWhile the script runs, Ubuntu shortcuts will always work except when IDEA et al. have focus.\nI have a collection of JetBrains-specific shortcuts here; input is appreciated.\n\nA: Additionally, I suggest to disable all shortcuts for workspaces (if you don't use it) via the following commands:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings switch-to-workspace-up []\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings switch-to-workspace-down []\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings switch-to-workspace-left []\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings switch-to-workspace-right []\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings move-to-workspace-right []\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings move-to-workspace-up []\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings move-to-workspace-left []\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings move-to-workspace-down []\n\n\nA: For ubuntu 18.04 LTS \nctrl + alt + left （Intellij idea shortcut conflict）\n\n\n*\n\n*install Dconf Editor   in ubuntu software\n\n*launch Dconf Editor, go to \n/org/gnome/desktop/wm/keybindings/switch-to-workspace-left \n\n*double click like below\n\n*use default value (click Off) -> Custom value (like me or else)\n\n*you could use it in intellij idea now\n\n\nA: As a bit of reading taught me, Intellij IDEA is a keyboard-centric IDE. What it means is that a user can work with it without touching the mouse. Also, I've managed to find to keymap settings:\nFor Ubuntu\nSee How to change keyboard shortcuts?\nHere’s a list of tweaks you need to make with default system key bindings so that they won’t interfere with IntelliJ IDEA actions (listed in brackets).\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable the Shade window action, assigned to Ctrl + Alt + S (Settings dialog)\n\n*Change or disable the Lock Screen action, assigned to Ctrl + Alt + L (Reformat code)\n\n*Change or disable the Launch terminal action, assigned to Ctrl + Alt + T (Surround with)\n\n*Change or disable the Switch to workspace action, assigned to Ctrl + Alt + Arrow Keys (Navigation)\n\n*Disable the Move window action, assigned to Alt + F7 (Find usages)\n\n*Change or disable the Resize window action, assigned to Alt + F8 (Evaluate expression)\n\n\nHope this helps!\nNote: You can always revert Ubuntu shortcuts back to its default state. Just refer to How can I restore default keyboard shortcuts?, in case if you're lost.\nSource: --  Intellij IDEA Keymap\n\nA: Just to expand a little bit on AzkerM's excellent answer:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Disable the Move window action, assigned to Alt + F7 (Find usages)\n  \n  \n    \n*\n    \n*from Settings --> Keyboard --> Shortcuts --> Windows --> Move Window\n    \n  \n  \n*Change or disable the Resize window action, assigned to Alt + F8 (Evaluate expression)\n  \n  \n    \n*\n    \n*from Settings --> Keyboard --> Shortcuts --> Windows --> Resize Window\n    \n  \n\n\nA: Just some quick workaround:\nIf you have a \"Windows\" key on your keyboard, you can just add it to the whole shortcut combination - it should work. For example:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ctrl + Win + Alt + T (Surround with)\n\n*Win + Alt + F8 (Evaluate expression)\n\n\nA: I am running Ubuntu 16.04 and what was happening is when I used these key strokes (ctrl-alt-left/right), the window was resizing and placing itself to the right or left of my screen.  I tried disabling these key bindings in: Settings/Keyboard/Navigation, even though I don't have workspaces enabled.  It still didn't prevent the behavior I was seeing.\nFortunately, I opened up Compiz and stumbled across the Window Management/Grid plugin that was mapping these keys to place windows in a grid position.  I disabled this plugin and now my IntelliJ key shortcuts work fine with ctrl-alt-left/right.\n\nA: For Ubuntu 16.04 go to settings > Keyboard and find the particular combination conflicting with your desired out click on it and update the combination to a new one.\n\nA: I use Xneur to switch mistyped text to other language. My system langauge is chaged by Ctrl + Shift what blocks Intellij hotkeys like Ctrl + Shift + F (Global search) and Ctrl + Shift + C (Comment). So left shift is ignored.\n\n\n*\n\n*One solution is to change language using Ctrl_L + Shift_L and use\nCtrl_R + Shift_R for Intellij. But it is some kind of discomfort.\n\n*The other solution is to use Xneur (sudo ap-get install xneur) to\nretype mistyped text in other language. You can disable any system langauge switching and assign it to xneur hotkeys (the same Ctrl+Shift). Xneur can be added to autostarted apps.\n\nA: In addition to changing the system key bindings as suggested by the accepted answer or to changing the IDEA key map, I suggest to also check any running applications if their key maps do not clash with IDEA.\nIn my case in was Clipit and its Ctrl + Alt + P and Ctrl + Alt + O.\nCheck out this answer for more extensive tutorial on how to find conflicting apps.\n\nA: I had this problem after configuring some keymaps for my i3wm on Ubuntu.\nTo make work againg, on Gnome, I did:\n\n*\n\n*Open GNOME Tweaks (Install it, if you don't have)\n\n*Go to Keyboard & Mouse\n\n*Click in button \"Aditional Layout Options\"\n\n*I Removed aditional configs. In my case was \"Switching to another layout\" and \"Alt + Shift\".\n\nAfter that my Webstorm was able to get all my \"alt + shift\" keymaps.\n", "Q: Making certain apps open everytime at certain places?

Both versions are installable from the Software Center and allow you to define rules altering (amongst other things) the size and position of  matching windows. The community wiki can get you started on using them.\nIf you are using Unity (and thus Compiz), there's the Window Matching plugin, which essentially does the same thing.

Is there a way to indicate that I want to keep these programs during the Ubuntu install?\nThanks!\n\nA: \nif I install Ubuntu 12.04, will these programs be deleted? \n\nYes.\n\nIs there a way to indicate that I want to keep these programs during the Ubuntu install?\n\nNo ...\nBut you can sort of prepare yourself before deleting Mint. In Ubuntu (probably the same in Mint) you can create a package list of installed software with ...\ndpkg --get-selections > /tmp/installed.txt\n\nsave \"/tmp/installed.txt\" to a USB stick, after installing Ubuntu put installed.txt in /tmp/ and you can install the packages that are not yet installed with the normal setup with these 2 commands ...\ndpkg --set-selections < /tmp/installed.txt\ndselect\n\nUnless you installed packages that are not in the official repositories this should work.

So that mydaemon-parser.py was written to parse configuration files and start as many mydaemon instances as needed. mydaemon-parser.py use subprocess.call() to call external commands. I found out that mydaemon-parser.py forked 16 times to start one mydaemon instance.\nHow is upstart supposed to determine mydaemon pids.\nI want to use upstart because mydaemon is not a very stable product. I am tired to start it after it fails.\nMay be there is a better way to keep the service up?\n\nA: As the author of the above mentioned answer says, that solution is an \"ugly hack\". Have a look at the Upstart Cookbook -- instance section and see if you can create a .conf file for individual instances of mydaemon. Then when you run mydaemon-parser.py, use \nsubprocess.call('initctl start mydaemon INST=\"SomeNewInstance\"')\nThe python code will have to find a way to identify a unique value for \"SomeNewInstance\".\nYou can then have a pidless wrapper job that runs mydaemon-parser.py probably in a pre-start script. This job will have the start on and stop on stanzas.\nThe problem then would be stopping the instances. The cookbook has suggestions for this. Pay special attention to the section entitled '6.14.2 Another Instance Example', and the code block immediately preceeding that which suggests the following as an example:\ninitctl list | grep \"^foo \" | cut -d\\( -f2 | cut -d\\) -f1 | while read i\ndo\n  sudo stop foo BAR=\"$i\"\ndone\n\nI'm going to post a similar set of jobs I made to start/stop PostgreSQL clusters through Upstart.

It is simple in lay-out but the SQL created with it can be most difficult (but that is not Workbench to blame).

Making a trend-surface or sth like it would be useful too. I want also to have only 90 degree view.\n\nA: Part of the answer depend which kind of interface you want and the kind of output you require (quality, details, etc). \nIf you are OK with a command line interface, the \"classical\"  package for doing that is gnuplot, as stated in the comments. This is what I normally use for the first shot. I however think that PyXplot will normally give much nicer plots (but it is a bit more difficult to grok, and to really use it you have to know LaTeX). \nFor an example of use of spherical/cylindrical coordinates in gnuplot, see for example this page: http://www.gnuplot.info/demo/world.html --- the trick here is the set mapping command. You could need to do some transformation on your input file, however. This article by Lee Phillips seems interesting, too.\ngnuplot> help set mapping\n If data are provided to `splot` in spherical or cylindrical coordinates,\n the `set mapping` command should be used to instruct `gnuplot` how to\n interpret them.\n\n Syntax:\n       set mapping {cartesian | spherical | cylindrical}\n\n A cartesian coordinate system is used by default.\n\n For a spherical coordinate system, the data occupy two or three columns\n (or `using` entries).  The first two are interpreted as the azimuthal\n and polar angles theta and phi (or \"longitude\" and \"latitude\"), in the\n units specified by `set angles`.  The radius r is taken from the third\n column if there is one, or is set to unity if there is no third column.\n The mapping is:\n\n       x = r * cos(theta) * cos(phi)\n       y = r * sin(theta) * cos(phi)\n       z = r * sin(phi)\n\n Note that this is a \"geographic\" spherical system, rather than a \"polar\"\n one (that is, phi is measured from the equator, rather than the pole).\nPress return for more: \n\n For a cylindrical coordinate system, the data again occupy two or three\n columns.  The first two are interpreted as theta (in the units specified by\n `set angles`) and z.  The radius is either taken from the third column or set\n to unity, as in the spherical case.  The mapping is:\n\n       x = r * cos(theta)\n       y = r * sin(theta)\n       z = z\n\n The effects of `mapping` can be duplicated with the `using` filter on the\n `splot` command, but `mapping` may be more convenient if many data files are\n to be processed.  However even if `mapping` is used, `using` may still be\n necessary if the data in the file are not in the required order.\n\nIf you are looking for more graphical things, this Wikipedia page can help you. In the end I found that command-line driven programs are better for this kind of things (hated Origin with all my forces), but your mileage may vary.   \nQtiPlot, in particular, seems a nicely done program; it is open-source and free on Linux (you can install it simply with apt-get install qtiplot):\n\nbut I never used it in extended way so I can't help with it a lot. \n...But if you really like it remember that it is donation-ware(1) :-)\n(1) I am NOT related at all to this project or the developers.

For sake of example I will call it driver.run for this.\nYou'll need to write down these instructions or access them via another device as you won't have a GUI soon.\n\n\n*\n\n*Now open a tty1 session by pressing Ctrl+Alt+F1 and log on with either your root account or your local account (which should have access to the sudo command).\n\n*Now type:\nsudo service lightdm stop\nsudo apt-get remove nouveau\n\n\n*Navigate to where you saved your driver.run file with\ncd /directory/where/you/saved/it\n\n\n*Then type\nchmod +x driver.run\n./driver.run\n\n\n*Once that finishes (there's a prompt where you have to agree to licensing terms and other things) install nvidia-settings with:\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-settings-### \n\nWhere ### matches the version number you downloaded (331 in my case)\n\n*Now, reboot your computer with\nsudo reboot\n\nThis should work for you. If it doesn't, you should be able to reinstall nouveau by again opening a tty1 session with Ctrl+Alt+F1 and run \nsudo apt-get install nouveau\n\n\nA: Great answer, User224082. As a relative newbie, I lack the street cred to be able to vote, but this worked like a charmal, although I had to go to command line (Ctrl+Alt+F1) and then reboot to have it take effect. I had tried to install an upgrade to the Nvidia drivers with their own installer, but it wouldn't install because Nouveau was in use. Then Nouveau went and changed my display to 640x480 (just in spite, I'm sure). This did the trick. My Manjaro distro is hosed as well, and I'll modify it to use there as well.\n\nA: it is a great idea to purge xserver-xorg-video-nouveau but at my system it still does system calls to nouveau. these are generating error messages on TTY until i reach the graphical display.\ni recommend also: blacklisting the nouveau module from kernel via /etc/modprobe.d and updating the initramfs.\n", "Q: Permission denied to view a folder.

And fetchmail by itself tries to use ssl in the default configuration, e.g. it issues the STLS command after opening a plain connection.

Et voilà\n\nA: After installing python 3.3 using a PPA for Ubuntu 12.04, I installed easy_install 3.3 using locally using the following commands\nwget http://python-distribute.org/distribute_setup.py\npython3.3 -m distribute_setup install --user\neasy_install-3.3 --user pip\n\nThis avoids polluting the site's installation of pip and easy_install. Finally, I added $HOME/.local/bin to my path. Now I can run pip3.3!\n\nA: To add to dmeu's answer, you may have to update your /etc/apt/sources.list to include mirrors from a more recent repository, such as trusty. \nsudo vi /etc/apt/sources.list\nsudo apt-get update\n\nTo clarify on what Long-term support means, it does not necessarily mean that they are keeping precise up-to-date with the latest and greatest software. Sure, you will get a few updates from it, but then you'll have cases where certain packages don't exist, like python3-pip, which does exist in the trusty repo, for example. \nWhat LTS means, is that they are keeping precise on the main repo, so that your package manager doesn't break. This will ultimately give you a chance perform an apt-get update, upgrade, and dist-upgrade when 12.04 finally becomes obsolete. They call it support, rather than cutting-edge, for a reason.\nIf the apt-get route still doesn't work, you may also try downloading a .deb package of python3-pip, and using dpkg, a.k.a. the debian package manager, to install it\nsudo dpkg -i <name-of-package>.deb\n\nHope this helps.\n\nA: 2018 Update: This is still attracting upvotes which worries me.\n12.04 has been unsupported for about a year now. The best way you can install pip3 is by upgrading to a newer, supported version of Ubuntu. You have 3 LTS versions to pick from.\n\nWhile on more modern versions of Ubuntu you could just sudo apt-get install python3-pip (and then use pip3), a Python 3 copy of pip was never packaged for 12.04.\nTherefore you need to follow the more old fashioned install route with easy_install:    \nsudo apt-get install python3-setuptools\nsudo easy_install3 pip\n\nNow, there is every chance that this will clash with Python 2's pip and override /usr/bin/pip, because it will install a python3 based /usr/local/bin/pip which is also in Ubuntu 12.04's $PATH.\nIt shouldn't overwrite it so as long as you know that, it might be acceptable. However it might be best to start investigating the happy world of virtualenv as this answer suggests.\nAlternatively you could rename the easy-installed python3 version of pip:\nsudo mv /usr/local/bin/pip /usr/local/bin/pip-3\n\nThen you can confirm your existing pip is still python2.7 based:\npip --version\n\n\nA: If you work with several versions of python on the same machine, it might be useful to work with virtual environments. This allows you to work with as many instances of python you want, each with their own set of packages. This is very useful if you're working with several versions of python, and/or if your projects require different versions of the same package(s).\nTo set this up:\nsudo pip install virtualenv \n\nThis can be done with ANY pip, so also with the standard pip using python 2.7. \nThen, to make a virtual environment with python3 as the interpreter, do:\nvirtualenv my_py3 --python=/usr/bin/python3\nsource my_py3/bin/activate # to activate the python3 environemt\n\nThen install any packages you might want using\npip install <package> # no sudo required now, as you're IN the virtual environment\n\nTo stop the virtual environment, simple type:\ndeactivate\n\n\nA: by now my favorite option is to install anaconda or miniconda for python3: https://www.continuum.io/downloads\nAny package can be installed by conda install package-name\nIf you need python2, you can create a virtual environment:\nconda create -n python2 python=2.7 anaconda\nsource activate python2\nSee details here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/24415581/551694\n\nA: I tried following commands:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install python3-pip\n\nThis seemed to do the trick for me.

Support for UEFI appeared in 11.10,\n  but has become more reliable in next versions. Support for UEFI\n  SecureBoot appeared in 12.10 and 12.04.2.\n  \n*Set up your firmware (BIOS) to boot the disk in UEFI mode (see the\n  \"Identifying if the computer boots the HDD in EFI mode\" paragraph\n  below)\n  \n*Then: nothing special is required if you use the automatic installer\n  of Ubuntu (\"Install Ubuntu alongside others\" or \"Erase the disk and\n  install Ubuntu\"). Important: if you have a pre-installed Windows and\n  you want to keep it, do not choose \"Erase the disk and install\n  Ubuntu\". if you use the manual partitioning (\"Something else\"), the\n  difference is that you will have to set the /boot/efi mount point to\n  the EFI partition. And if there was not any EFI partition on your HDD,\n  you first will have to create it (see the \"Creating an EFI partition\"\n  paragraph below).\n\nActually you need to be careful with the partitioning if you make them manually because most new laptops contain a \"recovery-partition\" which replaces the installation CDs of Windows. \n", "Q: Samba problem -- is it a firewall issue?

Does anyone know of a way to at least open it and transfer files out to another drive? I can format it afterwards but getting the information out first is of utmost importance.\n\nA: Found my own answer and answered this other question\nIt's very very simple. \nRun sudo apt-get install ldmtool then make sure your drive is actually there by checking with sudo fdisk -l and once you have ldmtool downloaded, try to see if the harddrive is recognized by running sudo ldmtool scan. The print out should be a json like string with the device id. Finish by writing sudo ldmtool create all. DONE.

Very grateful if anyone could help!\nI'm setting up a new Ubuntu Server. I've assembled a machine and installed \"Ubuntu Server 12.04.3 LTS\". The installation went fine. But the system hanged at boot - and the monitor went to sleep. I found help online, saying it could be caused be an unsupported video card. And yes - when I add \"nomodeset\" at boot I get a login prompt.\nI did a \"jockey-text --list\", and found that the supported Ubuntu-driver was \"fglrx\". I installed that with apt-get.\nI thought that would solve it, but it didn't. Now, when I boot without \"nomodeset\", I get a blank screen. The monitor doesn't go to sleep, but nothing is shown no matter what I do. The system is up, though - I can ping it and do a Alt+PrntScr R-S-E-I-N-U-B-reset. If I boot with \"nomodeset\" and then do a \"startx\" manually, I get the same blank screen.\nAny ideas? The \"fglrx\"-driver should word fine with my card. (The card was released 2010, the driver is from 2012.) I looked at the Ubuntu wiki at \"http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Precise_Installation_Guide\", and tested generating a new xorg.conf file and a couple of other things.

A menu should load up, select update grub and hopefully that should allow you to select windows or Ubuntu at the grub menu rather than having to worry about the bios.\n", "Q: Installing tarball package of the latest version of Firefox for Ubuntu 12.04 Currently I have Ubuntu 12.04 version and current version of the firefox I have is 21.0.

For this, you don't need an internet connection. You can download .deb file from my personal cloud from here.

It may be worth noting that I do not have a separate home and / directory, so I will have to make all of my files separate.  Thanks!\n\nA: Arch linux is for more experienced users. If you don't know how to setup a triple boot with two linuxes then it is very likely that you won't be happy with Arch.\nBut if you still want to experiment:  During the Arch install you can skip installing a boot-loader and then your present GRUB will be kept. (That means you just don't issue commands which install a boot-loader.) If you do this then after the installer finishes and you reboot the Arch won't be present in the GRUB menu. You will have to boot Ubuntu and run sudo update-grub, which will find Arch and update the GRUB menu. After this you can boot Arch from the original GRUB which came with your Ubuntu. I think this is the most simple way to setup a triple boot with Arch and Ubuntu. \n\nA: I've never had a reason to change GRUB settings yet but it shouldn't be an issue, in theory you could have as many OS's as you have partitions/HDD's.\nsince my PC tries to load windows first i used EasyBCD to setup my Dual boot, but you have the option to add OS's to your hearts content (space permitting).\n", "Q: Automatically connect to a wireless network using CLI I need my machine to connect to a wireless network automatically every time it starts\nI'm running a headless server (10.04) and I use following commands to manually connect to the network\nsudo iwconfig wlan0 essid \"SSID_Name\"\nsudo iwconfig wlan0 key XXXXX\nsudo iwconfig wlan0 key open\nsudo iwconfig wlan0 mode Managed\nsudo dhclient wlan0\n\nI will appreciate if we can do that by modifying etc/network/interfaces file\nPlease note that my router is running wep, thanks in advance\n\nA: Automatic Wireless Connection when Login\nFor cases where you would like to login automatically to a wireless router here are the steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the interface file:  \nsudo nano /etc/network/interfaces\n\n\n*Add the following information (Assuming your interface is called wlan0):\nauto wlan0\niface wlan0 inet static\naddress ASSIGNED_IP\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\ngateway THE_GATEWAY\nwireless-essid YOURSSID\nwireless-key WIRELESSKEY_HERE\n\n\n*Save the file and reboot computer.\n\nA: Please amend your /etc/network/interfaces file to:\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\nauto wlan0\niface wlan0 inet dhcp\nwireless-ssid SSID_Name\nwireless-key XXXXX\n\nIf you expect to ssh and ftp into the server, you need to know where it is.

Out of the 320gb of hard drive space my computer came with, only 33 GB were partitioned to Ubuntu, with the rest of the space (288 GB or so) going to windows NTFS. Of those 33 GB, 11 GB are allocated to the system and 20 GB to the home directory; 2 more GB are swap and one last gigabyte is unallocated.\nAs I currently stand, I am running 13.04 and my root partition is 93% full with very little on my desktop. In order to repartition my disk, I'll need to upgrade to 13.10 as I can't find a 13.04 ISO on the Ubuntu website; once I do that I'll boot into a live USB system and repartition from there.\nIs there some way I can just delete the Windows partition and reallocate? I don't think I can, but I'm asking anyway.\nAlso, can I reassign the unallocated space (all 1 GB of it) to my filesystem?\n\nA: You can format(delete) the windows partition from Ubuntu (using gparted) but you can't resize an active filesystem!  To add space to Ubuntu you need to do it from \"somewhere else\" and of course your best option is a live usb. this question may help you I need help with increasing the size of the file-system partition. Partitioning-o-phobia! feed me back :)\np.s: there's no need whatsoever to upgrade Ubuntu. you  wouldn't be doing partitioning from it in the first place.\n\nA: No need for reinstall with live CD!!\ngparted is the best partitioner software i have ever used, (and i have used a fair few Win32 versions) boot up Ubuntu and search for it in the software center\nmake sure that you have defraged your NTFS partition before altering any partition sizes to minimize any messups that may happen from doing so.\nBack up all your data would be the best bet, just in case. changing partition sizes may cause data loss.\njust shrink the NTFS part, add a new EXT partition\nUbuntu will see it as a new HDD\nIf you are seriously wanting the file system to have the extra space, then booting from LiveCD will free up the file system on the HDD (gparted will no longer show the blue box around that particular partition), then you can grow this partition in the safest manner.\nif you want rid of the windows partition altogether then just delete the NTFS partition, allocating that section to EXT will get rid of it for good. Just remember to give yourself room for the Linux-swap partition (best practice is usually 2xRAM when under 2gb of ram)\nJob done.\n", "Q: Boot ubuntu from USB option not available? So I followed the steps here and downloaded Ubuntu onto my 32gb usb drive and I am trying to figure out how to boot up from the USB.\nWhen I go to my boot menu on my laptop I get boot from notebook hard drive and boot from live cd/dvd. No option to boot from external hard drive. I went to my bios and added network boot to the options but none of those seemed like what I wanted to do so I didn't select those, i did not want to mess anything up. \nMy machine is an HP x16-1025nr entertainment notebook PC Current OS is Windows Vista. \nEDIT\nI also have a blank CD, if anybody knows how to boot from a blank CD I will try that too.\nI have a program on it to download the *.iso to the disk , it says mounting image, but when I boot from CD nothing happens it goes straight to Windows Vista which makes me think the image was not mounted correctly. I don't really care which way, USB or CD I just want it to work without wiping my hard drive.\n\nA: My USB stick was detected as a removable HDD, so instead of a removable device see if a flash drive has been added to your list of hard disks to boot from in the bios.(while it is plugged in)\nIf not try F11 for a manual boot menu (my Asus Mother board has this option).\nTo burn an ISO to a CD, don't just drag it to the CD, this will only put the file on the CD, use Nero/IMG burn or which ever is your profered CD writing software and 'Burn disk image' this will unpack the ISO onto the CD and create a bootable disk.\nIm sure that from win 7 upwards right clicking will give the option to 'burn image' also\nThe Ubuntu website has a step by step guide for creating a bootable CD.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/BurningIsoHowto\nthe boot priority order remains the same make sure that CD-rom is higher than HDD and it will boot from the CD\n\nA: Try the \"boot from the hard drive\" option. On my computer I do that, it then shows two options, one for the internal hard drive and one for the USB. Try and feed me back\noh yes, you should be using the boot menu in the first place. sorry, forgot to say that. you should find an instruction to press some button (normally del or f11 or f12), you should see something like \"press del for boot menu\" right after you start your computer.\n\nA: If you want to install Ubuntu OS from a blanck DVD, what you can do is to download it (as you probably already did), and burn the *.iso file onto the DVD using Windows Vista.\nIf you have any other questions, please let us know.\n", "Q: How to hide zip files in a jpg file in Ubuntu? I need a way to hide zip files in a file .\nExample i have a 1.zip , 2.zip ,3.zip contain data\nI need to concatenates them in a new file called example.jpg.\nIs there a way ?\n\nA: Hiding secret information in images is a topic of steganography. Some linux tools which deal with hiding information in images:\n\n\n*\n\n*steghide (sudo apt-get install steghide)\n\n*stepic (sudo apt-get install python-stepic)\n\n*outguess(sudo apt-get install outguess)\n\n\n\nUsing steghide:\nSteghide supports BMP and JPG images. To embed a secret.zip file in a cover.jpg and make a new file for the embedded jpg use\nsteghide --embed -ef secret.zip -cf cover.jpg -sf embedded.jpg\n\nsteghide will prompt for a password, type in one, this will be needed to recover the secret. After this you can view embedded.jpg just like a normal picture, you won't really notice that it is manipulated.\nTo recover the secret run\nsteghide --extract -sf embedded.jpg \n\nType in the password and your secret will be recovered with its original name, secret.zip. \nAn important thing to know that an image can only contain a certain amount of secret data, since putting a lot of data into the image would need too much manipulations on the image and the image will be no more like the original. To view how much secret data can steghide embed in a certain image, run:\nsteghide --info cover.jpg\n\nFor other features of steghide look in man steghide.\n\nWith python-stepic you use these commands:\n\n\n*\n\n*for embedding:\nstepic --encode -t secret.zip -i cover.png -o embedded.png\n\n\n*for extracting:\nstepic --decode -i embedded.png -o recovered.zip\n\nstepic uses the Python Image Library so it should work with most of the image formats, but png is recommended for the output image format by the authors.

How to get them, and how to format them to be sent by email?\n\nA: There is many information that you could send in this case:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Public IP\n\n*Result of nmap, there's always \"Tim's iPhone\", \"Herbert Müller-Desktop\", \"mrbrown.companyxy.net\" if I make a quick scan in public networks\n\n*VOIP Configuration of the router\n\n*Username/ Password of the WAN connection of the router\n\n*Webcam picture ;)\n\n\nThere is a funny video from a hacker's conference, about a stolen pc from a hacker. The thief was caught because of the information the hacker collected by his remote.\nIn your case, i'd rather connect to one of my machines, whenever the notebook is turned on, so you can do what you want with your notebook, once connected:\nssh yourhomedesktop -R 2222:localhost:22\n\nNow you can login to your notebook from yourhomedesktop like:\nssh localhost -p 2222\n\n\nA: I would say the best info you can send to that e-mail is the public IP. You can use an script to retrieve it easily with:\nwget -O - http://ip.tupeux.com | tail\n\nThis will write the public IP to the standard output (you can redirect it to a plaintext and send it trough email, or use another method.\nWith the public IP you can denounce and inform to the authorities, they may be able then to locate geographically your laptop.\n", "Q: Issue with partitioned disk while trying to install ubuntu 13.10 along with Windows 8 I have an installed windows 8 OS on my C drive and looking forward to install Ubuntu 13.10 as a dual boot alongside Windows 8 OS.

I'll reply back when I test it.\n\nA: Ubuntu installer, by default, recognizes both Windows 8 and Windows 8.1.\nIf Windows is not being recognized by Ubuntu Installer, this means that it probably won't auto-configure Windows 8 into GRUB. You can try the following, but there's still a chance that this might break your Windows bootloader and you'll have to reinstall it (See last). \nIt's always wise to back up (Windows). Now that you've been warned, \n\n\n*\n\n*Instead of default installation, use custom partitions. See this.\n\n*Try booting up. If GRUB gets Windows, you're good.

Then I ran the ubuntu cd I made. Installed, then all good. Now, I realized I cannot access the BIOS, at all, even when no hard drives are connected. I am pressing the right button, DEL. I have tired all the other keys on my keyboard, I know that is not the problem.\nOther problem is that I took a hard drive with windows 7 on it from another computer, and put it in mine (Yes I installed it correctly). Grub does not detect it. I have updated Grub, used boot fixer, and a lot of other stuff. I think the key lies in the BIOS, if I could get to it, I think I could fix it myself\n\nA: This is a mess : ) ! And lack of information too (especially system configuration, notebook or not, one hard drive or more, live CD Ubuntu or installed one), but I'll try help.\nThis doesn't look like an Ubuntu problems, since it doesn't affect BIOS. Shouldn't at least.\nFurthermore as far as I know currently Ubuntu 13 is a beta version and 12 is a released version. Beta version may be not a good choice while having additional problems.\n\nThe Hard Drive and opening BIOS options in UEFI\nWe are assuming that the hard drive isn't paralyzing the system, but it may be the case. Some system won't even enter BIOS with a broken drive, while (presumably) waiting for its' response. In that case\n1) Can You enter BIOS without any hard drive?\n2) If not, are You sure that Del key is working and You're fast enough with the pressing? It worked before using Ubuntu, right (sounds weird)?\n3) If You're experienced and it won't cancel warranty, reset the BIOS settings manually (disconnect power source and computer's power battery, remove motherboard's battery for 30 sec and put it back in) which by the way commonly speeds the booting up and more. Risky for notebooks since those commonly have hidden batteries. Mean!\nThat pretty much is all I can think of having provided info and at this point You should have entered BIOS, know what is wrong or have other ideas.\n\nWin7 GRUB detection\nWhat I deducted is that You just took a hard drive with Win7 installed on it from one computer and put it into another. GRUB won't see Win7 until You tell it to, the easiest case is to run sudo update-grub at the terminal, but making sure that GRUB options are set correctly may be needed first. There is a plenty of GRUB help in this website and You're having the best info to find what You need. But even when Win7 will be detected it won't have installed drivers for it's new location - new computer, so it shouldn't work all nice, if at all. Because Windows is not meant to jump around different computers and not prepared to.\n\nA: BIOS\nIf You could enter BIOS at some point and You can no longer do that since changing its' settings, it seems obvious that some of Your changes made the problem. No idea what precisely, for example disabling 'USB Legacy/Support' will cause not responding USB keyboard until OS like Ubuntu will load itself with a keyboard driver. So just for cases like this, there is a way to...\nLoad default (or fail-safe) BIOS settings manually\nDepending on the motherboard (check its' manual, printed or on the internet) there may be a jumper or a switch for this action, making the whole thing a lot easier (instruction in the manual), but if there is none:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disconnect all power supply from the turned off computer (required for staying alive during the process).\n\n*Open the case and search for the round about half-inch diameter battery on the motherboard.\n\n*Carefully take it off, maybe using a small, flat screwdriver (not making any damage to the board or the battery) - this will stop flow of current that powers 'remembering' the BIOS settings.\n\n*Wait 30 seconds and put the battery back where it belongs on the motherboard - so any future BIOS changes will be remembered.\n\n*Connect power supply to the computer and try entering BIOS by keyboard.\n\n\nA: Download your BIOS update program from your computer manufacturers website.  You can try installing it with Wine in ubuntu but likely will not work (worth a try though). Chances are your computer does not have a bios chip but rather loads the bios from a specific hard disk.  Same as holding SHIFT key immediately after (or even before) power on.  Using the same Windows installation from one computer to another usually works (atleast with my testing) unless your bios is located on your hard drive and you have no bios chip. To reinstall your bios read the artical http://www.linuxinsight.com/how-to-flash-motherboard-bios-from-linux-no-dos-windows-no-floppy-drive.html and see if its possible (comments are newest first so dont read backwards).\n", "Q: Setting up a local repository: need help I am attempting to set up a local Ubuntu repository following this, but I need some help.

Is it right that I just leave them as they are?\n\n*Am I missing an important step?\n\n\nI haven't figured out a solution after doing some research. Any help would be appreciated.\n\nA: First question, you don't have to use apt-mirror its just for getting .deb files into your local repo. You can get the .deb by other means:\n\n\n*\n\n*you can install the application you need on online system with internet connection then you can cop the .deb files from /var/cache/apt/archives to your local repo.\n\n*If you don't want to install you can just download the .deb of needed package by sudo apt-get dowload package-name then you can find the .deb in your home so you can move to your local repo.\n\n\nSecond question, you don't have to unzip the Packages.gz. Its a file containing archive of packages founded in your local repo. you have just to keep it there and don't mess with.\nThird question, just move on with the link you provide and you ara fine. If you don't get the needed just check this How to create a local APT repository?. you can find many methods to make a local repo either with web server(apache2) or just a local directory.\n", "Q: Just installed UBUNTU 12.04.3 - XTERM XT Error Can't display I am new, just installed Ubuntu and trying to see the output of commands.

(It happens to me with USB mouse, my touch pad damaged) \n\n*Using xinput and device name instead of id:\nexport touchpad_id=`xinput list | awk 'gsub(\".*AlpsPS/2 ALPS DualPoint TouchPad[ \\t]*id=*\",\"\") { print $1 }'` ; if [ `xinput list-props $touchpad_id | awk '/Device Enabled/ { print $4 }'` -eq 1 ]; then xinput set-prop $touchpad_id \"Device Enabled\" 0 ; else xinput set-prop $touchpad_id \"Device Enabled\" 1 ; fi\n\nMy touchpad name is AlpsPS/2 ALPS DualPoint TouchPad got it from xinput list, replace it with your device name.\nGet device id by name AlpsPS/2 ALPS DualPoint TouchPad and store it in touchpad_id:\nexport touchpad_id=`xinput list | awk 'gsub(\".*AlpsPS/2 ALPS DualPoint TouchPad[ \\t]*id=*\",\"\") { print $1 }'`\n\nQuery status:\nxinput list-props $touchpad_id | awk '/Device Enabled/ { print $4 }'\n\nDisable:\nxinput set-prop $touchpad_id \"Device Enabled\" 0\n\nEnable:\nxinput set-prop $touchpad_id \"Device Enabled\" 1\n\n\nA: Special touchpad key doesn't work on my Lenovo Ideapad 320 either (Ubuntu 16.04).\nI installed Touchpad Indicator and configured it to turn off touchpad automatically when mouse is plugged in. The app started doing its job after I changed switch method to Xinput in its settings.\n\nA: I think this site will answer your question.\nI do not own any lenovo to answer it\nSITE\nhttp://mydevelopedworld.wordpress.com/2013/11/30/how-to-configure-new-lenovo-x240-touchpad-on-ubuntu-13-10/\n", "Q: Quiet hissing out of audio This is not a duplicate, from what I've found.\nBasically, a very quiet (but very noticeable with nice headphones) white noise/hiss is emitted. I'm on the latest version 13. Here's what I've found:\n\n\n*\n\n*alsamixer does nothing\n\n*When I MUTE the speakers, the sound goes away\n\n*The noise starts right before the gui to login appears on bootup.\n\n*When I unplug the machine, the white noise will stop unless I am playing something, in which case it will have white noise until a few seconds after the music stops, and it 'pops' off.\n\n*This didn't happen with Windows 8.\n\n*I believe it's been happening since the clean Ubuntu install.\n\n*Turning volume up/down doesn't affect white noise volume. Only muting completely eliminates.\n\n\nPlease help a guy out. :-( This is make-or-break for Ubuntu... I need my music!\n\nA: If this is a laptop, then check in your mixer (here, xfce4-mixer) that the capture volume isn't set to maximum (or too high). Also check that the mic boost channels are set at reasonable levels. Sometimes I get hissing on my laptop because of too high volume for the microphone channels.\n", "Q: how to separate installed packages based on their installation type? Consider a case that I have few list of packages installed in my Ubuntu. Among them few are installed from apt-get,aptitude & few from source tars. \nHow can I group them separately  based on their installation process.\nThank you.\n\nA: The ones that were installed using APT/DPKG or any package manager can be listed easily. The installed from sources, tarballs, summary anything installed manually without a package maintainer is more tricky. You would need a list of all possible files and the software that installed it and such list is either too big and possibly unmaintained. So the answer is no, there's no way to list the package that were installed manually from sources unless they use some sort of package manager.\n", "Q: How can I install different versions of PHP in xampp I installed the latest version of xampp i.e. 1.8.3-2 in ubuntu 12.04.\nI found that it include php 5.5.6 and I want the lesser php version to work on my site.\nHow can i install the new version or multiple version in xampp so that my site can work.\nI am working on magento and it does not support php 5.5 so any idea how can I do this.\nThanks\n\nA: I dont't know if it is possible but you can install it manualy from the terminal.\nsudo apt-get install apache2 php5\n\nand then type your password for the user.

Later I found out the backup file didn't write the remote directory at all. Then I found out that I could not cd into the remote disk as root ! So eventually I create the same task with crontab -e and everything works as I expected.\n", "Q: will I lose my data in other partitions when I install Ubuntu alongside Windows? I want to use both ubuntu and windows7 as dual booting, so please let me know because I had already lost data when I installed ubuntu as replace widows 7 with ubuntu, so I don't want to lose again.\n\nA: If you do it correctly NO data is deleted during installation of Ubuntu. There are just 2 steps in creating a dual boot: \n\n\n*\n\n*Create unallocated space. Use a gParted live cd or partition magic to do this.\n\n*Use the unallocated space to install Ubuntu during the installation fase.\n\n\nIf done with these 2 steps the only partition that is getting changed is the unallocated one. \nBut as always: when using an operating system making a regular backup is the best method to keep your data safe. When changing partitions (or any alteration to your machine) it is wise to make another backup before committing these changes. And of course make sure the backup is indeed correctly created (so it can be restored if need be). Safety first.\n", "Q: I have a larger screen attached to my laptop I have a larger screen attached to my laptop, which is a Toshiba, when I close the lid both screens close into sleep mode, what command do I use to stop this.\nI am a new user on Ubuntu 13.10, I am also new to Linux OS.\nWith thanks\nPietboks\n\nA: I have this, too, with my laptop.

The mentioned line local7.* /var/log/samba/log.audit I placed at the end of my existing /etc/rsyslog.conf file.  It seemed a bit out of place there, but after restarting everything, the mentioned file was created, presumably by the syslog daemon, so I assumed this was working.\nBut it stayed at a size of 0 bytes.  After creation of the file, nothing was logged there.\nIt took me some time but then I found that all logging was done into the default syslog file (/var/log/syslog).\nI guess the config line in /etc/rsyslog.conf is correct, but somehow the way it was supposed to be addressed in the /etc/samba/smb.conf is not working.\nI repeat in short what the blog above suggested to do:\nAdd the lines\nvfs objects = full_audit\n\nfull_audit:prefix = %u|%I|%m|%S\nfull_audit:success = mkdir rename unlink rmdir pwrite\nfull_audit:failure = none\nfull_audit:facility = local7\nfull_audit:priority = NOTICE\n\nto the existing smb.conf and add the line\nlocal7.*                        /var/log/samba/log.audit\n\nto the syslog.conf (I took my existing /etc/rsyslog.conf for this).\nCan anybody tell me how to fix this so that the logging is done into the intended file /var/log/samba/log.audit?\n\nA: I had the same problem until I changed the output log file location to /var/log instead of /var/log/samba. I'm not sure why, but it seems rsyslog on my system won't write a facility to a file outside /var/log.\nHope that helps, and if anyone knows how to configure ryslog to allow other locations it would be nice to know.\n\nA: The /var/log/samba/log.audit file must have syslog as the owning user, and adm as the owning group.\nIf it is not like this, run:\nsudo chown /var/log/samba/log.audit syslog:adm\n\n", "Q: Gnuplot 4.6.4 in Ubuntu 12.04 I tried to install Gnuplot-4.6.4 in Ubuntu 12.04 after following http://priyansmurarka.wordpress.com/2013/07/02/gnuplot-on-ubuntu-12-04/ but it gave following error after sudo make\n\nIn file included from wxterminal/wxt_gui.cpp:96:0:\n  wxterminal/wxt_gui.h:161:3: error: #error \"wxt does not know if this\n  platform has to be mono- or multi-threaded\" wxterminal/wxt_gui.cpp: In\n  function ‘bool wxt_exec_event(int, int, int, int, int, wxWindowID)’:\n  wxterminal/wxt_gui.cpp:3331:7: error: ‘wxt_sendevent_fd’ was not\n  declared in this scope wxterminal/wxt_gui.cpp:3336:13: error:\n  ‘wxt_sendevent_fd’ was not declared in this scope\n  wxterminal/wxt_gui.cpp: In function ‘void wxt_atexit()’:\n  wxterminal/wxt_gui.cpp:3593:34: warning: ignoring return value of\n  ‘FILE* freopen(const char*, const char*, FILE*)’, declared with\n  attribute warn_unused_result [-Wunused-result]\n  wxterminal/wxt_gui.cpp:3594:34: warning: ignoring return value of\n  ‘FILE* freopen(const char*, const char*, FILE*)’, declared with\n  attribute warn_unused_result [-Wunused-result]\n\nHow to install it?\n\nA: This thread solved the problem\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2189523\nIt can be installed from this PPA https://launchpad.net/~gladky-anton/+archive/precise-backports\n", "Q: SSH log login attempt details I my office we are using Ubuntu Server 12.04.

I use Emacs and therefore, I use a lot of combinations/shortcuts/bindings all the time. The problem is that when I press and hold a key, for instance, Ctrl for searching Ctrl+S, if I want to keep looking I just hold it, but in this VirtualMachine after a few seconds the Ctrl key is released (without me releasing it) and I finish writing a bunch of 's', in this case. Another simpler example would be, changing windows with Alt+Tab, after a while Alt is released and I end up pressing just Tab in the last window changed. I  guess this has something to do with some kind of refreshing of the peripherals or something, but it is really annoying. \nAny ideas on how to solve it?\nThanks a lot!\nUPDATE\nMurphy's Law working here. I have been having this issue for the last 3 months (since I started working with this virtual machine), but suddenly when I asked this question I works just fine. I guess I'll have to ask more often :) Anyway, I don't think this will last forever, so if anyone has any idea about why this is happening and how to avoid it, it would be great!\nUPDATE 2\nI knew I shouldn't have said anything. It is back! haha\n\nA: I assume you're using the right Control key. That's set as the \"host\" key in VirtualBox which means it gives the keyboard back to the host machine (with focus on VirtualBox).\nYou can change this in the VirtualBox preferences (File → Preferences → Input → Virtual Machine → Host Key Combination).\n", "Q: Why the need for a reboot with new HDD dock? Why is it necessary to reboot the computer for the OS to see a new HDD dock with a new HDD attached?\nBackground for the question:\nI recently purchased a new 3TB HDD. When docking it in my old HDD dock, I ran into the problem that gparted reported the drive as being only 746GB or so. After some searching on the internet, I figured out that my old HDD docking stations only support drives up to 2TB. So I ran to the shop and bought a new dock which explicitly support drives up to 4TB. I plugged the power, plugged the USB, and inserted my 3TB drive into the dock. I fired gparted, but, horror!, gparted didn't see the drive at all. I looked at the box of the dock and saw that it supported USB 3.0 while my mainboard only supports USB 2.0. I was confused because I thought the newest USB version was backward compatible. I ran back to the shop and explained my problem. They assured that, as I thought, USB 3.0 is backward compatible with 2.0 and regardless of what my mainboard supports, it should be able to read it (albeit at USB 2.0 speed, obviously). They asked me whether I used windows XP, Vista or Windows 7. I said I use Linux. They said: \"Haha!, there's the problem: on the box of the docking station, it doesn't say it supports Linux!\". I thought: \"F*** You!\" and said: \"The problem is not the Linux OS, as I am certain that it supports 4TB drives, USB 3.0 and this since much longer than windows has, and if I were to limit my hardware purchases to items which officially support linux (as printed on the box), I wouldn't be able to purchase any hardware at all!\". So, they advised me to reboot my computer to see if my OS would see the new docking station and the HDD within it. I thanked them, went home, and tried to reboot the computer, and, indeed, gparted now saw the full 3TB of the new HDD! :)\nNow, I have been using Linux for 13 years, and I have long lost the habit of rebooting the computer after installing new software and new USB hardware. I was sceptical that simply rebooting the OS would fix my problem, but it did. The question now is: why?\n\nA: Well, you ask \"Why you had to reboot to make sure the module is loaded\". Lets remember that through Linux doesn't need reboot for most of operations there are still modules out in the wild that still doesn't behave correctly (I'm thinking about some VM software that if you don't restart it wouldn't work at all), with hardware sometimes it doesn't initialize correctly if isn't loaded at boot, etc.\nThrough you really trust Linux to comply with true Plug&Play, is difficult to really get all the hardware and corner cases such as yours. It would be interesting to see the dmesg output when you plugged the drive but I doubt you have it around anymore.\n", "Q: Vagrant Up and annoying NFS password asking Sorry for the language mistakes I've made.\nI'm trying to prevent vagrant asking the password when it mounts shared folders by NFS:\n [server] Exporting NFS shared folders...\n Preparing to edit /etc/exports. Administrator privileges will be required...\n [sudo] password for timur: #!!!\n\nI've red many online resources like github and other author's posts, but nothing work for me...\nI tried the instructions was found here. I don't have deep cli working knowledge. So could anybody give correct solution for my problem?\n\nA: The official Vagrant docs now cover this: \nhttps://www.vagrantup.com/docs/synced-folders/nfs.html#root-privilege-requirement\nYou need to add entries to the /etc/sudoers file, and the way to edit that is to type this at the terminal: sudo visudo\nType your password, and you're editing the file.\nYou'll want to paste these lines below (depending on whether you are running Vagrant on OS X or Linux.\nIf you're not familiar with vim, which it opens in, this page helped. Basically, copy the appropriate block of text below. Then, in visudo, go to the spot you want to paste text into the file (the end of the file is fine), and hit \"i\" to go into insert mode. CMD+V to paste your text. Then, hit ESC, then type :w to save your changes and then :q to quit.\nAs of version 1.7.3, the sudoers file in OS X should have these entries:\nCmnd_Alias VAGRANT_EXPORTS_ADD = /usr/bin/tee -a /etc/exports\nCmnd_Alias VAGRANT_NFSD = /sbin/nfsd restart\nCmnd_Alias VAGRANT_EXPORTS_REMOVE = /usr/bin/sed -E -e /*/ d -ibak /etc/exports\n%admin ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: VAGRANT_EXPORTS_ADD, VAGRANT_NFSD, VAGRANT_EXPORTS_REMOVE\n\nAnd Linux should have these entries:\nCmnd_Alias VAGRANT_EXPORTS_CHOWN = /bin/chown 0\\:0 /tmp/*\nCmnd_Alias VAGRANT_EXPORTS_MV = /bin/mv -f /tmp/* /etc/exports\nCmnd_Alias VAGRANT_NFSD_CHECK = /etc/init.d/nfs-kernel-server status\nCmnd_Alias VAGRANT_NFSD_START = /etc/init.d/nfs-kernel-server start\nCmnd_Alias VAGRANT_NFSD_APPLY = /usr/sbin/exportfs -ar\n%sudo ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: VAGRANT_EXPORTS_CHOWN, VAGRANT_EXPORTS_MV, VAGRANT_NFSD_CHECK, VAGRANT_NFSD_START, VAGRANT_NFSD_APPLY\n\nNote that these change from one version of Vagrant to another, so the above might be outdated. The important thing is that the docs now cover it.\n\nA: The exact commands can change between Vagrant versions, so it's impossible to list ones that would always work.\nAnyway, the sudoers rules in this gist should be still quite close. Check out /var/log/auth.log if it reveals the actual commands for your Vagrant version and adapt the rules accordingly.\n\nA: For anyone doing this for OSX (I'm on MacOS Sierra Version 10.12.6) I had a hard time with permissions even after adding those lines. This post really helped:\nhttps://github.com/cogitatio/vagrant-hostsupdater/issues/50\n\nBasicly its the fact that you dont have permissions set for the that folder yourself. So you need to run:\nsudo chmod +a \"$USER allow write,append\" /etc/hosts\n\n\nA: adding , nfs_export: false at the end of the config.vm.synced_folder-lines in the Vagrantfile, solved it for me.\nIf you already have a working nfs-config, and don't need your Vagrant to overwrite it each time you start, then you can just disable the writing to the export-file.\nThis also solves the collision problem, if you have more then one Vagrant trying to access the same folder, as for example have 2 almost identical Vagrants, one running php 5.6 and one running php 7.2.\n\nA: TL&DR:  Add the following override.vm.synced_folder \".\", \"/vagrant\", disabled: true\nRational:  By default the Vagrant tries to detect any NFS / SMB folders.  While I can understand why the developers added this feature, for my use-case this is very annoying.  The solution is to simply DISABLE NFS folder syncing. \nThis can be done by overriding the VM synced folder option.  I have attached the following config for digital ocean for your consideration, so you can see the entire configuration.\n config.vm.define \"droplet1\" do |config|\n config.vm.provider :digital_ocean do |provider, override|\n    override.vm.synced_folder \".\", \"/vagrant\", disabled: true\n        override.ssh.private_key_path = '~/.ssh/id_rsa'\n        override.vm.box = 'digital_ocean'=\n        override.vm.box_url = \"https://github.com/devopsgroup-io/vagrant- \n digitalocean/raw/master/box/digital_ocean.box\"\n    override.nfs.functional = false\n            provider.image = 'ubuntu-14-04-x64'\n            provider.region = 'nyc1'\n            provider.size = '512mb'\n       end\n      end\n    end\n\n", "Q: Best software for Android Device On Ubuntu?

This laptop is connected to my AirPort Extreme. The latter is (by wire) connected to my providers router (it's called bbox and this box has the incoming landline).\nI've connected my NAS to the Ubuntu laptop by so it serves as file server within my local network. By so, I can connect to my Ubuntu laptop from my iPhone and my MacBook Pro.\nThe AirPort Extreme gives static IP's to my Ubuntu laptop (10.0.1.99), my iPhone (10.0.1.88) and my Mac (10.0.1.77).

At the same time if I'm in a terminal the previous command is selected.\nI have observed that the problem seems to occur if my wrists are resting on the laptop below the keyboard, to either side of the touchpad, but not if they're held above it. It has also seemed linked to using the nub mouse or the nub mouse scroll button (located between the left and right clickers directly below the space bar). Disabling the track pad has not helped the issue, though I have not tested disabling the nub mouse or associated buttons.\nI installed a keylogger to help monitor and then used the system for a while, sure enough it happened a few times and I isolated the following series of keypresses that occur of their own accord:\n<Up><E-71><LAlt><#+1>j<#+61>\n\nThe <# items seem to be a count, which is strange as the Lalt key would not normally record a count and I've not been able to press any combination which causes this in normal use. The number after the j seems arbitrary, from 1 up to hundreds. The E-71 key is the laptop's volume mute, on the F1 key (the F keys have a separate Fn trigger button).\nAt times the volume has switched on and off, I suspect with this process happening multiple times. I recreated it a single time by pressing hard on the laptop case to the left of the trackpad, but have not been able to do this again. So there may be a hardware element, though the laptop is otherwise in good working order and physical condition - it has never been dropped or suffered an impact, and this problem has only been occurring for a few weeks, without anything that comes to mind as a trigger for when it started.\nIt may be just a hardware problem, but if there are ways of working round it (the small stall is likely due to the weird key combination confusing the OS) I'd be interested, and more so if anyone else has experienced similar.\n\nA: I have to say that this is almost surely a hardware issue. If you just search for the term Thinkpad Edge 15 keyboard problem you will be presented with a lot of hits with similar (though not exactly the same) problems.\nYou can read through this lenovo forum about the problem. It has an accepted solution which basically tells to contact service.\nYou can also look at this blog entry to get a clue about what is the problem with the hardware and see a possible solution on how to repair it yourself. (As askubuntu doesn't deal with hardware issues I shouldn't provide the repair method here, since it is off-topic.)\nI think that this kind of hardware issue cannot be dealt in software. Even if you filter out somehow that specific key-combo-chain which you have logged, it is likely that as time goes you will experience other problems with the keyboard. \n\nA: I've found the best solution so far. We can assume it's likely a hardware problem, as the key combination should not be possible (multiple Alt presses are not recognised normally, and disabling repeat key presses does not work).\nHowever in my case the laptop is not under warranty and at present is essential to work - I can't do without it to get the keyboard looked at.\nFortunately I found a forum describing how to disable a key and remap it. The process is quite simple:\nxmodmap -pke | grep \"= *Alt\"\n\nWill give me the current mapping of the Alt key:\nkeycode  64 = Alt_L Meta_L Alt_L Meta_L\n\nOpening a file in ~ called .Xmodmap and entering:\n! Disable Alt key\nkeycode  64 = NoSymbol NoSymbol NoSymbol NoSymbol\n! Enable Alt key\n!keycode  64 = Alt_L Meta_L Alt_L Meta_L\n\nLoading this into an existing X session is as simple as entering xmodmap .Xmodmap in terminal.\nAccording to the forum post, not yet tested, logging out and back in will give me the option of permanently loading this default. It is also quite easy to see from this, or the xmodmap -pke command, how to remap another key to function as Alt, presumably one which is not accidentally triggered as my Alt key is.\nI will report as to whether this actually fixes the issue, but could be useful for anyone experiencing hardware keyboard problems.\n", "Q: What does it mean to run gedit in standalone mode? I was reading man gedit, when I stumbled upon this:\n-s, --standalone\n              Run gedit in standalone mode.\n\nThe official gedit documentation on this subject did not make me much wiser. So...\n\n\n*\n\n*What does standalone mode really mean?\n\n*When would I need this?\n\n\nA: Looking it at the source, -s makes gedit always start a new process and a new window, rather than adding a tab to an existing gedit window that's already running. Useful if you're worried about one window crashing taking down the other. You can do the same thing with gnome-terminal with the \"--disable-factory\" switch, which is useful, as g-t has been known to crash, and take down the processes running in all your tabs and windows with it!\nEdit: And the docs you linked above point out that it's also useful if you're invoking gedit from a batch file, or from a mail program, etc. - \"gedit -s\" will create a new process that won't exit until the window is closed, whereas plain \"gedit\" will return immediately if there's already a gedit process running. \n", "Q: How do I run a gui app from the command line?

Thanks!\n\nA: Inside the script, before the application is launched, add this line:\nexport DISPLAY=:0.0\n\nThis tells the program that it has to run in the DISPLAY with ID :0.0 instead of the terminal where is being called,which (as far as I know) reffers to the TTY7.\nIn other words, sends it to the graphic environment. You can also use it locally, launching a program in the desktop from a virtual tty. I use it for instance when compiz crashes and there are no menus or icons to restart it:\nexport DISPLAY=:0.0 && compiz --replace\n\n", "Q: How to list active displays (on command line)? xrandr -q gives me a list of connected displays, but how can I find out (script friendly) if a display is currently active? \nContext: \nI would like to write a script to toggle a Display.

One connects to the router, the other one to a switch where all clients get connected to.\nThe interface to the router may be set to obtain the ip automatically.\nThe other interface you can set as 192.168.66.1 subnet 255.255.255.0 for example. The clients must have ips like 192.168.66.2-254, subnet 255.255.255.0 with no default gateway.\nOr you set up an dhcp on the second interface.\nThen you set up a proxy on this box (apt-get install squid), listening on port 3389 for example (default). All cliens must be configured to use this proxy now.  \nAn easier solution would be to run ipcop which includes a proxy that can be setup as a \"transparent proxy\" easily.\n", "Q: ffmpeg-video trim from the end of the video I have some videos of different duration.I want to cut(remove) the last 5 seconds of all videos.Can i use 'ffmpeg' in a loop to trim the videos?please help me.\n\nA: This will get you the duration of your file in seconds:\nlet A=$(avprobe input.webm 2>&1 | grep \"^ *Duration: \" | sed \"s/^ *Duration: \\\\([0-9:]*\\\\).*/(((\\\\1)/\" | sed \"s/0\\\\([0-9]\\\\)/\\\\1/g\" | sed \"s/:/)*60+/g\")\n\nAlthough avprobe does return the fractions of the seconds, bash doesn't deal with fractions.

I am not sure what I messed up, but I do not know the IP address of the NAS anymore. \nHow can I find the IP address of the NAS?\n\nA: You could scan your network to see where it is up, e.g.\nnmap -sP 192.168.1.0/24\n\nwhere obviously you should change the network to your own. Then you'll get a list of devices which are up and running on current LAN.\nTo find your LAN IP you can use ip addr. If you are on WiFi the IP address will be near right to inet on something like wlp2s0 network interface.\n\nA: If you want a sophisticated or permanent solution, Bonjour protocol may fit, you can see its implementation in Linux Avahi. So you can point to your NAS as hostname.local or use Avahi Discover to get IP's and all services published in the network.

The format for the answer lines themselves are also simple: < packagename> < question_name> < datatype> < value>. \nSo, if you wanted to install the mysql-server using a predetermined password, then you'd create a file such as this one (mysql-prefs.seed)\nmysql-server-5.5    mysql-server/root_password          password    my_root_password\nmysql-server-5.5    mysql-server/root_password_again    password    my_root_password\n\nThen you insert these answers into the debconf database by running debconf-set-selections mysql-prefs.seed. Finally, you just install the package as normal: sudo apt-get install mysql-server -yq and the MySQL root user's password will now be \"my_root_password\". \nI don't know if this is the best way to do it, but it certainly works and it's easy enough.\n", "Q: Optimizing Wi-Fi Connectivity Hello and big thanks to everyone in the askubuntu community who has been more than helpful in the learning process of Linux. \nI'm Running ubuntu 12.04.3 on a hp g7 (dual booted with windows 7 utilizing a larger partition of my hard drive for now)\nWhile I'm using the wifi network at the library using windows 7, I can connect with no problems.

All modern Linux distributions are based on GNU project toolset. In Stallman's opinion, they should be called as GNU/Linux, instead of just Linux. For example official Debian FAQ does this.\nWith Ubuntu, you already have GNU operating system. As of Unix shell, Linux is (almost completely) POSIX compatible, and similar to Unix shell.

I have tried out downloading torrents on Windows. However, now I want to know how to do so on Ubuntu.I need an explanation and some instructions  for it. I would also like to know the risks in it. Can somebody experienced in this please help? \n\nA: Ubuntu comes with a built in BitTorrent client; I am unsure how to use it but imagine torrent links will open automatically. The Ubuntu website has more information on it.\nYou're asking about the risks - torrents themselves are as safe as any other download, that is it depends on the source and what you're looking at downloading. If you're downloading from a legitimate source you shouldn't have any problems. See if the provider offers a hash of the file to verify it before running any executable content. If there are viruses they're likely to target Windows, but don't rest on that fact.\nIf you happen to be downloading content from an illegitimate source (i.e. usually if it's violating copyright) you have more risks, both an increased chance of downloading malicious data, and of legal ramifications. Generally if you have to ask about the safety and feel that your source is not legitimate or is known to be breaking the law you're best steering clear.\n\nA: First of all, Ubuntu has an in-built torrent client named Transmission, an easy BitTorrent client from the project Transmission. All you have to do is just download the file & open it with the client. This may not be like how a torrent client looks on windows but does exactly the same functionality where a P2P client intend to do.\n\nAs in M1ke's answer, Ubuntu itself has a separate wiki explaining about BitTorrent. Torrent in general is a P2P (peer-to-peer) service. Therefore, you may have pros and cons while downloading. I may not say its purely secure but it all depends with the users use; while checking for a legitimate source & reviewing a torrent file before preparing a download. You may also consider below points in general to make sure that its a good torrent which you're planning to download;\n\n\n*\n\n*Firstly, you need a torrent website which offers torrent, locate it & select the torrent which you prefer downloading.\n\n*Review any information given to you, such as the date uploaded, the file size.. etc (This may help you to determine a good torrent file)\n\n*Review any ratings or comments available to you (It is always recommended to refer latest comments by reviewing)\n\n*Check for other sites linking to the torrent. (The more sites, the more chance the torrent is real).\n\n*Compare File Sizes (Is the file only 5 MB, when all the others are 5\nGB? Does the file size seem too small? If so, it might be fake).\n\n\nHope this helps & clears your question\nSource helped to grab some points: How to Determine if a Torrent Is Real or Fake\n\nA: You can use the built-in program; When you download a Torrent it automatically opens with this one or download the other programs like: Vuze, which I have been using myself for some years!\nI don't get the part of your question about the risk but in Torrent everything depends on you! You can download something which is Legal or is Illegal; You can download a Virus or a Song or a Movie... If I get wrong please explain more your question.\n\nA: if you used to uTorrent only what I can recommend to you to use qBittorent it's identical copy of uT almost 90% alike or some and also Ktorrent KDE looks good, fast and stable.

But not the one after the first screen that shows \"Try Lubuntu without installing\"/\"Install Lubuntu\" and before the Ubiquity Installer.\nI have searched through forums for the last 3 weeks and have not been able to find a solution for this. Thank you in advance for any help in this.\nVideo of splash screen\n\nA: I realize this is an old question, but I was recently searching for this when trying to customize a 15.10 ISO.  I found no other answers to this, anywhere.  About 15 minutes ago (plus however long the re-mastering took so I could test this) I stumbled over the answer, so I'm going to provide it here in hopes that the reason for your trouble with 13.10 is the same reason for my troubles with 15.10.\nPreviously, I customized the boot splash for 14.10 by just editing the splash.pcx file.  That's not enough for 15.10.  You actually have to put a bunch of the files in the isolinux directory into a cpio archive named bootlogo.  Then, put that bootlogo file into the isolinux directory.\nFor example, if you happen to have /tmp/isolinux and it has the files from /media/user/cdrom/isolinux, and your modified pcx files, you could do the following:\ncd /tmp/isolinux\ncat bootlogo | cpio -t > /tmp/list\ncpio -o < /tmp/list > bootlogo\n\nThen you can go ahead and put the contents of /tmp/isolinux (or just the new bootlogo) wherever you need it.\nA final note, if you want to modify the splash.pcx file, be sure to put it back into a 300x300 dpi format.  For example, using imagemagick: mogrify -units PixelsPerInch -depth 300 splash.pcx \nEdit:  This appears to be the case for Ubuntu 16 as well.  That is, applying this method you can customize the Ubuntu 16 Live CD logo.\n\nA: For the splash screen,  you could try changing the isolinux/splash.png file in the .iso to the one you want - splash.png looks like:\n  \nYou may also need to change the isolinux/splash.pcx file as well.\n", "Q: Which Linux on my netbook?

Ubuntu 12.04 My PC does have built-in graphic. I have vga switch and using it I would like to setup dual monitor.  After pluging both monitors with VGA switch I had a duplicated view on both desktops. I would like to have extended view (mouse coursor goes between two desktops). Displays Settings does not show second monitor. How to setup it? How to make them two working in extended mode.\nBefore VGA switch I tried with DPI-DVI adapter, I was lucky to have extended mode on dual monitor but mouse cursor cannot go to second monitor - it was stick to the edge.\nI've searched for solution to this problem many times. I've tried with xrandr, CCSM and many others, but nothing worked.\nlspci | grep -E \"VGA\"\nVGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 2nd Generation Core Processor Family Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 09)\n\nA: If you mean you're splitting the output of one VGA connector on your PC, you can't - this (fairly obviously) just duplicates the signal to different monitors.\nIf you have a VGA connector and an HDMI or DVI connector, then you may be able to use dual monitors, depending on the graphics chipset. I don't recall ever seeing a motherboard with onboard graphics that had two video outputs, though.\n\nA: In theory it is possible, but you'll need additional hardware anyway and your graphics adapter should be able to handle the extra resolution. You'll need a splitter that is plugged to your video output and have two outputs for two monitors. Most of these, the cheap ones, will just split the same output between two displays BUT there are others more expensive that will send half of the horizontal resolution to each monitor. This one for example:\nhttp://www.matrox.com/graphics/en/products/gxm/dh2go/ \nWhat they do, I think, is that the device pretends to be an ultra-wide monitor display itself with a resolution of say 3840x1080 pixels, so the computer thinks there is just one display of such resolution plugged in, but the device then sends the first 1920x1080 pixels to one of the displays, and the rest to the other.\nIf you are using a normal desktop computer, it may be better to purchase a second graphics adapter which have some extra advantages because this way you have more control about what you want to see in each display. But if you are using a laptop, a barebone, a Mac Mini, or some other computer in which you cannot plug an extra video card and you really need a second display, it is a reliable option.\nAlternatively, depending on your needs an ultra-wide monitor with a native resolution of 3840x1080 or so could be a better solution. They're usually expensiver than two monitors that put the same resolution together, though.\nFinally, you could also purchase an USB driven vga adapter, it is actually a graphic card but you can plug in into an USB port instead of having to mount it inside the computer.\n", "Q: How can I access my home folder in a live usb directly? I have just finished installing Ubuntu 12.04 from an 'updated' live usb. By updated I mean I had installed other softwares, removed others, run updates and upgrades, etc.  \nTo my surprise, the newly installed system didn't come with the updates. For example, I purged libre office and installed abiword in the live session and on installing I found Libre Office. Can someone please explain to me how that worked out.\nMy home folder question (according to the title) is I wanted to copy my entire live usb home folder to the installed home folder including all the .folders and configurations. I just plugged in the usb directly into the newly installed 12.04 and expecting to see all the usual 'bin, boot, etc, var, lib, sys' folders, I found 'boot, capser, dists, install, pool' folders. I tried searching for my 'live session' home folder with no success. How can I access those files without booting again into the live session mode?\n\nA: When you're running from a live CD / USB, if you enabled persistent mode when creating the drive, the modifications you make are stored in an \"overlay\" filesystem, which in turn is usually stored in a file called casper-rw on the memory stick.\nYou can easily access it by \"loop mounting\" the file, which means to treat an ordinary file like a block device and access the filesystem stored in it. If your USB stick gets mounted as, e.g. /media/USB, then the following should work:\nsudo mount /media/USB/casper-rw /mnt -o loop\n\nThen the contents of the overlay, including /home/xxx, should appear under /mnt. Note that you might have permission / ownership problems, if so try accessing /mnt as root (from the command line, after sudo -s).\n\nA: So you booted from live usb, installed ubuntu on your harddrive. After this, you did not reboot, but install apps and create documents within this live system?  \nI must tell you, both the application changes and files created have never been somewhere else then your RAM.\nSo if you did a reboot (what you actually did according to your explanation), the data is gone forever.\n", "Q: how to install firefox 26 on ubuntu without internet connection Current version of Ubuntu that I have is 12.04 which do not have internet connection, what is the instruction or command to update the Firefox version from 21 to 26 ?\n\nA: Version 26.0 is available for download from the Firefox website  - go to someone who has internet, download there then copy to a USB flash drive or CD-R.

You could upgrade to 13.10 now or if you prefer, install a more recent kernel using the LTS Enablement Stack. This installs a more recent kernel (and thus more hardware support) as well as a more recent Xorg graphical stack. The latter is not really of interest, but it does provide a fairly easy way to get more hardware support without upgrading to a more recent Ubuntu release.\nSee also:\n\n\n*\n\n*What is hardware enablement (HWE)?\n\n*LTS Enablement Stacks - Should I use quantal, raring or saucy?\n\nA: See the linked \"Qualcomm Atheros AR8172 Driver fix?

I have a question , can i ping an ip and return hostname without dns using or ip mapping ?\nMaybe from the ARP cache .\n\nA: No,  well certainly not with ping, because ping isn't a name resolving service. Anyway, if you ping a host-name, DNS is used first to translate into an IP.\nYou could connect to a service running on a port (a website on 80 for example) that replies with a packet that includes host-name.  Some protocols can also disclose the host-name during the connection conversation (SMTP for example) .\nSo, if you're on the same network segment (depending on routers and switches between) you can get host information through arp requests, or on some protocols (netbios)\n", "Q: Service --status-all --> what does the column with [ ? ],[ + ], and [ - ] mean?

What does this column represent? What does ?, +, and - mean? \nSorry if this is a simple question. I searched online for ~30 minutes before just coming here and asking.\nI even found this: What do the symbols in service --status-all mean? where the \"correct\" answer states \"It draws a [ + ] or [ - ] depending on whether the exit status was zero or nonzero, respectively.\".\nSo, I guess my new question is what does status zero and nonzero(!?!?!) mean?\n\nA: Well those are just exit codes. After something has done running, it can return an 8-bit integer (0-255) to indicate how it exited.\n\n\n*\n\n*Zero (which is implied if nothing is returned) means the application got to the end of what it was supposed to do and exited naturally.\n\n*Non-zero codes (1-255) can mean whatever the application wants. The man page (man <command>) will usually show you what these codes mean.\n\n\nIn terms of the question, don't overthink it:\n\n\n*\n\n*+ means it's running, \n\n*- means it isn't (it might have crashed - it might never have started), and\n\n*? means the services doesn't have a status command, so there's no way the service command can work out what's what.\n\n", "Q: How to know a mac address for a Node knowing its IP on local network?

Then I upgraded to 13.10. Everything works great and I really enjoy Ubuntu except for one issue. Whenever I close the lid of my laptop, or manually enter suspend or hibernate my computer is unable to boot back up. Hibernate usually just boots to a black screen and Suspend sometimes lets me see the login screen but I can't click on anything or type.

I can't remember my Dell Inspiron admin password for entering Bios to set it up, so to boot Ubuntu from start up and I don't feel like tearing my laptop apart to take out the Bios battery just to reset it, so I was hoping that I could just download Ubuntu 12.04 directly to run along with my Windows 7. \nIs it possible or not?\n\nA: Yes, it's absolutely possible.\nThis is how you do it (for safety do a backup before following the instructions, in case something go wrong);\nFirst make sure you boot Windows, then download your iso if you haven't already. Afterwards download https://sourceforge.net/projects/partedmagic/files/partedmagic/Parted%20Magic%205.5/pmagic-5.5.iso.zip/download\nand lastly http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/\nNow, run the Unetbootin installer. Choose your Parted Magic iso and choose frugal install. \nInstall it to your windows partition (normally C:) when it tells you it's done you can reboot. \nWhen you reboot into your unetbootin installation you should be able to choose to load Parted Magic entirely into RAM. This means that, once running, it will not actually be using the hard disk at all - leaving you free to resize the partitions. \nOnce Parted Magic has booted, select the gparted application. It's fairly easy to use. simply select your Windows partition, click edit, and shrink it by about 8Gb. \nMake sure you leave the empty space to the right of the partition. Then click apply. \nUnetbootin may prompt you to remove the installation. If not running the unetbootin installer again should remove it. (If neither happens then control panel and add/ remove programs on XP or Programs and features on vista/7 and remove it there). \nRun the Unetbootin installer again and this time, select your Ubuntu iso to use for the frugal install. Reboot into this new installation. Once in Ubuntu, run gparted. \nIn the spare space create a new partition, and format it as ext4 (often you'll be told to create a swap partition; you can if you want; I don't normally; google will tell you more). Click the install icon on the desktop. When it gets to partitioning, click specify manually. Choose your new partition and pick use as: ext4, mount point: / Let the installer do its job. now you have a choice. Left like this the system will allow you to dual-boot (i.e. choose between Ubuntu and Windows when you switch on the pc).\nReinstall Parted Magic as we did in step 1. Reboot to parted magic (loading it to RAM again). Open up gparted, move the Ubuntu partition to the left, then grow it to the right. Do not try to grow it to the left. (This is the time to create your swap partition if you want one). Now reboot. You have now installed Ubuntu alongside Windows without even touching a disc or usb! :)\nThe source: http://community.linuxmint.com/tutorial/view/171\n", "Q: Correct DNS records?

After selecting desired resolution and applying I get an error message stating the requested size exceeds 3d hardware limit and I need to either change it or switch to 2D. No problem, I understand that completely. I looked through other posted questions to find how to switch to 2D. One answer stated to click the Ubuntu icon next to the username on the login screen and select it from there. The problem is, there is no Ubuntu icon on the login screen; just the couple of basic options in the top-right corner. But none of those are applicable. So how do I change the resolution limit or switch to 2D?\n\nA: Unity 2d is not included on newer versions of Ubuntu (anything after 12.04 I think).  You can install it if you wish too though.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:unity-team/staging\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install unity-2d\n\nThis adds the PPA and installs unity 2d.  After a restart or logout you can switch your user interface.  The box with your password field will have a little unity symbol on the top right which will change it.\n", "Q: Can I view Firefox history with the terminal? Is there a command to show Firefox history from the Terminal ? \nwithout the need to Enter Firefox history graphically .\n\nA: This page describes what user-specific information is stored by Firefox and where. (And this is what Mozilla's help has to say on viewing .sqlite files.)\nIt lists three types of history:\n\n\n*\n\n*Bookmarks and Browsing History: The places.sqlite file contains all your Firefox bookmarks and the list of all the websites you’ve visited ...\n\n*Autocomplete history: The formhistory.sqlite file remembers what you have searched for in the Firefox search bar and what information you’ve entered into forms on websites ...\n\n*Download history: The downloads.sqlite file remembers what you have downloaded. ...\nAs you can see, all three histories are not simple text files but database files in sqlite format.\nOne way to view .sqlite files is by using sqlite3 (sudo apt-get install sqlite3).  \nOpen a terminal and cd to the folder containing what you want to view. In my case, that is ~/.mozilla/firefox/w4wcp85s.default.\nls *.sqlite lists the sqlite files.\nRun sqlite3 places.sqlite (if places.sqlite is what you want to view). You'll see something like this:\n$ cd ~/.mozilla/firefox/w4wcp85s.default \n$ sqlite3 places.sqlite\nSQLite version 3.7.17 2013-05-20 00:56:22\nEnter \".help\" for instructions\nEnter SQL statements terminated with a \";\"\nsqlite> \n\nNow, there are several things you can do. (Use Ctrl+D to exit sqlite3).\nFor example, typing .tables and pressing Enter gives me:\nsqlite> .tables\nmoz_anno_attributes  moz_favicons         moz_items_annos    \nmoz_annos            moz_historyvisits    moz_keywords       \nmoz_bookmarks        moz_hosts            moz_places         \nmoz_bookmarks_roots  moz_inputhistory   \nsqlite> \n\nTo view the contents, type SELECT * FROM table_name; (where table_nameis the name of the table you wish to view; note the ;) and press Enter. It's quite likely that the output won't be understandable but that is not the fault of sqlite3.\nTo show you an example that does provide decent output, look at stylish.sqlite (if you use the Stylish extension):\n$ ~/.mozilla/firefox/w4wcp85s.default $ sqlite3 stylish.sqlite\nSQLite version 3.7.17 2013-05-20 00:56:22\nEnter \".help\" for instructions\nEnter SQL statements terminated with a \";\"\nsqlite> .tables\nstyle_meta  styles    \nsqlite> SELECT * FROM styles;\n6||||YouTube|/* AGENT_SHEET */ \n/* ▓▓ NIGHTSHIFT - eye care:                                 ▓▓\n   ▓▓_http://userstyles.org/styles/18192/nightshift-eye-care_▓▓ */\n\n@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\n@-moz-document regexp(\"https?://www.youtube.com/.*\")  {\nbody,html {min-height: 100%!important; }\nhtml, body{background-color:#111!important}\n\nYou can do everything in just one non-interactive command if you know exactly what you want.

(Find one on distrowatch)\nIf you want to sort or count it, you can change the SQL Query... or you can just add the following at the end of the above commandline:\nCount: |wc -l \nOrder by date: |sort -n\nOrder by most visited: |cut -d\\| -f2|sort|uniq -c|sort -n\nFind any text or substring: |grep \"youtube\"(more accurately \"http://youtube.com/\" or it will match any url containing \"youtube\")\nExclude text: |grep -v \"http://youtube\" \nCount Youtube visits: |grep \"http://youtube.com/\"|wc -l\nYou can string these together. | is called a pipe.

I've had issues in the past, so I'm nervous about the \"quality\" of my installation - I let the auto installer do it for me this time. My gparted looks like this:\n\nIs this correct/optimal? I had the \"unknown partition, grub rescue\" prompt after my installation, so I created the bios_grub partition as seen below and things seem to be working for now. But if history repeats itself, I'll be troubleshooting in a few months.\n\nA: Yeah that won't get rid of some partitions as we see here. If the system is working fine I wouldn't worry too much. The only way to be 100% safe would be for you to boot from the ubuntu installer again, do a deep format of the hard drive, and then reinstall ubuntu on it with the normal installer. Then you'll be sure that only ubuntu is left and everything in there is as it's supposed to be.

Everything works fine on the local network and users can freely exchange mail between one another's local accounts. However, I can't send email to the outside, nor receive from the outside. When I send email to the remote server, my log says, \"no route to host\". When I send email from the remote server, I get a bounce message that says, \"No MX or A records found\". I've been assured this is a DNS problem and not a Postfix problem, so I'll rephrase this question in terms of DNS. Here's the confusion:\nI've created a zone file for my domain that is recognized only by my localhost DNS server. When I query the DNS server of my isp, I get a NXdomain error. Granted that only my loopback DNS can recognize the zone file, how does this file get known to the public network? How is this related to the domain I've registered with a public registrar? And how is my remote email account ever going to figure out that I do have MX and A records for that domain, though only on my local DNS?  \nbtw my network is behind a NAT and I've forwarded 53 through both firewalls, and it's currently open. \nHere are the current zone files: \ndb.admitonetwowire.com\n\n$TTL 1d\n@     IN    SOA  ns1.admitonetwowire.com. root.admitonetwowire.com.

You should have had to designate name servers for your domain with your domain registrar. (Some registrars also offer DNS services and provide tools for setting up basic DNS records - but I'll assume that isn't the case here.) The name server doesn't have to be the SOA (Start of Authority) for your domain; it just has to know where the SOA record is located. ISP's generally won't provide DNS service for accounts unless you are on a business account with static IPs, and even then they usually only have a PTR record provisioned for the IP/hostname of your server (leaving you to manage your DNS records internally). Thus, querying your ISP DNS for info on your domain will yield nothing.\nIf you are on a residential account with cable or DSL, you will need to look at using a dynamic DNS service like dyn.com to manage your DNS. Cable/DSL uses dynamic addressing on their networks and your public IP is subject to change over time. The service is relatively inexpensive, becomes the SOA of your domain DNS records, lets you create all the DNS records you would need (including MX records) and will direct requests for your domain to your server. You would then designate the dynamic DNS service name servers with your domain registrar.\nOnce that is addressed, you will probably face the problem that most ISP's block port 25 which is used for SMTP connections and on which Postfix relies for incoming and outgoing connections. In some cases you can get the ISP to drop the block on your account - but not always.\nOnce you have DNS pointed to your server and it's accessible to the outside world, then you can start working on the Postfix problem.\n\nA: If I look up NS servers for your domain, I have this:\nadmitonetwowire.com.    3434    IN  NS  ns1.admitonetwowire.com.\nadmitonetwowire.com.    3434    IN  NS  ns09.domaincontrol.com.\nadmitonetwowire.com.    3434    IN  NS  ns10.domaincontrol.com.\n\nLike, yours is the first one, other two are GoDaddy's. I believe you have configured GoDaddy's to be secondary?\nIf above is true, then the problem is that your server does not listen on UDP 53 port, but it should. I can not get any records from your server, that means GoDaddy also can't.\nYou can check /etc/bind/named.conf.options there should be:\nlisten-on {\n  65.13.145.203;\n};\n\nYou can check listening ports by running:\nnetstat -tupanl | grep \":53 \"\n\nAlso check if firewall isn't blocking UDP 53. NOTE: TCP 53 should be blocked, allow only UDP connections.\n", "Q: \"Failed to open \\EFI\\Microsoft\\Boot\\grub64.efi\", etc A while ago, my primary HDD failed, taking my EFI partition with it. However, my Ubuntu system files are kept on my secondary SSD. When I got a new HDD, I created an EFI partition using GParted on a live CD, and then ran Boot Repair. Now, whenever I boot, I get this error, which displays for about a half second before the Ubuntu splash screen appears:\n\nFailed to open \\EFI\\Microsoft\\Boot\\grub64.efi - 8000000000000000E\nFailed to load image\nFailed to open \\EFI\\Microsoft\\Boot\\grub64.efi - 8000000000000000E\nFailed to load image\nCould not open \"\\EFI\\BOOT\\fallback.efi\": 14\nFailed to open \\EFI\\BOOT\\grub64.efi - 8000000000000000E\nFailed to load image\nFailed to open \\EFI\\BOOT\\MokManager.efi - 8000000000000000E\nFailed to load image\n\nThe system continues to boot normally after it appears. I checked, and the listed files are indeed missing from /boot/efi. I've already tried running Boot Repair again, as well as update-grub. What can I do to resolve this error?\n\nA: If the computer is booting, the safest approach is to ignore the messages, since they're nothing but an eyesore -- and one that lasts for less than a second, according to your report. Any attempt to fix the problem runs the risk of creating bigger problems.\nIf you want to proceed, I recommend you examine two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*The output of the command sudo efibootmgr -v. This may show stray entries in the firmware for the missing files. If so, removing those entries (with efibootmgr -- type man efibootmgr to learn about its use) may remove the error messages.\n\n*The contents of the /boot/grub/grub.cfg file. This is the GRUB configuration file, and it may have references to those files. Unfortunately, editing grub.cfg is tricky; you don't normally edit it directly, but instead rely on scripts to construct it. Thus, unless you're an expert, I reiterate my initial advice to ignore the problem; or if you're really offended by those messages, it may be easier to switch to my rEFInd boot manager than to try to fix GRUB.\n\n", "Q: How to boot from my Windows installation disk?

This happens sometimes when the motherboard bios is upgraded, the memory capacity is increased without being documented. Assuming one of your chips is 1gb you will likely be able to change it to a 2gb, but no guarantees. It happened to me with a thinkpad.

I have installed a Ubuntu GNOME and found that I am getting lots of PROGRAM is not responding messages.\nI have either to \"Force Quit\" the program or \"Wait\" for it a little more.\nI've noticed that each time I wait for the program, the program eventually continues without issues.\nSo, I think there might be a \"timeout\" configuration for programs to be considered non-responding and I want to increase this timeout.\n\nA: It could not be configured, because the timeout value is defined as constant value in the mutter source.\ngnome-shell refers mutter library.\nI found the timeout value at the mutter source, mutter-3.10.4/src/core/display.c.\n...\n#define PING_TIMEOUT_DELAY 5000\n\nAnd it's used by a below function named as meta_display_ping_window\nping_data->ping_timeout_id = g_timeout_add (PING_TIMEOUT_DELAY, meta_display_ping_timeout, ping_data);\n\nIt's referred from the function when the window is activated:\nwindow_activate(mutter-3.10.4/src/core/window.c) -> meta_window_check_alive(mutter-3.10.4/src/core/delete.c) -> meta_display_ping_window(mutter-3.10.4/src/core/display.c)\n\nAs you can see at above, the timeout is 5 seconds.\nYou can modify the value just for you because mutter is open source project.\nAnd the timeout value is referred another case when the window is closed.\nWindow delete flow is as\nmeta_window_delete(mutter-3.10.4/src/core/delete.c) -> meta_window_check_alive(mutter-3.10.4/src/core/delete.c) -> meta_display_ping_window(mutter-3.10.4/src/core/display.c)\n\nHowever, I think that you need to modify the source for your delayed window. Or I think that you can discuss about it with the mutter developers/maintainers.\nYou can prepare the build environment and get the source with following commands.\n$ sudo apt-get build-dep mutter\n$ sudo apt-get source mutter\n\nTo build it, Refer \nhttps://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/apt-howto/ch-sourcehandling.en.html\nhttps://wiki.debian.org/BuildingTutorial\n\nA: This bug was fixed.

If there is a simple way to make totem work that would probably be even better.\nI get voicemails as .wav files and am looking for an easy solution for playing them. \n\nA: Simply installing any other Audio player should work fine for you.

I am using Ubuntu 13.10 on the new Intel NUC i3 with the Intel Centrino Advanced-N 6235  wireless adapter.  It's a fresh install and I only added XBMC for Linux to it.  My problem is that the wifi connection keeps dropping every 10mins or so, and when it does, my wifi network disappears from the avaiable wifi networks list and there is no way to connect back to it.  The only way to make the network available again, is to completely  delete the network and then add it again from scratch, entering the password and everything.  The other way is to reboot.  Other than that the network  is just not detected  at all by the system.    Once I am reconnected,  it will work for another 10mins before it drops again, and so on. \nThis is my home wifi network, and I have several other devices connected to the wifi without any issues.\nI read some other posts where they said to do  sudo apt-get update..and also  disabling ipV6 and setting MTU to 1500, I tried that but it didn't fix the issue.\nI would really appreciate if I can get some trouble shooting assistance with this issue.

What program is best to use for burning ubuntu 12.04.3 lts desktop and what write speed is the best to burn it\ni use the program imageburn is good?\n\nA: The speed at which you burn the disc should depend on the quality of your burner (hardware) and the disc itself. If your hardware and discs are relatively new, feel free to use the highest speed that both are rated for. For example, if your hardware is capable of burning at 52x for CD-Rs and 32x for CD-RWs, and you have a CD-R rated for 40x, take the lowest of the 2 (52x and 40x) and burn at that speed (40x). If you have reason to be concerned about the quality of the CD, you can always burn at a lower speed to be safer. And if you run into any problems while using the burned CD, you can try burning it again at a lower speed. To my knowledge, there can be no disadvantage to burning a disc at a lower speed (except that it will take more time); nonetheless, with modern hardware, media, and software, there is practically no reason to ever burn CDs at very low speeds like 1x, 2x, and 4x.\nRegarding the software, if you meant imgburn, that should work just fine.

I have a question about Ubuntu performance within Windows. After acquiring a fairly old laptop to test my websites created on a Mac, and being subjected to endless pause and freezes I decided to load Ubuntu.\nThis is now my first week using it and I am very happy so far.  Following the forum here and using the terminal, I have solved most of the niggles, WIFI connection issues, etc. and feel I can use this as a netbook.\nI want to keep Windows on the laptop, so I installed Ubuntu within Windows using the .exe download. Does this significantly slow Ubuntu down? Should I scratch everything and make a partition? Or for day-to-day mild usage, is it okay as it is?\nThere are no documents, files, photos, music or videos on the machine -- its existence was simply to test websites, and now with Ubuntu to surf the net and check emails.\nLastly, if I choose to keep the current setup, is it possible to have Ubuntu as the default boot up? Right now, if I turn on the machine and walk away it will load in Windows - I have to sit and wait and then select Ubuntu and hit return.\n\nA: Since .exe installation creates a single file to run Ubuntu it can reduce the performance comparing to the direct HDD partition.

You cannot install Windows with a genuine Purchased Product Key though, as these ISO files are 100% legal and will only install as an Evaluation copy for 30 days without a product key.\nTo remove GRUB:\n\n\n*\n\n*Grab a Windows recovery media or installation CD and boot from it.  You should see this on a recovery media CD.  \n\nAnd you should see this on an installation media CD.  Click \"Repair your computer\" and you should see a screen like the first image.\n\n\n*Open the Command Prompt, then type bootrec /fixmbr into the Command Prompt.\n\n\n*Reboot and boot into Windows.  Then follow the steps below to remove the Ubuntu partitions.\n(Images from HowtoGeek)\n\nIf you don't have a Windows recovery CD or you are too lazy to download and burn the ISO files mentioned before, you can use Boot-repair.  It is a tool that fixes most boot problems(Windows or Ubuntu).  I suggest using a Windows CD if possible.\nTo use boot repair:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from a Ubuntu live CD or USB\n\n*Type these lines in the terminal one line at a time.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install boot-repair\n\n\n*Search for Boot-Repair in the Dash and launch it.\n\nTo fix your computer with Boot-repair, simply click the \"Recommended Repair\" button.  Then follow the steps below to remove the Ubuntu Partitions.\n\nTo delete the Ubuntu Partitions:\n\n\n*Go to Start, right click Computer, then select Manage.  Then select Disk Management from the sidebar.\n\n\n*Right-click your Ubuntu partitions and select \"Delete\". Check before you delete!\n\n*Then, right-click the partition that is on the Left of the free space.  Select \"Extend Volume\".

But it gives me errors that there are \"multiple indistinguishable locations\" on the disk and that there was a \"failure to copy boot files\". No commands are working whatsoever and I cannot find any way to get hold of the missing BCD file. The main issue is that the error says the cause maybe a recent hardware change when I have had none since I bought my machine. So it has to be an internal relocation issue because when I ran chkdsk on the volume that consists of my OS, there were no corrupt files.\nI also tried using the installation media to repair my system but it gives these same options as EFI/Dell/Boot/bootx64.efi, so that is no help either. I also tried re-installing windows 8 through the DVD. When it asks me to select a partition to install it in, I selected the one which had my C drive (442 GB).

I have a PC with dual-boot, and I have installed Xubuntu (always newest version) and Windows 7. I have a new HD and I would like to be able to access it from both OS. I suppose NTFS would work since Ubuntu supports it, but, I would like to know if there is another format that may be better.\n\nA: You can also use Ext2Fsd, which seamlessly enables Ext2/3/4 support in Windows. I used it for a few years and it worked like a charm.\n\nA: My experience says that it depends... Ubuntu (and most Linuxes out there) supports NTFS through ntfs-3g. I've seen that its performance is a bit lower than native ext2/3/4. If you plan to use Linux most of the time (or you will do most data writing in Linux) then I recommend to format your data partition in ext4 and install Ext2Fsd in Windows.\nIf you plan to use Windows most of the time, NTFS is the way to go.\n\nA: Well Ubuntu does supports other formats better than NTFS but windows only reads NTFS and FAT32 ... you don't actually have any other choices other than NTFS. FAT32 is a bad idea. You shouldn't be able to copy files larger than 4GB into the partition. The maximum file size on FAT32 partitions is (2^32)-1 bytes, or one byte less that 4GB.\nSo in short NTFS is an easy way to go :)\n\nA: NTFS  will be your best option for the Dual boot despite other options are better. \nExt2/3/4 is the default filsystem for Ubuntu, and is supported on Windows, but you may need a 3rd party tool to enable as explained previously. \nFYI, do suggest to install Windows 1st, next install your Xubuntu/Linux distro, so this way the Grub Loader can manage the boot options upon powering on your system. \n", "Q: Remove chat program ubuntu 12.04 what is chat program installed by default in ubuntu 12.04 that apears on top of ubuntu.\nAnd how can I remove it ?\nIt's icon is like a white mail beside language selection bar.\n\nA: You are talking about empathy. Thats the chat program included in Ubuntu. \nsudo apt-get remove empathy\n\n\nA: The little envelop in the panel is the indicator-messages applet. You can remove it with\nsudo apt-get remove indicator-messages\n\nBut before you remove it, check if apt reports that some other packages depend on it, maybe you don't want to remove those.\n", "Q: Can I add or change search tags in Unity's Dash I'm using Ubuntu 13.10 and I use two languages English and Russian. \nSo i need to switch all the time to English to find and launch applications, for example Clementine. \nIs it possible that I set somewhere Russian spelling for Clementine and it will work for search in Dash?\n\nA: I don't know if you can change the name of an software(Without any programming).

New Kernels aren't just a set of new numbers. Things get moved around. The way things work changes.\n\nThat said, people have been working on patches. If you do follow that (rather than using a supported kernel) make sure you pick the right version.\n", "Q: Windows and Ubuntu Linking I am a PhD student doing Aeroelastic CFD simulations and I am working with one fluid open source code (Flower) running on Ubuntu and one commercial sturctural csoftware (SIMPACK) running on Windows and I want to pass the output from one code to the other in two diriction. can anybody help me to do this link?\nMohamed \n\nA: I think your question should be more appropriate in StackOverFlow but to answer shortly: \nyou could achieve that using network to communicate the output of a program to another one or you can use a shared folder that you output the result of one program and the other one grab that output, assuming you're running applications in a virtual machine for each one.\nAnother way is to run Flower on Windows also since it says it is compatible to run on Windows according to that site: http://sourceforge.net/projects/openflower/\n\nA: It seems you want to transfer files between your computers. The easiest way to do that is to... use USB stick. Windows and Linux both support either FAT or NTFS as filesystems.\nAlternatively, share folder using Samba (on Ubuntu) or with standard Windows filesharing on your Windows PC (right-click on the folder in Explorer and select \"Share\").\nIt might be a good idea to not to use files directly from the network share (and instead copy those to your local computer), as random access over network is relatively slow compared to local files.\n", "Q: Apt pinning is pinning all sources I've installed a PPA, ondrej/php5, so I can install PHP 5.5 on a Ubuntu 12.04 server.

Also I added three domains and configured almost 100% correct all DNS records.\nMy big question is how I restrict accessing website through server IP. Or how to redirect the IP to a specific location from my server to load specific files?\n\nA: You should use virtualhosts for that. Something along lines\n# Ensure that Apache listens on port 80\nListen 80\n\n# Listen for virtual host requests on all IP addresses\nNameVirtualHost *:80\n\n<VirtualHost *:80>\nDocumentRoot /www/ip_address_root\nServerName 123.123.123.123\n\n# Other directives here\n\n</VirtualHost>\n\n<VirtualHost *:80>\nDocumentRoot /www/example2\nServerName www.example.org\n\n# Other directives here\n\n</VirtualHost>\n\n(Example copied from here)\nAlternatively, mod_rewrite helps with this.

I have tried the solution in\nOpen Source Command Line Tools to Remove Hyperlinks in PDFs?\nbut for some reason it doesn't work.\n\nA: I've found a way of doing it; I don't think it's intended behaviour exactly, but it works by virtue of pdfjam not preserving links in the output (listed as a known issue in its man page, but somewhat helpful for your particular situation).\nIt uses the pdfjam package, so run sudo apt-get install pdfjam first. Then simply navigate to the folder containing the pdf file (take as example foo.pdf), and run pdfjam foo.pdf . It should process it and output as foo-pdfjam.pdf, and any hyperlinks should be gone from the output file.\n\nA: Depending on your pdf reader there might be a \"remove links\" button under document processes or something similar. You'll have to forgive me I have not used your specific reader before.\nHope this helps\n", "Q: is denyhost central database stored locally? I was tasked to write a security policy to apply to any ubuntu server we deploy at a client's site. Knowing how some of the corporate are restrictive on what resource is available to what box on their network especially banks i have been wondering. \nLet me explain,if I understand well, denyhost itself connects to a database( or databases) to either report or fetch all \"bad\" IPs. \nfirst question is whether that database is local or stored somewhere on a host on the internet.  \nsecond question is related to the first one.

I know, normally you use a live system for full portability and that the ubuntu installer configures hardware etc. when installing on a specific setup, but I have never had problems with it. (I even ran it successfully on completely different hardware without problems).\nToday it thought, I want to try it on a colleagues machine, because he thinks it is kind of broken (windows randomly shows blue screen when working with it). It is a new machine however. \nSo I used a usb that has never been attached to any system but mine before, everything ran fine. Then after I booted the usb on the lattop of my colleague and everything ran fine, I booted it again on my computer: result: does not boot anymore. I thought: okay maybe a file system error, ran btrfsck, but it did not show anything of interest.\nI ended up setting up the usb from scratch.\nAfter that I set up another usb with a fresh copy of ubuntu. I successfully installed some software, powered the system off and bootet from the colleagues machine. Everything worked. Then I tried to install some software there, but apt complained, that debconf is missing. apt-get install -f did not work either, so basically the whole package management was broken in a irreparable state.  \nThis cannot be coincidence, can it? \nSo my question is: Could faulty hardware (other than the storage device itself) screw with the root filesystem so that it breaks?\n\nA: Could faulty hardware (other than the storage device itself) screw with the root filesystem so that it breaks? \nYes. \nAs an example: Malfunctioning RAM can result in file corruption. editing your /etc/fstab to mount R/O (read only) should reduce the odds of such an occurrence to near zero.\n"]
