["Q: How do I upgrade Ubuntu on a partition using an iso image? I've searched through some answers here, and while one was marked as a duplicate, it specifically dealt with an apt upgrade, so I don't think it applies to my question.\nCurrently I have 12.10 on my machine sitting next to Windows 7.  Upgrading to 13.04 via the software updater doesn't seem to work--it gets hung up on some packages and then reverts and quits out of the upgrader.  I burned an .iso image and thought to upgrade with that.  When I use it, though, my only options are to wipe the drive entirely or place the upgrade next to the \"other OS's\" the upgrader detects.  I chose the latter, hoping it would replace 12.10 and upgrade to 13.04.  Not so.  Now I have 12.10 and 13.04 on the same machine.  \nHow can I delete these partitions and run a clean install while keeping windows 7 on the drive?  I know I can use Gparted, but don't know if I should use the format option on the ext and linux-swap and format to NTFS or to somehow just delete these entirely (is there a Gparted option for that?)  Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: This is only if you installed Ubuntu after Windows.\nWhen you delete a partition, it becomes an unpartitioned (unformatted) space. If you would want to create a partition from it, you'd right click that unpartitioned space and hit \"Format\". So, in your case, in GParted, you don't have to format them into NTFS, just delete all the ext and swap partitions and, if all of them were arranged one after the other, you'd have one huge \"unpartitioned space\" in the end. When you're installing Ubuntu, you'd tell it to use all empty space (I can't remember the name of the actual option), it'll detect the empty space, format it into ext and swap partitions, and install itself there.\n", "Q: Apt-fast does not show download size I use apt-fast to download and install packages on my system. What I have noticed is apt-fast does not show me how much data will be downloaded, as apt-get does:\nThe following NEW packages will be installed:\ndkms libgsoap2 virtualbox virtualbox-dkms virtualbox-qt\n0 upgraded, 5 newly installed, 0 to remove and 6 not upgraded.\nNeed to get 19.9 MB of archives.\nAfter this operation, 77.9 MB of additional disk space will be used.\n\nHow can I avail this feature when installing from apt-fast?\n\nA: This is by-design. You should open a feature request over Launchpad or upstream in GitHub.\n", "Q: Stuck partition on Mac. After I used rEFIt to put Linux on my mac, it tried installing windows, but I stopped it. The partition doesn't show up in terminal or disk utility. It's like a 'ghost' partition and it shows up when I boot holding ALT. I can't use it because it says no operating system found. How do I delete this?\n\nA: You can erase a  partition using Disk Utility. Boot to Mac OS X, start up Disk Utility, select your harddrive, click Partitioning, click the partition and then click the - . If you want, you can now extend other partitions to use the freed up space by dragging their handles. Then click Apply and you are done.\n", "Q: UnsatisfiedLinkError on xawt when running HEC-HMS.sh I am a recent adopter of Linux and this problem has got me stumped. I use HEC-HMS and HEC-DSSVue for work on a regular basis. I have been using the widows versions in wine but they are really buggy. So I decided to try out the linux versions. the links below will take you to the download pages for these two programs. They are free programs for Hydrology and data management.\nOnce I install them and attempt to run the shell file (HEC-HMS.sh for example) I get a ton of java errors that I do not understand. If I had to guess I would say that the java files in question can not be found. When I check to see if java is installed it is. \nHere is the output from the terminal from trying to run HEC-HMS.sh:\nException in thread \"Thread-1\" java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: /home/smythe/HEC/hec-hms35/java/lib/i386/xawt/libmawt.so: libXtst.so.6: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n    at java.lang.ClassLoader$NativeLibrary.load(Native Method)\n    at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadLibrary0(Unknown Source)\n    at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadLibrary(Unknown Source)\n    at java.lang.Runtime.load0(Unknown Source)\n    at java.lang.System.load(Unknown Source)\n    at java.lang.ClassLoader$NativeLibrary.load(Native Method)\n    at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadLibrary0(Unknown Source)\n    at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadLibrary(Unknown Source)\n    at java.lang.Runtime.loadLibrary0(Unknown Source)\n    at java.lang.System.loadLibrary(Unknown Source)\n    at sun.security.action.LoadLibraryAction.run(Unknown Source)\n    at java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(Native Method)\n    at sun.awt.NativeLibLoader.loadLibraries(Unknown Source)\n    at sun.awt.DebugHelper.<clinit>(Unknown Source)\n    at java.awt.Component.<clinit>(Unknown Source)\n    at javax.swing.ImageIcon.<clinit>(Unknown Source)\n    at hms.i.c(Unknown Source)\n    at hms.i.b(Unknown Source)\n    at hms.K.run(Unknown Source)\n    at java.lang.Thread.run(Unknown Source)\nException in thread \"Thread-4\" java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: /home/smythe/HEC/hec-hms35/java/lib/i386/xawt/libmawt.so: libXtst.so.6: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n    at java.lang.ClassLoader$NativeLibrary.load(Native Method)\n    at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadLibrary0(Unknown Source)\n    at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadLibrary(Unknown Source)\n    at java.lang.Runtime.load0(Unknown Source)\n    at java.lang.System.load(Unknown Source)\n    at java.lang.ClassLoader$NativeLibrary.load(Native Method)\n    at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadLibrary0(Unknown Source)\n    at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadLibrary(Unknown Source)\n    at java.lang.Runtime.loadLibrary0(Unknown Source)\n    at java.lang.System.loadLibrary(Unknown Source)\n    at sun.security.action.LoadLibraryAction.run(Unknown Source)\n    at java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(Native Method)\n    at java.awt.Toolkit.loadLibraries(Unknown Source)\n    at java.awt.Toolkit.<clinit>(Unknown Source)\n    at sun.print.CUPSPrinter.<clinit>(Unknown Source)\n    at sun.print.UnixPrintServiceLookup.getDefaultPrintService(Unknown Source)\n    at sun.print.UnixPrintServiceLookup.refreshServices(Unknown Source)\n    at sun.print.UnixPrintServiceLookup$PrinterChangeListener.run(Unknown Source)\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class java.awt.Toolkit\n    at java.awt.Color.<clinit>(Unknown Source)\n    at hms.model.l.<init>(Unknown Source)\n    at hms.model.ProjectManager.<init>(Unknown Source)\n    at hms.Hms.<init>(Unknown Source)\n    at hms.Hms.main(Unknown Source)\nException in thread \"Thread-2\" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class sun.print.CUPSPrinter\n    at sun.print.UnixPrintServiceLookup.getDefaultPrintService(Unknown Source)\n    at javax.print.PrintServiceLookup.lookupDefaultPrintService(Unknown Source)\n    at hms.util.f.run(Unknown Source)\n    at java.lang.Thread.run(Unknown Source)\n\nI get similar outputs when I try to run HEC-DSSVue.sh.

If you need to include the libraries in your source for some reason, you need to download them separately and include them.\n\n*If the library files exist but are not readable, then you need to provide us details on ownership of those files (pasting the output of ls -l /home/smythe/HEC/hec-hms35/java/lib/i386/xawt/ wouldn't hurt, so we can see the ownership rights on it, as well as read/write/execute permissions.)\n\n", "Q: 13.04 desktop suddenly disappeared I have seen an answer from version 12 to try\nunity --reset\nbut when I try this, it's deprecated\nI was able to run ccsm, but I don't know what to do to get back the bar, and the menu.\nEqually important, what did I do to get it to disappear?\nIt's not just the docking bar.

What will i do to work properly. please anybody help for this related problem.\nthank you\n\nA: Type\nsudo apt-get install vim\nin your terminal,\nthis will solve your problem\n\nA: By default, Ubuntu will install vim-tiny, a bare-bones version of vim.  When you type vi in the terminal, it will start this minimal vim in vi compatible mode by default.  From a normal vim user's standpoint, this is horrible, since vi compatible means backspace and all the normal vim behavior will behave in the original vi manner.\nOne solution is to open up .vimrc and turn off vim compatible mode by including the line: set nocompatible.\nThe other is to manually install more feature-filled version of vim (like the full version), e.g. sudo apt-get install vim.  By default, on Debian-based systems like Ubuntu, this will make the command vi start vim up in non-compatible mode.\n\nA: I had the same problem, remember that after typing test.c you have to press key \"i\" in order to start typing your code \n\nA: press the insert key to type/delete.  \nwhen you're finished editing, pressing esc will allow you to type commands like :wq (save and quit) or :q!

You're running wubi.exe on an out of date release (12.04) as opposed to the latest (12.04.2). This makes Wubi fail and unfortunately Wubi doesn't always report the first error, instead it tries to continue and then crashes when it gets a null exception (which is what you got).\nIf you want Wubi, then run wubi.exe standalone - get it from: http://releases.ubuntu.com/12.04/ or http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/windows-installer\nRemove the USB before installing.

I have here a new bought laptop. It's the first device with (U)EFI I was working with. At first I did not get the installation running, so I switched back to BIOS legacy mode and installed ubuntu in that mode.\nAll right. Now I want to add the preinstalled windows back into the boot loader to allow multiboot. This works only via EFI. So I googled around and found this link. I modified things a bit as I was after some tasting able to boot in efi mode the grub on the live cd and then booted manually into linux.\nSo in the end I have a grub installed on my EFI system partition and I am able to boot into linux directly from EFI. Now I have seen, that the grub.cfg has two locations: /boot/grub/ and /boot/efi/EFI/grub/. On runing update-grub only the version in /boot/grub/ will be affected. For the (manual) installation this is not an issue but any kernel update will NOT alter the important /boot/efi/EFI/grub/grub.cfg. I tried creating a symlink but it seems that the file gets deleted before rewriting. So the link is lost.\nSo my questions in detail:\n\n\n*\n\n*What have I to do to make the updates automatically? Should I mount -o bind the directory /boot/efi/EFI/grub to /boot/grub? Any better solutions?\n\n*Is it possible to make grub look into another position?\n\n*Where will an updated grub.efi be installed?\n\n*Are there other issues that I forgot so far?\n\n\nA: The last I checked, Ubuntu's version of GRUB 2 places a GRUB binary on the EFI System Partition (ESP), which is mounted at /boot/efi in Linux. The GRUB configuration files (grub.cfg and various support files) remain in /boot/grub, which is on another partition. (IMO, this is a bad design, but that's another matter....) Thus, if you use Ubuntu's GRUB binary, GRUB's menu should be updated automatically.\nIf you installed GRUB from source code, or perhaps from somebody else's binary, though, it could work differently, with grub.cfg and its support files on the ESP along with the GRUB binary. This setup is actually safer, but Ubuntu's scripts don't support it, so you'd have to manually update things after every kernel update. From your description, you seem to have this setup, although the site to which you linked seems to describe setting it up using Ubuntu's binaries, which is a puzzling inconsistency. Did you try something else at some point, or deviate from the site's instructions to get it working? You could test by making a change to the description of a boot option in one of the grub.cfg files (assuming you've got two of them) and seeing if that change appears in GRUB's menu when you reboot.\nAssuming you really do have a GRUB binary that looks on the ESP for its grub.cfg file, there are a number of possible solutions, including:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Ubuntu's version of GRUB over whatever you've got now. This is risky because it might not work, and could therefore leave you with an unbootable installation. (Your initial description says that your initial installation in EFI mode was unbootable, which suggests you might have a problem with Ubuntu's version of GRUB.)\n\n*Switch from GRUB to another boot manager/boot loader as your primary boot program. My own rEFInd is likely to be easy to get running, and it will handle kernel updates automatically. There's some risk of creating an unbootable installation if you try this, but the risk is less than that of replacing your working GRUB with another one, since you should be able to use your firmware's boot manager to boot via GRUB even if the new boot program fails completely.\n\n\nOne more comment: New computers invariably ship with Secure Boot active, which creates an extra hurdle to overcome. Ubuntu 12.10 and later come with Secure Boot support, but that doesn't always work. Most third-party boot loaders, including rEFInd, require extra work to get working with Secure Boot. Thus, if you haven't already done so, I recommend you disable Secure Boot in your firmware. If you want to boot with Secure Boot active, it's better to enable it after installing your boot loader, since you'll be able to test the boot loader without Secure Boot first, and then add Secure Boot to the picture and debug it with the knowledge that your basic boot loader configuration is working.\n\nA: If grub has no configuration in the EFI partition it seems to look under /boot/grub.\nboot-repair crashed my EFI partition.

You need to update the upstart script for mongodb so that it starts with the options you require, and then start it with service mongodb start.\nFirst of all, since the zone_reclaim_mode setting is system-wide rather than specific to mongodb, you could add the line:\nvm.zone_reclaim_mode = 0\n\nto /etc/sysctl.conf, which configures system variables on startup.\nNext, you need to update the script that upstart uses to start mongodb, /etc/init/mongodb.conf, so that it wraps the normal command with the numactl command. So the line:\nif [ \"x$ENABLE_MONGODB\" = \"xyes\" ]; then exec start-stop-daemon --start --quiet --chuid mongodb --exec  /usr/bin/mongod -- --config /etc/mongodb.conf; fi\n\nbecomes:\nif [ \"x$ENABLE_MONGODB\" = \"xyes\" ]; then exec start-stop-daemon --start --quiet --chuid mongodb --exec  /usr/bin/numactl -- --interleave=all /usr/bin/mongod --config /etc/mongodb.conf; fi\n\nYou also mention that upstart won't auto-start your service on boot; if that still happens after making the above changes, please attached a full extract from /var/log/mongodb/mongodb.log of a failed start.\n\nA: for ubuntu 16.04 mongod.service file should look like\n[Unit]\nDescription=High-performance, schema-free document-oriented database\nAfter=time-sync.target network.target\n\n[Service]\nType=forking\nUser=mongod\nGroup=mongod\nLimitNOFILE=65000\nPermissionsStartOnly=true\nEnvironmentFile=/etc/default/mongod\nExecStartPre=/usr/bin/percona-server-mongodb-helper.sh\nExecStart=/usr/bin/env bash -c \"numactl --interleave=all /usr/bin/mongod $OPTIONS > ${STDOUT} 2> ${STDERR}\"\n#ExecStart=/usr/bin/env bash -c \"/usr/bin/mongod $OPTIONS > ${STDOUT} 2> ${STDERR}\"\nPIDFile=/var/run/mongod.pid\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n\nand you also can specify nofile limit with LimitNOFILE param\n\nA: The Ubuntu MongoDB upstart script now checks for the presence of the numactl binary and adjusts accordingly.\nThe NUMA warning can be fixed as follows with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and MongoDB 2.6:\nsudo apt-get -y install numactl\nsudo restart mongod\n\n\nA: i know the question is about upstart, but just in case someone (like me) needs a init.d solution:  \nreplace the start_server() function in /etc/init.d/mongodb for the code below  \nstart_server() {\n    test -e \"$RUNDIR\" || install -m 755 -o mongodb -g mongodb -d \"$RUNDIR\"\n\n    NUMACTL=$(which numactl)\n\n    if [ ! \"$NUMACTL\" ]; then\n        # start original\n        start-stop-daemon --background --start --quiet --pidfile $PIDFILE --make-pidfile --chuid $DAEMONUSER --exec $DAEMON -- $DAEMON_OPTS\n        errcode=$?\n        return $errcode\n    else\n        # Start the process using the wrapper\n        $NUMACTL --interleave=all -- start-stop-daemon --background --start --quiet --pidfile $PIDFILE --make-pidfile --chuid $DAEMONUSER --exec $DAEMON -- $DAEMON_OPTS\n        errcode=$?\n        return $errcode\n    fi\n}\n\n", "Q: Age of Empires 2 HD not working good I have Ubuntu 13.04.

I am have issues getting the ethernet port on the laptop to connect. I also have a Ultrabase dock for the laptop. While docked, the ethernet port on the Ultrabase connects perfectly. Whether the laptop is docked or not the its own ethernet port won't connect. However, the ethernet port on the laptop does light up when a cable is plugged into it when it isn't docked. It doesn't light up at all when it's docked.\nMy current theory is that because I installed Xubuntu with the laptop docked and the ethernet plugged into the dock this caused port on the laptop to not be setup. From looking at my network settings in xfce it seems that only eth0 is setup and that is the port on the base. Whether the device is docked or not that is the only interface that shows up and when using the dock's port it is connected. Does this mean that the port on the laptop is completely broken or is it a software problem?\n\nA: Just by what you've provided, it does sound like the physical port on the side of the laptop may be having issues... is it possible for you to verify that it works in another OS, or in another state?  i.e.:  Are you dual booting?\nIf you see similar behavior in another OS, that's likely your port...\nAlso, a lot of Ethernet ports these days (but not all) have 'link lights' on the side.

I am a person that needs to know the \"why\" about stuff so any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: http://aiotestking.wordpress.com/category/linux/lpic-1/page/7/\nThis appears to be the exact question, without the extra slash in the answer.\nHowever, when tested, it works either way... so, I looked around some more, and found yet another version picks the answer as double-backslashes:\nhttp://studyhat.blogspot.com/2012/08/linux-question-answer.html\nI would say the question may have slipped past the editors or reposters on various sites or books, but I'm interested to see if anyone else has an opinion as to what the extra backslashes after the home directory specification signify or are capable of.  \nThere appears to be multiple ways to do this, but I'm not sure why... and one doesn't work at all (but seems indicated in many places as the 'correct' method - rmdir ~user/\\\\userdir).\n\nA: I think you garbled the question, because as stated, it and the answer don't really match one another.\nThe backslash - \\ - is used as an \"escape\" key in most Linux shells and many languages.  What that means is that it either begins a special code, or nullifies a special character.  \nFor example, the $ character has a special meaning, signifying a variable expansion, in the shell.  But what if you want to name a file \"$money\"?  You can't just touch $money because the shell will think you want to expand a variable named \"money\".  So, you instead touch \\$money, and now the shell will escape the $, treating it as a literal character instead of as a variable signifier.\nroot@banshee:/tmp# touch $money\ntouch: missing file operand\nTry `touch --help' for more information.\nroot@banshee:/tmp# touch \\$money\nroot@banshee:/tmp# ls -l | grep money\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root    root       0 May 10 21:31 $money\nroot@banshee:/tmp# rm $money\nrm: missing operand\nTry `rm --help' for more information.\nroot@banshee:/tmp# rm \\$money\nroot@banshee:/tmp# ls -l | grep money\nroot@banshee:/tmp# \n\nYou can also use the escape character to \"nerf\" a space.  Normally, if you have spaces in an argument, the shell will interpret it as separate keywords, rather than a single keyword with a space in it.  But if you escape the space, the shell will interpret it as a single keyword with a space.  Like this:\nroot@banshee:/tmp# touch bobs money\nroot@banshee:/tmp# ls | egrep '(bob|money)'\nbobs\nmoney\nroot@banshee:/tmp# rm bobs ; rm money\nroot@banshee:/tmp# touch bobs\\ money\nroot@banshee:/tmp# ls | egrep '(bob|money)'\nbobs money\n\nThe escape character also escapes itself.  So, if you wanted to create a file called \"\\myfile\", you'd need to do this:\nroot@banshee:/tmp# touch \\\\myfile\nYou have new mail in /var/mail/root\nroot@banshee:/tmp# ls -l | grep myfile\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root    root       0 May 10 21:25 \\myfile\n\nAnd if you then want to remove \\myfile, you would again escape the backslash with a second backslash, just like you did when you created it:\nroot@banshee:/tmp# rm \\\\myfile\nroot@banshee:/tmp# ls -l | grep myfile\nroot@banshee:/tmp# \n\nAlternately, you could wrap the filename in single quotes.  Single quotes tell the shell that you don't want it to process spaces inside the quotes as meaning separate keywords, AND that you don't want variable or wildcard expansions to take place within the quotes:\nroot@banshee:/tmp# ls -l | grep myfile\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root    root       0 May 10 21:28 \\myfile\nroot@banshee:/tmp# rm '\\myfile'\nroot@banshee:/tmp# ls -l | grep myfile\n\nNote the implication here: if you actually want to make a filename that includes single quotes wrapped around it, you'll need to use the escape character to escape the single quotes!\nroot@banshee:/tmp# touch 'myfile'\nroot@banshee:/tmp# ls -l | grep myfile\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root    root       0 May 10 21:29 myfile\nroot@banshee:/tmp# rm myfile\nroot@banshee:/tmp# touch \\'myfile\\'\nroot@banshee:/tmp# ls -l | grep myfile\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root    root       0 May 10 21:29 'myfile'\n\nHope that helps make this clearer.\n\nA: Explaination on why to use ~Bob/\nUsually on your own Linux computer you use ~/ for your Home directory. The reason for this is that we usually assume you are logged in as the user you are using, and typing ~/ will take you to the home of the user you are logged in as.\nSo some situations using ~/ or just ~ will not work.\n\n\n*\n\n*Logged in as root\n\n*Logged in as another user\n\n\nIn this case we can use ~Bob specifying the home folder of user \"Bob\" \nThis explains why to use that form of home folder\n", "Q: photo stream on ubuntu Well, I have an iPhone 5, this device (actually, all apples devices) can share pictures, documents and among other things by photo-stream or icloud.

This worked for me.\nTry this: \nGo to: /etc/pulse/default.pa and comment out the following line with a # sign:  \nload-module module-switch-on-port-available\n\n\nA: I've got an HP Pavilion dv6 with beats audio, and I had the exact same problem. Alsamixer muted the 'Speaker' volume when I plugged my headphones in, and apparently, that is the volume the headphones use. I found the following workaround:\nsudo gedit /usr/share/pulseaudio/alsa-mixer/paths/analog-output-headphones.conf\n\nYou'll find the line:\n[Element Speaker]\nswitch = off\nvolume = off\n\nChange it to:\n[Element Speaker]\nswitch = on\nvolume = merge\n\nNow, do the same with usr/share/pulseaudio/alsa-mixer/paths/analog-output-headphones-2.conf\nand reboot. Now your headphones should work. However, when you unplug them the sound from your internal speakers will be at the same volume your headphones were at. So while this does not make the audio work as well as before, at least it doesn't mute your headphones all the time.\nEDIT: Only one of the headphone jacks (the one at the front) is working for me, even though I changed headphones-2 as well.

I know on Microsoft Windows you can do this with some utilities such as WinZip (if I remember correctly).\nHowever if I do it on Windows then file permissions/ownership are not kept, and when extracting in Ubuntu at a later point (several .z files) it often becomes corrupt.\nI need to make the size of these files indented down to 100 MB or less due to upload restrictions (I am making a program that needs to download some big files).\nIt needs to be CLI based (or at least have a support for CLI extraction). This is for support on Ubuntu Servers.\n\nA: You can use bzip2 and bunzip2 are file compression and decompression utilities. \n\nThe bzip2 and bunzip2 utilities are newer than gzip and gunzip and are\n  not as common yet, but they are rapidly gaining popularity. The bzip2\n  utility is capable of greater compression ratios than gzip. Therefore,\n  a bzip2 file can be 10-20% smaller than a gzip version of the same\n  file. Usually,files that have been compressed by bzip2 will have a\n  .bz2 extension.1\n\nTo install, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nsudo apt-get install bzip2 \n\nFor more info, and how to use, you can take a look here\nNote: I don't think that it will limit the size, but the compression is excellent.\nNow you can also use WinRAR.  WinRAR is a powerful archive manager. It can backup your data and reduce the size of email attachments, decompress RAR, ZIP and other files. \nTo download and install click here.

I'm running 12.04 LTS, btw.\nAfter many hours spent searching and reading, I successfully followed the instructions in post #3 on here, summarized below:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install dependencies by typing in the terminal:\n$ sudo apt-get install cd-discid cdparanoia flac lame mp3gain normalize-audio ruby-gnome2 ruby vorbisgain\n\n\n*Run each of these commands, one after the other (note, in the fourth one down, replace admin with whatever your username is on your linux box, assuming you have admin privileges):\n$ sudo apt-get install libgettext-ruby1.8 make\n$ cd /usr/local/src\n$ ls -ld .\n$ sudo chgrp admin .\n$ sudo chmod g+w .\n$ wget http://rubyripper.googlecode.com/files/rubyripper-0.6.0.tar.bz2\n$ sha1sum rubyripper-0.6.0.tar.bz2\n$ tar xvjf rubyripper-0.6.0.tar.bz2\n$ cd rubyripper-0.6.0\n$ ./configure --enable-lang-all --enable-gtk2 --enable-cli --prefix=/usr/local\n$ sudo make install\n\nNote, on my first attempt at following these instructions, I got stuck on the last step ($ sudo make install) because the previous step failed to create the make files, which happened because I did not replace \"admin\" with \"scott\" in step 4, which meant that my privileges weren't set up properly. To fix that, I had to delete the rubyripper-0.6.0 directory and the tar.bz2 file, redo step 4 with the proper group name of \"scott\" instead of \"admin,\" and then redo the rest of the steps. When I did step 4 correctly, everything else worked as expected and I was able to finally launch rubyripper (I prefer using the GUI versus the CLI, so I invoke $ rrip_gui).\nLet me know if you get stuck trying these steps and I will try to help you out.\n\nA: To install it, follow the below steps:\n1.) Download getdeb package, then double-click to install. It adds the getdeb repository to your system.\nDownload getdeb package\n2.) Install Synaptic Package Manager from Ubuntu Software Center, then open it. Click on Reload button to update package lists. Finally search for and mark to install rubyripper:\n\nsource: http://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2013/07/install-rubyripper-ubuntu-linux-mint/\n", "Q: In settings menu \"Background\" entry appears rather than \"Appearance\" \n\n\"Appearance\" still appears in the dash but opening it only opens system settings. I have a feeling this problem is related to this one\n\nA: You have a GNOME PPA enabled, which installs a default build of GNOME without the Ubuntu patches, which includes the changes to the Background settings, to add the Unity related options, and which renames it to Appearance.\nThis is also the reason you have two different Online Accounts items in your System Settings.\n", "Q: How to make folders ' seen' by PLEX When I want to add a folder to PLEX I cannot find it.\nI have 2 harddrives in my computer. Ubuntu 13 installed on the 120GB SSD and another 1TB normal harddrive which contains 1 Folder called 'Films'. In that folder there are many other folders with films in it.\nWhen I add a Movie section from PLEX I can select the 1TB harddrive. So the drive is recognized. But afterwards I cannot select the folder 'Films' althoug it is there.\nThe filemanager (second icon from the top on menu bar) does show the folder.\nAny clue how I can make sure PLEX recognizes this folder so I can select it?\n\nA: Here is my solution:\nRemove the old installation of plex:\nsudo apt-get remove plexmediaserver\nsudo apt-get purge plexmediaserver\nsudo rm -r plexmediaserver/\n\nDownload plex from the website\nGo to Downloads folder\nInstall plex:\nsudo dpkg -i plexmediaserver_0.9.7.22.511-4b5280f_amd64.deb\n\nchange user to you instead of plex:\nsudo nano /etc/default/plexmediaserver\n\nRun once\nhttp:// localhost:32400/web/index.html#!/dashboard\n\nStop:\nsudo service plexmediaserver stop\n\nadd user to group:\nsudo addgroup plex youruser\n\nsudo addgroup youruser plex\nstart:\nsudo service plexmediaserver start\n\n\nA: This because plex does not support sub folders. What id did was copy all my movies out of their sub folders and into a new folder. Try executing the following commands\nmkdir ~/PlexMovies\nfind ~/Videos -name '*.mp4' -exec cp {} ~/PlexMovies \\;\n\nNow this assumes that all your videos are in the mp4 format. Execute this command for every type of video you have by replacing *.mp4 with any other movie type. Then have plex pull your movies from ~/PlexMovies\n", "Q: How do I control the order of nameserver addresses in resolv.conf? I need to re-order /etc/resolv.conf to list the nameserver provided by eth1 dhcp before the nameserver provided by eth0 dhcp on a 12.04 server (no NetworkManager).\nI edited /etc/resolveconf/interface-order and replaced its 'eth*' entry with;\neth1\neth0\n\nThen tried resolvconf -u, ifdown'ed and ifup'ed each interface, dpkg-reconfigure resolvconf, service networking restart and rebooted.  None of this had any effect on the order of resolv.conf.  What am I missing?\n\nA: The resolvconf records have names that follow the pattern \nIFACE.CONFIGURER\n\nSo to force eth1* records to come before other eth* records you need to replace\neth*\n\nwith\neth1*\neth*\n\nAfter making this change, do\nsudo resolvconf -u\n\n", "Q: How can I animate my mouse for screencasts? I need to create some screencast tutorials, and I would like to animate my mouse for this purpose. E.g. Ideally I would like my mouse to be highlighted, to use an animation when clicking, and possibly to show click and drags. Can anyone suggest a solution?\nI am happy using gtk-record-my-destop for the screencasts.\n\nA: If you are using compiz (part of Ubuntu's Unity DE) you can install ccsm and there is a mouse option that adds spinning objects around the mouse, you can reduce there spacing to 0 or near it so it will be right on the mouse, if you need to record the keyboard presses/mouse buttons you can use keymon (the debs do not install the program, just dependencies); also i think kazam works better than gtk-record-my-desktop\n\n", "Q: How to configure 12.04.2 network without being connected?

Otherwise, they are on the \"wrong\" network and the folks in the NOC become concerned.\nHow can I get the Network tool to let me configure the machines offline?\n(I know I can almost do what I want by editing /etc/network/interfaces, but I really prefer to use the Network tool instead.)\n\nA: You can't.

I like to customize my desktop , so is there any compiz replacement for mir ?\nEDIT : \nI mean , can we customize (Unity Next) and use compiz on it ?\n\nA: Compiz is a compositing engine. It was designed to add compositing capabilities to window managers that run on top of X.\nMir has a compositing engine built in.\nThe two would be contradictory, so you cannot use Compiz on top of Mir.\n", "Q: 13.04 Not working period I have reinstalled this 4 times now and cant seem to get it to boot now.

If you don't have an Ubuntu One account, you can register for one at https://one.ubuntu.com/ - it's free and already built into the installation of Ubuntu 12.10 you'll have once you're done installing.\nOr, if you use another cloud service (Dropbox, Google Drive, etc), Firefox on the Live CD should be able to access those too.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Cannot get Ubuntu 13.04 to load I tried the automatic update, and it quit less than half way though.  Now 12 won't load without going through advanced options.  I installed 13 on a separate partition, but from the loader, I get nothing but a flashing cursor and then a blank black screen.  Anybody have any ideas?\n\nA: Usually I install Ubuntu with two partitions, one for '/' to hold the system which I can easily format and re-install incase a problem crops up, and the rest of the drive assigned to '/home' to hold my files and settings so that I do not lose anything during a fresh install...  I'd recommend doing this with a fresh install after backing up your files...\n\nA: It's difficult to guess what may have gone wrong, but among other things, there is a remote possibility that your boot menu is is out of sync with what is actually on your system. This can happen if you re-partition, upgrade, etc.\nTo be sure that your GRUB menu is still pointing to the right places you can run sudo update-grub. This will rebuild your boot menu from whatever systems are found on your computer.\n", "Q: Wireless is Connected but No access to Internet 12.10 I got my wireless to work finally after initial issues.

I have more than enough free unused space, but the Microsoft Reserved (MSR) partition on the Windows side kicks in once I boot into Ubuntu.\n\nA: After much digging, I realized that the source of my confusion is the fact that Ubuntu was installed with WUBI. Also, the multi-boot via UEFI did something weird where it seems only one partition was used. Somehow, Ubuntu and windows boots from a single partition under a single SSD marked as an MBR.\nFurthermore, I did not have enough space to do a clone of the root disk before a resize - I needed to resize in place. \nThese were the instructions I followed, which allowed me to do everything within 5 mintues on my SSD: Ubuntu Help Wiki - resize wubi disk\n\n\n*\n\n*You have to boot from a live CD/USB. This won't work while running Wubi.\n\n*Backup the root.disk (not required, but a good idea)\n\n*Mount the NTFS partition that your root.disk is on (this example assumes it's /dev/sda1 and the mountpoint is /media/win - adjust accordingly in the following instructions):\nsudo mkdir -p /media/win\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /media/win\n\n\n*Check the size of the root.disk (not required)\ndu -h --apparent-size /media/win/ubuntu/disks/root.disk\n\n\n*Run fsck on the root.disk\nfsck -f /media/win/ubuntu/disks/root.disk\n\n\n*Resize - specify the desired final size (this example resizes to 10 GB)\nresize2fs /media/win/ubuntu/disks/root.disk 10G\n\n\n*Reboot back into Wubi Ubuntu\nI hope this helps others in my same, somewhat unusual situation, in the future.

However, the interface is lacking the side taskbar and the upper statusbar - they don't reappear until I force reboot via terminal.\nI must add that I've installed Fedora insted - hoping it will work properly - but the same thing happend with Fedora (latest version). Made me think there is a problem either with my hardware configuration or with the kernel (I don't know whether Fedora and Ubuntu use the same kernel). I tried formatting the hard drive and reinstalling. The same problem occured. Everything works fine with Ubuntu 11.10. It is only the later versions which present me with these freezing problems. \nMy specs:\n\n\n*\n\n*Intel Core i5-2300 2.8GHz-3.1GHz 6MB cache 95W LGA1155 desktop computer\n\n*Intel Bearup Lake DH67BL H67 LGA1155 uATX\n\n*Sound & Graphics cards - Intel on board.\n\n*4GB memory\n\n*100TB HD\n\n\nThanks alot.\n\nA: Have you tested your RAM?

The function is not shown and the shortcut Ctrl+D isn't working either. Is this functionality just gone for some reason (as the split screen with F3) or is there something wrong with my upgrade?\nThanks for any hints.\n\nA: It's happened to me too. But I've had a Kernel Panic problem while upgrading from 12.10 to 13.04. I was able to restore my system, but none of my previous bookmarks were available. \nIt seems that the default folder where Nautilus saves bookmarks has changed. I restored them by copying my previous bookmarks from the file /home/yourusername/.gtk-bookmarks to /home/yourusername/.config/gtk-3.0/bookmarks. A simple text copy and paste using gedit.\n\nA: Nautilus bookmark settings\nTo manage bookmarks go to the Files menu in the panel to open the Bookmarks dialog. There we may enter a name and a path of a bookmark to appear in the Nautilus left side panel in the Bookmarks section:\n\nBookmark an opened directory\nAlternatively open the directory you want to bookmark.

I had the same problem when updating to v13.04/GTK classic. The bookmark feature was simply gone. For a time, I thought that this very useful feature had just been removed. However, in the course of reconfiguring Brasero plugins I discovered the problem. I was starting Brasero from the command line since there was no menu entry created when I installed Brasero. I kept getting an error essentially telling me that Brasero couldn't access the bookmark file: Permission Denied. When I tried to check the permissions of ~/.config/gtk-3.0/bookmarks, I couldn't even open the .config folder. It turned out that the owner:group of .config and all its children had been changed to root:root with no access at all given to \"Other\".\nI then recursively changed the owner:group of .config to me:me (sudo chown -R me:me .config). I also changed the file mode of directories to 775 and of any files to 664. This fixed the Brasero problem and also, magically, my bookmarks were back!\n\nA: I found that in Precise 12.04, I had to modify TWO files to get all the behaviors.\n$HOME/.gtk-bookmarks\nThis gave me the bookmarks in Nautilus\n$HOME/.config/yourGTKVersion/bookmarks\nThis gave me bookmarks in the file opening dialog box for all other applications. \nDon't know if UBUNTU will keep them synced from ths point or not. I was moving my home directory from 10.10 to a new hard drive with 12.04. I had made the mistake of running for a LOOOOOOONG time on a non LTS (Long Time Support) version. Over a 6 month period, all my repos for updates vanished. I couldn't even get the latest PHP for my version. HAD to switch. And I needed to get back to developing code QUICK, needed bookmarks, etc.\n\nA: in 13.10 I just realized that you can use CTRL+D...the shortcut is not presented in the menu but it works to create new bookmarks.\n", "Q: Installing Python 3.2.x on 12.04 I'm completely new to Ubuntu (and any OS outside of Windows).

In both cases they're not directly related to the key in the ignition, getting charge to your sparkplugs, or getting fuel to the engine.  \nIt's not a direct simile since rfkill doesn't really contribute to your driver operation like an oil change does, but it should get the point across.\n", "Q: Getting VI to auto syntax highlight and autoindent I prefer using vi from tty1 as I hate GUI.

I'd like to disable pad click. Usually it was possible in system settings under mouse and touch pad, but in Ubuntu 12.04 I can't see \"touch pad\" in mouse and touch pad settings...\nI've installed touchpad-indicator but it seems it's not what I wanted. I don't want to disable the touchpad, just the pad click.\nIs it possible that the system lacks the drivers for the touchpad? How can I check it? I can't see the touchpad with system settings > mouse and touchpad (there is only \"mouse\"), with synaptiks nor with pointing devices. \nThanks\n\nA: Have you tried synaptiks?\nAlthough it says KDE, it works fine in Ubuntu.\n\nUnder Touchpad configuration there should be some point \"Tap\" or similar (Sorry, I have the German version only), where you can set the mouse button that will be emulated by a tap.\nHope that helps.\n", "Q: MP3 Mixing program Is there a mixing program that exist for mixing mp3/wav files like for example VirtualDJ or Tracktor for Linux Ubuntu?\n\nA: Yes.

I know that when a package update appears in the repository, its older version disappears from there. But what if new version has a regression? Where can I find previous ones?\nNote: I don't mean package from older distro release or anything like that. I mean the version directly preceding current, e.g. if wine-1.5.29 is current, I need wine-1.5.28 and maybe earlier ones. Of course, wine is a bad example since I can find any version on their website, but this isn't the case for all packages.\nSearching in /var/cache/apt/archives is not an option because it may be occasionally cleaned by apt-get clean.\n\nA: Ubuntu uses Launchpad to host all its packages specifically here:\nhttps://launchpad.net/ubuntu\nFrom here you can find the source code to any package simply by searching\nFor example by searching for for acpid you are taken here\nhttps://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/acpid\nfrom here you can View the full publishing history,  or View full change log to find all releases and select the one you want.\nIn many cases you will also be able to find binaries.  However I have seen examples where the binaries are missing.  I'm not sure why but I presume this is when the main truck has changed more than once between Ubuntu releases.  \nThe developer may have updated the source from upstream project for the first upstream change, tested it and published the source then immediately updated the with the second update and published again with the current upstream release.\n", "Q: 500 GB Hard disk showing only 465 GB after installing Ubuntu 13.04 alongside windows 7 and then formatting the whole drive Tried to install Ubuntu alongside Windows 7.

I tried the boot repair but the procedure was completed without making any changes.\nI would appreciate all the help i can get to retrieve my lost hard disk space do that i can install windows 7 alone.\n\nA: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_prefix\n\nThe computer industry has historically used the units kilobyte,\n  megabyte, and gigabyte, and the corresponding symbols KB, MB, and GB,\n  in at least two slightly different measurement systems. In citations\n  of main memory (RAM) capacity, gigabyte customarily means\n  1073741824bytes. As this is the third power of 1024, and 1024 is a\n  power of 2 (210), this usage is therefore referred to as a binary\n  prefix.\nIn most other contexts, the industry uses the multipliers kilo, mega,\n  giga, etc., in a manner consistent with their meaning in the\n  International System of Units (SI), namely as powers of 1000. For\n  example, a 500gigabyte hard disk holds 500000000000bytes, and a\n  100megabit per second Ethernet connection transfers data at\n  100000000bit/s. In contrast with the binary prefix usage, this use is\n  described as a decimal prefix, as 1000 is a power of 10.\n\n500000000000 B / 1073741824 = 465 GiB\n\nA: Try installing Gparted and see what used the gigabytes.\nProbably it's an extra partition used by Ubuntu. e.g. a swap-partition.\n", "Q: How I can report Ubuntu about issues in new Ubuntu version 13.04-64 I am using ubuntu since 11.04. The newest version 13.04 blockades the use with many issues. I want to tell them all to get a better useful ubuntu version in the future. Is this side the right one? \nFor example some new installed aplications are not starting. Or about the new changes, how useful they are\n\nA: You can report bugs on https://launchpad.net to a specific project, but this is to new or unexperienced users a bit complicated and requires some time. So if this does not suit you, there is also something everyone can do.\nWhen an application crashes and Ubuntu asks for a bug report, just allow to send it. This will also give some technical information to the developers without making you trouble to collect them. I know sometimes it's annoying, but on the long term it will help. This is something just everyone can do to help, no matter how technically savvy they are.\nIf you can afford it, of course doing both is the best.\n\nA: Please could you report the specifics of your problem to https://launchpad.net ?\nThis will help all of us get a better Ubuntu.

Will any one have any idea about this.\n\nA: You need to record the iso (a DVD image) to a blank DVD using your Windows DVD recording software.\nThen you put it in your DVD player and boot from the DVD. How to do this depends on your computer BIOS settings. On some computers you can press F12 or some other function key to get a boot device menu where you can choose the DVD drive. When you boot does it show you a message like F12 Boot menu or something of the sort?\nOn others PC's you'll have to enter BIOS settings (see what shows on screen immediately after you turn your computer on). Find the boot order settings and make sure the DVD drive is before the hard disk. Save settings and continue.\nSince you seem inexperienced, please make sure you do a backup on an external drive of all important things on your PC just in case you get it wrong.\nIf in doubt what options to choose ask before continuing.\n", "Q: RAM slot free or not This question might not be so relevant here, but I want to know if there is some command tool that gives me the currently available RAM slots in my machine, also if any of them is free, and information of the reserved slots.

I post this question since new nautilus is very 'keyboard unfriendly', specially for one-key shortcuts. From 3.4 to 3.6 the very useful 'backspace' shortcut to go to parent directory has gone (along many other features).\nIn particular I would like to know how to go to the parent directory.\n\nA: It's not obvious looking at the user interface that there are any shortcuts.

I wanted to separate /var out to its own partition. So I booted gparted live, created another ext4 partition and then booted ubuntu server, and selected that partition and selected /var as the mount point of that partition. But when I selected \"finish partitioning and write changes to disc\", I get a red screen that says \"No root filesystem is defined. Please correct this from the partitioning menu\". But I don't want this partition to have a root file system. I just want the sda1 root file system with os installed to use /var from this partition.\n\nA: To make Ubuntu use that partition (supposing it is sda2) as /var you just need to add that mount point in /etc/fstab:\n/dev/sda2   /var    ext4    defaults    0   2\n\nIf you want you can use also the UUID of the partition: just do la -la /dev/disk/by-uuid and get the correct value for sda2:\nUUID=<uuid-for-sda2>    /var    ext4    defaults    0   2\n\nFinally reboot or use sudo mount -a.\nNOTE: you will have to move/copy the actual contents of /var to the new partition.\n", "Q: Help with boot screen I want to have a different boot screen when I start my computer.

Ubuntu 13.04 Okay 1st off let me start by saying I have only been using Ubuntu..or Linux in general for about 3 months but in an effort to get the most out of my old tower I have decided to upgrade my ram ..I have read that some Linux distros install into ram so will anything be missing or corrupted? \nWill I have to re-partition anything ..and I don’t know if this will matter but I started out with a \"recommended install\" in the installation wizard with Ubuntu 12.10 and then auto upgraded to Ubuntu 13.40\nThe motherboard I am using is an MSI MS-7181 VER 2.0\nThe ram I have is 2 stick of 512mb of DDR pc3200 184pin non EEC \nThe ram I will be installing is  CT2KIT12864Z40B  2GB kit (1GBx2), 184-pin DIMM\nany help you can give will be greatly appreciated \n\nA: Nothing is permanently installed on RAM. RAM only stores data while it has power. Changing or upgrading your RAM will not affect your linux installation\n\nA: No. You shouldn\"t have to repartition anything if you're just upgrading RAM. The partitions exist on your Hard Drive. (Or Solid State Drive, USB, etc. that you installed the Operating System on.) \n\n\n*\n\n*Just be sure your RAM matches what is required for your motherboard (which it looks like you have). That includes pins and speed.\n\n*Be careful of electro-static Discharge (static electricity), this is\nbest prevented by wearing a grounding strap or touching the case\nbefore touching any components.\n\n*Also, when handling the RAM sticks\n(modules), only touch the plastic edges. Don't touch any metal\nsurface on the module, especially the contacts that go into the slot.\nTouching them can damage the module and cause corrosion.\n\n", "Q: Problems with SMB shares: Is it possible to downgrade gvfsd-smb?

And updated kernel was available, but was being held back by apt-get. So I used Synaptic to install the kernel update (3.8.0-25-generic), rebooted the system, and sound was working again.\nSo the solution may be as simple as updating your kernel.\n\nA: To me, what worked was a\nsudo apt-get install linux-image-3.8.0-25-generic\n\nrebooting, noting, to my horror, that not the video card nor the wlan card were working, issuing a panicked\nsudo apt-get remove linux-image-3.8.0-25-generic\n\nrebooting and, to my relief, finding both new (video, wlan) and old problems (audio) to be gone at once. \n", "Q: Matlab Installation \"finished\"?

You can cd to /usr/lib/jvm/ and list all files. There you may find java versions like\n\njava-8-openjdk\njava-8-openjdk-amd64\njava-1.8.3-openjdk-amd64\njava-x-oracle\n\nYou can one as your Java engine.\nPersonally, I picked the following one and the this command for my MATLAB R2016a installation on Bbuntu 16.04:\n\nsudo sh ./install -javadir /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/jre/\n\nYou can try different jdk/jre for your case, if you want.

I want to use apt-get autoremove to remove liba for instance, but I'm not sure whether it is smart enough to preserve other dependencies. For instance, if liba depends on libb, while libc also depends on libb, will\nsudo apt-get autoremove liba\n\nremove libb or not? Thanks in advance.\n\nA: None of the apt-get or other APT tools will ever break dependencies (except for bugs).\nYou don't run apt-get autoremove liba, just apt-get autoremove. The whole point of autoremove is that it discovers what there is to remove.\nWhen you run apt-get autoremove, check the list of packages to make sure you aren't relying on any of the packages that it will remove. A package that you use all the time could have been pulled in as a dependency of another package without you having noticed that.\n\nA: The autoremove option to apt-get will only remove the packages which depend on liba and packages which are no longer used.\n\nA: From the apt-get man page:\n\nautoremove is used to remove packages that were automatically\n  installed to satisfy dependencies for some package and that are no\n  more needed.\n\nautoremove doesn't accept any package as argument (the command is just apt-get autoremove). No dependency will be broken.\n\nA: If you want to remove liba you should run apt remove liba. Then you can run apt autoremove to remove any other dependencies of liba that is not used anymore.\napt keeps (1) a list of packages that you install and (2) a list of packages that automatically installed because it was dependencies on the packages that you installed. So when you call apt autoremove it checks these lists for packages that (1) you didn't install on your own and (2) also that are not dependencies to other packages anymore.\n", "Q: WiFi option disappeared after installing updates in Ubuntu 12.10 This morning I installed some of the updates for Ubuntu 12.10 and my WiFi has disappeared.\nThis is the output for rfkill list all:\n0: hci0: Bluetooth\n    Soft blocked: yes\n    Hard blocked: no\n\nYou can see that there is not even an option for wireless.

The installation process will begin when you click the Install Now button.\nUbuntu needs about 4.5 GB to install, so add a few extra GB to allow for your files.\nNot sure about this step?

It's simpler and completely safe.\nWhat is the advandage (or disadvantage) of installing Ubuntu in a different partition?\nThank you or your help.\n\nA: I advise you start by simply booting the desktop editions, you may wish to try Ubuntu (unity), gnome edition, and kubuntu (kde), just to see what you like. \nAssuming your hardware works and you like ubuntu you would then install.\nUbuntu will need at least 2 partitions, one of swap and one for Ubuntu.\nIn general I would use a minimum of 10 Gb for the root partition. In general your swap partition should be = to the size of your ram.\nI think you are asking about a wubi install, installing alongside windows. wubi has advantages and disadvantages, but is no longer maintained, so you can not use it with 13.04\nIn general I do not personally like wubi, but if yo like you can use it.\nYou will want to back up your data and read the installation guides before you install.\nSee also\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/GraphicalInstall\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/WubiGuide\n\nA: You cannot install both operating systems on the same partition.\nAs a tip:\nThe easy way to do it is install Windows 7 first, then make some unalocated space, that space is where Ubuntu will be installed. Afther these steps just go install Ubuntu and when it ask you if you want to install clean or along side Windows you chose along side Windows and it will make a partition from that unallocated space.\n\nA: The best think will be 3 partitions, 2 ntfs and the other one ext4, a ntfs partition will be for windows 7 and the other one for data is where you save your documents, photos, videos, etc. so you can acess from both systems. The ext4 partition will be for ubuntu (if you use windows for change the partitions do it in ntfs and before installing ubuntu in the instaler you can change it to ext4; I recomend that you use at least 40-50 GB for ubuntu and 40-50 GB for Windows 7, de rest for data. (If your computer have between 1 and 3 GB of RAM I recomend you to do and extended partition with a 40gb for ubuntu and 1 GB for swap so the coputer will go quicker).\nI've trayed using wubi in the same partition but it dident work really well I wasn't having acses to my win7 documents and some programs didn't work the mach as quicker.\nSorry for my spelling.\n", "Q: How to get moonlight drm working on ubuntu?

How do I remove that?\nAlso, I would like to have some kind of task manager functionality. Are there any replacements that aren't so annoying to use and actually work?\n\nA: Evolution is (by design) tightly integrated into gnome 3 and you can not easily remove it. Some people have used thunderbird in place of evolution. Removing the evolution package is likely going to break gnome.\nI suggest:\n\n\n*\n\n*File a bug report(s).\n\n*Learn to overlook evolutions short comings.\n\n*Or use an alternate desktop (Unity, KDE, XFCE ...)\n\n\nA: The \"Nothing To Do\" extension ( extensions.gnome.org/extension/153/nothingtodo/ ) removes the part of the calendar that evolution uses.\nTechnically, evolution is part of the GNOME desktop environment. If you remove one program that comes with gnome, then you won't have the complete GNOME any more. That's why if you try to remove evolution, the system will try to also remove the \"gnome\" metapackage which depends on evolution. The solution to this problem is marking all the packages that \"gnome\" depends on as not auto-installed. The packages that were installed because something else depends on them are marked as automatically installed. In this way you can remove both \"evolution\" and \"gnome\" without letting \"apt-get autoremove\" uninstalling the whole gnome environment. The commands to achieve this are: \naptitude unmarkauto '?reverse-depends(gnome) | ?reverse-recommends(gnome)'\naptitude unmarkauto '?reverse-depends(gnome-core) | ?reverse-recommends(gnome-core)'\naptitude unmarkauto '?reverse-depends(gnome-desktop-environment) | ?reverse-recommends(gnome-desktop-environment)'\n\nHowever, I think that this guy explains it better than i did:\nhttp://tanguy.ortolo.eu/blog/article8/uninstall-meta-package\nMore info about metapackages: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MetaPackages\n", "Q: Difference between \"Gtk+ theme\" and \"Current theme\" entries in Gnome Tweak Tool As you can see below, Adwaita is selected both as the Gtk+ theme, and the Current theme.\n\nWhat is the difference?

I'm using Ubuntu 12.10.\nGoing to Printers>Add, it is possible to identify the printer, set the drive option. In the end, when I ask to print the test page, it keeps connecting to printer and nothing happen. No error message, neither status modification.\nI have also tried to connect the printer by HPLIP using the USB cable. Nothing happen either.\nOn my wife windows, the printer runs ok!\nI have already investigated around the Internet, but nothing helped me. Any suggestion is appreciated!\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: open \"Printers\" at the system dropdown menu, right click the icon that corresponds to your HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3516 printer, select \"properties\", at the \"Manufacturer and Model\" box click at the \"Change\" button, let it search for the printer driver, when the manufacturers list shows up, select \"HP\", when the models list shows up, select the following model:\nDeskjet Ink Adv 2010 k010, hpcups 3.12.2\nConfirm the selection and finish the configurations, allowing to copy the fresh PPD (losing your previous configurations).\nThis will work properly.\nRegards.\n\nA: Have you tried using the hplip-gui? It is absolutely great, especially for hp printers. The package is available on the standard repos and is one apt-get install away.\n", "Q: Most important commands to know? Got myself into trouble today - put rhythm box into party mode and I could get it back.  \nSo I was stuck.\nI hit ctrl alt del thinking that something like task manager would come up so I could kill rhythm box.  Nothing happened so I started hitting all kinds of keys.\nFinally I hit ctrl alt fn1 and that got me to a cmd line (I now know that I opened up one of six available 'consoles').\nI typed quit - not recognized.\nexit - not recognized.\nmore words - not recognized.\nFinally, I typed reboot - needs root.  So I did sudo reboot and the box rebooted - everything was OK.\nMy question is - the next time that I am 'in trouble' - the machine won't respond for whatever reason - and I decide to open up a console, what are the 5 to 10 most important commands that I should learn in order to get myself 'out of trouble?'\nI am using raring.\n\nA: Generally the first thing I do in situations like that is checking ctrl+alt+t. If it works I can just type xkill and choose the application that causes trouble. If I cannot click it I use killall <name of application>, but it does not always work. Sometimes I need to first get the process number by ps x | grep <at least partial name of application> or search it manually after typing ps x. When I got it I just type kill <process number>.\nIf killing the application does not help I try to restart Unity - or Compiz - by unity --replace or compiz --replace.\nIn situations when I cannot do that this way, because it's impossible to access Terminal in GUI mode, I use one of the ctrl+alt+f consoles and try to kill process from there - it's all the same I described before.\nWhen it appears that I need to restart unity, the first thing needed is to change the 'DISPLAY' variable by DISPLAY=:0. After that I can just type unity --replace.\nIf all that does not help I just log out. To do that I kill 'gnome-session' process. I could search for it and then kill, but it's easier to just type the following.\nkill -9 -1\n\n-9 stands for a specific signal to kill a process and -1 means kind of 'infinity' so it basically kills everything it can.\nLast thing is sudo shutdown 0 which obviously shutdowns the computer. Of course You can also use sudo reboot.\nIt should be enough. Anyway I recommend You to read some bash tutorial. It can be generally really helpful.\nHope that will help.\n", "Q: How To Debug and Fix PPTP/VPN Client Connection I am asking a question, which has two sub-questions.

And after a short while the login screen is restored. Any further attempts result in a similar cycle as before. This is happening inside VMWare virtual machines. I had restored a partition from a clonezilla image to this (virtual) system. The source for the clonezilla image was a similar virtual system (which is in perfect condition) which only has one partition for everything. I can however login from the virtual terminals (tty) though, and also seem to have access to all my files. I also don't get any error messages when I try to login from the virtual terminals. Also restarting the lightdm service hasn't helped either. There don't seem to be any problematic lines in my .bashrc.\nI am running Ubuntu 12.04.02 64-bit. \n\nA: I had this problem once, I resolved it by fixing my /etc/fstab file which had incorrectly set my /home drive. But as you mentioned, it's a single partition. I also once resolved it by reinstalling the ubuntu-desktop package.\nThis issue is fairly wide-spread throughout the Ubuntu community. There are several other users who have had this issue and the various resolutions seem to point towards some sort of issue with either the graphics card drivers, Unity, or Compiz. \nA point of confusion however is the difference between blank screen and black screen.\nHere's a \"blank\" screen problem:\nIn this scenario, a user has a problem similar to the one you described: A blank screen when they attempt to login. This is different however due to the fact that they are using a physical computer as opposed to a virtual machine and also because they are not returned to the login prompt after a short delay.\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1982094\nThe problem was resolved when the user reinstalled Ubuntu without checking the \"Install third-party proprietary software\" box at install, preventing the Nvidia drivers from being installed.\nHere's another blank screen error. This one is a bit more similar to your problem since it's a virtual machine.\nThe problem that the asker had was that after installing 12.10, when they attempted to login it would go straight to a blank screen:\nUbuntu 12.10 desktop/interface not showing on VirtualBox VM after login screen\nIt was apparently resolved by using Gnome Classic. \nWhat I actually suggest you do first is that you install or update the VMware Tools. \nhttp://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&cmd=displayKC&externalId=1022525\nThis site provides instructions on how to install VMware tools on an Ubuntu virtual machine.\nIf that doesn't work, I would suggest is that you try reinstalling Compiz. \nHow can I remove and re-install Unity?\nThis worked for me, so I hope it will work for you as well. I've heard this can be caused by a great number of issues, so I sincerely wish you the best of luck.\n\nA: I just now had the same problem when I created a new VM with Ubuntu 12.04.5 (VMware), but I knew it was nothing hardware related because I had another VM with Ubuntu 12.04.5 (installed from Ubuntu 12.04.4 to 12.04.5), which worked perfectly fine. So by trying random things, this worked:\nSolution: \n\n\n*\n\n*Start Ubuntu until log-in screen.\n\n*Before log-in, click on the Ubuntu logo button on the right side of your name.\n\n*Select Ubuntu 2D\n\n*Log in and successfully don't see a black screen\n\n\nReproducible\nIf you, after fix, again click on the Ubuntu logo before log-in and select Ubuntu (instead of Ubuntu 2D), the black screen is back.\n\nA: This one worked for me (Source):\nOpen a text console by pressing Ctrl+Alt+F1 and then log in into text mode and enter these commands:\nsudo dpkg --configure -a\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade -y\nsudo reboot\n\nAs explained in the original source, this problem happens because of an update which installed incorrectly and broke the graphical desktop environment. The sudo dpkg --configure -a configures all unpacked but unconfigured packages.\n\nA: I have had the same problem when I installed Ubuntu 12.04 on VMWare with Windows7 host. The login screen appeared and the after entering the password, nothing appeared on the screen. After a little search I found that \"Virtualizartion Technology\" is disabled under my BIOS. If you have bought your notebook with pre-installed windows, you are likely having the same problem. \nYou can enable the Virtualization Technology from the BIOS set up menu at the start up. Once enabled Ubuntu will work fine. \nTO enable: Restart your system, press ESCAPE key to enter the start up menu. Press F10 to enter BIOS set up menu. In the system configuration, you will find the Virtualization technology disabled by default.

(xinput_calibrator will only determine calibration values but not apply them at all.)\n\n*If the values are fine, put the command into your ~/.profile or (to apply it system-wide) into a new shell script file in /etc/profile.d/.\nDetails. This rather complex process is because I encountered two problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*The xorg.conf.d snippets created by xinput_calibrator did not have any effect for me. I did not investigate, but the reason might be that it prints the wrong option names.

There are three possibilities left:update-notifier, aptd and evince.\nOn the command line for those 3 possibilities\nman name_of_the_process\n\nor\ninfo name_of_the_process\n\nor\nname_of_the_process -h \n\nReplace name_of_the_process by the real process name. \nIn this case if we type \nevince -h \n\nwe get:\n\nSo evince is the GNOME Document Viewer we were looking for.\n\nA: Frank's answer should work for you. I'll add that for locating application processes I like the pstree command better than the flat list ps gives. (Technically, the very capable ps command can be used to print a tree.) But here's an alternate approach.\nYou should be able to find the mapping between an application's executable file name and its GUI name in its .desktop file, and these are scattered around your system in several directories. In a terminal try this\ngrep -l \"Categories=.*Settings\" /usr/share/applications/*.desktop\n\nto list the primary system .desktop files describing applications shown in settings dialogs.\ngrep -l \"Categories=.*Settings\" /usr/share/applications/*.desktop | grep -i sound\n\npares that list to only files containing the name \"sound\". The program you're looking for will belong to one of the listed .desktop files, with any luck. They are text files. The \"Name=\" line gives the GUI name. You're interested in the \"Exec=\" line, which names the executable file. This line then may even flat-out work:\ngrep -l \"Categories=.*Settings\" /usr/share/applications/*.desktop | grep -i sound | xargs grep -e Name= -e Exec=\n\nEven if that doesn't work, the information you want is almost certainly in the Exec line of some .desktop file somewhere, probably in /usr/share/applications, likely in a file with \"sound\" in the name. Sorry I can't just give you the program name. I don't have a Unity desktop in front of me.\n\nA: Desktop applications are started through a *.desktop file. so, if you do locate --regex '.desktop$' you'll get a list of all the '*.desktop' files on your system. Since they're usually short files, it's easy to find the \"EXEC=\" line.\n\nA: xprop | grep PID then click on the window. This gives you it's PID, as mentioned at: Tell a process PID by it's window?\nNow just ps aux | grep <PID>.\n\nA: When you cannot figure out the name of process from the list (I had this issue with document viewer ) you can do the following to narrow down the list of suspects\nBefore running application\nps -e | awk  '{print $4}' > before.txt\n\nrun application (e.g. document viewer)\nps -e | awk  '{print $4}' > after.txt\n\nThe diff will tell you which process(es) started. \ndiff before.txt after.txt | grep \">\"\n\n\nA: Thanks to the above answers I was able to find the executable evince\n\nIf you look under the\nHelp -> Advanced -> The Command Line\n\nyou can find the following:\nThe command line\n\n    To start the Document Viewer from the command line, type evince. You can open a specific file by typing the filename after the evince command:\n\n      evince file.pdf\n\n    You can open multiple files by typing the filenames after the evince command, separating the filenames by a space:\n\n      evince file1.pdf file2.pdf\n\n    The document viewer also supports the handling of files on the web. For example, after the evince command you can give the location of a file on the web:\n\n      evince http://www.claymath.org/millennium/P_vs_NP/pvsnp.pdf\n\n    Opening a document at a specific page\n\n    You can use the --page-label switch to open a document at a specific page. For example, to open a document to page 3, you would type:\n\n      evince --page-label=3 file.pdf\n\n    The page label should be in the same format as the page number displayed in the Document Viewer header bar.\n\n    Opening a document in fullscreen mode\n\n      evince --fullscreen file.pdf\n\n    Opening a document in presentation mode\n\n      evince --presentation file.pdf\n\n    Opening a document in preview mode\n\n      evince --preview file.pdf\n\n", "Q: How to set Quodlibet as default music player? I am interested in having Quodlibet show up in the \"Default Applications\" menu in System Settings > Details, how can I do this?\n\nA: To make any music player that comes with sound indicator integration the default player in there we may from 13.04 install and run unity-tweak-tool . Open the \"Panel\" settings and choose any of installed players:\n\nThe example above will then make Guayadeque the default player in the sound indicator:\n\nOf course if we prefer not to install an additional application, or if a player such as Quod Libet does not come with full indicator sound integration we can also do this with dconf-editor (from dconf-tools  in Ubuntu < 13.04):\n\nQuod Libet need the MPRIS plugin (quodlibet-plugins ) for full player control.\n\nA: Oh well, read about and found it: just make sure you reference quodlibet.desktop in your mimeapps.list file (local copy at ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list). \nYou can set it default right away just by having the following line in the mentioned file: audio/x-vorbis+ogg=quodlibet.desktop.\n", "Q: What do I do about the \"haziness when booting up Ubuntu?\" I have installed Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, the Windows Installer method, and when I restarted and booted up Ubuntu, it was static and hazy.

I am not tech savvy when it comes to computers, so I have no idea how to find out my graphics card model number or even change it. I have an HP Pavilion Dv2000 laptop with Windows 7 installed. Hopefully someone can help me.\n\nA: If it's hardware than you need to order a new graphics card, find the exact make and model of your laptop for this, you can do it on a terminal, or a google search, or on the laptop itself on the sticker on the bottom. Than find the exact card you need. If you feel you can't do it yourself i'd suggest bringing it to someone who does that for a living :P\n\nA: I'm experimenting with the driver for graphic card but it's worth the risk. Sometime it will work but sometimes it might not work. Worst you could see just blackout or reinstalling Ubuntu. If success, all your graphic card features will be available.\nTry install other version of graphic card driver from the System Settings > Software and Updates.\n\nHope it help.\n", "Q: Windows 8 doesn't boot after installing Ubuntu (UEFI) I installed Ubuntu with my UEFI installation of Windows 8 (with windows 7 boot-loader because I don't know how to recover it), and after grub installed, I was no longer able to boot Windows 8.\nI tried with several different tutorials, which resulted in the two menu entries called 'Windows 7' that you'll see in the pastebin output. \nI also disabled fastBoot.

It did not ask me the size of swap. I am currently using Ubuntu and have only about 200 MB and my system crashes when I open too many applications.\n\nA: First of all, swap should be equal 2x physical RAM for up to 2 GB of physical RAM, and then an additional 1x physical RAM for any amount above 2 GB, but never less than 32 MB.\nFor adding swap space, you have three options: create a new swap partition, create a new swap file, or extend swap on an existing LVM logical volume. It is recommended that you extend an existing logical volume.\nCreating a logical volume for swap\nTo add a swap volume group (assuming /dev/VolGroup00/LogVol02 is the swap volume you want to add):\n\n\n*\n\n*At a terminal with root privileges (sudo -s), create the logical volume of size 1024 MB (for example):\nlvm lvcreate VolGroup00 -n LogVol02 -L 1024M\n\n*Format the new swap space:\nmkswap /dev/VolGroup00/LogVol02\n\n*Add the following entry to the /etc/fstab file:\n/dev/VolGroup00/LogVol02 swap swap defaults 0 0\n\n*Enable the extended logical volume:\nswapon -va\n\n*Test that the logical volume has been extended properly: cat /proc/swaps or free.\nCreating a swap file\nTo add a swap file:\n\n\n*\n\n*Determine the size of the new swap file in megabytes and multiply by 1024 to determine the number of blocks. For example, the block size of a 512 MB swap file is 65536.\n\n*At a terminal with root privileges (sudo -s), type the following command with count being equal to the desired block size:\ndd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1024 count=524288\n\n*Setup the swap file with the command:\nmkswap /swapfile\n\n*To enable the swap file immediately but not automatically at boot time:\nswapon /swapfile\n\n*To enable it at boot time, edit /etc/fstab to include the following entry:\n/swapfile swap swap defaults 0 0\nThe next time the system boots, it enables the new swap file.\n\n*After adding the new swap file and enabling it, verify it is enabled by viewing the output of the command cat /proc/swaps or free.\nExtending swap on a logical volume\nTo extend a swap logical volume (assuming /dev/VolGroup00/LogVol01 is the volume you want to extend):\n\n\n*\n\n*At a terminal with root privileges (sudo -s), disable swapping for the associated logical volume:\nswapoff -v /dev/VolGroup00/LogVol01\n\n*Resize the LVM logical volume by 1024 MB (for example):\nlvm lvresize /dev/VolGroup00/LogVol01 -L +1024M\n\n*Format the new swap space:\nmkswap /dev/VolGroup00/LogVol01\n\n*Enable the extended logical volume:\nswapon -va\n\n*Test that the logical volume has been extended properly: cat /proc/swaps or free.\nSource: http://www.centos.org/docs/5/html/5.1/Deployment_Guide/s1-swap-what-is.html\n\nA: Instead of increasing the current swap area, you can just add a new one (here 1 GiB):\ndd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile1 bs=1M count=1024\nchmod 600 /swapfile1\nmkswap /swapfile1\necho \"/swapfile1  swap  swap defaults 0 0\" >> /etc/fstab\nswapon /swapfile1\n\n", "Q: Connect to WiFi network through Ubuntu terminal I am using my WiFi network adapter on the laptop to connect to the internet on Ubuntu 10.04.\nI have tried the following steps and got the below messages on the Ubuntu terminal.\nPlease let me know what has gone wrong.\nThank you.\nI have used the following instructions I have seen on a web page.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the terminal.\n\n*Type ifconfig wlan0 and press Enter.

It contained «Synaptic Package Manager» which is a great tool for installing and managing software. Currently, Ubuntu provides «Software Center» instead, but you still can use it to install Synaptic and then use Synaptic to install anything else.\nI suppose, Ubuntu One can be removed (it is ubuntuone-client package in Synaptic), but be careful not to remove something important together with it. Synaptic always shows a warning when removing a package requires removing other packages, read it carefully in order to make sure that there is nothing important there. If there is, it's better not to remove Ubuntu One.\n\nWhat is this \"system\"? System sounds important.\n\nIn Linux, most software is installed not only for current user but system-wide, so installing, removing and updating software requires administration privileges (also known as root privileges).

Bottom: actual output.\nI don't mind flattening the image, loosing editing capabilities and whatnot in the process, since I still have the original .svg, but I can't find any options for it anyway. I'd rather avoid exporting to a rasterized format, because I want to be able to use it for printing on large paper.\nWhen searching for solutions to this, among other things I found this thread, originally from 2006, in which the most recent answer is from 2012 and reads\n\n6 years later..\n  same problem.\n  Inkscape can't export to pdf level opacity.\n  So sad.\n\nIs there really no way to do this?\n\nA: You should upgrade your Inkscape to the PPA version Pre-0.49, my testing produced results using masking, clipping and a reference path difference:\n\nTo upgrade your inkscape, open up a terminal and issue the following commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:inkscape.dev/trunk\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install inkscape-trunk\n\nThis should remove the 0.48 version of inkscape and replace it with the pre-0.49 version you need for your pdf file.\n\nA: You might also try converting your inkscape .svg file to .pdf\nusing rsvg-convert from the librsvg2-bin package:  \nrsvg-convert -f pdf -o foo.pdf foo.svg\n\nThis preserved transparency in my file.\n\nA: Okay, here's my two cents on a workaround for this.\nI tried the previous answer using rsvg-convert, which worked fine for transparent items. Problem is now, I have an embedded image in my SVG that actually got rasterized with a very low resolution.\nSpecifying a higher X/Y dpi for rsvg-convert didn't change that.\nSo I did the following, which resolved the issue:\n\n\n*\n\n*\"Rasterizing\" the image into a PDF: rsvg-convert -f pdf -o rasterized.pdf orig.svg\n\n*Open the original image in Inkscape: inkscape orig.svg\n\n*Open the rasterized image (now containing transparent shapes, but also the rasterized embedded image) in Inkscape: inkscape rasterized.pdf\n\n*Ungroup all items in the latter until you get to the wrongly rasterized image\n\n*Copy the embedded image from 2. into the one from 4., replacing the wrongly rasterized one\n\n*Save it as PDF through Inkscape normally.\n\n\nResult: Transparent shapes, and high-resolution images.\n\nA: One solution I have found to solve this obvious bug, is:\nIn Inkscape save as: EPS\nthen epstopdf the file.

I had heard that after upgrading to 13.04 everything would work natively, however this has not been the case. After plugging in my phone all that happens is I get a file system screen with windows driver install files (.exe's and all that jazz). If I switch it to ptp mode it recognizes it as a camera, but still no luck with MTP. Has anyone gotten a droid razr maxx hd to connect successfully with their 13.04 installation? If so, some help would be much appreciated. Thanks!\n\nA: I was actually able to get this to work today.  First, be sure that you have the following line in your the files\n/etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules \nand\n/etc/udev/rules.d/52-mtp.rules\nSUBSYSTEM==\"usb\", ATTR{idVendor}==\"22b8\", MODE=\"0666\", GROUP=\"plugdev\"\nThen run\nsudo service udev restart\nOn your Droid, go to Settings => Developer options and enable USB debugging.\nPlug your phone in via USB cable, and it should work.  \n\nA: I tried several ways of mounting the phone as a device with only partial success.  I could get it to mount in Ubuntu to transfer pictures but not music.  I tried in Windows and ran into issues with drivers not properly installing.  Finally stumbled on the work-around:\nInstall google-musicmanager: \nsudo apt-get install google-musicmanager \nand start it from the terminal: \ngoogle-musicmanager \nChrome opens a new tab as a result. Then register for an account.  A \"standard\" account is free and permits you to store 20,000 of your songs in the Google cloud.  For $10/month you can store, I think, an unlimited amount of music as well as get music from Google.  \nOne of the options I chose was to automatically upload any new music put into my ~/Music folder to the cloud.  Right now it's busy doing the initial upload (uploads are slow) and will probably finish in the wee hours of the morning tomorrow.\nOn my new Droid Razr Maxx HD the Google Music player automatically syncs to the music in my cloud storage.  I'm letting all of that happen via WiFi so I don't get excess data charges.  And so the music gets transferred.\nI wish it was like my old phone.  That one appeared as a USB drive on the desktop when I plugged it in.  Then it was just drag and drop, unmount, and done.  Much simpler.  Oh well, the solution to the problem turned out to be free.\n", "Q: samsung 3401 - cant connect scanner i downloaded samsung linux driver for my scanner cum printer samsung 3401 and when i click on folder , click on cdroot click on auto run i get this error\"\n! /bin/sh\nBASE=dirname \"$0\"\nexec sh \"$BASE/Linux/install.sh\"                                        \"\nthe printer is working , the scanner is not cd provided with the machine is also not working   need help\nregards\numesh\n\nA: Right click on the AutoRun and click \"Properties\", click \"Permissions\" then check \"Execute: Allow executing file as a program\", then double click the autorun file again.\n\n", "Q: Wubi is downloading file but I have full ISO I have \"ubuntu-12.04.2-desktop-amd64.iso\" and my PC has Windows 8 installed.

It is a clean install into a clean /home folder. When I launch kmail the CPU usage of the virtuoso-t process increases by a huge amount.\nI have an i5 laptop and the usage of that process before kmail is launched is below 1% a few moments after kmail is launched the process usage shoots up to 150%+ (so atleast one and a half cores are being maxed by the virtuoso-t process...). If this settled after a few hours it would be ok, but it doesn't seem to settle down and there is no clear way of seeing what is being done or if it is only a zombied thread inside virtuoso.\nBeing a laptop this of course completely destroys battery life. The sad thing is that I mainly use the laptop for email (due to it being mobile) while on the road and as such needs the auto complete of contact's email address and the semantic features.\nIs there a way to determine if this process is indeed zombified and looping or if it is actually indexing the email. But what confuses me is why would nepomuk only want to index emails when kmail is open? Surely it has access to the local email headers in the same way kmail has?\n\nA: Disable email indexing. I had the same issue and went away when I disabled email indexing. My guess is that if you have a lot of emails (e.g. Gmail with lots of email archived in \"All Mail\") it takes a long time to index their contents.\nTo disable this, go to Nepomuk Server Configuration and uncheck \"Enable Email Indexer\" under Email Indexing.\n\nA: I have noticed the same on my ASUS K72F laptop while absolutely no such trouble on i7 desktop PC I use as well.

Works best if you put it into a shell script, which is run when KDE starts - something like:\ncpulimit -b -e virtuoso-t -l 10\n\n(where 10 indicates program is restricted to 10% of cpu usage, use whatever percentage you are comfortable with).\n", "Q: How can I update LibreOffice to 4.0.3?

After a series of break-in attempts, I generated new random passwords for all the users on my Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS server running Virtualmin and then, as root, used chpasswd to change their passwords.  I had a couple of user names wrong, and chpasswd detected this and correctly reported the lines with the wrong names, which I corrected.\nThen I started to get feedback from the users that their passwords weren't changed...\nWell, it seems that chpasswd doesn't seem to have done anything at all - but neither has it reported any sort of error, either on the command line or in any log that I found.\npasswd does change passwords - but unfortunately passwd on Ubuntu doesn't seem to accept the --stdin option, so I'd have to do all the password changes by hand one at a time - for almost a hundred accounts.  (And I might want to do this again at some point...)\nIs chpasswd simply broken, or is there some way I can make it work?  Or, is there some substitute for it?\nAnd - should I be reporting a feature deficiency somewhere?  I don't believe that \"failing silently\" is a good result.  Perhaps there's something on my system (which uses Virtualmin for domain management but is otherwise quite vanilla) that prevents it from working - but if so, chpasswd should be able to detect this and at least say that it failed to act.\nBut passwd works perfectly well, so it's clearly possible to change passwords from the command line...  One way or the other, it seems like an objective feature deficiency (\"bug\") to me - should I report it, and if so, where?\nUpdate:  stranger yet - some users are reporting their passwords are changed, and some are reporting they aren't.  One user who has two accounts has one password changed, one not.  I ran through the file again, checking that all the accounts were there, and then ran it through chpasswd again... same results!\nI'm baffled.  Ideas?\nUPDATE:  Here's the command line I'm now using:\ncat passwords.txt | chpasswd\n\nIf I use -S - I see no output - nothing at all!  So it seems to be getting nothing... but if I just cat the file:\ncat passwords.txt\n\nI get:\n    user:password\n    user2:hunter2\n    [... etc ...]\nMore: If I change the first line to be NONuser (an invalid user), I get a perfectly good error:\nchpasswd: (user NONuser) pam_chauthtok() failed, error:\nAuthentication token manipulation error\nchpasswd: (line 1, user NONuser) password not changed\n\nSo it is in fact reading and processing the file, at least as far as detecting non-users!\nOh, and $? is 0.\n\nA: I did a lot of systematic testing here, and I no longer think this is an issue with chpasswd.  \nInstead, it's something to do with ftp - for some reason, ftp still had the OLD passwords, but ssh and all other secure protocols had the new ones.\nI fixed it by turning off FTP.  :-D  I was intending to do that anyway, but I'd accidentally stopped the daemon rather than turned it off permanently (my mistake in using the Virtualmin front end).\nMy theory - it's an issue with either ProFTPd or Virtualmin - but I am out of time to investigate further.

A set of packages, some applications, etc. It will install next to any other desktop environment you have installed (e.g. Unity). Kubuntu is just Ubuntu without Unity (by default), but that comes with KDE preselected. Installing Ubuntu, then installing KDE (kubuntu metapackages) and uninstalling Unity (not required) will make it Kubuntu effectively.\n\n*Ubuntu in dual boot or not, it's just Ubuntu. You can install any package in that installation, it really does not matter if there's a Windows installation on another partition/disk somewhere.\n\n*Grub is a bootloader.

When plugging it in via USB, it's immediately recognized and shows up as a new device in the audio settings. Playback works mostly fine as well (except for some minor volume-related issues, which are beyond the scope of this question).\nHowever, when trying to test the 24 bit/96 kHz playback by playing such an audio file with mplayer, I encountered a small issue:\nOpening audio decoder: [pcm] Uncompressed PCM audio decoder\nAUDIO: 96000 Hz, 2 ch, s24le, 4608.0 kbit/100.00% (ratio: 576000->576000)\nSelected audio codec: [pcm] afm: pcm (Uncompressed PCM)\n==========================================================================\nAO: [pulse] 96000Hz 2ch s16le (2 bytes per sample)\n\nAs can be seen from the output, even though the played file does contain 24 bit/96 kHz audio, it's resampled to 16 bit before playback. Playing the same file with aplay shows the reason:\nPlaying WAVE 'sr003-02-2496.wav' : Signed 24 bit Little Endian in 3bytes, Rate 96000 Hz, Stereo\naplay: set_params:1081: Sample format non available\nAvailable formats:\n- U8\n- S16_LE\n- S16_BE\n- S32_LE\n- S32_BE\n- FLOAT_LE\n- FLOAT_BE\n- MU_LAW\n- A_LAW\n\nHowever, /proc/asound/card1/stream0 confirms that the hardware does support 24 bit:\nFiiO FiiO USB DAC-E17 at usb-0000:00:1a.0-1.1, full speed : USB Audio\n\nPlayback:\n  Status: Running\n    Interface = 3\n    Altset = 1\n    Packet Size = 388\n    Momentary freq = 44100 Hz (0x2c.199a)\n  Interface 3\n    Altset 1\n    Format: S16_LE\n    Channels: 2\n    Endpoint: 3 OUT (ADAPTIVE)\n    Rates: 32000, 44100, 48000, 96000\n  Interface 3\n    Altset 2\n    Format: S24_3LE\n    Channels: 2\n    Endpoint: 3 OUT (ADAPTIVE)\n    Rates: 32000, 44100, 48000, 96000\n\nAt this point I noticed that in the hardware tab of the sound settings, I can select two different profiles for the sound card: Digital Stereo (IEC958) and Analog Stereo. Switching between these two doesn't result in any changes though, as far as I can tell.\nSpecifying the ALSA device does help though (that is, aplay -Dhw:1,0 sr003-02-2496.wav works just fine and plays the file without resampling). But since Pulseaudio only shows one Fiio device/sink in the sound settings, I'm not sure how I'd tell Pulseaudio to use ALSA device hw:1,0. Adding load-module module-alsa-source device=hw:1,0 to /etc/pulse/default.pa results in Pulseaudio aborting with module.c: Failed to load module \"module-alsa-source\" (argument: \"device=hw:1,0\"): initialization failed. during startup.\nSo, that's the introduction, here's my actual questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I figure out which ALSA device Pulseaudio actually uses when I select the Fiio E17 in the sound settings?\n\n*How do I tell Pulseaudio to use ALSA device hw:1,0 when selecting the Fiio E17 in my sound settings?\n\n\nSome more (hopefully helpful) debug information:\n\n\n*\n\n*The output of aplay -L\n\n*The output of aplay -l\n\n*The output of pacmd list-sinks\n\n*And finally, in case it's relevant, my .asoundrc\n\nA: Answering the two questions:\nYou can select the default device in PulseAudio with a GUI like the GNOME volume control, pavucontrol, or from the command line using pacmd set-default-sink.\nBy default, PulseAudio opens devices for 44.1 kHz or 48 kHz, whichever leads to lower resampling effort (so 96 kHz audio would usually lead to the device being opened at 48 kHz. Also, we open the devices for S16LE by default.\nNow, you have two options. If you just want to play a few files at their native format, paplay --passthrough <file> should do the job for you. You can even specify which device to use.\nThe other option is to globally make PA use 96/24. You can change that in /etc/pulse/default.conf (alternate-sample-rate = 96000, default-sample-format=s24-32le). This will lead to greater CPU usage, though. This is a bit of a silly situation, having to apply global configuration for all devices. We're planning to add per-device configuration at some point.\nNote, after this, you should just use mplayer's PulseAudio backend rather than have mplayer talk to ALSA and then ALSA to PulseAudio. You can do that with mplayer -ao pulse ... and if you want to set it up permanently, add ao=pulse to ~/.mplayer/config.\n\nA: After the update to 13.10 Pulseaudio defaulted to HDMI, probably because I have an extra monitor attached to my laptop (Lenovo T430S) thru my mini-display port. The archlinux website provided a sweet and short answer to reset or set the default: \n\n\n*\n\n*login and change the default output to analog\n\n*Run\n$ aplay -l\nand find that analog is card 0\n\n\n*\n\n*Run\n$ pacmd list\nand find the line:\nactive profile: <output:analog-stereo+input:analog-stereo>\n\n\"output:analog-stereo+input:analog-stereo\"  is my profile name,  so add\nset-card-profile 0 output:analog-stereo+input:analog-stereo\n\nin /etc/pulse/default.pa and save\n\n\n*\n\n*restart pulseaudio \n\n\nA: The sample format used in the interface between applications and PulseAudio is not always directly related with the sample format that PulseAudio uses to access the hardware device.\nS24_3LE is not one of PulseAudio's supported application formats (as shown in the aplay output).\nTo allow applications with such unusual formats to run with PulseAudio, add a plugin that does automatic format conversion if need for the default PCM device in your .asoundrc:\npcm.!default {\n    type linear\n    slave.pcm pulse\n}\n\n\nA: Just a quick workaround I found out using Lubuntu Trusty Tahr with my Fiio E17 connected via USB:\nI was also wondering about the bitrate, that's why i found this posts here. But since I listen to music on a rather old Netbook, I did not want to set it to 96/24 by default (cpu is not the fastest)\nHowever, what worked for me was to use VLC, and specify in the expert audio settings to use the ALSA module for output, and then use the following output device:\n\"Fiio USB DAC-E17, USB Audio Direct hardware device without any conversions\"\nThis way, i was able to output 96/24 sound to the Fiio over USB when I wanted (also shows on the little screen of the Fiio) - and i did not have to change something more fundamental in the OS. Players like audacious or the browsers still use the default pulseaudio output.\nSometimes VLC says that the device is already being used - then just close any other software like audacious, that is using e.g. the pulseaudio output, and it should work.\nregards,\nAndi\n\nA: Adding load-module module-alsa-source device=hw:1,0 to /etc/pulse/default.pa is the correct approach. However, the following modules have to be unloaded to avoid device conflicts (the initialization failed error you got):\n\n\n*\n\n*module-udev-detect\n\n*module-detect\n\n\nTake a careful look of your /etc/pulse/default.pa and remove lines contain those modules. Also, in this case devices cannot be automatically detected, so you want to load module-alsa-sink to specify a sink manually as well.\n\nA: Here's the correct answer to this question:\nFrom ArchWiki\nDetermine the ALSA hw device you want to use.\nThen add this to your default.pa file. (Change 0,0 to suit your device.)\nload-module module-alsa-sink device=hw:0,0\n\n", "Q: More up to date vim repo The vim I currently have installed is version 7.3.547, however I need at least version 7.3.584.

Because translation can be secondary priority and if InRelease file can't be found, it uses other method for authentication like using Release and Release.gpg pair.\n\n*Hit means apt needed to download a Release file or InRelease file (because somehow it got deleted) and once it is downloaded, it checked the checksum of the Index file in it and found that the checksum mentioned there matches the checksum of the Package file already downloaded that is in /var/lib/apt/lists.

Recovering from a terrible attempt to install Ubuntu 13.04, I stumbled upon Xubuntu 13.04. I love it, and so far I have absolutely no complains about it.

I thought that updating wine would fix the problem but after upgrading to 1.5 I see no difference - the same error occurs over and over again:\nhttp://pastebin.com/rRXsP6EA\nI think I've always had similar problems with wine. However, I decided to do some research and a person from another forum claimed that his inability to execute files from partitions with wine was due to a 'users' option in /etc/fstab. I currently have 1 ntfs partition for Windows, 1 ext4 for Xubuntu, 1 ext2 and 6 ntfs for file storage and 1 swap partition. All my file storage partitions were configured with a 'users' option and I removed it. On the positive side, all my executable files would actually execute without an error from every partition I tried. On the negative side, however, I'm not able to see any of my partitions in the Places Menu. They are mounted from /dev/sdaX to /media/sdaX but my Places menu doesn't show them. It shows only my Xubuntu and Windows partitions.\nSo far I've tried altering the fstab options for my ext2 and ntfs partitions a bit by adding a uid and umask and putting ntfs-3g instead of only ntfs but it's either no exes and visible drives or invisible drives and working exes (depending on whether the 'user' or 'users' option is added).\nIf there's any substitute to the xfce4-places-plugin which would certainly work with xfce4 and show my drives, gtk bookmarks and home folder, I'd be more than happy to use it.\nAny help is appreciated. Thank you in advance!\nEDIT: Just downgraded to 1.4.1 because some games and applications seemed blurry and this fixed it but the error still occurs.\n\nA: Well, I managed to fix this myself. It turned out that the 'users' option brought 'noexec' with itself and it was necessary to manually add the 'exec' option to the fstab partition entries.\nThis is an example of a line from /etc/fstab containing mounting a ntfs partition in order to allow executing:\n/dev/sdaX /media/sdaX ntfs-3g uid=username,umask=077,users,exec 0 0\n\nWhere X is the number of the partition and username is your username.\nThe exec option MUST be after users, otherwise it won't work and will mount the partition with a noexec option.\n", "Q: Disable the confirmation of shutdown I have upgraded to 13.04 and now when I click on to the setting -. shut-down the is this stupid bar across asking if i want to shut-down, restart etc.\nThis was disables in all my previous versions, via gconf-editor and Tweak.\nI have tried the terminal commands that are posted on the web and all the other information posted.\nCan someone tell me how to remove this stupid Microsoft feature, when i cl lick ok to the shut-down button, I want to shut-down otherwise I would have pressed the restart or suspend button.\nCheers \nPaul\n\nA: Make an executable bash script on your desktop:\ntouch ~/Desktop/shutdown.sh; chmod +x shutdown.sh\n\nThen, open the file, and paste the following inside:\n#!/bin/bash\n\ngksu shutdown now\n\nAnd, then, whenever you want to shutdown, just execute the file. :)\nUPDATE: Try this instead:\nChange [password] to your password, and then save this into a file shutdown.desktop\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Shutdown\nExec=echo [password] | sudo -S shutdown now\nType=Application\nStartupNotify=true\nPath=/  \n\nNow, double-click to shutdown.

If you load the driver b44:\nsudo modprobe b44\n\nI suspect your ethernet will come to life.

I would like to get rid of that first password and as it turned out I will have to revert the encryption of the hard drive. Can that be done?\n\nA: While my solution won't remove the disk encryption (I'm pretty sure you have to do a block copy of your unencrypted version over your encrypted disk to do that), you can make your system decrypt itself at boot time.\nThe process documented in \nHow to configure LVM & LUKS to autodecrypt partition? should be of use to work around this issue.

One is just baked into the uname utility and the other into the hostname utility.\nuname -n\nPrints the network node hostname or \"node name\".\nhostname\nWithout any arguments, prints the name of the system as returned by the gethostname() function.\nThe uname() function documentation includes the following information:\n\nNote that there is no standard that says that the hostname set by sethostname(2) is the same string as the nodename field of the struct returned by uname() (indeed, some systems allow a 256-byte hostname and an 8-byte nodename), but this is true on Linux. The same holds for setdomainname(2) and the domainname field.\n\n(Note that Linux's sethostname() limits hostnames to 64 bytes)\nFurther evidence that on GNU/Linux, they are exactly the same comes from the gethostname() function documentation:\n\nThe GNU C library does not employ the gethostname() system call; instead, it implements gethostname() as a library function that calls uname(2) and copies up to len bytes from the returned nodename field into name.\n\nBasically, hostname includes an internal call to uname.\n", "Q: Will any programs be removed from my current install if I switch to Ubuntu? I really want to switch from Windows 7 Home Premium to Ubuntu, but I need to know if my programs i currently have installed on my laptop will be removed. Thanks\n\nA: All your programs will be removed, just everything. Of course instead of deleting Windows completly, you can have both, Windows and Ubuntu, then your Windows' data will remain, although notice that Ubuntu and Windows are different Operational Systems (OSs).\nPrograms that run on Windows are made in its code, so when you get Ubuntu you will need programs for Ubuntu's code, some Windows applications are available for Ubuntu too, although many not, and for that cases there are \"equivalents\" in Ubuntu.\nYou should learn more about Ubuntu before installing it in its official webpage. Just a hint for you, in case your work depend on professional and specific features of tools like Autodesk, MS Office, Visual Basic, etc. You almost certainly will be doing a bad movement as you will need time to learn how to do the same work with the different Ubuntu's apps, and there are cases in which you may need very, very specific tools and features that may not be available in Ubuntu.\nLast but not least, I am not saying you: \"Hey, its bad turning to Ubuntu\"; the OS is great, although you need to confirm, before installing it, if you will be able to accomplish your tasks in the new environment. If you just use the PC for web, video, music, reading and common tasks, then I will say to you: Why haven't you tried Ubuntu yet?\n\nA: Windows will not be affected if you use the wubi installer. Put the Ubuntu live cd into your computer, and run wubi setup in windows. You will then have the computer dual booted, with Ubuntu. if you don't like Ubuntu, sinmply go into add and remove programs and uninstall Ubuntu from Windows.\n", "Q: Is it safe to install Virtual Box in Ubuntu?

You can contact Asus support at http://support.asus.com/ServiceHome.aspx?SLanguage=en\n", "Q: Any tool that displays CPU core utilization? I like the way System Monitor on Ubuntu displays the usage of different cores on the CPU. I write multi-threaded applications and it is useful for me to see how many cores are being occupied, for how long and with how much utilization. All of this information is neatly summarized by the CPU utilization in System Monitor.\nNow, the problem is System Monitor itself takes a lot of resources to run. For example, it takes 16-25% of a core when I'm running it.\nIs there an alternative to System Monitor that utilizes lesser CPU and has CPU visualization that shows utilization of all individual cores?\n\nA: if you are ok with using the terminal, htop is great.

Be it adding random characters to the start of the name or replacing the characters before .jpg\nThank you for your time and answers.\n\nA: #!/bin/bash    \nfor img in *.jpg; do\nnewname=$(head /dev/urandom | tr -dc a-z0-9 | head -c 8)\nmv \"$img\" \"$newname\".jpg\ndone\n\nThis will shuffle all jpg files to random names.\n\nA: I suppose the following could work. Assuming the prefix of your filenames is \"DSC\" you can use the following command in the terminal (untested!)\ncd /path/to/photos\nrename 's/DSC/'$RANDOM'/' *.jpg\n\nThis uses the perl rename command to match regular expressions and replace them. In this case, we are substituting \"DSC\" with a random number in the filename for all .jpg files. Change the \"DSC\" to whatever your photos' prefix is.\nanother method (also untested) is with a bash script:\n#!/bin/bash\nfor f in *.jpg; do\n  mv \"$f\" $RANDOM-\"$f\"\ndone\n\n\nA: Following one line script works for file names with white chars.\nfor f in *.jpg; do mv -n \"$f\" \"${f/*/$RANDOM.jpg}\"; done\n\n", "Q: Help installing Ubuntu 12.04.2 DVD in Windows 8 I downloaded the 12.04.2 Desktop amd64 ISO from the main website.

My question is how can I let friends access these features from an entirely separate location?\n\nA: This is a rather complicated problem. If you are at home (I assume you are), you will need to forward the ports from your router to the Ubuntu server. How to do this depends on your router, but you should look for \"Port Forwarding\" or similar. Secondly, you'll need to either have a static address for the external interface of your router or you'll need to register for a dynamic DNS service, of which there are many. Simply search for them and choose one that offers free service. You might also check your router to see if it natively supports one of these services.\nThat should be all you need to do.\n\nA: The answer by user21572 talks about port forwarding, which is a way to access local resources from outside a local network, but for Plex at least, that wouldn't necessarily be required if this option works for you:\nThe makers of Plex Media Server offer a service called myPlex which allows registered myPlex users to share their Plex Libraries with other registered myPlex users.

I decided to pick up a USB Wifi dongle, and I want to use my Ubuntu server as the bridge. I have the driver installed, and was following the guide for setting up NDISWrapper on the Ubuntu Community manual. When I run ndiswrapper -l:\nrt2870 : driver installed\n    device (0846:9012) present\n\n... So I assume that it is installed.

Variety is an autostart app, so it just started everytime I'm logging in. Variety has a function on_quit() and force_quit_thread() that are called when the app process stopped. So, I added my python script line inside, that execute my real script (normalize). When I tried to quit variety normally, it does what I want! I though, when the system log me out, any process that I started should also be stopped. But then, I realized, it is not. So, I couldn't use this way.\nThis let me thing to use another way to kill variety process manually when I logging out. I have tried ~/.bash_logout (I doubt it, because I know autostart does not run on bash); ~/etc/gdm/PostSession/Default (But, I'm not use gdm); ~/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf (This one doesn't work either!

I'm learning about ubuntu, but I do not know the ubuntu 13.04 Ram and CPU support up to how much??? hope you help me\n\nA: As far as maximum CPU support, I don't think it exists, but there might be a limit on the number of CPU's it can handle.\nIf you have more than 3 GB RAM in your computer, you don't have to pick 64-bit Ubuntu for making full use of your RAM.  The 32-bit Ubuntu automatically installs a PAE kernel. The kernel is the core of the operating system. A PAE kernel can address up to 64 GB of RAM.\nA PAE 32-bit kernel therefore isn't bothered by the 32-bit memory hole, which plagues old-fashioned 32-bit kernels.\nThe kernel used by the 32-bit Ubuntu can recognize up to 4GB of memory, although the amount of usable memory available to the user is slightly less than this. A kernel recompiled with PAE enabled can use up to 64GB of physical memory.\nThe kernel used by 64-bit Ubuntu can theoretically recognize up to 17.2 billion GB of physical memory, but this is subject in practice to hardware limitations. Current AMD64 implementations allow for up to 256TB of physical memory. Current Intel 64 implementations allow for up to 1TB of physical memory.\nOf course, you have to have a 64-bit architecture to use a 64-bit OS. But even if you don't have a 64-bit architecture, Linux can take advantage of your memory if you don't mind compiling your own kernel. \nJust to give an idea, I'm running Ubuntu 13.04 32bit on a machine with Core2Duo CPU, and 4GB RAM, and if you just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nsudo dmidecode -t 16\n\nit will show you the maximum amount of RAM that it can handle. (system Specific)\n\n\nA: One has to distinguish between what Ubuntu supports out of the box, and what it can support when one uses a custom kernel. \nThere are numerous features in the Linux kernel that can be tweaked at compile time. For the default, generic kernel, the Ubuntu developers choose values they think are appropriate.\nRegarding RAM, this means, that at least before 12.04 on a 32bit Ubuntu by default one could only use 4 GB of RAM, since in the generic kernel the PAE feature was disabled. Nevertheless, one can install a different kernel image (for instance linux-image-server) that allows to access as much RAM, as the (nominally 32bit, but usually 36bit big) address register of the CPU can handle (usually 64 GB). \nI don't know about 12.04 and newer (I use the 64bit version), but I assume that on those PAE is enabled, so it should support 64 GB if the CPU does (please, can anyone running 32bit Ubuntu check if PAE is enabled and post a comment?). Supposedly, on 64 bit one can use the whole 64bit address range, meaning 16 Exabytes.\nRegarding the number of CPUs, the Linux kernel can (at least on AMD64) handle up to 512 CPUs, yet in the generic kernel for Ubuntu (64 bits, 12.04) the maximum number of CPUs is configured 256.\nUbuntu installs the kernel configuration file in /boot/config-, so one can always look up the current settings there.\n\nA: The maximum ram supported for ubuntu 32 bit is 64gb(with the PAE kernel extension included with 12.04 and later). 64 bit Ubuntu, I think it's something along the lines of 1 tb (1024 gb). As for processors, I don't think there's an upper bound to what it can support in terms of power.  Just make sure you're using a common processor architecture such as i386 or amd64.  Since Ubuntu runs on high powered servers with extremely powerful processors and large amounts of ram, I cannot see the average user topping the limit. \n\nA: to my knowledge there are no limits, since Ubuntu is also used for large servers etc. and Linux in general runs supercomputers I think there should be no problem. If you have more that 4 gb of RAM you probably should choose the 64-bit version.\n\nA: The maximum CPU limit under Linux is 4000. The system will run with more than 4000 but, this will not guarantee the performance...yet.\n", "Q: Removing AppArmor I have MySQL installed in my development machine, where I just don't need any additional  security measure.\nI want to move MySQL Data files to another partition, which implies a lot of change in AppAmor config, that I don't want to do since it's too much work for a simple development machine and I really don't need it.\nMy question is: is it safe to remove AppArmor without any side-effects to the system?\nLike I said, security in this case is not really a concern.\n\nA: You can remove AppArmor without immediately killing the system. Nothing relies on it to function.\nBut it is there for a reason. If security really isn't a concern, that's fair enough, but if you're just doing it for a quick convenience, consider learning how to adapt the rules.\n\nA: It would not be safe to remove AppArmor in the sense of the word. You would be disabling a security system designed to be in place for protecting you. So it would indeed make you less safe. What you want to know is: yes you can remove it without side-effects but lessen that system's security with it.\nBut the changes to apparmor are quite minimal, if you just want to move the MySQL DataDir to another partition. In addition I would recommend moving it to /srv/mysql and mount your partition either to /srv or to /srv/mysql for that reason (depending if you have other services on that box you want to put into /srv).\nReason behind is, that ubuntu states the /srv mountpoint/directory the place for your own (custom) service data to be deployed (srv stands for service. Should contain server specific services related data. For example, /srv/cvs contains CVS related data.)\nThe changes to apparmor are quite minimalistic:\nvi /etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.mysqld and search for /var/lib/mysql and insert:\n  /var/lib/mysql/ r,\n  /var/lib/mysql/** rwk,\n  # new location of datadir\n  /srv/mysql/ r,\n  /srv/mysql/** rwk,\n\nThat is enough to satisfy apparmor and you can leave it in place without needing to fiddle around with uninstalling it.\nHope that helps!\n\nA: For your specific question replace $applicationname with mysqld\nThe best practice way to disable apparmor for a single application is\nsudo aa-complain $applicationname \nor\nsudo aa-complain /path/to/$applicationname. \nIf you install apparmor-utils you can use aa-cleanprof $applicationname to wipe the profile clean and it won't stop anything.\nKeep in mind that you can easily generate a profile while in development so that you know exactly what your application needs if you were to deploy it in production. \nYou can install apparmor-utils and use aa-cleanprof, aa-autodep $applicationname, aa-genprof $applicationname and aa-logprof to easily build a profile specific to your use of the application. \n", "Q: Windows compatible games on ubuntu 13.04 Chess Planet (ru) installed through wine on ubuntu 13.04. The desktop shortcut says invalid\nencoding.Double click does not open the game.\n\nA: Desktop shortcuts generally don't work in Wine. You probably need to open your Home Folder, then press Ctrl + H to view hidden files. Then go to .wine then drive_c then Program Files and choose the folder which Chess Planet is in (probably called Convekta) and find a button which looks like it launches the game. Double-click on it and the game should be working as good as it can in normal Wine.\nIf that doesn't work, you can increase your chances of success by grabbing PlayOnLinux, redownloading the ChessPlanet and clicking 'Install a program' and then 'Install a non-listed program' and following the instructions. It will then create a working (hopefully) link on the desktop as well as a link in the PlayOnLinux app menu.\n", "Q: dpkg won't update - input/output error in indicator-session I have been having an error trying to update my system.

Thanks for the reply.\n\nA: No, purging Nvidia driver from Ubuntu doesn't purge it from windows.  \nAlthough you are dual booting, Ubuntu and windows, they both are separate entities, in separate partitions.\n\nA: No. They separate drivers on separate systems, so when you purge the Nvidia drivers on Ubuntu it will leave windows drivers intact. \n", "Q: How to install the following theme on Ubuntu 13.04 I wanted to install the following theme (http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php?action=content&content=155582) and tried to do it like this (How can I install GTK themes on Ubuntu?), however, there's no .deb file in the archive for step 3.

When installing Ubuntu 12.10 and higher you get an option to encrypt the entire drive (not just the home directory). What encryption mechanism is used for this, and what kind of access permissions are supported?\n\nA: If you use full disk encryption, you have to enter your key once during boot to unlock your hard drive. It does not provide file access protection - once unlocked, any user (local or remote) has \"normal\" access. The use case for the full disk encryption is if your hard drive gets stolen or something, no one can access your system/data.\n\nA: The encryption mechanism:\n\nuses Cryptsetup's defaults with LUKS for AES in XTS_plain64 mode, a 256 bit key with SHA1 password hashing run through 1 second of PBKDF2, so the amount of iterations depends on your CPU strength. System (/ or 'root'), home and swap areas are all tucked into one encrypted logical volume. The boot partition must be separate in Linux FDE, no matter which configuration or distro and for most, it must also be unencrypted (exceptions: Arch and Gentoo) so /boot is open to attackers with physical access to the computer. Ubiquity makes an ext2 boot partition around 250 MB in size.  [Source - has a good overview]\n\nThe access permissions supported are basically \"locked\" and \"unlocked\"; anyone with a valid passphrase can unlock and read any file (assuming physical access = root access).\n", "Q: Run a shell script as another user that has no password I would like to run a script from the main ubuntu shell as a different user that has no password.\nI have full sudo privileges, so I tried this:\nsudo su -c \"Your command right here\" -s /bin/sh otheruser\n\nThen I have to enter my password, but I am not sure if that script is now really running under that user.\nHow can I confirm that the script is really running under that user now?\n\nA: Make sure you switch to root user with command sudo su and then use the command\nsu user -s <command>\n\nFor example: su www-data -s bin/magento cache:clean\n\nA: You can do that with su or sudo, no need for both.\nsudo -H -u otheruser bash -c 'echo \"I am $USER, with uid $UID\"' \n\nThe relevant parts of man sudo:\n-H   The -H (HOME) option requests that the security policy set\n     the HOME environment variable to the home directory of the\n     target user (root by default) as specified by the password\n     database.  Depending on the policy, this may be the default\n     behavior.\n\n(Starting from Ubuntu 19.10, -H is no longer needed as this is now the default behaviour. See: How does sudo handle $HOME differently since 19.10?)\n-u user     The -u (user) option causes sudo to run the specified\n      command as a user other than root.  To specify a uid\n      instead of a user name, use #uid.  When running commands as\n      a uid, many shells require that the '#' be escaped with a\n      backslash ('\\').  Security policies may restrict uids to\n      those listed in the password database.  The sudoers policy\n      allows uids that are not in the password database as long\n      as the targetpw option is not set.  Other security policies\n      may not support this.\n\nsu can only switch user without providing a password if you are root. See Caleb's answer\nYou can modify the /etc/pam.d/su file to allow su without password.

First, you need to modify the /etc/sudoers file to add a rule that allows the hudson user to become the other user for the script in question. Let's assume you have a user1 account that needs to run /usr/local/bin/my_script.sh.\nRun visudo to modify the sudoers file.\nThen, use the following sudo command to run the script from hudson.\nIt's very important that you use visudo to modify the sudoers file in order to check the file for errors before putting it in place.

Will it work in the similar manner as that in the case of booting seprately ubuntu from restart.\n\nA: I can not think of any reason why it wouldn't. Assuming that you can open VMware.\n\nA: Using Ubuntu through virtualisation software such as Virtualbox or VMware should provide reasonable protection to the host from any malware in the guest system provided you have are not sharing resources such as folders between the two systems.\nVMware, Virtualbox and similar products are an effective jail for the guest system so if the guest system becomes infected it's unlikely to be able to infect the host.\nThere is a theoretical risk but any malware would need to know that it was running on VMWare which was running on a Windows host.  I am not aware of any real world examples of such a threat however.\nIf your host operating system: Windows gets infected however this does not protect the guest OS Ubuntu.  Any malware in your Windows host is just as capable of trashing your Ubuntu guest as it is of trashing any other part of Windows.\nIf you are running Windows make sure it adequate protection whether host or guest OS.\nThere is a downside to virtualisation software however.  It will be slower than it would be if installed directly on the hardware but depending on what programs you use this may not matter to you.\n\nA: I'm running Ubuntu on VMWare as we speak.

Does anyone have a screen shot or something that might help me? Thanks in advance!\n\nA: For a RAID option during installation using Raring 13.04 media, your best bet is the minimal ISO, either 32-bit or 64-bit.  These ISO's are a text-based installer which will present you with the option for Software RAID during the install.  You must select the \"Manual\" partition option to be able to select Software RAID.\nKeep in mind that these ISO's require an active internet connection during the installation process.  The installer downloads many of the required packages including the desktop flavour of your choice and some additional add-on's, if chosen hence the term, \"minimal\".\nThe Software RAID option was to be included in Ubiquity for the Raring 13.04 desktop installer, but it is simply not there and there has been no notable news about this for the time being.\nThe minimal ISO links for Raring follow below,\nRaring Minimal 32-bit ISO\nRaring Minimal 64-bit ISO\n\nA: I'm not able to test these steps to be able to verify 100%.\nI think the way you can accomplish it, is by booting from the Ubuntu 13.04 DVD, or USB flash drive, and choosing try Ubuntu.  Once the desktop comes up, then just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nsudo -i\n\nThis saves you from having to type 'sudo' in front of every command.  Then, start 'cfdisk' with the device name of the first harddisk:\ncfdisk /dev/sda\n\nInstall mdadm and configure the RAID array.\nTo complete the setup, and for more information, and detailed steps click here or here. \nSource:ubuntu-software-raid\n", "Q: Windows 8 Legacy BIOS mode and Ubuntu 12.04 LTS dual boot I have fresh installed Windows 8 on my laptop and I want to dual boot it with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS(64 bit). \nMy BIOS Mode is Legacy.\nI want to know is their any issues with dual booting, I just want to know before preceding to install Ubuntu.\n\nA: I have had dual-boot setup before and I have never had a issue.

I am getting the error:\nNo operating system found\n\nCan someone help me to resolve this?\n\nA: You may have a similar VAIO to what I have. If you have a partial SSD, then your hard drive is setup as a FakeRAID 0 and Ubuntu doesn't support it. You'll have to fully wipe your hard drive and start over with whichever OS(s) you want. \nYou still have to disable Secure Boot and enable Legacy Boot, but once you have a hard drive in there that Ubuntu can read, you'll be fine. \nSony has a weird BIOS setup that won't even read the Win8 OS when you enable Legacy Boot. My wife won't let me wipe this PC, so I just run Ubuntu as a Virtual Machine using VMware Player.... Worked for months trying to get around this.... Hope this helps.\n\nA: First, I recommend you enter your firmware setup utility (usually done by pressing Del or a function key just after powering on the computer) and disabling Secure Boot. Unfortunately, the details of how to do this vary from one computer to another, so I can't be very precise about how to do it.\nIf that doesn't work, then you might try downloading the USB flash drive version of my rEFInd boot manager and booting from that while the Ubuntu CD is in the drive. With any luck, rEFInd will detect the Ubuntu CD and give you a boot option for it, and that will work. If you don't see the Ubuntu CD immediately, try hitting the Esc key.\nIf that doesn't work, try creating a bootable USB flash drive from the Ubuntu CD. It's possible that your computer will like that better than a CD.\nOne more point: The option to install Ubuntu within Windows (that is, using WUBI) is unsupported on EFI-based computers, which yours is.

New windows and dialog boxes appear at full brightness but the existing windows do not. Dragging a tab in Chrome to make a new window puts it in full brightness as does closing and reopening any apps.\nAs far as I can tell changing the compiz settings is not having an effect. Certainly when I switch of fade unresponsive windows nothing changes.\nThis problem appears to be intermittent and I do not know of any specific trigger.

Is there a way to completely remove Ubuntu 10.04/10.10/etc from a HDD without replacing it with another OS, so the HDD will return to its origin-state (empty)? I have googling this, as well as using the search facility in this site, but still came empty-handed.\nMost of the solution for removing/deleting Ubuntu presume that we will install Windows 7/Vista/XP in the HDD and suggesting to use Windows bootable disk/USB to format the Ubuntu partition then install the Windows. But what I am intend to do is to get an empty/clean HDD without any system within. I also don't have any Windows bootable disk/USB.\nCan anyone shed some light about this? Thanks.\n\nA: I'm sure there are several ways to completely wipe a hard disk. But, what you can do is download the GParted Live CD/USB from here. Burn it to a disc or make a bootable USB, then boot it up. In GParted, simply right click and delete all the partitions in the hard disk, and apply. If you can't right click and delete, first try to right click and unmount, and then delete. Just make sure you're performing these operations on your hard disk and not on another external HDD or USB stick. To be on the safe side, remove any other peripheral disks.\n\nA: You can always delete/format/shred your partition or whole partition table using Ubuntu bootable usb/disk.\nYou can do so easily by using gparted which is installed by default in live ubuntu.\n\nA: Personally I think the best method is to write all zeros to the drive using dd.\nBoot the live CD and \ndd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=1M\n\nChange /dev/sda to your hard drive.\nThe advantage of dd is that it overwrites your data as well as the MBR.\nYour other option would be scrub\nscrub -p dod /dev/sda\n\nhttp://linux.die.net/man/1/scrub\nscrub is faster and the -p dod option is compliant with dod standards.\nEither method will leave you with a \"clean\" hard drive.\n", "Q: How do I install gpointing-device?

I now need to resize the main partition itself (I prefer this over creating a separate partition and mounting it).\nAccording to GParted, I now have the following partitions:\n\nMy question is, how can I increase the size of the Filesystem partition to include the free 10GB?\nFrom information I found online, it looks like one limitation is the fact that he swap partition is immediately adjacent to the filesystem, so my understanding is that first thing would be to move that partition to the end of the volume. How can this be done?\nAlso, some sources suggest that the system should be booted from a LiveCD, so the filesystem is not the boot partition, and thus make it easier to resize. As mentioned above, I run a VM, so I am not sure how to boot it from a LiveCD. Any ideas?\n\nA: I was just doing exactly that a minute ago. What you want to do is:\n\n\n*\n\n*In the machine's settings point the CD Drive to the .iso file with your Ubuntu LiveCD.  You may also need to make sure the \"Connect at power on\" check box is checked.\n\n*Power the virtual machine on and hit F2 with the focus inside the machine. \n\n*Once inside the BIOS move to the Boot tab and select CD-Rom as primary boot device.\n\n*Run gParted - I think it's always there.\n\n*Destroy the swap partition: swapoff, delete the extended and linux-swap partitions.\n\n*Resize your primary partition to desired size.\n\n*Allocate your swap back again to whatever you like - create an extended partition and then allocate as linux swap. Remember about swapon :)\n\n\nAnd that's it. You now have a big primary partition! \nIn my case you'd need to have Jedi reflexes to get into BIOS by pressing F2 on the splash screen - the boot delay is just too short. What you can do to slow it down is go to your vm's .vmx file and type in something reasonable like:\nbios.bootDelay = \"5000\"\n\nFor 5 seconds of boot delay.\n", "Q: How to transfer music to a Windows Phone device? I recently bought a Nokia 620. Ubuntu 13.04 does recongize it and is able to mount it. Music files transferred through the file explorer don't show up at all in my phones media player. Trying to do it with Rhythmbox makes it crash. I have found that Clementine is able to do the job. However, transferred tracks lose their \"artist\" tag for some reason.\nSo here comes the question: What program you use to transfer music on you WP device? Or do you do it through Windows?\n\nA: WP devices use the MTP protocol. Have you tried using Nautilus with the GVFS MTP plugin?\nThere is a step-by-step guide on how to install and setup an up-to-date GVFS MTP plugin using a PPA in Ubuntu 12.04 and later at http://www.webupd8.org/2013/01/upgrade-to-gvfs-with-mtp-support-in.html.\n\nA: You may wirelessly transfer/copy music files to your Windows Phone via a web browser using the updated version 1.0.2.0 of Music Drop by Codeceptive Studios. The first version was great but the new one is even better! And what's best about this app: it's fast, efficient and most of all free ;-) \n\nA: I have Nokia Lumia 920.  I need some time but i found a relative fast way to bring the music to my phone it should work with every Windows phone. \nThe problem i had:\nI was able to move Songs in to the folder Music on my phone but the phone don't recognized them.\nYou have to install the mtp protocol on you're Ubuntu Computer/Laptop\nAnd you have to have a file-manager on your windows-phone(There is an official App from Microsoft,download it in the store)\nHow i solved it :\nFirst thing you connect your phone/mobile via USB with your Computer. There it should appear like an USB-device. Than you move all your music in to folder Downloads on the phone. \nThe next Step was done on my mobile/phone. You move the songs from Download to music and then they appear in the music list.\n\nA: My phone gets successfully mounted when i check the Nautilus using MTP. Then I can browse my phone and sd card memory.\nAlso, I have transferred videos and songs to my Lumia 720, which do appear in the list but takes sometime to reflect in the music+videos app in phone. A very limited video codecs are supported like mp4, avi etc.\nAlternative could be to remove the sd card and then transfer. \n\nA: I have a Nokia Lumia 710 with WP7.8. My laptop has Ubuntu 14.04.\nIt recognized my phone, I could even see it with different mtp tools like:\ngMTP, mtp-detect, file browser\nI even recompiled the libmtp...\nHowever I could not list the files and could not copy them.\nFinally I disabled the password on the phone and reconnect it, then every tool could browse it.\n(Don't need to boot my windows laptop to sync with Zune anymore... \\o/)\n\nA: seems Nautilus (in 18.10 anyway) picks up the phone and the SD storage. One can copy the music files over into teh music folder, but the xbox music app seems reluctant to identify all the tracks.\nI found going into settings and removing the SD card (Settings-> storage sense -> SD Card ->[scroll down] Remove SD Card), and then restarting the phone makes the music appear. \n\nA: Try disabling password on Windows phone. It has worked for me. You can enable your password again once you're done transferring the files.\n", "Q: How to disable \"recent files\" folder in Nautilus? When I turn off \" record activity\" in the privacy settings, my activities are still recorded in the \"recent files\" folder (even when I am using a truecrypt volume).\nI haven't figured out a PERMANENT solution to this problem. It sucks to delete history via terminal manually and what happens if I forget?\n\nA: Disable the Nautilus Recent Files list\nTo permanently disable any recent files from showing up in the Nautilus Recent sidebar item, open the ~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini file with a text editor:\ngedit ~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini\n\nand under \"[Settings]\", add the following lines:\ngtk-recent-files-max-age=0\ngtk-recent-files-limit=0\n\nIf this file does not exist, create it. Make sure the header says \"[Settings]\" and not \"Settings\". This is how the file should look after editing it:\n[Settings]\ngtk-recent-files-max-age=0\ngtk-recent-files-limit=0\n\n(there can be other items below these, of course).\nTo apply the changes, log out and log back in.\nCopied from Webupd8 exercising (cc) BY-NC-SA WebUpd8 : Nautilus 3.6: How To Clear The Recent Files List (Or Disable It)\n\nA: Using the terminal:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.privacy remember-recent-files false\n\n\nA: In 14.04 go to Settings > Security & Privacy > Files & Applications and check \"off\" .\n\nA: If you're using Ubuntu 17.10 and above (or Ubuntu GNOME) then:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Settings\n\n*Open the Privacy Tab\n\n\n*Click Usage & History and disable the \"Recently Used\" label\n\n\nA: The method with editing ~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini doesn't work with Nautilus 3.8.\nBut there is better and simpler way.\nSimply open dconf-editor, navigate to org->gnome->desktop->privacy and uncheck the remember-recent-files key. That takes care of it, once for all!\n\nA: Starting with GTK 3.8 (Ubuntu 13.10 and later) you can just use the following setting in\n~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini to disable the \"Recent files\" feature completely:\n[Settings]\ngtk-recent-files-enabled = 0\n\n\nA: You have 4 options (AFIK)\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the guest account. The guest account is confined by apparmor and the session is wiped when you log out.\n\n*Each user should have a separate account.\n\n*Write a script to clear your private data.\n\n*use bleachbit.\n\nA: As the settings.ini method didn't work for me on Ubuntu 13.04, here is a workaround that should be pretty reliable:\n$ rm ~/.local/share/recently-used.xbel # clear current file history\n$ touch ~/.local/share/recently-used.xbel # create a 0-byte history file\n$ sudo chattr +i ~/.local/share/recently-used.xbel # make it readonly\n\n\nA: Simply open dconf-editor, navigate to org->gnome->(filemanager e.g. nemo for me)->privacy and uncheck the remember-recent-files key. That takes care of it, once for all!\n", "Q: How do I install the latest OpenOffice.org? Today I downloaded and installed OpenOffice through the PPA repositories, using apt-get (hope that's what I mean to say), and when the program checked for updates it said there was a new version - 3.4.1 which I need to download from the website.\nI am reluctant to download from the website, because I tried this earlier (before using the PPAs) and while I was able to download the .tar.gz file and extract the DEBS, I couldn't figure out how to install it.  I found instructions on the internet that told me how to install, but for some reason, Ubuntu didn't know the application was installed!  Couldn't find it in Dash, and to run I had to find the OpenOffice folder and doubleclick soffice.bin.\nSo my question is, how to I download and install the latest version of OpenOffice without it being messed up as above?\n\nA: Ubuntu comes with an office suit by default, called Libre Office. If you would still like to install Open Office follow these directions.\nDownload..\nDownload Open Office from Openoffice.org (or use this direct link).\nSave the file to your Downloads folder.\nInstall..\nI highly recommend that you remove ALL previously installed versions of Open Office before proceeding!\nOpen a terminal and cd to the downloads folder:\ncd Downloads  \n\nNow we need to untar the installation folder:\ntar -xvzf Apache_OpenOffice_incubating_3.4.1_Linux_x86-64_install-deb_en-GB.tar.gz\n\nThen cd to the folder we just extracted:\ncd en-GB/DEBS  \n\nAnd install all the packages:\nsudo dpkg -i *.deb  \n\nWhen that has finished cd to the \"Desktop Integration\" folder:\ncd desktop-integration  \n\nand install those packages:\nsudo dpkg -i *.deb  \n\nAnd you're done!\nYou can now remove the en-GB folder.\n", "Q: can't download ubuntu I am unable to download ubuntu 13.04. the hosting site always claims the server is down and it has been like this since 10am GMT. any help guys?

I prefer emacs keystrokes, but select-all doesn't seem to be part of the emacs vocabulary, or at least, the gtk-key-theme for emacs. M-w isn't working to copy the selected region.\n\n\n*\n\n*What's the keystroke for select-all?\n\n*Where is a key binding map for this theme?\n\n\nThanks,\nSteve\n\nA: There isn't a single shortcut to do so directly.\nYou can go to the end of the text with Ctrl-e and remove a line Ctrl-u. This, however only works with GtkEntry, that is, one-line input field.\nIf you need to select everything in a GtkTextView, the multi-line editor-like control, you are left to do the onerous Ctrl-Home followed by Ctrl+Shift-End, which, with my 63-key keyboard is almost impossible.\nIf, for the good reason of editing efficiency or limitations of mobile device's keyboards, Home and End are out of reach, then you will have to get by. Selecting \"Select-all\" from \"Edit\" menu is a bad idea, because it maps to Alt-e - a in firefox, \nAlt-e - t in gedit, Alt-e - s in OpenOffice (even with gnome-integration), in each software a different key, and in some software, there is no \"Select-all\" in Edit Menu, like chromium, and in some software, there is not even Edit Menu itself, not even a hidden one to be called out with Alt-e, like nautilus. This inconsistence beats the purpose of the Alt-activated menu bar, and not any operating system, not even Windows, is as inconsitant. Even the right-click menu doesn't have a fixed shortcut for \"Select-All\" - it is usually a but can be t from application to application. Calling for bug-fix in each individual software can only be done with a meta-project like GNOME, but knowing GNOME itself produced some of these problems (removal of Edit Menu in 'nautilus' is a GNOME 3 decision) really didn't leave you much hope.\nOn a side note, Ctrl-Home is the only short-cut to move to the beginning of all text, even it may interrupt your work to key in for small-keyboard mobile devices.\nThe answer finishes here. For the curious minds I have additional information:\n\nA seasoned emacs user would attempt Ctrl-x-h: authentic emacs indeed, but no control key-sequence are understood by gtk3's emacs mode. In fact, only a handful of emacs shortcuts are defined - Take a peeked at /usr/share/themes/Emacs/gtk-3.0/gtk-keys.css; there are enough space on a sticker to write down all supported emacs shortcuts.\nTo make the situation even worse, it is difficult to relocate a shortcut key for this purpose. As you know, Ctrl-a is taken by emacs. But even Hispanophones, the largest non-English speaking group (Chinese excluded because we use ideographs), who are used to select everything with Ctrl-e, would find that keyboard shortcut taken by emacs, too. Excluding e, there are not any other key left in the left half of a QWERTY keyboard without an already-well-accepted purpose. Google Translate takes SHIFT key, when pressed alone, as 'select-all', but non other software nor other Google products follow the setting.\nTo empty a line, use Ctrl-u. This has the advantage of not overwriting X SELECTION (the one you yank with middle mouse button). This is a unique setting only of gtk3's emacs mode: in real emacs it doesn't do anything on its own; in readline (bash, mysql etc) it is supposed to delete everything from cursor to begining of the line, while its counter-part Ctrl-k deletes everything from cursor to the end of the line.\nSome may suggest you leave a mark somewhere for random selection with keyboard. You may also find Ctrl-SPACE is in emacs mode configured to set an anchor in the text. Despite conflicting with many other software (ideograph input methods in particular, and auto-completion in some other editor software), there is not any shortcut key to make use of the anchor you set.\n\nUbuntu does not officially suppoprt emacs editing mode, nor anything other UI configuration that cannot be done with UI. Bug reports about such needs are marked down-priority. For this reason I think it is best to ask such question to Linux-generic places, e.g. superuser.\n\nA: There is a simple binding for \"Select all\" in gtk: C-/\nIt’s defined as a general GtkTextView signal and not specifically part of the emacs key theme. But it works fine with it. It's defined as an alternative to C-a. While the latter gets reinterpreted by the emacs theme C-/ remains valid for \"Select all\".   \n\nA: The emacs bindings are specified at /usr/share/themes/Emacs/gtk-2.0-key/gtkrc\nYou can also add a bindings in ~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css\nSelect all would be something like this:\nbind \"<ctrl>h\" { \"move-cursor\" (buffer-ends, -1, 0)\n                 \"move-cursor\" (buffer-ends,  1, 1) };\n\nI haven't found a way to bind it to C-x h, though.\n\nA: View existing key binding\nFor GTK3 applications, you can view the bindings of the Emacs GTK key theme\n - either locally, probably at /usr/share/themes/Emacs/gtk-3.0/gtk-keys.css)\n - or on the GTK git repository on GitHub (which doesn't necessarily equal your local file, as your distro might have modified it).\nWhile reading this file, you have to be aware of the meaning of the widgets\n\n\n*\n\n*GtkTreeView,\n\n*GtkTextView,\n\n*GtkEntry and\n\n*GtkMenu.\n\n\n(Look at the image at the top of each linked site.)\nAdding key binding for selecting all\nselect-all for GtkTreeView and GtkTextView\nFor GtkTreeView and GtkTextView widgets, there is a signal called select-all. You need to pass it the argument 1 so that it selects all rather than deselecting.\nSo, edit ~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css and add something like this:\n@binding-set my-text-and-tree-view-bindings\n{\n    bind \"<alt>a\"\n    {\n    \"select-all\" (1)\n    };\n}\n\ntextview {\n  -gtk-key-bindings: my-text-and-tree-view-bindings;\n}\n\ntreeview {\n  -gtk-key-bindings: my-text-and-tree-view-bindings;\n}\n\nGtkEntry\nFor GtkEntry there is no select-all signal. Instead you can use a sequence of two move-cursor signals marking the text.\nAgain, edit ~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css and add something like this:\n@binding-set my-entry-bindings\n{\n    bind \"<alt>a\"\n    {\n    \"move-cursor\" (paragraph-ends, -1, 0)\n    \"move-cursor\" (paragraph-ends,  1, 1)\n    };\n}\n\nentry {\n  -gtk-key-bindings: my-entry-bindings;\n}\n\nFirefox\nBy the way, in Firefox Alt-a selects all for me by default without configuration (using the Emacs GTK key theme).\n\nA: If you want to select all text in a region, I prefer defining a simple Macro for that.\nPress F3 for starting to write a Macro. Then type\nEsc - <          // goes to beginning of document\nCtrl - spacebar  // set mark\nEsc - >          // selects all till end of document\n\nThen use M -w for copying (which is what I normally do for copying from remote unix systems to local Windows) and then press F4 to finish defining the macro.\nNow you are done defining the Macro, just hit F4 as many times you want to repeat the action.\n\nA: http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsNewbieKeyReference#toc8 appears to be what you're looking for ( C-x h after setting marker )\nAlso, depends on whether you want the 'page', or buffer, etc.\n", "Q: LibreOffice Writer Styles Is there anyway to easyly manage styles on LibreOffice Writer ? For instance, by installing a add-on ?\nWhen I was using Word, it was really intuitive to use differents styles, manage them and edit them. When I want to make a nice page layout, I use the style function with F11, but it is not really instinctive.\n\nA: You could try by using Next Style function. For example, lets say you have a Header 1 followed by some Text body. When setting up a Header 1 style (right click on line and then choose Paragraph style), choose tab Organizer and in and then for Next Style choose Text body. Further on, after writing a line in Header 1 and pressing enter, LibreOffice Writer should by default switch itself to Text body. As far as I know, there are no MSWordish big icons for that purpose. \n", "Q: is there download manager like IDM for automatically fetching link address of streaming video? is there any download manager that can be freely integrated to chromium or firefox, so that it will fetch the remote link url of any audio, video during streaming. \nI have used steadyflow download manager and recently installed Flareget, but still getting trouble for downloading streaming videos.\nIs there any better way..?\nThanks in advance... \n\nA: if you use Firefox or seabird i think you should use Add on of Firefox\nfor example Downthemall replace idm and video download helper to catch video link\n", "Q: How to get Nvidia Graphic card to work on Thinkpad T430?

It is laggy, so ALL mouse positions of the courser of the last 5 seconds are shown.\nIn this setup no extra software is installed, only the drivers delivered by ubuntu. This works so far the best.

But I can only run one monitor (which would be okay), but the max resolution was 1920*1080, even on the monitor with a higher default resolution.\nAny suggestions to fix that?\nOptimus mode=disabled/enabled, use Nvidia drivers\nI also tried installing the nvidia drivers via 'sudo apt-get install nvidia-current' but that did not work. After that the system does not boot anymore. Only a black screen is shown after boot loader. The system only boots if I enable optimus mode.

Has anybody got an idea why I can't use the driver on Ubuntu, what I can do to use it and if it's a bad idea to create the package myself with the newest package from the website?\nEDIT: Ok, got a solution now: Simply use this repo, which downgrades your x-server to 1.12.4, which enables you to install the proprietary drivers.\nAccording to the launchpad site, do this:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:makson96/fglrx\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get install fglrx-legacy\n\n\nA: Hardware companies do not support their products with software updates forever.

The -j flag, when followed by a number, restricts the number of processes running at one time to whatever you put. However, if -j is not followed by a number, the number of threads is not limited.

One of the screens says \"Installation type\", with the three options \"Install Ubuntu alongside Windows Vista\" or \"Replace Windows Vista with Ubuntu\" or \"Something else\". No matter which of those three options I highlight, the \"Continue\" button is always grayed out and un-selectable. (I can only select \"Quit\" or \"Back\".) (When I highlight the second option, the word \"Continue\" switches to \"Install Now\" on the button ... but it is still grayed out and unselectable.)\nOther than the fact that I cannot \"continue\", the installer offers no information about what's going wrong. Any ideas? Thanks in advance!! [I am also happy to hear advice about how exactly I can file a bug report about this.]\n\nA: I clicked \"Back\" and then \"Continue\" again, and now it works. Go figure...\n[Update based on comments: If this doesn't work, try it again and/or wait 15 minutes.]\n\nA: I also had this problem installing Kubuntu 16.10 in VirtualBox. Unlike shao.lo, for me dynamic vs. fixed .vdi didn't matter. For me the problem was that the virtual disk was too small, but the installer doesn't give any useful error report about this. There is an icon on the screen indicating the issue, but it's so abstracted as to be meaningless: it looks like a trashcan with a line through it, with no accompanying explanation. (If the disk is adequate it will be a checkbox.) I created a new VDI of appropriate size (>8.6GB, apparently) and it worked.\nI was only able to discover this by running \"ubiquity -d\" from a terminal and examining the output in /var/log/installer/debug.\n\nA: On Lubuntu 16.10, for me, not selecting \"Download updates before install\" solved the problem. \n\nA: I had this problem trying to install Kubuntu 16.10 in VirtualBox.  Initially I had chosen a dynamic vdi disk.  The install would get to the second page of the install where \"Install Updates as part of install\" is.  No matter what I did the Continue button would always be greyed out.\nI exited the vm and went back to settings to change the dynamic vdi to a fixed sized one.  That fixed it for me.\n\nA: I had the same problem during install kubuntu 16.04.2 LTS. The problem was the size of the dynamic vdi disk. \nThe default size of 8 GByte was not enough. After setting it to 256 GByte the installation was possible.\n\nA: Using Lubuntu 16.04.3, I ran into a similar problem (Continue button also grayed out). In my case I was able to \"enable\" that button, performing the steps below, for which this answer inspired me, and which includes:\n\n... not selecting \"Download updates before install\" solved the problem\n\nSteps to enable the Continue button anyway (starting from the screen where you're stuck with that button being disabled):\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the Back button to return to the previous screen where you can select \"Download updates before install\" (I had this option also selected at first).\n\n*Continue again (to return to the screen where you got stuck), and at this point the Continue button is no longer disabled. However, as per the previous step the \"Download updates before install\" option is not selected either anymore, which is not really what I wanted ...\n\n*Do not actually hit the Continue button ...yet. Instead, use the Back button again to return to the previous screen where you can select \"Download updates before install\". Just enable (check) the \"Download updates before install\" option again, and continue again.\n\n*Eureca ... the Continue button is no longer disabled ... AND  the \"Download updates before install\" option is selected also!\n\n*Now is the time to actually hit the Continue button ...\n\n\nA: Same problem here, trying to install lubuntu 17.04 in my old Aspire One and that problem happen every time. Reading about the problem i found a question about the ACPI, so a decide to turn it off, but Lubuntu doents have the menu options to choose the grub parameters, then to change the boot options of the lubuntu you have to edit the file \\boot\\grub\\loopback.cfg on the pendrive, and add the parameter \"acpi=off\", near the \"boot=casper\" i think its a good place.\nthis is my entry that works\nmenuentry \"Install Lubuntu\" {   \n    linux   /casper/vmlinuz  file=/cdrom/preseed/lubuntu.seed cdrom-detect/try-usb=true noprompt floppy.allowed_drive_mask=0 acpi=off ignore_uuid boot=casper only-ubiquity iso-scan/filename=${iso_path} quiet splash ---\n    initrd  /casper/initrd.lz \n}\n\nand with that option the installer can go on\n", "Q: *buntu setup for Granny I'm trying to setup a *buntu system for grandma. Her needs are a browser, a text processer (libreoffice will be fine), being able to watch youtube and not being able to get into too much trouble deleting or misplacing files that she really would rather keep.\nIs there one of the ubuntu variants that makes it easy to set this up (edubuntu?) Or should one stick with the stock ubuntu (since I have only really experience with that) and then remove all superfluous menus etc.\n\nA: Linux mint (ubuntu based) \nLinux mint is an easy to use desktop.

I placed all program shortcuts important to her on the desktop using quite big icons. She is very satisfied.\nLTS is a good choice as older ppl do not like changes, and it offers very long support. \nMy mum works on her own user account with normal user priveleges, so she cannot mess up anything important. I also set up system so she is automatically logged in and she has no password set up so she can do everything she wants. Also update manager doesn't bother her.\nTo install Gnome desktop simply write gnome shell in ubuntu software center.\n\nA: basically any desktop environment is good, any but unity. I find tha people feel weir about the window menu going up to the top bar and that they can only see it if they put the mouse on top of if. They also find uncomfortable with the close minimize/maximize buttons being on top of the dock bar and not directly on top of the window.\nYou should try something easy to use. Maybe gnome shell with a dock bar allways visible and big icons, and icons in the desktop. Or maybe xfce, the one good thing of it is that the names below icons are very readable because of their solid color background.\nAnyway, choose what you choose you will absolutely have to tweak it.\n", "Q: Ubuntu won't update from 12.10 to 13.04 To update I typed in sudo update-manager -d into terminal and I got this code back (I had to edit the links):\nW:GPG error: h.ttp://linux.dropbox.com precise Release: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY FC918B335044912E,  \nW:GPG error: h.ttp://extras.ubuntu.com quantal Release: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY 16126D3A3E5C1192, \nW:GPG error: h.ttp://ppa.launchpad.net jaunty Release: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY F104610CF0876AC9, \nW:GPG error: h.ttp://ppa.launchpad.net quantal Release: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY B187F352479B857B,  \nW:GPG error: h.ttp://ppa.launchpad.net quantal Release: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY 86D36DFDE6A250EA,  \nW:GPG error: h.ttp://ppa.launchpad.net quantal Release: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY 5A9A06AEF9CB8DB0,  \nW:GPG error: h.ttp://ppa.launchpad.net quantal Release: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY C2518248EEA14886,  \nW:GPG error: h.ttp://ppa.launchpad.net quantal Release: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY C2518248EEA14886,  \nW:Failed to fetch h.ttp://ppa.launchpad.net/pmcenery/ppa/ubuntu/dists/quantal/main/source/Sources  404  Not Found,  \nW:Failed to fetch h.ttp://ppa.launchpad.net/pmcenery/ppa/ubuntu/dists/quantal/main/binary-i386/Packages  404  Not Found,  \nE:Some index files failed to download.

I don't know, but if you want Wubi then you will have to provide the output of the Wubi log from the %temp% directory i.e. wubi-12.04.2-rev272.log. Also I recommend running chkdsk /f first and possibly defragmenting. If it worked before and stopped working then there could be some NTFS filesystem corruptiong that is causing problems.\nAfter reviewing your log file, the only thing I can guess is that it's tripping over the space in your Windows user name. I've already seen cases where an apostrophe causes issues, but there's no diagnostic output in your case that shows why it is failing. I will take a look at the code to see.\nYou can do one of two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run it under a different windows account where the user name doesn't have a space\n\n*Run Wubi with the 12.04.2 desktop ISO.

I am a video gamer. I also want Linux, so I came to Ubuntu. Only one question remains: Do I want the \"cutting-edge\" Ubuntu 13.04, supported for 9 months, or the 12.04 \"extended support\" version, supported for 4 years? Or do I want something else entirely?\n\nA: Since you are looking at this like a gamer, then you have to go with the latest, at this time, 13.04. It has better video performance, updated kernel, updated drivers and enhancements to Unity for performance. So at the end, games will run better on 13.04.\nSince you are looking at this as a gamer, then the extended support is irrelevant since most gamers tend to update their system when something new comes along. Also 13.04 is not cutting edge. It's another stable release that offers the latest version of Ubuntu. If you want cutting edge I suggest to read How do I install the Nvidia drivers? and trying out the latest drivers.\nBut at the end, if you want the best performance for your games, always go with the latest. The support is of less importance since when a new version comes out, you will probably update to it. I say this as another gamer.\n\nA: I'm going to give you a piece of advice: don't jump headfirst into this change, OR ELSE YOU WILL BECOME ONE OF US - TECH WIZARD PROBLEM SOLVERS.\nXD\nNow then, go for 13.04 current release, and update regularly. Use Wine for your games. Ask for help when you need it, but do a quick google search first.\nWelcome to Ubuntu.\n\nA: You want the distribution recommended by the game creators!    If they do not support Linux, then don't spend time trying to make that game run under Linux.\nFor Steam I understand that they target 12.04 LTS.  This would be a good start.\n", "Q: Ubuntu tweak tool - Mouse cursor would not change theme I tried to change the cursor theme from DMZ-White to DMZ-Black for my laptops.

The only solution appear to force shutdown MBA at this point by holding power button\nsome info on MBA standby mode\n\nA: I'm rEFInd's developer. I've heard another report similar to this, but I'm unable to replicate it myself, since my one Intel-based Mac is an elderly 32-bit model that doesn't exhibit this behavior. Since the problem doesn't manifest within rEFInd itself, I can't simply create a debugging version to give to somebody like you who does have the problem; it's going to take hands-on fiddling with the hardware to identify the cause of the problem and find a solution. The solution could be something like an alternative installation method for rEFInd or a code change to rEFInd, but whatever it is, I'm afraid that I can't find it unless/until I get a computer that has the problem. I have no plans to buy any new Macs in the near future, so this will have to wait indefinitely or for somebody else to find a solution.\n\nA: I tried the old rEFIt (instead of the forked project rEFInd), it works beautifully with Macbook Air 5.2 and Ubuntu 13.04, and the wake from sleep problem is gone.\nSo I highly recommend people having this problem give rEFIt a try.\n\nA: Since this is an old article and about rEFInd, I'll keep it short.\nI recently took my brother his MacBook Air 5.2 in hands because he near identical problems, he is on Ubuntu 18.04 and does not use rEFInd, his laptop has an OWC SSD inside, a simple firmware update and intel-microcode installation seemed to fix the problems here.\n(I will update the post if the problem comes back, so far the symptoms seem to have disappeared)\n", "Q: ubuntu 13.04 doesn't recognize second 40gb hard drive I have 2 hdd\n320 gb + 40 gb\nthe 320 gb has windows 7\ni am trying to install ubuntu 13.04 on the 40 gb but ubuntu 13.04 doesn't recognize it when installing\nbut ubuntu 13.04 recognize it when i choose try ubuntu \ni removed the 320 giga and use only the 40 giga and ubuntu did not recognize it \nafter partitioning the 40 giga with Gparted 2partitions the first partition is about 33 giga  ext4 the second partition about 5 giga swap\nstill have the same problem\nwhen installing ubuntu it can not recognize the 40 giga hd\nImage when installing:\n\nImage when try ubuntu:\n\n\nA: If it's SATA, SCSI, or SAS try unplugging the drive while the system is on and plugging them back in (while the system is still on).\n", "Q: Water Cooler fan control with Ubuntu 12.04 Phenom X4 965 3.4ghz \n4gb RAM \nATI Radeon HD 6870 1gb \nWater Cooler Corsair \n\nAfter fresh install of Ubuntu 12.04, my water coller was ever enable and run so fast.\nI can't disable or control it.\nI try follow this post, but doesn't work: How to control fan speed?\nWhen I run sudo pwmconfig, appear that:\n# pwmconfig revision 5857 (2010-08-22)\nThis program will search your sensors for pulse width modulation (pwm)\ncontrols, and test each one to see if it controls a fan on\nyour motherboard.

I need to have my nano editor autosave every 10 seconds or some specific time period. How can I achieve this ?\n\nA: There is no way to make nano to autosave the file that you are editing at a specific time period. You can save a file everytime when you want without exiting from nano with Ctrl+O(\"O\" from \"Omega\", not zero) or F3.\nBut, don't worry, automatically saves backups. See https://manual.cs50.net/nano/#__save_files: \n\nIf you have been using nano, you may see files with the \".save\"\n  extension appearing in directories in which you are working. If you\n  are editing a file (let's call it \"hello.c\") on a server and somehow\n  your connection to the server is lost, whether because you closed the\n  terminal window or you lost your connection to the internet or some\n  other unknown reason, nano will automatically save a backup of\n  the state of the file in a new file with a \".save\" extension (e.g.\n  \"hello.c.save\"). So, when you log back onto server, don't worry that\n  you've lost everything you've been working on because you hadn't saved\n  for an extended period of time, you can simply open up the \".save\"\n  file and then continue from where you left off, and when you go to\n  save the file, you can save it with the name of the original file\n  (without the \".save\" extension). Don't rely entirely on this though,\n  such as thinking you can just close your terminal window without\n  saving because nano has got you covered, because in a very few cases\n  the file is not correctly created.\nIf a \".save\" file already exists and you open up the file without\n  the \".save\" extension, and your connection is lost again, nano\n  will save the file with a \".save.1\" extension, incrementing the\n  number at the end of the extension for each time. If you have open a\n  file without a name and lose your connection, the file will\n  automatically be saved with the name \"nano.save\".\n\nThat being said, I do not see any reason of concern for autosaving files in nano.\n", "Q: Lost transparency in KDE after installing fglrx video driver The transparency of KDE panel , Kickoff menu & tooltips were gone just after installing the fglrx display driver \n\n\n*\n\n*Folder view plasmoid remains transparent (Looks like before). \n\n*Kwin animations are functioning fine too.\n\n*Kickoff Application Menu now fades in, rather than raising up from bottom.\n\n\nI'm on  Kubuntu 13.04\n\nAny idea, would be appreciated!\nThanks!\n\nA: Got it back.....!\nI removed the fglrx driver, installed fglrx-update and created a new user account. \n", "Q: Weird Thunderbird Uninstall Problem Ok.

That will show you anything that's accessing those files + directories.  You can then kill those processes (and use lsof as needed to see if anything stays open).  If killing them doesn't work, try a kill -KILL <pid> to send a SIGKILL, which should do the trick.\nIf you post what processes are locking those files, we can shut them off.  For my personal system, I prefer to update my system with sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade on my own on a daily basis.\nedit, also try fuser - this may be an easier way for most, but keep lsof in your pocket as a must-know Linux command.

I dont understand whats in 5gb of os x and windows installation dvds when ubuntu fits on 700mb cd and just works with every hardware! I am not criticizing i am just curious. I'm expecting answers like comparing webgl with dirextx or graphics library whatever mac uses and comparision between frameworks used by these oses.\n\nA: They are two very different operating systems and have quite different architectures. Mac OS X has many softwares installed by default.That takes up most of the space of the installation disc.   \nNow, coming to Ubuntu we have a 700MB CD because of the lower size of bundled softwares and the kernel/GNU utils.\nThere are lots of DVD variants of Ubuntu which are upto 4 gb in size and they comes preloaded with Softwares.\nAnother important thing is that, It is the Linux kernel that gives support for wide range of hardware, not the size of the CD/DVD. You can't equate the installation disc size with variety in  hardware support.\nHope that helps.\n\nA: Well this isn't strictly true anymore, see OMG Ubuntu\n\nUbuntu 12.10 will increase the maximum size of its disc image from 700MB to 800MB, thereby making it too big to fit onto traditional CD-R media.\n\nAs for why OSX and Windows don't support it, the reason is that they never really had that as a goal as it wasn't in their interest as they were going to sell it commercially in retail stores on DVD media anyway.\nIt is only recently that OS like Mountain Lion became downloadable content.  Until then, there was no need for OSX or Windows to worry about being smaller as they were always going to come on DVD media anyway so they basically made the most of the space available to them on that media since it was their target media.\nIt might become a bigger concern for Apple now they sell OS updates through the App Store too.\n\nA: It is a matter of goals.\nBoth Ubuntu and OS X was originally designed to ship on cdrom media (e.g. OS X 10.4 came on four cd or one dvd), but OS X is dvd or network only today.\nUbuntu has a different target audience than OS X, so they have stayed with the cdrom distribution method for a lot longer than OS X.  Going for the cdrom media allows the largest possible audience to download and burn the installation ISO.  If they only shipped a Bluray image, only those with Bluray drives would be able to download and install Ubuntu.\nPersonally I think that breaking the 700 MB limit should be equivalent to \"we now create dvd images only\".  They download a lot of software anyway to keep up to date.\n", "Q: How do I mount .vhd file? I'm using 13.04 Raring amd64 and I need to mount a .vhd file on my ubuntu. I've googled about it and found that virtualbox-fuse package is the answer.\nBut the package was deleted from apt repository. Is there any way to install the package w/ 13.04? or is there any alternative to virtualbox-fuse?\n\nA: sudo apt-get install virtualbox-fuse\nsudo mkdir /mnt/vhd-disk/\nsudo vdfuse -f disk.vhd /mnt/vhd-disk/\nsudo mount -o loop  /mnt/vhd-disk/Partition1 /mnt/partition1\n\nNote that you may need additional options to mount to set permissions to your liking.\n\nA: Using Ubuntu 15.10 (works also on Ubuntu 16.04), you can install vhdimount and tsk (The Sleuth Kit) via:\nsudo apt-get install libvhdi-utils sleuthkit\n\nThen you can proceed as follows:\nsudo mkdir -v /mnt/vhd\nsudo vhdimount -X allow_root /path/to/file.vhd /mnt/vhd/\nsudo mmls -aB /mnt/vhd/vhdi1\n\nNext, you'll have to calculate the offset from the output of mmls like this:\necho offset*512 | bc\n\nAnd to finish:\nsudo mkdir -v /media/${USER}/your/folder\nsudo mount -vt ntfs-3g -o ro,noload,offset=offset-found /mnt/vhd/vhdi1 /media/${USER}/your/folder\n\nReplace offset-found by your offset. You may also have to change the fs-type according to the fs-type included in your vhd file.\nI've made a script so I don't have to type this every time ;)\n\nA: Searching Ubuntu's Launchpad space, the following comes up:\n\nvirtualbox (The binary 'virtualbox-fuse' is part of the virtualbox package)\n\nThis means that they merged virtualbox-fuse into the main package and you just need to install virtualbox from the repository (This is what used to be called virtualbox-ose, so if you need the PUEL licensed \"full\" version, this won't help you.)\n\nA: I'd prefer not to rely on a VM to access data on a vhd image.  Since virtualbox-fuse and vdfuse is no longer available in Ubuntu (not since precise (12.04)) and Debian (not since Wheezy (7)).  I was able to mount the NTFS partition of a personal VHD using blk-tap.\nInsert the apropriate pid from tap-ctl spawn, of course.

For some reason, kpartx -a would not map partitions (I was looking for /dev/xen/blktap-2/tapdev0p1), but I found that /dev/disk/by-id/dm-name-tapdev0p1 had been linked to the block device for the partition.\n\nA: Here is what I did for it:\nIt seems not there's a smooth way to go. I just downloaded virtualbox-fuse deb package file from launchpad. (here)\nI picked 4.1.18 because my vbox is a little bit older but I guess it would works with recent version.\nInstall the package with dpkg -i.

My computer appears to be acting as it should really, I  just don't understand why I have to restart before installing?\n\nA: first I would check your iso and make the USB again to make sure your installation USB is correct.\n\nA: I would perform a full system backup on your Windows system before attempting anything else on the install.  One easy way to do this is to go to Start, Run, and choose 'Backup & Restore' (if you start typing the command, it will autocomplete).\nOnce your system is backed up, run CrystalDiskInfo (open source), as mentioned in http://www.howtogeek.com/134735/how-to-see-if-your-hard-drive-is-dying/.  This won't diagnose 100% of disk problems, but it can at least give you an idea.  I would also recommend selecting memtest86 during Ubuntu bootup, as mentioned in https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FaultyHardware.  That link has some other resources, but you may find CrystalDiskInfo to provide more data.  Choosing to 'try Ubuntu without installing' (LiveCD mode) definitely gives you access to a ton of open source utilities to help you diagnose any hardware issues.\nThere are a lot of other considerations for running Windows 8 and Ubuntu simultaneously.  Since it can be hairy for an experienced user, I definitely recommend backing up your Windows data as rule for dual-boot installs (I sure do).\n", "Q: Issues opening everything I recently installed Ubuntu 12.04.

When I want to install Ubuntu using USB I can't see the option called install Ubuntu along the side Windows. Why is this happening?\nWhen I tried this method in other PC it showed this alongside option but when I click this option the PC restarts and again the installation starts. What is the problem?\nI checked the md5sum using the winmd5sum software and it was same.\n\nA: It sounds like you're not booting (starting the computer) from your USB drive. This can occasionally be because your computer isn't capable of booting from USB devices (especially on older computers), but it's actually more likely that your regular hard drive is higher up in priority than the USB drive. This is very easy to fix, but if these instructions don't help or if they're confusing, please come back to me with your computer's full make and model.\nUsually, when you turn on your computer, there is what's known as a \"splash screen\". Some computers, instead of displaying a splash screen, show the computer's power-on self test. This is where the computer counts the amount of available memory, etc.\nOn this \"splash screen\" or self-test screen, there are usually a few notices similar to:\nPress DEL to Enter Setup, or Press F2 for Setup\nPress F12 for BBS Popup or Press F12 for Boot Selection or Press F12 for custom boot.\nWhat you want to do is enter the boot selection menu and then boot the computer from your USB drive.\nIf you're using a computer that doesn't allow manual boot device selection, you'll have to go into the computer setup to prioritise USB boot over Hard Drive boot. This is also relatively simple, but it can be daunting at first. For precise instructions, please add a comment to my answer with the full make and model of your computer so I can help better.\nUsually it's either DEL or F2 to enter setup. From there, you want to look for a \"Boot\" menu and move USB up in that list.\nIt might actually be easier for you to run the Windows Installer (wubi), which you can download here:\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/windows-installer\nIt lets you install Ubuntu directly from Windows which makes it very, very easy to do!\nIf you're new to Ubuntu, I definitely suggest using the 12.04 LTS version rather than 13.04. 12.04 LTS is very stable, reliable and easy to use, and once you're an expert with 12.04, you can upgrade easily from within Ubuntu.\nEdit:\nOkay, it looks like you need to disable UEFI and Secure boot, if they are enabled. Go into your computer's BIOS Setup (using DEL or F2) and in a section such as Security you should have an option entitled \"UEFI Enabled\", and possibly \"Secure Boot\". Ensure that these are disabled and you should have more luck.\n", "Q: Notification Transparency Is there a way to customize the notifications (notify-send) that appear ?\nColour, transparency, font, font size, font colour, etc ?\nI would mainly like to increase transparency.\nUbuntu 13.04\n\nA: Sure, it's possible.

I'm running Windows XP Home (32bit) on an older Dell Dimension 2350 with 1GB ram, trying to install either Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (32Bit) or 13.04 (32Bit) inside VirtualBox. Both versions of Ubuntu don't make it past the purple screen with the loading dots. When I change over to the \"non-graphical\" version, with the scrolling text, it starts to list a series of tests that are either [ok] or [fail]. There are only a few that fail, and my search on those indicates that they're not that important. There are a few settings for this VM that I've tried tweaking based on other searches for an answer (such as Enabling IO APIC, switching the Chipset to ICH9, changing the Video Memory size, Enabling 3D Acceleration, and Enabling PAE/NX. More or less, I get to the same point.\n(Once I got to the screen with Desktop in the upper left corner, and the red-ish background. But an error came up that basically said there was an error, and that I could send off a report or hit cancel. I hit cancel, and instead of the installer coming up, nothing happened)\nThe last check that is run is \"Stopping System V runlevel compatibility [ok], and a bunch of Starting [ok]s. Then I get a black screen, then a half purple half black screen graphical error. Sorta looks like snow, I don't know how else to describe it. After a while. That goes away and is replaced by a black screen again. Nothing else happens.\n\nI like to think I'm fairly good at solving problems and following instructions, but I don't even know how to go about diagnosing this. Most of the solutions I've seen seem to involve entering things into a command line, but doesn't the OS have to be installed to be able to do that?\nThis is a for fun/learning experience project, so it's nothing too pertinent. But I would like to figure this out. \n\nA: 3D acceleration in a VM\nWhen installing more recent versions of Ubuntu we do rely on the presence of a graphics card capable of 3D acceleration needed for Compiz and Unity.\nIn a bare metal installation such a graphics adapter almost always is present. Ubuntu will then load the appropriate driver on boot. This is different in a virtualized machine where a virtual graphic card providing (limited) 3D capabilities will only be installed with a driver provided by the guest additions.\nGuest Additions from root shell\nAs we can not log in or boot the graphical desktop to aid us with mounting the Guest Additions iso we will have to do that from the command line after we boot into a root shell.\nWe first have to load the Guest Additions .iso from Virtual Box Manager (\"Devices\") to be presented as /dev/cdrom (alternatively /dev/sr0) to the guest OS. We then additionally need to mount the CD in our guest Ubuntu to be able to install them.\nFrom a root shell where we gained read/write access to our virtual hard disk (see link above) we can do so with the following commands:\nmount /dev/cdrom /mnt              # or any other mountpoint\ncd /mnt\n./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run\nreboot\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n\n*\n\n*Sometimes we still may not be able to boot to the desktop. Then we may try if an update of Ubuntu resolves the issue. From a root shell run:\napt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade\nreboot\n\n\n*If we still can't log in, we may try if we can do so from TTY. Enter the virtual terminal by pressing HOST + F1. Login with the administrator user and password you gave on installation of Ubuntu (the password will not be displayed, not even asterisks). Then start the login manager lightdm as follows:\nsudo lightdm\n\nSometimes after we had done this once, we may be able to do a normal reboot and login as usual.\n\n*If we are unable to even start the graphical installer we may have an issue with the host graphics driver. We can try to install with  a text based installation or in 12.04 from the Alternate CD. You may also try with nomodeset on boot.\n\n\nRelated Questions\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I boot into a root shell?\n\n*How do I install Guest Additions in a VirtualBox VM?\n\n*Can't install Ubuntu since 10.10\n\nA: Even I faced the same issue. After lots of searching on the web,I finally realized that virtualization was disabled in BIOS settings which was causing this issue. \nI Enter in to BIOS settings, search for Virtualization and Enable it. \nProblem is solved!! ! \n\nA: I had this black screen of death when I tried to install Ubuntu 12.04 LTS in Virtualbox under Windows 7. It may sound odd but rebooting my Windows machine solved the problem for me.\n", "Q: Broken emacs installation First of all, I am really sorry about behaving like an over smart.

Is there anything else I would need to do?\nThanks\n\nA: I just checked my installation of 13.04, and Mono is not installed.\nTo install Mono, this will install Mono Run-time, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nsudo apt-get install mono-runtime\n\nIf mono Develop is what you're after, then\nsudo apt-get install monodevelop\n\nMono focuses on compilers and run-time libraries and does not directly provide an IDE. MonoDevelop is a cross platform IDE mostly aimed at Mono/.NET developers. For more info see MonoDevelop, and Mono\n\nA: It's easiest to install using the Ubuntu Software Center. Just search for \"mono\" in Ubuntu Software Center and you can install it from there. It's called \"MonoDevelop\". You can also use this link:\nhttp://apt.ubuntu.com/p/monodevelop\n", "Q: Using my wifi netgear for syncing my file system I have a desktop , a laptop and a tab. I have a wired internet connection which is routed through netgear for wifi connection to my laptop and android tablet. Is it possible to sync my files of a particular location in my tablet/laptop with my desktop? I do not want to use the google drive or dropbox as this will consume my network bandwidth(over a long run). I want to use only my wifi netgear router(intranet) without using the internet.\n\nA: I think that you're looking for rsync\nUsage:\nrsync -avz /root/temp/ remote_user@192.168.200.10:/home/remote_user/temp/\n\nwhere /root/temp/ is the local directory and /home/remote_user_temp/ is the remote directory where the syncing is done. You will be asked for the remote_user's password.\nNote that rsync depends on ssh, which means that you will have to install it on both machines (so as ssh-client/server is installed in both of them so as to do anything you want with rsync from anywhere)\nFor more information on rsync's options you can \nman rsync\n\n\nA: \nI do not want to use the google drive or dropbox as this will consume my network bandwidth(over a long run)\n\nFirst of all, note that Dropbox will use your LAN. It won't go over all of the WAN for syncing files over the local network. It will still use some internet bandwidth, but it will just try to find files on your local network. See LAN Sync on the Dropbox help site:\n\nLAN sync is a Dropbox feature that speeds syncing dramatically when\n  the file exists on your Local Area Network (LAN).\n[...] With LAN syncing, Dropbox will look for the new file on your\n  Local Area Network first, bypassing the need to download the file from\n  Dropbox servers, thus speeding up the syncing process considerably.\nLAN sync is an extra advantage for use in locations where computers\n  are networked together over the same router or other local area\n  network.\n\nIn case you're looking for a more Dropbox-like, but self-hosted application with a automatic synchronisation of files, the ability to revert to earlier versions, add more machines, etc. then you might consider using sparkleshare . It is available on Android as well.\n", "Q: DELL LATITUDE E5420 freezes I am experiencing problem with versions from 10 to 13 of Ubuntu on Dell Latitude E5420, specifically. The behavior is very weird. If Ubuntu is started without power supply plugged in, the notebook works as a charm. At the moment the charger is plugged in, the notebook starts working slowly, the mouse pointer is moving like an ant. Unplugging the charger turns Ubuntu back to its normal condition. Plugging it in, back, repeats the issue. If Ubuntu starts with power supply plugged in and 100% charged battery it is OK, however if not with fully charged battery and on power supply, the issue occurs again.\nSo far, I believe this happens only on that model of Dell. On Latitude E5410 I did not manage reproducing it. \nHas anyone of you had such a case? \n\nA: I had this problem on UBUNTU 13.04 on the same laptop (Dell latitude 5430)\nI did a simple thing - just a lucky shot - .. updated all the xserver packages that I had as follows:\nsudo apt-get install xserver\n\nit will correct you and show about 3 xserver packages .... install them all (they should be installed .. but whatever)\nsudo apt-get install <xserver-****>\n\nthen upgrade them\nsudo apt-get upgrade <xserver-****>\n\nand it is solved now ^_^\nA.Z\n", "Q: Webcam appears black in Skype, Acer Aspire V3-571G My webcam functions normally on Flash, Cheese, etc. However in Skype, it appears black.\nMy laptop is Acer Aspire V3-571G.\nAnyone know how to fix it?\n\nA: I keep figuring out solutions to my own questions, but seeing as other people may face the same issue, what fixed it was typing this into terminal v4l2-ctl --set-ctrl=exposure_auto_priority=1 everytime i start a skype call.\n", "Q: How to open a crontab file in c++ I am working on a QT application which makes the usage of crontab easier with GUI. But I am facing the trouble of including the jobs in the crontab file from my application . \nSo how do i open a crontab file in c++ application in order to edit it. \nAny kind of help is appreciated.\nThank you\n\nA: I suggest to have a look at KDE's Task Scheduler (kde-config-cron)  which allows to set up crontabs.\nThis is a Qt application which does already do what you're trying to achieve.

I need a nameserver so that my domain works. With the registrar I have inputed ns1.mydomain.com and ns2.mydomain.com.\nI want to run my own nameserver. Both ns1 and ns2 should point to the same computer despite the fact that this defeats the purpose of redundancy.\nWith no success, I have tried several guides, including ones from the Ubuntu documentation. I have probably messed up the configuration pretty good by now.\nDoes anyone have a guide that they know works? How will I know it is working? Some guides prescribed reverse DNS, some did not, is it needed? What should I look for in a good guide?\n\nA: Just follow the given below steps \n1. Go to https://www.cloudflare.com/ & make an account\n2. Add your website and it will guide you step by step\n \n3.At last it will provide you with DNS settings and that is ERIC.NS.CLOUDFLARE.COM, \nMARY.NS.CLOUDFLARE.COM\n4.Add there DNS settings to your domain & wait for at least 24 hours \n5.After that you need to modify your DNS according to your VPS IP address at https://www.cloudflare.com/ \n\nSo now You Domain is pointing to your VPS.\nI would suggest you that you should install install Zpanel on your VPS, so that you can manage your domain DNS & website easily.\n", "Q: error message while updating R version from 2.10 to 3.0 on Ubuntu 12.04 I get the following error message while trying to update my current R version from 2.10 to 3.0.Any tips would be welcome.\nThanks\nmgjohnson@mgjohnson-linux:~$ apt-get install r-base\nE: Could not open lock file /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (13: Permission denied)\nE: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), are you root?\nmgjohnson@mgjohnson-linux:~$ apt-get update\nE: Could not open lock file /var/lib/apt/lists/lock - open (13: Permission denied)\n\n\nA: You should run this as superuser by prefixing sudo to your command:\nsudo apt-get install r-base\n\nYou can find more info here: http://www.linuxmanpages.com/man8/sudo.8.php which defines sudo as follows:\n\nsudo allows a permitted user to execute a command as the superuser or another user, as specified in the sudoers file.

Once the CD is done, go ahead and boot from it, and just follow the directions. \nSource:Boot-Repair\n\nA: It sounds to me like your bootloader was installed on C: and in formatting that, you lost your bootloader.\nSee here:\nHow do I reinstall bootloader?\n\nA: I would suggest trying to repair GRUB. The easiest way to do that is probably to use Boot Repair application. Just do these on Live-CD or Live-USB session. You do not need to burn on CD anything if You have disc or pen-drive with any version of Ubuntu or - I think - even any Debian distribution installer.\nAnyway launch Terminal and paste following commands there to install Grub Repair.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install boot-repair\n\nAfter installation, launch Boot Repair using Bash and try default repair.

I was using UNetbootin on my laptop to retreive Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and create a live CD. I wanted to use Ubuntu to remove a virus that I have in Windows XP on my home PC. Now when I boot my laptop, I am asked to select either Windows 7 or UNetbootin. If I select UNetbootin, it appears that Ubuntu is installed on my PC because I don't have the CD/DVD loaded but Ubuntu runs. In ADD/REMOVE programs, only UNetbootin appears, no Ubuntu. Can someone offer some advice? I thought I was saving the Ubuntu iso to my laptop hard drive so I could later create the Ubuntu live CD to use in my home PC.\n\nA: The actual problem could be, while creating the ubuntu live cd, you have possibly specified some drive (C: or D: or E: something like that, which is a partition of your present hard drive). You might have failed to locate the drive letter of your removable media.\nThis has caused the installation of ubuntu into that partition instead of the usb-flash-drive. The drive now behaves as if it were a usb drive that is attached to the computer, and so, you are getting an option to boot from the so called virtual drive.\nPlease check this.\n\nA: You can try with the wubi installer then, it will install the complete operating system on any partition you like, just make sure there is enough space available on the partition. Also use ubuntu 12.10 or less version, since there is wubi is not supported for 13.04 distro. \nfor wubi installation instructions, you might need to check this\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/windows-installer\ndownload it, and mount the ubuntu iso using daemon tools or some other such software, and then run the downloaded wubi.exe. After installation completes, reboot and wait for the ubuntu installation to complete. This will install complete operating system. Once your work is over, you can safely uninstall the whole operating system by uninstalling the wubi from Control Panel -> Add-Remove Programs. Hope this does. \n", "Q: Environmental Variable for current domain I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS Desktop edition\nI want to use environmental variable for currently joined domain just like I use $USER to bring current user.\nFrom what I read there are few variables for that, but none seems to work for me.\nI also cannot see those variables as active when I type env command.\nI would appreciate a solution on how to enable that variable or how to make my own variable by pulling current domain name from the system somehow.\n\nA: maybe this ?\nDOMAIN=$( hostname )\n\n", "Q: The search in Ubuntu Software Center disappears \nI'm using Ubuntu 13.04 64-bit in vmware 9.

If i resize my window to that size, the Search disappears because there's no space to it be shown.\n", "Q: Optimal fix for post login freeze in Kubuntu due to PulseAudio The following programs which starts with Kubuntu 13.04 freeze my KDE desktop for about 10 seconds.\n\n\n*\n\n*start-pulseaudio-kde\n\n*start-pulseaudio-x11\n\n\nWhen I remove the startup entries from /etc/xdg/autostart, the login proceeds normally.\nSounds work fine.\nI want to know, is it safe to removing those startup entries?\nIs it compulsory to launch above programs?\nPlease mention, if there is an alternative fix. I suspect this happened after installing fglrx video driver.\nThanks!\n\nA: The purpose of the start-pulseaudio-kde and start-pulseaudio-x11 scripts is to integrate Pulseaudio with Phonon.\nOf course will Phonon will also run and play sounds without Pulseaudio but applications that rely on a functional Pulseaudio sound server will not be able to run then. This will also be true for devices that are loaded by Pulseaudio rather than with Phonon.\nBelow are two examples to illustrate the difference:\n\n*\n\n*Pulseaudio-Phonon integration loaded (default):\n\n\n\n*Pulseaudio-Phonon integration not loaded:\n\nNote that only in the first instance we will have access to audio devices as defined by a pulseaudio module. In this case this is the internal sound card, and an attached Airport Express. In the second instance we will only see the \"Pulseaudio Sound Server\" which can not further be controled.\nStill, pulseaudio will be loaded and will run in the background, and both scripts can be run later if we had not put them in autostart.\nIn case you do not need to control Pulseaudio with Phonon you are probably safe to delete the above scripts or their corresponding .desktop files which will call these scripts but you will break the Pulseaudio integration with Phonon when doing so.\nThe delay issue when loading pulseaudio is related to a malfunction of module-x11-xsmp or of Avahi (see Pulseaudio Bug #58758). There is active effort to get this bug fixed, hopefully soon.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Software center in Ubuntu 13.04 crashes when opened I am using Ubuntu 13.04 with Gnome 3.8.1.When I try to open Ubuntu Software center, it simply crashes.\nSomebody please help me out.

It will re-install the software-center and reset your settings.\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall software-center\n\nBut for reconfigure a program you can use:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure software-center --force\n\n\nA: I also had software-center crash on launch after the Ubuntu 13.04 upgrade. It turned out to be in import error in the ubuntu-sso-login. I resolved it by reinstalling the oauthlib python package\nsudo pip install --upgrade oauthlib\n\n\nA: I had same proble which I solved by deleting /home/user/.cache/software-center folder.\n\nA: it can happen when you add a new but mismatched source. It should be written in the error message then. If it is the problem, remove the source line.\n", "Q: How to replace Plymouth with Xsplash? I'm using Ubuntu 13.04 with MATE desktop, and I would like to replace Plymouth with good old Xsplash. But I have no idea how to do that...\n\nA: You don't.  Not only is Plymouth an integral part of Ubuntu, but xsplash was removed from the archive.\nPlymouth is more than simply eye candy to look at during boot.  It multiplexes console access among multiple startup tasks that may need user attention.  This functionality is required to use upstart and thus, get faster boot times.\n", "Q: Beginner question: Put script in start up?

Put your script in wherever it needs to be, then specify the full path to it (For example, /home/begtognen/script.sh).\nHopefully that will run that script on startup. I use this to start my Thunderbird whenever I login.\n\nA: Save your script somewhere with executable permissions:  \nchmod +x /path/to/script\n\nIn unity dash, search for startup applications in command options, select your script to enable it to be run on every startup\n\nA: You can use ~/.xprofile to add commands executed after X login.\n", "Q: Ubuntu virtual display help?

I want to know that if, in a LiveUSB Ubuntu, we install any other external softwares (for example, AVG Antivirus), can this pendrive (with the external softwares installed) be used on another computer and still be able to use this external software?\nEDITED\nI have installed kubuntu using universal usb installer and created a live kubuntu in my pendrive. While booting kubuntu it asked for two options 1)Try Kubuntu or 2)Install Kubuntu. I have clicked Try Kubuntu option and it went to the live kubuntu (not installed) desktop. Then i tried to install vlc using the given tutorial and it too were succesful. After installation of VLC I opened It and run some videos also.\nBut when i restarted the computer and used \"Try Kubuntu\"  option, for my surprice i was unable to find the installed VLC player in the kubuntu. Can any one tell me what is the problem how i can rectify this.\n\nA: Yes, you can install additional software in a pendrive created with that method and yes it can run in multiple computers but sometimes you can find hardware incompatibilities that will prevent you from running it.\nI use quite often a USB hard disk with Ubuntu installed to repair Windows computers and it boots most of the time.

Her last installation of Ubuntu 12.04 (upgraded from 11.?) crapped out and locked up.  I'm in the process of recovering her /home information to my NAS for her to reload her files onto the new hard drive I installed.  I can't seem to find an installer without that god awful wubi.exe crap.  Can someone please point me to the installer that does not first insist I'm running Winblows first?\nI have one, and only one Windows machine that my daughter uses to play SIMS (off the network).  Other than that every one of my machines is either Linux (Fedora/Ubuntu) or a Mac (my other daughter).  I wouldn't have the Windows machine if she had a Mac too, because SIMS runs on Apple Mac's.

If not, then my daughters laptop's will become Fedora Laptops.\nThank you,\nBill\n\nA: There are several things you can do with the Ubuntu Desktop version (the *.iso file) that you download from the Ubuntu site here. You can:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run the Wubi installer, to install within Windows\n\n*Boot a Live CD/USB version where you can boot Ubuntu directly from the CD/USB\n\n*Install Ubuntu onto the hard disk\n\n\nWhen you make a bootable CD/USB with this *.iso file, and:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you insert the CD/USB while you are inside Windows, you'll be presented with the Wubi installer\n\n*If you boot from that CD/USB as you are starting your machine, you'll be presented with an option to either \"Try Ubuntu\" or \"Install Ubuntu\" to the hard disk.\n\n\nWhat you're looking for is that last point. So, create a bootable USB/CD from that *.iso file that you downloaded, and insert it into that computer with the RAW disk, and you'll be able to install Ubuntu onto it.\n", "Q: wifi doesn't work in software center i have a public wifi network which has wep security. it requires a key to establish connection and a username and password when i open a browser to surf.\nbut in software center there is no demand of username and password hence i can't use it to install anything on my ubuntu 12.04 LTS.\nplease give solution for this.\n\nA: You should be launching a web browser first (Firefox/Chrome/etc), in all likelihood.\nWithin the browser, your access point (router, etc) should be providing you a login at that  point so you can authenticate in, get proper access out to the net, and at which point you should be able to get Software Center functionality.\nTry opening a web browser, and see if you get auth requests from the access point.\n\nA: Well i found the answer...\njust open the terminal(ctrl+Alt+t) and type:\nsudo gedit /etc/apt/apt.conf\n\nenter your password if required.\nNow this will open the apt.conf file in /etc/apt folder, here you can see your proxy\nand port settings. in my case it is:\nAcquire::http::proxy \"http://<a>172.18.0.1:3128/</a>\";\nAcquire::https::proxy \"https://<a>172.18.0.1:3128/</a>\";\nAcquire::ftp::proxy \"ftp://<a>172.18.0.1:3128/</a>/\";\nAcquire::socks::proxy \"socks://<a>172.18.0.1:3128/</a>\";\n\nnow you have to just edit it by inserting your username and password for the network\nlike this:\nAcquire::http::proxy \"http://username:password@your.network.proxy:port/\";\nAcquire::https::proxy \"https://username:password@your.network.proxy:port/\";\nAcquire::ftp::proxy \"ftp://username:password@your.network.proxy:port/\";\nAcquire::socks::proxy \"socks://username:password@your.network.proxy:port/\";\n\nnow save this....and you are done!!!\nHappyUbuntu\n", "Q: WARNING: The OpenGL rendering context obtained on X display I've installed bumblebee with this tutorial\nhttp://eternalvoid.net/tutorials/linux-optimus-gt650m/\nand when I try optirun i've got black screen & this:\n$ optirun glxspheres\nPolygons in scene: 62464\nVisual ID of window: 0x21\nXlib:  extension \"NV-GLX\" missing on display \":8\".\n[VGL] WARNING: The OpenGL rendering context obtained on X display\n[VGL]    :8 is indirect, which may cause performance to suffer.\n[VGL]    If :8 is a local X display, then the framebuffer device\n[VGL]    permissions may be set incorrectly.\nContext is Indirect\nOpenGL Renderer: Gallium 0.4 on llvmpipe (LLVM 0x301)\n[VGL] ERROR: OpenGL error 0x0500\n[VGL] ERROR: in readpixels--\n[VGL]    310: Could not Read Pixels\nLenovo y580, Ubuntu 12.04 x64, NVIDIA ver.driver 319.17\nIt's a problem with driver, configuration or something else?\n\nA: I GUESS, it is a problem with the nvidia driver.

Still it lags a lot.\n\nI don't know the details, but in such cases is either, graphics card incompatible (if it's only the animations and no the real RAW performance) or a hardware failure, like memory or HDD.\nTroubleshooting this may prove not be easy. You need to install the privative Nvidia drivers if you haven't done so. If you don't see improvement in the graphics performance, then be almost assured that is bad RAM  modules or the Hard Disk failing. The hard disk can be tested if you use a Live system (should be USB to properly measure the fastest performance, since CD's are slow), bad memory modules come often accompanied with other random errors but it worth a shot testing it.\nAs a final test, you should also check if your BIOS settings are optimum, and the BIOS is updated, your laptop isn't filled with dust (dust tends to traps heat, and the system throttle performance when hot).\nYou should probably noticed by now, that I could still list more reasons, since system performance could be affected even if the combination of hardware components/software is not adequate and finding out the perfect balance is, well... difficult.\n\nA: You will seldom get optimum speed with dual boot, but it should be good at most of time.\nYou may have to clean RAM from within ubuntu and reboot to ubuntu first.\nTo clean RAM\nAs root\n#: free -m\nverify actual RAM status\n#: sync\nForce changed blocks to disk, update the super block.\n#: echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches\nWriting to this will cause the kernel to drop caches, dentries and inodes from memory, causing that memory to become free.\n", "Q: Permanent chmod 777 How can I set chmod 777 for my lamp server?\nI am the owner of the www folder (sudo chown -R martin www).\nI have changed the permissions of all files (sudo chmod 777 -R www).\nI don't know why, but my website is working only with chmod 777.

See Why should /var/www not have chmod 777?\nI suspect what you really want to do is to set the directories to 755 and, either leave the files alone, or set them to 644. For this you can use the find command e.g.\nTo change all the directories to 755:\nfind /var/www -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \\;\n\nTo change all the files to 644:\nfind /var/www -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \\;\n\nAlso, to give permissions for files to be seen in browser, use:\nchown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/\n\nIf your www directory is not in /var, change /var/www with the right way.\nUpdate: Any new files copied to the folder /var/www would not have your custom set permissions.

Can I burn that image on that CD using overburn (those programs don't have that option, I use to do that on Windows but never on GNU/Linux) or do I need to buy larger CD?\n\nA: Besides a DVD, you have several other options.\n\n\n*\n\n*Super Grub2 disk. Burn the beta5 (or probably any later version) to a CD, and then put the ISO on a flash drive or something in a directory called /boot-isos/. Boot SG2D and select detect loop bootable isos. (Note that SG2D only searches drives for loop bootable ISOs that were detected when SG2D was booted, you don't seem to be able to detect a drive afterwards.)     \n\n*Ubuntu ISOs are \"hybrid\" ISOs, which means you can copy them to a flash drive using dd and directly boot off of that. Also, SG2D above is also a Hybrid ISO\n\n*UNetbootin and various other tools will copy a ISO file into a flash drive and make it bootable, if you are reluctant to use dd (common nickname is \"destroy data\" because the syntax is a little weird and mistakes can be tough to recover from.)\n\n*U3 smart Flashdrives let you load the ISO file after creating a partition. It will then emulate a CD-ROM, even one with more space than 700 MB providing you set it up with enough space. Unfortunately, they stopped selling these back in 2009. This is a fantastic option for ISO files that are problematic to load, \"loop boot\", or \"chainload\" via Grub2. I use u3-tool to remove the inital software and replace it with my choice. You can get this via apt-get from the Ubuntu repositories. \n\n*isostick seems like a more expensive way to get modern hardware that does the same thing as buying a vintage U3 flash drive off of ebay\n\n\nA: k3b-2.8.2 allowed me to do a (relatively small and non-configurable) overburn, while xfburn wasn't allowing it (reporting low space)\n\nA: You probably won't find a CD that will (naturally) support that size file, and overburning isn't recommended due to issues.\nI'd recommend using a DVD instead, or if that's not an option, a USB drive.\nEDIT: I'd emphasize trying to get a DVD... I personally had many issues with using my 8 GB USB drive.  The first time I attempted a DVD install was fully successful.\n\nA: Of late, I've found dd to be the most reliable way of copying an ISO to a flash drive, and I think that's what you're going to end up doing because they are cheap, common, and large enough. unetbootin has not worked reliably for me the last several times I've used it.\nUse \nif=filename.iso of=/dev/usbdevice\n\nwith filename  and usbdevice replaced by the correct values for your system, and you're good to go.\nWhen using dd, always be careful that the input file and the output file are what you want them to be! You can overwrite the contents of your hard drive if you're not careful!!!\n\nA: You can't burn it to a single layer DVD or split it. What you can do is mount it with something like Daemon Tools and then rip that your hard disk. Once it's in your hard drive and no longer in ISO format you can either shrink it to single layer size with something like DVDShrink or you can possibly split it with something like IFOEdit if you know what you are doing. I would recommend using DVDShrink as it can get complicated to split with IFOEdit if you are not very experienced in doing this.\n", "Q: How did I do this? - File content removed! first of all, thank you for your contribute to this forum! I switched to ubuntu a few months ago for working reasons and these pages are a great help!\nNow, getting to the point:\nI was trying to count a specific pattern in a text file:\ngrep -c [pattern] [filename]\nNow: the pattern was: 'greater than' sign, i.e.:  >\nthus the command I gave was: grep -c > [filename]\nI got this message: \nUsage: grep [OPTION]... PATTERN [FILE]...\nTry `grep --help' for more information.\nBut now the text file was empty! (fortunately I had a backup...).\nWhy? Did I mess up in some previous operation or was it the last command I gave? I am just trying to make sense of this.\n\nA: You're looking at output redirection (Bash). By redirecting the regular output 'stdout' to filename, you're overwriting it. Error output, 'stderr' is still shown (in your terminal by default), though. That was the help text you saw.\nTo actually use the > character in grep as a character to match on, escape it in your shell (Bash), e.g.\ngrep -c \\> myfile\n\nPutting it between quotes, '>' will also work.\nA snippet from the above link explains redirection more generally:\nCOMMAND_OUTPUT >\n  # Redirect stdout to a file.\n  # Creates the file if not present, otherwise overwrites it.\n\n  ls -lR > dir-tree.list\n  # Creates a file containing a listing of the directory tree.\n[..]\n1>filename\n  # Redirect stdout to file \"filename.\"\n1>>filename\n  # Redirect and append stdout to file \"filename.\"\n2>filename\n  # Redirect stderr to file \"filename.\"\n2>>filename\n  # Redirect and append stderr to file \"filename.\"\n&>filename\n  # Redirect both stdout and stderr to file \"filename.\"\n\n\nA: The previous answer is technically accurate, but I think is circumventing the user's overall knowledge of what they were trying to do.  Let's focus on what you did wrong, and then rewrite the command so you can actually find the entries of \">\" in the file instead.\n(Explanation of why the file got dumped)\nIf you use > at the end of a line (try \"ls > directory.txt\") you'll wipe out directory.txt [if it exists], and input the results of the command.  If you use >>, it simply appends (adds to the end) of any existing file.  \"grep\" didn't realize you were actually searching for \">\" instead of wanting to pipe the output into the file you intended to search.  As a result, it simply dumped nothing into the file you had data in.\nIn your case, you probably wanted to use this instead:\ngrep -c -- '>' filename.ext\n\nLet us know if that fixes your problem!\n", "Q: how to properly install ubuntu on imac?

I read somewhere that bootcamp is not the best solution for Ubuntu 13.04 (some problems could appear because access to disk is \"emulated\")... \nHow can  I install Ubuntu 13.04 properly? \n\nA: You can download the ubuntu image for mac from here. You need to burn it on a disk (a DVD), or make a bootable USB drive from the ISO. You can refer this link to know how to make bootable USB drive. Finally, follow the installation instructions on this page to do boot with that USB, and install Ubuntu on your iMac.\n", "Q: LibreOffice 4.03 compatibility with MS Office 2010 docs I apologize for the repetitiveness of this question, but I just yesterday decided to use Ubuntu 13.04 as my only operating system and am trying to figure a few things out. No, I don't mean figuring out things with Ubuntu as I have been messing around with the system for some time on older machines and on VMs. \nMy question is, since the release of LibreOffice 4.03, are we still looking at any incompatibilities when read/write MS Office .docx files? The university that I attend requires us to turn in weekly projects in Word 2010 .docx format. I would love it if I could use the office suite included with Ubuntu, which just happens to be LibreOffice 4.03, but I have read numerous articles in the past that there are some incompatibilities such as tables not displaying correctly and some items getting aligned differently.  These problems absolutely cannot happen on any of my projects; otherwise, my professor will dock points on each project. Can anybody confirm if these problems still exist?\nI know it is quite easy to get MS Office 2010 to work through PlayOnLinux, but I want to know if LibreOffice is totally compatible with .docx, .xslx, and .pptx file formats or if I still need to save in the old Office 2003 format. Thank you for any help you guys could provide!\n\nA: It has gotten/is getting a lot better, but unfortunately no. Simple documents are ok, but especially if you complex documents and/or you have to collaborate with other students, it can be hell! You're probably better of using Google Docs.\nIt is however possible to keep Ubuntu as your only operating system! Although you can not run Office natively on Ubuntu, you can run it via Crossover (see here). Crossover is the commercial version of wine (if you know wine, otherwise look it up, brilliant piece of software).\nMy girlfriend uses it for a couple of months now and it works really well. You can get a free trial for Crossover to test it out (and if you don't do anything after the trial they will almost always email you with a discount offer :P).\nOf course you can also try to do it yourself using wine, but that is a bit more complicated (you can read here how to do it).\nAnother solution is running windows in virtualbox, not as neat, but still very handy.\n\nA: Yesterday I was testing several 2010 documents. The only problem I found was with footer and foot notes. Tables were correct. Images were correct. I then did a bit of searching and found that most of this problems will be dealt with in LibreOffice 4.1\nI also did test out a document from Office 2013. It looked perfect. Am guessing Microsoft did a bit of work on compatibility.\n", "Q: Ubuntu server as an internet server How can I configure an Ubuntu server installation to provide internet access to private network, such that machines on the private network can access the internet through the Ubuntu server? The machine has two NICs of course. \n\nA: *\n\n*You need to use Ubuntu as a firewall/gateway router. Please check this Scenario\n\nOr you need Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) provides the ability for one computer to share its Internet connection with another computer. please check the wiki Internet/ConnectionSharing\n\nA: Unless you are prepared to deal with a lot of automated attacks on your server, I would highly discourage this.  Your router will provide a level of protection between you and the internet.\nWhat exactly are you trying to accomplish?  There might be a better way to do what you want.  I have my ubuntu box acting as a DHCP server with dockerized Pi-Hole installed.  It blocks a good majority of ads and allows me to fine-tune DHCP settings that the router won't let me.\nIf you really, really need to have the server facing externally, I would recommend that you harden the server significantly by denying all access to the internal LAN unless the request originated from within the LAN.\n", "Q: How can I find the URL for a flash video in Firefox? At Nasul TV is a TV recorded show, free. \nI want to be able to find the URL for the video and then to use wget to download it. How can I achieve this?\n\nA: More detail is needed. What do you mean by \"viewing a link\"? Normally you can find the link to video files in the page source, or via the Firebug network tab (if you don't have Firebug, you should get it). It should be something that ends in \".flv\", or sometimes \".mp4\", and once you have it it's easy to download: just open a terminal and type:\nwget \"http://www.nasul.tv/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/nasul1305.m4v\" -O filename.m4v\n\n(with the quotes).\n", "Q: Going back to a previous Ubuntu state 15 years ago GoBack came out which let Windows users revert changes and restore a computer to a previous state. It did this by imposing a journaling system underneath the OS - at the block level, not the file level - and letting you roll back changes.\nIs there anything like that for Linux? It's easy to do this inside VirtualBox, but I'd like this to be for my main top-level machine. \nHow easy would it be to make a virtual machine be one's normal machine? How would one go about this?\n\nA: There was an old version called TimeVault but the one I found similar to what you are looking for would be Back In Time which was inspired by TimeVault itself. It takes snapshops of predefined parts of the system. You can customize this to take the whole system.\nThe PPA explains that you only need to do 3 things: \n\n\n*\n\n*Where to save snapshots\n\n*What to backup\n\n*Backup frequency (manual, every hour, every day, every month)\n\n\nThe Stable releases can be found in the stable branch\nYou can install it via terminal with:\nIf in KDE type sudo apt-get install backintime-kde \nIf in GNOME type sudo apt-get install backintime-gnome\nYou can also install it via Software Center:\n\nUbuntu also comes with Deja-Dup by default which supports backing up externally to Ubuntu One, Amazon or even RackSpace. Similar to BackInTime, you can select what to backup, how often and how to restore.\n\n\nA: What you describe is a feature known as filesystem snapshots.  LVM implements this in the block layer, and the btrfs filesystem has it built into the filesystem itself.  Practically speaking both are still not usable for the average person for several reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Current LVM snapshots perform badly when you create more than one, which rather limits their usefulness.  This should be improved with the multi snapshot feature still being developed.\n\n*btrfs is still in heavy development and not considered stable enough for production use\n\n*There are no simple to use gui tools written to make use of these features\n\n\nIf you are feeling adventurous and want to play around with these systems, preferably in a throw away system you don't care if you blow up, then here's how:\nFor LVM, you will need to format the system to use LVM when you install.  You should read the Ubuntu wiki entry on LVM.  You use lvcreate -s to create a snapshot of the volume, then you can make changes, install packages, etc, and you can mount the snapshot to see the old state of files, and if you chose, revert the system to that state at the next boot with lvconvert --merge.\nFor btrfs, you need to use the btrfs filesystem, and then install the apt-btrfs-snapshot package.  This package will automatically create a snapshot before apt modifies any packages, and provides a command line utility to view and manipulate the snapshots.\n\nA: Luis, as usual, gave you a very nice and detailed answer.\nI would just add, Linux is not Windows and it is rare you would ever need to roll back your system.\nFor the most part, you can back up /home, any system files you manually edit, and keep a list of installed applications.\nSee: http://savvyadmin.com/backup-and-restore-package-lists-in-ubuntu/\nand How to list all installed packages\nIt is then very easy to restore with a fresh install from a live \"cd\".\n", "Q: qtfm: error while loading shared libraries: Install qtfm, on 12.04 but it would not open.\nOpening in a terminal yields this message:\nqtfm: error while loading shared libraries: libmagic.so.1: wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS64\nHow do I fix?\n\nA: You are using a 32-bit program on a 64-bit install, and missing the 32-bit libraries needed to run the program. The failure is due to the program needing the 32-bit version, and the 64-bit version being loaded instead.\nYou can run sudo apt-get install libmagic1:i386 (in 12.10 or newer) to install the 32-bit version, which should hopefully resolve the issue. On 12.04, you will have to be running the 32-bit version to use the 32-bit version of qtfm. On 64-bit you will have to use a 64-bit build of the application, either pre-built, or installing from source.\n", "Q: Split Screen using HDMI Xubuntu 13.04 I've tried to get separate screens for Xubuntu 13.04 so I can browse on my laptop and use my TV to watch films via the HDMI port, but I'm unable to find a way to do it.

I got an ASUS laptop bought in late 2012, that came with Windows 7 pre-installed. I upgraded it to Windows 8 (due to low cost of it) and now , after booting Ubuntu (13.04 64bit) form usb, the installer cannot see my Windows installation - it only shows it, as it was free/unallocated space ( and it isn't). I tried using gParted to determine what's wrong, but I got an error with GPT partitioning system.

My guess is that you had an EFI-based Windows 7 installation, but when you installed Windows 8, you wiped that out and installed in BIOS mode. Windows' partitioning tools are known to do an incomplete wipe of GPT data when converting a disk to MBR mode, so this seems plausible.\nFortunately, the solution is easy: Use FixParts on the disk. IIRC, this program is part of the gdisk package in Ubuntu; or you can download it separately, as described on the FixParts page. When you launch it, FixParts will complain about the stray GPT data and offer to erase it. Tell it to do so, then exit from FixParts by typing q at the main menu. When you launch the Ubuntu installer, the problem should go away.\nOne caveat about what follows: Be sure that the Ubuntu installer is booted in BIOS mode. If you launch it in EFI mode, it might try to install that way, and the result will be unbootable. Check the mode by dropping to a shell and looking for a directory called /sys/firmware/efi. If that directory is present, you've booted in EFI mode and should fiddle with your boot settings to force a BIOS-mode boot. If the /sys/firmware/efi directory is absent, you've probably booted in BIOS mode and it should work fine.\n", "Q: Nemo, open as root, Ubuntu 13.04 I replaced nautilus with nemo in Ubuntu 13.04 from these excellent instructions:\nHow to completely remove Unity, and replace it with Cinnamon?\nHowever, I can't \"open folder as root\" from Nemo.

I am using 13.04 trying to edit or drag and drop files but since all the folders are owned by root and assigned to the group \"root\" I am not allow to do this.\nI added my current username to the \"root\" group and still I am not able to edit.\nI don't want to have to login as root to do this, or change all the folders group to something else.\nWhat are my options.\n\nA: We are able to run Nautilus with root privileges with\nsudo -i nautilus\n\nbut we need to be extra careful with what we do then.\n\nRoot is powerful and most measures to protect our system from accidents will not work any more. Nobody will stop Root from doing stupid things. There will be no warnings.\n\nSo here is my advice to people who need to run Nautilus as root:\n\n\n*\n\n*Only do so for this one single task. Quit Nautilus after you are done to not accidentally do unwanted things as root which are meant to be done as a user.\n\n*Do not drag and drop. Only a slightly misplaced movement of the mouse may result in a broken system. In the worst case you will not be able to boot any more.\n\n*Do not bulk delete files or folders. You may have included an important system file by accident.\n\n*Do not copy files to the wrong place. Ubuntu has a very strict file system layout. It expects files to be in the place they are meant to and it does not expect other files to be there. All files we need to modify should be in our HOME directory.\n\n*Do not execute applications. All applications you run by clicking on a launcher, a binary, or a script will also be run as root. This rarely will be a good idea.\n\n*Never run Nautilus as root when you are a beginner. Only when understanding the file hierarchy and permissions you hopefully will be able to realize what is a good idea and what not. Before that you should for the sake of your system stability refrain from running Nautilus (or any other graphical application) with root privileges.\n\n\nNevertheless it will be fine to occasionally run Nautilus as root. I do so too, and command line typos may equally lead to severe system damages, especially when run  recursively as root.\n\nA: Try using the\nsudo\n\ncommand before your command.\nThis gives you root permission.

It failed to reboot  as soon as I restarted 13.04 after installing it. This occurred several times so I can't chalk it up to fate as I see on Googles others have had this problem. \nThus I used my copy of 12.04 that is a Canonical provided copy to start the installation and just upgraded the OS after a minimal install with 12.04 and 12.10 using 32 bit copies. I normally use the 64 bit variety of Ubuntu but wanted to go ahead and test out 13.04 to keep up with what improvements the fantastic and dedicated community of developers and engineers have in store for the faithful.  I upgraded my system using the recommended script at debianhelp.wordpress.com and after using this script, I am getting a \"failed to download repository information\" error when I use the Anarchist logo upgrade button on this version of Ubuntu.  \nI noticed my updates seemed a little slow  so I used the \"what is the best server for my location\" test in the software and updates window to tell me the best location for updates for my computer.

Diffuse is installed on my workstation and plays well with Mercurial so I often use it for diff'ing.  However, I also am using a Python virtualenv to use some different modules in a more controlled setting (easier to ship off to other people).  When I try to run Diffuse from within my virtualenv (here named sandbox) it pukes:\n(sandbox)nickt@aiguadassi:/home/codes/nickt/Tape-Worms/Code\n$ diffuse bread.py # fail...\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/bin/diffuse\", line 124, in <module>\n    import pygtk\nImportError: No module named pygtk\n\nOutside it works just fine...\n(sandbox)nickt@aiguadassi:/home/codes/nickt/Tape-Worms/Code\n$ deactivate \nnickt@aiguadassi:/home/codes/nickt/Tape-Worms/Code\n$ diffuse bread.py # works fine.\n\nI assume Diffuse is a Python app and is relying on finding modules in the environment; is there a way to have it use the 'global' environment (e.g. via an alias)?  I'm not sure what the program is doing with respect to the environment...is it searching through PATH for modules, trying to use whatever which python turns up...\n\nA: If the first line of /usr/bin/diffuse looks like:\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nit will run in Python inside your virtualenv. Most Python applications should set it to:\n#!/usr/bin/python\n\nwhich will run it with the system Python. If this is wrong, it might be a bug either in Diffuse or in its packaging in Debian/Ubuntu.\n\nA: Another option is to add an alias to your ~/.bashrc file:\nalias diffuse='/usr/bin/python /usr/bin/diffuse'\n\nThis prevents things breaking when diffuse is updated.\n", "Q: Repository to upgrade Sigil to latest version on (K)ubuntu I'd like to upgrade Sigil to the latest version (currently it is 0.7.2), and I'm looking for a repository that provides it.\nThe Sigil website lists some repositories for various Linux distros, but the ubuntu one (the one I need) doesn't seems updated anymore; from there, I can only get version 0.6.2.\nThere are some other repositories beside this one?\nEDIT: I'm using Kubuntu 12.04 Precise\n\nA: most safety way to upgrade your sigil package is from source code... because this package doesn't include on official repository in Ubuntu.. \n", "Q: Customizing ubuntu studio 13.04 I have recently switched from original ubuntu 12.10 to ubuntu studio 13.04.

If I type rm -r some and hit tab, nothing more autocompletes. So then I type a bit more, say rm -r some\\ s. Now if I hit tab, it autocompletes but removes the \\ characters giving rm -r some spacey directory. This, however, won't delete some spacey directory.

Is there anyway I can get rid of it?  This seems like dangerous behaviour in the context of a permanent delete command. \n\nA: Tab completion is working here for directories and files with spaces in their names.\nAs you can see, Linux does not like spaces in file names.

Helix 3 is a highly specialized Linux distro for forensics professionals.  You can almost certainly recover your data from this, but it isn't the most user friendly.

So I have a bit of a dilemma, I want to use Ubuntu on my home desktop. The problem is that I use a fancy sound card that Ubuntu doesn't support. I use an HT Omega Striker 7.1. The manufacturer only makes Windows drivers. \nAfter an exhaustive amount of searching I have found two things. The first is that there is a forum post that has been repeated over and over again that is supposed to contain drivers for Ubuntu but in fact only contains one uncompiled C source file that references a ton of other files that don't come in the downloaded compressed file. So it is worthless.\nThe second is that supposedly Suse does support/work with my sound card. I am in the process of downloading OpenSuse to test this out. But in the mean time I would really like to know how, if it does in fact work via a Live CD test, would I go about extracting that driver from OpenSuse and using it on Ubuntu?\nThanks!\n\nA: The \"drivers\" in linux are kernel modules. So if the sound card works in SUSE it should work in any distro with the same kernel version or higher.\nIf not you could build a custom kernel and enable it.\nOf course you could always get a linux compatible sound card ;)\n", "Q: from livecd find the installed kernel version on ht hard disk my ubuntu is not booting. the recovery mode also has a problem. when machine boots it says Ubuntu Linux 2.6.32-37 server but boot does not work.

I've attempted to create a new .lang file for getting Gedit to recognize the Julia programming language. I have read the tutorial, the reference document and the wiki page Gedit/NewLanguage, and I believe the file to be correct. However, upon restarting gedit after copying the new julia.lang file to /usr/share/gtksourceview-3.0/language-specs/, a .jl file is indeed recognized and the syntax highlighting menu is set to julia, but no actual highlighting occurs.\nThinking that I might have done something wrong, I tried instead using an existent language file, for a similar language (Matlab), and only changed the header metadata into:\n<language id=\"julia\" _name=\"Julia\" version=\"2.0\" _section=\"Scientific\">\n  <metadata>\n    <property name=\"mimetypes\">text/x-julia;application/x-julia</property>\n    <property name=\"globs\">*.jl</property>\n    <property name=\"line-comment-start\">#</property>\n  </metadata>\n\nEverything else was kept exactly as-is, and I saved the file as julia.lang. Still, when reopening gedit the same issue occurs. What's more, if I select the Matlab entry from the syntax highlighting menu, the formatting is made correctly (according to Matlab rules), even though both matlab.lang and julia.lang have exactly the same syntax definitions!\nWhat could I be doing wrong? This guy seemed to have the same problem, but it was never revealed in that thread how he solved it (if he ever did). Any ideas?\n\nUpdate: my mistake was indeed not changing the context id as pointed out by @carandraug in his answer. I did, however, have other issues which I'll note here in case they're of help to anyone:\n\n*\n\n*I reused the \"shell-like-comment\" definition from def.lang for Julia's single-line comments, but that was getting me a lot of errors. It turns out when a reference context is used, the id attribute cannot be set. Changing from <context id=\"comment\" ref=\"def:shell-like-comment\" /> to <context ref=\"def:shell-like-comment\" /> made the errors go away. I think the reference document (and the tutorial as well) should mention this caveat. I've edited the wiki page to point this out.\n\n*Before I figured the problem with the comments context, I commented out its definition, but then I started getting a \"style 'def:string' not defined\" error. When I uncommented the definition, this error disappeared. I'm not sure what caused it in the first place (considering that indeed a <style id=\"string\"> was defined in def.lang). Any clarifications about this are welcome in the comments :-)\n\nA final suggestion to anyone developing new language highlight definitions for gedit: don't forget to run gedit from the command line and look at the console output!\n\nA: I do not know why your original julia.lang file is not working since you're not showing the source, but the one you based on matlab.lang will not work because there's no context inside <definitions> with the same id you mentioned for <language>.\nBasically, you're saying the id of this language is julia, but there is no context with that id being defined. So find <context id=\"matlab\" (line 149 of the current HEAD), and change it to julia.\nA lang file is usually organized as a bunch of individual contexts for the language features being highlighted, which are then grouped in the end into a main block with the same id as the language, and references to the other contexts.\n", "Q: How do you sucessfuly use the uninstaller for Ubuntu?

I have Chromium browser running as Ubuntu Desktop, when i launch my system i need to set the Chromium browser zoom percentage to 79%, so that it always remain default.\nUsing command line, how do i set that zoom percentage?\n$ chromium-browser --incognito -kiosk www.google.com\n\nA: Run the following in command line to set the Chromium browser zoom percentage to 79%\nchromium-browser --force-device-scale-factor=0.79\n\n\nA: Chrome published a very limited list of command line switches. With Chromium we are more sure. Try to search this list: http://peter.sh/experiments/chromium-command-line-switches/\nthe --ash-host-window-bounds and --force-device-scale-factor switches looks promising, but you should elaborate on that.\n\nA: For Chromium (and Chrome as well, I believe), you can configure the global zoom level in the Zoom setting under the Appearance section. This configuration is saved under ~/.config/chromium/Default/Preferences, in the default_zoom_level section. You should be able to copy that setting from another system, and in your case, potentially set it programatically before starting Chromium. It's not ideal, but it works!\nYou can also configure per-host zoom levels, these settings will appear in the per_host_zoom_levels section.\n", "Q: V4L2 change default setting? I can successfully change the value of the setting I want with v4l2-ctl --set-ctrl=exposure_auto_priority=1 but I want to know how to make that the default setting, the default is 0, which leaves my webcam black, I need it to be default=1\n\nA: If you have Video4Linux Control Pannel, you might try un checking the Exposure_Auto_Priority check box at the bottom and see if that helps...\n\nHope it helps... Good Luck!\n\nA: You can also use the udev subsystem to establish the settings when the device is plugged in or the machine boots.\nFor example, here is how I set the power line frequency on my Logitech HD Pro C920 Webcam, which lsusb says has the USB ID 046d:082d.\nAs root create a new world-readable file /etc/udev/rules.d/99-local-webcam.rules. It contains:\nSUBSYSTEM==\"video4linux\", SUBSYSTEMS==\"usb\", ATTRS{idVendor}==\"046d\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"082d\", PROGRAM=\"/usr/bin/v4l2-ctl --set-ctrl power_line_frequency=1 --device /dev/%k\"\n\nYou can follow the same recipe, modifying the USB ID and the v4l2-ctl parameters to suit your exact needs. You can test the v4l2-ctl parameters from the command line until you are comfortable that they will work, then put that text into the udev rules file.\nThe advantage of this approach is that it \"just works\". Every time the device is plugged in then the settings are applied.  If you are a systems administrator for a lot of machines then you can push out rules files for all your institution's equipment, they aren't used until that USB ID is plugged into the machine.\n\nA: Since the settings will be lost after each boot, you should run a script at session startup to apply values you generate using the Video4Linux Panel.\nTo see the adjusted values type on terminal:\nv4l2-ctl --all\n\nAfter create your script, and add it to your startup session...\nHere is my startup script:\n#!/bin/bash\nv4l2-ctl \\\n--set-ctrl=brightness=150 \\\n--set-ctrl=contrast=51 \\\n--set-ctrl=saturation=32 \\\n--set-ctrl=white_balance_temperature_auto=0 \\\n--set-ctrl=gain=90 \\\n--set-ctrl=power_line_frequency=1 \\\n--set-ctrl=white_balance_temperature=1140 \\\n--set-ctrl=sharpness=24 \\\n--set-ctrl=backlight_compensation=1 \\\n--set-ctrl=exposure_auto=1 \\\n--set-ctrl=exposure_absolute=870 \\\n--set-ctrl=exposure_auto_priority=1\n\nI hope that this helps...\n", "Q: Fixing Windows 8 after removing ubuntu I tried installing Ubuntu (successfully) on my Windows 8 machine so i could develop in c and it worked decently for a while.

At the begining it worked OK, a bit slow but OK ( there is a performance bottleneck on the USB plug, so pretty much better USB 3.0 than USB 2.0 ). \nAfter practicing a bit, upgrading the system, applications and so on ... I was excited ... I went to a tech shop and bought a hi-capacity pendrive (32 Gb) ... I was going to CLONE my Kubuntu main install ( root partition, home partition and swap partition ) on the new pendrive. It was a bit complicated but I managed to do it. I had to adjust Grub, fstab and not many more things ... and it worked, a bit slow ( my laptop hasn't got any USB 3.0 socket ) but worked.\nBesides the slowness, I was very happy with my new pendrive ... it got my highly customized Firefox (more than 30 extensions) , my tuned LibreOffice , my custom KDE effects, Thunderbird (with several IMAP and POP accounts) , Dropbox ... everything ... it was pretty nice. In order to mitigate the slugglishness I fine tuned preload parameters (it was already installed in my main install) , I modified a bit fstab so that /temp , /var/lock , /var/log and /var/run went to tmpfs. I also made a Grub profiling and things got a bit better, not comparable with a hard disk install, but a bit snappier than before. By the way Nepomuk and Akonadi were de-activated on my main install, so after cloning they also were no operative on the pendrive.\nThe initial planned use for my pendrive was homemaking, tinkering and disaster recovery lifeboat.\nI was able to upgrade the system, the kernel, applications ... everything went smooth.\nBut there was one factor I haven't previously thought about ... ... ... the limited amount of write cycles a nand-flash cell can survive before getting corrupt.\nAfter some time LibreOffice stop booting with no apparent reason ... some days later other application followed the same path ... some weeks later the pendrive died. But the first time it happened I sincerely was not fully aware what the problem was ... so I 'decided' it was a low-quality pendrive ... and I bought another (different brand) ... and I repited everything ... and after some weeks the pendrive began suffering the same problems. Then I run badblocks utility and it became more clear ... the nand-flash cells were getting corrupt after some weeks of use ... what a pity !!!\nI pretty much prefer running a fully ultra-customized pendrive than a generic persistent USB live session ... but this was a real showstopper for me. I guess a persistent USB live session will not suffer this kind of problem due to I believe there is less I/O activity in that configuration.\nOn the other hand USB flash installs sometimes has some little problems other USB installs (HDD or SSD) do not have ... regarding with Hibernation and Suspending to memory.\nI would consider two options : internal drive (HDD or SSD) or USB external drive (HDD or SSD). \nRegards.\n\nA: Using a persistent USB \"LiveCD\" has some disadvantages in my experience:\n\n\n*\n\n*On some systems you can get error messages while booting, making the boot time dramatically longer, or even preventing the computer from booting altogether (my computers all do this, unfortunately :p ). I have not found a solution for this (yet)\n\n*There will be a default user with sudo rights and without a password (it can be disabled, but it is not so easy)\n\n*Kernel updates can cause problems, since update-initramfs will trigger something with grub (or something :D), and that doesn't work because casper does not use grub (this should not break the system, but will leave the kernel unconfigured)\nSo if you are just having your class try Ubuntu out, this is a good way to taste the OS, but if you are planning on using Ubuntu full-time, you might consider using a full install instead (either on an internal or an external drive).\n\nA: To be honest the only difference I see is that the non-live sytem will be usually faster and applications can be optimized to work on that specific hardware but you will lost versatility as you'll no longer be able to jump from one computer to another without some compatibility issues. Installations take more space and because of the nature of a thumb drive I think is a priority to keep compatibility and versatility over performance. Another difference is you can install Ubuntu from a live system and your personal configuration in your persistent file won't affect it.\nNow, in my experience I have been using Lubuntu during almost a year in a persistent USB install and I can tell you that it works GREAT! I can install any program I want and keep the system updated. I use my system for development, audio editing sometimes, networking, general internet use, watch movies and video games (wine and common emulation). I don't think your students have any problems installing packages on a live system.\nMy system has a good performance even with the very low writing speed on the device (5 MB/s max). I use a very old computer (Presario F700) and the system has to be tweaked in order to work properly. I had to uninstall the Nouveau drivers and install proprietary drivers from Nvidia so I can have the drive to boot on any computer so far (but not apple computers because they need a special configuration). The system can use hardware acceleration with Nvidia hardware and works fine without hardware acceleration with open source drivers for other brands like AMD or Intel with no issues so far.\nI also have a web server with MySQL working right now. I'm currently writing this from the computer after-mentioned while downloading some stuff. The system can be locked to avoid other users from using it, but as I said it needs some tweaking.\nPersistent USB works great if the user have the time and will to get it work the way they want and I think is great for learning.\nPlease correct me if I made a mistake in my assumptions. I'm a Linux fan but not an expert. :)\nCheers!\n\nA: From a technical point of view there is not much difference in either method. \nI think your decision should be based on more practical considerations. I presume that not all students have the exact same make/model. In fact I would expect pretty much everyone to have a different model. There is a chance that some machines do not include an optical drive. Assuming these are relatively new models, you will be able to boot them from USB. For older models you can only tell by trial and error. Also keep in mind that laptops are notoriously difficult to configure because of the often specialized hardware they contain. Going for a full install on such systems may result in endless hours of troubleshooting. \nI am not trying to disappoint you here - after all installing on such a system can be very educational about the inner workings of computers and operating systems. I am just suggesting you go about this starting as simple as possible. Give your students -and yourself - the flexibility to use ANY of those methods.\n\nA: In a test I did, a Full install to USB booted about five times faster than a Persistent install.\nIt is also true that a Full install can be made more secure and can be updated and upgraded. \nIf the drive will also be used to transfer files to a Windows machine it will need the first partition to be FAT.\nA Persistent install initially has a persistence limit of 4GB however this can be increased using casper-rw and home-rw ext2 partitions. \nProprietary video drivers do not work on a persistent install.\n\nA: If I understand you, you want to know the differences between persistent USB and a full install USB.\nPersistent Live USB: 8GB or more\nFirst, Persistent Live USB takes less space.\nOne can create a non-persistent Live USB with a 4GB USB drive. To create a persistent Live USB you would need a slightly bigger one, say 8GB.\nSecond, Persistent Live USB can be used for installation.\nA persistent Live USB is essentially a copy of the installation DVD. The files in the original ISO remains as is. Updates and future installations are saved in the space designated for keeping the changes. Say, you update Firefox. in a normal installation the old one is replaced. In persistent installation the old one stays as is, the newer version is located in the persistent virtual disk (within the USB) taking up extra space  and sometimes creating problems, for example for kernel updates. Now if you install Ubuntu from this persistent copy into another hard drive the original version of Firefox in the DVD image will get installed.\nBooting a persistent Live USB gives the students access to the \"Install Ubuntu\" icon on the desktop. Students can \"accidentally\" start the install process and delete the contents of the hard drive.\nThird, Persistent Live USB is less secure.\nThere is no login process in the Persistent Live USB. The default user has admin rights and does not need a sudo password to exercise it. This means, a malicious student can boot a persistent USB of another student and easily access stored documents, uninstall or reconfigure applications etc.\nFully installed Ubuntu in an USB: 16GB or more\nFirst, Installation takes more space than keeping the image of the installation DVD, about 9GB.\nOnce installed, the system can be updated, and customized. Uninstalling unneeded software will free up space.\nSecond, Hardware on which the full install is created is important.\nThe Live DVD image in the persistent USB is created with compatibility with most computers in mind. However, once installed on a specific hardware, the installation gets a bit customized for the specific components. This is important particularly if the computer has some parts that require proprietary drivers. Once these drivers are installed, the USB may not work on computers that do not have those specific hardware. Conversely, if the installation is done on a computer that does not need any proprietary drivers, that specific installation may not work on the machines that do need them.\nTherefore, if the goal is to use the USB in different computers, a persistent Live USB may be a better choice than a full installation.\nThird, Full installation is more secure.\nCreation of an user ID and a password is required during installation. This password is needed for any administrative action. One can also set it up to require the password at login.\nAlso see Difference between LiveCD, LiveUSB, full-install, and persistence?\nHope this helps\n\nA: Persistent Ubuntu on USB is better, because a persistent setup gives makes it possible to create user accounts with passwords. (Although other people say different, you just have to go to System Settings → User Accounts and create admin account.)\nIt uses less space than a normal full installation, so the USB flash drive will take longer to wear out, and leaves more space for other files.\n", "Q: Alternative image viewers I dont really like Eye of Gnome (EOG).\nWhat other image viewers are available for Ubuntu?\nI am using gwenview but it takes a long time to load.\n\nA: gThumb\ngThumb is an advanced image viewer and browser. It has many useful features, such as filesystem browsing, slide show, image catalogs, web album creation, camera import, image CD burning, batch file operations and quick image editing features like transformation and color manipulation.\nIt's designed for GNOME desktop environment and uses its platform. For camera import feature, the gPhoto2 library is used.\nsudo apt-get install gthumb\n\n\n\nA: The best one XNVIEW MP is missing. It is something like Faststone image viewer for Windows. 26 Mb size, lots of options, and you can convert formats as well.\nIt is not in the software center, but you can download it from the official site and open it with the software center. Easy.\n\nA: Viewnior\n\nI particularly like Viewnior. It's a very lightweight and fast image viewer - faster than any of the alternatives I've tried:\n\nOne more reason to choose Viewnior is that isn't affected by this image scaling bug that's prevalent in many other GTK-based image viewers (see here for other solutions to this bug).\n\nInstallation\nUbuntu 14.10 and up\nAs of Ubuntu 14.10 Viewnior is now part of the official Ubuntu repositories.

I disabled it using bbswitch, and I'm using bumblebee to run programs using the discrete graphic card.\nI want to know what's going to happen if I remove bbswitch (because it, sometimes, prevents Ubuntu from shutting down) ? Is the discrete GPU going to be always on (and consequently making the laptop too hot) of is bumblebee going to handle this?\nI'm running Ubuntu 13.04\nThank you.\n\nA: bbswitch is essentially the service that monitors the use of the graphics card, and switches it off as and when possible to conserve energy, and reduce heat.

We ran into this problem while packaging some software written in nodejs.\nBecause we can't package each and every dependency separately, we need to ship the node_modules/ directory along with the program. The code is installed into usr/share/<project>/..., and these are the warnings (and errors) that generates:\nW: <project>: extra-license-file usr/share/<project>/node_modules/express/node_modules/mkdirp/LICENSE\nE: <project>: wrong-path-for-interpreter usr/share/<project>/node_modules/request/node_modules/node-uuid/benchmark/bench.gnu (#!/opt/local/bin/gnuplot != /usr/bin/gnuplot)\n\nThere are hundreds of these.\nI understand that all of those errors are relevant and meaningful, but I don't know how to get rid of them without cheating and without packaging each dependency separately. Is there another directory in the FHS in which a directory full of rubbish, like node_modules/, would be okay?\nWe've also looked into running npm install as part of the post install script, but decided we can't do that (for security and maintenance reasons)\n\nA: The warning/errors don't actually seem to have anything to do with the fact that you're installing them into a usr/share/<project>/node_modules directory. AFAICT, you'd be generating them wherever you install them.\nAs the docs mention, Lintian warning/errors can be overridden to silence them. Create a file called <package>.lintian-overrides in the debian directory of the source package. It should look something like:\n<package> binary: wrong-path-for-interpreter *\n<package> binary: extra-license-file *\n\nThough the extra-license-file can be solved easily with this snippet for debian/rules:\noverride_dh_auto_install:\n    find . -name \"LICENSE\" -delete\n    dh_auto_install\n\nThere is a lintian-overrider tool that automates writing Lintian overrides.

Would a finite limit be better?\nSecond, where will the core file go? If the default is not a standard or logical place, how do I make it show up somewhere else?\n\nA: Unlimited core dumps are not advisable in most situations, but are technically fine. A core dump only has \"all the memory\" the current process has. So at most it can only be as big as your ram + swap. Hopefully you have more free space then that. \nIn real life they should be \"small-ish\" compared to total ram + swap. \nThe file \"should\" end up in \"the current directory\".

Core files get created when a program misbehaves due to a bug, or a violation of the CPU or memory protection mechanisms. The operating system kills the program and creates the core file.\nThis file can be very useful in determining what went wrong with a process. The production of core files can be enabled by default, depending on the distribution and version of Linux that you have.\nIf you don't want core files at all, set \"ulimit -c 0\" in your start-up files. That's the default on many systems; in /etc/profile you may find\nBecause truncated files are of no practical use, set the size of the Linux core file to \"unlimited\".\nUsage of ulimit         Action\nulimit -c               # check the current corefile limit\nulimit -c 0             # turn off corefiles\nulimit -c x             # set the maximum corefile size to x number of 1024bytes\nulimit -c unlimited     # turn on corefiles with unlimited size\nulimit -n unlimited     # allows an unlimited number of open file descriptors\nulimit -p               # size of pipes\nulimit -s               # maximum native stack size for a process\nulimit -u               # number of user processes\nhelp ulimit             #list of other options\n\nThe core file is placed into the current working directory of the process, subject to write permissions for the JVM process and free disk space.\nDepending on the kernel level, a useful kernel option is available that gives corefiles more meaningful names. As root user, the option sysctl -w kernel.core_users_pid=1 ensures that core files have a name of the form \"Core.PID\".\nulimit -S -c 0 > /dev/null 2>&1\n\nIf you DO want core files, you need to reset that in your own .bash_profile:\nulimit -c 50000\n\nwould allow core files but limit them to 50,000 bytes.\nYou have more control of core files in /proc/sys/kernel/\nFor example, you can do eliminate the tagged on pid by\necho \"0\" > /proc/sys/kernel/core_uses_pid \n\nCore files will then just be named \"core\". People do things like that so that a user can choose to put a non-writable file named \"core\" in directories where they don't want to generate core dumps. That could be a directory (mkdir core) or a file (touch core;chmod 000 core). \nBut perhaps more interesting is that you can do:\nmkdir /tmp/corefiles \nchmod 777 /tmp/corefiles \necho \"/tmp/corefiles/core\" > /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern \n\nAll corefiles then get tossed to /tmp/corefiles (don't change core_uses_pid if you do this).\nTest this with a simple script:\n# script that dumps core \nkill -s SIGSEGV $$ \n\nUnder Ubuntu, creation of core files is controlled via the file /etc/default/collectd.

Here are a couple concerns I have that will take too long to experiment with multiple times.\n\n\n*\n\n*There are multiple shares to back up, and I would like to loop through them and run the script over each one. How will this work with Rsync?

Maybe I just need to put some check in the loop to not restart until Rsync is done.\n\n*Referring to that last sentence; what does Rsync return that I could use to report if there was an error or continue the loop if all went well?\n\n*The checkpoints created by the NFS device are named based on the date. Rsync is unpacking the .ckpt* file into a statically named directory. Since the source is a different directory but the files inside are the same, and the target is named the same, will Rsync still only copy the differences?\nthis is the rsync job:\n    rsync -az $NEWCHKPT/* /drobo/bak.${share}/${share}_daily\nI know this is post is asking alot. Any advice is greatly appreciated.\n\nA: *\n\n*Depends on how you write the loop; unless you background the rsync commands with the & symbol, the rsync commands will run in sequence.\n\n*rsync will return a useful exit status. These are listed in rsync's manual page. man rsync | less '+/^EXIT VALUE'. You have to decide whether you want to abort the whole script when one fails, or attempt to run the others, then provide an error summary at the end for the ones that failed.\n\n*rsync has various ways to decide whether to copy a file or not. The default is to check the size and last modification time of the source and destination files. If both match, it skips copying that file.

In Ubuntu its Ctrl+Alt+F1 - F7, to login, and gain access to the system.\n\nA: Try pushing Ctrl+Alt+F1 (or whatever the Mac has) and login to install your drivers\n\nA: Here is another not so elegant solution that worked for me, I had same problem (still don't know why..): Just start up an ssh server before you kill the X server and do the driver install remotely from another machine.\n\nA: What others already said\nGet into tty 1 - 6 first and then sudo service lightdm stop. \nMy workaround:\nBoot into console mode from the beginning. To do that, edit /etc/default/grub file. Make sure you connnect automatically to your home network, you are on wired network, or at least you know how to use nmcli to connect to a network.\nChange line 12 from \"\" to \"text\" as shown bellow. Save, sudo update-grub, reboot. Once you are presented with console login screen, go ahead and log in, do the installation, edit /etc/default/grub file back the way it was, sudo update-grub and reboot.\n\nBONUS : Get yourself elinks console browser before you edit the grub file, so that in case you funk something up, you can google stuff from the command line.\nOther things you could: sudo pkill X\n\nA: I had the same issue and got it to work with a different workaround.\nI had to first reduce the resolution inside X to something low (800x600). Then when I went to tty and stopped lightdm, I didn't get a blank screen. \n\nA: You could install the driver from \"Software Sources\" in the last tab, if you want a beta driver add the xorg edgers ppa\n\nIf you have any hardware that need a nvidia/amd/ati/wifi driver is will show you a option there.\nYou could boot recovery mode and drop to a root console and install the driver that way, but you will have to reinstall it after every kernel upgrade.\n", "Q: I want to reformat my home partition from ext3 to ntfs I have three partitions: one with Ubuntu 12.04, the other is a data partition (the largest of the three) and the last one has Windows 7.\nFirst I installed Ubuntu, then I formatted the data partition as ext3 and chose it as my home folder.   Like a month after I installed Windows 7 on the third partition, and realized that it can't read the data partition (ext3).  So I just want to reformat it from ext3 to ntfs with gparted.  \nI thought of just copying the entire home folder (with hidden and system files) to an external hard drive I have, unmount home, reformat the partition to nfts, and just copy everything back and mount again.  But I don't know if this will be the wise thing to do.\nPLease help.\n\nA: Converting the /home folder to NTFS is neither wise, nor recommended, and not possible! \nThe home folder contains user configurations as well as user data. Ubuntu maintains user specific permissions for folders and files. The permissions format used by Ubuntu is specific to ext3, ext4 formats. \nIn other words, Ubuntu cannot preserve folder and file access permissions in an NTFS, or any of the Windows partition formats.\nOnce you format the /home partition to NTFS and copy everything back, you won't be able to mount it as /home as the partition will not meet the requirements of Ubuntu.\nSee Do I need Intel Smart Response when installing Ubuntu? for a solution on how you can link your data folders in another (NTFS) partition to your home partition. You will need to shrink the /home partition and create a new NTFS partition and copy the data folders, like Documents, Pictures, Music etc. there.\nHope this helps\n", "Q: How delete Gmail account from Evolution? I would use evolution only to work (company email/calendar/contacts etc), but it's already set up an gmail account. Unfortunately I can't delete it because the \"delete\" button is disabled for this account. \nPrivate emails i want to have in Thunderbird. How can I remove it from the Evolution?  And still use google calendar and gtalk in empathy?\nBR\nParasit\n\nA: I'm not entirely sure if this is going to help; however, I had the same problem and eventually managed to get rid of the Gmail account via some combination of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Removing ~/.config/goa-1.0 and its contents.\n\n*Removing my Jabber account from the online accounts (it was configured to use gmail.com).\n\n*Removing a bunch of files named ~/config/evolution/sources/1377432950.21327.?@myusername.source, because they each contained a gmail.com setting.\n\n*Removing Google from the online accounts.\n\n*Adding Google back in the online accounts.\n\n\nAll of the above with Evolution shut down, of course. I'm not sure which of the above actions helped, but eventually Evolution didn't display the Gmail account anymore.\n\nA: I bet you are seeing an email account from Online Accounts (i.e. a Microsoft account) that uses a Gmail address. To hide it, disable that account in Online Accounts, and the Gmail account should disappear from Evolution.\n\nA: In online accounts switch the use for your GMail account mail to off and leave calendar and chat on.

I would like to print to PDF documents from LibreOffice Writer but with CMYK color profiles. \nHow can I achieve this?\n\nA: According to the LibreOffice support page , printing in CMYK is not currently possible.\n\nLibreOffice uses only the RGB color model for printing in color. \n      The CMYK controls are provided only to ease the input of color values using CMYK notation. \n\nTo my knowledge, you will need to export the pdf using a tool like pstill which does pdf conversion to either a PostScript(.ps) or EPS(.eps) format.

But when I use this command\nsudo apt-get install vim\n\nIt gives me such an error\n\nHow to solve this?\n\nA: I am assuming vim works, and you would like a newer version. Therefore, my answer deliberately bypasses the method you are trying to use -- sudo apt-get -- which is fine for most things. \nHowever, the fact you have a message \"already at the latest level\" is telling me you want a newer version.\nI suggest you create a scratch directory under ~ after you log in. \n1) mkdir vim_install\n2) Then download the latest *nix version of vim -- The runtime and source files together: vim-##.tar.bz2 vim-7.3.tar.bz2 -- and unpack it in vim_install. A directory vim73 should be created. \n3) Follow the instructions in vim73/README.txt.

Client connects with intermediate wirelessly while Server connection with Intermediate is wired. So Intermediate has wired and wireless card.\nAlthough when I PING the Client for Server I get error message: Unreachable destination. I used different networks for wired and wireless, for wired I used 192.168.1.0 while for wireless I used 192.168.2.0.\nNotice that I use Ubuntu 13.04. Can someone please help me solving this problem?\n\nA: Yes, you will not be able to ping from the client to the server. This is because those two PCs are on two different networks (or subnets), and the \"intermediate\" PC is not configured to forward packets; in other words, the intermediate PC is not configured to act as a router, to route the packets between those networks.\nNow, I haven't done this before, but I have an idea on how you would be able to do it, so this answer is not going to be a straight forward enter-these-commands answer, but more about explaining what should be done. You'll have to do some reading to get to what you want to do.\nSo, first of all, you'll need to enable IP forwarding. This can be done by putting the value \"1\" in a specific file. You'd do this by the following command:\necho 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward\n\nThis tells the PC that it will be forwarding packets. But from where to where? Which protocols to allow? What are the rules?\nThe answer to those questions will be done through the utility iptables. These are the rules that configure the firewall in Linux. So for example, you use iptables to indicate that you need NATing, or to restrict access to a subnet, or to forward packets from one interface to another. An iptables command looks like this:\nsudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE\n\nI don't really know what this command means, but I guess it means \"do NATing when the output is eth0\".\nNow, this is the part where I don't know what commands will accomplish what you want to do, so you need to do some reading. I recommend carefully reading and understanding this: Internet/Connection Sharing, and you should focus on the Gateway set up section.\n", "Q: Why is Ubuntu running very slowly on my laptop?

I really recommend installing Gnome or LXDE (How To (LXDE) - yes, it says Ubuntu 12.04, but it works on 13.04 and 12.10 as well) as it will speed up your desktop, at the cost of some graphical eye candy.

It does not offer to install inside Windows by default anymore. \nThe first option (Reboot) simply reboots the computer.\nThe second option does nothing (you will reboot later).\nThese two seemingly useless options are just to let you know that you should boot from the DVD (not use it while Windows is running).\nThe third option (Help me Boot) actually installs something like the normal Wubi so that you can boot the CD via the hard drive, not using BIOS functions. This is mostly unnecessary except perhaps for very old computers or users who can't get their PCs to boot from a DVD/CD. You still need to have the DVD in the drive - so it doesn't remove the need for it (can't be used with just the ISO).\nSince you have Windows 8, you may have UEFI (if it came preinstalled with Windows 8) - in which case, the CD Boot helper will not work.\n", "Q: Kernel Panic on fresh install of 13.04 I went back to Ubuntu last night and gave my laptop a fresh install of 13.04 after alot of talk about how stable and quick it had become.

The trouble occurs when the files are being moved off of my hardrive to an external system, either a mounted network share or an external USB. The network share and USB experienced the same symptoms, but I'm not sure if they are necessarily related.\nThe most recent example was moments ago when I tried moving a folder totalling 1.9GB from my hard drive to a USB stick, via Nautilus copy & paste. By the time the progress bar had opened, the operation was about 1/3 done, reporting 600MB transferred. The transfer rate at this time was 29MB/s, and was rapidly declining. It went from 29 MB/s to 20 MB/s in a few seconds, went from 20 to 10 in about 10 seconds, and eventually bottomed out at 6MBs. There was also a period of about 30 seconds where the whole operation seemed stalled, as in, no updates shown in the progress window. An operation like this should take only a few seconds, and ended up taking about 3 minutes. \nYesterday I tried moving this same folder onto the network share and experienced similar symptoms. It took about 30 seconds for the progress bar to reach half way, and then the whole thing just stopped. Network monitor showed a flatline 0 Bytes/s.\nI have a newish SSD in the machine, so I don't think that's the bottleneck.\nWhat kind of things should I check to track down the root of this issue? \nUsing Ubuntu 12.10. The files I was trying to move were in my home folder which uses encryptfs.\n\nA: \"What kind of things should I check to track down the root of this issue?\"\nYou need to look at the stuff that's common to both transfers. Were you transferring the same file? Could that file be croupt? Were you out of ram for file caching? How was your CPU?\nEncrypting an partition usually has this type of side effect. Remember in order to transfer your file you have to decode it locally then transfer it to the destination. This is transparent to the copy program/calls but it still has to be done. If you are trying to transfer huge files, the memory that holds temporary decrypted copies of the file (well bit of the file) may have been full.\nCheck your free memory during a transfer using free -m or just free and see what it says is available for buffers and cache. \nAlso keep in mind that Linux caches file operations. So just because the user process thinks data has been copied doesn't mean anything has actually be written to physcal media. This causes smaller files to write really \"quickly\" but larger files have a \"burst\" of speed, then when the cache fills they slow down. It's not usually so noticeable, but if your caches are full, or your low on free memory (for new caches) or your CPU is under-powered (very common when people encrypt things), then it's going to take longer. \n", "Q: How to revoke partly executed commands? After two weeks of no-problemo ubuntuing, my sound was gone. I looked for help and found this answer.\nI entered the huge wall of code and hit \"enter\" and \"y\" a few times. While the terminal was doing it's thing I read this line in the same post: \"Whatever you do don't enter the huge code on the first answer!

But I'd like to know anyway because I do not know, what I did to my system.\n\nA: There's no \"command roll back\". If you have the commands you can undo them one at a time by just doing the reverse. But in short, keep backups, learn to read all directions before you do ANYTHING specially with root permissions (sudo) and don't blindly copy and paste commands from websites.

I have chromium web browser open and I don't want it to say Chromium Web Browser in the title bar in unity. It can be blank for any app I have open as well using 12.04\n\nA: The title bar in chrome (or any browser) is typically set by the webpage. Your going to have a very hard time overriding that. \nIf you switch to gnome 3 there are ways to fool the system into displaying an empty title bar. There is no way to do this in unity that I am aware of, and no way to do it application specific without removing window decorations. If your willing to remove window decorations then you can try Maximus for gnome 3 or develspie. There are other programs and scripts that will let you modify window proprieties. The one your looking for is \"undecorate\".\nYou could of course compile your own window manager and just change the parts that display the window title. However that's pretty advanced.  If your just trying to stop prying eyes you could write a quick chromium extension that sets a title to \"\". \n\nA: There's a neat program called wmctrl that allows controlling window properties, including titles.\nFor instance, run this in terminal:\nwhile [ 1 ]; do wmctrl -r :ACTIVE: -T \" \"  ; done\nThis will set whatever your active window is to the text you specify with -T flag. Thus, any active window, once you bring it up, will get set to blank title. So all you have to do is bring up the application, and there you have it ! \nYou can put that into a script, and make that script a startup application. For more info on how to achieve that, read here\nNote, wmctrl isn't default package. you have to install it with sudo apt-get install wmctrl\n", "Q: Internal hdd auto-mounted for another user I'm running ubuntu 13.04, the system is hosted in one hdd.

When a user clicks \"Report Problem...\", they are faced with this bug in apport, preventing the actual error report from being sent.\nOn the other hand, you could receive an error message such as the following\n\nIn this type of dialog, the error report service works flawlessly. This, again, reflects bug #1050577 in Ubuntu, which causes the password prompt for the error report in the first type of dialog to hang and prevents the report from being sent.\nWhen you receive the \"System program problem detected\" message, go to Terminal (Ctrl - Alt- T) and type:\nnautilus /var/crash/\n\nYou can study the various crash reports in that folder, and file bug reports for them accordingly.\n\nA: First of all, apport it doesn't fix anything, it just tells developers that something went wrong, so this (apport) doesn't help you to much personally.\nSecond, an explanation as to why the problem continues to occur is that the old crash report hadn’t been cleared out after reported it (you said that doesn't even work, unfortunately). To solve the problem, open a terminal and run this command:\nsudo rm /var/crash/*\n\nLog out, log back in the system and check if the dialog still appears.\nOr, better, disable apport (see here a number of reasons why is good to keep aport disabled):\nsudo sed -i 's/enabled=1/enabled=0/g' /etc/default/apport \n\nMy solution (of course, not recommended)?\nsudo apt-get remove --purge apport\n\nNow, to solve the problem with \"Report Problem\" with the dialog that doesn't work and because you said that you are a member of the 'sudo' group, you should try by prevent PolicyKit from asking for a password following step by step this answers. I don't encourage anyone to do this; it is more better to report a system bug in this sense and to apply the solution with sudo rm /var/crash/*.\nOther information about how to debug Ubuntu package crashes you will find here:\n\n\n*\n\n*DebuggingProgramCrash\n\n*Aport crash interception\nSources:\n\n\n*\n\n*System Program Problem Detected on Ubuntu 12.10\n\n*Should I be asked for my password when a bug report is sent?\n", "Q: What to do?!

(You should have done this before a system upgrade anyway.) Make sure you've really saved everything, including hidden directories. Then do a complete re-install of 13.04, and then copy your data back from the USB drive to your new home directory. You might have to change the permissions afterwards.\nI'd wait a little while, just in case somebody else comes along and points out a flaw in my advise.\n\nA: boot up using usb and latest version. once in, do an install by double click/clicking icon for upgrade. then it will tel you there already is a version. then choose upgrade. bam\n", "Q: Xmonad Xsession My user level: noob-ish, so please bear with me\nI'm running 12.04 LTS.

When I try to install on a Win8 64bit using the live CD I get a black screen with the words \" Binary Whitelisted\". I have searched around but the only thing I found was \" add \"nomodeset\" in grub\" Found it here But I am not sure how to do that. \nHelp appreciated. \n\nA: When the CD is loading you will a keyboard and white guy in a circle. When you see this, hit a key.\n\n\n*\n\n*You'll be prompted to select your language, do so.\n\n*Hit the F6 key to bring up the Other options,\n\n*Use the arrow keys to scroll down to \"nomodeset\" and hit Enter\n\n*Hit Escape to get back\n\n*Select \"Try Ubuntu without Installing\" or \"Install Ubuntu\" and hit Enter.\n\n\nIf it is a \"nomodeset\" issue, this will fix it.\nAlso, since this is a Windows 8 machine, disable Secure Boot in UEFI before you attempt an Ubuntu installation. I've also seen references to Secure Boot causing this error message.\n\nA: The \"binary is whitelisted\" message comes from the shim program, which is shipped standard with recent versions of Ubuntu (and several other distributions). It is not an error message per se. If the computer is hanging after that message is displayed and before anything else is booted, it means that there's a bug in shim or in whatever program it launches (normally GRUB). Disabling Secure Boot might fix the problem, but it's more likely that something else is going wrong. You might need to install another EFI-mode boot loader (which is difficult to do on an installation medium) or install in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode and then either leave it booting that way or convert the computer to boot in EFI mode by installing an EFI-mode boot loader.\n\nA: I was having the same issue. In my case, I looked at the boot order on my Asus motherboard, and it was trying to install Ubuntu through UEFI. I changed that to a normal installation, and it worked just fine. \n", "Q: How do I disable presenter console in Libreoffice 4 I am enjoying libreoffice 4, but don't want to have presenter console on because we do multiple things during a presentation, and the console window blocks out any option for switching windows or system volume or other simple things like seeing the time. \nI have been down the road of \"extensions\" but it is built into the core of libreoffice 4 and cannot be just unticked in the tools extensions menu. \nHow do I remove, or at very lease disable it? It seems many other people want to know. \n\nIt seems this is renamed in libreoffice 4.1 (or its a kubuntu issue) to libpresenterconsole.so \nMake sure you are renaming the right thing. \n\nA: I think the easiest and cleanest way to proceed is to go to Tools/Options/Impress/General and disable the option \"Enable Presenter Console\".\nNB: You must be in LibreOffice Impress for this option to show up.\n\nA: It seems that the console script is burried in the core of libreoffice 4, so upon a quick search of the filesystem for \"presenter\" I found \"PresenterScreen.uno.so\" in the /usr/lib/libreoffice/program folder. A simple renaming of that file to PresenterScreen.uno.so.hidethis (or something else) disables the presenter console. \nSo to recap, open nautilus as root, or use a terminal and go to /usr/lib/libreoffice/program/PresenterScreen.uno.so and rename it to something else, but don't have to delete it.\nI hope a lot of people see this. It is much easier to multi task during a presentation when the presenter console is running, though it is very smooth and slick, but is not mature yet. I do enjoy it, but the group I work with does not, and the console removes all options for file navigation, and opening another presentation, changing volume, playing solitaire (just kidding). \nThanks everyone. \n", "Q: Modify limits of process (ulimit -n) Is it possible to change the: soft limit and hard limit of a specific process? In my case, the process is mongod and a lot of web resources tell me to simply write ulimit -n in my terminal. \nBut how will the terminal know that I want to modify only the limits for the mongod process? Do I need to write the command somewhere in particular?\nAlso, once the above question is solved, is it possible to increase the hard limit since I am assuming that the above command works for the soft limit only.\n\nA: What they try to tell is that you should first execute ulimit and then run mongod on the same shell session. This way Mongo DB process will have it's limits changed.\nAs you probably want to start Mongo DB using the startup script, the simplest solution would be modify this startup script and add ulimit call before starting Mongo DB daemon. This is still not the best solution to modify Mongo DB startup scripts.\nThe best way to deal with this problem would be changing limit defaults in file /etc/security/limits.conf or better adding specific configuration to /etc/security/limits.d See man pam_limits and man limits.conf for more information.\n", "Q: juju: deploying lamp charm on ec2 causes instances to terminate I was running a ubuntu 13.04 instance on ec2.

I have the IP address for Ubuntu machine, and I want to access the application running on localhost in Ubuntu from my virtual Windows box. Is there a way to do it? Typing the [inet address]:8080 doesn't work.\n\nA: First, make sure the web server process is running. Type localhost:8080 in a browser window on your Ubuntu machine. If you get the page you were expecting proceed to next step, otherwise start the webserver process and retry.\nSecond, make sure that both machines are on the same sub-network. i.e. something like 192.168.x.y/255.255.255.0 and 192.168.x.z/255.255.25.0 If not, make necessary adjustments and proceed to next step.\nThird, check if a firewall is running on your ubuntu server. If so, check if the desired port is open (8080 in your case). If you do not want to open the port to public access you can configure a rule to accept only traffic from the local sub-net.\nEdit: Step 0. Make the settings suggested in the answer by @Eeroz\n\nA: Windows has its \"own\" localhost, so you have to \"help\" it find Ubuntu's one.\nIn your virtual machine, go to this ip http://10.0.2.2/ and it should work. You can edit windows host file to make localhost point to that ip so you don't have to remember it. \nIn: C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts\nAdd:\n10.0.2.2 localhost\n\n\nA: If you are using Ubuntu you have to first disable your firewall.\nsudo ufw disable\n\nNow find your ipv4 address from system settings-> Network and click on arrow of connected wifi to get more information about it.There you will find ipv4 address of your pc. Then you can use localhost of your pc as \n\nhttp://ipv4:portno/yourpagename\n\nDo not forget to enable firewall after completing your work.Use-\nsudo ufw enable\n\nCheers\n\nA: You could set the virtual machine to use a bridged connection. That way the virtual machine will get its own IP-address, and you should be able to connect to the host machine.\n\n\n*\n\n*Right click on the Virtual Machine (while it is not running)\n\n*Choose 'Settings'\n\n*Choose 'Network'\n\n*Under the 'Adapter 1' tab, set 'Attached to' to 'Bridged Adapter'.\n\n\nA: If you have determined that it is your firewall, I would advise adding this rule instead of disabling your firewall:\nsudo ufw allow 8080\n\nWhen you are finished you should run:\nsudo ufw status numbered\n\nfind the numbers in brackets. Say it's [ 1] and [ 3]:\nsudo ufw delete 1 3\n\nThen, if you are on virtual box you will navigate to http://10.0.2.2:8080 if you have your network set as NAT. You can do this for any port and it will work the same. \nEven though this is some extra work, you should never disable your firewall even on a secure network. \n", "Q: unable to boot in windows 8 I've installed Ubuntu 12.04 and I can't boot in Windows 8, I can only boot in the recovery.\nBefore that, I installed fedora over a Ubuntu installation and I was having the same problem.\nHere is my boot-repair information : http://paste.ubuntu.com/5669119/\nWhat can I do?

Changes can be made to the rules after startup by you or any other process with root privileges. Run iptables-save (or iptables -L if you don't have -save) from a console to see what the rules currently are, while the problem is occurring, and you'll find a rule blocking your traffic.

This also happens with Fedora 17 and 18.\nWhen I left-click anywhere above or below the thumb, it jumps to that position and starts dragging from there. The expected behavior is to scroll one page up or down.\nWhen I right-click anywhere above or below the thumb, it scrolls one page up or down. That is the behavior I expect from left-clicking, the same way it works on GTK2 and QT applications.\nHorizontal scrollbars have the same problem.\nThis is very bad for consistency.\n\nA: For GTK2 applications, I also noticed the scrollbar-warp behavior happens with the Adwaita theme (but not with the Greybird theme).  I fixed it for GTK2 by editing /usr/share/themes/Adwaita/gtk-2.0/gtkrc and changing the line\ngtk-primary-button-warps-slider = 1\n\nto\ngtk-primary-button-warps-slider = 0\n\n\nA: Found the answer here:\nhttps://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-948904-start-0.html\nEdit (or create) the file:\n~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini\n\nAnd add the following:\n[Settings]\ngtk-primary-button-warps-slider = false\n\n\nA: The behavior appears tied to the desktop theme/style you select.  If you install the gtk2-engines-xfce package and then select one of the GTK2 themes (e.g. Xfce-4.0) from the Appearance settings, you will get GTK2-style scroll bars.\nUnless you are particularly interested in using Adwaita or Greybird, I think the best (and certainly easiest) solution is just to pick a different theme.\n\nA: Reverting to the Gtk2 scrollbar behavior can also be done on a per-theme basis by creating/including in the ~/.themes/myThemeName/gtk-3.0/settings.ini file, the [Settings] section, the scrollbar behavior switch\n[Settings]\ngtk-primary-button-warps-slider = false\n\n", "Q: Juju and MAAS: ERROR No matching node is available - with Ready nodes I have four nodes in the \"Ready\" state, and I am still getting the following error when trying to bootstrap:\nERROR No matching node is available.\n\nThe server is running 13.04 with Juju 0.7.\nI have been walking through the instructions on the MAAS site: http://maas.ubuntu.com/docs/juju-quick-start.html\nI also tried following the instructions to install the latest version of Juju (1.10.x) as described on https://juju.ubuntu.com/get-started/, but then I ran into some other errors, including \"error: no tools available\" when trying to bootstrap and \"use of closed network connection\" when trying to sync-tools.\nHow can I get a simple MAAS + Juju setup going for testing?\n\nA: You may have hit bug 1064291.

So how can I hide the linux-world partitions from windows7?\nEspecially if it complicates the task when there are encrypted volumes.\nWhy? Because everytime someone from my family starts windows and browses through \"My Computer\", clicking on one of the drives that it cant read, they are asked to format that partition.\nIf someone did that to my stuff partitions, I'd go full insane.\n\nA: I'm guessing you are using GPT instead of the msdos partition table.  It seems that for some time parted followed Microsoft's lead and used their GPT partition type code when creating partitions, and Ubuntu has not yet updated to a version that no longer does that.  This causes Windows to assign the partition a drive letter, and when you try to open it, and it doesn't recognize the filesystem, it offers to format it.

Funny thing about computers. They're built by humans to be logical and sensible. They aren't designed to be tricky, but they are complex, and the documentation, when there is documentation at all, never covers all possible contingencies.\nForgive me for making assumptions, but it seems to me that you are in possession of a small puzzle, and all the pieces to solve it.

Still, take another stab at it.\n\nA: /dev is usually a tmpfs mount that is managed by udev, so it has to be the actual same file system as on the host machine. That means that you would need to use the bind mount method.\nmount --rbind /dev/media/windows /dev/sdb1 -t ntfs\n\nA: Ok. I used mount -t ntfs /dev/sdb1 /media/windows and it returned no errors. Then I entered mount and found \"/dev/sdb1 on /media/windows type fuseblk (rw,allow other,blksize=4096)\" so I can mount the /sdb1 partition to the /windows directory, but the assignment specifically says to mount the /media/windows to /dev/sdb1.\nAlso...

I'm thinking about the possibility of using Ubuntu One free version (?) to offer SaaS and IaaS services. I do not know if Ubuntu One would be a good alternative to start with. What I wonder about the Ubuntu One free version is: if it allows execution of software and using some space on it to store data for free, and if it's possible, to what extent is it allowed.\nDoes anyone know, or has anyone used this service for free?\n\nA: No. Ubuntu One is simply a cloud storage service. It doesn't work in the ways you'd want it to for SaaS or IaaS. for what you're trying to do you'd either have to set up your own server or buy some space from amazon or the like and manage it with openStack and juju for example\n\nA: I'm not quite sure what you meant by \"if it allows execution of software\". However, as a free user, I can confirm that Ubuntu One provides 5 gigabytes of free storage. For comparison, Google Drive gives you 5GB of storage free, but has no Linux client. Dropbox gives you 2GB free and Copy (a newer player) provides 5GB free.

Ramfs will grow dynamically.  But when it goes above total RAM size, the system may hang, because RAM is full, and can't keep any more data.\nTmpfs will not grow dynamically.

Ubuntu may install an MBR (master boot record) instead, which is the non-EFI way of booting.  New UEFI BIOSes are capable of booting from either an MBR or an EFI boot partition.  If yours is booting to the EFI boot partition, it is probably seeing Windows 8's entry in there but not Ubuntu's.  If, however, you do have an MBR and you convince it to boot to the MBR (which is usually just indicated by not having \"(EFI)\" next to the boot option), then it may boot to an MBR Grub menu but then you won't be able to load Windows 8 from there.\nUnfortunately this is a difficult problem to solve but in short, it involves installing grub-efi (if you aren't already using it, and you may be) and either using your motherboard's built-in boot manager (press F12 when booting, usually) or putting the correct information for your Windows boot entry into your Grub menu so you can use Grub to choose.

How do I actually make the html file work on the instance, so that a user can go to the url and see the java applet?\nI am very new to ubuntu and linux in general, so a simple explanation would be preferred.\n\nA: If you have already written the HTML file, you simple must move it to /var/www/. There is already an index.html file there, you can overwrite it (it's pretty boring). Then, you can see your web page by going to http://localhost/ in your browser. If your page is written in PHP (which it seems you may have hinted at), move it to /var/www/ and delete /var/www/index.html. The rest is the same - Apache will render the PHP for you and you can still find it at localhost.\n\nA: The easiest way is just right-clicking it and choosing the browser you want to open it in :\n\n", "Q: Partitioning issues with easeUS how do i proceed Ok I installed EaseUS to set up a partition for Ubuntu. My laptop automatically has 4 primary drives:\n*:SYSTEM\nC:\nD: Recovery\n*: HP_TOOLS\n\nI have an HP laptop. I read online that HP_TOOLS is a back up of the BIOS and that I can convert it to a logic drive, no problem. I was able to convert it, and I was able to take 15 GB from the C: drive to unpartitioned space. Now it won't let me partition that space to a separate drive for Ubuntu. It says I need to convert another drive to a logic drive. How should I proceed?\n\nA: Okay, first of all, you don't have to create a partition out of that unallocated (free) space to be able to install Ubuntu. You can leave it as unallocated space, and start with the Ubuntu installation process. At one point, there will be an option that will say Install Ubuntu alongside Windows 7, like this:\n\nThis option will not present itself if there is no free space available in your hard disk. So when you choose this option, it will only use up that free space. However, in your current situation, you won't be able to select that option, it will probably say \"unusable space\" or something like that. Here is why:\nI'm guessing this is how it looks like to you in EaseUS:\n*:SYSTEM               Primary\nC:                     Primary\n*:              Unallocated 15GB Space\nD: Recovery            Primary\n*: HP_TOOLS            Logical\n\nTo cut down on some of the explanation:\n\n\n*\n\n*You won't be able to create that space as a Primary partition, because you can't have more than three Primary partitions + one (or more) Logical partition. This is a limitation of the MSDOS partitioning.\n\n*You won't be able to create that space as a Logical partition, because all Logical partitions have to be next to each other, one after the other. And in your situation, the D (Recovery) drive is between your free space and HP_TOOLS (which is the other Logical drive).\n\n\nSo you have several options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Move the Recovery partition to be above the free space, so it would look like this:\n*:SYSTEM               Primary\nC:                     Primary\nD: Recovery            Primary\n*:              Unallocated 15GB Space\n*: HP_TOOLS            Logical\n\nNow, you'll be able to create a partition from that free space (or as I said, you can leave it as free space, and choose that Install Ubuntu alongside Windows 7 when installing Ubuntu). To \"move\" the partition in EaseUS, just right click on the Recovery partition, and select the first option \"Resize/Move partition\" . In that window, you need to slide that box (indicated below) to the left most side:\n\nOnce you do that and hit OK, you'll be able to create a partition from that free space. NOTE: moving a partition might take a very long time, like 2 hours.\n\n*You can convert your Recovery partition to a Logical partition. That way, it would look like this:\n*:SYSTEM               Primary\nC:                     Primary\n*:              Unallocated 15GB Space\nD: Recovery            Logical\n*: HP_TOOLS            Logical\n\nNow, you'll be able to create a partition from that free space. However, I do not know what are the implications of converting the Recovery partition to Logical, so I don't recommend this method.\n\n*You can delete the HP_TOOLS partition altogether. From what I've read, you can recreate it on a USB drive later. So, when you delete the HP_TOOLS partition (right click and delete partition), your layout would look like this:\n*:SYSTEM               Primary\nC:                     Primary\n*:              Unallocated 15GB Space\nD: Recovery            Primary\n*:              Unallocated 100MB Space\n\nEven though it might say \"Logical\" next to the free spaces, just ignore it. Now, you can create a partition from that 15GB free space, because it will be the only Logical partition. As for the deleted HP_TOOLS partition, I believe it is only 100MB, so you can just leave it there. If you really really need this free 100MB space, you can move the Recovery partition to the right, which will move the 100MB to the left to merge it with the 15GB space. However, again, moving the partitions will take a long time.\nI recommend the last method.\nBy the way, you can check out this answer: https://askubuntu.com/a/149829/52726, it's about the same thing. However, I did not flag your question as a duplicate because you are using EaseUS, so I thought you'd prefer it over the partitioning feature that you can use while installing Ubuntu, since I'm guessing you are new to Ubuntu.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: lxappearance changes not sticking Just installed 13.04, in xmonad, want to change my gtk theme.

A lot of things could be different depending on your setup. But disabling \"required\" auth methods till your left with just \"Unix Authentication\" may be a good first step. \nYou can do this by running pam-auth-update as root and un-checking the other boxes.

I have photos on here from years and years of painstaking work. I am a semi-pro photographer and my hard disk contains roughly 1.5 TB of data from photos.  Plus 100GB of my entire music library, and all my dvd's I took time to tip on to my hard disk. But my photos are what I'm most concerned about, they are not replaceable.\nNow here in short is what happened:\nI have always had a backup of my data using backblaze, which is an online backup for windows.  I decided about 3 months ago I wanted to get a server going for my files using plex and decided Ubuntu was the best way to go.  So I was utilizing this backup method using something called \"greyhole\" and in the process of setting up (2) 2TB hard drives and (1) 1 TB harddrive on this greyhole backup program.  \nThen that is when I got a rootkit.  This thing was nasty and I think after 2 months of trying everything, I had to reflash my bios and STILL had this virus. I had to reformat all my hard drives and backed everything up on to 1 hard drive filling it almost entirely (a 2 TB hard drive).  I still did not get rid of this virus it was incredible.  Eventually I caught it. It was embedded in my network ethernet card.  Anyone reading this should take heed that anything embedded in there can and will infect your router, all your LAN, and stay on your computer even through reflashing of the bios itself!\nAnyhow after I seemed to get rid of the thing I still had my files on my hard drive. I didn't want to reinfect my machines, so I tried to re-write the MBR using  a utility called testdisk.\nBIG MISTAKE\nI didn't have a clue what I was doing. And now I can't read my information!  \nHere is the good news? After testdisk did it's thing (which consisted of me analysizing the drive, and using the WRITE command to do the damage, it only took 1 second for it to be done. Meaning - I didn't sit through a 5 hour process of writing 0's on the drive with \"dd\".  It was a quick little thing I did. So for that reason I'm thinking the data still has to be on the drive.\nHere is what I know:\n\n\n*\n\n*the drive is a data drive, no OS. I used ubuntu as the OS on another drive.\n\n*formatted as ext3 or ext4\n\n*size = 2 TB\n\n*files = irreplaceable, my entire lifes work - no exageration.\n\n\nAlso - backblaze doesn't have my files anymore because it's been over 30 days.  I have written over all my othre backups with 0's due to the rootkit. This hard drive was and is the only source of my files at the time when this happened.  Coincidently this is the only time I've been without a backup for many years.\nHere is a copy/paste of fdisk -l\nDisk /dev/sda: 2000.4 GB, 2000398934016 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 243201 cylinders, total 3907029168 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 4096 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 4096 bytes / 4096 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x0006a14b\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sda1   *          63  3907024064  1953512001   83  Linux\nPartition 1 does not start on physical sector boundary.\n\nAnd lshw\n*-scsi:0\n          physical id: 2\n          logical name: scsi2\n          capabilities: emulated\n        *-cdrom\n             description: DVD writer\n             physical id: 0.0.0\n             bus info: scsi@2:0.0.0\n             logical name: /dev/cdrom\n             logical name: /dev/sr0\n             capabilities: audio cd-r cd-rw dvd dvd-r\n             configuration: signature=643a3365 status=ready\n        *-disk\n             description: ATA Disk\n             product: ST2000DM001-1CH1\n             vendor: Seagate\n             physical id: 0.1.0\n             bus info: scsi@2:0.1.0\n             logical name: /dev/sda\n             version: CC24\n             serial: W1E2L5K7\n             size: 1863GiB (2TB)\n             capabilities: partitioned partitioned:dos\n             configuration: ansiversion=5 sectorsize=4096 signature=0006a14b\n           *-volume\n                description: EXT3 volume\n                vendor: Linux\n                physical id: 1\n                bus info: scsi@2:0.1.0,1\n                logical name: /dev/sda1\n                version: 1.0\n                serial: 05ea2f85-06fd-446c-a885-30614d53630c\n                size: 1863GiB\n                capacity: 1863GiB\n                capabilities: primary bootable journaled extended_attributes large_files recover ext3 ext2 initialized\n                configuration: created=2013-03-27 07:57:02 filesystem=ext3 label=foo modified=2013-03-27 08:11:50 mounted=2013-03-27 08:11:50 state=clean\n\nPlease help what can I do? I'm scared of screwing it up again with testdisk.  I just want to recover the files.  I can't see how they are gone.\nThank you so much-\n\nA: I believe, amongst other things, testdisk should work as a tool to recover your data. However, first and foremost - before you do anything else, you need to guard your last copy of the data. Firstly, only mount it read-only from here on. (You can remount it with the option ro, see man mount)\nI suggest getting yourself a large (>2TB) disk and copying a complete image of your current disk over: dd if=/dev/sda of=disk-image.dd where /dev/sda is your read-only mounted all important disk and disk-image.dd is a file on the new disk, make sure there are 2TB free.\ntestdisk will work on an image as well and should be able to sort the partition table out. Get back with questions and comments and we can take it from here...\nA good place to start reading is here:\nhttp://epyxforensics.com/node/36\nIn it's walk through it starts by making a dd copy as I suggested above and continues to work on the copy.\nHave you got yourself an examination computer with testdisk, gparted and maybe hexedit installed?\n\nA: To recover data from an image on an external USB drive here are the steps needed:\n\n*\n\n*Stop using the damaged drive.\n\n\n*Have an external drive(s) ready holding twice the data amount from your damaged drive 's size.\nFormat with a filesytem able to hold such a large file as will be created from the original drive (e.g. ext4)\n\n\n*Boot Ubuntu from a live session (\"Try Ubuntu\") .\n\n\n*Mount your external drive using Nautilus.\n\n\n*Verify the mount point of your external drive.\ne.g with Properties --> Location on right click menu.\n\n\n*Verify location of your damaged drive with any of these commands in a terminal\n sudo fdisk -l\n sudo blkid\n\n\n\n*Create an image of your damaged drive\n sudo dd if=/dev/sdX of=/mountpoint/DRIVENAME/rescue.dd\n\nReplace sdX with your damaged drive (e.g. sda) or partition (e.g. sda1). Replace /mountpoint/DRIVENAME/ with the actual path where your USB drive was mounted.\nOnly in case your damaged drive (sdX) is equal the size of your external drive (sdY) you are able to clone the drive (sudo dd if=/dev/sdX of=/dev/sdY) to perform data rescue on a cloned external drive. Still, working on an image as shown above is a much safer approach.\n\nIt is critical at this point to get the dd command correctly. If you gave the wrong entry to of= you may damage all data that had existed there.\n\n\n\n*Install TestDisk on your live system as was further elaborated in my answer below:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I recover my accidentally lost Windows partitions after installing Ubuntu?\n\n\n*Read the awesome and concise guide from the makers of TestDisk to recover.\n\n\n*In case your drive is huge, mount another drive/partition to hold the recovered data. Note this mountpoint for testdisk.\n\n\n*Run testdisk on the image of your drive:\ncd /mountpoint/DRIVENAME/\nsudo testdisk rescue.dd\n\n\n\n*Save recovered directories and files to your backup drive/partiton (give testdisk the mountpoint of this drive as storage location in case it's different to where the image is).\n\n\n*Verify your data are there.\n\n\n*Unmount all drives or shutdown the live session.\nIn case we had not succeeded to recover our files we may also run PhotoRec which was installed together with the TestDisk suite to recover individual files (but then filenames permissions, and directories will be lost).\nYour damaged drive still is untouched. We can even let this drive be recovered by a professional service in case we failed with above steps.\n\nA: Give \"extundelte\" a try to recover your files\n\nA: Try Recuva by Piriform (maker of CCleaner). The tool is free. With v1.51.1063 they added support for ext2 & ext3 file systems. \nThe tool will scan a disk and attempt to recover individual files that have been deleted from the disk. This tool has saved critical data for a few individuals I know whose business depended on their data (i.e. Quickbooks Data) after having lost everything to a heavily corrupted disk, or having had the disk formatted.\nI know that Recuva is a tool only available on Windows and Mac, but the tool can now be used on typical Linux file-system formats, so I thought the information useful here in a Ubuntu Q&A site; particularly as a solution to the question (although, I'm sure he/she has found a solution by now).\n", "Q: Extract an .mzp on Ubuntu As above, is there any way to perform an extraction of a .mzp file on Ubuntu?\nThe interwebs have nothing for me :p.\n\nA: MZP is a \"mountable zip file\" and it's proprietary to WinArchiver. That doesn't help you because WinArchiver is, as the name suggests, built for Windows. That also means that other archiving tools don't know the format so won't be of any use.\nYour immediate options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download WinArchiver and run it in Wine. This may not work.\n\n*Create a Virtual Machine for a Windows installation, install WinArchiver and unWinArchive the file.\n\n*Slap the person who sent you it and tell them to use a standard archiving format.\n\n\nThere are other options, including breaking into national embassies and holding diplomats hostage, but I really hope you're not that desperate to get into this file. \nShort answer: use the tool it was created with. \n", "Q: Installing ubuntu without any OS Is it possible to install ubuntu without having a operating system?\nI have tried to install through usb and do not have access to dvd/cd at the moment.\ncan anyone help?\ni got the following error codes:\nSQUASHFS error: squash_read_data failed to read block 0x6b56569\nthe SQUASHFS error: unable to read fragment cache entry unabble to readpage; block 6b56569, size d607 \nFAT-FS (sdb1):unable to read: node for block updating(i_pos 262162)\ni am booting it on Toshiba Satellite L855D-S5220\n\nA: If you have followed instructions carefully, you should have no problem installing from a flash disk. Did you perhaps get information from any place other than an official source? \nIf so, try this please: Installation from USB Stick.\nYou haven't really supplied us with enough information about what went wrong, so it is difficult to help you. Only two things spring to mind right now:\n\n\n*\n\n*You must have sufficient memory on the flash disk when burning an image.\n\n*Did you change your boot settings in the BIOS?\n\n\nA: Yes, you should be able to install it without having a current OS by booting the Live CD from a USB flash drive.  Use unetbootin on a working computer to load the Live CD into the USB drive.  First run without installing to test out the OS. \n", "Q: Can't connect to mySQL server which is running I installed the latest mySQL Ubuntu distribution on my Ubuntu 13.04.

If I try to bring the brightness down any more, it flickers but stays the same.\nI have full control of the brightness in Settings, but that's delicate and gets reverted to full max if I open up the brightness settings again, use fn+up/down, the screen goes into power saving, or after log out.\nThe closest I got was adding\nacpi_backlight=vendor\n\nto a line in /etc/default/grub, [source]\nI could consequently lower the brightness a couple of pegs down to the minimum with FN+down, but then it's as if the problem got inversed, and I'd get stuck in the bottom tier, I could only increase the brightness by one peg and back down.

So all credit to NES, llazarte, bodhi.zazen and Argusvision.\nTo simply swap two keys functions:\nFrom Terminal run xev and then press F9 which would give something like\n\nDoing the same for PrtSc did not give any output in xev for me (or I could not find the \"KeyPress event\") so I used Argusvision's advice for using the Custom Shortcuts in All Settings but doing so in order to disable PrtSc as screenshot button by reassigning as Shift + Alt then tried pressing again which gave me keycode 107 for PrtSc in xev like so\n\nRepeating the process for all four keys gave me\n\n\n*\n\n*F9 = keycode 75\n\n*PrtSc = keycode 107, action Print\n\n*F10 = keycode 76\n\n*Scroll Lock = keycode 127, action Pause\n\n\nTo change a keys function we need to know the keycode of the NEW key being pressed and the \"action\" of the OLD or existing key for that function.\nNow that we have the key codes for identifying the keys we now make the system do what we want by using xmodmap and as we know F9 has \"keycode 75\" and PrtSc has the action of \"Print\" all we need to do is\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 75 = Print\"\n\nto make the F9 key behave as if the PrtSc key has been pressed. i.e. the keycode stays the same but pressing the F9 key will have different results.\nUsing xev with Scroll Lock also gave\n\nwhich confirms the \"action\" for the Scroll Lock key is \"Pause\" so for making the F10 act as Scroll Lock trying\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 76 = Pause\"\n\nshould give the desired results.\nThat is until you log out or shutdown etc so what we have to do after confirming the commands\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 75 = Print\"\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 76 = Pause\"\n\ndo give the desired results is sort out SysRec which is modified PrtSc and swap over the other buttons so we do not have multiple instances of same key action .  Adding\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 107 mod1 = F9 Sys_Req\"\n\nshould swap F9 to where PrtSc was keeping the modified SysReq (Alt + PrtSc) again we can use xev to help verify this.\nSwapping the Scroll Lock and F10 buttons is easier\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 127 = F10\"\n\nAfter making sure that when running\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 75 = Print\"\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 107 mod1 = F9 Sys_Req\"\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 76 = Pause\"\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 127 = F10\"\n\ndoes indeed do what is intended all that is left to do is get this happening at startup time. To do this run\nxmodmap -pke|egrep  -e '(F9|Print)'\n\nwhich gave me\n\nwe are only interested in the keycodes 75 and 107. Do the same for\nxmodmap -pke|egrep  -e '(F10|Pause)'\n\nwhich gave me\n\nand we are only interested in the keycodes 76 and 127.\nCreate a new text document with your favourite text editor copy and paste the relevant information\nkeycode  75 = Print NoSymbol Print\nkeycode 107 = F9 Sys_Req F9 Sys_Req\nkeycode  76 = Pause NoSymbol Pause\nkeycode 127 = F10 NoSymbol F10\n\nnaming the file as .Xmodmap and saving it in your Home directory would allow you to run the changes simply by logging on after rebooting.\n\nA: For newer  versions of Ubuntu, Xmodmap works but after you reboot, you lose your keymappings! Instead what I did was to edit the xbd file (/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/pc).\nIn this case you would add the following entries:\nkey <FK09> { [Print] };\nkey <FK10> { [Scroll_Lock] };\n\nThen clear the xkb settings cache:\nrm -rf /var/lib/xkb/*\n\nAfter a reboot your keys are mapped corectly.\n", "Q: Black Screen on Login I have serached around, but no fix could help me. Here's what happened:\nA few days ago, for no reason, I couldn't see the login screen on my Ubuntu 12.04. nor do anything but reboot using CTRL+ALT+DEL. After reading some suggestions and experimenting, this is what I got so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*If I go to the recovery mode and then choose \"resume normal boot\" I can see the boot up text, and it stops at \"Checking battery state\".\n\n*If I choose \"failsafe graphics mode\" it stops on a different point, one of the last messages being from xserver saying \"fatal server error no screens found\"\n\n*I realized that I can get to the desktop if when the black screen appears I use CTRL+ALT+F1 and blindly type my username and password, and then use \"startx\".

At least I can use the terminal this way.\n\n*I tried reinstalling xorg and nVidia drivers (using the current ones) but it didn't help\n\n*I deleted the ~/.config/monitors.xml and ~/.config/monitors.xml~ but that only got my resolution to reset to the default one AFTER blind login and use of startx\n\n\nAny suggestions, anyone? Any logs I need to provide you with?\nI would like to note an important piece of info: I had my GeForce 6600GT and then upgraded to GeForce 8800GT. IT died after like three weeks, and then I put back my old 6600GT. It worked fine the first day, so I was thinking if it's possible to install OLDER nVidia drivers (like version 220.xx), using the terminal, could that help? And how do I do that?\nThanks in advance!\nUPDATE: I managed to try all the driver versions available in \"Additional Drivers\" but none helped. Still, the only way to access the desktop is via startx and no menus are shown.\n\nA: did whatever Tesla said but instead of installing GDM simply reinstalled lightdm after removing it:\nsudo apt-get install lightdm\n\nThis helped solve the problem for me\n\nA: This is what helped in the end: I removed lightdm and installed GDM. After reboot, it worked:\n\n\n*\n\n*When the HDD stops loading and the black screen appears, type CTRL+ALT+F1\n\n*Type your username and password in the terminal prompt.

The system in question happens to be a Virtualbox VM (guest).\nWhat solved the problem for me was to remove all the Virtualbox guest additions, reboot, then re-install the guest additions.\nTo remove the guest additions from the command line:\nsudo apt-get remove virtualbox-guest-additions\nsudo apt-get remove virtualbox-guest-dkms\nsudo apt-get remove virtualbox-guest-utils\nsudo apt-get remove virtualbox-guest-x11\n\n(Don't worry if you don't have some of those installed.

This is strange. \nSomeone kindly help me.\n\nA: Something makes difference, try type it somewhere else if you're typing really that password, To change password press CTRL + ALT + F1 > there you log-in and type \"passwd\" or passwd \"username\" and press enter, it will ask for new password\n", "Q: How to decide on the right Nvidia driver based on the Linux Kernel version? After trying to install the Nvidia drivers and got them working and then got them broken, I would like to check one important thing:\nOne of the main problems I run into was \"Kernel version and Nvidia Driver version mismatch!\". How to avoid this? How do I know that the newest NVidia driver out there is compatible with what I have already installed or have?\nFor example right now, I started with a fresh XUbuntu 13.04, Kernel: 3.8.0-21-generic. I know that there is a new NVidia driver for Linux: 319.17. So do I go with the \"./*.run\" file approach or do I set-up one of those external repositories, for example \"xorg-edgers\", what should be the correct approach?\nAlso, once I install them, how do I ensure that the NVidia drivers will not break with a Kernel update?\nThanks.\n\nA: I think there is already automatic updating for lasted nvidia drivers directly in update menu (look for additional drivers  menu)\n\nA: There are three kinds of drivers:\n\n\n*\n\n*tested and stable drivers\n\n*tested and presumably stable drivers\n\n*brand new bleeding edge drivers\n\n\nAs the name says drivers from the bleeding edge side (be it from the xorg-edgers ppa, or downloaded binaries from the manufacturer)  are not meant to be stable. They are there for us to test them, and to report or fix bugs we may find.\nOnly after these tests turned out to be successful and bugs were fixed the drivers gradually mature to stable (found in ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates) and finally get their way into the official repositories.\nTherefore in case we do not want to install drivers which may break our system, or are incompatible with our kernel, or other kernel modules we should refrain from installing bleeding edge drivers.\nA misbehaving alpa or beta driver may be easier to purge if we had installed them from a ppa rather than from a binary.\n", "Q: /dev/mapper/ full Hi All I have a issue where my system wouldn't login or startup properly.

The only way you're going to resolve this in the long term is to buy more storage. Consider second hand if you can't afford new. The very biggest (currently 4TB) often isn't cheapest.\nReclaim \"reserved\" space\nUbuntu reserves around 5% to allow you to still use the computer if it's completely full.

Is there any other tool or method to preserve the pdf quality?

When I clicked Install, it asked me for 'authentication' (which never showed up before) and then it showed this:\nPackage dependencies cannot be resolved\n\nThis error could be caused by required additional software packages which are\nmissing or not installable. Furthermore there could be a conflict between software\npackages which are not allowed to be installed at the same time.\n\nWhat should I do? Is this because of my Wubi-installed Ubuntu?\n\nA: Wubi 64bit installs are supposed to have multiarch support, but it's missing (when not installing from the ISO). To fix:\nsudo dpkg --add-architecture i386\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ia32-libs\n\n\nA: First thing's first: yes, you can install software on a Wubi-installed Ubuntu. But, to fix your problem, let's try installing Google Chrome through the command line instead of installing it through the Ubuntu Software Center. This way, if something goes wrong, we'll be able to see what exactly is happening.\nFirst, open up a terminal. To do so, hit Ctrl+Alt+T. This is where we'll be entering the commands.\nSecond, enter in this command:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nEnter your password when prompted. This is basically a command that updates your \"sources\", so that when you install a program, you can do it seamlessly. You'll see lots of lines, and it'll stop in the end. If you get any errors like Err 404 Not Found when running this command, let us know and show us the output.\nNext, we'll run the following command:\nsudo apt-get install -f\n\nThis will attempt to fix (by downloading and installing) any missing files that are needed to run some programs. If it asks you \"yes\" or \"no\", type y and hit enter. This step might fix your Google Chrome installation.\nFourth, we'll run some commands to help clear up some unneeded files (incomplete downloads, unneeded packages, etc.), so type in these:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get clean, this will clean the cache.\n\n*sudo apt-get autoclean, this will remove partially downloaded files.\n\n*sudo apt-get autoremove -y, this will remove unneeded packages (dependencies).\n\n\nLastly, we'll try to install Google Chrome. This is going to be a different way that the way you did it, but bear with me. So, in that terminal, type in the following commands:\nwget -q -O - https://dl-ssl.google.com/linux/linux_signing_key.pub | sudo apt-key add -\n\nOnce you type this, I think it will prompt you to hit the Enter key, so do it. It should say OK. After that, type the following:\nsudo sh -c 'echo \"deb http://dl.google.com/linux/chrome/deb/ stable main\" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google.list'\n\nOnce that's done, type the following:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nThat's the first command we ran. This is to update the sources, because we just added the source (the \"website\" if you may) that we'll be downloading Google Chrome from. So finally, type in the following command:\nsudo apt-get install google-chrome-stable\n\nWhen asked yes or no, type y and hit Enter. This will start downloading and installing Chrome.\nNow, I know that this looks like a pretty long way for installing software, compared to the Ubuntu Software Center, but all of these steps were to get rid of unnecessary stuff, and to see more information about errors, in case we're presented with some. But actually, the command to install software is just that last command. So, in the future, if you want to install VLC player for example, you would open up a terminal and type sudo apt-get install vlc. Yes, it's that simple.\nIf, at any point of these commands, you get an error, let us know and edit your question to show the error.\n", "Q: Wubi won't start Trying to install Ubuntu on old XP computer.

I haven't been able to get 3G working in Ubuntu, but other people have.  It should just work if you try to do a side-by-side install like Crouton.\nFor the packages, all of those do have a package that you can install.  You can tell by going to a mirror site and checking if they have armhf packages.  However, that doesn't necessarily mean they work.

You're going to want to go watch her video at youtube.com/nixiedoeslinux, and search for black screen of death.\n", "Q: What leads to outdated user applications? currently I'm thinking about switching completly to a Linux Distribution. I actually like Ubuntu alot, but I have some concerns about outdated (user) applications.\nIt's recommended to use the official repositories to install any kind of software (I'm aware, that there are other possibilities like ppas etc.). As far as I know, applications which are in this repository aren't updated for a specific Ubuntu version (e.g. App A Ver 1.6 is available in Ubuntu 12.10, devs create version 1.7 (no securityfixes, just a functional update) and it wouldn't be available in the official repository til Ubuntu 13.04). There are some exceptions like Firefox, but for the majority of the apps, there are no (functional) updates within 1 Ubuntu iteration.\nI'm also aware, that there are distributions which follow a rolling release model. There you get updates very soon after they are released. The downside there is the stability. It's possible, that you break your system with an update.\nI just wanted to ask, what leads to this situation on the technical side. In my understandig it should be possible to update every kind of user application (Chromium, Gimp, ... - everything which is not part of the operating system itself), without breaking any essential system functionality (Like it's the case in Windows/Mac OS X, it's very unlikly to break your system with an update to some user applications). \nIs it because backward compatibilty issues with some libraries? \nSo e.g. App X requires a function from Lib A (Ver 1.0). App Y requires another function from Lib A (Ver 1.1). The devs of Lib A decided to drop the specific function, which is needed in App X in version 1.1. If a user installs App Y, which requires Lib A in version 1.1, Lib A will be updated from 1.0 to 1.1. In this case you would break the functionality for App X.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is this an situation which could occure?\n\n*How's the update mechanism for libraries in Linux? Would an update overwrite the previous version of a library?\n\n*Do systemcritical parts use libraries which are used in user applications too? (So if a library is updated in terms of a user application update, could it break system functionality?)\n\n\nIf the situation has nothing to do with libraries, could you explain which possible problems lead to this situation?\nThank you!\n\nA: There are several reasons that Ubuntu does not update packages every time an update is available upstream.  Some of these are given below.\n\n\n*\n\n*Stability:  Many users want to be sure that their system will just work and every time you update software there is a risk that something will break.  Some users are prepared to accept this risk for the latest features while others such as my self rely on my computers for business so would be very up set if the computer stopped working because of a bug introduced with some new feature that I don't particularly want to use anyway.\nTo deal with this Ubuntu has two types of release standard releases and Long Term Stable (LTS) those of us who insist on Stability over features only use the LTS releases and only upgrade to the next LTS release several months after it has been released in order to be sure that if it has any problems it has been tested by enough people that the problems will have been found and fixed.  LTS releases also tend to be less radical than non LTS releases in that the differences between the next LTS release and the previous LTS release will be small: New ideas are tested on standard releases.\nFor those that are less concerned with stability there are the normal releases.  Which may have more problems initially but contain more up to date features.  If you want to be even more up to date you can install software from repositories other than the official ones or install code from source but this adds some risk.\n\n*Release Dates: The recent release of Raring Ringtail got people excited and as you can see from this thread on Ubuntu Forums people were waiting to download it as soon as it was released.  This kind of event gets people excited and helps to promote Linux in general and Ubuntu in particular.  If software was updated on a regular basis there would be little to choose between the latest release and a fully up to date older release.  The marketing opportunity would be lost.\n\n*Libraries and Support: When a particular package is updated to provide some new features it is possible that it may rely on some feature in an updated library.  This requires the library to be updated. However, there may be dozens or even hundreds of packages that use this library and they will all need to work with the new version of the library. Each will need to be tested to make sure it works and not only that they will have to be tested in all supported releases.  Ubuntu relies on the community for much of this but there is a limit to how many of us have the time and technical ability to review all the changes in all the supported releases.  \nFor these reasons we concentrate on security patches and bug fixes in the existing versions and add new features in the development release.  \n\nA: In addition to the other answer which is good:  \nIt is generally frowned upon to do static builds or use non-release versions of libraries.  \nDirect rebuttal to the Windows comparison is how a user might have 3 or 4 different versions of msvcrt.  It's just not visible to the user.\nYou could make a similar argument against some applications on OSX (where a static build or bundling libraries could have taken place).  \nHow many applications and devices on other platforms have shipped with not just old, but truly ancient versions of libpng for example?  \n", "Q: When trying to run Android Studio sh file, chmod +x and checkbox just instantly fails (as root too) I want to run the new Android Studio IDE just released at Google I/O 2013, and when I try to execute studio.sh, it opens it in a text editor.

And this time, when I upgraded Ubunutu from 12.10 to 13.04 the new problem was that, the booting hangs at GRUB. \nRight after upgrading the system worked well, but once I restarted this problem arose. I have tons of important files in it, really really important.\n\nA: I have had this problem before.  First thing you could try would be to try the recovery mode if you can see the grub menu at all.  If you can't see the grub menu, create a live cd/dvd of ubuntu, and then use the chroot commannd to change to the root of your ubuntu installation on your harddrive, and then use the update-grub and it should configure your grub.cfg file correctly and then you should be able to boot.  If this does not work, read a little bit about the grub2 documentation (just google it), because you can get a grub prompt and interactively change your configuration that way as well.\n\nA: Yes you can use a usb stick, but it's a little more difficult to get the usb stick to boot.  If you have access to another system running ubuntu, I'd suggest you download the lts desktop iso file, and then use ubuntu's startup disk creator to create a bootable live usb stick (I think it's called statrup disk creator - if you're running Unity, just search in the dash for it and it should come right up).\nOnce you've got the startup disk creator open, choose other file and point it towards the ubuntu iso you downloaded.  You'll need sudo privileges to install the boot loader and persistence file onto the usb stick.\nOnce it's done, you'll have to press the key to enter your computer's setup (the BIOS) usually it is F1 or F2, just pay attention to it when it's booting.  Repeatedly press that key when it's booting, and you'll get the BIOS screen.  Once there, you'll want to look for boot priority and change it so that your usb stick will boot first (the usb stick will need to be in the usb port when you go into the BIOS screen or it won't give you that option usually).  After that's done, save and exit out of bios, computer will reboot, and will read from usb stick.\nOnce ubuntu boots up, choose to run it live.  Once the live desktop shows up, open a terminal and type sudo fdisk -l this will list all drives and partitions available on your computer and any attached storage (ie: the usb stick).  You want to look for your harddrive (sda).  More than likely you've only got one harddrive, so you will only see sda1 and possibly sda2 (the numbers after sda refer to partitions on that drive).  If sda shows up, and you're sure that this is the drive your ubuntu installation is on, you will need to mount that drive/partition so that you can chroot into it.  To do this, type sudo mkdir -p /mnt/ubuntu (this will create a directory called /mnt/ubuntu that you will use to mount to).  Next, type sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/ubuntu (this will mount /dev/sda1 to /mnt/ubuntu so that you can work with it).  Next we need to chroot into the /mnt/ubuntu directory so we can work on your harddrive, so type sudo chroot /mnt/ubuntu  Once you've done this, now our terminal is rooted to your harddrive (meaning any command we type into the terminal will be applied to your harddrive instead of the usb stick).  So, now type sudo update-grub and grub will go through it's config process, and update the grub.cfg file on your harddrive.  After this is done, you can get out of the terminal by typing exit until it closes.  You can then shut down the live ubuntu session, reboot the computer, reset your BIOS to boot your harddrive first, and it should boot ok\nIf you are unfamiliar with all of this, I would suggest you take a little time and google all the commands I mention and get an understanding of them before you tackle this.  Rest assured your files and folders are fine and completely unharmed.  The only thing that's happening is that the boot loader is not configured properly to be able to boot ubuntu.  Your actual harddrive and the data it contains is irrelevant to the problem you're experiencing.  However, take your time, and understand what commands I'm referring to so that it stays this way.  This might take you 1-3 days to understand all of this, but that's a small price to pay to make sure you don't lose any files on your harddrive accidentally.\n", "Q: I need a root password to access my drives, how to install 13.04?

If you have the resources to do this I advise you to do so, as you reduce a lot the risk of data loss and you should save a lot of time (move/shrinking partitions can take some time).\nIf you don't have the possibility to do as me, as you are running in a terminal system I think the best tool to do that is parted. It lets you resize and move partitions.\nNote: if you choose to recreate everything, I strongly advise you to use LVM. In a situation like this it would make unnecessary to move partitions and growing/shrinking much more easy and safe.\nEdit\nAs bodhi said, if you have the possibility to use a live CD/USB with gparted (which is included in Ubuntu) it will make your task much easier. GParted lets you resize and move partitions by just dragging. \n", "Q: Cannot access my Ubuntu server on my local network, can remotely My ubuntu web server was working fine yesterday, But I tried to login via SSH today and it would not connect.

I have connected to the KVM USB ports my Microsoft Natural Ergonomics 4000 keyboard and my Microsoft Wireless Mouse 5000 mouse. The mouse works OK and for the most part the keyboard works too, except that all of the advanced keys (multimedia, home, mail, etc.) and, more important, the Fn keys, don't work. They do work if I connect my keyboard directly to any of the independent PCs.\nThis issue of non working keys also happens if I boot the PC's in Windows.

In order to get access to the tools I would need (dd will make a 100% complete bit-for-bit copy of a multi-partition drive to a new drive, correct?), I'm going to have to run a liveCD of linux.  \nI've been trying to figure out if I should be using a DVD-R or a DVD+R for the liveCD.  Is there any noticeable difference as far as a ubuntu liveCD goes, between the two standards?\n\nA: Use a DVD -R , less expensive, and there is no real need for +R\nEven better, get a 2 Gb flash drive, much cheaper in the long run then DVD.\n", "Q: Alt-tab crashes gnome classic desktop (12.04) I have a fresh install of ubuntu 12.04 and noticed alt-tab wasn't working. I followed some advice and installed compizconfig settings manager, wherein I checked Application Switcher. Then alt-tab worked, but sometimes (lately, every time) it crashes the desktop. I'm using gnome classic (which by the way I have not been able to set as the default... I have to select it every time).\nAfter hitting alt-tab, the screen freezes, and the mouse can be moved only briefly every few seconds, and clicking anywhere doesn't seem to do anything. Some parts of the screen become a bit distorted. One time it recovered, but then crashed again as soon as I clicked on the time in the upper-right corner.\nAny idea how to fix this? Where can I look in the log files? Perhaps I can uninstall compizconfig (after all, it does come with a warning that it can wreck your system) but then how can I get alt-tab to work?\nMany Thanks.\nEDIT: I guess not many people have had this issue. I suspect it's a problem with my graphics card - perhaps it doesn't like the fancy effect involved with alt-tab window-switching. So a revision to my question would be: how do I enable alt-tab to switch windows for me in the simplest, safest, non-fancy way? Can I do it without compizconfig?\n\nA: Well, in case others with the same issue come across this, the solution was to disable the application switcher in compiz, and enable the static application switcher. The shift switcher also works nicely. \nMore info:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/compiz/+bug/971051\nI noticed that if I used the gnome classic (no effects) desktop, a basic form of alt-tab worked fine, which was what I wanted, but I want some of the effects in the regular gnome classic desktop. For some reason my computer couldn't handle the fancy Application Switcher option.\n\nA: Select \"Static Application Switcher\" at the bottom of the config window in compizconfig settings manager instead of \"Application Switcher\" in the same window. \nAlt+Tab should then work fine.\n\nA: I had similar behaviour in 14.04: freezing screen and need to log-in after alt-tab. not always, but frequently enough to be annoying. Seems to be solved now:\n\n\n*\n\n*Installed compiz config\n\n*Under 'desktop', swithed off the Ubuntu Unity Plugin,\n\n*directly re-enabled this plugin\n\n\nCompiz now complained about a conflict ('Show desktop plug-in', if I rembember well) and proposed to resolve this, which offer I gladly accepted.\net voila.\njvdw\n\nA: Not to directly answer your question; but if you log in using Gnome classic and then log out without crashing the desktop. You should, in theory, then default to Gnome classic for subsequent log ins.  I suspect that by crashing out, the log on settings are not being saved.  On my computers it defaulted to Gnome classic after the first time I logged out.\n", "Q: The arrow, page up and down keys cause screenshots Every time I attempt to scroll through web pages with the arrow keys or insert, home, end, page up or down.... my computer snaps a screenshot. is there a system setting or fix to this issue?\n\nA: Check your Keyboard Shortcuts:\nGo into System Settings\nthen, select Keyboard\nChoose \"Shortcuts,\" and check under \"Screenshots\"\nAlso, what version of Ubuntu are you in, and what browser are you running?

A synonym is -o ro.\nNote  that,  depending  on the filesystem type, state and kernel behavior, the system may still write to the device. For example, Ext3 or ext4 will replay its journal if the filesystem is dirty. To prevent  this  kind of  write  access,  you  may want to mount ext3 or ext4 filesystem with ro,noload mount options or set the block device to read-only mode, see command blockdev(8).\n[…]\nnorecovery/noload\nDon't load the journal on mounting.

Is there a way to avoid this kind of glitch happens with the video file that's already recorded?\nQuestion-2. If the answer in Q-1 is no, are there things to avoid this to happen when I'm recording video snapshot? Since I've found gtk-recordmydesktop works the best for me I prefer to sticking to it, but I also welcome other tools if any for this purpose.\nThis thread seems to be discussing similar issue but no solution/workaround is reached.\nUsing Ubuntu Quantal, handbrake-cli 0.9.8ppa1~precise1, gtk-recordmydesktop 0.3.8-4.1ubuntu1\n\nA: It looks like your video-edting software is glitchy.\nrecordmydesktop couldn't have caused that because the video was already made, and it was fine. The glitch thus had to have happened later in your workflow. I doubt handbrake would have done that, because it's just a humble transcoder (and it seems like the glitch-free video that we saw had also been through handbrake). The glitch had to have been introduced later, most likely by the video editing software. Try looking at that.\nI was wrong.

I have been running Xubuntu 12.10 for over a month now, on 5 machines (old Compaq Evos, runs nice and slim on these old chips).  I immediately became afraid of installing the updates suggested in the Update Manager when an update session in one machine disabled the wireless card I had worked so hard to get working (one of those pesky ones that refuses to play nice with Linux).\nI later noticed that some updates in the Update Manager don't seem to apply to me, such as a \"Unity Toolbar Update\".  I installed this version of Ubuntu cleanly as Xubuntu so I don't use Unity.\nTo summarize my question: Should I always install everything that comes up in the Update Manager in Xubuntu or would it be better to skip updates that I think should not apply to my machine?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: I think at a minimum you should do security updates, which includes the kernel.\nIt is rare that updates cause problems, but in the event they do you should have a working backup of your data.\n\nA: I install everything that comes up. If there is an update for a package, why not install it?\nNow, while no update is guaranteed to work your specific setup, security updates are important, and other updates basically install new versions of programs that you have installed. \nAlso you can read the Change log to see what each update provides. \n", "Q: What is this strange spontaneous Facebook/Google Chrome popup?

I've become addicted to Byobu and I've recently shifted from bash to zsh; Now I want to combine the two, however I have a one initial pre-requisite:\nI cannot make zsh the default shell for my user as it's a shared account and the rest of the team aren't as zsh happy as I am - That rules out the 'chsh -s /bin/zsh' option.\nSo, I discovered you can set a default-shell for tmux (which should follow across to byobu right?).

Great quality which I got real cheap.\nUnfortunately it came infested with this thing called Windows 8. Have not really had time to install Ubuntu on it, but now I am going to take time.\nHowever, when checking around it seems like it will be a little more complicated than usually. So does anybody have any experience of doing it? I would like to get rid of Win 8 completely and likewise I was thinking of installing ubuntu on the SSD and using the HDD for dumb storage, will that be good setup (not going to install any applications except Eclipse and some other small media applications)?\nSo far I have figured out that I must diasble the RAID setup:\nUnable to install 12.04 on a Lenovo U410 Ultrabook\nAlternatively I migh also need to delete the raid partitions, use dmraid to remove the meta data and label the disks as 'gpt':\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2052975\nOr will that be needed only if I want a dual boot option?

I do not need to do that to install Ubuntu, right?\nSo, does anybody have any helping comments for me?\n\nA: I had some trouble while installing Ubuntu 13.04 on a Lenovo ThinkCentre, which is not directly related to your question, but you might see some smiliarities here. First, removing Win8 causes issues as the standard Lenovo boot process asks for a Windows entry in the EFI boot partition - just about the entry, not about 'real' data. I did this via command line on a Live-CD. (Got the info from this forum entry.)\nYou can verify if an entry is there with\n$ sudo efibootmgr -v\n\nIf it is missing, create one\n$ sudo efibootmgr -c -d /dev/sda -p 1 -l '\\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi' -L \"Windows Boot Manager\"\n\nThen verify, if the entry is there and check the boot order; Ubuntu needs to be first, followed by the Windows entry then the remaining ones:  \n$ sudo efibootmgr -v\n$ sudo efibootmgr -o 0000,0001,000A,000B,000C #according to the boot entries\n\nPrior to an UEFI installation I also got rid of the standard partition tables and created GPT partition tables manually, although Ubuntu does that automatically if you pick the option of \"install Ubuntu and use entire disk\". Since I did want my root and home to be separated, I did not follow this procedure, so used gparted on a Live-CD.\nThen, crucial was to flash the BIOS, which I did by downloading the .ISO-file from Lenovo's website and created a Live-USB drive. This step was incredibly important, as the Lenovo UEFI could not detect the signed Ubuntu kernel (\"Error 1962 - no operating system found\"). After that I did not need to turn off Secure Boot, Quick Boot and OS Optimized Setup options inside the \"BIOS\". \nHere is the entry for grbu4bios with a nice description (credits go there), download the latest edition from here (scroll down to the bottom of the page) and unpack it to your working directory:\n$ sudo fdisk -l   #find out which one is your USB drive\n$ sudo ./bootlace.com /dev/sdb\n\n\n\n*\n\n*copy these two files to the USB drive: grld and menu.lst   \n\n*copy the bios.ISO (e.g. f1j951usa.iso) to the USB drive\n\n*open menu.lst with gedit:\ntitle thinkpad-bios  #can be any title\nmap (hd0,0)/f1j951usa.iso (hd32)  #according to the file you've downloaded\nmap --hook\nchainloader (hd32)\nboot \nAfter that, boot from the USB drive and select the last entry, follow the procedures.

I have no clue what it is, given I put in my user account password it says its the wrong password and im the only user on. when i type anything sudo in terminal that password works but when it shows me a message asking for it i dont know what it is..... can anyone help me find it or tell me what it is?\n\nA: Whoever installed the Ubuntu system was asked for a user name. That user name not only became the first user of the system, but also became the first sudo user (account that could put sudo to run root-privileged programs.\nSo, your password should work. If you did not install the system, you need to go on the sudoers list. These two questions should help you add your account to sudoers, but you still need the first account's password, if it was not you.\nTo check to see if you have admin privileges, try entering sudo -i and using your regular password.

However, a requirement is the download of Numdisplay package. As I am a new user of Ubuntu, I was wondering if you could provide me with the exact commands to write in the terminal to obtain the download.\n\nA: First of all, I asume that you are using an Ubuntu OS. Second, you must to have Python 2.2 or latter installed. If you don't have it, you can install it from terminal with this command: sudo apt-get install python.\nNow, Numdisplay requires the use of NumPy.

I had this automount at boot and used it to store files that I wanted encrypted (tax documents, bank statements, or other personally identifiable information). It was useful because I don't want to encrypt my entire home directory, or my entire hard drive; the number of files I actually keep encrypted is pretty small so it could still be conveniently backed up to the cloud as a single file, preserving my private documents without making them accessible if someone were to gain access to that data somehow.\nI'm curious if there is an analog to this on Ubuntu (or Linux in general) or if there is at least a means to achieve the same ends.\n\n\n*\n\n*I know I can create an encrypted hard drive partition, but I don't want to do this because I want to minimize the space used while still leaving room for growth, and I want to be able to sync the file to the cloud (with a small image this is not a huge issue).\n\n*I know I can encrypt my home directory but this is not what I want to do either. I don't want to encrypt things like music, movies, configuration files, or most of the work I do since I don't care about keeping them private and I want to be able to sync a lot of it without having to update a huge blob every time I sync. I suppose theoretically I can store all my personal files in another directory and symbolically link to them from my encrypted home, but I'm still not sure if this accomplishes what I want (can I backup the blob somewhere and restore on another (not necessarily Ubuntu or Linux) machine?) or if it would cause too much of a hassle.\n\n*I've found some information about creating and mounting sparse images, but nothing I found mentioned enabling encryption.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: It is feasible, you must first create a sparse file, suppose 512MB: \ntruncate -s 512M file.img \nSo with cryptsetup, let's encrypt the file as a device (the syntax is the same, here only use the basic options) \ncryptsetup -v luksFormat file.img\n\nWARNING!\n========\nThis will overwrite data on file.img irrevocably.\n\nAre you sure?

In a PC using Windows, I'd like to schedule a boot into Linux every x days (alternatively every x bootstraps).\nIs there a way to have Grub2 make this timed, cron-like, boot?\n\nA: You could just set up a schedule in windows to reboot whenever you want and configure grub to default boot into ubuntu.\n", "Q: 12.04 Resolution Changes on Lock + KVM I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 and using a monitor that I share with a Windows laptop via a KVM.  When I login to Ubuntu my resolution is 1900x1200, but when I use the KVM to toggle over to my laptop and then Ubuntu locks, when I KVM back my resolution is set super low.  When I open \"Displays\" it automatically corrects my resolution back to 1900x1200, and the resolution is fine if I use the KVM to toggle back to Ubuntu before it locks.\nI've seen the suggests this post with suggestions on either creating a bash script to set resolution (which seems hacky) or using X settings in xorg.conf, but my symptoms seem different than the ones described in that issue so I didn't want to just blindly try those suggestions.\nHelp is much appreciated!\n\nA: I've had this same problem on 13.04 and 13.10.  I tried a number of different potential fixes with no luck until I finally gave up.  Well, I just upgraded to 14.04 LTS and this particular bug has been squashed!\nYou won't be able to upgrade from 12.04 to 14.04 directly until 14.04.1 is released.

One of my favorite features of unity is the progress bar the launcher overlays on the icons for various programs like the file manager, or firefox. Gnome-terminal does not have a progress bar. What do I need to do for unity to display the status of apt-get or dd etc?\nIf this is not possible can we at least change the icon when a prompt is available?\n\nA: Getting a progress bar to work will (I believe) be hard, and will have to be implemented on a case by case basis for different applications (apt-get, dd, etc.).\n\nOn the other hand, changing the icon when a prompt is available is easier. Assume that there exist two scripts iconprompt and iconnoprompt which change gnome-terminal's icon on execution. [I've added sample iconprompt and iconnoprompt in the end]\nSo, all that remains to be done is to\n\n\n*\n\n*Execute iconprompt when a prompt becomes available.\n\n*Execute iconnoprompt when a command starts executing.\nThese can be accomplished by adding the lines\nexport PROMPT_COMMAND='iconprompt'\ntrap 'iconnoprompt' DEBUG\n\nto the .bashrc file in your homefolder.\n\nThe behaviour will not be as desired when you have more than one terminal open - one terminal running apt-get and another on which you're working. In this case icon changes will not be indicators of process completion. To handle this consider the following alternative solution:\nAdd\nmonitor() { iconnoprompt; \"$@\"; iconprompt; }\n\nto .bashrc. To do sudo apt-get ...  you'll have to type monitor sudo apt-get .... The icon will be different only while the monitored command is running.\nI recommend this solution, also because my iconprompt and iconnoprompt scripts take about 0.1 second to execute which will create a noticeable lag for commands like ls and cd.\n\n(Sample) Content of iconnoprompt:\n#!/usr/bin/python\n\nfrom gi.repository import Unity, GObject\nimport threading, time\n\nlauncher = Unity.LauncherEntry.get_for_desktop_id (\"gnome-terminal.desktop\")\nlauncher.set_property(\"progress\", 0.5)\nlauncher.set_property(\"progress_visible\", True)\n\nGObject.threads_init()\nloop = GObject.MainLoop()\n\nt = threading.Thread()\nt.daemon = True\nt.run = loop.run\nt.start()\n\ntime.sleep(0.1)\n\n\n(Sample) Content of iconprompt:\n#!/usr/bin/python\n\nfrom gi.repository import Unity, GObject\nimport threading, time\n\nlauncher = Unity.LauncherEntry.get_for_desktop_id (\"gnome-terminal.desktop\")\nlauncher.set_property(\"progress\", 0.)\nlauncher.set_property(\"progress_visible\", False)\n\nGObject.threads_init()\nloop = GObject.MainLoop()\n\nt = threading.Thread()\nt.daemon = True\nt.run = loop.run\nt.start()\n\ntime.sleep(0.1)\n\n\nSet executable permissions to iconnoprompt and iconprompt and put them in your PATH. iconnoprompt will add a progress-bar to the gnome-terminal icon - but the progress value has no correlation with actual progress.\n", "Q: Unity .desktop Actions internationalization and localization? How can we translate Desktop Action Names? Is it supported by quickly, launchpad?\n\nA: You should be able to translate the Action's Name property just like you can elsewhere in the .desktop file.  Usually this means using _Name with the untranslated string in yourapp.deskop.in, then using whatever tool it is that applies translations to .desktop files.\n", "Q: Can I make the system to check checksums of all the binary files installed? I've found a bad bit in my RAM and still experience some notable bugs after replacing it. I suspect some binaries could get corrupted during installation. Can the system check the installed binaries checksums based on the packages metadata?\n\nA: The MD5 sums of files installed by .deb packages are stored in /var/lib/dpkg/info/*.md5sums. Run the following to check the integrity of all files:\ncd /\nmd5sum -c /var/lib/dpkg/info/*.md5sums\n\nOr, to see only the failures:\ncd /\nLC_ALL=C md5sum --quiet -c /var/lib/dpkg/info/*.md5sums\n\n\nA: You can use debsums -s to check the MD5 sums of installed Debian packages.\n", "Q: How do I use ARandR to create a permanent monitor layout in Lubuntu 12.10?

So, 2621440 integers would take (2621440 * 4 =) 10MB from the virtual memory.\nThe problem I'm having is, this program occupies nearly 80MB of memory, for no reason.\nI monitored the the memory usage from System Monitor and the top command as well. \n\nint main()\n  {\n  int *p;\n  for (int n=0; n < 2621440 ; n++)\n  { p = new int ; }\n  }\n\nI'm on Kubuntu 13.04 (amd64)\nPlease give me a little explanation.\nThanks!\n\nA: Each integer requires 32 bits from the memory.\n4 bytes = 4 * 8 bits = 4 bytes, so 2621440 integers would take (2621440 * 4 * 8) bits = (2621440 * 4) bytes = 80 megabits (Mb) = 10 megabytes (MB).\nI think that you make a confusion between megabits (Mb) and megabytes (MB): 8 megabits (Mb) = 1 megabytes (MB).\n", "Q: Ubuntu : Kerberos With LDAP I am using ubuntu 12.04.

I am kinda confused with the Ubuntu version to install (32-bit or 64-bit). I have read all the tips and guidelines on installing Ubuntu on a Windows 8 machine.\nI have disabled fast boot, quiet boot, secure boot, and still cannot boot from the usb. I tried this with Ubuntu 12.04.2, 12.10, and 13.04 (the 64-bit versions only). I am yet to try a 32-bit version but I'm reluctant since Canonical says only the 64-bit version was developed to handle the Windows 8 UEFI issues.\nAlso, I have a boot-override field in my UEFI options which I think force-boots from the boot option one selects. I selected to force-boot from my pendrive containing Ubuntu, but the screen just blinks momentarily and nothing happens.\nPlease help me to figure out how to load ubuntu on my machine. I don't really want the Windows 8......just Ubuntu on my tablet.\nThank you.\n\nA: I haven't checked the latest Ubuntu release, but the last one I did check did not include EFI support in the 32-bit installation medium. You can add it yourself, though. The medium will need a FAT partition (it may already use FAT; I don't recall offhand) with the boot loader stored at EFI/BOOT/bootia32.efi on the FAT filesystem. Ubuntu uses GRUB 2 by default, but that will be very difficult to get working on an Ubuntu install medium. Instead, I suggest using ELILO or rEFInd. I describe both in my Managing EFI Boot Loaders for Linux page. Whatever you use, you'll need to figure out the appropriate options to pass to the kernel. You can find these in the boot/grub/grub.cfg file on the Ubuntu install medium (at least, that's where it is on the 64-bit version that I've just checked).\nI don't know offhand if the 32-bit version will install an EFI version of GRUB. If not, you'll have to manually install an EFI boot loader on your hard disk (or SSD or whatever your computer has) using an emergency system.\n\nA: You got everything right, but you need to use the 32-bit version of Ubuntu, because this tablet comes with a 32-bit Intel Atom processor.\nhttp://ark.intel.com/products/70105/Intel-Atom-Processor-Z2760-1MB-Cache-1_80-GHz\nHowever I never heard of 32-bit UEFI BIOS, I guess it must be compatibility mode (CSM).\n\nA: Just enable CSM in the bios since you don't want Windows 8 anymore. But before you do that create a recovery disk on a DVD or separate USB and backup anything important in case the install goes horribly wrong. Then boot your live usb and install ubuntu.\n", "Q: NIS client authentication How to configure the nis client on Ubuntu? And how to configure system authentication? There is no option for system authentication like system setting system info in my system etc.\nWhen ever I go to software center and search them nis authentication then I have one package for nis authentication and I try to install them then one error occur that is remove hostname utility. When I try to remove hostname utility then it does not remove.\n\nA: 1/ Add server to /etc/hosts. This means that you can still find the server if there is a DNS failure.\n2/ Install the software you need\nsudo apt-get install portmap nis\n\nYou will be asked for the name of your NIS domain. Enter the name of your NIS domain. If you entered wrongly or want to change the defaultdomain of NIS change it in the file /etc/defaultdomain\nrobotics\n\nFor example, robotics is the name of my NIS server. Remember this parameter is case sensitive. It is probably a good idea to then add a portmap line to /etc/hosts.allow for security reasons:\nportmap : <NIS server IP address>\n\nWhere \"NIS server IP address\" is the IP address of the NIS server.\n3/ Set up name services to use NIS:\nEdit /etc/passwd to add a line at the end saying:\n+::::::\n\nEdit /etc/group to add a line at the end saying:\n+:::\n\nEdit /etc/shadow to add a line at the end saying:\n+::::::::\n\nThis sets up those services to include NIS entries if a match isn't found in the file. You could change other services to use NIS by using the NIS service in /etc/nsswitch.conf, but these are the important ones.\n4/ Edit /etc/yp.conf and add the line:\nypserver 123.45.67.89\n\nypserver 987.65.43.21\n\nWhere 123.45.67.89 and 987.65.43.21 are the NIS servers.\n5/ Restart NIS:\n/etc/init.d/nis restart\n\n+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\nSource : NIS Config\n", "Q: Where synaptic touchpad settings in user account?

Let me give you some (incomplete) rules of thumb to help making this decision\n\n\n*\n\n*In case security in terms of immunity to virus infections matters do not have Windows as host.\n\n*Choose the operating system where you either spend most of the time with, or where the most processor demanding processes run as host.\n\n*The host operating system should be where applications run that need best graphic performance.\n\n*Choose an operating system as guest if you know that it may crash or when system settings change frequently. A virtual machine can provide snapshots for easy restore.\n\n*Do not have an unstable operating system host your virtual machines.\n", "Q: Can't get online accounts to work from behind proxy At work I am behind a proxy and I can't access my online accounts.

But before doing that, you need to make either a bootable DVD or a USB flash drive.  Since you're on Windows now, you can burn a DVD by using ImgeBurn.  Its a free application that will allow you to make a bootable DVD from the ISO.  Or if you prefer, you can use UNetbootin to make a bootable USB flash.\nOnce you do either of those, make sure you set your BIOS to boot from either the DVD or the USB flash, and then follow the instruction from mentioned in the answer, and comment.\n", "Q: change default printing settings Is there any way to change the default printing settings in the dialog box?\nFor instance, I would like the paper format to be always A4.

Perhaps this would be more appropriate?\nYou might also consider using rsync (i.e. rsync -avz $SRC $DST --delete), which would allow you to perform smaller backups each time, i.e. it will only transfer what changed`\nIt may help if you provided details on the external disk, i.e. what filesystem it is using, etc.\n\nA: From your description I get the feeling that there is something wrong with how or where the system has mounted the external disk. \nPlease note that it is not recommended to mount storage devices to folders that are not empty, so make sure of that (detach drive, check if folder is empty and if not empty it, then reattach drive) If this does not solve your problem, try the following procedure:\nPlease run \"mount -l\" (that's lowercase L) on a terminal. This will print a list of all mounted partitions. Look for your external disk name. \nIf you are not sure about the name do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down the computer (to unmount all filesystems)\n\n*Disconnect the external drive and reboot your computer\n\n*When boot sequence completes, open a terminal\n\n*Now reconnect your external drive, wait a couple of seconds and type \"dmesg\" on the terminal. This will produce a long list of messages but you are interested in the last 10 or so. Look for something like : \n\n\n[some_numbers_here] sd more_numbers [sdx] Some_message\nThe x in sdx can be a, b, c, etc depending on the number of drives you have installed in your system. If you have only 1 (sda), then the external drive will be sdb. If you have two internal drives (sda, sdb) then the external drive will be sdc and so on. \nA note here: These are physical drives and NOT partitions. Partitions are designated by a number being appended to the physical drive name,like sda1, sda2, etc\n\n\n*\n\n*Now that you know the drive name type \"mount -l\" on your terminal and look for the line that describes where your external disk is mounted. If you have not mounted any other storage device after connecting your external drive it will be the last line displayed. eg. \n/dev/sdb1 on /media/folder_name type fuseblk (rw,nosuid,nodev, ...\nThis folder_name should be the destination of your copy command.\n\nA: I faced the same problem earlier. It may not be the answer you are looking for, but I hope it's an alternative.\nFollow these steps:\n\n*\n\n*Boot from the recovery mode and I log into the terminal as root.\n\n\n*Run the command:\nsudo apt-get autoclean\n\n\n\n*Clean the trash using:\nrm -rf ~/.local/share/Trash/*\n\nAfter these steps, I was able to log in with ease.

Error: Before you can run Vmware several modules must be compiled and loaded into the running kernel. if i click on install nothing happens, kindly assist.\n\nA: In my case, I also encountered errors during installation of vmware player (some weird encoding things), I guess because 13.04 is not yet officially supported from vmware.\nAnyway, apart from uninstalling and reinsta1lling, in my case closing vmware and executing this at a terminal prompt:\nsudo vmware-modconfig --console --install-all\n\nwas also a valid workaround after, for instance, kernel security updates.\n\nA: I've resolved the same problem uninstalling and then reinstalling VMWare Player.\nTo uninstall it open a terminal and insert this command:\nsudo vmware-installer -u vmware-player\n\nThen you can proceed with the normal installation and everything should be fine.\n\nA: This is a common problem when updating to a new distribution or a new kernel. It is my understanding that VMWare products compile the necessary kernel modules at install time, and when the kernel changes you (almost?) always need to recompile the necessary modules. I'm not sure if there is a manual way of doing this - perhaps through a supplied script. The only way I am aware of is to uninstall and reinstall again as @lupp0l0 suggests in the previous answer. \nThis is the main reason I migrated to Virtualbox. Change in kernel? Just close the program, recompile module, re-run the program and you are set. Of course, this is a matter of personal preference, so stick with the program that suits your tastes. \n", "Q: Problem in configuration of Micromax MMX 355G in Ubuntu 12.04 Hi!

This seems to be a known problem, and at least one reason why \"--force-all\" is recommended.  \nThanks to this parameter, the installation reports no errors.\nHowever brsaneconfig3 still reports \"Syntax error: Unterminated quoted string\" when I use the command line with quotes as you recommend above, even if I execute it from the directory (/usr/local/Brother/sane) where brsaneconfig3 resides.  \nThe ls command you recommend presents the same results that you get (showing the same symlink definition), but if I try \"brsaneconfig3 -?\", I get \"bash: /usr/bin/brsaneconfig3: cannot execute binary file\".  brsaneconfig3 in /usr/bin is also a symlink to '/usr/local/Brother/sane/brsaneconfig3'.

As it turns out, I did not have the 64 bit version of Ubuntu installed.  I was sure I did, but I must have let myself be influenced by the Canonical standard recommendation for precise (12.04) to use 32 bit, or perhaps by those comments on the web indicating that 32 bit Ubuntu performs better than 64 bit with up to 3 GB RAM. More recent comments suggest that this is no longer the case.\nIAC, I was able to install the 32 bit version of the Brother driver without problems by following the instructions referred to in my original post, and it seems to work fine with xsane.\nIn retrospect, I should obviously have taken the warning \"package architecture (amd64) does not match system (i386)\" more seriously.  Oddly, I did not see this message after graduating from the driver version brscan3-0.2.11-4.amd64.deb to brscan3-0.2.11-5.amd64.deb unless I used the dpkg switch --force-architecture in addition to --force-all. \n", "Q: Eclipse: unresolved inclusion  and  As the title says ,I get warnings with those two issues ,\nThe code compiles and run ,but its driving me crazy all those red and yellow lines \nunder the code.\nHow can I remove them and still get the warnings and errors for \"real\" errors .\nI'm running eclipse 4.2.2 , coding in c language .\nsystem : Ubuntu 13.04 64 bit\n\nA: Note this is a warning from the IDE, not a warning from the compiler or an error.

I resolved this by setting th up_threshold lower (75 seems to do OK in my case). You change it by echo'ing the desired value to /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/ondemand/up_threshold.\n\nA: I would suggest that you should use Is there a power saving application similar to Jupiter?\n\nAnd use indicator-cpufreq, so that you should know what freq you are at. check the link i have pasted how to install/configure indicator-cpufreq\nIs there a power saving application similar to Jupiter?

Of the two, which is the better to run. I lean towards Avast.\n\nA: First of all running 2 anti virus programs on a system will probably decrease performance, and as octopusgrabbus said in his answer, they will conflict with each others, and probably\ncause a lot of false p[positive detections.\nLinux almost makes it hard for viruses to run However, you may want to install an Antivirus program, to secure your self if you share/transfer files over the network with Windows machines, or files that you get from friends that have Windows machine, such as documents.  For more information about antivirus programs that run under Ubuntu see Why do I need anti-virus software?\nBut if need to have an antivirus program, I would recommend ClamAV Antivirus\nSome of this information is complements of Ubuntu help\n\nA: As long as the two anti-virus programs do not collide with each other, it probably is not a problem, but you would have to know something about how each anti-virus works. \nDepending on how robust your system is, running one anti-virus program logically consumes some system resources, so running two anti-virus programs will consume more. You will have to decide if that is worth it.\nI have asked a lot of questions over the years about the need to run Linux/Unix a anti-virus program, and basically have been told that unless I was hosting a shared drive for Windows users, running Linux anti-virus was overkill, and, at one time, I had purchased NOD32, which is quite good and well know on Windows and Linux.\nOf course, things change, and hopefully someone else will weigh in on this question.\n", "Q: Change color of Applet context menu font or background As seen here http://i.imgur.com/9tySBEi.png, theres little contrast between the greys.\nI'm using the FlatStudio theme with Faenza Dark icons.

The output clearly states:\n /usr/bin/bkp.sh: line 22: p4: command not found\n\nAnd you said:\n\np4 is located into /usr/local/bin\n\nThis can mean just that $PATH does not include /usr/local/bin, that's all. So modify your cron script and add this after your shebang:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nset -e\nPATH=\"/usr/local/bin:$PATH\"\n\nNote: set -e will make your script quit if some commands fail. It is not required to solve your specific problem, but it may solve a lot of headaches in the future.

Well, you can imagine. \nHappily this has had very few adverse effects, as it obviously didn't delete any directories, but it seems to have deleted a LaTeX config file or something.\nI really have no idea what I've accidentally gotten rid of, but I had to reinstall texlive, just to be able to run pdflatex and xelatex and whilst they do now work, it's having trouble finding packages, which are definitely present in /usr/local/texlive/2011/texmf-dist/tex/latex/ \nIf I move the appropriate .sty files from here, then I have no problems.

For this to work, the installer created\nhidden files in your home directory, which you accidentally erased.\n\n*Then you installed TeXlive via apt-get or Ubuntu Software Center.

Not to say that it won't work but it's not going to be easy. Your fighting some pretty serious defaults. \nI would recommend two things. First create the users home directory from scratch, using adduser or whatever, you can specify the home directory with the -d flag. So you can do adduser jim -d /var/www/jim \nSharing a home directory between several users will not work without a ton of effort. \nNext, to restrict to scp/sftp only change their login to /bin/nologin. This will stop then from sshing or logging in locally. \nFinally, strongly consider why you want to chroot. In order to chroot you will effectively need a base system install for every home directory complete with some things in ~/bin ~/lib and ~/etc along with probably a lot else. I you truly must chroot a ssh session you can have a look at this link, however I strongly suggest against that for anything but a public ssh server. Even then I would want a really good reason for doing so personally. Keep in mind if you don't want them accessing a directory you can just chmod o-r it (that's what your first link suggests).\nIf your even considering chroot, then stay well away from FTP. FTP would typically be chrooted but FTP is insecure, so if your trying to secure something don't bother with FTP.

I'm reiterating the discussion from this ubuntu forum post: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2146595\nThe problem that everyone is happening is due to the Facebook 'Secure Browsing' option. This requires that Facebook logins and connections use HTTPS, instead of HTTP (secure HTTP vs normal HTTP). By default, I believe online accounts is using HTTP, so this just won't work.\nBecause of this, we have a couple of options.\nOption 1 (Insecure Solution):\nDisable Facebook Secure browsing through the security interface on Facebook.com. This will disable HTTPS defaults on ALL of your Facebook pages on ALL devices, e.g. cell phones, other computers, etc. This works, but it is not the ideal solution.\nOption 2 (Right Way):\nWe can simply request that online accounts just use an HTTPS connection, instead of an HTTP connection. To do this, we can use Derek Karpinski's previous advice (quoted below). This is essentially telling Online Accounts to try both HTTP and HTTPS. Since Facebook needs HTTPS, this is what we want. After doing his steps below, delete the Ubuntu app on Facebook (if you had previously tried and failed to add it), log out of Facebook, and close Online Accounts. You actually don't need to restart your computer, just close Online Accounts. Re-open Online Accounts and try again. and things should work fine!\nThis is how you fix it, run this command in a terminal:\ngksudo gedit /usr/share/accounts/providers/facebook.provider\n\nIt will open text editor.

Here's what I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Main Menu (alacarte?) but can't find the icon anywhere; can't drag it from the Main Menu list either.\n\n*When that didn't work, I tried creating minecraft.desktop & minecraft.sh files.\n\n*I was able to download and get a .png file on the launcher but it won't launch anything.\n\n\nHere's a rundown of all the commands and scripting I've done: \n\n\n*\n\n*Terminal Script that does work:\nsara@sara-Dimension-4300:~$ cd /home/sara/MCserver\nsara@sara-Dimension-4300:~/MCserver$ java -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar minecraft_server.jar nogui\n\n\n*\"Main Menu\" command script:\njava -Xmx1024M -Xms512M -Xincgc -jar /home/sara/MCserver/minecraft.jar\n\n\n*minecraft.sh script:\n#!/bin/bash\ncd $(home/MCserver \"$0\")\njava -Xmx1024M -Xms512M -cp minecraft.jar net.minecraft.LauncherFrame\n\n\n*minecraft.desktop script:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=MineCraft\nComment=\nExec=/home/sara/MCserver/minecraft.sh\nIcon=/usr/share/icons/Minecraft_Block.svg\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nStartupNotify=true\n\n\n*All files are stored in the MCserver folder. When I open the folder on Launcher, it starts at Home -- then MCserver is one of the folders within Home (I don't see \"Sara\" as a subdirectory of Home here -- sometimes I see it when accessing other files somewhere).\n\n@edwin:  here's the copy of la /home/sara\nsara@sara-Dimension-4300:~/MCserver$ la /home/sara\n.bash_history  examples.desktop       .ICEauthority       .profile\n.bash_logout   .fontconfig            .java               Public\n.bashrc        .gconf                 .local              .pulse\n.cache         .gnome2                MCserver            .pulse-cookie\n.config        .goutputstream-KIZ8WW  minecraft.desktop~  Templates\n.dbus          .goutputstream-QXYAXW  minecraft.png       .thumbnails\nDesktop        .goutputstream-UZYSWW  .mission-control    Videos\n.dmrc          .gstreamer-0.10        .mozilla            .Xauthority\nDocuments      .gtk-bookmarks         Music               .xsession-errors\nDownloads      .gvfs                  Pictures            .xsession-errors.old\n\n\nA: The script should read:\n#!/bin/bash\ncd $HOME/MCserver\njava -Xmx1024M -Xms512M -cp minecraft.jar net.minecraft.LauncherFrame\n\nAfter writing it, you should make it executable, so open a terminal and if the script\nis in a file called minecraft.sh (check if the casing is right, upper and lower \ncase matter!):\n$ cd $HOME/MCserver\n$ chmod +x minecraft.sh\n\nFinally you must put minecraft.desktop in /usr/share/applications or\nin $HOME/.local/share/applications (not both, only one of the two):\n\n\n*\n\n*Do this if you want all users to have the Minecraft icon:\n$ sudo mv minecraft.desktop /usr/share/applications\n\n*Or do this if you want only the current user to have the Minecraft icon:\n$ mv minecraft.desktop $HOME/.local/share/applications\nThe launcher should appear in the Unity Dash (so you can search for it typing \"Minecraft\"). Then you can just drag it to the panel.\n", "Q: Problem When connected through RDP to XRDP in ubuntu current windows open arent show When I remote access into my computer through RDP using XRDP on my Linux machine,I cannot see the last opened windows that I left when I login through other computer to my home computer.

As already reported, there is a bug with 13.04. I tried Banshee. There is also a bug with that, which has been reported. Is there any audio player out there that can record internet radio and make each song an .mp3?\nI have tried VLC (can make one file as far as I can tell), Streamripper2, Clementine and Audacious. Streamripper2 works but does not have the stations I want. I really like 13.04, except for this issue. It is faster than 12.10 and 12.04 and I had no issues installing the video card driver, so my preference is to stay with 13.04.\nI seem to have hit a dead end on various websites looking for an alternative.

If not, download the .iso and make one so you can run Ubuntu from disc after installing Windows.\nIf you are only going to be using Windows for Metin2 and little else, you may want to evaluate the current status of your partition sizes. Windows doesn't like being resized (disk checks and other possible hiccups), so if you're gonna use gparted to resize it's best to do it before installing Windows.\nInstall Windows into your unpartitioned disk space. Put in your Ubuntu live CD. Then follow the steps in the link referred to you by psusi in the comments.\nEDIT: I almost forgot. Of course, you'll wanna back up your valuables before using gparted on any operating system. I've never had any problems with resizing or moving Ubuntu, but that doesn't mean it couldn't happen. Also, if you have the time or desire and you haven't already done it, it's good practice to put your /home folder on a separate partition. That way if you ever have to or want to reinstall Ubuntu you won't have to copy your personal stuff back and forth.\n", "Q: Completely separate full screen OpenGL context on second monitor For a 3D scanner implementation I need to precisely control the output of a projector connected as a second monitor to my graphics card. I would need to issue OpenGL commands in a full screen context on this second monitor using a second X server instance. I am on Ubuntu 13.04 with a Dell Precision T3600 Workstation containing a AMD V7900 GPU.\nHow do I get one X server with Unity on the main screen and a second X server instance for the projector which contains only a fullscreen OpenGL context?\n\nA: OK, I came up with a solution, albeit it is a bit trickery.\nI have configured my graphics driver for a multi display setup. This way each \"monitor\" is represented as a separate X screen. Ubuntu Unity does not play nicely with this, as it currently expects a XrandR setup with a single virtual screen. \nHowever, by erasing the relative screen location information from my xorg.conf, Unity is ignoring the second screen altogether. Now, I can create a fullscreen OpenGL context on the second X screen without any interference from the OS.\nThe top of my xorg.conf looks like this:\nSection \"ServerLayout\"\n    Identifier     \"amdcccle Layout\"\n    Screen      0  \"amdcccle-Screen[5]-0\" 0 0\n    Screen         \"amdcccle-Screen[5]-1\"\nEndSection\nIn the old-style multi-screen setup, the second screen would have position specifiers (e.g. 1920 0 or \"Right of Screen 0\"). By removing them, the second screen is ignored.\n", "Q: how do I run Ubuntu from disk I am unable to boot from the disk I burned of the image I downloaded from the Ubuntu website.

I only want to run Ubuntu from the disk.\n\nA: *\n\n*Put the disk in your computer\n\n*Turn your computer off\n\n*Turn it on again\n\n*It should now boot from the disk. You can test-drive Ubuntu without installing it, or install it.\n\n\nA: Make sure that the downloaded ISO is OK.  You can verify that by doing an MD5SUM.  Also make sure that you have downloaded the right ISO for your system (32Bit or 64Bit). \nMake sure that you set your systems BIOS to boot from CD/DVD.  If you're still having problems, try creating a bootable USB flash drive.

The display is my 32\" Samsung LCD TV with a max resolution of 1366x768.\nIn the display options it is picking up the incorrect display information. The VGA output displays a 19\" while the HDMI picks up a 7\".\nI have read in a fourum that it has to do possible with incorrect EDID information from the display and you need to change the xorg.conf file with the line: \nOption \"UseEDID\" \"False\" \nBut 13.04 doesn't come with an xorg.conf file anymore?\nIs this the correct and best way to resolve this and if so how?\n\nA: I did some more searching and came across this page https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Config/Resolution . This is the part that helped me :)\nAdding undetected resolutions\nDue to buggy hardware or drivers, your monitor's correct resolutions may not always be detected. For example, the EDID data block queried from your monitor may be incorrect.\nIf the mode already exists, but just isn't associated for the particular output, you can add it like this:\n$ xrandr --addmode S-video 800x600\nIf the mode doesn't yet exist, you'll need to create it first by specifying a modeline:\n$ xrandr --newmode \nYou may create a modeline using the gtf or cvt utility. For example, if you want to add a mode with resolution 800x600 at 60 Hz, you can enter the following command: (The output is shown following.)\n$ cvt 800 600 60\n# 800x600 59.86 Hz (CVT 0.48M3) hsync: 37.35 kHz; pclk: 38.25 MHz\nModeline \"800x600_60.00\"   38.25  800 832 912 1024  600 603 607 624 -hsync +vsync\nThen copy the information after the word \"Modeline\" into the xrandr command:\n$ xrandr --newmode \"800x600_60.00\"   38.25  800 832 912 1024  600 603 607 624 -hsync +vsync\nAfter the mode is entered, it needs to be added to the output using the --addmode command as explained above.\nI'm not sure if its a driver issue but I see that my sounds not either working on my TV via the HDMI and it does not pick up the HDMI sound driver in the sound settings. \n", "Q: Remotely control Ubuntu server from Ubuntu laptop over my phones wifi hotspot? I need to be able to control my home Ubuntu server while im at work using my Ubuntu laptop over my phone's wifi hotspot. Speed isn't an issue, it's the same as my home DSL. Ive been using Chrome Remote Desktop in Windows but would rather not have to dual boot.\n\nA: Before applying any of the following make sure you understand the security risk of exposing your system to the world at large.\nIf all you need is a terminal window, then you will only need a couple of things to setup.\nFirst, you need to install and configure secure shell daemon (sshd) on your server - that is if it's not already installed.\nSecond, you need to have a static way of referring to your home network from the outside world. If your service provider has assigned a static IP on your connection, you just type \nssh user_name@your_static_ip \nin a terminal window to connect to your server.\nIf you have a dynamic IP, then you can use one of the dynamic dns services available to get a meaningful name assigned to your address each time you connect to the internet. Check your router for support of dynDNS services and configure that. Then on a terminal type\nssh user_name@selected_dyndns_name\n\nto connect to your server.\nLast, you will probably have to open port 22 (the default for ssh) on your firewall(s).\nAgain, make sure that you understand the security risks. A simple misconfiguration may leave your entire network exposed to the internet. This is no fun stuff.\n\nA: I've been playing around with Amahi Home Server which has an OpenVPN module and also DDNS built right in. You'd install Amahi on your home machine (or another machine in your home) and you'd be able to use an OpenVPN client available for your phone, PC etc... and connect via SSH to your home machine(s)... works really well and is very easy to setup.. I've setup a VM running Amahi, but you could easily have this on your server, or on something as simple as a plug machine (their are instructions on the site).. it's free... http://www.amahi.org/\n", "Q: where should I install windows? here is a picture of \"GParted\".  \nWhere should I install windows (which partition?)? \nIt's SDA1? I'm not sure because there are 20gb in use and I don't know why. It's possible that's the older version of ubuntu? I chosen in ubuntu installer to install ubuntu 12.04 next to ubuntu 13 but i'm not sure. \n\nA: Remember that if you want to dual boot Windows and Ubuntu you must install\nWindows first in a primary partition, leaving enough free space for Ubuntu.\nYour /dev/sda1 partitions contains /boot, that is, the files necessary to boot\nyour Ubuntu system (i.e., the kernel image).\nThis means that if you want to install Windows you will have to format your\ndrive (erasing Ubuntu and everything), install Windows leaving space for Ubuntu,\nand then install Ubuntu on the free space left.\nAfter formatting you should create a partition table that looks like this:\n/dev/sda1 --> primary partition for Windows (say 100 GB)\n/dev/sda2 --> extended (say the rest, for example)\n\nInside the extended partition you would install Ubuntu however you wish.\nYou could use all the remaining space not used on Windows or you could\ndo something else... like dividing it between Ubuntu and a vfat partition\n(to share between both OSs).\nIf you plan to format your drive, I recommend the following approach:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get Ubuntu's live CD/DVD and burn to a CD/DVD or pendrive.\n\n*Boot into the live media (CD or DVD or pendrive) and choose 'Try Ubuntu'.\n\n*Start GParted and erase all the partitions on your hard drive (I am assuming you\nare working with ONE hard drive, you should be careful not to erase valuable\ndata).\n\n*In GParted go to Device -> Create partition table\n\n*Add a primary partition, make sure to set it to an appropriate size\nfor your Windows installation (say ~ 100 GB). Leave enough space for  Ubuntu.\n\n*Add an extended partition, you may want to use up the remaining free space.\n\n\nNow you can shutdown, remove the live media, and insert your Windows DVD in order to\ninstall Windows on the first partition (the primary one) we created. After installing\nWindows, you can shutdown and use the Ubuntu live media to install Ubuntu on the extended\npartition.\n\nA: The general rule of thumb is to install Windows first on it's own partition and then install Ubuntu on the other so that a menu is created for you...  Installing Windows second is more hassle than it's worth but can be done if you know how to use grub effectively...\n", "Q: Wubi + Multiple Windows Installations I have a question about the Windows installer: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/install-ubuntu-with-windows If today I have two distinct Windows XP installations (one in English and one in Russian) and when I boot up, I can choose between the English and Russian installation, will I be able, after installing the Ubutnu Windows Installer, to select between English/Russian and Linux?\n\nA: Yes. \nWubi uses the Windows boot manager (there is only one).

Whenever I open the dash and type into it, Chromium opens up and opens an \"about:blank\" tab for just about every letter I write into the dash.

Correct any errors listed.\n\nIn any case, re-authorizing my Google accounts seems to have fixed the problem for me. Hope this helps.\n\nA: Fixed. Quite a weird bug.

RTL8188CE 802.11b/g/n WiFi Adapter (rev 01)\nThe wifi network connection is relatively slow, but more seriously, repeatedly drops completely every few minutes. It usually recovers in a minute or so, but then drops again in 1-3 minutes. Running Windows 8 (ugh) on the same system, the connection never drops. Some of the solutions proposed, involve compiling/installing a new driver from Realtek - I'm really not comfortable doing that. Another suggested adding a /etc/modprobe.d/rtl8192.conf file containing a \"options rtl8192ce ips=0 debug=2\" line. I tried that - no effect. Another solution proposed deleting the network manager and installing something called \"wicd\". I haven't tried that yet, wondering, if \"wicd\" didn't help/work, could I use apt-get to purge it and re-install the network manager to get back to where I am?\nSuggestions?\n\nA: You mention that you aren't comfortable compiling and installing a driver, but unfortunately you can't do this without that.  Fortunately, because of the pain I went through personally, I have made it as easy as possible for you.  I fixed the compile issues on 13.04 with the RTL8188CE driver and put detailed instructions for install up on my Git Hub.  \nThis version fixes the compile error and also fixes the hard-coded Tx Power value that  was set to 22 dBm.\nFirst install Git and build dependencies:\nsudo apt-get install git\napt-get install gcc build-essential linux-headers-generic linux-headers-`uname -r`\n\nThen clone the repo.  I like to make a directory in my home folder and put it there:\ncd ~\nmkdir gitclone && cd gitclone\ngit clone https://github.com/FreedomBen/rtl8188ce-linux-driver/blob/master/README.md\ncd rtl8188ce-linux-driver\n\nThen follow the instructions in README.md\nEDIT: 22-Jan-2015\nIt is now even easier.  Install git:\nsudo apt-get install git\n\nand run this command \ngit clone https://github.com/FreedomBen/rtl8188ce-linux-driver.git && cd rtl8188ce-linux-driver && ./install.sh`\n\n\nA: Based on this blog post and my own attempts to solve the problem (though I haven't run it for long, so YMMV), you can try the following:\nFirstly, download the manufacturer drivers. You'll need to navigate through the tree to find the right one (in an attempt to keep this post somewhat future proof). Certainly, for me to get the RTL8188CE driver, I navigated to the IEEE 802.11b/g/n single-chip option, and then just ticked the relevant boxes.\nNext untar the sources and attempt to install with sudo make, sudo make install. The sources I downloaded required some modification. It seems that the __devinit macros were removed from the kernel in 3.8, so I had to remove __devinit from pci.h and pci.c and also remove __devinitdata from each sw.c in each of the driver directories (that is, I removed the single word in the function definition). After that, make and make install worked just fine.\nI think that should be sufficient as it seems to overwrite the previously installed rtl8192ce.ko module, so it should just work with the new driver on reboot.\nI expect it would be necessary to redo this after each kernel upgrade (assuming you still need it of course!).\n", "Q: binary is whitelisted installin from live-cd win8 i'm trying to install ubuntu 12.04.2 64bit on a asus k55n running a preinstalled win8.\nthe bios (of uefi o this computer) are set to load from UEFI usb device, the fast boot is disabled and the \"launch CSM\" that is a similar to secure booting is also disabled.\nthe grub window opens (gnu grub version 1.99-2 ubuntu3.9 ) with the regular 3 options (try with out install, install, check disk for errors) but any option i choose spit a \"binary is whitelisted\" , and stop there without booting.\ni've look in the ubuntu forum for answers but (even if quite a few asus owner have the similar problems), but as nothing boots i cannot change nomodeset or grub parameters. \ni'm really stuck and none af the many posts i read on the subject seems to be usefull...\nthank you really much to anyone that can help, Cri\n\nA: First, the \"binary is whitelisted\" message is displayed by the program that Ubuntu uses to deal with Secure Boot (namely, shim); it indicates that the follow-on program (typically GRUB) is properly signed and therefore trusted. There's no need to \"whitelist the ubuntu efi in your bios,\" as bodhi.zazen suggests.\nSecond, the \"launch CSM\" option you mention is not similar to Secure Boot. Under a \"bare-bones\" EFI implementation, all OSes boot using unsigned EFI boot loaders. The Compatibility Support Module (CSM) and Secure Boot both change this, but in entirely different ways. CSM is just another name for a BIOS emulation layer, aka \"legacy boot\" mode. Enabling CSM means that the computer will be able to boot a BIOS-mode OS -- but usually, enabling CSM doesn't guarantee a BIOS-mode boot; other factors determine whether the computer boots in BIOS mode. Secure Boot, by contrast, is mutually exclusive with a BIOS-mode boot; Secure Boot requires that all EFI boot loaders be signed with a private encryption key whose public counterpart is stored in the computer's NVRAM. Note that many EFIs permit enabling both CSM and Secure Boot; the firmware decides how to boot depending on what it finds on the hard disk and what its boot order settings are. Some EFIs, though, block BIOS/CSM/legacy-mode boots if Secure Boot is active.\nThus, by disabling the CSM option, you've simply ruled out the possibility of booting Ubuntu in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode. This is probably a good thing, since Windows 8 is almost always installed in EFI mode, and mixing boot modes across two OSes can get tricky. The \"binary is whitelisted\" message you got, though, indicates that Secure Boot is still enabled on your computer. (If it were disabled, shim would instead produce a message to that effect.)\nUnfortunately, Ubuntu's Secure Boot support is based on an early version of shim, and I've seen quite a few reports of problems with that support. Thus, my initial suggestion is to go back into your firmware setup utility, find the options that control Secure Boot, and disable it.\nAnother thing to try is a firmware update. Sadly, many EFIs are buggy; but the better manufacturers, including ASUS, have been issuing frequent bug-fix updates. Thus, it's possible that updating your firmware will get you past this hurdle.\nIf neither of those suggestions help, then it gets trickier. Replacing GRUB on your Ubuntu install medium with another EFI boot loader is a possibility, but this is likely to be a significant challenge if you're not already familiar with EFI boot loader installation. It's also much harder on CD/DVD media than on a USB flash drive. Another option would be to go into the firmware, enable a CSM-mode boot, and install Ubuntu in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode. You can then install an EFI boot loader for Linux on your hard disk, which might be easier to get working than doing it on the Ubuntu install medium.\n", "Q: proxy chain application Please recommend proxy chain application for Ubuntu like proxifier.\nProxifier support proxies in HTTPS and SOCKS.

However, I disconnected my HDD and the windows did boot from SSD.I used the live USB to boot Ubuntu and let it do the partitioning and install Ubuntu on the external HDD. I still had the same problem and Ubuntu did not boot. Then I used the live USB and installed Boot-Repair. After running Boot-repair and a restart everything was good, and Ubuntu did boot from HDD. However, there is a line before booting into Ubuntu: ata_id[279]: HDIO_GET_IDENTITY failed for '/dev/sdb': Invalid argument But the system boots.\nBoot Info Script: Here is a Boot Info Script I got after using Boot Repair. \nI tried to change the partitioning and partition sizes. After reading here, I changed the partitioning using Gparted.\nI also installed the bootloader in /dev/sda1 which is flagged as the /boot partition. As expected after installation and a reboot, Ubuntu did not boot. So by following this and this posts, I tried to register the bootloader to the EFI. But I was not successful. I even noticed that my machine might have this problem, and I changed the /EFI/Ubuntu/bootx64.efi name and location but no effect, Ubuntu did not want to boot. \nAgain, I used boot repair to solve the boot problem and it worked like the previous time and I am in Ubuntu. But I really like to know what is causing this problem. The interesting thing is that Boot Repair has created all possible folders and files.

The \"lync Web app\" client does not work on Linux even with the binaries of the mono project. For the time being Microsoft doesn't say if they have it on their road map.\nThere are third party Linux clients (including one that Microsoft qualified, the snom embedded client that does presence and enterprise voice). The protocol documentation makes it possible for the Linux community to build such clients. There is no Microsoft built full client, but the Microsoft OWA web client is supported on Linux and delivers IM and Presence.\nYou can try The SIPE Project, which is a third-party Pidgin plugin for Microsoft LCS/OCS.\n\nThe SIPE project develops a third-party plugin for the Pidgin\n  multi-protocol instant messenger. It implements the extended version\n  of SIP/SIMPLE used by various products such as Microsoft Office\n  Communications Server, Reuters Messaging, Microsoft Live\n  Communications Server.

Well I can do that, I can boot live session, plug in my external HDD, mount my Ubuntu partition, and copy the 40-generic-pae modules I have to that system.\n\n*\n\n*I believe I can do this, correct?\n\n*Would this be the way to go?\n\n*If so, should I just copy the whole folder /package straight back into /lib/modules, and then reboot?\n\n*Or is there a different way I should do it?\n\nCan anyone help me with this?\n\nA: Determine the output of uname -a. For example: 4.2.0-18-generic.\nThen as you described above, use the LiveCD method to boot.\nDownload the following packages (replace 4.2.0-18-generic with your output above):\napt-get download linux-image-4.2.0-18-generic, linux-headers-4.2.0-18-generic, linux-image-extra-4.2.0-18-generic\n\nNext copy these into your broken system's hard-drive. Reboot into your broken system and sudo dpkg -i all of these packages.\n\nA: I made the same mistake and here is what worked for me (with a cable connection): \nIn a terminal, run the command:\ndpkg -l | grep linux-image-.*-generic\n\nSelect the kernel version you want to reinstall and run (typing the actual version instead of 4.X.Y-ZZ):\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall linux-image-4.X.Y-ZZ-generic\n\n", "Q: How to make XFCE reserve space for panel on the right monitor? I'm using Xubuntu 13.04 on my laptop that has an external screen attached. The big external monitor also has a vertical panel. My external screen is on the right side of my laptop.\nWhen I maximize windows on my external monitor, the panel overlaps those. However, when I maximize windows on my smaller laptop monitor, there seems to be the panel's width reserved in space (which is just empty)\nHow can I make it reserve space on the right monitor?\nMy setup looks like this (generated with arandr and modified (right-of and primary are by me, trying to solve the problem):\n#!/bin/sh\nxrandr --output HDMI1 --primary --right-of LVDS1 --mode 1920x1080 --pos 1440x0 --rotate normal \\\n--output LVDS1 --mode 1440x900 --pos 0x368 --rotate normal \\\n--output TV1 --off --output VGA1 --off\n\n\nA: For anyone looking into this problem, unfortunately this appears to be (a long standing) bug in xfce: https://bugzilla.xfce.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9693. Also see my thread on the xfce forums that describe the same issue: https://forum.xfce.org/viewtopic.php?id=8802\n\nA: OK, I fixed it! \nI went to panel->panel settings->Unchecked \"Lock panel\". Now grepped the panel from outer right side (with the dots). I moved the panel up and forced it down again. This last step will cause the xfce panel to be recognized again as a bottom panel, meaning it will stay up front whenever I maximize a window.\nYou can now \"Lock the panel\" again within the settings.

The init daemon control tool is not starting the mysql server daemon into /etc/init.\nYou can restore by hand: \nsudo initctl reload-configuration\n\nNow mysql server starts as expected.\n\nA: about the unknown job, mine solved using this \nsudo /etc/init.d/mysql start\n\ninstead of this \nsudo service mysql start\n\nHere where I refer\n\nA: sudo apt-get install mysql-server\n\nThen once it's installed make sure /var/lib/mysql exists and that /etc/init.d/mysql exists. /usr/bin/mysqld and /usr/bin/mysqld_safe should also exist. \nIf your still having problems then there's a problem with package (assuming you get no errors there). You can \"purge\" it, \"update\" and then \"install\" the package to see if that clears the error.\nsudo apt-get purge mysql-server\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install mysql-server\n\nIf that still doesn't work you will need to file a bug with the package maintainers.\n\nA: This is probably not a tech solution but more a work around. I've tried this and everything else that's making rounds on the internet to fix this problem. Nothing worked.\nAt last I downgraded the packages back to MYSQL 5.29 and it worked like a charm.\nThanks.\n\nA: I just had this problem now and solved it.  \nAlthough you installed mysql-server, the daemon needs to be running in order for the client to connect to it.  \nFirst check to see if mysql server is running: \nnetstat -tap | grep mysql\n\nYou should see something like this: \n$ sudo netstat -tap | grep mysql\ntcp        0      0 localhost:mysql         *:*          LISTEN     6639/mysqld     \n\nIf you don't have the server running, start the daemon by the following command:\n/etc/init.d/mysql restart\n\nThis should solve your problem.  \n", "Q: How can I specify which programs play sound through headphones and which ones play through speakers? When I used Windows (sorry for bringing it up,) I could specify in the sound control menu which programs I wanted playing through which speakers. For example, I could have Skype playing through my headphones, while having a game playing sound through my loudspeakers.\nNow, I know that this is possible using some virtual output options, but I have another problem: on Linux, whether I select \"Headphones\" or \"Analog Output\", the sound goes through my headphones if they're plugged in, and the only way to use my speakers is by unplugging them. I'm using the headphone port on the front of my case, and the audio port on the back of my motherboard, and I don't have a dedicated sound card, so I know this might be a hardware issue. However, I know it's possible, because I was able to do it through Windows.\nA few more details: I'm currently using PulseAduio, but I'd be happy to ditch it. I'm using Kubuntu. Finally, I want to clarify, as I've seen some people answer others incorrectly due to a lack of understanding: I do NOT want to mirror my sound across both devices. I want SOME applications to play through my speakers, and other apps to play through my headphones.\n\nA: Click on the sound indicator and go to settings. Then on the application tab there is a per application setting for output and input device. It it doesn't have it there then you can looking in pavucontrol (you may have to install it).  It's a bit more complicated to use but works quite well.\n", "Q: VMWare stopped working after I upgraded.

I have forgotten now the bunch of files I have installed.\nThe problem is that when I plug my S3mini into my computer it is not recognized, however if I change the way of connecting form MTP to PPT (I believe is PPT the other way) it does connect, and if I go back to MTP again it does connect. The problem is that I cannot move big files from and into my cellphone's internal storage.\nI know and I use Airdroid for small files, I have Dropbox but my internet is limited and slow, and both options (Airdroid and Dropbox) take years in copying a movie onto the cellphone.\n\nA: I found the solution by updating some packages from a PPA...\nI've found the solution in this page:\nhttp://www.webupd8.org/2013/01/upgrade-to-gvfs-with-mtp-support-in.html\n\nA: I have an S3 Mini (Android 4.1.2), and am able to connect to 12.04 LTS using various methods ..\nI have used MTP mode, and modified udev rules. Then I need to run a mount / unmount commands. Really quite cumbersome, but still workable.\nI found just using SSHDroid (free Android app.) over WiFi was simpler, faster, and reliable. I can SSH (command line) and connect (to server) from within Nautilus.\nI have Ubuntu 12.04 LTS on my main PC, but can probably re-test these methods on 12.10.

It does not make much sense to use non-native resolution on an LCD display, but if you want to make everything smaller you can do it by using xrandr to scale your display.\nSee this question for more details: How do I achieve higher resolution than physical resolution of an LCD?\n\nA: As my blog post, here, suggests\nsudo xrandr --newmode \"1600x900_60.00\"  118.25  1600 1696 1856 2112  900 903 908 934 -hsync +vsync\nsudo xrandr --addmode VBOX0 \"1600x900_60.00\"\nsudo xrandr --output VBOX0 --mode \"1600x900_60.00\"\n\n\n*\n\n*First command creates a new mode with resolution 1600x900\n\n*Second command makes it available for use, with display (in this case VBOX0)\n\n*Third command selects the newly added mode as the display resolution for the specified display\n\nTo change this to any custom resolution, just replace 1600 with the width you want and 900 with the height you want.\n", "Q: How do I set MATE 1.6 to use Compiz? MATE desktop has recently migrated, as of version 1.6, from using mateconf-editor to gsettings. This breaks traditional solutions for changing MATE's window manager to Compiz.\n\nA: I assume you have already installed Compiz. If not:\nsudo apt-get install compiz\n\ngsettings has an equivalent operation to the mateconf-editor key-change operation you had to do to set the window manager to Compiz. Now, to activate Compiz, simply run the following terminal command:\nsudo gsettings set org.mate.session.required-components windowmanager compiz\n\nThis will change the windowmanager key to compiz in the org.mate.session.required-components schema. Next, I highly recommend installing CompizConfig Settings Manager:\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\nWith this, you are done. You may either run compiz --replace in the Terminal to start Compiz, or simply reboot your machine. I recommend the latter, as the former may have problems.\n", "Q: How to install Synaptic package manager that I have already downloaded the package using Windows?

The read/write speed was very low, I read on askubuntu that using the async mount option helps. Then I started using it as follows:\nmount -o async,rw /dev/sdb1 /media/a/\n\nEvery time I plugin the HDD, I first unmount it then go to command line to mount it using the above command. I also have a 16GB pendrive and that is slower on Ubuntu than Windows 7, I suspect using async could help me there as well.\n\n\n*\n\n*What does async do?\n\n*Is there a way to make async as the default option during automounts?\n\n*Is it advisable to do so?\n\n\nA: *\n\n*async means that when data is written to the drive it is not committed immediately. This causes writes to \"bunch up\" so you can write them all one at a time. It also means your commands won't have to wait for the write to complete.\n\n*Yes, you can add an entry for the drive to /etc/fstab. The line would look something like this:\n/dev/sdb1 /media/a/ auto auto,async 0 0\n\nFor an explanation of what each field means, please see man fstab.\n\n*It's fine as long as you never plug out the disc without unmounting. I know people say you shouldn't do this on Windows either, but with async you really shouldn't do this. You might think that the drive is done writing, but writes can sit in the write queue for a surprisingly long time.\n", "Q: Skype-call-recorder keeps showing up legal information I've installed skype-call-recorder.

I visit some forums, it tells that the default password is password, but it doesn't work, how can I determine the password?\n\nA: As has been pointed out by other answers there is no default sudo password.  When you installed Ubuntu you were asked for a password it is the one you created then that you need.\nThe computer does not store the password anywhere but a hash value created from it; when you type a password a hash value is calculated and this is compared to the hash stored from the correct password.\nThis makes it very difficult to find the password.\nIf you have lost the password you can reset it however.  See This question\nHow do I reset a lost administrative password? \n\nA: By default the root account is disabled, therefore there is no password for it. \nIf you want to run a command with root privileges simply prefix it with 'sudo', it will ask you for the password to the account you are logged in with (not the root account). Assuming that account is an administrator, of course.\nIf you want to elevate that entire command session to root privileges type 'sudo su', you will still need to enter the password to your account.\n\nA: Sudo password is the password that you put in the instalation of ubuntu/yours user password, if you don't have a password just click enter at all. Thats easy probaly you need to be an administrator user for using sudo.\nSorry for the spelling\n\nA: There is no default password for sudo.  The password that is being asked,   is the same password that you set when you installed Ubuntu - the one you use to login.\n\nA: Sudo is asking for the user's password it's called with. In your case the password in question is the password of the user genz, hence it says [sudo] password for genz:\n", "Q: Need help adding a PPA This is the command i am typing in the terminal.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:gregory-halnaut/pcsx2.official.ppa\n\nAnd this is the reply I am getting.\nCannot access PPA (https://launchpad.net/api/1.0/~gregory-halnaut/+archive/pcsx2.official.ppa) to get PPA information, please check your internet connection.\n\nThe internet connection is fine.\nCan anyone help me ? \nI need BIOS ROMs for the pcsx2 emulator and in a tutorial on youtube I saw that I had to execute this command. \n\nA: You have mistyped one letter, an l instead of an i in hainaut.\nThe correct path is\nhttps://launchpad.net/api/1.0/~gregory-hainaut/+archive/pcsx2.official.ppa\n\nA: To install PS2 Emulator in Ubuntu, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal.

Is there a specific folder for the hibernation partition or a file by which it keeps the RAM data on hibernate?  Is someone wanted to get rid of all command history/program load history/program execution history, where would they go?\n\nA: Your bash history file is in your home directory:    /home/your-user-name/.bash_history\nZeitgeist user history is stored in  ~/.local/share/zeitgeist. \nTo reset the Zeitgeist history, open a terminal and copy/paste the following commands: \nrm ~/.local/share/zeitgeist/activity.sqlite\n\nOr navigate to that directory in Nautilus or your file manager and  manually delete the sqlite database \"activity.sqlite\". It will be created again by Zeitgeist minus your previous user history. \nI do not feel comfortable telling  users to use some    commands unless they understand the command completely  and  are  careful to double check that the command is written correctly,  especially any command  beginning with rm  since   a user could easily  do irreparable damage to their system if the command was incorrectly formatted, but to better answer the OP's question as suggested in comments, the  system logs are stored in \nvar/log\n But I have heard of people  causing  problems by deleting  subdirectories inside the log directory\nas is mentioned here Can I delete /var/log files due to low root space?\nBut keep in mind that if you need to troubleshoot some  system problem the logs will be very useful.\nYou can delete the contents of the journal folder by opening  a terminal and copy and paste the following command: \nsudo rm /var/log/journal/*\n\nTo see how much space it is using on your computer you can open a terminal and issue the query: \njournalctl --disk-usage\nMy system is currently is using  3.9GB.\n\nA: There are a lot of places where things get logged, and it will be very diffucult to be exhaustive, depending on what applications you use. That said, here are the main places I can think of:\n\n\n*\n\n*most system logs go into /var/log\n\n*firefox stores your history, cookies, etc... in ~/.mozilla/firefox\nThis can be purged from Firefox (shift+ctrl+suppr)\n\n*zeitgeist is an history daemon, that populates the dash recent history. It can be purged from the privacy settings\n\n*terminal command history is saved on a per-user basis in ~/.bash_history Deleting this file will remove this history.\n\n*gnome applications (gedit, nautilus, etc...) store recently used files in ~/.local/share/recently-used.xbel This file can be deleted if needed.\n\n\nThese are the main places I can think of, but any application can log things in various places... so it really depends on what logs you want to remove.\nAs mentionned by MrVaykadji, BleachBit is a GPL software that automates such cleansing task, and let you delete \"log files\" for a wide variety of known softwares. You can also easily add new cleaners with simple xml files. Might be what you are (ware) looking for!\n\nA: It is located in: ~/.bash_history\n\nA: It has to be taken under consideration that other than the logs mentioned above, many (if not most) applications keep their own individual logs in different locations.  So as mentioned by alci, the answer really depends on what you want to sanitize.  \nAlso it would be wise that, if the need does really exist you may want to try out your script writing skills to automate based on actual, specific needs of log sanitizing.\n", "Q: How can I change partition table without data loss?

Windows doesn't boot without AHCI, so AHCI must be on if I want to use the hard disk with windows later}\nOK, I have repeated installation of 13.04 64 bit and let Boot-repair repair it, because boot-repair found an EFI this time.

Is this correct? Perhaps I should do something to effect this, other than putting the harddisk as bootdisk? There is an option to load an efi in the bios, but this doesn find anything\nWhen I boot from the harddisk I get a black screen with: reboot and select a proper device.\nMainboard: ASRock z68 Extreme3 Gen3, BIOS american megatrends\n\nA: The Boot Repair script has clearly failed; you most emphatically do have an EFI System Partition (ESP), and as you say, your computer does seem to be set up for an EFI-mode boot. The output you've posted (which obviates the need for the parted output that geezanansa requested) lacks information on what EFI boot loaders are installed -- probably because the script has inexplicably misidentified the ESP as not being an ESP. To proceed, you should mount /dev/sda and find all the files on that partition that end in .efi. For instance, you could boot a Linux live CD, mount /dev/sda1 at /boot/efi, and issue the following command:\nls -l `find /boot/efi -iname \"*.efi\"`\n\nPost the results here. Also, please say what happens when you try to boot the computer -- for instance, does it not boot at all, does it boot into Windows, etc.? One more command's output should also be helpful:\nsudo efibootmgr -v\n\nPlease post that along with the preceding command's output. With knowledge of the boot loaders on the ESP and what happens when you try to boot, it should be possible to offer repair suggestions.\n\nA: The rEFIND boot manager let me boot again, see http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/, try it on a bootable medium. It showed that Ubuntu 13.04 works fine when it is found by the boot manager. It may also provide clues to what went wrong and provide a long-term solution.\nBackground: an attempt to install Ubuntu 13.04 on a working installation with 12.04 and windows 7 on separate hard disks went wrong. 1) Windows 7 ignored my EFI partition and made a partition in unallocated space at the very end of the disk (without informing me properly). 2) Grub2 is not perfect: it has a bug, and see http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/. 3) Boot-Repair is a program that may help these unbootable installations. It is not perfect and installed several copies of the files needed for booting. 4) Your UEFI/BIOS may not be perfect. 5) I am not perfect, I am just an end-user even though I am not completely clueless. \nMy thanks go to those who took an interest in my question. \nI hope I did not transgress the rules with this answer.

You can do this by booting into 'recovery mode' from grub, and using the keyboard to select the root prompt option.\n\n*Run dpkg --configure -a.\n\n*If this was indeed your problem, it will resume some package installation that was not completed. For me, that was a kernel upgrade with an nvidia driver component.\n\n*Be patient. After it is completed, try reboot and see if it has fixed your problem.\n\n\nA: I had similar problem and solved it by following steps:\nfirst press Ctrl+Alt+F1(or F2, F3, F4)\nYou'll see a terminal for login, enter your credentials and execute the following command:\nps -aux | grep --color \"lightdm\"\nthen, you will see processes that run lightdm, so you should kill those process:\nkill -9 -15 <process number>\nafter that graphical login screen appears.\n\nA: In Ubuntu 18.04 and later lightdm login display manager has been replaced by gdm3 and the keyboard shortcut to access the virtual console has changed from Ctrl+Alt+F1 to Ctrl+Alt+F3. sudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm has been replaced by sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm3. sudo service lightdm restart has been replaced by sudo service gdm3 restart.\nIf you know your disk is full, you can try removing around 1-2 GB of unneeded files before executing sudo service gdm3 restart.\nIf the problem remains after reboot fix it by opening /etc/gdm3/custom.conf for editing in nano text editor with sudo nano /etc/gdm3/custom.conf and unmcommenting #WaylandEnable=false by removing the# character at the beginning of the line as follows: WaylandEnable=false\n\nA: Apparently this is an issue that can happen, especially with SSD drives.\nThe solution would be to install gdm and use that instead.\nsudo apt-get install gdm\n\nand when prompted, select it.\nIf you want to switych back to lightdm:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm\n\nThis is the source.\n\nA: Try the following:\npress Ctrl+Alt+F1\nYou'll see a terminal for login, enter your credentials and execute the following command:\nsudo service lightdm --full-restart\nEnter your password again and you should see the login page\n\nA: Here’s what worked for me, on a Dell Precision M6800 laptop running Ubuntu 16.10:\nFirst, at the black screen with the cursor in the top-left (which wasn’t blinking in my case), I followed this answer and pressed Ctrl+Alt+F1 to show a terminal, and logged in with my username and password. \nThat answer suggests running sudo service lightdm --full-restart, but the command only gave me an error. Instead, this answer’s solution of removing and reinstalling lightdm was what brought me forward. Note that a wired internet connection is required for the apt-get install part; wireless internet is apparently not set up yet at this stage in the boot process.\nsudo apt-get purge lightdm\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install lightdm\ndpkg-reconfigure lightdm\nsudo reboot\n\nAfter this reboot, the login screen successfully showed, at the point in time where previously the one-line log message disappeared and the underline cursor appeared. But when I entered my correct password to log in, I only got the error “Failed to start session” in red text.\nThe article ‘Fix “Failed To Start Session” At Login In Ubuntu 14.04’ helped with that. At the login screen with the error message, I pressed Ctrl+Alt+F1 again to show a terminal, and logged in. Then I ran sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop, which installed ubuntu-desktop for the first time. Finally, I ran sudo reboot to reboot.\nWhen the computer finished rebooting, I was able to successfully log in at the login screen and return to using the computer normally.\n\nA: Have you tried the options listed at this My computer boots to a black screen, what options do I have to fix it?\nAlso, do you have a discrete graphics card, possibly with Optimus technology? If yes, please install bumbleebee project from Bumblebee wiki.\n\nA: On Ubuntu 20 , I tried all other solutions , none worked instantly , I booted to recovery mode started networking, and opted for \"dpkg\" to reconfigure /fix packages , with all my trials I ended up getting this error \"dpkg error processing package nvidia-340 ... returned exit status 10\" , so the problem was , without my notice or during apt update , nvidia-340 package was installed .. my pc does not have integrated graphics but an old discrete Nvidia graphics card , after researching on nvidia-340 package , I found that I can remove it sudo apt-get purge --autoremove nvidia-340 , I  , then I restarted gdp3 service sudo service gdm3--full-restart then I could reboot successfully to the login screen\n", "Q: Unable to extend ubuntu partiton I'm trying to expand my Ubuntu partition, I booted up my LiveCD, opened GParted and freed some space.

I am wanting to find the Unity scope folder so that I can study how the scopes are set up and programmed. Where on the filesytem could I find the Unity scope files?\n\nA: Documentation on the Unity scope API can be found here.  That information should be current for 13.04, but there are some changes coming in 13.10 which merge the concepts of lenses and scopes.\nUnity discovers its lenses and scopes by looking for files under /usr/share/unity/lenses (or /usr/share/unity/scopes for 13.10) with a suffix of .lens or .scope.\nThese files are similar to desktop entry files, but instead of specifying a command to execute, they specify a D-Bus endpoint to use to talk to the lens or scope through the DBusName and DBusPath keys.\nIf the scope or lens is not running when the shell tries to communicate with it, the D-Bus daemon will activate it.  This is done by scanning /usr/share/dbus-1/services for a .service file whose Name key matches the desired bus name, and running the command in the Exec key.  So it is not too difficult to discover what program implements a particular scope with a simple grep command.\nIf you are interested in writing a scope of your own, I would suggest looking at the documentation in the first link.  But keep in mind that you may have to adjust your scope a bit when 13.10 comes out.\n", "Q: Black screen after login with cursor I have Ubuntu 13.04 and one day ago I've just installed updates, after I turned off my computer and then when I restarted I just can see a black screen with cursor after login.\nNote: I can login.\nI've tried to start with unity 2d but it doesn't come with this Ubuntu version, I've installed but it wasn't added to desktop managers options.

Secure Boot is a feature that's designed to prevent certain types of malware from running before an OS has booted.\nThe key point is that the message you see is not an error message, nor is it diagnostic of anything going wrong. Your problem is occuring after that purely informational message has appeared on your screen. Chances are GRUB is flaking out on your computer, since the program that generates the message (shim) launches GRUB immediately afterwards. Given that you've installed Windows 7 on the computer, though, it's not entirely clear that you should even be installing Ubuntu in EFI mode (which is how you're booting it now, given the Secure Boot message). Thus, I recommend you begin by booting a Linux emergency disc (something like Parted Magic), running Boot Info Script, and posting a link to the RESULTS.txt file that it generates. That will tell us about your current configuration, which will help us offer a solution that doesn't involve assumptions and guesswork.\n\nEdit/New Information: Your Boot Info Script output indicates that your Windows installation is clearly in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode. Thus, you should not attempt to install Linux in EFI mode. I'm not sure why the installer is hanging when you try to boot it in that mode, but with any luck the problem will clear up when you attempt a BIOS-mode boot.\nYou may be able to do this by using your firmware's boot manager, which you typically access by hitting a function key as you power the computer on. (Which function key, unfortunately, is completely non-standardized. Check your documentation or look for an on-screen prompt, which will probably stay visible for only a second or two.) If you can find this menu, with any luck you'll see two entries for your optical drive, one of which will include the string \"EFI\" or \"UEFI\" and the other of which will not. Select the non-EFI entry to boot the Ubuntu installer in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode.\nIf you can't find a boot manager menu or if you can't get it to boot the disc in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode, try downloading the Mac version of the Ubuntu installer. Ironically, that version lacks EFI support, and so may work better for your needs.\n\nA: I have an Asus q400a. Hold down F2 and you can get into the BIOS settings.

Or better said: you elevate your admin user to admin priviliges permanently until you exit. Example:\nrinzwind@discworld:~$ sudo su\n[sudo] password for rinzwind: \nroot@discworld:/home/rinzwind# \n\nAnd no Ubuntu technically does not have an active root user. From the Ubuntu RootSudo wiki page:\n\nIn Linux (and Unix in general), there is a SuperUser named Root. The Windows equivalent of Root is Administrators group. The SuperUser can do anything and everything, and thus doing daily work as the SuperUser can be dangerous. You could type a command incorrectly and destroy the system. Ideally, you run as a user that has only the privileges needed for the task at hand. In some cases, this is necessarily Root, but most of the time it is a regular user.\nBy default, the Root account password is locked in Ubuntu. This means that you cannot login as Root directly or use the su command to become the Root user. However, since the Root account physically exists it is still possible to run programs with root-level privileges. This is where sudo comes in - it allows authorized users (normally \"Administrative\" users; for further information please refer to AddUsersHowto) to run certain programs as Root without having to know the root password.\nThis means that in the terminal you should use sudo for commands that require root privileges; simply prepend sudo to all the commands you would normally run as Root. For more extensive usage examples, please see below. Similarly, when you run GUI programs that require root privileges (e.g. the network configuration applet), use graphical sudo and you will also be prompted for a password (more below). Just remember, when sudo asks for a password, it needs YOUR USER password, and not the Root account password.\n\n", "Q: How to set Desktop to show files and folders from different directory?

To repair this, you will need to undo that edit to your ~/.profile somehow. The easiest way is probably to hold shift during a reboot, select Recovery Mode from the menu, drop to a root shell prompt, then edit the file and reboot again.\nAs for why the original command failed, I would guess that your system doesn't have git installed (the github page says \"(requires Git)\").

How would i go about that? would i need a separate device to press the power button, or would it be as simple as installing a card to the machine?\n\nA: Try Remotewakeup.  It allows you to start your computer over the internet.\n\nFor complete instructions visit their site\nIf the system is switched off, make sure power is still getting to the network card.  Make sure that the LAN connector light is on.\n\nA: It's possible that this question is relevant :\nHow can I enable wake-on-lan permanently?\nI'd add that I'm not aware of any way to remotely shutdown the computer, short of SSH'ing to the device and issuing a halt or shutdown now command.\nAn added idea may be to research APC managed power bars. These network-based devices provide various power ports, each of which can be turned on/off by visiting the device's web page. The PC would have to set to power on when power is restored though and not all PC's support that setting in their BIOS.\n\nA: If I understood correctly you are looking for \"Wake on LAN\", which is supported by DELL Optiplex systems (at least in principle).\n\n\n*\n\n*Enable \"Wake on LAN\" in the BIOS of the target.\n\n*Disable \"Deep Sleep\" in the BIOS of the target.\n\n*On your \"other\" Computer (assuming it is in the same LAN) install wakeonlan . This tool can send \"magic packets\" to the target.\n\n*Now create a file (lets call it optiplex.wol) in your home directory with just MAC address of the Optiplex (like 54:04:a6:a0:90:a1) as content.\n\n*Type wakeonlan -f optiplex.wol - the machine should start within seconds\n\n", "Q: make terminal show up when called in a shell script I am writing a shell script that will execute some application for a specific mime type, and it does it correctly, but when I have echo in my shell script, I dont see any terminal with the echoes message, is there any way to make the terminal show ?\n\nA: If you're planning for this script to always execute in a windowed environment, and these messages are only used for rare errors, consider using xmessage or gmessage instead of echo. This will bring up a new window with the message, which the user can click to dismiss.\nOn the other hand, if the messages are common or frequent, you might want to always run your entire script inside a new terminal window for that mime type. Instead of configuring it to run your script, try running this:\ngnome-terminal -e \"path to your script\"\n\nI assume you also need to pass the name of the file to open to the script, but I'm not sure how that parameter is encoded in the context where you're doing this. It might be as simple as putting something like $* or %s at the right spot inside the quotes.\n", "Q: what is .profile~ (not .profile) I was trying to uninstall NVM, and saw I have a .profile~ file as well .profile -  both have different content. \nwhat is the different between them? thanks.\n\nA: It's a backup copy created by a text editor.

I've tried re-installing using the Windows installer but I get the same error/problem. I've used Ubuntu on my previous laptop using the installer with no problem. \nAny ideas greatly appreciated, bearing in mind that I'm not technical.\nDavid Thomas\n\nA: Assuming you're talking about Wubi (the Windows installer), it is probably a good idea to not use that type of installer on your machine. With the information you've provided, it sounds like the graphics card could be the issue, and the Lenovo T430u has integrated Intel HD Graphics 4000 in it, which I know to be supported by Ubuntu. With that being said, there are two things you can do (neither of which require being that tech savvy). Install Ubuntu from a DVD, or install Ubuntu from a USB drive. First and foremost, download the Ubuntu ISO file onto Windows 7 and follow Ubuntu.com's user-friendly instructions for either USB or DVD installation. I would love to help you more, but with the information you've provided, direct-media installation of Ubuntu just might be the ticket.\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: connect to internet through 3g dongle in ubuntu server As the title says, can i connect to internet through 3g dongle in ubuntu server fresh installation Any terminal / manual way?

I assume you are installing Ubuntu server to actually run a server that can be accessed from the web.  Since most if not all mobile broadband providers run carrier-grade NAT, you will not have a publicly routable address under your control and thus no one  will be able to access your server. \n\nA: http://www.draisberghof.de/usb_modeswitch/bb/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=1114\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new file named \"12d1:1526\" in the folder \"/etc/usb_modeswitch.d\" and fill it with this content:\n# Vodafone K3772 (Huawei)\n\nTargetVendor=  0x19d2\n#TargetProduct= not known yet\n\nMessageContent=\"55534243123456780000000000000011062000000100000000000000000000\"\n\n\n*Duplicate one of the existing Huawei lines in \"/lib/udev/rules.d/40-usb_modeswitch.rules\" and edit the new line to reflect the product ID of your device (... ATTRS{idProduct}==\"1526\" ...). It's easy, just look at the other lines.\n\n*Now, plug your modem in and wait at least 10 seconds. After this run the lsusb command in a terminal program. There should be a device ID starting with \"12d1\" but most likely different than \"12d1:1526\". The changed part of the ID (after the colon) is your new \"TargetProduct\" value (prepended by \"0x\").\nEdit your config file accordingly, removing the comment sign (hash) at the start of the TargetProduct line.\n\n*Unplug the modem and plug again.

Some of it previews as really large bold print.

Make sure you can reach all of the repository, e.g. by using the web browser to make sure that the site is not currently down.\nIf it's OK, then check your system-wide proxy settings. Because software update is run by using root privilege, so the proxy settings used would be the root's too. Check this question to set system-wide proxy settings.\nAnother cause might be firewall, but I'm not sure :).\nHope it helps.\nUPDATE\nIt is not a problem if you get message gpg: /tmp/tmp<somerandom>/trustdb.gpg: trustdb created when running software-properties-gtk from the terminal.\n\nA: In my case the error messages about not being about to get repository information, checking internet connectivity and not being able to find a \"Best Server\" were complete red herrings. \nThe root cause of my problem was that I was trying to upgrade from 13.10 to 14.04 and my update settings were set to only check for LTS updates. Whenever I tried explicitly checking for an update, it said \"your system is already up-to-date\". I wrongly guessed at first that this was due to a network issue (proxy etc) leading to no updates being found.\nWhen I changed the updater settings to check for ANY new version, I got a message saying 13.10 is no longer supported, with a new button for the upgrade option. Clicking this new button worked fine, with no other network or settings changes.\nThis looks like a bug to me, since 14.04 is an LTS update, but anyway, it worked!\n\nA: In my case, the error messages start showing after upgrade to ubuntu 20.04.\nWhen I changed network proxy settings from Automatic to Disabled error disappeared.\nHere is how:\n\n*\n\n*Open the Network tab and select proxy settings.\n\n*Change form Automatic to Disabled.\n\n\nA: Run sudo apt update in terminal and check what error it says run software-properties-gtk and  go to other software and uncheck all the  error causing ones and then run sudo apt update it will work\n\nA: Try sudo ldconfig /usr/bin/gpg.

Or what could I do to check that my Grub doesn't have any issues?\n\nA: I found out what the problem was, apparently it has something to do with having Legacy Grub rather than Grub 2.

I need a new HDD and plan on getting a 3TB one to fit all my stuff, ubuntu 12.04 install included.\nSo far I only have a 5yr old Asus p5qse but sooner rather than later I should have a new system with a new MB so I imagine UEFI as well.\nMy questions are :\nWill the full 3TB be usable on my old MB?\nAnd on a new MB?\nAm I right to ask these questions, is it a BIOS problem? Or are these matters only relative to windows OSs and I should be fine no matter what?\n\nA: Theoretically, you can format your 3TB disk to work with your old motherboard with BIOS via partitioning it with a GPT partition table rather than MSDOS. However, it's not totally foolproof. Some BIOSes attempt to validate partition tables when they should not and that can cause problems because of the \"protective MBR\" that a GPT-partitioned disk uses.\nDo note that not all Linux disk tools work with GPT-partitioned disks. You would need to use gdisk rather than fdisk for example. The graphical Gparted and command line parted should have no problems with this.\nSo, really, there's no definite answer to this. However, all UEFI motherboards should be exempt from this problem.\nIf you're going to be dual-booting, you need to be sure that your new Windows OS has support for GPT partition tables (see EDIT 1). Windows will only install to a GPT if a) the OS supports booting from GPT (see below table), and b) you are using a UEFI firmware, so dual-booting using a pure GPT disk not supported -- of course you could always make a hybrid MBR.\nEDIT 1: GPT features of Windows versions are kind of mixed.\nWindows 95/98/2000/NT 4: Lol!

For Windows, I have Abbyy fine reader. But I don't want to go back to Windows. Please tell me if there is any application that can do the same for me. Please help me in this.\n\nA: You can use Abbyy OCR.  \n\nABBYY FineReader Engine CLI for Linux is a ready to use CLI tool based\n  on ABBYY’s advanced Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technologies. \n  The tool automates OCR and document conversion on Linux systems.\n\nFor more information, and to download it, visit their website.\nSource:Ocr4Linux\n\nA: First of all, here are some more OCR tools besides Abbyy which have an SDK and you can use on Linux. But note that not all of them support MS Word output:\n\n\n*\n\n*Tesseract - text output only\n\n*Ocrad - text output only\n\n*GOCR - text output only\n\n*CuneiForm - RTF output\n\n*OmniPage - Google Docs and PDF output\n\n\nHere is an article (from 2007, but probably still relevant) benchmarking the first three engines on accuracy and speed: http://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/ocr-test/\nBy the way, all the engines including Abbyy are best for unstructured text - in other words, images which don't follow a regular structure. If the \"images\" you are processing have a standard layout, e.g. forms filled out by customers (where the fields are always in the same place), various cards (such as business cards, ID cards), etc., there are specialized solutions that can detect and OCR only the specific text fields, \"clean\" out image \"noise\", and output the text in a structured manner (e.g. Name = John Smith, ID Number = 123456).\nIf your images ARE \"templates\", and you need an OCR that can output structured text, there are actually very few Linux solutions (as far as I know). Here are two solutions I'm familiar with:\n\n\n*\n\n*CSSN OCR (http://www.card-reader.com). Specializes in card-type documents like ID cards, driver's licenses, medical cards, bank checks, credit cards, etc. Runs on Linux using WINE.\n\n*ARH (http://www.arhungary.hu).

I am planning to buy gaming keyboards with back-lit illumination, specifically the Saitek K140.\nHowever, I'm confused whether the black-lit illumination, or the multimedia shortcut keys work with Ubuntu (13.04, specifically) .\nSo, the question is... Do black-lit gaming keyboards work with Ubuntu? \nIf you would be so kind to review the Saitek K140 slimline keyboard specifically that would be much appreciated.\nThanks\n\nA: The manual you linked indicates that the back lighting control is hardware based and controllable on the keyboard itself.

It looks like this:\nauto dsl-provider\niface dsl-provider inet ppp\npre-up /sbin/ifconfig eth0 up\nprovider dsl-provider\n\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet manual\n\nI thought maybe the problem was that dnsmasq wasn't assigning nameservers, so I added dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 8.8.8.4 under both interfaces in /etc/network/interfaces. That didn't help, so I tried adding the nameservers to /etc/resolv.conf. No help there. Finally, I tried adding them to /etc/dnsmasq.conf:\nno-resolv\nserver=8.8.8.8\nserver=8.8.4.4\n\nThis didn't help either. I'm not sure however if my problem really has anything to do with nameservers or if this is just another case of outdated, worthless documentation.\nI was able to get this working with Network Manager at one point, but I didn't like how Network Manager didn't let me assign a DHCP range.

In the past I was able to get my webcam working with Skype using the fix described here: \nSkype video not working after upgrade from 11.10 to 12.04\nIt meant starting skype with:\nLD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libv4l/v4l1compat.so /usr/bin/skype \nThis worked well on Ubuntu 12.04, but doesn't work anymore on Ubuntu 13.04. Probably because the executable file in /usr/bin/skype is replaced by a script that says:\n#!/bin/sh\n#\n# Tip in https://launchpad.net/bugs/1002187, comment #31\n#\n# Bug filed against Skype: https://jira.skype.com/browse/SCL-980\n#\nexport LD_PRELOAD=\"/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/mesa/libGL.so.1${LD_PRELOAD:+:}$LD_PRELOAD\"\nexec /usr/lib/skype/skype \"$@\"\n\nIt seems that this script is needed to work around a bug to start Skype on Ubuntu 13.04 but it is probably also overriding my own webcam fix and I guess that's the reason it is not working anymore. \nSo I need to add my webcam fix to this script, but I have a hard time finding out how?

There is a new version of Skype, version 4.2 You can install it from the Skype website. They didn't fix the long standing issues that a lot of people have with their webcams, but it seems they did fix the segfaulting issue.

This should be enough to use Wubi because you can always store your personal data on the Windows /host. This is recommended anyway because:\n\n\n*\n\n*It's safer on the /host - not stored in a virtual drive that is a single file (root.disk) that is subject to corruption if Ubuntu freezes and you could lose everything on it.\n\n*You have plenty of room on /host\n\n*Most of the type of data that takes space e.g. photos, music, video, you'd want available to Windows and it's not easily available if it's stuck on the root.disk (without a tool like ext2read)\n\n\nThe only reason you might need more space is if you're compiling kernels or other software.\nYou could also consider what your needs are. If you want a robust long term Ubuntu install, Wubi probably isn't it.\nOther ways to make space:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove all but the last two kernels. You can use this script for that: clean_kernel.sh. Just download it with wget https://raw.github.com/bcbc/utilities/master/clean_kernel.sh and run bash clean_kernel.sh\n\n*Clean up unneeded packages: sudo apt-get autoremove && sudo apt-get autoclean\n\n*Look for other junk by running the disk usage analyzer (baobab). Go to settings before running and uncheck the /host or it will search the whole Windows partition. Look for large files in /home you can delete or move to host\nOf course you can resize the Wubi install, but - as mentioned - a normal dual boot is better for long term. \n\nA: IMO if you are wanting to keep Ubuntu you are best off doing a standard installation.\nIt is possible te resize the wubi disk, but is is a little more time consuming and difficult.\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/WubiGuide#How_do_I_resize_the_virtual_disks.3F\n", "Q: Source code for the tray on top right corner.

Yes an update replaces files and the file can become full.\nSee https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WubiGuide\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/WubiGuide#How_do_I_migrate_to_a_real_partition.2C_and.2BAC8-or_get_rid_of_Windows_entirely.3F\nBooting the iso with persistence is very different. The iso contains a ro file system (squasfs) which is mounted. When you use persistance a cow (copy on write) file is made. When you upgrade, the old files are NOT over written, they are copied to the cow file system and then updated. The cow files are overlaid on the ro files. So yes it takes up more space.\nIMO persistance is best for maintaining customizations and data in your home directory.

This isn't always required, but Secure Boot seems to cause a lot of problems with many Ubuntu installations, so IMHO it's best to disable it. This will not solve the specific problem you're reporting, though.\nSecond, do one of the following things:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Linux, install my rEFInd boot manager. There's a Debian package that you can install quite easily. The result is that when you reboot, you should see rEFInd rather than GRUB. rEFInd should enable you to boot Windows or Linux (and to boot Linux either directly or via GRUB).\n\n*In Linux, install and run the Ubuntu Boot Repair tool. This should fix your problem, but it will probably leave stray and non-functional boot entries.

The reason I ask is I am very new to Ubuntu, but I want to get into mobile development.

You will just need to set the permissions for all the files since NTFS doesn't support that.\nHowever, you should think about having a dual boot, if it is that you installed Ubuntu alongside Windows with Wubi. If you do have a dual boot, there is no real reason why Ubuntu should be slow, except if you have your Ubuntu partition full, or have allocated no swap partition.\n", "Q: Lubuntu won't install using wubi (pastebin of log file included) So I tried to install lubuntu 2 times now, and it seems that it won't install because at the very last of the install progress I get the error: Could not retrieve the required installation files\nfor more ingormation, please see the log file (http://pastebin.com/kjJBfFe8)\nI tried a live USB and it just doesn't boot up.\nAnyone know what the problem could be?\nI'm on a 64 bit i7 gtx560 system\nKind regards, Gilles\n\nA: That's a problem with Wubi 12.04 and Lubuntu. Ubuntu 12.04 is an LTS (long term support), but Lubuntu isn't LTS. So it hasn't been updated to 12.04.1 and 12.04.2. \nLong story short, wubi.exe is looking for a Lubuntu 12.04.2 and not finding it so it fails. This is a bug in Wubi, but you can workaround it by using the original 12.04 wubi.exe from here: http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/12.04/wubi-12.04.exe\nIt is better to install with the live USB, so you might want to look at this thread for help with this: my-computer-boots-to-a-black-screen-what-options-do-i-have-to-fix-it\n", "Q: Open file or folder location directly when searching for it - Nautilus I currently use nautilus as my default file manager. When I search for some file or folder, I also need to switch to the directory that contains the particular file or folder. It feels tedious to go to the properties then copy the path and open the same path. How can I save time, could there be some shortcut to switch to the directory that contains the file (or folder) being looked upon.\n\nA: I don't know about any inbuilt function that could achieve this, but you could use a simple Nautilus script:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nnautilus \"$(dirname \"$1\")\"\n\nIn fact, you could even direct Nautilus to the file right away and it would still open the parent directory:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nnautilus \"$1\"\n\nWith this script Nautilus will also highlight the file within the directory.\nSee here for more information on installing Nautilus scripts:\nHow can I install a Nautilus script?\nYou could then proceed to set up a shortcut for the script. I'd advise you skip step 2 and 4 of that answer as they don't appear to be necessary. If you named your script something like \"Open parent directory\" it should be easy to find it in the accels file and change the hotkey. The line should look something like this:\n(gtk_accel_path \"<Actions>/ScriptsGroup/script_file:\\\\s\\\\s\\\\shome\\\\sshivshnkr\\\\s.gnome2\\\\snautilus-scripts\\\\sOpen%20parent\" \"F4\")\n\nIn this case the shortcut would be F4.\n\nA: What method are you using to search? I tried \"Search for Files\" in Nautilus just now, and when I right click one of the search results, there's an \"Open Containing Folder\" option that launches the file's folder in Nautilus (with the file highlighted).

Can anyone tell me about their experiences with doing this sort of thing or provide a good answer to whether it's safe or not.\n\nA: TrueCrypt does not support full system drive encryption on Linux. If you want full drive encryption on Linux you'll want to use something like ecryptfs or dm-crypt. However, full drive encryption on Linux may be a bit too much; you really need to only encrypt the /home, /var and /opt directories.\nTrueCrypt system encryption: http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/?s=system-encryption\nThe Arch docs are the best docs for setting up ecryptfs and/or dm-crypt: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/ECryptfs\nPersonally, I recommend dm-crypt because you can configure linux to mount encrypted disks upon bootup or prompt for a password.\n\nA: I have Ubuntu 13.04 installed on an encrypted / filesystem using dm-crypt.

I finally succeeded by following these instructions.\nBasically, the configuration needs to be updated so that the initramfs at boot time knows that it needs to mount the encrypted volume (and logical volume).\n\nA: The Ubuntu alternate installer in 12.04 will do that for you as well as the newer installers in 12.10 and 13.04 during install of the OS.\n", "Q: ntpd vs ntpdate: pros and cons In order to keep the time accurate on a Ubuntu system one can either:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run the ntpd (network time protocol daemon) which will run all the time and continuously adjust the system time when clocks drift.  or alternatively:\n\n*Call ntpdate periodically (e.g. from cron)\n\n\nQuestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*What are the pros and cons of each of these two methods?\n\n*Which different scenarios call for picking one over the other?\n\n\nA: As far as I understand the Linux System Administrators Guides NTP chapter, \"continuous updates\" doesn't mean that ntpd constantly queries its servers (like once a second), but that the time corrections do not introduce discontinuities.\nInstead of just setting the correct time, ntpd will run your computers clock slightly slower or faster until it reaches the correct time (assuming the error is not too big). This avoids problems with software running havoc because of gaps in time or negative durations -- most programmers won't expect a process to finish before it started and thereby giving a negative duration...\nFurthermore, the manual states that ntpd also learns and compensates the drift of your computers clock (at least the constant part).\nThe Network Time Protocol Project has a nice FAQ (http://www.ntp.org/ntpfaq/) explaining NTP and how it keeps the time.\n\nA: ntpdate is deprecated as of September 2012; apparently ntpd now has the ability to do one-time updates if needed, and ntpdate is based on \"long-neglected\" ntpd code. (News to me, since my system has ntpdate but not ntpd! I'll be fixing that presently; thanks for asking this question.)\nAs for the difference between continuous versus periodic updates, I think the trade-offs there are what you would expect; continuous adjustments maintain better accuracy over time, which can be important for databases and MailDir (see same link). But of course this would require slightly more network traffic (presumably negligible for exchanging simple timestamps) as well as an always-online network connection, slight consumption of RAM and CPU, etc. But all these downsides are tiny in a modern computing environment; overall I doubt there are good reasons to substitute cron for ntpd.\n", "Q: Easiest way to stop using a separate partition for /boot? I have an older machine that I originally set up as a dual boot with Windows 7 and Lubuntu. Part of that setup was establishing a small partition for /boot. The partition is 89 MB, and with recent changes in the initrd it's too small to support upgrading even though I only have the most recent kernel version in there (the updater wants 41 MB of free space, but I have only 40 and it's as stripped down as I can get it).\nWhat I'd like to do is to just abandon the 89MB partition to the dustbin of bad ideas and move /boot into the root partition, where there is ample space. I don't want to mess with the partition layout on the disk, and I don't want to reinstall anything unless there is no other way.\nSo my question is, what is the easiest, least likely to cause downtime way to switch away from using a separate partition for /boot?\n\nA: I don't think a separate /boot is a bad idea, but I'll try to answer your question.\nOutline:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot up a live OS (like lubuntu) off of a DVD in the drive, or by using a bootable USB stick. \n\n*Mount both /boot and / (root)\n\n*make a directory in / called /boot\n\n*copy or rsync over all the files\n\n*using gParted, delete the original /boot partition\n\n\nI'll try to flesh the outline out with specific details, but instead you might want to try this general plan to just enlarge /boot to whatever size you need:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot up a live OS \n\n*Back up your installation\n\n*Using Gparted, enlarge your /boot directory to whatever size you need. I usually go to 512 MiB, as hard drive space is cheap. This might require shifting or shrinking (or both) another partition slightly. Usually, gParted is really good about doing this but I did warn you to back everything up. If you are shrinking the NTFS partition, you must have shutdown MS-Windows completely or gParted won't let you manipulate the size. \n\n\nMore details for the first version:\n\n\n*\n\n*After booting the live OS, open a terminal, figure out what partition is what. Here I'll assume sda1 is /boot and sda3 is / (root)\n\n*Mount /boot \nsudo mkdir /media/boot\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /media/boot\n\n*Mount (root)\nsudo mkdir /media/root\nsudo mount /dev/sda3 /media/root\n\n*create new boot area:\nsudo mkdir /media/root/boot\n\n*copy all files over\nrsync -av /media/boot /media/root/boot\n\n*Test. When you are where you want to be, boot into the live OS again and use gParted to remove sda1 (former boot partition)\n", "Q: go back from Gnome 3.8 to Gnome 3.6 in LUBUNTU 13.04 I had Lubuntu 12.04 and wanted to try Gnome Shell. When I added the Gnome3 PPA, that got me on 3.4. I wanted to use 3.6 though and follow new releases from there, but from what I gathered about this topic essentially it looked like I had to upgrade the distro to do so. Now I'm on Lubuntu 13.04, and, with the Gnome3 ppa enabled, I guess the next apt-get update automatically took me to 3.8.\nNow 3.8 at least isn't officially beta anymore, but still too unrounded and crashes way too often for my taste, so I'd like to give it a few more months and stay with 3.6 in the meantime, is that possible?\nthanks, Ben\n\nA: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2143894\nsudo ppa-purge ppa:gnome3-team/gnome\n\nThat will remove the Gnome ppa entirely if you need it to. If not, my suggestion (if you were lucky/smart enough to partition home separately from root) is to just install Ubuntu Gnome 13.04 if you're willing to go full bore into Gnome.\nI've been using it and aside from an issue with the workspace switching, it has been buttery smooth. I'm actually impressed as last time I used it it was twitchy, would lock up on lock screen, and had a few crashes of the shell.\nAnd after the fact, if you want you can always add the Gnome PPA again and go for 3.8.\nEdit- Try this- http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2013/04/gnome-3-8-ppa-for-ubuntu-gnome\nBasically, purge the Gnome PPA, update your repo list, remove the Gnome shell entirely (should leave you with just Lubuntu interface) and then go back and reinstall Gnome shell.

I don't want to mess it up, there are important files and I don't want to just go and try things I find on google.\n\nA: To change the password of a given user, just use the passwd command.

Unfortunately, my active partition is not on my Windows XP partition.

During the boot, in bios, you may press some key and select the HDD / CDROM / USB to boot from. The active partition on that drive will be used. That's it.\nNote:\nI have a PC with 2 HDDs, too. BUT I have installed all the operating systems on the first one. And the second drive is for my data only. In my case I do need grub. I install it on some root partition and flash it on MBR.

Is this true? \nAlso it seems that there is NO Ubuntu 13.04 server (32-bit) codes available for download. Is this true? As such, is there, by any chance, that I could install and run Open Stack on Ubuntu (32-bit) desktop, if it has not already been bundled in?\nPlease provide me with instructions or pointers to instructions, whih explain how I could run Open Stack on top of Ubuntu 13.04 (32-bit) desktop.\nThanks,\n\nA: The Ubuntu desktop and server editions are not separate operating systems.  Instead, they are just, for your convenience, separate installers, which each install a different subset of Ubuntu's software packages.\nIt is possible to install all Ubuntu server software on an installation that was originally installed with the desktop installer, and vice versa, using the package installation tools built into Ubuntu.\nOpenStack is not one software package but a range of software and isn't the easiest to get started with.  Normally, you'd probably be running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS if you are running a server and installation will be via the CloudArchive.

I am trying to install Ubuntu 13.04.  I currently have a 2TB drive in my computer where Windows 7 boots from, and a secondary 500GB drive that also has a bootable installation of Windows 7, because the version on the 2TB is a clone of what was on the 500.. I do not need any information on the 500 as I already have it moved over to the 2TB.  What I want is to completely reformat the 500 so that it has about 300GB for NTFS and the rest for Ubuntu.  However, I can't seem to find a straightfoward way to do that in the Ubuntu installer.  If I click on \"Install Ubuntu alongside them,\" it does not give me the option to select my 500GB drive, only my 2TB.  I do NOT want any linux partitions on my 2TB drive.  I do not want to click, \"Erase disc and install Ubuntu\" for obvious reasons.  Finally, clicking \"something else\" brings up a menu that is quite confusing.  I can kind of figure out how to use it, but it's not as straightfoward as I'd like..  Further, I know that Ubuntu requires a SWAP partition, but I do not know how much, or even how, to allocate that with the stupid dropdown menus it gives me.\nSo, to get to the point..  What is the easiest, safest way to do what I want to do?  That is, allocate approximately 200G for Ubuntu on my 500G drive, and be able to choose between Windows 7 on my 2TB drive and Ubuntu at startup - all, of coarse, without touching the 2TB drive at all.\nThanks!\n\nA: You're right.  Choosing Something else will allow you to accomplish your task.  Now you mentioned that you want to create a partition of 200GB for Ubuntu.  So you would create a partition of 200GB, and choose a mount point of / and create a swap file, twice the amount of RAM. \nThe images below are for illustration purposes, your actual case might be different.\nClick on the + sign to create a partition.  \n\nChoose the size, but leave room for swap.  In this example I left a 14GB room for swap.\n\nCreate swap\n\nFinal outcome.  Make sure that you choose your first drive for boot loadrs installation.

I clicked on the ISO image (also in Windows 8 UEFI secure boot mode) \"burn to CD ROM\" as described f.ex. here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BurningIsoHowto\nIt does not work with Uefi secure boot. The error message is:\n\nCDRom has been blocked by the current security policy [OK]\n\nas Canonical had not a Uefi licence for *buntu. When I start with Uefi, but secure boot disabled, there is even not Error message. In Legacy mode, the CD ROM works fine.\nAs I have to start in Uefi secure boot mode to install *buntu 13.04 alongside Windows 8 in Uefi secure boot mode: How to burn a bootable live CD in Uefi secure boot mode? Either with Win 8 or Win XP or Mac OS 10.4.11 or a Live CD in legacy mode?\n\nA: In theory, Ubuntu 12.04.2 (but not 12.04), 12.10, and 13.04 all support Secure Boot via a program called shim, and their installers should boot with Secure Boot active. In practice, there seem to be a lot of problems with that. I'm not sure if this is because of configuration errors, because of the fact that Ubuntu is still using the old shim version 0.1, or because of bugs in some computers' Secure Boot implementations. If you're running into such problems, I have three suggestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can disable Secure Boot on the computer in question. This is usually the easiest approach to take. Note that this will not prevent you from booting Windows. The drawback is that you'll lose the security benefits that Secure Boot provides -- but this is no worse than running Windows on a BIOS-based computer.\n\n*You can use the more up-to-date shim version 0.2 with Ubuntu. This is most easily done by disabling Secure Boot, installing Ubuntu, installing the updated shim, and then re-enabling Secure Boot. Note that once you re-activate Secure Boot, you'll need to manually register Canonical's/Ubuntu's public key in your Machine Owner Key (MOK) list. This key is available in the Ubuntu shim package, IIRC; or you can get it in my rEFInd .zip file. You register the key when you reboot; when shim launches and sees an unknown signature on the GRUB binary, shim launches a program called MokManager, which has a user interface akin to that of an Apple II. You use MokManager to navigate to the public key file you want to enroll in the MOK.\n\n*You can try the Linux Foundation's PreBootloader instead of shim. You'll need to install it (and its associated HashTool.efi file) in much the same way you'd install shim. Instead of enrolling a public key, though, you must register your boot loader, and possibly your kernels, with the PreBootloader. Overall, this is likely to be harder to use in the long run; but if it works and shim doesn't, it may be your only choice.\n\n\nNote that with either shim 0.2 or PreBootloader, if you choose to put the new program on your installation medium, that will affect only the boot of the installer; when the installer sets up Ubuntu, it will install Ubuntu's old shim 0.1. If the source of your problem is shim 0.1, this means that you'll need to disable Secure Boot and install shim 0.2 or PreBootloader on your hard disk. Thus, there's little point to modifying the installation medium; it's simpler to temporarily disable Secure Boot when installing Ubuntu.\nUnfortunately, the details of getting either shim or PreBootloader working are a bit tedious. I suggest you consult my general page on Secure Boot and/or my page on using Secure Boot with rEFInd for more details on how to install and use these programs.\n", "Q: Is it safe to rollback Wubi without fresh Wubi install? I've installed Ubuntu 12.10, then I made a backup from root.disk file. I decided to change from Ubuntu to Xubuntu. So I downloaded Xubuntu 12.10 ISO image and reinstalled Wubi.\nIn case I'm want to rollback to Ubuntu, is it safe to copy root.disk to C:\\ubuntu\\disks without reinstalling Wubi first to Ubuntu?\n\nA: Yes, it's safe as long as they're the same release (which they are in this case) and you installed to the same partition (C:). \nWhen you boot your computer it will still offer a choice between Windows and Xubuntu but it will boot whatever is on the root.disk. If you wanted to change the boot entry back to Ubuntu you'd have to use bcdedit or easyBCD (for Windows 8/7/Vista) or edit the boot.ini (Windows XP).\nWubi boots via grub4dos (wubildr.mbr) and a version of grub2 in wubildr. What they do is locate the first /ubuntu/disks/root.disk it finds on any partition, and then load the Grub menu (grub.cfg) from within that root.disk. So it doesn't matter what is on that root.disk (or even what partition, provided in the grub.cfg it has the correct partition UUID). So if you installed on C: it has to be on C: or you have to manually edit the Grub menu entry before booting.\nThe only issue is that the modules built into wubildr must be compatible with the grub.cfg so changing releases can lead to incompatibilities. In these cases you can sometimes manually boot from a grub prompt, but it's best to stick to the same one to avoid issues.\n", "Q: Transfering of files from Windows hangs randomly I have a 40 GB folder to transfer (some backup files from Windoze machine), but it stops randomly.

I have used Ubuntu 13.04 for some time now and I love it!\nCurrently I have 2 disks in my PC:\n2011 HDD with 1TB of space with Win7 on it.\n2006 HDD with 150GB of space with Ubuntu 13.04 on it.\nAs the 2006 drive is old(and could fail any day now) I would like to have Win7 on the 160GB disk and Ubuntu on the 1TB one.\nHow would that be possible?\n\nA: As windows cannot read ext4 file system you need to have a utility called as ext2explore in windows to copy contents from linux to windows. From windows to linux is straightforward as linux knows how to read ntfs file system.\nlink for ext2explore:\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/ext2read/files/Ext2Read%20ver%202.0/ext2explore%202.0%20beta/\n\nA: This is dangerous, so you should make a backup and be ready to reinstall the OS'.\nYou can move/copy partitions with gparted. (it technically creates a new partition) However, in order to change the partition of the device where Ubuntu is installed, you need either another device where Ubuntu (or any Unix where gparted is available) is installed or a live medium. However, deleting and copying (swapping) the partitions comprising the whole resp. devices, would probably fail. For this, you either need a third device or you could maybe first try to reduce the size of the partitions so either device could hold both at the same time.\nAlternatively, you could make dd images. (First shrink the 1 TB partition with gparted to 150 GB) Assuming /dev/sdb1 (1 TB) and /dev/sdc1 (150 GB) should be replaced (creating image files WIN-2013.dd (now on 1 TB device) and UBU-2013.dd (now 150 GB)):\n$ umount /dev/sdb1\n$ umount /dev/sdc1\n$ dd if=/dev/sdb1 of=WIN-2013.dd\n$ dd if=/dev/sdc1 of=UBU-2013.dd\n\nThen create and format new empty partitions in the desired order using gparted (or any other partition manager you like) and (to interchange sdb1 and sdc1)\n$ umount /dev/sdb1\n$ umount /dev/sdc1\n$ dd if=UBU-2013.dd of=/dev/sdb1\n$ dd if=WIN-2013.dd of=/dev/sdc1\n\nEither ways, you'll probably need to update-grub. First mount the ubuntu partition while you're still in the live or third linux installation and\n$ cd /media/THE_ROOT_OF_THAT_NEW_UBUNTU\n$ sudo mount -o bind /dev ./dev\n$ sudo mount -o bind /sys ./sys\n$ sudo mount -t proc /proc ./proc\n$ chroot .\n\nthen your name@machine should have changed, so go:\n$ update-grub\n\n(However, I don't know what to do with Windows if not installing a dummy linux just for grub boot!)\n\nA: If I understand your question correctly, you want to swap the contents of your hard drives. To do so, you will need to boot to a liveCD/USB system. Any system with GParted will do. Make sure that you have backups of any important files of BOTH disks. \nBefore starting it might be a good idea to read through all the steps to get a general idea of what you need to do.\nBoot the live distribution, run GParted and follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shrink the size of the windows partition to a size that can be accommodated by your old drive ( check the disk size and make it a couple of MB smaller just to be on the safe side)\n\n*Now move the partition you shrank in the previous step all the way to the right. Note1: Don't combine steps 1 and 2. It sounds counter-intuitive but its faster and safer to first re-size shrinking to the left and then move to the right rather than to shrink the partition \"towards\" the right side of the disk in one step.\n\n*Copy the linux partition(s) from your old disk to the new one. Technically speaking you don't have to copy the swap partition, just creating one of equal size on the new disk will suffice, BUT my advice is to just copy the damn thing from the old drive to the new one. This will preserve the partition UUID so you won't have to go in and make manual changes to your fstab later. Note2: If you have a separate partition for your /home folder (always a good idea) then copy it last, so it will be the rightmost linux partition. If you only have one linux partition that contains everything, then put the swap partition first and the linux partition second. This will come in handy later when resizing it.\n\n*Now is a good time for some testing. If you want you can disconnect or mark as hidden the old drive and the moved windows partition. Open a terminal and install GRUB on your new disk. Assuming your disk is /dev/sdb, you would need something like grub-install /dev/sdb If all is well your system will boot to linux. Now you can continue.\n\n*Shut-down, reconnect the drive if you have disconnected it, and reboot to the liveCD/USB. Run GParted again and delete all partitions from your old disk. \n\n*Copy the windows partition from your new disk to the old disk. Remember to un-hide it if it is hidden. Keep the \"old\" windows partition in the new drive hidden for the time being.\n\n*Time to test again. Run again the grub-install script so it can detect the windows installation. Reboot and try both windows and Ubuntu. If all is well, continue to next step.\n\n*You are almost done. Now you can delete the \"old\" windows partition from the new disk and re-size your linux partition to cover the remaining unallocated space of your new 1TB drive.\n", "Q: Time changes when rebooting kubuntu I have installed a dual boot system with windows 7 and kubuntu but every time i reboot my system; time changes in my kubuntu.

The problem: The application Stroget looks and behaves exactly like Minitube.  Flavio (the creator of Minitube) and I suspect that someone took his work and used it without Flavio's permission. The reason for our suspicion:\n\n\n*\n\n*Stroget looks and behaves exactly like Minitube 2.0\n\n*The only difference is the welcome text when you start the application. \"Welcome to Minitube\" has been replaced by \"Welcome to Stroget\".\n\n*This is how Minitube 2.0 looks like, this is how Stroget looks like.\n\n*Minitube and Stroget are available via the Ubuntu Software Center.\n\n*Please visit Minitube's forum for more information (I would post a link, but I am only allowed to post two).\n\n\nMy question therefore is: \n\n\n*\n\n*How can we contact Canonical about this, in order to analyze the situation?\n\n*Is Canonical the contact person - who is the official contact for an issue like this?\nThank you for your time and effort.\n\nA: First thing: This is up to the copyright holder to lodge any complaint. You can't do anything because it's (sincerely) none of your business.\nIf they feel there's a valid complaint, they can contact Canonical (see the bottom for a phone number). A DMCA notice is pointless because it's the wrong jurisdiction, but I'm sure they would listen to sense.\nI would imagine the owner should also be taking other civil action against the other project if they feel there has been an infringement.\n\nBut as others have said, this is how open source works. If something doesn't work for you, GPL encourages you to fork it and fix it. The basic rules are you just don't use the same name but all that really depends on the license. That appears to be what has happened here... But similarly, this is for the owner to interpret.\n\nHaving seen Flavio's post, I'd like to make a few more comments:\n\n\n*\n\n*Canonical should not be listing this as a proprietary download. You're right there.\n\n*Most non-opensourcerers might think blatent copying is evil but they've changed the name and they're working on your code just in their space. I can't see how people would get the two names confused either.\n\n*You can pull back fixes into your project from theirs. That's the beauty of GPL - even though they've added code, it needs to be the same license as the original.\n\n*However, there is a huge problem: Stroget has re-licensed your project as LGPL3. LGPL is more permissive than  GPL so it's not compatible. They're breaking your license to them.\n\n\nThe relicensing is the only thing you can think to action here (IMO, but remember: IANAL) but it is a significant issue. Talk to the project leaders or contact the FSF.\n\nA: I'd like to point out that I never talked about copyright infringement.\nOf course that guy broke every single rule in open source etiquette by not giving back his \"bug fixes\", pretending \"Stroget\" is a new project while it doesn't contain any changes and basically behaving like he was the original author. Still the GPL allows it.\nOne minor issue is that the Software Center displays the \"Proprietary\" label.\nI asked Canonical whether it is their policy to allow a renamed build of a package in their store. I asked if I could rebuild and rename Nautilus and get it accepted. I'm waiting for their decision.\n", "Q: simple Speech recognition under linux Anyone have a simple tutorial for running speech recognition under linux?

Recently it has stopped responding.\nIf I select the ibus keyboard icon from the menu, I get presented with the menu list of no input window and I can not quit, restart or click on preferences.\nI was able to temporarily get this working again by deleting my $HOME and setting it up from scratch but shortly after it stops responding once again.\nI configure it from settings → Install / Remove Languages and install Chinese Pinyin.  I also enable it from command line with im-switch -s ibus\nWould anyone have any experience with this problem or have suggestions for where I can look to troubleshoot.\n\nA: I was able to recreate this problem exactly when I ran im-switch from the command line. The ibus indicator appears on the menubar, but does not respond. \nI haven't tracked down the exact problem caused; but running im-switch after setting up ibus probably leaves the IM setup in an unstable state, running it by itself does not appear to handle all of the needed steps to setup the IM. \nThere's no need, however, to run im-switch manually since the language-selector handles all the necessary configuration and setup on the backend automatically. \nI fixed the problem by resetting the IM method to None so language-selector will reset the changes on the back end, logging out and in again, then going through all of the steps to set up ibus and pinyin input from scratch. (There may be a way to fix it through command line or editing the config files, but the GUI is quick and easy here.)\nFirst, as an aside, you don't need to enable Chinese language support to type Chinese through pinyin input. The language support is for menus, applications, and system use.\nFor pinyin input (or any input), you only need the packages required by the input method; here it's ibus-pinyin. This should be already installed with Precise 12.04.\nOpen Language Support from System Settings \nIf you don't need Chinese menus, etc, you can ignore Install/Remove Languages, but in Keyboard method input system, choose Ibus. \nChoosing the IM method from here automatically handles all of the backend setup for you. It's a good idea to log out and back in before doing anything else. \nIf ibus is already selected, you need to clear the configuration changes that came from running im-switch manually. Simply choose None and language-support will handle the needed backend reset. Log out and back in. Then choose ibus and log out and in again. \n\nSet Ibus Preferences and Input Methods\nAfter logging back in, the ibus indicator should work as intended now. (You can also start the preferences dialog from the command line with ibus-setup.)\nAs an aside, on the General  tab, it's a good idea to change Show language panel to When active or Always. There is a bug or conflict somewhere that keeps the default option of Embedded in Menu from working. The language panel provides additional functionality, such as choosing simplified or traditional characters, and has advanced options for the pinyin method.\n\nThen choose the Input Method tab. Choose Customize active input methods. Please note that installing Chinese (or any) language support does not automatically set up an input method. You still need to do this separately.\nUse the Select an input method button to access the sub-menus of Chinese and Pinyin. \n\nThe Select an input method text will change to Pinyin. Then click Add. \n\nYou should now see Pinyin in the list of installed input methods. Then click Close.\n\nIbus can sometimes be a little finicky when using the menus for the first time. You may need to click Preferences more than once after logging back in. (Possibly there's still some configuring going on in the background before it's ready.)\nAlso, once you have added the input method, you should see pinyin in the menu right away. But a few times with a new install I have had to force Ibus to see an input window first. If that happens, just open an editor like LibreOffice Writer or Gedit and click in the document window.\n", "Q: screen shots taken in ubuntu are not opening in windows 8 I have dual boot windows 8 and ubuntu 13.04.

After an upgrade to Ubuntu 13.04 recommended by the updater, I've got the grey screen back on the VNC clients. Gnome-classic is installed and the xstartup has not changed. What else did Ubuntu 13 upgrader do wrong?\n\nA: Since no-one gave me the apparently simple answer, I had to find out myself. \nGnome support in Ubuntu 13 has changed such that gnome-classic has to be called as gnome-session-fallback.

I then tested LinuxMint with Cinnamon which I found a delight compared to the standard Ubuntu Unity desktop, 'way over the top'.\nOnce a new LinuxMint environment (on vbox, excellent) with vnc4server is built, just ap-get install xfce4 - you will not be hindered with XFCE for your normal login but if you make your xstartup file like this (yes only these lines are necessary!):\n#!/bin/sh\nunset SESSION_MANAGER\nxsetroot -solid grey\nvncconfig -iconic &\nstartxfce4 &\n\n!there you have a good xfce destop in vnc. Only thing for me was that the terminal didnt work - it was there but no interaction in the window.

OK oh here are these gnome VNC grey screens again .. digging through Gnome forums (other vnc servers run happily Linux Mint) then I noted I need to set Vino params over SSH - got \"Cannot autolaunch D-Bus without X11 $DISPLAY\" (I don't have a desktop!), tried the DBUS shell script - that of course doesn't work, then found out (while vnc is already running and I have a 'Display') , I can issue:\nDISPLAY=:1 gsettings set org.gnome.Vino require-encryption false\n\nyes that executes without an error\n(display number is your vnc desktop number)\nbut still that grey screen in the vnc terminal...\nSo again, January 2015, the setting of variables through SSH so that a VNC client will efficiently work on GNOME is still a disaster and the advice stands firm to leave GNOME and install XFCE as above. Not as nice, but ... it works. And installs in a minute instead of spending days to find those (no doubt they will exist) few simple commands that will fix the gnome problem.\n", "Q: How to boot into Windows 8 from Grub?

How should I free up memory to install ubuntu?\n\nthere are two recovery partitions. One with 500mb and the other with 8.34 gb.

Depending on your laptop that may include all of the bloatware installed by the manufacture (some have their stuff on a separate partition). The 500MB partition is kind of like a small write buffer, it. During recovery operations and factory resets it provides a minimum swap area for certain operations. At least this is my understanding of the purpose of the 500 MB section. Whenever I dual boot a computer I always make a small fat32 partition between the two OS's to prevent the file system of one from inadvertently corrupting the other. It is possible that this small partition serves that purpose as well. I hope that helps.

My motherboard it's a Gigabyte Mini.\nI tried to found here someone that had the same problem but no results.\nAnyone can help? Thanks!\n\nA: So you partitioned the disk yourself, or did you just shrink the Windows partition? Best way is to just shrink it and leave room at the end of the disk so the installer can partition it.\nNext you should choose install in the live-CD (on USB or whatever) and have choose 'something else' in the installer.\nThen you should specify the partitions you would like to use (or free space), if you'd like to partition this partition, how big it should be and where to mount them.\nYou should at least have the / partition chosen somewhere. (a couple of GB is enough)\nAdvisable is a separate /home partition. (because re-installing is much simpler then)\nChoose to partition them to ext4.\nThe installer should install grub for the whole disk. If it ask for it, choose install for all partitions.\n\nA: I fixed the problem. But it didn't worked in 13.04, only in the 12.04 LTS. I followed the instructions from this video to install the GRUB https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7HuurWJTJ4 (it's in portuguese but I think it's easy to everybody understand). \nSo tried to install the GRUB in 13.04 version but it won't work.

Broad open ended questions do not do so well on this site.\n\nA: The Board: yes \nHDMA Video: Yes  \nHDMA Sound: Sorta I have really good results with my Nvidia card, not that, it will help you any.  \neSATA Hotplug: Yes I use in on Ubuntu servers, but should be roughly the same on desktops  \nMax File System/File size: is highly dependant on configuration. Ext3 for example could support partitions up to 32 TiB. On PCs you probably going to get a max size of 16TiB though. RiserFS is 32TiB.

This file is special in that it points to the directory containing the current working directory.

This means that your operation ran on everything in the current working directory, but also the parent directory (/home). Because you specified recursive, you changed every file and directory in your /home folder to whatever ownership you specified. In fact, you may have changed the owner of every single file on your system.

I started using Back In Time about a month ago and have it set to back up my \"work\" folder hourly. All went fine, until today when (after quite a bit of WTF on my part) I found that it had eaten up all my inodes. I had BIT set to use up to 2GB of space and keep backups for a year. It still had plenty of space but it had eaten up all the inodes on that partition. \nI don't see any options in BIT's configuration that are related to inodes. How should I prevent this from happening in the future? \n\nA: You can't that's not how ext4/3/2 works. If you have an odd block size then you will  have fewer inodes and even really tiny files take 1 inode. So back in time, which makes copies of things will eat inodes till your out. \nNow most of the time, you will run out of free space long before you run out of inodes. However that depends on block size. If you have a 1 gig block size (totally bogus but just go with it) your only going to be able to have 250 files/inodes on a 250 Gig hard drive. If you really want to correct the problem then reformat the file system and use a smaller block size.

But as you said you are going to use Spring(Java), so this does not suit you.\nFirst you will need to install MySQL. This can be achieved by installing \"MySQL Server\" on Ubuntu Software Center or with \nsudo apt-get install mysql-server\n\nNext you will need a Java capable web server. Common choices are Tomcat or jetty\nsudo apt-get install tomcat7\n\nAlso you will need to check you have Java Development Kit installed. If you already have one that's ok. If not the easiest to install is OpenJDK:\nsudo apt-get install openjdk7-jdk\n\nFinally you will need a capable IDE. Common choices are Netbeans or Eclipse. You can find both on Software Center. Also there is available in Spring website Spring Tool Suite, which is based on Eclipse and bundles also a webserver.

If yes, do I have to check the wireless network to do so?\n\nA: Network manager will list the available networks and the security (or lack of security). You can connect to any network that is open (unsecured) or if you know the password.

Most likely because of frequency instability (?). Default modeline for 1920x1080 results in a very high frequency that RAMDAC (?) on your video card fails to operate at.\nYou can try to reduce blanking time (RBT) and as a result lower frequency. You have to add new modelines with xranrd as described here. Instead of using cvt or gft, I suggest to use umc. The reason for this is that it can calculate modeline for lower refresh rate with --rbt, e.g. my monitor supports as low as 49.9 Hz refresh rate. cvt would insist on multiples of 60Hz.\nNote on comment reply about LVDS... according to your output you should use DVI-0 when adding and setting new modelines.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.04 update and install issue I've checked several forums and sites for trying to fix this issue.

The original photos show in correct orientation in Image Viewer.  Any answers or ideas?\n\nA: That seems a little odd, are you able to open up Image Viewer and rotate it how you want? First I have ever heard of this, it may be the image is too large height wise so you may need to reduce it using a program such a GIMP\n\nA: I would say this is a bug in the wallpaper displayer : it ignores the \"Orientation\" meta data of the photo. In my case rotating the photo solves the problem because the orientation is rewritten by the program performing the rotation. Still, the Orientation metadata should be taken into account.\n", "Q: How to I add a command to be available from the auto run box for DVD videos?

In many YouTube videos there is a guy talking something to his laptop and recording a movie with his laptop built-in camera and a microphone. My questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*What program do you recommend to shoot such video in Linux?\n\n*How to get rid of a horrible static noise? On my HP Pavilion I can record sound but when I turn up \"L R Capture\" to 100% in order to gain the best sound volume in output recording I can hear a clear background noise. Here  someone has said that it's impossible to remove this sound. But there is no such noise in YouTube videos! How do they do that?\n\nA: I personally use the same I'd use on windows :\nOBS studio.\nthe setup of desktop + webcam or just webcam is intuitive.\nin a terminal type\nsudo apt install ffmpeg -y\n\nthen install obs Studio from flatpack or snap in software center.\npersonally I record sound separately (when I want to have high quality) using Audacity (I would do the same with windows) and I use audacity's noise reduction method to clean up the audio.\nthen I put the audio and video together in an editing app. Kdenlive in my case.\nit's a bit more work but if you're not willing to invest in better hardware (good sound card or external mixer for static-isolated audio + good microphone) that's what it'll be.\n\nA: I've tried several desktop recording programs, and I'd probably have to say the best is VLC. To record the desktop, go to Media -> Convert/ Save, select the \"Capture Device\" tab, then set \"Capture Mode\" to \"Desktop.\" I trust you can figure it out from there.\nAs for sound recording, I trust the advice of the other folks on Superuser. Pros who do videos often buy microphones that they plug into their computers to get great audio quality.\n[EDIT]: To use the webcam to record, follow the instructions as above except instead of \"Capture Mode\" being \"Desktop,\" make it \"Video for Linux\" and select your devices in the slots below. As per the static noise (again), there may be a way to filter it out of the audio using a video editing program (OpenShot, Lightroom) or an audio editing program (Audacity comes to mind).

I want to run a command on startup on my Ubuntu Server. Does anyone know how to do this? Does /etc/rc.local run as superuser? Any help will be appreciated. Thanks!\n\nA: /etc/rc.local will run as root. \nMost of the init process is run as root, or starts out that way. \n\nA: There's a couple of places you can do this:\n/etc/init.d (and then making a link to /etc/rc[runlevel].d - usually 2) works pretty well - so you can specify start up and shut down bits in there.\nThat's kind of an old way (though oh so very easy). You can also do something with upstart. Look at this page (look at the \"Writing Jobs\" section).\nThe big gotcha - the path is normally not quite what you'd expect. So I'd suggest running something along the lines of \"echo $PATH > /init_path\" from whatever script first to see if you might have an issue (check /init_path and see what's in there.. perfectly safe to remove this file). While it's easy to specify paths in your script, it's worth setting the PATH variable accordingly as anything run from whatever script may also need things in PATH.\n", "Q: ecrytfs - purpose of Private.sig and Private.mnt? I just switched to ecryptfs and like it in conjunction with incremental backups.\nBut, what I have not understood is what are Private.sig and Private.mnt files used fore. Why should they be kept especially save for backup as well?\nCould anyone please explain?\n\nA: Private.mnt is a configuration file read by mount.ecryptfs_private at login that defines where your encrypted directory should be mounted.  If you've encrypted your home directory, this will be $HOME.  But some people choose to encrypt some other directory, perhaps a subset of $HOME, like $HOME/Private.\nPrivate.sig contains \"signatures\" or \"hashes\" of your encryption keys.  These are used as \"handles\" to identify the keys in use.  It provides a safe, secure mechanism for eCryptfs to determine if you're using the correct key or not.\nBoth of these are absolutely required and eCryptfs will NOT function properly with out them!!!\nFull disclosure: I'm one of the authors and maintainers of eCryptfs.\n", "Q: Clean install of Ubuntu 12.10 not booting Just installed Ubuntu 12.10 (wasn't 100% happy with 13.04 yet) from a USB drive.

Questions?\nThanks for your help!\nCurios\n\nA: To forward X11 apps over your ssh connection, there needs to be something on your Windows client to which the X11 applications can connect. In other words, you need to run an X server for Windows, which will translate X11 protocol messages from the ssh connection into graphical drawing commands and send mouse and keyboard actions back across the network.\nThere are several options for this, one is Cygwin/X: http://x.cygwin.com/\n\nA: Hmm you've got multiple issues here. Firstly, Ubuntu Server does not come with a GUI so you would have to install xorg and a desktop environment.  xinit and startx alone are not sufficient. I normally use LXDE. \nSecondly you would need a client program on the Windows side to display the forwarded X11 apps. And finally, VNC Viewer is not an X11 client program.\nIf you still want to go the VNC route, you'd also need to install tightvnc or similar on the server side. You should not be running VNC Viewer in listening mode.\nMore details here on Installing a lightweight LXDE+VNC desktop environment on your Ubuntu/Debian VPS\n", "Q: What units does the ntp drift file use? When the ntpd daemon is running, the file: /var/lib/ntp/ntp.drift gets updated periodically.  Example:\n17:20 hostname 118 ~> ls -l /var/lib/ntp/ntp.drift\n-rw-r--r-- 1 ntp ntp 7 May 20 16:46 /var/lib/ntp/ntp.drift\n# So it looks like it was last updated ~34 minutes ago\n\nThe file has one number in it, for example, looking at a 4 virtual hosts, I find these values, respectively:\n-22.086\n-10.214\n-13.669\n6.045\n\nI assume these are seconds per day(?), but not sure.  man ntpd mentions a different drift file /etc/ntp.drift which doesn't seem to exist.  The man page doesn't explain what units are being used for the drift.\nQuestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is /etc/ntp.drift actually /var/lib/ntp/ntp.drift on Ubuntu?\n\n*What units is the drift expressed in?\n\n\nThanks!\n\nA: The drift file is /var/lib/ntp/ntp.drift. This is fairly standard. For RH/Fedora, it's /var/lib/ntp/drift.\nThe units for the drift file are \"PPM\", or \"parts per million\". Your clock will drift due to fluctuations in the frequency oscillating the quartz crystal on your motherboard. A fluctuation of just 0.001% (0.00001, or 10 PPM) means losing or gaining about 1 second per day. NTP has finer grained control than that, so we look at errors of margin using 0.0001% (0.000001, or 1 PPM). Thus:\n\n\n*\n\n*1 PPM = 1 part per million = 1 microsecond per second = 3.6ms per hour = 86.4ms per day\n\n\nThus, my drift file shows the value of \"2.643\" which means my clock is off by 2.643 parts per million, which means it's currently off at 228.3552ms per day.\n\nA: According to the web site https://groups.google.com/forum/m/?fromgroups#!topic/comp.protocols.time.ntp/coDks98gw0U the value is a calculationn made per poll and needs to be divided by 4096 to get the actual drift value in milliseconds\n", "Q: Is possible to split an nautilus window in horizontal?

(I am running an HP dv6 laptop quad core with 8 gigs of ram, I don't dual boot. I run only Ubuntu.) So I backed up my data and wiped my system and installed 13.04 from scratch. It is much speedier but still slower than 12.04 especially booting and shutting down. If I close the lid it goes into suspend but when opened back up the display will not come back.

I really want 13.04 and the enhancements it has but I can't keep working this way.\nThank You in advance!!\n\nA: Something to bear in mind with regard to 13.04 vs 12.04: 12.04 is a long-term support (LTS) release and 13.04 is one of the three intermediate releases between the LTS versions. While major Ubuntu releases are fairly stable in general, there will many more instabilities compared with the LTS versions because they use more recent software and contain newer features. In the LTS releases much higher priority is given to software stability and maturity, whereas the releases in between contain reasonably stable software but perhaps not tested as thoroughly. It's not quite \"bleeding edge\" but it is a lot of newer software and there are likely to be some compatibility issues and breaking of features that used to work.\nUnfortunately that's the trade-off you make between LTS and non-LTS releases: new features versus solid stability. However, a lot of the problems encountered in the non-LTS releases get fixed pretty quickly by the Ubuntu community, so if you're comfortable on the terminal you can usually find a post via Google of somebody's hacked together fix. :)\nAlso, with regard to upgrading, from my own experience and the experiences of others I've read, it's pretty much always better to reinstall new versions from scratch. It's very difficult to make sure the upgrade process works well in all software configurations. I don't worry about it so much for non-critical systems because I'm pretty comfortable fixing the problems myself, but on any machine where I need stability (like my main work PC) I will always back up my junk and install a new version from scratch.\nYou might try searching for issues related to your particular hardware and the drivers in use. You can figure out this out using the lspci command like so:\nanthony@anthony-linpc:~$ lspci\n\nwhich will give you output with lines like these:\n...\n00:1b.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation 7 Series/C210 Series Chipset Family High Definition Audio Controller (rev 04)\n...\n03:00.0 Ethernet controller: Qualcomm Atheros AR8162 Fast Ethernet (rev 10)\n\nThen you can grep the verbose output for the device you're looking for:\nanthony@anthony-linpc:~$ lspci -v | grep -A 6 Wireless\n\nwhich will give you the kernel driver being used:\n02:00.0 Network controller: Atheros Communications Inc.

In the second command I use the -v (verbose) option to show me the kernel driver used (for my WiFi card it's the ath9k driver). You might have some luck putting those into Google, e.g. \"ubuntu 13.04 Atheros ath9k problems\" or something along those lines. (Also, fyi, running lspci with sudo will give you more information, but I don't know how much will be relevant to you for this).\nPersonally it's been a while (I mean like years) since I've had hardware issues with Linux, so I'd be a bit surprised if it weren't a pretty simple fix. Sometimes the hardest part is figuring out what to ask Google.\n", "Q: Advantages of alternative kernel Recently I have seen an WebUpd8 article about an alternative kenrel to the stock Ubuntu kernel, the pf-kernel, that supposed increases performance. I am running Ubuntu 12.10 using kernel 3.5.0-30 generic, with the elevator=noop tweak as I have the OS installed on an SSD, with a separate HDD for data and stuff.\nWill the supposed improvements of the pf-kernel really have an effect on an SSD-based system, or are they more inclined towards HDD performance improvement? Besides, using a laptop, so any changes that harm battery life are not desirable.\npf-kernel modifications/patches:\n\n\n*\n\n*-ck patchset with BFS CPU scheduler: Con Kolivas' ck1 patchset which includes the BFS scheduler that brings better desktop interactivity and responsiveness;\n\n*BFQ I/O scheduler : using this patch, the disk should be virtually as responsive as if it was idle, no matter what the load is (this is available by default in Sabayon and CyanogenMod);\n\n*TuxOnIce: an alternative suspend / hibernate framework that uses image compression, supports any number of swap partitions and/or files, has the ability to cancel hibernating or restoring the image by pressing escape key and more;\n\n*UKSM: Memory De-Duplication;\n\n*EnhanceIO: a driver based on EhanceIO SSD caching software derived from Facebook's open source Flashcache project that's useful for using SSDs as cache devices for traditional HDDs.\n\n\nA: The pf-kernel includes patches to the Linux kernel which means task scheduling, process management, memory management, and SSD caching. Most of the improvements have nothing to do with the speed of your hard drive but rather how the operating system handles the applications running on your computer. They're designed to make the system more efficient, which in many cases might mean faster responses and lower power consumption.\nThere are some features (like SSD caching) which would be useless to you if you don't have a disk drive, but otherwise you should be able to see benefits from the other features in the kernel.\nYou might want to look in to benchmarks and stability first to determine what the risks of using the pf-kernel as opposed to the mainline kernel are and if they're worth the performance increases. If the benefits were significant and the code was stable, I'd find it odd not to be in the mainline.\n", "Q: Does installing zRam have any advantages on a system without SWAP? Running Ubuntu 12.10 here, on an 128Gb SSD and a 4GB RAM system. Ever since I installed the OS, I realised that I dont need the swap partition, as I never use the hibernate function and rarely run out of RAM. However, would installing zRam  bring any real improvement when RAM is full, even if there is no swap partition?\n\nA: Yes enabling zRAM is certainly a best thing.why means zRAM will creates a RAM based block device which acts as a swap disk, but is compressed and stored in memory instead of swap disk  allowing very fast I/O and increasing the amount of memory available before the system starts swapping to disk. \nActually compcache is the original name and its changed to zRAM these days.\nyou can install it with sudo apt-get install zram-config\n\nA: zRAM will only get used if it's needed, so enabling it will have no effect if you don't need it. I very much doubt you will even notice it working when it is needed.\n\nA: It is NOT true that disabling swap is bad. Because if you running out of memory without swap OOM will be invoked and some of tasks just die, you can continue your work. In case with swap it's very easy to run out of memory + out of swap, in this case your machine will hang in disk IO. Most probably reasons you run out of memory (memory leak, huge allocation) - it wouldn't stop on RAM size, it will eat whole swap too and you will run out of memory anyway.\nYou could easily try this with simple program which allocates memory in infinity loop with and without swap.\n\nA: I'd say that if Linux kernel did work perfectly, using zRam and no real swap would be probably pointless unless you know for a fact that the RAM contents will compress really well and you're a bit short on RAM.\nHowever, I'm running system with 32 GiB of RAM, zero real swap and I've installed zram-config but modified /etc/init/zram-config.conf to use only 5% of RAM for zram (instead of default 50%). This allows kernel to see some swap but that swap is hugely faster than any SDD. As a result, all swap-related codepaths inside kernel can be used and I think this has fixed some issues that I had when I didn't have swap at all. (Namely, it seems to me that when RAM is fragmented and the system does not have any swap, the kernel is not clever enough to workaround the problem. However, with zRam or swap on ramdisk, the kernel is able to move pages to swap and relocate during swapin. That's only my theory, though.)\nTL;DR: zRam in a system without real swap space allows kernel to use all swap related codepaths which may avoid some bugs.\n\nA: I would presume whether or not you have swap space is more or less irrelevant to the usefulness of zRam. Regardless of whether or not you have zRam installed, if you run out of RAM with no swap space, bad things start to happen. :-)\nIf you do expect to run out of RAM, then zRAM could be helpful because it essentially expands the amount of data you can store in RAM (assuming it's not of unreasonably high entropy) so it will take longer to fill up. So it might buy you some more time, assuming you're not storing large arrays of random numbers.\nIf you're 99.9% sure you won't get close to running out of RAM (i.e. you have 16GB on your web-only netbook), than anything stored in zRAM is needlessly requiring extra CPU time to compress and decompress, so it's not really beneficial in this case.\nIf you're on the high end of the RAM usage spectrum (on average over 50-60%, for example) you might benefit from some additional peace of mind using zRAM. (Or you could buy more RAM.)\nI suppose you have to evaluate your normal and heavily-loaded RAM utilization (average and max) and what kind of data you work with.\n", "Q: Question regarding the dhcpd.leases file for ISC-DHCP-SERVER (Ubuntu 12.04 LTS x64) Backstory: I am in the process of replacing a SINGLE Debian 3.1 (Sarge) ISC-DHCP-SERVER with 2 Ubuntu 12.04 LTS x64 servers running ISC-DHCP-SERVER in failover mode.

You need to do it the same way with an LVM partition just as with a simple partition. The tool to use is the mkfs with the proper parameters. Specifying the filesystem type and the device name will suffice. If you want to create an ext4 type filesystem, this will work:\nsudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/TheServer-vg/lv_media\nSimilarly substitute ext4 with other filesystem type if you like, though the [TAB] key will help as usual.\n", "Q: My fan is always on but not in MSWindows (HP elitebook 8460p) Problem: My laptop(new) fan is ALWAYS on.\n\nQuestion: What can I do to solve this issue?\n\nSituation:\n\n\n*\n\n*HP Elitebook 8460p\n\n*Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (clean install, no mod, nothing... really clean... no dust... not - even a little mod but the things I've tried to solve this issue)\n\n*intel i5-2540M\n\n*Kernel: 3.5.0-30-generic #51~precise1-Ubuntu SMP Wed May 15 08:48:19 UTC 2013 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\n*8GB\n\n*SSD HD\n\n*ATI radeon 6470M 1GB(proprietary drivers, latest but not Beta as of 21/05/2013)\n\n*low cpu speed (current governor: ondemand [same problem on all governor])\n\n*low GPU and CPU temp: around 50C\n\n*low cpu load\n\n*fan: faster when laptop is pluged to AC, slower on batteries but always on\n\n*the fan behave like I think it should in Win7.\n\n\nWhat I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*Search... a lot... then read... a lot... then search, then read, search,read, well I think you understand\n\n*read about related and not so related issues on askubuntu.\n\n*install cpufrequtil and set the thing properly\n\n*set powersaver option in catalyst to save power (I suppose it's slow down everything)\n\n*disable vsync in catalyst (why?

The source was my discrete graphic card. With AMD Radeon base card I found out there is only two options: proprietary drivers(Fglrx, Catalyst) and open source(Radeon)\nI tried both drivers. They both have their advantages and disadvantages. I'm not saying there's one better than the other but Radeon (ATI/AMD Radeon base graphic card, MIT license) was closer of what I needed. When I set my card to low, everything goes almost silent. This drivers package is automatically installed during a fresh install of Ubuntu 12.04.\nYou can then configure your GPU drivers power management feature. Here's my personal notes on how to configure those power management parameters.\nThere are two options for power management:\n\n\n*\n\n*dynpm : (don't work with multiple screens)\n\nThe \"dynpm\" method dynamically changes the clocks based on the number of pending fences, so performance is ramped up when running GPU intensive apps, and ramped down when the GPU is idle. The reclocking is attemped during vertical blanking periods, but due to the timing of the reclocking functions, doesn't not always complete in the blanking period, which can lead to flicker in the display. Due to this, dynpm only works when a single head is active.\n\nsource: http://wiki.x.org/wiki/RadeonFeature\necho dynpm | sudo tee /sys/class/drm/card0/device/power_method\n\n\n*profile (works well with multiple screens)\nThis allows you to set a specific power management profile for the card. If you choose this option, you'll also have to setup the second file\necho profile | sudo tee /sys/class/drm/card0/device/power_method\necho <profile of choice> | sudo tee /sys/class/drm/card0/device/power_profile\n\nYou'll need to replace <profile of choice> with one of the following profiles:\n\n\n*\n\n*default - Uses the default clocks and does not change the power state. This is the default behavior.\n\n*auto - Selects between \"mid\" and \"high\" power states based on the whether the system is on battery power or not. The \"low\" power state are selected when the monitors are in the dpms off state.\n\n*low - Forces the gpu to be in the low power state all the time. Note that \"low\" can cause display problems on some laptops; this is why auto does not use \"low\" when displays are active.\n\n*mid - Forces the gpu to be in the \"mid\" power state all the time. The \"low\" power state is selected when the monitors are in the dpms off state.\n\n*high - Forces the gpu to be in the \"high\" power state all the time. The \"low\" power state is selected when the monitors are in the dpms off state.\nSet your settings permanently (well until you change it)\nBy default echoing anything into /sys/ will be replaced at reboot (they aren't real files). So to persist these settings, you need to rewrite them at boot.\nSources:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.techytalk.info/ubuntu-open-source-ati-radeon-driver-power-usage-tweaks/\n\n*Tweaks and configuration for Radeon Open Source driver\nStart by creating a new file with sudoedit /etc/init.d/ati-profiler and then pasting in the following code:\n#! /bin/sh\n### BEGIN INIT INFO\n# Provides: ati-profiler\n# Required-Start: $remote_fs $all\n# Required-Stop:\n# Default-Start: 2 3 4 5\n# Default-Stop: 0 1 6\n# Short-Description: Change GPU profile to LOW after 10 sec.\n# Description: You can change your GPU profile ass you wish\n### END INIT INFO\n\nsleep 10\necho profile > /sys/class/drm/card0/device/power_method\necho low > /sys/class/drm/card0/device/power_profile\n\nThen run:\nsudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/ati-profiler\nsudo update-rc.d ati-profiler defaults\n\nIf you want to revert this, just run:\nsudo update-rc.d ati-profiler remove\nsudo rm /etc/init.d/ati-profiler\n\nTip: You can change your setting when you want by just echoing to it. You don't need to set everything at boot.\n", "Q: How to repair a failed program install on Ubuntu? I had a program installing on Ubuntu called 'ubuntu-restricted-extras' and then my system shutdown because of powerfailure, I restarted and then tried the installation again and it comes up with a message saying \"Previous Installation hasn't been completed.\" and then tells me that I have to repair this before I can install or remove any further software. What do I need to do to fix this?\n\nA: Open a terminal by hitting Ctrl+Alt+T, and type the following:\nsudo dpkg --configure -a\n\n(Enter your password when prompted.)\nThis will start configuring packages (applications) that were about to be installed (unpacked) but not configured. Once this is finished, open up the Ubuntu Software Center and try to install the program again (if it's not already installed).\nIf the above does not fix your problem, type the following in the terminal:\nsudo apt-get -f install\n\nThis will attempt to download and install packages that are needed to run programs.\n", "Q: How to populate configuration files over a lot of servers?

I want to do it automatically.\nHow I can make it? What you can recommend for me?\n\nA: A good way is managing your configuration files in a code repository, saying github. \nEvery time you change locally, push your change.

After upgrading to 13.04 the wifi usually fails to find a network and after a while the network manager crashes.

I also removed existing  /lib/firmware/iwlwifi* files (e.g. iwlwifi-5000-5.ucode) and copied the new iwlwifi-5000-1.ucode in the firmware directory\nsudo mv /lib/firmware/*iwlwifi* ~/keep_iwlwif\nsudo cp iwlwifi-5000-1.ucode /lib/firmware\n\nAfter rebooting sudo lshw -class network displayed the firmware=5.4.1.16 which seemed good to me but the dmesg displayed following iwlwifi errors.\n[   14.196502] iwlwifi 0000:02:00.0: request for firmware file 'iwlwifi-5000-5.ucode' failed.\n[   14.200629] iwlwifi 0000:02:00.0: request for firmware file 'iwlwifi-5000-4.ucode' failed.\n[   14.204814] iwlwifi 0000:02:00.0: request for firmware file 'iwlwifi-5000-3.ucode' failed.\n[   14.253843] iwlwifi 0000:02:00.0: request for firmware file 'iwlwifi-5000-2.ucode' failed.\n\nI decided to add the iwlwifi-5000-5.ucode back to /lib/firmware and rebooted. After reboot I was back in where I started, sudo lshw -class network displayed again the firmware=8.83.5.1 and no dmesg errors for iwlwifi. Moreover, the wifi didn't work any better.\n\nA: I have the same wireless card and downloaded the iwlwifi-5000-5.ucode\nfrom here and added that to the lib/firmware director and its working well.

However, if I do so, my pidgin icon disappears also. \nOn my panel, there are two icons served by the applet: pidgin icon and a mail icon with small black number showing how many notifications are there.

However, sometimes when going to remote websites, well known websites like sky.com or bbc.com instead of loading that website Chrome will attempt to load the page from localhost (the browser will display whatever site I'm developing locally).  After hitting reload a few times or pressing enter a couple of times in the address bar it will sometimes decide to load the remote version, but not always.\nIf the address is https then it always works (but then I'm not developing https sites locally either).  \nIn the address bar it still has the remote address, but the page displayed is from localhost, or a \"not found\" page.\n\nA: Just found that disabling apache2 appears to work around it:\nsudo /etc/init.d/apache2 stop\n\nThat's not a fix, however, since it should all work fine when apache2 is running \n\nA: It sounds suspiciously like you've inadvertently set your browser's proxy setting to localhost:80.

They have been ignored, or old ones used instead.\n\nNote: \nThis happened immediately after I installed Ubuntu 12.04. I am very new to the Linux/Ubuntu world and a noob when it comes to these kind of stuff.\nThe Sources list in the Update Manager (and Software Center) settings was short. It only contained 2 lines with \"Canonical\" in it, 2 lines with \"Independent\" in it, and 2 other lines. I think the list was short because it was a freshly installed Ubuntu.\nConnection to the internet seems fine and my friend whose laptop had just been installed with Ubuntu 12.04 around the same time as mine, seems to have no problem with his update. We share the same connection so I think internet connection issues couldn't have been the reason for the error.\nAttempted Solutions:\nFrom here, I explored around /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d and added in the /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head the following:\nnameserver 8.8.8.8\nnameserver 8.8.4.4\n\nError still occured.\nFrom here and here, I repeatedly changed which Mirror server to use in the Update manager and Software sources settings. Again, error still occured.\nI also tried editing my sources list, unchecking the lines with \"independent\" on it(as suggested). According to here, I tried removing the derb-src lines in the sources list. Still, to no avail.\nLastly, this site suggests running the following:\necho \"nameserver 8.8.8.8\" | sudo tee /etc/resolv.conf > /dev/null\nor, for a permanent solution,\necho \"nameserver 8.8.8.8\" | sudo tee /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/base > /dev/null\n\nSadly, nothing worked for me. In all forums that I have been to, the answer related to nameserver 8.8.8.8 seems to come up most often. Take note also that I really did not understand the solutions, what they meant or how are they done. I just simply followed them.\nThis is the output for cat /etc/apt/sources.list:\n# deb cdrom:[Ubuntu 12.04 LTS _Precise Pangolin_ - Release amd64 (20120425)]/ dists/precise/main/binary-i386/\n\n# deb cdrom:[Ubuntu 12.04 LTS _Precise Pangolin_ - Release amd64 (20120425)]/ dists/precise/restricted/binary-i386/\n# deb cdrom:[Ubuntu 12.04 LTS _Precise Pangolin_ - Release amd64 (20120425)]/ precise main restricted\n\n# See http://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes for how to upgrade to\n# newer versions of the distribution.\ndeb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu precise main restricted\ndeb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu precise main restricted\n\n## Major bug fix updates produced after the final release of the\n## distribution.\ndeb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu precise-updates main restricted\ndeb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu precise-updates main restricted\n\n## N.B. software from this repository is ENTIRELY UNSUPPORTED by the Ubuntu\n## team.

I tried choosing different servers but the \"choose server\" was never available. Searching for the best server yielded a \"No suitable server\" result. I think the mirror servers are fine and again, there seems to be no issue with internet connection. \nUsing ping -c3 archive.ubuntu.com and ping -c3 8.8.8.8  both yielded 0% packet loss.

I just realized that the problem was not on the system but instead how the system connects and retrieves data from the internet. I just configured my Network settings and changed the proxy detection to Manual and filled in the HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and Socks Host blanks the proxy that I use. When I updated again, this error output happened at first:\nE: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (11 Resource temporarily unavailable)\nE: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/)\n\nWell, not exactly like the same but similar to it (I copied above from here). But when I tried updating again, it finally worked(the reason I posted the error output above and not the exact output I saw) and I can now choose a different mirror server. If the Network proxy configuration was really the reason for my woes, well, I kinda felt stupid for such basic mistake.\nAnyway, thanks everybody for your help! :)\n\nA: Edit /etc/resolv.conf. In a Terminal window run\nsudo gedit /etc/resolv.conf\n\nand add the line\nnameserver 8.8.8.8\n\nand save. Then do\nping www.google.com\n\nIf this succeeds then run the following commands\nsudo apt-get --download-only --reinstall install resolvconf\nsudo dpkg --purge --force-depends resolvconf\nsudo apt-get install resolvconf\n\nIf resolving now fails then right-click on the network indicator in the bar at the top of the desktop, click Edit Connections, select your connection, Click Edit | IPv4 Settings. Change Method from Automatic (DHCP) to Automatic (DHCP) addresses only and enter 8.8.8.8 in the Additional DNS servers field. Click Save.... Verify that /etc/resolv.conf now contains a line nameserver 8.8.8.8 and that you can still ping www.google.com.\n\nA: I was facing the same problem and figured the easiest solution is to reset the sources of /etc/apt/sources.list. To do so, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Obtain the release of your Ubuntu version, type into the console:\nlsb_release -r\n\n\n*Go to http://repogen.simplylinux.ch/ to generate a new sources.list\n\n*Select your country & release\n\n*Check the first 12 boxes:\n\n\n*Generate and copy your new list\n\n*Backup the old file to sources.list.old\nmv /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.old\n\n\n*You can now either open vi to save the new list by doing:\nvi /etc/apt/sources.list\n(Paste and save using `:wq`)\n\nOr by copying and pasting into your terminal the \"curl\" command (including a unique URI for your updated source list) as it is presented under \"Sources List\" on the repogen output page. \n\n*G2G, retry running apt-get update\n\nA: Do this\nsudo bash -c 'echo \"nameserver 127.0.0.1\" >> /etc/resolv.conf'\n\nThen do sudo apt-get update to see if it works.\n\nA: I had the same error and found out it was because I had added the armhf architecture.\nRun this-\nsudo dpkg --print-foreign-architectures\nIts better to remove any new architectures as not all repositories have index files for them and cause this error.\nRun-\nsudo dpkg --remove-architecture <architecture name>\nand then-\nsudo apt-get update\nThis solved the issue for me.\nHope it helps... :)\n", "Q: Safe to install from daily build PPA?

If that's the case, you're all done but if you want to do something with these numbers on a regular basis, you're probably using the wrong tool.\n", "Q: Can I set a specific group|umask to be the default one for all actions within a certain path? I would like to override the default umask and owner:group settings within certain directories only, without requiring root privileges, as that kind of defeats the purpose.\nFor example, when I touch a file in /var/www/ it becomes 0755 and owned by redsandro:redsandro.\nI would like this to default to 0770 and redsandro:www-data for everything within /var/www/.\nMaybe there's a better solution for this specific scenario. This seemed to be the only way to have both my non-root user and the webserver in full control over /var/www/. As the only user of this machine, I like the htdocs to be 'mine' without being root. Apache becomes fed up though when you take too much territory inside htdocs.\nHere is a related question for the umask part where the answer is \"no\". But I am sure others have sought the same functionality, and I can imagine pwd based umask is available somehow just like git uses .git to store pwd independent settings that go up the directory-tree. Or down, I'm not sure if you call subdirectories up or down the tree. ;)\n\nA: Partial answer:\nAdd the setgid bit on the parent directory:\nsudo chown redsandro:www-data /var/www\nsudo chmod 2770 /var/www\n\nalternately:\nsudo chmod u=rwx,g=rwxs /var/www\n\n\nA: Since you desire both user and group set this should work.\nsudo chown -R redsandro:www-data /var/www\n\nTo change ownership.\nThen do:\nsudo u=rwx, g=rwxs /var/www\n\nTo keep that ownership change above permanent.\n", "Q: Rhytmbox alternative for built-in tags I have tracks in formats that either not supported for tagging in Rhytmbox or don't have any tagging support at all and I want to scrobble them, which, naturally, requires at least artist and track name.\nIs there a way to \"tag locally\" in Rhytmbox's playlist independently of actual physical format, so it will keep information, display it and report it to scrobbling and other plugins?\n\nA: Any \"tags\" you set in Rhythmbox, are not set in the files themselves, but only in the library database of Rhythmbox. You can simply right click on any song in your library, choose Properties, and edit the title and artist for the track. This will save the values in the Rhythmbox database, and the audioscrobbler plug-in should use those values to post them to last.fm or libre.fm.\n", "Q: Logon Failed Ubuntu 13.04 I have a problem with my Ubuntu 13.04.\nI installed it beside Windows 8 using the Wubi-installer.

Even when I gave 'pppp' as a password during the installation I'm not able to logon to my Ubuntu machine.\nCan somebody please help me?\nRegards\n\nA: The simple answer, as Web-E pointed out, is that WUbI is incompatible with Windows 8, and should not have been on the CD.  The best option here is to boot from the CD (or a live USB key), and install Ubuntu directly onto its own partition.\n", "Q: Media Player for Ubuntu Is there a media player for Ubuntu which will reliably play a music CD from start to finish? I have tried for the last 3 months to get Rhythmbox to run without success. It freezes dafter the first song or two.\n\nA: To properly play disc media on Ubuntu, you will need to install and setup libdvdcss.

I see the error, then the screen just goes black and gives me a blinking cursor. The solutions I have found online tell me to open up a terminal only after the OS boots correctly. Sadly, I cannot even get to that stage, so I can't use that solution.\nHelp?\nBy the way, I am VERY new to Virtual Box and creating virtual machines, so excuse me if I'm not familiar with some of the terminology. Another thing, if it helps, is that I'm running Windows 7 as my host OS.\n\nA: Turn off the option \"Enable Nested Paging\" in the VirtualBox configuration under Settings->System->Acceleration.\nThis allowed me to get Ubuntu running with the desktop.\n\nA: The \"SMBus base address uninitialized\" message is an issue with VirtualBox. It's purely a cosmetic issue, and will not affect or hinder the operation of the virtual machine.\nThis is FIXED in VirtualBox 5.1.4. (change logs) Upgrade to the latest version of VirtualBox to eliminate the error message. \nDisabling Nested Paging, as suggested in some answers, will not eliminate the \"SMBus base address uninitialized\" message. In addition, it will likely make your guest OS slower. \nThe fact that your machine won't boot is a different problem. You'll need to find a way to check the virtual machine's boot log. \n\nA: The error message is not related to the problem of Ubuntu not booting. I have had the same problem. After displaying the error message the colors became crazy and the system seems to halt, however moving the mouse resulted in some pixel garbage.\nDisabling \"Nested Paging\" in Setting->System->Acceleration allows to start the system.\nTested using VirtualBox 4.3.20 (64bit on Windows 7) with Kubuntu 14.10. After changing the setting, I was able to boot and install Kubuntu, however the error message appears on every boot.\n\nA: If you have ICH9 available, switch to that instead of the PIIX3 chipset  (Settings->System->Motherboard). Support for it is 'Experimental' by VirtualBox, but it's stable on my Mac Book Pro host.\n\nA: This answer is copied from Blog of Finster » VirtualBox piix4_smbus Error, slightly modified:\n\nSMBus base address uninitialized - upgrade bios or use force_addr=0xaddr\nThis error is caused by VM having no smbus but Ubuntu always trying to\n  load the module.

Anything from incompatible settings of your virtual machine to incompatibilites with your Windows kernel or drivers.\nTry to boot the virtual machine while pressing and holding the left Shift key to boot a root shell for further investigation, to upgrade your guest OS, or to install the guest additions.\n\nA: I am running Virtual Box 5.0.0 r101573 on Windows 7 Enterprise SP1. Ubuntu 15.04 has the problem listed, which went away after I unchecked Enable Nested Paging.\n\nA: This message appeared in my VirtualBox while I was installing/starting Ubuntu 15.10. (The same problem occurred for previous versions as well.)\nSolution\n\n\n*\n\n*Restart the host computer.\n\n*Go into the BIOS settings.\n\n*Enable Intel® Virtualization Technology (Intel® VT).\n\n*Save the BIOS configuration and reboot.\n\n*Start VirtualBox.\n\n*Press Ctrl+S or right click on your guest OS and \nclick Settings.\n\n*Go to System -> Acceleration.\n\n*Check Enable Nested Paging.\n\n\n\nBoot the Ubuntu guest, and voilà it works without any problem.\n\nA: I encountered the same issue after an Ubuntu software update. (The kernel image was updated with this batch of updates.)\nWorkaround\n\n*\n\n*Enter Grub menu recovery mode for your kernel.\n\n*Result: The OS loads completely.\n\nA persistent workaround\n\n*\n\n*Edit /boot/grub/grub.cfg and add nomodeset after quiet splash.\n\n*Result: The OS will load completely even after restarts.\n\nSolution:\nOnce inside the OS (after a successful boot), reinstall the VirtualBox Guest Additions.\nNote: The error message still shows up even when the workaround/solution is applied.\nHost: OS X Yosemite 10.10.3\nGuest: Ubuntu 15.10 (Lubuntu)\nKernel: 4.2.0-25 generic (updated from 4.2.0-16)\nVBox: 5.0.14\n\nA: I got the same error as mentioned by OP while installing Ubuntu 14.04 for the first time on VirtualBox 5.0.4r, Windows 7 (64 bit) (see screenshot).\nGuest_VH's answer did not work as the fields were greyed out, so I could not uncheck the box for \"Enable Nested Paging\".\nHere is the the solution that worked for me:\nHit \"Enter\" key after you see that error screen. Voilà! It logged right in for me.\n\nA: From RedHat - https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2115401\nResolution\n\n*\n\n*The warning can be avoided by blacklisting the i2c-piix4 kernel module:\n\n#echo \"blacklist i2c_piix4\" >> /etc/modprobe.d/no_i2c_piix4.conf\n\n*\n\n*The initramfs/initrd does not need to be rebuilt even though the module still resides in the initramfs/initrd.\n\nRoot Cause\nEssentially, the i2c-piix4 kernel module attempts to read from something that does not exist in some cases, which causes that module to print the noted error and exit. This error does not prevent a failure to boot and is only informational.\nThe warning is harmless and caused by the device's PCI config register 0x090 being set to 0. When the kernel module i2c-piix4 tries to read the PCI config register, it reads the 0 which causes the i2c-piix4 module's initialization to fail with -ENODEV error, essentially meaning that the device does not exist as far as the module can tell. The implication to this is lm-sensors will not be able to use the piix4 chipset SMBus features.\nFor example, Xen's qemu-dm source code shows that support SMBus I/O space registers (including 0x090) is not implemented. The same is true for upstream xen qemu-dm.\n\nA: Encountered a similar issue and the same fix worked for me.\nOn my pc i get a blank screen and in VirtualMachine i get the force_addr=0xaddr error after upgrading from a workstation.\nFound the fix at: My computer boots to a black screen, what options do I have to fix it?\nJust hold Shift when starting to get into GRUB, press E to edit the entry, search for \"quiet splash\" (without commas) erase that and type in \"nomodeset\" (no commas) and then press Ctrl+X to boot. \nI actually typed just \"nomode\" once and it still booted for me.\n\nA: Solved in my case. \nWhen I loaded a virtual Mint 17.1 on a Virtualbox 5.0.0, I stranded in this situation. I tried the procedures shown by MountainX.  \nNext, an another error (No support for locale: en_US.utf8) occured and was solved by this command: \nlocale-gen --purge --no-archive\n\nAfter that, I encoutered a login loop and attempted to solved it with a following article (Japanese): \nhttp://kledgeb.blogspot.jp/2013/03/ubuntu-x-3.html\nrm -f /home/<user>/.ICEauthority\nrm -f /home/<user>/.Xauthority\n\nFinally a virtual mint 17.1 works well on a VirtualBox 5.0.0. \nI wish this will help you. \n\nA: I think it is a common problem caused by not changing the boot order from 'optical disk' to 'hard disk' and can be remedied by 'Power off' the VM then selecting the \"System\" setup option in the VM and UNcheck the \"Optical Disk\" selection in the boot order. Then try again ...\nI sometimes forget to do it too and have been using VM's since dinosaurs ruled ... :). I also move the \"Optical Disk\" down in the selection order but doubt that matters - it is not a real 'BIOS' option for the VM even tho' it does act like it.\nIt could of course be something more sinister/complicated but this method has always worked for me. \nHTH ...\n\nA: Turn off other virtual machines. This includes \"saved-state\" machines.\nWhew, I thought I was in trouble for a second there.\nRunning Ubuntu 16.04 i386 on a 64 bit system; decided to install a 64 bit version of Ubuntu on a virtual machine. I looked up everything and it says I can do it. \nWhen I ran the ISO on the VM using Oracle Virtualbox, I kept seeing an orange error on boot similar to this one:\nSMBus base address uninitialized - upgrade BIOS or use force_addr=0xaddr\nThen the display was all colors and blocks and you know was like \"This is a test of the emergency broadcast system...\" \nIt didn't say that; it just looked like that to me.\nAnyway, I have another VM on Virtualbox that I'd left in a \"saved state.\" \nI force quit her. I was able to boot to the ISO on the PIA machine after that. \n\nA: Same symptoms as The Emperor of the Republic when installing Ubuntu 16.04 LTS desktop to vm on Virtual Box 5.0.20.  Changing to 2 processors and 48MB Video memory and disabling Nested Paging under System / Acceleration permitted installation, but had similar screen on reboot.  Booted into grub recovery mode took care of it.\n\nA: Got the same problem and tried @Guest_vh way still not working.\nThe solution that worked for me was pretty simple. I updated my Virtual Box, before i was using 5.0 version, after update to version 5.1.8 it's work without problem :|\n\nA: I got this error after playing with partitions, in my case was a problem with the swap partition. And the problem was that in /etc/fstab I had a line like this\nUUID=33b1d2c1-84cb-4ccf-a5f6-30dcf6174e49 none            swap    sw              0       0\n\nBut the UUID was no longer valid. So the system was a little bit crazy trying to mount the partition, and ended without mounting any swap space.\nThe command blkid gives you the actual UUID for your partitions. \n\nA: I am loading a virtual Ubuntu 14.04 onto a virtual Mint 17.1. \nThe error was the same however I just continued to boot until it booted up. We're talking about a host to guest in which becomes the host to another guest. Don't get concerned about errors, just simply get back up and start \"walking\" again.\n\nA: I started receiving the exact same error when starting a VM of Ubuntu 14.04 inside VirtualBox.  In my case the acceleration options mentioned by maytham were grayed out. I was able to correct the issue by increasing the processor execution cap from 1% to 41% (Settings->System->Processor).\nimage of VB system>processor options\n\nA: Only Enable EFI checked allowed me to be able to install, just saying.\nIt's on one the tabs in system, where I was looking about the nested option.\n(I must provide a more complete answer, with the exact details.

Try 'apt-get -f install' with no packages (or specify a solution).\n\n\nA: That message means that gnome 3 requires packages to work that apt-get isn't able to install, probably because they are not available in the default repositories. Which makes sense because gnome 3 isn't the default ubuntu desktop. Googling around tells me you have 2 choices -- either to install a Ubuntu 12.10 'remix' which comes with gnome 3 out of the box, or to install the required packages yourself, which looks to be but a matter of adding some repositories. Here is a tutorial I found but have not used: http://www.webupd8.org/2012/10/how-to-get-complete-gnome-3-desktop-in.html\n\nA: The standard GNOME Shell, in addition to various core components and apps, are available in the default Ubuntu 12.10 software repositories. Most of the components are at version 3.6.x.\nInstalling GNOME Shell\nThere are various methods of installing the GNOME Shell in Ubuntu 12.10:\nWithout Adding Repositories\nIf you want to avoid adding additional software repositories, you can install the GNOME Shell from the default software sources. For just the Shell and default settings, go to Terminal (Control - Alt - T) and type:\nsudo apt-get install gnome-shell ubuntu-gnome-default-settings;\n\nIf you want to use the GDM login manager, type:\nsudo apt-get install gdm;\ndpkg-reconfigure gdm;\n\nMake sure to select GDM after typing the last command.\nUsing the GNOME 3 PPA\nIf you want some more up-to-date components of the Shell, use the official GNOME 3 PPA. First, go to Terminal (Control - Alt - T) and add the repository:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:gnome3-team/gnome3;\nsudo apt-get update;\n\nTo install the shell, use the same instructions as the method above. You can use the instructions above to switch to GDM if you wish also.Then, you can upgrade all of your packages with software from the new repository with:\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade;\n\nMake sure to keep your packages updated by running the last two commands often.\nThe Complete Desktop\nFor very some extra components that are not available in the GNOME 3 PPA, you can use the GNOME 3 Staging PPA. Please beware that, although this repository contains some useful programs, contains primarily unstable software and has a high probability of breaking your system. Avoid using this on a production computer.\nIf you choose to continue, you can add the source and update your packages with the commands below:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:gnome3-team/gnome3-staging;\nsudo apt-get update;\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade;\n\nInstalling GNOME 3 Applications\nThe next step in attaining a complete GNOME 3 Desktop is installing the apps made for the GNOME Shell. Whether or not you have added any repositories, you can install the basic apps with the command below:\nsudo apt-get install gnome-clocks gnome-software-manager gnome-boxes gnome-documents epiphany-browser gnome-tweak-tool evolution ubuntu-gnome-desktop;\n\nIf you want, you can install GNOME Shell Extensions at http://extensions.gnome.org.\nUseful links:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.webupd8.org/2012/10/how-to-get-complete-gnome-3-desktop-in.html\n", "Q: Am I using upstart correctly? I'm trying to write a startup script for my Ubuntu 12.04 desktop that pings my Netgear router every 30 seconds (this is necessary as a nasty workaround for a separate problem I'm having). I read this tutorial here, and it seems that I could accomplish this with a simple keep-alive.conf script:\nscript\n    ping -i 30 192.168.1.1\nend script\n\nIf that's correct, then I assume I just need to save this script to /etc/init.d/keep-alive.conf?\nI'm also not seeing how I tie the execution of this script to a \"startup\" event...\nThanks in advance for help on placing the script, and connecting to startup events!\n\nA: Salem's comment is correct. Upstart has job configurations at /etc/init. start on started network-manager is also a reasonable choice.\nYou might also need to put respawn stanza in case ping exits for some reason. Adding stop on stopping network-manager might also be reasonable so ping will exit at shutdown.\nComplete script might looks like this:\nstart on started network-manager\nstop on stopping network-manager\nrespawn\nexec ping -i 30 192.168.1.1\n\nand would be placed at /etc/init/keep-alive.conf.\n", "Q: Unable to locate package update-manager-core Following the guide I found here I am trying to upgrade my Ubuntu version from 10.10 to 12.04.\nAs  do-release-upgrade gave the error command not found I tried to install update-manager-core which results in this error\nroot@myserver:~# apt-get install update-manager-core\nReading package lists...

But all these releases are EOL, they are not supported any more. For this reason I suggest you back up the essential parts of your system and install 12.04 LTS.\nWhat should you back up? The debian project has a very good description. It boils down to:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*/home\n  \n*/etc\n  \n*/var/lib/dpkg\n  \n*/var/lib/apt/extended_states  \n  \n*the output of dpkg --get-selections \"*\" (the quotes are important).  \n  \n*If you use aptitude to manage packages on your system, you will also want to back up /var/lib/aptitude/pkgstates.\n  \n*data for any servers you have running  \n  \n\n", "Q: How do I install Ubuntu with a usb on a Dell that has no Operating System?

It's just a little annoying to see these errors fly by on boot.\n\nA: I solved this by creating the two files listed (as root, of course). They are empty, but it stops the complaint when booting. The x64 is an NFS/http/tftp/BOOTP server, and does not seem to be affected either way. There was no problem with functionality before, and none after. The only change is the absence of the error from the boot log.\n", "Q: how do I get maximal compressed screenshots? I'd like to compress my screenshots as much as possible before I send them via email. The best compression ratio I only got with some work on each screenshot:\n\n\n*\n\n*first I took the screenshot with shutter: 1920x1080px, PNG compression 9 -> around 450Kb \n\n*then I uploaded it to http://tinypng.org/ -> got the same picture with quantisation but only around 150Kb left\n\n\nhow could I achieve such a good compression within a screenshot tool like shutter?\nThe technique of http://tinypng.org seems fabulous: \n\nsimilar colours in your image are combined. This technique is called “quantisation”. Because the number of colours is reduced, 24-bit PNG files can be converted to much smaller 8-bit indexed colour images. All unnecessary metadata is stripped too. The result: tiny 8-bit PNG files\n\nBut shutter has no \"quantisation\" option.\nThe Quality is not that important, I wouldn't mind to have it more lossy. Maybe with GIF it would be possible to compress smaller? Or with less colors?\n\nA: optipng is certainly worth a look at . It's command-line but you could write a .desktop handler for it. It's fairly simple to use for batching:\noptipng -o7 *.png\n\nBut note it's destructive. It will overwrite your files.

If you do not want to make that change, you might be satisfied with different icons.\nInstalling unity-tweak-tool will allow you to change your icon theme.

However, when I try to install Ubuntu with a USB, it doesn't give me the option to dual boot. I can only \"Replace Windows 7 with Ubuntu\", or \"Something Else\".\nI've installed Ubuntu on this computer before, and this option was present. What I'm asking for is a way to get that option, or how to use the \"Something else\" option.\n\nA: How many partitions do you have. If you happen to have 4 primary partitions, then Ubuntu will say to replace your existing Windows since there are no more primary partition slots left (The maximum is 4 primary partitions).\nCheck to see if this is the case and decide which partition you wish to remove or change to a logical partition.\nThe explanation (With images) can be found in Is it possible to have Windows 8 and Ubuntu on the same hard drive?\nThe answer should give you an idea of how to remove one of the primary ones and create a logical one which can be extended to several partitions.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.04 Stuck During Boot After Grub I just upgraded Ubuntu from 12.10 to 13.04 today.

But, this is a workaround and not a fix those links offer more technical suggestions, but those are beyond my ability to comprehend. So my question is: How to fix the default Ubuntu option in grub so that it doesn't display the wall of scrolling text and freeze?\n\nA: When you change the default menu selection you're not changing the version of the OS you're just changing the version of the kernel you're loading.\nIf that works, that's fine: It sounds like something changed in the kernel version that ships with the updated version of Ubuntu.

After that you can only use application menu to exit.\n\nA: This would probably be more appropriate as a comment, but I can't make one yet.\nIf the primary problem you're having is accidentally closing your terminal, I suggest looking into Guake.

I am dual-booting OS X 10.8.3 and Ubuntu. For some reason, Ubuntu thinks that my system is a laptop. Under the \"Displays\" settings, it only says laptop. I ran the 'sudo laptop-detect -v' command in a terminal, and it says \"We're a laptop (ACPI batteries found)\" does anyone know why this is? It doesn't affect my system or anything, it's just kind of annoying and I would like to change it. Is this possible, or is this just a bug in the code?\n\nA: I'm not sure how ubuntu determines this, but it probably thinks that due to the hardware commonly used in imacs. I don't know exactly what hardware the 2010 imac has, but if it's anything like the 2012 imac then it has laptop grade components, ie a laptop grade gpu and cpu.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Compatibility I'm in the process of building a computer for a customer who has requested Ubuntu 13.04 to be installed could someone tell me if the following components are compatible.\n\n\n*\n\n*CPU: Pentium G2020   \n\n*mobo: Gigabyte GA-H61MA-D3V    \n\n*RAM: 4GB 1333MHz DDR3  \n\n\nA: I can say for sure that the Gigabyte GA-H61 will work out of the box. No problems there. For the CPU and RAM they will work correctly, specially if you are using 13.04 since it is the latest (They would have worked with older version of Ubuntu up to 12.04 if I am not mistaken).\nSo yeah, you will have full compatibility with all of that.\nFor reference here are other questions:\nWhich hardware manufacturers are more friendly to Ubuntu, besides Intel?\nDoes 32-bit PAE with more than 4GB RAM improve speed?\nHardware compatibility on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS\nWhat's the difference between Wubi and a regular \"alongside Windows\" installation?\n", "Q: My Computer System Information Heres my System Information.

Please remove any third party packages and try again.\"\n\nIt occured to me that I may had a manually installed version of libreoffice. So I typed the following in terminal\nsudo apt-get remove --purge libreoffice*\n\nsudo apt-get clean\n\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nAnd installed libreoffice by typing the following in terminal\nsudo apt-get install libreoffice\n\nAfter that, I still can't file a bug via ubuntu-bug libreoffice. I get the same message. What can I do now to get a menu in libreoffice (back). How do i remove third party packages, if I do not know them? \n\nA: The easiest way to remove them would be with the synaptic package manager. There you can group the packages by repositories, see where they belong to, and also you can check the configured software sources there. The third party packages are probably installed from some PPAs as dependencies or modules and their name didn't match with libreoffice*.\n", "Q: Menus of LibreOffice cannot be handled with KDE appmenu in Kubuntu 13.04 After installing Kubuntu 13.04, LibreOffice 4.0.2.2 worked, but the menus looked without borders and flat, and if I tried to use appmenu (or appmenu button) the applications were not affected (the ugly menus stayed at the windows). I removed libreoffice-kde and installed libreoffice-gtk, which took care of the menus and now they look quite similar as any other kde app, and, as far as I know, lo-menubar is now part of this package.\nHowever, if I try to use another style for the menu (either \"Title bar button\" or \"Top screen menubar\") Writer, for instance, ends up without any menu at all. I checked and I have installed appmenu-gtk, appmenu-gtk3, appmenu-qt. Should I need to install anything else, or modify any configuration file?\n\nA: Remove libreoffice-gtk and install libreoffice-kde and libreoffice-style-oxygen.\n", "Q: Attempted to install Ubuntu, now I have no boot menu I attempted to install Ubuntu 13.04 onto my secondary hard drive.  I say \"attempted\" because I had to cancel the installation after it hung on \"update-grub\" (or something like that) for two or three hours.  I didn't figure it was ever going to get anything accomplished, so I killed power and turned back on.  Now I get a message at boot that reads,\n\nerror: file '/grub/i386-pc/normal.mod' not found\n\nand gives me a command prompt that I have no idea what to do with.  I have a primary hard drive running Windows 7, and I was attempting to install Ubuntu on a secondary drive within my computer.  The installation should have installed or attempted to install GRUB to my Windows partition, since it's the drive that my computer boots from.\nIn troubleshooting the problem I have attempted the following to no avail:\n\nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt\nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ grub-install /dev/sda --root-directory=/mnt\n\nResulting in the message\n\nPath `/mnt/boot/grub' is not readable by GRUB on boot. Installation is impossible. Aborting.\n\nThat was probably because /sda1 is the Windows 7 partition.  I don't really understand how or where GRUB was actually installed, or how/where I need to try to update it.  So then I tried the linux partition, /sdb1\n\nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo mount /dev/sdb1/ /mnt\nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ grub-install /dev/sda --root-directory=/mnt\n\nWhich returned\n\nrm: cannot remove ‘/mnt/boot/grub/i386-pc/915resolution.mod’: Permission denied\n\nSo now I'm at a loss.  I'm submitting this from the Ubuntu LiveCD as I have no way of logging into either Windows 7 or the Linux partition that may or may not have actually been created - I have no idea at this point, because I haven't been able to try and boot into it.\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: You need to use the GRUB command prompt to boot the installed Ubuntu system first. Read the section \"Booting Ubuntu installed on disk partitions\" on this manual:\nhttp://tuxers.com/main/instigating-a-manual-boot-from-the-grub-prompt/\nBased on your HDD config, I guess your commands should be the following:\nset root=(hd1,msdos1)\nlinux /boot/vmlinux-3.8.0-19-generic ro root=/dev/sdb1\ninitrd /boot/initrd.img-3.8.0-19-generic\nboot\n\nOn the exact filenames, you can always use the [TAB] key.\nUPDATE:\nFollow this procedure to reinstall:\n1. Disconnect the first HDD (Windows)\n2. Install Ubuntu in the usual way\n3. Download and burn the Boot-Repair ISO to a CD.\n4. Reconnect the first drive.\n5. Boot into the Boot-Repair CD and run the recommended repair.\n\n", "Q: Acoustic Guitar how can be connected to Ubuntu and make it sound like Electrical guitar to make metal sounds? I have a Acoustic Guitar, which has audio output jack is there any way i can connect that jack to Ubuntu microphone in and then use some existing software which will make the Guitar sound like metal sounds?\nSomething like using my Ubuntu to replace the need of Electrical guitars? Which tools and how it can be done any guides please?\nFollow up:\n\n1) Download and install \"Rakarrack\"\n- this helps to make guitar to any effects (metal, or anything almost)\n2) Effects sample\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUq49jRBr60\n\n*http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jb7BEsHwLc\n\nA: To do that you need a special Auto card. Such things can be found in music stores. You simply need to chose one that is compatible with Ubuntu. If that is the case, the software distributed with the card should allow to do such things. Some devices are USB connected to PC. Of course you can try to use your built-in audo card, but most probably it won't work as expected - there will be about 1 or 2 seconds of latency between what you play and what you hear.\nExamples of such devices. However this one doesn't work with Linux. At least it is not mentioned.\n\nA: If you want to know wich sound cards are linux compatible (and can provide low latency audio) see that page.\nBut in my opinion it will be hard to have a \"metal\" sound with an acoustic guitar....\nRegards\n\nA: I use a generic USB Guitar Link purchased online for $8.00 US... Yes you can get some pretty heavy sounds from an acoustic/electric guitar using Rakarrack... Not quite the same as you would with regular pickups but not too bad.

For the best/easiest way to remove old kernels, please review the other answers.\n\nOkay, so from the output of /etc/fstab you posted, it seems that your /boot is mounted on a separate partition, and from the output of df -h, that partition is full. This is because there are old kernels installed that are not needed; you can tell that by looking at the output of dpkg -l | grep linux-image that you posted, where you can see more than one \"linux-image\" with different versions. We need to remove the old versions.\nFirst, I want you to run the command uname -r in a terminal, this will show you the kernel version you are currently using. We never want to remove that kernel version. The command will say something like this 3.5.0-26-generic. Take a note of that number, 26! The following commands will assume that that's the kernel you're running.\nThe command to remove an old kernel version is:\nsudo apt-get purge linux-image-x.x.x-xx-generic\n\n...where the x characters are numbers. So, in your case, because you have a lot of old versions (17, 18, 19, etc...), we would have to run this command for each of the versions, like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get purge linux-image-3.5.0-17-generic\n\n*sudo apt-get purge linux-image-3.5.0-18-generic\n\n*sudo apt-get purge linux-image-3.5.0-19-generic\n...and so on. But, there's a way to do all of this through one command. The command is this (DO NOT RUN THE COMMAND YET! Read the following. ):\nsudo apt-get purge linux-image-3.5.0-{17,18,19,21,22,23,24}-generic\n\nThis command will remove the versions mentioned in the brackets. I didn't include versions 25, 26 and 28 because of the following reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Didn't include 26 obviously because that is the kernel version you are currently running! That's the version we got from the command uname -r, remember? We never want to remove that!\n\n*Didn't include 28 because that's the one that your upgrade was trying to upgrade to (you can tell that from the iF status next it, meaning that it's \"half configured\").\n\n*Didn't include 25 because it is usually good practice to leave at least one old version. So since you're running 26, we'll keep 25, so we won't include it in the command above.\n\n\nSo if the last number in uname -r is 26 (or 28, or even 25), then it's safe to run the above command. Enter your password when prompted, and type y when asked. This will show a bunch of lines, and will eventually go back to the command prompt (in your case, matty@matty-G41M-ES2L:~$), hopefully without errors. When it's done, do df -h and look at the last line, the one that starts with /dev/sda1. You should find that it now has more space, and that the percentage used is less than 100% like it was before. You can now proceed with your update again.\n\nA: I was getting this error, this article helped. \nI used df -h to identify that boot was full, uname -r for version, then used the purge string listed above to remove old kernels. single kernel purge worked, multi did not (for me).\nI found the files in the windows thing; I could not delete them, had to use the terminal, but it did show me the old versions I had in there.\nI have no idea why /boot (sda2) is partitioned at all and why its so small. but now I can use Ubuntu updater again.\nI did have some minor success with sudo apt-get update,sudo apt-get upgrade, sudo apt-get clean, also tried free software Bleachbit. Use the purge string but not on your current version. Hope this helps someone. \n\nA: Do you have any old kernel image packages installed, which aren't being used? Those can take up space on /boot. I'd recommend reviewing the set of installed kernel packages with a command such as the following:\ndpkg -l \"linux-image*\" | grep \"^i\"\n\nThat should provide an overview of the set of kernel image packages installed. For those linux-image packages that are not being used and that would not be expected to be needed for recovery purposes -- for example, e.g. I like to keep at least one kernel version behind the active version installed, for recovery -- otherwise, you could remove any such unused packages, using your favorite packaging tool, such as aptitude.\nI'd also recommend taking a look at the related inux-headers, linux-image-extras (if applicable), also linux-source, and linux-tools packages, such that may be installed together with any unused linux-image packages.\n\nA: I doubt many, if any, people will run into this issue but I'm putting it up here for documentation in case anyone needs it.\nMy issue is that I was compiling different custom kernels until I ran out of space. The way I had to clean up the space was to enter each kernel directory I had been working in and run a sudo make clean.\n\n\n*\n\n*$ cd /usr/src Directory where kernel source is\n\n*$ cd linux-image-custom_kernel_name\n\n*$ sudo make clean\n\nA: The answer of marianoju really helped, except that I got an error using apt purge. I couldn't find a force option.\nCombining the lower level dpkg allowed me to proceed:\nsudo dpkg -r $(dpkg -l linux-{image,headers}-\"[0-9]*\" | awk '/ii/{print $2}' \\\n               | grep -ve \"$(uname -r | sed -r 's/-[a-z]+//')\")\n\n\nA: You can try with below command to remove old kernel image packages if you are having those things.\nsudo apt autoremove\n\nAfter that you can able to do update\n", "Q: Screenshot of current window When I select to \"Grab the current window\" using the Screenshot app which comes with Ubuntu, the image is b0rked.  \n\nThe same window captured with \"Select area to grab\" looks normal:\n\nI am using gnome 3 + ubuntu 13.04, on an ASUS zenbook.\n\nA: I just tried, and I couldn't duplicate.

When I do an apt-cache search git\nto see all packages matching git, I see a bunch of packages whose\ndescriptions have nothing to do with git. Why is this so and\nhow can I fix it? (Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS).\nAlso, why is the search functionality found in a command\nthat has \"cache\" in its name? What does search functionality\nhave to do with caches?\nThanks.\n\nA: When you perform an apt-cache search <package name> command, you are performing a query against the information stored on your local machine for available packages. This is the cache from your \"subscribed\" repositories. That is, the command is performing a query against the repositories that you have set up in USC(Ubuntu Software Center) or  Synaptic.\nAccording to the apt-cache man page, /etc/apt/sources.list is the location to fetch information from in the query. There are a couple of additional locations for other types of package information. See man apt-cache for more details.\nEssentially, running apt-cache search git will return all instances of available packages containing the word sequence \"git\" in the package name, as well as in the package description.\nFor example, this means that any package that may contain the word sequence \"git\" in it, like the word \"digital\", in its description will also be returned as a result. Please note the bold in the previous sentence.\nIf you are only interested in packages that are specifically concerned with git - the source control manager, you will need to restrict your query to using a regular expression in order to make the search results more restrictive.\nFor example:\nsudo apt-cache search ^git$\nwill return results that explicitly contain only the phrase \"git\" in the package name.\nFor example:\nsudo apt-cache search ^git$\ngit - fast, scalable, distributed revision control system\n\nThe command:\nsudo apt-cache search ^git\nwill return results for packages which begin with the phrase \"git\":\nFor example:\nsudo apt-cache search ^git\ngit - fast, scalable, distributed revision control system\ngit-core - fast, scalable, distributed revision control system (obsolete)\ngit-doc - fast, scalable, distributed revision control system (documentation)\ngit-man - fast, scalable, distributed revision control system (manual pages)\ngitk - fast, scalable, distributed revision control system (revision tree visualizer)\neasygit - git for mere mortals\ngforge-plugin-scmgit - Git plugin for FusionForge (transitional package)\ngit-all - fast, scalable, distributed revision control system (all subpackages)\ngit-annex - manage files with git, without checking their contents into git\ngit-arch - fast, scalable, distributed revision control system (arch interoperability)\n...\n\nThat said, you will need to tune your queries of the package cache to be more specific to your interest. Hope this helps.\n\nA: If you want only to search by name, use the --names-only argument. For more information, read the man apt-cache, it would be useful.\n\nA: This is an indirect answer to your question but still related to it since it's about package management. I personally use aptitude instead of apt-get. aptitude is the synaptic equivalent to terminal.\nTo search,\nsudo aptitude search $keyword\n\nOther commands\nsudo aptitude install\nsudo aptitude update\nsudo aptitude upgrade\n\nTo install aptitude,\nsudo apt-get install aptitude\n\n\nA: Install apt-xapian-index and use axi-cache search when searching instead of apt--cache.

Additionally, when not running in an interactive login shell, .profile won't be read either.\n\nA: echo $0\n\nwill return the script name which is being executed, when this command is executed within a shell script.

A profile is a list of configuration databases.\nOn startup, dconf consults the DCONF_PROFILE environment variable. If set, dconf will attempt to open the named profile, aborting if that fails. If the environment variable is not set, dconf will attempt to open the profile named \"user\" and if that fails, it will fall back to an internal hard-wired configuration.\nIn your configuration the profile is called \"local\". You can set the DCONF_PROFILE environment variable export by:\nexport DCONF_PROFILE=local \n\nThe variable should be set before dconf started, so you can put this line for example in /etc/profile...\n\nA: The path depend on dconf used profile, AFAIK Ubuntu share same profile as Gnome (named gdm)\nCheck more /etc/dconf/profile/*\nuser-db:user\nsystem-db:gdm\n\nThen put user locks in folder with same name as system-db:\n/etc/dconf/db/gdm.d/locks/00-my-locks\n\nExample used from default setup:\n$ cat /etc/dconf/db/gdm.d/locks/00-upstream-settings-locks \n/org/gnome/desktop/a11y/keyboard/enable\n/org/gnome/desktop/background/show-desktop-icons\n/org/gnome/desktop/lockdown/disable-application-handlers\n/org/gnome/desktop/lockdown/disable-command-line\n/org/gnome/desktop/lockdown/disable-lock-screen\n/org/gnome/desktop/lockdown/disable-log-out\n/org/gnome/desktop/lockdown/disable-printing\n/org/gnome/desktop/lockdown/disable-print-setup\n/org/gnome/desktop/lockdown/disable-save-to-disk\n/org/gnome/desktop/lockdown/disable-user-switching\n...\n\n", "Q: Copy paste not working on ubuntu putty I have been using putty to connect to one of my client server,here the problem is that copy and paste doesn't work.

And it's always a good idea to be familiar with basic command line operations. Personally I prefer a hybrid approach and I try using mc (midnight commander) when it's available.\nsudo apt-get install mc\n\nwill get it for you. Surviving tyrannosaurs like me might notice the resemblance with Norton commander from the DOS days. Its operation is quite intuitive. You have two panels. You switch between them with TAB. There are Fn key shortcuts for basic operations, like view, edit, copy, move, rename, delete, etc.\n\nIn your case, all you have to do is type mc in your terminal window and navigate to Parent folder in one panel, child folder on the other. Then select parent panel and press + and then enter. This will select all files and folders in the panel. With arrow keys go on top of Child1 folder and press Ins key. This will de-select that folder (Ins key toggles select status of an item.) Now press F5 and all selected content will be copied to the other panel (which is inside Child1 folder.)\nI am providing this information only for the sake of completeness and to further demonstrate the variety of solutions available. By all means, go on and learn the basic linux commands and their variations. You can always rely on them being available at your fingertip on any system. \n\nA: Try :\ncd [WhereeverParentLies]\ncp ./* ./Child1/\nThere will be a message that cp omitted the \"Child1\" directory.\n\nA: Less elegant than extglob, but also works...\nmkdir -p Child1; for i in ./*; do [[ \"$i\" != ./Child1 ]] && echo cp -vr \"$i\" Child; done\ncp -vr ./file1 Child1\ncp -vr ./file100 Child1\ncp -vr ./Folder2 Child1\ncp -vr ./Folder3 Child1\n\nRemove echo after testing to actually move the files. If you have hidden files and want to include them, first run shopt -s dotglob.\nAs a script (again, you need to remove echo to actually move files):\n#!/bin/bash\n\nmkdir -p Child1                    # create Child1 if it does not exist\nfor i in ./*; do                   # act on all the files in the current directory \n   [[ \"$i\" != ./Child1 ]] &&       # if the file is not Child1 itself\n   echo cp -vr \"$i\" Child1         # move the file into Child1\ndone\n\n\nA: rsync has an option to exclude files or directories using --exclude option.\nSo in this case I think rsync would be a nice choice.\nmkdir -p Child1; rsync -av --progress ./* Child1 --exclude Child1\n\n\nA: If the files are actually called 'file1' etc., you can do this:\ncd Parent\ncp file* Child1/\n\nOtherwise you'll have to list the files in the cp command.\n\nA: The simplest way is to move the Child1 directory elsewhere, temporarily:\ncd Parent\nmv Child1 ..\nmv * ../Child1\nmv ../Child1 .\n\n\nA: You can use ls to list the contents of \"Parent\",\npipe the result to grep -v to filter out \"Child1\",\nand then send the resulting list to cp.\nThis should do the trick: (from within the \"Parent\" dir)\ncp `ls | grep -v '^Child1$'` Child1\n\nA: find Parent/ -maxdepth 1 -type f | xargs cp -t Parent/Child/\n\nThis finds all files (excluding directory) inside your Parent/ directory and copies each of those files to Parent/Child\nfind\n\n    -type f match file only\n    -maxdepth 1 find only in the Parent/ directory, do not find in directories inside Parent\n\ncp\n\n    -t target the directory where you want to copy the files\n\n", "Q: How do I set up a localhost website?

That's how it should work.\nThe cd in .bashrc will only work if you run a gnome-terminal not from the context option you mentioned.\nAs a solution to your problem, you can add an alias to cd to the directory that you want.

Surfing in the internet I saw that it is possible to upgrade Ubuntu to Ubuntu Studio. The question is: doing the update, will I lose the current Ubuntu 13.04 OS?\nFor example, when installing gnome-desktop on unity, you have the possibility of choosing between the two of them when booting the system.\nIs it the same in this case? If I upgrade to Ubuntu Studio installing ubuntustudio-desktop, the proper packages and the proper low-latency kernel, will I still have the possibility of choosing between GNOME, Unity and Ubuntu Studio during the boot?\n\nA: Ubuntu Studio, like all flavors of Ubuntu (including Ubuntu itself) have all their packages in the same repositories, so you can install them on top of each other. \nThere is no need however, to install the Ubuntu Studio desktop, unless you want.\nTo prepare Ubuntu for pro audio, this is all you need to do:\nsudo apt-get install ubuntustudio-audio linux-lowlatency\n\nMake sure to answer \"yes\", when asked about realtime privilege, while installing jackd. If you already installed it, make sure the file /etc/security/limits.d/audio.conf is not named /etc/security/limits.d/audio.conf.disabled. If so, rename it to the former.\nFinally, in order to get the benfit of realtime privilege on Ubuntu, you need to add yourself to audio group. In a terminal:\nsudo usermod -a -G audio $USER\n\nIf you also would like to try the Ubuntu Studio desktop, install it as well (it has a custom menu that you might find useful):\nsudo apt-get install ubuntustudio-desktop\n\nIt won't replace Unity. When logging in, click the CoF button (the icon) to choose which desktop environment to login to.\nReboot. Make sure you boot into the lowlatency kernel.

It uses the system settings for proxy on Windows. You can change these settings inside Internet Explorer preferences, or in the Control Panel for Internet, I believe.\n", "Q: Cannot access PPA I know there already exits a post on this (Cannot access PPA... please check your internet connection) which doesn't answer my problem.\nI was trying to download TLP on Ubuntu-13.04 and I got the following errors while adding a PPA:\nroyal@royal-Vostro-3550:~$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:linrunner/tlp  \nCannot access PPA (https://launchpad.net/api/1.0/~linrunner/+archive/tlp) to get PPA information, please check your internet connection.\n\n\nA: To add it, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal.

There are still some issues with these (eg. baseline alignment).  Would you be willing to help test them at some point during the next month?  This is Arabic ''script'' (Urdu/Farsi/… and not purely Arabic).\n\nA: Yes, progress has stalled.\nPaul Sladen has summed it up nicely, so I’ll just quote him:\n\nQuite a lot of this is hinging (waiting) on me.

Does this point to a problem with hardware i.e. the switch or is this problem known in \"raring ringtail\".\nThanks for the help in advance!\n\nA: For the distro to have such a low level issue would be impossible as you would see this forum go wild.\nSo now you need to fault find.\nBest option is to use the IP address instead of the hostname. That way you will rule out any DNS issues or DHCP issues that don't pass the DNS servers correctly.\nIf you consistently connect when you use an IP address it rules out router, hardware issues. Although the issue might be your computer.\nCheck your logs for any errors.

The line setting DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS in klrmr's response above is the modification that finally got the warnings working correctly.\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# if virtual machine is running, monitor power consumption\nif pgrep -x vmware-vmx; then\n  bat_path=\"/sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/\"\n  if [ -e \"$bat_path\" ]; then\n    bat_status=$(cat $bat_path/status)\n    if [ \"$bat_status\" == \"Discharging\" ]; then\n      bat_current=$(cat $bat_path/capacity)\n      # halt vm if critical; notify if low\n      if [ \"$bat_current\" -lt 10 ]; then\n        /path/to/vm/shutdown/script\n        echo \"$( date +%Y.%m.%d_%T )\" >> \"/home/user/Desktop/VM Halt Low Battery\"\n        elif [ \"$bat_current\" -lt 15 ]; then\n            eval \"export $(egrep -z DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS /proc/$(pgrep -u $LOGNAME gnome-session)/environ)\";\n            notify-send -i \"/usr/share/icons/ubuntu-mono-light/status/24/battery-caution.svg\"  \"Virtual machine will halt when battery falls below 10% charge.\"\n      fi\n    fi\n  fi\nfi\n\nexit 0\n\n\nA: In my case with ubuntu 16.04 any explicit path was required, I solve the problem just adding \n\nDISPLAY=:0\n\nat firsts lines of the crontab, before call notify-send. \n\nA: Things seem to be different on 13.04, at least in Gnome Shell.\nFirst, this is what env prints when run from user zzyxy's (not root's) cron job:\nHOME=/home/zzyxy\nLOGNAME=zzyxy\nPATH=/usr/bin:/bin\nXDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/zzyxy\nLANG=en_US.UTF-8\nSHELL=/bin/sh\nPWD=/home/zzyxy\n\nTo get notify-send to work, it seems to be necessary to set the DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS environment variable, as per DahitiF's comment on ubuntuforums.org. Just prepend the following to your actual job description:\neval \"export $(egrep -z DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS /proc/$(pgrep -u $LOGNAME gnome-session)/environ)\";\n\nIt doesn't seem to be necessary to set DISPLAY.\n\nA: Command notify-send would not show the message on your screen when started by cron.\nJust add target display at the top of your script, for example:\nexport DISPLAY=:0\n\n\nA: Commands need to reference their location.

It turned out that now the display coordinates changed, it's now :1.

A fish variable does not extract the two paths, but stores the whole string, causing conflicts when using cat $environs. Using a while loop that appends the paths to the variable achieves the intended.\n\nA: In my case, the issue was with using root user with notify-send. I realized this when I saw that sudo notify-send didn't work on the terminal but just notify-send (i.e. with current user) did.\nSo instead of editing the usual /etc/crontab which is used by root, I had a custom cron script created for  myusername.
