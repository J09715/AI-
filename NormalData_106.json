["Q: How can I get back the Sound-Menu integration for music players in Gnome classic? I have just upgraded to oneiric (11.10) from natty.\nIn Unity-2D sessions, the sound-menu integration lets me control Banshee (and maybe Clementine too).\nIn Gnome Classic sessions however, it's gone. Is there a way to get it back ?\n\nA: By default in 11.10, gnome-classic uses the standard Gnome-Applets.  Unity and Unity-2D uses the indicator-applet.\nNote - in 12.04, the indicator-applet is installed by default when installing gnome-classic.\nYou should install the indicator-applet as per the linked Q&A - the same sound indicator should then be available for you to use.\n\n", "Q: Can't install Xubuntu with unetbootin from hardrive I have no dvd or usb and I'm trying to install Xubuntu with unetbootin from hardrive.

I run a bleeding-edge VM as bug reporting is about the only 'give back' activity that I have time to do.\nI am however getting sick of things (understandably) crashing, only to be told 'Nope, we already fixed that yesterday, your packages are all old'.\nHas anyone come across an invisible way to update && upgrade on boot? (i.e not login)\n\nA: Thanks so much for taking the time to find and report bugs in Ubuntu. It helps quite a bit. As you mention, during the development cycle things move very quickly and bugs are fixed on a daily basis. What we usually advise people to do is search for duplicates first; check if someone has already reported the bug you're observing before committing to filing a new one.\nThat said, you could create an upstart job to do apt-get update; apt-get -y dist-upgrade on boot (that is, if you don't mind upgrades potentially breaking your VM and/or leaving it in an unbootable state).\nHere's a quick upstart primer:\nhttp://upstart.ubuntu.com/getting-started.html\n\nA: I understand what you are wanting to accomplish, but, IMO, this is not really a boot script, rather a question of how to automate updates.\nI would configure automatic updates either in synatpic (graphical) or with unattended-upgrades (command line).\nYou may need to install synaptic\nsudo apt-get install synaptic\n\nThen configure automatic updates under the Updates tab\nIf you want it to automatically install these updates without notifying you,  check Install security updates without confirmation option. I believe this will install all updates from all repositories you have selected, and not just security only (it did last I looked).\n\nTo do this from the command line, install unattended-upgrades\nsudo apt-get install unattended-upgrades\n\nunattended-upgrades is intended for security updates on servers, but can be configured to your needs\nEdit /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades\n# command line\nsudo -e /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades\n\n# graphical\ngksu gedit /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades\n\nAnd add in the repositories you want to use for your upgrades.\nFor details see Ubuntu Server Guide Unattended Upgrades\nWhen using your machine, if you find a bug, confirm you are up to date and search for duplicate bug reports as advised above.\n", "Q: Problem installing Ubuntu on UX21 When trying install Ubuntu on Zenbook UX21 I always get same problem - after choosing installing Ubuntu, screen become black and installation doesnt progress.

You can in particular try noapic and nomodeset, they may help on your system.\nAlternatively, you could try the \"alternate\" installer, it has a better chance of working if the problem with your system is display-related. Be warned, however, that the alternate installer is text-based and is a bit more difficult to use than the standard installation.

I noticed yesterday that Ubuntu One is not syncing some of my bip logs, but is syncing others.  It appears that Ubuntu One is ignoring certain files because they start with a # sign.  \nHow can I modify what files Ubuntu One sync vs ignores?\n\nA: The default ignored is defined in /etc/xdg/ubuntuone/syncdaemon.conf:\nignore.default = \\A#.*\\Z                                                        \n                 \\A.*~\\Z                                                        \n                 \\A.*\\.py[oc]\\Z                                                 \n                 \\A.*\\.sw[nopx]\\Z                                               \n                 \\A.*\\.swpx\\Z                                                   \n                 \\A\\..*\\.tmp\\Z                                                  \n                 \\A\\.~lock\\..*#\\Z\n\nIf you want to change it, edit or create the file ~/.config/ubuntuone/syncdaemon.conf to define your own ignore list. In the case you just want to allow the synchronization of files and folders starting with a #, copy the default list but remove the first regular expression:\n[__main__]\nignore = \\A.*~\\Z\n         \\A.*\\.py[oc]\\Z\n         \\A.*\\.sw[nopx]\\Z\n         \\A.*\\.swpx\\Z\n         \\A\\..*\\.tmp\\Z\n\nThen, restart syncdaemon with:\nu1sdtool -q; u1sdtool -c\n\n\nA: After talking to some people on IRC, I found a solution to this problem.\nUbuntuOne ignores certain files based on patterns stored in /etc/xdg/ubuntuone/syncdaemon.conf.  \nLook at the section called ignore.default.  The patterns here are Python, not bash regex expressions, so if you're not familiar with them, you should be careful modifying them.  I'd recommend backing up this file first.  You need to use sudo to edit this file.\nI used this tool, the Python Regex Tool to test my changes.  In my case, I removed the first expression \\A#.*\\Z and my files with names that started with # were synced.\nAfter modifying the file, I disconnected, quit, started, and reconnected the syncdaemon as follows:\nu1sdtool -d\nu1sdtool -q\nu1sdtool --start\nu1sdtool -c\n\n", "Q: automatic installation error I have a ubuntu orchestra server setup and I'm trying to install some desktop ubuntus across the network.

Switched to gnome classic so I can get the normal menu, hovered over the desired action pressed the desired keys but nothing happened (restarted nautilus, re-logged and nothing).\nAny suggestions or ideas on how to assign custom shortcuts to actions in Nautilus 3\n\nA: I use a little extended workaround.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open dconf-editor.

I had to install dconf-editor, which if I remember correctly, comes with the dconf-tools package. Also, the killall nautilus ... command did not appear to be necessary.\nSo, once you've got dconf-editor, run it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to org/gnome/desktop/interface.\n\n*Check the box for can-change-accels.\n\n*Open Nautilus and highlight the menu item whose key binding you want to change, either with your mouse or via the keyboard, and press the key(s) you want to use as the shortcut.\n\n*Don't forget to uncheck can-change-accels in dconf-editor after you're done.\n\n\nA: Checkout this answer, \"Another way to define arbitrary hot keys\" . \nI downloaded that python script from here(git repo) and changed the keyboard settings to my liking (I don't like overriding F6 , F5 and Ctrl + O as the author has done in his proof of concept).\nThis is the only thing that is working for me in Nautilus, as far as changing/adding keyboard shortcuts is concerned. dconf-editor or gconf-editor change accel just doesn't work.\nI am on Ubuntu Unity and not using Gnome Classic etc, and I hope you too are on the same boat. Of course, I have installed a bunch of stuff on top of that ( protoiyer.github.com \"Setting up my linux box and ruby on rails\" ) to tweak Ubuntu/Unity, and so not sure whether any of it is screwing up with the dconf-editor setting.\nIt would be great if we can understand why it is working for @wim :).\n\nA: Since 3.15 it is not possible to use the accel file anymore, but it is possible to rebind keys by utilizing python-nautilus.

Why is the Java Development Environment for Emacs package in the multiverse repository? The software is available under the GPL.\n\nA: The jde package is in multiverse because historically, it required a non-free version of Java to work.  Software that's available under a free license, but requires non-free software to work, is shipped in \"contrib\" in Debian, which maps to \"multiverse\" in Ubuntu.\nIt looks like jde no longer requires the non-free Java to work, so on that basis it could be moved to universe.  Unfortunately, the package is also unmaintained in Debian, with the result that it depends on a number of other packages that are free but have been removed from the latest releases of Debian and Ubuntu (cedet-contrib, cogre, eieio, semantic, speedbar).  This is documented as Debian bug #620341, which has remained unaddressed for half a year.\nAs long as the package is uninstallable there probably isn't any point to moving it to universe; but if you want this to be changed you can file a bug in Launchpad against the jde package and subscribe the ubuntu-archive team to the bug.\n", "Q: Proposal to update from 11.04 to 11.10 is not shown \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I upgrade from 11.04 to 11.10? \n\nI'm trying to update my Ubuntu from 11.04 version.

I use a 1Gb ATI HD Radeon Graphic card on a Dell Laptop \nI'm still a newbee at this; But from my understanding, the latest Ubuntu does not use X.org anymore, but uses Wayland. And the fglrx (both the one provided by canonical, and the one you can download from the amd site itslef) are used for X.org. I've managed to get both of them working in the latest Ubuntu (since the GL Billards game seems to work fine). But shouldn't there specifically be a Wayland ATI Driver?\n\nA: Ubuntu still uses X.org (and will do so in 12.04, too).\n\nA: As said here, NVIDIA has stated they do not currently plan on supporting Wayland, and I'd suspect ATI to have a similar stance even if they have not made an announcement about it. Wayland is still well off in the future at this point, and it would take the proprietary graphics vendors a while to rewrite their drivers to support a brand-new display manager for an OS that doesn't have a lot of market share yet.\nI don't know how current open-source driver support is for Wayland, but I think it'd be safe to assume that an open-source Wayland driver will appear much sooner than a proprietary one.\n\nA: I can understand you confusion due to recent news items etc, but Ubuntu does not use Wayland yet, and probably will not for a while.\nThat being said, the way how wayland is built, there will probably not be a need for a specific \"wayland\" driver.\n", "Q: Recursive HTML to PDF I have a folder with this structure:\n/main-folder\n /index.html\n /subfolder1\n    /index1.html\n    /file1.html\n\nwith many sub folder and only html files... i want to convert all them to pdf using only one command or a simple script that doesn't require all file names.\nDo you know one\n\nA: The following command should do the job for one link:\ngnome-web-print http://www.ubuntu.com ubuntu.pdf\n\nFor multiple links, it shouldn't be difficult to write a loop that handles each link one by one.\n\nA: I would suggest installing the WKHtmlToPDF tool from http://wkhtmltopdf.org/ (moved from: http://code.google.com/p/wkhtmltopdf/).\nYou can then change to the root folder and use find and xargs to convert them:\ncd /main-folder\nfind . -name \\*.html | sed 's/.html$//g' | xargs -n 1 --replace=X wkhtmltopdf X.html X.pdf\n\nThis will then build a PDF with each HTML file.\n", "Q: How can I stop Gnome Shell's drive pop up notifications?

I have an issue, not necessarily a problem. I have a disk, which had Ubuntu 11.04, a swap, a big NTFS and some free space. When 11.10 came out, I did a fresh install and recently I've deleted the 11.04 partition since I didn't needed it anymore. I've noticed that my partition table is a little bit messy. Especially that I seem to have 2 primary empty partitions at the beginning and end of the partition table and my swap /dev/sdb5 seems to reside in an extended container /dev/sdb2 (probably old swap from 11.04). \nHere is a screenshot from GParted:\n\nAny way I could make some order in here?\n\nA: First I advise you manage your partitions from a live CD.\nSecond, before you start, check fstab and make sure all your partition enteries are by UUID\nUUID=dccc7153-df39-4b3c-b707-b42f2e3a5421  /  ext4   errors=remount-ro  0  1\n\nFSTAB will also tell you what partitions are in use. If you need a list of partitions by uuid use\nsudo blkid\n\n1) Boot the desktop CD and unmount all your hard drive partitions and swap (you can do this in gparted).\n2) Delete any unwanted partitions -> apply changes.\n3) Resize your partitions one at at time.\n4) Fix your partition table (order) with fdisk\nsudo fdisk /dev/sda\n\nAt the fdisk prompt type the following commands\n# Extra functionality\nx\n\n# Fix partition order\nf\n\n# Write changes to disk\nw\n\n# Quit fdisk\nq\n\nReboot and your partitions should look much better.\nNote - You really do not need to \"fix\" this \"problem\" , but it will not hurt to fix either.    \n\nA: There is no such thing as a primary empty partition; unpartitioned space is just space that does not belong to any partition.  Also, logical partitions always reside in an extended container.\nOne thing you could do to clean things up is to move the big NTFS partition all the way to the left and your Linux partitions to the end of the disk.  If you decide to do this, you should just delete the swap partition and the extended partition that contains it to make way for the NTFS partition to move over, then you can create a new swap partition at the end of the disk later ( if you even want to have swap -- it really isn't needed if you have more than one or two GB of ram ).  After modifying the swap partitions, you will need to update /etc/fstab to either remove the swap entry or point it to the new UUID.  You can find the uuid and then edit the file with:\nsudo blkid\ngksu gedit /etc/fstab\n\nNote that moving that huge NTFS partition will take AGES (like 12-24 hours), so I wouldn't suggest it.\nInstead, I would suggest that you just ignore the free space at the start of the disk for the time being, and maybe expand the ext4 partition so it uses the remaining free space at the end of the disk.  Moving the end of the partition to the right doesn't take very long and will give you more usable space in Ubuntu.  In order to do this, you will have to run gparted from the livecd as the partition can not be in use to expand it ( for now, gparted should be gaining this ability soon ).\n", "Q: Samba share read only for guests, read write for authenticated users Is it possible to have a samba share read only for guests, and read write for authenticated users? \nIf I put guest ok on an share then I am not prompted for a password, and effectively logged as guest with read only rights.

The XAMPP-package (1.7.7) for Linux doesn't have Sendmail integrated though. So after googling around a little I found out that Postfix fits better into a LAMPP-environment.\n\nWhat I have tried so far:\nI've installed Postfix and wanted to configure it to just use the smtp-server of my private eMail provider (like it did on Windows). So I've confogured my php.ini like this:\n[mail function]\n; For Win32 only.\n;SMTP = localhost\n;smtp_port = 25\n\n; For Win32 only.\n;sendmail_from = me@example.com\n\nsendmail_path = /etc/postfix\nmail.add_x_header = On\n\nNote that I've commented out the \"Win32 only\"-stuff. The /etc/postfix/main.cf Looks like this:\nsmtp_sasl_auth_enable = yes\nsmtp_sasl_security_options = noanonymous\nsmtp_sasl_password_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/sasl_password\nmyhostname = ubuntu\nalias_maps = hash:/etc/aliases\nalias_database = hash:/etc/aliases\nsender_canonical_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/sender_canonical\nmydestination = ubuntu, localhost.localdomain, localhost\nrelayhost = mail.gmx.net\nmynetworks = 127.0.0.0/8 [::ffff:127.0.0.0]/104 [::1]/128\nmailbox_size_limit = 0\nrecipient_delimiter = +\ninet_interfaces = loopback-only\n\n/etc/aliases is unchanged:\n# Required aliases\npostmaster: root\nMAILER-DAEMON:  postmaster\n\n# Common aliases\nabuse:      postmaster\nspam:       postmaster\n\n/etc/postfix/sasl_password:\nmy.providers.smtp my_login:my_password\n\n/etc/postfic/sender_canonical:\npostmaster my.email@ddress.com\n\n\nWhat happens:\nSo when I do \n> sudo /etc/init.d/postfix start\n\neverything seems to work fine and the /var/log/mail.log says: \"ubuntu postfix/master[9720]: daemon started -- version 2.8.5, configuration /etc/postfix\"\nBut when I run my PHP-script (which worked fine with Windows and Sendmail), it just runs through and nothing happens, not even an error is logged.\n\nWhat I actually want to achieve:\nI'm working locally on an e-commerce website. It runs fine on the dedicated webserver, but I want to also have it running locally for obvious reasons. In some cases, it sends emails, and I just want to be able to receive them with Thunderbird or in any other way. Is using Postfix overkill here? I don't need to receive emails - I just want to make the sent mails visible somehow. I could not seem to find any helpful step-by-step-tutorials for this issue (neither concerning Senmail nor Postfix - but, to be honest, I'm very new to Linux).\n\nA: In your php.ini, this:\nsendmail_path = /etc/postfix\n\nShould be the path to the sendmail (or compatible) binary.\nYou've set it to the configuration directory of postfix which isn't right.\nFor historical reasons, usually /usr/bin/sendmail is maintained as a compatibility link.\nsendmail was around first (I guess) and pretty much everything just assumes it is in the installed MTA. So when it isn't, the replacement makes a symlink so that nothing breaks.\n\nA: To send mail from localhost (WAMP, XAMP, or LAMP) you can use PHPMailer package\n\n\n*\n\n*Click here to download from github https://github.com/shashidhark/PhpMailer and\nFollow the instruction given in the readme file.\n\n\nThis will be same instruction given in readme file..\nWAMP (windows):\nFirst you have to edit the \"php.ini\"\nTo find this file display the phpinfo by using following code from the WAMP server.\nCreate one php file [setting.php] inside C:/wamp/www/ and add the following content to that file.\n<?php\n     echo phpinfo();\n?>\n\nType localhost/setting.php at browser.\nThere search for \"Loaded Configuration File\" That will be the path to your php.ini.\nIn php.ini file remove the ;(semi colon) given to `extension=php_openssl.dll.\nNow server setting is over...\n\n\n*\n\n*After downloading PHPMailer folder from github,\n\n*Extract->Copy the full folder into your project folder i.e C:/wamp/www/\n\n*Find the index.php file.\n\n*Change the parameter as your need.\n\n*Then in the browser type localhost/PHPMailer/index.php. \n\n*Then it will show successful message if email sent, else it will give error message.\n\n\nLAMP (Linux):\n\n\n*\n\n*In case of linux, There is no need to edit the php.ini file as i\nexplained first point under WAMP.\n\n*One more change is project or Document root folder is different.\n\n*In Linux the default Document root folder will be /var/www\n\n*You can change the Document root folder easily. For that visit https://stackoverflow.com/a/17612396/1925943\n\n*Copy the PhpMailer to this document root folder and edit index.php as your need.\n\n*Then type localhost/PhpMailer/index.php in browser.\n\n\nA: To send email (with sendmail package) through Gmail from localhost please check PHP+Ubuntu Send email using gmail form localhost is possible another answer.\n", "Q: 64 bit version of boinc client requires X while 32 bit version does not?

I think it would be great it I could control the sound balance by placing a window in different places on my desktop.

Simultaneously, I could be playing a game on the right-hand side that I'd hear through the right speaker. Is there anything I can do to get this behaviour?\n\nA: This is not supported by any system I know of.\nBut it wouldn't be that hard to do but it would require being able to match up mixer inputs with the windows that they appear to come from (this requirement is the hard part.) and then looking up the location of the window for an input and modifying the mixer balance for that input accordingly. \nUsing X11 state change notification, it would be possible to update the balance for an input in realtime without polling the window locations.\n", "Q: Why did my install all of a sudden get really slow?

My GUI has changed into some crappy looking theme, I don't know why it happened and I want to get the default looks back!\n\nIt happened after I was mucking around trying to get the purple grub menu splash to go away, so that I could see dmesg during boot, and I followed the instructions in this accepted answer to do sudo apt-get remove plymouth-theme-* and reboot.  Unfortunately, now I've got an ugly Gnome and ironically the bootloader splash screen remained anyway.  \n\nOf course I first tried sudo apt-get install plymouth-theme-ubuntu-logo plymouth-theme-ubuntu-text, which were the two that got removed by the previous step, but even after reboot it was still the ugly gnome.\nNext I tried gnome-tweak-tool but it was all set to ambiance theme which should be correct.

This was regenerated again after the next reboot, with the default window and icons themes coming back.  \nNote: I also lost a few minor customisations I'd made, and had to redo them again manually.  \n\nA: Today I felt the same anger, but after seeking in dconf-editor, I found a solution (without deleting any config files from your home dir!!!)\nIf the gnome-settings-daemon running, start the dconf-editor and in the settings tree (left side of the window) look for the org -> gnome -> settings-daemon -> plugins.\nThere are the key on/off switches, so go through on the topics, and put the pipes to the \"active\" boolean options. For example, my gtk-theme settings didn't do anything until I set the org->gnome->settings-daemon->plugins->xsettings->active to True!!! Also important the 'font', 'media-keys' (for laptop spec keys), etc. Where the default settings is 'True', there should it set to it.\nHope it'll works for the same victims (without erase the settings files and start anything from the beginning).

However, after a while or with some open applications, 2D-scrolling performance degrades heavily. Scrolling through a 800-line text file takes half a minute, with frequent freezes in the process, rendering any text editing mostly unusable for me. \nInterestingly, I can run two full screen HD videos with both the videos and text scrolling in Geany seemingly unaffected. On the other hand, as soon as I open any another application that involves 2D-scrolling (browser, terminal, text editor,...), it gets all incredibly jerky and laggy - only the scrolling, general performance is still acceptable.\nIn unity-2D, things are ok so I guess the culprit may be Compiz. Is this a bug or just expected on a not-high-end graphics card? I don't expect silky-smoothness here but, seriously, no usable text-scrolling?\n\nA: I get the same issue. If you use NVidia drivers, there are issues with performance when using the NVidia graphics card.

Everything works now. \n\n\nA: I had an Ipod long time ago and it had two modes. Itune and mass storage. I don't know if ubuntu can recognize the \"itune mode\".\nTry to switch it with itune on another computer.\n\nA: I've had this happen a few times on my iPod shuffle, and in all cases it was solved by resetting the device.  Apple maintains a page for how to do this here: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1320\n", "Q: How does the Ubuntu license work for commercial use? Do we have to follow the LGPL or the GPL? I have an Ubuntu computer. Once Ubuntu starts I use my applications, such as: driving school exams, learning, practical use, and studying. \nNow, I am preparing license documentation. If I use Ubuntu commercially, what license do I have to apply?\n\n\n*\n\n*I have not changed any of Ubuntu's source code.\n\n*I've installed Ubuntu and I use for commercial purposes.\n\n*My Ubuntu installation will be used for teaching driving in Europe.\n\n*When Ubuntu starts, it starts my application to teach drivers and give them exams and practice. They can also return the box for new exams and updates. \n\n\nWhat happens for with regard to the license terms when I sell such PCs with embedded Ubuntu and my application pre-installed? (They use x11vnc, vim, gcc, etc. and many other tools but no source code is modified. I wrote my application in BASH, PHP, and Java)\n\nA: Ubuntu has no one license - every file may have a different license.\nThat shouldn't be a problem for you as long as you don't (re)distribute the files. As long as the binaries are supplied by Ubuntu (Canonical) the license conditions apply to them, not you.\nI am not a lawyer, so I couldn't comment on what happens when you simply pass along the files, but I suggest you either do find the legal answer to that, or else have your customers install the OS themselves.\nIn the case of GPL and LGPL software, your obligations include providing an offer to produce source code when asked (for a limited time). In practice, it would be sufficient to point your customers at the Ubuntu source provisions, but to be absolutely sure, you would have to ensure that you had your own copy (I mean, what happens if Ubuntu's servers vanished? Also, remember that their time limit dates from when they gave the files to you, but yours would date from when you passed them along, some time later.)\n\nA: looking here \nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/project/about-ubuntu/licensing \n", "Q: What's up with the Fontmatrix project? I'm quite fond of Fontmatrix, but it seems to be \"dead\" - at least the site of the project is down. Does anyone have information about that, or a possible fork that I should start to use etc.?\n\nA: In short, what happened is that Pierre had to take other responsibilities, and since he was pretty much the only person who wrote code, the work on the project stopped.\nIt looks like I'm the only Fontmatrix team member left, so I took responsibility to move the development to Github:\nhttps://github.com/fontmatrix/fontmatrix\nThere's not much happening right now, as I have very little development skills. We'll see what happens next.\nThere are still some things to do before a new release can happen: finalizing the UI update, fixing opentype shaping bugs etc.\n\nA: Check out https://www.ohloh.net/p/fontmatrix for a quick overview of how development is proceeding. Looks like it is still moving but has slowed down in the last couple of years. Perhaps that's just because it's got a fairly simple aim, and development is more or less \"finished\"?\n\nA: The problem is that it was once a fully-functional piece of software, and now the repos for newer versions of Ubuntu (and Mint, and similar distros) is unfinished and barely functional.\nHere's how to get the 'full' version of FontMatrix: first go here and get libicu44. Then get fontmatrix_0.6.0+svn20100107-2ubuntu4_i386.deb. Now you will have the old, fully-functional version.\n\nA: Fontmatrix \n is a font manager built with the kind of features and abilities graphic designers, layout pros, and others have felt necessary, but modernized with some new touches.\nIt is in the ubuntu repro you can search fontmatrix in ubuntu software center.\nFontmatrix Launchpad page\nFontmatrix available in all kind of ubuntu\n", "Q: Screen tearing while watching video I have a bad tearing while watching video in Ubuntu 11.10. I tried to use both smplayer and vlc, but none of them helped. In fact I see tearing only in rips, there is not such problem while watching Blu-ray movies. Though maybe i'm just not very attentive. Can anybody help me with this? I have 32-bit version of Ubuntu. Videocard is GTX460 768mb.\nI use hardware acceleration in players (vdpau). Enabling vsync in CCSM doesn't help.\n\nA: I've found that 'Force full screen redraws (buffer swap) on repaint' works for me. Nvidia version 295.49 in ubuntu 12.04 stills seems a little jerky to me though.\n\nA: Yes I finally have a solution for you it took a bit of digging, you have to use CompizConfig Settings Manager.  Go to Utilty > Workarounds, make sure this box is checked:\n\nAlso should be checked:\n\n\n*\n\n*\"Don't wait for video sync\"\n\n*\"Force full screen redraws\"\n \nAlso some other this you could do is in the CCSM go to \"OpenGL\" click on the texture tab put Best:\n\nThen go to \"Composite\" and uncheck \"detect rate\" then crank up the refresh rate to anything higher than it's default that is set at 50 I set mine to anything beyond 60. \n problems.

They don't quite explain how to do this for newbies to LINUX at all, the writers expect every one just to know how to do this because they think everyone is a programmer. \nThis little patch should take care of everything. One last thing: please restart your computer and then play your movie or youtube vide.\n", "Q: What is debugging and how do I get involved? Well what is it? And how do I get involved?\n\nA: Debugging is a methodical process of finding and reducing the number of bugs, or defects, in a computer program\nThe Ubuntu QA team \"is focused on developing tools, policies, and practices for ensuring Ubuntu's quality as a distribution as well as providing general advice, oversight, and leadership of QA activities within the Ubuntu project.\"\nIn general, QA in Ubuntu is divided into the following areas:\n\n\n*\n\n*Defect Management (Bug Triage)\n\n*Quality Control (Update, Application, and Pre-Release Testing)\n\n*Quality Assurance (Verification of Changes, Policy Compliance Review)\n\n*Product Improvement (Development) \n\n\nThe Bug Squad Team \"is an essential asset in progressing Ubuntu and its derivatives; The Bug Squad is the first point of contact for the bugs filed about Ubuntu. Members assign bugs to packages, ensure that bug reports are complete, find duplicate bug reports, recreate bugs, and forward bugs to their upstream authors. All of these activities help bugs get fixed and subsequently make Ubuntu even better.\" \nTriaging bugs consists of several things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Responding to new bugs as they are filed.\n\n*Ensuring that new bugs have all the necessary information.\n\n*Assigning bugs to the proper package.\n\n*Confirming bug reports by trying to reproduce them.\n\n*Setting the importance of bugs reports.

How to run Jboss (preferably Jboss 7) as a service on Ubuntu? I can run Jboss using its sh file e.g. sh /jboss/bin/run.sh. But I can not monitor it like tomcat /etc/init.d/tomcat start|stop|restart.\n\nA: In JBoss 5 and 6 you can find in the bin directory proper service scripts, for example jboss_init_redhat.sh. These script can be easily adopted to run in Debian system.\nBut with JBoss 7 there is no such script. I think that you have to adopt for example start script from earlier JBoss version or create your own. \nThere is some documentation about running JBoss as service (boy not for JBoss 7):\nStartJBossOnBootWithLinux\n\nSmall update:\nIn JBoss EAP 6 version you can find init script in bin/init.d directory.\n", "Q: Limit what users can install This is a theoretical scenario that has come up as part of another question:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have x Ubuntu desktops with x users.\n\n*Users don't have sudo privs\n\n*I can let them install things through the software center by editing the Policy Kit rules\n\n*But that would let them install anything (inc games) which is not desirable.\n\n\nI'm wondering if there's a hack that would be able to limit what sorts of things a user can install.\nPackages have a \"section\" (eg games) so I was wondering if it would be possible to force apt to ignore a whole section of packages. Or perhaps a way of setting up an Apt proxy that does this filtering. Changes can be global (eg even somebody with sudo privs won't be able to install games).\nAny ideas welcome.\n\nBefore you leave a comment telling me people could just bring their own debs with them, or download tars from the Internet and run them that way, please remember this a theoretical situation.\nIf it means you'll focus on the question, pretend that my users aren't allowed USB mounts, can't execute things in ~/ and don't have write permissions outside their home. It's locked down. And yes, all of that can be done.\n\nA: I think you should consider the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create your own custom APT Repository using info from here for example but there are a few more out there.\n\n*Sync only what you want users to see\n\n*Change your users desktop source lists to this repository\n\n\nAt this point your users should only see what you want them to see.  You might also have to do some fancy footwork with firewalls to disable access to default ubuntu sources so that your users don't add them as custom sources and start downloading stuff on their own.\n", "Q: Using libnotify from a daemon started with upstart I have a python script that gets messages from an MQTT server and parses them to display using libnotify. This works fine when I run it from a terminal, but when I run it using upstart I get no notification bubbles.

I am running 11.10 on my Thinkpad E420, and it has integrated Bluetooth 3.0, yet when I use my Plantronics Backbeat 903+ (which uses Bluetooth 2.1) I get terribly inconsistent audio with many complete dropouts.\nI also have a USB Bluetooth 2.1 dongle, and when I attach that and use it instead of my internal adapter I get perfect audio quality.  This is why I am curious as to whether or not Ubuntu has Bluetooth 3.0 support.  Any thoughts?\n\nA: AFAIK Ubuntu does support Bluetooth 3, and even if it did not, your Bluetooth 3 capable adapter is using Bluetooth 2.1 for Bluetooth 2.1 devices. Quite likely it is just a driver issue, or your internal adapter might simply do poorly with that device because of how it is built (for example if it does not use enough power for the transmission or what ever. It may even be that it is not getting a clear enough reception).\n\nA: Not 100% related, but I have also noticed extremely short range connectivity & dropouts with this Plantronics Backbeat headset when using it with an Android 2.3 phone... if this is a Linux driver issue it may not be specific to Ubuntu (or even traditional Linux platforms)... but it could equally be a hardware compatibility issue between these bluetooth chips.  Have you been able to verify if this problem is also present with Windows?... this may help to determine if the problem is in software or hardware.\n", "Q: ubuntu upstart script execute a script.py program I'm creating an upstart script to execute a python program I've written.

I need to know if upstart has issues starting the process.\n\nA: Okie, a bit old question but lets answer it from completeness sake :-)\nLets say you saved this job in /etc/init/myapp.conf, then the job name would be myapp. Asking for the job status (and process id) would simply be: status myapp (as root) or sudo status myapp in typical Ubuntu user case.\nInit errors go to dmesg by default, so doing dmesg | grep \"init:\" gives you the log. More verbose logging can be enabled by sudo initctl log-priority info. Debug levels more verbose than that will spam and confuse you :-)\nDoing sudo stop myapp, sudo start myapp gives you feedback instantly on success, plus the process id. In case you get init: unknown job or such, Upstart has failed parsing the configuration file and exact line and reason can be found from dmesg.\n", "Q: Change icon order in Unity 2d in Ubuntu 11.10 How do you rearrange the order of icons in the dock in Unity 2D in Ubuntu 11.10?  I searched and saw a post that said the order can be changed by pulling the icon to the right and dragging it, but I think that might have been for the regular Unity because it does not seem to work for me.  I see that I can remove items from the dock, but what I want to do is move Chrome and Terminal to the top.  I'm sure it's possible, but it's surprising that such a simple task seems so hard.  I assume I must be overlooking something easy.\n\nA: It is really simple. You have to click on the icon and take it pressed for one second or so and then drag it directly up or down over the other icons, without going to the right or out of the dock..the tutorial you saw is strictly for Unity 3D..\n", "Q: How to change cursor in Ubuntu 11.10 \"GNOME Classic\" I don't like how the cursor looks when pointing to Web browser links.

You can install this package and then use sensors to view te sensor values.\nYou can also use it to regulate the fan speed. But be careful, you can burn your CPU if it's not finely cooled !\nI found it: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=42737\n\nA: I believe the issue is kernel-level, and have confirmed the following works (in stopping the fan, and running less often) with kernels 3.2 - 3.5. Though on Inspiron 15R 5520, the root cause is likely the same.\necho \"min_power\" | tee /sys/class/scsi_host/host*/link_power_management_policy\n\nTypically one only needs to do it on host0, but it doesn't hurt to do it as above, just to be sure. Yes, as it's strange as it sounds, the only way I could get the fan to quite down is with enabling SATA ALPM (Agressive Link Power Management) -- the min_power used above. Unfortunately, medium_power doesn't help. max_performance is the default and is what keeps the fan always running for some odd reason. But, since this happens to be a laptop, this may be a good idea anyway as it shaves a good 0.7-1.5Watts off your power consumption when you running on batteries.\nAnother thing to help with power/heat, is power savings options of the integrated GPU - Intel HD 4000 kernel module; i915\noptions i915 modeset=1 i915_enable_rc6=1 i915_enable_fbc=1 lvds_downclock=1 semaphores=1\n\nmodeset is necessary (along with opensource radeon driver) for vgaswitcheroo to work. that way, you can disable the discrete graphics when not needed via:\necho OFF > /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch\n\necho MIGD > /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch\n\necho IGD > /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch\n\necho OFF > /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch\n\nThis 2nd OFF may not be needed, unless scripting, to avoid possible blanking on resume. You may want to run this in startup, for default boot to be more energy efficient (and quieter fan operation).\n\nA: For me the problem was i8kmon. I sorted it out by stopping i8kmon:\n\nsudo service i8kmon stop\n\nI also edited /etc/default/i8kmon and set ENABLED=0 to disable it at startup. \n", "Q: DHCP server only works one time I installed e configured the DHCP server and removed all network-manager*.\nAll my settings are just like this one:\ndhcpd fails to start on eth1\n(but i use eth0)\nI do:\nsudo ifdown eth0\nsudo ifup eth0\n\nThen plug the cable between the server and the client.\nThe client receives the correct IP address: 192-168.0.50\nBUT, if I unplug the cable and put it back the Client doesn't receive a valid IP address.\nI have to make sudo ifdown eth0, sudo ifup eth0 at the server to the client receive a valid IP address again.\nHow do I fix this?\nEDIT: my current configuration files are:\n$ cat /etc/default/isc-dhcp-server\nINTERFACES=\"eth0\"\n\n,\n$ cat /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf\nddns-update-style none;\n\ndefault-lease-time 600;\nmax-lease-time 7200;\n\nsubnet 192.168.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {\n  interface eth0;\n  range 192.168.0.50 192.168.0.100;\n  option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;\n  option broadcast-address 192.168.0.255;\n  option routers 192.168.0.1;\n}\n\n,\n$ cat /etc/network/interfaces\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\naddress 192.168.0.1\nnetwork 192.168.0.0\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\nbroadcast   192.168.0.255\n#gateway    192.168.0.1\n\n,\n$ cat /etc/resolv.conf\nnameserver 192.168.0.1\n\nI'm not using any router or switch.

In scripts, first line should specify the path to interpreter.\nBut on different servers Linux, Unix, or BSD this path could be different.\nWhat is more preferable?\n#!/usr/bin/env bash \n\nor\n#!/bin/bash \n\n\nA: The best practice is this:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash \n#!/usr/bin/env sh\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nAnd so on...\nWhen Ubuntu first started using dash, some scripts broke. There was discussion about it.\nMost scripts were written #!/bin/sh which was a link to /bin/bash.\nThe consensus is this: the script writer is responsible for specifying the interpreter.\nTherefore, if your script should always be invoked with BASH, specify it from the environment. This saves you having to guess the path, which is different on various Unix/Linux systems. In addition, it will work if tomorrow /bin/sh becomes a link to some other shell like /bin/wthsh or some other nonsence.\n\nA: If you want to use the system-installed version of a given interpreter that's installed in a standard location, use the direct path.  If you want to use whatever version of the interpreter appears first in the user's $PATH, use #!/usr/bin/env ....\nThe env command invokes a specified command, letting you set or unset environment variables:\nenv FOO=BAR do-something\nenv DISPLAY=:0.0 xterm -ls &\n\nIf you don't specify any environment variables or other options, it will just invoke the named command.  (Using it this way is arguably a bit of a hack.)\nThe purpose of writing the shebang as\n#!/usr/bin/env interp\n\nis to invoke whatever interp appears first in $PATH.\nThis means you don't have to know, when writing the script, exactly where interp is (say, if it could be in either /bin, /usr/bin, or /usr/local/bin).  Of course you do have to know that env is /usr/bin/env, but that seems to be reasonably universal.\nThe advantage is that it invokes whichever version of the interpreter appears first in the user's $PATH.  The disadvantage is that it invokes whichever version of the interpreter appears first in the user's $PATH.\nFor example, suppose I've installed a personal build of perl under my home directory, as $HOME/bin/perl, and I have $HOME/bin at the front of my $PATH.  If I run a script whose shebang is\n#!/usr/bin/env perl\n\nthen it's going to be run with my own installed perl executable -- which might not be a good thing.  The author of the script probably hasn't tested it with the bleading-edge Perl that I built from source a month ago.\nFor something like Perl or Bash that's likely to be installed in a consistent location on most systems (/usr/bin/perl and /bin/bash, respectively), I'd use the direct path to the command.  For something more obscure that could be installed differently on different systems, I'd either use the /usr/bin/env trick, or I'd write an installer that adjusts the shebang line as the script is being installed.  (I used to have to do that for my Perl scripts.)\nUPDATE : I've gone into a bit more detail in this answer to this question on the Unix & Linux site.\n\nA: FYI it is a shee-bang #!, you need the #. You use this line to identify what interpreter to run the script with. \nBy default, Ubuntu links /bin/sh to dash\nDepending on how much you might like to know about dash and why dash is used for system or deamon shells see:\ncyberciti.biz dash\nUbuntu dash man page\nBash is the default shell used by most Linux users, and has different features then dash. A script written for bash may or may not run properly if run with dash, the more complex the script the less likely it will run.\nScript written for perl, python, etc. will not run at all with /bin/sh or /bin/bash.\nSo when you write a script, you identify what interpreter should be used with the shee-bang\nThe selection of what to use is made by the author of the script, and one is not better then another, they all have various features, advantages, and disadvantages.\n", "Q: I can't start up because root filesystem is full When I try starting up Ubuntu 10.04 I get stuck at this screen which is essentially a log in screen but with out the styling of my custom theme. I guess it is running in low graphics mode? Anyways when this log in screen appears I see a message pop up for like 15 seconds in the top right hand corner that reads \n\nInstall Problem \nThe configuration defaults for Gnome Power Manager\n  have not been installed correctly. Please contact your computer\n  administrator.\n\nI will now mention what occurred before my Ubuntu 10.04 would not boot up properly.

I remember Google Chrome was in the list. I believe I clicked the Install Updates button and off it went. I do not remember if it ever finished updating. I do remember MongoDB installed and after it was done things got weird. \nThe first thing that was out of place was that a message window popped up saying \n\nThe volume “filesystem root” has only 1mb bytes disk space remaining\nYou can free up disk space by removing unused programs or files, or by moving files to > another disk or partition\n\nI clicked examine and Disk Utility popped up with a kind of pie chart of my disk use. I believe it read that 100% of my disk space was being used. I was like 'What the hell? I did not just dump huge multi gigabyte files on my HD' or did I? I ask this because later on in the #MongoDB IRC chat one of the people there told me that MongoDB's server needs 10gb of space to run and that it starts running right after it gets installed. \nAlso I noticed that I could not get Google Chrome to open from clicking the icon or via terminal with the command\ngoogle-chrome \n\nWhen I tried to start Chrome in terminal I got and error almost identical to this one\n$ google-chrome \n$ [4311:4311:95679337296:ERROR:process_singleton_linux.cc(250)] Failed \nto unlink /home/byers/.config/google-chrome/SingletonLock: Read-only \nfile system \n[4311:4311:95679337571:ERROR:process_singleton_linux.cc(265)] Failed \nto create /home/byers/.config/google-chrome/SingletonLock: File exists \n[4311:4311:95679337706:ERROR:process_singleton_linux.cc(250)] Failed \nto unlink /home/byers/.config/google-chrome/SingletonLock: Read-only \nfile system \n[4311:4311:95679337746:ERROR:browser_main.cc(1650)] Failed to create a \nProcessSingleton for your profile directory.

The discussion talks about a tigon3 driver problem in the kernel.  The 3.0.24 and below tree had this error but as Ubuntu now has support for a 3.0.25-40 kernel the bug has been fixed.  Item #20 talks the details of how this problem was discovered by working back from the development kernels 3.4, 3.3, and 3.2 and how it was discovered what the tg3_stop_block_error means.  It is a problem with TSO. TSO stands for TCP Segmentation offload.  \nWhat happened in the pre 3.0.25 kernel is explained by Matt Carlson here\n\nOn the earliest TSO capable devices, TSO was accomplished through \n  firmware.  The TSO cannot coexist with ASF management firmware though. \n  The tg3 driver determines whether or not ASF is enabled by calling \n  tg3_get_eeprom_hw_cfg(), which checks a particular bit of NIC memory. \n  Commit dabc5c670d3f86d15ee4f42ab38ec5bd2682487d, entitled \"tg3: Move \n  TSO_CAPABLE assignment\", accidentally moved the code that determines \n  TSO capabilities earlier than the call to tg3_get_eeprom_hw_cfg().  As a \n  consequence, the driver was attempting to determine TSO capabilities \n  before it had all the data it needed to make the decision. This patch fixes the problem by revisiting and reevaluating the decision \n  after tg3_get_eeprom_hw_cfg() is called. \n\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade should do the trick.  \n", "Q: Can I get external monitors connected to docking station to work with my Lenovo T420s?

Luckily Geany keeps a developers PPA that has the version you are looking for.\nInstall it by using these commands on a terminal\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:geany-dev/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install geany geany-plugins\n\n\nA: On Ubuntu 16.10 | Lubuntu 16.10 and or higher version you can use this command in the terminal:\nsudo apt install geany-plugins. \n\nAfter installation you can go to\n    ✓ Tools => Plugins Manager\nThen you can set it up for your individual needs. \n\nA: No Need of PPA , you can directly install it by using below command from the terminal  \nsudo apt-get install geany geany-common\n\nThe current stable release is more than the mentioned version. If you are asking about the latest update then : https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/geany here you can check the latest version.\nkmcet@ubuntu:~$ apt-cache policy geany\ngeany:\n  Installed: (none)\n  Candidate: 1.23.1+dfsg-1\n  Version table:\n     1.23.1+dfsg-1 0\n        500 http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ saucy/universe amd64 Packages\nkmcet@ubuntu:~$ \n\n", "Q: Difference between Emacs metapackage and Emacs I have the following sources enabled: main, universe, restricted and multiverse. On Ubuntu Software Center on 11.10 I see two packages for Emacs:\n\n\n*\n\n*The GNU Emacs editor (metapackage)\n\n*The GNU Emacs editor\nWhat is the difference between metapackage version and non-metapackage one?\nBy the way, this thread What differences are there between the various version of Emacs available? also explains the difference between two Emacs versions: Emacs and Emacs-snapshot, and interestingly I don't see these packages now on my Ubuntu Software Center.\n\nA: You can see from the descriptions.\nFor emacs, the metapackage, we have\n\nDescription-en: The GNU Emacs editor (metapackage)\n GNU Emacs is the extensible self-documenting text editor.\n This is a metapackage which will always depend on the latest Emacs\n release.\n\n\nwhile for the other we have\n\nDescription-en: The GNU Emacs editor\n GNU Emacs is the extensible self-documenting text editor.\n This package contains a version of Emacs with a Lucid user interface.\n\n\nSo you should install the first, that should automatically bring in the current version of emacs as a dependency.\nUpdate\nA metapackage is a package that do not provides the files of an application per se, but it lives only because of its dependencies. When you install it, also dependencies get installed (a metapackage has also other characteristics, but it is enough here).\nIf you run apt-cache show emacs | grep Depends, you would get the following output:\nDepends: emacs23 | emacs23-lucid | emacs23-nox\n\nand it means that when you install emacs, it needs one of that three packages. How the package manager choose which one to install, I don't know.\n\nA: A metapackage is for your convenience. Think of it as a container of packages. (It's a package of packages, hence the name meta-.) \nMetapackages are intended to make it easier to install stuff. Sometimes they group a number of packages (either regular packages or other meta packages) together. Other times they automatically choose the exact package version for you without you having to know any of the details.\n", "Q: How do I set the refresh time in Gwibber to one second? Does Ubuntu 11.10 use the new version of Gwibber? Then why is that feature (to write to all the accounts I have at the same time) not available? Can someone help to bring it back? More importantly, how can I set the refresh time in Gwibber to 1 second?\n\nA: Gwibber got an update for Ubuntu 11.10, and not all the old features made it to the new version. It's a big improvement overall but it is still a work in progress.  \nYou can report bugs or ask questions on their Launchpad page here, or just wait for the next big update in Ubuntu 12.04.  \nSetting the refresh time to one second is not possible, that's because of rate limiting by Twitter. It has nothing to do with Gwibber. If you somehow set this anyway, Twitter would just return errors after about 350 requests/hour, or less than six minutes.

That sounds straightforward enough, so I log into an the fail-safe terminal to fix it.\nLogging in, I can see that the home folders are owned by root now (I assume this was a by-product of when I copied them).

I cannot find a good source of information in regard to the legal status of some libraries and applications in Ubuntu 11.10, and I am hoping to find some answers here.\nFirstly, it seems Ubuntu includes libjasper1 by default, the legal status of which in the United States, as I understand it, may not be in the clear, as JPEG-2000 may not be free to distribute. What is the story here? If the U.S. cracks down on software patent infringement, will this affect Ubuntu deployments in the U.S.? I really don't care about people's opinions on the legitimacy of such laws, nor do I want any advice to the effect that I should ignore them. I want a straight answer about reality as it is now.\nSecondly, even when you disable Multiverse, software like Audacity and Inkscape are still available, I guess in Universe, and can easily be installed along with legally questionable dependencies. Audacity should not be packaged with mp3 import support by default in Ubuntu, but it is, having libmp3lame and libmad0 as dependencies, which encodes and decodes mp3. My understanding is that even decoding mp3 is not legal in the United States and Japan among others. Inkscape requires Imagemagick, which also includes JPEG-2000 support. Thus, perhaps there are packages that should be in Multiverse that are not. \nCertainly Audacity's libmad0 is a functioning mp3 decoder that is not exclusively in Multiverse, and libmp3lame (which I believe allows encoding) is also easily available with Multiverse disabled, and are also unnecessary dependencies for Audacity. Fedora, for example, just builds Audacity without mp3 support. Furthermore, libjasper1 is a dependency of nearly everything in the default Ubuntu system, which is odd. It seems that you cannot open or save .jp2 files in ImageViewer.\nAnyhow, I need to know what the legal status of these libraries and programs are so that I can safely install Ubuntu and travel with Ubuntu. I hope to get an answer soon.\n\nA: MP3 Legal Issues\nhttp://wiki.audacityteam.org/index.php?title=Lame_Installation#Legal_issues\n\n\n*\n\n*While the LAME source code is free, the encoding technology that\nready-compiled LAME binaries use is patented. The patents are held by\nFraunhofer and administered by Thomson. Patenting raises a\ntheoretical possibility that in some countries a user might need to\npay a licence fee to legally encode MP3s. This might vary according\nto the purpose of the encoding and whether the software being used is\nlicensed. There is no definitive list of countries where the patents\nunambiguously hold sway. However they are generally assumed to be\nenforceable in USA, Canada, the EEC and Japan. This means that in\nthese countries (in theory), software that encodes MP3s must be\nlicensed by the patent holders, and that anyone encoding MP3s with\nunlicensed encoders may also be infringing patents.\n\n\nThe best advice that can be given is that the user makes their own decision, based on their conscience, the country they are in, and taking into account the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*The patent holders have tended to enforce licence fees against\ncommercial rather than free MP3 encoders\n\n*Thomson themselves have said that no license is needed by individuals\ncreating music libraries of MP3 files for personal use\n(interpretations vary whether that sanctions using unlicensed\nencoders, free or otherwise)\n\n*MP3 patents will expire worldwide between 2010 and 2012.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3\n\n\n*\n\n*In September 1998, the Fraunhofer Institute sent a letter to several\ndevelopers of MP3 software stating that a license was required to\n\"distribute and/or sell decoders and/or encoders\". The letter claimed\nthat unlicensed products \"infringe the patent rights of Fraunhofer\nand Thomson. To make, sell and/or distribute products using the [MPEG\nLayer-3] standard and thus our patents, you need to obtain a license\nunder these patents from us.\" The various MP3-related patents expire\non dates ranging from 2007 to 2017 in the U.S. MP3 license revenues\ngenerated about €100 million for the Fraunhofer Society in 2005.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The group that holds the patent on MP3's demands that for each player\nwith MP3 support a 75 cent fee must be paid:\n\n\nhttp://www.mp3licensing.com/royalty/index.html\n\n\n*\n\n*However, no license is needed for private, non-commercial activities\n(e.g., home-entertainment),receiving broadcasts and creating a\npersonal music library), not generating revenue or other\nconsideration of any kind or for entities with associated gross\nrevenue less than US$ 100 000.00.\n\n\nhttp://www.mp3licensing.com/help/#5\nWhile you can legally distribute and use the MP3 format, the content of these files is what gets you \"in trouble\" i.e. you can't distribute Copyrighted Content such as Songs and make profit but of course you can use (listen to) them.\n\n\n*\n\n*Mp3 of course is open for all end-user applications (that is, we\ndon't license end-users).\n\n\nhttp://www.mp3licensing.com/\n\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/CDRipping\n\n\n*\n\n*If you live in a country where it is legal to use this format, to\nencode MP3s, you can use Sound Juicer which uses gstreamer and the\nLAME mp3 encoder. The following should also work with other programs\nthat use gstreamer:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enable the universe and multiverse repositories. Then, install the\npackage ubuntu-restricted-extras (which is not included by default, it is the end-user that chooses to install it).\n\n*If you now restart Sound Juicer via Applications > Sound & Video >\nAudio CD Extractor you will find the new audio formats available\nunder Edit > Preferences.\n\n\n\n(It is illegal to copy music from a CD and redistribute it unless you have the copyright owner's permission).\nYou can legally use the Fluendo MP3 decoder available in the Partners repository.\nIf anything you are better of using:\nOgg Vorbis, and FLAC are patent free.\n\n\n*\n\n*Ogg Vorbis is similar to mp3 except it is of course free. It\ncompresses audio to save space while retaining audio quality. The\nquality of vorbis was tested to be higher or equal to competitors\nsuch as wma and apple audio.\n\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogg_vorbis\n\n\n*\n\n*FLAC is a lossless free software format, which means it creates an\nexact replica of the audio you convert it from. (Mp3 and vorbis\nremove quality to save space). I personally use flac, which means I\nget full quality 44,100hz 16bit CD audio saving almost half the\nspace.\n\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flac\nJPEG 2000 Legal issues\nJPEG 2000 is by itself licensed, but the contributing companies and organizations agreed that licenses for its first part—the core coding system—can be obtained free of charge from all contributors.\nThe JPEG committee has stated:\n\n\n*\n\n*It has always been a strong goal of the JPEG committee that its\nstandards should be implementable in their baseline form without\npayment of royalty and license fees... The up and coming JPEG 2000\nstandard has been prepared along these lines, and agreement reached\nwith over 20 large organizations holding many patents in this area to\nallow use of their intellectual property in connection with the\nstandard without payment of license fees or royalties.\n\n\nHowever, the JPEG committee has also noted that undeclared and obscure submarine patents may still present a hazard:\n\n\n*\n\n*It is of course still possible that other organizations or\nindividuals may claim intellectual property rights that affect\nimplementation of the standard, and any implementers are urged to\ncarry out their own searches and investigations in this area\n\n\nBecause of this statement, controversy remains in the software community concerning the legal status of the JPEG 2000 standard.\nHowever, many Linux distributions include a JPEG 2000 library\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG_2000#Legal_issues\nLicensing:\nGPL & LGPL\n\n\n*\n\n*“GPL” stands for “General Public License”.

(How to get Ubuntu back after installing Windows?) I installed Windows 7, which ate Ubuntu's boot file. When starting up the computer, it now goes straight to Windows, without giving me the option of booting Ubuntu. \nHow can I get Ubuntu back?\n\nA: Boot-Repair worked for me. It's very very easy to use graphical application, you do not need to use the command line, you only have to click a button :)\nAll the available repair options are described in the Ubuntu documentation and there is a separate page explaining how to start Boot-Repair (by creating a bootable disk or installing it in an existing Ubuntu live disk) and how to use it.\nJust boot a Ubuntu live CD, install Boot-Repair and run it.\n\nA: When GRUB is broken, the user generally does not have access to systems, so repair must be performed from a live-session (live-CD or live-USB).\nThere are many possible causes to a GRUB break: Windows writing on the MBR, DRM preventing GRUB from installing correctly, installer bug, hardware change...\nUpdating GRUB as proposed initially by Scott is generally not sufficient, reinstalling GRUB as proposed by Marco is more efficient, but still there are various situations requiring other tweaks (adding options to kernel, unhiding GRUB menu, changing GRUB options, choosing the right host architecture...).\nOther difficulties for repairing GRUB is the use of chroot, and the choice of the right partitions /disks.\nAll of this has been made easy in a little graphical tool: Boot-Repair. It\nshall be integrated in Ubuntu 12.04 CD for easier use, but for people needing it now, there are already some distros integrating it: Ubuntu-Secured-Remix (Ubuntu CD integrating Boot-Repair), Boot-Repair-Disk (CD running Boot-Repair at start-up), ...\nHope this helps.\n\nA: Answers given by Scott and Web-E are good enough and have helped a lot many times. But many a times, the boot-repair tool is not able to repair grub due to problems related to i386 and amd64 platform or one where grub can't find efi directory.\nWhat has solved my problem like more than 10 times is to manually purge the old grub installations and install a new one.\nSo first perform the first 6 steps from Scott's answer where you can skip the 5th step if it gives an error:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Boot from the live CD or live USB, in \"Try Ubuntu\" mode. \n  \n*Determine the partition number of your main partition. sudo fdisk -l, sudo blkid or GParted (which should already be installed, by default, on the live session) can help you here. I'm going to assume\n  in this answer that it's /dev/sda2, but make sure you use the\n  correct partition number for your system!\nIf your main partition is in an LVM, the device will instead be located in /dev/mapper/, most likely,\n  /dev/mapper/{volume}--{os}-root where {volume} is the LVM volume\n  name and {os} is the operating system. Execute ls /dev/mapper for\n  the exact name.\n  \n*Mount your partition:\nsudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt  #Replace sda2 with the partition from step 2\n\nIf you have a separate /boot, /var or /usr partitions, repeat steps 2 and 3 to mount these partitions to /mnt/boot,\n  /mnt/var and /mnt/usr respectively. For example,\nsudo mount /dev/sdXW /mnt/boot\nsudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt/var\nsudo mount /dev/sdXZ /mnt/usr\n\nreplacing sdXW, sdXY, and sdXZ with the respective partition numbers.\n  \n*Bind mount some other necessary stuff:\nfor i in /sys /proc /run /dev; do sudo mount --bind \"$i\" \"/mnt$i\"; done\n\n  \n*If Ubuntu is installed in EFI mode ([see this answer if you're unsure][efi]), use sudo fdisk -l | grep -i efi or GParted to find\n  your EFI partition. It will have a label of EFI. Mount this\n  partition, replacing sdXY with the actual partition number for your\n  system:\nsudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt/boot/efi\n\n  \n*chroot into your Ubuntu install:\nsudo chroot /mnt\n\n\nThen do these steps:   \n\n\n*\n\n*Configure all the pending packages.\nsudo dpkg --configure -a\n\n*Fix the broken packages.\nsudo apt install -fy\n\n*Remove the current grub.\nsudo apt purge -y grub*-common grub-common:i386 shim-signed\nThis may give you a warning that your device will have no bootloader\nand may be unable to boot the next time. Go ahead and accept it.\n\n*sudo apt install -y grub-pc\n After running this command, it will ask you to point the current sdXY to install the bootloader. Find where your current OS is installed using sudo fdisk -l command. It will be labelled as Linux. Navigate that window using Tab key and select an option using Space key. \n\n*If everything goes right, grub will be installed correctly. You can also do sudo grub-update for a double check.\n\n\nIf the problem still persists, you can read Arch's wiki to actually understand about grub to tackle many other varieties of problems. (Yes, also helps for Ubuntu!). \n\nA: When you install Windows, Windows assumes it is the only operating system (OS) on the machine, or at least it does not account for Linux. So it replaces GRUB with its own boot loader. What you have to do is replace the Windows boot loader with GRUB. I've seen various instructions for replacing GRUB by mucking around with GRUB commands or some such, but to me the easiest way is to simply chroot into your install and run update-grub. chroot is great because it allows you to work on your actual install, instead of trying to redirect things here and there. It is really clean.\nHere's how:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from the live CD or live USB, in \"Try Ubuntu\" mode. \n\n*Determine the partition number of your main partition. sudo fdisk -l, sudo blkid or GParted (which should already be installed, by default, on the live session) can help you here. I'm going to assume in this answer that it's /dev/sda2, but make sure you use the correct partition number for your system!\nIf your main partition is in an LVM, the device will instead be located in /dev/mapper/, most likely, /dev/mapper/{volume}--{os}-root where {volume} is the LVM volume name and {os} is the operating system. Execute ls /dev/mapper for the exact name.\n\n*Mount your partition:\nsudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt  #Replace sda2 with the partition from step 2\n\nIf you have a separate /boot, /var or /usr partitions, repeat steps 2 and 3 to mount these partitions to /mnt/boot, /mnt/var and /mnt/usr respectively. For example,\nsudo mount /dev/sdXW /mnt/boot\nsudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt/var\nsudo mount /dev/sdXZ /mnt/usr\n\nreplacing sdXW, sdXY, and sdXZ with the respective partition numbers.\n\n*Bind mount some other necessary stuff:\nfor i in /sys /proc /run /dev; do sudo mount --bind \"$i\" \"/mnt$i\"; done\n\n\n*If Ubuntu is installed in EFI mode (see this answer if you're unsure), use sudo fdisk -l | grep -i efi or GParted to find your EFI partition. It will have a label of EFI. Mount this partition, replacing sdXY with the actual partition number for your system:\nsudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt/boot/efi\n\n\n*chroot into your Ubuntu install:\nsudo chroot /mnt\n\n\n*At this point, you're in your install, not the live session, and running as root. Update grub:\nupdate-grub\n\nIf you get errors or if going up to step 7 didn't fix your problem, go to step 8. (Otherwise, it is optional.)\n\n*Depending on your situation, you might have to reinstall grub:\ngrub-install /dev/sda\nupdate-grub # In order to find and add windows to grub menu.\n\n\n*If Ubuntu is installed in EFI mode, and EFI partition UUID has changed, you may need to update it in /etc/fstab. Compare it:\nblkid | grep -i efi\ngrep -i efi /etc/fstab\n\nIf current EFI partition UUID (from blkid) differs from the one in /etc/fstab, update /etc/fstab with current UUID.\n\n*If everything worked without errors, then you're all set:\nexit\nsudo reboot\n\n\n*At this point, you should be able to boot normally.\nIf you cannot boot normally, and didn't do step 8 because there were no error messages, try again with step 8.\n\n\n*\n\n*Sometimes giving GRUB2 the correct configuration for your partitions is not enough, and you must actually install it (or reinstall it) to the Master Boot Record, which step 8 does. Experience helping users in chat has shown that step 8 is sometimes necessary even when no error messages are shown.\n\n\nA: Scott Severance's answer is valid and detailed but there is a resolution that requires no external boot device and so no need to identify and manually mount all of your Ubuntu partitions leading up to the chroot.\nIn Windows 10, you can use Advanced Recovery to select a device (partition?) to boot from.\nGo to Settings and choose Update & Security:\n\nGo to Recovery:\n\nFrom Advanced Startup choose Restart Now\n\nThen choose Use a Device and all the boot options should be presented to you. Choose the 'ubuntu' partition and your PC should then boot from that partition.\nOnce booted into my usual Ubuntu environment, I have tried just running grub-update but that made no change.\nI then found my /boot/efi partition which was /dev/nvme0n1p1 and ran sudo grub-install /dev/nvme0n1p1 and then sudo update-grub.\nThis has restored my master boot record multiple times now as there seems to be a new Windows 10 policy of overwriting boot info on minor updates.\n\nA: Boot from a live Ubuntu USB pendrive or CD\nand \nInstall Boot-Repair on ubuntu by following steps\nOpen the terminal and run the following commands\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install boot-repair\n\nAfter completing the installation you can launch it from System->Administration->Boot-Repair menu if you use Gnome, or search \"boot-repair\" in the dash if you use Unity. Then follow the following screenshots:\nMethod 1\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on the advanced options\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Tick the options shown below\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Change the tab to Grub Location Tab and Tick The options Shown in the figure\n\nPress Apply and Reboot the system\nMethod 2\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the recommended Boot repair options as shown in the first screenshot\n\n\nDocumentation :\n\nA: It turns out grub can be fixed from Windows too. Running the following (as administrator) from CMD brought the grub menu back for me.\nbcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi\n\n\nA: Windows does not see Linux formatted partitions. You need to use gparted from a liveCD and create a primary partition formatted NTFS with the boot flag.\nSome have had issues if the new primary partition is after the extended partition as Windows does not always reset partition table correctly. Best to have good backups and a separate backup of partition table.\nBackup partition table to text file & save to external device.\nsudo sfdisk -d /dev/sda > PTsda.txt\n\nThis is only for MBR (msdos) systems. If your Ubuntu install is in GPT partition drive you can only install Windows in UEFI mode or convert drive back to MBR (msdos).\n\nA: Only fsck command fixed the grub-rescue screen for me.\nUse Boot-Repair to boot from Live-CD, then open Terminal\nGet the correct device:\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nNeed to find the boot device, the boot device has * under Boot category like here:\nDevice     Boot   Start       End   Sectors  Size Id Type\n/dev/sda1          2048   2000895   1998848  976M 82 Linux swap / Solaris\n/dev/sda2  *    2000896 943716351 941715456  449G 83 Linux\n\nNow repair the disk by using:\nsudo fsck /dev/sda2 -y\n\nNote: /dev/sda2 is the boot device in this example.\nReboot when completed. Done.\n\nA: Just install easyBCD in Windows 7 and do  \nAdd New Entry > Linux/BSD > (select ) Grub2 > (push) Add Entry\nThen you can choose Ubuntu on the Windows 7 bootloader to go to Grub2 (previous bootloader).\n\nA: The Windows installer doesn't care about other OS in the system. So it writes own code over the master boot record. Fortunately the solution is easy too. \nYou need to repair the MBR. Do the following\nBoot using a live usb/cd of ubuntu. \nUse boot-repair to fix the problem.\nAfter booting with live usb/cd, run following command in terminal:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair && sudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && boot-repair\n\nUse Recomended Repair.\n\nMore info - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair\n\nA: On EFI-based systems (such as most systems that shipped with Windows 8 or later), Windows will sometimes update its boot loader or reset it to be the default boot loader. This is particularly common when re-installing the OS or performing a major system update (upgrading to the latest Windows release, for instance). Note that Windows is unlikely to actually erase any GRUB files on an EFI-based computer. Everything needed to boot Ubuntu is still in place; it's just being bypassed. In these cases, a complete re-installation of GRUB is overkill, and in fact that carries a (small) chance that it will create new problems.\nThus, instead of re-installing GRUB in these cases, I recommend resetting GRUB (or whatever boot loader or boot manager you prefer) to be the default. There are several ways to do this, including:\n\n\n*\n\n*EasyUEFI -- The easiest way to adjust the boot order, if the system is booting straight to Windows, is to use EasyUEFI, which is a free (for the basic version) third-party GUI tool for managing the EFI boot order. It's pretty self-explanatory -- locate the ubuntu entry in the list of boot options and move it to the top of the list. The next time you reboot, GRUB should come up. (If you use something other than GRUB, you'll need to locate its entry.)\n\n*bcdedit -- The Windows bcdedit tool can be used to set GRUB to the default boot order. The command bcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi, typed in an Administrator Command Prompt window, will do this; however, if your computer boots with Secure Boot active, bcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\shimx64.efi will be required instead. In fact, the latter command will usually work even if Secure Boot is not in use, so I'd use that command first. Note that there's a more advanced Windows shell tool that requires a slightly different syntax than I've presented, but I don't recall the details.\n\n*One-time boot to Ubuntu -- Most EFIs provide a built-in boot manager, accessed by hitting a function key, Esc, or Enter early in the system start process. Chances are the ubuntu entry to boot Ubuntu will show up in this boot manager menu, enabling you to boot to Ubuntu. Alternatively, you could boot to an Ubuntu emergency medium, like the installer booted in \"try before installing\" mode. Either way, you can then use efibootmgr to adjust the boot order:\n\n\n*\n\n*Type sudo efibootmgr to see the boot entries.\n\n*Note the current BootOrder line.\n\n*Locate the entry for ubuntu and note its Boot#### number.\n\n*Type sudo efibootmgr -o xxxx[,yyyy,zzzz,....] to change the boot order, making xxxx the number for Ubuntu. What comes after that is most likely not very important, although I've noted that Windows seems to be likely to add itself back to the start of the boot order if it's not in the list. Thus, you should probably ensure that Windows is in the list, and it may be safest to re-order the list so that all the original entries are there, just with the ubuntu entry moved to the top of the list.\n\n\n*Firmware setup utility -- Some EFIs' setup utilities enable you to adjust the boot order. Details vary greatly from one EFI to another, so I won't go into specifics, but you could look for such an option in your setup utility.\n\n\nThere are other variants on these procedures, such as using bcfg in an EFI shell, using bless in macOS, using my rEFInd to do a one-time boot, etc. I'd start with EasyUEFI, though; it's likely to be the simplest solution. Sometimes Windows insists on making itself the default every time it starts up, though, and reports indicate that bcdedit may do a better job of dealing with that problem.\nNote that none of the preceding applies to BIOS-mode installations; however, as most computers that shipped with Windows 8 or later boot in EFI mode, BIOS-mode installations are becoming increasingly rare, so in many cases it's better to deal with the issue in the EFI way rather than by blindly re-installing GRUB.\n\nA: There is now a simpler solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot, and enter your computer's BIOS options (F2, or sometimes F11).\n\n*Go to the Boot menu, and select Boot Device Priority\n\n*Check if Windows Boot Manager is above the main boot drive (usually SATA HDD … or IDE HDD …). If it is, move the boot disk priority above that of Windows Boot Manager.\n\n*Save your BIOS options, and exit (usually F10).\n\n\nThis has been tested on a Samsung Series 7 Chronos laptop dual booting Windows 8 and Ubuntu 13.10, secure boot disabled, UEFI and legacy boot enabled.\n\nA: I had a different issue, caused (probably) by boot-repair wiping my /etc/grub.d/ templates, outlined in my question here: Ubuntu 18.04 not booting after Windows 10 install\nAs pointed out by @karels comment, the grub config is generated using the files in /etc/grub.d. My directory only contained /etc/grub.d/25_custom, which contained strange menu entries pointing to non-existent .efi images.

Unfortunately, whenever one of monitors enters standby mode (or is turned off) my other monitors enter Cloned desktop mode, and have to be reconfigured to my One large desktop setup in amdcccle. \nSince I need to be able to turn off my monitors to get rid of the annoying blinking blue lights, I can't avoid the monitors being removed from my display setup.\nI've also noticed that if I turn off all of my monitors, Xorg will use 100% of my CPU, and will become unresponsive (even to the point where I cannot kill it). The only way to unlock my machine is to reboot.\nIs it possible to disable automatic monitor detection so that changes are not made when monitors become unavailable to the system?\n\nA: For users using the gnome2 desktop environment: Choose System -> Preferences -> Power Management and set put display to sleep to never.

Is it related to this 'sticky bit' thing I've heard about but never quite understood?\n\nA: The uppercase T appears when the x bit for \"others\" (ie in the last position) is not set. Both of these directories have the sticky bit set, but the second one has no execute permission for \"others\"\ndrwxrwxrwt 2 zanna zanna 4096 May 13 09:53 t\ndrwxrwxrwT 2 zanna zanna 4096 May 13 09:53 T\n\nSince it is replaced by the sticky bit's [tT], we need some way of knowing whether the directory has execute permission for \"others\" or not, hence the difference in case\nIn our file browser, the Permissions tab under Properties shows the differences between directories with and without execute permissions more clearly: we need execute permission to access (enter or stat) a directory.\n\nHere's what Wikipedia has to say about the sticky bit on directories:\n\nThe most common use of the sticky bit today is on directories. When the sticky bit is set, only the item's owner, the directory's owner, or the superuser can rename or delete files. Without the sticky bit set, any user with write and execute permissions for the directory can rename or delete contained files, regardless of owner. Typically this is set on the /tmp directory to prevent ordinary users from deleting or moving other users' files.

I'd say only around 40% of the packages installed on my system have a homepage listed.\nThere is no simple way to (programatically) determine the license of a package. The Debian control file has no field for a license title. License details for a package foo should be given in the /usr/share/doc/<foo>/copyright file. However, there is no standard format for these files. Some of them are fairly simple and basically say this is released under the GPL v3, see /usr/share/common-licenses/GPL-3 for the full license text. Others have a custom license included in full. Complex packages can have different licenses for different pieces of it (e.g., one for the program and another for graphics). Often, the license of the Debian packaging information is also included.\nIn short: it is simple to manually get the license for a single package. If you need to do it automatically for all installed packages, it will take a large amount of effort.\n\nA: Building off of @crysman's answer: \nThis worked for many packages on ubuntu 14.04, and the ${packages:amd64} part was to navigate to the correct folder based on my processor. \nfor package in `dpkg -l | grep ^ii | awk '{print $2}'`; do echo -e $package\"\\t\"`grep License /usr/share/doc/${package%:amd64}/copyright`; done > ~/dpkg.txt\n\n\nA: The license and source url (I think you mean here the upstream source url of the tarball) can usually be found in a file called copyright. This file should be in every package, but it has only been recently \"standardized\" for easier machine/computer reading (see DEP5).\nNot all packages have the licenses correctly filled in. Also, not all the packages have machine-readable copyright files. One single file can sometimes require a separate license and can make the debian package a candidate for removal if the license does not allow redistribution (or it's not a free/open source approved license). \n\nA: In order to download the debian/copyright file of each package you could use the cupt package manager, like so:\ncupt copyright busybox python > all-copyrights.txt\n\nor to get one file per package:\nfor i in busybox python; do cupt copyright \"$i\" >\"$i\"_copyright.txt; done\n\nIn contrast to Fedora, Debian/Ubuntu normally doesn't give a single license for a package but instead lists all the licenses in the source; it's by far more accurate in that sense, but also harder to get an overview. Also, the non-uniform format of older debian/copyright files doesn't help either :)\n\nA: The closest thing I can think of that is comparable to yum info would be apt-cache show. I don't know if ever will show the license, but it gives a bunch of details about a package. You can provide multiple package names to get details about more than one package at once.\nFor example:\nmatt@eden:~$ apt-cache show python\nPackage: python\nPriority: important\nSection: python\nInstalled-Size: 768\nMaintainer: Ubuntu Developers <ubuntu-devel-discuss@lists.ubuntu.com>\nOriginal-Maintainer: Matthias Klose <doko@debian.org>\nArchitecture: all\nSource: python-defaults\nVersion: 2.7.2-7ubuntu2\nReplaces: python-dev (<< 2.6.5-2)\nProvides: python-ctypes, python-email, python-importlib, python-profiler, python-wsgiref\nDepends: python2.7 (>= 2.7.2-3~), python-minimal (= 2.7.2-7ubuntu2)\nSuggests: python-doc (= 2.7.2-7ubuntu2), python-tk (= 2.7.2-7ubuntu2)\nConflicts: python-central (<< 0.5.5)\nBreaks: python-bz2 (<< 1.1-8), python-csv (<< 1.0-4), python-email (<< 2.5.5-3), update-manager (<= 0.200.5-1)\nFilename: pool/main/p/python-defaults/python_2.7.2-7ubuntu2_all.deb\nSize: 165792\nMD5sum: a4b881e98e39f213bc8bbcfac566dd21\nSHA1: 8a85fd4e62d1bad26a03ceef4313a12521e8a1dc\nSHA256: ba95771b54aa4a1211486651fea1ecbac9e2dbbb4f66435e8a4dd0cb3e86bf4b\nDescription-en: interactive high-level object-oriented language (default version)\n Python, the high-level, interactive object oriented language,\n includes an extensive class library with lots of goodies for\n network programming, system administration, sounds and graphics.\n .\n This package is a dependency package, which depends on Debian's default\n Python version (currently v2.7).\nHomepage: http://www.python.org/\nDescription-md5: d1ea97f755d8153fe116080f2352859b\nBugs: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+filebug\nOrigin: Ubuntu\nSupported: 18m\nTask: minimal\n\n\nA: You might use something like:\nfor package in `dpkg -l | grep ^ii | awk '{print $2}'`; do apt-cache policy $package; done | grep -iv \"version table\" | grep -i -e :$ -e multiverse -e restricted\n\n", "Q: How to configure firewall for home PC Firstly, for a home PC, behind a router isit important to install/configure a firewall? \nIf so, how do I do it? I have lamp-server installed as I'm a web developer. I may want my other PC's on LAN to access my files or web pages, ssh in (maybe in the future), but not from outside. How can I configure this? From work, I learnt that I keep blocking myself all the time, also denyhosts is useful for bruteforce hacking. But problem is I am not a System Admin so I keep blocking myself (including others) instead. Maybe gufw + denyhosts maybe a good start\n\nA: Your question if fairly broad and I will try to answer some parts.\nA firewall can be helpful for you, and you already know what you want - allow clients on your LAN and deny everyone else.\nSo, first thing, your router. Disable UPnP and do not forward port 80 (http) or 443 (https). If you need , you can forward SSH (port 22).\nOn the server you can then significantly increase ssh security if you use ssh keys (to log in) and disable passwords.\nUbuntu wiki ssh keys\ndenyhosts can be helpful, but the lockouts are a hassle. You can whitelist an IP or ip range.\nFor some advice on denyhost see http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/block-ssh-attacks-with-denyhosts/ or the denyhosts documentation.\nNow for your firewall , you can easily use ufw or if you want a graphical front end gufw.\nAssuming you want just HTTP and SSH (change 192.168.0.0/24 to your LAN):\nsudo ufw enable\nsudo ufw allow from 192.168.0.0/24 to any port 80\nsudo ufw allow from 192.168.0.0/24 to any port 443 \n\n# for ssh from anywhere\nsudo ufw allow ssh\n\n# for ssh from your lan only\nsudo ufw allow from 192.168.0.0/24 to any port 22\n\nSee also Ubuntu wiki UFW\n\nA: If you use your home machine for developing anything for a client, or have sensitive information on there it is worth looking at the benefits.\nAs @medigeek said, it may be overkill for you, as your ISP's router/modem will give some protection. It may by default deny all inbound until you open a route in.\nHowever - if you take the usual security assumption that at some point someone or something malicious may get past that router (through an unpatched or zero-day vulnerability, a misconfiguration, via your file server or web server etc) what protection do you have, and how much do you want?\nI generally advise anyone who even does online banking to have a layered approach:\n\n\n*\n\n*deny all inbound on the router\n\n*host firewall (whether they are on Windows, Linux or other)\n\n*look at DMZ's if you run a range of servers at home\n\n*ensure all accessible machines are patched up to date\n\n\nThese are all simple options which require very little maintenance for a standard home setup with <10 servers or PC's\n", "Q: How to host my commercial application in Ubuntu Software center? I’ve checked the Ubuntu Software center for hosting my commercial (closed source) app.\nIt appears that the store does not have any DRM support, to protect against copying the bought application to other PCs. This may be OK, because I have my own license key generation mechanism.\nThe problem is that my license key generation is not Microsoft-like, I can not pre-generate a bunch of keys in advance, because the key stores the user name and other data within it.\nThe question is how to integrate my license key mechanism with your store?\nAs a fallback, can I host my app as “free” instead because it has lite/trial mode when installed without the license key?\nAny other idea to resolve the issue?\n\nA: No, there is no DRM support currently.\nNo, unfortunately if you can't load a set of pre-generated keys in the interface, then the myapps service can't (yet) sell your licenses [1].\nYes, you can add your demo/trial app - especially if you have another way for people to purchase license keys that will unlock it.

One of them had a problem; I was not sure if it was a hardware or software problem. Sometimes it would suddenly start working extremely slow (it needed a few minutes to open an application, such as a terminal window) and afterward the screen would become grey and inactive. After some time (5-10 minutes) it would start to work normally again.\nI've installed Ubuntu 11.04 on an external drive. In the beginning it was working fine, but after some time (quite short) the same problem began to appear when the computer was running the system installed on the external drive. So I thought it was a hardware problem.\nYesterday I had to switch off the computer using the power button, since the problem persisted for at least half an hour. Since that time the system on the external drive has been completely broken; when I'm trying to boot the other computer with the system on the external drive, even GRUB doesn't show up (even after waiting about 20 minutes).

The ability to customise Ubuntu to meet your specific\n  needs is one of the great strengths of free software in general, and\n  Ubuntu in particular. While we encourage customisation and derivation\n  of Ubuntu, we must balance that freedom with the integrity of the\n  Trademarks and the quality which they represent. To help reach that\n  balance, we have established the following guidelines and definitions.\n  We recognise and encourage the concept of a “remix.” Remixes are\n  derived versions of Ubuntu, and it is intended that any software and\n  hardware certifications will apply to a Remix. Therefore the changes\n  from the official Ubuntu product must be minimal to be permitted to\n  use the Trademarks. These changes can include configuration changes\n  through the existing Ubuntu configuration management tools, changes to\n  artwork and graphical themes and some variance in package selection.\n  In general, a Remix can have applications from the Ubuntu archives\n  added, or default applications removed, but removing or changing any\n  infrastructure components (e.g., shared libraries or desktop\n  components) will result in changes too large for the resulting product\n  to be called by a Trademark. Note that if the nature of the product's\n  divergence from Ubuntu changes, the Remix naming and Trademark use may\n  no longer apply.\n\n\nA: The trademark policy only applies if you wanted to the use the word \"Ubuntu\" in the name of your product - say you called your service \"Ubuntu widgets\".\nHowever if you have your own name then you don't need to pay any money to Canonical (the holder of the Ubuntu trademark). You can use as much of the Ubuntu software and platform as you want without paying a penny, though you can pay for support.\n\nA: Its Linux, read the GPL and stick with what it allows you to do and you should be fine. A more simplified take is this don't sell someone elses hard work as your own, GPL protects authored code abuse but doesn't restrict you from doing what you like so long as you contribute and give proper credit. That is essentially the whole idea behind open source. Trademarks usually protect naming conventions or logos as long as you don't use them or use your own you should be fine.\n", "Q: How can I customize the Unity top panel? How can I put the opened programs in the top bar to switch between them? Like Xubuntu, KDE, Gnome classic, fallback... But I'm talking about Unity.\nI need see/know what software I'm using in some moment without need to use the large side bar of Unity.\nI'm left-hand and I can't use  +  all the time.\nI need alternate between the programs using the top bar without a bar that group the same programas (as the Unity sidebar do it).\nI can't believe Canonical didn't think about the big free space in the top bar (just have the clock, system tray and some icons).\nI installed MyUnity but I can't change anything about top bar.\nI know the top bar is the app menu.\nI just want the opened programs without use the sidebar. The sidebar group the same window. Where can I mark to never group? MyUnity and CompizConfig Setting Manager don't have this option. \n\nA: The top panel isn't empty. It is used for applications menus and titlebars, and you can add many indicators which also requires space. I sometimes like to use my screens narrow and tall, and then there would really not be any room for anything more. \nYou can't add a taskbar to the top panel. Adding a bottom panel with a taskbar is fairly easy, though. You can use Gnome Panel (the panels from earlier versions of Ubuntu -- they are still available), Xfces panel, LXDEs panel or any other panel you like. There will be no conflict with Unity as long as you only use a bottom panel. In the case of Gnome Panel, you'd have to delete the top panel manually, either by pressing alt and right-clicking the top panel, or you could use dconf-editor from the dconf-tools package.\nFor instance, this is Unity with an xfce4-panel taskbar, with extras. As you can see, there's no conflict. I would probably recommend that you use Gnome Panel if that's what you're used to. Just remember that in Gnome Panel 3, you have to press alt to display the right-click menu on the panel or move applets. Otherwise, it's just the same as in earlier versions. \n\n\nA: By default you can't customize top panel. However there are workarounds. But I advise you not to play with your top panel, as it will only create additional issues, which might not be easy to fix.\n", "Q: 1920x1200 resolution shows black area on bottom right I just bought a new 27 inches monitor, I plugged it in and ubuntu started with my old monitor resolution (1440x900). So I went to the nvidia-xconfig (the default config tool wont work because I use a nvidia card), I set the resolution to auto and it selected 1920x1200 (I also tried selecting it manually and other resolutions higher than 1440, the problem is the same), but on screen the monitor only seems to be showing a 1440x900 rectangle and the rest of the screen (right bottom) is black, here's a screenshot:\nhttp://i.stack.imgur.com/z4GQn.png\nAny resolution higher than 1440x900 have this problem, I have also tried pressing the \"auto adjust\" button on the monitor but that wont work.

(solved)\n\nUpdate3:\nWhat was changing the resolution was monitors.xml file, I edited it using the values 1920x1200, and this time after login the resolution doesn't change but the black border like in the screenshot appears. So the problem is still the black border in the bottom right.\n\nUpdate4:\nI found the cause!, if I kill compiz the resolution works fine so I went to System > Preferences > Appearance > Visual Effects, and selected none. Now it works fine!. I am still curious what's causing it, I set it to normal and the problem occurs, I then went to CompizConfig Settings Manager and deselected all the effects, but the problem persists, the only workaround I found is setting the Visual Effects to none.\nWhat else could I try to find the real root of the problem? Because I am still having some problems like when I put the mouse hover the shutdown tray icon all the icons changes positions and also colors, it's really weird.\n\nA: I didn't find a solution but a workaround, I had to disable compiz Visual Effects.\n", "Q: Need Recommendation for Upgrading from 10.10 to 11.10 I'm ready to finally move from 10.10 to 11.10.

My current drive is separated into separate partitions with home and data all separate (somewhat of a legacy setup from when I dual booted). My home and data partitions are rsynced regularly to a NAS.

I'm prepared to NOT do an upgrade (especially since I would have to do it twice--10.10-->11.04-->11.10.\nBelow is a snapshot of my current partition scheme.\n\n\nA: You can do what is called a \"dirty install\", since you already have a separate partition for /home. When the installer brings up the partitioning app, instruct it to NOT reformat the partition where /home resides. It will do a full install, but it will not overwrite /home.\nThen, you will still have to reinstall your applications, but most of your settings and other configuration will remain intact.

How do I fix this? The day before yesterday, I opened Ubuntu.\nI always go to the update manager first. After I loaded the updates and tried to re-start, I got a command line prompt saying grub_. I have never encountered any thing like this before.\nThe only way that I can get out of grub_ is to disconnect all the power going to my Compaq laptop. Is there a way to fix this? I am running 11.10.\n\nA: This occurs when GRUB stage1 runs and is followed eventually by stage2 which also runs but halts without displaying the GRUB menu. It is not a system hang but is a working GRUB shell prompt that is preceded by simple editing instructions.\nWhat I think is happening...\nThe text \"grub> \" (including the trailing space) and the text of the GRUB shell editing instructions can be seen with a binary file editor in the messages section of the binary file /boot/grub/stage2. Those particular pieces of text do not appear in the binary file /boot/grub/stage1 nor any of the stage1.5 image files. So having the boot process abort to this grub> prompt is good circumstantial evidence that stage2 is at least successfully starting. For example, one of the first tasks of stage2 is to read the file /boot/grub/grub.conf to create the GRUB menu. If grub.conf is not found or is corrupted or is badly misconfigured, booting is suspended ending at this GRUB shell command prompt where commands may be entered manually.\nThis situation requires correction of the problem with grub.conf. Re-installing GRUB does nothing for a missing or busted grub.conf file. Nevertheless, other reasons for this event apparently happen and are amenable to simply re-installing GRUB as the first example below demonstrates. Therefore, re-installing GRUB should always be tried for this situation if no obvious problem with the grub.conf file can be found.\nhttp://fedoraforum.org/forum/showthread.php?t=214548\nhttp://fedoraforum.org/forum/showthread.php?t=29835\nhttp://fedoraforum.org/forum/showthread.php?t=150590\nhttp://fedoraforum.org/forum/showthread.php?t=2195\nhttp://fedoraforum.org/forum/showthread.php?t=155361\nhttp://fedoraforum.org/forum/showthread.php?t=195339\n", "Q: Where is the xcompmgr file located?

It can be a little tricky but in no way impossible.\nGood luck :-)\n\nA: (You mentioned you didn't prefer Unity but were looking for any solution so I'll just post it here and let you decide.)\nI too have dual monitors and I set up my windows to be side-side by on each one. Unity has keyboard shortcuts configured to tile windows side by side out of the box that makes this quite easy, since it's only 4 keystrokes to set the entire thing up I haven't investigated automating it.\nHitting Ctrl-Alt-Numpad 4 (has to be the 4 on the number pad on your keyboard) will automatically tile the window to left half of the monitor your mouse is currently on. Similarly Ctrl-Alt-Numpad 6 will tile the window on the right side of the screen.\nSo what I do when I want to set up 4 windows on 2 screens is launch the app, then tile it to where I want to be, then do the 2nd app, then move the next two windows I launch to the other screen, place them, and then I'm good to go.\nIf you want to be even more ninja you can keep tiling windows on halves of screens, as middle clicking on a title will \"send the window back\" behind the one behind it, so you can do 8 (or more apps) with 2 visible on each screen and then alt-tab or middle click to send the window back to get the one behind it visible.\nIf you want to tile with the mouse you can drag a window to the left or right edge and Unity will prompt you to resize the window on the side of that screen, however this can get tricky with multiple monitors as there's no hard edge so you have to kind of move towards the edge until it triggers the resize, which is why I prefer the keyboard to do this quickly.\n(Note that this works \"up and down\" too if you want to tile windows vertically, Ctrl-Alt-Numpad 8 and Ctrl-Alt-Numpad 2 if you want to play with it)\n", "Q: Webcams not detected I've installed ubuntu last version and have problem with webcam, it's invisible for computer, all usb ports are active, but webcam seems to be dead.

Is there any option I can use so that mount points get automatically created if they don't already exist?\n\nA: No, the bare mount utility do not offer such an option.\nIt is done when mounting from a file manager like Nautilus, though.\n\nA: try this:\nif you want to create a Mount Point called DISK1, then type the following command in the terminal :\nsudo mkdir /media/DISK1\n\n\nA: Install the pmount utility and let it handle /media/user/ mount points automatically.  No more worries about how and where /media/user/ devices mount and by which names.\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install pmount\n\nThen whenever you insert a removable device, it will automatically be mounted under /media/username/, by name.  \nFor example:  My USB stick is named \"SYSBKP\" so it automatically mounts as /media/pi/SYSBKP\nIt also handles unexpected ejects.  And remounts.  Silently. \n\n\n*\n\n*Generally, it will pop up file manager to show you what you just\nmounted.\n\n\nBehind the scenes it makes sure the buffers are always flushed just in case the USB is pulled without warning.  No more need for sync;sync;sync like the old days.\n\nFYI, I installed from a 14.04 LTS disk and let it upgrade me to 16.04 LTS when it offered.  On a fresh SSD drive - I let it take the entire space.  \nIn any case, pmount is a very important piece of software to have if you use /media/username/ for removable devices.  \nIf you don't use it, the default action is to create new mount points for each insertion, with a digit appended to the name for each one.  Even normal ejects cause this behavior.  You end up with mount points like /media/username/SYSBKP, /media/username/SYSBKP1, /media/username/SYSBKP2, etc.- and you don't know which one is the active one.\nThis means you can't write scripts that assume the mount point name (unless you include all the mount commands in the script).  Should you choose the wrong one it is treated as a local directory.\npmount makes sure your USB drive it has its own assigned mount point under /media/username/.  In this case, it is always /media/pi/SYSBKP\nIt also works when you put in another USB flash drive with the same name.  So it is not going by UUID. \nI not only use this for flash drives, but also for fulll-size powered backup drives, for rsync backups, and have full confidence that the scripts will work without modification.\nIt is a simple, reliable solution to creating mount points.  \n\nNote that I have personally tested it with NTFS, FAT32 and the various EXT formatted drives.  If the drive contains multiple partitions it will mount regular file systems individually by name, avoiding the swap partition.  This is all visible in nautilus, and is alluded to in more detail in this Q&A:\nhttps://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/82347/win32diskimager-not-enough-space-on-disk-size-62652416-sectors-available-623/82367#82367\n\nI see in comments there is an issue with the NFS+ Time Machine drives.\nIt may or may not work automatically\nHow to access Time Machine Drives in Linux  (macworld.com)\nEXCERPT:\n\nIt turns out Apple does a couple slick things with the file system to\n  make incremental backups work, including hard linking to directories,\n  which isn't allowed in Linux.

I know I can periodically set the permissions of all the files in this folder but I was wondering if there was a way to automate it.\n\nA: You may want to take a look at umask:\n\numask (user mask) is a command and a function in POSIX environments that sets the file mode creation mask of the current process which limits the permission modes for files and directories created by the process. A process may change the file mode creation mask with umask and the new value is inherited by child processes.

The resolution is at 800 x 600 with no other choices in the settings display. Any ideas\n\nA: You can change screen resolution size via CLI , use following cmd:\nxrandr\n\n(It will show you current screen resolution and available modes.\nNow you can change the size by issuing this cmd:\nxrandr --output VGA-0 --mode 1024x768\n\nNote:\n(change the VGA-0 according to what xrandr shows vga syntax for your card, in my example it shows VGA-0)\n\nA: It sounds like you need to check additional drivers and use proprietary drivers.  The reason being -- is that Ubuntu isn't running on your native graphics card.  First you'll need to find out what graphics card you have.  \nOpen up \"Terminal,\" and type: lspci | grep VGA\nOnce you know what video card you have, search for Linux support for that driver and download its support (usually there should be a package that will find your driver and update your system when you install the driver).  This might be risky business because the company you download the support from may not update, potentially causing problems in the future.\nOnce you've made your installation, restart the computer.  You should be able to leave 2D mode and use Ubuntu as you did before you installed it.  Now your resolution should work.\n", "Q: How to display the number of frames per second in mplayer Is there a command (either a command line option, or a navigation command) to display the number of frames per second of the playing movie?\nI am testing to see if my computer is slow (ie running at less than 30 fps) or if the video was sampled poorly.\nNote: I did try to 'google it', but googling for 'mplayer' and 'fps' returns how to set the desired number of frames per second.\n\nA: Sounds as if you are interested in benchmarking, try the -benchmark option.\nFrom the ubuntu man page\n\n-benchmark\n                Prints some statistics on CPU usage and dropped  frames  at  the\n                end  of playback.

Now, I want to upgrade to 11.10 or 12.04. How can I upgrade using Update manager? Will that affect my dual OS boot?\n\nA: If you are managing your dual boot through grub2 i.e. the boot software installed as part of Ubuntu, then upgrading through Update Manager will not affect other operating systems installed.\nIf you have installed boot software through RHEL then this is off-topic for this forum and you should flag this to be moved to Unix & Linux stack forum.\nWith regards to your upgrade to 11.10 from 10.04, you cannot upgrade directly through Update Manager.  You will need to upgrade in steps - 10.04 to 10.10 to 11.04 and finally to 11.10.\nIt is not recommended to move to 12.04 - it is still in early alpha state. \nIf you want to help out the testing effort - upgrade as explained above to 11.10.

I have 1GB of RAM, so many times the system stars crying demanding more swap. I have read the Swap FAQ, but I'm still not sure about how to increase swap size when Ubuntu is installed using Wubi.\n\nA: Just follow the Wubi Guide. While some of the other answers may work, you must make sure you don't create the swap file on the loop mounted device, which may see  decrease in performance.\nSee https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WubiGuide#How_do_I_increase_my_swap_space.3F\n\nHow do I increase my swap space?\nThe following will increase your swap to 2 GB.

However, there's no rule that says that you need to use a swap partition. You can use a swap file, as well, and store it anywhere you like on the system. I'd likely choose /media, but it's up to you. Here's how:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create your extra swap file and set the appropriate permissions. You can put it anywhere you like. Set the size equal to how much additional swap space you want.\nsudo fallocate -l 1g /path/to/desired/file\nsudo chmod 600 /path/to/desired/file\n\n\n*Format your swap file:\nsudo mkswap /path/to/desired/file\n\n\n*Add it to /etc/fstab:\ngksudo gedit /etc/fstab\n\nInsert this at the bottom of the file:\n/path/to/swap/file  none  swap  sw  0 0\n\n\n*Enable all swap, including your new swap file:\nsudo swapon -a\n\nI took much of my answer from the Swap FAQ. Scroll down to the part that talks about swap files.\n\nA: I think that here they explain how you can do that in a easy way. I don't know how exactly wubi works so I'm guessing you want to add a file as a swap.

With my HP, I've been running great from last December on the different Ubuntus that were made available over this year. But it would seem, that since 11.10 (although I am not quite sure, it started around 10th November), I have the odd temperature problem, stopping my computer from responding and just going into a full-on fan-run - and the only way out is to hard-reboot the PC. \nNow I know this sounds like a hardware issue. This is also why I sent in the PC to HP, and after a month of repairs, the only thing HP has done is reinstall their Win7 mix, filled with ads, but I wasn't all sure. \nSo I tried not to complain too much, and reinstalled Ubuntu, but less than a day into it, the PC started shutting down again if used \"normally\"... Chrome and Skype at the same time for example. I also decided to have a test with Win7, which I left in Dual, and there, it doesn't seem to be a problem, even if I open quite a few more programs to fiddle with...\nI installed 2 bits to measure temperature, and it would seem that at around 62-63, it shuts down.\nMy question (finally) would be if there is any way to change the maximum temperature (unless 63° was a normal max temperature), or a way to reduce energy consumption in some way so that it doesn't force me to reboot the moment I use 2 programs...\nThanks a bunch for your help!\nbisi\n\nA: You cannot change the maximum temperature for hardware components.\nHere is a list of useful application indicators for Ubuntu 11.10.\nYou should install CPUFreq (to manually lock your CPU to a lower value, to be sure your temperatures are not growing) and Hardware Sensors Indicator (to see the many temperatures of your system components).\n\nA: Your best option is to go ahead and unplug your box, open it up, and clean it out, including any dust from the fan intake / output.\nYour computer is shutting down because excessive heat can damage the cpu.\nIf cleaning does not fix the problem, check with your local computer repair shop or if you have a LUG (Linux Users Group). You may need to replace the fan or replace the CPU paste / heat sink.\nBottom line, I would resolve the hardware problem rather then looking for a software solution to keep your box running hot.\n\nA: You may be able to set the shutdown temperature in the BIOS. That said, I agree with bodhi.zazen that something else seems to be amiss, you should give the computer a thorough cleaning and ensure the fans are working correctly. If the fans are completely stopped (I've seen fans caked with dust that just can't spin anymore) it's even worse, because the power supply is still feeding power to the fan, which gets readily converted to heat instead of motion, thus compounding the problem.\n\nA: I had the same problems with a 64 bit Ubuntu 11.10, my desktop kept on shutting down on his own. Googling for this topic I found some possible causes for this overheat (ATI driver and flash). I partially solved my problem by installing ATI proprietary drivers and the 64 bit flash plugin. The temperature is still high (it goes from 62° to 74° Celsius!!) but, till now, no more shutdowns.  \n", "Q: How do I use command line arguments in bash?

I noticed this on a multiple of Ubuntu boxes I own.\nA reboot is the only solution I found. What's the reason behind this? \nEDIT: a bit more info about my laptop: Dell Studio 1558, Intel i5, 8GB DDR3 Ram, 7200 rpm HDD\n\nA: This is indeed a typical situation and the most likely cause is memory swapping. Look at the memory usage.\nYour resource-hungry task A has probably used a significant amount of RAM. Consequently, an other application B has been swapped to disk. The CPU can quickly change it context back from A to B, you should not feel any delays caused the CPU load after quitting A. However, application B is no longer completely hold in physical RAM. Thus, a trivial tasks inside A may require loading the memory used by application A back into the physical RAM.\nA similar situation occurs when the the resource-hungry task reads and writes many/large files from/to the HDD since Linux generally uses memory to cache disk I/O. (That means, task A will quit before the files have been committed to the physical HDD. The slow writing process is delayed until Linux needs to free memory for other applications.)\nBoth processes (swapping and disk caching) are I/O-bound (limited by your HDD read/write rate, not the CPU). However, they may cause a certain computational overhead.\nTheoretically, some time after quitting A, application B should automatically come back to normal speed. Instead of rebooting it may help to restart application B. \n\nA: There are several likely causes for this. If you have a single core processor and relatively low RAM this is even more likely to happen.\nWhat is probably happening is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your system begins to use swap when the RAM becomes overloaded, it might be \"thrashing\" (dumping RAM to the disk) before you close the heavy applications, and then has a hard time recovering.\n\n*You might be experiencing high levels of I/O wait (the processor waiting on a response).\n\n*The heavy applications you quit be getting cleaned up. The best thing to do is to leave the system for a bit - and wait for it to recover.\n\n\nA: Tweaking the swappiness value might help if your system is swapping too aggressively. It won't help if you're actually running out of memory and the kernel is forced to swap, but if you have enough memory and the kernel is starting to swap unnecessarily, it can.\nSee the Ubuntu SwapFaq. Excerpt below:\n\nThe swappiness parameter controls the tendency of the kernel to move processes out of physical memory and onto the swap disk. Because disks are much slower than RAM,  this can lead to slower response times for system and applications if processes are  too aggressively moved out of memory.\n\n*\n\n*swappiness can have a value of between 0 and 100\n\n*swappiness=0 tells the kernel to avoid swapping processes out of physical memory for as long as possible\n\n*swappiness=100 tells the kernel to aggressively swap processes out of physical memory and move them to swap cache\n\nThe default setting in Ubuntu is swappiness=60. Reducing the default value of swappiness will probably improve overall performance for a typical Ubuntu desktop installation. A value of swappiness=10 is recommended, but feel free to experiment. Note: Ubuntu server installations have different performance requirements to desktop systems, and the default value of 60 is likely more suitable.\n\n\nA: There is a similar question about consuming all memory here.\nAs one answered, \n\nIt seems that once Ubuntu starts using swap, it doesn't release RAM easily even after the operation is finished.\n\nTo force system to release everything in swap partition back to memory, there are many similar answers to do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disk operations consuming all memory - Ask Ubuntu\n\n*What command can be used to force release everything in swap partition back to memory? - Unix & Linux Stack Exchange\n\n*Is it safe to turn swap off permanently? - Ask Ubuntu\nAccording to the answers above, you can clear swap by:\nsudo swapoff -a\nsudo swapon -a\n\nThis disables swap during which anything in swap is transferred in RAM and re-enables it. Computer's performance should be back to normal now.\nFor more information about swapoff and swapon, see the man page in the following link:\nUbuntu Manpage: swapon, swapoff -  enable/disable  devices  and  files for paging and swapping\n", "Q: Toshiba P755 S5260 Keyboard LED backlight won't light up I have a Toshiba Satellite p755-s5260 with the LED backlit keyboard with shortcut keys above the keyboard that are also supposed to light up.

The output of this command should look\n  something like this:\nCommand (m for help): p\n\nDisk /dev/sda: 130 MB, 130023424 bytes \n16 heads, 32 sectors/track, 496 cylinders \nUnits = cylinders of 512 * 512 = 262144 bytes\n\n   Device   Boot    Start         End      Blocks   Id  System \n   /dev/sda1   *        1         496      126960    6  FAT16\n\nAgain, for this example, we will just delete all of the existing\n  partitions so now type “d” at the command prompt. Then enter the\n  number of the partition you wish to delete. Repeat this process for\n  each partition on your USB Stick until they are all deleted.

If i can take backup, what are the files i need to copy? Can someone explain it in detail pls. Thanks in advance.\n\nA: Responding to SSH only... yes, you can keep your keys. \nI can't think of any topic on which to expound about that, though. It is straight forward: if your username is karthick, then the keys are located in a hidden directory here: \n/home/karthick/.ssh\n\nor\n~/.ssh\n\nThe id_rsa.pub file contains the public key used to authenticate. But there are other files to keep - all of them, really, such as known_hosts for example. The MOST IMPORTANT is id_rsa (note the lack of .pub) as this is your private key. Back up each user. For example, if you set up SSH for root, get /root/.ssh as well. And so on for as many accounts as you have for this reason.\n\nA: Cryptographic keys which you may want to backup.\n\n\n*\n\n*~/.gnupg/*\n\n*~/.pki/nssdb/*\n\n*~/.gnome2/keyrings/*\n\n*~/.ssh/*\n\n*/usr/local/apache2/conf/ssl.crt/server.crt\n\n*/usr/local/apache2/conf/ssl.key/server.key\n\n*/etc/ssh/*\n\n*/etc/ssl/private/*\n\n*/etc/cups/ssl/*\n\nA: Each user has a directoy ~/.ssh, which typically contains the following files:\n1) id_dsa             private key of this user (different filename for rsa keys)\n1) id_dsa.pub         public key of this user\n2) authorized_keys    public key of other users (or same user on other machines)\n   config             personal configuration\n   known_hosts        host keys of other machines\n\nAdditionally, in /etc/ssh/, you will find:\n3) ssh_host_dsa_key\n3) ssh_host_dsa_key.pub\n3) ssh_host_rsa_key\n3) ssh_host_rsa_key.pub\n\nThose are the host keys, keys identifying this computer.\nYou certainly want to backup all private and public keys. We call the machine in question home and the user user@home. Same person has an account user@remote and uses key-based login in both directions. What would happen if you loose any of the key files:\n\n\n*\n\n*You loose the identity of user@home. ssh user@remote from home will no longer work with key based auth.\n\n*user@remote loose the right to login to home with his key. ssh user@home will no longer work from remote with key based auth.\n\n*You loose the identity of the host. user@remote will see a warning that host keys have changed when trying ssh user@home.

If you set it to \"access\" it will create one connection per URI type (which I understand to mean, one for http, one for ftp, and so on - since most connections are http, this means it'll access each server sequentially).\nOne way to do this that will also apply to update-manager is to:\necho 'Acquire::Queue-Mode \"access\";' >/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/75download\n\nif you want to try it with apt-get once to see if it helps:\napt-get -o Acquire::Queue-mode=access update\n\nThe Acquire::http::Dl-Limit option\nThis is similarly to reduce the bandwidth used to something your connection can handle (and as per the manpage, \"this option implicit deactivates the download from multiple servers at the same time\").\necho 'Acquire::http::Dl-Limit \"70\";' >/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/75download\n\nor\napt-get -o Acquire::http::Dl-Limit=70 update\n\n\nA: Rather than using the update manager try sudo apt-get update&&sudo apt-get upgrade in the terminal\nIt would get the job done and also does not use parallel connections\n\nA: Right click in the window area that lists the updates > Deselect All, then enable individually.

Since neither VLC stable / VLC nightly builds / Totem with Coherence Plugin work properly in oneiric I'm searching for an alternative to watch media streamed from my seagate dockstar using minidlna as a server.\nThe only client that works is XBMC, but that's much of an overkill and stops me from doing other tasks. Atm I'm working around this with samba shares, but it baffles me that both a Playstation 3 and Windows 7 Laptop work better together with my debian based media server than my linux desktop in this regard.\n\nA: Recently VLC Version 2.0 was released. This Release features a fully functional UPNP / DLNA Player that works without bugs. I'm using it on Ubuntu and Archlinux and it works just fine with my minidlna player.\nTo use VLC start the Playlist (View -> Playlist; Ctrl + L) and then select Local Network -> Universal Plug 'n' Play. However, be advised that VLCs implementation first downloads all the library information before you can select anything. Depending on the size of the library that actually might take several minutes and longer.\n\nA: After having tested now rythmbox, banshee (+rygel), xmbc, gstreamer/pulse  and a lot of other different upnp related software, i concluded that the only well working linux program is foobar with wine. \nusing it now on ubuntu 13.10 (with wine 1.6) and it works like a charm. all other linux based software did lack the \"play to\" feature known from media player or apple air.\nhowever, the foobar ui is something you need to get used to. but now I really like it.\n\nA: I got this problem recently and created a simple dlna browser, I use it like this:\n$ simple-dlna-browser -s 192.168.1.254 contacto | xargs mplayer\n\nI took minidlna 1.1.4-2 as a reference, so it may not work with other media servers.\n\nA: First make sure that server is running fine. Then you can use djmount for upnp client. I don't know djmount is in the repo or not (I don't use ubuntu now). Install djmount & fuse.\nmake a mount point in /media\ncd /media\nsudo mkdir upnp\nsudo chmod 777 upnp\n\nYou can give any name other than upnp\nThen load fuse and mount the filesystem\nsudo modprobe fuse\nsudo djmount -o allow_other /media/upnp\n\nYou may have to restart the server. eg if you are running mediatomb\nsudo /etc/init.d/mediatomb restart\n\nThen browse to /media/upnp\nHowever there is some problem. You have to remount it after every reboot.\n\nA: eezUPnP\n\nJava based application - download the zip file (32bit or 64bit) and run ./CP in the extracted folder.\nObviously you need a JAVA JRE to be installed.\nBe patient for the media servers to be recognised...\n\nA: I usually use this bash:\n#!/bin/bash\n\ncd\nif [ ! -d upnp ]; then\nmkdir upnp; chmod 777 upnp\nsudo modprobe fuse\nsudo djmount -o allow_other upnp/\nxdg-open upnp\nelse\nsudo fusermount -u upnp\nrmdir upnp\necho umount upnp and rmdir\nfi\n\nbut djmount crashed, in 14.04. \n\nA: Accepted answer doesn't work anymore, since this seemed to have broken in VLC 3+. djmount is also abandoned.\nBut you might not know (like me!) that Totem (the Gnome \"Videos\" player) will actually surf around upnp and can show videos from there. Go to \"Channels\" and you can click around.\nIf you want to listen to music, Rhythmbox has a DLNA-plugin.\n", "Q: How do I install Clang Version 3 in 10.10? How would I go about installing version 3 of Clang/LLVM in Ubuntu 10.10? Ubuntu 10.10 installs version 2.8 by default.

I know that I could possibly compile from source but was wondering if there is a ppa or other method to avoid compiling it from source.\nIf I compile from source do I have to tell it where to find the std c library etc. or is that automatically done.\n\nA: I haven't found a PPA for maverick - you will need a later version of ubuntu to get v3.\nHowever, to compile is very straightforward.  Clang themselves have the instructions well written.  A few pointers:\nYou will need the following packages to be installed before you compile\nsudo apt-get install build-essential subversion\n\nStart at the second instruction \"2.

That or just open the sites you want to pin one at a time to see which cookies get set. Then pin them all and set your cookie policies.  From there, you can go back to manually whitelisting or use the Cookies Manager Plus Add-On to do it for you. For example, I've used these in the past to identify and whitelist the Google two-factor authentication cookie that remembers you for 30 days, while still deleting all other cookies when I close Firefox.\n\nA: Use Biscuit extension for Firefox.

If you want to do it systemwide, you can change the value in /etc/login.defs. If you want to do it on a per-user basis, do it in each user's .profile.\nYou can check the current umask by giving the command \"umask\" with no parameters. It may output something like this:\n0002\nWith this value, files you create will be readable and writable for you and your group, while being only readable for all others. If you want to create files that are world-writable (a discussion on the security implications of this is out of scope here) change the umask to 0000:\numask 000\nas I mentioned, to change this persistently for your user, edit .profile, uncomment the line containing \"umask 022\" and change the value accordingly.\nRead an excellent explanation of what the umask values mean in Wikipedia:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umask\n\nA: Glad you got it solved.\nThe /var/www directory has the \"set group id\" or \"setgid\" bit turned on (the \"s\" in drwxrwsr-x). So when new files are created inside /var/www, the files will be owned by the directory's group and not the user's group.

Is that possible ?\nIn other words , I need to connect the two hard disks . \n\nA: Format the new drive to ext4 with gparted or any tool you wish.\nThen mount the partition at /mnt (or any location you choose)\nsudo mount /dev/sbb1 /mnt\nsudo chown your_user:your_user /mnt\n\nThen put the kernel source in /mnt\nmkdir /mnt/src\ntar xjvf linux-source-2.6.22.tar.bz2 -C /mnt/src\n\nThen proceed with your build.\nNote: you should run make as follows, it will make the modules.\nmake -j5\n\nYou then use sudo to install\nsudo make modules_install\n\nFWIW there are a number of helper scripts, see\nUbuntu Wiki compile kernel\nObviously there are a number of considerations in building a custom kernel, good luck to you.\nEDIT: To merge 2 hard drives, use LVM. You will not be able to do LVM as your original install is not to LVM, so mounting the new drive is the best option.\n\nA: Instead of adding a second virtual drive, just expand the size of the original one.  To use the added space, you will need to boot the live cd and use gparted to expand the partition.  If you have a swap partition you may need to move it over to make room to expand the root partition.\n", "Q: How to install into existing LVM logical volumes I have a Debian Squeeze install, and I'd like to switch to Ubuntu 11.10.\nIn my current setup, I have 2 HDDs, the first 250GB and the second 500GB.\nThe 250GB drive just has a NTFS partition with Win7 on it.\nThe 500GB drive has 397GB of NTFS, 1GB ext3 which I'm using as the /boot partition, and the rest in an extended partiton contaning an LVM2 partition which is the only physical vomume in my LVM volume group.\nLogical volumes are as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*home - 46GB, mount point /home\n\n*rd - 18.62GB, mount point /\n\n*swap - 2.79GB\n\n\nI'd like to install ubuntu into the existing boot partition and rd logical volume. The installed doesn't seem to understand LVM.\nHow do I do this?\n\nA: Easiest way, IMO, is to use the alternate CD, the desktop or live CD does not support LVM.\nThe alternate CD does not run \"live\", but the installer is easy enough if you are migrating from debian.\nEdit - small clarification, you can install lvm when running the desktop CD, and you can then mount your LVM, but I do not think the installer, ubiquity, supports LVM.\nYou could use the live CD , install LVM, then install ubuntu manually into a chroot, but probably (for most) more hassle then the alternate CD.\n\nA: There is another way to install ubuntu 11.10. Instead of having to download the alternate iso, just make your existing logical volumes active using the command vgchange -ay. Needless to say, this does require you to install lvm2 first. Basically run the terminal while installing ubuntu 11.10 and make your logical volumes active . After that, the installer will recognize the volumes while scanning the disks and you can select the LV to which you want to install ubuntu. Hope that helps in the future.\n\nA: Tried this guide too and still Ubuntu 11.10 would not boot http://www.debuntu.org/how-to-install-ubuntu-over-lvm-filesystem\nFinally tried to use ubuntu alternate installer with /boot partition separate from the volume groups and was finally able to make it work.\n", "Q: How do I get rid of the groups in the contact list in Empathy?

After ZZ minutes after the last attempt to connect, the rule must allow the same source to retry its attempt as if it had never attempted to reconnect before.\n\n\n*\n\n*I assume this has to be written as a new chain rule. \n\n*I assume the chain rule has to be saved to iptables, so that the rule is resumed\nat reboot.\n\n*I assume the chain rule needs some kind of logging.\n\n\nMy problem is that I don't understand the iptables syntax disregarding how much I study it, and hence I'm grateful for the shortest \"script type\" answer on this question\n\nA: Well, to be honest, there is a bit of a learning curve to iptables.\nFirst, you can use ufw to start. ubw is a powerful command line tool and the advantage is the syntax is similar to iptables.\nsudo ufw enable\nsudo ufw limit 22\n\nHere I am limiting port 22, you can use any port you wish.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/11.10/serverguide/C/firewall.html\nAgain the advantage is ufw will automate much of this and ease your learning process.\nIf you want to use iptables, you at a minimum need to learn to save and restore your rules.\nsudo iptables-save > /etc/iptables.save\nsudo iptables-restore /etc/iptables.save\n\nYou can edit /etc/iptables.save, the syntax is straight forward enough.\nWhen trying rules from remote, use iptables-apply to prevent a lockout\nsudo iptables-apply /etc/iptables.save\n\nTo restore your rules on boot, one of several methods is to add this to /etc/rc.local\niptables-restore /etc/iptables.save\n\nOther options listed in the Ubuntu iptables wiki page (see below).\nThe iptables syntax is\niptables -I INPUT -p tcp -m state --state NEW -m limit --limit 30/minute --limit-burst 5 -j ACCEPT\n\nTo LOG, add a LOG, but unless you are going to monitor your logs, use snort. logging iptables, IMO, is more helpful for debugging.\nSee man iptables, Ubuntu wiki iptables\nSome people find my iptables web page helpful to start.\nTo answer your comment, see these rules\niptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 22 -m tcp -m state --state NEW -m recent --set --name SSH --rsource\n\niptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 22 -m recent --update --seconds 600 --hitcount 8 --rttl --name SSH --rsource -j DROP\n\niptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT\n\nhttp://kevin.vanzonneveld.net/techblog/article/block_brute_force_attacks_with_iptables/\nThe caveat is , it depends on the service. ssh is configured to allow so many attempts at password authentication 9see /etc/ssh/sshd_config ), so each connection gives 6 password attempts.\n", "Q: How to run javascript/html page I want to know what is the terminal command for compiling and executing Javascript/HTML.\nIs it the same as that of compilation of C program or is it different?\n\nA: HTML is a markup language which is interpreted by a web browser.

I switched from the default driver to fglrx recently so a certain app would stop crashing.  After a while I got my dual monitor system to work, except the right monitor (Acer) shows the whole desktop shunken about 90%.  There's an unused margin of an inch or so all around.   \nBoth monitors are 23\", identical for functional purposes but different brands.   Both are displaying at 1920x1080 and show the entire desktop.  Left monitor, which shows the whole desktop raster filling the physical LCD area, is an AOC plugged in by DVI.  The right monitor is an Acer plugged in by HDMI.  It's not possible right now to wrestle these around to see the labels on back; exact models unknown.  Both are plugged into an ATI Radeon HD 5450.  \nCatalyst Control Center says it's version 2.13, Catalyst version 11.8.\nUsing XUbuntu  11.10, maybe a week or two not up to date.

Nope, except Unity made the right monitor all back except for the cursor.  \n\nA: With some more digging around in Catalyst Control Center, I found the \"Adjustments\" tab for each monitor has a Scaling Options slider.   This allowed me to resize the raster on the one monitor.

I've read about VDPAU and how it enables mplayer to have Hardware acceleration. But i also read that it's only for Nvidia cards \nHow can i enable it on a non Nvidia card (mine it's a AMD but i would like to enable this in an Intel netbook too)? and will this work for other video players? \n\nA: VDPAU is a programming interface (API) to allow offloading of graphics rendering to the Graphics Chipset rather than handling by the CPU itself.\nIt is opensource - produced initially by Nvidia themselves and supported on most of their current Graphics Cards.\nWikipedia has an excellent article on this:\n\nS3 Graphics added support for VDPAU to the Linux drivers of its Chrome\n  400 video cards since version 14.02.17 of its device driver for Linux,\n  it supports the S3 Chrome 430 GT, S3 Chrome 440 GTX, S3 Chrome 530 GT\n  and the S3 Chrome 540 GTX hardware.\nIntel and ATI currently offer no support for VDPAU. Nvidia hopes these\n  GPU designers will support the open source VDPAU library and provide\n  drivers with VDPAU acceleration by mentioning example names of\n  hardware specific drivers for Intel and ATI: libvdpau_intel.so and\n  libvdpau_ati.so.\n\nIntel currently support their own rival API called VA-API.\nATI/Radeon are concentrating their efforts on their Catalyst Drivers - again they have their own API called XVBA but is only supported through their Catalyst Drivers.\nPhoronix over the last few months have been reporting the development of another API called the Gallium 3D State Tracker - this is intended to unify the main chipsets - Intel, ATI/Radeon and NVidia.  In simple terms (as far as I understand it) - it tries to overlay an API ontop of VA-API, VDPAU etc.  Thus you program to the Gallium API and it will translate this to the rival APIs for you.\nMuch of this is bleeding edge code - unstable and you will often have to compile code etc to keep up with the latest developments.  The X-Edgers PPA is a good source of latest developments - an article here described installing the opensource radeon driver and forcing the use of Gallium3D. \nBack to topic... as you can see, graphics in linux is currently fractured (some call it a mess!) - thus the best solutions at the moment is to use media players that attempt to implement the rival API's such as MPlayer.\n\nUPDATE\nThe above was the past ... 2011\nAt the present 2015, VDPAU is supported by intel and amd as well as archWiki page stats\nYou should install the following package for intel\nsudo apt-get install libvdpau-va-gl1 i965-va-driver\n\nbut looks there is an open bug on Ubuntu 14.04 and on 14.10 as well, so the lib is not found ... so for ex. vlc through the following error:\nFailed to open VDPAU backend i965_drv_video.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n\nThere is a workaround in the bug page, I'm not coping it here because even if I apply it the video is not playing in vlc ( looks the library is broken )\n\nA: for long time I suffered bad flash player performance on my intel based notebook. After time passed I decided to put effort on it and created wrapper library that implements  VDPAU interface by means of OpenGL. On systems with VA-API available (like one I have) it also accelerates video decoding. There is one-half or one-third of whole VDPAU functionality implemented, but that's enough to make both flash player and mplayer work.\nYou can find code at github: https://github.com/i-rinat/libvdpau-va-gl\n", "Q: How do I make sure that I have received a fix for a bug?

If you're lucky, you may get a description of the fix too. Hopefully the owner of your PPA is providing this information as well, but that's not always guaranteed. If not, your only option might be to ask the PPA maintainer.\nYou can check which version of a package you are running by using dpkg:\ndpkg -l <packagename>\n\nIf you want to get into the fine details, you can download the source for the package with:\napt-get source <packagename>\n\nand inspect the code yourself.\n", "Q: Gnome Shell freezes up Ubuntu 11.10 So basically, I'm trying to get Ubuntu all set up, it installs no problem and works just fine.

It is a link to a php site which takes the a path to the video as an argument. This path however might as well be local on the remote server. Usually this is done to prevent you from doing what you intended to do. You can only try to run the link on your mac again and see whether there is a real URL in the site sent to you by the server.

For a long time, I've had my keyboard configured to use the layout currently known as \"English (international AltGr dead keys).\" I like this layout because without any modifier keys, it's identical to the US English keyboard, but when I hold Right Alt I can get accented letters and other characters not available on a standard US English keyboard.\nIn Oneiric, however, the layout is messed up. Right Alt+N produces \"ñ\" as expected. And another method works: Right Alt+`, E produces \"è\", also as expected. But there's no way to type \"é\", which is probably the accented letter I type the most. I expect Right Alt+A, E to do the trick. But instead of a dead key for the acute accent, it uses a method for combining characters to create the hybrid \"́e\". This hybrid looks like the proper \"é\" in some settings, but it isn't the same character and doesn't always work. (For example, in the text input box as I type this, it looks the same as the proper character, but when displayed on the site for all so see, it looks very wrong--at least on my machine.) Ditto for all other characters with an acute accent, though some are available directly as pre-composed characters: For example, Right Alt+I yields \"í\".\nHow can I change the acute accent on the A key to a proper dead key? Perhaps the more general version of this is: How can I tweak my keyboard layout?\nUpdate\nI just tested this on my other machine, also running Oneiric, but upgraded from previous versions. I have no problems with the second machine. The problem machine was a fresh install of Oneiric, but I kept my old $HOME when I did the fresh install.\nClarification\nEven if an answer doesn't address my specific examples, I would still accept it if it provided enough detail for me to find the layout and tweak it according to my needs.\nMajor Update\nAfter working through the information gained through Jim C's and Chascon's helpful replies, I've learned something new: The problem isn't with the layout itself, but with the fact that the selected layout isn't being applied. When I look at the definition in /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/us of the layout I've been running for a long time, I found that the definition doesn't match what I get when I type. In addition, the keyboard layout dialog that's supposed to show the current layout looks different from the way the layout is defined in the file I mentioned, and matches what actually happens when I type.\nFollowing Jim C's suggestion, I created a new layout in /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/us containing some modifications to the layout I want. I can select my layout from the keyboard properties, and I can use in on the console following Chascon's post, but the layout I get when typing is unchanged.\nApparently, there's a different layout defined somewhere that's overriding what I've set. Where is that layout hiding?\nThis problem occurs in Unity (3D and 2D), but I was able to get the correct layout set in Xfce.\nIn case it's relevant, this problem has occurred since I installed Oneiric fresh on this machine (though I preserved my $HOME). I don't recall whether this problem occurred before the reinstall.\nAlso, in case it's relevant, I also run iBus so I can type Korean. I have a few difficulties with iBus, but I doubt they're related.\n\nA: I'll tell you what eventually worked best for me.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the gnome preference \"keyboard layout\" pane\n\n*Move the layout order, if you have more than one\n\n*Delete all layouts except the default one (mine was a US layout)\n\n\nThe previous two steps have been suggested as fixes on their own (on the Ubuntu forums?). They did not work for me. I tried them together consecutively and this again did not work for me. Thus my next step.\n\n\n*\n\n*Press, \"Reset to Defaults\"\n\n*Layout changes effectuated from both the layout pane and indicator now result in a change in layout.\n\n*Of course, add layouts back before attempting to change to them. Use the preview function to find a layout that easily produces the diacritical marks you seek.\n\n\nI think my problem was from the fact that some of the layouts had changed in name, at least that's my take considering that the layout names weren't exactly what I expected when reassigning them. Deleting my extra layouts and then assigning new ones from a fresh list seems to have circumvented my issues, that being that the layouts of my choice now point to existing layouts with names to match.\n\nA: You should be able to run the following to reselect your keyboard.\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration\n\nIf it doesn't stick, you'll probably need to change /etc/default/keyboard. I think I have your keyboard and my pertinent file shows the following, running through an old IBM clone 104 keyboard.\nXKBMODEL=\"pc104\"\nXKBLAYOUT=\"us\"\nXKBVARIANT=\"intl\"\nXKBOPTIONS=\"terminate:ctrl_alt_bksp\"\n\nSo do that with gksudo gedit /etc/default/keyboard or however kids are editing files these days. Read pertinent info here for what to plug in.\nI see  sudo udevadm trigger --subsystem-match=input --action=change is suggested elsewhere herein.\nIf that doesn't work, your layout is probably corrupt or just wrong, and I can't be sure what would help but I would try reinstalling xkb-data, iso-codes.\nPerhaps updating your locale since language and layouts are intertwined. See this but something like:\ndpkg-reconfigure locales \nupdate-locale LANG=en_US.UTF-8\n\nI guess I should mention that I've made good use of \"English International AltGr dead keys\" layout, if you're looking for dead keys. I don't know what the /etc/default/keyboard file would reflect for this one but googling would surely bring an answer, but first try adding it via the Keyboard Layout pane. Warning, there seems to be a limit of 4 before you can't add any more.\nOther than that I'd point you towards xmodmap. It's capable of overriding layout defaults. Let me know if any, or which ones help.\nWhat languages are you writing other than English? Spanish (because of the ñ)? and?\n\nA: I am not certain this will help you, but when I asked this question of a German co-worker of mine (who also uses Ubuntu) he sent me this link:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1654199&highlight=.Xmodmap\nAs I am unfamiliar with keyboard layout definitions, I can't be certain it will work for you but I thought I'd send it along just in case.\nBest of luck in solving this!\n\nA: I'm just wondering what happens if you modify or create a ~/.dmrc as in:\n[Desktop]\nLanguage=de_DE.UTF-8   # change to your default lang\nLayout=de   nodeadkeys # change to your keyboard layout\n\nAnd then run:\nsudo udevadm trigger --subsystem-match=input --action=change\n\nSource:\nPermanently change keyboard layout\n\nA: There's a bug in ibus that causes it to not use the system default layout by default.\nTry setting ibus preferences->advanced->keyboard layout->use system keyboard layout to on.  If it's already set to on, or if setting it to on doesn't help, post a comment and I'll continue looking into it for you.\n\nA: I found a How-To that confirms that dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration should work. \n\nwrites the /etc/default/keyboard file, which is read by HAL and X, for the console and graphic setup. If you want to apply changes you must restart HAL.\n\nSo it writes to /etc/default/keyboard and it's supposed to setup X and console considering that both read that file. You have to restart HAL though, and I don't think that's been mentioned.\nAssuming Ubuntu isn't veering away too far from Debian, if you notice that /etc/default/keyboard is being written to (reflects the layout you want after running dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration), but there's no change in the layout implemented, then the problem is with the system not picking up on it. Obviously, if it's not being written to, then dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration is at fault (at least in this instance). And if it gets written to but doesn't stick on reboots, then you need to ID the culprit or process that is awry.\nSomeone more familiar with the insides of Debian/Ubuntu should be able to ID the possible culprits from the above scenario.\nI'd like to add that I've had a similar problem and selecting the layout from lightdm actually works. So another way to get at it is to find out what lightdm is writing to when selecting a layout.\nLastly, try restarting HAL after running dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration. I've never done this manually but I imagine something such as the following might work.\n/etc/init.d/hal restart\n\n\nA: I had this problem / here  was my solution.\n1. remove the keyboard layout.\n2. add the layout back\n3. make sure 3rd layer is set to Right Alt\n\n\nthen test Right Alt + backtick  ->  Shift + E = È & Right Alt + Shift + i = Í\nalso if this does not work remove and or reinstall xkb-data\n", "Q: Working with remote dekstop? I am running an Ubuntu 11.10 virtual machine under KVM hypervisor, bridged, and connected to the local network.

When you initially start the session vncserver executes this script:\n.vnc/xstartup\n\nyou need to edit that and tell VNC server what desktop session you want it to start for you. For example, to get gnome session you would add something like this to the script:\n# Start a GNOME desktop\nexec gnome-session &\n\nJust a side note, since I discovered SSH with XServer forwarding I have not been using VNC. In most cases (at least for me) forwarding one particular application that I work on to my desktop works much nicer than transferring the whole desktop environment from one machine to another. \n", "Q: For a newbie, what software/ IDE is best to build a website? \nPossible Duplicate:\nBasic Web Development IDE/Editor like Dreamweaver? \n\nWhat software would you recommend for a newbie (not much experience in HTML code) to develop websites?

You could follow bkzland's instructions and stop your those two NTFS drives (Windows partition & Recovery Partition) from auto-mounting on startup, if they do. \nAnother viable option using the fstab file is to limit the permissions of who can access/edit the two partitions. You could take a look at the Ubuntu Community Documentation on fstab to achieve any of these solutions.\nJust to prevent other users from touching those partitions from the Nautilus side-bar, you could follow the instructions on this page and also this thread at UbuntuForums.org to do that. I haven't tested either of them myself personally, but just saying that you could.

From Oneiric onwards it seems that some of the dependency locations have changed.  specifically the libQtCore.so (and a couple other QT libs).  All the legacy versions of the application build but Oneiric and Precise have failed to build from the old recipe.  I can deal with this locally because I can change the library location in the rules file.  \nI was wondering how best to deal with this in my ppa.  Should I have a separate debian file in its own repo that is specific for the release, get the recipe to pull the debian file and merge when its time to build?  Then have separate recipe for each distro?\nOr can I deal with this in the recipe directly. \nOr is there a better way that I haven't thought of.\nThanks \n\nA: Technically you could add a run line to your recipe to execute some script that performs the substitution in the debian/rules file depending on the target distribution. However, that would work only when running bzr build locally because run isn't supported in launchpad as noted here (I guess that's because of security concerns).\nHence, my advice is to have two different recipes pointing to different branches for the packaging files and launch each recipe for the appropriate distributions.\n", "Q: Difference between kernel source code (kernel.org) and linux-source (in software center) What is the difference between kernel code downloaded from http://www.kernel.org and the one downloaded from Software Center linux-source package?\nWhich one is better for writing a device driver?\n\nA: The Ubuntu kernel has a number of patches to tweak it.

I can clearly tell it happens in eclipse, but other apps might have the same problem. After some time they start working normally (after switching windows/workspaces may be).\nIt's not fatal, but really annoying. Is there some way to fix it?\nI've looked at this question with similar problem, but answers doesn't seem to provide universal solution.\n\nA: Seems like I've figured it out - looks like the problem was caused by having non-english keyboard layout enabled (wonder how I missed that out in the first place). \nSo solution (for Eclipse) is to go to Window->Preferences->General->Keys and add mappings for other layout that is used (this might look a little bit confusing, since different letters might look the same in different languages (like Russian В and English B)).\np.s. What's interesting is that Chromium for example doesn't have this problem - might have already enabled mappings for different languages or just handles keys differently.\n", "Q: Is there a straight forward 3D sketch tool capable of producing wireframe vector images? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to render 3D models as SVG vector graphics? (planar projection) \n\nInkscape features a nice mode to create isometric projections of three dimensional images. The results can be exported nicely as SVG or PDF. For many applications this is preferable over a rendered bitmap image (as produced by Blender, POVray, etc.).\nAlso, vector graphics appear more technical and less playful, which looks more professional depending on the context. And finally, vector graphics are more suitable for post-processing.\nHowever, Inkscape's axonometric grid method has a number of disadvantages:\n\n\n*\n\n*The viewpoint is fixed. Once, you have setup the grid, it is not possible to rotate the scene.\n\n*I cannot figure out how to draw a sphere.\n\n*Inkscape has no concept of front and back, so you have to manually hide or dash lines that would be invisible. (Or use opaque objects and manually get the order right.)\n\n*Inkscape doesn't have any concept of three dimensional space at all. The whole thing remains a 2D vector graphic, which if well-done creates a three-dimensional impression.\n\n\nIs there something like Inkscape in 3D, where I can work with 3D objects, and create the isometric view from the 3D model. To clarify: Technically, I want a simple 2D vector graphic (preferably as SVG), that looks 3D to the human eye. Apparently Google SketchUp can produce such graphics (as PDF, which can be converted to SVG). Here is an example. I want to draw arbitrary solid shapes that automatically get a shading as if they had some simple lighting projected on them.\n\nA: As an alternative Freecad (http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/free-cad/index.php?title=Main_Page) can project 2d views from 3D objects.\n\nA: Blender (blender.org) is your best option. \nStandard Blender can do edge rendering that creates a drawing-style image from any 3D model. But better yet you can use one of the freestyle Blender builds: http://graphicall.org/?keywords=freestyle\nGoogle \"Blender freestyle tutorial\" to get help.\nThis does not produce vector graphics though, just bitmapped images.\nDepending on your needs this may work for you.\n\nA: I personally recommend PovRay. It's simply the best rendering engine ever.

System -> Settings -> Assistive Technologies; then Keyboard Accessibility, under \"Mouse Buttons\"\nAlso using Shortcuts may help you too.\nanother way is using ctrl-shift-numlock that is supposed to be the key combo that will let you move the cursor with the keyboard, you can control the mouse from keyboard. Keys / and * on the numpad select left mouse click and right mouse click respectively. Mouse click is done by 5 on the numpad.\nBut as you are saying, you need something more ,then\nhere: http://www.semicomplete.com/projects/keynav/. And here is a demo of keynav in action\nIt is tested on Ubuntu 10.10 and it works fine. You have to install libxdo-dev before it would build (make), but then it ran fine. Note there's no 'make install' target, so just copy the keynav binary it builds to someplace in your path (~/bin, /opt/bin, etc).\nDoesn't work awesome with dual monitors.Edit: NM.

Or Lubuntu. 9.XX is no longer supported, and 10.04 won't run much faster. Xubuntu is pretty fast, but Lubuntu is superspeed ;) Just figure out, test, an choose :)\n\nA: That computer should be more than powerful enough to run normal Ubuntu. The question is how well supported your VGA is. You may not want to use Compiz as your window manageer. Normal Ubuntu comes with the option to load a 2D desktop, which you can access by clicking on the button next to the password field before you log in. It is called Ubuntu 2D. This uses Metacity instead of Compiz, but will still give you the modern Unity desktop. \nRemember that everything is available in Ubuntu. You don't have to use Lubuntu, Xubuntu, etc. For instance, if you want to have the option of switching between Unity, LXDE and Xfce, simply click to install them. You'll then be able to choose at login. LXDE will just be added without any issues. Xfce will have a conflict with the notification system, and will warn you that Ubuntu Desktop will be removed. It's fine. It's only a warning, and only the notification system will be removed. You can just reinstall Ubuntu Desktop to undo. It's only a few KB of download.\nIn other words; my recommendation is that you give Ubuntu a try, and if necessary, experiment with different desktops. No need to reinstall the entire system for that. \n", "Q: Is there a method of linking your Ubuntu account to your Ubuntu One/Social Network?

And there is no need to poweroff the VMs.\n\nA: Took me a while to get back to this, sorry to everyone that gave me tips. \nHere's the solution I ended up with.\nSince I still didnt really grasp the snapshot/restore snapshot concept (yes I am kinda thick headed), I made a script to delete old files, starting from the link that Michael K provided, then proceeded to making a folder with todays date on the usb drive, pausing all active VMs (absolutely no need for 100% uptime here, company runs 9am-6pm),  and copying all of /var/lib/libvirt in there, and then resume VMs and be happy.\nHere is the script.\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfind /mnt/usbexterno/backup* -maxdepth 0 -type d -mtime +15 -exec rm -rf {} \\;\n\nvirsh list | sed '1,2d' | cut -d' ' -f3>/tmp/vmlist\n\nVMLIST=$(cat /tmp/vmlist)\nset -- $VMLIST\nfor i in $VMLIST\ndo\n    /usr/bin/virsh suspend $1\nshift\ndone\n\nmkdir /mnt/usbexterno/`date +backup-%Y-%m-%d`\ncp -Rv /var/lib/libvirt /mnt/usbexterno/`date +backup-%Y-%m-%d`\n\nset -- $VMLIST\nfor i in $VMLIST\ndo\n    /usr/bin/virsh resume $1\nshift\ndone\nrm /tmp/vmlist\n\nIf anybody has any tips on how I could improve this please be my guest :D\n\nA: I would consider compressing the VM before sending it off but this is exactly what I have been doing.\nOh, you might want to consider saving the xml file too (/etc/libvert/qemu/).\n\nA: I would tend to agree, although your backup strategy is working, it may not be the best.\nIMO there is not much that is necessarily unique to a Virtual Machine and there are several backup strategies available to you.\nSee Ubuntu Server Guide - Backups\nThe backup strategy varies depending on what servers you are running. In general, on a server, I back up data (such as /var/www and databases), any configuration files I manually edit (I keep a copy of the  original file and the edited file in /root ), and a list of all installed packages (you can restore from a list of packages if needed).\nAs you can guess from some of my posts, I am a fan of rsync ;)\n", "Q: How to get (from terminal) total number of threads (per process and total for all processes) I tried googling it, but I can't find it. I am looking for:\n\n\n*\n\n*number of threads in process X\n\n*total number of threads running currently\n\nA: To get the number of threads for a given pid:\nps -o nlwp <pid>\n\nTo the get the sum of all threads running in the system:\nps -eo nlwp | tail -n +2 | awk '{ num_threads += $1 } END { print num_threads }'\n\n\nA: I'm basing this answer around ps axms. ps is a great tool for listing what's running.\nIf you want to filter that by a process, you could try something like this:\necho $(( `ps axms | grep firefox | wc -l`  - 1))\n\nWe subtract 1 because grep will show in that list.\nFor all threads in general this should work:\necho $(( `ps axms | wc -l`  - 1))\n\nWe subtract one this time because there is a header row.\n\nA: On linux specifically, here is one way to do it per-process:\n#!/bin/sh\nwhile read name val; do\n    if [ \"$name\" = Threads: ]; then\n        printf %s\\\\n \"$val\"\n        break\n    fi\ndone < /proc/\"$1\"/status\n\nYou may then invoke this script with a PID as an argument, and it will report the number of threads owned by that process.\nTo get the thread count for the whole system, this suffices:\n#!/bin/sh\ncount() {\n    printf %s\\\\n \"$#\"\n}\ncount /proc/[0-9]*/task/[0-9]*\n\nThese approaches may seem a little unorthodox in that they rely heavily on shell features, but in return both of them are faster than the corresponding ps and awk-based approaches on my machine (while also not creating extra threads of their own for pipes). Bear in mind that the shell launched to run these scripts will have a thread of its own (or more, if you are using a strange implementation).\n\nA: For finding the number of threads running a single process you can look at /proc/<pid>/status. It should list the number of threads as one of the fields.\n\nA: To get the total number of the threads(tiny pieces of a process running simultaneously) of a you can use the command ps -o nlwp <pid> It works all the time. \nBut if you prefer to try to see it through a file. you should probably look at the files that were created for each and every process of the system. There you can get the ultimate details of the process. For each and every process, there is a folder created in /proc/<pid> there you can see all the other details also.\n", "Q: 407 Proxy Authentication Required When I try to install a software using Ubuntu Software center I get:\nFailed to download repository information\nCheck Your Internet connection\n\nWhen I try to do a apt-get install something, I get:\n407  Proxy Authentication Required\n\nI use a proxy server that requires a user-name and a password.\nI have set my systems proxy manually, by plugging in the required numbers in the Networks proxy and applied it system wide. I guess the problem now is plugging in my user-name and password.\nWhen I use INTERNET via Mozilla, it specifically asks me for my user-name and password.\n\nA: For your apt-get to work, you should edit your apt config file:\nsudo -H gedit /etc/apt/apt.conf\n\nAnd add Acquire::http::Proxy \"http://username:password@proxyhost:port/\";\nThe syntax shown above should be strictly followed.\nThis configuration may fail if your username or password has an '@' in it.\nYou can also add proxy configuration for other protocols such as FTP.\nUpdate: If your username or password has '@' in it you can replace it with %40\nExample:If your password is @123 enter it as %40123. \nFor other characters see this Percent-encoding\n\nA: If you're behind an enterprise proxy that's running NTLM authentication, you could use CNTLM:\n$ sudo apt-get install cntlm\n$ sudo vi /etc/cntlm.conf\n\nChange the default settings (domain, username, password and proxy). Then restart the service:\n$ sudo /etc/init.d/cntlm restart\n\nYou can now use localhost:3128 (default CNTLM port) as the system-wide proxy for Ubuntu.\nCheck http://cntlm.sourceforge.net/ for docs.\n\nA: If your user name is separated by space then use:\nexport http_proxy='http://Pankaj Kumar Pandit:ABCD@192.168.1.1:3128/'\n\nIf your user name is not separated by space then use:\nexport http_proxy=http://Pankaj_Kumar_Pandit:ABCD@192.168.1.1:3128/\n\nThe difference is the addition of opening and closing '.\n\nA: I think this tutorial should help you.\n\nClick on Network tab select Manual Proxy Configuration option and enter your proxy server,port details.If you have username,password click on Authentication to enter these details click on ok\n\n(from http://www.ubuntugeek.com/how-to-configure-ubuntu-desktop-to-use-your-proxy-server.html)\nTo invoke it for all programs launched in a shell I would suggest you either add it to your /etc/bash.bashrc using gksudo gedit /etc/bash.bashrc to apply it system-wide for all bash sessions or to your user-space ~/.bashrc.\nAs far as Synaptic goes, in the Preferences under the Network tab you seem to be able to set authentification for your proxies. This appears to be specific to Synaptic, though.\n\nA: One nice alternative is to use Synaptic Package Manager, where you can specify system independent proxy settings and also store username and password.\n\nHowever, this won't change proxy for Software Center.\n\nA: In the latest versions of Ubuntu, you can use System Settings > Network > Network Proxy, and when you click \"apply system wide\" it modifies proxy settings in different places, at least including the /etc/apt/sources.list file, HOWEVER...\nIt does not have any mechanism to prompt for authentication.  No idea why no one has made that part of it yet, but because of this, if you need authentication, you need to put your password and username there too in this format:\nusername:password@proxy.address\n\nIf your password or user name has any special characters in it, including @ or # or ! or whatever, you probably are going to have to use the HTML-ized character code for any of those special characters.

For example if I install program 'A' to my desktop I want to be installed to my laptop as well if I have synchronized these two. I want the same with my files and folders. If I change something to my desktop I want the changes to effect my laptop too(I exclude Ubuntu One as a solution).\nThanks for your time and patience!  \n\nA: The Ubuntu Software Center has a package sync feature. Click File -> Sync between computers.\nFor two-way file sync without Ubuntu One, try Unison. Here are some instructions.\n\nA: As Michael K pointed out the packages you can keep in sync by doing:\ndpkg --get-selections > <file>\n\nCopy the file from source machine to destination using your favorite method then\ndpkg --set-selections < <file>\napt-get dselect-upgrade\n\nThis way all the packages that were installed on one machine will be installed on the other further the packages that were removed on the source machine will be removed from the destination, so doing that is extraordinarily dangerous especially when syncing desktop to laptop since laptop may require certain drivers that desktop in general will not.\nIn my experience deploying standardized systems I can tell you that once the base build is put in place the synchronization of the packages is a very very rare thing predicated as Michael pointed out on hardware being identical and most importantly purpose being identical as well.\n\nA: Although your idea sounds nice, you probably do not want to synchronize everything ,various lock files and .xauthority for example.\nYou are better off identifying what files or data you want to synchronize.\nYou can then use any number of tools from rsync to unison.\nYou can use rsync to sycn your data.

I have generally been happy with AMD, but less so with the ATI.\nI put together a cut-rate system this summer, and tried to choose Ubuntu-friendly components.  I went with an asus mobo (M4A88TD-M) which has the 810 southbridge rather than the 710, which is buggy at least in earlier Ubuntu versions (I run 11.10).\nThe AMD processor was the Athlon II 640 quad core.  I tried to go as expensive on the processor as possible, but not sure if I bot the best value.\nAt first I really skimped on everything, no additional graphics (video) card and even skimped on memory, which was kind of dumb.\nAnd it ran 11.10 great, I have been really happy overall, even with stuff like virtualbox running for long periods of time or other resource hogs. The processor never maxes out and the cores share the load. I didn't unlock the cores but that's an option as well, just for kicks.\nBut the on board ATI video card seemed to have some sort of problems, maybe I bought a too-cheap mobo, but the video was really choppy.  This could also be a driver issue.\nAnd, the ATI card (I believe) had some problem related to X, occasionally the machine would sort of start freezing up, and if I was lucky I could close enough stuff to avoid an effective lock-down, where the mouse was barely moving and clicking did nothing.\nI didn't solve that problem, because by this time I had been using the machine for 3 months and got a little more money to spend.  So, I added memory and a Nvida video card, which I think was about 65 bucks or so.\nWith both ATI and Nvidia, you may have problems getting started. Basically, if the video driver is wrong then you might have trouble right after install.  I did both times.  But, both problems were easy to find a solution online.  Then, once the right driver is installed, its ok.\nI don't mean to crack on ATI really, on board chips from really cheap mobos are not expected to give great video.  And the problem with X was only occasionally, and maybe was easy to fix, I am not sure.\nBut overall the AMD processor has been great, no complaints at all. :-)\nGood luck!\n\nA: Short answer: no, makes no difference what so ever what CPU is installed on your laptop.\nMakes a huge difference what graphics chip is installed tough, specifically what chipset it will be using.\nIn terms of CPU type, RAM, hard disk, those wont be the issue. The issues will come from graphics, special media keys, integrated webcams and sound devices.\nAn AMD laptop will have a built in ATI graphics card, you need to make sure that the card is well supported by the driver for Linux.\nAn Intel laptop will have either an Intel (which is supported by the included driver on Ubuntu) or an nVidia card, which, on the last case needs to be check also for support from drivers.\nThe most probable reason you are seeing many Intel bases laptops supported by Ubuntu (or Ubuntu friendly) is probably that there are not drivers required to install out of the box for a system with an Intel graphics chipset and the driver works (mostly all cases) very well with Intel working hard on supporting Linux.\nLook for a laptop model that has a good and supported graphics chipset, no or limited special media keys (or at least look for support for those before you buy it) and if having a web cam make sure that there is a driver and that you don't really need to install to many things for it to work.\nBut CPU wise, you have the same chances (almost 0) of having problems because of what CPU is in the laptop.\n", "Q: Is it possible to install Wubi using the ISO?

I am using ubuntu 10.04. Is there any software to bypass the firewall configured by my network administrator. I have seen my friend using software named ultrasurf in windows which bypasses the firewll, masks it's IP, can able to surf anonymously etc ...Is there any equivalent software available in ubuntu?\n\nA: First, your best bet is to approach the school administration and explain your position. Your desire to view videos on YouTube relevant to your studies is a good thing. Downloading Ubuntu ISOs might be made simpler if a copy is cached locally, only the university admins could do something like that. You don't know if you don't ask.  \nA 'quick and dirty' solution is to set up SSH tunneling to a proxy server, there are paid and free options. This isn't really an Ubuntu question though. Maybe you could re-post another question about setting up SSH tunnels in Ubuntu? That would be welcome here. From there, you are on your own selecting a proxy, there are too many to cover here. Your question may get closed as off-topic but don't get discouraged by that. This is a community site and everything is shaped by various members of the community. Just stay on-topic to Ubuntu and read the FAQs on questions.  \nDon't ever be afraid to ask questions here and at school.\n\nA: Preamble\nIf your school puts up regulations on what you can see, bypassing that will likely get you in trouble. Even if you're not breaking the law, you'll probably be breaking policy which is probably worse if you want to finish your studies and leave with a good record.\nAnd don't think you can't be caught. You can. Firewall monitoring tools make it quite easy to log suspicious traffic from a workstation and getting you name from that information isn't hard either.\nIf you think getting caught will hurt you in any way, get permission. If you don't get permission, don't do it. Use your own network connection.\n\nUltrasurf is a simple combination of two elements:\n\n*\n\n*A proxy service\n\n*History cleaning\n\nOf course they dress these up as major things (because they have a product they're pushing) but the fact is you can achieve this relatively simply from Ubuntu without downloading anything.\nThe first step is getting proxy access. You can use Tor, a paid-for service or something else but the easiest method is just to SSH back home.\nUnless you have a static IP, you'll want to set up a domain name (with DynDNS or one of the thousands of other dynamic-DNS services out there), install OpenSSH server and then let your router point that port at your computer. I'm not going to cover the set up here because it's been done a thousand times before. By the end of this you should be able to SSH home from outside your home network.\nThen when you're at school you SSH home using something like this:\nssh -D 8080 username@mh-home-server.dyndns.com\n\nThis sets up a SOCKS proxy running on localhost:8080. Magic. To use this in Firefox, you need to go into the settings and set the proxy.\nThe next step is keeping your history clear. Modern browsers can do this for you by using their private browsing mode. There are also plugins that can do similar things - but I think the private browsing mode should be enough.\nIf you have access to Chrome/Chromium you can minify the settings by just running this:\nchromium-browser --incognito --proxy-server=\"socks5://localhost:8080\" --user-data-dir=/tmp/temp-profile\n\nYou can script or alias that away to make launching it easier.\n", "Q: How can I use VST instruments?

Is there an easier way to install Chromium than what is described here?\nFurthermore, is there an easier way to stay up to date with current Chromium releases rather than having to re-build Chromium each release? (a script which automatically grabs and installs the latest build possibly?).\nRelated: \n\n\n*\n\n*How do I get the latest (beta and development) version of Chromium?\n\nA: GUI method\nI remember that one of the first things that I made after I installed a fresh version of Ubuntu 13.04 it was to install Chromium browser . And I installed it from Ubuntu Software Center without to add any ppa repository or to download it from somewhere. Also, I remember that just a few days ago Software Updater announced me that there is a new version of Chromium to update. \nSo it's sure that Canonical have decided to provide the most recent Chromium versions and you don't need to think anymore what is easier way to install Chromium or how to stay up to date with current Chromium releases. And here is the official Ubuntu package of Chromium browser on Launchpad: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/chromium-browser.\nProof:\n\nAs you can see from above image, you can also to install Unity Webapp extension once with Chromum Browser.\nComand-line method\nOpen a terminal and run next command:\nsudo apt-get install chromium-browser\n\nProof:\n\nAs a note, it seems that Chromium Likely to Replace Firefox As Default Browser in Ubuntu 13.10.\nIf you are interested somehow by other versions of Chromium browser from Personal Package Archives (PPAs), here is a complete list with all of these (some of them have been abandoned): https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+ppas?name_filter=chromium-browser. And keep in mind that these PPAs are considered by Canonical  unsupported and unsecured.\n\nA: I had the exact same problem, and had come to the conclusion that Chromium had been abandoned. In any case, when the Unity Webapps Preview was released I installed it right away, and it updated both FireFox and Chromium. After FireFox moving so slowly it hurt, I moved back to Chromium and decided I could live with it being outdated... Lo and behold! It had been updated!\n\nTo install the Webapps Preview:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webapps/preview\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install unity-webapps-preview\n\n\nWait for everything to install, and Chromium should be fully updated:\n\nIf you don't want to use the Webapps, then you can just go to Chromium's extension page and select to disable the add-on:\n\nIf you want to uninstall Webapps:\nsudo apt-get install ppa-purge\nsudo ppa-purge ppa:webapps/preview\n\nN.B. Using ppa-purge removes all the packages that were installed or upgraded by the ppa you added: this means that Chromium and FireFox (as well as other applications) will be downgraded. If you use Chromium's sync function, this will cause an error when you start the program telling you that your profile is from a newer version of Chromium, and that you should upgrade or change profiles.\nHope this helps!\n\nA: Chromium is currently not built for the chromium-daily PPA, which makes using it a bit of a security issue. Unless you can find a better PPA that stays up to date, I'd recommend you use the repo version of Chromium. Using an old browser on the internet will get you hacked. See:\nDoes someone know why the Chromium daily package isn't build anymore?\nFor the latest stable of Chromium click the button here:\nhttps://snapcraft.io/chromium\n\nA: Currently, the only way to get it that I can think of is by  getting the source code and building it yourself. \nThe packages in the chromium stable ppa failed to build. That was a week ago and I have already wrote an email to the maintainer of that ppa trying to make him aware of that problem but he would not write back…\n\nA: I've asked a similar question. \nWhat I do is use the daily zip archives.

He has a PPA with Chromium, but he adds in the description that it's better to use this:\nhttps://launchpad.net/~canonical-chromium-builds/+archive/ubuntu/stage\nRight now this PPA offer Chromium version 35, but is very likely that they update it.\n", "Q: How can I fix a GTK 3 theme window border looking wrong?

I got a new laptop which makes my old one with a dual boot of XP and 11.10 redundant.  Everything has been moved over and this is a perfect chance to play around with variants.  I would like to replace the Ubuntu with Lubuntu but assume that if I just remove the Ubuntu partition to make room there will be issues with the existing grub.  Is there a way to do this?    \nOr as another possibility I could shrink the Ubuntu partition and install something in the empty space.  Will an Ubuntu based installer recognize what is going on and set up a triple boot as effortlessly as it does a dual boot?\n\nA: There is no need to delete the Ubuntu partition and re-install. You can install the lubuntu-desktop (click on link to install directly) package and use Lubuntu Desktop instead of Unity.\nLook for the package in the Ubuntu Software Center and install it, after its done log off and on the screen where you insert your password for the user just select the new desktop environment.\n\nYou will even be able to select which login manager you want (LXDM or Lightdm) during the installation.\n\nTrying to install Lubuntu side by side with Ubuntu and WindowsXP can lead to more confusion and its really use less since you can install the desktop on top of your current installation. Why have 2 based Ubuntu systems when 1 can do the same job using a different desktop environment?\nYou can even remove Unity if you are not planning on using it anymore later on. It can also stay there in case you need it, it wont slow down you computer having it installed.\n\nA: As you may know, you can try the various desktops either from the live desktop CD or by installing them.\nsudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop\n\nYou can make space with any number of tools, gparted is most popular. Run gparted from a live CD and resize your partitions.\nWhen you install, install grub just as you did when you first install, and you will be able to triple boot, no problem is anticipated.\n\nA: Definitely you can install Lubuntu side by side to windows XP and ubuntu and grub will show you three OS. However, Lubuntu will be most probably shown as  another ubuntu entry. If you want to try Lubuntu desktop environment you can also download and install the Lubuntu-core package using software center or synaptic.

But, since I can get them by username, what prevents other apps to do the same? \nIsn't that a security risk, or am I missing something?\n\nA: The keyring library uses the standard keyring of your desktop environment, e.g. the GNOME keyring.

Is Ubuntu well-suited as a small business solution? I have a very scared part time IT manager who thinks it's not suitable.  Please can you clarify?\n\nA: Ubuntu is perfectly suitable for business use in general. To compare, Microsoft has different versions of Office directed at personal use and students and other versions for professionals. The software itself is pretty much the same, but with different restrictions. For instance, if you buy MS Office for personal use, you can't legally use it in your small business. Another example is Windows Small Business Server. This is just a bundle of Windows Server software with a limit to how many users you are allowed to have, etc. Because of these restrictions, the price of the software can be lowered because you couldn't use it for larger businesses. \nWith Ubuntu, there are no ultimate editions or personal use only editions. Everyone gets the best software available. I see no reason why LibreOffice should be more or less useful to large companies than it is to small businesses, students or personal users, for instance. We know for a fact that it is useful to very large companies and organizations. So, as a general answer to a general question, I would say that yes, Ubuntu is very much suitable for small businesses. \nAs a general advise, I'd recommend that you define your needs, rather than labeling yourself simply as a small business. There might be differences between a hair dresser and a small law firm, for instance. \n", "Q: How do I enable the \"multiverse\" repository?

The original command has this structure:\n$ sudo echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward\n^^^ Part 1 ^^   ^^^^  Part 2 ^^^^\n\nPart 1 runs as sudo, BUT you're then trying to redirect output to a file. The redirection itself \"runs\" as an unprivileged user, that's why it has no permission to write to the file.\nThe solution I propose does the \"echo\" as an unprivileged user, but then pipes that to the \"tee\" command, which we run through sudo. Thus, tee will be run as root and will be able to write to the file.\nTee basically takes standard input and writes it to both a file and stdout.

I shrank the Windows partition and created a couple of new partitions to install Ubuntu in. I've noticed that reading my Ubuntu partitions is much noisier than reading the NTFS partiion. This applies whether I am running Windows or Ubuntu - reading/writing any data to my Ubuntu partition makes the hard drive fairly noisy, whereas reading/writing any data to my NTFS partitions is much quieter.\nWhat could be the reason behind this? It's all on the same hard drive and can't have anything to do with the operating systems themselves as the results are reproducible in both Windows and Ubuntu.\nIn short, why is reading/writing to my NTFS partitions quieter than reading/writing to the EXT3 partition?\nThanks very much\n\nA: It could be due to some physical hard drive properties. For example, if you hard drive layout is like this:\n/dev/sda1 -> NTFS\n/dev/sda2 -> ext3/4\n/dev/sda3 -> swap\n\nand your ext3/4 partition is fairly empty and the swap partition is being used, then the hard drive head would need to jump between two physical locations on the disk.\nAlso, the NTFS fragments, which means that when you write files, it'll choose the first empty area and when that's filled, it will go to the next empty area (or hole) on the disk. This means that the hard drive head only moves in one direction; once that empty area is filled, it goes on to the next, but it doesn't go backwards.\next3/4 partitions don't fragment [very much]. When you write a file to an ext3/4 partition, it'll will try to find an area where the file can fit into a continuous empty area. This means that it will have to scan the disk for empty areas before writing to it.\nPlease note that I didn't research what I said above, so it could be all wrong :)\nOh yeah, if by louder, you mean that the motor spins faster, and not the clicking sound, then that's probably because your Ubuntu partition is located closer to the center of the platter than the Windows partition is. The disk needs to spin faster to read/write the same amount of data in a given amount of time towards the center than the outside.\n", "Q: Does Ubuntu follow the Linux Standard Base (LSB)? I was reading about the Linux Standard Base and was wondering if the structure used in Ubuntu is the same that is suggested in the LSB. I know some distros do not follow or do some changes to the LSB, so I also want to know if Ubuntu has some changes, and what changes these are.\n\nA: For 11.10 and 12.04 the Linux Standard base version is 4.0, as noted on Launchpad. As explained at the Linux Foundation, LSB is\n\na core standard for the Linux operating system that encourages interoperability between applications and the platform. It includes a written binary interface specification, a set of test suites for both distributions and applications writing to the standard, and a sample implementation for testing purposes.\n\nThe LSB specification outlines standards for many things such as the filesystem, core libraries and key functions such as libc system calls.  It also specifies software packaging standards and that a distribution must support the rpm standard even if its default package system does not use the rpm system.\nThe specification also contains the standard for runlevels and init scripts, and a related package included in Ubuntu is lsb-base. This package, according to its own description, contains the\n\ninit-functions shell library, which\n   may be used by other packages' initialization scripts for console\n   logging and other purposes.\n\nThe easiest way to demonstrate Ubuntu support for these init standards is to run\ngrep -ri \"BEGIN INIT INFO\" /etc/init.d\n\nand then examine one of the files listed. Sudo, for example, will have the LSB header specifications at the start of the script:\n### BEGIN INIT INFO\n# Provides:          sudo\n# Required-Start:    $local_fs $remote_fs\n# Required-Stop:\n# X-Start-Before:    rmnologin\n# Default-Start:     2 3 4 5\n# Default-Stop:\n# Short-Description: Provide limited super user privileges to specific users\n# Description: Provide limited super user privileges to specific users.\n### END INIT INFO\n\nThe directories such as $local_fs that are mentioned by these LSB headers are listed in /etc/insserv.conf. For more information on init, see page 168 of this Ubuntu book\nIt is difficult to find the specific areas in which Ubuntu diverges from the LSB standards, and the disclaimer on the LSB packages is that the existence of those packages does\n\nnot imply that Debian fully complies\n   with the Linux Standard Base, and should not be construed as a\n   statement that Debian is LSB-compliant.\n\nIn general, however, both Ubuntu and Debian do intend to be compliant and they include the command lsb_release to indicate the distributions' general compliance. However, they will make occasional divergences when necessary, with relation to such things as the filesystem hierarchy, as noted in the answers here:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to understand the Ubuntu file system layout?\n\nA: Ubuntu like Debian 'strives to comply with the LSB' through the 'alien' program but is not believed to be fully compliant.\n", "Q: How do I install Adobe Acrobat Reader deb package downloaded from Adobe website?

This can be done via filling the following Adobe feature request form: Feature Request/Bug Report Form.\nAs an alternative, you may want to switch to Foxit or master pdf readers, who are actually faster to open and provide more free features than Adobe reader.\n\nA: Ubuntu 16.10 on amd64 seems to require\nsudo apt-get -f install\nsudo apt-get -y install adobereader-enu\n\nWithout i386 in 64-bit env acroread gives file not found and GTK errors, so run:\nsudo dpkg --add-architecture i386\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get -y install libc6:i386 libncurses5:i386 libstdc++6:i386 libglib2.0-0:i386 libsoup2.4-1:i386 libgtk2.0-0:i386\nsudo apt-get -y install libicu-dev:i386 gtk2-engines-murrine libcanberra-gtk-module:i386 gtk2-engines-murrine:i386\n\nThis may be redundant as main bin is i386\nsudo apt-get -y install gtk2-engines gtk2-engines-* libgtkmm-2.4-1c2 libcanberra-gtk-module\n\n\nA: Acroread is now available in Quantal's partner repo.\nSee this Launchpad bug:\n\n\n*\n\n*acroread 9.5.1 is not installable on Ubuntu Precise amd64 system\nIt says Precise in the title, but it applies to precise, quantal and raring.\n\nA: You can do:\n# sudo dpkg -i AdbeRdr9.4.6-1_i386linux_enu.deb\n\nBut I recommend evince as better pdf reader.

I'm trying to leave XBMC set up on tty7, as it is, and have a normal window manager on added for tty8, so I can use a web browser and stuff.  The guides I found for setting up tty8 all use gdm configure files, but I don't even have gdm installed and installing gdm wants me to remove xbmc-live, which is definetly not what I want.  Any tips how I can set up tty8 to be a regular wm given these conflicts?  I don't really even need tty8 to have a login like gdm, it could just directly launch a window manager.\n\nA: I dont have this setup yet but I dont think you need to install gdm. You should be able to install gnome, xfce, kde or any other desktop environment without the desktop manager that comes with it. You can then either manually start that desktop session after switching to tty8 or write an script to automatically load it. \nI suppose you have already seen this question on installing XBMC in ubuntu. Although it is not exactly the path you want to take, it shows that XBMC and gnome can coexist perfectly fine. \n", "Q: How to use Wine?

I don't think you allocated enough space for Ubuntu during setup, unless that's incorrect and something else is wrong.\nYou may want to consider getting rid of some of your other partitions, particularly your extra swap partitions, to make room so you can resize your Linux partition. This can be done by using a program like GParted (be sure to back up any data first; see Resize partition without affecting other OSes in dual-boot for details). That, or get a larger/additional hard drive.\n\nA: All though I agree with WarriorIng64, in the way, that 4.3G is really not that much space for a whole OS, you could try using du to find what is eating up your disk space.\ndu -as --max-depth=N / gives you a listing of the disk usage of all folders from your filesystem root to depth N.\nAs I see you have quite a few platters, I might suggest to you to move some folders (for example your home folder) to a different disk.

I have a laptop that has a damaged screen.  The 24 pixels (approximately) on the right side of the screen are damaged (this is definitely not a driver problem, it is physical damage).  It is not a straight bar, but rather a lot of black pixels that ebb and flow with some multicolored pixels around the edges.  I got this from someone so don't know the root cause: possibly water damage?\nAnyway, the \"power menu as well as any scroll bars (when applications are full screen) are hidden behind this damaged area.  Is there a way I can adjust the screen resolution or dimension so that these right side 24 pixels are not used?  So, the laptop is 1024 x 768.  Can I modify so that it is 1000 x 768 (and the 1000 are the leftmost 1000 pixels, not centered?)?\nI was able to try using \"xrandr\" to force the screen to be 1000 wide, but then it is still centered, so it still only ignores 12 pixels on the right.\nThanks for any help.  This is with Ubuntu 11.10.\n\nA: Here is a dirty hack... Since your damaged area is on the right side of the screen, you can create a panel with black background, align it to the right, and adjust the size carefully to cover the damaged area:\n\nMake it opaque, so it looks really black.\nUmm.. It seems you can even use a background image, to utilize the remaining good area... I had never use a background image, now I know why it comes..\n\nA: In \"System Settings\", there is an icon called \"displays\". Click that, and you should be able to adjust the resolution.

I think you will have to go all the way back to PhpMyAdmin 2.1x to find one compatible with PHP 4.49.  If you go to the downloads section of the PhpMyAdmin site there is a link to a SourceForge page that contains the older versions.  Check the requirements to be sure, but I believe everything beginning with version 3.0 requires PHP 5x.\n\nA: You shouldn't use php4. It's not supported anymore, so no security updates will be provided. Not a good thing on a public web server.\nAnyway the instruction you linked say \"php4 in parallel with php5\".

I did a /fixmbr with the windows recovery cd and got back windows, but wiped out grub and my access to Ubuntu. I reinstalled grub from the Ubuntu live usb ( I know I did this correctly) and now windows won't boot, again.\nI'm a linux noob at a loss. Your wisdom is greatly appreciated!\n\nUpdate in response to Scott Severance:\nyour instructions say to determine the main partition on my computer. I'm not sure what this means... my windows partition is at sda2, my boot partition is at sda1, and my linux root partition is at sda7... Which is the \"main\" partition?\nUPDATE: I determined that you were probably referring to the linux root(/) partition, because this was the only partition for which I could follow your instructions without errors. Now, Windows is booting fine (thanks to /fixmbr), but even after the grub instructions there is no grub. It boots straight into windows.\n\nA: Even though you said that you know that you updated Grub correctly, I'm pretty sure that you didn't; else you wouldn't be having these problems. You may have followed the instructions you found exactly, but those instructions might have been wrong.\nRun the Windows fixmbr again, then use the live CD to set up a chroot environment and run update-grub from there. I've posted instructions previously.\nNote that if you've got a separate /boot partition, you need to mount it after mounting your root partition and before entering the chroot:\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot\n\nIf after doing this Grub still doesn't play nicely with Windows, it probably means that your Grub configuration is messed up. Go back to your chroot environment and reinstall the grub packages. Hopefully, that'll clear things up.\n\nA: I'm not familiar enough with Windows-7 as I switched to Ubuntu before it came out.

When I try to install Xubuntu on my current Ubuntu installation, it won't let me install \"xubuntu-desktop\", but it will instead recommend me to install other packages in the Xubuntu repos. \nHas the package name changed or do I have to wait for an updated version?\n\nA: The xubuntu-desktop is a meta-package. That means, that it's a package that serves as a single point linking to other packages. Something like a pointer to many other different packages. \nHence xubuntu-desktop package's only contents are links to other xfce related packages, the packages that make up the Xubuntu Desktop.\nYou could also read the Ubuntu Community Documentation on MetaPackages \n", "Q: Use VirtualBox without ISO?

The new Indian Rupee sign, Unicode 20B9, is supposed to have been introduced in Ubuntu 10.10 Maverick. It is already the default currency symbol for the English (India) (en_IN) locale in Ubuntu 11.10 Oneiric. However, in Natty the default currency symbol, as displayed in the GNOME Regional Formats window, is still the older generic Rupee sign, Rs, Unicode 20A8. In Character Map I found that Unicode 20B9 is not defined in Natty, even with the latest version of the Ubuntu font.

I recently switched to Ubuntu 11.10. I checked out my project from svn and created the required modules and libraries in IntelliJ as always. But for some reason I can't compile the project and I get:\nError: *.class (No such file or directory)\n\nfor all of the classes in the project. I checked the project structure and everything seems normal. I can't even guess what the problem might be. The only difference in the project under Ubuntu from Windows is that I used Sun Java 6 in Windows but now I'm using OpenJDK 6. \nI will provide more details if required. \n\nA: I'm not a IntelliJ user, but I do use PyCharm everyday. JetBrains IDEs don't work (and they are not supported) under OpenJDK 6. They are really slow and have some visual problems when used with it.\nIt's quite possible too that your project doesn't work either in OpenJDK, I mean that this is not an IDE problem, but some problem in your own project.\nPyCharm, 2.0 at least, and likely IntellJ, works nicely under OpenJDK 7, but it's still not supported (it doesn't support Oracle Java 7 either). Note that this means that it's not supported to run the IDE under this VMs, not that you program with those VMs as targets is not supported (it is).\nSo you have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Move to Oracle JDK 6 (you will need to install it from the Oracle web).\n\n*Move to OpenJDK 7.\n\n\nThe best answer depends on your project. OpenJDK 7 will be the best move to assure future compatibility (Oracle Java 7 is based on it), Oracle 6 can be the best fit if most of your users are using it.\n", "Q: \"See also\" documentation referenced by man pages I'm noticing that at the bottom of some man pages in the \"See Also\" section are references to documentation that aren't other man pages.

I'm aware the Bash Reference Manual is available through info bash. Is there something similar (non-pdf --- HTML, ASCII, man page, or other info page) for the others?\n\nA: Unfortunately the situation is that every package mantainer provides one of more man pages for the applications provided by the package, but the content of the man page is\n\n\n*\n\n*static - cannot change based on what is installed or not on your particular machine\n\n*subjective - is up to the maintainer (or upstream developer) to choose what to write into it, apart from the structure that should adhere to a general scheme, and should be syntactically correct to be parsed from the the deputed tools\nSo there is no guarantee that the indicated documentation is available in the repos, nor that it is available freely in general (sometimes also other referred man paged are non existent).\nYou could fire a bug against the package to signal that there is no reference (not event an URL) indicating where that documents could be found.\n", "Q: The following signatures were invalid \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhat is the easiest way to resolve apt-get BADSIG GPG errors? \n\nI use ubuntu 11.10 latest update, but when I change the ubuntu update server to the main server i get this error:\nsudo apt-get update\n......\n......\n\nHit http://archive.ubuntu.com oneiric-security/universe Translation-en\nFetched 198 B in 16s (11 B/s)\nReading package lists...

First by jockey(fail, boot with unity 2D instead) and install manually (fail, boot into blank screen). \n3rd, I give up using the AMD/ATI graphic card. Then I got a new problem.

What is the default location for the Firefox or Chromium web browser to store data?\nAlso, where are the temporary data and cookies, along with user profiles, stored?\n\nA: I think this information about the location of cookies is out of date. In Ubuntu 16.04 using Mozilla 50.1.0 the cookies are not stored in -\n~/.mozilla/firefox/xxxxxxx.default/Cache\n\nIn fact this Cache folder does not exist. The cookies are stored in an SQLite database file called cookies.sqlite.

The first two are maintained by Canonical. Universe and Multiverse are a community effort. The best way to land there is to either convince Canonical or Debian that your program is valuable.\n\n*You can add it through the Canonical developer program. This works quite similar to Apple appstore. You will need to provide the source code and Canonical will review it. This is also the only way to add pay apps.\n\n\nPPA's are no way related to this, they are independent, they get no review but from the person who set it up. Sometimes, Canonical workers, or package maintainers (the members of the community responsible for some part of the Universe and Multiverse package) can setup a PPA (the Mozilla team does), then some packages from this PPA will likely become official packages. But most of the time complete independent people set a PPA, they have no review policy and their packages will never be part of the official repositories.\n", "Q: Is there a difference between SWAP and Cache memory?

This is also represented in the color graph.\nHowever, when I load the System Monitor, SWAP is at a flat 0.\nIs this normal, or could there be a bug in either the System Monitor or Panel Indicator?\n\nA: Yes. They are a complete different thing, even the opposite in a lot of ways. I will try to explain both simply and short. Note that this answer are just a simplification and the real thing is quite more complex. Click on the wikipedia links for a better explanation.\n\n\n*\n\n*Disk Cache memory: This are chunks of the physical memory, the RAM, used to store files. That way when a program needs to read the file, it's fetched from memory instead of the hard disk. This is done because memory is way faster.\n\n*Swap: This is a place on the hard disk (usually a dedicated partition) that is used to store programs or data that can't fit in memory, like when a program grows more than the available memory. SWAP is way slower than RAM, so when you hit swap the computer gets slower, but at least the program can work. In linux swap is also used to hibernate, or to move low used program out of memory to allow more space to the disk cache.\n\n\nA: SWAP\nIt is partition is basically a UNIX/LINUX concept in which th e processes are mapped to secondary storage when primary memory is low.Hence if your RAM is big enough the SWAP partition may not be frequently used.\nCACHE\nOn the other hand cache is used to store data that has been or will be needed in the near future\nHopes that helps\n", "Q: How to find out how many people have downloaded from PPAs How do I find out how many people use a particular PPA.\nI see on a particular PPA ;\nPackage build summary\nA total of 108 builds have been dispatched for this PPA.\nCompleted builds\n108 successful\n0 failed\nDoes that mean only 108 people have added this PPA to their sources list and installed the package?\n\nA: No, that means it has built (compiled and packaged) its packages 108 times.\nThere's no logging in Launchpad that lets you know how many times a package has been downloaded.

I want to boot and run Ubuntu from a USB flash drive. (Not just a 'test drive'.)\nFirst question: Is there a difference between a LiveUSB 'Install' stick and a LiveUSB 'Run' stick? I have used the 'Universal USB Installer' from pendrivelinux.com to make a 'LiveUSB' stick with Ubuntu 11.10. It seems to run fine the first time I use it, but on subsequent boots, it has a variety of problems. Is this stick what I want for the scenario I described, or should I somehow install Linux to a bootable USB flash drive? (How?)\nThanks.\nEdit: Additional info: Thanks, all, for your feedback. The installer won't install to my 4GB stick because it required 4.3 GB. That's as far as I got. I hope to continue this exercise at some later date.\n\nA: Following is a step by step guide for a full install of 11.04 or 11.10 to a USB device.\nPartition sizes given are for 8GB drive, adjust size to suit\n\n\n*\n\n*For external HDD consider first formatting drive to NTFS:\n\n*Turn off and unplug the computer. (See note at bottom)\n\n*Remove the side from the case.\n\n*Unplug the power cable from the hard drive.\n\n*Plug the computer back in.\n\n*Insert the USB drive.\n\n*Insert the Live CD or Live USB.\n\n*Start the computer, the CD / flash drive should boot, (you need to adjust BIOS to boot USB).\n\n*Select language and \"Install Ubuntu\"\n\n*Select Download updates while installing and Select Install this third-party software.\n(Notice that at least 4.4 GB drive space is required for 11.10, 4GB bootable flash drive users must choose another distro for a full install).\n\n*Forward or Continue\n\n*If prompted, unmount partitions.\n\n*Select \"Something else\"\n\n*Forward or Continue\n\n*Confirm \"Device for boot loader installation:\" is correct, (If you left your internal HDD plugged in make sure the USB drive root is selected - sdb not sdb1).\n(Optional Windows data partition)\n\n\n*\n\n*Select \"New Partition Table\" click Continue on the drop down.\n\n*Click \"Free space\" and \"Add\".\n\n*Select \"Primary\".\n\n*Make \"New partition size...\" about 1000\n\n*\"Location = Beginning\".\n\n*\"Use as: = FAT32 file system\"\n\n*And \"Mount point = windows\".\n\n*Select \"OK\"\n\n*Click \"free space\" and then \"Add\".\n\n*Select \"Primary\", \"New partition size ...\" = 3 to 4 GB, Beginning, Ext4, and Mount point = \"/\" then OK.\n(Optional home partition)\n\n\n*\n\n*Click \"free space\" and then \"Add\".\n\n*Select \"Primary\", \"New partition size ...\" = 1 to 2 GB, Beginning, Ext2, and Mount point = \"/home\" then OK.\n(Optional swap partition)\n\n\n*\n\n*Click \"free space\" and then \"Add\".\n\n*Select \"Primary\", \"New partition size ...\" = remaining space, (1 to 2 GB), Beginning and \"Use as\" = \"swap area\" then OK.\n(Important)\n\n\n*\n\n*Confirm \"Device for boot loader installation\" points to the USB drive. Default should be ok if HDD was unplugged.\n\n*Click \"Install Now\".\n\n*Select your location.\n\n*Forward.\n\n*Select Keyboard layout.\n\n*Forward.\n\n*Insert your name, username, password, computer name and select if you want to log in automatically or require a password.\n\n*Selecting \"Encrypt my home folder\" is a good option if you are worried about loosing your USB drive.\n\n*Select forward.\n\n*Wait until install is complete.\n\n*Turn off computer and enable the HDD.\n\n*Stick the side panel back on.\nNote:\nYou may omit disabling the hard drive. But be sure, if after partitioning you choose to install grub to the root of the usb drive you are installing Ubuntu to (i.e; sdb not sdb1). Be cautious! Many people have overwritten the HDD MBR.\n\nA: There is no difference between the graphical installer and a live usb session. If you want to skip the install screen (and save some startup time), you can simply uninstall the ubiquity package while running the live session. Afterwards, you'll boot directly into the live desktop. You can customize it to behave pretty much as a normal install, but it does require a little effort. \nThere are differences between a live session and an installed system, though. The live session uses compression, for instance, which makes the boot slower than it could be. I also think there's a limit of 4GB or something for the persistence file. But as far as I'm aware, there's nothing preventing you from installing Ubuntu onto a USB stick as if it were a normal harddisk. You cannot install onto the USB stick you're booting from, though, but other than that, the procedure should be identical to installing to a harddisk. For example, you have two memory sticks. The first is the one you boot the installer from, the second is an empty one you wish to use as a replacement for the harddisk. \n\nA: The answer is simple. Get 2 USB sticks and get Ubuntu live on one of them and install Ubuntu on the other one using the use Ubuntu live one.\n", "Q: how to split all the files in a directory in to 4gb files to a different directory? I have a directory containing several large files that are each greater than 4gb.   I want to copy all of those files to a different directory (happens to be a fat32 usb drive mounted), but split the files down to 4gb (since the destination drive is limited to that size files).\nI tried this:\nsplit -b 4096G /var/lib/backuppc/images/* /usbdrive/\n\nbut I get a \nsplit: extra operand `/var/lib/backuppc/images/xxxxxxxxxmyfilesname.tib'\n\nAm I doing something wrong?   (also tried  \"4G\" instead of 4096G, no difference)\n\nA: My suggestion would be to first create a tar file:\ntar -cf /tmp/bigfile.tar /var/lib/backuppc/images/*\n\nthen split that:\ncd /usbdrive\nsplit -b 4G /tmp/bigfile.tar\n\nIf you want to avoid use of the temporary tar file you can pipe tar directly to split:\ntar -cf - /var/lib/backuppc/images/* | split -b 4G\n\nTo reconstruct this when you get to the destination, recreate and unarchive the tar file:\ncat /usbdrive/x* >bigfile.tar\ntar -xvf bigfile.tar\n\nAgain, to do this without the temporary file:\ncat /usbdrive/x* | tar -xvf -\n\n\nA: split can't take more than one input file as an argument.\nYou can try using find for this\ncd /var/lib/backuppc/images && find . -maxdepth 1 -type f -exec split -b 4G '{}' \"/usbdrive/images/{}\" \\;\n\n", "Q: How to disable automount in nautilus's preferences I am using Ubuntu 11.10 (64 bits) and I do not want to mount automatically USB thumb drives in my system. I tried the command dconf-editor and gconf-editor but there isn't the icon to disable it in nautilus preferences (apps|nautilus|preferences|media_automount).\nThanks. \n\nA: You first need to install dconf editor in Software Center.

What are the latest news with Adobe AIR?\nIs someone planing to develop a support for AIR. My business is using Adobe AIR for digital signage software on PC. I prefer Linux but without support or any other solution for AIR it means I need to buy Windows licenses. :(\n\nA: Adobe dropped Linux support in version 2.7 but you can still get and install version 2.6. If that's good enough for you, knowing it's not going to get an update, bug fixes or (importantly) security fixes, you can go ahead with that.\nThere is more information about this on their kb page.\nIf the computer is not network-attatched and there's no foreseeable security risk from any flaw in Air, I reckon you could just go with that. I think you'd have to be running untrusted content to ever have any major issues with it.\nOn a side note, Adobe seems to want to transition everything over to HTML5. In the not-too-distant future the tools you're using now (or, more likely an upgraded license of them) might be able to output something you could just load up in a browser (in kiosk mode) on the display, cutting out the need for Air runtimes.\n", "Q: How to install node.js 0.4.7?

The solution I have in mind will incorporate up to 10 laptops sharing a common router, portable server and other network facilities like printer, etc.\nFirstly, I have avoided using Windows because of the excessively large number of updates, extra security software required to keep it stable and malware-free as well as the high cost of support and maintenance needed. I like Mac OS X as it is rock-solid stable, updates are automatic, not too frequent and not too large, but the hardware carries a high premium. I have played with a couple of variants of Linux, but found that some require regular manual updates every week, which makes support a pain.\nQ1. Can Ubuntu be configured for automatic updates for all its software, so that it is completely transparent to the end-user? I basically do not want the end-users fiddling with Ubuntu or any of its applications at all, but at the same time need it to keep itself up to date as far as is possible with minimal intervention. \nSecondly, I have limited bandwidth in some places the system will be used at (e.g. where no landline-based broadband is available) and it will have to run over a 3G wireless internet connection. In this situation I do not want updates to run as bandwidth is precious. Also, even when on the main base-site which has fixed-line broadband, updates for 10 machines will consume a lot of bandwidth.\nI know that if I were to implement a solution based on Mac OS X, the OS X server can be configured to act as a local update cache server. E.g. each of the client laptops would pull their updates from the local LAN server rather than Apple's main update server. Thus update-related bandwidth would be reduced to 10% of what it would be without the update server on the LAN.\nQ2 - does Ubuntu have the ability to time when updates are done (e.g. delay an update until it is at a high-bandwidth site?)\nQ3 - does Ubuntu have the ability to use a local LAN-based server as an Update Cache instead of having to pull updates across from Ubuntu's main repositories?\n\nA: Q1 and Q2\nThe way I know to do this would be to use cron to run a script you write that will check whether the desired conditions exist and then run an appropriate update command such as this (you might need to tweak the command):\napt-get update\napt-get upgrade -y\n\nThere are some scenarios that this might not handle, but with some tweaking and a bit of scripting, you could probably get things working nicely. But you'll probably want to remove update-manager or otherwise disable updates from the graphical environment to prevent a user-visible popup.\nQ3\nBack in the day, I used a program called apt-cacher-ng that served as a caching proxy server for updates and saved me on bandwidth. I don't know its current state, but at the time, it worked perfectly for everything except upgrades from one Ubuntu version to the next--the Ubuntu upgrade tool didn't respect the proxy settings.\n", "Q: Home folder has limit on size, how to remove it? How to understand that picture? home 6.4% and user folder 100%\n\n\nA: Your picture just shows us that your ubuntu folder accounts for 100% of the home folder size which is the expected behavior if you only have one account on this setup. That has nothing to do with quotas or size limits.\n", "Q: How to move a part of my files to another ubuntu one account? I want to give a part of my files to another ubuntu one account, in cause of change of responsibilities...\nBy now, the files are originally stored on my computer and shared to the other account. From now on, it should by vice-versa! The other account should be the source.\nHow can I do this?\n\nA: I think that the easiest way is to copy the files from the share on your computer to some other folder and offer that folder as a share to the other Ubuntu One user.\n\nA: the Ubuntu One client is designed to only support a one account per OS user and the way to handles the configuration files, there's no clean way around this. \nIf you want to switch to a new account without going back to the other account (on Ubuntu):\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure all your files are in sync.\n\n*Backup the files syncing with Ubuntu One (Important in case you mess up any of the following steps)\n\n*Stop ubuntuone u1sdtool -q\n\n*Remove the Ubuntu One metadata: rm -rf  ~/.local/share/ubuntuone\n\n*Remove the openid token in the keyring: run seahorse and delete the key named \"Ubuntu \nOne\"\n\n*Restart Ubuntu One: u1sdtool -c\n\n*When prompted to login, login with the other account.\n\n\nUbuntu One will begin syncing the files to the other account. It may be a good idea to make sure the other account doesn't have the same files. Otherwise you could end up either with a lot of conflicts or in some cases, delete files (put them in the trash)\n", "Q: Stopped discovering Printers Ubuntu 11.10 today on one machine has stopped discovering printers the tick is in the box and noone has changed the settings.

You want to create a python program to capture those?\nWell, Ask Ubuntu is not a programmer's QA, and software development is a bit beyond the scope, but here is a little code I did do capture notification bubbles:\nimport glib\nimport dbus\nfrom dbus.mainloop.glib import DBusGMainLoop\n\ndef notifications(bus, message):\n    if message.get_member() == \"Notify\":\n        print [arg for arg in message.get_args_list()]\n\nDBusGMainLoop(set_as_default=True)\n\nbus = dbus.SessionBus()\nbus.add_match_string_non_blocking(\"interface='org.freedesktop.Notifications'\")\nbus.add_message_filter(notifications)\n\nmainloop = glib.MainLoop()\nmainloop.run()\n\nLeave this running in a terminal, then open another terminal window and test it:\nnotify-send --icon=/usr/share/pixmaps/debian-logo.png \"My Title\" \"Some text body\"\n\nAnd the program will output this:\n[dbus.String(u'notify-send'), dbus.UInt32(0L), dbus.String(u'/usr/share/pixmaps/debian-logo.png'), dbus.String(u'My Title'), dbus.String(u'Some text body'),...\n\nAs you may have guessed, message.get_args_list()[0] is the sender, [2] for icon, [3] for summary and [4] for body text.\nFor the meaning of the other fields, check the official specification docs\n\nA: I had trouble getting any of the other examples to actually work but I got there in the end. Here's a working example:\nimport glib\nimport dbus\nfrom dbus.mainloop.glib import DBusGMainLoop\n\ndef print_notification(bus, message):\n  keys = [\"app_name\", \"replaces_id\", \"app_icon\", \"summary\",\n          \"body\", \"actions\", \"hints\", \"expire_timeout\"]\n  args = message.get_args_list()\n  if len(args) == 8:\n    notification = dict([(keys[i], args[i]) for i in range(8)])\n    print notification[\"summary\"], notification[\"body\"]\n\nloop = DBusGMainLoop(set_as_default=True)\nsession_bus = dbus.SessionBus()\nsession_bus.add_match_string(\"type='method_call',interface='org.freedesktop.Notifications',member='Notify',eavesdrop=true\")\nsession_bus.add_message_filter(print_notification)\n\nglib.MainLoop().run()\n\nIf you want to see a more detailed working example I recommend looking at Notifications.py in the recent_notifications project.\n\nA: To keep this up to date: from dbus 1.5.something an extra parameter is required when adding a match string with bus.add_match_string_non_blocking to make sure we receive everything.\nThe resulting code would be the following: \nimport glib\nimport dbus\nfrom dbus.mainloop.glib import DBusGMainLoop\n\ndef notifications(bus, message):\n    print [arg for arg in message.get_args_list()]\n\nDBusGMainLoop(set_as_default=True)\n\nbus = dbus.SessionBus()\nbus.add_match_string_non_blocking(\"eavesdrop=true, interface='org.freedesktop.Notifications', member='Notify'\")\nbus.add_message_filter(notifications)\n\nmainloop = glib.MainLoop()\nmainloop.run()\n\n\nA: The above example did not work at first, so I made some small changes and now it works perfectly.\nimport gi\nfrom gi.repository import GLib\nimport dbus\nfrom dbus.mainloop.glib import DBusGMainLoop\n\ndef print_notification(bus, message):\n  keys = [\"app_name\", \"replaces_id\", \"app_icon\", \"summary\",\n          \"body\", \"actions\", \"hints\", \"expire_timeout\"]\n  args = message.get_args_list()\n  if len(args) == 8:\n    notification = dict([(keys[i], args[i]) for i in range(8)])\n    print(notification[\"summary\"], notification[\"body\"])\n\nloop = DBusGMainLoop(set_as_default=True)\nsession_bus = dbus.SessionBus()\nsession_bus.add_match_string(\"type='method_call',interface='org.freedesktop.Notifications',member='Notify',eavesdrop=true\")\nsession_bus.add_message_filter(print_notification)\n\nGLib.MainLoop().run()\n\n", "Q: dual boot problems \nPossible Duplicate:\nCan't boot into Windows 7 after installing Ubuntu \n\nI have installed ubuntu 11.10 and now windows 7 cant boot .On startup the screen showing the operating systems appears and I have selected win 7 but the system automatically boot with ubuntu .Using disc utility tool  I  can see the partitions having NTFS file systems .Please help me to fix the error.

I have set up Skype as a startup application. It starts up properly, but not sure what to do without without keeping it fully open. If I close it, the application completely closes. In 10.10 I was able to close it, and it appeared in the top panel notification area.\nI have installed the gnome-shell-classic-systray extension. Also SkypeNotificationExtension but these appear to do nothing.\nIf I close Skype, Skype will still run but there is no way to get to it interface wise. If I kill all instances, then restart Skype manually. It does appear in the panel properly.\nI suppose this maybe a timing issue, but I don't know how to automatically delay Skype until everything else completes.\n\nA: If you select in Skype Options to minimise on startup, it should appear in the system-tray area - this is bottom-right of the screen.\n\nMove your mouse to the bottom-right to reveal this area.  Likewise clicking the \"X\" of the skype window will minimise the application to this area.\nIf you are having timing issues on startup, you can introduce a delay for a Startup-Application by using a command syntax:\nbash -c \"sleep 10 && skype\"\n\nThis will sleep for 10 seconds before starting skype.\n", "Q: Is it possible to install a Swedish font?

The driver can be installed from the Ubuntu repositories, package nvidia-current but that will not work for Optimus laptops.\nUnity3D is broken because the nvidia driver assumes that it's loaded with the graphical server which is not the case because Optimus is not supported out-of-the-box.\nSee Is a NVIDIA GeForce with Optimus Technology supported by Ubuntu? for workarounds and a more detailled explanation.\n\nA: Optimus is a hybrid graphics technology.  It has both Intel and Nvidia graphics.  Problem is that Ubuntu by default lacks functionality for disabling the Intel hardware and letting the system \"be\" Nvidia.  So if you install the Nvidia driver, that disables the Intel 3D functionality; it comes up as an Intel system but with the (invalid) Nvidia 3D driver, soooo no 3D.\nSome hybrid systems allow you to toggle the graphics device in BIOS.  If you are able to do that, you're in luck.  Just toggle off the Intel graphics and install -nvidia.  Otherwise, you're screwed and need to stick with just the -intel driver.  Uninstall (and purge if needed) the proprietary -nvidia driver, to restore 3D functionality.\nThere are some 3rd party workarounds such as Bumblebee, which enable you to more easily toggle between the two options.  However these are not officially supported in Ubuntu so you'll be a bit on your own if you want to go this route.\n", "Q: How can I monitor my Samba traffic? I've got a directory shared on my network, using Samba. People on the netwerk use this Samba share to download files from my share to their computers. I'm interested in what files are downloaded most, and by which users they are downloaded. I'd like to see this in real time, if possible. Is there a program that allows me to do this? If yes, how can I use it?  \nI'm using Ubuntu 11.10.\n\nA: just try next : \nsudo watch smbstatus\n\nThis will continually redisplay a CLI status of SMB connections, like 'top'.\n\nA: You can get Samba to log stuff like that. Check the Samba man pages, via man -k samba. Read man smb.conf and see the sections Log File and Log Level\n\nA: vfs_audit or vfs_full_audit may be best in this case.  The latter allows you to select which events you want to monitor.  See https://serverfault.com/a/736783/127791 for how to configure vfs_full_audit.  In this case I think the open event is the one you'd want (or openat - I found that open wasn't recognized, and then all events were logged).\n", "Q: How do I get an Advent AW10 Printer working? Has anyone managed to get any of the Advent AW series printers working with Linux? Advent support states\n\"All-in-one printers do not support LINUX OS at this time.\nThe all-in-one printers are designed to work with WINDOWS XP, WINDOWS VISTA, and WINDOWS 7 Operating Systems and with MAC OS 10.4.8 or higher.\"\nI wish I had read their website before purchasing the thing! \nAny help much appreciated \n\nA: Unfortunately Advent like Kodak (the technology the advent printers are based on) have never and maybe will never developed Linux drivers for their ESP printer series.\nHowever there is some effort from the community to provide some printing functionality. But this will likely to be not of the extend a Windows driver will offer.\nThere is a sourceforge project providing CUPS drivers for Kodak printers.

But this seems to me very ugly and also uncomfortable. I'm also not sure if it's a good idea to change the shadow file on a running machine (but I suppose so, otherwise vipw -s would kind of useless).\nIs there an alternative?\nThe reason I want to achieve this, is that I'd like to test things or to configure programs for users who aren't able to do on their own. Yeah of course I could do everything on the shell als root or as the specific user (and acutally this is what I'm doing until now), but there are things that you definitly don't want to do on the shell. Did any of you ever try to change the position of the gnome-panel on the shell instead of just selecting \"bottom\"? :)\nI don't think gksudo, sudo or su would help me. I want to have the whole gnome session.\n\nA: *\n\n*Become root\nsudo -i\n\n\n*As root, sudo to the other user\nsu other_user\n\nIf you want to run X applications, take a look at xhost\n\nA: I'm not sure if this is the best way, but here's an option I've just tested, and works on natty although I don't have an extra user set up so I'm not totally sure:\nsudo Xorg :1\n\n(in another terminal)\nsudo -i\nsu - username\nx-session-manager --display :1\n\nThen Ctrl-Alt-F8 and you should find the new session. It might not be exactly same as logging in normally, but I'm pretty sure it'll let you rearrange panels as much as you like.\nUse Ctrl-Alt-F7 to return to your original session. If those F-keys don't work for you, try others.\n\nA: OLD-SCHOOL METHOD\nCreate a ghost user, with the same UID:\ntarget: user1 (change to suit)\ncat /etc/passwd | grep user1\nuser1:x:1001:1001:User1 Q Lastname:/home/user1:/bin/bash\n\nadd your ghost\nsudo useradd -d /home/user1 -f -1 -u 1001 -g 1001 -M -o ghost1 -s /bin/bash -p MySecret\n\ncat /etc/passwd | grep user1\nuser1:x:1001:1001:User1 Q Lastname:/home/user1:/bin/bash\nghost1:x:1001:1001::/home/user1:/bin/bash\n\nsu ghost1\n\nNOTE: You can delete, with 'sudo userdel ghost1', but NOT when either account is logged in.  Failsafe method: delete the new line in '/etc/passwd' file.\n", "Q: An app to create files and folders from a given structure I've seen an app for Mac called Structurer (here a video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXRjneFTs6Q) which given a structure of files and folders like this:\n/folder1\n/folder2\n  /file1\n  /folder2.1\n    /file2.1\n\nwill create this files and folders in a existing place.\nThere is something like that for Ubuntu, or how can i build a shell script to get something like this?\nIf is possible would be cool also to be able to create files using templates.\n\nA: The tricky part is that you have files and folders shown the same way, and no simple way to tell them apart.  For file 2.1 there is not a way to tell if it (/folder2/folder2.1/file2.1) is actually a folder or a file within folder2.1.\nYes your description says the word *file* so we know you mean file, but to a program how could it tell?  A program might tell files from paths because one is followed at the same indentation level with another entry.  BUT, that leads to a set of complicated and confusing rules.\nI would suggest you use a keyword or just full qualified names.  The easiest is:\n\n/folder1/\n/folder2/\n/folder2/file1\n/folder2/folder2.1/\n/folder2/folder2.1/file2.1\n\nThe trailing slash means \"This is a folder and not a file.\"  Then you can have an easy script like this to create your directory structure.  A couple warnings about this script.\n\n*\n\n*the higher level directories must be created first.\n\n*I prepend a \".\" to the path so all directories created are relative to the one in which the script is run.\n\n*I do no error checking for the content of the dir/path file.\n\n\n#!/bin/sh -v\n#\n# builds a directory and file structure.\n# directories must exists before referenced or file in the directory declared.\n#\n# sample input looks like (without the leading #):\n# /folder1/\n# /folder2/\n# /folder2/file1\n# /folder2/folder2.1/\n# /folder2/folder2.1/file2.1\n#\n# make sure we have our one and only input parameter.\nif [ $# != 1 ]; then\n        echo \"Usage: `basename $0` input_file_name\"\n        echo \"input_file_name contains absolute dir paths with a trailing slash,\"\n        echo \"or absolute file path/name with no trailing slash.\"\n        exit 1\nfi\n\n# get the file name from the command line\nFILE=$1\n\n# make sure the input parameter specifies a file.\nif [ ! -e ${FILE} ]; then\n        echo \"Sorry, the file ${FILE} does not exist.\"\n        exit 1\nfi\n\nfor LINE in $(cat $FILE)\ndo\n        LAST=$(echo ${LINE} | awk -F/ '{print $(NF)}')\n        # if file ends with a slash, this value is blank, if it is no slash, this is the file name.\n        if [ \"${LAST}XXX\" = \"XXX\" ]; then\n                # is empty, so it is directory, future feature to check exist already\n                mkdir \".${LINE}\"\n        else\n                # is not empty, so it is a file\n                touch \".${LINE}\"\n        fi\ndone\nexit 0\n\n\nThis will create the directories and files as shown in the input file.  If the script is called create.sh and you have chmod 755 create.sh then the command ./create.sh data will generate your directories and files as described in the data file.\n", "Q: How to restore a mozbackup file made in windows 7? I made a complete backup of Firefox, I used mozbackup, while on windows 7. How do i restore a mozbackup made archive(.pcv) in Ubuntu using Firefox?\n\nA: I can't test this right now, but assuming mozbackup is just an archive, rename the pcv extension to zip, extract it and move the files to your profile folder. \nYour profile is located under: ~/.mozilla/firefox/*****.default/\n\nA: Looking at the support section of the website there is no version for linux,\n\nWhere is a Linux or Mac OS X version?

The script backs up the archive to a NFS mounted directory, but you can transfer the archive with ssh (scp) or rsync or just about any network protocol.\n", "Q: Touchpad stops working after suspend on a Clevo M55N simple problem:\nTouchpad stops working after suspend in Ubuntu 11.10.

Read man pm-powersave and man pm-suspend. Also read /usr/share/doc/pm-utils/README{,.debugging}.  \nSome helpful Power Manager script is probably causing your touchpad problem. Either it's not saving/restoring the touchpad state or not reloading a needed module.  \nLook at dmesg after a reboot, and try to see how your touchpad is initialized. Compare the output of lsmod both post-boot-pre-suspend (when it works) and post-suspend (when it doesn't). If a module is missing from the latter, you're on your way to a solution.\nAnother debugging technique is to begin in the post-boot-pre-suspend state, and do:\n\n\n*\n\n*touch /tmp/before-time-date  \n\n*Close the Lid and Suspend.  \n\n*Open the Lid and Resume.  \n\n*Find system logs that have changed since step 1:\nfind /var/logs  -type f -anewer /tmp/before-time-date  \n\n*Look at the last several-to-many lines of each of these files. I use less, and have my favorite settings in an environment variable, $LESS=-XMersj3. so I can do:\nsudo -v;find /var/logs -type f -anewer /tmp/before-date-time -print | xargs sudo less $LESS\nthen use less's G (uppercase ) command to get to the end of each file.   \n\n\nA: Had a similar problem with my wireless USB mouse/ keyboard (Logitech) on (L)ubuntu 12.04 LTS.

Is there any command line interface to tell my server how to connect to the ubuntu one account? \n\nA: As far as I know, the Ubuntu one server side software is proprietary, so that it is impossible to host your own Ubuntu One server. However there are several other techniques that can be employed in order to share your files across multiple computers. There is\n\n\n*\n\n*sshfs: a filesystem which allows you to mount any remote file system you can access via SSH. So basically all you need on your server is an SSH server running and sshfs on your clients. sshfs mounts can be automatically mounted using the /etc/fstab file or using autofs.\n\n*nfs: the network file system is rather more complicated to deploy and (if not used correctly) has security issues. To my shame I have not looked into it deeply.\n\n*rsync: of course as bodhi.zazen suggests, you can always use rsync to \"backup\" your files. The problem with rsync is that unlike the Microsoft SyncToy out of the box it does not do two-way merging (and I am yet to find the option in rsync for that). Also unlike the two suggestions outlined above rsync does true synchronization as opposed to sharing one file system which is what the other two do. This has an upside: all changes are immediately shared between clients, and a downside: the mount is only available, when internet connectivity is available.\n\n*git: another option I may suggest to you, if you are manly working with text files is git. you can use it in a similar fashion as rsync but you gain the ability to roll back changes and better merge support (what happens, when two clients modify a file?). The downsides of this solution are a much higher disk space consumption (all of the incremental updates have to live somewhere) and a complicated user interface (as git is a source control tool, one has to create commits to share documents).\n\nA: For your needs you can use rsync. \nThe basic syntax is \nrsync -az -e ssh /home/path/directory_to_sync/ remoteuser@server:/home/path/directory_to_sync\n\nAs you can see, rsync will work over ssh (remoteuser@server) and is thus quite secure.\nrsync will only transfer files that have changed (so it saves on bandwidth) and can be run from cron , as root if you would want to sync /home for example.\nSee the ubuntu rsync page for details.\n\nA: While officially we don't support working without X and GNOME, some people have succeeded: http://per.liedman.net/2011/01/22/using-ubuntu-one-for-backup-on-a-headless-server/ YMMV\n", "Q: Removing openjdk-6-jre without the installation of sun-java6-jre I have alrady installed (manually, from the .bin file) the latest jre (Version 6 Update 30) from oracle and now i want to remove the openjdk-6-jre.

I had partitioned my 320 GB hard-disk into to partitions with about 100 GB for Ubuntu and the rest was reserved for Win7. I then upgraded to 11.10 and everything worked just fine.\nMy problems started when I accidentally choose the wrong option in the grub menu. I imagine it was something like the Windows Recovery-option because it led me to the \"Acer eRecovery System Manager\". The computer worked for sometime and came up with these three options (not sure if these were the exact words, but still) :\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete all on the hard-disk and reset the computer to factory\ndefault settings.\n\n*Save all personal data and then reset the computer to factory default settings.\n\n*Exit.\n\n\nAs I just wanted to boot Windows I opted for choice number 3 (exit). The computer then shut down and when I started it up again I got the grub-rescue menu.\nI then got into a lot of problems, but I managed to save all my documents from the Win7 and Ubuntu partitions by using a LiveCD for Ubuntu 11.04. At this moment GParted told my that the old partition reserved for Ubuntu was unallocated, but it still showed me the Win7 partition.\nAt the moment I got the Windows 7 up and running, but I want to get back to Ubuntu !!\nSo that was a long story, but I thought it may be important. \nI have partially abandoned the idea of getting back to Ubuntu as before, so now I'm trying to install Ubuntu 11.10 from a LiveCD. \nWhen I get to the Installation Type in the install menu I get this :\n(edit : figured out I'm not allowed to post images...)\nThe menu shows that I may only chose the /dev/sda which has 320.1 GB.\nGParted gives me this: (edit: figured out I'm not allowed to post images)\nGparted shows that I got no partitions and the whole /dev/sda section is unallocated (298.09 GB).\nSo where have my partitions gone now\nThey have to be there somewhere becausesudo fdisk -l` gives me this :\nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo fdisk -l\n\nDisk /dev/sda: 320.1 GB, 320072933376 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 38913 cylinders, total 625142448 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x93859385\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sda1            2048    24578047    12288000   27  Hidden NTFS WinRE\n/dev/sda2   *    24578048    24782847      102400    7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n/dev/sda3        24782848   508650024   241933588+   7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n/dev/sda4       508650030   625153409    58251690    f  W95 Ext'd (LBA)\n/dev/sda5       508651520   616964095    54156288   83  Linux\n/dev/sda6       616966144   625141743     4087800   82  Linux swap / Solaris\n\nSo my question is : what should I do to get installed Ubuntu on my computer as before ?\nIt doesn't really bother me if I have to reinstall Ubuntu, but if you think it's possible to save the old version lost somewhere on my hard-disk I'd be grateful :-D\nHere are some information about my CPU :\n    ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ cat /proc/cpuinfo\n    processor   : 0\n    vendor_id   : GenuineIntel\n    cpu family  : 6\n    model       : 23\n    model name  : Genuine Intel(R) CPU           U4100  @ 1.30GHz\n    stepping    : 10\n    cpu MHz     : 1200.000\n    cache size  : 2048 KB\n    physical id : 0\n    siblings    : 2\n    core id     : 0\n    cpu cores   : 2\n    apicid      : 0\n    initial apicid  : 0\n    fpu     : yes\n    fpu_exception   : yes\n    cpuid level : 13\n    wp      : yes\n    flags       : fpu vme de pse tsc msr pae mce cx8 apic sep mtrr pge mca cmov         pat pse36 clflush dts acpi mmx fxsr sse sse2 ss ht tm pbe syscall nx lm         constant_tsc arch_perfmon pebs bts rep_good nopl aperfmperf pni dtes64 monitor         ds_cpl est tm2 ssse3 cx16 xtpr pdcm xsave lahf_lm dts\n    bogomips    : 2593.34\n    clflush size    : 64\n    cache_alignment : 64\n    address sizes   : 36 bits physical, 48 bits virtual\n    power management:\n\n    processor   : 1\n    vendor_id   : GenuineIntel\n    cpu family  : 6\n    model       : 23\n    model name  : Genuine Intel(R) CPU           U4100  @ 1.30GHz\n    stepping    : 10\n    cpu MHz     : 1200.000\n    cache size  : 2048 KB\n    physical id : 0\n    siblings    : 2\n    core id     : 1\n    cpu cores   : 2\n    apicid      : 1\n    initial apicid  : 1\n    fpu     : yes\n    fpu_exception   : yes\n    cpuid level : 13\n    wp      : yes\n    flags       : fpu vme de pse tsc msr pae mce cx8 apic sep mtrr pge mca cmov         pat pse36 clflush dts acpi mmx fxsr sse sse2 ss ht tm pbe syscall nx lm         constant_tsc arch_perfmon pebs bts rep_good nopl aperfmperf pni dtes64 monitor         ds_cpl est tm2 ssse3 cx16 xtpr pdcm xsave lahf_lm dts\n    bogomips    : 2593.48\n    clflush size    : 64\n    cache_alignment : 64\n    address sizes   : 36 bits physical, 48 bits virtual\n    power management:\n\n\nA: Sounds as if your partition table is corrupt.

I've noticed that empty directories get deleted from /var/run/ on reboot. I'm wondering if that's something Ubuntu does or something that I have installed.\n\nA: /var/run is a symlink on /run and that's just a tmpfs mount created on boot. Everything in it is stored in RAM and dies at reboot.\nSo things are already slightly different. I can't see anything about tmpfs being set up to autoclean other than on reboots though and I've just run through this:\nsudo mkdir /run/pie\nsudo touch /run/pie/pies\nsudo rm /run/pie/pies\nls # /run/pie/ still exists, empty\n\nSo it might be just you - or it might be a cleanup daemon.

Please help me as soon as you can. Are there extra things that I need to do with Wine to make this work? For those of you who may have installed Wine, what did you do. I am SO unsure why this is happening.\n\nA: Steam does work on wine, although there are a few things that needs to be done to make it run flawlessly, such as installing microsoft core-fonts and a few library replacements. The easiest method of installing wine is using winetricks. Uninstall Steam first, then install winetricks, start winetricks and pick Steam for the installation. Note that apps installed through winetricks are installed into a prefixed environment, therefore if you want to start Steam.exe through command line for whatever reason, you must set the WINEPREFIX environment variable (otherwise it will be run in wine's default environment). Steam can install a shortcut in the Desktop and Start Menu, and wine is smart enough to add WINEPREFIX to those shortcuts, so they're the best option to start a prefixed app.\n", "Q: Force network-manager to use wireless for an Internet connection I have a Ubuntu 10.10 laptop running two VirtualBox machines that I want to use to demonstrate how an application can connect to a networked database. I use a stand-alone (not connected to the Internet) billion route to ensure the IP addresses of the virtual machines stay constant.\nI need to connect the host computer to the Internet but I understand that network-manager automatically uses the wired network for Internet connections.\nHow can I force network-manager to use a wireless or USB tethered device for the Internet connection while maintaining a wired connection?\n\nA: Create a new wired connection that is the same as the one you have already. Then edit the connection and go to IPv4 Settings -> Routes -> Use this connection only for resources on its network and tick the box.\n\nThe connection will use another connection for general Internet traffic.\n\nA: I'd suggest setting up a route for the IP address of the server.\nAssume that we're on the server, with both wired(eth0) and wireless (wlan0) interfaces up. If the IP address of the database node (that you want to access wirelessly) is 192.168.59.40.\nThen, do:\nsudo ip route add 192.168.59.40 dev wlan0 \nThis tells the system that packets destined for 192.168.59.40 have a low \"cost\" route, and that it's out through wlan0.\nYou can undo this via:\nsudo ip route del 192.168.59.40 dev wlan0 \nAnd, of course, read man ip before you do anything.\n", "Q: How long does a distribution upgrade normally take? As the title says, how long does a distribution upgrade (e.g. from 11.04 to 11.10) usually take, discounting the download phase? I've been upgrading from Natty to Oneiric, the download only takes about 1 hour, but now I've been in the \"Installing the upgrades\" phase for more than 5 hours already. The progress bar has been stuck saying \"About 2 hours 55 minutes remaining\" in the last 3 hours, and the remaining time is not decreasing. The detailed view (Terminal view) still scrolls printing stuffs that it's installing, so the upgrade is still running, albeit ever so slowly.\nIn short, is it normal that the Ubuntu upgrade takes this long? Fresh install, as I remember, takes about an hour or so from inserting the CD to booting to the harddisk; I had expected that an upgrade may take longer than fresh install, but not by this much.\nSecond question, why does it take so long to upgrade vs fresh install? Certainly not the download time, since that takes about the same time, about an hour for both fresh install and upgrade. It's the installation phase that takes so long.\nThe upgrade finally finished a couple of hours after I posted, I'm still not sure why it takes so long; however when debugging another (possibly) unrelated performance problem in my program (running on this same laptop), I found out that SQLite is excruciatingly slow on ext4 (in my case, a 10 second operation turns to 5 minute), because ext4 enabled write-barrier by default. The root of the slow upgrade might be the same since distribution upgrade also involves a lot of disk writes.\n\nA: I recently hopped a server from 9.10 to 11.10 (4 separate upgrades) in a couple of hours. There was significantly less to do on each upgrade and it was downloading at a stupidly fast speed but that should give you a lower bound.\nUpgrading does take longer than reinstalling. Not only do you have to download the packages but they have to extract and configure themselves, running all sorts of nonsense to ensure stability. Most installed systems tend to have more packages than a fresh install too.\nBut what you're going through does not sound normal. I'd watch the terminal view for a little while to make sure it's not doing the same thing over and over and over again, if it is, you might need to put together a Plan B.\nIf it looks like it's working properly - just leave it as long as you can bear and see what happens.\n\nA: I just upgraded from Ubuntu server 19.10 to 20.04 running on DigitalOcean with minimal resources and it took about 30 minutes.\nI would just not recommend running the do-release-upgrade command via SSH.\n\nA: It depends on your computer. With a fast computer it should take about 1 hour - 1 hour and 30 minutes.\n\n12.04 ----> 12.10 1h-1h30m\n12.10 ----> 13.04 1h-1h30m\n\n", "Q: How do I create a new keyboard layout?

But when I boot up with my 10.04 live CD, everything works just fine.\nDoes anybody have a clue what the problem might be?\nWhat follows is a rather long exposition explaining the things I've done so far:\nI installed Ubuntu 10.04 from a CD 2 days ago.  I entered the password for my network, and connected flawlessly.  I then went through the process of upgrading to 11.10, one version at a time.  My internet was still okay for the rest of the day.\nNext day I boot up.  I am prompted for my network password.  I enter it, then wait.  I'm prompted again, and again and again.  After a while I decide to reboot with my 10.04 disc.  I enter my password, everything is fine.  I reboot to 11.10, and things are working again, no problems for the rest of the day.\nToday, same story.  I boot up 11.10, enter password, again, again, again.  Try out a Kubuntu 11.10 disc, no dice.  Then back to my 10.04 disc and I'm good.  Now I try going back to 11.10, not working.  Back to 10.04, working.  Back to 11.10, not working.  Back to 10.04, working.  And that's where I am now, running 10.04 from a live CD.\nIn case you are wondering, yes I am absolutely certain that I am entering the correct password.\nDetails about my system:\nHere is my pci info: http://www.pasteall.org/27577/text\nI assume the Network card is most relevant here:\n01:09.0 Network controller: Atheros Communications Inc.

Then select 'wireless' and your current profile (if it's there, if not, add it) then fill in the details manually.\nOtherwise, did you install any drivers for another wifi device? When I first installed ubuntu, I installed drivers for my Wifi USB dongle which actually stopped it from working, when I uninstalled them the native drivers were more than sufficient to run it.\n", "Q: Nautilus launchers stopped working properly I have been trying to make a launcher with a quicklist item for 'root file browser' using command 'gksudo nautilus'. After I updated to this launcher in the unity sidebar, each time I click the icon (which still points to the normal nautilus for left click) a separate nautilus icon appears elsewhere in the sidebar with the title 'Files'.

Everything works fine except the supsend/resume option. The NoteBook goes into suspension, but does not resume back when I press the power or any other button.\nI don't know where to start debugging the problem. Could someone provide me pointers?\n\nA: The best place to start debugging this is the community wiki.\nSome general pointers:\n\n\n*\n\n*Some suspend issues are due to buggy BIOS's - incorrect ACPI information is being passed to the kernel and thus preventing resume.\n\n*Some BIOS's need to have their \"S3\" setting enabled - S3: Suspend to RAM - it is worth having a look through the bios settings for a similarly named option.\n\n*Have a look at the MythTV ACPI wiki - some useful reading there.  You may or may not pm-utils package.\n\n*Have a look at the suspend log to see if there are any obvious errors or issues: /var/log/pm-suspend.log\n\n*There are some good comments on Code-Central for a potential solution for some laptops - looking through the comments, some people have reported that the solution there works for 11.10 users.\n\n*Whilst not undertaken likely - look at the HP website for your BIOS release notes.  Good manufacturers such as HP regularly issue BIOS updates.  If the release notes mention hibernate/suspend issues, then maybe a BIOS update will resolve your issue\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 10 or 11 installation on MacMini Server 5,3 I have the latest MacMini Server with the i7 Quad core running OSX lion server.\nHas anyone had any luck getting Ubuntu 10 or 11 to run on the latest MacMini's?

Most hardware was supported, from the HDMI out to ethernet.\nI didn't actually install because I was unable to get WiFi and sound to work. If you are planning to use the machine as a true and pure server, it should be fine (especially headless).\nNote: on Mini 5,3 i7 2.0 GHz quad with 16GB RAM\n", "Q: Why don't my Fn keys work for brightness or media after upgrading? I recently upgraded from 11.04 to 11.10. After the upgrade, I can no longer adjust the screen brightness or the volume using keyboard (before the upgrade, using Fn+F4, Fn+F11, etc. worked). \nUsing Fn+F2 to disable wireless still works, so I guess the Fn key itself is being recognised.\nI tried to follow the instructions here, but I don't have a file in /etc/X11 called xorg.conf.\nI also tried following this workaround, but it had no noticeable effect. \nI've also tried going to Settings → Keyboard → Shortcuts and reassigning the brightness and volume controls, both to the default keys and to new combinations. These changes don't have an effect even after rebooting. \nGoogling has found bug reports where pressing the media keys brings up a \"no entry sign\" rather than changing the volume. When I press the keys there's no response at all. \nI've also seen various people say a workaround is to have totem running in the background; this doesn't work for me either. \nFinally, I tried installing keytouch; I was able to install keytouch-editor but got the message \"Unable to locate package keytouch\". \nAny more ideas? I'd be very grateful if anyone could help me (even by pointing to a thread I've missed)!\n\nA: I discovered that running gnome-settings-daemon fixes this issue (and gives me a functional battery status indicator again), so I added it to my startup commands. \n", "Q: How to solve configure: error: readline library not found? I have an Ubuntu 10.04 LTS server with a minimal install that I want to compile postgres on. With the minimal install the server did not have gcc so I had to do an apt-get install gcc but now I keep getting this error from the postgres ./configure.\nconfigure: error: readline library not found\n\nI can't seem to find the name of the package that contains the readline library. So I have two questions.\n\n\n*\n\n*What is the name of the package that contains readline?\n\n*Is there some way given the error message above for me to find the associated package from its standard name?\n\n\nA: You probably need to install libreadline-dev.\nA quick way to search for packages in cases like this is to use a command like:\napt-cache search libreadline\n\nThis command will likely list multiple packages, but if you're interested in compiling things from source then the package ending in -dev probably contains the files the configure script is searching for.\n", "Q: Safe adding and removing cron jobs from shell script? I need to create a package, which should add itself to list of cron jobs, and remove it from that list on deinstallation.\nHow can I do it without possibility of screwing the crontab file? Maybe there are some utils?\n\nA: Instead of adding your lines to a crontab, you should just place a file inside /etc/cron.d/. \nSee https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CronHowto#Advanced_Crontab:\n\nThe second type of crontab is to be found in /etc/cron.d. Within the directory are small named crontabs. The directory is often used by packages, and the small crontabs allows a user to be associated with the commands in them.\n\n", "Q: How to search entire hard drive for a file? Trying to locate a file, how can I search the entire hard drive for a file?\n\nA: If you're looking for a string inside a file, you can use grep. Here's a sample command: \ngrep -r -i \"some string\" /home/yourusername\n\nThis will find \"some string\" in /home/yourusername directory. The search will ignore case (-i) and recurse directories (-r). You can use / as the directory to search in the whole directory but that might not be very efficient. \n\nA: You could also use locate to look for commands. Why do people use locate if find does the job? Because locate is much faster than find since it just searches through database(s) of indexed locations to find your file/regex.\nExamples: \nlocate some-file.avi searches through database(s) of almost every file on the disk for a file called \"some-file.avi\".\nlocate -i \"some-file.avi\" will ignore the case of the file you are searching for.\nlocate -i \"*.txt\" will display a list of locations of all the files with **.txt* extension on your system.\nman locate for more info on the file.\nYou might need to run updatedb first to ensure the index database is up to date, otherwise, 'locate' might not return what you are looking for.\n\nA: On Ubuntu, i know that everyone wants to be dogmatic about using command line all the time, and I have in the past been that way, but I love the Gnome \"Search for files...\" tool.  I think its awesome.\n\nA: For a Desktop setup, Install \"gnome-search-tool\"\nsudo apt-get install gnome-search-tool\nDon't install this in a server, it will also install the ubuntu desktop package.\nThanks to @Rinzwind for pointing that out.\nFilters inlude:\n\n\n*\n\n*Choose the folder you want to search. In this case \\\n\n*Contains the text - this is the file name.\n\n*Date Modified - less or more than in number of days.\n\n*File size - at least or at most a specified size. You can also search empty files.\n\n*File owner - user, group or unrecognized owner.\n\n*Regular expressions - matches regular expressions.\n\n*You can choose to show hidden files, follow symbolic links or exclude other filesystems.\n\n\n\n\nA: A simple find / -type f -name \"\" would do the trick if you know exact filename. \nfind / -type f -iname \"filename*\" if you want to match more files (ignore case).\nAvoid -type option if you want to search for directories etc. See manual of find for more information. To see the manual, issue the command: \nman find\n\nA: If you don't want to remember find (which is a very powerful) parameters you could install from official repos:\n\n\n*\n\n*kfind - file search utility\n\n*gnome-search-tool - GNOME tool to search files\n\n*catfish - File searching tool which is configurable via the command line\n\n\nThe three of them are great, but I found kfind the best.\nFrom Ubuntu Community help wiki you might find useful:\n\n\n*\n\n*dpkg -L|--listfiles  ...     List files `owned' by package(s).\n\n*dpkg -S|--search  ...        Find package(s) owning file(s).\n\n\nA: Start by clicking the \"Home Folder\" icon in the launcher.\n\nIn the window that opens, click \"Search\".\n\nType what you want to search for in the box, then press enter.\n\nUnder the dropdown for location, choose your hard drive, then click reload.\n\nThe results will then be displayed. Hope that helps!\n\nA: If need to find nested in some dirs:\nfind / -type f -wholename \"*foo/bar/filename\"\n\n\nA: If you want to find a file or its contents, and you don't want the search to stop if your ssh session gets disconnected for some reason, and you want to store the results in a file that you can reference later:\n$ sudo nohup find / -type f -exec grep -H -i -n mysearchstring '{}' \\; -print 2>/dev/null | tee /home/rmoore/find_output.txt &\n\n", "Q: Who compiles all the packages that are part of ubuntu? When an Ubuntu release is being made who compiles all the versions of the programs that are part of ubuntu and determines which version will ship with the release. For example, which version of postgres, or open office, or firefox? \nDo paid Canonical employees do the compiling and selection of packages or is it pushed to community members to select and compile packages for a release?\n\nA: Ubuntu Developers (there are many groups, see the linked page) don't compile the software on their own machines, though they do before uploading it to test it. \nThey upload a source package to a build farm which compiles all the packages for all the different architectures. You can see a list of uploads as an example of what packages are being uploaded to the Launchpad builders, which then build it and then publish it to the Ubuntu archive, which is then mirrored around the world.\nThe linked wiki page shows you the list of team, you can click on each team to see who is a developer for that team. \nUbuntu Developers as a group are composed of both Canonical employees and community contributors, though the bulk of the Ubuntu archive is imported from Debian and just rebuilt to use the Ubuntu toolchain.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopers has more details.\n\n\nThe version that is included in Ubuntu usually depends on the latest stable release of something available before Feature Freeze; in some cases it can be settled on ahead of time (like the kernel), or in other cases it will be whatever the latest stable release is (like Firefox), or in other cases it will be whatever version of the package was in Debian at the time. \nThe choice of which packages make up a specific image is made by that project lead(s) by what seeds are selected.  For instance, the Kubuntu community decides for Kubuntu.   During the release cycle,  the actual version to be included gets decide by developers and the release team.  \n\nA: Each package has a maintainer who compiles the packages with all its dependencies. This may be a layman or a paid empoyee of canonical.\n", "Q: First update after fresk Kubuntu install hangs because of dpkg - now what? I installed a clean Kubuntu 11.10 64bit on a Dell Latitude E6500. Rebooted after install, ran the update manager Muon first thing, said apply all upgrades, and then at 57% (\"Running dpkg\") the progress bar freezes and that's it. \nNo external drive attached, plenty of space on the hard drive, and this is the third clean install attempt. (On that same computer, Ubuntu 11.10 and Mint 11 worked just fine). Any ideas?\n\nA: I had the same problem.  I opened a terminal window and did the following:\nps -e | grep muon\n\nThis identified the process.  Then (number identifed above):\nsudo kill ####\n\nI then rebooted.  After which:\nsudo dpkg --configure -a\n\nI then did:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -f\n\nnow everything is fine.\n\nA: Just to add, I believe what you saw was reported on this bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/kde-workspace/+bug/855793 .\nIn the near-future, I would recomend using synaptic/apt-get/aptitude for doing upgrades.\n\nA: I tried the sudo dpkg --configure -a approach listed above and it did not help.  I have also tried it on a virtual machine which wont even run after the update.  However, I have found another approach which did work at least on Vmware (haven't tested on a real machine yet)\nFrom a fresh install of Kubuntu 11.10 with no updates.\nOpen a terminal (using Ctrl+Alt+T to save some time) and install aptitude.\nsudo apt-get install aptitude\nsudo aptitude update\nsudo aptitude safe-upgrade\n\nIt takes a long time to update but it doesn't hang during the process.\nI also tried the whole thing with synaptic and it also ran fine afterwords.\nOne thing to note is that after using either approach the Software Center aka muon-installer will no longer run due to some file ownership issues.\n", "Q: Removing gnome-screensaver also wants to remove gnome-core I am on Ubuntu 11.10.  I hope to be able to replace gnome-screensaver with xscreensaver.

I have dual monitor set up in Ubuntu 11.10. I want to have a single wallpaper spanned across both monitors. How do I do this?\n\nA: if using gnome-shell, in tweak tool under desktop there is an option to have the image span the desktop. This makes it go across both monitors(or all).\nNo Nitrogen Necessary\nUnity also has this same option as shown below:\n\n\nA: Using GNOME-tweaks\nsudo apt install gnome-tweak-tool\n\n\n\nA: First you need a wallpaper large enough for both monitors. You can either make one with the gimp or down load one. Alternately you can use a separate image for each monitor.\nYou can then install a handy little application, nitrogen\nsudo apt-get install nitrogen\n\nYou then run nitrogen with the path to the directory with your picture(s)\nnitrogen ~/Pictures\n\nAnd select the image. At the bottom of nitrogen, select \"automatic\" and \"Full screen\" as options. alternately you can use nitrogen to set a separate image on each screen, up to you (sort of depends on your background images).\n\n\nA: Take a look at this link:\nhttp://www.virtual-nexus-inc.com/news/2011/09/21/ubuntu-11-04-dual-monitor-backgrounds-are-easy-with-shotwell/\nyou can use shotwell to resize te image as your combined monotors resolution then set it as background using the default image viewer of ubuntu.\n\nA: Nitrogen answer works, but another tweak is necessary.\nRun Advanced Settings in Gnome Tweak Tool, go to Desktop section and switch Have file manager handle the desktop off. Then wallpapers set via Nitrogen will be displayed.\nIf you do not have the Gnome Tweak Tool, you can use this command instead. It's an easier solution, too:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background show-desktop-icons false\n\nHowever there is strong disadvantage. All icons disappear from the desktop and the context menu can't be invoked. Unless you need icons on desktop this solution may be useful for you.\n\nA: I do not appear to be able to add a comment to an answer due to my low rep (lolz), so this is meant to be on @topr's answer.\nI am the author of Nitrogen and there is code in there to detect a gnome desktop and set it properly so that you don't need to make this change, but it appears to not be functioning on modern Ubuntus.  I will investigate.\nIssue:\nhttps://github.com/l3ib/nitrogen/issues/16\n\nA: For Ubuntu 16.04 and higher versions which don't offer a 'span' option in the settings or no options at all, you can run the following command to force a span setting:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-options spanned\n\nThe effect is instant.\nI've tried this with 18.04, but it seems like it should work with 16.04 and up.\nSource\n\nA: I will suggest the same as @Alex Nolasco, however, the gnome-tweak-tool has no longer support for Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Package 'gnome-tweak-tool' has no installation candidate)\nInstead of that you can install the latest gnome-tweaks\nsudo apt install gnome-tweaks\n\nand run gnome-tweaks, go to the Adjustment and select Spanned from the drop down menu.

Now am I stuck with what I have when installing 11.10 (Just like Mac and Windows), or am I just being ignorant?\n\nA: A major reason why Unity and GNOME Shell (which is what I assume you meant by GNOME 3.x) are seemingly not as customizable at the moment is that they are still relatively new software fresh out of development, and developers are still ironing out bugs first before implementing more controls.\nThat being said, both Unity and GNOME Shell already have a lot of configuration options available. See How can I configure Unity? for information on how you can go about customizing Unity, and extensions.gnome.org for a list of GNOME Shell extensions you can install straight from your web browser to change the functionality and appearance of GNOME Shell.

Afterward you can initiate it from the menu and pin the icon or drag and drop it to the bar.\nNote that the menu names are those in PyCharm as I don't use IntelliJ, but they are likely the same.\n\nA: This .desktop file worked for me, using IntelliJ 11:\n#!/usr/bin/env xdg-open\n\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nType=Application\nTerminal=false\nIcon=/home/mizu/Programs/IntelliJ/bin/idea_CE128.png\nExec=/bin/sh /home/mizu/Programs/IntelliJ/bin/idea.sh\nName=IntelliJ\nStartupNotify=true\nStartupWMClass=jetbrains-idea-ce\n\n\nA: I didn't see the menu entry in IDEA 10.5 for creating the desktop file, but you can easily create one by hand.    \nHere is my .desktop file (for IDEA 10.5 ultimate edition) :\n#!/usr/bin/env xdg-open\n\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nType=Application\nTerminal=false\nIcon=/usr/local/share/devtools/idea-IU-107.105/bin/idea128.png\nExec=/bin/sh /usr/local/share/devtools/idea-IU-107.105/bin/idea.sh\nName=IntelliJ\nStartupNotify=true\nStartupWMClass=com.intellij.idea.Main\n\nIn case you're new to unity, you can just drag that .desktop file to the launcher. \n\nA: This web describes the universal steps which could be used customizing window matching...works perfectly for other desktops as well:\nhttp://wiki.go-docky.com/index.php?title=How_to_Customize_Window_Matching\nSimplified:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start your (Java) application\n\n*Execute: xprop | grep WM_CLASS | awk '{print $4}'\n\n*Add this line to applications's myapp.desktop file\nStartupWMClass=output_from_step_2__without_quotes\n\n\nExample:\n    StartupWMClass=net-sourceforge-squirrel_sql-client-Main\n\nA: To make Intellij IDEA 12.1 work with Ubuntu 12.04+:\n1> Create a file named: ~/.local/share/applications/jetbrains-idea.desktop\n2> Add this content to the file:\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nType=Application\nName=IntelliJ IDEA\nIcon=<YOUR-IDEA-FOLDER>/bin/idea.png\nExec=\"<YOUR-IDEA-FOLDER>/bin/idea.sh\" %f\nComment=Develop with pleasure!\nCategories=Development;IDE;\nTerminal=false\nStartupNotify=true\nStartupWMClass=jetbrains-idea\n\n3> Reboot the system\nNow you will have the best IDE fully working on your Ubuntu.\n\nA: *\n\n*Open the software by ./idea.sh from bin folder\n\n*In the IntelliJ IDEA click on Tools > Create desktop entry...\n\n*Right click on IntelliJ icon on launcher and stick it there by locking it.\n\n", "Q: How to bring the top panel to the bottom from command line? I would like to bring that top panel to bottom via command line. Is there any command to do that from terminal? I have searched everywhere, i haven't find one. Can any one share a command to bring the top panel to bottom?\nNote:\nI just prefer command line coz i have to do it in all remote machines. I know the way to bring the panel to bottom via GUI method.\n\nA: You should be able to use gconftool-2 to do this.\nUsing the GUI tool gconf-editor:\n\nThe top-panel is found in the key orientation in the path /apps/panel/toplevels/top_panel_screen0\nYou will see in the GUI tool the values this key takes - thus to force the top-panel to move to the bottom you would use:\ngconftool-2 -t string -s /apps/panel/toplevels/top_panel_screen0/orientation \"bottom\"\n\nthe parameters are\n\n\n*\n\n*-t string which means the value to set is a string value\n\n*-s which means set the key where this is the full path including the key-name\n\n*\"bottom\" - this is the string value for the key\n\n", "Q: Improving the quality of reduced website screenshots in GIMP I'm trying to improve the quality of reduced screenshots of websites in GIMP.\nThis is waht I do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Scale the image using the Sinc interpolation.\n\n*Apply some blur (0.5)\n\n\nThis is the result:\n\nI would like to know if the quality of my result is closer to this one:\n\nIf not, what other techniques do you recommend to improve the screenshot?\n\nA: Sinc is broken.\nTry this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Figure out ratio between source image and final image (e.g. 1200px width to become 600px give you 2\n\n*Apply Gaussian blur with that value \n\n*Scale down with linear interpolation\n\n*Apply sharpening to your liking\n\n", "Q: SQL modeling and design tools? I would like to know which tool do you use for modeling tables, relationships, etc, generic database modeling, in Ubuntu.\nIt would be good if that tool generate SQL scripts, and a plus with those scripts are SQLite compatible, but thats not necessary.\nCurrently, I am using Enterprise Architect for that under a virtual machine, which kind of sucks. I was able to run it under Wine, but not as good as I want to. It is a complete tool for modeling anything in this world, and right now I do not need so much.\n\nA: You may try DIA. You can use UML to create/model Databases and use one of the officially supported Scripts to convert it to SQL.  \nFor instance you can find a basic How-To using DIA and TeDia2SQL at http://left.subtree.org/2007/12/05/database-design-with-dia/\n\nA: Another good option is mysql-workbench. It can easily be installed using apt-get (the third command will do, yet I prefer to update and search first):\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-cache search mysql-workbench\nsudo apt-get install mysql-workbench\n\nThen you can just type mysql in the HUB and voila.\n\nIt works like a charm. There is also a download from their website, yet that gave me in 12.10 a dependency error (the download is for 12.04 so that might explain it).\nOthers have also referred to: druid and DBDesigner. There is also another post on DB design on superuser.com. \n\nA: You can try ArguoUML with its SQL plugin.\n\nA: I use ERBuilder data modeler under wine for modeling my PostgreSQL database and generating SQL script or directly the database. It works fine with wine and I think its support also SQLite.\n", "Q: Is there (or will be) a U1 referrals program?

How can this be solved? I really love Ubuntu and it would be a massive disappointment if this can be solved. Thanks! \n\nA: I have the same laptop (b570) and had a difficult time. Hopefully you have dual boot with windows. In my case I had to blacklist acer-wmi in the document \"/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\" (at the bottom type in \"blacklist acer-wmi\" without quotes) then reboot back into windows and turn on the wireless, reboot back into Ubuntu and it worked. \nI had tried for days with just blacklisting, then messing with the hardware switch on the actual case, tried the fn key and most everything I could google with no luck. Then upon needing wireless booted into windows realized it was off there too, turned it on, back into Ubuntu 11.10 and fixed.\n\nA: I found the solution from: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1871781\n\nSolution for the Issue\nThe following commands will enables wireless till next boot\nsudo service network-manager stop\nsudo rmmod acer_wmi\nsudo modprobe acer_wmi\nsudo rfkill unblock all\nsudo service network-manager start\n\nAfter this step the status message in the Network Manager will be “Wireless is disabled”. Now Enable wireless from the Network Manager using the following commands\nsudo rmmod -f acer_wmi\n\nWireless networks will be detected and connected.\nTo make this change permanent use\nsudo su\necho \"blacklist acer_wmi\" >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\nexit\n\nNow if everything goes well you will have Wireless enabled on your Thinkpad.

If you have an advanced network configuration, this might not help (but then probably you know basics about networking or somebody else configured your machine, so you know better already).\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the network manager: right-click on the network icon next to the clock and then \"Edit connections...\". Otherwise you can run nm-connection-editor after pressing ALT+F2.\n\n*Choose the wired (wired in your case, since it's a wired connection)\n\n*Add a new connection and leave everything to the default values except tick \"Available to all users\" and \"Connect automatically\" and click \"Apply\"\n\n*Edit all other entries there and unselect \"Connect automatically\"\n\n\nThen it hopefully works (at least after the next network connect, reboot or whatever). This fixes probably any messed up network configuration. It simply sets back everything to automatically (the IP address, gateway etc. will be taken from DHCP). (There might be a lot of other or better ways, I tried to describe a very simple but also very general way)\nUpdate\nBecause this didn't help, some more info. I think the most common set up at home is a private network (LAN) connected to a router (often also a cable or ADSL modem) which is acting as NAT. Your private network often has the IP address 192.168.x.0 and the clients 192.168.x.y  where x is some arbitrary number between 0 and 254 and y a unique number for every client. The gateway as two IP addresses, one from the network 192.168.x.0 (usually 192.168.x.1 is used) and one public IP. The clients' network configuration need to contain a unique IP address of the correct network, the correct gateway address and the correct subnet mask (usually 255.255.255.0). Then it should be possible at list to ping the router otherwise you did something wrong with these settings. Usually this configuration is automatically done with DHCP, so you don't have to care about it and just plug in the cable. Otherwise maybe your DHCP configuration is messed up or the DHCP server in the router isn't working correctly. You can always configure these things also manually. If you can ping the router but you can't ping the internet, try to ping some public IP addresses, for example 8.8.8.8. If this works but you can't ping google.com something with our DNS settings is wrong.\n", "Q: Shorewall is breaking packets/sessions when connecting out to internet I am happy to forward any further data if required like firewall rules etc.\nWould appreciate if someone can skim through my config and see if there are any glaring errors.\nProblem:\nEverything working perfectly well then suddenly the system stopped working...

I have installed open source drivers, so I assume my card works, however when checking system properties it says that graphics card is undefined. So does it work or not? How to check it?\n\nA: Does your system has enough hardware resources? You can use light weight desktop manager like LXDE instead of Gnome / Unity. If you still prefer using Gnome / Unity then, you can use it without any effects (you can choose these options from the login screen). That is, Unity 2D:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I install and switch to the Unity 2D desktop?\n\n*How do I install LXDE / Lubuntu?\n\n*How to revert to GNOME Classic Desktop?\n\nA: You can try a basic or light weight window manager such as Lubuntu (openbox + LXDE), Xubuntu, or fluxbox. If you are running Unity, you can run it in 2d.\nI have a quick guide on Fluxbox here :\nhttp://blog.bodhizazen.com/linux/a-5-minute-guide-to-fluxbox/\nYou can find other, longer guides as well if you stay with fluxbox.\nIn general, of the ubuntu flavors, and performance of window managers :\nLubuntu > xubuntu > ubuntu > kubuntu\nBut, if you do a minimal instal, and install kde, and not kubuntu-desktop, kde is fast.\nUbuntu wiki Minimal Low Memory Systems\nIn my experience, with anything resembling modern hardware, changing window managers and turning off effects has little to modest effect on graphics performance.\nPerformance is most affected by the driver, the nvidia closed source driver performs better then the open source driver for example. As another example, the GMA500 runs gnome (2d), with all the effects I use (transparency, etc) faster on the psb_gfx driver then openbox with no effects using the uvesafb. \nOther drivers can affect your hardware as well, including interestingly wireless drivers.\n\nA: From your description, I think your Graphics driver is not properly installed. You can do it from system->administration->Additional Drivers. You should get the \"Catalyst control centre\" in System->Preferences after that.\nInstalling the ATI driver makes a huge difference to performance from my experience. There are a few other things as well that you can try out to make ubuntu faster like removing unwanted startups, setting CONCURRENCY to shell and moving /tmp to RAM. Here's something to start - http://www.skipser.com/p/2/p/speed-up-ubuntu.html\nIf you really can't get your ATI driver working, make sure you disable all desktop effects. Setting it to NONE will make kompiz go light on CPU.\n\nA: apart from above answers u can do the following it helped me a lot :\n    install Preload can drastically improve your overall Ubuntu Unity performance. \nPreload monitors applications that users run, and by analyzing this data, predicts what applications users might run, and fetches those binaries and their dependencies into memory for faster startup times.  The only downside is that, installing Preload sometimes results in an increase of system boot time. There was a slight increase but nothing significant as far as I am concerned.\n to install Preload it is in Ubuntu repositories by default so you can use synaptic package manager. or just type in ur terminal \n sudo apt-get install preload. and hit enter\n", "Q: How to determine / make sure whether hard-disks have spun down when using \"hdparm\" options?

I'm newbie to Ubuntu.\nI have a laptop. This is designed for Windows 7. Anyway I want to install Ubuntu here.\nI used Ubuntu Server several times, but all in the virtual machines. So installation on physical machine is first time now.\nIn Windows 7, I had to install many drivers to make it perform well. For example, Intel's chipset driver, storage driver, NIC driver, and Atheros' WLAN driver. Actually WLAN didn't even detected without the driver.\nShould I install something like that driver on Ubuntu to make it perform as its designed performance? How about WLAN? I can't figure out how can I make the LAN & WLAN NICs.\nI'm using Ubuntu Server 10.04 LTS. x64.\n\nA: What you need to install depends completely on the hardware. Most things should work out-the-box and those that don't or have other drivers available should suggest the drivers that can be installed.\nIn the case of a wireless chipset, this can mean you need a wired connection to download the driver but my experience of Atheros is largely positive (just works, no additional drivers required).\nYou can look up to see if things will work but frankly, that's a lot of time unless you're using a very popular SKU (eg macbook, certain dells, etc) and there's a single page about it. By all means Google for your laptop model with \"Ubuntu\" in the search.\nBut I would suggest testing the LiveCD. You can burn a CD and be running in a real Ubuntu environment without installing anything. You'll see first-hand how much is working and how well it works.\nTwo things about what you're installing though:\n\n\n*\n\n*10.04 is old in technology terms. Yes, it'll be supported for a while yet but driver improvements don't always find their way back to older versions. Try the LiveCD first. If everything works out the box, ignore me. If it doesn't, try the LiveCD of 11.10 and if that makes a large difference, I'd go newer.\n\n*Server? I'm not entirely sure why you're going to install a text-mode operating system on a laptop. There are valid reasons so I won't hark on about it too much but if this is your first real install, server isn't going to hold your hand as much as the desktop install process will.\n\n\nA: ubuntu should automatically detect if there are third party drivers for your system.\nIf so, then Go to System \\ Administration and then click on Hardware drivers. I will will there see if ubuntu detected drivers for your systems. You must manually activate them.\nIf I am right, it will also begin download it, if not already done. If you do not have a WLAN connection because the drivers must be install first, then you will have to connect your PCs wired first until you get at least the drivers for the WLAN adapter.\nBut I already installed lots of computer (laptop  / desktops) with ubuntu 10.04 up to 11.10 and never had the problem that it makes problems with WLAN or LAN drivers...\nIf your laptop is new, then take ubuntu 11.10 and enjoy...\nhth\n", "Q: How to search for a string inside of multiple files (in nested folder structure)? \nPossible Duplicate:\nSoftware for text search in files \n\nI have a python project with nested folder structure\nsrc/\n  folder_1\n  folder_2\n    subfolder_1\n    subfolder_2\n  folder_3\n    subfolder_1\n      subsubfolder_1\n    subfolder_2\n  etc.\n\nI am looking for a piece of code and the project is too big to go through every file manually.\nIs there a way to search for a string \"mystring\" inside all the files located in src or any subfolder of src?\n\nA: grep -R src/*\n", "Q: fork: Cannot allocate memory I am frequently getting:\nfork: Cannot allocate memory\n\nwhen running commands over ssh.

In order to rectify this, I used start-stop-daemon:\ndescription \"IRC Daemon Upstart Script\"\n\nstart on startup\nstart on runlevel [2345]\nstop on runlevel [016]\n\nrespawn\n\nnice -5\n\nexec start-stop-daemon --start --chuid ircuser --chdir /home/ircuser/inspircd/run --exec /home/ircuser/inspircd/run/bin/inspircd -- --config=/home/ircuser/inspircd/run/conf/inspircd.conf\n\nThis works exactly like I want it to, EXCEPT that:\nstop ircd\n\nsays that it stops it, but inspircd is still running afterwards.\nIs there a better way than using start-stop-daemon that will stop the script from opening 8 instances, or is there some way I can make it compatible with the start-stop-daemon?\n\nA: I can't be entirely sure but inspircd might be forking out the way when it's run so Upstart doesn't know where its PID really is. If that's the case, it can be fixed because Upstart has two stanzas for handling forking processes:\n\n\n*\n\n*expect fork catches processes that fork once (imo, most likely the case here).\n\n*expect daemon catches things that fork out twice... Which this may be doing.\n\n\nSo try this:\ndescription \"IRC Daemon Upstart Script\"\n\nstart on startup\nstart on runlevel [2345]\nstop on runlevel [016]\n\nrespawn\nexpect fork\n\nnice -5\n\nexec su bash -c \"cd /home/ircuser/inspircd/run; /home/ircuser/inspircd/run/bin/inspircd -- --config=./conf/inspircd.conf\" ircuser\n\nAnd if that doesn't work, check my su-statement to make sure it works from the command line and then change expect fork to expect daemon and give it another whirl.\n\nEdit the bash wrapper might be doing it more harm than good. This might be a better exec:\nexec sudo -u ircuser /home/ircuser/inspircd/run/bin/inspircd -- --config=/home/ircuser/inspircd/run/conf/inspircd.conf\n\n", "Q: How to download a driver when you can't boot? Can someone please tell me how to download a driver to fix ubuntu 11.10 graphic driver problem (Radeon HD 6470) if I cant boot Ubuntu. I cannot set to acces with graphic commands so I am hoping I can download and run the driver to fix. Thanks for any help Tony \nThanks everybody for the suggestions I think I should give some further infomation. I think loading latest driver would be worth trying however from my login can someone explain if for instance I were to download the latest driver what command is needed to fetch the driver from say a pendrive? Also I ran STARTX and had a report 'Failed to load fgirx (module does not exist,0) is that relevant. Sound like its worth a try to install latest linux driver from ATI but can someone give me the commands to use to get to pendrive and run from my antony@antony-305V4A-305V4A:etc \nOr how to move the driver on pendrive to home folder?etc.  \nNote: If I try to run sudo apt-get install fglrx -installer......it tells me unable to locate fglrx -installer\nif I write\n sudo mount -t vfat /dev/sdb /mnt (where sdb is the flash) I get FAT-fs (sdb): bogus number on reserved sectors mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sdb, missing codepage or helper program, or other error. Have formatted the flash to Fat and again copied driver on. Need to update ati driver as cannot boot 11.10 Any ideas thanks\n\nA: The first step should here should be restoring the default drivers so you can boot to the desktop. I would recommend you log into the root recovery console and then clean up using the method described here.\nOnce you're back on the standard drivers, you should be able to do whatever you like.\n\nA: I have just recently (last night) been dealing with a very similar problem. The only real way to install the driver would be through recovery console (Select at boot up). It will then give you a command line with root privileges.\nI would recommend downloading them on another computer and putting it on a flash drive. Bring it to the computer that won't boot, load recovery console, mount the USB Drive, and depending on your package use DPKG or ./****.run\n\nA: If the desktop, live CD will not run, you can try installing from the alternate CD. Once your installation is finished, you will need to boot to recovery mode, which will give you a command line interface. From there you will need to download and install the driver.\nYour problem is going to be that that card is not listed on the ATI compatibility list\nhttp://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Hardware\nIn my experience, if the ATI card is not supported by the open source driver, and is not listed on that compatibility list, it is not possible to get running.\nYou can try to upgrade your graphics card , you can try an older version of Ubuntu, or you can try to install the driver.\nThere are detailed, step-by-step guides here\nhttp://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Oneiric_Installation_Guide\nhttp://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu#Installation\n\nA: By the laptop model you specify, I almost guarantee you are using a SAMSUNG laptop with an AMD APU, Oneiric has a bug that is only fixed with the last kernel update (which I think it was 3.0.0-16-generic).\nIn order to get it working under the A4, A6, or A8 APU, out of the box, download a minimal iso from Ubuntu, make a install, and it should be working.\nYou can get the minimal iso from here:\n Ubuntu Minimal CD\nWhy minimal CD?\n\nThe Minimal CD will download packages from online archives at installation time instead of providing them on the install CD itself. Only current packages are downloaded, so there is no need to upgrade packages immediately after installation. The Minimal CD uses a text-based installer like the Alternate CD, making the CD image as compact as possible.\n\nWhich in other words, means you will be getting the lastest kernel at install.\nIt is a known bug in Oneiric not supporting the APUs properly, which you can review here:\n#825777 Display will not turn on in Oneiric with Llano APUs\nHDMI should be working, so try using if you still get your screen turned-off. For what I know, VGA should not work without fglrx, only HDMI.\nOr either, I think bug is already fixed on Precise Alpha 2. (If you have an A4 APU ONLY).\nIt is also a known bug that you might get \"Wireless Device not Managed\", in most cases, with the Atheros Wireless some SAMSUNG laptops ship with, which you can review here:\n#929969 Atheros Wireless \"device not managed\"\nA workaround for this instance is setting your wifi connection from the text-installer, (which is default on the minimal CD for 11.10, or the alternate-text-installer for 12.04 in case you have an A4.)\nEither that or connecting to a wifi from the terminal.\nIf you get any issues, don't forget to ask.\nGood luck! ;)\n", "Q: GRUB installation fatal error in Ubuntu 11.10 installation I have Windows XP and Windows 7 on my HD and have just installed the Ubuntu 11.10 Desktop on the HD too.

The bottom line is that you may have to install GRUB in the MBR of /dev/sda and let GRUB manage the booting of Linux and Windows.  The article you referenced mentions this at the bottom.\nTo do this:\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda\n\nI don't think you'll have to update grub, but it can't hurt, since it will simply rebuild grub.cfg and ensure that the Windows OSes are in the GRUB menu.\nsudo update-grub\n\n", "Q: How to lock my screen?

Ubuntu kernel PPA only provides linux-headers*.deb and linux-image*.deb packages. How can I build the corresponding linux-source*.deb package ?\nContext:\nI'm currently running Ubuntu 11.10 with the mainline kernel (3.2 rc6 now) to get a better support for my sandybridge IGP (Dell E6420 laptop with intel i5-2520M CPU).\nAppears, i'd like to install this touchpad driver, ALPS touchpads being badly supported (see previous link bug report), while waiting for upstream support in kernel version 3.3.\nProblem is, DKMS keeps complaining about not finding the full kernel source:\nModule build for the currently running kernel was skipped since the\nkernel source for this kernel does not seem to be installed.\n\nAppears I may not need the full source but I'd still like to try having it installed to see if it solve my problem.\nWhat I tried :\n\n\n*\n\n*Uncompressing the kernel.org source archive in /usr/src/. DKMS still complaining.\n\n*Manually updating the kernel source package with uupdate and the mainline source package like explained here. Did not succeed.\n\n*Manually building the linux-source package following @roadmr and @elmicha instructions. I eventually succeeded to build it but DKMS still complained about the missing source.\n\n*At last I noticed an error I did not catch in the first place while reinstalling the kernel headers. Appears the .deb I got may have been corrupted, downloading it again did the trick :) Alas, while DKMS agreed to compile the module i ran into the following error which appears to have already been reported. This issue isn't yet solved but I won't try to because of the following: in the end I decided to test the precise kernel version 3.2-rc6 through the xorg-edgers ppa which appears to be correctly patched: it works.\n\n\nNevertheless, it might still be of some interest to know how to build the mainline linux-source package as the Ubuntu Kernel Team doesn't provide it. Not to mention that I learned a lot in the process ^^\n\nA: Looks like you're brave enough :) you could try following these instructions to create your own .deb packages from the mainline kernel.\nTry reading this general document first:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel/Compile\nHere are specific instructions on how to compile a kernel for 11.10 (although you'd be doing so from the 3.2 source tree, so some things may ebd up being different).\nhttp://blog.avirtualhome.com/2011/10/28/how-to-compile-a-new-ubuntu-11-10-oneiric-kernel/\nNow, the problem with these instructions is they assume a source tree with a debian/ directory, which is where the control files that let you build a package reside. It's not a big problem though; it's easy to get a packageable source tree:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get the mainline kernel tree\ngit clone https://github.com/torvalds/linux.git\n\n\n*Look at the latest mainline kernel (as of today http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v3.2-rc6-precise/). There are three patch files (0001-base-packaging.patch, 0002-debian-changelog.patch, 0003-default-configs.patch). Download these three files.\n\n*Change to your fresh new linux source directory and apply all 3 patches in order: \npatch -p1 <0001-base-packaging.patch\n\npatch -p1 <0002-debian-changelog.patch\n\npatch -p1 <0003-default-configs.patch\n\nYou'll now have a nice debian/ directory with packaging information. Then you can apply the instructions in the two URLs I mention above to configure and build packages from your kernel. Hopefully this will also create a kernel-source package.\n\nA: It should be possible to build the upstream kernel sources. If you already unpacked it to /usr/src/linux-X.Y:\ncd /usr/src/linux-X.Y\n# copy the configuration of the running kernel:\ncp /boot/config-$(uname -r) .config\nmake oldconfig\nfakeroot make-kpkg --initrd --append-to-version=-custom kernel-image kernel-headers\ncd ..\nls -lrt *-custom*deb\n# only install the latest *-custom*deb here:\nsudo dpkg -i *-custom*deb\n\nI use that all the time and although I have a few DKMS packages installed they don't complain.\n\nA: You can download the source code from kernel.org \nThe mainline kernel in the ppa is unpatched\n\nBy definition the mainline kernel builds are made from virgin unaltered mainline kernel sources and therefore do not, and should not, include any Ubuntu patches or drivers. \n\nUbuntu wiki MainlineBuilds\n\nA: To compile the mainline kernel for Ubuntu you can follow the instructions as posted on my blog below:\nCompile the mainline Linux kernel for Ubuntu: A detailed, step by step article on how to compile and install your own version of the mainline kernel (v3.3) for Ubuntu (Precise).\nLinux Kernel 3.6 on Ubuntu: A detailed, step by step article on how to compile and install your own version of the mainline 3.6 kernel for Ubuntu. It depends on steps performed by the article above.\n\nA: When you say mainline I understand that you want the unmodified/official kernel. \nSo, to begin with, you'll not find it on a deb repository because it would be modified (by debian or ubuntu).\nHere is a link on how to do it : http://blog.avirtualhome.com/compile-mainline-kernel-ubuntu/\nHere is a link that shows how to compile the 3.6 kernel : http://blog.avirtualhome.com/linux-kernel-3-6-on-ubuntu/\n\nA: I solved this by running:\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-3.5.0-17-generic\n\nOf course, you'd have to replace the kernel version with the version that the virtualbox installer is looking for.\n", "Q: How do I wipe swap on a fully encrypted disk?

Now I want to use sswap. But to do so, I need to disable my swap.\nHow to I go about doing this, and are there any other tips on how to achieve the wiping of the machine's swap of a full encrypted harddisk.\n\nA: If you don't mind not being able to hibernate then you can just set up encrypted swap and never have to worry about the contents of your swap partition again. Your swap will be encrypted with a key that is randomly generated key on every boot. The key is only held in RAM. Once the power goes, your swap partition will effectively have random garbage that nobody (including you) will be able to decrypt.\nThe easiest way to enable it is to do:\nsudo ecryptfs-setup-swap\n\nSee the man page for a little more detail. It is part of the ecryptfs-utils package.\n\nA: Don't you trust the encryption, or why do you want to wipe it? \nsudo swapoff \nsudo swapon \n\ncan be used to stop and restart swapping.\nYou could alternatively boot from a live-CD and use dd to wipe the drive:\nsudo dd if=/dev/null of=/dev/YOURSWAPPARTITION\n\nbut be careful!

Codeblocks is one, eclipse, netbeans, anjuta.\nOpen your Package Manager and search for those things... mono, build-essential, ide's to try... Good starting hints?\n\nA: \"Linux\" is much more varied than Windows is. We have many different types of desktop systems, phone systems, etc. Developing for Ubuntu is completely different from developing for Android, for instance. I'll assume Ubuntu is the target. :)\nIn Ubuntu, the main desktop is called Gnome and provides lots of nice development tools. It is based on the GTK+ toolkit for user interfaces, and it's quite easy to learn. You can learn more about the platform here: http://developer.gnome.org. \nGTK itself is based on C, but it's available for all different kinds of languages. One language I would recommend you have a look at, is Vala. This is a language that very much resembles C# and Java, but instead of compiling to bytecode and depending on a VM and JIT, it compiles to C and then to native code. It uses Gnomes GLib and GObject extensively, and these are quite comfortable tools. There is a quick tutorial here: http://live.gnome.org/Vala/Tutorial. It assumes programming knowledge and it is a highly useful to know C# or Java, and so doesn't waste much time on general programming concepts. You'll pick it up very quickly. \nAnother language you might want to explore, is Python. This is a much higher level, duck-typed language with a very clean syntax and very easy to learn. Python is very popular in the Ubuntu community. You can learn more about Python here: http://docs.python.org/tutorial/index.html\nWhat programming language you use, is of little consequence when you're developing for Gnome and Ubuntu. The tools will be available for most languages I know of. So, first pick a language, then read up on the Gnome platform. Ubuntu also has a new developer portal which describes the things that are special to Ubuntu, such as the Unity interface. It also has recommendations for development tools such as version control systems, GUI constructors and editors. You'll find it here: http://developer.ubuntu.com. \n\nA: My meta-advice is to use Google cycles to find tutorials and HOWTOs that teach you a stack of skills.  That's the approach I take on my how-to site.\nI recommend grabbing a scratch computer, one you can erase, and doing cycles of Linux installs on it (with Ubuntu and for contrast other distributions).  Then with with that base, google \"learn unix basics\", \"bash tutorial\", and things like that.\nIf you are a Windows developer you can probably visualize the software stack, and the analogs or Windows equivalents at each level.\nI think a generic programming newbie would benefit from climbing each level of the LAMP architecture, and learning it in turn, though as an experienced programmer you may have a different destination in mind.\n", "Q: How to import Chromium Browser-Data to Chrome In Chrome under Settings -> Personal Stuff, I am given the option to 'Import Data from Another Browser..'. However Chromium is not displayed as an option... \n\nIs the only way to do this to sync with my Google account? Is there an offline way to copy over the data? Or a workaround that does not require I have a Google account to sync to?\n\nA: The answer is  almost the same for all browsers.\nIn Chromium, go to Bookmarks/Bookmarks Manager (NOT to \"Import bookmarks and settings\")- \"Organize\": \"Export bookmarks to HTML file\" and save your bookmarks as html file. Then in Google Chrome (or very similarly in any other browser) go to Bookmarks manager and in the same way import bookmarks from  the HTML file that you just saved. Save your bookmarks as html from time to time and import them when you need them in new browsers.\nShortcut to access bookmarks manager: Shift-Ctrl-O.\n\nA: Do a copy of your ~/.config/chromium directory to your ~/.config/google-chrome directory.\nYou can also do a symlink, like this:\nln -s ~/.config/chromium ~/.config/google-chrome\nThat will use the chromium config as the \"authoritative\"/\"master\" config directory, with chrome just looking into chromium.\nIt's also a wise decision to quit Chromium and/or Chrome so that you don't have any issues with config directories. \n\nA: *\n\n*Find out your source directory, typically that’s one of:\n\n*\n\n*srcdir=~/.config/chromium\n\n*srcdir=~/snap/chromium/common/chromium\n\n\n\n*If you’re planning to continue to use both profiles and want to share them, use a symlink (note you cannot use both simultaneously, only one browser can be running at a time). If no sharing is necessary make a copy or move the directory. \nMake sure, ~/.config/google-chrome doesn’t yet exist (rm -r ~/.config/google-chrome if necessary), then:\n\n*\n\n*Symlink: ln -s $srcdir ~/.config/google-chrome\n\n*or copy: cp -r $srcdir ~/.config/google-chrome\n\n\n\n*If you want Chrome to be able to also read Chromiums saved passwords, you need to make sure they use the same master key:\n\n*\n\n*Assuming --password-store=gnome-libsecret, you’d do:\nsecret-tool lookup application chromium | \\\n    secret-tool store --label=\"Chrome Safe Storage\" application chrome\n\n\nA: As opposed to the answer that suggested to copy or symlink the ~/.config/chromium folder to ~/.config/google-chrome (this actually results in starting Chromium when running the google-chrome executable - I guess, many settings inside the config folder are responsible for this), it is actually correct to copy/symlink the Default folder inside Chromium's config folder to Chrome's config folder. (Or vice versa, if you will.)\n\nA: I found on mac that rsync can do the trick it help to copy  all your data .\nrsync -a ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Google/Chrome/ ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Chromium\n\n", "Q: How to identify which Chrome/Chromium tab is using up CPU? I sometimes have a bunch of tabs opened in Google Chrome, which I believe creates a new process per tab. I would like to be able to identify the tab that is using up the CPU. \nIs there an easy way to to that?\n\nA: Pressing Shift + Esc on Windows or Linux, will bring up the Chrome Task Manager with a row for each tab - you can sort by Memory, CPU and a couple of other columns.\nAlternatively on all OSes, you can find it through: Menu button → Tools → Task Manager.\n", "Q: How do I add a document shortcut to the Unity Panel? In Gnome 2, I used to be able to drag a particular document, for example, my_to_do_list.txt to the panel. It was quick access to my daily to do list, which opened up in Gedit.\nThis is the same case for when I want to add bash scripts to the unity launcher, but they opened up either in a terminal or simply loaded.\nNow things seem a little harder with adding document short cuts to the unity panel launcher. \nI've seen howtos for this, however, when I right click on my desktop, there is no option to create launcher. Only to create a new folder, or a new empty file.\nAre there any really quick ways to make document shortcuts in the unity launcher? \nWill Ubuntu be bringing in a simpler method to make document short cuts?\n\nA: You can manually add your favourite files in the Quicklist of a Launcher-icon so that it looks like in this screenshot for LibreOffice Writer:\n\nI describe the way for Precise Pangolin using Ubuntu Tweak (Version 0.7.0) - using MyUnity is similar:\nOpen Ubuntu Tweak > QuickLists Editor > click on LibreOffice-Writer on the left side > click on the little Plus-symbol > Enter the Name of the file (it's the name that will be shown in the Quicklist) > In the Command-field enter: libreoffice --writer /Path/to/file/MyFavouriteText.odt (e.g. libreoffice --writer ~/Documents/MyFavouriteText.odt or libreoffice --writer \"~/Documents/My Favourite Text.odt\") > Press Save. Repeat this procedure to add further odt-files to the quicklist.\nNote: I had to login again to make the behaviour of starting a favourite file from the Quicklist work properly.\nConcerning LibreOffice Calc the command would be:\nlibreoffice --calc /Path/to/file/MyFavouriteSpreadsheet.ods\n\nConcerning Gedit the command would be:\ngedit /Path/to/file/MyFavouriteNote.txt\n\nThis solution also works when - for privacy reasons - someone has Zeitgeist totally disabled or just textfiles and/or spreadsheets excluded from activity-logging. Without Zeitgeist enabled, the Dash will show no Recently Used Files.\n\nA: Unity runs on both Gnome 2 and Gnome 3. The panel you are referring to, is called Gnome Panel and is the shell we've used in Ubuntu in all versions prior to 11.04. \nThe Unity Launcher is not designed for bookmarks, but for applications. To get quick access to files and folders, use the files and folders lens. The quickest way to access it is by using the super (winkey)+F keyboard shortcut. Folders that you have bookmarked in Nautilus will be displayed in that list. You'll also get the most recent/frequent documents.\nIt's very easy to add another panel, though. You can add a Gnome Panel, for instance, if you're comfortable with them. Just install the gnome-panel package, press alt+f2 and run gnome-panel. There is absolutely no conflict with Unity, except of course, if you use a top panel from Gnome Panel, it will conflict with the upper panel from Unity. So delete the upper panel, or move it somewhere else. To make Gnome Panel start automatically at login, use the startup applications dialog in the system menu in the upper right corner. \nNote: in Gnome Panel 3, you have to press the alt-key and right-click to get the menus to add/remove panels and applets. Alt+middleclick is used to move applets on the panel. Except for that, they're just the same as they've been in earlier versions. There are many other panels available as well, of course. For instance, here's my Unity desktop with a bottom xfce4-panel. \n\n", "Q: Customizing gnome layout in Ubuntu 11.10 I recently upgraded my 11.04 to 11.10 and Unity took me by surprise. I quickly switched to 'GNOME' through the login screen, but I'm faced with some difficulties customizing it. Right click doesn't do anything when I click either the task bar, or the application launcher at the top. I don't seem to have any application launcher except for the dropdown 'Applications' menu.\nI am using ubuntu in a virtualbox environment, so prefer a 2d theme. How can I do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Combine launcher and task bar into a single bar at the bottom of the screen\n\n*Double task bar size (and preferably also icons)\n\n*Provide a launcher on the task bar\n\n\n(Essentially, I'm looking for a Windows 7 style task bar if something like that exists?)\n\nA: GNOME has also changed it's interface in Ubuntu 11.10. The new interface for GNOME 3 is called \"GNOME Shell\". Unfortunately it is nowhere near as customizable as GNOME 2.\nYou can install GNOME Extensions to try and restore some of the more \"traditional\" functionality: https://extensions.gnome.org/\nThe extension \"Frippery Bottom Panel\" for example, would give you a task bar listing your applications: https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3/bottom-panel/\nOtherwise I suggest trying XFCE, which is much more similar to the old GNOME.\n\nA: That is a common misconception. In reality, there's no radical changes in the panels with Gnome 3. It's just that you now have to hold the alt-key when you right-click. That will display the same menu, allowing you to add/remove panels and applets. To move a panel applet, you press alt+super+middleclick and drag. (I think super is a bug. It should only require alt). Another change is that applets are now grouped on either the left, center or right part of the panel. Also, the system menu has been moved to the user menu on the right side of the screen because we now have gnome-control-center, which removes the need to have a special menu with all the settings. \n\n", "Q: Ubuntu Software Center search only returns magazines No matter what I search for in Ubuntu Software Centre, the only search results are magazines. I'm searching from the top level category.\nIf I browse the categories manually (Graphics->3D for example), it shows no results. I can install and search for software in Synaptic without issues.\nI've run sudo apt-get update from the terminal, it doesn't report any issues.\nIs this likely to be a bug? I'm using Ubuntu 10.10.\nScreenshot: \n\nA: Thanks for your question. \nThis sounds like the \"app-install-data\" package is not (correctly?) installed. Could you please install it via \"sudo apt-get install --reinstall app-install-data\nIf that does not help, could you please open a terminal window (e.g. gnome-terminal) and run the command \"software-center\" there and paste the output messages it generates?\n\nA: What happens if you click on \"Show 101 technical items\" at the bottom of the screenshot?\nOr, your \"Software Sources\" entries could be incomplete.  \nOpen the Edit->Software Sources menu (I'm on 11.10, YMMV), and make sure you have the categories you desire checked, select a reasonably local Ubuntu server, examine all the tabs and when you're done, click Close and exit Software Center. When next you run Software Center, it should pick up more than EasyLinux Ausgabe (which, I asume, in your example, had an article on \"gimp\") .\n", "Q: How can I compile Shotwell to be able to use the faces feature? It seems shotwell has the capability, you just have to compile it. I tried to configure with --define=ENABLE_FACES but the feature isn't showing up. I used playya git which included a recent fix for a compile faces error.\n\nA: The Faces feature was #ifdef'd out of the source until Yorba could add a little more functionality to Shotwell to make it truly useful -- see Bugzilla - Upload faces to facebook and Bugzilla - Face detection.  However, as we continued developing other features for Shotwell, the Faces code broke, so there's no way to build Shotwell with Faces support from trunk; see http://redmine.yorba.org/issues/4518\nAs you mentioned, a patch was made available at git://github.com/playya/shotwell.git.  When I build and run Shotwell using this branch, I see the Faces feature and it appears to work.  Here's how I did it:\n$ git clone git://github.com/playya/shotwell.git shotwell-faces\n$ cd shotwell-faces\n$ ./configure --define=ENABLE_FACES\n$ make\n$ ./shotwell\n\nIt appears you can also use ./configure --enable-faces, but I tried the above way first and it appeared to work.\nNote that you can run Shotwell directly from the build directory.  However, to make it available on your desktop and integrate with Nautilus and so forth, you'll need to do this:\n$ sudo make install\n\nTo see the Faces button, open a photo (double-click on it).  It's only available in the photo editor.\nWarning: This fork has not been reviewed by Yorba yet.  We can make no promises when the Faces feature will be fully integrated into Shotwell.  There are other risks using the playya fork, including losing the ability to upgrade your database later.  I recommend backing up your database before using it: http://redmine.yorba.org/projects/shotwell/wiki/ShotwellFAQ#How-can-I-back-up-my-Shotwell-library\n", "Q: Uninstalling Ubuntu when it is on the Windows partition I partitioned my hard drive in order to install Ubuntu on one half and have Windows 7 on the other.

They are (almost) all mp3 files and the correct info shows up when loaded into a media player, including Rhythmbox and Banshee. \nThus, this is not a problem with the files themselves (info also shows up correctly under properties->audio in Nautilus) but rather a problem with U1.  There seems to be other threads with this issue but no answers, except for the excuse: \"Ubuntu One does not currently support m4a files\" which is clearly not the issue.  This is of particular concern for streaming to my iPhone since all the music is disorganized, which really defeats the whole purpose of the app.  \nI should note that most song titles are correct (except may contain a song number in front of them) which from what I understand is due to the fact that generally the file name is the song name.  Any help with this is greatly appreciated.\n\nA: The part of our system that scans the track data in music files is delayed as we have lots of files to scan. This may take some time.

Recently, Astrid has dropped support for Remember The Milk, and both Tasque and GTG's support for syncing with RTM has always left something to be desired. So I'm looking for a new solution, and I'm open to leaving RTM especially if it is for something that isn't proprietary.\nWhat have you found to keep your tasks lists in-sync between Ubuntu and Android?\nIn particular, I'm looking for a desktop based program on the Ubuntu side rather than something in the browser. Astrid has treated me well, but I wouldn't mind trying something else. Currently, it can sync with Astrid.com, Google Tasks, and Producteev. Anyone know of a desktop app that supports any of those?\n\nA: deckoff hinted at this in his answer, and I've been trying it out myself for a bit now. So I should probably add it here.

The camera says it's got MTP/PTP protocol. So it doesn't work as a mass storage device it seems. I can find no setting for changing the mode in the camera.\nlsusb gives:\nBus 002 Device 007: ID 04b0:018b Nikon Corp.\nIs it possible to mount this camera somehow?\n\nA: Using Usb_modeswitch as discussed above won't work, but there are some alternative ways of accessing your photos , at least one of which should work for you:\nOn some cameras (like my friend's Nikon D70) there is an option on the camera that allows you to connect it to the computer as a mass storage device. However, on your P7100 I don't think there is that option after looking through the specs listed at the official site and studying the manual.\nHowever, there is one option that might work for you; as you know your camera is a MTP device you could try mounting it manually with gvfs-mount and the gphoto2 protocol which has support for MTP devices. All you need to do is find (as you have done already) the usb bus location of your camera (i.e. the two numbers: Bus 002, Device 007), although that will probably change every time you connect your camera, so remember to check with lsusb. Enter, for example:\ngvfs-mount gphoto2://[usb:002,007]\n\nThen the camera should be available for you to import pictures via applications like gthumb, or at the very least you will be able to browse the .gvfs folder where it is mounted (enable hidden files in your file browser to see the .gvfs folder).\nFor Ubuntu 12.10 and later: the ~/.gvfs folder is now at /run/user/username/gvfs.\nIf the mount does not succeed, you could obviously take the memory card out and place it in a card-reader, but  perhaps that is not what you want to do. \n\nA: Look at the last several lines of the output of the dmesg command 10 seconds after you connect the camera. It should show something. Also try df -h to see if it's mounted.  \nTry usb_modeswitch. Read man usb__modeswitch. If you don't have usb_modeswitch, it can be installed via sudo apt-get install usb-modeswitch{,-data}.\nNote: The program name is usb_modeswitch, but the package name is usb-modeswitch.  \nman usb_modeswitch says, in part:\n   On  Linux,  in  most  cases  the drivers are provided as a Linux kernel\n   module, such as \"usbserial\". However, the  device  shows  up  as  \"usb-\n   storage\"  by  default.  usb-modeswitch solves that issue by sending the\n   respective command which actually performs the switching of the  device\n   from \"usb-storage\" to the target mode like \"usbserial\".\n\nBut then I read http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_Transfer_Protocol (after Googling \"MTP\"), which listed several Linux apps that supported MTP/PTP. \n", "Q: How to maintain WPA connection on reboots when connecting from terminal?

This tool can look up \"reverse-dependencies\", or packages which depend on a given package.\nFor example, for the package gnome-backgrounds:\n$ apt-rdepends -r gnome-backgrounds\nReading package lists... Done\nBuilding dependency tree       \nReading state information... Done\ngnome-backgrounds\n  Reverse Depends: gnome-core (>= 1:3.0+1ubuntu1)\ngnome-core\n  Reverse Depends: gnome (= 1:3.0+1ubuntu1)\ngnome\n  Reverse Depends: gnome-desktop-environment (>= 1:3.0+1ubuntu1)\ngnome-desktop-environment\n\nThis shows that gnome-backgrounds is depended upon by a single package, gnome-core, which in turn is depended upon by gnome, which in turn is depended upon by gnome-desktop-environment which no other packages depend upon.\nNow you can find out about these packages:\n$ aptitude show gnome-core gnome gnome-desktop-environment\n\nYou will see that these are all meta-packages, and on your system at least one has been removed. You can then:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try to apt-get install the 'lowest' dependency, in this case gnome-core. However this may pull in additional packages that you don't actually want to install (read what apt-get says, don't just hit enter).\n\n*If you don't want everything the meta-packages would install, and you want to keep all the packages, just run aptitude keep-all. This will mark the outstanding packages as 'installed', and apt-get will stop reminding you about them.\n\n*If you only want some of the packages, you can apt-get install them before running apt-get autoremove. You'll have to read the package descriptions to decide which ones you want.\n\n\nI think the main point here is that apt-get is just a tool. It doesn't know what you really want, it just does what you tell it. For this reason you should never blindly trust it to do the 'right thing', because often this is not the same as what you told it to do! This is doubly important to keep in mind when running sudo commands, since it's so easy to do catastrophic damage to your system.\n", "Q: How to 'unplumb' a network interface I want to remove a un-use network interface on Ubuntu 11.10 desktop but failed.\nvirbr0    Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 16:13:97:0c:0f:4f\n          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n          RX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:19 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:0\n          RX bytes:0 (0.0 B)  TX bytes:4800 (4.8 KB)\n\nme@linux:~$ sudo ifconfig virbr0 down\nme@linux:~$ sudo ifconfig virbr0 unplumb\nunplumb: Unknown host\nifconfig: `--help' gives usage information.\n\nunplumb seem usable in Solaris but not in Ubuntu.

Ubuntu.com tells you how.\nIf you really can't do that, it is possible to boot the ISO image in a Virtual Machine within your current OS, and use that to install it to your existing drive. I'm not sure which VM systems might let you do this, but KVM definitely does. You need to have adjusted your partition table first because moving it underneath a running OS would be very bad, and you'd need to do it very carefully, but it would be possible. (Possible on Linux anyway, I don't know about Windows.) Possible, but not recommended.\nIf you're using Windows as your current OS then I would recommend using the \"WUBI\" installer (also available at Ubuntu.com) and then you don't need a CD either.\nHonestly though, get a friend to burn a disk for you ... it'll be easier.\n\nA: Another method is to copy the iso to the clean hard drive and boot it using grub2.\nMultiBootUSB uses a script that you can use in Linux, say from the Live CD, and another for use in Windows:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1518273\nThe following page shows how to do this from scratch:\nhttp://www.panticz.de/MultiBootUSB\nPendriveLinux.com shows a similar method but you need to type the code by hand and not copy/paste it:\nhttp://www.pendrivelinux.com/boot-multiple-iso-from-usb-via-grub2-using-linux/\n", "Q: Daemon wakeup via clock I am writing a daemon (my first) and it needs to wake up every second and check a special piece of hardware. I have it checking the hardware, but how do I make it sleep, then wake on a specific second?\nI'd like to attach to the clock somehow and wake up using some kind of interrupt. Polling is out of the question as I don't want to spend the computer resources when idle.\n\n\n*\n\n*Pascal\n\n*Ubuntu Server 10.10\n\n*No OOP\n\n\nA: OK, well, here's the solution I came up with. A bit of a pain, but...\nFirst, when I am ready to wait for the next second, I get the current MilliSecond. This is the finest resolution I can get from the system.\nThen, I subtract that from 1000 (1000 Ms per second) minus the current Ms equals the number of Ms I need to wait.\nThen multiply that by 1 million (to convert to NanoSeconds)\nThen use NanoSleep(blah,blah).\nThis seems to work.\nPS, I compared the CPU usage (with top) between this method and one that simply polls waiting for the next second to arrive, and the polling version uses 98% CPU, and this uses 0.3%. This is the way.\n\nA: In one place, you say you want to poll on a particular second. In another place, you say that you want to poll every second. Which is it?\nI think the easiest way would be to schedule it in the program loop[1] itself. I don't know Pascal, but surely it has some sort of sleep function.\nHere's some pseudocode to give you the idea:\nwhile(true) {\n    check_hardware()\n    sleep(1) //unit is seconds\n}\n\nIf you want to only run on some specific second, just add a check for the second:\nwhile(true) {\n    if(get_time_as_seconds() in allowable_seconds()) {\n        check_hardware()\n    }\n    sleep(1)\n}\n\n[1]: In your daemon, that is.\n\nA: Look at alarm system call and SIGALRM handlers, as well as pause. I have no idea how to do that in Pascal, but presumably it'll be similar.\nman 2 alarm\nman 3 sleep\n\nYou might well find that sleep is more than enough for your needs. Indeed, the documentation says that this may even be implemented using alarm (although I believe it in not in Linux).\nNote that all these things don't guarantee exactly when you wake. The times given are approximate. An alarm will not be delivered before the time given, but may be delivered a little late. Sleep has a similar issue, but may also return early if the process receives another signal.\n", "Q: Change Gnome terminal (Bash) profile when changing to different user in the same terminal (e.g. root) Is it possible to change the profile of a terminal upon switching user in the same terminal?\nActually my goal is to change the terminal to a profile which indicates to me that it is a terminal as 'root' and that I better be very careful. Of course I am always very careful with root, and to improve that even more, I want to change the profile of the terminal so that it clearly shows to me that I'm currently using a terminal that has root-priviliges.\nSo for clarity: I don't want to make a shortcut to open a bash terminal with a certain profile, I am thinking of some edits to .bashrc which detects a user change and can switch to a profile.\nIs this possible, and if yes, how? ;)\n\nA: You just need to edit .bashrc file for root user and add there whatever you need to have that different profile.\nFor example, it's usual to set PS1 in .bashrc to provide a different prompt (one that ends with # instead of with $) to let the user know he's in a root terminal. In fact, I think this should be the defaultt behaviour so you should have this different prompt already.\n\nA: If you are using su you can add the -, -l or --login option to the command to \"Provide an environment similar to what the user would expect had the user logged in directly.\" All according to the su man-page. These options will load the new users .bashrc or whatever file(s) apply to the shell being loaded.\nFor example su - will switch to the user root with all the same settings as if logged in directly as root from a terminal.\nFor more information see man su.\n\nA: I am lazy, I use the same .bashrc for root and my user.

I remember reading some thoughts about doing things like that (I think with regards to right-to-left readers), but it hasn't been implemented yet. \nWell.

I can move the mouse pointer  but I can not click on anything.\nDoes anyone know what might be wrong? I have searched the web for people with similar problems but so far no luck.

I have used gnome-color-chooser by choosing \"Desktop\" panel and changing to white colour on Colorize with but unfortunately, nothing was changed.\nPlease what can I do? \n\nA: I'm on Ubuntu 11.10, Unity 3D mode.\nTo change the color of desktop icon text, I used a text editor (gedit) to edit nautilus.css found here: usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-3.0/apps/nautilus.css. The file I have has 81 lines with sections called desktop mode, browser window, and sidebar.\nIn the \"desktop mode\" section (lines 1-27), I edited lines 3, 12, and 20 affecting @bg_color, @fg_color, and @selected_fg_color, respectively. The color value can be expressed in words for standard colors such as black, green, red, yellow, etc. Or, you can use hex code in which case black would be #000000, for example.\nIn case the line numbers I cited don't match @bg_color, @fg_color, and @selected_fg_color,you may have to poke around a bit!\nIt's not easy for me to describe without knowing the correct technical terms but:\n\n\n*\n\n*@bg_color affects the desktop icon text when not single- or double-clicked;  \n\n*@fg_color affects the desktop icon text (i) when the icon is double-clicked (and the corresponding file is open), and even in some other situations which you'll have to figure out; and  \n\n*@selected_fg_color affects the desktop icon text when the icon is single-clicked until something else is clicked.\nI'm not really sure, but you may have to log out and log in to see the changes. Also, as suggested above, do back up the file before editing it.\n\nA: If you're using the default Ubuntu setup, I don't think you can define the font colour of your desktop icons. \nYou can play around with a theme's colours (see related question), but the changes will be applied globally, instead of only affecting desktop icons.\nAnother option would be to use an alternative desktop manager such as PCManFM or Xfdesktop, but then again, it might be tricky to change the desktop icons' colours.\n\nA: In /usr/share/themes/themename/gtk-3.0 are .css files you can modify font colors through gedit. \nI did it simply through experimentation. Make a copy of the .css file and add \"old\" to the end of the file name. That way if things get too screwed up you can just replace your modified .css file with the original. I know you'll have to modify the gtk.css file in gedit. \nYou'll need to figure out the hexadecimal code to represent the color you want, and figure out where to put it in the .css. I used the preferences on my system monitor indicator to find the hexadecimal codes.\n", "Q: Setting up a dual-boot system from USB? (10.04.3 LTS) I'm trying to setup a dual-boot configuration on my computer, and from what I understand the Ubuntu installer has the capacity to downsize Windows' partitions to make way for it's own using an option called \"Install side-by-side.\" I'd intended to use this option, but found in conspicuously absent from the installer from the Live OS. I'm booting Ubuntu off of a USB stick, by the way. Any suggestions as to what's wrong? Also, should I maybe just research how to properly specify the partitions manually and do it that way?\nThanks for reading!\n-Redd\n\nA: Have you tried using the advanced partition editor option in the installer?\n\n", "Q: Suspending computer and maintaining internet connection Some computers in this network have allocated LAN IP addresses, although other computers (the visitors) can sometimes steal the allocated IP addresses. Recently, suspended computers are losing their ability to connect. \nWhen I suspend my computer, are all Internet connections disconnected?\n\nA: A computer that is suspended isn't on the network and isn't visible to the network. One thing that you can do is configure your DHCP server to hand out automatic IP addresses that are outside the range of your static IPs.\nFor example, suppose that you have assigned static IP addresses between 192.168.1.1 and 192.168.1.10. Configure your DHCP server (possibly part of your router) to automatically assign IPs in the range 192.168.1.100 to 192.168.1.254. This way, you'll never have to worry about collisions.\n\nA: Yes. Since the since the computer does not reply any more the connections will time out and be closed.\n", "Q: Is SWAP used when suspending a computer I know that SWAP is used when putting a computer into hibernation.\nBut is SWAP used when the computer is suspended?\n\nA: No, nothing is added to swap. Of course, if there's already stuff in swap, then it will stay there, but you don't need swap space to suspend.\n", "Q: Is there any easy way to trace a route in ubuntu? Is there any easy way to track the route that an request takes in Ubuntu?

Can I run 11.10 on a netbook N455 its a 1.6hz 1mb.\nCan I install 11.10 or something better (at least a 10.xx vesrion) rather than using the netbook version which is a bit basic. I see that netbook version is now discontinued.. W7 got corrupted when I installed so I want to be sure that new ubuntu wont make things worse.\n\nA: The netbook and desktop edition of Ubuntu have been merged into the desktop edition, that's how we ended up with Unity (which would be great if it was a bit more snappy and stable). You could try to install Ubuntu 11.10 on that computer, though I'd recommend you use the \"2D\" environment (Unity 2D). If it doesn't work out you could always try a more lightweight Ubuntu derrative like Xubuntu or Elementary OS.\nThe advantage of most Linux distributions is that you can try them out from a LiveCD first to see if you like them (though I recommend putting them onto a USB drive (MultiSystem is a good application for that), CD's are a bit slow).\n\nA: Yes, you can. It's not going to be super speedy, but there's nothing stopping you. You might want to try out Lubuntu, a lightweight, fast Ubuntu-based desktop designed especially for limited-resources machines like netbooks. Unfortunately, you sacrifice some eye-candy in the process, but for someone like me, that's okay.\n\nA: That computer should be able to run any version of Ubuntu. If you have a memory stick and a good internet connection, I'd recommend that you try all of the official ones; Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Xubuntu and Lubuntu. \n\nA: Ubuntu\nIs the most popular version and is the one with most support. \nIf you want to know how 11.10 looks you can take the tour!\nLubuntu\nIs similar to Ubuntu but has a lighter interface which is suitable if you want to spare the weight put on your computer. \nThe performance that you experience is not totally down to the system. The applications you use will have an effect. \n", "Q: HP-LaserJet-100-colorMFP-M175a ppd file I am trying to install hp printer HP-LaserJet-100-colorMFP-M175a  model and i can't seem to get it right.Where can i find the ppd file for this model?.\n\nA: Quote from the HPLIP website:\n\nThis printer REQUIRES a downloadable driver plug-in.

How can this be done for any added panel applet?\n\nA: I'll be frank, you can't.

Is there a way I can change the keyboard layout to attribute the S value to a key I don't use (ie, right Alt)? To make myself crystal clear, is there a way that I can tell Ubuntu that when I press the right Alt, it prints S?\n\nA: You have to add a line to the .xinitrc file in your home folder, or add a command to your startup scripts. This command will remap your keyboard to use a different key for \"s\".\nThe command you have to add will look something like this: xmodmap -e 'keycode <value>=<action>'. You have to replace \"value\" with the key you will press to represent \"action\" letter. For example, in your case, you want to reassign the letter E to the right Alt key (a guide for all the different key codes is here). I don't know how to assign S to the right Alt key but the Left Alt key is no problem. Make a command like this: xmodmap -e 'keycode 64=s' and add it to your startup scripts.\n\nA: Try xkeycaps (you may have to install the package, not sure).\nThis suggestion comes from an old forum post\n", "Q: UPnP with ushare to an xbox 360 arcade I am looking for sharing things like a folder with ushare.

I've recently switched to Xubuntu and just noticed a process I've not come across before---tumblerd that was eating about 100MB. I can't find much information about this, except for this on SourceForge. Should I be concerned?\n\nA: The bug is still present in Xubuntu 14.04 x64.\nThe workaround of editing /etc/xdg/tumbler/tumbler.rc and disabling video file thumbnailing works fine for me. Image file thumbnails are more important to me, and those work without problems.\n\nA: You can edit tumbler behavior by editing /etc/xdg/tumbler/tumbler.rc (destination may be different - search in /etc).\nThere you can set folders where can tumbler work (i set only /home), and disable some plugins (i keep only jpeg & pdf)\nI think this is good compromise.\n\nA: It's another program called tumbler that is part of the XFCE standard installation (package tumbler).\nFrom the package description:\n\nTumbler is a D-Bus service for applications to request thumbnails for various\n  URI schemes and MIME types.

There are workarounds like wine (or playonlinux) and virtualbox to install windows programs, but they are limited. Wine/Playonlinux has limited support of applications (means not all will work), whereas in virtualbox they will work (you basically create a windows virtual machine), but you will need some RAM memory to run fine. If you have 2GB of memory, you set 512MB or 1GB for your virtual machine and it should be fine.\nIf you desperately need these windows programs, then create a virtual machine in virtualbox, install windows there and enjoy your programs as they are meant to be used.\nOn the other hand, you can check with your professors and discuss the possibilities of free software alternatives:\n\n\n*\n\n*Instead of Visual Studio 2010 you could try Mono which is cross platform - you can install the package using the ubuntu software center.\n\n*Instead of Microsoft Office 2007/2010 you could try out Libreoffice, preinstalled in Ubuntu. You have an option to export documents as PDF, so that everyone can read them.\n\n*CorelDraw x5 - Try installing gimp and gimp-data-extras  Inkscape, Karbon or Sk1 packages from ubuntu software center\n\n*YahooMessenger 11 - Try Pidgin or empathy \n\nA: Here is the list of supported applications:\nhttp://www.playonlinux.com/repository/?cat=1\nThat doesn't mean others won't work, but these are the ones known to be working.\n\nA: For that kind of software I would really recommend running it inside a Ubuntu virtual box Windows7 guest.\nSome of those will work (or there are open-source similar solutions) but you go trough a lot of pain and suffer from performance issues.\nIts just much better, simpler and fancier to keep using Ubuntu and if needed open up a virtual box guest in case you need to work on that kind of software.\nVirtual Box is free, you can install it in Ubuntu using the Software Center or if you prefer to keep it up to date you can find instructions here.\nIt will run Windows7 perfectly and all the software listed there will run inside the guest.\nYou will be able to make easy snapshots (in case you want to go back on a mistake you have done) and you can slowly make the move from using the guest Windows7 to using primarily Ubuntu.\nYou just need to make a backup of all that is important in your Windows7 system, remove Windows7 form the computer, install VirtualBox on Ubuntu and Windows7 inside the VirtualBox and you will be able to use Windows7 and the software listed there without having to leave Ubuntu.\nThe main reason for the recommendation is really Microsoft Studio 2010 (since the others have open source alternatives). It will be a pain to to make it work properly and depending on what your development needs are you have no open-source alternative.\n\nA: I found the answer to my question.\nYou and others (who want to use some Windows application and/or Windows games (why not)) can visit \nhttp://appdb.winehq.org/ \nand type there the application name and check if it could be executed with Wine.\n\nA: (While I realise that I am late to the party) If I were in your shoes, I would refrain from using Visual Studio, C# and similar software in Linux. The open source alternative, Mono is pretty bad (full of bugs, inconsistencies, not 100% compatible with original Microsoft implementation, etc).\nWhile other users have suggested the user of a Windows Virtual Machine, I have to note that I second that. You could run a virtual machine via software like VirtualBox, VMware Player  and/or QEMU. Since you are a student, you could easily obtain a legit Windows 7 Professional license via Microsoft's project Dreamspark and be all set to go.\nJust one final reminder: In case you actually use a virtual machine, be sure to allocate a hefty amount of memory and hd drive space to the Windows virtual machine, especially if it is a Windows 7 vm, with plans to upgrade to Windows 8.\n\nA: I am developer, so I can probably help you a little... A while ago I switched to using Ubuntu and since I work for hire, I need to have Visual Studio. I simply created VmWare image and installed Windows XP into it... yes you hear right... XP. You probably ask why... It's because it's requirements are much lower that that of W7. I can now use 2 Gb (that is how much I assigned to VmWare) of RAM and it works great... better that it did on Windows 7 I had installed before (I still have it as dual boot). Please be advised, that you create big enough virtual disk (30 Gb). Even if you don't use it. file will grow with continous use and adding of new files. If you plan to link (as network drives) your existing disk, be advised, that disk on which your source files are, should be also Vmware disk, because network access can be little slow for VS builds...\nGood luck,\nAndy\nBTW: I got MS Office running directly on linux with Playlinux, for messaging Pidgin has a lot of plugins for different protocol, even Yahoo one. \n", "Q: How do I get a Broadcom 4313 wireless card working on a 2.6.38 kernel?

Alternatively, logout and login.\ncredit\n\nLinked Questions:\n\n*\n\n*Is it possible to customise the search engine buttons in GNOME Shell?\n\n*Is it possible to remove or replace Google search in GNOME Shell's dash?\n\nA: To preserve the meaning of the gsettings variable, another possibility would be to modify search.js to order search providers files by name:\n    FileUtils.listDirAsync(file, Lang.bind(this, function(files) {\n        files.sort (function (first, second) {\n            return first.get_name () <= second.get_name ()? -1: 1\n        });\n\nThen you would rename the files in /usr/share/gnome-shell/search_providers like\n01_google.xml\n02_wikipedia.xml\n... \n\nCarlo.\n\nA: I found that it arranges them in time order. The search provider which was added latest is first. So if you want to bring Google first just move it somewhere, refresh (Alt+F2 and R), recopy it to the folder and refresh again.\n\nA: Alternative method: Gnome Shell seems to favour the search provider tied to the most recently edited .xml file; to create a custom arrangement, it will be enough to open the files, save them, and restart the shell. If your desired order is, for example: Google, Wikipedia, DuckDuckGo - then DuckDuckGo should be the one you save first, followed by Wikipedia and then Google.\n", "Q: Shutdown and Reboot is causing Logout, and brings me to Login page While I am trying to Reboot or Shutdown my system using the menu, I am again routed to Login page.

When I use a lot of RAM (90-100%) then the laptop normally starts using SWAP so if I look in htop during that intense usage I see it's using 200MB of SWAP. But when I stop using the laptop (the computer is idle and running) the SWAP is still used, it's not cleared as the RAM is. \nWhy is that?\n\n\n*\n\n*System: Ubuntu 11.04 64-bit\n\n*Laptop: Asus 1201n 2GiB RAM, 2GiB SWAP, 1.6 ghz dual core cpu.\n\n\nA: The swap space will not move the swapped out pages back into the physical RAM until the processes that are using that memory access it again. So, especially if you are letting the computer idle, you will most likely never see all the swap emptied.\nThere are two ways to clear the swap:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable swap. During this process, the pages will be flushed back to\nRAM. Then you can re-enable it.\n\n*Force every idle process to actively make use of whatever was swapped out.\n\n\nNumber 2 is nearly impossible, and number one is unnecessary. So, since whatever was swapped out is not even trying to use whatever is stored in that memory, I would not worry about having some swap usage - it is completely normal and will not affect your performance since the swap is not being actively \"used\".\n\nA: Linux tries to use your RAM as efficiently as possible. There's no point in bringing things back from swap if they aren't needed (although when they are, you'll have to wait a bit). It's more efficient to use that RAM for something useful, like caching files you are using on the hard drive.\n\nA: Swap space need not be cleared until that space is again needed. At that time swap space will be relinquished to meet the new swap requirements according to predetermined criteria like when last used and assigned priority.\n", "Q: When a PPA has a package of the same name in the Ubuntu Software Center If a PPA in your sources list has a package of the same name in the Ubuntu Software Center, which one shows up in the software center. Likewise, which package is downloaded via apt-get install ?\n\nA: Whichever repo has the latest version of the package is the one shown in the Ubuntu Software center and downloaded with apt-get install. It is like this by default, but can be changed in the Software Repositories window.\n\nA: Package priority\nThe priorities of package sources is defined in the local package configuration.\nThis configuration can be inspected with apt-cache policy.\nHere is an example of what apt-cache policy shows for the package git that is available in the Ubuntu main package repository, and in a PPA, and the PPA version is currently installed:\n$ apt-cache policy git\ngit:\n  Installed: 1:2.1.0-1~ppa0~ubuntu14.04.1\n  Candidate: 1:2.1.0-1~ppa0~ubuntu14.04.1\n  Version table:\n *** 1:2.1.0-1~ppa0~ubuntu14.04.1 0\n        500 http://ppa.launchpad.net/git-core/ppa/ubuntu/ trusty/main amd64 Packages\n        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status\n     1:1.9.1-1 0\n        500 http://de.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ trusty/main amd64 Packages\n\nThe numbers in front of the URLs specify the priority. The package from a source with the highest priority is preferred, if there is only one source with this priority.  \nNewer package of equal priority\nIf there are multiple entries of the highest priority, as it is the case here, the newer version is preferred.\nChange priorities\nTo change the priorities to prefer a specific version, exceptions rules can be defined in /etc/apt/preferences.

(2)\n(1) http://www.ubuntugeek.com/reset-the-root-password-on-mysql.html\n(2) http://www.howtoforge.com/reset-forgotten-mysql-root-password\n\nA: There's also an administrative user equivalent to root: debian-sys-maint.

Using the super key does nothing, as neither does mousing to the upper left corner. I have also installed the tweak tool, but it looks like all the settings are not being applied to the UI. Am I missing something. I have never used Gnome 3 before as I recently upgraded from Ubuntu 10.4, which I believe was Gnome 2 for the shell. I have been reading the documentation on the Gnome site and it says there should be an Activity menu and other items that aren't there. \nThanks \n\nA: With ATI 7740, installing proprietary drivers for 3D acceleration should fix the problem.\n\nA: That's not Gnome Shell, but Gnome Panel, which is the old interface we've used in Ubuntu previously. If you're seeing this, it is because Gnome Shell has special needs that aren't met by your VGA or graphics drivers. \nNone of this really has anything to do with Gnome 2 or Gnome 3. It's just a matter of the window manager. For instance, with Gnome 2, Ubuntu used Compiz or Metacity depending on whether you have hardware support or not. Ubuntu now uses Gnome 3 by default, but the same is still true. Unity uses Compiz and Unity 2D uses Metacity. This is why Unity works independently of your hardware. Gnome Shell, on the other hand, currently only supports Mutter, which does require hardware support. Mutter's requirements are not the same as Compiz', so even if you're able to run Unity 3D, you might not be able to run Gnome Shell. \nUpgrading drivers might fix this issue. You should also know that Gnome is working on making Gnome Shell available without such strong requirements. It might be available already in 12.04, though I don't think it is yet. \n", "Q: How to reformat a drive with NTFS? I currently have a corrupted NTFS external drive that I want to re-format in a format that can be read by Linux and Windows - suggestions?\nI want to reformat my 1TB NTFS drive to a format that can be read by Linux and Windows but won't cause freezing issues when copying files to and from it on Ubuntu.\nI found a format that I want to format the drive in called Ext2\nbut how would I go about doing so?\n\nA: Plug your hard drive. Open Disk Utility. Choose the drive. In format Type option you will have ext2 option format it. [You may need to unmount it before formatting]\n\n\nOR\nyou can install gparted and format to desired partition. You need to install gparted I guess. Just do sudo apt-get install gparted.\nEDIT: I myself would recommend ntfs to any other partition if you have to access it on windows. Or create one partition on ntfs and other on ext4 on 50-50 storage basis.\n\nA: Ext2 is definitely not the filesystem you want to put on your drive. Firstly it is a really old version of the ext filesystem. Secondly Windows wont read from it, unless you use special third party tools. FAT filesystem is the most compatible across Operating systems but for a large drive like yours I wont recommend it. From a compatibilty and filesystem point of view, Ext4 is your best bet as it supports journal, is reasonably fast, and can be read from Windows using freely available tools like Ext Reader.\n\nA: When I used windows I used EXT3/4 with this http://www.fs-driver.org/ in windows.\nNow many people are using EXT2FSD see here http://www.webupd8.org/2011/08/access-ext4-ext3-or-ext2-partitions-in.html \nI would recommend using EXT3/4 because it's journaled it makes it easier to recover if something goes wrong.\nhope this helps.\n\nA: The traditional answer here is FAT32, but it's maximum size is 2TB, and it can't hold files larger than 4G. Plus, there's no journalling, or any other nice features. It's a pretty ancient filesystem, that's not well suited to big disks.\nI've heard of people getting good results using UDF. UDF is mostly used on DVDs, but can be used on hard drives. I think Windows XP can't write to it, but later versions of Windows can.\n", "Q: How do I get Microsoft LifeCam NX-6000 video to work?

Upgrading to 2.6.36 did the trick.\n\nA: Just recovering from the same problem. It used to work until about one week ago, so I suspected an ubuntu update was the culprit. However after reading that someone had the problem that activating his webcam disabled his wifi, and finding that after trying to activate my webcam, I lost my umts connection, I suspected something else might be going on.\nIndeed I had moved the umts usb device to one of the usb ports on the backside of my computer last week. So I moved the umts device back to the frontside again - and it works like a charm!\ncam & umts on the backside: cam not working, loose umts connection upon trying to activate cam\ncam on backside, umts on frontside: everything works as expected. (Tested using cheese and skype)\nI really have no clue what's going on here, but it seems to have something to do with different usb devices not playing along together. I'd recommend unplugging all other usb devices (might be necessary to do so prior to rebooting) and see if your webcam works. Then try to find out which one is causing the trouble.\n", "Q: \"filesystem.squashfs failed\" mounting error while installing Ubuntu 11.04 from bootable flash drive I am trying to install Ubuntu 11.04 from a bootable flash drive.

If you feel that 11.04 was fast enough, then you might want to give Precise Pangolin a try. This is the development version that is expected to become Ubuntu 12.04LTS in April. Quite a few users have reported that performance is already much better than in 11.10 and it'll surely improve during the rest of the cycle. It is also possible that your issues are due to bad drivers for your VGA. A desktop system tends to not be faster than it looks like it is. You can try Unity 2D and see if that helps.\nIf you want a really light-weight distro, you can use Lubuntu. Unlike Ubuntu, it is not based on Gnome, but it is based on GTK, so things will look and feel similar. It is extremely fast, and like all other Ubuntu systems, you can install any application from Ubuntus archives, including LibreOffice. \n", "Q: Open application in specific workspace I would like to have some applications always appear in a specific workspace.

They are not different distros, they are different desktop environments.\n\n\n*\n\n*Kubuntu is ubuntu with kde. Can be installed in ubuntu with meta-package kubuntu-desktop\n\n*Xubuntu is ubuntu with xfce. Can be installed in ubuntu with meta-package xubuntu-desktop\n\n*Lubuntu is ubuntu with lxde. Can be installed in ubuntu with meta-package lubuntu-desktop\nThey all use same repository source and software center. What can be installed in ubuntu can be easily installed in any of the three.\nBasically xubuntu and lubuntu are oriented towards older hardware and low resources as they are lightweight than gnome and do not use compositing by default. Although I have not used kubuntu, its for people prefering kde to gnome.  The best way to see the difference is trying it yourself. You may easily install all three DE and check it out yourself.\nSee here for more available DE for ubuntu What kinds of desktop environments and shells are available?\n\nA: Xubuntu uses the default Ubuntu Software Center installed by default while Synaptic Package Manager is also available by default. Kubuntu has it's own muon software center. Lubuntu has by default no software center installed, only Synaptic. But you can install USC.\nA suggestion: USB boot all three OS and try them out yourself, choose what flavour suits you best.\n\nA: Yes Xubuntu is a little faster than Ubuntu although Ubuntu will use your video card to display most of the gui, all versions of Ubuntu come with mysql and python as default but if you want a truly lightweight and fast Os then try Lubuntu (uses OpenBox as gui)...\n\nA: I don't know about Xubuntu (whenever I try using it, something about it doesn't feel right and I sitch back to Kubuntu). Here are the answers to all your questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Kubuntu includes Python 2.7 but not 3. You need to install MySQL, but it's not hard.\n\n*Xubuntu uses Synaptic and Kubuntu uses Muon. I personally prefer Muon.\n\n*Wireless  Internet should work just a well in K/Xubuntu as in Ubuntu.\n\n*Kubuntu is slower than Ubuntu, and Xubuntu is extremely fast.\n\n*All three of these distros are basically the same thing with a different desktop environment and different default software.\n\n\nOut of these three distros, my favorite is Kubuntu and my least favorite is Xubuntu. That's just my personal opinion, though. Try them all out and see which one you like the most.

Any idea?\nIt used to work with Ubuntu 10.10 but I installed 11.10 now so I suspect GNOME 3 or Unity because there is no problem with KDE.\n\nA: Try linking to 70-force-bitmaps instead. 70-yes-bitmaps doesn't seem to have anything in it.  (This is taken from your link.)  This worked for me on Ubuntu 12.04.\n\nThe process is like this (Added by a user on 14.04)\nsudo ln -s /etc/fonts/conf.avail/70-force-bitmaps.conf /etc/fonts/conf.d/\nsudo unlink /etc/fonts/conf.d/70-no-bitmaps.conf # For disabling no-bitmap setting\n\nThen do this to update settings    \nsudo dpkg-reconfigure fontconfig\n\n\nA: As of Ubuntu 18.04, there seems to be no way to make all bitmap fonts available to font-config (therefore GUI applications), even one choose to use 70-force-bitmaps.conf. Take Lucida for example:\n$ ls -l 70*\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 35 Sep 23 11:38 70-force-bitmaps.conf -> ../conf.avail/70-force-bitmaps.conf\n$ xlsfonts | grep -ci lucida\n1200\n$ fc-cache | grep -ci lucida\n0\n\nEven enabling it by name wouldn't work\n$ cat 50-enable-lucida.conf\n<!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM \"fonts.dtd\">\n<fontconfig>\n  <selectfont>\n    <acceptfont>\n      <pattern>\n        <patelt name=\"family\"><string>lucida</string></patelt>\n      </pattern>\n    </acceptfont>\n  </selectfont>\n</fontconfig>\n$ sudo dpkg-reconfigure fontconfig\n$ fc-cache | grep -ci lucida\n0\n\n70-force-bitmpas.conf still makes a select few fonts work - they are fixed, unifont, wqy-bitmap, all of them are typically used in xterm, where fixed is the main font and the other two are backup fonts to cover CJK character set.\nIt seems there is a progressive trend towards discouraging the use of bitmap fonts except in the occasion it can't be forgone - terminal emulators.\n\nA: \nThe fonts are visible with xfontsel but the app can't see/use them.\n\nIf you have enabled bitmap fonts in /etc/fonts/conf.d and updated font-cache with sudo fc-cache -fv but still not seeing the bitmap fonts in fc-list (therefore not seeing them in app's font selection), there is a possibility that the wrong font package was installed. For example, if you installed xfonts-100dpi-transcoded you will get a lot of PCF files and some of them are even big, but xfonts-100dpi is the package that provides fonts for font-config.\n", "Q: Quick-Change of Language Environment I'm learning French, and one thing I would like to do is to quickly switch the entire interface between English and French without logging in/out. Same idea as changing the keyboard layout, except changing the Interface and browser language preferences. \nTL;DR Quick change between interface languages?\n\nA: You can select a different locale for an application from the command line by setting a couple of environment variables. First, make sure you have the appropriate language packs installed. If you can change your language (even if it requires restarting) it means you probably do. Then, on a terminal, do this (all on the same line):\nLANG=fr_FR.UTF-8 LANGUAGE=fr_FR:fr firefox\n\nThis should start firefox with the french locale and everything within the app should display in french.\nI know this is clunky to use and doesn't switch the entire UI over; you have to do it in an app-by-app basis.

Such that the file will be copied to all nodes.\n\nA: Puppet is a bit of a monster to get your head around, so learning by example is no bad thing. In the below I'm assuming you're using modules - please say in a comment if you're not or if you need more details about how to put the module together.\nLet's say you start a new module called mymodule. In the puppet home directory (usually /etc/puppet) on the puppet master you should create the module manifests and files directory:\nmkdir -p modules/mymodule/manifests\nmkdir -p modules/mymodule/files\n\nThen create a file in that directory named init.pp and enter:\nclass myfile {\n    file { '/home/operator1/Desktop/Backup':\n        ensure => directory,\n        mode => '0755',\n        owner => 'operator1',\n        group => 'operator1',\n    }\n\n    file { \"/home/operator1/Desktop/Backup/datas.xls\":\n        mode => \"0644\",\n        owner => 'operator1',\n        group => 'operator1',\n        source => 'puppet:///modules/module_name/datas.xls',\n    }\n}\n\nThen put the datas.xls file into the module's files directory - in this example in modules/mymodule/files/. (Note there can also be a templates directory for templates).\nIn the manifests/site.pp file you need to import the module and include the class by doing something like:\nimport 'mymodule'\n\nnode base {\n    include myfile\n}\n\nnode server1 inherits base {}\nnode server2 inherits base {\n    # extra config here\n}\n\nMake sure that all your nodes inherit from base and that should be all you need to do. As of puppet 0.25 you can use regular expressions in the node name, eg:\nnode server[0-9] inherits base {}\n\nLet me know in comments if you require further clarification.\nSetting up a client to talk to the puppet master\nOn the client, you need to do:\nsudo apt-get install puppet\n\nThen edit /etc/default/puppet and change START=no to START=yes.\nAlso edit /etc/puppet/puppet.conf and add a line to the [main] section to tell it where to find the puppet master:\nserver=puppet.mydomain.com\n\nThen we can do a test run with sudo puppetd --test. If you get key errors you may need to go on to the puppet master server and sign the client key. To check the exact name you can do sudo puppetca --list and then sudo puppetca --sign server1.mydomain.com (or whatever the server name was from the list command).\nNow start the puppet service with sudo service puppet start and you should be away. The puppet service will run every hour, so if you update your puppet recipes then all your clients will also be updated.\nDeleting Files\nI note in the original question you wanted to know how to delete files. You would edit the manifests/init.pp to be\nfile { \"/home/operator1/Desktop/Backup/datas.xls\":\n    ensure => absent,\n}\n\nOther useful tips\nIf you are having trouble there are a few things you can do. On any machine with puppet installed you can check your syntax by running\npuppet --parseonly --ignoreimport myfile.pp\n\nor check the whole lot by taking out the --ignoreimport flag, though that can lead to some funny error messages that aren't really errors I've found. You can also run puppet live on a puppet client machine by doing:\nsudo puppetd --test\n\nwhich shows various useful output, with errors and warnings highlighted in different colours. If you want even more detail you could run:\nsudo puppetd --test --debug\n\nbut that generally generates so much output that it is hard to wade through, so only do that if you've already tried the previous steps and are stuck and need to see everything being done.\nNote this is based on puppet 0.25.x which is what I use at work currently, and is also the version in Ubuntu 10.04. The puppet code in the main section will definitely still work, but later versions of puppet have new flags that can help with debugging output.\n", "Q: I installed the OpenJDK-7 but my runtime environment wasn't upgraded to 7?

It can be \"local\" that's synched to the server. I've used LIkewise-open to get my windows logins working on my Ubuntu machines, but to get the full benefit, something like roaming profiles would be good.\nAny ideas/pointers?  \n\nA: I can think of a few ways to do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Set up autofs to mount the user's home directory from a network drive. I don't know how well this would work with a Windows server, what with the filename restrictions, the lack of soft links, and the different permissions systems, but I think you could try it at least. This is the \"correct\" way to do this, but you'd normally use a more suitable server.\n\n*Create a start-up script (in .xsessionrc, perhaps?) to rsync the contents of the home directory. You'd also need to set up some sort of system for pushing changes back to the server, either at log-out, or periodically. You'd need to be very careful with your rsync options to avoid overwriting modified files in the case of a failed sync, and using it simultaneously from multiple machines would be a bad plan.\n\n*Create the various setting directories you are interested in as soft-links into a network-mounted folder, and mount it at start-up. This would probably be somewhat unsatisfactory.\n", "Q: How to sync songs in Rhythmbox with an iPod I can sync them with Banshee but in Rhythmbox (Am starting again to use it since it will be the default in 12.04) I can see that Rhythmbox can detect the ipod and see the songs but when I try to drag one to the ipod how can I tell it to sync it so I can remove the iPod and listen to it.\n\nA: If you are using iOS 5.x, the library that Rhythmbox (and others) use to do this does not yet support the newer database version. If your iOS device has recently been updated, then you simply need to wait for libimobiledevice to be updated (watch the website under Music/Video Synchronization Status for updates).\n[edit: 3/11/13 e.m.fields - It seems that the libimobiledevices is supporting up to iOS 6.12 as of this release. ] \nfrom www.libimobiledevice.org:\n\nLatest Release: 1.0.7\n  Development/Unstable Release: 1.1.4\nTested with iPod Touch 1G/2G/3G/4G, iPhone 1G/2G/3G/3GS/4/4S/5, iPad 1/2/3rd Gen and Apple TV running up to firmware 6.1.2 on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.\n\n\nA: Maybe you can take a look on the official documentation here:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/PortableDevices/iPhone#Syncing_with_Rhythmbox\nThis is a grafical hint on how to do this:\nhttp://www.simplehelp.net/2007/07/03/how-to-manage-your-ipod-using-rhythmbox-in-ubuntu/\nIf this doesn't work, you can try as described in this guide:\nhttp://ubuntu-install.blogspot.com/2011/04/connect-ipad-and-ipod-with-ubuntu.html\n\nA: I'm using a Toshiba NB505 with Ubuntu 12.10 and an iPod Nano 8GB 4th Gen.  I restored the iPod using iTunes on a separate windows computer for a clean slate.  I set up my playlists and podcasts in Rhythmbox, connected the iPod, and synced with library.  When trying to sync again the following day after downloading fresh podcast episodes, Rhythmbox would crash again, send an error report and I was back at square one.  After looking at many forum entries and deleting config files that were hidden, trying banshee, trying gtkpod, I could not fix the problem.  However if I restored the iPod in iTunes and synced with Rhythmbox back on my Ubuntu netbook, it would sync fine, but only once.  Here's my lame attempt at a fix.  I eventually used gtkpod to remove the songs and podcasts (right-click on the iPod in gtkpod and remove all songs, click \"i'm sure\"), then once the iPod is empty, close gtkpod, open Rhythmbox and sync with library or drop podcasts or music directly on to the iPod.

In short, at time of writing, Ubuntu's version of libimobiledevice does not support the latest iOS.\n", "Q: Computer slows after copying a large amount of files I copied my entire music, video and epub library from my external harddrive (NTFS) to a folder in my home directory (ext4)\nIt was a total of about 100 Gigabytes.\nI noticed that over time, the copying rate slowed.\nWhen I did this in reverse prior to installing the new Ubuntu, the rate slowed down to 3.7 Mb per second.\nIn both situations, after the copying finished, which took a few hours, all functions of the computer were laggy. Windows lagged in loading up. Menus lagged when clicking on them.\nThe CPU graph in my indicator applet was extremely high. After reboot, it all returned to normal.\nIs there some memory leak occurring when writing or reading the hard disk?

However somehow the 2gb of music have been transferred into my iPhone, and I cannot figure out a way to delete this wasted storage. My iTunes says that 2gb of storage is being used under \"Other\" caDoes anyone know how to track the music transferred into my iphone and delete the files?\nThanks in advance.\nSteven\n\nA: There may or may not be a couple of ways of doing this.\nFirst off you could use nautilus to navigate your iphone into the /iTunes_Control/Music/ folder. There you should find folders named Fxx. When inspecting these folders you should try to find files named lipgodxxxxxx as opposed to the iTunes synched files which should be named with 4 capital letters.\nThe lipgodxxxxxx files are the ones uploaded onto the phone via banshee.\nOnce you're at this step and you've asserted that this is indeed the case you can either browse all folders and remove them manually or use the following command:\nfind ~/.gvfs/XXXXX/iTunes_Control/Music -name \"libgpod*\" -exec rm -f {} \\;\n\nWhere XXXXX is the device's name (as it shows in the nautilus sidebar)\n", "Q: System booting into 11.10 installation after installing 10.04 I can't believe what happened.

Additional info gathered from Boot logs is appreciated. (For details, scroll down.) When your system is totally broken, and refuses to boot the installation at any cost, here is an alternative.\n\nRescatux to your Rescue!!\nOk, now that we have a title, the procedure follows. Experiment with everything it has, but at your own risk, and you may even end up solving your issue. If you wish to avoid any trouble, follow the instructions, exactly.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Download Rescatux. Rescatux is a boot-rescue cd. choose any one ISO image from that page. Latest stable version (the one without alpha/beta in title) is recommended.\n\n*Burn it onto a CD, or, make a usb-stick bootable with that ISO. (Detailed instructions below)\n\n*Boot using the cd/usb-stick.  \n\nNote: You may need to press or hold down F12 or some other key (Usually shown at bottom corner of startup screen) and select Boot from CD or USB or some other relevant option to prevent automatic-booting from hard-drive.\n  Note that booting may not be straightforward on boot-restricted hardware, such as Macbooks. You are suggested to seek help from our friends at Ask Different in that case.  \n\n\n*Select Rescatux 32 bit, or Rescatux 64 bit, as applicable. If in doubt, select 32-bit. If neither options are available, and you see 'live', select it.\n\n*Select Support option, followed by Boot info script and then run.\n\n*A confirmation message gets displayed, that bootinfo script run was Ok.\n\n*Select Support, and then share_log. select bootinfoscript_log.txt, click next, and you will get a link to uploaded results. You may use that link when requesting for help.\n\n*If you are offline, you may view logs by selecting that option under support, and can save that file elsewhere. On a different usb-stick,etc, and include that information when asking a question.\n\n\nHere is a video that helps. More can be found on Rescatux homepage.\nInclude bootogs, if possible:\nTo access boot logs:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you can boot into your installation, start a terminal, and type dmesg > dmesglog.txt and cp /var/log/boot.log bootlog.txt and include contents of both files (dmesglog.txt and bootlog.txt), while asking the question. You should find them created in your home-directory, if you followed the instructions correctly.\n\n*If you have any live cd, ( Ubuntu, Rescatux, or any other livecd): Open file-browser,\nmount the disk with installation, navigate to var/log, and include contents of files dmesg and boot.log while asking a question.\n\n\nTo burn a CD:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using Ubuntu: Right-click on the downloaded iso and select Write to disk. Follow on-screen instructions.\nAlternatively, Search for Disc burner and open it. Choose the iso image, and follow on-screen instructions.\n\n*Using Windows: Right-click on the downloaded iso, and select 'Burn Disk Image'. You will be guided by CD burning wizard.\nElse, search and open Windows Disc Image Burner, and follow the on-screen instructions. Choose the proper iso file (the one you downloaded) when prompted.\n\n*Using Mac/Other Linux Distros: Most probably, you will have a right-click menu option. Else, use your default disc-burning utility. (Update with specific instructions welcome.)\nTo make bootable usb-stick:\n\n\n*\n\n*Suggested tool: Unetbootin.

(eg. front end for cdparanoia and lame) Back in the day, there was grip.  It had a complicated, somewhat ugly UI, but everything was configurable and, generally, it worked.  Then it was abandoned.\nNow, there are all sorts of tools, but finding one that has reasonable configurability (please let me provide the command line for lame ... that's all I ask!) has been a multi-year frustration. I guess I understand the desire to keep things simple, but surely somebody else out there wants to use \"--preset extreme\". Grip also had a neat system for handling special characters in track names (ripped any Sigur Rós or múm albums?) that I've not seen in other tools.\nHere are the ones I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*abcde — painful \"ui\", irritating and tricky to deal with when CDDB has no data, but it is configurable and overall it's the best of the lot (amazingly)\n\n*asunder — cannot configure lame options, doesn't act unix-y w.r.t. configuration options (eg paths with leading slashes aren't considered absolute)\n\n*ripperx — more configurable, in that it allows \"extra\" options to lame, confusing UI, documentation way out of date\n\n*sound-juicer — Ubuntu docs warn people away due to some gstreamer problems\n\n*rubyripper — tried this and hated it for reasons I can't recall now, and it's not in the repositories anyway\n\n*banshee — inadequate configuation options, wretched iTunes-like UI (I'm probably a minority in that view), sluggish and bloated\n\n\nI haven't tried the KDE tools.\nIs my basic problem that I'm living in the past here?

There is nothing as good as \"Grip\" as a very configurable front-end (for cdparanoia, ...).\n \"Grip\" = \"abcde\" (if only \"abcde\" had atleast a configurable GUI ???).\nLuckily I use Arch Linux, as well as Ubuntu, and as can be seen here, Arch Linux still takes care of \"Grip\".

How can I rectify this problem?\nSystem Specs: i5-2500K 3.3 GHZ 90GB SSD, GTX 580, 8GB RAM\n\nA: Since the problems happens to multiple file managers, it might be likely that it's a filesystem problem. Try adding disabling access time (add noatime to fstab), and if you're using ext4, try disabling write barriers (add barrier=0 to fstab).\nThe noatime flag tells the filesystem not to record the last access time. Recording access time means that even opening a file will cause an unnecessary write operation; most program never use access time and so it usually can be safely turned off nowadays.\nSecondly, write barrier in ext4 prevents data loss under very specific circumstances, although it comes with a performance penalty to certain write-intensive applications. Write barrier is new in ext4, so if data reliability like in ext3 is good enough for you, then you can turn off write-barrier.\n", "Q: How do I get my wireless to automatically start after reboot I am running Ubuntu 11.10, and finally have figured out how to get my Broadcom BCM4306 wireless working.

Does anyone know how to make this process happen automatically?\nThanks for your help!\n\nA: I do not know about that wireless device in special, but I do know something about modules\nConcerning the modules, the commands you posted seem a bit confusing, as they first remove the module \"b43\" and then load it again:\nsudo modprobe -r b43 ssb\n#this removes (-r) the modules \"b43\" and \"ssb\" if they are already loaded (see *man modprobe*)\n\nsudo modprobe b43\n#this loads the module \"b43\"\n\nTo load a module at boot time, add the module-name to the end of the file /etc/modules (you can edit the file executing sudo gedit /etc/modules, for more info see man modules and man modprobe)\nTo explicitly prevent loading a module at boot time, you can blacklist it, by adding the module-name to the end of the file /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf \nSo maybe in your case, it could be enough to add \"ssb\" into /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\nTry it out and share with us :)\n\nA: Under 12.04 you just need to comment out blacklist bcm43xx in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf.\nTo do that, run this command in the Terminal:\ngksu gedit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\n\nThis will open the file in a graphical text editor. In the editor, find the blacklist bcm43xx line and put a # character at the beginning of it. Save the file and quit the text editor.\n\nA: Instead of putting sudo modprobe b43 in the /etc/modules just put b43.\nI also commented out the b43 line in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf.\nThis worked for me.\n\nA: Once you get your modules straightened out (+1 to @zipzap for mentioning /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf), make sure that the interface is marked connect automatically. \nIf You're using Network Manager, Edit Connetcions->\"Wireless Tab->Select Connection->Edit and make sure \"Connect automatically\" is checked. See this answer for an image.  \nIf you're not using Network Manager, add the name of your interface to the \"auto lo\" line, using sudoedit /etc/network/interfaces. Note: Be careful to not disrupt the \"auto lo\" line, or you will be very unhappy.\n\nA: I was facing the same issue. I wasn't able to edit the blacklist.conf file using gksu as it wasn't opening the file in any editor.\nIf I just open blacklist.conf by double clicking it used to open in read only mode.\nSo, the way I got it working is, from terminal I ran this query\nsudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\n\nand added # before blacklist bcm43.\n", "Q: Is it possible to use an old computer that just has the possibility to use an USB interface WiFi? I'm using Ubuntu 8.10 with on an old computer which is not very powerful, it has no WiFi on the mother board. \nI would try to use an USB interface WiFi and I've seen many interfaces on the market but nobody have the explication if it is possible to use the hardware with Linux. Please, can you suggest me some HW or a way to resolve the problem? I would like to connect the PC to internet. Thank you very much.\n\nA: Ubuntu 8.10 is no longer supported and you will no longer receive any updates.\nYou'll have to do the work yourself if the 8.10 kernel doesnt support your device i.e. find out what the kernel module is required for the device, compile it and add it to your 8.10 kernel.\nIf you are worried about newer supported versions of ubuntu requiring more resources - then look at installing Lubuntu or Xubuntu.  Both are lighter on resources - Lubuntu itself has a minimum requirement of 128Mb RAM.\nBy using a newer version of ubuntu, you will more likely have a kernel that supports your device out-of-the-box or that is more likely to be used by people here on AskUbuntu or on UbuntuForums.\nFor finding out what devices are compatible with Ubuntu - look at Ubuntu Certified products.  If you install 11.10 Lubuntu or Xubuntu then most modern wifi USB devices will be supported - sometimes you will need to install firmware, but Ubuntu usually takes you through this process via the Additional Hardware window\n", "Q: How does the shutdown button works without asking for password? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to shutdown/restart/suspend … without authentication or confirmation? \n\nIf shutdown asks for password (and so does every program which has the option to turn off after finishing something), how does the shutdown button work if it does not ask for it?\n\nA: A window manager can be configured to ask (like gnome-power-manager), but the system itself does not ask (e.g.: via init or shutdown). Most computers now have an electronic power switch that sends a signal to the computer. The computer receives the signal and does whatever it was configured to do with it.\nYou didn't say which version. I think... I am not entirely sure, but I think I remember this being slightly different on different versions...\nSo... what's doing it? Open a terminal...\nIs the button kernel module loaded? (lsmod | grep button)\nYes? The kernel is receiving the signal and passing it to another program.\nIs acpid running? (ps -A | grep acpi)\nYes? ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) handles the signal.\nSo let's look in /etc/acpi/... You should have a \"powerbtn.sh\" file or something similar depending on your version of Ubuntu and/or ACPI. At the end of that script you see what happens:\n/sbin/shutdown -h -P now \"Power button pressed\"\n\nAnd if we do a man shutdown from a terminal, we can see the meaning of switches...\n\n\n*\n\n*-h Halt or power off after shutdown.\n\n*-P Halt action is to turn off the power.\n\n\nIf you want to configure the button... this seems to be a good post if you are using Gnome. I am fairly certain that this is a version-specific question, but these I hope are good clues.\n\nA: The password is used from the user to temporary gain privilaged access to the system, and shutting down the computer is a privilaged operation.\nOn the other hand the press of the button is caught by the kernel, which already has the privilages for the operation.\n", "Q: Slow boot/login -- how do I figure out the cause? My boot and login are a lot slower than a fresh install.\nHow do I trace the boot and login processes to figure out what programs are taking a long time to load?\n\nA: One way is to use the bootchart package - this produces a .png image file showing what processes are being started and how long these processes run for.  It also describes disk-throughput which shows how efficient information is fetched from your disk.\nTo install -\nsudo apt-get install bootchart pybootchartgui\n\nReboot and login.\nLook in /var/log/bootchart for the image file.\nfor example - part of my bootchart looks like:\n\nTo uninstall - \nsudo apt-get remove bootchart pybootchartgui\n\n\nPossible causes of a slow boot\nFirst check if you are running any unnecessary processes - for example bluetooth, modemmanager.  Also check what processes are running after login.\nIts also worth re-caching your ureadahead cache files - these files are used to speed up your boot.  Remember, remove bootchart first, reboot, remove the *.pack files and reboot twice again before reinstalling bootchart.\n", "Q: Ndiswrapper driver loaded but not being used I have a TP-Link TL-WN851ND wireless card that doesn't work properly (slow and disconects from time to time) with the regular ath9k driver. I tried to make it work with ndiswrapper and followed the steps here:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/Ndiswrapper#Downloading_Windows_Drivers\nsudo ndiswrapper -l\nshows: \nnetathrx : driver installed\n    device (168C:002D) present (alternate driver: ath9k)\nI did sudo depmod -a, sudo modprobe ndiswrapper and sudo ndiswrapper -m\n with no errors. \nAs suggested here: \nHow to keep ndiswrapper configuration after reboot?\nI checked with lsmod | grep ndiswrapper if it was loaded and I get this:\nndiswrapper           254773  0 \nSo, as I understand, everything is loading fine. However, if I do lspci -k I get this:\n06:01.0 Network controller: Atheros Communications Inc. AR9287 Wireless Network Adapter (rev 01)\n    Subsystem: Atheros Communications Inc.

It's a hacky solution, that's great when it's the only option, but far from ideal. Normally any other driver, no matter how broken, is better.\nThat said, You need to blacklist the ath9k driver, so that it doesn't claim the card.\nCreate a file like /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-ath.conf with this contents:\nblacklist ath9k\n\nThen update yoru initramfs:\nsudo update-initramfs -u\n\nThen reboot, and it should be available for ndiswrapper to bind to it.

The error is misleading, because I can ping 192.168.1.2 from the Windows machine.\nI guess I am not the first person to run into this, but Googling for \"samba\" and \"network unreachable\" doesn't help. I hope somebody can tell me what's wrong with my config, and what's the difference between running smbclient and connecting from Windows.\n\nA: Netscan (for windows) is a very handy tool for browsing lan. There is a similar application for linux too, named ---ShareScanner (netscan for linux). You can download it from:\nhttp://sharescanner.net84.net\nThe site contains 32 and 64 bit debian and rpm packages for easy installation. It is actually a gui for smbclient\n\nA: Windows 7 uses SMB2 protocol.  If you are running Samba 3.5 or earlier, it supports SMB1 and may not be completely compatible.

I only had to turn off the computer and change the card. After booting up again (Using the propietary drivers but also tested with the open source driver and works perfect also) the only thing I had to do was change the resolution. Did not need to disable the drivers, uninstall them or nothing apart from changing the resolution.\nWhat you need to care is to not change the video cable. For example, changing from a VGA cable connection to a DVI or HDMI will change some settings like resolutions available. Also changing the output, like from a CRT Monitor to a LED Monitor might REALLY change resolution and resolution formats.\nIf you are sticking with the same monitor and same cable then do not worry, you will not get any weird problems when changing the video card. It will just work.\nNOTE - I just tested right now changing from the Nvidia 440GT to the 9550 just to make sure everything is OK. Am writing right now from the 9500 and somehow it knew the last resolution I was using for this model. So everything is 100% ok.\n", "Q: How do I remove login with Samba?

I do not know the exact differences, but it appears -full is targeted at netbooks.\nYou can see a list of packages here:\nhttp://packages.ubuntu.com/oneiric/kubuntu-full\nhttp://packages.ubuntu.com/oneiric/kubuntu-desktop\nkubuntu-desktop is referenced on kubuntu-full, and glancing at the packages I see there is overlap.\n\nA: kubuntu-full is just a meta-package that includes more software than kubuntu-desktop. Instead of only installing the essential software for a normal user, it installs most of the KDE suite. Another package you can look into is kde-full.\nAlso, DO NOT install kubuntu-full with a graphical installation. Whenever I install it outside of the terminal, it gets an error while installing one of the language packs. Install it by using sudo apt-get install kubuntu-full.\n", "Q: Change windows from minimizing to corner in GNOME 3 Can the windows be set to minimize to a dock? For example, Im using GNOME shell with unity 2D and I would prefer the windows to minimize to their respective launcher.\nExample: instead of the open window minimizing to its icon in the launcher, it goes to the corner.\n\n\nA: I recommend not minimizing your windows. The minimize and maximize buttons have been removed from windows in Gnome Shell for a reason. There's really no need to minimize windows, so if you're going to use Gnome Shell, I would recommend kicking the habit. Gnome Shell has an amazing way of handling workspaces, I recommend using it. I don't see a workspace switcher launcher on your Unity bar in your screenshot, so I'm taking Gnome Shell handles your workspaces? Either way, with workspaces you never have to minimize windows. The advantage of having Unity is that you could quickly go to that application on whichever workspace by clicking on its launcher.\n\nA: Interesting setup you have there, like Uri Herrera already mentioned. \nAs far as i know what you are asking is not possible, since the unity launcher dock to the left prevents you from having a dock at the bottom of your desktop in a gnome-shell environment, since you have this special setup of choice.\nThe best way to go about it, is to use a workspace shell-extension, in combination with an application window switcher (and maybe an index launcher application, like gnome-do or synapse) \nThere are many more variations and alternatives, in form of shell-extensions, regarding the handling of workspaces and applications/windows here. \n", "Q: Indicator-Weather hangs when trying to change Location I have always used Weather Indicator (indicator-weather) for all my weather-related needs on Ubuntu, since 10.04.  I now use 11.10 and have indicator-weather installed from the Ubuntu repositories.  I recently moved from New Orleans, Louisiana to a town called Central just outside of Baton Rouge, Louisiana.  I tried to removed my New Orleans location and add my new one using the programs Preferences dialog.

I have ext2 filesystem installed on my work machine. I talk with my friend who knows linux a lot better and he said its very old and its very weird that I use so old filesystem.\nI'm now trying to get it updated (I don't have root) to ext3.\nare there any BIG reasons for that update? so I can point them out to helpdesk.\nI'm java programmer and I work on a very big project (building the whole thing takes 50-90 minutes). it has a lot of small files that needs to be compiled and produce even more small files. so maybe an upgrade would help with the speed?\nI also have problems with .... freezing. sometimes my computer is freezing and after 5-25 minutes its works again (I can't do anything, even switch to another console). can filesystem be responsible for that?\nI'm looking for any reasons for upgrade, the more reasons I have the bigger chance that it will be upgraded.\nP.S. How big are chances that I might lose data, because of errors in upgrade? (I have never done it on linux, but on windows its ... 4%?). I do have a UPS. please keep in mind that those people seems to not be very good since I have ext2 and its a new machine (9 months old)\n\nA: I would bet money that your freezing problem is not due to your ancient ext2 filesystem, but that it is related to your hard drive because I bet you are running out of RAM and the system is swapping processes out to disk. You can check free memory with the free command. If you see swap used, then that explains your problem. If you want to monitor the swap usage you can run free -s 1 or run top. Get them to buy you more RAM!\nIt sounds like your system is certainly due for an upgrade if it is using ext2. Most Linux distributions began using ext3 by default years ago. Upgrading to a newer filesystem is advisable because it means that you will have better data integrity in the event of a system crash because of the filesystem journaling which does not exist in ext2. Note that the filesystem journaling with ext3 may actually decrease performance slightly for some operations compared to ext2, however that small performance trade-off is worth it for the improved data integrity. \nOn the other hand, ext3 also gives you dir_index which does not exist in ext2; that option (enabled by default in ext3) uses htree indexing for directories which speeds up accessing directories with lots of files.\nAlso, another area you can look to increase performance a bit in the case of lots of small files without having to upgrade anything is to modify the mount options for your filesystem to add noatime; this turns off the feature that updates the last accessed time on files that you access. There is also a nodiratime option to do the same thing for directories, but that option is turned enabled implicitly by just using noatime. For example, if your /etc/fstab file contains an entry like this for the root filesystem:\n/dev/hda2 / ext2 defaults 0 0\n\nthen modify it like this:\n/dev/hda2 / ext2 defaults,noatime 0 0\n\nWhile it is possible to convert ext2 to ext4, you're better off copying all your files to a backup drive (you need a backup copy of your files anyway!), install the latest version of Ubuntu and then copy your files back to the newly reformatted system (make sure the installer does not preserve your old filesystems; you want to wipe out all the old stuff).\nAfter all this, you may still want to know the differences between ext2, ext3 and ext4; this excerpt sums it up nicely:\n\nExt3 was mostly about adding journaling to Ext2, but Ext4 modifies\n  important data structures of the file system such as the ones destined\n  to store the file data. The result is a filesystem with an improved\n  design, better performance, reliability and features.\n\n\nA: Wikipedia covers most of this:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ext3\n\n*http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ext4\nThe big advantage of ext3 is journalling, which means you don't need to fsck every time you unmount uncleanly (e.g. power failure / kernel panic). ext4 makes fscking much faster, when you do need to.\nIt's hard to know whether ext3 or ext4 will be faster than ext2 for your use case. I know for some workloads they will be slower.\nThe freezing problem sounds like either thrashing or a dying hard drive.\nChance of data loss is minimal, assuming the person doing the upgrade doesn't do something stupid.\n\nA: Ext3 has journaling but I dont think that it is good enough reason to change your existing file system. In my experience ext2 is faster than ext3, because of lack of journaling may be. Also Ext2 gives you more disk space as the journal created by ext3 takes disk space. So I wont recommend Ext3. The freezing problem you mentioned seems like a hardware issue and changing or upgrading file system wont fix it.\nSo if you have enough space elsewhere to backup your whole disk/partition and can afford formatting your it then go for ext4 as it has improved performance and has contiguous block allocation for large files which also improves performance. \nOr if you can spend on hardware then buy your self an SSD as it will highly improve performance of compile and build.\n\nA: I don't see any reason to use Ext2 on a new machine. But the disadvantages aren't that big if you compare it with FAT32. So I wouldn't say that it's absolutely necessary to upgrade from ext2, but I would recommend it. The advantages are not so much speed, but more data integrity. So if you system is crashing often, it might be very useful for you. There are several benchmarks out there. Usually ext2, ext3 and ext4 don't show very big differences, but in most tasks ext4 is the fastest. If you compare them to other file systems there are bigger differences (but you can't say that one wins always). I googled this benchmark, it shows that ext4 is faster than ext3 when handling many small files.\nI'd recommend you definitely to upgrade to ext4 and not only to ext3, because the file system check is much more faster. When I had to wait the file system check for my 800GB ext3 partition every 30 mounts, it took like 30 minutes. With ext4 it should be like a tenth of that, so several minutes. But note that also after converting from ext3 to ext4 only for the new files after the conversion all ext4 features can be used. So if you have enough space elsewhere or on the same disc, pack everything to a tar ball or so and write them again.\nYou should definitely have backups of the whole machine (system and data) before doing an upgrade of your file system. But not because the process itself is very dangerous, but more because always something can go wrong and when you change your file system that would have fatal consequences. It's difficult to estimate the risk of data loss during the upgrade process, but I'm quite convinced that human errors are more likely than any other problem during the upgrade process. If you have a backup, there is not such a big deal. I've recently upgraded from ext3 to ext4 and it took like 20 minutes. If you want to know more details about the upgrading process, you can read this about upgrading from ext2 to ex3 or this about an upgrade ext2 directly to ext4.\nIf the computer freezes, I'd suspect some kind of heating problem first. You can try to monitor the temperature or just try to ask your self: does it ever happen soon after turning on the computer when it's still quite cold? But this is the thing your help desk should really solve. This sounds much more important than your file system.\n", "Q: On sleep, open processes are closed I am using a DELL Inspiron 1525.\nI have setup close-lid to sleep mode.

You probably won't get that much of an increase out of defragmenting.\nThe time needed for defragmenting your data will very much depend on the rate of fragmentation, amount of files and read/write speeds of your disk and other speed-factors of your hardware. 8h should be enough, but I can only guess.\nFragmentation is always an issue, but ext2/3/4 reserve some space to make sure they are able to write data in one go instead of always having to scatter it around. You can check how much space is reserved with tune2fs -l /dev/<your device>  | grep -i reserve. Reducing the reserved amount will likely increase fragmentation over time, while increasing the reserved amount will likely not help to decrease fragmentation further.\nIf you need to increase your read/write, maybe operating over a ramdrive will help for scenarios where you don't have too much data but a lot of small files. Also you may want to check SSDs out to increase your r/w.\nAlso refer to this answer for information on fragmentation.\n\nA: Defragmentation of ext2/3/4 filesystems is unnecessary (if you always have a little free space). They don't get badly fragmented, under normal use.\n\nA: I'm assuming that you aren't actually using ext2, but rather ext3 or ext4.  Both are quite good at avoiding fragmentation, especially ext4.  As a result, you almost certainly will not notice any difference after running e2defrag.  As for how long it will take; that depends entirely on how much data it has to move.  The first time you run it can take some time, but subsequent runs should be very fast.  It is quite possibly one of the fastest defrag algorithms there is, though an unsafe one; if it is interrupted in the middle, you can kiss your filesystem goodby.\n", "Q: Mouse clicks automatically / Raton hace clicks automaticos Good day friends, my problem is that my mouse clicks automatically and is getting on my nerves.

Seria interesante saber si has actualizado de una version previa o has instalado la version 11.10 desde cero.\nHi Antoni. Although this will not solve your automatic clicking problem, the truth is that the link you just pointed out is for a user that is using the 10.10 version of Ubuntu. In your case you are using the 11.10. This version does not have the option you are looking for because of updates and enhancements made to Ubuntu. It would be interesting to know if you have upgraded from a previous version of have installed 11.10 from scratch.\n\nA: Buenas. \nLa solución está aquí: \nMouse clicks after movement\nAplicaciones-> Herramientas del sistema-> Configuración del sistema-> Acceso universal-> (4ª pestaña) Apuntar y pulsar-> Pulsar al enfocar. \n\nA: Go to System Settings → Universal Access\nUnder Pointing and Clicking tab, turn off Hover Click.\n\n", "Q: What software is available for iPod synchronization? What software is available for iPod music, contacts and calender syncing with an iPod Mini 2G?\n\nA: This is a very limited answer - based on my experience.\nTry Banshee/ gtkpod for syncing music. They do a reasonable job.\nContact and calendar - dont know. But dont think there is any easy solution.\nAnd yes - it has worked for me on my iPod classic. YMMV on iPod mini 2G.\n\nA: Banshee works beautifully and allows for reverse sync as well. I think Rhythmbox also works fine, but I haven't used that since 10.04 Lucid\n\nA: iPod Mini is old enough to work with almost any player claiming iPod support. It would make sense to use Banshee if you already use that for music, I don't think there's anything any other apps can do which Banshee can't iPod-wise.\n\nA: You can use media players like Amarok, gtkpod, songbird and Banshee for iPod synchronization similar to itunes.\nAmarok \n - Supports synchronizing, retrieving, playing, or uploading music to the iPod. \nBanshee \n - Allows the transferring of songs, videos, and album art to and from the iPod.\ngtkpod  - platform independent Graphical User Interface for Apple's iPod using GTK2. It supports the first to fifth Generation including the iPod mini, iPod Photo, iPod Shuffle, iPod nano, and iPod Video etc.\nSongbird - iPod device support via community extension. It is a great music organization tool with a variety of extensions.\nFor further details you can refer the link\n", "Q: What's the difference between a compressed folder (with files) and a compressed Tar archive? I don't understand the use of TAR. My understanding is it pulls together many files into one file. But doesn't putting files in a folder do this?\nUsing ZIP, I put files I want to archive in a folder and then compress the folder.\nDo I also get an archive if I put files I want to archive in a folder and then compress with Bzip2?\n\nA: tar lives up to its name \"Tape ARchiver\". It takes a directory tree, and writes it out to a  single file (which could be a tape drive), preserving the directory structure and metadata.\nSo, yes, very similar to zip, although without built-in compression, and with a full understanding of unix metadata.\nThe unix philosophy is that each tool should do one thing, and do it well. Tar can archive a directory, and the you can compress the archive with a compression tool like gzip, bzip2, or xz.\n\nA: tar and zip perform similar functions. tar has been the default method of archiving in linux forever.\ntar, by itself, does not have compression, however you may select a number of compression methods when you make the archive.\nThe general syntax for tar is\ntar archive_name file_to_archive\ntar archive_name directory_to_archive\n\nYou may specify a method of compression\n-a = will determine method from the suffex you give the archive\n-j = bzip2\n-J = xz\n-z = gzip\n-p = preserve permissions\n-c = create an archive\n-x = extract the archive\n-C = specify a destination for extracted files\n-t = list the contents\n\nThe major advantage of tar over zip is that it preserves linux permissions.\nThat is just a brief review of the basic options, you can add or remove files from the archive an all sorts of things.\nsee man tar or any of the online tutorials for options.\n\nA: Tar does more then just grouping files together (as if in a folder).\n\n\n*\n\n*Compression, if the files are compressible.\n\n*Preserving permissions.\nYou can archive folders and files, and yes, you'll get archives in both cases.\nNeedless to say that tar can do lots of other things, just check out man tar.\n", "Q: Recovering from swap lock I've had this problem come up a few times and Google isn't my friend this time. Is there a quick way to recover from a swap lock? They can sometimes last twenty or more minutes which is a long time to wait if a hard reset isn't possible.\nThe ideal solution that I'm looking for is a utility that would halt all execution and pop up a task manager-style interface so unnecessary, memory-consuming processes can be killed. Is there something like this, or another way to recover quickly?\n\nA: The easy answer is: don't have so much swap.\nWhen you really run out of memory (as in, you've used all RAM and swap), the kernel will invoke it's out of memory killer, which (in many situations) will kill off the offending program. As long as you still have swap space, the kernel thinks everything is fine. If you can't use 4G of swap usefully, don't provide 4G of swap.\nThere are only two situations I can think of, where lots of swap is useful:\n\n\n*\n\n*hibernation. And that's not very reliable on many machines, suspend is usually more reliable, and rebooting is usually faster.\n\n*Programs with big memory leaks (so you can safely swap out the leaked memory, as it's not being very useful in RAM)\n\n\nMore hints:\n\n\n*\n\n*logging in on a VT (Alt-F1) is usually faster than trying to start gnome-terminal, when you are thrashing.\n\n*There's a magic SysRq keypress for invoking the OOM killer.\n\n", "Q: \"Kernel error, try with noapic option\" displayed when installing Ubuntu The PC configuration is: Pentium4 Intel,DDR2 256mb Ram 533MHZ(But now I am upgrading it to 1GB)\nWhenever I tried to install Ubuntu, it says \"KERNEL ERROR, Try with noapic option\" \nSo what should I do now?\nWill an increase in RAM help me?\n\nA: Lack of Memory (RAM)\n256MB is a very low specification for Ubuntu.\nUbuntu will work with this low specification - but only if you use a lower requirement ubuntu spin such as Lubuntu v11.10.\nIf you have more memory available then my recommendation would be Xubuntu (v11.04 or v11.10).\nIf you intend to stick with 10.04 Ubuntu then probably 512MB (preferably more) would be required.\nKernel error message\nAs to your kernel error - some older PCs have buggy BIOS and ACPI (power management) control.\nWhat the error message is suggesting that you boot with the kernel parameter noapic.  You will need to do this both when trying to boot with the LiveCD and after you have install ubuntu.\nI've grabbed a screenshot from another question I recently answered - just substitute the word persistent as shown with the word noapic\n\nTo display this screen,  immediately when you see the purple screen with the symbol at the bottom (seen immediately after the boot sequence starts)  press Esc... If you got to the \"try ubuntu screen\" you missed the opportunity!\nWhen you press F6 a pop-up menu will display.  Press Esc to make this menu disappear then use the keyboard arrow keys to move to the position shown in the picture.\nOnce you have installed Ubuntu - you will then need to temporarily boot with noapic - this is described in the linked question below.\nWhen you have booted into your Ubuntu desktop you can fix noapic to be a permanent Grub entry - again this is described how to do it in the linked question.\n\nLinked Question:\n\n*\n\n*How do I add a kernel boot parameter?\n\nA: Same error here it seems to be a bug in kernel 3.0 .

I recommend taking a look at https://bugzilla.mozilla.org to see if anyone else already reported this and to create a new bug report.

I am new to Linux and am not very techie. I cannot see how to connect to a wireless network. For the avoidance of doubt I cannot 'see' any available networks, nor any way to search for them. There is a strong network in range - I am using it to write this from another machine.\nI can make my way through:\nNetwork Connections > Wireless (tab) > Add\nI then get to a Dialog Box called: \"Editing Wireless Connection 1\"\nAfter that I am lost. Nada. Clueless.\nNow, I have looked for similar problems in this forum and I see some. But I don't understand the answers. Thus:\nhttps://askubuntu.com/questions/48965/dell-vostro-1510-cant-connect-to-wireless-how-can-i-fix-this\nSo, please can you explain how to fix this step by step as if to an idiot please?\n\nA: I have a Dell Latitude D630, with the same wireless card.\nWe both have:  \n\n0c:00.0 Network controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM4311 802.11b/g WLAN (rev 01)\n\nI have succeeded in connecting my wireless with NO security to an Apple Airport Express, and with WPA2/PSK to a DLink DIR-601 using the b43 module that comes with Ubuntu 11.10:  \n`$ find /lib/modules/$( uname -r ) -type f -iname 'b43.*'  \n/lib/modules/3.0.0-14-generic/kernel/drivers/net/wireless/b43/b43.ko`\n\nHere's my suggestion:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Exit Network Manager.  \n\n*Use the Alt-F2 key combination to open a window to enter a command.  \n\n*Type gksudo modprobe b43 and hit Enter. Type your password in the window that pops up, to allow the modprobe b43 command, run  as root to load the b43 module.  \n\n*Wait 10 seconds.  \n\n*Click on Network Manager, and ensure that Enable Wireless is checked, then exit.   \n\n*Wait 10 seconds.  \n\n*Clink on Network Manager, and you should see wireless networks.  \n\n*Click on the one you're authorized to connect to.  \n\n*Edit that connection. Consider checking the  Connect Automatically box. \n\n*Apple Airport Express doesn't support WPA2, but accepts configuration info as if it did. Moral: Once you're connected,  Click on Network Manager, then click on Connection Information, and see what type of Security is actually in use!  \n\n\nA: Open a terminal and post the results of ifconfig, iwconfig, iwlist scan and lspci | grep wireless here... *It's supposed to be one command: \"lspci | grep wireless\" (the '|' sign is shift+backslash) - that should list all pci devices that have the string 'wireless' in their name and/or description.) I'm assuming your wifi card is a PCI one, and not a usb dongle. You can do a 'dmesg | grep wireless' too while you're at it.\nYour wifi is reported as 0c:00.0 Network controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM4311 802.11b/g WLAN (rev 01) and it doesn't say that it'd be a firmware problem... Ubuntu should recognize it. If you have access to a wired connection, try System Settings -> Additional Drivers (in 11.10) to check if your card requires proprietary drivers. Another thing you might want to try is to search for the string 'broadcom' in the repos (in terminal do apt-cache search broadcom, or via Synaptic, that might be easier and see if any package matches your card and hasn't been installed).\nAnother idea is to check the BIOS and/or double check that it is not turned off - on the 620 there is an Fn+don't-know-which-button combination that turns wifi on and off (on the 610 sure was). Make sure it's turned on and not disabled in the BIOS.\nI did some googling, and came up with some old info - if everything else fails, you can try using ndiswrapper. Here are two links for further info:\nUbuntu forums thread\nUbuntu Wiki\nPlase note, that both of these are old, and probably - and hopefully - there is a native driver for the card. I seem to remember running Ubuntu on a 620 without issues but I might be mixing it with something else.\n11.10 solution\nFinally, here's a recent information:\nYou need the firmware-b43-installer package instead of the bcmwl-kernel-source that Ubuntu installs. Install the right one with sudo apt-get install firmware-b43-installer and remove the wrong one with sudo apt-get purge bcmwl-kernel-source (you can use 'remove' instead of 'purge', it's just my habit to purge stuff that I don't use any more). You'll need a working connection, so try to get a cable for your router.\n\nA: You have a wireless card right?\n11.10 should automatically recognize wireless connections. For instance I can go any where and I never have to enter specific information in Network Connections, I just use the wi-fi drop down (fan looking thing) in the upper right hand corner by the clock. I take it though that you've done this because you cannot see any connections. \nTry it somewhere else - same problem?\nOr try manually entering the wi-fi info in the wireless tab.

After reading about all dell latitude d630 and what comes with it, i need a driver for wireless. i found somewhere that all you need is go to Dashhome in the menu and click on additional drivers--- sure enough two additional drivers show up, the driver for Broadcom STA wireless driver and NVIDIA accelerated graphics driver. All you have to do is to actvate it and if you are like me, looking for an easy fix, that's it. after downloading and installing automatically, you have to restart the ubuntu and before you restart it the available wireless ID will show up immediately. Good luck and I hope you'll get yours working.\n\nA: Wireless Drivers need to be installed. \nThe following solutions works in Ubuntu 12.04 on Dell Latitude D630.\nIf you have an Internet connection, just run:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install firmware-b43-installer\n\nIf an internet connection is not available,  you have to manually install b43-fwcutter and Broadcom's proprietary driver, please follow steps in the \"Other distributions not mentioned above\" section of this article.\n", "Q: There is no \"Connector: Analog Line-In\" on the INPUT tab of Sound Preferences -- Why NOT?

The handy shortcut to maximize your application or window is Ctrl+Super+Up (\"Up\" is the \"Up Arrow\" key).  The same combo but with the down arrow reverses the maximization effect. \nIn Unity, hold down the Super or Windows key to see shortcuts.   \nIt's generally easiest, though, to use Ctrl+2 to see a list view, and Ctrl+1 to go back to icons.\n\nA: To change the default for all folders *, Open the file manager and when the window is active move the mouse pointer to the top left of the top panel and you will see:\n \nSelect Edit -> Preferences -> Views (tab) -> View new folders using then select your preferred view type (in your case it would be 'List').\nTo change the default view for just that folder, select View -> List from the menu, or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 2 \n*Note that in the first step the default preferences will not be used for any folders you have manually changed view type on in the past.

(And what problems might occur if any)\nNOTE - I already looked into this question: How can I get the latest unity updates? but it does not answer the question nor does it have any information about the latest.\nUPDATE - There is NO 5.x released yet.\n\nA: OMG!Ubuntu! recently published an article which contained information about installing Unity v5.0 in 11.10. \nIn order to upgrade to Unity v5.0, you need to add the Unity team's PPA:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:unity-team/staging\n\nNote that this is a testing PPA and consider yourself sufficiently warned against doing this.\nAnd then, do an update and upgrade and your Unity version will be bumped up to version 5.0.\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\n\n\nIf you need help downgrading from Unity 5.0, take a look at the following questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Error while purging  PPA from Unity 5.0 testing repository\n\n*How do I reinstall Unity?\n\nIf you are wanting to try out Unity versions that are not held in a PPA, you can only do it by compiling from the source.\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I build Unity from source?\n", "Q: Reconfiguring the music lens for Audacious As much as I love Banshee for managing my library, its a bit slow (on my laptop) to use as a media player when I just fancy listening to a song and it also lacks the plugins for enhancing the sound which Audacious has. I was wondering if the music lens could be modified to still scan Banshee's library but to open the selected music in Audacious instead?\n\nA: Select your default application as audacious.\nThe music lens by default searches banshee music database and opens files using default music player.\n\nTo change default application, search for system info in dash, go to default applications tab and select your desired application. An alternate way of doing this would be to right click the file, select properties, select 'Open with' tab, and choose default application.\n\nA: If you are an Ubuntu 12.10 user, there is a music lens scope available for Audacious.

How can I share this torrent file to others.\nUsing Ubuntu server 11.10 and there is yet no torrent manager in the server. Am looking for something terminal related (since there is no gui).\n\nA: The torrent file is actually shared by just sending them the .torrent that your client created.\nHowever, after creating the .torrent you'd need to upload it to a tracker or specify a tracker when creating the .torrent, alternatively have your client broadcast via DHT. Otherwise there is no way for your client to be part of a swarm that other clients could pick up.\nIf you're looking for a CLI torrent client, I'd suggest transmission-cli which is quite basic and should get the job done. deluged is personal favorite and handles large numbers of torrents quite nicely.\n", "Q: How to verify if an uploaded file was uploaded correctly I have uploaded an ISO file to my server via rsync. How can I verify it is correct (Not corrupted or something). This is just in case rsync had an problem.\n\nA: One way to do this would be to use md5sum to compute a message digest before sending the file, then do it again on the receiving end, and make sure the hashes match.\n$ md5sum foo.bar.iso\nd41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e  foo.bar\n\nAlternately, with an eye towards doing this in a shell script, you could redirect the output of the initial md5sum into a file, send the original file and the file with the message digest to the remote host, and run md5sum on the file with the message digest. You'll often see such files listed on FTP sites along with Linux distribution disk images.\n$ md5sum foo.bar.iso > md5sum.txt\n$ rsync foo.bar.iso remotehost:/home/user\n$ rsync md5sum.txt remotehost:/home/user\n$ ssh remotehost 'md5sum -c md5sum.txt'\nfoo.bar.iso: OK\n\n", "Q: I am unable to burn DVDs.

The line of error that's at the beginning of your charts is actually a bug. But at the end of the thread you can also see from the posts that the cause of the failures was infact a faulty medium. Also at the very end it is suggested you try doing so by disabling the md5 plugin. So you might give it a shot as well.\n\nA: it could be the back-end used which is cdrkit, you can read more about it here\nyou could replace it with a ppa\n", "Q: BURG Bootloader I have just installed 11.10 on top of an existing Win7 Install, and I would like to try BURG, however I am curious as to how BURG handles distro upgrades. Will Burg break when 12.04 comes out? and is there any danger to my windows partition?\n\nA: There is no danger to your windows partition, but BURG will be replaced by GRUB if you upgrade to Ubuntu 12.04. It also did not do too well with normal upgrades for me (I'm referring to something as simple as apply updates to the system).\nTo be honest, most of what BURG can do, GRUB can do now if configured correctly, so I would not advise going with BURG.\n", "Q: How to Restore Documents Store on Cloud Folder After Re-install?

How do I retrive my cloud folder from the that was generated during the sync of previous installation. I see the other device in my account but I cannot connect to it.\n\nA: During the re-installation I have used the same user-name and the same name of the computer.\nMy synchronized folder were in my /home.

Is there a way to migrate the hidden service from one PC to another?\nI have tried to put hiddenservice folder with host and private key in another tor, but got this error:\nDec 24 00:11:38.793 [warn] /home/bibi/.hidden_service1/ is not owned by this user (debian-tor, 115) but by bibi (1000).

Dying.\n\n\nA: All information about Tor Hidden Services are inside the directory /var/lib/tor (assuming Tor is installing as Ubuntu package). So you should do the following steps to migrate your hidden service.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal.\n\n*Stop your Tor service: sudo service tor stop\nThis step is not necessary. It is just a cautionary measure.\n\n*Inside the directory /var/lib/tor is a subdirectory hidden_service. If this is not the case, have a look into your /etc/tor/torrc. There is a variable called HiddenServiceDir. This tells you the actual location of the subdirectory. I will assume that the correct directory is /var/lib/tor/hidden_service.\n\n*Make a backup of the files\n\n*\n\n*/etc/tor/torrc\n\n*/var/lib/tor/hidden_service/private_key and /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/hostname\n\n\n*Change to the other machine and stop the Tor service there.\n\n*Create a hidden service directory on your new machine: sudo -u debian-tor mkdir /var/lib/tor/hidden_service and change permissions: sudo -u debian-tor chmod 2700 /var/lib/tor/hidden_service.\n\n*Copy the private_key and hostname to the new directory and make sure that only the user debian-tor can read and write both files.\n\n*Edit your /etc/tor/torrc. You should at least set HiddenServiceDir and HiddenServicePort. Another possibility is to use your backup. You can just copy it to /etc/tor.\n\n*Start the Tor service.\n\n\nNow you are finished migrating the hidden service and it is reachable again.\n", "Q: Recover mdadm raid5 from disk images My computer just died (won't turn on) and I had some data saved across 4 raid5 disks configured with mdadm.

My cursor always moves to the upper right-hand corner where the power cog is every time I touch my touchpad even in 1/10 second. After that,I can move it with a mouse but cannot click everywhere, just move and move. I can only use a mouse normally when the system was restarted and I didn't touch the touchpad at all, because when I touch it, I can only move the cursor again. How can I fix this?\n\nA: I have an Acer Aspire aswell, and I found that my touchpad stopped working entirely, I fixed it by installing \"Synaptics Touchpad configuration\" and rebooted, everything worked again. Maybe this works for you too?!\n", "Q: How do I register a Wine App as an \"Other Application\" in 11.10?

In 11.10 I can't seem to easily add my own apps to the \"Other Application list that would be available from nautilus. I've tried under Unity and under my default gnome shell session.\n\nA: I just solved this, and it turns out that the trick with having something show up as an \"Other Application\" lies in having %f on the executable line of the .desktop file.

I tried compat-wireless, downloaded it and then compiled.  And rmmoded the rt2800 modules, then tried to insert rt2800usb.ko, and it said something about unknown symbols, or something like that.\n\nA: First try to install bt5 R1 which has all the wireless drivers patched and check then with (double check if you have any AP in your range):\naireplay-ng -9 wlan1\n\nIf it displays 0 AP, then read from rt2870 and then on the forums.\nNote: aircrack works for 100% on WEP but with WPA/WPA2 only with a dictionary which is a waste of time IMHO.\n\nA: Goto official site, and check for your adapter. \nThere may be some patches for it. \nOtherwise you won't be able to run it\nhttp://aircrack-ng.org\nhttp://patches.aricrack-ng.org\n", "Q: Newer apt repositories on older Ubuntu releases If I have an older Ubuntu release, lets say it is Ubuntu 10.04, and I have to install a package from a newer Ubuntu apt repositories (e.g. from Ubuntu 11.10 repo's) because the newer versions of that package have a feature which I require most. What is the best way of installing the package without affecting or upgrading other packages. Here is what I want to do. But the solution explained there Updates other packages which I don't require.\n\nA: You didn't mention the specific package, so I can only give generalities.\nIf possible, the easiest thing would be to find the appropriate .deb on packages.ubuntu.com and install it. As long as the requisite dependencies are available in your version of Ubuntu, it'll work great.\nA second, more involved option would be to rebuild the source package using your version of Ubuntu. This would resolve certain classes of dependency problems. Look into pbuilder for this.\nFinally, you could try compiling the upstream version yourself, using checkinstall. This should only be a last resort, however.\nOne of these options will likely work for you. If they don't, then you might not have too many options, as it would mean that there are some critical dependencies that can't really be resolved without a system upgrade.\n\nA: Well you are sort of stuck in that is what is meant by dependencies.\nSay you have a package, foo-1.0 , and it depends on bar-1.0\nAnd you want to upgrade to foo-2.0 , and it depends on bar-2.0\nso you can not upgrade foo (reliably) without upgrading bar\nIf you want to install the newer package, either accept the dependencies (probably easiest) or upgrade Ubuntu.\nIf you think the dependencies are not accurate, best contact the maintainer of the ppa or file a bug report.\n", "Q: Why doesn't my Rosewill RNX-N180UBE wireless adapter seem to be broadcasting?

So while installing I guess that partition failed cause it was stuck on creating et4.\nI closed down Ubuntu and started up Windows and when I looked at my hard drive space it went from ~168 GB down to ~86 GB. So I am guessing it did partition but Ubuntu must have not installed correctly.\nWhen I boot my PC It goes straight to Windows, and if I go to the boot menu it also shows Ubuntu If I have my USB plugged in. Is there anyway to correct this so I can get my HDD space back? I gave about 92 GB for Ubuntu on the partition.\n\nA: Since you used Wubi to install Ubuntu, you can use Windows' Add/Remove Programs tool to uninstall Ubuntu.\nAlso, I believe that Wubi uses file instead of partitions. So, you should be able to find the partition file somewhere. I guess you could search for large files or something. I'm no Windows expert and have never personally used Wubi, so I can't be more specific.\n", "Q: After copying my itunes library to my Ubuntu partition, how can I rename mp3s to their correct name?

Out five speakers only two speakers were working. Earlier when I am using windows I needed to install the realtek audio driver in order the 5 speakers to work.\nI followed the instructions given in the installation file during installation. The last step of the instructions states that the machine shall be rebooted to finish the installation.

But can't connect to the internet with the same set-up I used in 11.04. I used a DSL connection there, with only setting the username and password, it worked fine. But now, each time I make an attempt to connect, it shows \"connection established\" pop-up but in half a second, it again disconnects. I searched the web and found a work-around which says to set IPv6 to ignored and killall dnsmasq but nothing worked. \nPerhaps this trick is not for me, as I am new, did not realize. However I just realized that more people are also having the issue. Now, what do I need to do to get access to internet? In 11.04 where i could connect, I was using gnome desktop. Now its Unity 3D.\nI don't know what a router is. My pc is connected from the back panel of the CPU casing trough a rectangular port which glows when power is on.

And another line came from outside and is connected to this box. In my wire, I checked connecting a windows pc and it worked. This black rectangular box requires AC power.\n\nA: Since this happens in a live cd I'd suggest the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check that you have installed any drivers that are recommended. Find and run \"Additional drivers\" program in unity.\nRestart to enable the drivers.\n\n*If you see that the problem persists, connect through ethernet, uninstall network-manager and install wicd-gtk (an alternative network manager):\nsudo apt-get install wicd-gtk\nsudo apt-get purge network-manager network-manager-gnome\n\nand restart the computer.\n\n*Try booting using a live cd of ubuntu 11.04 this time, see if it still allows you to connect.\n\n*If the above solutions still don't work, then maybe you have made some changes to the router configuration? If you know how to reset the configuration and re-enter it correctly, that would be advisable (You can always contact your DSL support service and ask for instructions). Also, set your wireless encryption to WPA/WPA2 (and not open nor WEP if that is the case). Finally, if you use the default router password, I suggest that you change it for security reasons.\n\n*Check out this question, maybe it's a similar problem: DSL PPPoE connection not working?\n", "Q: How to compile a helloworld GLib program?

ROOT is the owner and ‘Disks’ would not let me change owners to ‘me’ or change permissions .

(Yes I know it's old!) Anyway, it froze the other day and on reboot it wanted to check the disk, errors were found. Afraid of losing the data I immediately mirrored the drive using Norton Ghost to an image file (.gho) on a backup disk. And surely enough, the drive failed almost immediately after the backup.\nNow I've got a working image file that has all the data, nothing seems to be missing. After copying the image to a new drive I wanted to boot, but somehow GRUB didn't get to booting and said \"/dev/mapper/hostname-root\" (the bootup root) was missing. So I went into the GRUB menu and changed the boot commands so the root was set to \"/dev/sda6/\" (my root partition) directly. \nTo my delight, it booted! With just one problem... Whenever I reboot (sometimes it takes two reboots), the root partition seems to be gone! Neither GRUB nor a Ubuntu livecd will detect the partition any longer and it won't boot. If I don't boot the disk after the copying, the livecd WILL detect it and I can even mount it and access my data.\nNorton Ghost will see the root partition merged with the swap partition (which is suddenly about 500GB in size) and the livecd won't detect it at all.\nI've replicated this about 5 times with 2 different (brand new) drives by writing the .gho image to a new drive.\nFrom running Ubuntu, after boot:\nadmin@WEB-UBUNTU:~$ sudo blkid\n/dev/sda5: UUID=\"cc95c47b-fc1c-4918-9f79-706db2af98fd\" TYPE=\"ext2\"\n/dev/sda6: UUID=\"ba898223-7a86-40d3-bb11-267562af4902\" TYPE=\"ext3\"\n/dev/sda7: TYPE=\"swap\"\n\nadmin@WEB-UBUNTU:~$ mount\n/dev/sda6 on / type ext3 (rw,relatime,errors=remount-ro,usrquota,grpquota)\ntmpfs on /lib/init/rw type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,mode=0755)\nproc on /proc type proc (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev)\nsysfs on /sys type sysfs (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev)\nvarrun on /var/run type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,mode=0755)\nvarlock on /var/lock type tmpfs (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev,mode=1777)\nudev on /dev type tmpfs (rw,mode=0755)\ntmpfs on /dev/shm type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev)\ndevpts on /dev/pts type devpts (rw,noexec,nosuid,gid=5,mode=620)\nfusectl on /sys/fs/fuse/connections type fusectl (rw)\nlrm on /lib/modules/2.6.28-19-server/volatile type tmpfs (rw,mode=755)\n/dev/sda5 on /boot type ext2 (rw,relatime)\n\nadmin@WEB-UBUNTU:~$ sudo fdisk -l\n[sudo] password for admin:\nlege partitie (6) wordt weggelaten [EN: Empty partition (6) is omitted]\n\nSchijf /dev/sda: 500.1 GB, 500107862016 bytes [EN: schijf = disk]\n255 koppen, 63 sectoren/spoor, 60801 cilinders [EN: koppen = heads, sectoren = sectors, spoor = track, cilinders = cylinders]\nEenheid = cilinders van 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes [EN: Unit = Cylinders of]\nSchijf-ID: 0x0001a71a [EN: Disk-ID]\n\n Apparaat Opstart   Begin       Einde     Blokken   ID  Systeem\n/dev/sda1               2       60801   488376000    f  W95 Uitgeb.

What can I do to get it back?\nPS: 11.10 using ext4, 8.04 using ext3, so I can't do mount operations.\n\nA: If I remember correctly, Ubuntu 8.04 used grub 1, and ext4 was not supported yet, so it is most probably a grub problem.\nThe solution is to start with a 11.10 livecd and restore grub 2 using the usual procedures, see for example Recovering Ubuntu After Installing Windows (I know, you don't installed Windows, but the procedure is the same).\n", "Q: Is it useful to run Ubuntu Friendly off a LiveUSB? To secure maximum data for Ubuntu Friendly, the maximum number of computers should be tested. However, it is not possible for me (or anyone) to install Ubuntu on all the computers we have access to. Would running Ubuntu Friendly within an Ubuntu LiveUSB give accurate results? For example, some people report certain deficiencies when running Ubuntu off a LiveUSB as opposed to an installation.\n\nA: In general I think it should work. However, if something forces you to reboot, then your previous testing results will be lost.\n\nA: To answer your question fast, Yes.\nBut I wouldn't suggest it. It is very slow. Also, you have to be careful about running from a live USB flash drive, as they have a limited number of writes you can make to the disk.\nAnd also for the reason that Scott Severance mentioned in his answer.\nRunning an operating system, like Ubuntu, from your flash drive can be very useful:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can recover your data\n\n*To scan for viruses \n\n*Resize partitions\n\n*System testing\n\n\nYou can run Ubuntu the way you want, even if you don't have your own computer with you. You will have the power of Ubuntu with at all times!\nP.S. make sure you use a persistent Ubuntu Live Disk that allows installing additional utilities to run heavy benchmark tests.\n\nA: Of course there might be deficiencies when running from the live CD that will not appear when running with a proper install - every patch that Ubuntu installer downloads during install is a fix for one of those.\nSo, a system/component running with live CD, will run after full install; a component not running from the live CD MIGHT work after proper install as well.\n\nA: If you have all BIOS based machines I would suggest you really install a test installation to a portable hard drive or USB stick and boot that from the boot menu of the BIOS. With UEFI I think it gets a bit more complicated but still manageable. Installing on portable memory is technically no more different from preparing Live USB media, setting up an overlay file system for Live media is also a possible workaround, but over the top.\n", "Q: Problem with ./configure while installing from tar I am trying to install a more recent version of a program than what is available via Synaptic, but I am running into a few problems. And I have one question beyond those problems. This is what I've done so far.\nI downloaded the .tar.gz2, created a folder in /usr/local/ for the program. Call it app. So I now have a folder /usr/local/app. Inside the folder I extracted the archive. I then navigated a terminal to that folder and ran\nsudo apt-get build-dep app\n\nIt downloaded and installed several libraries and I thought I was set. However, when I ran sh ./configure I encountered the following problem:\nchecking for GLIB - version >= 2.14.0... \n'pkg-config --modversion glib-2.0' returned 2.14.0, but GLIB (2.28.6)\nwas found! If pkg-config was correct, then it is best\nto remove the old version of GLib. You may also be able to fix the error\nby modifying your LD_LIBRARY_PATH enviroment variable, or by editing\n/etc/ld.so.conf. Make sure you have run ldconfig if that is\nrequired on your system.\nIf pkg-config was wrong, set the environment variable PKG_CONFIG_PATH\nto point to the correct configuration files\n\nOk, no problem. I went out and found Glib 2.14.0. I created a new folder /usr/local/glib. I extracted the archive to that folder. I ran the sh ./configure for Glib, and it went off without a hitch. I then ran make install for Glib. Again, no problems. It installed successfully. So now I was ready to rock! Back I went into /usr/local/app, and once again I ran sh ./configure. And I got the exact same error message. I am not understanding the message as it appears to say that ./configure requires GLib version 2.14.0 or later, and it found version 2.28.6, which would more than meet the requirement. I'm not great with shell scripts so I am somewhat, well, entirely, confused as to what it is this thing wants from me.\nI am running Ubuntu 11.04 on a Toshiba Satellite. As you can see I'm not exactly a terminal warrior, but I can usually scratch my way through most problems and have learned quite a bit as I go.  This one just has me stumped.\n\nA: You have to set your LIBRARY PATH to the directory glib was installed to. Since it is user-built it will reside in another directory, I am not 100% sure, but my first guess is /urs/local/lib.\nput this into your bash:\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib\nexport LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib\nexport CPATH=/usr/local/include\n\nand try again, i think make install will tell you the directory. so if its another one check its output.\nif you want to check how your environment variables are set type\necho ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}\n\nof course you can replace the name with all other variables.\nyou have to set those environment variables every time you fire up a new shell, but you can write it to your bash_profile, too, i think (never tried that though).\n", "Q: Kernel compiling help I was compiling the kernel 3.2 when it was taken more time than the walkthrough indicated.

It asked me for installing some services. They failed. So I did manually sudo apt-get install samba. Worked fine. Now I went to my PC an opened my home folder.

It is not directly related to the formulation of my initial question but to a solution presented below by @lumbric in the comments.\n\n\nA: Re-creating the share on your notebook (as you first tried to do) after installing samba may solve your problem. Already happened to me. Tell me if this works to update my answer.\nUsing sshfs to share folders:\nIf you want to share folders between Ubuntu computers, may I suggest to use a native Linux solution ? Samba re-implements windows protocols and i always ended up having issues with the samba configuration. On the other hand I found sshfs much easier to use.\nAssuming you have sshfs installed and you're a user of the fuse group, just do the following:\nmkdir ~/shared_folder\nsshfs <user>@<ip>:<shared_folder_path> /home/$USER/shared_folder\n\nThen check it works and do your stuff:\ncd ~/shared_folder\nls\nnautilus .\netc.\n\nTo unmount:\nfusermount -u ~/shared_folder\n\nAdding an entry to /etc/fstab:\nSome people prefer to add this line at the end of the /etc/fstab file:\nsshfs#<user>@<ip>:<shared_folder_path> <mount_point> fuse defaults,user,idmap=user,noauto 0 0\n\nBy doing so, you'll be able to mount the folder with mount ~/shared_folder. Still unmount with fusermount.\nI'm not usually using this method as i configured my ↑ key to browse my bash history so that just typing sshf+↑ gives me all my previous sshfs mounts. Also, I don't need to do system-wide changes.\n\nA: CTRL+L in Nautilus (that's the name of Ubuntu's default file browser) was a good start! But you have to use the correct network protcoll which is smb when using Samba. So you have to enter:\nsmb://127.0.0.1/\n\n(of course replace the IP address)\nThis might be quite a serious usuability bug in Ubuntu. If you just click on \"network\" it never finds any computer in your network.\nAdditional tipps\nI'm not sure wether SMB is the best joice for a home network if both machines are running Ubuntu. Samba is primarily used in order share files with windows computers. But I haven't any better suggestions. sFTP and SSH is good but slow. NFS is lacking some important features as far as I remember. FTP might be a joice.\nPS: Btw note that STRG is german and english speaking users might not understand that this is the CTRL key... ;)\n", "Q: 11.10 x86 - memory RAM problem (shows 3.4 GB when 8 GB are installed) I recently installed Ubuntu 11.10 x86 on a new computer that has 2 x 4 GB RAM installed (8 GB total).\nBut when I go to the Ubuntu system monitor it only shows 3.4 GB of memory (and 8 GB swap).

While standing on a desk, it easily gets to 80°C (176°F)\nI'm using the fglrx version that came with Ubuntu 11.10, the Catalyst 11.8 driver. \nSo, my questions now are:\n\n\n*\n\n*What are the risks of an overheated GPU?\n\n*Does an overheated GPU cause my laptop to slow down?\n\n*Can I fix this? \n\n\nExtra info: \nI tried installing Catalyst 11.12 manually, but it kept on saying it found an older installation (sudo apt-get purge fglrx* was not enough it seemed).\nIn \"Additional Drivers\", I am not able to install the post-release version of fglrx\nWhen I remove fglrx, I only get a black screen at boot\nHardware:\nDell Studio 1558 - i5 CPU @ 2,40 GHz - 8GB DDR3 memory - AMD HD 5470\n\nA: I found my answer.\nI was suffering from this bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unity/+bug/803943\nTemporary fix is using the PPA of Daniel van Vugt: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unity/+bug/803943/comments/53\nWhen the patch is accepted, it will be fixed in the standard updates. \nMy CPU usage for compiz dropped from 40% to 5% when idle\nMy GPU temp lowered from 75°C to 50°C when idle, from 100°C to 75°C when stressed. A huge improvement!\n\nA: I had a similar problem with my video card. I have an ATI Radeon HD 3200 running with an AMD Turion. When I was using Ubuntu 11.10 32 bits it was reaching 90ºC! I tried many different things but none of them worked. So, almost giving up, I changed the Ubuntu 11.10 32 bits for the 64 bits version. Now it reaches at most 80º. If you have an AMD processor and you are using the 32 bits version I think it's interesting to try using the 64 bits version. = )\n", "Q: How can I reset recent documents on every login?

The Windows hibernation file then becomes asynchronous with the new data on the NTFS partition.\nOne way to loosely verify the this particular problem is just to experiment with it.\nOr,  use data recovery software on the NTFS partition without booting into Windows. (That is to say: boot into Windows; hibernate Windows; boot into Ubuntu; write some files to NTFS; shutdown; remove laptop disk, plug laptop disk into another computer via USB, and then use recovery software.) The software will pick up files that may or may not be connected with the master file table (MFT). Then you can see that files are in fact written to the NTFS partition, but Windows does not \"see\" them after restoring the state of the system at hibernation time.\nAlso, a chkdsk from Windows on the NTFS partition might reveal problems.\nAnd, aking1012 mentioned sync, which you can do with sudo sync before rebooting to assure yourself that all file system data was flushed to disk for troubleshooting purposes.\nWas this the source of the problem?

For some reason, after installing Windows 7 and going back to Ubuntu the time went from the correct hour at that moment, 12:30PM to 7:30AM. This happened after installing Windows 7. For what I understand the BIOS has a time set, Ubuntu has the same time that is shown in the BIOS when installing it. At least up to this point is what I have seen. Now after installing Windows 7 (And believe me this is only for testing the performance of Windows 7 against Ubuntu in which case Windows 7 is falling behind a lot on the same hardware) the time changes in Ubuntu to the wrong one that is set in Windows 7.\nI actually do not change the time in Windows 7 since this is one of the checks I am doing to see if the operating system can correctly grab the time. Windows 7 fails. Ubuntu does not BUT Windows 7 actually changes the time for Ubuntu if I boot with it afterwards.\nSo my question is, why/how does time change in Ubuntu after installing Windows.\nNOTE - I have set Ubuntu time to \"manual\" instead of grabbing it from the Internet just to test out this.\n\nA: Because of the way the two operating systems set the hardware clock. by Default ubuntu uses UTC, and windows localtime.\nSo when you shut down, your hard ware clock is set to say \"13:00\". When you boot, windows sees \"13:00\" as localtime, so 1 PM, but Ubuntu sees that as UTC and so converts the time back from UTC to local time.\nYou can fix this by either asking windows to set the hardware clock with UTC, or Ubuntu to use localtime.\nto make the change in Ubuntu, edit edit /etc/default/rcS and change \nUTC=yes to no, like this:\n# assume that the BIOS clock is set to UTC time (recommended)\nUTC=no\n\nSee:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuTime#Multiple_Boot_Systems_Time_Conflicts\n\nA: This has to deal with hardware clock being set to UTC (GMT). Ubuntu Correctly reads the local time by adding/subtracting time from your local clock. Windows does not use UTC and thus messes up the time. Have a look https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuTime\nThough the documentation is old, it is still relevant.\n\nA: If you have Windows 7 and have installed Service Pack 2, you can use a registry hack to set Windows to use UTC. If you need the registry hack, make sure you get it from the Microsoft website. If you don't know what this means, use the UTC=no method in /etc/default/rcS in the answer from Bodhi Zazen.\nI don't know about Windows 8, though.\n", "Q: How to delete Gwibber history?

Rather, use the very handy xfconf-query command in a bash script to --set a --property in xfce4-keyboard-shortcuts.xml.\nHere is an example:\n$ xfconf-query --create --channel xfce4-keyboard-shortcuts --property /commands/custom/XF86AudioMute --type string --set 'amixer -D pulse set Master 1+ toggle'\n\nAs a matter of fact, this is part of my solution to restore the function of the mute button in Xubuntu 12.04.\n\nA: Keyboard shortcuts are tucked away in your Settings Manager - Window Manager - Keyboard\n\nScroll down the list - you will see several workspace shortcuts, some defined with a shortcut and some awaiting to be defined.\n\nA: There are more available in Settings Editor in Settngs Manager, which can be launched from the command-line using:\nxfce4-settings-editor\n\nThis will display:\n\n\nA: You can also play in a console with gedit and /apps/metacity/keybinding_commands or /apps/metacity/global_keybindings\n\nA: Easy Way\nHeres a script that handles binding commands to keys cleanly in Xubuntu. Download keybind.c, compile it (example is given in readme in link) and simply run ./keybind \"<keys to bind to>\" \"<command>\"\nFor example heres some I use:\n./keybind \"<Control><Alt>Delete\" \"gnome-system-monitor\"\n\n./keybind \"<Control><Alt>Up\" \"xrandr -o inverted\"\n./keybind \"<Control><Alt>Down\" \"xrandr -o normal\"\n./keybind \"<Control><Alt>Right\" \"xrandr -o left\"\n./keybind \"<Control><Alt>Left\" \"xrandr -o right\"\n\nDisclosure: I created the script.\nSlightly less Easy Way\nIf you're running a Xubuntu system and want to do it from the terminal it is a simple procedure too. \nFor debugging, here is where keybinding shortcuts are stored in XFCE4: $ gedit ~/.config/xfce4/xfconf/xfce-perchannel-xml/xfce4-keyboard-shortcuts.xml\nUnderlying Schema:\n1) Remove existing commands bound to the binding keys \n2) Set new command to keys\n1a) \n`xfconf-query --reset --channel xfce4-keyboard-shortcuts --property \"/commands/custom/<Control><Alt>Down\"`<br />\n`xfconf-query --reset --channel xfce4-keyboard-shortcuts --property \"/xfwm4/custom/<Control><Alt>Down\"`<br />\n2)\n`xfconf-query --create --channel xfce4-keyboard-shortcuts --property \"/commands/custom/<Control><Alt>Down\" --type string --set 'gedit'`\n\nnote if you're binding to  key, ubuntu systems treat  and  equally and you will need to unbind any key bindings with in the above example <Primary><Alt>Down \n", "Q: Where do files ending with a ~ come from? Sometimes duplicate filenames occur while working on Ubuntu which differ only by a ~ from the original filenames. \nI know kate generates backup files and calls them your_file.py.swp. Is this something similar? If yes which program generates them? And why don't they disappear?\n\nA: They are back up files , automatically generated as you say. Several applications use this format. Usually .swp files are made when the file is actually open for editing, and any automatic backup saved to file~\ntouch file\n\nls | grep file\nfile\n\nnano -B file \n# make a change to file, save changes\n\nls | grep file\nfile\nfile~\n\nI am not sure about kate, but unless you are using another editor, I presume it is automatic backups (every 10 minutes ? ) from kate.\n\nA: Kate generates them too.  You can turn them off or configure them differently in Settings > Configure Kate > Editor Component > Open/Save > Advanced.\n\n\nA: If you're using gedit to edit existing files, the default preference is to \"Create a backup of files before saving\". If you would like to change this default behavior, open gedit, then go up to the Menu bar and select Edit --> Preferences. Click on the Editor Tab, and Uncheck the box under File Saving in order to turn it off. \n\nAnother common ~ file creator is emacs - some would argue it's even more popular/common than gedit.\n", "Q: Update-manager not working due to 404 error \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow can I fix a 404 Error using a PPA? \n\nI have the following error\nFailed to Download repository information\nCheck your Internet connection..\n\nW:Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/mozillateam/firefox-stable/ubuntu/dists/oneiric/main/source/Sources/dists/oneiric/main/source/Sources  404  Not Found\nW:Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/mozillateam/firefox-stable/ubuntu/dists/oneiric/main/source/Sources/dists/oneiric/main/binary-i386/Packages  404  Not Found\n\n\nA: Your system has a PPA that doesn't exist.\nThere is no Firefox-stable PPA for Oneric, as the latest Firefox is already in the main repos.

I run Ubuntu 11.10 (32 bit) on a Dell Inspiron 9400. Per default, however, the multimedia buttons control a weird mix of Master, PCM and LFE settings that lead to a jump in volume on the first step and not much difference on subsequent ones. Also, the mix between front speakers and subwoofer is poor.\nBy playing around in the alsamixer my guess is that best results would be achieved by setting Master (that apparently controls front speakers) and LFE (the subwoofer) fixed and control only PCM (that seems to be the master volume).\nIs there any clean way to configure this? Or is this the wrong approach to begin with?\n\nA: With amixer you should be able to adjust the volume with a single shell command. gnome-keybinding-properties enables you to set a custom short cut. So you can place a amixer command with appropriate paramaters for every multimedia button on your keyboard. This is kind of a work a round. I don't know if it would be possible also directly, but I don't see any advantages too.\n", "Q: What should I install to fix this error in Moovida Media Center?

Can you help me? I want to make my flashdisk write protected. So no one can format my flashdisk because the data inside the flashdisk is important.\n\nA: If you dont want someone to format your flashdisk then dont give them access to it. Even if your flashdisk has a hardware switch for write protection like SD-Card has, any one can easily use it to turn-off write protection. So your best bet is to keep your flash safe in your drawer and lock the drawer.\nI would suggest you get your self some cloud storage and keep you important files there. There are free services available like DropBox.\nAnd just for sake of information, here is a list of flashdrives with physical write protection buttons http://www.fencepost.net/2010/03/usb-flash-drives-with-hardware-write-protection/\n\nA: You cannot do that. At best, you can remove write permissions from files (at a filesystem level), so you cannot accidentally remove or overwrite the file.\nI haven't seen write-protected USB Flash drives, but media like a SD card have such a protection switch. If the data is really important, make copies (backups) of the data and/ or store it on a SD card. After saving the changes and safely removing the media from your computer (Eject / Unmount), toggle the switch to make it read-only.\n", "Q: My Laptop Battery Does Not Charge I am using a HP Pavilion and Ubuntu 11.10. I have been using Ubuntu for about a year. \nRecently (in Nov or there about), I noticed my battery never charges fully no matter how long it has been plugged in. I thought it was a problem with the power pack. However, after changing it, the problem is still persisting.\nI upgraded to 11.10 form 11.04 at about the same time so I do not know if this is a software or hardware issue.\nHow do I solve this?\nThis problem has been written about in various forms\nLaptop battery not charging after update?. \nPlease help me or find someone that can.\n\nA: If you suspect its a software issue and that it never occurred in previous versions of ubuntu, I would boot your computer with a LiveCD of 10.04/10.10/11.04 and leave your power-pack plugged in.\nIf the problem persists this would indicate a hardware issue.\n\nA: A fairly common feature in new (within two years old) laptops is a battery buffer that stops the battery filling right up to the top. They do this to preserve the overall lifespan of the battery. Have a look in the BIOS settings and see if there's anything suggesting that. There might also be a battery calibration test that can be done from BIOS.\nIf that's not the case, it could easily be hardware. It certainly does make sense to test the software but I've seen laptop batteries die a lot faster than 12 months from constant trickle-charging.

I had some problems with Ubuntu 11.10 (my PC is too old for it) and decided to downgrade to 10.04 LTS. Everything is fine except that all programs that are installed aren't up to date. For instance Rhythmbox says that databese was created by newer version of the program  and can't read it.\nUpdate manager seems to find only system updates...\nHow do I update programs (Rhythmbox, Empathy etc) after downgrade?\n\nA: If your PC is too old for 11.10, you should consider using a light weight distribution instead of downgrading to an older Ubuntu version. Try out lubuntu or xubuntu!\nIf you still want to your run newer programs on an older version of Ubuntu, this is possible but not relly the suggested way. A new version of Ubuntu is released every 6 months and that moment all programs are updated to an up to date version (not only the core system - but actually it's difficult to say what exactly is part of Ubuntu's core system and what are only extra programs). This enables developers to test if everything is working fine with the distributed programs for every Ubuntu version. Otherwise nobody could ensure that all the different versions of programs are compatible. Most GNU/Linux distributions do it that way. Only some provide also a not so stable branch with really up to date software.\nSo Ubuntu updates are primarily for security patches and bugs but not for new features. If you still want newer versions of some programs on and older version of Ubuntu, there are several ways to do so. Best would be to find backports. If there are no official backports you can add repositories. The worst would be to find a deb file or even a tar ball, but then you won't even get security updates.\n\nA: Your PC is too old for it? How much RAM do you have? 1G should be enough.\nAn Ubuntu release contains all the applications you are talking about. To update to newer versions of individual applications, you'll have to find backports. There'll be official backports for some packages, but not many. If there aren't official backports, you may be able to find PPAs with newer versions of applications, but the quality will vary and there are no guarantees (and probably no security support).\n", "Q: Ubuntu Natty Froze when copying files to my Ext4 External Drive, files can be recovered if corrupted? I heard that Ext4 Was more stable in these conditions, but how can I be sure that my files didn't get corrupted in the process?  I heard that because of Ext4 journaling file that the files aren't very easy to get corrupted as compared to NTFS (which is what I switched from).\nAnyone to help me out with any of this?\n\nA: I agree with mikewhatever. Additional this might help:\nThe source shouldn't be damaged. The destination could be incomplete or so. If you want to see what was copied correctly and what not you can use diff or rsync. Type\nrsync -nrcv source destination\n\nTo get a list of files which haven't been copied correctly. Leave out the parameter c to actually copy the data again.\nTo check a linux file system you can use fsck (NTFS should be better checked by windows itself). To check all ext3 and ext4 partitions during next system boot you can use:\nsudo touch /forcefsck\n\nDon't use fsck on mounted partitions!\nGraphical tool\nYou can use the Disk Utility (run it form System / Administration or ALT + F2 and palimpsest). This is a graphical tool for hard disks and other storage devices. You'll find your harddisk there. Unmount it (there is a button there) and click Check Filesystem.\n\nA: Any file system with journaling is less prone to corruption, including NTFS. That said, it has nothing to do with freezing when copying. If the data has only been copied partway, there is nothing a file system can do. Just copy the files again, overwriting the files that had already been copied.\n", "Q: Are Linux VirtualBox images legal to distribute? I have a website with adsense.\nCan I share Linux distro VirtualBox images with users?\nIs this legal?\nWill it affect my adsense account?\n\nA: You need to be careful. Linux - as in the kernel - is licensed under the GPL. This means you are free to distribute it, but you are under an obligation to supply the source code used to build it if requested - though you may charge a fee to cover your costs when doing so. Of course, it is unlikely you will be asked, but you might be.\nThe wider operating system - sometimes referred to as GNU/Linux - will be covered by a variety of licenses and I am sure it is this, as opposed to the kernel, you wish to distribute. Depending on your jurisdiction (software patent law is very different in the EU from the US, for instance) and the software used you may not be free to distribute that at all eg you may have software which is built using combined GPL and non-GPL code (you can build this but you may not distribute it in this form) etc - you need to check all this thoroughly.\n\nA: Well, the legal situation is certainly more complicated than \"Linux is totally free\", but in this case, there are likely to be no problems. \nDistributing Linux is not a problem. It is published under a license that is created just for this purpose. For details, read the GNU General Public License , which practically all Linux software is distributed under. \nWhat you may not do is distribute copyrighted material (i.e. software, videos, music, images etc. that are not under a free license) inside your VirtualBox images.\nOh, and I don't have VirtualBox's license documents handy, but if you don't use the OpenSource edition but Oracle's own edition, I'd read its license very thoroughly. Might well be possible that there are catches in there, too.\n\nA: Linux is totally free and you are welcome to distribute Linux in one way or another unless your distro images contains proprietary software.\n\nA: If you've only installed packages from the official Ubuntu repositories (that doesn't include Canonical's partner repostiory), it'll be legal to distribute. That's a requirement we have for all software we include in Ubuntu: http://www.ubuntu.com/project/about-ubuntu/licensing\nSame goes for Debian main and contrib: http://www.debian.org/social_contract\n\nA: The stuffs you need to be careful about when distributing linux image is proprietary software. Common ones that you need to double check includes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Adobe Flash Player\n\n*Proprietary Video/Audio codecs\n\n*Proprietary Games\n\n*Drivers\n\n\nThis list is incomplete, and even some proprietary softwares may allow redistribution, you will need to check the licenses of the softwares installed in the image. This could potentially be a lot of reading, although there are some shortcuts, all packages in the 'main' and 'restricted' for Ubuntu allows free redistribution. So you'll only need to read the licenses for softwares not installed from those repositories.\n", "Q: How do I find Unity Lenses? Is there a way in Ubuntu to find community written Lenses?

Why?\nPlease, how can I solve this problem (Browse Files) on Ubuntu 11.10?\n\nA: the problem is probably in some kernel/gvfs changes that caused regression in bluetooth operation.\nA workaround that has been posted in some places is to manually mount devices via the OBEX filesystem, as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install obexfs (only needed once)\n\n*hcitool scan -- will return list of bluetooth devices with their addresses, looking like 8F:77:...:16\n\n*have a directory ready to mount device onto, e.g. ~/Device\n\n*obexfs -b 8F:77:..:16 /Device\nThen, the device's files can be browsed over bluetooth under the Device folder.\nTo unmount when finished with browsing the device, use\n\n\n*\n\n*fusermount -u ~/Device\nMy guess is that the problem will be corrected in some not-so-distant update.\n\nA: Premek Brada is Right...\nLook here too:\nhttp://www.worldofnubcraft.com/1767/a-bluetooth-quick-fix-hack-for-ubuntu-11-10/\n\nA: Try to restart bluetooth with\nsudo service bluetooth restart\n\n\nA: There seems to be a problem with sharing files from a bluetooth device with ubuntu. I have tried a work around using my Android phone. Install \"wifi file transfer\" in the apps store and run. You should be able to transfer files using a browser interface. It works for me... You will be requied to type in the ip address of the phone in your internet browser. this is all explained on the device once started.\n", "Q: Cannot find /usr/bin/ in nautilus I'm trying to get the program \"Desktop Drapes\" to run on startup, and so far the only guide that's gotten me anywhere is this one: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=8810911#post8810911\nThings progress smoothly until I enter gksudo nautilus into the terminal. According to the guide, from here I should be able to /usr/bin and change the properties of \"drapestart.\" However, in the root folder I find only a Desktop icon that leads to an empty menu.\nI've entered gksudo nautilus while cd'd into /usr/bin and from [username]@[username]-desktop:~$, and the result is the same. Any idea what I'm doing wrong?\nThank you for taking the time out to read this. :)\n\nA: Probably the easiest way would be to open the Start-Up Application window and when creating the new entry use the command line:\nbash -c \"sleep 20 && drapes &\"\n\ni.e. you dont really need to create a file in /usr/bin since the above will achieve the same thing.\n\nA: In line with your question.\nWhen you run \"gksudo nautilus\" it opens  in root's home directory, not yours.\nSimply click on \"File System\"  in nautilus's left sidebar & then navigate wherever, in this case to usr > bin\nOr include where you wish to go in the command, like \ngksudo nautilus /usr/bin\n\n\nA: The easiest way to make a file executable, IMO, is to use the chmod command:\nsudo chmod +x /usr/bin/drapestart\n\n", "Q: How do i completely uninstall tor? (and then install it?) First of all, I'm really new to Ubuntu and Tor. I've been trying to get tor working for days now and I can't seem to do it. Right now I'm trying to remove all remnants of tor/vidalia/polipo from my computer so I can start fresh again. \nI've uninstalled vidalia and tor from the software center, but there's still two folders in the /etc directory (privoxy and polipo). Does this mean that these programs are still installed? If not, can I just delete the directory and how would I do that? I'm using Ubuntu 11.04.\n\nA: Try this command line, it succeded for me!\nsudo apt-get remove --purge tor-browser\n\n\nA: To remove the configuration files, re-install tor and polipo, then purge them (remove removes the application, but leaves the system configuration files.\nsudo apt-get purge tor polipo\n\nFrom the apt-get man page\npurge \n\npurge is identical to remove except that packages are removed and\n  purged (any configuration files are deleted too).\n\n", "Q: moving file to ntfs volume I have a nfts disk that I use to keep movies and music: on ubuntu, I created a folder onto this disk and moved a video file from my ext4 disk to that folder. Turned out I could not access to the folder on windows 7. Is this some kind of permission-related problem? Can sombody help to set the disk in order to receive and run files from either os? \n\nA: I am afraid that you moved the file with root permission. It also happens when you format your ntfs disk from ubuntu. Ubuntu does not give enough permission by default. Install ntfs-config. Give Internal and External writer permission to ntfs partition using ntfs-config. And also change your moved files permission\nsudo chmod -R 755 /media/ntfsdiskname/\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 11.10 not displaying any open applications, when running in VirtualBox I have managed to get 3D acceleration to work when running Ubuntu 11,10 in virtualbox, however, when Ubuntu loads the unity display, any application I launch seems to be hidden.\nThe open apps are running, but not being displayed.\nAll works fine when in 2D, so it is something to do with the 3D acceleration.\nWondered if anyone had the same issue...\n\n\n*\n\n*Host: OS x Lion\n\n*Guest: Ubuntu 11.10\n\n\nWhen I resize the virtualbox window, the applications flashes on to the screen, but then disappears again.\nWhen I right click, I can create a document, the icon is shown on the desktop, but when I open it, again it is there but does not display.\nAdditional:\n\n\n*\n\n*Virtualbox settings:\n\n\n*\n\n*Video Memory: 128MB\n\n*3D Acceleration Enabled\n\n*Base Memory 1512MB\n\n*1CPU (uncapped)\n\n*VirtualBox Version 4.1.8 r75467 \n\n\n*Installed on Guest: \n\n\n*\n\n*xserver-xorg-video-intel\n\n*xserver-xorg-video-vmware\n\n*VIRTUALBOX-GUEST-DKMS\n\n*VIRTUALBOX-GUEST-UTILS\n\n*VIRTUALBOX-GUEST-X11\n-VIRTUALBOX-OSE-GUEST-X11 \n\n*ALL VERSIONS 4.1.2-DSFG-1UBUNTU1\n\n\n*Host info:\n\n\n*\n\n*Processor  2.53 GHz Intel Core i5\n\n*Memory  8 GB 1067 MHz DDR3\n\n*Graphics  NVIDIA GeForce GT 330M 512 MB\n\n*Software  Mac OS X Lion 10.7.2 (11C74)\n\n*Extension Pack: Oracle_VM_VirtualBox_Extension_Pack-4.1.8-75467.vbox-extpack\n\n\n\nUnity 3D displays ok, but when any program is opened it is not displayed, however is running, as though it is behind the desktop.

Insert some running(new is better) disk(cd and dvd) and ensure that it can read/run each disk successfully.\nSecond, Check disk speed in brasero/k3b before burn the disk. Set disk speed(Dvd : 8X and cd/mp3: 24X). Do not multi-task during burning. That means leave your laptop alone during burning process running.\nEdited Version:\n\nI tried Brasero and k3b, both without success\n\nWhat is the error message that brasero or k3b shows?\nAgain about burning process, after burn dvd brasero automatically eject the drive or shows a warning \"Eject the cd drive manually\". So if it will not automatically eject then just eject manually.(it is not a major task but should done).\nIf you can open your written dvd(i know data is not readable) then provide the output:\nls -l /media/cdrom0\n\nWhat kind of output shows if you do this:\ncp -a /media/cdrom0/anyfile anyfile\n\n\nA: it could be the back-end it uses which is probably cdrkit, you can read more about it here\nyou could replace it with a ppa\n", "Q: Screen Brightness on new MacBook Pro 8,3? 2011 8,3 MacBook Pro running 64bit 11.10.\nThe screen brightness keys seem to actually do things, but nothing actually changes with regard to actual laptop screen brightness. (See this video. Ubuntu can sense when the buttons are pressed, but nothing actually happens with screen brightness. I know you wouldn't be able to see it if it did work, but it doesn't.)\nIs this a known issue? How can I adjust the screen brightness on my MacBook Pro? \nI know I can do something like this in the AMD/ATI FGLRX configuration software, but it actually just adjusts the output picture, not the physical laptop's screen brightness. What can I do? \n\nA: Are you using ubuntu on mac? If yes then you can change your screen brightness using the following command:\necho 4 | sudo tee /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness\n\nValue range: 1 to 10 [1 lowest, 10 highest]\nAlso you can set the brightness at start-up. Append the line in /etc/rc.local before exit 0\n\nA: I have a white MacBook running Ubuntu and the brightness keys work fine; however, it does seem to be an issue with the MacBook Pro (I don't have one handy to test on). But I did find this in my search. It looks like a script that you can bind to a key event. The tutorial covers KDE, but binding a script to a key in Gnome is relatively simple as well, if I recall correctly. Does this properly address your problem?\n\nA: Apparently, you need to boot to EFI, not to emulated BIOS, as is what happens with rEFIt. \n", "Q: Windows Dynamic Disk not reading in Ubuntu While using windows i changed my hard disk partitions from \"Logical Disk\" to \"Dynamic Disk\"..... then i installed Ubuntu in c drive. when i opened ubuntu the contents of C:Drive are shown but i am unable to view the contents of D drive or e drive (both of them are dynamic). Please help.. i tried reinstalling ubuntu quite a number of times which didn't help. Also The windows disk partition manager is unable to change the drives back to Logical Drive.. What should I do??\n\nA: \"Dynamic Disks\" are a Windows proprietary format that can not be used on other operating systems like Ubuntu.  You need to convert it back to a basic disk in Windows.\n\nA: First, you need to change a dynamic disk back to a basic disk.

I've just made the switch from Red Hat Enterprise Linux to Ubuntu Server, and need to do network configuration with static IP addresses, multiple Ethernet interfaces, channel bonding for redundancy, a bridge for VMs, etc.\nIn RHEL, I did this by writing configuration files in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts. Is there a similar file or directory in Ubuntu where you can configure all network interfaces? If so, where can I find documentation for it? If not, how do I do network configuration beyond the basics? (I've seen mention of /etc/network/interfaces, but I'm not sure it does what I'm looking for.) Thanks!\nUpdate:\nThanks to man interfaces, man bridge-utils-interfaces, and the Ubuntu community documentation page for bonding, I've mostly figured out what I need. The one thing I'm still not sure of is how to put a bridge on top of a bonded interface. Here's the relevant part of my interfaces file:\nauto br0\niface br0 inet static\n    address 10.1.254.101\n    netmask 255.255.255.0\n    network 10.1.254.0\n    broadcast 10.1.254.255\n    gateway

this correct?\n\nA: Ubuntu puts all the interfaces into /etc/network/interfaces , the syntax is similar to RHEL for most of what you want.\nWith Debian/Ubuntu you can run commands from that file with pre-up, post-up, pre-down, post-down.\nFor your bridge\nsudo apt-get -y install bridge-utils uml-utilities\n\nsample /etc/network/interfaces\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\nauto br0\niface br0

I've been using nVidia cards in Ubuntu boxes for years. The closed source drivers have been great and I've even found my way around the nvidia-settings program when I've needed to. I'm now in the market for a new graphics card.   Is there (at present) any reason to entertain switching to an ATI card?\n\nA: Any. Doesn't really matter!\nBut IMO I would go buy Nvidia as their drivers are more stable on both Windows and Linux as compared to ATI, but if you have a hackintosh compatible hardware and plan to build a hackintosh in future go for ATI.\nIf you dual boot with windows then ATI seems to be more budget friendly.\nIf you need help with Hackintosh compatible hardware have a look here see if its possible for you.\nBut if you ask me, I would go for NVIDIA any day as game developers support it the most.\n\nA: One way to check compatibility of a given graphics card with Ubuntu is to check Ubuntu's officially certified Component catalog.\nFrom the website:\n\nCanonical and hardware providers certify systems containing the components below.\n\nThere you can, for example, search for \"5870\" (if you're interested in checking compatibility of AMD Radeon HD5870). This specific search will yield No results found., meaning that there is no officially certified hardware containing this card.\nIf however you're searching for \"5450\" (for AMD Radeon HD 5450), then you will find Park [Mobility Radeon HD 5430/5450/5470] and a list of laptops containing this component. Unfortunately this is not a definitive blessing for the given hardware component, but it still comes as close as it gets to official certification (some strings are attached). At the very least, it means that it is known to work with Ubuntu.\nIn addition, you may go to Ubuntu Certification Programme at Launchpad to check if there were reports with issues for the component/laptop that you're interested in.\n\nLastly, you may also have a list of certified laptops by accessing the Ubuntu Desktop certified hardware.\nFrom the website:\n\nUbuntu Certified hardware\nUbuntu Certified hardware has passed our extensive testing and review process to make sure Ubuntu runs well out of the box and it is ready for your business. We work closely with OEMs to jointly make Ubuntu available on a wide range of devices.\n\nFrom that list you can check the graphics cards of supported laptops.\n\nA: Does not matter, just check the compatibility list before you buy (both make both good and bad cards).\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsVideoCards \nand also http://free3d.org\n\nA: Stay away from AMD for now.\nSomething to keep in mind that may disuade you from using an AMD/ATI GPU with Ubuntu: \nAs of Ubuntu 16.04 (the latest release as of this writing), the AMD Catalyst driver (fglrx) is no longer supported or available.  To be clear, the fglrx driver is now deprecated in 16.04 and you are forced to use an alternative open source driver.  Without the fglrx driver, your video experience will most likely be vastly inferior to what you might expect.\n\nA: Having RX 560 on Ubuntu 16.04 with default Ubuntu driver (not amdpro driver).

I am using Ubuntu 11.10 to decrypt the folder.\n\nA: From wikipedia:\n\nFiles encrypted with EFS can only be decrypted by using the RSA private key(s) matching the previously-used public key(s). The stored copy of the user's private key is ultimately protected by the user's logon password. Accessing encrypted files from outside Windows with other operating systems (Linux, for example) is not possible — not least of which because there is currently no third party EFS component driver.\n\nEFS - Encrypting File System - is native to Windows & Microsoft.  Microsoft have not released this as opensource - and no-one (as yet) has clean reversed engineered this.\nI'm afraid - the only way you will be to decrypt a windows 7 file and folder encrypted using native windows encryption is via windows itself.\n\nA: Depends on what you encrypted the file with.

I was looking for something like that when I stumbled upon these:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://bugs.launchpad.net/unity/+bug/579674\n\n*https://bugs.launchpad.net/unity/+bug/853865\nYou can still toggle full screen mode by hitting F11 (that should work with other applications as well), but doing so will also remove the tab captions in Chrome.\n", "Q: How do I get a ZTE MF651 USB Modem working?

I have Firefox in the start menu, but there are no \"properties\" like in Windows.\nHow do I find out were Firefox is installed and how do I check the path of link of a menu item?\n\nA: (I suppose you still don't use Unity but Gnome 2.)\nThat's a bit annoying in Gnome. What I do is, I click right and choose Add launcher to desktop. Then you have the launcher on your desktop and there is a context menu entry Properties (so again click right on the new file on your desktop and then Properties). This dialog will present most of the available information from the launcher.\nAn alternative would be to right click the application menu and choose edit. There you see all entries and you can also select Properties.\nIf you really want to find out the whole path for firefox, this shell command might be useful:\nwhich firefox\n\nThis returns the full path to the file, which is executed when only firefox is called. whereis is a similar command which locates source/binary and manuals sections for specified files.\nNote that a launcher file is just a text file with the ending .desktop.

This usually happens to computers with low specifications. From the information already posted by you, it seems as though your computer does run on low specifications. (The video card \"Chipset: \"AMD Radeon HD 6410D\" is known for low performance).\nNext time, try logging out from one account before logging into another account. This way, your computer's resources will not be locked up by an account that is not being used.\nI believe this method will avoid your system from freezing.\nIf you prefer to \"switch\" accounts rather than logging out and then logging in to another account, you need to upgrade your computer or buy a new one with higher specifications/performance.\n\nA: Accounts with no password can be a particular problem for the locked account authorisation.  I don't mean the LightDM login screen - that works fine with null passwords.  The locked account authorisation comes into play if the account is locked by the screensaver or similar, or after the focus is switched away from the user as happens when switching accounts.  It just doesn't know about null passwords or how to handle the situation.\nI suggest changing the passwords on all the kid's accounts to something like 'abc' or similar, and retesting.\nI'm not certain this is the problem mind you since the normal way it manifests is simply a complete inability to get back into the account once you switch away from it, but I certainly think it will make your life a lot easier if can give the locked account verification process something to work with.\n\nA: ALT-SysReq-k (or ALT-PrintScreen-k) which has taken the place of CTRL-ALT-BKSP to restart Xorg does not fix the situation. I always return to a blank screen.\ndo-release-upgrade from 11.10 to 12.10 greatly reduced the incidences of Xorg inescapable blank screens.\n\nA: I'm guessing here but are you on wireless with mounted shares. Logging out disconnects your wireless, and will hang linux. You can wait for it to time out (some times several minutes) .\nTheres no real fix aside from manually unmounting first. \nAlso ATI cards have always been really picky about VTY switching.

I have a single python script that I want to distribute as a deb package. It is a indicator which shows local date in Unity panel. I did follow create a .deb Package from scripts or binaries but I could not create a deb package because it fails. \nCan someone give me a step-by-step instruction on what I should do? As far as I know this script depends on python-appindicator. \nNOTE:\nI do not want any links to Debian/Ubuntu packaging instructions. I have seen most of them. I don't find them beginner friendly.\n\nA: What follows is a basic example of how a source package for a python script might look. While most of the packaging tutorials are a bit complex, they can really help if you hit a problem. That said, I first learned the basics of Debian packaging by simply looking at Debian packages. apt-get source something similar and learn by example.\nHere's your basic source package layout:\nmy-script/\n    -- myScript\n    -- debian/\n        -- changelog\n        -- copyright\n        -- compat\n        -- rules\n        -- control\n        -- install\n\nRun dch --create in the directory to create a properly formatted debian/changelog entry.\ndebian/copyright should look like:\nFormat: http://www.debian.org/doc/packaging-manuals/copyright-format/1.0/\nUpstream-Name: myScript\nUpstream-Contact: Name, <email@address>\n\nFiles: *\nCopyright: 2011, Name, <email@address>\nLicense: (GPL-2+ | LGPL-2 | GPL-3 | whatever)\n Full text of licence.\n .\n Unless there is a it can be found in /usr/share/common-licenses\n\ndebian/compat can just be: 7\ndebian/rules:\n#!/usr/bin/make -f\n\n%:\n    dh $@ --with python2\n\nNote that there must be \"tab\" before dh $@ --with python2, not spaces.\nNote: Python2 is deprecated. For a single python file, just dh $@ (without --with python) works.\ndebian/control:\nSource: my-script\nSection: python\nPriority: optional\nMaintainer: Name, <email@address>\nBuild-Depends: debhelper (>= 7),\n               python (>= 2.6.6-3~)\nStandards-Version: 3.9.2\nX-Python-Version: >= 2.6\n\n\nPackage: my-script\nArchitecture: all\nSection: python\nDepends: python-appindicator, ${misc:Depends}, ${python:Depends}\nDescription: short description\n A long description goes here.\n .\n It can contain multiple paragraphs\n\ndebian/install:\nmyScript usr/bin/\n\nThis file indicates which file will be installed into which folder.\nNow build it with debuild --no-tgz-check\nThis will create a functional deb package. Lintian is going to throw a few warnings regarding the lack of an orig.tar.gz, but unless you plan on creating a proper upstream project that makes tarball releases you'll probably just want to ignore that for now.\n\nA: Making a .deb package from a single Python 3 script (updated 2021)\nThis answer will seem (and is) long compared to the others/ But, unlike the accepted answer, it will work for Python 3, and in 2021. Also, it doesn't produce lots of warnings, because it includes all the requirements, like a man page.\nHere is how to make a Debian package (yes, it will work on Ubuntu) from a single Python 3 script. First, let's make the script. It will be a simple hello-world program. Name this file hello-world. Put it inside a folder named hello-world-1.0.0. Put the hello-world-1.0.0 folder inside a second folder called work. The directory structure here is a bit... odd, though. debuild (the tool we use to build the package) will place the .deb file one directory up from where we build it, so the directory structure will look like this:\nFrom now on, unless otherwise mentioned, I will assume you are in the work/hello-world-1.0.0 directory.\nwork/\n├─ hello-world-1.0.0/\n│  ├─ hello-world\n\nNote that I used a hyphen in the filename, not an underscore, as Debian doesn't want underscores in package names. I also omitted the file extension, which is fine because I added a shebang at the top of my script.\nHere is the Python script I will use as an example. As mentioned above, it is named hello-world (without a file extension).\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\ndef hello_world():\n    print(\"Hello world!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    hello_world()\n\nSee this Stack Overflow question for what if __name__ = \"__main__:\" means. The shebang is included as per this question.\nFirst, just make sure that the code works by running it:\n$ chmod +x ./hello-world\n$ ./hello-world\nHello world!\n\nTo build the .deb file, you need the git, devscripts, build-essential, lintian, and pandoc packages installed. I'm aware that some of these packages come pre-installed, but I also wanted this guide to work on Debian, so I included them here regardless. You can install them with these commands.\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install git devscripts build-essential lintian pandoc\n\nInside the hello-world-1.0.0 folder, make a folder called debian. Inside of it, create a folder named source. Also directly inside of the debian folder, make the following files changelog, compat, control, copyright, install, and rules. Inside of the debian/source folder, make a file named format.\nYour directory tree should now look like this\nwork/\n├─ hello-world-1.0.0/\n│  ├─ debian/\n│  │  ├─ source/\n│  │  │  ├─ format\n│  │  ├─ changelog\n│  │  ├─ compat\n│  │  ├─ control\n│  │  ├─ copyright\n│  │  ├─ install\n│  │  ├─ rules\n│  ├─ hello-world\n\nNow, for the contents of these files. I will assume you are directly in the hello-world-1.0.0 folder.\ndebian/source/format\nYou can mostly ignore this, but if you are wondering, it is explained in §5.22 in the Debian documentation.\n3.0 (native)\n\ndebian/changelog\nThis file contains the changelog for the hello-world program.\nhello-world (1.0.0) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n    * Initial release:\n -- John Doe <johndoe@example.com>  Sun, 28 Nov 2021 10:18:51 -0800\n\ndebian/compat\nThis sets the debhelper compatibility level.

See §5.11 in the Debian documentation\nhello-world usr/bin/\nhello-world.1 usr/share/man/man1/\n\ndebian/rules\nThis is how Debian builds the package. See §4.4 in the Debian documentation. A word of caution: like other Makefiles, use tabs to indent. Spaces will not work.\n#!/usr/bin/make -f\n\n%:\n    dh $@\n\nOur nice hello-world package should have a man page. But the format for man pages is complex and hard to read. So, instead, we will write the man page in Markdown, and let pandoc convert it for us.\nIn the main directory (i.e., directly inside the hello-world-1.0.0 folder), make a file called hello-world.1.md. Put the following inside the file:\n% hello-world(1) hello-world 1.0.0\n% John Doe\n% November 2021\n\n# NAME\nhello-world - Prints a file until a null-character is reached\n\n# SYNOPSIS\n**hello-world** [*options*]\n\n# DESCRIPTION\n**hello-world** prints a file character-by-character until a null character is reached. The null character will not be printed\n\n# OPTIONS\n\n# EXAMPLES\n**hello-world**\n: Prints the text \"Hello world!\", followed by a newline, to the screen.\n\nBuilding this and the package requires a few steps. So, let's make a (Bash) script to instead. Create a file named build. Make it executable chmod +x ./build. Put the following in the file:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\npandoc hello-world.1.md -s -t man > hello-world.1\ndebuild --no-tgz-check -uc -us\n\nThis will generate the man page, and store it in the file named hello-world.1. It will then build the package. The -uc -us  means we wont' sign it with a GPG key, as that is complex. Run the script (./build), and if all goes well, there will be the generated package in the parent directory work.\n\nA: I would check out quickly, great for creating quick apps and generating debs google it or you can find tutorials here http://developer.ubuntu.com/\n\nA: *\n\n*create a folder with any name on your home eg: mypyscript\n\n*Open the folder and create two folders with names 'DEBIAN' and 'usr'\n\n*Open the folder DEBIAN.

Once sage -python ... is launched I need to give 3 times untrusted's password. I tried\ngnome-terminal --working-directory=\"/var/singlecellserver/single-cell-server\" \\\n    -x sage -python trusted_db.py -w 50 --untrusted-account untrusted@localhost $1 $1 $1 &\n\nbut no success.\nSOLVED\nThe problem was related to sudo and ssh. Since it is necessary to launch the process as su, the access via ssh to the untrusted account needs the ssh keys also in the root folder.\n\nA: make a shell script and put your commands inside it, pass the password only once as argument, and inside the script use $1 to get your password,\nuse $1 to get your password wherever you want inside your script.\n\nA: You can use expect\nSee http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/3065\nShould be straight forward enough, post if you need assistance.\n", "Q: Why does the program launch one way but not the other? I have this problem creating a launcher. I downloaded a tar.gz and extracted it: CaveStoryPlus from the Humble Bundle 4. If I double click the executable  in Nautilus, it launches. If I run ~/CaveStoryPlus/CaveStory+ in the terminal it doesn't launch but if I run cd CaveStoryPlus && ./CaveStory+ it launches. Then if I try to create an application launcher in Main Menu (alacarte), nothing works for me even if I state \"Application in terminal\" with the above command.\n(Edited post to show I ran the command with the full path)\n\nA: You need to be in the working directory for you to be able to issue ./CaveStory+, UNLESS the directory is added to the $PATH environment variable. Once that is done, you will be able to just call ./CaveStory+ from any directory.\nTo just edit the $PATH variable in one terminal instance and set it as a Global Variable, you can do export PATH=$PATH:/absolute-path-to-cavestory-directory/\nIf you want it to be a permanent change, add the same export PATH=$PATH:/absolute-path-to-cavestory-directory/ to your ~/.bashrc file (preferably at the end of the file, just to keep track of what you added personally)\nTake a look at the Ubuntu Community Documentation on environment variables or this blogpost for more information about environment variables.\n", "Q: How to kill non-responsive GUI task under Unity? I am searching for a newuser-friendly way to kill non-responsive GUI applications under Unity.\nI looked over the shoulder of a new Unity user who tried to use gscan2pdf - and gscan2pdf seems to be really broken - after not much tinkering it consumed much CPU und memory, the PC began trashing and the user needed to immediately kill the gscan2pdf GUI which was full-screen, non-responsive and had the focus.\nOk, I know some ways how to do it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hit Alt+F2 and type xkill -> select the window\n\n*Hit Alt+F2 start xterm, use top or pgrep and then kill PID or directly use pkill\nBoth are ways which are not very intuitive for GUI centric users.\nIs there some Unity shortcut to get something like xkill?\nOr is the best GUI-way to add a top-like GUI to the Unity-starter? And which one?\n\nA: The best way I find is using terminal window :\ngoto terminal :\nsudo ps -aux | grep \"name of application\"\n\nnote down the process ID\nsudo kill -9 \"processID\"\n\nsince, If GUI application becomes unresponsive, for time-being it slows down the X(GUI) and all actions would be slowed down, so any gui action for closing the process will be slow.\n\nA: You could create a keyboard shortcut for xkill. \n\n\n*\n\n*Type keyboard in the Unity Dash and click the icon. Select the\nshortcuts tab.\n\n*There, scroll down to the custom shortcuts section and click on the\n+ button\n\n*Now name your shortcut something and let the command be xkill and then click ok.\n\n*Finally click on the xkill shortcut and press the desired key-combo to assign a shortcut to it and that's it :)\n\n*Pressing the keyboard shortcut will activate xkill whenever you need it.\n\n\n\n\n\nA: Another thing you can do is to run System Monitor.  You can select a process with the mouse and hit the \"End Process\" button to kill it.  This should even work with unresponsive processes but I don't think it is as strong as kill -9.  It does have the advantage that it is a totally GUI solution and is very similar to the analogous Activity Monitor in Mac OS X.  That's helpful to those of us who move back and forth between Mac and Linux.\n\nA: Didn't try it by myself, but this small script looks useful. It adds a \"Force quit\" option to the unity launcher.\n\nA: Script to send SIGTERM to the currently active window based on a similar question.\n", "Q: Where is the Adobe flash player Settings Manager?

I recently performed a \"do-release-upgrade\" on one of my company's development machines to go from 11.04 Ubuntu Server to 11.10. The process actually downgraded a custom PHP installation and I had a heck of a time getting the dependencies right to recompile to the newer version. That said, I'm a little hesitant to perform the upgrade on our production machine. I then got to thinking, I want to keep up to date on software updates and security fixes, but do I really need to upgrade Ubuntu releases?\nWikipedia roughly describes a Linux Distribution as a certain kernel combined with a set of software packages. Now, if I run apt-get to manually do software and kernel updates (of which I can choose what to upgrade and what not to upgrade), how is it really any different? Only thing I can think of is that if new packages were added as part of a new version, I wouldn't get those by default. If I need them though, I can add them myself. Am I missing anything vital?\nThis also relates to a similar question I've had as to if there is any real advantage with using an LTS release. If a software package has an upgrade, how can you be stopped from upgrading to it? Thanks.\n\nA: You should not have both the Ubuntu package, and a custom compiled version of a program installed at the same time.  Either use the Ubuntu package, or build and install it yourself; do not do both.  When you have both installed they will conflict with one another as you have seen.\nYou can not choose to upgrade to new versions in the newer release; you only get upgrades in the old release, which are limited to security fixes.  If you are satisfied with that, then no, there is no need to upgrade until the old release reaches end of life.  This is the reason to stick with an LTS release: it is supported much longer so you won't have to upgrade after less than 18 months.\n", "Q: How to install ffmpeg without root?

As stated in the topic, I have the following problem: there're two VGAs in my Lenovo G770 laptop with Ubuntu 11.04, namely Intel Mobile HD and AMD Radeon HD 6650M. And if integrated videocard is working quite fine, the discrete one doesn't work at all. What I try to do, is to make the ati card work, no matter if it will be switchable graphics, or just ati working at its full potential.\nI tried proprietary drivers: fglrx, compiling ati's drivers in various ways; standard ubuntu driver. There's no option in BIOS to turn just discrete adapter on, so I got to stick to \"switchable\". ATI Catalyst does not allow me to switch video adapters while integrated one is active.\nFurthest I got myself is working vgaswitcheroo module. But here are some problems too. First of all, it does not respond to echo DIS command, but does turn the card off with echo OFF. I figured that all I have to do is echo DDIS to make delayed switch, and reboot X server to make use of ati adapter. What happens then is black screen, sometimes some of console booting lines are visible; although login screen is loading, but not visible (I can tell by sounds and by shortcuts working, so I can login in blind way). I guess this means that ati card is finally working, but something is wrong with it. \nBecause of the \"black screen\" glitch I cannot really even check what card is working.\n\nA: Given your progress on finding vga_switcheroo I'd be tempted to reinstall the OS, (and update to the latest version of Ubuntu) just to be sure that your original attempts to change drivers didn't actually set you back and break the drivers for your discrete graphics card.\nMy guess is that the drivers were originally fine, but that you originally needed to issue requests to vga_switcheroo to restart your session (logging out should be enough if you want to avoid an actual restart).\nIt's interesting to note that the choice of graphics card which is powered up originally may depend on whether your laptop is plugged in or not (depends on manufacturer, I don't know if this is the case with you). Perhaps that's what they mean by switchable mode in the BIOS.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/HybridGraphics suggests the following as you mentioned, but worth looking at the entire page to verify what's right for your case. \necho DDIS > /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch\n\nGenerally speaking you're best off with hardware support from the most recent linux kernel you can get, which means that you may get better results from installing Ubuntu Oneiric Ocelot (11.10) than with Natty Narwhal (11.04), which will mean a more up to date set of software all round.\nIf you really want to push things forward, adding the X-swat repository will give you more bleeding edge versions of your X server (the software which provides the windowing environment for Ubuntu). \nhttps://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-x-swat/+archive/x-updates\nIf you're totally crazy, it's possible to use the Xorg Edgers repository, but the warnings about it are real, and if you use this on a system you care about, you have to be very comfortable on the command line and with apt pinning to reverse any changes which break your build.\nCaveat: Although I'm an experienced linux user and administrator, I'm just learning about switchable graphics as I'm anticipating delivery of a dual-card Dell Q15R with Intel HD 3000 and GT 525M (Xmas present to my self). I'll be testing this out for myself pretty soon.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Equivalent to BSD Ports? Is there an Ubuntu equivalent to the BSD Ports system? I realize that the Linux and Ubuntu culture tends to install new software from binaries, but having used BSD ports within both BSD and Mac OS X I find it very simple and elegant and the idea of compiling from source on demand, with all dependencies figured out for you, is very powerful.\n\nA: Most linux distributions, Ubuntu included, distribute packages as binaries. Unless you have a very specific need, IMO, building from source is over rated.\nIMO, if you wish to compile from source, you are better off using LFSor Gentoo.\nYou can, of course, achieve the same thing with Ubuntu by building from source.

As I understand it, the Ubuntu windowing server (X.org) squashes these to a tiny size after loading. If you don't recall from year 2009, they used to be used in this capacity: \n\nUsing application icons instead\nUbuntu Unity will use this low-res format if needed. However it usually fetches application icons according to the Icon= value of a given window's application launcher, called a \"desktop entry\".\nIf you're a normal application developer who just plans to publish their program with the App Developer Portal, you can probably stop reading here. The free packaging service will handle writing your app's desktop entry and placing its installed icons in the right part of the filesystem. If not...\nThe nitty gritty\nHow to create a desktop entry and get Ubuntu to match your PyGTK window to the correct application icon and name is already documented in this question. But where do you actually place icons to get the right one displayed?\nAs it happens, the answer is fairly arcane. Per freedesktop.org specifications, icons are searched for and loaded by size, icon theme, and (when necessary) localization. Icons can even be installed in several difference prefixes depending on the source that installed them. Ubuntu \"queries\" icons by context.\nThe simple rules: use a unique icon name for your application to prevent false matches with other icons. Place the icon(s) for your application in one of the following directory (or a subdirectory thereof):\n<user prefix>/share/icons/<icon width>x<icon height>/apps/\n<user prefix>/share/icons/scalable/apps/\n\n<user_prefix> is your application's install path (it will be /usr for packages installed by the package manager, /usr/local/ for other software installed for all users, and $HOME/.local for single-user installations). <icon width> and <icon height> (or 'scalable' for SVGs) refer to the dimensions of the icon. If you create many different icon resolutions, Ubuntu will always find and select the right one for any context.\nGetting the right app icon to display while developing\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a scalable or high-resolution icon and place it in the correct subdirectory of  your user home's share/ directory. For example, myapp.svg would go in $HOME/.local/share/icons/scalable/\n\n*Write a desktop entry that includes the non-extensioned name of your icon. For example\n[Desktop Entry]\n\nName=My Application\nExec=my_binary\nIcon=myapp\n\nPlace this in $HOME/.local/share/applications/. Note that my_binary must be an executable searchable in one of your $PATH directories.\n\n*Run your application either (a) from the Unity Dash, (b) from the command line using the exact name of your $PATH executable [eg 'my_binary'].\nIf that all reads like gibberish...\nOpen your file browser and explore the directories /usr/share/applications/ and /usr/share/icons/.

Routers these days are switches and not hubs, thus you see only traffic to your box.\nYou need to configure your network, there are several options, the wireshark guide goes through the issues quiet well.\nhttp://wiki.wireshark.org/CaptureSetup/Ethernet\nPersonally I use a switch with a monitoring port, but you and add an additional router.\nSort of the bottom line is you need to configure your network to be able to monitor other clients.\n\nA: When you're connected to a Network HUB via a CAT5 Cable, a network interface in promiscuous mode can see ALL the packets echoed by the HUB, not just the packets addressed to that NIC's IP address.  \nHowever, when you're \"connected\" wirelessly (wlan0) each device (laptop, cellphone) has its own radio connection with the wireless AP. The wireless AP doesn't echo (retransmit) other peoples data on your channel.  \nIf your wireless device is capable of \"monitor mode\" (so it will receive packets on all wireless channels), you could use airmon-ng to set it.\n\nA: Apparently, if you are trying to sniff a \"protected\" wifi network, many adapters will treat promiscuous mode the same as non-promiscuous mode, thus you will not see traffic from other wifi hosts. You'll need to switch to monitor mode to get all the traffic.

I saw on another question here that I could be able to edit my mrb settings using EasyBCD but I can not figure out how to choose ubuntu as an operating system. My disk is already partitioned (seen from the attempted second install) so I'm pretty sure it is on the disk. Basically, how can I get ubuntu to run when I can't choose it as an operating system?\nThank you for your help.\n\nA: *\n\n*Boot using a live cd of ubuntu.\n\n*Open a terminal and run the command\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nIt lists the complete partition table of the hard disk. In there, identify which partition you have got your linux installed on. You can identify it using the drive size you had allocated for it and looking at the last column of the output which will be extended for all of your linux partitions. The partition will most probably be something like /dev/sda5 or something. Remember this partition.\n\n*Create a temporary folder in your home directory (Note: You can make the temporary folder anywhere you want. I’m using the home folder just for the sake of explanation). I’m calling it ‘temp’ for now. So that ‘temp’ folder’s path will be /home/ubuntu/temp.\n\n*Mount your linux partition there. That is, assuming that you found your linux partition to be /dev/sda5, you mount that at the ‘temp’ folder by doing the following command\nsudo mount /dev/sda5 /home/ubuntu/temp\n\n\n*If you want to check whether you have mounted the correct partition, go to your home folder and open temp. You will be in the / directory. In there you will find home, in which your home folder’s name will be there. Once you’ve confirmed you have mounted the correct partition, do step 6.\n\n*You have to install grub by showing the system where to read the data from the hard disk at the beginning. Don’t worry, just run the following command\nsudo grub-install –root-directory=/home/ubuntu/temp /dev/sda\n\nThe /dev/sda corresponds to your hard disk name. Replace it by whatever the command sudo fdisk -l command showed you.\n\n*You’re done.

When I run these programs, the processor usage shoots up but the program GUI fails to load completely (for e.g in emacs/vim - the cursor never appears).

I clicked on the Maximize button of my browser and observed that it hung up (stopped responding) and the processor usage shot up. Also the terminal from which I had started my browser showed a handful of \"Gdk-CRITICAL **: IA__gdk_window_get_origin: assertion `GDK_IS_WINDOW (window)' failed\" errors. I remember reading that this is a theme issue. I started emacs and maximized its window and it too worked flawlessly. Same with almost all applications - they hang up on reduced window size but work fine in maximized form. Also changing the theme (Any except radiance / ambiance) fixes this issue and I could use applications in maximized or reduced size. \nOn a side note, is the theme issue persistent or has been fixed?\n", "Q: How to set up multiseat network through a USB connection? This year I started a project called the Brighter Future Project. We collected donations in the USA and used them to buy/assemble computers and bring them to other places with more need. We are now in a little town called Naranjal, Ecuador trying to set up a multiseat network with a computer running Edubuntu 11.10 as the server. I'm using the HP T100 Zero Client as clients. I have installed Edubuntu, LSTP Live, and Thin Client Manager in the server. \nThere are a few blogs that show how to configure a network in Linux through Ethernet, but almost nothing on how to do it with USB connections. The T100 only connects to the server through USB. \nI was hoping you could give me a hand figuring this out ASAP, as my time here in Ecuador is limited. \n\nA: Short version:\nYou can use Userful MultiSeat Linux. As it is specifically created for the T100/T150 thin clients. It provides extensive support and is a mature and stable choice.\nhttp://www2.userful.com/products/userful-multiseat-linux\nLong version:\nSince this is a USB controlled thin client the server will at least need to have a USB driver installed for this setup to work (regardless of it's OS).\nSo as I was searching for information on the HP websites there was a prominent message that I could chat with support. So I talked to customer service about this issue for you. With the full transcript available here: http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/791914/\nFor your convenience a summary of the things I found out regarding your issue:\n\n\"Unfortunately Windows MultiPoint Server is the only operating system\n  this client has been tested and certified for use with, so I am not\n  able to guarantee that they will work with a Linux multiseat OS.\n  However, if there currently is a Linux multiseat server OS available,\n  it will likely work, although ALL functionality might not be\n  available.\"\n\nThere are no Linux drivers from HP available for the T100 and neither are there any specification documents made publicly available to be able to write your own. The suggestion I got from them was to look into other thin clients.\n\n\"At the moment, the t5545, t5565, and t5745 thin clients fully support\n  both a Linux server OS and native linux client OS.\"\n  \"The t5565 will be the lowest cost linux-supported model, which starts\n  at about $249.\"\n\nTo my knowledge the only way that T100 drivers can be developed without receiving the documentation from HP would be to find out the specification of it's communication protocol yourself. Considering that the setup includes the T100 hardware, to my knowledge the options of doing so only include ones that are illegal, so I would not suggest that. Besides that it's not something you can make a stable implementation of on short term.\nSo my next step was to give it a quick search to see if someone else already worked around this or knows something I don't know on the legal front and found that there is a Linux server available for the T100 and T150 clients. It's called Userful MultiSeat Linux. http://www2.userful.com/products/userful-multiseat-linux\nIt allows you to choose between a fully featured Edubuntu 10.04 installation or to use a stand-alone version to install on a distro of your choice. It has extensive information on how to set up the environment including instructional video's. And since they specifically target the T100/T150 thin clients I'm certain they have managed to include a working USB driver that was missing.\nSo my recommendation would be to either test this software or switch to do a clean install of it's distro version. Considering 10.04 Edubuntu is based on a LTS (Long Term Support) milestone it's a great choice for maturity and stability in an environment with poor means to get service.\n\nA: Ubuntu and Centos now have the driver in the kernel for adding a HP T100/T150 USB connected extra display. I have had success using 2 lengths of 5 meter USB 2.0 cable with a passive USB 2.0 hub in the middle to extend to 32 feet 10\" from server. This is for adding an extra monitor or operating remotely with one user session, not as multi-seat. 2-26-2017\n", "Q: Bash Evaluation I know that in Bash if statements can be evaluated with expr by using:\nif [[ 5 > 0 ]]; then echo true; fi\n\nHow does Bash evaulate the following form of if?\nif [ 5 -gt 0 ]; then echo true; fi\n\n\nA: The first one perform a string lexicographic comparison and is bash only, while the second perform a numeric comparison and works also in POSIX shell.\nThe second one could be better written in bash as\nif ((5 > 0)); then echo \"true\"; fi\n\n", "Q: 32-bit driver on a 64-bit system I have a printer Lexmark X6675.

It is currently my understanding that I need to have X server and a window manager installed in order for opengl programs to function.\nI used the following commands:\nsudo apt-get install xserver-xorg xserver-xorg-core\nsudo apt-get install openbox\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-173\n\nTo test X server I ran xinit which gave me this output:\nX.Org X Server 1.10.4\nRelease Date: 2011-08-19\nX Protocol Version 11, Revision 0\nBuild Operating System: Linux 2.6.24-29-server x86_64 Ubuntu\nCurrent Operating System: Linux maximos-ubuntu 3.0.0-12-server #20-Ubuntu SMP Fri Oct 7 16:36:30 UTC 2011 x86_64\nKernel command line: BOOT_IMAGE=/boot/vmlinuz-3.0.0-12-server root=UUID=ffdf63ee-6980-46dc-bc6d-b1e72e0abcce ro\nBuild Date: 19 October 2011  05:21:26AM\nxorg-server 2:1.10.4-1ubuntu4.2 (For technical support please see http://www.ubuntu.com/support)\nCurrent version of pixman: 0.22.2\n        Before reporting problems, check http://wiki.x.org\n        to make sure that you have the latest version.\nMarkers: (--) probed, (**) from config file, (==) default setting,\n        (++) from command line, (!!) notice, (II) informational,\n        (WW) warning, (EE) error, (NI) not implemented, (??) unknown.\n(==) Log file: \"/var/log/Xorg.0.log\", Time: Tue Dec 27 17:18:18 2011\n(==) Using system config directory \"/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d\"\n(EE) Failed to load module \"nv\" (module does not exist, 0)\nxinit: Unable to run program \"xterm\": No such file or directory\nSpecify a program on the command line or make sure that /usr/bin\nis in your path.\n\nxinit: connection to X server lost\n\nwaiting for X server to shut down  ddxSigGiveUp: Closing log\n\nMy Xorg.0.log:\n[   465.316] \nX.Org X Server 1.10.4\nRelease Date: 2011-08-19\n[   465.316] X Protocol Version 11, Revision 0\n[   465.316] Build Operating System: Linux 2.6.24-29-server x86_64 Ubuntu\n[   465.316] Current Operating System: Linux maximos-ubuntu 3.0.0-12-server #20-Ubuntu SMP Fri Oct 7 16:36:30 UTC 2011 x86_64\n[   465.316] Kernel command line: BOOT_IMAGE=/boot/vmlinuz-3.0.0-12-server root=UUID=ffdf63ee-6980-46dc-bc6d-b1e72e0abcce ro\n[   465.316] Build Date: 19 October 2011  05:21:26AM\n[   465.316] xorg-server 2:1.10.4-1ubuntu4.2 (For technical support please see http://www.ubuntu.com/support) \n[   465.316] Current version of pixman: 0.22.2\n[   465.316]    Before reporting problems, check http://wiki.x.org\n    to make sure that you have the latest version.\n[   465.316] Markers: (--) probed, (**) from config file, (==) default setting,\n    (++) from command line, (!!) notice, (II) informational,\n    (WW) warning, (EE) error, (NI) not implemented, (??) unknown.\n[   465.316] (==) Log file: \"/var/log/Xorg.0.log\", Time: Tue Dec 27 16:53:59 2011\n[   465.316] (==) Using system config directory \"/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d\"\n[   465.317] (==) No Layout section.

I've installed the 11.10 version but it's extremely slow on my laptop, some times it even hangs if I open more than 3 tabs in Firefox. My main problem is that I can't update any of my drivers or even install new ones since this version that I'm using is outdated.\nAt the moment I'm using a freshly installed Ubuntu 9.04 with zero updates because when I installed 11.10 I chose to do a full format over it since I had almost nothing important on my hard disk worth keeping.\n(I remember that when I first installed Ubuntu 9.04 and successfully connected to the internet, everything was easy.)\n\nA: Ubuntu 9.04 Jaunty Jackalope has reached it's end of life. That means that although you can install and use it, there will be no security updates  and such provided. It is advised that you atleast switch to Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid Lynx which is a Long-Term Support version and  the desktop will be supported for three years whereas the Server edition is supported for 5 years. \nIf you are looking for the latest Ubuntu to run on low-performance/old hardware, try taking a look at this question which recommends running the LXDE desktop environment, which is super-lightweight and best suited for old computers. The LXDE version of Ubuntu is called Lubuntu. You can go to the Ubuntu Community Documentation on Lubuntu and getting it to learn more about this.\n\nA: Yes, you can, after all, who's going to stop you. However, it's not recommended, since you don't get any security updates, and, honestly, there is no reason to. You could try a release that's still supported, like Ubuntu 10.04 or Xubuntu 11.10. You could also do a minimal custom installation with only the packages you need. For ideas on the last one see the links below.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/LowMemorySystems\nhttp://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/minimal\n\nA: With all the other disclaimers re: no updates, no security ...\nThere are most old repositories available at http://old-releases.ubuntu.com\nso edit /etc/apt/sources.list and change 'archive.ubuntu.com' to 'old-releases.ubuntu.com'\nYou can do this with sed\nsudo sed -i -e 's/archive.ubuntu.com/old-releases.ubuntu.com/g' /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nthen update with\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nAlternately use a lighter weight distro such as lubuntu, slitaz or tinycore.\nAttention: you should only use the old-release archive if you have no possibility to upgrade to a newer version, because you won't get any security updates using these old archives\n", "Q: Can the font used by Chromium/Chrome in the Tabs be changed to a larger size? I have changed my resolution from 1280x800 to 1776x1000 and adjusted all my fonts accordingly, however the tabs in Chromium look very small, the font is nearly impossible to read also the pixel arrangement of the fonts used in Chromium is horrendous.\nI have downloaded another browser, and the fonts look better than they do in Chromium, but i love Chromium so want to fix the font problem there. How can i do that?.\n\nA: Sadly, no.  The font sizes are hard-coded into Chromium.  Your only hope is to try to get this added as a feature to Chromium, but I find this very unlikely.\n\nA: I filed a new bug at the chrome project and it was marked as a duplicate of this bug.

The last time I've dealt with wireless issues, the most given solution was NDIS wrapper and I seem sorely out-of-date.\n\nA: Looks very much like this bug, flaky on Oneiric and almost never working on Precise.\n\nA: I have been having similar issues lately with a toshiba c655d-s5300.  I reverted to an older kernel at the grub menu, and now it is working.

Basically, I want to move / copy several logical volumes (lv) into a new volume group (vg). The new volume group reside on a new set of physical volumes. Does anyone know how to do that safely without damaging to the data inside those logical volumes??\n\nA: Okay, I was able to handle the situation in my own way. Here are the steps I took:\n1) Take a snapshot of the targeting logical volume.\nlvcreate --snapshot --name <the-name-of-the-snapshot> --size <the size> /dev/volume-group/logical-volume\n\nNote : Size of the snapshot can be as large as or as small as you wish. What matters is having enough space to capture changes during snapshot period.\n\n2) Create an image copy of the snapshot content using dd\ndd if=/dev/volume-group/snapshot-name of=/tmp/backup.img\n3) Create a new logical volume of enough size in the targeting (new) volume group.\nlvcreate --name <logical-volume-name> --size <size> the-new-volume-group-name\n4) Write data to the new logical volume from the image backup using dd\ndd if=/tmp/backup.img of=/dev/new-volume-group/new-logical-volume\n5) delete the snapshot and image backup using lvremove and rm respectively.\nThat's all folks... Hope this helps to someone :)\n\nA: I will offer my own:\numount /somedir/\n\nlvdisplay /dev/vgsource/lv0 --units b\n\nlvcreate -L 12345b -n lv0 vgtarget\n\ndd if=/dev/vgsource/lv0 of=/dev/vgtarget/lv0 bs=1024K conv=noerror,sync status=progress\n\nmount /dev/vgtarget/lv0 /somedir/\n\nif everything is good, remove the source\nlvremove vgsource/lv0\n\n\nA: As of the LVM in Debian stretch (9.0), namely 2.02.168-2, it's\npossible to do a copy of a logical volume across volume groups using a\ncombination of vgmerge, lvconvert, and vgsplit. Since a move is\na combination of a copy and a delete, this will also work for a move.\nAlternatively, you can use pvmove to just move the volume.\nA complete self-contained example session using loop devices and\nlvconvert follows.\nSummary: we create volume group vg1 with logical volume lv1, and vg2\nwith lv2, and make a copy of lv1 in vg2.\nCreate files.\ntruncate pv1 --size 100MB\ntruncate pv2 --size 100MB\n\nSet up loop devices on files.\nlosetup /dev/loop1 pv1\nlosetup /dev/loop2 pv2\n\nCreate physical volumes on loop devices (initialize loop devices for\nuse by LVM).\npvcreate /dev/loop1 /dev/loop2\n\nCreate volume groups vg1 and vg2 on /dev/loop1 and /dev/loop2\nrespectively.\nvgcreate vg1 /dev/loop1\nvgcreate vg2 /dev/loop2\n\nCreate logical volumes lv1 and lv2 on vg1 and vg2 respectively.\nlvcreate -L 10M -n lv1 vg1\nlvcreate -L 10M -n lv2 vg2\n\nCreate ext4 filesystems on lv1 and lv2.\nmkfs.ext4 -j /dev/vg1/lv1\nmkfs.ext4 -j /dev/vg2/lv2\n\nOptionally, write something on lv1 so you can later check the copy was\ncorrectly created. Make vg1 inactive.\nvgchange -a n vg1\n\nRun merge command in test mode. This merges lv1 into lv2.\nvgmerge -A y -l -t -v <<destination-vg>> <<source-vg>>\nvgmerge -A y -l -t -v vg2 vg1\n\nAnd then for real.\nvgmerge -A y -l -v vg2 vg1\n\nThen create a RAID 1 mirror pair from lv1 using lvconvert. The\n<> argument tells lvconvert to make the mirror copy\nlv1_copy on /dev/loop2.\nlvconvert --type raid1 --mirrors 1 <<source-lv>> <<dest-pv>>\nlvconvert --type raid1 --mirrors 1 /dev/vg2/lv1 /dev/loop2\n\nThen split the mirror. The new LV is now lv1_copy.\nlvconvert --splitmirrors 1 --name <<source-lv-copy>> <<source-lv>>\nlvconvert --splitmirrors 1 --name lv1_copy /dev/vg2/lv1\n\nMake vg2 inactive.\nvgchange -a n vg2\n\nThen (testing mode)\nvgsplit -t -v <<source-vg>> <<destination-vg>> <<moved-to-pv>>\nvgsplit -t -v /dev/vg2 /dev/vg1 /dev/loop1\n\nFor real\nvgsplit -v /dev/vg2 /dev/vg1 /dev/loop1\n\nResulting output:\nlvs\n[...]\nlv1        vg1       -wi-a-----  12.00m\nlv1_copy   vg2       -wi-a-----  12.00m\nlv2        vg2       -wi-a-----  12.00m\n\nNOTES:\n1) Most of these commands will need to be run as root.\n2) If there is any duplication of the names of the logical volumes in\nthe two volume groups, vgmerge will refuse to proceed.\n3) On merge:\nLogical volumes in `vg1` must be inactive\n\nAnd on split:\nLogical volume `vg2/lv1` must be inactive.\n\n\nA: The 4 answers so far all miss that the exact size of the volume often is not known. lvdisplay only shows values rounded to 2 decimal places and man lvdisplay only points to other commands for available options. The following selects MiB, which is sufficiently accurate with the default LVM block size of 4 MiB:\nlvdisplay --units m\nMiB is also the default unit for --size of lvcreate. If in doubt, double check the correct size with lvdisplay after creating the target volume. Then go ahead as in the other answers to make a copy. Furthermore, I'd recommend to verify the copy, for example with cmp.\nHere why a snapshot is used and what it protects and doesn't protect:\n\n\n*\n\n*The snapshot is made so that all data is copied as it was at the time the snapshot was created. Activities on the source volume during the copy process will not be reflected in the copy. \n\n*The snapshot also protects the source volume from human errors in the dd command line. If you accidentally write to the snapshot, only the snapshot's data will be damaged and you can simply remove the snapshot and start over.\n\n*The target volume is not protected during the copy processes. If another admin (or an automatic process such as the os-prober of dracut) mounts the incomplete volume, the mount may screw up things. (Even a read-only mount may still write journal entries to the volume.)\n\nA: vgmerge lets you merge two VGs.\nYou can also use pvmove to move data within a VG, and vgsplit if you want to go back to multiple VGs.\n\nA: There is no reason to copy it to a .img file first, just do the lvcreate first, then directly copy it over:\nlvcreate --snapshot --name <the-name-of-the-snapshot> --size <the size> /dev/volume-group/logical-volume\nlvcreate --name <logical-volume-name> --size <size> the-new-volume-group-name\ndd if=/dev/volume-group/snapshot-name of=/dev/new-volume-group/new-logical-volume\n\n\nA: If you need to copy a logical volume from VG A to another VG B, I found a interesting variant using partclone. The snapshot then copy with dd is a good method but might be slow if your file-systems are not full. This solution is very fast because it copy only the used blocks.\n\n\n*\n\n*First create a snapshot of the source LV\n\n\nlvcreate --snapshot --size 1G /dev/sourcevg/lv --name lv-backup\n\nthe --size here is how much write can occur before the snapshot will be disabled\n\n\n*Create the destination LV in the destination VG\n\n\nlvcreate --size <new_lv_size> /dev/destvg --name newlv\n\nnew_lv_size must be at least the size of the source LV\n\n\n*Copy the file-system from source lv backup to destination LV\n\n\npartclone.<fs_type> --dev-to-dev --source /dev/sourcevg/lv-backup --output /dev/destvg/newlv\n\nfs_type can be ext4, fat32, btrfs, xfs, ... any FS supported by partclone\n\n\n*Delete the snapshot\n\n\nlvremove /dev/sourcevg/lv-backup\n\n", "Q: Can I set vim to ftp upload on save? I'm working on a middle size PHP application. I'm currently switching from Netbeans to vim (bc it looks gross on Ubuntu). However, the only thing I do miss from Netbeans is a FTP upload after save.\nMy question is: is there a plugin which automatically uploads on save (or hotkey like ctrl u) in VIM?\n\nA: I can not resist the advice to use ssh (scp / sftp) rather then ftp as I think it is more secure.\nAt any rate, vim will open files or save files over ftp (and scp).\nvim ftp://user@server.com//path/to/file.php\n\nNotice the double // :)\nSee this tutorial for details.\nAt any rate, to save a file you are working on locally over ftp, user Nwrite\nNwrite ftp://user@server/path/to/file.php\n\nYou can map that in vim with \ncmap <Leader>r :Nread ftp://user@server/path/to/file.php\ncmap <Leader>w :Nwrite ftp://user@server/path/to/file.php\n\nLeader is a variable, by default it is /, but you can define it as another key\n:let mapleader = \"+\"\n\nFor details See:\nhttp://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Best_Vim_Tips#FTP_from_Vim\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/1764263/what-is-the-leader-in-a-vimrc-file\n\nA: Take a loot at this\nusing this you can have a local working copy of a file and when you are editing using vim, you can save the minor changes directly to ftp server using upload command like this:\n\n:Upload\n\nyou can make the change to the upload script given in that link,\nBut best way would be to use ssh/scp to tranfer the complete file over the ftp.\nAlso, using a versioning system like SVN or CVS would be better, you can commit the code changes, and those changes will be transferred using ssh. Also a versioning system will give you advanced tools like diff, using which you can compare your code changes to previous version and validate before commiting changes. This would avoid any errors due to typo.\n\nA: The easy way to accomplish that goal does not involve a VIM plugin: simply mount the remote file system instead. In this way, files can be accessed as though they exist locally.\nThis is done via sshfs, if sshfs is available to you. (There is also an FTP filesystem that could work: ftpfs or 'curlftpfs' if you cannot use the excellent fuse/sshfs.)\nSome links for the sshfs option:\n\n\n*\n\n*help.ubuntu.com\n\n*howto.blbosti.com\nBtw, does this NetBeans look gross? (You can get mostly around the problem with Java Swing applications and fonts.) There is also Komodo Edit and Eclipse (Eclipse Helios is good).\n\n", "Q: Connecting to the internet with ubuntu 11.10 I just installed the newest ubuntu, the 11.10 version.

I screwed up using a friend's external HDD and installed Ubuntu on it for my new PC. I can still run it from a disk but I have no idea how to completely wipe the HDD of Ubuntu.

Then remove Linux partitions (including swap), as mentioned before.\nUbuntu Linux replaces MBR record with its own boot loader. If you just delete linux partitions you'll get unbootable drive. To fix it just boot from any DOS or Windows live disk and run fixmbr c:.\n\nA: remove that parition using any disk-formatting tool, im not sure the windows disk-formatting tool will detect ext3/ext4 paritions or not, In that case use any third party disk formatting tools like Partition Magic or Paragon Partition Manager.\n\nA: All you need is Windows7 installation disk, put it in, restart your computer, then set the boot priority from BIOS setting CD or Flash-Drive. \nWhen Win7 installation comes up, choose repair. Then choose repair this computer with recovery tool, click next and choose command prompt. \nEnter this command bootRec.exe /fixmbr and reboot your PC. Go to control panel -> System and Security -> Administrative Tools -> Computer Management -> choose Disk Management (on your left). You will see your computer partitions, delete your UBUNTU SERVER partition by right click -> delete Volume.

It's seriously awesome when it comes to network access. Anything Windows can do, is just a pale shadow in comparison. The master tool is SSH. Using it, you can accomplish anything that you can do on the console from any computer client, be it a mobile phone or a smart tv.

I would like this script to be run as very last of all my start up scripts, how can I achieve this?\n\nA: When your computer starts up, it doesn't run the init.d scripts directly.  Instead, depending on what's called the \"runlevel\", it runs the scripts in /etc/rcN.d (where N is the runlevel).  You can determine the current runlevel with the runlevel command; mine returns 2 in normal operation.  That means that when the computer started up, it ran the scripts in /etc/rc2.d.  The contents of rc2.d are just symlinks to scripts in /etc/init.d, named according to whether they should be started or stopped, and the order they should be run.\nUse the runlevel command to find out what runlevel your computer is at (probably 2), then look in /etc/rc2.d for a link named SNNccpd, which will be a symlink to /etc/init.d/ccpd, and rename it to S99zzzccpd - or whatever it takes to get it to sort after the other entries - that will cause it to run last.\nThere's more information about init.d scripts and runlevels at https://www.linux.com/news/enterprise/systems-management/8116-an-introduction-to-services-runlevels-and-rcd-scripts\n\nA: Rather than putting it as a service which always keeps running, what you can do remove it as a service from /etc/init.d\nand make a script and put it in /root/bin or /usr/local/bin \nInside that script,\n#!/bin/bash sleep 300\n#call your service and run it in background\n/usr/bin/ccpd &\n\nthe startup will continue and your stuff will run after 5 minutes\nNow the last step is to make your script run on startup,\neither add your script to /etc/fstab or to profile\n", "Q: How to bypass the apturl and download the deb file directly? I want to download this game 0A.D. from http://www.playdeb.net/software/0%20A.D. .deb file.  They keep their file up to date with the source code, so they have the newest versions. I don't want apturl to handle it. I just want the deb so I can install in on a machine at home which does not have an internet connection. How can I just download the .deb file it points to. \nIf fact it does not matter what my reason is. I just want to be able to download a file that is manged by apturl. It is easier if all my friends don't have to download the file at the same time to play, I just share it from a shared drive on my machine. \n\nA: apturl isn't obfuscating anything here - the owners of the websites that use it are. All apturl does is take an apt://<package> link and spawn the Software Center for that package. Nothing more, nothing less. It knows nothing about the server, nothing about how to download it.\nIn that vein, there's nothing to be had here. To use [Get/Play]Deb you install their repo and their website just directs the package manager to the right package.\nIf you want to download the packages, you have to use your noggin, remember the package name (not all of it, autocomplete will help you out) and run something like this in a terminal:\napt-get download <package>\n\nThat will download the package to your current directory.\n\nA: I emailed playdeb and this is the response they gave me\n\nto me, GetDeb\nHello,\nyou can download the packages from one of our mirrors,\ne.g.:\nhttp://mirror.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/pub/mirrors/getdeb/ubuntu/pool/games/\nAaron Nel:\nI would like to download the .deb files.

The package details will show up. In the section \"Package files\" you can download the .deb.\n\nA: You can download the .deb files from the PlayDeb apt repository. This is browsable at http://archive.getdeb.net/ubuntu/rpoo. From here you go to the \"0\" directory (because OAD starts with a 0).\nIn this case, it is highly likely that you want both the 0ad and 0ad-data packages. Make sure you get two with the same version number - preferably the version mentioned at the bottom of the game's PlayDeb page.\nSo in this case (assuming Ubuntu 11.04, as that's the latest version PlayDeb has the game for) you want:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://archive.getdeb.net/ubuntu/rpool/games/0/0ad/0ad_0.0.0+r10288~alpha-1~getdeb1_i386.deb\n\n*http://archive.getdeb.net/ubuntu/rpool/games/0/0ad/0ad_0.0.0+r10288~alpha-1~getdeb1_amd64.deb\n\n*http://archive.getdeb.net/ubuntu/rpool/games/0/0ad-data/0ad-data_0.0.0+r10288~alpha-1~getdeb1_all.deb\n(which of the first two you want depends on whether you are running 32 bit or 64 bit Ubuntu)\n\nA: don't forget to first add the getdeb games repository\n   deb http://archive.getdeb.net/ubuntu oneiric-getdeb games \n   wget -q -O- http://archive.getdeb.net/getdeb-archive.key | sudo apt-key add -\n   sudo apt-get update \n\nalso note that this is a different repository then the getdeb for the nongame apps!\nyou can get better instructions from there site\n", "Q: Get a SQLite3 db in LibreOffice (via ODBC). Using Ubuntu 11.04 (64bit) I'm stuck with this. I had SQLite working with OpenOffice in the past. But since then i reinstalled my machine and so... Now I can't get it to work.\ni pretty much followed this guide: http://documentation.openoffice.org/HOW_TO/data_source/SQLite.pdf\nExcept that I changed (with sudo ODBCConfig) the SQLite drivers config to:\nDriver: /usr/lib/odbc/libsqlite3odbc.so \nDriver64: /usr/lib64/odbc/libsqlite3odbc.so \nSetup: /usr/lib/odbc/libsqlite3odbc.so \nSetup64: /usr/lib64/odbc/libsqlite3odbc.so \n\n(Those files exist on my system)\nI also added my database under the User DSN tab.\nWhen I start LibreOffice Base and browse for a ODBC DataSource it turns up empty. I guess this isn't easy to answer without having access to my system. But maybe anyone has an idea? Or some way to debug the connection that I'm not aware of?\nHere are some info about my packages:\n$ dpkg --get-selections | grep odbc\nlibodbcinstq1c2             install\nlibsqliteodbc               install\nodbcinst                    install\nodbcinst1debian2                install\nunixodbc                    install\nunixodbc-bin                install\n\n$ dpkg --get-selections | grep sqlite\nlibaprutil1-dbd-sqlite3         install\nlibmono-sqlite1.0-cil           install\nlibmono-sqlite2.0-cil           install\nlibqt4-sql-sqlite               install\nlibsqlite0                  install\nlibsqlite3-0                install\nlibsqliteodbc               install\nsqlite3                 install\nsqlitebrowser               install\nsqliteman                   install\nsqliteman-doc               install\n\nThanks alot!\n\nA: Please, take a look at this question, there are some tips on how to use SQLite on Ubuntu:\nHow can I install SQLite to be used with OpenOffice?\nAnd here is the official Openoffice guide on using SQLite:\nhttp://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Documentation/How_Tos/Using_SQLite_With_OpenOffice.org\nThis is related to Openoffice, but should work also with Libreoffice.\n\nA: Ok the problem was pretty obvious. I used the command: sudo ODBCConfig to configure the driver (which the odbcsqlite package really seemed to have done for me already).\nAnyway, without restarting ODBCConfig as local user I configured the database under the User DSN tab. As I would expect, if I've just used my brain a little more, the database would then only be shown to user root (I never verified this, but it seems obvious). \nMy solution was to restart ODBCConfig as the local user (i. e. without sudo) and then add the database. Then it worked just fine.\n", "Q: How to let NetworkManager manage WLAN interface after upgrade? I upgraded a Ubuntu system from 11.04 to 11.10 via do-release-uprade.\nNow some things does not work as before.\nFor example now, my user needs to be part of the scanner group to be able to use xsane etc. - with < 11.10 this apparently was not necessary.\nTo be able to use nm-applet again (for wired networking) I needed to add the user to the group netdev after the upgrade.\nBut WLAN management still does not work via NetworkManager - nm-applet just does not display any wireless devices.\nIn the logs there is:\nNetworkManager wlan0 deactivating device reason managed\n\n(inter-punctuation removed)\nBut why it is suddenly managed?\nI checked /etc/network/interfaces and it does not contain any wlan0 entries.\nAnd /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf just contains:\n[main]\nplugins=ifupdown,keyfile\n\n[ifupdown]\nmanaged=true\n\nIs there some other group the user needs to be part of?

You should prefer downloading the alternate cd of the through update-manager.\n\nA: The log message\nNetworkManager wlan0 deactivating device reason managed\n\nsent me on a wrong route. Managed or unmanaged devices are not the problem.\nAnother thing that can go wrong (besides not being part of the right group or managed device issues) is a DBus permission problem.\nOne can check this via starting nm-applet from a xterm, in case there is a permission problem you get a lot of Rejected send messages like this:\n$ nm-applet\n** (nm-applet:25178): WARNING **: _nm_object_get_property: Error getting 'WirelessHardwareEnabled' for /org/freedesktop/NetworkManager: (9) Rejected send message, 2 matched rules; type=\"method_call\", sender=\":1.1698\" (uid=SOMEUID pid=SOMEPID comm=\"nm-applet \") interface=\"org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties\" member=\"Get\" error name=\"(unset)\" requested_reply=\"0\" destination=\"org.freedesktop.NetworkManager\" (uid=0 pid=OTHERPID comm=\"NetworkManager \")\n\nWell, nm-applet seems to be really great at reporting such errors to the user ... via it'ts GUI ... NOT!\n(Ok, nm-applet also fails to report that a user is not part of the netdev group ...)\nIt seems to have something to do with ConsoleKit. It seems that nm-applet needs an ConsoleKit-Session that has active = TRUE.\nYou can check your ConsoleKit-session via:\n$ ck-list-sessions\n\nOn my system the output was:\n$ ck-list-sessions | grep active\n    active = FALSE\n    active = FALSE\n    active = FALSE\n\nTo test if this really the problem you can call nm-applet like this from a xterm:\n$ ck-launch-session nm-applet\n\nThen you should not get Rejected send 'Warning' messages any more and nm-applet should work as expected.\nThis workaround probably breaks other ConsoleKit related stuff - the real fix probably would be to fix ConsoleKit-session-setup via the display manager or something like that.\nNote that ConsoleKit is also kind of unmaintained and is probably replaced in the near future by a Systemd based solution ...\nEdit: See also my answer to a related console kit setup problem. Depending on your X11 startup method you need to workaround ConsoleKit changes such that you get an active session - depending on your ConsoleKit version and system just calling ck-launch-session might not be enough.\n", "Q: Unable to record sound from web browser (firefox / chromium ) using recordmydesktop I have to do some screencast tutorials and i am using recordmydesktop with gtk frontend to do it.\nI need to record also the sound and here is where i have found the problem.\nIt took me some time, but now I can record the sound from almost every application in my desktop ... almost.\nI need to capture some sound from a web application using java, but when i load the page nothing appears in the playback tab of pavucontrol.

First, just to reformat for readability, this is your PATH\n\nPATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games\n\nThese are your env vars:\n\nexport JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/jdk1.6.25/\nexport M2_HOME=/usr/local/apache-maven/apache-maven-3.0.3\nexport M2=$M2_HOME/bin\nexport PATH=$M2:$PATH\n\nNote that \"java\" (the program) is in $JAVA_HOME/bin, not $JAVA_HOME.

From the mvn shell script launcher, \n\nif [ -z \"$JAVA_HOME\" ] ; then\n  echo \"Warning: JAVA_HOME environment variable is not set.\"\nfi\n\nThis would imply the var really isn't set -- not merely set to a wrong value. Perhaps this is the key hint:\n\n[my java_home ...] even though it exists in my environment file?\n\nPerhaps you added/modified JAVA_HOME to .bashrc or .profile , and then in the same shell tried to run mvn -v ??  If so, these values won't be picked up until you source the file (e.g., . ~/.bashrc ) or create a new login shell (bash -l) in order for these env var's to be set (or reset).\n(Also... it's just a matter of opinion, but in your PATH, I'd leave the standard /usr/bin (and /usr/sbin and /bin) in front of any /usr/local/bin or /opt/bin (etc), just to avoid any rouge 'local' programs taking precedence over the standard programs... using something like alternatives would be preferable to override the default versions of standard applications.)\n", "Q: Ubuntu shows a grey error dialog message on load when I enter password when I boot up my Ubuntu VM I get - \"could not connect to session bus: //bin/dbus-launch terminated abnormally without any error message\"\nDoes anyone know how to fix this, or even diagnose it?

How can i find out whats taking so long to load?\nIm using 11.10 x64\n\nA: I was going to suggest Bootchart but I feel like it might stop logging at login.\nNetworking and sshd come up well before the desktop so you might be able to SSH in from another device and run htop (or top if you don't have htop installed) so you can see what is nomming on the CPU.\nYou've got (over) 15 seconds to inspect things - so that should be enough.\nIf you don't have another computer/phone you can SSH in from, you might even be able to switch to a TTY (ControlAltF1) and run htop (et al) from there while you desktop loads. It'll be harder to do but should render a similar effect.\n", "Q: Wine sound problems Wine 1.3.25 changed the way sound works in Wine. As OMG! Ubuntu! reported:\n\nWine 1.3.25 (...) saw a ‘total rewrite of audio support’ and the removal of several audio drivers. The result is breakage of audio support for Wine apps through PulseAudio – Ubuntu’s default sound server.\n\n— http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/07/latest-wine-update-breaks-pulseaudio/\nSo I have tried to avoid the problem by using PlayOnLinux to set an older Wine version for every application on a different wineprefix. But there are some applications that work much better on more recent versions, or simply won't run on wine <1.3.25.\nSo I had to upgrade. And that's when audio problems started. Some examples:\n\n\n*\n\n*RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 (demo) audio sounds in a terrible way I don't know how to describe (rough? jagged? I can try to record it if you want), and then after a few seconds it stops altogether, even after executing winetricks quartz.\n\n*The World in Conflict demo has a similar problem, though in this case sound lasts a little longer. The game is rated Platinum on AppDB for Wine 1.3.20, though, so in this case I can just downgrade that specific prefix. But this is not always the case.\nEDIT: Found a workaround. See comments.\n\n*Sound in videos in the Steam client either doesn't work or sounds just like World in Conflict.\n\n*Portal just doesn't want to work. Audio stops working when you get to the main menu. If you're lucky, after restarting it several times it works for some time, but then it randomly stops working again, forcing the player to quit the game. It has a Platinum rating on AppDB for version 1.3.35 on Arch, but only Bronze on Ubuntu on 1.3.34 because of the sound issues.\n\n*Portal 2 is like Portal, but even worse: when you get past the main menu, it stops working after a few seconds.\n\n\nSome of these may be normal Wine bugs, but since the first three are so similar and all these problems seem to affect Ubuntu only, this problem has to be caused by that 'total rewrite of audio support' in Wine 1.3.35.\nI have read lots of Ask Ubuntu questions and things posted on other websites, but nothing I have tried has solved my problems so far. Killing pulseaudio just makes the sound indicator disappear for a second, until pulseaudio is automatically restarted. Disabling it for wine doesn't work either: running\npasuspender -- winecfg\nand clicking on the test audio button just makes the Wine window \"go dark\".\nSo, is there any way to fix this?\nEdit: getting the debs from this place (from the Launchpad bug tells me it has unmet dependencies, and if I try to install that dependency, Synaptic tells me it has to remove a whole lot of packages! Not willing to do that.\n\nA: Comment converted to answer from OP\nFurther testing has revealed a possible solution: deleting the registry key under HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Wine/Drivers and creating an \"Audio\" string in Drivers with value \"alsa\". This fixes sound problems on Steam videos and makes World In Conflict work like Portal. However, it doesn't affect RollerCoaster Tycoon and some other apps. Is this just a regular wine bug or an ubuntu/pulseaudio specific problem?\n", "Q: Live CD doesn't boot properly when trying to install I'm to install ubuntu 11.10, but when I boot with ubuntu CD and go into \"install ubuntu\" or \"try ubuntu\" it just shows the background and doesn't do anything from there. Other people say that I should get a normal desktop with icons and taskbars, but well, mine doesn't show anything.\nI can't even open the terminal, or any other hot keys. I've tried burning the CD 4 times, all different ways in different programs, and it still doesn't work. How can I install it?\n\nA: First, confirm the integrity of your iso and cd.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/VerifyIsoHowto\nSpecifically, check the md5sum of the iso\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM\nThen, when you boot, hit the up arrows. You will get the old style boot menu:\n\nChoose \"Install Ubuntu\"\nIf that fails, you can try the alternate CD which has a more robust installer.\nThe concern I have , however, is that if the live CD does not work, then we probably need to debug your hardware, otherwise the install may fail in a similar way.\n", "Q: How to create a scope? I'd like to create a custom scope that searches and returns results from an online source for personal use.\nIs this possible?

When I run the ls -l command I get details about the files in the current directory like permissions, owner, group, file size.  \nIs there a way I can get these same details instead of just the location of the file when I run locate?\n\nA: The locate database do not contain information other that names, so you should run some other tool, like ls, on locate output\nlsloc() {\n  locate \"$@\" | \n    while read -r name; do\n      ls -ld \"$name\"\n    done\n}\nlsloc pattern\n\n\nA: Pipe the output of locate to xargs (adding ls -l as parameters to xargs).  This lets you use whatever options you need with either command.  By also passing the -0 (dash-zero) option to both commands, you also protect against unintended interpretations of blanks or newlines in filenames.  For example, to get the details of all .iso files on my system:\nlocate -0 -r '.*.iso$' | xargs -0 ls -l\n\n\nA: Use a subshell\nls -l \"`locate -b 'search_pattern'`\"\n\nOr\nls -lh \"$(locate -b 'search_pattern')\"\n\nYou can add a function to ~/.bashrc if you wish\nfunction lsloc () { ls -l \"$(locate -b \"$1\") ;}\n\nYou then \nlsloc \"search pattern\"\n\n", "Q: Prerequisities to installing OpenLDAP on a clean Ubuntu 11.10 Server install I have just installed a fresh install of Ubuntu 11.10 Server and would like to setup an LDAP server.

I'm writing a shell script that brings up an Ethernet interface (configured for DHCP) to determine whether it's connected to a network. If it isn't, I'd like to be able to report in a timely manner (within a few seconds) that there's no connection. Unfortunately, in the absence of a connection, ifup seems to wait several minutes before timing out, and the man page doesn't mention a timeout parameter. Is there any way to stop it after a few seconds?\nThis is on Ubuntu Server 11.10; NetworkManager is not in use.\n\nA: You did not say what you are using for a notification.\n[[ -n \"$(ifconfig | grep '192.*' )\" ]] || echo \"down\"\n\nChange \"192\" to the prefix of your network (192.168.x.y is most common).\nChange \"echo \"down\"\" to your notification.\nRun that command from cron with some reasonable interval.\nPerhaps something along the lines of\n[[ -n \"$(ifconfig | grep '192.*' )\" ]] || dhclient eth0\n\nrun once a minute or so ?\n\nA: I finally found a way.\nAs it turns out, since what I really want to do is check for link, I don't need ifup at all. Instead, I can use ethtool (though it has to be installed first), like so:\nconnected=$(ethtool eth0 | awk '/Link detected:/ { print $3 }')\n\nIf, however, I did need to check ifup, I could use a background process and the $! shell variable. If I just wanted to check whether it was still running after the timeout, I could do this:\nifup eth0 &\nsleep 5\nif ps -p $! | grep -q \"$!\"; then\n    connected='no'\n    kill $!\nelse\n    connected='yes'\nfi\n\nIf I wanted to capture the output from ifup, my best bet would probably be to redirect it to a temporary file.

Desktop windows are special windows that have no window decorations; are always visible on your desktop; do not appear in your pager or taskbar; and are sticky across all workspaces. Panel windows reserve space along a desktop edge, just like panels and taskbars, preventing maximized windows from overlapping them. The edge is chosen based on the alignment option. Override windows are not under the control of the window manager. Hints are ignored. This type of window can be useful for certain situations. \n\nI think yes, Conky can be tuned for using with ccsm.\n", "Q: Is there a way to get the Innotab Learning Lodge Navigator software working?

But equally clearly something is awry in the disk configuration. Sadly, I don't really know where to start.\nI did read the man page for dmraid, and I thought that the -x option was what I needed. However:\n$ sudo dmraid -x\nAbout to delete RAID set pdc_beidbcaig\nWARNING: The metadata stored on the raidset(s) will not be \n  accessible after deletion\nDo you want to continue ? [y/n] :y\nERROR: Raid set deletion is not supported in \"pdc\" format\n\nIn summary, what steps should I take to ensure that my two previously mirrored RAID-1 disks become two separate independent drives, one of which I can reformat to store more data on?\nThanks!\n\nA: OK, I found some helpful information in this thread. In particular, doing\nsudo dmraid -rE\n\nwas helpful, though I had to manually patch /etc/fstab after that, reasonably enough. Still not sure that I've covered everything though, and I'd be happy to have an explanation of what dmraid does. Magic incantations to \"make it all better\" are OK, but I'd rather understand what I'm doing, at least in broad terms! \n\nA: Interesting, I think I learned something new about dmraid today. Software RAID in general is predicated on the concept of inserting metadata onto the disk somewhere and then taking over those disks with a special driver and presenting it as a new virtual disk with a superset of new features.\nUsually, if you were to remove the meta data, the actual stored data becomes lost, or at least the roadmap to it does. Consider a RAID 5 where data is spread around several disks, traditionally you can only mount a single disk, which was the RAID5 you just destroyed, therefore, no mapping exists to access your data.\nI think you hit the trivial case of dmraid de-provisioning, since RAID1 is really a pure mirror of the other drive, the positions of your data and partition tables make sense. Now that the metadata is gone thanks to dmraid -E, the dmraid driver no longer has a reason to claim the disks and assemble the RAID, so you should never see those /dev/mapper entries again.\nReconfiguring your fstab was a necessary part of the migration, also, had you used filesystem labels instead of mount points, no fstab changes would have been necessary.\nI don't know that this is part of dmraid design or not, either way I know I would never count on that feature with my data. I wouldn't expect MD to operate this way. I think you got very lucky and that next time you should backup all your data before you reconfigure your drives in an invasive manner.\n", "Q: Creating custom updates for my users? I'm looking for a secure and flexible way of pushing custom updates to my users' Ubuntu 11.10 x64 machines.  \nI'm looking to push updates that will run scripts for adding new software, adjusting settings, etc etc etc..basically any changes I'd like to make to an Ubuntu machine, only on all of my users' systems.  Of course I'd also like to control if/when these systems get the usual Ubuntu updates.\nThere's lots of info out there on setting up repos for updating a particular app; hoping someone could point me in the right direction for best methods of updating/reconfiguring Ubuntu systems and applications overall.  Many thanks!\nEDIT:  Already aware of Landscape, and while very well suited for my needs it's out of our (non-existant) budget.\n\nA: You're asking a really open ended question but here goes, you're probably looking for configuration management. Ubuntu includes Puppet for this purpose, though there are other tools such as Chef that are also available.\nSince you're not asking a specific question, I can point you to the quick start documents for Puppet:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://docs.puppetlabs.com/\nThe quick answer here is you have a machine called a \"puppetmaster\" and then you'll install the puppet client on all the machines you want to manage. The machines will check in periodically and execute whatever recipes they're told to execute that you write and put on the puppetmaster. \nThis can be anything from installing packages to running customized scripts, it's really up to you to decide how you want to use it. \nAfter you've picked a tool feel free to just ask specific questions here, you'll find activity in the puppet tag. \n", "Q: How to get Office 2010 (specifically Outlook) to run? Although there are many alternatives out there, I'm not prepared to get away from Outlook yet, and I have many clients I'd like to switch over to Ubuntu but they need Outlook and won't switch because of this one thing holding them back.\nCurrently I have Ubuntu 11.10, Wine 1.3.35 and PlayOnLinux 4.0.14\nI tried to get Wine 1.3.9 which apparently supports Office 2010 but I can't get that to install either.  Not sure if it's a waste of time, but that's a separate question if it's a path worth going down.\nOffice 2010 starts install with PlayOnLinux no problem but half way through fails with the following error:\n1: 25541 2: -2147024786 3:\nC:\\windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v2.0.50727\\CONFIG\\machine.config\n\nI'm thinking I have to install .NET framework separately first but I don't want to mindlessly install all kinds of software and makes things worse.  I appreciate any advice on this so I can help promote this awesome operating system.\n\nA: The 32-bit version of Microsoft Office should be installable through Wine, as they refer in their site in Ubuntu 11.10; so please follow their instruction and be sure you have a version of Wine above 1.3.35. There is also a trick to solve your problem about the file machine.config.\nhttp://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=17336\n\nA: All windows MS Office apps will install and work on Ubuntu if you use Crossover.  Outlook does have some issues IF you, like me wish to use gmail and IMAP.  This is because of the TSL and SSL security it, gmail, requires.  STUNNEL(4) is supposed to resolve these problems as it acts as a middleware server, but I have yet to make it work.\nSo, yes, I have mine up and running, but as I use gmail and IMAP I can not get it to sync on inbox.\n", "Q: I want to create the partitions in filesystem. is that possible? I have installed Ubuntu 10.04 recently. I mean today! And I want my FileSystem (80GB) to be divided into three part just like windows do! Is that possible? If yes Please help me!\n\nA: Yes it is possible to partition your hard disk in three partitions. You will need to boot using ubuntu live cd and run Gparted from there. You can find it at System->Administration->Gparted. Using it you can resize your current partition and then create two new partitions in the space that frees up.\nBut you should understand that it wont be like Windows. Windows has separate directory trees for each partition but Linux/Ubuntu has one directory tree and your new partition will still be part of that. You may not notice it as long as you are using GUI as you will get drive icons on the desktop and in Places menu but if you use command line then you should understand this.\n\nA: Yes it can be done. But you need a live-cd for this. Login using live-cd then do the rest of the work.\nhttp://www.howtoforge.com/linux_resizing_ext3_partitions\nOR\nYou can also resize partition using gparted.\nGenerally Data will not loss but backup your files[home,Desktop, etc which are in filesystem] for security.\nAfter resize the partition update your grub.\nhttp://shantanucse.blogspot.com/2011/10/how-to-recover-ubuntu-904-or-higher.html\n", "Q: How to open a file with .3 extension?

(ie. it was random after boot) \nBasically what happened was that when I changed the password the illegal timestamp got updated to /etc/shadow. After that one could not use that account to login or change its password.

So please double check that the settings in PAM module are correct.\nSee: man pam_chauthtok\n\nPAM_AUTHTOK_ERR: A module was unable to obtain the new authentication token.\n\n\nSometimes this error may happen when changing password for a user which didn't have the current password set yet and passwd still asks for it, so the workaround is to force the change by adding sudo, e.g.: sudo passwd $USER.\n\nA: Also make sure you are mounting the file system read/write. \nAfter immediately selecting 'Drop into root shell prompt' I found the filesystem was mounted read only, which prevents resetting the password. \nChoosing the option to remount / as read/write and going back into the root shell prompt enabled the password change.\nThe command to run prior to changing the password is: mount -rw -o remount /\n\nA: I'm not sure how it happened. A sudo user created my account then deleted it then created it again.\nHere is what I found\nmount -o remount,rw /\npasswd\npasswd: Authentication token manipulation error\n\nNo change.\nsudo pwck\n\nShowed no errors.\nsudo grpck\n\nShowed no errors.\nls -l /etc/passwd /etc/group /etc/shadow /etc/shadow-\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    767 May  7 16:45 /etc/group\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1380 May  7 16:45 /etc/passwd\n-rw-r----- 1 root shadow 1025 May  8 09:11 /etc/shadow\n-rw------- 1 root root   1025 May  7 16:46 /etc/shadow-\n\nLooks normal.\nsudo cat /etc/shadow |grep oracle\noracle:$6$FsPqyplr$DrIvjFDSx0ipHmECMw1AU5hTrbNMnnkGRdFlaQcM.p3Rdu2OLjY20tzUTW61HlFH16cal56rKlLuW4j2mK9D.:15833:0:99999:7:::\n\nShowed user and encrypted password.\nsudo cat /etc/shadow- |grep oracle\n\nShowed nothing.

Before double clicking if I looked at View > Extended Information (EXIF) it showed correctly, but after jpeg is generated, there is no EXIF data available, so one has to open the file browser and navigate to the original NEF photo in order to look at the EXIF data.\nIs there a way to program (am I missing something?) shotwell to retrieve the EXIF from the NEF files after the jpegs are generated?\n\nA: First see if this bug is affecting you, where Shotwell is using the small embedded jpeg from the NEF instead of the paired (higher-resolution) jpeg. Are the these jpeg files very low quality?  \nIf not, check that you have Shotwell set to write metadata to files in Edit/Preferences like this:  \n\n", "Q: Does apt-get automatically check digital signatures?

You are trusting the developer who uploaded the source package, who of course, can not thoroughly review all of the upstream code, so you are also trusting all of the upstream open source contributors.\n", "Q: can apt do everthing dpkg can? As I understand things apt uses dpkg are there any operations that you can do with dpkg that can't be done with apt? as a new User to Ubuntu server do I need to learn anything about dpkg?\n\nA: apt and dpkg perform different but orthogonal tasks.  dpkg keeps track of what packages are currently installed, and can install or remove them.  apt keeps track of what packages are available and can do things like download a package ( and its dependencies ) and hand them to dpkg to install, or check if there are newer versions of the packages you have installed, download them, and hand them to dpkg to install.\nIn other words, dpkg handles the low level package management, and apt builds on top of it by adding the concept of an archive that contains packages that you may want to download and install.\n\nA: AFAIK, apt can't be used to install a package from a .deb file; you’d have to use dpkg -i for that.  \nOtherwise, don’t worry about it.  If you know your way around apt, by all means use that.\nIf you run into limitations of apt, at least you’ll already know to look into dpkg.  :-)\n\nA: In short, dpkg can do much more than apt-*.\nUbuntu and other Debian derivatives rely on the *.deb package infrastructure.\ndpkg\ndpkg is the application that handles the packaging tasks of applications bundled in the *.deb files.  You can do anything with it that apt can do, at a lower level.  You can search, obtain information, view the files, extract, install, remove, configure, etc. with it.\ndselect\ndselect is a curses (terminal gui) frontend for dpkg.\napt\nApt is the Advanced Packaging Tool.  With it you can automate a number of steps you would need to do by hand to obtain the results with dpkg.  Apt works with the *.deb packages found in repositories to the point that you may not even know the files are there.\naptitude\naptitude is a curses (terminal gui) frontend for apt-*.\nsynaptic\nsynaptic is a gtk+ (desktop gui) frontend apt-*.\nNotable usage for dpkg:\ndpkg -c - Shows the contents of a deb package.\ndpkg -i - Installs a deb package.\ndpkg -s - Shows information about the installed package.\ndpkg --reconfigure - Runs the configuration dialogs that you saw when installing the package.\nNotable usage for apt-get:\napt-get install - Installs a package from your configured repositories.\napt-get remove - Uninstalls a package.\napt-get update - Updates your cache of packages within your repositories.\napt-get upgrade - Upgrades your installed packages if applicable.\napt-get dist-upgrade - Used to migrate to the latest distribution release.\napt-get autoremove - Uninstalls packages that were not explicitly installed and are not needed.\nNotable usage for apt-cache:\napt-cache search - Searches to see if a specified package is available in your repositories.\napt-cache stats - Gives statistics on repositories in cache.\n", "Q: Samba: Cannot see Shared folders i'm trying to connect my laptop to pc thorugh LAN (both are ubuntu) because i need to grab some data there. the problem is when i browse network section in nautilus i cannot see folder list that i already set on that desktop, but instead all i see is my own shares folder in this laptop. is it because my laptop and desktop shares the same name ' james ' or? \nim looking forward for your answers and help... thanks! \n\nA: Your laptop and desktop do indeed need a different name if you want to access shares through SMB.\n", "Q: Thunderbird does not show Calendar I do not see Calendar tab in Thunderbird at all.\nI tried v8 and v10 beta but same issue.

I highly recommend if you are new to Ubuntu that you start there. You can also install \"Synaptic package manager\" and install applications that way.\n\nA: You shoul install software from Ubuntu Software Center. It's easier and more straigth forward. There is also an online app site here\n", "Q: How can I run Turbo C++? How can I use Windows apps like Turbo C++ on Ubuntu? Wine says \"not applicable on your PC\", or something like that.\nI need to specifically use Turbo C++ on Ubuntu for my coursework.\n\nA: Have a look at these questions, there are many great tools for programming described:\n\nWhat developer text editors are available for Ubuntu?\nWhat IDEs are available for Ubuntu?\n\nI hope you will find there something that suits your needs! :)\n\nA: If you're making a larger program, it might be helpful to use CMake.  This will let you use some simple scripting of CMake which will let you generate a solution for your C++ project.  CMake can generate solutions for Visual Studio, Codeblocks, and other IDE systems.  It is also cross-platform which will allow you to work and develop the code on any operating system you use.\n\nA: Use command line, gcc is the best, it helps you learn programming and debugging.\nUse an editor like gedit, save the file then compile using command line.\n\nA: You can use an editor like QtCreator or NetBeans. Turbo C++ doesn't have a lot of non standard libraries so you should be Ok using QtCreator or NetBeans with the GCC compiler instead of Turbo C++ compiler. Sure, if you need libraries like: graphics.h or conio.h you would not find them on Linux and I don't recommend you to get used to this libraries, you will have hard time when you will get out to the real world...\nAnd don't listen to people that tell you that you should not use IDE's if you want to be a better programmer, that's just plain stupid. IDE's don't write code for you, they just make it easier for you to refactor your code and to read it easier(and a few more features that anyway don't write code for you)...\nAnyway, if you want that much to run or test your programs on Windows(in a Linux machine) and only if you have a pretty powerful computer, you can use a virtual machine like: VirtualBox or VMWare Player.\nFor example, when I have to write Oracle SQL PL/SQL Procedures I run Windows in VirtualBox with Seamless Mode activated and it works pretty well for me...\n\nA: I would suggest using Clang or GCC instead. Much more modern and current than Turbo C++, and can run natively on Linux.\nClang in particular is a pleasure to use if you are studying either C or C++ since it's error messages and warnings are much easier to understand.\nInstall with sudo apt-get install build-essential clang\n", "Q: How to tell Xubuntu not to clone but to expand the laptop display to the external one?

Then choose display.\nWe will declare wich one is the main monitor and check active the second monitor.\nThe \"X\" value of the second monitor will be the end of the size of the main monitor. It can know in the resolution.\nThen if, for example, I have a netbook with 1024x600 resolution monitor, I have to tell that the second monitor begin in 1024 (\"X\" value), writing it in the \"X\" value of the \"X\" position field of the second monitor.\nYou have to exit your session an log in again to take effect.\nSee the image below!\n\n\nA: Use the graphic interface of xrandr, called grandr.

However, I had a problem with bottom menu (it was impossible to open it, because bottom of the screen was \"below\" the physical display) and I was not satisfied with the \"automatization\" level of that solution too, so I wrote a Python script to solve my problem and - in general - make it easier to switch to dual-display mode:\n    ./displaymanager.py -m dual -i \"LVDS1;1366x768;60\" -e \"HDMI1;1920x1080;60\"\n\nand back to single display, with one command:\n    ./displaymanager.py -m single -i \"LVDS1;1366x768;60\" -e \"HDMI1\"\n\nIt puts external display to the right by default - to put it to the left use argument:\n    -o \"ei\"\n\nYou can bind both commands to - i.e. - menu items (activators?) to use it in a comfortable way.\nI'm still working on some little fixes to make in more general in use.\nYou can find it on https://github.com/regispl/displaymanager + short README\nI hope it will help someone ;)\n\nA: For people looking to save the xrandr dual head settings for future logins, simply make the script above executable with\nchmod +x dual_monitor.sh\nThen go to the xfce panel menu at Settings > Settings manager > Session and startup > Application autostart.\nThen add the executable script to the list.

They tend to deal with thousands of laptops so might not want to help, but they're probably your best bet because of the volume they deal with.\nAnd finally, it might be worth having a word with the people who made the laptop.

How can I get 1920x1080 on the tv?\nI have a 1080p tv.\n\nA: I very much doubt that particular GPU can output video at 1920x1080, after all, it's about 9 years old. \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Intel_chipsets\nI'd be surprised if it could drive even one display with a resolution higher then 1024x768 without freezing, let alone an HD TV. If you are interested in what it can do, run xrandr in a terminal window.\n\nA: I have the same chipset on my laptop with a VGA output.\nIn lucid the graphics drivers for this chipset were awful - it barely managed 1024x768 at a decent FPS rate.  When I connected it to my HD tv it managed 1280x768 (i.e. widescreen) but the FPS rate was shockingly low.\nThings somewhat improved with the Natty kernel (available in the software repositories) - from the community wiki:\n\nA few months Canonical has backported kernel version 2.6.38 from Ubuntu 11.04 and version 3.0 from Ubuntu 11.10. Both versions include\n  the bugfix for the 855GM-problem. It is strongly advised to use one of\n  these kernel versions because the 855GM-PPA was deactivated some time\n  ago.\n\nAgain I managed 1280x768 with a slightly better refresh rate.\nA word of warning - take an drive-image backup if you intend to use the newer kernel.  It took me a few attempts to get things working - for me I used Stefan Glasenhard PPA (as described in the link) and the Natty kernel to get a stable configuration.\nThe figures you have been quoted by Intel themselves are theoretical - you will not be able to achieve this on linux with the state of the graphics drivers.  Intel themselves are no longer supporting i8xx - the support for i8xx under 12.04 is not known - but given that only VESA support was available in Natty and Oneiric and dont hold out much hope.\n", "Q: How to launch Thunderbird when Ubuntu 11.10 starts? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I make a program auto-start everytime I log in? \n\nI would like to configure Thunderbird to starts when the session starts, but I don't know how!\nThx!\n\nA: This question was already posted here in AskUbuntu:\nHow do I make a program auto-start every time I log in?\nHere is another link from the Ubuntu official guide:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/AddingProgramToSessionStartup\n\nA: I have found that the answer is to add the command line to the System launcher at boot (System->Preferences->Applications at Startup).

You'll see this code:\nvoid ListBoxX::SetFont(Font &scint_font) {\n    // Only do for Pango font as there have been crashes for GDK fonts\n    if (Created() && PFont(scint_font)->pfd) {\n        // Current font is Pango font\n        gtk_widget_modify_font(PWidget(list), PFont(scint_font)->pfd);\n    }\n}\n\nReplace it with:\nvoid ListBoxX::SetFont(Font &scint_font) {\n    // Only do for Pango font as there have been crashes for GDK fonts\n    if (Created() && PFont(scint_font)->pfd) {\n        // Current font is Pango font\n        PangoFontDescription* pf = pango_font_description_from_string(\"Sans 6\");\n        gtk_widget_modify_font(PWidget(list), pf);\n    }\n}\n\nObviously you can change the 'Sans 6' to be whatever font and size you like. This is a very hacky solution, however I don't know C/C++ so perhaps there's a more elegant way to do it.\nThen you can either:\n./configure && make && sudo make install\n\nTo do a quick compile and install (would seriously advise removing the existing geany package first though)\nOr the more correct way:\nsudo aptitude install build-essential devscripts ubuntu-dev-tools \\\ndebhelper dh-make diff patch cdbs quilt gnupg fakeroot lintian \\\npbuilder piuparts intltool chrpath\n\ndebuild\ncd ..\nsudo dpkg -i geany_0.20-1.1ubuntu1_amd64.deb\n\nTo build a new package including the changes and then install it.\n", "Q: GDM doesn't start and desktop looks weird after reinstalling GNOME and the Nvidia driver So, there was a problem before with display so i reinstall gnome and nvidia graphic driver;\nIt seems like the gdm wasn't reinstalled properly as ubuntu doesn't start;\nIt holds at this moment:\n\nThe gnome GUI doesn't load correctly as well.

We are using our own repository for Ubuntu packages, and I need a way to check if the repository is really used on each workstation. I can use apt-cache policy|grep 'our-repository-address', but some of my colleagues don't like it because of \"grep\". It looks like an unreliable hack to them... Is there other way for this check or apt-cache policy|grep 'our-repository-address' is quite standard?\n\nA: You have to check each package provided by repository individually.\nIf package is only a local rebuild and version string is the same as in another repository you have to check manually md5sums in /var/lib/dpkg/info/PACKAGE.md5sums (if package does not compile anything and repository structures don't differ there is no way to clarify origin).\nIf version strings differ you can use following code snippet:\n#!/usr/bin/python\n# Check original repository of installed packages from list.\n# Usage: script PACKAGELIST\n\nimport apt\nimport sys\nimport re\n\n# set values for local repository\ncomponent = \"main\"\narchive = \"experimental\"\norigin = \"Debian\"\nlabel = \"Debian\"\nsite = \"ftp.debian.org\"\n\ndef main():\n  try:\n    pkglist = []\n    f = open(sys.argv[1], \"r\")\n    for line in f:\n      if re.match('^Package: ', line):\n        pkglist.append(re.sub('^Package: ', '', line).rstrip('\\n'))\n    f.close()\n\n    cache = apt.Cache()\n    for package in pkglist:\n      pkg = cache[package]\n\n      # check if package is installed\n      if not pkg.installed:\n        continue\n\n      if pkg.installed.origins[0].component != component or \\\n          pkg.installed.origins[0].archive != archive or \\\n          pkg.installed.origins[0].origin != origin or \\\n          pkg.installed.origins[0].label != label or \\\n          pkg.installed.origins[0].site != site:\n        print package\n        #continue\n      #else:\n      #  print package + \" is in repo.\"\n\n  except KeyboardInterrupt:\n    print \"\\nShutdown requested...exiting\"\n  except Exception, e:\n    sys.stderr.write(\"An unecpected exeption was encountered: %s\" % str(e) + \"\\n\")\n    sys.exit(1)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n  main()\n\nUsage is script PACKAGELIST e.g.:\nscript /var/lib/apt/lists/ftp.debian.org_debian_dists_experimental_main_binary-amd64_Packages\n\nYou also have to adjust component, archive, ... for your local archive (see related Release file under /var/lib/apt/lists).\nIf package is installed but not from your repository you get package name - everything is fine if not.\n\nA: I assume that, you already know the fact that, If you want your repository being used instead of the default Ubuntu repository, You should put your's repo line on the top of /etc/sources.list file.

Then in /etc/conf.d/dm-crypt (might be crypttab or something similar), you have to use the default urandom dmcrypt stuff at boot by adding these lines to the file:\nswap=crypt-swap\ntarget='/dev/sd*'\n\nAt least that's how I did it in Sabayon. Also if its acting up when you're booting and throwing you some random error about LUKS partitions, press e at the GRUB boot menu and remove \"crypt_swap=/dev/sda5\" from the kernel parameter line.\nI'm a noob so don't blindly listen to me, but this is how I got where I am now.\n\nA: Did you make a swap partition when you installed ? You can list your partitions with fdisk or graphically with gparted.\nIf not, then you would need to make a swap partition. You can do this with gparted from a live CD.\nList your partitions with blkid\nYou then edit /etc/fstab and add in your swap partition. An entry would look like\nUUID=xxx.yyy.zzz swap swap default 0 0\n\nSee: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq#How_do_I_add_more_swap.3F\nhttp://tldp.org/HOWTO/Partition/setting_up_swap.html\nIf you feel you need an encrypted swap, IMO, it is easiest to install from the alternate CD as it will set up the encryption for you.\n\nA: OP posted a solution that worked in the comments\n\nI kinda got tried of fooling with it and just turned it into a normal swap instead of the encrypted swap. Looks like it's working now.\n\n\nA: It looks like you never allocated any swap space on your hard drive during your install. \nExtended is the space in which your swap space and your Linux Distro will be placed..Hope this helps you.\n", "Q: How-To add a software to the Ubuntu Software Center \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to get my software into Ubuntu?\n\nMay somebody tell me how I can add a freeware to the Ubuntu Software Center?

I know a similar question has been made already (http://askubuntu.com/questions/35303/linux-swap-partition-is-in-extended-drive) but I have a similar problem with a partition alignment warning.\nI installed Ubuntu 10.04 on a 640 GB disk using the full-disk/auto-partitioning option.\nUbiquity created the following schema:\nDispositivo Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sda1   *           1       76353   613297152   83  Linux\n/dev/sda2           76353       77826    11832321    5  Esteso\nPartition 2 does not start on physical sector boundary.\n/dev/sda5           76353       77826    11832320   82  Linux swap / Solaris\n\nas you can see from the fdisk output, second partition (extended) is misaligned with the physical sector boundary. Disk Manager says: \"WARNING: the partition is misaligned by 1024 bytes. This may result in very poor performance.

Yes, you can remove both the swap partition and the extended partition that contains it and recreate the swap partition as a primary partition.  This probably will result in a properly aligned partition.\n", "Q: Why isn't SMTP working in Thunderbird? Good afternoon, all.  I am running Ubuntu 11.10, Thunderbird 8.0.

The message could not be sent because the connection to the SMTP server timed out.  Try again or contact your network administrator.'  Any ideas?  \n\nA: I checked my Hotmail account and it works.

To select a different conf from the default held in .dosbox, generate it with the config -writeconf command (as noted in the above answer), edit it and place it in your game folder, and launch the game so that dosbox uses the custom conf:\ndosbox -conf /home/mike/DOS/Game/dosboxgame.conf\n\nWith regard to your second question, you can mount multiple optical drives if you have more than one physical drive connected to your computer. The disc must be mounted in Ubuntu before you start dosbox. The dosbox command to add to your conf file is, for example:\nmount d /media/The_Web -t cdrom\n\nDosbox also has a very useful feature that allows you to mount a folder as if it were a cdrom: this is very useful when the folder contains multiple disk images. A sample command for this that I have in one of my dosbox confs is:\nmount d /home/mike/DOS/EXPRESS/DATA -t cdrom\n\nTo mount image files that you may have, use the imgmount feature, which supports multiple images. I have a command similar to the following example in another of my dosbox confs:\nimgmount d /home/mike/DOS/game/game.iso -t iso \n\nor (because -t iso or -t cdrom both work with disc images) you can use\nimgmount d /home/mike/DOS/TIMES/Timeshock.cue -t cdrom\n\nWhen you have composed all the entries you need for your conf (and set all the disks and folders to mount), the [autoexec] part of your conf may look this: \nimgmount d /home/mike/DOS/game/game.iso -t cdrom\nmount c /home/mike/DOS/game\nc:\ngame.EXE\n\nThere is more relevant information in the dosbox manual and on the useful wiki.\n\nA: With DosBox open, type:\nconfig -writeconf /home/user/dosbox.conf (or whatever) then exit Dosbox.\nOpen dosbox.conf and add (the [autoexec] is at the bottom):\n[autoexec] \n\nmount c /home/user/path/to/folder\n\nI assume you can do the same for just about any command, it seems to be basically a batch file that is ran at launch.\nhttp://www.ubuntugeek.com/howto-auto-mount-a-drive-in-dosbox.html\n", "Q: Fans Spin Irregularly Dell M4600 Precision 11.10 I just installed 11.10 on a brand new Dell Precision M4600 laptop yesterday and I'm noticing the fans spinning up to full speed every minute or so then dying back down within a few seconds. Where should I begin to diagnose this problem?\n\nA: Are you running with dual displays?  If so, do you see the same problem if you just use the laptop LCD?\nThe nvidia card has several power settings (google PowerMizer), and it automatically assumes the highest power setting when running with dual displays.  This generates a lot of heat, causing the fan to cycle on.  (You can watch the temperatures rise in the nvidia-settings tool.)  \nUnfortunately there's no way (that I know of) to get around this, since it's embedded in the nvidia drivers.  (Although you could play with fan control utilities if you're brave.....)\n\nA: In the Ubuntu forums someone managed to install and use Ubuntu 11.10 on the Dell m4600, disabling Optimus video mode in the BIOS and then installing the Nvidia proprietary driver..maybe the problem is related..check comment #24 and see if it can be of some help..\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=11480638\n", "Q: Grub 2 splash screen isn't showing in hidden mode until I press a key Using Lucid, in the form of Turnkey Core. I'm setting up Grub to boot into Windows by default, with an option to boot into Ubuntu as a recovery mode, with a script to restore a default image to the Windows partition.\nThe idea is to have a splash screen which tells the user to hold Shift for recovery options, otherwise it'll just boot to Windows.\nUnfortunately, while I can get my splash screen to work, it doesn't show up until I press a key -- doesn't seem to matter which key, as arrow keys, letters, and numbers all seem to work. At that point, the splash screen shows up and displays at the top left corner -- this appears to be the GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT, and the number updates every time I press a key; otherwise, it remains static until the actual countdown has finished. (I guess this indicates that it is also not showing the countdown, which it should be doing, as GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET is set to false.) Everything functions normally from this point: If I hold Shift, the menu is displayed, otherwise it boots into Windows.\nGot the menu to be hidden in multi-OS mode by using #11 here.\nAny ideas?\nClarification: My issue is that the splash screen does not appear until I press a key. I need the splash screen to show up on its own.\nContents of /etc/default/grub and /boot/grub/grub.cfg available here\n\nA: Posted as the answer on behalf of OP:\n\nAfter receiving a suggestion to ignore the splash screen entirely, and just use nested Grub menus, I decided to give that a shot. In the process, I found out that I can create a Grub menu which has a timeout of 0 and automatically loads another Grub via configfile, and, in so doing, actually triggers the splash screen on the second menu. So, grub.cfg now contains this, with default set to 1 and the timer set to 0:\nmenuentry \"Other menu\" { configfile (hd0,1)/boot/grub/othergrub.cfg }\nWhen it loads the second Grub, the splash screen from the second Grub loads up just fine, too -- no keypresses required.\nWeird workaround, but it does the trick.\n\n", "Q: Newly created ubuntu users cannot access my internal hdd partitions I have a problem with my ubuntu 11.10, the issue is described in the following link: Hard disk icon disappears after mounting\nAfter digging and digging I found the issue.

They will be listed in lsmod something like, snd_hda_code_realtek and snd_hda_codec_hdmi. By adding these to /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf you can disable them.\n\nA: I found that muting the microphone input in the mixer solved the problem.  I use a Dell XPS17.\n\nA: Try changing \"Enable Audio codec power management\" to good in the Tunables tab for powertop. After doing so, hwC0D0 is no longer listed in powertop for me.\n\nA: Muting / disabling stuff with alsamixer helped me get rid of the same problem on macbook air.\n", "Q: Sluggish performance on an Pavilion dv2210us Laptop with an Nvidia Geforce Go 6150 I am a new Linux user after installed Ubuntu 11.10 on my laptop.

I have a Sony VAIO P netbook and for several issues (graphics driver, audio driver and power management), I want to install an older version of the Linux kernel on Ubuntu 11.10 (actually its Xubuntu) that seems to be much more suitable.\nSo I searched for Ubuntu kernels and found this link which includes all versions of the Linux kernel distributed by Ubuntu. I am looking for a version before 2.6.38 (to escape the known power management issue) and of course solve my many driver problems!\n\n\n*\n\n*I guess my best bet is 2.6.37 but there are several 2.6.37.x-x kernels! Can someone point me to the right choice?\n\n*In each folder (for example: this one) there are several DEB packages. Which packages should I install? (Note: I have a 32-bit system)\n\n*What is the installation process? sudo dpkg -i *.deb ? Is this fine or additional steps are required?\nThanks.\n\nA: first the warning\nChanging the kernel is not to be taken lightly - you can leave yourself with serious graphics issues and other issues - and even non booting scenarios.\nIt is wise to disk-image with a good imaging tool such as Clonezilla BEFORE you start.\nmainline kernels vs ubuntu stock kernels\nThe mainline kernels are built using an older toolchain than stock ubuntu kernels.  Its perhaps better to consider downloading ubuntu kernels from specific Ubuntu versions\nFor example - 2.6.38 for Natty, 2.6.35 for Maverick and 2.6.32 for Lucid.\nHowever, you could look forward to v3.2 that is going to be used in Precise - some have reported good power-management issues with this kernel as well as the latest drivers.\nThere is a similar question here that will give you some further information: How to downgrade the Kernel on 11.10\nAssuming your main issue is power-management, then before you consider changing your kernel - consider installing Jupiter - this is an excellent power-management tool.\ninstalling from the mainline\nIf you must download from the mainline then the full instructions are on the community wiki. In summary 32bit or 64bit deb packages for headers & generic image together with a common \"all\" deb package.\nAll .deb packages can be installed with the same syntax:\nsudo dpkg -i [package_name].deb\n\nIf you want to use 2.6.37 - then just use the latest 2.6.37.x version.  Note - none of these kernels will be receiving security updates - you will need to patch these yourself.\nIf you are using proprietary drivers (e.g. nvidia or fglrx) then you will need to reinstall those drivers.  It may be wise to rename your /etc/X11/xorg.conf file first before booting.\n\nA: I had to install an even older kernel (2.6.32.21-generic) for stock modules to work with a custom kernel. VBoot releases their module built in the kernel and I had to match versions to get my other hardware to work.\nAs such, I thought I would explain how to obtain the discontinued kernels manually from http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/\n\n\n*\n\n*In the steps below, replace x.x.xx-xx with your kernel version and amd64 with your processor type. Note this is for the generic kernel and not using extra features such as PAE.\n\n*Go to http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/l/linux/ (I believe this lists most if not all the old kernel packages)\n\n*In the page CTRL+F find headers-x.x.xx-xx-generic and download the\n\n\n*\n\n*linux-headers-x.x.xx-xx-generic_x.x.xx-xx.yy_amd64.deb\n\n*linux-headers-x.x.xx-xx-generic_x.x.xx-xx.yy_all.deb\n\n\n*In the page CTRL+F find image-x.x.xx-xx-generic and download the\n\n\n*\n\n*linux-image-2.6.32-21-generic_2.6.32-21.32_amd64.deb\n\n\n*Put all of these packages in a folder alone, and from that folder (cd into it) run\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo dpkg -i *.deb\n\nA: Rather than going backwards why not try the newer kernel and see if that fixes the problems you seem to be experiencing and at the same time updating your system to a more stable and bug free release ?\nTry this:\nhttp://www.ubuntugeek.com/how-to-install-linux-kernel-3-5-rc-in-ubuntu-using-ppa.html\n", "Q: Login for internet use How to protect internet access using username and password. I mean that i need a situation, say when anyone opens a browser and trys to go for any site it would redirect to a login page for authentication. After login he/she can access any site.

So when anyone wants to access internet he/she has to login first so that i can track him/her.\n\nA: You really should provide more details, but in general these types of problems should be fixed on the router. That is, the router will accept clients, but will only forward traffic for clients on which a user has authenticated. Apache can be used to run the web application that enables the user to log in and then you'll likely use a script that configures iptables to forward traffic all traffic to that web ui. \n", "Q: How do I get \"The Witcher II\" working with wine?

There are many derivatives to Ubuntu, of which Xubuntu is one, using XFCE as a desktop environment. One can install Xubuntu directly from an ISO or install XFCE as an alternative session on Ubuntu.\nI am wondering: Is there more difference between installing Xubuntu from ISO and installing XFCE to Ubuntu?\n - If so which are these difference? \n - Which of the two do you recommend and why? \n\nA: Xubuntu has Xfce with additional packages and default configurations that differ from Xfce's. You can see the difference by choosing the Xfce session instead of the Xubuntu session, at the login manager screen.\nMost likely, you want Xubuntu/xubuntu-desktop; it would be an edge case if you specifically needed Xfce and not xubuntu-desktop.\n\nA: There is an xubuntu live (desktop) cd available here :\nhttp://xubuntu.org/getxubuntu/\nxfce is a desktop environment , see http://www.xfce.org/ and http://xwinman.org/\nSo when you install xfce you get xfce.\nxubuntu, however, is an additional set of packages and customizations to make the xfce experience more rich. xubuntu-desktop is a meta package and you can see the entire list of packages here\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/about/about-ubuntu/derivatives\nAs you can see the list includes xfce + a number of additional packages.\nSee also https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/LowMemorySystems#XFCE\nUse which ever you prefer, from your post I would suggest you stay with Ubuntu (unity).\n\nA: Installing XFCE will give you the upstream XFCE desktop environment. The same way that Ubuntu differs from upstream Gnome, Lubuntu differs from upstream LXDE. For instance, Ubuntu uses Firefox instead of Epiphany and Thunderbird instead of Evolution. Installing XFCE or Gnome in Ubuntu will pull in extra applications that are normally used in those environments but isn't installed by default in Ubuntu. Other than that, the software is the same so there's no radical difference. \n", "Q: How do I connect to a wireless network, turn off bluetooth and airplain mode, on my Dell inspiron switch? I originally connected to a wireless network at a friends house and it was all gravy. I turned off my bluetooth and suddenly was unable to find any networks at all. Ubuntu has apparently confused my wireless card with my bluetooth connection. \nBut my internet server requires me to register my mac address with it in order to gain enternet access. In other words. I can't get access unless it's accessing the net through my wireless card and right now it's using my bluetooth connection to try and connect. Wierd huh? \nI have made several attempts to turn on my wireless and it continually shows up grey and inaccessible. It says it's in airplane mode and I cannot get it to turn off airplane mode. \nEvery time I do and I exit the network manager it turns right back on, and while I'm in the network manager and turn off the airplain mode it still will not allow me to turn on my wireless card or access it at all.

I use Dropbox to transfer file (ebooks, documents, images...) to and from an iPad and 2 ubuntu laptops in the same LAN, but it's a nonsense to move files to the cloud and back again to the same LAN. \nIs there a local alternative, such as setting up a samba share, or a ssh/scp/sshfs service, or rsync on the ubuntu pcs, and accessing it via some app on the iPad? \n\nA: You could use something like:\nhttp://www.webupd8.org/2011/10/owncloud-2-your-personal-cloud-server.html (a software solution) --or--\nhttp://tonido.com/  if you prefer a hardware approach.\n", "Q: Is there tutorial creation software like WINK?

Is there anything I can use, that is easy to learn, exports to flash, and possible has audio capability, and of course works in Ubuntu versions (current and upcoming)?\n\nA: There are different applications to record screencasts under Ubuntu. They may not allow creating flash videos directly, but usually you can convert the screencast to flash in a separate step.\nHere's a list of applications that are available via apt:\n\n\n*\n\n*Byzanz  (creating GIF)\n\n*Istanbul  (OGG)\n\n*recordMyDesktop  (OGG)\n\n*RecordItNow  (multiple formats)\n\n*XVidCap \nYou may even use VLC Media Player to record screencasts.\nSee also the Ubuntu Wiki on Screencasts in general and on creating Screencasts, especially using Istanbul, RecordMyDesktop, XVidCap and FFmpeg.\nEDIT:\nThere seems to be almost no application that allows for creating interactive tutorials or screencasts.

But I've read on forums that changing linux commands with chmod can cause problems in multi-user systems.\nCan anyone explain why that might be?\n\nA: Adding the setuid bit to the shutdown process will allow any process owned by any user ID to shutdown or restart the system with arbitrary delays.\nWhile unlikely, it may also expose buffer overflows that allow unprivileged users to do more than this.  With the setuid bit set, there is a possibility that the command can be invoked with input that causes the command to malfunction in a way useful to an attacker.\nEven if you have a single user system, this can be a concern: if an attacker uses an exploit that allows them to run unprivileged code on your system, then setuid programs can provide a way to gain superuser privileges.\nIn contrast, the API used by the desktop provides much more limited actions (restart now, shutdown now, etc), and only allows unprivileged users to activate them in limited circumstances (user is an active local user, and there are no others logged into the system).  If the application you're using has an option to use these APIs instead of directly invoking the shutdown command, that would be preferable.\n", "Q: How do you run a java program from a bash script? I am trying to run a minecraft server from a \"run.sh\" script.

I want it to open a terminal window that is running the java program. I am new to Linux so I'm sure I'm doing something stupid, any help would be appreciated. \n\nA: If the problem is that running the script doesn't show a terminal window, the solution depends on the window manager you're using. Gnome as well as KDE allow to edit properties of desktop shortcuts on a right-click and setting a option like \"run in terminal\" there.\nAnother way is to edit the desktop configuration file manually: you can find them in the Desktop subdirectory of your home dir. Just add a line with Terminal=true to the desktop configuration file that should run the server.\n\nA: Why are you using echo? That just prints the rest of the line as a sequence of literals to the terminal.\n", "Q: Windows Recovery and Dual Booting After getting a new Toshiba Portege laptop I installed Ubuntu. At the time I was very naive and I didn't completely know what dual booting meant but now I regret the decision and I'm looking to dual boot Visa along side 11.10. My original plan was to back up my files and use the Vista Recovery CDs to get windows up then reinstall Ubuntu, then select the Dual boot option. Only problem is Toshiba doesn't ship recovery CDs with their computers and paying 30 bucks for windows seems useless to me. Any suggestions as to how I can Dual boot Windows from Ubuntu?\n\nA: His issue is that Toshiba doesn't include the Vista media, although the laptop will have a valid Vista key.\nJohn, what I recommend you do is ask a tech-savvy friend to locate a OEM Vista install CD (likely using bittorrent) and use that to reinstall windows. As your laptop came with a Vista Key sticker this is legal.\nYou can then setup whatever dual-boot options at a later date.\n\nA: You can download Windows OS from Microsoft.  I forget now from exactly where, but you should be able to google it.  Make your CD/DVD from the ISO, and install.  It will ask for your Product Key[ should be on computer case].\n\nA: Ubuntu use grub to manage the daul boot.  Just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command below.\nsudo apt-get install startupmanager \n\n", "Q: When to use gconf vs dconf? Both gconf and dconf editors are available. Given the change to dconf should we still be using gconf at all? Do changes in gconf actually do anything when running 11.10?\n\nA: dconf is a new way for applications to store settings, and it is intended to replace gconf. dconf-editor and gconf-editor are for their respective configuration systems, and they don't talk to each other. At the moment that transition is still a work in progress, so many applications continue to use gconf. In addition, some applications still have settings left over in gconf even though they are using dconf now.\nAlmost all of the software that is installed by default - everything that comes from GNOME - uses dconf (if anything). Almost everything else that is available uses gconf, though this is of course changing as older software is brought up to date.\nSo, yes, changing a setting in gconf is likely to do something! If you did a fresh install of Ubuntu 11.10 and didn't migrate your gconf settings, it's likely that everything you see with gconf-editor is being looked at and understood by some current application. If your settings predate 11.10, there may be stuff there that isn't being used.\nAs a rule of thumb, check dconf first and if what you're looking for isn't there, try gconf.\n\nA: Not all applications have been upgraded to use DConf, but still use GConf. Those apps must be configured using GConf. \n", "Q: Can I bind the media play keyboard button to start Banshee if no player is running? Whenever I hit the media play/pause button while Banshee isn't running, this is what I see:\n\nI'd like to have it simply start Banshee if it isn't running. Is there a way to do this? I understand that I could probably bind a script to the key, but I don't want it to run and prevent Banshee from receiving the keys when it's running. Any ideas?\n\nA: i think part of the problem is that currently the play key could control other programs (such as vlc if it is running). having the keyboard media button start banshee would break that behavior.\ni recommend using gnome-do. then you can just summon do (ctrl+space), start banshee (start typing banshee, hit enter when gnome-do figures it out), and press play on the keyboard. note that i've remapped gnome-do to ctrl+space since the super key summons unity's search function. the default is super+space. \nthis solution is probably more keystrokes than you want, but it is pretty fast if you are accustomed to using gnome-do (which is awesome and you should look into anyway!). there is a banshee extension for gnome-do, but it is currently broken (in ubuntu 11.10, anyway). hopefully it will get fixed soon, and you'll have an even quicker way to get your music playing. \n", "Q: How do I change Ubuntu's GUI? Recently I installed a program to change Ubuntu's desktop but it went bad, so I uninstalled it but the GUI then had debris and stuff all around.\nI had to reinstall Ubuntu completely. How do I change Ubuntu's desktop without messing up the system?\n\nA: We have lots of different desktops. You can (click to) install xfce4, LXDE, Gnome Shell (includes Gnome Panel as \"fallback\") or any other desktop. You choose the desktop you want to use before logging in, by clicking on the button next to the password field. \n", "Q: How can I change the default web page at the system level? I am trying to change the default web page, so that people using guest-session will open a specific web page instead of the default site.\nAlso, please note that when I installed Chromium, the Ubuntu default page comes up there too. There must be a global variable somewhere. Does anyone know where this variable is?\n\nA: I think the default is set in the package itself and can't be easily changed. However, when you create a new user, the files in /etc/skel get copied to the new user's home directory. You could create a new user, set it up as you want the default, and copy all that user's dotfiles into /etc/skel.\nYou mentioned using a guest session, though. I'm not sure if my method will work in guest sessions. Try it and see.\nIf it doesn't, here's another option: Create a guest user. Then put something like the following in ~/.logout:\nshopt -s dotglob\nrm -rf ~/* \ncp -a /etc/skel/* $HOME\n\nThis should cause the user to be reset every logout.\n\nA: Are you asking how to change the homepage of each of your browsers? The page that appears when you click on the browser to bring it up? If so, you can do that from within the browser. In Firefox go to Edit, click on preferences, and you will see a drop down. Make sure it say's go to my homepage...Browse to the page you wish to use and click on \"Use current page\"...That will then be your homepage and it will be the first page the browser will open too..Each user can set their own homepage from their own desktop. Same thing with Chrome, just click on the \"Preferences\" there too.\n\nA: Firefox\nNot sure how to do this with chromium\nSet default home page\nYou can set the default page by editing /etc/firefox/syspref.js\n# Graphical\ngksu gedit /etc/firefox/syspref.js\n\n# Command line\nsudo -e /etc/firefox/syspref.js\n\nAt the bottom of the file add:\nuser_pref(\"browser.startup.homepage\", \"http://google.com\");\n\nObviously change \"http://google.com\" to the page of your choice (or not).\nThis change will not affect existing firefox profiles for existing users. You can reset all users home pages with\nsudo sed -i -e '/startup.homepage/d' /home/*/.mozilla/firefox/*/prefs.js\n\nchange \"/home/*\" to \"~user_name\" for a single user.\nsudo sed -i -e '/startup.homepage/d' ~bodhi/.mozilla/firefox/*/prefs.js\n\nLock home page\nYou can lock the home page for all users by  editing /etc/firefox/syspref.js and using\nlockPref(\"browser.startup.homepage\", \"http://google.com\");\n\nAlthough again this does not affect existing profiles, you would need to run the sed command again ;)\n", "Q: Ubuntu US Metric Format I use ubuntu 11.10 with Unity/GNOME 3 and I want to make the Metric System the default. Is\nthere a United States Metric System format?\nin Ubuntu in the System Settings under keyboard layouts there is Format but I see no way to change it to Metric, with out changing from United States.\n\nA: While it is possible to create new locale data, it is a fair bit of work.  You can however select different locales for different uses through the various LC_* environment variables (this is what the Language Settings control panel does when you choose a different language).  This may be enough for what you want.\nThe locale man page provides some details of the various locale categories (see the Environment Variables section).  Some variables you might be interested in include:\n\n\n*\n\n*LC_MEASUREMENT - Measurement units (Metric or Other).\n\n*LC_PAPER - Paper size.\n\n*LC_NUMERIC - Non-monetary numeric formats.  I'm not sure whether this one would be relevant though, since I don't think there is much difference in the way US writes their numbers.\n\n\nIf you want to change any of these, I would suggest doing it by editing ~/.profile and adding a line like:\nexport LC_XXX=\"YYY\"\n\nSince that is how the current language selector stores its preferences.\nSetting any of these environment variables to a locale that uses metric measurements (e.g. en_AU.utf-8 or en_NZ.utf-8) should help change the defaults various applications use.\nThere will probably still be a few applications that default to US measurement formats though, since I've seen a few that effectively use LC_MESSAGES to pick units (usually by attempting to translate a special string and rely on the translator to translate it in a way that indicates the desired units).  For those you'll either have to live with the US default, or change the messages locale to something else (which will probably have the side effect of switching to British English).\n\nA: Well is my believe that is not really a Unity/GNOME3 than a standardization way which as Wikipedia mentions:\n\nSI is the world's most widely used system of measurement, which is\n  used both in everyday commerce and in science. The system has been\n  nearly globally adopted with the United States being the only\n  industrialized nation that does not mainly use the metric system in\n  its commercial and standards activities. The United Kingdom has\n  officially partially adopted metrication, with no intention of\n  replacing imperial units entirely. Canada has adopted it for all legal\n  purposes but imperial/US units are still in common use, particularly\n  in the buildings trade.\n\nAs it looks the last countries that use Imperial Unit are slowly converting to the INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM but somehow some of them still grab onto the idea of establishing the Imperial System as the universal one. (More than 150 countries versus less than 5 is not really universal). Anyway I find it easier to go from Meter to Kilometer than going from Inches to Yards to Miles. I know 1000 Meters are a Kilometer and I know 1 Meter is 100cm. I would crazy trying to do that with inches, yards and miles. Same goes for pounds and other Imperial measurements.\nSo to answer, Ubuntu and maybe others, by default, are following the standards for each country. There might be a way to change this I do not know but Ubuntu has stored what system each country available for it uses and it tries to satisfy that countries system the best way it can.\nThis is just an answer as to why they might not show an option for it. But maybe an Ubuntu dev can say the reasons as to why this is the way it is.\n", "Q: Why isn't WebM video supported out of the box? Ubuntu can't include non-free codecs, but has had the ability to play Ogg Theora and Vorbis files out-of-the-box for years because they're open source. Now that WebM is such a popular, free alternative to H.264, why isn't support included by default?\n\nA: Webm has to first be supported out the box in the correct gstreamer packages before it can be supported in Ubuntu out the box. The main reason it is not included as yet is because it is a rather \"recent\" format and code for supporting it is still a bit fresh.\nYou would have to wait for gstreamer to support it as part of their default set, since at the moment it's still a bit \"experimental\" in gstreamer.\n", "Q: Bind a mouse button to show the Gnome Shell Activities overview I'm trying bind a button on my mouse to show the Gnome Shell Activities overview.

So:\n\n\n*\n\n*After installing easystroke and starting it, the Ctrl+F1 combination worked (somehow, easystroke reset something that allowed xbindkeys to work, even though I assigned no actions in easystroke). If I turned off easystroke, xbindkeys also stopped working.\n\n*After installing easystroke and starting it, the Alt+F1  combination did not work (I obviously changed the keyboard combination back to ALT+F1). So, there's possibly some weirdness surrounding XTE, Gnome Shell and the Alt key?\nI installed easystroke:\nsudo apt-get install easystroke\n\nThen Alt+F2 and typed in easystroke.\n\n\n*\n\n*Adding the action in easystroke (assigned to Alt+F1) and turning off xbindkeys works.\n\n\nSo, if you're an average user like me, don't use xbindkeys in Gnome Shell (there are some weird bugs or conflicts going on), use easystroke. Easystroke just works. Remember to add easystroke to your startup applications.\n\nA: I got it working running xbindkeys as root. My ~/.xbindkeysrc:\n\"xte 'keydown Alt_L' 'key F1' 'keyup Alt_L'\"\nrelease+b:9\n\nP. S. Easystroke work for me as well, but if you bind stroke from only one key press, you had to press having mouse completely still. This was actually hard·\n", "Q: Reverse two finger scroll direction (natural scrolling)? Two-fingered scrolling is working fine, but is there a way that I can reverse the direction (natural scrolling)? It seems backwards opposed to the way OSX does it. \n\nA: The Natural Scrolling application referred to in Basharat Sial's answer does not fix natural scrolling in certain system windows.\nAs an alternative, I recommend the guide provided in this answer. You won't need the natural scrolling application anymore when you use his guide.\n\nA: There are several ways to enable system-wide inverse or natural scrolling for the mouse.  Only two ways I have tried will enable it for all windows, including gedit, terminal, software center, nautilus, and others.  The easiest way to do it is to do the following.  This method will need the latest version of the xserver-xorg-input-evdev driver, which you can get from here.  I know it will work because I am using it and tested it previous to writing this version of a guide I previously wrote for Fedora 21.  Make sure that you have reverse scrolling turned off in Ubuntu-Tweak, or you won't see the effect of the changes.  In addition, for those users who do not want to use natural scrolling on your system now that reverse scrolling will be system-wide, those users can use this option to turn off natural scrolling on a per user basis.  Now, to get started...\nUpdate/install Evdev to latest version and reboot before continuing this guide.\nGet your mouse device id by running the following in a terminal:\n\nxinput list\n\n\nTake that number you got (just the number after \"id=\") and replace \"{device id}\" with that number in the following command:\n\nxinput list-props {device id} | grep \"Scrolling Distance\"\n\n\nIt is case sensitive unless you use -i in the grep command.  Write down the numbers you find in the output from that command (in my case it was the number 1, shown three times and separated by commas). You will use the negative values of the numbers you get in your output.  Also, make sure to write down the property number (it will be in parentheses in the output; in my case it was (272) in Ubuntu and (273) in Fedora).\nNote:  If you get no output containing the property \"Scrolling Distance\" this method will not work for you and you will need to stop here and skip to the alternate way shown below this guide.\nRun the following command in your open terminal:\n\nsudo touch /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-natural-scrolling.conf\n\n\nNow, run the following command (you can use your favorite text editor instead of nano but I use nano):\n\nsudo nano /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-natural-scrolling.conf\n\n\nIn the file you have opened in your preferred text editor, paste the following (but be sure to change the numbers to the same comma-separated numbers you got from step 3; in my case the number was 1 so I put -1):\n\nSection \"InputClass\"\n        Identifier \"Natural Scrolling\"\n        MatchIsPointer \"on\"\n        MatchDevicePath \"/dev/input/event*\"\n        Option \"VertScrollDelta\" \"-1\"\n        Option \"HorizScrollDelta\" \"-1\"\n        Option \"DialDelta\" \"-1\"\nEndSection\n\n\nSave the file and exit the text editor.  No need for a reboot.  Just issue the following command (substituting the property number and the negatives of the numbers you got in the third step, and the device id you got from the second step):\n\nxinput set-prop {device id} {property number} -1 -1 -1\n\n\nYou might need to quit nautilus and restart nautilus on some systems (skip this if natural scrolling is working in nautilus after running the above command).  Press Alt+F2 and run each of these commands separately:\n\nnautilus -q\n\nnautilus -n\n\n\nThat's it! You should now have system-wide natural scrolling that will be persistent.\nAlternate method:\nIf you do not want to install the latest version of Evdev (or, if your mouse doesn't have the \"Scrolling Distance\" property even in the latest Evdev), you can do the following:\nRun the following command in your open terminal:\n\nsudo touch /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-natural-scrolling.conf\n\n\nNow, run the following command (you can use your favorite text editor instead of nano but I use nano):\n\nsudo nano /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-natural-scrolling.conf\n\n\nIn the file you have opened in your preferred text editor, paste the following:\n\nSection \"InputClass\"\n        Identifier \"natural scrolling for mouse wheel\"\n        MatchIsPointer \"on\"\n        MatchDevicePath \"/dev/input/event*\"\n        Driver \"mouse\"\n        Option \"Device\" \"/dev/input/mice\"\n        Option \"Protocol\" \"Auto\"\n        Option \"ZAxisMapping\" \"5 4\"\nEndSection\n\n\nSave the file and reboot.  As above, individual users can switch it off on a per-user basis by using Ubuntu-Tweak to \"turn on\" natural scrolling (it will be the reverse of the system-wide setting on a per-user basis but will not affect the actual system setting for other users who will want to use natural scrolling).\nNote:  The alternative method here will not work if you have the latest Evdev installed, such as in Fedora 22.  Use the Evdev method above.  Also note:  Neither method will work with libinput in Wayland.  You will need an alternative way of doing it per user or otherwise.  If using libinput, make sure to remove the files created as above, and create a startup item in a desktop file.  After creating the desktop file, place the following in the Exec line (be sure to use the device id for your mouse and the naturalscrolling property number for your mouse while using libinput; my device id was 11 and the property was 272; adjust yours accordingly).\n\nsh -c \"sleep 5; exec xinput set-prop 11 272 1\"\n\nFollowing that, save the file and logoff.  When you logon again you should have natural scrolling on a per-user basis or may be able to set it in the autostart for all users.\n\nA: The easiest way to set natural scrolling system-wide and for it to work with all system apps, is to set up the following file(s).\nTouchpads only:\n/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-natural-scrolling-touchpads.conf\nSection \"InputClass\"\n    Identifier \"Natural Scrolling Touchpads\"\n    MatchIsTouchpad \"on\"\n    MatchDevicePath \"/dev/input/event*\"\n    Option \"VertScrollDelta\" \"-111\"\n    Option \"HorizScrollDelta\" \"-111\"\nEndSection\n\nMouses only:\n/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-natural-scrolling-mouses.conf\nSection \"InputClass\"\n    Identifier \"Natural Scrolling Mouses\"\n    MatchIsPointer \"on\"\n    MatchIsTouchpad \"off\"\n    MatchDevicePath \"/dev/input/event*\"\n    Option \"VertScrollDelta\" \"-1\"\n    Option \"HorizScrollDelta\" \"-1\"\n    Option \"DialDelta\" \"-1\"\nEndSection\n\nFor both mouses and touchpads, create both files.\nThen, reboot.\nThe benefit of using one of these two configurations is they are not device-specific. You can plug in other mouses or touchpads or keyboards with touchpads, and it'll work.\n\nA: Please follow below steps to system widely change the scrolling.\n\n\n*\n\n*On Terminal write: xev -event mouse. You will get one small box and when you bring your mouse into that section you will get a lot data getting generated into the Terminal.\n\n*On scrolling up, note the button name, lets say \"x\" (in my case it is button 5). Also note down the button name on scrolling down, lets say \"y\". in my case it is \"4\".\n\n*Create a backup of ~/.Xmodmap file by using cp ~/.Xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap.bak.\n\n*Do cat ~/.Xmodmap. Output would be like pointer = 1 2 3 5 4 6 7 8 9 10 11 12\n\n*In the above output search for x and y and they will be in consecutive position and just swap them.\nIn my case echo \"pointer = 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12\" > ~/.Xmodmap && xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap worked. Note switch of 4 and 5.\n\n*Now the scrolling will be applied system wide. No need to reboot.\n\n\nA: The simplest and in my opinion the best way to achieve this on Ubuntu 12.10 and above (didn't test it on 12.04 and below) is to edit synaptics configuration:\nsudoedit /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-synaptics.conf\n\nOn 16.04, copy this file under /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-synaptics.conf, then edit:\ncp /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-synaptics.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/\nsudoedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-synaptics.conf\n\nadd those lines in the Section \"InputClass\" Identifier \"touchpad catchall\":\n        Option \"VertScrollDelta\" \"-111\"\n        Option \"HorizScrollDelta\" \"-111\"\n\nSo that it reads like follows:\nSection \"InputClass\"\n        Identifier \"touchpad catchall\"\n        Driver \"synaptics\"\n        MatchIsTouchpad \"on\"\n        Option \"VertScrollDelta\" \"-111\"\n        Option \"HorizScrollDelta\" \"-111\"\n# ...\n\nReboot (or read on) and have fun with natural scrolling :)\nIf you want to try your settings without reboot, you can use synclient\nsynclient VertScrollDelta=-111\nsynclient HorizScrollDelta=-111\n\nThe changes are immediately applied, but won't stay after reboot if you don't add them in 50-synaptics-conf file.\nNote for GNOME or Cinnamon:\nIf you're using GNOME or Cinnamon desktop manager, there is a good chance that GNOME/Cinnamon's settings can override your custom settings. To prevent GNOME/Cinnamon's settings override yours, open dconf Editor [dconf-editor] and edit following entry:\n/org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/mouse/\nor\n/org/cinnamon/settings-daemon/plugins/mouse/\n\nUncheck active.\nP.S.:\nThe default value is 111 and it indicates the speed, that means you can play with the value to adjust the scrolling speed to you favor. Giving it a negative value makes it simply to scroll in reversed direction.\n\nA: You can also use Ubuntu Tweak tool to enable natural scrolling (misc settings)\n\nOfficial homepage with .deb distributive: http://ubuntu-tweak.com/\n\nA: The naturalscrolling package doesn't seem to work for Ubuntu 12.10.

See D Charles Pyle's answer below for a workaround that works in all applications. Or follow Gnome bug 682457 for progress on a core fix that won't require a workaround.\nYou can use \"Natural Scrolling\" to have a system wide inverse scrolling.\nWhat is Natural Scrolling?\nNatural Scrolling is a GNOME Applet allowing you to reverse the direction of scrolling. You push your fingers upwards to move the page content upwards (and downwards for downwards) just like on iOS devices. Don't move scrollbars anymore but your file.\nInstall Natural Scrolling:\nNatural Scrolling can be installed from its PPA.\nHit Alt+Ctrl+T to open terminal and run following commands:\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:zedtux/naturalscrolling\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install naturalscrolling\n\nHow to enable Natural Scrolling?\nOnce installed, Hit Super key (Windows key) to open Unity dash and search for \"natural scrolling\" and open it. You'll see a new indicator in Unity panel, Click on it and select your device. In the preferences you can set it to start at login.\nThat's it!\n\n\nA: On Ubuntu 14.04 to Ubuntu 20.04, go to \"Settings\", then \"Mouse & Touchpad\" and select \"Natural Scrolling\".\n\n\nA: The reverse scrolling you're talking about is called \"natural scrolling,\" and can be enabled several different ways in Ubuntu.

I recommend clicking the \"Test Your Settings\" button to try it out.\n\n\nSecond way: using DConf Editor\nThis is also accessible via DConf Editor as well. To install DConf Editor, run:\nsudo apt-get install dconf-editor\n\nThen go to org.gnome.settings-daemon.peripherals.touchpad and check natural-scroll.\n\n\nYou can also set this option on the command line:\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.peripherals.touchpad natural-scroll true\n\nOn Ubuntu 20.04\nThe DConf path has been changed to: org.gnome.desktop.peripherals.touchpad and so does the command:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.peripherals.touchpad natural-scroll true\n\n\nA: OK, so I had Firefox scrolling one way and Evolution scrolling the other.\nI set natural scrolling under System settings, but find that Ubuntu tweak natural scrolling counteracts it in certain apps.

I want to use an SSD for my Ubuntu installation and an hdd for Windows. I realized that I have to install windows first and then ubuntu, and so I did that. When I first install windows it boots fine from my hdd, but when I add ubuntu on my ssd and restart, I get a black screen with a blinking cursor. I've read many forums where this is asked but haven't found a single solution that works. \nI've tried boot repair. It told me to make a fat ESP partition and I did that as well but it still doesn't work. \nI'm a noob and any suggestions would be really appreciated.\n\nA: Unfortunately, you'll get a lot of completely unhelpful information on the Internet about this, since the boot process on UEFI-based systems is completely different from the boot process on older BIOS-based hardware. Completely describing the relevant differences in one post here is impossible, so for full information, I recommend you check out the Wikipedia page on UEFI and my Web page on EFI boot loaders for Linux. (Note that \"UEFI\" refers to the next generation of EFI; essentially EFI 2.x. For the most part, the two terms are interchangeable, although \"UEFI\" is more specific and refers to a newer version of the technology.)\nTo get you started, though, you should first verify that you are booting Windows in EFI mode. This can be done in a number of ways, such as typing \"bcdedit\" in an Administrative Command Prompt window. The result should include a reference to winload.efi in the \"path\" line of the \"Windows Boot Loader\" section. If instead this line refers to winload.exe, then the system is booted in BIOS mode, and you need to follow more conventional BIOS advice for this.\nAssuming you're booted in EFI mode, my first advice is to forget about installing Ubuntu 11.10 or earlier. These versions include bugs in the installation process that make it much harder to set up a dual-boot with any other OS. Ubuntu 12.04 fixes the worst of these bugs. In 12.04 booted in EFI mode, the installer should detect the EFI System Partition (ESP; a partition that holds boot loaders) created by Windows and add its own boot loader to that partition.\nOne possible complication is that Ubuntu might not boot in EFI mode, even if Windows is installed in that mode. You can check this detail by looking for the directory /sys/firmware/efi. (You may need to use the \"try before installing\" option to check for this file, then launch the installer.) If This file is present, you're definitely booted in EFI mode. If not, you're probably booted in BIOS mode, although that's not 100% certain. If you find you're booting in BIOS mode, you should either correct that problem or go ahead and install in BIOS mode and switch your boot mode afterward. Either of those options is worth a whole new question here, so I won't go into them.\nIdeally, if Ubuntu 12.04 installs correctly, it'll detect Windows and make GRUB 2 the default boot loader, so the system will work as expected, offering you a boot menu when you boot. Sometimes, though, you'll need to add Windows to the GRUB configuration, which you can do by creating an entry like this in /etc/grub.d/40_custom and then re-running \"grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg\":\nmenuentry \"Windows 7\" {\n        set root='(hd0,gpt1)'\n        chainloader /EFI/microsoft/BOOT/bootmgfw.efi\n}\n\nOther times the system may continue to boot straight into Windows. This can usually be corrected by deleting EFI/boot/bootx64.efi from the ESP, or perhaps replacing it with a copy of the GRUB 2 boot loader file (probably EFI/ubuntu/grub_x64.efi, IIRC). Unfortunately, this problem is caused by bugs in specific EFI implementations, so the workaround can be highly system-specific.\nYour symptom of a black screen with a blinking cursor suggests a serious GRUB misconfiguration, or perhaps a completely missing GRUB installation. I'm going to duck this question by saying that with any luck it will be fixed by Ubuntu 12.04. If not, I recommend installing ELILO or Fedora's patched GRUB Legacy to replace GRUB 2, since in my experience GRUB 2 is the least reliable of the available Linux EFI boot loaders. (See the EFI boot loaders page I referenced in the first paragraph of this reply for details.)\n\nA: Have you tried making a 200MB partition on the ssdhd for the uefi like windows has?\nI don't know what format it has to be in but I am sure someone knows.\nTry pulling the windows HD out then install Ubuntu (or distro of choice) then plug windows back in, set the boot order t ubuntu first then edit grub (grub2?) to add in windows.\nIf you can try the F12 trick at boot up and select the drive you want.

Ubuntu will automatically detect your graphics card. Because ubuntu 11.10 has KMS support. Ubuntu will detect your nvidia card as VGA[default display]. To install the driver[to get 3D support] for your nvidia card you can use jocky[additional driver] from ubuntu or download nvidia driver from here http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us\n\nA: You can also manually install the 173 driver for your card, by downloading it from the nvidia website.\n", "Q: How do I remove an icon from the top panel in GNOME Fallback mode?

I cannot find my Document, Pictures and Video folders in $HOME. They just disappeared. \nI tried doing cd ~/Documents from the terminal but there seems to be no folder.\nAny idea how to look for them ?\n\nA: Depends on what you mean. But if you REALLY deleted them and they are not in trash you could try with: http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec\nI would definitly run it from a boot cd (and not install it on the harddrive) if the home-partition are the same as the root partition. Otherwise you will likely overwrite the lost files.\nBut you will need luck...\n\nA: If these are deleted from GUI (nautilus) there are chances that you'll find them in \"Trash\" - from there you can recover it.\nIf these are deleted via terminal using \"rm\" command, tough luck. Niclas Nilsson has suggested some option which may work\nId the folder are moved (accidentally) rather than deleted - then try to \"find\" them. Nautilus has \"search\" option.

It's a way to chain multiple commands together while considering that the latter command should run only if the former command finished without errors.\nEDIT:\nI assume the errors are caused by the MonoMac Extra package that you've selected when running ./configure the first time:\n7. [X] extras/MonoDevelop.MonoMac\n\nI'm not sure whether this extra module can be build on a Linux system. If you don't want to create Mac OSX or MeeGo Applications, i would recommend to deactivate those extra packages.\nI assume you will have to run ./configure --select instead of simply ./configure to modify your initial selection.\nEDIT 2:\nRunning Monodevelop using make run will work, but the running version isn't \"installed\" system-wide. This is useful if you want to test different MonoDevelop versions without installing and deinstalling them. If you want to use the compiled version as default version, i think it's recommended to install it first.\nTo do so, first check the --prefix option of the configure script. It determines the base directory where to install the compiled stuff. Usually it points to /usr/local or something similar, maybe you want to change it to /opt/monodevelop or something like that.\nIn short:\n\n\n*\n\n*remove old artifacts from prior builds using sudo make clean ;\n\n*re-run configure using ./configure --select --prefix=/opt/monodevelop\n\n*Build and install it using sudo make and sudo make install.\n\n\nIf sudo make install was successful, you don't need make run anymore, instead you can run the installed MonoDevelop.\nTo create a starter or shortcut, you could create a file Monodevelop.desktop and place it into /usr/share/applications or ~/.local/share/application It may have the following content:\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nEncoding=UTF-8\nName=MonoDevelop\nGenericName=MonoDevelop IDE\nComment=MonoDevelop IDE\nExec=***path to executable*** - customize\nIcon=***path to icon, usually PNG*** - customize\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nStartupNotify=false\nCategories=Development;IDE\n\nThen, you can drag it to the start menu or onto your desktop. \nSee also this tutorial on building and running MonoDevelop on Ubuntu Linux.\n", "Q: Playing video on Intel GMA with top-of-the-edge (xorg-edgers) drivers - known bugs?

Amazing.\n", "Q: Disable touchpad while the lid is down Kubuntu 11.10 (netbook edition)\nMy wife's netbook has the following problem: when the lid is closed, it activates the touchpad every now and then - it makes small movements and taps. The notebook is set not to go to sleep while the AC adapter is plugged in, so whenever the lid closes, it keeps doing things on its own.\nEspecially annoying when pausing a film and going to sleep, as after a while it will tap on the player window and resume the film, scaring the crap out of everyone around.\nI didn't find any option to disable the touchpad while the lid is down, but maybe there's some kind of an event I could hook into and disable/re-enable it manually?\n\nA: What you can do is put your computer to sleep before closing the lid. that way, pressing the power button would resume the sleep, and the lid closed won't affect the touchpad.\nAlternativly, you can open your terminal (ctrl+alt+T) and type\nsudo rmmod psmouse\n\nIt allows a usb mouse, wireless or otherwise, but shuts down the touchpad.\nAlso, you have the option to install touchpad-indicator, wich provide an easy way to deactivate your touchpad\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:atareao/atareao\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install touchpad-indicator\n\nIt will be under Application > Accesory OR, depending on your UI, will be a small \"touchpad-like\" button next to the volume button\n\nA: Since nobody could tell me how to do exactly what I wanted, here's the solution I came up with:\nDisabling the touchpad/mouse\n$ xinput --list\n⎡ Virtual core pointer                          id=2    [master pointer  (3)]\n⎜   ↳ Virtual core XTEST pointer                id=4    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ FSPPS/2 Sentelic FingerSensingPad         id=12   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎣ Virtual core keyboard                         id=3    [master keyboard (2)]\n    ↳ Virtual core XTEST keyboard               id=5    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Power Button                              id=6    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Video Bus                                 id=7    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Sleep Button                              id=8    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Power Button                              id=9    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ USB2.0 UVC PC Camera                      id=10   [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ AT Translated Set 2 keyboard              id=11   [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ MSI Laptop hotkeys                        id=13   [slave  keyboard (3)]\n\nAs we can see, my touchpad is the one with id=12. To disable it, I need to run:\n$ xinput set-int-prop 12 \"Device Enabled\" 8 0\n\nand to enable it again:\n$ xinput set-int-prop 12 \"Device Enabled\" 8 1\n\nGetting the lid state\nFirst of all, I can get the state of the lid on my system from this file:\n$ cat /proc/acpi/button/lid/LID0/state \nstate:      open\n\nWhen I close the lid, the state becomes closed.\nNow to get the state as a variable, I can check the exit status of a nifty grep command:\n$ grep -q closed /proc/acpi/button/lid/*/state\n$ echo $?\n1\n\nSo to enable or disable the touchpad depending on the lid state, all I need to do is:\n$ grep -q closed /proc/acpi/button/lid/*/state\n$ xinput set-int-prop 12 \"Device Enabled\" 8 $?\n\nHooking the ACPI lid event\nTo execute the above commands every time the lid closes or opens, I created the file /etc/acpi/local/lid.sh.post with the following content:\nexport XAUTHORITY=`ls -1 /home/*/.Xauthority | head -n 1`\nexport DISPLAY=\":`ls -1 /tmp/.X11-unix/ | sed -e s/^X//g | head -n 1`\"\n\ngrep -q closed /proc/acpi/button/lid/*/state\nxinput set-int-prop 12 \"Device Enabled\" 8 $?\n\nXAUHTORITY and DISPLAY need to be set in order to allow root (who runs the acpid process) to access the user's X session.\n\nA: I would really like such a function aswell, but I have taken the habit from now on to disable the touchpad before closing the lid with the shortcut (Fn + F7 here, depends on make and model of laptop). Sure, this doesn't solve the problem at all, but it's a big start. If you don't have a keybind preset into your laptop, I'm quite sure there's a way to bind one manually.\n", "Q: Cannot adjust brightness on on an LG laptop with an Nvidia card I'm currently using a LG laptop with Nvidia Cuda GeForce GT 335M.\nI have difficulty adjusting the screen brightness using FN+Arrow Up/Arrow Down.

Check your /etc/resolv.conf file.\nfor example in my case when i had this problem & checked this file , the file was empty!\nbut it should contains your dns-nameserver\nmine:\nnameserver 192.168.10.x\n\n192.168.10.x is my gateway ip address\n\nA: Once upon a time I've met this exact issue — it was shipped with a container. Having wasted 15 minutes I finally realised it's due to wrongly set permissions for /etc/resolv.conf:\nroot@4ceb6b9e64bc:/usr/lib/apt# ls -l /etc/resolv.conf\n-rw-r-----+ 1 root root 19 Feb 24 06:05 /etc/resolv.conf\n\nThe fix is as trivial as chmod 644 of course.\n\nA: You can comment the unresolved repo from the file sources.list found on dir /etc/apt/\nAfter modifying  the sources.list, clean the apt-get repo as\napt-get clean\n\nThen update\napt-get update\n\nThe error will gone away\n\nA: The accepted solution does not work for me. In the first place, only apt-get update warns me about Temporary failure resolving 'foo.com', but when I try with nslookup foo.com or ping foo.com, it works fine!\nMy incredibly dirty hack/fix for solving this bug, is to add the resolved domains manually to /etc/hosts with this short script:\nresolveAptHosts()\n{\n    mapfile -t hosts < <(\n        sed -n -r '/^#/d; s;deb(-src)? (http://|ftp://)?([^/ ]+).*;\\3;p'\\\n        /etc/apt/sources.list | sort | uniq )\n    # delete all hosts from /etc/hosts, e.g., from an earlier call\n    sudo sed -i -r '/^[0-9]{1,3}(\\.[0-9]{1,3}){3}[ \\t]+('\"$( printf '|%s'\\\n        \"${hosts[@]//./\\\\.}\" | sed 's/^|//' )\"')[ \\t]*$/d' /etc/hosts\n    for host in ${hosts[@]}; do\n        ip=$( nslookup \"$host\" | sed -n -r 's|Address:[ \\t]*([0-9.]+).*|\\1|p' |\n              tail -1 )\n        sudo bash -c \"echo $ip $host >> /etc/hosts\"\n    done\n}\n\nNow updating should work:\nresolveAptHosts && sudo apt-get update\n\nIf anyone knows why this workaround works and how to solve this bug for real, I'll be eternally thankful. I also tried using sudo apt-get update -o Acquire::ForceIPv4=true in order to exclude IPv6 resolve problems, but that didn't help either.\n\nA: Note that this answer was written for old versions of Ubuntu. Current versions use a local nameserver controlled by D-Bus, for which the diagnosis part of this answer applies, but not the solution. If /etc/resolv.conf contains nameserver 127.0.1.1 or more generally nameserver 127.X.Y.Z, don't modify it.\n“Temporary failure resolving …” means that your DNS, i.e. the translation from host names to IP addresses, is not working. Did you reconfigure something on your machine recently? If not, this may be a transient error at your ISP.\nDoes ping -n 8.8.8.8 show lines like 64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: …? (Press Ctrl+C to stop ping.)\n\n\n*\n\n*If it doesn't, you specifically have an IP connectivity problem. Run traceroute -n 8.8.8.8 and see where it stops: if it's in your home/office, check your networking equipment. If you can reach your ISP, complain to them.\n\n*If it does, you specifically have a DNS problem. Check the contents of /etc/resolv.conf; there should be a line like nameserver 1.2.3.4 (possibly more than one of them). If the lines are there, there is probably a transient problem within your ISP, and you may be able to work around it by adding nameserver 8.8.8.8 to that file (this declares an extra DNS server, which is provided free of charge by Google). If the first number after nameserver is 127, then there is a DNS relay on your machine (this is a good thing), and you must configure that DNS relay rather than modify /etc/resolv.conf. On modern versions of Ubuntu, there is a DNS relay by default, it's Dnsmasq, and it's controlled by D-Bus.\n\n\nA: I experienced similar errors when running apt-get commands. It turns out I had the Software Update Panel open on the console.\nThis seemed to be blocking the command line apt-get, but I'm not certain.\n\nA: I had this error. Following a tip from Linode support, I commented out all the IPv6 lines in /etc/hosts and then apt-get update started working.\n\nA: For those who are using EC2, remember to check that your security group settings allow outbound connections to the websites you are updating from. You can set All traffic outbound setting and see if it works.\n\nA: I got the same issue in a vmware virtual machine, host and guest both are ubuntu.\nI solved the issue changing the setting of the virtual machine. Instead of using NAT, I set Bridged. \nIt worked for me \n\nA: one possible cause of the error messages is you do not have an internet connection.   You can see these same error messages if during initial ubuntu install you chose to not perform updates (did not connect to wifi/ethernet) which after install finished and you reboot can leave you at endless ubuntu login animation screen (watching those moving dots) ...  You will see above error messages if you now boot into Recovery and at root prompt issue apt-get update even after you enable networking from Recovery which does not allow you to connect to wifi if you avoided wifi during initial install.\nSolution to this particular edge case :  plug in an ethernet cable then boot into Recovery and issue apt-get update or else reinstall from scratch and assure you enable updates\ncore issue - if you did not connect to wifi during install so you avoided package updates you will not be given a wifi login prompt during Recovery boot - this should get fixed ... also above error messages should suggest possible cause being you do not have an internet connection\n\nA: Please check the hard-disk memory.\nMy memory was almost full and so I had this error, once memory is cleared I am able to do apt-get update\n\nA: Just adding another last case check. On my system for some reason when the system date was very out of sync then it resulted in the same dns resolution issues. I had a case where my date was somehow set to the year 2000. to check your date simply use the command date to make sure you are in sync.\n\nA: I'm currently experiencing this very same problem and none of the above solutions worked. I noticed that APT was attempting to download some DEB packages from br.archive.ubuntu.com, which redirects to ubuntu.c3sl.ufpr.br (IPv4 200.236.31.4), but this server is currently down.\nSo in my case what fixed the issue was to run Synaptic (install it with sudo apt install synaptic -y and then either run it with sudo synaptic or run it directly from the Applications panel), then click on Settings => Repositories => Ubuntu Software => Download from: and select Main server, then click on the Close button and finally click on the Reload button.\nIn my case, the above procedure caused APT to download the updated list of DEB packages from the main repository server archive.ubuntu.com instead of from the server located in my country.\n", "Q: Do any Ubuntu-based distributions ship with Unity?

When I move the starter from the dash to the launcher, it will be added but you cant see anything as the symbol of the starter is lost. The empty space that represents the launcher can be used to start the script. Any ideas how to keep the symbol?\n\nA: The icon that appears in the launcher is controlled by the .desktop file, mime type application/x-desktop, for that application. \nIn a .desktop there is a line item starting with \"Icon=\". that is where the location of the icon goes. Those desktop files are what you drag into the launcher. \nBy starter I can only assume you are actually talking about a .desktop file. Unfortunately the treatment of these .desktop files in Nautilus makes them difficult to edit. The displayed name isn't the actual file name and no editor is offered as an option to open the file. \nWhat you need to do is use a terminal window and cd to the folder with the .desktop file. The system keeps them in /usr/share/applications but I suggest you keep any you've changed in ~/.local/share/applications. Do an ls in the folder and you'll see the .desktop files listed with the file names you'll need to edit them, for example on the CLI gedit file.desktop. \nWhen you add your edited .desktop file to the launcher open the folder containing it and drag the file to the launcher. The .desktop files Nautilus shows in your .local folder may or may not be displayed as the application icon but as a generic text file with a .desktop name. \nThis is the process that works for me.\n\nA: Restart Unity by logging out and in again or just Alt+F2 unity --replace. Then the icon should be displayed.\n", "Q: How to open aMSN that has been minimised to the tray? I have problems maximizing apps like aMSN which closes into tray when I press the close (x) button. In a usual Gnome I would call it from the tray, but Gnome3 does not have it. \nSo, how should I maximize (bring to front) apps in Gnome3 that can be restored only via clicking on its tray icon?\n\nA: Any (well almost any) application that in previous versions minimised to the system tray notification area will still appear in the system-tray area of Gnome-Shell.  The location though is not immediately obvious - it is in the bottom-right of the screen.\n\nMove your mouse to the bottom-right to reveal this area - its an auto-hidden like panel.  Just click on any of the apps in the system-tray to make them reappear.\nAs you have pointed out aMsn when minimised seemingly disappears - this happens in both Gnome-Shell and Unity.\nTo stop this magical disappearing trick you can edit the file /home/your_username/.amsn/[your_email]/config.xml, search for use_tray and change the value from 1 to 0\nThis still doesnt allow aMsn to minimise to the correct area in the shell - but aMsn does appear as an open window when you click the Activities menu.\nNote in Unity - this trick allows aMsn to remain as an icon in the Launcher.\n\nIf you are not adverse to installing PPAs, then instead of the above you could install the classic-systray extension\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/gnome3\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gnome-shell-classic-systray\n\nLogout and login and enable the classic-tray extension in gnome-tweak-tool.\nLogout and login again.

I want to push the power button to save some energy, but as I'm not in her session, the computer doesn't respond.\nIs there a way to configure Ubuntu 11.10 to hibernate whenever the power button is pushed?\nI already applied this solution, but that only works inside a session.\n\nA: I don't know the answer to the specific question you asked, but you can set the computer to automatically suspend after a set idle time:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open \"System Settings\" from the power/gear menu (top right in Unity).\n\n*Click \"Power\"\n\n*Choose a suitable timeout.\nSuspend isn't quite the same as hibernate, and there's no manual \"do it now\" feature, but it'll still save you power.\n(Alternatively, you could log yourself in, and suspend it from your own session. Your SO would have to switch back to her own session when she returns.)\n\nA: After reading through Ubuntu's acpi setup, it seems like the issue is that when the login manager is running, there is no suitable handler running.  So, according to the nicely-commented /etc/acpi/powerbtn.sh, it defaults to just shutting down the computer.  You'd like to change this behavior?

I get an error that the system has a problem mounting / and do I want to Skip, Ignore, etc.  I choose Ignore and usually everything is OK.   I'm new to LINUX and Ubuntu.  This machine will eventually be run headless to boot automatically when power is turned on.  \nHow do I diagnose this or work around it?\n\nA: I don't know how to diagnose graphically. Hopefully someone else will add an answer addressing that.\nIs the problem linux related?\nTake careful note of where you see the error. If it happens before the bootloader (grub), then what you see is probably a BIOS error, not linux related. You may find the rest of the steps useful, but probably not. If it happens at grub or after, then linux is reporting the error. Continue with this guide.\nSearch the boot messages\nI would grep through dmesg to see any disk related errors. There are far better tutorials to get you up and running with linux commands, I recommend them over the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*dmesg prints the kernel ring buffer, which near as I've been able to figure out is all the important messages about what linux is doing. If there was a boot problem, it ought to show up here.\n\n*grep is a search utility. \n\n*Hard disks in linux these days are named \"sd\"+letter. Ie, my first sata disk is named sda, my second sata disk is named sdb..\n\n*The pipe character, | creates a flow of information by pouring the output of the preceding program into the following program. (Some programs like grep use the pipe symbol internally to mean OR).\nPut this together and you get:\ndmesg | grep \"sd[a-z]\"\ndmesg | grep \"mount\"\ndmesg | grep -E \"error|fail|warn\"\n\nIs there a problem post-boot?\nUse fdisk and df to get printouts of your current disk situation.\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo fdisk -l prints a list of disks and partitions.\n\n*df -h prints a list of mounted partitions and how much space is used vs available.\nDoes anything look weird? Are disks or partitions missing? Mis-sized? Do these programs report any errors?\n\nA: The problem is that the computer had no battery for the hardware clock so there was a mismatch on times even though it did get the time via the network.  I had loaded another Linux distribution on one of my other machines and it gave me an error message enough information to allow me to figure out how to check this.  I've not had the problem since I installed batteries in 3 of the machines.\n\nA: Whenever I've gotten that message, I found some error in /etc/fstab.  \nFor example, I started getting an error when I upgraded to 11.10 that I didn't get previously, when mounting one of my NTFS partitions; the last field (fs_passno) was set to \"2\", but since it was NTFS, and couldn't be checked, it needed to be set to \"0\".  I went to the trouble of booting the Windows XP install on the drive to check the partitions for errors, got the same error, then discovered the problem in fstab.\nSo, check fstab closely for the root partition entry.  Run the command:\nsudo blkid -c /dev/null \nto get all the UUIDs, then check them carefully with fstab's entries to make sure there are no mistakes.\n", "Q: How to apply webcam effects to other applications?

Root user on Ubuntu in general is locked so no user can login as root thus su is not likely to work.\nFor sudo -s to work you will have to be part of the admin group on an Ubuntu machine, which apparently you are not.\nIf you are the only user on the system that is concerning and may be quite involved to fix.

What are the problems or seem to be the problems related to wine and the use by default of pulseaudio in regards to sound in games executed via wine. This affects a whole range of users that use Ubuntu but want to still be able to play specific windows games.\n\nA: Latest update: Wine 1.7.55 adds proper PulseAudio support.\nThere isn't much of a problem at all these days.\nWhat you're describing was years ago.\nApplications under Wine only know how to talk to a Windows sound stack, so as with most of the other Windows subsystems, Wine provides this. The problem comes from our sound stack changing significantly in the last decade.\nOnce upon a time...\n... we only had OSS and ALSA. They provide predictable interfaces but they aren't easy to code to. It took Wine ages to get to a \"just works\" point with their ALSA support. The stack diagram was quite simple:\nHardware → ALSA → Wine/Win32-api → Windows app\n\nThe main problem with ALSA is it's notoriously finicky if you want more than one thing to play at once. Applications could accidentally lock it from others.\nThen PulseAudio got popular.\nSuddenly every desktop had this thing called PulseAudio. It was another layer between applications and ALSA to allow for many applications to make noise at once and add features like sound-over-network.\nBut Wine still only knew how to talk to ALSA, and there was now this PulseAudio thing hogging it right from boot. Wine's audio had to be piped through an ALSA compatibility layer into PulseAudio and then back out to ALSA. The stack shows how horrible this looks:\nHardware → ALSA → PulseAudio → ALSA emulator → Wine/Win32 → Windows app\n\nAdditionally the ALSA emulation layer (provided by PulseAudio) wasn't great. It would support a couple of channels and a few recording options but nowhere near as much as the ALSA that PulseAudio itself sat on top of.\nThe perceived problem was always \"the other guys' fault\"\nAudio in Wine didn't work. With hindsight it's easy to see where the problem really was but there were three opinions at the time that made Wine a real battleground:\n\n\n*\n\n*Users clamoured for Wine developers to add a native PulseAudio driver.\n\n*Wine developers didn't see why they should spend another age (and we're talking months and months of developer time) interfacing with yet another audio layer when they saw it as PulseAudio's problem for not providing a working ALSA interface. In their eyes people could just use pasuspender to get PA to release the lower-level ALSA for direct manipulation.\n\n*PulseAudio developers also suggested that Wine should pull their collective finger out and just add a PA driver. Dozens of other applications had, so why couldn't they? And every time I asked, the PulseAudio ALSA layer was fine, without bugs and it was just Wine developers' own bugs that were the problem.\n\n*A user wrote a hacked-in PulseAudio driver that spoke directly to Pulseaudio and did the bitmap audio conversion itself. Other users loved it because despite its hacks, it did often \"just work\" but Wine developers hated it because it was another large branch of code to maintain, and it was a hack.\nAnd then things got better.\nEverybody gave a little.\n\n\n*\n\n*Users stopped complaining as much.\n\n*Wine refactored to use the Windows Vista and Windows 7 approach to sound. They call this MMDevAPI. You can read all about MMDevAPI here. This strips out a ton of sound code and simplifies settings. It still uses ALSA though.\n\n*PulseAudio fixed bugs to allow Wine to work better.\n\n*WinePulse's development ceased when MMDevAPI started to show that it was working.\nAnd while it might seem like it, I doubt that's not the end of this story. There are commercially-supported projects like OpenAL and GStreamer that could really simplify Wine's sound stack as well as providing extra features.\nBut then years later, Wine 1.7.55 added mainline PulseAudio support...\nI've been writing this post for years and this is perhaps the weirdest thing yet. After dropping the PA driver development, somebody appears to have gone back to this and turned it into something real.\nMore than that, it got pulled in to the mainline version of Wine.\nIn an established prefix, just run wine regedit and change HKCU\\Software\\Wine\\Drivers\\Audio from alsa to pulse. Everything —including surround sound— seems to work. Here's the stack now:\nHardware → ALSA → PulseAudio → Wine/Win32-api → Windows app\n\nIs it any better than the ALSA compatibility layer? I'm still unsure. I've tried what I thought were some of the buggier games and they still skip around a bit.\nIt work though, which is the main thing... but so did the ALSA wrapper in the end.\n", "Q: Why is there a maximum hardware limit of 2048 pixels with multiple monitors \nAs seen in the image, trying to have the 2 displays side by side creates this problem. There is a 2048x2048 box limit. My question is, what creates this limit and why. What would happen if I try with 3 displays or with 2 huge ones. Even better, what would happened if I tried a single monitor at resolutions of 2560x1600 or 2560x2048.\nI see that it says \"Hardware Limit\". Does it mean the limit is made by the video card, all video cards, a specific monitor/tv or all monitors/tvs. This has always crossed my mind many times and since we are almost finished with 2011 (Happy Holidays and Happy New Years to all) I wanted to kick this doubt out of my mind so if someone else asks I can tell them.\n\nA: Sounds like a limit on the open source driver you are using for your video card. I had attempted the same at work and got the same error (although with a different max resolution size listed). Installing the proprietary drivers (ATI) I was able to get the screens side by side. \nAt home I have nVidia and already had the proprietary drivers installed when I added a second screen. Here is a screenshot of the display settings via the nVidia settings manager.\n\n\nA: Found the problem because of an Idea by Jester. In this case it is a hardware limit for this Intel card, although there are newer Intel video cards that limit this to 4096x4096. More info here: http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Xorg_RandR_1.2\nBut basically, depending on the video card is the limit of rendering/buffering of the screen.\nAnother source of information is here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_resolution about the resolution multipliers.\n\nA: If this may be to some help to you, i know it has been caused by an intel driver that had failure in the pas\n", "Q: Cannot boot after hard reset. begin running scripts init-bottom Ok I'm currently running 11.10 amd64 and I have had to reformat at least 7 times in the last two weeks. Any time I have to do a hard reboot Ubuntu will no longer boot (sometimes). Other times it initially wont want to boot but after a few tries it will. This time it wont boot at all.\nIf I remove quiet splash from grub then I can see the it is locking up at \"begin running scripts init-bottom done\". Part of what is causing this issue is that Ubuntu will not shut down properly on my computer, most of the time it will just hang on shutdown or reboot. But in this case I was playing a game in wine and the game froze so I reset. \nThe only thing I have tried is nomodeset. I'm not sure what to do at this point this is really not good, I had some work I needed to get done today. Like I said this is not the first time this has happened either.

The problem was pySDM, I had 3 different NTFS disks set to auto-mount on boot and apparently Ubuntu didn't like it. However I had previously tried a few other methods to auto-mount the same disks and it all ended the same way. I never had a problem in any previous version of Ubuntu. But either way I just left well enough alone and I don't mount the disks on boot anymore and the problem has gone away completely, as did my issue with shutting down as well.\n", "Q: Is there a plain KDE version without all the KDE applications available for Ubuntu?

I have a situation where I have 2 (old) 80 GB harddrives (yep, PATA 133 MB/sec) on an older VIA mini-ITX board. I am running Ubuntu 10.04 LTS. The system is installed on the first drive, using ext4. I am planing to use the second drive for data (a total of exact 68.2 GB research data distrubuted on 370 individual files). I need fast reading access to this data, but once the data is there, I will never need to change it.\nI am no expert in the implementation of file-systems and drivers for them, but my basic assumption is that there might be something to gain (in efficiency) by using a file-system (as basic as possible) that only give me the most fundamental reading capabilities of the disk, but as fast as possible. In my scenario, creating the file-system itself, would require access to an original source to copy it from (another mounted volume).\nImportantly, I do NOT need compression, since my files are already compressed (zip). I could try SquashFS and I probably will, but are there other options?\nOr have I again made things complicated and we are just talking ext2/ext3/ext4 with read-only privileges?\nThanks.\n\nA: You could also try romfs, but I doubt you will find it any faster than ext4.  I'd suggest you just stick with ext4 and not worry about it.  Mounting it read only also won't gain you any performance; just make sure you don't accidentally modify the files.\n", "Q: Removing PPAs to proceed with update manager seems risky After failing to update 11.10, I found a non-working PPA source, which was some guy's repository, containing software that I didn't manually install. \nHow do I know the consequences of deactivating this source and most likely, leaving this update at its current state for a long time? \nWhy can't update manager just forget about that PPA temporarily and try to update it next time?\nIs there a way to save time and stop caring about OS internal components?\n\nA: If you're doing an upgrade of Ubuntu from one major release to the next the update manager will deactivate all your system's PPAs before attempting an upgrade. \nYour comment to Agmenor's question sort of answers your question. If the PPA is not being updated, then it's probably not useful to you and you can just remove it; or worse it's being unmaintained and can just be removed.\n\nA: Deactivating the PPA should normally not bring any problem. Just deactivate it in the Software Sources, the developper will probably make sure his or her PPA will work with your version of Ubuntu.\nThere may be some risk if it was a PPA for unstable software. To determine it, you could read the info on the PPA page or give the PPA address here so that we can determine it. In that case you may want for example to downgrade these precise programs to stable versions.\nCould you also edit your question to give more details on how you think this software source was included in your other ones?\n", "Q: Edimax EW-7811Un USB Wirless Adapter Stopped Working After buying an Edimax EW-7811Un wirless adapter, I managed to get it working on my Ubuntu 11.10 system by following the solution described here.\nThis was working great until about a week ago when the adapter suddenly stopped working altogether. This happened after I installed a set of system updates on the 24th of December, so I suspect the updates either altered the driver or affected something the driver depends on.\nI tried to re-apply the previous solution and found that Realtek have since released an update to the driver, so I tried installing this latest version and removed the driver from the modprobe blacklist (the blacklisting was part of the original solution).\nI wasn't able to make the changes to the source code described in the original solution as the relevant code has since moved on and the lines I changed in the last version have now been commented out.\nThis got me to a point where I could connect to a network if I inserted the adapter after I'd logged into the system (logging in with the adapter already inserted caused the driver to get stuck in a loop, failing to connect and then re-trying), but after a few minutes the connection stopped working (I couldn't reach any other host), even though the taskbar widget reported that I was still connected to the wireless network.\nAny suggestions would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: The latest realtek driver doesn't require those changes, since, according to the release notes, the support for kernel 3.0.2 has been added.

I installed xrdp.  I launch the Windows remote desktop client and login in.  I then get prompted for the user name and password.  \nIt then logs in, but all I see is the background, no menus, nothing.  I have to kill remote desktop by closing it.  \nEven if I right click , nothing.  Any ideas???\nThe only reason I even went down the RDP road was that VNC would not work either, even after I enabled desktop sharing.  I am in a bind as I need to connect to Ubuntu via Windows.  In version 8 Ubuntu this was not an issue and it just worked.\n\nA: Try this.  Just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nsudo apt-get install gnome-session-fallback\necho “gnome-session -–session=gnome-fallback” > ~/.xsession\nsudo /etc/init.d/xrdp restart\n\n\nA: You might still have another desktop manager in your .xsession config.\ncd /home/youruser\necho \"gnome-session --session=ubuntu-2d\" > .xsession\nsudo /etc/init.d/xrdp restart\n\nI've had a similar issue and this solved it.\n\nA: I had to do the following before it worked:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install xfce4 and configure .xsession to \"xfce4-session\" as per Paul Rosenberg's reply above.\n\n*Fix a permissions problem with /etc/xrdp/ that caused the following error in /var/log/xrdp.log:\n[ERROR] Cannot read private key file /etc/xrdp/key.pem: Permission denied\n\nI added user xrdp to ssl-cert group, not sure if this is the best workaround though.\n\nA: For future readers of this post (I found this post top of my Google search when I had the same problem), xrdp no longer seems to work with Ubuntu-2d in Ubuntu 14.04. Instead you must install xfce\nsudo apt-get install xfce4\nThen add the line\nxfce4-session\nto your ~/.xsession file instead of the gnome-session --session=ubuntu-2d line\n\nA: If I understood you correctly, you have Win 7 machine (rdp client) and ubuntu 11.10 (rdp server).\nIf you have unity 3d enabled in ubuntu, that will cause problems. Use gnome session fallback:\nsudo apt-get install gnome-session-fallback\n\n(you have to log out and select \"gnome classic no effects\")\n..or xubuntu (xfce) :\nsudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop\n\n..or lubuntu (lxde):\nsudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop\n\n\nAlso, try using rdesktop from command line. Looks like xrdp and other rdp gui programs don't support rdesktop's full capabilities, so it's best to use the command line directly.\nrdesktop -h\n\n\n\nA: Add a backslash in front of your login, like: \\yourlogin\nThis made it work for me. It removes the domain from your credential.\n\nA: A limitation of the xrdp is that you can only login to desktop:0\nI was logged in on the target machine as well as trying to connect.  Once I logged out of the server I was able to login.\n\nA: For 20.04 black screen issue is being fixed by adding gnome-session or xfce4-session to ~/.xsession file.\nIn my case I has been successfully logged in into gnome-session:\n$ cat ~/.xsession\ngnome-session\n\n\nA: This is more of a workaround, but if you get a blank desktop, then there might be a question on the remote Ubuntu computer asking whether to refuse or allow. Just click the allow button from the alert.\n\nA: Try a different desktop manager.  While using lightdm I was getting a blank/black screen via XRDP.

You can minimize the size of this fingerprint by being behind a well-administered firewall, reducing the number of services your machine runs, running services on non-standard ports, editing version strings, etc, etc.  \nThen there's the fingerprint of the IP address your ISP has assigned you. TOR (see previous answer) can help with that, but with a sufficiently detailed examination, one might be able to see a 47.853GB download of a forbidden document from some evil website to a TOR node, AND one might be able to see a 47.853GB encrypted file from some TOR nodes to your IP, and draw conclusions.  \nThen there's the fingerprint  your browser presents to the sites you visit (via TOR or not). The PanoptiClick project of the Electronic Frontier Foundation https://www.eff.org/\n to see how unique your browser configuration and add-ons are.  \nThen there are actual fingerprints - wear thick gloves.  \nFirst, consider what you want to secure, then from whom (well, really, do a Threat and Risk Assessment), and figure out how much effort/time/money it will take to secure it. Is your \"fingerprint\" your machine provides to snooping parties on the internet, really the highest risk? \n\nA: You might be referring to Tor, which is a way to use the Internet anonymously.  The website for information about Tor is here.  The site describes Tor: \n\n\"Tor is a network of virtual tunnels that allows people and groups to\n  improve their privacy and security on the Internet. It also enables\n  software developers to create new communication tools with built-in\n  privacy features. Tor provides the foundation for a range of\n  applications that allow organizations and individuals to share\n  information over public networks without compromising their privacy.\"\n\nIt was originally developed for use by the U.S. Navy, but now is used by many other agencies, businesses, and individuals.\nThe method is described in this way:\n\n\"The idea is similar to using a twisty, hard-to-follow route in order\n  to throw off somebody who is tailing you — and then periodically\n  erasing your footprints. Instead of taking a direct route from source\n  to destination, data packets on the Tor network take a random pathway\n  through several relays that cover your tracks so no observer at any\n  single point can tell where the data came from or where it's going.\"\n\nOf course, there is much more information on that page, and if it is of interest, you ought to read up about it; there is a lot to learn and understand.  There are also links to download Tor and set it up at the site.\n\nA: If you change your TTL nmap won't recognize your OS, as reported here. You can do it with the following command:\necho \"net.ipv4.ip_default_ttl = 64\" >> /etc/sysctl.conf\n\n", "Q: Creating a deb package that can be used by Lucid, Natty and newer versions of Ubuntu I don't even know if it's possible. If I need to create separated packages, please explain why.\n\nA: You will need to create separate packages.  This is because of the potential of different library versions being required in various versions of Ubuntu.\nAs well, when you build the packages into the binaries, it will be building only for the libraries available within that version of Ubuntu.\nSubsequently, this is why in debian/changelog you are only allowed to specify one version of Ubuntu at a time on the version line (for example: rkhunter (1.3.8-7~natty1~ppa1) natty; urgency=low - note the natty part changes to maverick, lucid, oneiric, hardy, etc.)\nTake a look at the files in my rkhunter backports PPA: https://launchpad.net/~trekcaptainusa-tw/+archive/rkhunter  Feel free to see what the changelog entries show, and how I named the package version numbers (you can omit the ~ppa# part at the end, but you should append the version of ubuntu to the package names if you're building for more than one version of Ubuntu, and then build each separately).\nEDIT\nTo better see what I mean, I urge you to compare the actual debian/control files, and the debian/changelog files for the version of rkhunter in my PPA (for Lucid), and compare that to the source version in Oneiric's repos right now, you'll notice the change(s) that had to be done in order to get it to build in Lucid (such changes are common, so when building for Natty, for instance, you'll be specifying newer package versions than in Lucid or Maverick or others.  The same is said for building for Oneiric, and backporting to Natty, you sometimes have to specify different versions of build dependencies, among other things, for the older version(s) of Ubuntu)\n", "Q: Physical Wifi button broken, Ubuntu does not show the wifi, can it be bypassed?

This is probably as a result of either switching off via the BIOS, or more likely, the broken physical switch is in the off position meaning no operating system will see the wireless device.\nI'm afraid, no software will help you here - you'll need to find a way of by-passing the hardware switch, which may be as simple as:\n\n\n*\n\n*checking if the wireless card with disabled in the BIOS\n\n*finding another \"spring\" and \"button\" off a third party computer spares, or even (more dramatically) \n\n*getting the soldering iron out and ensuring the wireless contact is made permanently on.\n\n", "Q: When installing or booting from USB flash drive screen goes blank When I was installing Ubuntu 11.10 64-bit on my new PC from a flash drive since the only computers I have do not have disk drives, I ran into a problem.\nAfter the ASUS logo when switching on the PC, and pressing F8 to select the USB flash drive, there was the options thing as normal that allows me to select to either boot form the flash drive or install on the HDD, when I do either of these, there is a bunch of text on a black background, as I would expect, but after a few seconds the screen goes blank and the monitor says No signal.\nI have previously installed Ubuntu with a flash drive to fix issues caused my Windows and ran into no problems.\nIs it a problem with the pen drive I am using?\nOr maybe a problem with the system?\nI tried it in my USB 3.0 ports at the back and the USB 2.0 ones as well.\nMy Specs are: \n  AMD Phenom II x4 965BE\n  ASUS AMD Radeon HD 6670\n  ASUS M5-L75 USB3 (typing this from memory, it's an AM3+ ASUS board with USB3.0 in the AMD700 chipet or something)\n  Corsair XMS3 DDR3 4GB(2x2GB) 1333MHz RAM  \nI ran the memtest program on the flash drive as well, and it came out clean.\n\nA: Try the option of \"nomodeset\"\nThe newest kernels have moved the video mode setting into the kernel. So all the programming of the hardware specific clock rates and registers on the video card happen in the kernel rather than in the X driver when the X server starts.. This makes it possible to have high resolution nice looking splash (boot) screens and flicker free transitions from boot splash to login screen. Unfortunately, on some cards this doesnt work properly and you end up with a black screen. Adding the nomodeset parameter instructs the kernel to not load video drivers and use BIOS modes instead until X is loaded.\nPress any key at that moment to access a menu.

Using the EASEUS Partition Master I've revert it to basic disk type. \n\nA: From what I see on your report it looks like you used WUBI to install your version of Ubuntu, but from the USB. There is a MBR Bootloader error on Sda7. This is where Ubuntu resides and Wubi is present. Because of this error your unable to boot into Windows.\nWUBI stands for Windows Based Ubuntu Installer which is used to install Ubuntu literally within the Windows NTFS file system. In fact there is no partitioning involved as the Ubuntu OS resides within the Windows NTFS directory as a folder. \nSomewhere along the lines WUBI didn't finish completing the Grub entry or something\nYou'll need to repair Windows first by popping in your Windows CD...then going to the Repair Windows selection. Then afterwards perform a chkdsk. This should correct the issue.\n\nA: Try tot do this: boot repair. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair\n\nA: You can use the Wubi Method Of Installation for installing Ubuntu alongside Windows. It is just an easy method. In this method:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the downloaded ISO file.\n\n*Run Wubi.exe.\n\n*Select the relevant options on the Ubuntu Installer Window that open.\n\n*Select \"Reboot Now\" and Click Finish.\n\n\nFor more details visit this link. \n", "Q: How do I pin a trash bin to the GNOME Shell Activities overview?

This is a non recommended configuration from the security point of view, but if your bandwidth is limited ...\nCheck also for applications like Ubuntu One, Dropbox or some other cloud sync applications which may consume your bandwidth. \nAlso some facebook.twiter.twenty clients may be looking for new posts and messages too much frequently. \nAlso check if you have an email client configured to download the emails.\nHope this helps\nP.S.: Sorry for the long explanation but I can not upload pictures \n\nA: Another way to limit your bandwidth usage is to block all internet traffic, except for the apps you specifically want. I did this by creating a new group, limiting all internet outgoing traffic to that group, then starting a shell with that group access. Only apps started from this shell can then access the internet. I blogged about it here: https://plus.google.com/118226948467140990198/posts/YZhZJCZmGgm\n", "Q: How do I get Ubuntu to ignore power button presses? I've got a small media server that sits under my TV, and it runs Ubuntu 11.04 desktop x64 with XBMC on top. I've got a problem in that unknowing users / visitors occasionally press the power button 'just to see what happens'. Ubuntu dutifully intercepts this and either sleeps or halts. \nThis is really annoying.\nOne possible option is to just disconnect the power button from the motherboard, as I've done with the reset button. However, I'd still like to be able to power it back on if I choose to halt it myself, for whatever reason, or if it completely locks up.\nHow can I get Ubuntu to effectively 'ignore' people randomly prodding at the power button while it's turned on?\n\nA: Bruno Pereira has made a thorough post about the power button and how to customize the actions.\nIn short:\nBy using dconf-editor (either you'll have it or you'll need to install it) and navigate to org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/power and choose power-button as blank.\n", "Q: How to move all files in current folder to subfolder? I am at the path:\n/myuser/downloads/\n\nAnd I create a sub folder:\n/myuser/downloads/new\n\nNow I want to move all files and folders/sub-folders in the downloads folder to the sub-folder.\nhow can I do this?\nI tried:\nmv -R *.* new/\n\nBut move doesn't take the -R switch it seems.\n\nA: I found something like this but is a bit simpler to understand, and it might work well for you too:\nls | grep -v new | xargs mv -t new\n\nAdding an explanation to the above solution:\nFrom man pages:\n\n\n*\n\n*mv -t\n-t, --target-directory=DIRECTORY\n      move all SOURCE arguments into DIRECTORY\n\n\n*grep -v\n-v, --invert-match\n      Invert the sense of matching, to select non-matching lines.\n\nExplained by step:\n\n\n*\n\n*ls will list the files in current directory\n\n*grep -v new will return piped to that is not match new\n\n*xargs mv -t new will move the files piped to it from grep -v to the target directory\n\n\nA: Just use mv * subdir1 and ignore the warning.\nYou can just use mv * subdir1. You will see a warning message relating to trying to move subdir1 into itself, like this: \nmv: cannot move 'subdir1' to a subdirectory of itself, 'subdir1/subdir1'\n\nBut it will move all of the other files and directories to subdir1 correctly.\nAn example: \n$ ls\n$ mkdir dir1 dir2 dir3      \n$ touch file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt\n$ mkdir subdir1\n$ ls\n#=> dir1  dir2  dir3  file1.txt  file2.txt  file3.txt  subdir1\n$ mv * subdir1\n#=> mv: cannot move 'subdir1' to a subdirectory of itself, 'subdir1/subdir1'\n$ ls\n#=> subdir1\n$ ls subdir1\n#=> dir1  dir2  dir3  file1.txt  file2.txt  file3.txt\n\n\nA: The command\nmv !(new) new\n\nshould do the trick. If it doesn't work, run shopt -s extglob first.\nTo also move hidden files/directories (that beginning with a dot), run also shopt -s dotglob first.\nSo, to sum up:\nshopt -s extglob dotglob\nmv !(new) new\nshopt -u dotglob\n\n(it is always better to unset dotglob to avoid bad surprises).\n\nA: Simple idea. Assuming you are in /myuser, rename downloads to new, create a new downloads directory then move new into it.\nmv downloads new # downloads is now called new\nmkdir downloads # create new directory downloads\nmv new downloads # move new into it.\n\n\nA: If you want to move all the files from a folder to one of its subfolders you can use the following command:\nfind /myuser/downloads/ -type d -name 'new' -prune -type f | xargs mv -t /myuser/downloads/new\n\nIt will find all the files and then move them to your subfolder.\n@waltinator: added -type d -name 'new' -prune to prevent traversal of /myuser/downloads/new. \n\nA: You can try this alternative process –– remain in the path\n/myuser/downloads/\n\nbut, instead of first creating the /myuser/downloads/new/ directory, instead create a folder in the /myuser/ directory, with the command mkdir ../new, then move all the files in downloads to new, and finally move new into downloads. You can do this in one line, while in the /myuser/downloads/ path, with the command:\nmkdir ../new && mv * ../new && mv ../new ../downloads\n\nIn this case, you don't have to worry about any sort of \"filtering\" of files/folders, since new is on the same level of the path as downloads, so you can just move everything in downloads to new, and then move new into downloads`.\nHowever, if you already have the subfolder new created and don't want to create another one, not to worry –– just change the mkdir command on the left-hand side of the first && in the command shown above to an mv command, pushing new up in the path; in other words, while you're still in /myuser/downloads/, you can change mkdir ../new to mv new ... Then the subfolder new [in the path /myuser/downloads/new/] gets pushed up to /myuser/new/, at the same level as /myuser/downloads/, and then you can run the rest of the command as it is shown above. All together, we have, starting from the path /myuser/downloads/:\nmv new .. && mv * ../new && mv ../new ../downloads\n\nand, since you wanted to \"move all files and folders/sub-folders in the downloads folder to the sub-folder [new]\", you're done! If you had wanted to move only files (or only folders or [insert more granular object movement]), then you'd have to use other commands that can \"filter\" objects, such as grep. The commands written above are sufficient for your purposes, though.\n", "Q: Is switching to Raster graphic system speeding up KDE4?

I have a bunch of laptops I need to set up for our support dept and I need to be able to access/monitor them at all times. The laptops run ubuntu 11.10 gnome shell 3.2 and all have the desktop sharing thing enabled along with a password. This all works, I can connect to the laptops and view them and interact with them.\nNow, from what I've read, that password thing ain't the most sophisticated security measure out there so I'm looking for a secure upgrade for this setup, preferably one that doesn't need too much changes on their end. I've read up on implementing ssh, but that is if I want to log on to a dormant account not when I want to just bomb the existing user session.\n\nA: Ssh allows you to start a new (separate) text login, but that's not the only thing you can do with it. It also allows you to do things like tunnel internet, tunnel a port, and start a graphical program in that new text login and have that program show up on the local computer but run on the remote one. All of this is encrypted, so it it safe to send confidential things like passwords over it. \nAlso, do realize that on a Linux machine, it is possible for a user to be logged in multiple times. (This seemed so cool when I first came from Windows).\nVNC sends passwords unsafely, which means that it is possible that someone could listen in on your connection and then use the password they hear to login themselves!\nSo, the general idea is to use ssh to securely connect and start a new text login that you basically don't use. Then you tell ssh to also tunnel the port for VNC, which means that the VNC is wrapped in the ssh encryption so no one will hear your password. When you connect to the remote VNC server, it show the graphical login, not the text one.\nHow to do this:\nyou run something like\nssh <monitoredusername>@<monitoredcomputeripaddress> -L <randomportabove1024>:localhost:<monitoredcomputer'svncserverport>\n\nThis will magically make the monitored computer's VNC server \"appear\" on your local computer at . Then you can do \nvncviewer localhost:<randomportabove1024>\n\nto login.\n", "Q: Is mplayer multi-threaded? There's a post in mplayer's site from 2011-03-26, i.e. March 26, saying that mplayer is multi-threaded. So this is several months before Oneiric was released. Does this mean that the stock mplayer I get from \"sudo apt-get install mplayer\" in Ubuntu Oneiric is multithreaded, and I don't need to compile from SVN, or compile mplayer-mt, or do anything special?\n\nA: In 11.10 you probably will need to add an option, either per cli or to ~/.mplayer/config, \"-lavdopts threads=X\" where X = the number of threads, (1-8, default is 1\nEx. for 2, in cli\n-lavdopts threads=2\n\nor in ~/.mplayer/config\nlavdopts=threads=2\n\nmplayer2, which is also available in 11.10, should do  mt by default\nYou can check in either htop or thru the use of mpstat, part of the sysstat package (man mpstat) as to whether mt is happeneing\nif you use the above parameter it may show up in terminal, (does with mplayer2, may not with mplayer)  as in  - \n==========================================================================\nOpening video decoder: [ffmpeg] FFmpeg's libavcodec codec family\nAsking decoder to use 2 threads if supported.\nSelected video codec: [ffh264] vfm: ffmpeg (FFmpeg H.264)\n==========================================================================\nI prefer mplayer2 though either should treat you ok.\n\nA: The man page for mplayer reveals this little snippet:\n\nLooking at the launchpad build logs - it is compiled with pthread - this is needed to make a multithreaded application.\nTaken together - I would deduce that the version of mplayer in oneiric is multithreaded.... but you need to specify the number of threads to decode mpeg/h.264 because the default is one thread.\n\nA: As far as I know, the mplayer in 11.10 is multithreaded and you don't have to do anything.\n", "Q: Why is NaCL disabled for Chromium? I would like to test NaCL with the Chromium I installed from the software center, however it seems to have been disabled for an unclear reason.\nhttp://www.ubuntuupdates.org/packages/show/378128\n\n[ Fabien Tassin ]\n    * Disable NaCl until we figure out what to do with the private toolchain\n    - update debian/rules\n\nIs anyone aware what this means and how it came to be that this was reason for disabling NaCL for the base, the updates and even daily builds?\n\nA: As of Chromium 16, there are currently build issues with NaCl on Ubuntu. I believe this has something to do with compiling Chromium with the Debian security hardening wrapper. A bunch of launchpad bugs have been filed semi-related to this, but I think LP#882942 is the main one triaged to NaCl on Chromium.\nUnfortunately this means if you want to use NaCl in Ubuntu, you must install the official Google Chrome build.\n", "Q: Why can't I copy files to a USB drive partitioned by GParted? I just formatted a brand-new USB external hard drive with a single ext4 partition using GParted. I want to back up my files so I can do a fresh install of Oneric on my only machine. Natty mounted the new partition and I can see the \"lost+found\" directory, but I cannot copy files to the drive - I get \"Permission denied\".\nIf I ll /media, I see:\ndrwxr-xr-x  3 root root 4096 2011-12-31 10:00 MyDisk/\n\nI have a very limited understanding of permissions, but is the lack of 'w' permission on the \"others\" class what's preventing me from copying my files? I'm tempted to try chmod o+w MyDisk, but would that apply to others on a different system, or just my current one (I need to copy files from the disk after installing Oneric)? Same question with root ownership - is that \"root\" on my current system only, or root on any system I connect the drive to?\nEven if my thinking is way off, why doesn't GParted make the drive writable to my user account by default?\n\nA: What it says there is that the owner of the disk is root.\nSo you will need to change the permissions. Since it's ext4 the permissions are stored on the disk. It's not odd GParted made it read-only except for root because ext4 is not commonly used for USB drives. It seems GParted assumed it is most likely you would use ext4 for an operating system, for which it would be best to only have root access to the root of the partition.\nIt will always be possible to mount the drive and use the root user from a different computer to change the permissions.\n\nA: If you cd to the drive in a terminal you can run sudo chmod 777 . which will completely open up the permissions for the current directory (the USB drive) and then you are free to add files as normal.\n", "Q: Firefox uploads images sideways When uploading images to Ebay etc firefox rotates the image sideways every time the image is portrait view, this happens immediately in the upload file dialogue box and I cannot find a solution, for Ebay I must be able to upload the images correctly. \n\nA: Option one: \nSet Shotwell's preferences to write metadata (like rotation) to the files. Shotwell is a non-destructive editor by default.  \nEdit/Preferences/ then check the box like below.  \n \nNow, when you rotate the change will be persistent, even on other computers.  \nOption two: \n\n\n*\n\n*Open any image from the file browser (you can right-click and choose 'Open With Image Viewer').  \n\n*Use the arrow tool on the tool bar to rotate the image.  \n \n\n\n*\n\n*Close the Image Viewer window, you will be prompted to save the change.

In this case, you would need to rotate the image before you upload it. To do this, go to where the image is saved and open it with the image viewer (if it is not the first item on the right click menu, you can do this by right clicking, then going to the open with submenu, and selecting image viewer.) In the image viewer, there should be buttons near the top in the toolbar for rotating the image 90 degrees either way. With my icon theme, they look like a circular arrow with a dot in the middle. Click the correct one, and then close the image viewer. You will be asked if you want to save the changes. Click Save. Your image should now be rotated correctly and you can upload it with firefox.\n", "Q: get rid of flat menu (without hierarchy) in gnome-shell In gnome-shell, menus on the top panel are flat -- submenu is not displayed on the side, as it used to be, but is opened in the upper level:\n\nIs there a way to change the behavior back?

It opens fine and the functions are all present... except the pressure sensitivity.  I suspect it's more than likely that SAI doesn't know how to interpret the native Wacom drivers.  My Paint appears to be lacking in some useful features that are part of my workflow, and GiMP hasn't impressed me much as a tool for illustration; if possible I'd prefer to use this particular program.\nAs of current, I was considering installing the Bamboo drivers into winetricks, but I'm not in any way certain that this is sound.  Is this a feasible solution to this issue, or should I try another workaround?\n\nA: I know it's an old question, but since the issue is still not solved by Wine, people will probably be still googling what to do, so...\nI've asked people at PlayOnLinux to make a special Wine build with the fixed pen pressure issue. So, what you need to do is:\n\n\n*\n\n*install PlayOnLinux\n\n*go to Tools->Manage Wine Versions and install the version named \"1.5.5-SAI\"\n\n*go to File->Install->Install a non-listed program and install SAI\n\n*in PlayOnLinux, select SAI, click Configure, then under Wine Version, select 1.5.5-SAI\n\n*in PlayOnLinux, select SAI again, click Open the directory, open file misc.ini, change TabletMouseSimulation = 0 to TabletMouseSimulation = 1 (otherwise the pen will twitch about on it's own)\n\n*in PlayOnLinux, select SAI and click play :) Pen pressure should work now.\n\n\nHope this helps :)\n\nA: http://wiki.winehq.org/TabletSupport should be having most up to date information\n", "Q: upgraded by the book 11.04 to 11.10.

How do I install Need for Speed World? \nPlease don't just say \"use wine\", I am a newbie and I need a detailed way to install it (Step by Step).\nI use Ubuntu 11.10.\n\nA: I don't think Need for Speed World can be run on Ubuntu, at least not without difficulties.

However, wine itself has a community that is suitable for those types of things. \nFor Need for Speed World, you can look here.\n\nA: this doesn't work in Ubuntu because Ubuntu doesn't support the functions that the game need to work/run, and wine doesn't neither.... so there's only four things to do....\nA) wait until need for speed world is supported by Ubuntu\nB) switch to windows\nC) run windows in virtual-box \nD) or don't play it any at all\n", "Q: Save virtualbox vm state before logout I'm using oneiric with unity.

I want to know should it work ok with Ubuntu and proprietary drivers. \nAnd my computer has an AMD APU Processor, which has GPU + CPU in one. But can i be sure it uses the HD 6450 card, not the integrated GPU from CPU.\n\nA: ATi have official Linux drivers for it so I imagine it works fine\nSource: http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/Pages/index.aspx\n\nA: All radeon HD cards \"work\" with Ubuntu in the sense that you can use them to display graphics using at least one driver (vesa would be the worst case scenario), but maybe you wanted to ask if 3d acceleration will be supported?\nAs for knowing which GPU is used, I would first visit the BIOS as there may well be some options in there that are relevant to this question. Second, you can run lspci and lspci -v from the command line to see what PCI(e) devices are seen by the operating system.\nFinally, I would look at the X11 server log file (/var/log/Xorg.0.log generally) to see what devices the server found and initialized.\n\nA: I can confirm the Biostar Radeon HD6450 pcie (DVI+VGA+HDMI) works fine with Ubuntu 12.04; u get OpenGL accel along with desktop effects (compiz) and tested with UrbanTerror to verify proper 3D gaming.Although I couldnt make the card works with an HDMI tv, DVI output is ok.\n", "Q: Can I view text files i've synced to Ubuntu One online? I am able to sync and see my file names online and on all my devices, but how can I simply view sync'd text files online, or, say, on my mobile phone (which has the Ubuntu One app installed).\n\nA: You should be able to open the file from any device by visiting the Ubuntu One website and simply clicking the file. Also, if you want others to be able to read it, you can Publish the file. Then it'll get a normal URL that you can use to access the content. \n", "Q: Rsync permission issues via SSH I am backing up a networked server via SSH.

Once I log in through Rsync, the backup just starts and there is no way to issue the sudo command. I understand that I can use the Rsync daemon to get around this, but I would like to use SSH without the daemon for the sake of simplicity. Does anyone know a way to accomplish this? Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: I believe the issue is you are taking 'sudo' on the local box and not on the remote server. I have not verified this, but a structure like the following should work:\nrsync -R -avz -e ssh --rsync-path=\"echo mypassword | \\\n    sudo rsync\" /media/backup1/ubuntubackup ubuntu@*******:/ /media/backup1/ubuntubackup\n\n", "Q: How to send e-mail from Ubuntu server? What I'm supposed to do is send emails from Ubuntu. The easiest way I have found is using Thunderbird and linking my real e-mail address (abc@hotmail.com) to Thunderbird account.\nI can successfully receive e-mails and download full history this way. I can't send e-mails, however.\nWhat I want to do is send e-mails straight from Ubuntu and appear as user1@localhost or something similar.\nIs that even possible? After reading different topics about this, It seems that using a relay address is the only way.\nI have also installed Postfix, same way as written there:\nHow to set up a mail server?\nWhen I was asked to choose installation type, I chose Internet site.\nOptions I had:\n\n\n*\n\n*No configuration;\n\n*Internet site;\n\n*Internet with smarthost;\n\n*Stellite system;\n\n*Local only;\n\n\nWhen asked for system mail name, I entered a website I own: some_website.com .\nI still haven't figured out how to send emails bia postfix but I assume that again a relay-server will be used.\nI'm running Ubuntu 11.10 as a virtual machine.\nI hope this question makes sense.\n\nA: It does not make perfect sense because you have said, \"supposed to do,\" as though it is your job. Are you setting up a real mail server within a virtual machine? I take the  clues to mean that you need the virtual server to have a mail system, but that the virtual server is not a full-time \"real\" SMTP server. (Otherwise you would know already, I guess wildly.)\nWith that in mind, you would need the \"Internet with smarthost\" option. Essentially, the big reason is that well-configured SMTP servers around the world all use anti-spam measures; and, among these measures is the rejection of all SMTP connections that come from known pools of dynamic addresses (that spammers love to use). Therefore, you need to use another SMTP server for outgoing mail.\nIf you want to stick with Postfix for this, it is easy to do: just search for Ubuntu articles related to setting up Postfix as a smarthost. However, if you have no particular affinity for one system over another, there is a package designed just for this: ssmtp. So, if you want to give it a spin, then just install ssmtp.\n(Caution: the action below will remove postfix or sendmail.)\nsudo apt-get install ssmtp\n\nThen edit the ssmtp configuration file:\nsudo -e /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf\n\nI do not know details of an SMTP server available to you, so I will give a GMail example:\nRoot=your_email@gmail.com\nMailhub=smtp.gmail.com:465\nRewriteDomain=gmail.com\nAuthUser=your_gmail_username # me@gmail.com\nAuthPass=your_gmail_password\nFromLineOverride=Yes\nUseTLS=Yes\n\nNow your system will send mail the way you want. You can use localhost as a mail server in your GUI applications for the outgoing SMTP server. But what about the CLI? Use the mail software:\nsudo apt-get install heirloom-mailx\n\nNow you can also use mail from the command line with something like:\nmail < filename.ascii someone@somewhere.com -s \"My File\"\n\nOr, if you use mail to compose a message you type (mail someone@somewhere.com), then finish off the mail message with a single period on a blank line. A better CLI mail client is mutt or pine.\nIs this the angle you needed? If so, was it successful?\n\nA: If you are using Thunderbird, you can configure a remote server for SMTP.  Unless you have a mail server of your own, this would normally be your ISP's relay server, or your mail providers SMTP server.  I have successfully used Gmail as my SMTP server, but it does require authentication.  (Some of the other hosts may as well.)\nTest access to the server with the command telnet mail.example.com 25.  If it is working, you will get a banner message from the server. \nOnce you have Thunderbird working with the server, you can configure Exim or Postfix as a satellite server for the same server.  You can skip this if you don't need to send email off the system from other applications.   Be careful, that the source address on the outgoing server can accept email.\nEDIT: Check that you don't have iptables activated and blocking outgoing traffic.  If you do, enable outgoing traffic on your desired port.  You can use a command like tcptraceroute mail.example.com 25 to see where you are getting blocked.  tcptraceroute would need to be installed before you use it.\n\nA: I tested this on a vagrant box and working perfectly.\nInstalled following things by running the command\napt-get install php-pear\npear install mail\npear install Net_SMTP\npear install Auth_SASL\npear install mail_mime\nThen install postfix by running following command\napt-get install postfix\nduring installation Select--\nInternet Site and localhost in place of server because we trying this on localhost\nAfter this run the following command\nsudo vim /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf\nto make changes to files\nmake this changed to ssmtp.conf file\nFromLineOverride=YES\nAuthUser=youremail@gmail.com\nAuthPass=yourpasss\nmost important make your email accessible to less secure apps by\nhttps://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps\nand then you can use php mail function or\nEnter following command in terminal to send mail from terminal itself\n$ ssmtp youremail@gmail.com\nFrom :youremail@gmail.com\nTO :sendto@email.com\nSubject:The Subject\nHello this is my first ssmtp email!.\npress Ctrl+D and ssmtp will send your email\nYou can also check the smtp is working or not from your machine\nping smtp.gmail.com\n--output from this command is something like\n64 bytes from sc-in-f108.1e100.net (74.125.68.108): icmp_seq=1 ttl=63 time=68.4 ms\ntelnet smtp.gmail.com 587\n--output must be something like this\nTrying 74.125.68.108...\nConnected to gmail-smtp-msa.l.google.com.\n220 smtp.gmail.com ESMTP l14sm12513264pfb.73 - gsmtp\n", "Q: Random Shutdowns I've installed Ubuntu on a USB thumbdrive, to be used to backup (image) and partition a harddisk. I'm currently stuck at the backup-phase of my plan, because Ubuntu keeps shutting down.\nFrom my perspective, it seems that it just shuts down, almost as if I had asked it to. I don't have any good messages in the logs, as far as I can tell, so I'm really looking for a place to start debugging. I've also been playing Minecraft off this installation, and it seems to not like that either: the same sort of shutdowns occur, but it isn't limited to Minecraft.

Try to use this one https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/oneiric/i386/gedit-latex-plugin/3.3.1-1~oneiric1\n\nA: I had the same problem.

You could/should be asked for your password as some work is done as root in the script.\n\nA: Many such devices have both and use the storage part to hold Windows drivers for the modem part.  The device takes a command to switch between modes.  The usb-modeswitch package has the program and the database of commands to use for switching known devices.

Background: Got a new laptop recently. Got Ubuntu working on it and copied everything I needed from my old laptop's Ubuntu installation thusly. However, I had an NTFS partition on my old machine with some data I'd like to keep. I've resized this HDD's partitions to make space for it, but I still have to copy it.\nIf worse comes to worst, I guess I could make a new NTFS partition of the same size with GParted, mount them on both machines, and use ssh/rsync to copy all the files, but there's probably a better/easier/more efficient way to go about it. I did some Google searches to the effect of \"copy ntfs partition over lan,\" but there's too much out there to process. I try to solve these problems with Google when I can, but in this case, I think I've gotten to the point of needing to ask people directly.\n\nA: You can use the dd command for that. If you wanted to clone an entire disk, you would do something like sudo dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb. That would make sdb a complete copy of sda, including partitions and everything. It does not check that there's room on the second disk, so make sure there is. \nTo copy a filesystem from one partition to the other, is just as easy: sudo dd if=/dev/sda5 of=/dev/sdxx. IF is for input file and OF is for output file. You can do this with files as well. For instance, to copy a filesystem to a file, you'll use sudo dd=/dev/sda1 of=/path/to/somefile.img. You could then transport the file however you wished, and then use the file as the input and the partition as output; dd if=/path/to/image.img of=/dev/sda1. \n\nA: What about copying data using a normal GIU file manager of your choice? When copying data over network, the underlying filesystem is largely irrelevant. If the partition is not shared over network already and you prefer a command-line solution, then using scp or rsync is probably the easiest.\n", "Q: No sound alerts for system events I have installed Ubuntu 11.10 on my Inspiron N5030.\nInitially there were login sounds and all. But after some updates and software installation, now I'm not getting any alert sounds. However I get sounds when logged in as guest. I don't know which update worked wrong.\nI tried almost all solutions that provided in earlier posts...\n Please help me to solve it...\n\nA: I have a fairly recent clean install of 11.10 with Gnome. One thing I've noticed with new installs is that the alert volume (separate from the normal volume) in system settings => sounds => sound effects seems to be set to minimum by default.  This caused Skype sounds to not work.\nI raise this, and Skype works correctly.  the alert sounds all work correctly if I click on them in the sound dialog box.  However, if a question alert pops up, such as one asking me if I want to save a file, there is no sound.\nI discovered that it is not a sound problem at all; I discovered this by going into the system settings => universal access => hearing tab, and trying to enable \"visual alerts\".  I tried this, and pressed the \"Test flash\" button, and nothing happened.  So, the event is not being fired, it seems.\nThen, I discovered that it is a Compiz problem.  Changing to Metacity (running metacity --replace) makes it all work as expected.  Changing back to Compiz (compiz --replace) makes it stop working again.\nThe results can be seen either in the Universal Access settings when pressing the test button, or in a terminal by typing echo -e \"\\a\", which should make the chosen alert sound.\n\nA: (Ubuntu 11.10 using gnome shell)\nthere seems to be in bug in sound settings here.\nif you want to keep up the alert sounds ON first \"unmute\" and then raise the volume.\nif you just raise the volume from zero to something e.g 50, then checkbox of mute displays unmute but actually its not.\nafter a month without alert sound i finally got upto it by an accident. lol :).\np.s. Please feel free to correct me if i am wrong.\n\nA: I have a similar (possibly the same) problem. My sound works just fine in 11.10 64-bit install on dm1-4050 Sandy Bridge notebook (e.g. audio works in Banshee, flash, games, browser, Thunderbird email notification, etc.), but the core desktop notifications (e.g. pressing a tab in a terminal where there is more than one option should trigger a terminal notification sound, or changing volume using volume keys should be accompanied with the supporting \"quack\" that the volume app makes) do not work. I've intentionally disabled login sound as explained here on ask ubuntu but even enabling it back makes no difference.\nOnly things I did were trying to install some ppa edge xorg drivers for my intel card (a separate issue) but also reverted them all with ppa-purge once I discovered they did not improve anything. Other thing I did was check volume settings with alsamixer and did alsactl store for the soundcard after I did some experimenting with volume settings for PCM (on my laptop PCM at 100% crackles so I had to lower it and make pulseaudio ignore its setting). That said, neither of these should have any bearing on the said notifications since the volume is up and they clearly work everywhere else but the core desktop events (including the system ready drum sound when Ubuntu boots and user reaches the login screen).\nI've tried copying ubuntu sounds to /usr/share/sounds/ as suggested on ask ubuntu and that did not work. I also tried using dconf-editor to check sound theme settings and tried both freedesktop (which is what it was set to) and ubuntu, as suggested on ask ubuntu. This did not work either. I tried purging ~/.pulse folder and the /tmp/pulse entries, rebooting and restarting pulseaudio with -D flag. While audio came back on and behaved just fine in all aspects (e.g. one can adjust volume levels, play music, games, in-browser sound stuff, and other app alerts) except for the system ready drum sound (at the login screen), and any system event (terminal bell and volume change quack sound). It is interesting that the quack sound works inside system settings->sound when adjusting levels there, but it does not when volume is changed via top bar's volume settings...\nSo, there you have it. I tried all I could find on this issue and had no luck so far... Any ideas?\n\nA: using ubuntu 12.04, i installed ubuntu-tweak and on the Tweaks tab, enter the sound section and then enable Event sounds and choose a Sound theme (default \"ubuntu\").\n", "Q: Dual boot, ubuntu won't boot!

I am using Ubuntu 11.10 with a Nvidia Geforce 8600M GT and a Nvidia Geforce 525M GT (drivers; nvidia-current-updates via Ubuntu). \nWhile Adobes Flash Player 11.x was working with full Hardware Acceleration in Ubuntu 11.04, it has stopped working in Ubuntu 11.10.\n\nA: I just posted an interesting find on \"Hardware Acceleration for Adobe Flash\" right here: Is Adobe Flash 11.2 working with Nvidia hardware again?\nIt might help you guys out, if you are running Nvidia hardware (with the newest drivers). There is still hope.\n\nA: Sup guys,\nI just wanted to update my own answer, because I finally found a working, reliable solution to the problem: Google Chrome. This is what you will get by downloading and installing Google's browser:\n\n\n*\n\n*Flash accelerated video rendering on Nvidia and AMD GPU's. A hardware accelerated (GPU) browser, if your GPU is supported. The reason I mention this: Firefox performs extremly slow on my system. \n\n*Firefox = Low framerates, slow/laggy scrolling on various websites,\nutilizes an old Adobe Flash version and offers no hardware\nacceleration for Flash videos.\n\n*Chrome = higher framerate and smooth scrolling on various websites,\nships with an up to date version* of Adobe's Flash that gets updated automatically via automated browser updates. This leads to: A smoother, faster browsing experience and a much smoother Flash video playback - even on notebooks.\n\n\nMy OS of choice and hardware:\n\n\n*\n\n*OS: Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 64 bit (LTS = rock solid and very stable)\n\n*Hardware: AMD Phenom II X4, AMD HD 7850 (proprietary drivers installed), 8GB DDR3 Ram, MSI AM3+ Mainboard\n\n\nProcedure:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the newest proprietary drivers via Ubuntu. I chose to install the most recent/updated drivers Ubuntu offered me. I did not install the experimental/beta drivers.\n\n*Download and install Google Chrome.\n\n*Launch Chrome, go to Youtube and playback a 1080p video. Right click on the video and select \"show video information\". If everything goes well, it should say \"accelerated video rendering\".\n\n*Done!\n\n\nPlease note: There is a difference between Chromium and Google Chrome. See here for more information: Chromium vs. Google Chrome\n\nA: Oranges10e have tried several Browsers, including the newest Chrome and the newest Firefox, and he says: \n\"\nSince there are many threads/topics and questions about this, I will provide the information I have found, during my long, long search for a solution to this problem (see my own Solution below).\nSOLUTION (there is none):\nIn order to prevent endless searching for a solution to this problem (took me a few days to find out), which can be a real pain, please read this:\nAccording to an Adobe Employee, Hardware Acceleration has been disabled in recent Adobe Flash versions for Linux and Linux only. At the time being, there is no \"official\" way to get it working again - not even by installing the prop. Nvidia drivers, including VDPAU acceleration. This was the solution to older Adobe Flash versions - not anymore.\nThe main reason for this move was:\n\n\n*\n\n*Security concerns.\n\n*Unstable Nvidia/AMD/Intel and Open Source drivers - in combination with Adobe Flash Hardware-Acceleration.\n\n\nHere the Link to the thread, where this has been discussed and confirmed: http://forums.adobe.com/thread/911321\nQuote from the Link above:\n\"Unfortunately given the current landscape of graphics drivers and support for Linux based operating systems, we could not support Linux with Hardware Acceleration.  Most drivers, including the ones provided from Intel/NVIDIA/AMD were too unstable to consistently work with the Flash Player.  Sorry for the inconvienience.\" - Charbs09, Adobe Employee\n\"As of FP 11.0.1.152 there is no way to turn on HW Acceleration for Linux.  We disabled it entirely facing security concerns, but we may re-enable an unsupported method in a future release.\" - Charbs09, Adobe Employee\nSo, before you go out and buy an ION Netbook, Nettop or any kind of PC, wishing to use it in a combination of Linux/Ubuntu and Adobe Flash 11.x, with the intention to playback HD-Videos (720p, 1080p) with full Hardware Acceleration, please consider the above mentioned info. I did not, and sadly, I realized this too late (because I was trying out several other methodes to get this working again, before I found the Link above). \"\n\nA: It's a little bit of manual pain (I much prefer things from the ubuntu repositories), but reverting to the 64-bit flashplayer 10 was the only way I've had any success getting flash working on the ION-based Zotac ZBOX ID41.\n\nA: According to this thread you can install Flash 10.3 and use it in Firefox.\n\nA: Why don't you just use pepper flash, it's the newest version of flash player(currentlly version 14) that google maintains. It should also have hardware acceleration. \nAnyway Google Chrome has already built-in pepperflash.\n\nI've installed pepper flash on Chromium and Opera 24 developer preview using the link below:\n\nhttp://www.webupd8.org/2014/01/pepper-flash-player-installer-for.html\n\nIf you want to install pepper flash in firefox, do the folowing:\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:nilarimogard/webupd8\n  sudo apt-get update\n  sudo apt-get install freshplayerplugin\n\nAlso if google chrome or chromium don't give you hardware acceleration, try changing the flags, go to chrome://flags, find \"Override software rendering list\" and enable it. It also works on opera(opera://flags/). Hopefully it helps.\n", "Q: How do I make the scanner function of my Brother DCP-315CN work? I have a networked Brother DCP-315CN printer/scanner that I've been using with Ubuntu since version 7.10. Each new version has required its own tricks but so far, I've always been able to make the machine work - until now with v11.10.\nPrinting is no problem and has just become easier with the years, not even requiring drivers from the Brother web pages but the scanning function now leaves me without a clue as to what to do. I've downloaded and installed brscan2 (which hasn't been updated by Brother since 2009) and other related drives just as with earlier Ubuntu versions. I have also applied the tip about copying a number of files from /usr/lib64 to /usr/lib but to no use.\nbrsaneconfig 2 -q tells me that I've correctly configured and registered the scanner, and dpkg -l tells me that the drivers are installed but still, no scanner application detects it.\nscanimage -L, scanimage -T, sane-find-scanner, and brsaneconfig2 -d all state that there is no scanner device connected, which I find very strange since the two computers in the house still running v11.04 sees the scanner, and I can anyway print on the device even from Oneiric.\nAny piece of advice that can put me on a forward-moving track would be very much appreciated.\nUpdate: I've been playing around with VirtualBox on two different computers, testing both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Ubuntu. So far, the conclusion is that this problem is specific to the 64-bit version of 11.10. 32-bit or earlier versions of Ubuntu work fine with the scanner. As to the reason for the problem, I'm no wiser, however.\nUpdate: More playing with VirtualBox. scanning works with 64-bit Fedora 16 (recent kernel) and Debian 6 (old kernel), but so far not with Ubuntu-based Mint 12. So the problem seems to be kind of ubuntuish up to now. Going to try OPENSuse as well.\n\nA: I think the following lines do the job for the brscan2 package - Ubuntu 12.04 amd64, Networking DCP-560CN:\nsudo cp /usr/lib64/libbrscandec2* /usr/lib\n\nsudo cp /usr/lib64/libbrcolm2* /usr/lib \n\nsudo cp /usr/lib64/sane/libsane-brother2* /usr/lib/sane\n\n\nA: It finally works!\nI evidently made a mistake when first following the tip on the Brother web pages copying a number of library files from /usr/lib64 to /usr/lib. I discovered this by accident when playing with the Ubuntu 12.04 beta 1 in a VM. Since that version is an LTS, I now know that Ubuntu will support scanning with my DCP-315CN for longer than the hardware is likely to last... :-)\n", "Q: How can one invoke lg (Looking Glass) from a command line?

I have been trying to sync all my documents on Ubuntu One on one Ubuntu Lucid system and one Windows XP computer. \nMy trouble starts when Ubuntu One sync deleted folders I deleted from one computer from the server and when I opened the other it deleted that too. My files are gone forever.\nHow do i fix this from happening again?\nI have seen that is coming when I see the sync on one computer removed the files from server, I got copy by chance. But there are some files lost before i could back up the whole folder.\n\nA: Ubuntu One keeps things in sync.  This means if you change or delete a file on one system, it is changed or deleted on all of them.  All synchronized folders will always be kept the same.\nIf you want to put something in Ubuntu One and then remove it from your local system but keep it on Ubuntu One you can do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select a folder for synchronization in Ubuntu One.\n\n*Wait until the synchronization is complete\n\n*Open the Ubuntu One control panel. Go to the \"Cloud Folders\" tab,\nfind the folder you synchronized and uncheck the \"Sync locally\"\ncheckbox.\n\n*Delete the files or folder on your local system.\n\n\nThen your files will be online in Ubuntu One and gone from your local system.\n\nA: There is one other solution to deleting files on just one computer. Before you delete any files go to the Devices tab and remove that device from your authorized device list. Since it is no longer part of the Ubuntu 1 system, it will not be synchronized. Once it is no longer part of the system, it can be deleted without emptying the cloud or affecting any other computer listed.\nAlso, if you have two or more computers on Ubuntu 1, might be a good idea to remove one from the list that you want to keep in sync. That way, you have one to reload your cloud account if it does empty your cloud account. I figured that out when I learned the hard way that deleting from one deletes from all. \nKathy Yearwood\n", "Q: Difficulty trying to mount an ISO file \"mount: you must specify the filesystem type\" I have an .iso file which I would like to mount.

Heard about this, and immediately decided to get Ubuntu. I'm not interested in running Ubuntu alongside Windows, 'cause yeah. I just had one doubt, I'm currently downloading Ubuntu 11.10 32 bit. I've seen around the internet, that there's an option to dual boot. I've never done any of this in my life, and obviously, first time chills. So when I download Ubuntu, I understand I'm supposed to put it on a CD or a USB? Then try out this CD, etc etc etc. The question is, in all of this process, will I ever have the option of allowing dual boot? Or do I have to go around downloading what I see is called \"Wubi\" too?\nDeeply appreciated. \nOne more minor thing, after installing Ubuntu and living happily ever after, will everything I have currently in my laptop get deleted? Pictures, data, games, everything? Or transformed to be supported on Ubuntu?\nThanks, if answered.\nHappy new year!\n\nA: Yes, the graphical installer will present you with an option to keep Windows. What will happen is that you're asked how much space of the harddisk Windows should have access to, and how much Ubuntu should use. That's just a slider and you can choose 50%, for instance. You should be aware that while Windows is not capable of reading Ubuntus data, Ubuntu is capable of reading and writing to Windows' file system. \nThe difference between Wubi and a normal install in that regard, is that Wubi installs do not resize the Windows file system, but creates a folder in it where Ubuntu can be \"installed\". If you've heard of ISO images that's used instead of CD-ROM discs, that is the same type. Instead of simulating a CD-ROM in a file, wubi simulates a harddisk for Ubuntu to use. But this also means Wubi installs usually are less efficient and might also be less stable. A normal install is preferred, and is very easy to do. Just follow the onscreen instructions and you shouldn't have any difficulties. \nBut please do pay attention. For instance, if you choose not to keep windows, it cannot be undone afterwards. So make sure before you click. :)\n\nA: Installing from a CD or USB stick will still allow you to install side-by-side with Windows if you want.  There are instructions here:\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/ubuntu/download\nIf you click \"Show me how\" under Step 4 (\"Install it!\") you will see that one of the questions asked during install is whether or not to erase the entire disk or install alongside an existing operating system.\nSome settings can be imported from a Windows partition if you perform a side-by-side install with Windows, but your documents and files will not be copied or moved automatically.  You should back up your important files and copy them to your new Ubuntu installation once it is completed.\n", "Q: PowerXpress error with Driver Catalyst. How can I fix it?

You can get Centrify Express through the Ubuntu repository or directly from http://www.centrify.com/express.   Specifically Centrify Express has part of the install process a utility called \"adcheck\" that does various tests to determine if your system can be properly joined to an Active Directory domain.  Running this command will probably debug your issue.  So even if you elect not to go ahead and use Centrify Express, at least it will do a pre-install check to validate your environment.  If you do install Centrify Express, be sure to run the adinfo command to validate that the Ubuntu system is properly joined.  \nHope this helps.

It was almost automatic using the \"Play on Linux\" version from the developers website plus it has a step by step tutorial on how to use it for people that are afraid of \"Wine,\" like me. The second solution is to go to https://read.amazon.com/ it's an on-line version of \"kindle\" that will allow you to read DRM protected books and it has an off-line reading mode included, it basically turns your browser into a \"kindle,\" the only drawback to this solution is that you have to purchase the book from Amazon.\n", "Q: How do I make my Windows Media Center remote control work?

However, when I go to install rvm using the following command:\nbash -s stable < <(curl -s https://raw.github.com/wayneeseguin/rvm/master/binscripts/rvm-installer )\n\nI receive this error message:\nWarning: /usr/share/ruby-rvm/archives/wayneeseguin-rvm-stable.tgz: Permission \nWarning: denied\n  0  792k    0  2896    0     0   1878      0  0:07:11  0:00:01  0:07:10  128k\ncurl: (23) Failed writing body (0 != 2896)\n\nCould not download 'https://github.com/wayneeseguin/rvm/tarball/stable'.\n  curl returned status '23'.\n\nI looked around for a fix but couldn't locate one. This problem has been bugging me since August.\nAny help if much appreciated. \nPS. If it is easier to remove 1.8.7, do you suggest I just do that?\nUpdate:\nUsing sudo apt get.\nI almost can't believe what a pain in the a&& it is just to use rvm. After I finally got rvm installed and the bash files working correctly, I went to install ruby version 1.9.2. Of course, the rvm git file has the wrong code as you can read about in this link:\nhttps://github.com/wayneeseguin/rvm/commit/52018750763d5321b7b993e201c8589b98e090f9\nSo here we go again, I opt to use rvm install 1.9.2-head and it installs this version of ruby correctly. \nI then tell rvm to use version 1.9.2 with the follow command, rvm use 1.9.2-head. Rvm tells me it is now using 1.9.2. But then when I version check ruby with ruby -v, I find out that it is still using 1.8.7.\nWhy is it so difficult to get this working? I feel like I've wasted hours on something that should have been relatively easy.\n\nA: the issue is withing ruby-rvm package installed via apt - use this answer to fix: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9056008/installed-ruby-1-9-3-with-rvm-but-command-line-doesnt-show-ruby-v/9056395#9056395\n", "Q: Can I use the same Thunderbird profile under Windows and Ubuntu? Hi I'm curious if it's possible to use the same Thunderbird profile, stored on a NAS, form an Ubuntu based PC as well as from a Windows based one. Anybody out there with some experience?\nSince one month, I now use a setup, where I have stored the Thunderbird Profile on my NAS and use it from different PC's under Windows. I would like to keep it like this, while switching one of the PC's to Ubuntu 11.10 (just done and it runs quite well) and use the same profile.\n\nA: I share the exact profile I already had with WinXP before installing Ubuntu as a dual boot.\nOn Ubuntu, Thunderbird stores your profile.ini file in .thunderbird under Home (show hidden files enabled in nautilus to find it).\nOn WinXP, Thunderbird normally stores your profile.ini in c:\\Documents and Settings\\username\\Application Data\\Thunderbird\\Profiles (Different versions of Windows store this folder in different places)\nBefore you start, make a complete copy of your profile folder, subfolders and  their files in Windows as a backup.\nTo share your existing Windows profile with Ubuntu, navigate to your profile.ini on Windows, open it and make note of where the path to your profile folder is. Navigate to that path in Ubuntu and copy the complete path name (if you're using Nautilus, open a terminal and drag the path folder icon to the terminal to get the complete path name). \nOnce you've copied your complete path name, open the profile.ini in your Home .thunderbird folder and enter that as the \"Path=\" parameter. Change \"IsRelative=1\" to \"IsRelative=0\". Save and exit. \nNow you can use your existing Windows Thunderbird profile in Ubuntu and back and forth. \nNotes: \nYou have to make sure your Windows partition with the profile is mounted before launching Thunderbird in Ubuntu. \nYou may also run into Thunderbird checking for add-on updates anytime you switch between your Windows and Ubuntu Thunderbird. Just let it run.\n\nA: I experienced no problems when sharing my Thunderbird profile with Windows 7 on a dual-boot system.\nSimply set up Ubuntu's Thunderbird like you would on Windows systems and you should be good to go (the configuration file is located in your home directory under ~/.thunderbird/profile.ini).\n", "Q: Log boot messages on tty1 instead of tty7 I'd like to see my boot messages in a different VT than 7.\nCan it be changed?  Can I get the old behaviour - to get a login prompt AFTER all boot-up is complete in TTY1?\n\nA: If you are comfortable changing your kernel boot params, you can add any number of console=ttyX. The last one specified gets 'boot' messages, for example:\nroot=/dev/sda1 console=ttyS0,57600n8 console=tty1\n\nKernel and boot messages will go to tty1\n", "Q: Cannot connect devices via bluetooth with Ubunutu 11.10 I am trying to connect my Sony bluetooth headset, but my computer can't see them. On earlier versions of Ubuntu, I never had problems connecting them on Windows.\nNow that I am running 11.10, my bluetooth mouse works, my phone doesn't connect, and my headset will not show up on the devices list.\nWhat should I do?\n\nA: I had the same problem with 11.10 with Bluetooth connecting to my Galaxy S (as well as SD card mounting in read only mode and showing corrupted files). I'm on a older HP dv6768se and the only fix I reached was uninstalling the Linux 3.0 kernel in 11.10 with the older 2.6.39 kernel for Oneiric. Bluetooth issue solved instantly. Lucid's kernel (2.6.31) was the last one that fully worked on my system in terms of the SD card issue. I'll try to install that next.\n\nA: I have had more luck with the blueman package in setting up my bluetooth devices than using bluez.  There are two competing managers, and sometimes one works better than the other.  \nOnce you have your device connecting you may need to enable the device for audio in the pulse audio configuration.  I find the pavucontrol program gives me easy access to the settings needed. \n\nA: installing blueman solved my issue in 12.04 LTS. Thank You! My Emerson wireless headset would pair up but not appear in sound preferences and would not work.Everything works great now.\n", "Q: I ran 11.04 on a Mac and I loved it. Why does it look different on a PC? I booted a Ubuntu 11.04 live CD on a Mac and I fell in love with the interface. So I decided to install it on my PC. Imagine my dismay when the interface was just the blah standard Windows style Ubuntu I've always been used to. I just really like the Mac-like interface I saw on the Mac.\nIs there a way to see/install Ubuntu on a PC and have it use the Mac interface? \nI don't want it to emulate Mac. I want it to look and behave like Ubuntu Live as it defaults on a Mac machine.\n\nA: It sounds like your PC did not have the proper hardware (or hardware drivers) to run the full 3D Unity experience.  There are two things you could try to fix this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Upgrade to 11.10.  In 11.10 there is a 2D fallback version of Unity that looks and behaves like the 3D version, but does not require hardware acceleration.\n\n*Try seeing if there is a proprietary driver available for your system by running the \"Additional drivers\" tool while connected to the internet.\n\n\nOf course, both upgrading to 11.10 and checking for a proprietary driver will give you the best results.\nAccording the to Nvidia Linux Display Drivers page, you need the 304-experimental driver for a GeForce 460. This driver should be listed when you check for a proprietary driver.\n\nA: I believe that the default with Unity is also to have the bar on the left hidden. If you move the mouse to the left edge it will appear. Even if your PC is a hard charger you need to install the Nvidia drivers since they are proprietary and don't come preinstalled. It is easy to do. Just enter \"drivers\" into the Unity search bar and you will get Hardware Drivers. It will guide you through the install easily.\n", "Q: How to add custom directory e.g. phpmyadmin? As my knowledge about apache is minimal. I'd like to let it grow so I'd have more experience with LAMP. My hot question for today is:\nHow to add custom directory to webserver? (e.g. phpmyadmin)?\nMy goal is to be able to create custom addresses with custom websites within. Let's suppose that I have my custom directory at: /media/my/web/portal1 and I'd like to load it when client calls \nhttp://localhost/myportal1 at webbrowser. \n\nCould you give me a list of steps with few words of explanation?\n\nA: A simpler alternative is to create a soft link from the document root. For example, if the document root is \"/var/www\" (the default on most Linux systems), then the following command does the trick:\nsudo ln -s /media/my/web/portal1 /var/www/myportal1\n\nThis works immediately - you don't even need to reload the Apache server.\n\nA: Edit your Apache config file and add an Alias Directive. For example, let's use the default file.\nsudo -e /etc/apache2/sites-available/default\n\nMake your alias by adding a section within the VirtualHost directive:\nAlias /database/ \"/usr/share/php5/phpmyadmin/\"\n<Directory \"/usr/share/php5/phpmyadmin/\">\n    Order allow,deny\n    Allow from all\n    # New directive needed in Apache 2.4.3: \n    Require all granted\n</Directory>\n\nSave and restart: sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart\nOr for the other reference:\nsudo -e /etc/apache2/sites-available/default\n\nAnd the contents...\nAlias /myportal1/ \"/media/my/web/portal1/\"\n<Directory \"/media/my/web/portal1/\">\n    Order allow,deny\n    Allow from all\n    # New directive needed in Apache 2.4.3: \n    Require all granted\n</Directory>\n\nSave and restart: sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart\nAdd more directives within the Directory directives, such as\nOptions Indexes FollowSymLinks \n\nSee http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/core.html#directory\nThat what you were after?\n\nA: Apache is a user in your system, just like you are, except that it cannot login. That means file access is exactly the same for Apache as it is for you. So, first, if Apache should serve a directory in /media/something, then Apache must have access to read it and its files. \nSecond, to setup a site that uses this directory as its home, you create sites-files, like /etc/apache2/sites-available/your-site. This is part of what's called vhosting. There are two different types; one based on name (the domain name) and one based on IP. The most common setup is to use name-based vhosts. You can read more about that here: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/vhosts/\n\nA: So Simple in two lines :\nsudo ln -s /etc/phpmyadmin/apache.conf /etc/apache2/conf.d/phpmyadmin.conf\n\nAfter\njust edit the file \"phpmyadmin.conf\"\npico /etc/apache2/conf.d/phpmyadmin.conf\n\nand change it to 'loool' or whatever :)\nAlias /loooool /usr/share/phpmyadmin\n\n<Directory /usr/share/phpmyadmin>\n\nSetEnvIfNoCase User-Agent \"^ZmEu\" bad_bot\nSetEnvIfNoCase User-Agent \"^BackDoorBot\" bad_bot\nSetEnvIfNoCase user-agent \"^BlackWidow\" bad_bot \nSetEnvIfNoCase User-Agent \"^BotALot\" bad_bot\n\nafter all of this reload apache :D\nservice apache2 reload\n\ntadaaa :D\nciao :)\n", "Q: How to change desktop icon text background color?

Then after that everything went sideways. I can get to the desktop but only see part of the top panel, no launcher, no indication area, just 'file' 'edit' 'view'...'help' alt+F2 does not work, the super key does not bring up the dash. Unity 2D works, but I rather Unity 3D. CCSM in 2D did not help. What can I do to restore Unity to before my fiddling with it? I tired ctrl+alt+F1 (to try some thing in terminal I saw for an answer to a question similar to mine) at the log in but i just got a black screen that was not responsive.\nThank you for your time and answers.\n\nA: Ctrl+Alt+T should open the terminal. If that doesn't work, try logging in to Unity 2D (option from clicking on the cog at the login screen). From there run:\nunity --reset\nand failing that, try:\nunity --replace\nto completely restore Unity.

If not, what could HandBrake possibly be seeing differently between \"B\" and \"C\"?\nI am running 10.04 on a headless server which I access via ssh.\n\nA: It does make a difference, as one can detect if the privileges were elevated (suid case) which is different from running via sudo. That's because the whole process is running as 'jack' in the sudo case (and never reverts the uid: the process just terminates), whereas the suid case \"remembers\" the original uid and only the effective uid is changed.\nYour situation is slightly different but here is a test script which detects each combination of sudo/suid: test_privs.sh\nSimilar code is now used in the X11 server to detect elevated privileges: xorg-devel discussion\nI haven't looked at your specific device/handbrake needs, but this should put you on the right track.\n", "Q: Can't open Catalyst with administrative privileges For some reason I can't open Catalyst with administrative privaleges on Xubuntu 11.10.

I want to know how to install drivers such as lan, wifi, audio, video & graphics, webcam and so in Windows 7 32bit installed as a guest OS inside Ubuntu 10.10 (host) using Virtual Box 3.2.8.\nI am using this in a Toshiba Satellite c650 psc 14g. I had downloaded the drivers from the Toshiba website. They work fine when using Windows 7 32 bit as host OS.\nThen what are the main differences between dual boot and Virtual Box?\n\nA: System inbuilt components like LAN, Wifi, soundcard,or graphics card will be used from the host OS. They will be virtualized using an emulation for the guest OS. In many cases you are able to choose from different emulation modes in the virtual machine settings.\n\nTherefore you can not install these drivers to your guest OS.\n\nHowever some external components like USB attached devices (e.g. printer, scanner, Bluetooth dongle) do need an additional driver for the guest OS. In Windows you will be asked for these drivers as soon as you capture the device from the Virtual Box Manager.\nNote: for full USB 2.0 support we need to run the PUEL version of Virtual Box that to date is on version 4.1.8.\n\nA: You don't need (and you can't) install your real hardware drivers inside VirtualBox. Windows, while running inside VirtualBox can't access your hardware, it can only interact with a Virtual (false) hardware that VirtualBox will set for it. Virtual Box will translate it to the real hardware. You can get a more complete explanation of how virtual machines work in wikipedia.\nThat it's the reason that you can't really play the latest games under Virtual Box. Nor the game, nor Windows can access your graphics card to get the most speed. This is also the reason why running windows under a virtual machine is slower than running it on bare metal.\nBut you will need to install the drivers for the Virtual Hardware to get the best experience possible. They are called Guest Additions in Virtual Box, check this question to install them.\nNote that the virtual machine has no direct access to your card, so watching HD videos or playing 3D games can't be accelerated by it and it will be slower than doing it in the host. As you experienced, the speed will be similar to the one that you see while using windows without the drivers (i.e. using no video card acceleration).\n\nA: Most probably you wont need to install any drivers as windows will automatically detect the emulated hardware and install the required drivers. As windows is running on virtual box so it needs the drivers for emulated hardware and not your actual hardware. Mapping emulated hardware to real is the job of VirtualBox and Winodws is not aware that it is running on emulated hardware.\n\nA: You don't have to Install Anything in the Windows guest, Windows installs it automatically.\nAnd the difference between Dual Boot and Emulated Hardware are just...to many, for one it will be slower in the Virtual Machine, you don't have complete 3D hardware acceleration, nor you can't access directly your physical hardware from the Virtual Machine.\nThe Virtual Machine is as fast as your real hardware can handle it and judging by the Lack of Specs and looking at the Basic Toshiba laptop i would just install Windows side by side with Ubuntu.\n\nA: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS Trusty Tahr host OS\nVirtualBox 4.3.10Ubuntu r93012 \nWindows 7 Home Premium guest\nI had the same problem. I first burned the .iso file to a DVD and set up passthrough access to the CD/DVD drive on my Toshiba Satellite C660 laptop. (But you probably don't need to do this; just use the .iso file and mount it as a DVD.) The Windows 7 folder for the VM was created, and the Windows 7 installer started okay.

When I chose either the DVD .iso or the virtual VDI drive, an alert advised that no drivers were found.\nThe answer is to change the permissions of /home/<~my-home>/VirtualBox VMs/Windows 7/ and its subsidiary files and folders to Read/Write for owner and group (or even for everybody if it's your own computer).

Good day, Ladies and Gentlemen!\nJust to reassure myself: As far as I read in here, Ubuntu uses the correct decimal base interpretation of the MB prefix. So, in Nautilus, a file of 1MB is actually really 103 KB (1000 kilobytes) and 1GB = 103 MB (1000 megabytes).\nHowever, I want to know if the same is true during the installation of Ubuntu, when creating the partitions manually. Am I right to enter 20000MB if I want a 20GB partition?\n\nA: Ok, I tested it today. Simply by doing a fresh install. Ubuntu uses MB during installation, i.e. the decimal base. However, GParted shows the partition size in MiB.\nAnd in Kubuntu, it's total crap. Because both, Dolphin AND the partition manager, show file/partition sizes in MiB.\nThis is totally inconsistent. It should be the same systemwide, during install and after.\n", "Q: Nvidia VGA and Ubuntu 11.10 \n*\n\n*I installed Ubuntu 11.10 amd64 and it used the default settings and vga driver: unknown both screens sere working regardless of the errors of turning the laptop's off then both go off forever!\n\n*So I tried installing Nvidia driver in both ways,I.

I know there might be some fixes to do with integration with Ubuntu, but won't this already be done in the beta face too.\nAnd if I run the archive directly from Firefox site, it is pretty stable. Only the ubuntu integration is missing.\nSo just why? That's all.\n\nA: The official Firefox 9 release was 5 days before the Christmas break, so we took the decision to upload it to the proposed pockets over the Christmas holiday, to minimize the impact of any problems. It has now been published as a security update to all users this morning.\nFor Firefox 8, a late change in the beta cycle caused a bug where language packs were being disabled on upgrade. Unfortunately, we only caught this after the official release (but, fortunately, before publishing the update). This meant that the release had to be delayed for Ubuntu users.\nThe intention is that we will publish updates close to the upstream release date, and there really is no reason why we can't do that. The fact that we currently aren't doing this successfully, means that we just need to get much better. In the meantime, I can only offer you my apologies for having to wait.\n\n\n*\n\n*See my blog for more details on the work we do.\n\n*How do I install the latest stable version of Firefox?\n", "Q: How to hide xchat icon from panel?

I installed it using a Live USB with the following partition configuration:\n6GB Primary /dos   FAT32\n5GB Logical /      ext4\n5GB Logical /home  ext4\n\nI don't have a hard disk, and don't see myself getting one anytime soon. \nI rely solely on this 16GB, and two other 4GB USBs, one of which I used as the LiveUSB. I bring the USBs around, and even use the install at work. \nI previously used an install that used a swap file. It functioned fine for the most part, save for a few slow moments, but I came across this post, and it got me thinking about my USB's life, so I reinstalled with the current config. \nMy problem now is that it is slower. Applications like Firefox would hang more often. In my previous setup (the automatically partitioned setup), Firefox would start hanging if I was running an unzip or install task on the same partition as /. \nNow however, it would hang if I had another window open i.e. the system settings window. My guess is that it may have something to do with the swap file or the install being on a Logical partition rather than a Primary partition, but I don't know. \nAny insight as to why it has slowed down?\n\nA: Apart from the fact that accessing the drive via USB is inherently slower than via SATA (i.e. a \"normal\" HDD or especially SSD will be noticeably/much faster than an USB drive), one cause of your current setup being slower may be partition misalignment. I'm not sure if USB flash drives are any different, but usually SSD drives have large physical sectors so it's important that partitions are aligned with the start of a physical sector. \nYou can use gparted to check if the partitions are aligned and to re-align them if necessary (you'll need to boot from another USB to make any changes to your current one)\nUPDATE: One way to check if a partition is aligned in gparted is to right-click on the partition, select Information from the menu and check First Sector parameter there. Make sure the number there is a multiple of a... err... alignment factor. 1024 (1MB) is a good number to use... so just make sure it's a multiple of 1024:\n \nI'm pretty sure the absence of swap should not make things slower - but you won't be able to use more RAM than you physically have.\nLogical partitions are just as fast as primary ones, provided they all aligned properly.\n", "Q: Why does Wubi.exe for Ubuntu 11.10 not run on Windows 7 32bit?

DnD the attachment, then compose the message, ect.\n\nA: When something that used to work, no longer works, it is called a regression. Particularly if it isn't obvious why the feature was removed, you should file a bug so that the developers are made aware of it. This site is not suitable for bug reports. Instead, we use http://Launchpad.net for that. If you need help filing a bug, look for answers here, and if you can't find any, ask a new question. :)\n", "Q: How can I make PCManFM open plain text files with Leafpad by default in Lubuntu? When I'm using PCManFM, I sometimes do the following. I right-click in an empty place in ~/, and choose Make new... --> Empty File. I type some text in it, like 'blabalballabl', and then I save it, e.g., as test.\nNow, I double-click this file. Leafpad won't open the file, but instead PCManFM will say that the file is executable. It then asks if I want to execute the file or not. I don't want this to happen, I just want Leafpad to open the file. Right-clicking the file, then changing the default application to open this type of files doesn't help.\nIs there any way to force PCManFM to open files like these with Leafpad by default?\nI'm using Lubuntu 11.10 32 bit.\n\nPCManFM asks to execute the file\n\nChanging the default program to open the file doesn't help.\n\nmimeapps.list looks OK; text/plain should be opened by Leafpad.\n\nA: Its perhaps worth checking that if you have a mimetype list that its defined correctly:\n\nIn the same folder - try removing/renaming any custom leafpad.desktop file just in-case it is due to an error in that definition.\nLogout and login for changes to take effect.\n\nA: This is a common problem when the file is executable. As far as I know, there is no fix other than removing its executable flag: \n\n\n*\n\n*chmod -x [yourfile], or \n\n*Right-click > Properties > Permissions > Uncheck \"Make the file executable\". \n\n\nHowever, this fix will probably not work if the file is on a filesystem that does not support POSIX-like file permissions (e.g. NTFS, vfat, network shares, etc...).\n\nA: I have the solution!: Just add\n,noexec\n\nto the options of the ntfs line of /etc/fstab\n", "Q: How do I port software that I have written for Windows to Ubuntu? I have written software packages for the Windows platform.  \nI want to change to Ubuntu. At the moment I use Visual Basic and Access Databases.  Can anyone suggest What I should use to rewrite my software for the Linux platform?  \nIt must be known that I am a complete novice to Linux. Any assistance will be MUCH appreciated.\n\nA: As @Rinzwind has said you will find more accurate responses in stackoverflow but for a beginning ...\nI would recommend you to try to port to linux your programming knowledge instead of your code, and give python a try. It is a simple even powerful language totally multiplatform and with very nice learning curve. For database access there are a lot of frameworks and libraries ( SQLAlquemy for example ) and for the GUI you can try wxPython, QtPython, ...  for example.  If you want to develop database applications you should give dabo a try\nBut, if you still want to try to port your VBase code you can try with:\n\n\n*\n\n*Gambas Which is a development environment based on a Basic interpreter \n\n*Mono Which is a .NET-like framework for linux. ( see mono-develop ide also )\n\n\nAnd for the database access ... sorry but i think i can not help you with that may be these frameworks have some database support\nHope this helps.\n\nA: As somebody who used to use a lot of access and VBScript, I can say the transition isn't super-easy but it is possible and if you pick the right technology, even desirable. I'm writing much better software these days than I ever did over ODBC and Access.\nThere are a few options but your mileage will vary based on what you're doing and past experience.\n\n\n*\n\n*Python + Django\nMy first suggestion is a web development one. I'm a web developer more than anything else so I would  suggest this. Django makes managing your database schema stupidly simple. You create a Python class for each table, run a command and it establishes a fully relational database. Then you can query based on those classes (known as Models). All this without writing a single line of SQL.\nIt also comes with a very sexy admin interface which requires just a few lines of code to activate for your models. It handles validation, searching, filtering, ordering, input, some output/reporting and you can add on anything that isn't already there. And because it's a web interface, it's a lot easier to share with colleagues than by tossing an Access file around.\nAnd Python is a beautiful language. Simple elegance. You'll see that based on how many other people suggest it :)\n\n*LibreOffice Base\nIf you want to stick with simple databases, LibreOffice (or OpenOffice) Base is probably the most Access-like thing at your fingertips. It's not Access and it's quite simple and limited in respect to what Access can do (if you know what you're doing) but it's only supposed to be a simple desktop database.\n\n*Kexi\nAnother take on the Access-style database. It looks more flexible than Base but I've never used it so can't really say how good it is.\nThe last two are models you're probably more comfortable with but honestly, neither is great and that's because Access isn't a good model for database development when there are so many better frameworks.\nYou want to address the future of your development before you migrate to Ubuntu. If you just boot to Ubuntu now, you'll get very frustrated if you can't start working immediately. All three solutions above can run on Windows so get stuck in now.\nThe two applications can be downloaded and installed and Django takes a little more effort to get going. Start with this to install it (follow their advice about Python 2.7) and then move onto the official tutorial to start programming.\n\nA: A great way to get started developing for Ubuntu is by going to the developer site at developer.ubuntu.com. There you'll find tutorials and information on the different options you have. Once your'e done developing, submit your app there to get it into the software center. \n\nA: I would absolutely recommend that you use Python as a programming language and GTK and Glade to design your GUI interfaces. Python supports all kinds of databases, so that's up to you. MySQL is popular. So is PostgreSQL. There are many others to choose from, depending on what kind of data you want to store. But you should probably choose a cross platform one. \nBoth Python and GTK can be used on Windows and OS X as well as Ubuntu and others. The same is true for the databases. Ubuntu is a really comfortable development environment with all the tools you need at your fingertips. You should also have a look at the Quickly project. This is a way to jumpstart development projects, make packaging easy, etc. \nPorting your application to Ubuntu, also means you'll have the ability to reach a bigger audience with less difficulty later, since all the tools are cross platform. As a Visual Basic programmer, I think you'll really love Python. \n\nA: If you do not use too much windows specific library in development, you can use mono to run apps in both Linux based systems and Mac. But I'd rather prefer Qt for cross platform developing. It will also help to port your app in mobile devices.\n\nA: Qt as SDK and QtCreator as IDE is what you want.\nIt makes great GUI Applications look nice on nearly every OS there is, including those 3 (Windows, Linux, OS X).\nIt's easy to learn, inutitive and performant.\nTry it, you won't regret it!\n\nA: I don't know much about VisualBasic, and I don't know of an equivalent in the Linux world.\nFor Pascal, there is the gpc (GNU Pascal Compiler). Haven't used it, but I'm sure it's fairly easy for a Pascal programmer to transition. Similar cases for many other programming languages like C, C++, FORTRAN, etc. Although, I wouldn't suggest any of those to a VisualBasic programmer, there are several options for languages that reside on several platforms. I guess your choice of language may depend a bit on your company policy etc.\nPython would be my top recommendation. It's easy to learn, it forces you to write code that is easy to read, and it is multi-platform by default. If you want to deliver closed-source applications you will see that there are a few noticeable differences between platforms. But in general most code that you write will compile on any system. The tricky part is keeping with the folder structure (i.e. C:/Program Files/ vs /usr/share/). But there are os environmental parameters that you can use to avoid hard coding platform specific options. Down side is you have to learn a new language. Up side is you can use the same code in Windows and Linux and MacOSX, etc.\nTo keep up a GUI for your applications, there are several options in Python. Many Ubuntu developers seem to go for GTK3, which is also available for Windows. Personally, I much prefer Qt4 (you can use Qt4 for C/C++ as well, the Python package is called PyQt4 for the official one and PySide for a community project). You won't have an IDE the same way you do in VisualBasic, but using Qt Designer to create the GUI look makes it easy to then implement it in a code-only IDE (e.g. Wingware IDE, Eclipse, IPython...). So you will have to switch between the GUI-designer app and the coding IDE app. The same is true for GTK3, where you would use Glade to create a GUI.\nPython has a default database package implementing SQLite3. That database is rather capable, but there is no GUI to build it as with Access. There are however packages to access most types of databases. Personally, I prefer to stick with PostgreSQL for all my stuff since it is so scalable. PyQT4 has classes for all the major databases in the QtSql module, but there are many other options. You could of course also set up your old Access databases on a Windows machine with ODBC and then you could call them without switching database software.\n", "Q: Time indicator is not showing the date/time Yesterday I noticed that time indicator on the top pane is not showing the date/time, but is just saying \"Time\" (see attached screenshot).

When I go to ubuntu.com, I click \"Get Ubuntu\", then I click \"Download and Install\", then I select my desired option, (Kubuntu, Xubuntu, Edubuntu not being options there, sadly), then the download begins. Possibly one more click than necessary, but not bad.\nSo with no Kubuntu option, I go to kubuntu.com which redirects to kubuntu.org, I click \"Get Kubuntu\", then I click \"Download Kubuntu\", then I select my desired version... which takes me to \"metrocast.net\", where the options at the top of the page are all Ubuntu, not Kubuntu!\nSo I had to scroll down and click on Kubuntu, where once again I have to select the version I want, new page load and I have to select 32 or 64 bit, and finally at long last my download begins. This is just a flat-out wretched user experience for a \"Canonical supported\" version of Ubuntu.\n\nA: just go to http://releases.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/11.10/\nOn http://releases.ubuntu.com/ you will find all supported releases.\n\nA: When I visit Kubuntu.com, I am transparently forwarded to kubuntu.org, as you point out. Then I click Download, which forwards me to a page with some information that I should read before I start downloading, such as known issues. I then click on the download button and go the next page where I can choose different ways to download and then to the page where I choose type. I click Begin Download, and it begins. \nThey could probably have restructured the pages a little bit to collect data on one page... But I don't agree that it is a horrible user experience. Try to download Windows 7 from Microsoft.com and OS X from Apple.com and compare. I just did. Interesting. \nThe fact that Ubuntu is insanely cool and user friendly at all times, doesn't mean everything else is horrible. It just means it's not quite as cool. :)\n\nA: For me the process doesn't involve any third party websites... interesting. And it isn't any harder than downloading the Ubuntu image. Perhaps the reason you have to go through so much hassle is because of your location or something, but this is all I have to do:\nTry:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to kubuntu.org\n\n*Click the large featured blue \"Download\" button\n\n*Click the banner that says \"Download\" (They have a short reading about Kubuntu so that users don't rush in blindly)\n\n*Under \"Regular download\" is your options.\n\n", "Q: Why does Ubuntu change the time when installing? I just installed Ubuntu 11.10 onto a brand new hard drive with no other drives attached. After the install my system time was 2:45 PM instead of 7:45 AM.\nWhy the change?\n\nA: Ubuntu assumes that your hardware time (bios time) is in UTC time. When you provide the timezone (whilst installation) it will shift system time according to your timezone.\nYou probably have local time (GMT+5 I guess) set in BIOS.\nThis is a common problem when you have multiboot configuration with one system assuming BIOS is in UTC time (Linux) and another assumes BIOS is in local time (Windows).\n\nA: Ubuntu will choose language, time settings, etc from the country you selected when you installed. If you said you're from Brazil but now live in Russia, for instance, then the time will be wrong. You can change the time zone by right-clicking the clock on your panel and selecting Time settings. \n", "Q: Who designs and controls Unity? which people are in charge and control over Unity? are those the same people that decide to use it in different versions of Ubuntu?\n\n\n*\n\n*Who owns it?\n\n*who controls what will be in it?\n\n\nA: Unity is a Canonical product. Canonical controls both Ubuntu and Unity.\nUPDATE (after tumbleweed's comment):\n\"Canonical controls Ubuntu\" (1) vs. \"Canonical does not control Ubuntu development\" (2).\nWell, truth(tm) is probably somewhere in the middle. It's worth to mention about the Ubuntu Fundation which was founded by Mark to make Ubuntu more Canonical independent.\nAnyhow, Ubuntu will probably never be as community controlled as Debian is,\nbut I don't think it's bad. I think what Mark and Canonical do is really good.\nIMHO, Mark should get a Nobel prize for his attitude and accomplishments for the human race.\n\nA: From the Unity Launchpad page:\n\nDesigned by Canonical and the Ayatana community, Unity is all about the combination of familiarity and the future.\n\nHave a look at the Unity Launchpad page for more information. \n\nA: Unity is an open source project created at Canonical and like Ubuntu can be packaged with other distributions although I don't know of anyone else including Unity as a default desktop in their distribution yet but have it as an option. Control seems like such a strong term to be used in the context of open source. Oracle tried that with OpenOffice and it was forked along with the development team into LibreOffice. In the open source world you can lead, contribute and support a package but there are no patents or ownership that gives any individual or company control past the influence that comes with participation and support.\n\nA: Unity and Ubuntu are both Canonical products. They are pieces of sotfware developed by Canonical Ltd. You can contribute in their development either by filing bug reports, solving bugs, translating the software, etc on Launchpad.net, which is a collaboration and hosting platform for software projects owned by Canonical, or you can also share your opinion, propose new ideas and vote your favourite ones about Ubuntu and its interface, Unity, on Ubuntu Brainstorm page:\nhttp://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/\n\nA: This article is about unity, how it's designed and how you participate in it, I think it explains My main question very well. \n", "Q: Dell Inspiron N5010 overheating problem I've installed Ubuntu 11.10 on my Dell 5010. It gets too hot. (between 85°C and 90°C in idle). I searched around and found this question. but the solution doesn't worked for me.\nI think there is a problem with XOrg. It takes between 10% and 20% of CPU all times. I wonder if it's normal or not. Also there is a process named virtuoso-t sometimes takes 25% of process, when CPU usage of over 25%. (I guess one core is completely consumed by it). I always kill the virtuoso-t and don't know what is that.\nWhat should I do now?\n\nA: I have the same model of notebook, and I run dualboot Windows 7 and Fedora Core 15 on it. I struggled for the last year with overheating (it would actually shut down in BOTH Windows and FC) and tried all sorts of software solutions and fan controller setups, even pulling it apart to clean the fan. Some improvement, but problem quickly recurred.\nWhen I pulled it apart to clean it for the third time, upon putting it back together it wouldn't run for more than five seconds. I realized that taking it apart that many times had disengaged the thermal paste from the cpu core, and so it was overheating instantly. \nI bought some new thermal paste, cleaned the CPU and heatsink, applied the paste and put it back together. Now, ZERO problem. Not a single overheat, it runs sitting on carpet, with the carpet blocking the air intakes, WHILE it runs benchmark software for the CPU and GPU.\nIt's my opinion (as a BSc Computer Science student on the brink of graduation) that the thermal paste used at the Dell factory is awful quality, and should be replaced with some decent paste.\nHope this helps.\nHere's a youtube on how to correctly dismantle the notebook and how to apply thermal paste..\n", "Q: Configuring Evolution from .evolution and .local/share/evolution folders I reinstalled (not upgraded) my system from Natty to Ocelot this morning.

Most notably, I have a directory in my old home that contains the themes I use. This directory and it's contents are not copied over to the new home and therefore I come up with the default theme.

I installed Ubuntu (11.10 64bit) to my new laptop (Asus A53E-XT4), and would like to test capabilities, especially it's 6GB's of RAM.\nIs there any software in the Software Center (or on the web), that can help me do this?\nI tried running a couple of applications, but the RAM hasn't even passed to 3GB mark!\n\nA: I would recommend that you check out the phoronix test suite. You can install it by entering the following in a terminal: \nsudo apt-get install phoronix-test-suite\n\nHere is a quick run down on beginning steps in running the quake4 test.\nSome of the tests require a large amount of hard drive space, and could take a considerable amount of time to download the quake 4 test took over 10 minutes on a usually decent High-Speed connection, so make sure you're aware of this. \nphoronix-test-suite --list-available-tests\n\nYou will see a ton of choices. I chose to install the quake 4 test in this example.\nphoronix-test-suite install pts/quake4\n\nThis will pull down all the test and it's dependency files as seen in the image below:\n \nOnce it's finished downloading, you will then just enter the following in order to run the test:\nphoronix-test-suite run pts/quake4\n\nThere might be more specific results you're looking for, so just look through the available tests and suites and I'm sure you'll find something that suits you.\nPlease check out this link here for further documentation on how to use the suite.\n", "Q: How do I focus an \"urgent\" application?

(See compiz config settings for Unity.)\nHow can I set a keyboard command to bring that application to the front in Ubuntu 11.10? I had it set in 11.04, but I don't remember how.\nThis is useful when programs open in the background or if you activate them from another app. (I have an alias to send files to a single gvim instance from Terminal instead of opening them in their own window. When gvim gets the file, it wiggles but doesn't gain focus.)\n\nA: With the compiz-plugins-extra package installed (which isn't in the default install), there's an \"Extra WM Actions\" that has a \"activate demanding attention window\" keybinding.\n\nA: I found this answer helpful too.\nIt's not a hotkey, but it helps raise items to the foreground automatically when urgent. \nIn particular, I found this helped after a recent update when Ubuntu was failing to cycle windows correctly when using Alt+Tab.\n", "Q: How do I set the login manager to enable `change languages` at login?

Web browsing shouldn't use a lot of your i7's power, so that should provide some improvements. Here's more about jupiter.\nThere's also powernap (which I've never used).\nThere may be some answers in this thread.\n\nA: Your specific problem is probably the NVidia card drawing power, since you don't have any proper drivers. Installing those messes with Optimus, so that's out two. If you're open to slightly instable solutions, I can recommend Ironhide, available from this ppa: https://launchpad.net/~mj-casalogic/+archive/ironhide/ Note that the developer seems inactive, so don't expect any support. Ironhide is a solution that hacks hybrid graphics support through launching extra xorg sessions. In addition, it has a database with powersaving configurations. (I have a working configuration for the Asus K53SV, which has a GT540M, so chances are there's one for yours too.) Alternatively, there's Bumblebee, which is more stable but does not attempt to help you in powersaving, which is what your aim is.

When I identified the monitors, it showed that I had monitors 2 and 3 set to my first and second monitor. My guess is that monitor 2 or 3 was occluding monitor 1. This might be one of those rare cases where a computer problem (not properly identifying the monitors) creates bizarre behaviour as opposed completely crashing the system.\nIn my case, I fixed it by removing the Display Port (DP) to DVI adapter. My guess is that since it was an active display port, it was confusing the video card into thinking there was a third monitor.\n", "Q: Update manager won't update, Software Center will not open Could not initialize the package information\n\nAn unresolvable problem occurred while initializing the package information.\n\nPlease report this bug against the 'update-manager' package and include the following error message:\n\n'E:Type 'n.' is not known on line 3 in source list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pmcenery-ppa-oneiric.list, E:The list of sources could not be read., E:The package lists or status file could not be parsed or opened.'\n\n\nA: OP answered in a comment\n\nI fixed it by sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pmcenery-ppa-oneiric.list via terminal and taking n. out of the text\n\n", "Q: Monitor color after installation under windows I have installed the newest Ubuntu by wubi, and after then my monitor is not showing the colors correctly.

I need to be able to use Ubuntu on different computers with my external hard drive, with varying devices. And it needs to be a full (normal..ish) install. (No bootable+overlayfs persistence for me!)\nI'll probably be using computers with an i386 architecture, but the 32/64-bit could change.\nOr, I'll just hope for the best and just repart my drive and install.\n\nA: To use the external drive as made above, simply plug it in, boot the computer, go to BIOS and select the external drive as first hard drive. I have never hade to do the second half of the above proceedure.\nBIOS proceedure may vary with different makes of BIOS.\n\nA: Connect the External HD, boot from the Ubuntu installation CD and go through the install steps.  Make sure to choose Ext2 or FAT for your file system.  You can setup /, TMP and a swap drive on different partitions if you like.\nOnce you can boot Ubuntu from the external HD you need to use it on another computer with the same number of drives.  Best case one internal HD and a CD drive.  Ubuntu will try to boot from the same device all the time (e.g sb2)  If the computer has more drives, you need to edit the /etc/fstab file to change the boot device number.\n", "Q: Why is my volume sometimes not working when I start the computer?

It was probably an issue with the kernel as it has since been updated and haven't had the problem in sometime.\n", "Q: TIme of execution of daily anacron job I have set a daily anacron job, which runs form /etc/cron.daily.  From the /etc/crontab I see it should run daily at 06:25 (or at start-up/reboot).\nHowever when the date changes (00:00) and the computer is up, I dont want anacron to wait till 06:25. If the computer is up I would like to it to run the script as soon as the date changes (00:00). Does it make sense to add a cron job to run anacron @hourly?\nThank you very much\n\nA: I found how to do this and summarized it in my blogpost:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://opensourceresearchtips.blogspot.com/2012/01/linux-anacron-tips.html\nIf you want to change the behaviour of anacron to execute as soon as the day changes (and not wait till 7:30 as is the default behaviour) do the following:\ngksu gedit /etc/cron.d/anacron\n\nand add the last 2 lines (the last line will restart anacron every hour):\n01 0    * * *   root test -x /etc/init.d/anacron && /usr/sbin/invoke-rc.d anacron start >/dev/null\n01 0    * * *   root start -q anacron || :\n@hourly root start -q anacron || :\n\n\nA: The answer by Khaled is not correct. Changing this line will not have an effect if anacron is installed (which it is, by default):\n25 6    * * *   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.daily )\n\nIf anacron exists, test -x /usr/sbin/anacron will return true, and prevent the second half of that line from running. The other answer (editing /etc/cron.d/anacron) is correct, since that's the config that will kick off anacron itself.\n\nA: As of Ubuntu 19.10 (and maybe earlier) anacron is run using a systemd timer.\nSolution\nThe way to change anacron execution time is with this command:\nsudo systemctl edit --full anacron.timer\n\nThen modify the line:\nOnCalendar=*-*-* 07..23:30\n\nWhat doesn't work\nAs explained in other answers, editing /etc/crontab doesn't help.\n25 7    * * *   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.daily )\n\nThe part before the operator || only tests if anacron is installed, it doesn't execute anything. And the part after only get executed if the part before didn't complete successfully (lazy operator evaluation), which then would mean anacron isn't installed.\nEditing /etc/cron.d/anacron doesn't help either.\n30 7-23 * * *   root    [ -x /etc/init.d/anacron ] && if [ ! -d /run/systemd/system ]; then /usr/sbin/invoke-rc.d anacron start >/dev/null; fi\n\nThe condition if [ ! -d /run/systemd/system ] prevents the script from running when systemd is installed.\nThe correct way to change the execution time is by editing the systemd timer as explained at the begining.\n\nA: as per other answers:\nedit the first two columns of /etc/cron.d/anacron to change the time anachron runs.\n(/etc/crontab values don't take effect due to the || ...)\n\nA: You can just change the line:\n25 6    * * *   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.daily )\n\nto read\n0 0    * * *   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.daily )\n\nThis will make the execution of daily cron jobs start at midnight.\n", "Q: Is there an 11.04 package for gtk+-3.2.0? gtk+-3.2.0 has been out since 26-Sep-2011.

I've never actually been able to get Synergy working, even when using QuickSynergy. Even using this guide gives me nothing; my mouse won't leave the edge of my screen.

When I get problem with synergy on my Ubuntu (client), I just kill the daemon and re-run by this command.\n", "Q: How do I uncompress a tarball that uses .xz? I'm used to extracting tarballs with a -xfz flag, which handles gzip and bzip2 archives.\nRecently I've run into a .tar.xz file and I would like to uncompress it in one step using tar, how can I do that?\n\nA: If for some reason the tar solutions don’t work (perhaps because you’re using the OS X built-ins), try this:\nunxz < file.tar.xz > file.tar\n\n…which is equivalent to:\nxz -dc < file.tar.xz > file.tar\n\nThen use tar to untar the file.\n\nA: Just want to add that if you have an old version of GNU tar prior to version 1.22 when the --xz and -J options became available, you could compress or decompress tar.xz files by using --use-compress-program xz. For example,\ntar --use-compress-program xz -cf example.tar.xz file1 file2 file3\n\nor\ntar --use-compress-program xz -xf example.tar.xz\n\n\nA: If tar recognizes the compression format, you don't need a flag:\ntar xvf *.tar.xz\nIf you need to decompress the input manually, for example because your tar is too old to recognize xz, or you need a special path:\nxz -cd  *.tar.xz | tar xvf -\nPipes are faster than making an uncompressed intermediate file, and use less disk space too!\n\nA: xz is a lossless data compressor. You will have to extract the tar ball from xz and then extract the tar:\nunxz my_archive.tar.xz      # results in my_archive.tar\n\nThen you know to extract a tar\ntar -xf my_archive.tar\n\nSource: XZ Utils - Wikipedia. \n\nA: Wow, that's a really good one. Was it done with 7zip on a Mac? Try this:\n7z x -so file.tar.xz | tar xf -\n\n\nA: Ubuntu comes with Python (Python 2.7 and Python 3), which contains the necessary modules for extracting archives. So if for whatever reason tar command is missing (say your sysadmin has removed it and you don't have sudo privillege to install it), one can use:\npython3 -c 'import tarfile,sys; b = tarfile.open(sys.argv[1]);print(b.extractall())' ./archive.xz \n\nAs a short script,that's more readable as:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport tarfile,sys\n\nwith tarfile.open( sys.argv[1] ) as fd:\n    fd.extractall()\n\nSuppose I created an .xz file with tar cJf thing.xz /etc/passwd. The archive will contain etc directory with passwd file inside. Using the above script will result in etc directory created in your current working directory, and within it will be passwd file. Of course, this can always be extended by specifying path where you want to extract inside the extractall() function.\n\nA: I like dtrx\nsudo apt install dtrx\ndtrx your-file.tar.xz\n\n\nA: Try \ntar -xJf file.pkg.tar.xz\nThe -J is the flag that specifically deals with .xz files.\n\nA: I had the same problem, the tar xf command was not able to extract it.\nTo fix this, you need to install the xz-utils package.\nThe solution was:\nsudo apt-get install xz-utils\n\nthen:\ntar xf myfile.tar.xz\n\n\nA: tar -xvf package.tar.xz\n\n-x - extract files\n-v - verbosely list files processed\n-f - use specified archive file\n\nA: Ubuntu includes GNU tar, which recognizes the format by itself! One command works with any supported compression method, per the manual.\ntar xf archive.tar.xz\ntar xf archive.tar.gz\ntar xf archive.tar\n\netc. If tar gives a Cannot exec error, you may need to sudo apt install xz-utils first.\n\nA: unar is quite a  nice simple program and easy to type, to unarchive almost any format including 7z and RAR\nit seems to be written in (GNU) Objective-C and so requires installation of some gnustep (GNU's Objective-C implementation) libraries (gnustep-base-runtime and  libgnustep-base1.25)\nif you use --install-suggests or have configured apt to install suggested packages, unar will suggest and install many GUI GNUStep programs which are not what you want   \nsudo apt install --no-install-suggests unar \nunar linux-source.tar.xz\n\nit will create the output directory linux-source automatically.\n", "Q: Ubuntu has a different PATH when accessed over XRDP session Noob here: I have a problem, when i access my server via SSH, the $PATH is correct\nroot@ks391320:~# echo $PATH\n/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games\n\nBut when i open my server via XRDP session and go to the terminal it shows an incorrect PATH:\nroot@ks391320:~# echo $PATH\n/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/usr/local/bin\n\nScreenshot of both: \nAnd this creates an issue because when I try to install something using the \"Package Installer\" it shows this error (among others)\ndpkg: warning: 'ldconfig' not found in PATH\n\n\nA: For Ubuntu-18.04, edit  /etc/pam.d/xrdp-sesman  and enter the following lines at beginning:\nsession       required   pam_env.so readenv=1 envfile=/etc/environment\nsession       required   pam_env.so readenv=1 envfile=/etc/default/locale\n\n\nA: 1\nThe system-wide default PATH is defined in /etc/environment. First, verify that it's set to a sane value. For reference, here's mine, which is the same as a default install:\nPATH=\"/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games\"\n\n2\nIf /etc/environment is sane and you're still having issues, you can override the default PATH in ~/.bashrc. For example, I have this in my .bashrc which appends a directory to my PATH if and only if it exists and is not already in my PATH:\nif [ -d \"$HOME/bin\" ]; then\n    if [[ $PATH =~ $HOME/bin ]]; then :\n    else export PATH=\"$HOME/bin:$PATH\"\n    fi\nfi\n\nSince it appears from your screenshot that you've enabled root logins, be sure to set root's .bashrc, as well. (By the way, since root can't login by default in Ubuntu, this configuration is presumably less tested and might possibly be related to your problem.)\n3\nIf the first two methods fail, then check whether your XRDP client is doing something exotic. If so, you'll have to either configure it to work normally or identify a way to work around it.\nUpdate\nI've been doing some looking around the system. You can find all the places on your system that specify a PATH with the following command (the sudo is there because some files under /etc are unreadable by normal users):\nsudo egrep -nr '\\bPATH' /etc | less\n\nI think it's safe to ignore many of those places, resulting in the following command:\nsudo egrep -nr '\\bPATH' /etc | egrep -v '^/etc/(init|rc|ppp|bash_c)' | egrep -v '^Binary' | less\n\nOne file that looks possible (though I really don't know too much about it) is /etc/login.defs. You might take a look at it.\nIn addition, you could grep your dotfiles as well:\negrep -nr '\\bPATH' $HOME/.* | less\n\n\nA: Full disclosure: I don't use Ubuntu... but I had the same issue with Debian.\nxrdp launches /etc/xrdp/startwm.sh (unless Ubuntu has modified this location). I added this line:\n. /etc/profile\n\nto the top of /etc/xrdp/startwm.sh and the PATH is now set correctly.\nFor Ubuntu, adding \n. /etc/environment\n\nto the top of /etc/xrdp/startwm.sh might do the same.\n\nA: This stumped me for a while too.\n/etc/environment isn't a shell script, so you can't call it as one.\nWhat worked for me was to edit the xrdp session manager \"sesman\" script in pam.\n I added the \"session\" line to my /etc/pam.d/sesman file:\n#%PAM-1.0\nsession required pam_env.so readenv=1 user_readenv=0\n@include common-auth\n@include common-account\n@include common-session\n@include common-password\n\nThis makes the session manager load the /etc/environment file at login.\n\nA: In theory adding \n. /etc/environment\n\nwould work but it doesn't.  I just put it at the top of my .bashrc to correct the problem\n\nA: Thanks to the previous answers I came to such a solution:\ncat /etc/xrdp/startwm.sh | sed \"s/. \\/etc\\/X11\\/Xsession/. \\/etc\\/environment/\" > ./startwm.sh && echo \". /etc/X11/Xsession\" >> ./startwm.sh && sudo mv ./startwm.sh /etc/xrdp/startwm.sh && sudo chmod 755 /etc/xrdp/startwm.sh\n\nMay be not the most optimal but working (Ubuntu 12.04).\n\nA: @ John:  I believe you need to check your /etc/xrdpstartwm.sh - the first lines in mine reads,\nif [ -f /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc ]\nthen\n    . /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc\n    exit 0\nfi**\n\nThat means that if /etc/X11xinit/xinitrc exists, that file will be executed instead - and it won't help much to add the \n. /etc/environment\n\nto /etc/xrdpstartwm.sh.  :-)\n/Per Hertz\n\nA: Member of the xrdp packaging team here.\nThe just-uploaded xrdp_0.9.17-2.dsc (Debian sid) fixes this via the PAM configuration, after independent discovery by me, then confirmation from an xrdp project member.\nThe applied fix is:\n$ cat /etc/pam.d/xrdp-sesman \n#%PAM-1.0\nauth required pam_env.so readenv=1\nauth required pam_env.so readenv=1 envfile=/etc/default/locale\n@include common-auth\n@include common-account\n@include common-session\n@include common-password\n\nTherefore, the locale workaround could be removed, so that…\n$ cat /etc/xrdp/startwm.sh \n#!/bin/sh\n# xrdp X session start script (c) 2015, 2017, 2021 mirabilos\n# published under The MirOS Licence\n\n# Rely on /etc/pam.d/xrdp-sesman using pam_env to load both\n# /etc/environment and /etc/default/locale to initialise the\n# locale and the user environment properly.\n\nif test -r /etc/profile; then\n    . /etc/profile\nfi\n\ntest -x /etc/X11/Xsession && exec /etc/X11/Xsession\nexec /bin/sh /etc/X11/Xsession\n\n… is left properly in the wm startup file.\n", "Q: How to change the path of a folder to point to one in Windows Basically I'm wanting my Ubuntu music folder to direct me to my Windows music folder, so that when I click my Ubuntu music folder I see the contents of my Windows music folder.

Wubi installs ubuntu in a single file which acts as a partition. \n\n*The other way would be to install Ubuntu on a ext4 partition and then install the boot on the partition instead of the MBR and then follow instruction on this link. I would recommend ext3fsd instead of Ext2 IFS for the previous link as the former seems more recent and and better support for ext4. Installing the FS driver would allow windows to access the partition to boot it and then edit boot.ini to add linux partition to it.\n\n\nA: It depends what you mean by \"boot-loader.\" For example, it will not interfere with a Windows 7 boot partition: only the MBR in all cases. And it is not difficult to rewrite the MBR. To do this I almost always boot from an XP disc into the Recovery Console and then just fixmbr, which does the same job (writes a new MBR) as the older \"fdisk /mbr\" from Windows 98.

To install them run: \nsudo apt-get install intltool libclutter-1.0-dev libsoupcutter-dev libmx-dev libgrilo-0.1-dev libgstreamermm-0.10-dev libclutter-gst-dev liblircclient-dev  libtracker-sparql-0.10-dev libavahi-glib-dev librest-dev libavahi-client-dev\n\nDownload the tar file from media-explorer's site:\nwget https://github.com/downloads/media-explorer/media-explorer/media-explorer-0.3.4.tar.xz\n\nExtract:\ntar -xvf media-explorer-0.3.4.tar.xz\n\nThen cd into the Directory:\ncd media-explorer-0.3.4\n\n./configure --prefix=/usr && make && sudo make install\n\nYou should then be able to launch media-explorer. There were a couple of warnings that appeared in my terminal, I am not familiar with this application, but do plan to play around with it a bit now!\n\n\n", "Q: How do I hide a particular user from the login screen? How do I hide a particular user from the login screen on a default install of 11.10 and higher? (ie. using Unity Greeter)?\n\nA: Currently this method is not working because of a bug in lightdm.\nPlease check the bug status before applying this method.\n\nHeres what you want to do:\nFirst, make a backup of your config.\nsudo cp /etc/lightdm/users.conf /etc/lightdm/users.conf.bak\n\nThen, you need to edit your config:\nsudo nano /etc/lightdm/users.conf\n\nYou'll see something like this:\n#\n# User accounts configuration\n#\n# NOTE: If you have AccountsService installed on your system, then LightDM will\n# use this instead and these settings will be ignored\n#\n# minimum-uid = Minimum UID required to be shown in greeter\n# hidden-users = Users that are not shown to the user\n# hidden-shells = Shells that indicate a user cannot login\n#\n[UserAccounts]\nminimum-uid=500\nhidden-users=nobody nobody4 noaccess\nhidden-shells=/bin/false /usr/sbin/nologin\n\nOf interest to us is the part here:\nhidden-users=nobody nobody4 noaccess\nTo hide the username james, just add it like this:\nhidden-users=nobody nobody4 noaccess james\nThen, reboot your computer and it should be gone.\nAs a reference to others, see\nSee https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/accountsservice/+bug/857651\nOn some versions of lighdm (Ubuntu 14.04) you need to rename [UserAccounts] to [UserList] (in /etc/lightdm/users.conf) for this method to work. (If you're interested in why this may be necessary, see common/user-list.c:321 from lightdm source.)\n\nA: This method is not works on Ubuntu 13.10.\nTo hide user login names correctly You must to open LightDM config:\nsudo vim /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf\n\nand add the following options:\ngreeter-hide-users=true\ngreeter-show-manual-login=true\n\nThen save and reboot. That's all.\n\nA: Your option until bug 857651 is fixed is to create the user with uid < 1000\nFor example, to assign new uid less than 1000, (we are using 999) use this command \nsudo usermod -u 999 user-name\n\nReplace the user-name with the actual user name, just as anwar or detly etc.\n\nA: If your system uses AccountsService, you can not hide a user from the greeter screen by reconfiguring lightdm because it defers to AccountsService.  That is stated very clearly in the comments in /etc/lightdm/users.conf.\n\nWhat you need to do instead is to reconfigure AccountsService.\nTo hide a user named XXX, create a file named\n/var/lib/AccountsService/users/XXX\n\ncontaining two lines:\n[User]\nSystemAccount=true\n\nIf the file already exists, make sure you append the SystemAccount=true line to the [User] section.\nThe change takes effect after reloading AccountsService:\nsudo systemctl restart accounts-daemon.service\n\n\nA: because the Ubuntu 12.04 setup  \n[UserAccounts]  \nminimum-uid=500\n\nso we need to reduce the uid less than 500\nexample: sudo usermod -u 499 user-name\nIt works with me! SOLVED\nGood luck.\n\nA: This a variation of James' answer. You can hide users in lightDM by simply assigning them an ID below the minimum ID found in:\n/etc/lightdm/users.conf\n\nOn my PC it was 1000\n# minimum-uid = Minimum UID required to be shown in greeter\n# hidden-users = Users that are not shown to the user\n# hidden-shells = Shells that indicate a user cannot login\n#\n[UserAccounts]\nminimum-uid=1000\n\nYou can change UID easilly in terminal:\nsudo usermod -u PutUserNameHere\n\nIt works on my PC (in 2016), so I guess the lightDM bug that Eliah Kagan mentioned in 2014 with regards James' answer has been resolved.\n\nA: In Ubuntu:\nprintf \"[User]\\nSystemAccount=true\\n\" | sudo tee /var/lib/AccountsService/users/libvirt-qemu\nsudo systemctl restart accounts-daemon.service \n\n", "Q: Unity (Ubuntu) option is missing from login menu After purging and reinstalling Nautilus, Unity is missing and everything defaults to GNOME Classic.

It seems the only way I can run Unity is by running unity --replace in the terminal. \nIs there a way to get things back to normal without a clean install? \n\nA: Most likely you removed some packages that depend on Nautilus but did not reinstall them.\nMake sure that the package ubuntu-desktop is installed, for example by running\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\n\nin a terminal.\n", "Q: No desktop showing Dell Latitude D531  I recently installed Ubuntu 11.10 on a Dell D531 Laptop instead of Windows 7.

I've a 250gb drive and I've split it in 3 partitions:One for Windows 7, one for Ubuntu and a shared partition for both windows and Ubuntu. I've format the drive correctly and I've installed the 2 operating systems. Using gParted there are 4 partitions 3 NTFS (Windows 7, a small partition for Windows and the shared one) and an ext4 partition for Ubuntu . I can't create a swap file .

Finish following the tutorial by running swapon and editing /etc/fstab.\n\nA: I belive is a limitation on the number of partitions your filesystem can handle. primary  partitions are limited to 4 partitions, I recently had a similar problem with a friend notebook and took me sometime to figure it out. you have 2 choices, change the partitions scheme and add the swap partition as logical by creating space through resizing the common  between win/ubuntu or if you have ample ram i.e >4gb giveup on using a swap file.\n", "Q: How do I get permissions to edit system configuration files? I can't seem to edit and save config files in the root system (eg: /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.config); it just says \"permission denied\" or the save option is blocked in the text editor.\nI'm pretty sure I'm a root user, but how do I make sure? If I am a root user, how do I fix this?\n\nA: You can test if your current shell is running as root a few different ways\n~/ > whoami\npaul\n~/ > sudo whoami\nroot\n~/ > id\nuid=1000(paul) gid=1000(paul) groups=1000(devs),4(adm),20(dialout),24(cdrom),…\n~/ > sudo id\nuid=0(root) gid=0(root) group=0(root)\n\nOther answers give good ways to escalate to root privilege, so I won't repeat those.  Assuming you are root and you still can't edit the file /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.config - then very probably someone or some program has used the chattr program to make the file immutable.\nFrom the chattr manual page:\n\nA file with the 'i' attribute cannot be modified: it cannot be deleted or renamed, no link can be created to this file and no data can be written to the file. Only the superuser or a process possessing the CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE capability can set or clear this attribute.\n\nYou can find out by using lsattr\nlsattr /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.config\n\nIf indeed it's immutable you can turn that off like this:\nchattr -i /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.config\n\n\nA: Which text editor are you using? If you are a sudoer and know your password, try (in a terminal) either:\n\n*\n\n*sudoedit /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.config if you are using a terminal-based editor such as nano or are ssh'ing into a server.\n\n*gedit admin:///etc/dhcp/dhcpd.config using the the admin:// protocol with GNOME applications such as gedit (and others that support GVfs).\n\n*sudo -H <text editor> /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.config for GUI editors in general.\n\n*In old versions of Ubuntu, gksudo <text editor here> /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.config could be used to launch GUI editors.\n\nIn either case, you'll need to first provide your password when requested.\nIn Ubuntu 14.04 onwards, gksudo is not installed by default. You will have to install the gksu package (either from the Software Centre or via sudo apt-get install gksu) to get it.\nIn Ubuntu 17.10, Wayland is default instead of the traditional X server, and running graphical editors as root is difficult. See Why don't gksu/gksudo or launching a graphical application with sudo work with Wayland? for details.\nIn Ubuntu 18.04, gksudo is not available in the official repositories.\n\nA: If you are using Ubuntu 17.04 or higher, it is recommended to use the gvfs admin backend. Simply add admin:// to the front of the full filepath you want to open in an app like the Text Editor or the Files apps.\nFor instance, to change boot settings, open\nadmin:///etc/default/grub\n\nIf you are using Ubuntu 17.10 with the default Wayland, sudo and gksu as mentioned in the older answer here will not work.\n\nA: Use Your Favourite Text Editor\nYou can use sudo -e or its alias sudoedit with your favourite (graphical!) text editor through the VISUAL environment variable1:\nVISUAL=gedit sudo -e /path/to/some-config-file.cfg\n\nwhich is equivalent to\nVISUAL=gedit sudoedit /path/to/some-config-file.cfg\n\nOf course you can use any other editor that you like, e. g. leafpad, kate, or subl.\nSome editor offer a command-line option to always start a new instance, even if one is currently running. Since sudoedit waits for the editor process to terminate to apply changes to the edited file, this may be necessary if you have other instances of the same Editor running:\n\n\n*\n\n*For GEdit use VISUAL='gedit -s'.\n\n*For Kate use VISUAL='kate -n'.\n\n\n\nAdvantages\n\n\n*\n\n*Doesn’t require additional and/or deprecated applications.\n\n*Doesn’t require security policy changes like pkexec (for which you’d need to edit files… as super-user, the exact thing this answer is trying to solve).\n\n*Doesn’t require the execution of potentially unsafe applications with elevated privileges.\n\n*Uses the current user’s application configuration but mess with the configuration file access permissions like sudo -H etc.\n\n*Doesn’t fall back onto the user application configuration data of the root user which may or may not look and behave acceptably.\n\n\nDisadvantages\n\n\n*\n\n*You need to learn a short new command.\n\n\n\n1 EDITOR or SUDO_EDITOR work too but take less priority or are more specialised respectively. See the manual page for details.\n\nA: If you don't want to use a terminal, you can invoke a GUI program as root thus (this example is for Gedit):\n\n\n*\n\n*Hit Alt+F2 to bring up the Run dialog.\n\n*Type gksudo followed by the executable name of your program (which might be different from the name displayed by the GUI). For example:\ngksudo gedit\n\n\n*Hit Enter.\n\n\nA: I can't think of a case where root would get permission denied.  \nIn 12.04 you can do it like this:  alt+f2 and enter gksudo in the box that appears like this:  \n\nYou get a box like this and enter gedit and click ok:  \n\nClick Open:  \n \nJust browse to the file:  \n \nDone\nWarning:  There is a super-user/root for a reason.  It's so that you don't accidentally put something bad or out of structure in something important by mistake.  You should be exceedingly careful that whatever you edit as root is the correct file you mean to edit AND that your syntax is perfect.  If other tools are available for editing, it's recommended to use those. For instance, use the visudo terminal command instead of manually editing /etc/sudoers.\nSome files that could get messed up are easy to recover from.  Others are relatively complicated or you have to use recovery console and a lot of command lines.  \nYes the recovery console command line seems a little scarier than even this.  Just be careful.\n\nA: To be safe back it up using cp /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.config /$HOME/dhcpd.config.backup\nand run gksu gedit /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.config\nReplace gedit with the editor of your choice\nyou will get a prompt like this\n\nEnter your password here.\nA new window opens and you can edit your config there.\nIn case something goes wrong you can restore it from your backup in the home folder.\nYou get \"permission denied\" because of how Linux handles permission.\nAnything in the $HOME folder belongs to the user, whereas almost anything else belongs to root. \nThe /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf file you are trying to access belongs to root, and most files in /etc/ belong to root by default for security reasons.\nYou can still edit this file by elevating your permissions.\nTo do this you have a number of ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*use su which stands for switch user. Without any attributes to it, it functions as a command to switch to the root account, but you need to enter the password of the user you are switching to, and since root has no password by default on Ubuntu (effectively disabling the root account), this won't work unless you have set a password for root, which is not recommended.\n\n*using sudo which elevates your permission for only one command. This is generally used only for command-line apps such as CLI text editors like vim,nano etc\n\n*using gksu which elevates your permission for only one command, but unlike sudo is used for graphical programs such as GUI text editors like gedit . it uses a graphical prompt to facilitate entering of a password.\n\nA: sudo < editor > < filelocation >\n\ne.g.: \nsudo -H gedit etc/dhcp/dhcpd.config\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to log in as another user within an already-running session? Is it possible to log in as another user within an already-running session in Ubuntu 11.10 (as it was with Xephyr or Xnest under GDM)?\n\nA: The easiest way to do this is to use the Ctrl-Alt-F1 through F6 virtual terminals. This will give you a new login prompt and shell access to the system, so you can log in as a different user, or the same user. Crtl-Alt_F7 will switch back to the current graphical desktop.\nOnce there you can start another X session with startx -- :1\n\nA: It is quite simple. Click on your username on the top Panel and there you can choose the other user to login between the available users, without logging out the first user.\nIt will also show you the other \"connected\" users.\n\nA: I am a beginner myself so I hope my answer might help you. I beleive it is possible. But if you try to login in a VNC session the applications wont work in case they are running. For instance, if firefox is running on the specific machine, you won be able to start it on your terminal.

You can set a custom game resolution by editing lines in ~/.etracer/options: \nset x_resolution X\nset y_resolution Y\n\nwhere X and Y are your desired game width and height. If you set them to your normal resolution dimensions, the game should never \"enlarge\" your screen to begin with.\n\nA: You can wrap the game executable in simple script:\n#!/bin/sh\n\n# get current resolution\nPREV_RES=$(xrandr -q | grep '^ *[0-9]*x[0-9]*' | awk '/\\*/{print $1}')\n\n# start the game\n/path/to/my/game    # <---- CHANGE THIS !!!!\n\n# restore previous resolution\nxranrd -s $PREV_RES\n\nThen use this script to start the game.\nI didn't test it on multi-monitor configuration.

(Installed correctly). I thought then that using ATI drivers isn't the best idea since I have an integrated intel HD 3000 (sandy bridge) GPU (with ATI AMD Radeon HD 6470M). So I reinstalled ubuntu 11.10 and did the following to solve the problem : \n1. I used Intel integrated drivers\n\nsince all eye candies worked well with integrated gpu i stuck with it (used default ubuntu open drivers)\n2. Followed this guide from Ubuntu Forums\n\nI used only 1. and 2. (a,b) in this tutorial :\n1. Apply PCIE_ASPM\n\n(Source: Phoronix)\n\nAs everyone suggested adding this for laptops to have longer battery life. I edited /etc/default/grub as\n\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash pcie_aspm=force i915.i915_enable_rc6=1 i915.i915_enable_fbc=1\"\n\nand then running\n\n$ sudo update-grub\n\nNote: I previously had added acpi_osi=Linux pci=noacpi (on worst condition of black screen), which I think is no more required, because the computer boots on to GUI without them. Above command enables power management, sandy bridge support (rc6) and frame buffer compression.<br/>\n\n2. Apply Support for Hybrid Graphics\n\n(Source: Linux Hybrid Graphics)\n\nFor those of you who don't have two graphics card this step is not required. In Ubuntu 11.04 I had bug while installing this, so I could not run vgaswitcheroo/switch\n\na. Install acpi_call\n$ sudo apt-get install git\n$ cd /tmp\n$ git clone https://github.com/mkottman/acpi_call.git\n$ cd acpi_call\n$ make\n$ sudo insmod acpi_call.ko\n$ lscpi -vnnn | grep VGA # Check status here\n$ ./test_off.sh # Check for any line that says \"it works\"\n$ lspci -vnnn | grep VGA # Check with result of above\n\nb. byo-switheroo (Unplug the ac-cord and see if it changes the battery life)\n\n$ git clone https://github.com/awilliam/asus-switcheroo.git\n$ cd asus-switcheroo\n$ make\n$ sudo make install-ubuntu\n$ sudo su -\n# cat /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch\n# echo OFF > /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch\n\nIt is temporary. If you have two graphics cards next time you boot, you will see both cards have Pwr set. If you want this to be permanent add the discrete card (e.g ati as blacklist). This settings will only enable the default intel card and disable other card. I haven't found yet a solution to flawlessly switch intel and ati cards. The better solution would be ati card using dedicated applications via catalyst control center.\n\n$ sudo vi /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\n\nAdd a line at last\n\nblacklist radeon\n\nThen edit /etc/rc.local as\n$ vi /etc/rc.local\n\nMake the part after comments look like this\n\nmodprobe radeon\necho OFF > /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch\n\nexit 0\n\n3.Followed this guide\n*Kudos to heiko81 ;)\nJupiter will show up in your notification bar. Click it and go to performance modes -> power saver, for lower temps.\n4.Restart\nTemperature will lower for sure, about 50 when idle and 55 when busy.\nConclusion (the Trick)\nThe trick was to utilize the following command\necho OFF > /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch\n\nto lower the temperature of cpu and to slow down the fan. (to enable this permanently go back to step 2). When you enable this your GPU temperature reading will disappear (shows -128c) but when you restart it will measure GPU as usual.\nBONUS\nFor measuring temperature I advise you to use XSensors (sudo apt-get install XSensors) and calibrate your sensors with sensors-detect\nThat is pretty it. Give me feedback on this solution, it worked for me on HP Pavilon g6, it gave me severe headache though.

I need to create a book cover, and would like to know what are the possible ways to do that using Ubuntu or Debian packages -- but I'm not an expert in graphic design. So far I know of:\n\n\n*\n\n*LaTeX: it would possibly take too long to get all details right (choosing the right fonts, positioning elements, etc)\n\n*Scribus: seems to not make common tasks easy (I couldn't easily find a way to centralize text in a frame, or a frame in a page for example)\n\n*Gimp: a bit too complex maybe.\n\n\nAre there any other packages that would make the task easier?\nedit: it's my own book (self-publishing -- it's not for a publishing company). I'll probably want one or two images, the title and one or two lines of text.\n\nA: Well that heavily depends on your needs. The packages/ways that you mentioned are not overly complex given the tasks that they can solve. \nYou should probably give more details on: \nWhat do you want on the book cover, and who needs that cover? \nE.g. If you have a publishing company, then they might want a certain format. \nTo give some basic recommendations:\nAssuming you want text, then why not use LibreOffice Writer (or KOffice or Abiword)? \nAssuming you want graphics, then Inkscape (or LibreOffice Draw) might be another option. \n\nA: There's nothing particularly difficult about handling alignment of objects on a page or text inside text frame.\nFor the former use Align and Distribute palette (available from Windows menu), for the latter look inside Properties Palette (F2) on the Text tab (or use text styles , F3) from ground up.\nIf you are a designer, you are supposed to grok professional software :)\n", "Q: Why does Gnome System monitor never tell me what process is actually using the CPU? I have an applet in my Gnome Panel which shows me the current load of my CPU. This is important on my laptop because it's a slightly older machine, and so knowing when I should let it finish one task before starting another stops me from getting frustrated with it.\nHowever, sometimes when the CPU is maxing out at 100%, and stays there for a while, it can be an indication that something has gone wrong and maybe I should kill the process.\nHowever, I've noticed over years of using Ubuntu that the System Monitor never really informs me what's going on.\nTake for example, this screenshot (the interface is in Japanese, but that shouldn't change the problem):\n\nJust above the System Monitor itself is my panel applet, where the box filled with green just to the right of the battery indicator is also indicating 100% CPU usage.\nNow look at this image:\n\nNothing is using any more than 7% of the CPU.\nThis seems to be very frequently the case - I dare say almost always - that when the CPU is maxing out, I can never see what is actually using those CPU cycles.\nI have tried using HTOP at the command line as well, but the results are the same.\nWhy does the System Monitor always show me 100% CPU use in general, but never more than a few % when I look at the total of specific processes?\nWhat am I supposed to do when I want to figure out what is using so much CPU time, should I want to to kill runaway processes, or at the very least know what the process is?\n\nA: As suggested by Cedric Julien in the comments, \nTo view all the processes that are using CPU, when using System Monitor, go to the View menu and select All Processes\n\n\nA: You can use KSysGuard, which by default shows all processes, looks a bit nicer (e.g. alternate colors for the row of processes), and has more options than System Monitor.\n\nYou don't need KDE to use KSysGuard on Ubuntu. Just run sudo apt install ksysguard.\n\nA: I've observed two phenomena that could account for the discrepancy OP is seeing, and which aren't often mentioned in answers to questions like this. Sadly, they're not that helpful in terms of identifying the actual process.\n\n*\n\n*At the command line, you can observe a list of processes with resource usage by using the top command. In particular, you should see a line like this:\n%Cpu(s):  0.3 us,  0.2 sy,  0.0 ni, 24.9 id, 74.6 wa,  0.0 hi,  0.0 si,  0.0 st\n\nPress 1 to show this per-individual-CPU. You should see something like:\n%Cpu0  :  1.3 us,  0.3 sy,  0.0 ni,  0.0 id, 98.3 wa,  0.0 hi,  0.0 si,  0.0 st\n%Cpu1  :  0.3 us,  0.0 sy,  0.0 ni,  0.0 id, 99.7 wa,  0.0 hi,  0.0 si,  0.0 st\n%Cpu2  :  0.3 us,  0.7 sy,  0.0 ni,  0.0 id, 99.0 wa,  0.0 hi,  0.0 si,  0.0 st\n%Cpu3  :  1.3 us,  0.3 sy,  0.0 ni, 98.3 id,  0.0 wa,  0.0 hi,  0.0 si,  0.0 st\n\nThe above information was taken from a situation when System Monitor showed 0% CPU usage for all processes except itself, but the panel applet showed fluctuating usage between 72% and 78%. Note that while CPU 3 shows 98.3% idle, the other CPUs show high percentage values for wa.\nWhat does wa signify? Well, I'm not sure if the rules prevent linking to other Stacks, but there's an excellent question on unix.SE which includes this description:\nwa: io wait cpu time (or) % CPU time spent in wait (on disk)\nSo the panel applet is showing high CPU usage from processes that are waiting on disk I/O, but the CPU cycles involved in this are not reported by System Monitor itself. I also haven't been able to get this information to show in htop.\nBTW, I understand that this waiting-on-I/O state is known as \"iowait\".\nI'm trying to find out whether other tasks can use the CPU while it's in iowait, instead of leaving it stuck in idleness, but I'm not having much luck finding this information.\n\n\n*In MATE's System Monitor, the percentage values in the \"CPU Usage\" column are all integers. I'm not sure whether the actual values are rounded up, down, or to the nearest integer. But if they're not being rounded up, ten processes with 0.3% usage each could all show as 0%, even though their actual usage would add up to three percent.\nLike OP, I have a fairly old machine, so the discrepancy between:\n\n*\n\n*CPU usage (as reported by the panel applet)\nand\n\n*total usage (as obtained by adding up the percentages in the System Monitor CPU columns)\n\nis very frustrating when the panel reports high usage but I can't find any process that could account for it!\n", "Q: How can I grep through tab completion possibilities? When I press tab in a console I get this output\n\nDisplay all 2957 possibilities? (y or n)\n\nIs there any way to use grep on these 2957 possibilities? I would like to search for all commands with the word \"svn\" in them.\n\nA: The solution is the bash builtin compgen. To grep 'svn' from all available commands and command aliases accessible through $PATH, type.\ncompgen -ac | grep svn\n\nWant to search from a certain prefix (eg all commands that start with ecrypt)? Use regular expressions..\ncompgen -ac | grep \"^ecrypt\"\n\n\nA: You can try using compgen.\nFor example:\ncompgen -ac | grep \"svn\"\n\n\nA: This should be equivallent:\nfor x in `echo $PATH | sed 's/:/ /g'`; do ls $x | grep svn; done\n\n\nA: for i in $(echo $PATH | tr \":\" \"\\n\"); do find $i -type f -perm +111; done | grep svn\n\nVery similar to totaam's answer apart from this limits its scope to executables (as Bash does). But JJE's compgen is another mile better.\n\nA: maybe {,.}*svn* helps here, e.g. ls -l /usr/bin/{,.}*svn*<tab>.\nBut, have a look on the Zsh! Here: http://www.jukie.net/bart/blog/zsh-tab-completion are some great examples how it can help to reduce your tab completion results. This includes also negation, e.g. if you want all tab-completion results without the word \"foobar\", or all results with even digits in the first place, subdirectory tab-completion and much more. The reason why I changed to zsh was history sharing between all open terminals.\n\nA: I didn't knew compgen, and would have suggested:\nls -d ${PATH//:/\\/*svn* } 2>/dev/null\n\nfor bash. \n${VAR//pattern/replace} replaces in VAR pattern with replace. // is used to replace every pattern, not just the first, which would be just /.\n\n", "Q: How to install Adobe Digital Editions How can I install Adobe Digital Editions on Ubuntu?\nI've read that this is possible using Wine, but I can't download the installer from the Adobe page (as this installer is an online flash installer and requires Windows).\n(I need to open the book I have purchased which is currently in .acsm format)\n\nA: I've been through a process of installing, uninstalling and reinstalling various versions of Adobe Digital Editions (ADE). There is useful information on which versions of ADE will work on which versions of Wine at the WineHQ website. I found the options below worked for installing  ADE on an Ubuntu 14.04LTS system (32-bit). \nFor all these options, I was able to open some acsm files and download related ebooks. However, only ADE 4.0 allowed me to download ebooks from Google Play that I required. Attempting to download these Google Play ebooks produced a 2038 error on ADE 1.7 and an “E_STREAM_ERROR” on ADE 3.0. I suspect this is due to recent changes in DRM.\nINSTALLING ADE 1.7 --- Install Wine and WineTricks (you may need to add the Wine ppa – see https://www.winehq.org/download/ubuntu). Open WineTricks. In the first dialog box take option “Install an app”. On the second dialog box, take option “adobe_diged”. WineTricks will do the rest. Voila! Note that there are numerous older posts in forums that recommend ADE V1.7 over V2.0 and V3.0. \nINSTALLING ADE 3.0 --- You'll need Wine and Winetricks for this too (see above for their installation), but the process is a bit more involved. You need to download and install dotnet35sp1 and windowscodecs before running the ADE installation exe. This can be done by opening a terminal and entering this command:\n$ winetricks -q dotnet35sp1 windowscodecs\n\nINSTALLING ADE 4.0 --- This option also requires Wine and WineTricks but it requires more advanced versions and the process is even more involved. Nonetheless, there are very comprehensive instructions at: https://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=30928 – follow this link and find the instructions under the comment titled, “How to install ADE-4.xx on ubuntu-14.04 step by step in a console”. \n\nA: The clue was in the text underneath the install box:\n\nIf you have trouble installing Digital Editions, see the installation TechNote.\n\nSee the \"Manually install Adobe Digital Editions for Windows\" section.

What is a better way of fixing than using 'unity --replace'? I am using Ubuntu Oneiric and have kept fully up-to-date with updates. My GPU is a Radeon HD6970, for which I am using the open-source Radeon drivers. The only change I have made to the 'default environment' is forcing the GPU to use a low power profile, by adding 'echo \"low\" > /sys/class/drm/card0/device/power_profile' to /etc/rc.local .\nWhenever I suspend the machine through Ubuntu's power/settings menu, it sleeps just fine. After waking up however, obvious graphical glitches are present. Windows move remarkably less smooth and content in the browser is unreadable, for example. Hitting Alt+F2 and entering 'unity --replace', although moving all windows to the upper-left corner, fixes this.\nNow I am looking for a more elegant, or at least a more automatic way of getting the job done. On IRC I was told to either fix the driver problems or add the aforementioned command in a pm-utils script. I am not sure how to do the latter, let alone the former.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: With pm-utils, you can use a simple scritp to change the power profile like this :\nJust use this commands :\nsudo gedit /usr/lib/pm-utils/power.d/ati\n\nCopy this text in the ati file :\n#!/bin/sh\n\ncase $1 in\n    true) echo low > /sys/class/drm/card0/device/power_profile ;;\n    false) echo high > /sys/class/drm/card0/device/power_profile ;;\n    *) exit $NA ;;\nesac\n\nexit 0\n\nAnd use this command to make it executable :\nsudo chmod +x /usr/lib/pm-utils/power.d/ati\n\nIt works for me. On battery, I use the low profile and, on AC, I use the high profile.\nYou can use this profiles (https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/ATI) :\n\n\n*\n\n*\"default\" uses the default clocks and does not change the power state. This is the default behavior.\n\n*\"auto\" selects between \"mid\" and \"high\" power states based on the whether the system is on battery power or not. The \"low\" power state are selected when the monitors are in the dpms off state.\n\n*\"low\" forces the gpu to be in the low power state all the time. Note that \"low\" can cause display problems on some laptops; this is why auto only uses \"low\" when displays are off.\n\n*\"mid\" forces the gpu to be in the \"mid\" power state all the time.

This is really stupid but I've been Googling for an hour now and can't find the answer.\nI'm on Ubuntu 10.10, and I'm trying to update to the latest version of SASS so that I can use an @import rule inside an @media rule.\nAs suggested here; https://github.com/nex3/sass/issues/64, I tried:\n$ sudo gem install sass --pre\nAnd that seemed to work fine:\nSuccessfully installed sass-3.2.0.alpha.35\n1 gem installed\n\nBut when I try $ sass -v I get: Haml/Sass 3.0.9 (Classy Cassidy) which is the old version I had before updating.\nWhat am I doing wrong?\n$ which gem\n/usr/bin/gem\n\n$ which sass\n/usr/bin/sass\n\nTried the answer:\n$ sass -v\nHaml/Sass 3.0.9 (Classy Cassidy)\n\n$ sudo gem uninstall -Iax sass\nRemoving sass\nRemoving sass-convert\nRemoving scss\nSuccessfully uninstalled sass-3.2.0.alpha.35\n\n$ sass -v\nHaml/Sass 3.0.9 (Classy Cassidy) (Was expecting an error here)\n\n$ sudo gem install sass --pre\nSuccessfully installed sass-3.2.0.alpha.35\n1 gem installed\nInstalling ri documentation for sass-3.2.0.alpha.35...\nInstalling RDoc documentation for sass-3.2.0.alpha.35...\n\n$ sass -v\nHaml/Sass 3.0.9 (Classy Cassidy)\n\nSo it removes the one I successfully installed and leaves the one that actually gets used when I run the sass command. Thougts?\n\nA: What we ended up doing was the following:\nFirst, we installed rvm using the rails ready one-liner:\nwget --no-check-certificate https://raw.github.com/joshfng/railsready/master/railsready.sh && bash railsready.sh\nSelecting option 2 (RVM) when asked.\nThen, we did source ~/.bashrc \nThen we did a gem install sass --pre (no sudo).\n\nA: Remove it and then reinstall:\nsudo gem uninstall -Iax sass\nsudo gem install sass --pre\n\n\nNew Edit: I've just seen that you might have been using the haml-edge gem (which packs its own copy of sass). Nuke that and install sass-proper.\nsudo gem uninstall -Iax haml-edge\nsudo gem install sass --pre\n\nBoom.\n\nOld Edit if you've still got stuff left over it sounds like there's been a manual install, another gem has set something up or you've installed it from a package. I'd be tempted to tell you to nuke it from orbit and fix it later.\nRun nano $(which sass) and see what you're dealing with. In my gem-installed version I see a header like:\n#!/usr/bin/ruby1.8\n#\n# This file was generated by RubyGems.\n#\n# The application 'sass' is installed as part of a gem, and\n# this file is here to facilitate running it.\n\nIf you see something similar, that suggests there's something fishy and I vote you just run:\nsudo rm \"$(which sass)\" \"$(which sass-convert)\" \"$(which scss)\"\n\nIf there's a different header in there, it might give you a clue where it came from. If it's a package you've installed, remove it. If you can't (eg it's a dependency) you could nuke the file and replace accordingly (knowing that it might break the dependency anyway).\nBut at the end of the day, it's only a Ruby gem.

Alright, I don't know if it's a good idea to challenge these two, is there any relation between them?\nI understand LAMPP: it's the installation of Apache, MySql, PHP and Perl (or Python) on Linux.\nBut I don't quite understand what the Ubuntu server is.\nPlease, explain me what I can do with Ubuntu server and if it has any relation with LAMPP. (if yes, is it better than LAMPP?).\nThank you.\n\nA: The Ubuntu Server is the 'L' in 'LAMP'; that is to say, Ubuntu Server is a Linux-based Operating System (L) on which people run the Apache HTTP Server (A) with MySQL or MariaDB for data storage (M) and Python, Perl, or PHP for scripting (P).\nPeople also run Debian, CentOS, and RedHat as their L. Ubuntu is growing pretty popular as a LAMP OS because of its quick installation and deployment, as well as five years of free LTS (Long Term Supported) support from Canonical.\n\nA: L -- Linux\nUbuntu is a Linux distribution. \nA distribution has a standard protocl for installing and removing applications, libraries and dependant files. This is called a packaging system.\nUbuntu uses Debian( another linux distribution) packaging system and apt tools to package and install the tools and applications used in the linux ecosystem more graphically user friendly and better integrated. \nUbuntu Server is the same linux distribution with packages tuned for deployment as a server. When using ubuntu server, one could get support from Canonical and have the benefits of tools like landscape for monitoring.\nThe main difference between having ubuntu server packages and using any other LAMPstack like would be the ease of upgrading and downgrading based on availability of packages. \nYes, using ubuntu server is better than using a LAMPstack. Better documented technique of hosting an application , more secure way of organising the filesystem and finally, the possibility of getting support from canonical support staff.\n", "Q: Whole computer freezes randomly when playing using Wine The problem is that when I play GTA: Vice City or San Andreas, for example, the computer may freeze.\nIt happens randomly, I can play several times for half an hour a day and don't get the freeze and the next day I can get it easily.\nI tried running with the latest updates (OS, video driver and Wine) and without them on older versions of the stuff, but it doesn't matter: I get crashes in each case.\nRunning Ubuntu 11.10 Oneiric Ocelot, video card HIS Radeon HD4850 11.12 Catalyst, Wine 1.3.36 now.\nIn Catalyst everything is set to better performance, Catalyst AI - Advanced.\n\nIn Wine vertex shader is disabled to avoid a game bug (peds were too dark), 'window settings' are all checked, desktop size is 1920x1080 (maximum).\nThere are two monitors, I'm playing on #1 only, they are set to mirror each other.\nThe computer seems to be fully hung up: Ctrl+Alt+Backspace or Ctrl+Alt+F1 don't work, but Alt+PrtScr+r,s,e,i,n,u,b combo reboots the computer.\n\nA: My best guess is that the crash is probably graphics related, so you should try to run with another driver (the open-source driver - even though it is slower) to confirm this theory.\n\nA: In CCC (administrative):\n-AntiAliansing set to override application setting, 2x\n-Adaptive AntiAliansing set to override application setting, performance\n-Antisotropic Filtering set to override application setting, 2x\n-Mipmap Detail Level set to High Performance\n-Vertical Refresh set to 'Always On'\n-Catalyst AI enabled, standard\n-Tearfree enabled\nIn Wine:\n(1.3.36)\n-Windows 7\n-On graphics tab evertthing is checked, 800x600 virtual desktop, vertex shader: hardware, pixel shader enabled\n-On audio tab all the devices are set manually\nPlaying with Skype and Pidgin on, and hasn't had crashes for 2 days of quite active playing the same game.\nGraphics driver is still the latest, catalyst 11.12.\nUbuntu 11.10, 64-bit, with the latest updates (+ oneric-proposed).\nI guess something changed in CCC helped, you can mark this question as resolved.\n", "Q: Flash player performance issues I have serious performance issues with flash on ubuntu 11.10. the problem manifests itself when I try to play large flash files on hosting sites like gorillavids.com and the like. the playback starts normal, and then after 10 minutes or so the frame rate keeps getting lower and lower, until it's like 2 fps. the whole file gets loaded and audio is fine. this happens on my main rig (i5, 8 gb, radeon hd5450) and on my laptop (i3, 4 gb, intel hd graphics). after booting to windows, the files play fine.

And every-time I have Ubuntu.\n\nA: Not sure if what you are asking is possible to do the way you want without anybody to put hands on the remote pc.\nThe only way I can think for now is to install a VM (virtualbox for example) and install ubuntu on it, this way you will be able to control the Ubuntu machine after install (and reboot to configure it). You may even prepare a virtual HD file locally and transfer it to the remote machine so you don't need to install ubuntu remotely.\n", "Q: Deleted home directory. Please help Firstly just want to say that my issue I have is a result of being pretty stupid when it comes to computers and I'm sorry to take up people's time but if anyone could help I would very much appreciate it. My laptop runs Nautilus - Though I was left this computer by someone so I don't really know how to work it. \nAnyway, what I wanted to do is change the user name in the log in settings. I thought it was just be pretty simple and straight forward but it wasn't and then what I have actually ended up doing is deleting the home directory that had the old name so now when I start up the computer it no longer starts up properly and I can't log in properly to even try and fix it. \nI made a new home folder in the new name and transferred the contents there and then it said 'do you want to delete the old folder - it is ok to do so if you have made a copy in the new folder' or something like that. So I did. (I thought this would just change the name - that's all I wanted to do) Then everything was gone in the original home directory/folder (for instance when I clicked on any files or pictures on the desktop anywhere it said 'not found') and I got really worried all my stuff was gone but then I found a new folder in the new name that I had created somewhere and that had all my stuff in so I know it is still there. I thought then at least I still have my stuff.\nAnyway, this was until I turned the laptop off. Now when I try and turn it on I get the following error pop ups in this order:\nCould not update. ICEauthorityfile/home/username.ICEauthority\n\n/usr/lib/libgconf2-4/gconf-sanity-check-2 was exited with status 256\n\nThen it says these folders don't exist /home/username/desktop,/home/username/.nautilus You need to create the folders or set permissions or something.\nThen it is just a blank background and I can't do anything at all. I can only log out, lock the session, shut down, restart etc. But there is just nothing else there.\nBasically, I know this is probably a really stupid problem but I honestly don't know how to work this system so if anyone can help I would be so grateful. I just need to know how I can get back into the computer to get my stuff. I presume I need to recreate the deleted home folder with the old name. Or maybe create the the new folders with the new name?\nI honestly don't know. This all probably didn't make any sense. Anyway if anyone can help please let me know.\nThank you so much!\n\nA: The home directory must be recreated, and with the right permissions. This requires that you boot your computer into recovery mode (aka safe mode) when the starts press and hold the left Shift key and select Ubuntu, blah (recovery mode) from the list.\nOnce you're into the recovery mode in the system you'll see a menu, select \"Root - Drop into a root shell prompt\". you'll need to use some commands typed in to recover the system so write them down:\nmkdir /home/username\nchown username:username /home/username\n\nReplace username with the username you need. To confirm that this is the directory you need and that it will work do:\ncd ~username\n\nAnd that's it, type reboot to get out and reboot the computer. Once you're back in your computer's user's desktop, you can go looking for your files; hopefully they've not been deleted as your description makes it sound like they've just been moved somewhere else. Find them and move them back using Nautilus, or if you don't have permission to move the files then use gksu nautilus to give yourself god like powers (be careful!)\n\nA: This answer is to help you recover the accidentally deleted files. \nI hope you have a ext3 or ext4 filesystem. First thing you might want to do is shut the computer and boot with liveUSB or liveCD and backup the whole filesystem onto another disk. \nNow, use ext3grep and and use the --restore-files switch and restore files one by one. \nHere is a extensive guide to use ext3grep to recover the deleted files.[1]\n\n\n*\n\n*http://carlo17.home.xs4all.nl/howto/undelete_ext3.html\n\nA: Whats was your File system ? If journal-based recovery tools like ext3grep,extundel doesn't help then recovery can be done via tools like testdisk,foremost,extcarve etc which uses carving concept for recovery.\n", "Q: Certified Nvidia driver (from website) downloaded/installed and still doesnt support any graphics I just installed the correct driver for my GeForce 6600 gt which is called x86. \nI had to run it through a ctrl-alt-f1 and stop x server. all went well, so i reboot and it looks like the driver is working (i had no drivers turned on when i ran this one), so all the open gl cairo dock was working well as usual and more. i downloaded hedgewars (worms) and flightgear, super choppy.

To recover from your mistake, uninstall the driver from nvidia.com first by opening a console and running:\nsudo nvidia-installer --uninstall\n\nThen reboot. If you still do not have your graphics effects back, open a console and run:\nsudo apt-get --reinstall install libgl1-mesa-glx\n\nTo install the nvidia driver on Ubuntu, open the Additional Drivers program and choose the current driver.\n\nA: Have you installed it using the program Additional driver, available under System Settings?\nThis is the official program to use to install proprietary drivers in Ubuntu.

This sometimes happens if the filesystem was not unmounted cleanly.\nTo check this, open a terminal and type:\nmount\n\nLook for the NTFS partitions and see if they are mounted \"ro\" or \"rw\".  \"ro\" indicates that they are read-only.\nYou can try remounting them rw:\nsudo mount -o remount,rw [filesystem]\n\nwhere \"[filesystem]\" is the NTFS filesystem in question.\nIt's likely that they will still not remount as read/write if they were improperly unmounted and are unchecked.

It works flawlessly under Windows 7, but under Ubuntu 11.10 it keeps misbehaving.\nWhat happens is this:\n\n\n*\n\n*I connect the mouse to a USB port. The mouse works as expected for a while.\n\n*The mouse starts misbehaving: I can still move the pointer around, but it doesn't react to clicking any buttons (at least not right, left, middle, browser forward or browser back...). Furthermore, my trackpad starts behaving the same way - moving works, but no clicking.\n\n*I disconnect the mouse. Trackpad starts working again.\n\n*I re-connect the mouse. It works for a while, before collapsing (just as the first time I connected it).\n\n\nI haven't manually changed any settings anywhere, and I've noticed that even when the mouse misbehaves, it shows up in cat /proc/bus/input/devices with the following information:\nI: Bus=0003 Vendor=06a3 Product=0ccc Version=0111  \nN: Name=\"Saitek Cyborg R.A.T 3 Mouse\"  \nP: Phys=usb-0000:00:1d.0-1.4/input0  \nS: Sysfs=/devices/pci0000:00/00:1d.0/usb2/2-1.4/2-1.4:1.0/input/input18  \nU: Uniq=  \nH: Handlers=mouse0 event4  \nB: PROP=0  \nB: EV=17  \nB: KEY=3ff0000 0 0 0 0  \nB: REL=103  \nB: MSC=10  \n\nI've googled around a bit and found this forum post, but I find it quite messy and it is unclear whether there is actually any solution to my problem in it. Also, I feel uncomfortable editing Xconf without knowing what I'm doing - and I'm quite new on Ubuntu, so I don't know what I'm doing... Finally, the product web site doesn't appear to have any drivers for Ubuntu and I've found no updates available through the standard sources.\n\nA: The reason (as I understand) that this particular mouse misbehaves on Linux is because of the mode button. In terms of key presses, each mode corresponds to a different button being held down. For my mouse (R.A.T.7) the mode buttons are 13, 14, and 15 for red, blue, and purple respectively.\nI don't know if yours are going to be the same, but there's a nice and easy way to figure it out. Open a terminal and type:\nxinput list | grep \"id\"\n\nFind the entry that has the corresponding label (for me it's \"Saitek Cyborg R.A.T.7 Mouse\") and note the ID to the right. Then, type:\nxinput query-state ID\n\n(Where ID corresponds to the ID of your mouse)\nNote which mode color is currently active, switch it to the next one, and retype the above command. Do that one more time.\nNow that you know which buttons correspond to the modes, you should be able to edit your xorg.conf file appropriately. Type:\ngksu gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf\n\n(Obviously you can use a different text editor if you feel more comfortable with one. If you use a command-line text editor, use sudo instead of gksu.)\nYou'll want to insert a block that's similar to this:\nSection \"InputClass\"\n    Identifier      \"Mouse Remap\"\n    MatchProduct    \"Saitek Cyborg R.A.T.7 Mouse\"\n    MatchDevicePath \"/dev/input/event*\"\n    Option      \"ButtonMapping\" \"1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 0 0 0\"\nEndSection\n\nThe important thing is the \"ButtonMapping\" part. Just go through the list of buttons sequentially until you get to the buttons that correspond to the modes and enter 0s instead.\nYou'll have to restart your X server for the changes to work, but this should fix it up!\n\nA: Add this to your xorg.conf:\nSection \"InputClass\"\nIdentifier \"Mouse Remap\"\nMatchProduct \"Saitek Cyborg R.A.T.3 Mouse\"\nMatchDevicePath \"/dev/input/event*\"\nOption \"ButtonMapping\" \"1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14\"\nEndSection\n\n\nA: I bought the mouse 30 December 2013 in The Netherlands\nR.A.T.3\nTested on Ubuntu 13.04 && 13.10\nI used the following settings: \n//    Command gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf\n\nSection \"InputClass\"\nIdentifier \"Mouse Remap\"\nMatchProduct \"Madcatz Mad Catz R.A.T.3 Mouse\"\nMatchDevicePath \"/dev/input/event*\"\nOption \"ButtonMapping\" \"1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\"\nEndSection\n\nI'm not sure but I think you need to start with the '0' where \"button[int]=down\"\nSo in my case 10 was down and after the update it was up.\n\"button[int]=down\" is related from: \nxinput query-state 'int'\n\n'int' is the ID of the mouse that can be found with the following command: \nxinput list | grep \"id\"\n\nSometimes Europe demands other hardware configuration thus it'll be best if you check it once.\nWould you be so kind to notify if it works or not works for you?\nIf you use unity, use the following command to restart the x-server:\nsudo restart lightdm\n\nElse if you use Gnome 3\nsudo service gdm3 restart\n\n\nA: for me with RAT 3, I used : \nSection \"InputClass\"\n    Identifier \"Mouse Remap\"\n    MatchProduct \"Madcatz Mad Catz R.A.T.3 Mouse\"\n    MatchDevicePath \"/dev/input/event*\"\n    Option \"ButtonMapping\" \"1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\"\nEndSection\n\n\nA: What is really works in Ubuntu/Mint etc... is:\nFirst type in the command to find out which product you have:\nxinput -list\n\nOnce you find out what mouse you have:\nsudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf\n\nFor me I have the Madcatz Mad Catz R.A.T.3; type in:\nSection \"InputClass\"\nIdentifiers \"Mouse Remap\"\nMatchProduct \"Madcatz Mad Catz R.A.T.3 Mouse\"\nMatchDevicePath \"/dev/input/event*\"\nOption \"ButtonMapping\" \"1 2 3 4 5 0 0 8 9 0 0 0 0 0\"\nEndSection\n\nFor Madcatz Saitek Cyborg R.A.T.3; type in:\nSection \"InputClass\"\nIdentifier \"Mouse Remap\"\nMatchProduct \"Saitek Cyborg R.A.T.3 Mouse\"\nMatchDevicePath \"/dev/input/event*\"\nOption \"ButtonMapping\" \"1 2 3 4 5 0 0 8 9 0 0 0 13 14\"\nEndSection\n\nAfter you typed the lines in and SAVED, make sure to reboot your computer! \nOr if you use ubuntu you can just type: sudo restart lightdm\n\nA: Actually, all of the provided solutions mean that your horizontal wheel might not work. I found the following solution works. Create a file /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-cyborgrat.conf with the following content:\nSection \"InputClass\"\n        Identifier \"Mouse Remap\"\n        MatchProduct \"Saitek Cyborg R.A.T.3 Mouse|Saitek Cyborg R.A.T.5 Mouse|Saitek Cyborg R.A.T.7 Mouse|Saitek Cyborg R.A.T.9 Mouse\"\n        MatchDevicePath \"/dev/input/event*\"\n        Option \"Buttons\" \"17\"\n        Option \"ButtonMapping\" \"1 2 3 4 5 0 0 8 9 7 6 12 0 0 0 16 17\"\n        Option \"AutoReleaseButtons\" \"13 14 15\"\n        Option \"ZAxisMapping\" \"4 5 6 7\"\nEndSection\n\nI use this with a Saitek Cyborg R.A.T.7 Mouse and verified that the following things work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Left and right mouse button (button 1/3)\n\n*Pushing down vertical mouse wheel for middle mouse button (button 2).\n\n*Vertical mouse wheel scrolls vertically (button 4/5).\n\n*Horizontal mouse wheel scrolls horizontally (button 6/7).\n\n*Forward / Backward button (button 8/9).\n\n*Red button (button 12).\n\n*Speed button (button 16/17).\n\n\nThe color switch button does not work with this config.\n", "Q: Can I export all of my modified photos from Shotwell?

All my other computers run (K)Ubuntu, so I thought, why not replace Windows with Ubuntu? I'm wondering, will the normal Ubuntu installer keep my other partition intact if I don't do anything special in the installer? If not, how should I configure it to nuke everything but the partition with personal data?\nThanks in advance.\nP.S. The Wubi installation broke down, by sudo breaking completely. Not much to do there, so I un-installed it. No thanks.\n\nA: During installation from the LiveCD or LiveUSB, the Ubuntu installer will detect your partitions. Instead of C: or D:, you'll see sda1, sda2, sdb, etc., but they are the same as what you see from Windows. Make sure you don't select \"Use full drive\" (or something similar), as Ubuntu will overwrite all of your partitions. Instead, click on Manual and do your partitioning from there. \nJust make sure you know how the size of your C: and D: to be able to differenciate them from the installer, or you'll end up overwriting the wrong one.\nWhatever you do, always back up beforehand.\n\nA: It it easy! Boot your live cd, fire up the installation process and when you reach the step where you should choose a partition and edit the hard drive just remove the windows system partition (i suppose C:) and you will get free space. Use that free space to make a ext3,ext2,ex4 partition for linux / (root), but don't use the whole space (leave 3gb) and create swap space from the remaining 3gb. and thats it.

So what shall I do?\n\nA: You would be better decrypting the drive from a Windows computer and then simply using TrueCrypt to encrypt it in the future.\nIf you do not have access to a Windows computer then you might want to give TrueCrypt a shot if you also know what cypher(s) was use to encrypt the drive.(Ex. AES-256)\n", "Q: How to share notes in Ubuntu one? Is it possible to share notes over Ubuntu One with a public link like in Google Docs? I found a solution here but it does not work anymore. Is there a solution?\n\nA: Currently, sharing notes in Ubuntu One is not possible. The link you posted in your question shows that it is an idea under consideration and may or may not be actually implemented.  \nIf you really have to share your notes, then copy the contents of the notes and save it as a .txt file and share it on Ubuntu One.\n", "Q: How can I dual boot ubuntu alongisde windows 7's GUID GPT partition? I have windows 7 SP1 installed on my machine that uses guid gpt partition instead of the old MBR. When I try dual booting ubuntu with it, Ubuntu doesn't recognize the operating system - basically it sees all of my hdd space as unallocated. \nHow can I dual boot ubuntu with windows 7 keeping the guid gpt partition ? \n\nA: I would install Ubuntu to a gpt partition, as well. That is, in fact, what I do, but I do not run Windows on my PC, so I cannot give you a specific how-to-do-it answer.\nYou can find tons of valuable info at this web site, though:\nhttp://www.rodsbooks.com/gdisk/index.html\nAnother great resource is the Parted Magic LiveCD, which includes the gdisk gpt partitioning program.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: How do I setup a bluehost email account? I have an bluehost's account email and recently I have installed Ubuntu 11.10. Now I want to setup my account in Evolution or Thunderbird but I can't it. I don't know if problem is about the settings or client email can't connect with the server IMAP.\n\nA: You might just either call them, or send a ticket.  But, I did a search for you on their website helpdesk and here is the link that shows all about thunderbird.  \nBlue Host\n", "Q: Why don't my partitions stay mounted after a reboot? I'm using Ubuntu 11.10 in a wubi instalation.\nAs I'm using clementine to listen to music I have in my partitions, each time I power ubuntu up clementine loses the libraries and has to rescan the partition all over again.\nA similar thing happens to Transmission bitTorrent client... each time i shutdown the computer and power it up again it loses the location of the files if they are in one of the partitions....\nIs there a way to fix this problem? Is it normal?\n\nA: Fist of all I must say that I'm a Linux noob that I had the same problem some time ago.\nI think that your problem is related with the fact of Ubuntu don't automaticaly mount partitions other than the one with the system itself. Try to make a search in Google by \"edit fstab\" and take a look on that.\nI solved my problem adding the following lines in fstab file:\n#Windows7 auto-mounted partition\n/dev/sda2   /mnt/Windows7   auto   rw,auto,user,exec,fmask=0000,dmask=0000,uid=1000   0   0\n\n\nA: A little trick.\nClementine will mount the partition when you select a folder on it even set for reboot but there is something wrong with the way it does it.\nWhat I do is first get it mounted thru the disks app, make sure mount at startup and life is good. \n", "Q: Disable detection of certain hardware? I have a computer with two PCI TV cards. One is Compro (Win friendly), another is Leadtek (Linux friendly). Now, i'm trying to optimize my Ubuntu boot process and i would like to disable detection of my Compro card because it's not working on Linux, it won't work and even if it does, i don't care.

I guess that the responsible module is called cx88xx based on the lines from your dmesg. You can verify it by checking the output of lsmod | grep cx88xx.\nBlacklisting a module goes like:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create the file /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-cx88xx.conf (the filename was randomly chosen).\n\n*Insert:\nblacklist cx88xx\n\n\n*Update the initial ramdisk to prevent the module from loading on boot:\nsudo update-initramfs -u\n\n\n*The next reboot should immediately show the changes.\n\n", "Q: Changing groups as nonadmin Recently, I accidently lowered my privledges on Ubuntu. I was trying to add vboxusers group to my account, and quickly googled to fund out I can add groups by sudo usermod -G vboxusers USER\nUnaware this would remove all my groups, I used this command and now I can't use SUDO to change back because I am not an admin.\nI already tried logging in as root. it didn't work\nThis is the only user account on the machine. I need admin privledges. What do I do?\n\nA: During boot press SHIFT to get into the GRUB menu, then select boot into recovery mode, \"Drop to the root shell\" and the just re-add yourself to the admin group with usermod including the -a option to append the groups to the current ones:\nusermod -a -G admin USER\n\nCheck http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/resetpassword for more details for a different case.\n\nA: Important files like the user and group information are backed up. Once you've gained root privileges (by booting into recovery mode for example), compare the current groups file with the backed up one:\ndiff -u /var/backup/group.bak /etc/group\n\nIf the only differences are the mistake, overwrite the contents with:\ntee /etc/group < /var/backup/group.bak\n\nOtherwise, manually add yourself to the groups again with:\nusermod -a -G admin,group1,group2,...

It worked\nI haven't tried it without the plugin.\nIt uses much less CPU than the browser, but when it reaches the end of the track, it just stops. I couldn't get this particular setup to load playlists. If I paste the URL for a playlist, it just plays the first song.\n"]
