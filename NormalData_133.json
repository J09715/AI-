["Q: Flickering on youtube All the videos on youtube are flickering on my Ubuntu.\nSee screenshot: http://imgur.com/51dAk\nThis happens with HTML5 enabled and disabled.\nI am running Ubuntu 12.10 on a Thinkpad X61s.\nThis only happens on Google Chrome.\n\nA: This seems to be a known bug:\nhttp://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=124569\nA workaround that did it for me, was starting chrome with this command line parameter:\n--disable-accelerated-compositing\n\nA: The problem seems to be with the hardware rendering: I noticed this behaviour when I enabled the flag “Override Software Rendering List”, i.e. enabling GPU acceleration on unsupported hardware.\nHave a look at chrome://flags whether it is enabled for you as well. \n(I have an Intel GMA X3100 graphics card in a Thinkpad x61-7673.)\n\nA: I recently started having trouble with Chrome's video (Mar/Apr 2013, Ubuntu 12.10), but only in YouTube. The sound was still ok, and other sites were fine.\nI found similar problems reported on Windows Chrome and loosely followed their instructions to disable the PepperFlash pugin. This has improved things massively. Try:\nabout:plugins\n\n\n\n*\n\n*click +\n\n*click disable by the /opt/google/chrome/PepperFlash/libpepflashplayer.so entry.\n\n\n(Maybe this entry could be improved slightly?)\n(The PC mag article I found the answer in said something about Google monitoring.)\n", "Q: Are these system specifications sufficient for upgrading to Ubuntu 12.10 from Windows 7 Starter? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I find out which version and derivate of Ubuntu is right for my hardware in terms of minimal system requirements? \n\nI was just concerned with Ubuntu 12.10 upgrading from my Acer Aspire one AOD270\nNetbook.\n\n\n*\n\n*320GB HDD\n\n*1GB DDR3 Memory\n\n*1.6Ghz Intel Atom N2600 Processor\n\n\nWith these system specifications, will the system work fine with Ubuntu (and much faster than Windows 7 Starter)?\nI don't want to have a slow computer and I'm hoping this will be enough. Or will I have to go for Ubuntu 10.04?\nI also want to make sure my Laptop won't have any BIOS errors or problems, so I'd like to know if there are any known problems with it. \n\nA: You can keep calm. Window 7 always consume more resources than Linux. If you want to be more secure you can install Kubuntu instead of Ubuntu that make the difference by using KDE that in my opinion consumes less graphic resources than the last interfaces of Ubuntu.\nAlso you have a big variety of Linus distributions, here you have a good list of the light-weight linux distros.\nhttp://www.tuxradar.com/content/whats-best-lightweight-linux-distro\nI hope I helped you.\n\nA: I think that it should work fine but not sure it will be faster than Windows 7 Starter.\nTry a liveUSB with different flavours of Ubuntu before installing. The installed version will run faster than the live version though.\nI would recommend Xubuntu and Lubuntu which are lighter than standard Ubuntu with Gnome/Unity.\n\nA: Ubuntu 12.04 will be fine on an Aspire One. My eMachines EM250 is very similar to your netbook and it worked fine with major no problems at all.\n", "Q: Global menu not showing in Ubuntu 12.10 with Unity I am on Ubuntu 12.10 with Unity shell. I am not quite sure what happened, but today I noticed that the menubar (containing 'File, Edit, etc...') is not appearing on the panel as it used to (i.e. the global application menu), but on the application window under the title bar. The only application that still uses global menu is Chromium. Any ideas what settings may have changed?\nAlso, when I right click on the desktop and select \"Change Desktop Background\", System Settings opens, instead of the \"Appearance\" settings.\nApparently, here is a related question, with no answer: Global menu and HUD suddenly broken\nEDIT: I noticed this behavior on three of my computers after an update (I do not remember exactly which packages were updated). Now when I try to run apt-get upgrade, I get:\nThe following packages have been kept back:\n  gnome-control-center gnome-control-center-data\nI guess something is going on with updates. Any info would be appreciated.\n\nA: Hate answering my own questions, but here it is: https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+question/215352\n\nA: I DO NOT RECOMMENDED THIS BUT IT HAS FIXED MY PROBLEMS\nDo a:\nsudo apt-get install appmenu*\nThen restart your individual applications. Global menu should be back.\n\nA: Starting /usr/lib/unity/unity-panel-service manually helped here\n", "Q: Is there debug.exe equivalent for linux? Is there a Windows debug.exe equivalent where I can write machine code and see what results they have after execution?\n\nA: You can emulate debug.exe from DOSBOX...\n\n\n*\n\n*make a dir in your computer and paste in it debug.exe\n\n*open dosbox and mount your dir with: mount x /home/[user]/[folderCreated]\n\n*change to x:\n\n*run debug.exe\n\nA: Try gdb\nMaybe it will help you.\nYou can 'set write on' after opening an executable with gdb.\nThen you can use 'set *(unsigned char *)(hex_address) = machine_code_of_an_instruction'\nto change the machine code at hex_address.\n\nA: I think, what you're looking for is winegdb. Initially, it should allow you to debug Win32 applications in Linux.\n", "Q: Add dependency from ppa to package I'am building simple dropdown terminal emulator application with PythonGI + GTK+3.0, I am using libkeybinder3.0 and gir1.2-keybinder3.0 packages for global keybinding these packages not available in default repository, they had special ppa. I dont want to say my users here is my ppa install my application and here is another ppa for dependencies, how can i merge these packages with my project.\nCan i upload these 2 packages to my apllication's ppa, because i thought launchpad dont let you mirror packages to your ppa? Or how can i link dependencies with my package so user can install only one ppa?\n\nA: You should try the following:\nAccording to the Launchpad's Help:\n\nLaunchpad satisfies your package's Build-Depends using:\n\n*\n\n*the most recent versions of the packages in the PPA you're uploading to\n\n*all sections of the primary Ubuntu archive -- i.e. main, restricted, >- universe and multiverse\n\n*optionally: other PPAs in Launchpad.\n\nNote: If you're already familiar with uploading to the Ubuntu primary archive, you should note that PPA builds do not have any build dependency restrictions, unlike a build in the primary Ubuntu archive. If you want to build the same package in the primary Ubuntu archive at a later point you may need to revise the package's component and/or pocket.\nDepending on other PPAs\nIf you want Launchpad to satisfy your package dependencies using one or more other PPAs, follow the Edit dependencies link on your PPA or the team's overview page.\n\nHope will be helpful.\n", "Q: How to keep an \"scp session\" open? I massively use scp and ssh for work. I'm a little bored to insert the password everytime. Usually, I scp many files from terminal from a local machine to a remote one, and I was wondering if there is a way to keep open the scp connection. I mean, it would be great if there is something like this:\n$ scp user@server # to estabilsh the connection\nuser@server's password:\n$ scp file1 user@server:/folder # No password asked!\n$ scp close # to close the connection\n\n\nA: While it may be possible to keep the connection open, the best way of doing this is probably to use public key authentication, which avoids the need to repeatedly type a password.\nAssuming both the local and remote machines are running linux:\nuser@local $ cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh user@remote 'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys'\n\nWill add the SSH key of the local machine to the list of pre-approved users of the remote machine, and subsequent ssh or scp commands should not require a password.\nIf you still get asked for a password, you might need to do\nuser@remote $ chmod 400 .ssh/authorized_keys\n\n", "Q: Cannot install Skype due to dependency errors; dpkg doesn't install dependencies I'm trying to install the newest Skype version (4.1) on my Linux. \nI have downloaded the skype-ubuntu-lucid_4.1.0.20-1_i386.deb package from the official Skype site.\nI removed all installed versions including the configuration files.\nNow when I try to install the downloaded package, I get the following errors:\nUnpacking skype:i386 (from skype-debian_4.1.0.20-1_i386.deb) ...\ndpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of skype:i386:\n skype:i386 depends on libqt4-network (>= 4:4.8.0); however:\n  Version of libqt4-network:i386 on system is 4:4.7.4-0ubuntu8.2.\n skype:i386 depends on libqtgui4 (>= 4:4.8.0); however:\n  Version of libqtgui4:i386 on system is 4:4.7.4-0ubuntu8.2.\n skype:i386 depends on libqtwebkit4 (>= 2.1.0~2011week13); however:\ndpkg: error processing skype:i386 (--install):\n dependency problems - leaving unconfigured\nProcessing triggers for desktop-file-utils ...\nProcessing triggers for bamfdaemon ...\nRebuilding /usr/share/applications/bamf.index...\nProcessing triggers for gnome-menus ...\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n skype:i386\n\nNow I thought: I can install the missing dependencies manually, but trying this I got dependency errors again. It seems that dependencies of a package are not downloaded and installed automatically.\nIs there a command option for dpkg so that missing dependencies are installed automatically?\n\nA: Well, as far I as know, dpkg can not resolve dependencies, but because you have Ubuntu Lucid 10.04 installed , you can use \"Gdebi\" *(gui tool and resolve dependencies)*just doble click in the .deb package.\nAnother options is... you can run sudo dpkg -i package.deb (it will not a complete install with error dependencies). \nAfter that you just run sudo apt-get -f install and the apt-get tool will correct the missing dependencies.\nHope this will useful!.\n\nA: If you are using 64-Bit Linux, then this problem is usually due to missing libraries.Go to Ubuntu Software Center and install ia32-libs package, and then reinstall Skype.Hope it will solve your problem.\n", "Q: Java Problem in 12.04 My OS is 12.04 and I am running it on my laptop.

There was a question about using multiple passwords earlier this year, but it didn't receive much attention. I'd like to ask the question again after showing an interesting and new way to use the feature. The three original posts I found to be interestingly combined were:\n\n\n*\n\n*Multiple passwords per user\n\n*http://blog.littleimpact.de/index.php/2009/09/14/automatic-encryption-of-home-directories-using-truecrypt-62-and-pam_exec/\n\n*http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/hidden-volume\nBasically I'd like to login to my account with two passwords and depending on the password I use, I would get a different content in my home directory. In a way I would get a cryptographically hidden account into my system. So the question is, is it possible to allow multiple passwords to log on to Ubuntu/Linux for the same user? \n\nA: *\n\n*Not with native Linux/Ubuntu (ie. by manually editing the password files);\n\n*It is possible using a LDAP server. The userPassword can have more than 1 value. \n\n\nBut there is NO way to distinguish between the 2 passwords after logon. The password is not kept in memory or set to a variable after the initial check so this ...\n\nBasically I'd like to login to my account with two passwords and depending on the password I use, I would get a different content in my home directory. \n\n... is not going to be possible. What you want is pretty impossible anyways. Hiding is never a good method. \n\n\n*\n\n*In general I would advice to use 2 accounts. Than means 2 /home/'s. Those 2 are separated as it is but the one with the extra data should be the admin/sudo and the one that does not need to see this data should be a normal account. \n\n\nBesides that there are some commands that might be handy ...\n\n\n*\n\n*chmod og-rwx {file} will make the files only viewable by that user.\n\n*Or similar: attr -s hidden -V true {file}.\n\n\nHiding though is never a good method. \"obscurity\" is not a valid method for protecting data. \nIf these files are that important I would not store them on the machine and use an external medium like an USB stick. And only attach it when it is \"safe\". \n", "Q: Problem with audio sharing between different programs I've been using Linux for quite some time, but until now I've never run into any problems. I also saw the thread \"Sound, stopping between multiple programs\", but it is referring to a very old version...\nMy problem is that when I run Diablo 3 (using PlayOnLinux) and Skype 4 at the same time, I only get audio from the program that I start first.\nIf I start skype first and then Diablo 3, I have perfekt audio in Skype and sometimes I might hear a faint whisper of the Diablo sounds...\nThis problem started after I changed motherboard to Asus p8z77-v pro with 16GB memory and Intel i7 3770K CPU. With the old motherboard, all this worked just fine.\nThe OS is Ubuntu 12.04.\nI have only installed Wine, PlayOnLinux, Skype 4, and Diablo 3. All of the latest version, as far as I know.\nWhat should I do?\nWhat do you need to know, in order to be able to help?\nThanks\n/Lasse\n\nA: Not a solution, but the problem is likely related to the fact that Wine bypasses the pulseaudio mixer used by most sound applications (including recent versions of skype, AFAIK), and interfaces directly with the lower level ALSA sound driver. It should be possible to make ALSA handle multiple clients, but since everything in Ubuntu is meant to go through pulseaudio first I imagine this is not configured.\n", "Q: how to install gfortran package on ubuntu 12.04 offline pc I have downloaded gfortran package from there site and now looking for installing it on the offline ubuntu 12.04 pc... please don't close this question stating possible duplicate. I am looking for steps to install the package by extracting and installing it. I don't want to use get-offline neither keryx nor to use some other online ubuntu systems. I am very much clear.. I have the downloaded package and I am looking forward for the steps to install the package with out accessing internet. Thanks!  \n\nA: You can install a downloaded deb package using dpkg:\nsudo dpkg -i gfortran_x.y.z_arch.deb\n\nHowever, it will probably tell you that one or more dependencies are unavailable, which you will then need to also download before you can install it (note that gfortran is a dummy package that just provides dependency on the actual compiler package, currently gfortran-4.6, in order to make installing multiple different versions possible).\nYou can see the dependencies of any single package with:\ndpkg -I gfortran_x.y.z_arch.deb | grep Depends\n\ngfortran has a lot of dependencies (gcc and lots of associated libraries). If you don't want to use specialised tools, you'll either spend a long time getting extra files, or try installing gfortran on a similarly configured, internet connected machine and see what has to be downloaded. The tool apt-rdepends might be helpful for listing all the recursive dependencies of a package.\n", "Q: Upgrading to 12.10 on an external hard drive I did some googling on this and didn't find anything specific for my situation.\nI currently have 12.04 installed on an external USB hard drive. It's working great. I want to upgrade it to 12.10. My bandwidth is very limited so I have a friend who will download 12.10 for me and put it on a flash stik. Then I can upgrade without having to do the download myself.\nWhich particular version of the 12.10 download file(s) should I get? Are there alternate 12.10 downloads that have all the packages?\nHow do I set it up so when I upgrade 12.04 I can specify that it look in some local repository for the 12.10 files? Can I just dump the 12.10 files in some local directory? Or do I have do go thru some complex commands to create a local repository?\nI'm pretty new to Linux so a long process of complex terminal commands will probably be a show stopper for me.\nRemember that my 12.04 install resides on an external hard drive. And I have a laptop with multiple USB ports.\nThanks!\nAdvait \n\nA: I think there is no method of Upgrading Ubuntu from Flash/USB drive, you can only upgrade through internet.Else the easiest method is to backup all your data from Ubuntu 12.04 and then do complete reinstall of Ubuntu 12.10 on your external hard drive.\n\nA: You should use the standard ubuntu-desktop.iso.    \nYou can use the downloaded ubuntu.iso to create a bootable installation CD / USB using 'Start Up Disk Creator' or 'Unetbootin'.   \nWhen you boot your computer using that CD / USB, select Install Ubuntu and there should be an option to Upgrade 12.04 to 12.10.   \nIf you have problems or the option does not appear, you could take the laptop & USB HDD to your friends house, or just the USB HDD to your friends computer, boot the USB HDD on that computer, then connect to their internet and update it to 12.10.\n", "Q: My system is broken I guess -- issues with libqt4-test So here's the problem, every time I try to install a package, I receive an error that says:\nReading package lists...

The problem is that i had to login anew to my desktop, so I got new X11 session, I believe. \nI would like to connect to my already running X11 session if it's running. Is it possible to do that? If yes, than what should I do?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: vncviewer allows to specify the display number in the connection string:\n\nIf you run the viewer with no arguments it will prompt you for a VNC\n  server to connect to. Alternatively, specify the VNC server as an\n  argument, e.g.:  vncviewer snoopy:2\nwhere 'snoopy' is the name of the machine, and '2' is the display\n  number of the VNC server on that machine. Either the machine name or\n  display number can be omitted. So for example \":1\" means display\n  number 1 on the same machine, and \"snoopy\" means \"snoopy:0\" i.e.\n  display 0 on machine \"snoopy\". \n\nSource: manpage for vncviewer\nI could not find an explicit option in Remmina to specify display number, however:\n\nBy default, a VNC server will listen for connections from a VNC viewer\n  on TCP port \"5900+N\", where N is the \"Display Number\" (usually just\n  zero). So a VNC server setup for Display-0 will listen on TCP-5900,\n  Display-1 is TCP-5901, etc.\nAdditionally, the VNC server will listen for connections from a\n  web-browser on TCP port \"5800+N\", where N is as above. If you point a\n  web-browser to this port, the VNC server will automatically provide a\n  Java VNC viewer that runs right in your web-browser. This Java Viewer\n  will then exchange data with the VNC Server on the same ports a normal\n  VNC Viewer would use: \"5900+N\".\n\n(source)\nSo I guess you may try to connect to a specific display by specifying port number in connection settings.\n\nA: I install and use vino, and I believe it comes standard with regular Ubuntu (with a menu item called something like Remote Desktop).

Data recovery depends on how much you overwritten the data.\nIn any case, I'm sure Ubuntu have written (overwritten?) small part of the disk so I believe you can recover some.

There, I resized the hfs+ from 464 Gib to 346 Gib (second and third steps would be the creation of swap and ext4). After starting, it went through \"calibrate /dev/sda2\" in no time and skipped checking the filesystem (I had forgotten to install the hfsplus and hfstools package beforehand, that might be the reason).\nNow, it has been stuck on the third step, \"shrink file system\", for 4.5 hours and it doesn't indicate any progress at all (the progress bar moves from left to right and then back again, and there is no time indicator). Is this normal behavior and should I just keep going, or did it run into some error and I just don't get any feedback?\nUnfortunately, I post an image yet due to my reputation.\n\nA: Hang in there. For me it took 14 hours to shrink 170GB to 110GB with 4GB of free space. I thought it might have been stuck too, but I was patient and it paid off.\nIf you use the parted command line tool to do the resizing instead of gparted, I believe it displays the progress.

However, it broke my mouse support, so I did some partition copying and shrinking and a complete reinstall.  \nTL:DR Everything's fixed now, although I still don't know what caused the problem.\n", "Q: menu not showing in apps when maximized 12.10 I have removed the Global App Menu as I prefer to have the minimize, maximize, close buttons on the right side of each app.  I did this with no problem in 12.04.  I did an upgrade to 12.10 and noticed that Chrome, Chromium and Firefox all use the Global Menu.\nI have done the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get autoremove appmenu-gtk appmenu-gtk3 appmenu-qt\n\n*I have disabled the Firefox extension.  I removed the corresponding Firefox package but still only have a global menu.  \n\n*I tried Gconf but apparently that does not work in 12.10.  I then tried Dconf and found this fix on Google:  org > gnome > desktop > wm > preferences, look for \"button_layout\" on the right panel.  Here is the problem, after desktop, I do not have wm.\n\n*I reset Unity and got a message saying something about wm is missing.\n\n*I rebooted and opened Chrome and still no fix.  I then clicked maximize and once Chrome was not maximized anymore, the minimize, maximize, close buttons show up in Chrome.  Same with Firefox!\nAny ideas?  I am truly stumped.  Firefox and Chrome work fine in KDE Plasma and Gnome when maximized.\n\nA: Let't take it step by step:  \n\n\n*\n\n*The reported missing wm is referring to the window manager. Ubuntu 12.10 uses Unity as wm. \n\n*Instead of autoremove you should use:   \nsudo apt-get purge appmenu-gtk appmenu-gtk3 appmenu-qt\nI also recommend you to use the unsettings tool to make more deeper customizations. To install it, type:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:diesch/testing\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install unsettings\n\nAfter that you can run it with unsettings.\nNOTE \nIn your case reinstall the uninstalled packages first with:  \nsudo apt-get install appmenu-gtk appmenu-gtk3 appmenu-qt\n\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcuts are not working when unity plugin in ccsm is disabled?

This will give you a host of new compiz plugins. For alt-tab window switching see Application Switcher, Ring Switcher, Shift Switcher or Static Application Switcher. They all provide the same basic functionality in slightly different forms. Look around and you'll find plugins for other keyboard shortcuts you may be used to.\nI believe unity bundles that functionality so Ubuntu doesn't install these plugins by default.\nI'm not sure about #2. I'll see if I can dig anything up ... That will be a bit trickier though since it sounds like Ubuntu's merging of the title bar with the top is happening but Unity isn't around to handle it.\n", "Q: Wired connection doesn't work in Quantal - Toshiba c850 It has Realtek Wireless RTL8723AE card and Atheros AR8162 Fast Ethernet [1969:1090]\nI was able to get the wireless working from Wireless card Realtek RTL8723AE-BT is not recognized\nbut cannot get the wired connection to work\nHow can I solve this?

GParted reports the following partition setup on my HDD. I am, of course, able to modify it if necessary.\n/dev/sda1 (NTFS) 66.92 out of 200.00 MB used\n\nI'm honestly not sure what this partition is for. Maybe for Windows 7 system files? I'm hesitant to mess with it. (edit; it turns out it is a partition for Windows recovery files in the event of OS corruption, so I don't want to remove it. Plus it also appears to be a major pain to remove anyways)\n/dev/sda2 (NTFS) 116.35 out of 339.06 GB used (boot)\n\nThis partition is the C:/ drive on my Windows installation. I don't use it on my Ubuntu installation, except it is the boot partition and thus has grub on it.\n/dev/sda4 (extended)\n> /dev/sda5 (ext4) 14.49 out of 91.34 GB used\n> /dev/sda6 (linux-swap) 5.92 GB \n\nThese are my Ubuntu partitions. /sda5 contains my documents and all of the files I use on Ubuntu, and (as far as I know) the system files for Ubuntu itself (it's the partition I created when prompted by the Live-DVD installer). /sda6 is, of course, the swap partition which I only need for hibernation (6GB of RAM).\n/dev/sda3 (NTFS) 9.89 out of 14.75 GB used\n\nThis is an annoying partition that Lenovo created to store some drivers and files that I might need later on. For example, it allows me to use OneKeyRecovery for a quick factory recovery if absolutely necessary, not sure if that'll work on an SSD. It also contains not-so-important files for bloatware installation.\nIn total, my HDD only has about 150GB of files on it so it should fit comfortably on the SSD. The problem is, I want to exactly migrate my files, partitions, OSes, MBR, etc. from my HDD to my SSD and I'm not quite sure how to do this. I've seen CloneZilla referenced before, but I'm not all too experienced and the documentation for it quite frankly seems a bit like a foreign language to me.\nSo, put simply, is there any way I can exactly clone this HDD to an SSD without a massive headache? Also, if it matters, I'll probably be using an external hard drive case (as recommended in online tutorials) to externally attach the SSD to my laptop during the cloning process due to the lack of two hard drive slots in the machine.\n\nA: Since you are moving from a large HD to a smaller SSD, you will need to copy partitions rather than \"clone\" the original hard drive.\nRegarding the use of Clonezilla and \"the documentation for it quite frankly seems a bit like a foreign language\", have you seen the following two references?  Both indicate how to resize the HD partitions, and copy the reduced-size partitions to the smaller SSD.\nHow to Clone Hard Drive to Smaller Drive\nhttp://geekyprojects.com/storage/how-to-clone-hard-drive-to-smaller-drive/\nReplacing A Disk With A Smaller One Using Clonezilla Live\nhttp://preview.tinyurl.com/cnjm6yg\nFor me, the \"foreign language\" came in the form of Clonezilla's interface.  I have never seen so many error/warning messages and had to fight my way through multiple text-based menu screens.  However, the good news is that, once you have prevailed with the setup procedures, Clonezilla actually works flawlessly.\nFinally, be prepared to use a Windows Recovery Disk to reset the MBR (since Windows seems to object to partitions being moved around) and perhaps also Rescatux (http://www.supergrubdisk.org/rescatux/) to re-establish the GRUB menu after Windows \"thinks\" it is back in control. \n\nA: You should use Clonezilla Live. It's sort of like the Linux equivalent of Norton Ghost. Just boot off the CD and make an image of the entire disk onto an external hard drive.  It does not matter what O/S you are trying to backup or restore. It will take a \"snapshot\" of the entire disk and lay it back down onto the new disk. It is very useful for whole-disk recoveries when disks sizes may have changed.\n\nA: Clonezilla allows you to fit the drive data to a smaller drive if there is enough space.\nRead the following Question and Answer taken from the \"FAQ/Q&A for DRBL and Clonezilla\" web page:\n\nIs that possible I can restore to smaller HDD when the image was taken from bigger one? Or to clone a larger disk to a smaller one?\nThis is always a challenge to Clonezilla because it's block-based tool, not file-based one.\nTwo possible solutions:\n\n*\n\n*Method 1: If you are sure the used data blocks on the source disk are within the disk boundary of destination one, yes, it's possible to make that with the options \"-k1\" and \"-icds\" enabled in the expert mode.\n\n*Method 2: Use Clonezilla live >= 2.6.7-28 or 20200703-focal. For older version it does not always work.\n\n\n*\n\n*First use GParted live to resize and move the partitions in the source disk, and make all partitions to be equal to or smaller than the size of that in the destination disk. You have to make sure the boundary of last partition in the source disk is within the limit of destination disk.\n\n*Then boot Clonezilla live.\nFor disk to disk, follow this.\nFor image to disk, follow this.\nThe only difference is, just remember to choose expert mode, and enable \"-icds\" (while do not choose any option about \"-k*\").\n\n\nYou might have to re-install GRUB2 once the cloning process is finished.\n\nA: *\n\n*Make separate images of your partitions to an external usb disk using Clonezilla.\n\n*Format your SSD disk and create at least one partition (ntfs).\n\n*Copy the image of your windows partition on the SSD disk. Restart the computer.\n\n*Install fresh ubuntu beside windows. Restart the computer.\n\n*Copy the image of your ubuntu partition on the new ubuntu partition (overwrite it).\n\n*Now you can resize or create new partitions with Gparted. \n\n\nA: Recently I faced the same problem. I managed to solve the problem using below method. \nWarning: please create a backup if you aren't aware of what you are doing. Since, we are manipulating grub. If there is some error grub, you won't be able to boot into the system.\nSince, our main focus is to shift Windows + linux from one disk to other.\nSo, firstly make a clone of all the necessary partition on SSD.\nDevice             Start       End   Sectors   Size Type\n/dev/nvme0n1p1      2048   1023999   1021952   499M Windows recovery environment\n/dev/nvme0n1p2   1024000   1228799    204800   100M EFI System\n/dev/nvme0n1p3   1261568 312763164 311501597 148.5G Microsoft basic data\n/dev/nvme0n1p4 312764416 314572799   1808384   883M Windows recovery environment\n/dev/nvme0n1p5 314574848 666136575 351561728 167.6G Linux filesystem\n\nThis is my SSD partitions. Window + linux partition.\nSo try to clone all the partition except the other unnecessary partition like D:// or E:// or other. \nNOTE: for Cloning you can use Macrinum software. Free version will work for this case.\nNow, we have ssd with all the necessary partition(Window + linux + other).\nSo, we just need to add entries in grub for new OS in other drives.\nBoot to linux and try updating grub using command update-grub in terminal. And, try to reboot the system. Usually this fix the problem.\nBut, there exist a problem. In my case, when I was trying to enter the SSD partition from the Grub entry during boot. I was facing a problem that it was booting with HDD instead of SSD. The main reason behind this UUID.\nSince, we are cloning HDD so the new SSD partition have same UUID. It creates a problem as grub confuses which partition to use as two partition have same UUID.\nSo, we will change the UUID of linux partition in SSD using tune2fs.[https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/12858/how-to-change-filesystem-uuid-2-same-uuid][1]\nNow, we have unique identification of partition.\nAgain, try to upgrade grub using update-grub.\nYou can use grub-customizer tool in linux for manual modifying the entries of grub.\nThis solved my problems.\n", "Q: How to get a version of LibreOffice without Unity integration?

In what application?\n\nA: I will try to explain it...\nthe command sh -c 'firefox \"https://www.google.com/search?q=$(xclip -o)\"' will open firefox in www.google.com searching the words you have selected with your mouse.\nTo use it , you should install \"xclip\" \n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the terminal and type sudo apt-get install xclip\n\n*Then you can create a script with the command, create a \"new document\" and named as \"search-google.sh\"\n\n*Open the file with gedit and put these lines:\n\n\n*Save the file in your home eg: /home/user/search-google.sh\n\n*Then change the permissions to make the script executable in the terminal type: chmod 764 /home/user/search-google.sh\n\n*Then you can create a custom keyboard shortcut to execute the script.\n\n*Go to System Settings > Keyboard > shortcuts > Custom Shorcuts\n\n\n*Add a new item and fill the fields Name:search-google and Command:sh/home/user/google-search.sh\n\n\n*Then give a keyboard shorcut to the script...click in \"Disabled\" and press the keys to the shortcut. eg: Ctrl+Alt+G\n\n\n*So, if you are in a web page or any document and you select or (text highlighted) a word or phrase... then press the keys for the shortcut eg: Ctrl+Alt+G and Firefox will open searching in google for the text you have highlighted o selected.\nOn the other hand I think the user55822 tried to say was the Arthaapplication works like this command.. the difference is by default if you have a text selected with Ctrl+Alt+W Artha will serch for that text but \"offline\" (As far as I know.)\nBut you can use both, if you need to search in Artha select the text and press the shorcut keys Ctrl+Alt+W, but if you want to look in google \"online\" you can use the script with the shorcut Ctrl+Alt+G.\nAll the credit for the command is for user55822\nHope will be useful.\nEdit: The above instructions on setting the shortcut are for Ubuntu (proper).\nTo set the shortcut for that script (or for any script like that) in Xubuntu, see the answers to this question. To set the shortcut in Lubuntu (which does not have a GUI for that purpose):\nPaste in Terminal:\nsudo gedit ~/.config/openbox/lubuntu-rc.xml \n\nThere are a lot of groups of lines that set the keybinds and look like so:\n<keybind key=\"C-A-t\">\n      <action name=\"Execute\">\n        <command>x-terminal-emulator</command>\n      </action>\n    </keybind>\n\nTo add a keybind for the google search script, insert this at the end of one of those groups:\n<keybind key=\"C-A-g\">\n      <action name=\"Execute\">\n        <command>sh ~/search-google.sh</command>\n      </action>\n    </keybind>   \n\n\nA: To have a short and clear answer based on the main one:\n\nsudo apt-get install xclip\n\nAdd the following commands (worked directly for me, no script needed), for Google search:\nsh -c 'firefox \"https://www.google.com/search?q=$(xclip -o)\"'\n\nFor Google translate (example for French to English):\nsh -c 'firefox \"http://translate.google.com/#fr/en/$(xclip -o)\"'\n\nreplacing the language and browser if needed.\nFor Google Translate to English from any (auto-detected) language:\nsh -c 'firefox \"http://translate.google.com/#auto&tl/en/$(xclip -o)\"'\n\n", "Q: I can send email but, I can't receive mail I can send email, but I can't receive email.

I want to convert this sweet little network storage server device (HP Windows Media Server) into an Ubuntu storage server.\nMy questions are as follows:\n1) The guide mentions the SiS191 network card on this board is not supported by the Ubuntu 10.04 SiS191 drivers. Is this still the case with more recent Ubuntu builds? Since an older chipset, I'm guessing probably still not supported. Not sure how to research this to get an answer myself (still too new to Linux).\n2) The chassi of this box supports 5 hard disk drive bays. I'm going to attempt this as headless install (as guide suggests using another PC machine to boot, format and install ubuntu, then move drives into device and try remoting in).  To add additional hard drives into the chassis, will Ubuntu server auto-detect these on bootup after I add the hard disks physically into the bays? I wasn't planning to set any advanced raid up. I'll research the onboard raid controller, the Windows Media Server software did auto-recognize all hard drives and by default just showed a virtualized storage space - but I don't believe it was doing any raid fault tolerance on the drive and the storage was just a virtual pool managed by the software. It was long ago I set it up and I think at one point there was a config option in the software, but I didn't do any mirroring or striping.\nI'm sure as I go though this I'm likely to have more questions - part of this exercise is to go through a full server build to get more experience with Linux management. Thanks in advance, apologies if these are overly 'noob' questions -\nc\n\nA: The answer to your first question is probably I found the man page for the sis drivers for Ubuntu 12.04 precise at Ubuntu Manpages.\nI also know that there a a couple different options for setting up a RAID configuration and one of the newer \nSnapRaid\n", "Q: Where's syslinux.cfg in Lubuntu 12.04?

I do it with programs all the time, but i don't know how to find out after I install a program what command to run, what file path the everything is in or any thing like that. The program i am trying to figure out how to open from terminal right now is NetBeans IDE 7.2.1 , but i don't just want to understand how to open it, i want to understand how to find out where to go after i install it, whether i have installed it with apt-get or if i used dpkg?\n\nA: On ubuntu you can use the handy bash-completion featuere to programmaticly list what commands are available to you as a user (provided you know what letters the command start with, in your case netbean it would be netb)\nSo open a terminal and then type the first couple letters of the application like so: netb\nThen hit the tab key for a list of commands available to you\nyou should see the executable for neatbeans in there.\n\nA: Graphical programs such as NetBeans can be opened by searching in the Dash, regardless of how they were installed. If you have installed a command line program, you can usually run it by just typing the program's name into the terminal. For example, after installing the text editor vim, you can run it by simply typing vim into a terminal and pressing Enter.\nUsually, you will not need to know the path a program is installed to. However, you can see it by typing which <command name> into a terminal. For example, to find out where apt-get is installed to, run the command which apt-get.\n\nA: One way you can check this is to read through the list of files installed by the package and look for executables.  Assuming the package is called netbeans, you can run this in the terminal:\ndpkg -L netbeans | grep bin\n\nOne of the lines in the output should be:\n/usr/bin/netbeans\n\nSince /usr/bin should be in your $PATH, that means you can run it by typing netbeans in a terminal.  \nOther uses for the dpkg -L flag are finding where the logs or configuration files are kept.  This will work whether you installed using apt-get, dpkg, or the software-center. \n\nA: Most programs/command can be accessed from anywhere; you don't need to figure out the path.\nIn case you still need or want to know the path, use which as stated in the answer above.\nAs for the name, try netbeans and see if that works.\nAs for the available command-line options (assuming the above command works) try netbeans --help\n\nA: Install your program and then before you use a search tool like locate, you must run\nsudo updatedb\n\nto refresh the database or you will not find your just installed program with locate.\nNow you will usually be able to use the name of the program you just installed (e.g.  shutter) and run locate shutter, for example, to find all the installed shutter files. To specifically find all the executables related to shutter in bin, run\nlocate shutter | grep bin\n\nAlternatively, to quickly find the locations of the main shutter executable, run which shutter and for a listing of filesystem locations, run whereis shutter.\n", "Q: Can I customize the colors in my R terminal environment? I'm running R version 2.13.1 and wondering if there is a way to get more interesting colors in the R terminal, either in bash or tk-R\n\nA: You can use RStudio for writing/editing R scripts. In my opinion R Studio is the best GUI/IDE available for R development. In RStudio under tools -> Options -> Appearance you can change the color of your R console and also change the fonts.\n\nA: In general you may have problem to have a syntax highlighter in terminal. If you already using R commander you may consider RKWard as a GUI for your R programming. It is configurable and very effective. You can use is the same way as R in terminal or R commander. In Ubuntu you can install it through the software center.\n", "Q: Dual stack Apache I have an Ubuntu 12.04 server with a number of IPv4 addresses and a /64 of IPv6 addresses. I have it responding to its IPv6 addresses with ping6. I'd like the domains hosted on the server to go dual-stack, so IPv6-enabled visitors will be able to access its sites over IPv6, and everyone else will use IPv4.\nHere's the relevant parts of my Apache config as it stands now:\nports.conf:\nNameVirtualHost 199.192.201.82:80\nListen 199.192.201.82:80\nListen [2607:ff50:0:21::2]:80\n\nhttpd.conf:\n<VirtualHost 199.192.201.82:80>\n    ServerName  cdc.nexussl.net\n\n    DirectoryIndex index.php\n    DocumentRoot /var/www\n\n    LogLevel warn\n    ErrorLog  /var/www/error.log\n    CustomLog /var/www/access.log combined\n</VirtualHost>\n\n<VirtualHost 199.192.201.82:80>\n    ServerName  ipv6.nexussl.net\n\n    DirectoryIndex index.php\n    DocumentRoot /var/www\n\n    LogLevel warn\n    ErrorLog  /var/www/error.log\n    CustomLog /var/www/access.log combined\n</VirtualHost>\n\n<VirtualHost 199.192.201.82:80>\n    ServerName  dual.nexussl.net\n\n    DirectoryIndex index.php\n    DocumentRoot /var/www\n\n    LogLevel warn\n    ErrorLog  /var/www/error.log\n    CustomLog /var/www/access.log combined\n</VirtualHost>\n\ncdc.nexussl.net has an A record pointing to 199.192.201.82, ipv6.nexussl.net has a AAAA record pointing to 2607:ff50:0:21::2, and dual.nexussl.net has both an A and a AAAA record.\nWith that setup, IPv4 works fine (They should all display a \"You look lost\" page), but visiting ipv6.nexussl.net or dual.nexussl.net from an IPv6-capable machine returns\nNot Found\nThe requested URL / was not found on this server.\nApache/2.2.22 (Ubuntu) Server at ipv6.nexussl.net Port 80\n\ndual.nexussl.net works correctly on an IPv4-only connection. Ultimately, I'd like all sites to be set up in DNS like dual.nexussl.net, with both A and AAAA records.\nIn Apache's config, I can't just use Listen 80, because other applications on that server use port 80 on other IPs. Apache should only use 199.192.201.82 as far as IPv4 goes.\nAs far as IPv6, should I give each site its own IPv6 address, and they'll just share one IPv4? I feel like that could get messy listing an IPv6 address in ports.conf for every site. Even if I'm having them all share an IPv6 address, how do I get Apache to serve sites correctly over IPv6?\n\nA: First, your AAAA records have to point to your IPv6 address, not to 199.192.201.82 (which is technically impossible, so I wouldn't be surprised that that's a typo).\nHere is a correct config:\nports.conf:\nListen 199.192.201.82:80\nNameVirtualHost 199.192.201.82:80\n\nListen [2607:ff50:0:21::2]:80\nNameVirtualHost [2607:ff50:0:21::2]:80\n\nhttpd.conf:\n<VirtualHost 199.192.201.82:80>\n    ServerName  cdc.nexussl.net\n\n    DirectoryIndex index.php\n    DocumentRoot /var/www\n\n    LogLevel warn\n    ErrorLog  /var/www/error.log\n    CustomLog /var/www/access.log combined\n</VirtualHost>\n\n<VirtualHost [2607:ff50:0:21::2]:80>\n    ServerName  ipv6.nexussl.net\n\n    DirectoryIndex index.php\n    DocumentRoot /var/www\n\n    LogLevel warn\n    ErrorLog  /var/www/error.log\n    CustomLog /var/www/access.log combined\n</VirtualHost>\n\n<VirtualHost 199.192.201.82:80 [2607:ff50:0:21::2]:80>\n    ServerName  dual.nexussl.net\n\n    DirectoryIndex index.php\n    DocumentRoot /var/www\n\n    LogLevel warn\n    ErrorLog  /var/www/error.log\n    CustomLog /var/www/access.log combined\n</VirtualHost>\n\n", "Q: Personal Cloud Server \nPossible Duplicate:\nMake my own Dropbox / Ubuntu One server at home \n\nOk, so what I'm wanting to do is turn my old computer into an Ubuntu based cloud server that i can access from outside my home wifi network.

I was just reading »How to revert to GNOME Classic?«. Some answers say that you should press Alt+Win to get the Add to panel dialogue. However my keyboard has no Win. So I was asking myself how to start the Add to panel window. Usually the best way is to enter the program name into a terminal. In this case I can't figure out the name.\nI tested it on another computer and couldn't find the name in the process list. Also xwininfo or similar programs shoed no name. So what is the best way to figure out the name of the program which opened a (X) window.\n\nA: Running xprop _NET_WM_PID from a terminal will put X into a special mode where you can click on a window to get that window's PID in the terminal.\nThen run ls -l /proc/<pid>/exe and look at where the link is to to figure out what the program's file name is.\nThe following is a little python script take from a program I'm working on:\n#! /usr/bin/env python\n\nimport os, subprocess\n\n# Function based on code from apport\ndef get_window_pid():\n    xprop = subprocess.Popen(['xprop', '_NET_WM_PID'],\n            stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)\n    (out, err) = xprop.communicate()\n    if xprop.returncode == 0:\n        try:\n            return int(out.split()[-1])\n        except ValueError:\n            return -1\n    else:\n        return -1\n\ndef get_window_exe():\n    pid = get_window_pid()\n    \n    if pid == -1:\n        return ''\n        \n    return os.path.realpath('/proc/' + str(pid) + '/exe')\n\nif __name__=='__main__':\n    exe = get_window_exe()\n    if exe == '':\n        print 'Unable to identify window\\'s executable' \n    else:\n        print exe\n\nSave this into a file and run by typing python <filename>.py.

I have searched around a bit for this and can't seem to find anything helpful.\nI have my PC running Ubuntu 12.10 set up to suspend after 30 minutes of inactivity. I don't want to change that, it works great most of the time.\nWhat I do want to do is disable the automatic suspend if a particular application is running. How can I do this?\nThe closest thing I've found so far is to add a shell script in /usr/lib/pm-utils/sleep.d which checks if the application is running and returns 1 to indicate that suspend should be prevented. But it looks like the system then gives up on suspending automatically, instead of trying again after another 30 minutes. (As far as I can tell, if I move the mouse, that restarts the timer again.) It's quite likely the application  will finish after a couple of hours, and I'd rather my PC then suspended automatically if I'm not using it at that point. (So I don't want to add a call to pm-suspend when the application finishes.)\nIs this possible?\nEDIT: As I noted in one of the comments below, what I actually wanted was to inhibit suspend when my PC was serving files over NFS; I just wanted to focus on the \"suspend\" part of the question because I already had an idea how to solve the NFS part. Using the 'xdotool' idea given in one of the answers, I have come up with the following script which I run from cron every few minutes. It's not ideal because it stops the screensaver kicking in as well, but it does work. I need to have a look at why 'caffeine' doesn't correctly re-enable suspend later on, then I could probably do better. Anyway, this does seem to work, so I'm including it here in case anyone else is interested.\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# If the output of this function changes between two successive runs of this\n# script, we inhibit auto-suspend.\nfunction check_activity() {\n  /usr/sbin/nfsstat --server --list\n}\n\n# Prevent the automatic suspend from kicking in. \nfunction inhibit_suspend() {\n  # Slightly jiggle the mouse pointer about; we do a small step and\n  # reverse step to try to stop this being annoying to anyone using the\n  # PC.

The first is /usr/lib/pm-utils/sleep.d/000nfs-inhibit, which will prevent a suspend attempt if an inhibit file exists:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nLOG=\"/home/zorn/log/nfs-suspend-blocker.log\"\nINHIBITFILE=\"/home/zorn/tmp/nfs-suspend-blocker.inhibit\"\n\necho \"$0: Started run at $(date), arguments: $*\" >> \"$LOG\"\nif [ \"$1\" = \"suspend\" ] && [ -f \"$INHIBITFILE\" ]; then\n  echo \"$0: Inhibiting suspend\" >> \"$LOG\"\n  exit 1\nfi\nexit 0\n\nThe second is a modified version of the previous nfs-suspend-blocker script and should still be run from cron. It now follows the strategy outlined in the comment below:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# This works in tandem with /usr/lib/pm-utils/sleep.d/000nfs-inhibit, which\n# will prevent a suspend occurring if $INHIBITFILE is present.

I would make a .bash_aliases file to also call caffeine when your original code is called.\nalias newname=\"origcode && caffeine\"\n\nDepending on which code you are trying to keep your computer awake for, you'll have to make a custom script that includes killing caffeine when the other code is stopped. Some more details about the particular code would help.\nUpdate: A simpler way would be to run xdotool, which can be installed with sudo apt-get install xdotool. You can write a script that is called when your target code is opened and then use the sleep command for 29 minutes and then run xdotool key a or something arbitrary to keep the computer awake.\n\nA: If\n\n\n*\n\n*A script in /usr/lib/pm-utils/sleep.d can check if the application is running and return 1 to indicate that suspend should be prevented.\n\n*The problem of \"the system then gives up on suspending automatically, instead of trying again after another 30 minutes\" is solved by moving the mouse which restarts the timer again (I hope I've understood properly what you mean by this)\n\n\nthen why not just jiggle mouse pointer after the application terminates.\nTo summarise:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use sleep.d to keep system from suspending.\n\n*Write a script that jiggles mouse once.\n\n*Call 'Long-running-script && mousejiggle'\n\n\nThis will not hinder the screensaver.\nThe only problem is that it will be 30 minutes after the process terminates when the system suspends. This is the case with your 'EDIT' solution also.\nPS: I was looking for a solution to a similar problem when I learnt of xdotool from this page. So, thanks. Hope this helps.\n\nA: Although EDIT 2 lets the screensaver kick-in and resumes autosuspend service on removal of inhibit file, as noted above it will be 30 minutes after the file is removed when the system will suspend.\nOne possible solution is to disable the inbuilt auto-screensaver and auto-suspend functionality and implement them on our own, and choose the behaviour of the timer as required. The command xprintidle (you may have to install this) prints the number of milliseconds for which there has been no keyboard or mouse activity. This opens up several possibilities. I've implemented the following inactivity manager in python (not too much of a bash scripter). Features include setting the command, timeout and inhibit file(I've called it lock) for screensaver and/or autosuspend. In addition there is option to choose whether inactivity timer should restart when inhibit file is removed or not (behaviour can be different for suspend and screensaver). I've tried to make the usage clear in the notes but if something is unclear do ask.\n#!/usr/bin/python\n\n#Notes:##################\n\n#   1. All TIMEOUTs are specified in seconds\n#   2. 0 or negative TIMEOUT disables a particular action.\n#   3. If an actionCOMMAND (like pm-suspend) requires 'sudo'ing, make them 'sudo'able without password. Alternatively, you may run this script in sudo mode, and make this script sudoable without password. https://askubuntu.com/questions/159007/specific-sudo-commands-without-password\n#   4. 'action'_timer_starts_... option: True - if a lock file is created and then removed, inactivity timer (for that action) restarts at the time of deletion of lock. False - doesn't restart.\n#   5. screensaverCOMMAND can be screen-lock (security) or screen-off (power saving) or both. To do both, but at different times (I can't see any reason to do so) extend this script from two actions (screensaver, autosuspend) to three (screen-lock, screen-off, autosuspend).\n\n#########################\n\nimport os\nimport time\nimport threading\nimport subprocess\n\nHOME = os.getenv('HOME') + '/'\n\n#Configuration###########\n\nscreensaverCOMMAND = \"gnome-screensaver-command --lock && xset -display :0.0 +dpms dpms force off\"\nautosuspendCOMMAND = \"gnome-screensaver-command --lock && sudo pm-suspend\"\n\nscreensaverTIMEOUT = 10*60\nautosuspendTIMEOUT = 20*60\n\nscreensaverLOCK = HOME + \".inactivitymanager/screensaverLOCK\"\nautosuspendLOCK = HOME + \".inactivitymanager/autosuspendLOCK\"\n\nscreensaver_timer_starts_only_after_lockfile_is_deleted = False\nautosuspend_timer_starts_only_after_lockfile_is_deleted = False\n\n#########################\n\ndef stayOn():\n    print \"inactivitymanager is running...\"\n    try:\n        while True:\n            time.sleep(10)\n    except:\n        print \"Closed.\"\n\nclass inactivity_action(threading.Thread):\n    def __init__(self, command, timeout, lock, timer_starts_blah):\n        threading.Thread.__init__(self)\n        self.daemon = True\n        self.command = command\n        self.timeout = timeout\n        self.lock = lock\n        self.timer_starts_blah = timer_starts_blah\n    def run(self):\n        if not(self.timer_starts_blah):\n            while True:\n                try:\n                    while True:\n                        time.sleep(1)\n                        f = open(self.lock, 'r')\n                        f.close()\n                except IOError:\n                    xidletime = int(subprocess.Popen('xprintidle', stdout = subprocess.PIPE).communicate()[0])/1000\n                    if xidletime > self.timeout:\n                        os.system(self.command)\n                    else:\n                        time.sleep(self.timeout - xidletime + 2)\n        else:\n            lockremovetime = 0\n            while True:\n                lockdetected = False\n                try:\n                    while True:\n                        time.sleep(1)\n                        f = open(self.lock, 'r')\n                        f.close()\n                        lockdetected = True\n                except IOError: #Will enter this section if/when lockfile is/becomes absent\n                    xidletime = int(subprocess.Popen('xprintidle', stdout = subprocess.PIPE).communicate()[0])/1000\n                    if lockdetected:\n                        lockremovetime = int(time.time())\n                    timesincelockremove = int(time.time()) - lockremovetime\n                    if min(xidletime, timesincelockremove) > self.timeout:\n                        os.system(self.command)\n\nif screensaverTIMEOUT > 0:\n    inactivity_screensaver = inactivity_action(screensaverCOMMAND, screensaverTIMEOUT, screensaverLOCK, screensaver_timer_starts_only_after_lockfile_is_deleted)\n    inactivity_screensaver.start()\n\nif autosuspendTIMEOUT > 0:\n    inactivity_autosuspend = inactivity_action(autosuspendCOMMAND, autosuspendTIMEOUT, autosuspendLOCK, autosuspend_timer_starts_only_after_lockfile_is_deleted)\n    inactivity_autosuspend.start()\n\nstayOn()\n\nUsage:\n\n\n*\n\n*Just add inactivitymanager & to .profile or .xsessionrc  in home directory (see which one works for you. Don't add in both, else two instances of this script will run simultaneously, something I've not handled. I guess it is in these details that the mainstream implementations trump custom ones).\n\n*You may have to install xprintidle.\n\n\nHow the inhibit file gets there is left to the imagination of the user for now (if I bring myself to implement a daemon for this, I'll put that in an EDIT to this answer). You (OP) of course have solved it for your case. One pitfall to avoid when trying to inhibit suspend for more than one process is deleting the lock file when one process terminates while another is still running. Alternatively, the script can be edited slightly to inhibit suspend if some file exists in a particular directory (a lock directory). This way each process can have its own lock file.\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*This script is pretty light on the processor and memory. But removing the time.sleep(1) s in the code might cause trouble - haven't checked though.\n\n*pm-suspend requires sudo permissions. To pm-suspend without giving password checkout How do I run specific sudo commands without a password?. Alternatively you may run this script in sudo mode, and make this script sudoable without password (Not a problem if you running script as root)\n\n*The script might run into trouble if timeouts are set to be less than ~10 seconds (Haven't check where exactly the trouble starts must be less than 5, I guess). This can be handled by removing some time.sleep(1) s at the expense of system resources. Don't think anybody will need this though.\n\n*Because we have a handle on the timers, no mousejiggles required!\n\n\nA: Systemd supports this through the systemd-inhibit command. Example from this page:\n# systemd-inhibit wodim foobar.iso\n\n\nThis burns the ISO image foobar.iso on a CD using wodim(1), and\ninhibits system sleeping, shutdown and idle while doing so.\n\n\nA: Just extracting out the core trick here for my needs, I wind up with the following: On /usr/local/bin/nosleep I have this script:\n#!/bin/bash\nexport DISPLAY=:0.0\nwhile true; do xdotool mousemove_relative --sync --  1  1 ; xdotool mousemove_relative --sync -- -1 -1; sleep 60; done\n\nThis is very handy!

Thanks.\n\nA: If you are willing to risk your live data, you can edit the partition table online with fdisk. However, as you have more than one partition, you need to first delete your second partition to get it out of the way. Once this is done, you can resize the original partition, reboot, resize the filesystem, reboot again, and then have more space. A quick example would look like this (everything must be done as root, use sudo -i to get a root terminal):\nStep 0: BACK UP ALL YOUR DATA. This is very risky. If you don't know what you're doing you will probably destroy all your data. Continue at your own risk.\nStep 1: unmount your second partition, which appears to be just swap\nswapoff /dev/sda5\n\nStep 2: Modify the partition table, deleting the swap and extended partition\nfdisk /dev/sda\nd\n5\nd\n2\nw\n\nStep 3: Find which block your first partition starts on, this needs to be exact\nfdisk -l /dev/sda\n\nOutput looks like:\nDisk /dev/sda: 21.5 GB, 21474836480 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 2610 cylinders, total 41943040 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x0003301e\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n  /dev/sda1   *        2048    39845887    19921920   83  Linux\n\nStep 4: Delete and recreate your primary partition\nfdisk /dev/sda\nd\n1\nn\np\n1\n2048\n[however large you want the filesystem to be]\nw\n\nStep 5: Recreate your swap partition\nfdisk /dev/sda\nn\np\n2\n[default option, beginning of free space]\n[default option, end of free space]\nt\n2\n82\nw\n\nStep 6: Reboot. Your server might not come back online. You may have ruined everything. This is why you took that backup.\nStep 7: Resize the filesystem. For ext2/3/4, use resize2fs.\nresize2fs /dev/sda1\n\nStep 8: Reboot again.\nAfter the last reboot, you should have all the space you added. You will need to edit your fstab to update the UUID on the swap partition.\n\nA: I don't know about vmware specifically, but the general technique probably is the same as when you get a new, bigger hard disk and transfer your old disk's image to it. What you need to do is \"grow\" the partition and the filesystem to fill up the new, larger physical (or in your case, virtual, but it's still the same from Ubuntu's point of view).\nThe bad news is that in order to resize the filesystem, it cannot be mounted; meaning it cannot resize \"itself\". The good news is that it's easy to do with a Ubuntu desktop ISO. Just set vmware up so that it boots from a recent Ubuntu desktop ISO image. When it prompts you, ask to \"try Ubuntu\". When it boots up, look for \"gparted\", which is a graphical partition manager. You can ask it to enlarge the partition to fit all available device space.\nSee here for a nice tutorial with lots of detail:\nhttp://www.howtogeek.com/114503/how-to-resize-your-ubuntu-partitions/\n", "Q: Set mplayer as default application I just did a fresh install of 12.10 and are now left wondering how to set mplayer as a global default application for video.\nI created a mplayer.desktop and added the same categories as totem has, however still no luck selecting it from the detailed Settings.\nA similar problem is with thunderbird, which Id like to set as default calendar app. However I can only select gedit, for whatever reasons.\nAny help would be very much appreciated!\nThanks\n\nA: go into  system settings -> details -> default applications  and set up your default applications as needed, in this case,  video -> mplayer\n\nA: Find a movie file, right click properties, open with…, set default.\nRepeat for each movie file format.\nTO set it as default, modify your mplayer.desktop like this:\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nName=Mplayer media player\nGenericName=Media player\nComment=Read, capture, broadcast your multimedia streams\nExec=mplayer %U\nTryExec=mplayer\nIcon=mplayer\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nCategories=AudioVideo;Player;\nMimeType=video/dv;video/mpeg;video/x-mpeg;video/msvideo;video/quicktime;video/x-anim;video/x-avi;video/x-ms-asf;video/x-ms-wmv;video/x-msvideo;video/x-nsv;video/x-flc;video/x-fli;application/ogg;application/x-ogg;video/x-ogm+ogg;audio/x-vorbis+ogg;application/x-matroska;audio/x-matroska;video/x-matroska;video/webm;audio/webm;audio/x-mp3;audio/x-mpeg;audio/mpeg;audio/x-wav;audio/x-mpegurl;audio/x-scpls;audio/x-m4a;audio/x-ms-asf;audio/x-ms-asx;audio/x-ms-wax;application/vnd.rn-realmedia;audio/x-real-audio;audio/x-pn-realaudio;application/x-flac;audio/x-flac;application/x-shockwave-flash;misc/ultravox;audio/vnd.rn-realaudio;audio/x-pn-aiff;audio/x-pn-au;audio/x-pn-wav;audio/x-pn-windows-acm;image/vnd.rn-realpix;video/vnd.rn-realvideo;audio/x-pn-realaudio-plugin;application/x-extension-mp4;audio/mp4;video/mp4;video/mp4v-es;x-content/video-vcd;x-content/video-svcd;x-content/video-dvd;x-content/audio-cdda;x-content/audio-player;video/x-flv;application/xspf+xml;\nX-KDE-Protocols=ftp,http,https,mms,rtmp,rtsp,sftp,smb\nLog out and in again.

Both OSs are on the primary SSD while all commonly used data (documents, movies, music, profiles etc) is on a secondary NTFS-formatted HDD. \nSince I needed the NTFS drive to automatically mount in Ubuntu right at startup, I downloaded ntfs-config and set it to automount my NTFS drive. \nProblem is, I also accidentally told it to automount my external hard drive (which is also NTFS formatted). When booting up Ubuntu, it now checks for the presence of that drive every single time, which is getting annoying 'cause I don't always have it connected.\nI've tried un- and reinstalling ntfs-config, telling it to not automount the external HD, but to no avail. \nAny suggestions?\n\nA: the file /etc/fstab contains all the drives/partitions that will be automatically mounted at boot time, so its just matter of removing the corresponding entry (there should be 1 line entries).\nto do that, open the file with \nsudo gedit /etc/fstab\n\nand remove the corresponding line of your external drive, if unsure, paste the content of your file /etc/fstab so we call assist you in which line to delete.\n", "Q: Which Folders To Include In backup? I'm quite new to Ubuntu and want to create a backup. I'm really not sure what files and folders to include so that if I restore my system it will be as it is now. I can't seem to find good details of this anywhere. Hopefully someone could help me with this.

If all you want to keep is your user data, you only need your home directory.\nEdit: If you have anything in /opt you probably should include that too.  Thanks to @GabrielStaples for pointing that out.\n\nA: Most people just backup their home directory: /home/$USER/. If you want to back up the configuration files and settings, those are stored in folders and files in your home directory that start with a . (dot). Make a list of packages that you use (and PPAs) and it will be easy to reinstall all your packages should you need. Or, use the command described in this comment.\nDeja Dup Backup is a great tool that comes as a default on Ubuntu. Other options include command line (rsync, rsnapshot, rdiff-backup, etc). \nFinally, to backup the whole disk as an image, check out clonezilla.\n\nA: I backup what is important to me which can loosely be defined as my intellectual property plus efforts spent configuring Ubuntu to work perfectly (for me).\nI have the backup run every morning at 4:00 am or whenever Laptop resumes from suspend. It is controlled through /etc/cron.daily script.\nThe best kind of backup is off-site in case of fire or flood where computer sits so I take advantage of free 15GB gmail.com account and send a compressed daily backup there.\nAfter a couple of years I hit my 15 GB \"free\" quota so wrote a script to recycle backups into 180 days, 78 weeks, 36 months and 100 yearly backups.\nHere is the daily backup script of what's important to me:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# NAME: daily-backup.sh\n# PATH: /mnt/e/bin\n# DESC: Backup scripts, documents and configuration files to .tar\n\n# DATE: July 11, 2017.

Start by figuring out what does not need to be backed up.  First take a look at your root directory, and then work backwards.\nFor example, cd /; ls -F gives me:\nbin/    initrd.img@      mnt/   snap/  vmlinuz@\nboot/   initrd.img.old@  opt/   srv/   vmlinuz.old@\ncdrom/  lib/             proc/  sys/\ndev/    lib64/           root/  tmp/\netc/    lost+found/      run/   usr/\nhome/   media/           sbin/  var/\n\n/cdrom, /media, and /mnt are mount points so don't need backup.  \n/dev, /lost+found, /proc, /run, /sys and /tmp get auto re-created on reboot.  [I'm guessing the links: /initrd.img@, /initrd.img.old@, /vmlinuz@, /vmlinuz.old@ get re-created on boot ubuntu reinstall (I'm not sure which).]\nOn my system /root is empty (use sudo -s to open a shell as root user to view it ... be careful to exit immediately after you inspect /root.)\n/snap is also empty.  Perhaps it's a mount point.\n/var contains variable data like system logging files, mail and printer spool directories, and transient and temporary files.\" I now back it up, except for /var/log.  ref: http://www.tldp.org/LDP/Linux-Filesystem-Hierarchy/html/var.html)\n/bin, /boot, /lib, /lib64, and /sbin presumably will get reloaded via a reinstall of Ubuntu unless you are doing system development work or something like that.  You can either back these up or rely on a fresh install to recover them.\n/home should be in it's own backup.  There will be times when you will want to restore just /home.  \nThat leaves other changes you've made to your system in /etc, /opt, /srv, and /usr which you will want to also backup, either together or individually.\nHere are a couple of pages that might help understand these directories:\nhttp://www.tldp.org/LDP/Linux-Filesystem-Hierarchy/html/the-root-directory.html\nhttp://www.tldp.org/LDP/intro-linux/html/sect_03_01.html#sect_03_01_03\n\nA related line of thinking is:  Say you just installed a fresh Ubuntu.  What would you need to back up?  Answer: nothing.  You haven't changed anything yet, so you can simply reinstall Ubuntu.  It restores /bin, /etc, /root, /usr, etc.\nSo the only reason you might want to backup /bin is because you have changed it or added to it.  So part of backing up is understanding what is where and when it is created and modified.  Just know that the rest of us struggle with this too.\n\n*****And, although you didn't ask, one can make full disk or partition images. These take a lot of time to backup and restore and may leave your system down while that work is proceeding.  And it's how I used to backup my Windows systems using Acronis. The one thing they provide you with is a partition map, and images from non-linux partitions.  I now make these before I reorganize partitions, and before I test my backup restore functions.\n\n(I'm very open to suggestions as to how I could make this better.)\n\nA: Just a reminder if you're using DejaDup (or anything else really), also exclude any cloud storage folders (likely in your home), such as Dropbox.  If you're paying for s3 storage this could be a bad mistake.\n\nA: In general I backup /home excluding .cache and .local/Trash. \nI also manually cleanup some unneeded files beforehand with baobab and du -h --max-depth=1. \n\nA: Use Deja Dup backup. It is provided by default. Go to settings and keep only root folder (/) as \"folders to include\" and add media folder (/media) in \"folders to ignore\".\nBecause of this, all your programs will be backed up in case of system damage (rare) except your other drives which normally remain unaffected.\n", "Q: Why doesn't Skype theme match my Desktop Environment theme?

I can NOT access the internet via anything but wireless. I am presently on my laptop searching for answers while trying to install this little device.

Not sure what the jface has to do with it really.\nApparently re-starting solves the problem.\nAs for java.lang.NullPointerException\nThat could be absolutely anything to do with your own particular SDK.\nIf it's Android then it is most likely the irritating fact that when you attempt to run/debug a project, the entry which names the project that you are running sets itself to blank every now and then!\nLook in the project run/debug specifications.\n", "Q: How do I remove Amazon app but keep google apps? I'm using Ubuntu 12.10. Whenever I go to an amazon webpage it keeps popping up an 'Amazon app' in my Unity taskbar. I find this relatively useless because I'm already on the Amazon website. \nI uninstalled it but it ended up uninstalling all my google and other apps as well. When I tried reinstalling the gmail app, it also reinstalled the Amazon app! Is there a way to separate Amazon from the other apps?\n\nA: Try reinstalling unity-webapps-gmail \n", "Q: Is there a file explorer/manager for the command line? I would like to know if there is something like DOS interface for Ubuntu. I mean a \"GUI\" that can run from the console (for example if you are using Ubuntu Server). Some file explorer like Nautilus but in console.\n\n\nA: You could take a look at Dired Mode for Emacs. Though it's integrated to Emacs (so you have to learn the whole stuff), it's so much useful and nice to use that it could be nice to try it.\nYou can display a repository in in the console by running it in no-window mode:\nemacs -nw /path/to/your/repository/\n\n\nDired is a visual directory editor, a computer program for editing file system directories. Dired runs on any Emacs platform. Its commands are generally more modal than most Emacs commands because Dired is a specialized major mode on its own. Dired can perform all expected operations; in operation and use it is akin to an orthodox file manager like Midnight Commander.\n\n\n\nA: This thread reminded me that you can open a directory with vim and browse it from there with arrow keys and enter. Which is about all I wanted. :+1:\nvim .\n\n\nA: Well there is midnight commander:\n\nTo install: sudo apt-get install mc\nTo run: mc\nAnd also Last File Manager:\n\nTo install: sudo apt-get install lfm\nTo run: lfm\n\nA: Ranger:\n\nranger is a file manager with VI key bindings. It provides a\n  minimalistic and nice curses interface with a view on the directory\n  hierarchy. The secondary task of ranger is to psychically guess which\n  program you want to use for opening particular files.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*UTF-8 Support\n\n*Multi-column display\n\n*Preview of the selected file/directory\n\n*Common file operations (create/chmod/copy/delete/...)\n\n*VIM-like console and hotkeys\n\n*Automatically determine file types and run them with correct programs\n\n*Change the directory of your shell after exiting ranger\n\n*Tabs, Bookmarks, Mouse support\n\n\n\n\n\nA: Another useful filemanager that can be operated entirely from the keyboard is vifm and it is available in the repositories. You can install it with:\nsudo apt-get install vifm\n\nIt has an ncurses style interface and is ideal for using on servers. It is quite similar to the other dual pane file managers mentioned except that it supports all the vim shortcuts. If you know all the various ways of operating in vim, then this file manager will be ideal and you will not need to learn another slew of shortcuts. \nA vifmrc is created in a ~/.vifm folder when the program is installed, so you can add your own personal configurations and keybindings. However, to fully use all the more recent features such as customising keybindings you will need to compile the latest version from the project site, and make sure you install the minimum build dependencies libmagic-dev and libx11-dev. The version in the repositories is fine and stable, but it is quite an old version (0.4.2) and the current version is 0.7.4.\nJust like in vim, you can press Shift+: to enter the command line inside the file browser and perform many actions, as as noted in the documentation at the Sourceforge site. The creator of the program indeed uses it for his home server, as he shows in his screenshots here, so I think the program would be perfect for you, or anyone already familar with vim.\n\n\nA: I like the netrw script for VI:\nhttp://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1075\n", "Q: How to add shell script to my linux system I have shell script for monitoring local area traffic for my system. Now I want to install it, and want to run like other unix command\n\nA: On Ubuntu, it is possible to create a bin folder in your home folder and place your user scripts in there. Indeed, your ~/.profile will contain the following:\n# set PATH so it includes user's private bin if it exists\nif [ -d \"$HOME/bin\" ] ; then\n    PATH=\"$HOME/bin:$PATH\"\n\nAfter you have created your bin folder you must logout and login again for /home/$USER/bin to appear in your path when you enter echo $PATH. Once it is in your path you will be able to call scripts in there by name and execute them just like you can any other programs.\nThe bin folder does not need any special permissions, and if you just want your user to be able to execute the scripts enter chmod u+x when you make them executable.\nYour new output of echo $PATH when your bin folder is added should be:\n/home/mike/bin:/usr/lib/lightdm/lightdm:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games\n\nYou can place your scripts in /usr/local/bin, but you will need to use sudo to copy them to the folder and then use sudo again when you want to edit them there, so I find having a bin folder in the home folder is very convenient and sensible, particularly on a single user system.\nHowever, it is important to note that if you have more than one user on your system and you want the script to be available for them all, you would definitely need to put it in /usr/local/bin.\n\nA: The usual location to install local scripts is /usr/local/bin or /usr/local/sbin.  See man hier for details of the directory structure.  \nThese directories are usually included if the corresponding /usr/bin or /usr/sbin directories are in the path.  See man eviron for information on the standard environment variables including PATH.\nThe directory hierarchy for many distributions is document in the heir man page.  It can be displayed with the command man heir\n/usr/local/bin is for programs that all users should be able to run.  It is equivalent to /bin and /usr/bin.  Normally, most users will not have these on their path. \n/usr/local/sbin is for programs that are used for system administration.  It is equivalent to /sbin and /usr/sbin.  \n\nA: The way I would solve this (with my fairly rudimentary linux skillz) is to make an alias to the shell script.\nFirst ensure the shell script is executable. \nchmod u+x,g+x script.sh\n\nThen, edit your .bashrc file like following:\ncd\nvi .bashrc\n\nAdd this towards the bottom. (I think you can also add this in a specific alias file, such as .bash_aliases, but I don't.)\nalias commandtorun='/home/user/script.sh'\n\nHere, commandtorun will be the command you type in to run the script, and '/home/user/script.sh' is the path to the script.\nTo save changes to your .bashrc in vi editor, :wq, which writes to file and quits.\nEdit: You'll also need to re-source your .bashrc to use the changes in the current session. (Or just restart the session / close and reopen the terminal).\nsource ~/.bashrc\nGood luck!\n", "Q: How can I extract the deb files from the ubuntu iso? How can I extract the deb files of ubuntu 12.10 from the official iso, I am trying to cut the download time, only some packages are in /pool/main\nThe rest seem to be in a virtual fs in /casper/.\nHow can I extract the deb files?\n\nA: Most of the debs Ubuntu uses are installed into a chroot before generating the ISO image, so you can't just get them back. If you unsquash the filesystem, you'll see it looks like just a root filesystem. For example, this is a truncated view of ls:\ndrwxr-xr-x   2 root root  4096 Oct 12 16:59 bin\ndrwxr-xr-x   3 root root  4096 Oct 12 16:59 boot\ndrwxr-xr-x   4 root root  4096 Oct 12 16:56 dev\ndrwxr-xr-x 134 root root 12288 Oct 12 16:59 etc\ndrwxr-xr-x   2 root root  4096 Oct  9 08:59 home\n\n...\nIf you want to mess with the chroot, you can do so as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mount the ISO\nsudo mount -o loop quantal-desktop-i386.iso tmpiso\n\n\n*Copy the squashfs out\ncp tmpiso/q/casper/filesystem.squashfs /tmp\n\n\n*Unsquash the filesystem\nsudo unsquashfs filesystem.squashfs\n\n\n*This will unpack the filesystem into squashfs-root.\n\n*Make your changes.\n\n*Recompress with squashfs.\n\n*Use ISO master to replace the filesystem.squashfs with the one you modified.\n\n*Rebuild the ISO with ISO master.\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Mount the iso.\n\n*Copy squashfs and unsquash it.\n\n*in the extracted folder i'd execute this from the shell.\nfind -name \"*.deb\" -type f -execdir cp {} ~/Desktop/thefolder_you_choose/ \\;\nThis finds all .deb files and dumps all of them (without the folder structure) in your destination folder.\n", "Q: Why does penguin.local point to an odd IP, when it is meant to be local?

If you have an NVIDA graphics card, this might work for you too.\nBut beware, there appears to be a bug in the NVIDIA driver package (see e.g. here: Desktop does not show when I installed nvidia drivers!). You need to first run:\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic\n\n", "Q: Detect correct resolution dual monitor VGA 9800gt Ubuntu 12.10 I connected a second monitor to my 9800gt on the VGA port.

If you want to connect using the IP you need to make a certificate with the IP as Commom Name.\nIt is possible you changed the hostname of the machine you are connecting to and it can't be trusted anymore using this certificate.\nTo have certificate working, you need to have the remote machine hostname matching the one on the certificate and you need to use this name to connect to it.\n\nA: I also changed to RDP from Negotiate in Advanced/Security and this fixed the Certificate Message I was getting that was keeping me from connecting remotely to a machine running Windows 7. \n", "Q: Can I have some help installing python-captcha? dpkg error 1 I have searched around the forums and tried a number of solutions but nothing I have tried has fixed my problem.

(I had to use port 80 for the SSH server as a lot of the places  blocked traffic through the \"usual ports\" such as 22.)\nThe real issue came when I tried to use this as a proxy.\nI used PuTTy and went to the SSH Tunnels section and added a Dynamic Forwarded Port and set the port to 80. I then went into Firefox and selected SOCKS v5, 127.0.0.1 as the IP Address, and the port as 80. This seemed to work perfectly and a \"whats my ip\" Google query returned the correct home IP address -- but then it stopped working.\nThe shell itself continued to work and I used it to reset the home SSH server to no avail. I have absolutely no clue what it is going wrong and any assistance will be greatly appreciated. \nIf you need any further information I will be happy to provide it.\n\nA: I had a similar issue when I tunneled using ssh in GNU/Linux. I don't know if it's related, but in the end the effect is the same, I couldn't find any answers on the net and this was the top search result so I decided to contribute with my solution.\nIn my case I was running this:\nssh -C2qTnN -D 127.0.0.1:3128 user@remote.host\n\nto open a SOCKS tunnel proxy and the command was in a bash script.\nThe issue and solution: I made the tunnel using one Linux user and its ssh keys and I was trying to connect using another user. The ssh command ran in the background so I couldn't see that it was asking me for authentication. Appending the new local user's public key from ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub to the remote server in /home/user/.ssh/authorized_keys did the trick.\nNote: The authorized_keys file from the remote server should be read-only on some systems, so if you create that file yourself do a chmod 400 authorized_keys because some ssh server configurations will refuse to read it if anyone has write permissions.\n", "Q: samsung series 5 A6 ultrabook i'm a fan of ubuntu, but for now i want my installation to be perfect for my new laptop, its a series 5 of samsung with A6 processor.\nSomebody suggest what to do? or mention any problems related to this? \nIm more concern of the drivers to increase its performance because i am to develop an android app.\nI need \"i dont know\" to make this unit run as fast as possible without any dangerous tradeoffs.\nAlso i read some forum saying that their units are overheating. -_- \nsomebody help me please. \nand also i want to switch to gnome 3.

And if you love Gnome 3, you can use it on Ubuntu instead of default Unity Desktop, you just have to download and install it.\n3.

I am not talking about a liveUSB, I mean I installed full Ubuntu onto the drive.  My problem is that when I have tried booting from the device, all I get is the black screen with the flashing \"_\" in the top left corner.  This persists for at least 15 minutes (at which point I give up).  I outline my process for creating the USB below.  My question is what exactly could be causing this, and how can I fix it?\nFrom a different liveUSB I chose the install option, after the timezone info and others, I chose \"Something Else\" for installation type.  On the single partition of my flash drive, I chose \"ext2 file system\", checked the format drive box, and set the mount point to \"/\"(the root).  After warning me about not having a swap partition (which I was told would not be a problem), I went through the rest of the install without a single issue.  But now when I boot from the drive, I get the persistent blank screen.\n\nA: Alright guys, I got everything to work.  I'm still not sure why it wasn't working earlier, but I basically found a way to partition my flash drive and changed the file system to ext4 and there were no more problems.  The install is working just fine.\n\nA: I had a similar problem installing Ubuntu on a Dell XPS 8500. The problem was a missing driver for the video card (in my case an nvidia geforce gt 620). \nThe solution was to boot into recovery mode (you may need to hold down shift while booting to get grub menu), then select \"drop to root shell prompt\" and type \"restart\" then return. If all goes well you will get the log in screen. Log in and install drivers. Hopefully that fixes it. \n", "Q: Motion is saving images to home directory I was interested in setting up a home security network.  I installed Motion in Ubuntu 12.04 and it worked fine.

Provided that Ubuntu can access ntfs partition of Windows but same can't be said about Windows this leads to a question mark on the significance of having /home partition while installing Ubuntu.\nAs far as I know /swap & / are the two partitions directly used by Ubuntu to store programs, installation & stuff while the documents/media resides in /home. Now because Ubuntu releases are more frequent than Windows & updates needs backup & relate stuff, so I came to decision to not to use /home at all, rather keep all my documents/media in ntfs, which would be untouched while upgrading Ubuntu as Win updates are once in a decade!\nIs my thinking correct? If yes, what would be the minimum space I should allot to /home plus how much I should allot to / one must know that I plan to use heavy applications like Maple, Matlab & Sagemath on Ubuntu.\n\nA: As much as I understand the potential benefit from having a shared NTFS partition accessible from both Ubuntu, and Windows we need to keep the following in mind:\n\n\n*\n\n*Data on NTFS do not have proper permissions when accessed from Ubuntu (think of executable, read-only, hidden...).  \n\n*No Trash on NTFS. Accidentally deleted files can not be recovered without recovery tools.  \n\n*There is no filesystem repair tool from Ubuntu. In case of filesystem inconsistencies booting Windows is a prerequisite.  \n\n*NTFS data access is a bit slower from Ubuntu.  \n\n\nTherefore an NTFS formatted data-only partition only makes sense when we have Windows in a dual-boot setup.\nHaving Ubuntu HOME on an NTFS formatted partition is not possible.\n\nA: According To me swap should be double of your RAM, if you need Home separately , it should be as per your requirement like I have 500 GB HDD  , I allocated 100 GB, other space you can give to /root (min 5 GB).\n", "Q: Trying to recover deleted Ubuntu partition I made a mistake in logging into my 200 GB Ubuntu partition. I could not access Grub after that. Using a live CD I then ran Boot_Repair and apparently deleted the partition, I guess because I ran it from my 70 GB Windows partition. I can send the results of boot_info before that and of Boot_Repair. Then I ran TestDisk, which apparently only found dev/sda/ -320GB / 298 / GiB - WDC - WD3200BEVT-22A23T0.\nWas there any more I could have done with TestDisk? I looked at the TestDisk_Step_By_Step example and found no way forward given that no other partitions turned up\nI have run gpart and found this:\n/sda1 - 15 GB\n/sda2 - system reserved\n/sda3 - 70.15 GB\n/sda4 - extended 212.84\nunallocated - 209.10\n/sda5 - unknown 3.74 . \n\nI have been told I can recover the partition using gparted's Rescue start end command, but I don't know what to enter for start and end.\nEDIT: TestDisk Deeper Search stated that \"the following partitions can't be recovered\" and listed a 220-GB Linux partition 6 times. Then it stated that \"The current number of heads per cylinder is 255 but the correct value may be 128\" and I could try to change it in the Geometry menu (because apparently these are overlapping partitions) \nSo should I do that?\n\nA: Since you have \"unallocated\" space (and only one chunk of it), as long as you only deleted one partition, I'd suggest using GParted (or your partition editor of choice) to create a new partition consuming all the free space, then mounting it read-only (mount -o ro /dev/sdaX /mnt/). As long as you mount it read-only, you shouldn't lose any more data.\nMake sure you don't accidentally format the partition in the process! Namely, choosing a filesystem type in GParted will make it format the partition.\n", "Q: Unable to install software I'm unable to install packages using apt-get install command.

All of this in one command and it must be able to run optimally at full performance in ubuntu 12.10.\nTime is not very important but if there is a way for me to calculate the ETA, I might be able to borrow my dad's i7 based CPU which should process it faster obviously otherwise I'll have to use an older core 2 CPU.\nSo please give me the complete command, be it sed/sort/awk to do this (whichever is most optimal).\n\nA: As you have already understood, you need to use sort -u to remove all duplicated lines. sort however does not support showing progress.\nYou can however write a little script that reads the contents from the input file and outputs it to the standard output, and while it does so it prints progress. Here is an example:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nset -e\n\nbytes_read=0\nbyte_count=$(wc -c \"$1\" | cut -d\" \" -f1)\nchunk_size=500000\n\nwhile read -N $chunk_size chunk\ndo\n    echo -ne \"\\rRead $bytes_read of $byte_count bytes [$[ 100 * bytes_read / byte_count ]%]\" >& 2\n    echo -n \"$chunk\"\n    bytes_read=$[ bytes_read + chunk_size ]\ndone < \"$1\"\n\necho >& 2\n\nYou can use this script as follows:\n./script-name input-file | sort -u > output-file\n\nThe progress will not take in account the time that sort will use to actually write the output, however this is fairly less than the time it takes to read the input file. This should be the most efficient shell-based solution.\n\nA: tee and tail -f are both good commands for following the action as files are written, but neither will help you with the ETA of your sort command (nor will they let you see what's going on under the hood of sort -u; just the final output after most of the work is done)\nEither pipe your output through tee (which will both write to 'output_file' and stdout):\nsort -u input_file | tee output_file\n\nor use tail -f:\nsort -u input_file -o output_file &\ntail -f output_file\n\nAdditionally: if your input is pre-sorted (as your question suggests) and all you want is to remove adjacent duplicate lines, then uniq is much faster than sort -u (and our tee/tail will actually be a useful way to monitor progress)\nuniq input_file | tee output_file\n\n", "Q: Mount Ubuntu shares remotely with Mac and Windows First time on here so please be gentle!\nI have setup a small school network with a Ubuntu 12.04 Server for use as a fileserver mainly. I have managed to set the server up (all command line based - no GUI) and setup the Samba shares, which works really well internally.\nInternally, the school have a combination of Mac's and Windows machines and they can all access the shares happily.\nThe school has a fixed IP ADSL connection and I have added a route in the router to allow me remote access to the server using SSH (port 22). That also works well.\nAll good so far!\nWhat I now want to do is allow remote access to the shares.\nI have done a bit of reading and thought I had found the answer with SSHFS but I am still non-the-wiser.\nSo, my basic questions is:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Windows, how can I map to the Ubuntu shares across the internet through the router?\n\n*In Mac OS, how can I add the remote share across the internet?\nThe school used to have a Windows server and the users were used to creating a VPN and then pulling up the share folders etc, but I'm unsure how to do this with the Ubuntu server.\nI assume I need to add another route through the router too allow for SSHFS or something similar?\nThanks in advance...\nDonald\n\nA: Tough Question\nIf you have not already discerned as much, you have asked questions that have long, complicated answers and many tangents. In the recent past, it would have been fairly easy to create a PPTP VPN on Ubuntu/Linux; but, do not do this because MS-CHAP is now crack-able. And, we would never want to take the easy way out by exposing Samba directly to the Internet by opening ports for it in a router/firewall (insecure). The easy way is to buy hardware for a VPN, maybe a SonicWall, or whichever product meets your needs. Otherwise, change the way you share files over the Internet (not with SMB).\nThe one goal not in the question is printing. For that, use IPP (CUPS on Ubuntu). Open port 631 on your router for your CUPS server. Also keep in mind that without a VPN, we will not have RDP unless we implement software like NeoRouter, below. But, you have no VPN at the moment, so I suppose that's not a problem.\nSo, we have a working SSH configuration already. Why not use it for leverage? First remember to install DenyHosts, fail2ban, or some other software to make sure you are protected from brute force attacks. The server will almost certainly be attacked continually from all over the world. (If not today, give it time.) Then, you want them to point-and-click on files, right?\nFor Windows\nSo, win-sshfs creates a way to mount Windows drive letters over SSH.\nAnd, Swish adds support for SFTP to Windows Explorer.\nFor Mac\nI cannot really comment much on this, because I do not know Mac. I know a Mac is Darwin Unix under the hood. A similar approach will likely work using perhaps MacFusion.\nSomething Different\nNeoRouter I have never tried but have heard good things. Not only does it provide for file sharing but RDP as well.\nObtuse\nWe could expound on this topic for a long time. Thus, this answer is mostly obtuse. It can be quite challenging to implement an elegant solution that meets all requirements. \nThere is so much more to it. If you are using the SFTP/SSHFS method, then it will take a little more as well. For example, file system permissions to shared directories will likely be done with ACL. Though this is not a precise answer, I hope there are enough clues to move forward.\n", "Q: Shall I go for 12.04 or 12.10 if I want stability and speed? I think this might be the most annoying question for the pros here, but I'd really like to know which version is better if I'd like a super fast start-up and processing speed. I know it rather depends on the CPU, but the OS is important too. I dont really care for the long term support since I normally re-install my system once a year. I'd just like to choose a stable and fast OS and I have been reading all sorts of things, but no one has given a proper answer to my question/doubt.\nThanks a lot.\n\nUPDATE: if someone has already asked this, then please merge this with that post and close it.

I would like to be able to remove the CPU spike.\n\nA: In my case, the message was hinting at a permissions problem with the bash script, but I couldn't see it until I installed an MTA.\nAs suggested I ran:\nsudo aptitude install postfix\n\nI chose \"Local\" during setup and after running the cron job again:\nsudo tail -f /var/mail/<user>\n\nIn my case I replaced \n<user>\n\nwith \"root\".\nI was then able to see the error output related to permissions.\n\nA: This is an old question but there is an additional answer that is useful in some circumstances.\nPipe the output of your cron command through logger so they end up in the syslog.\nIt's slightly easier than installing postfix, and it puts this output into syslog alongside your other logs. This command will capture stdout AND stderr so you won't see the No MTA installed message and you'll see all your output in the syslog.\nExample cron entry:\n0 3 * * * (cmd1;  cmd2) 2>&1 | logger -t mycmd\n\nYou can view logs with your tag mycmd using:\ngrep 'mycmd' /var/log/syslog\n\n\nA: As stated in an earlier answer,\nthis happens because your cron jobs are producing output,\nand then the cron daemon tries to email that output to you. \nIf you don’t want to (or can’t) install an MTA,\nbut you want to see the output,\nyou can redirect the output of the cron job to a log file. \nEdit your crontab file with\ncrontab -e\n\n(use sudo if the issue is with root’s crontab)\nand add >> /some/log/file 2>&1\nafter every command, like this:\n0 3 * * * cmd  >> /some/log/file 2>&1\n(>> /some/log/file\nsends the standard output to the named file,\nappending to any existing content,\nand 2>&1 sends the error messages to the same place.)\nIf there are multiple commands on a line,\nseparated by ;, &,  &&  or ||,\nyou should do the above for each command, like this:\n0 3 * * * cmd1  >> /some/log/file 2>&1;  cmd2  >> /some/log/file 2>&1\nor group them, like this:\n0 3 * * * (cmd1;  cmd2)  >> /some/log/file 2>&1\nIf the command line ends with &,\ninsert the redirection after the command but before the &. \nIf there are commands separated by | (a pipeline),\nthe simple solution is to group them:\n0 3 * * * (cmd1  |  cmd2)  >> /some/log/file 2>&1\nbut see also the last paragraph, below.\nIf you want to ignore stdout and capture only stderr,\nuse > /dev/null 2>> /some/log/file instead. \nPut the log file wherever you want — your home directory,\n/var/log, or even /tmp if you’re sure you won’t need to keep it.\nThen look at the log file after the job runs.\nIf you find a mangled mess of interlaced messages,\nit may be that the program(s) are writing stdout and stderr concurrently\nwith poor coordination. \nIn that case, try writing them to separate files\nwith >> /some/log/file1  2>> /some/log/file2. \nYou may need to do something similar with pipelines:\n0 3 * * * cmd1  2>> /some/log/filecmd1err  |  cmd2  >> /some/log/filecmd2 2>&1\n(It’s probably also best to use separate files\nfor commands separated by &.)\n\nA: You can set MAILTO=”” variable at the start of your crontab file. This will also disable email alert. Edit/Open your cron jobs:\n$ crontab -e\n\nAt the top of the file, enter:\nMAILTO=\"\"\n\nhttps://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/disable-the-mail-alert-by-crontab-command/\n\nA: In crontab add this as first line:\nMAILTO=\"\"\n\nThis will prevent cron from trying to send an e-mail.\n\nA: If you don't want to install an MTA (which I currently have no need for) you can pipe the results of the cron job to a log file.\nsudo crontab -e\n\nthen with your cron job would look like this.\n0 3 * * * /cmd/to/run >> /var/log/somelogfile.log\n\nthen you can just tail the log and see what happened\nsudo tail -f -n 50 /var/log/somelogfile.log\n\nThis is what I have been doing on any server that I see that message in syslog\n\nA: Linux uses mail for sending notifications to the user. Most Linux distributions have a mail service including an MTA (Mail Transfer Agent) installed. Ubuntu doesn't though.\nYou can install a mail service, postfix for example, to solve this problem.\nsudo apt-get install postfix\n\nOr you can ignore it. I don't think the inability of cron to send messages has anything to do with the CPU spike (that's linked to the underlying job that cron is running). It might be safest to install an MTA and then read through the messages (mutt is a good system mail reader).\n\nA: *\n\n*At first, install postfix, that can resolve the problem\nsudo apt-get install postfix\n\n\n*If Ubuntu, you can edit the crontab file\nsudo vim /etc/crontab\n\n\n*Attention，edit the top file，not any code in the first line，and enter\nMAILTO=root // current system user\n\n\n*When cron executes any task，you will get an email\nmail\n\n\nA: This happens because your cron jobs are producing output and then the cron daemon tries to email that output to you (i.e. root). If you don't need that output, the easiest way to solve this is to discard it at the crontab:\nsudo crontab -e\n\nand add >/dev/null 2>&1 to every job:\n* * * * * yourCommand >/dev/null 2>&1\n\n\nA: One side effect of adding /dev/null 2>&1 to the cron job command, is that it will discard both STDERR and STDOUT (Standard Error as well as Output). This works fine if you don't want any emails from cron. But if you want your errors to be emailed to you, use >/dev/null instead. Read this blog post for more explanation.\nYou'll still need to install an MTA (mail transfer agent) to send the error emails though. Postfix is simple enough to install with: sudo apt-get install postfix\n\nA: I had this problem using the Kitematic Docker tools.\nGo to the magento container and click on exe.\nThen run  \napt-get update\n\nThis is if you're trying to get magento run on kitematic.

I was gong to install Ubuntu on my Mac using USB.\nAt the moment i'm reading instructions and I don't understand them:\nHere are the instructions\nIt says \n\nConvert the .iso file to .img using the convert option of hdiutil\n\nCan anyone explain me what .img is, what it is for, and where I can get it?\n\nA: hdiutil is a MAC utility which you need to run in terminal to convert the Ubuntu .iso to .IMG\nWhen you down load an Ubuntu installable from ubuntu website, the installable is a .iso extension installable. For installing it on a MAC machine, you need to run the above utility to convert the ubuntu \".iso\" extensioned file to \".img\" extensioned file.\nSo for e.g if the Ubuntu installable that you have downloaded is 'ubuntu.iso' then after running the above command, it will get converted to 'ubuntu.img'\nFollow the instructions as mentioned in the url in your question.\n", "Q: Maas doesn't install node I'm installing Maas server with an external dhcp server.\nI have used Ubuntu Server 12.10 and the MAAS Daily Builds ppa repository.\nI have created the admin account and I ran the sudo maas-import-pxe-files\ncommand without errors.

The latter has been run through QA rather than just whatever happens to be current trunk.\nMost likely the \"pserv.log\" file will be more interesting than the \"maas.log\". (IIRC, the former is about the individual machine controllers, while the latter is about the system as a whole.)\nHave you actually commissioned the machine? You mention that its status is 'ready' which I believe means it is waiting to be commissioned.\n\nA: FWIW, the new MAAS 1.7 image download process is much smoother, and you should have fewer issues installing the node.

Before the switch I made a list of all programs installed on my Ubuntu 12.04.\nsudo dpkg --get-selections > file\n\nAfter that I re-installed Ubuntu 12.10 and when all was done I performed the following command: \nsudo dpkg --set-selections < file\nsudo apt-get dselect-upgrade\n\nHere is when the problems start: I get several warnings like this when performing the commands above:\ndpkg: warning: package not in database at line xxx\n\nand many of the programs are not installed. I don't know what the line means.\nI have searched the web, and it seems that I'm not the only one suffering from this. I have not find any solution that worked for me. \nAny ideas what is causing this?\n\nA: You have not only a list of installed programs, but every single package that was on your computer. Some of the packages are not in the repository any more, since they are replaced. You should be able to ignore these errors.\n\nA: Check your PPAs and try to get as many you had in 12.04 added to your 12.10. If you don't remember them, no big deal, but you'll lose software, while keeping the dependencies installed from the main repos.\nOn your old installation, you may have PPAs and repositories. Since the repositories may obsolete or cease packaging certain packages, \nFor example, a PPA had foo and the default repositories had bar. However, on the new version, the repositories no longer include bar and you don't have the foo PPA. Neither of these packages has been installed, but their dependencies that still exist will be since they are part of sudo dpkg --get-selections. \n\nA: Hi and thanks for your inputs!\nThe problem is that I receive warnings on every software/package on the list and nothing is installed. every thing could not be obsolete?\nNow lets be honest, I made my computer \"crash\" when tying different things! In a attempt to avoid warnings I thought that if I stripped my file created with  sudo dpkg --get-selections > fileand only kept the lines for software I wanted to install like eclipse, back-in-time and so on, I would get my software installed. My thought was that things excluded from the list would be kept untouched as it is on my laptop. What seems to happen when I executed the commandssudo dpkg --set-selections < fileand sudo apt-get dselect-upgrade is that the things on the list was installed and everything else was removed. It seems that this was not a good idea ;-)\nNot to worry, I reinstalled Ubuntu and used Ubuntu Software center to install all the software I needed. It seems that this is the safest way for a newbie like me. However wouldn't it be great if there was a smooth way of getting the same set of software installed after you reinstalled Ubuntu?

We have to do cuda 5.0 programming on Ubuntu 11.10. Since we are using a shared workstation, we have chosen to go for a external HDD installed Ubuntu. Will this ubuntu work as the normal PC version supporting the drivers and softwares? \n\nA: Everything should work the same way whether ubuntu is installed on an internal or external drive.\nThe one thing that will make a difference is how you install it. If you install it from another computer/OS with the USB installer, you will get the \"Try or install\" screen on boot. This will not be exactly the same.\nIf you install it on the external drive, the same way you would if it were an internal one, then that is the \"normal PC version\". There is no difference. In fact, I've installed it on USB flash drives this way, and the only difference is that they are slower than internal hard drives. Just make sure that you choose the right drive when installing so you don't erase anything important.

The error is a machine check exception which is a low level hardware failure and nothing to do with a faulty operating system.\nIt either means you system memory is failing for some reason, or there is a bus issue or perhaps the CPU itself has issues.

goes from 8.34 W to 13.54 W and the current_now increases, but shouldn't it be using less energy in battery mode since the screen is much dimmer and it's in power saving mode? (or is that normal behavior?)\nIt also seems to drain more quickly than what it predicts, especially with the 1-1.25 hour drop in the first minute of being unplugged, which seems odd.\nWhat really concerns me is that Ubuntu 12.10 may not be properly managing the battery (with the sudden change in charge/life from 2:30 to 1:30 or 1:15 within a minute of unplugging), and that a new battery may quickly die under Ubuntu 12.10.\nI'd greatly appreciate any advice/suggestions on what to do, and especially whether there's a way to get back the 1-1.5 hrs of battery life that were suddenly lost when changing from WinXp to Ubuntu 12.10.\nThanks :)\n\nA: Your battery is shot and needs replaced:\nenergy-full: 21.1248 Wh\nenergy-full-design: 48.6 Wh\ncapacity: 43.4667%\n\nThis shows the battery is holding less than half of its design capacity.\nvoltage: 12.173 V\n\nThis is also off; the fully charged voltage should be 12.5 V.\n\nA: Basically the answer of @psusi is right but I might have a workaround.\nThe fact that Windows runs longer on that battery indicates that it still has more capacity than Ubuntu calculated. If this is the case, it can run longer than the shown battery time. All you have to do is to disable the automatic shutdown on low power as explained in this answer.\nIf you do so your laptop will keep running even though Ubuntu shows 0% battery power. The only problem is you have no way to tell how long. At some point, it will turn off without warning. Besides not properly shutting down, you will lose unsaved data.\n\nA: As said previously, your battery can only contain half its original capacity, but to get that 1 hour of Windows extra back into Ubuntu, install TLP in Ubuntu and restart. your battery life will DOUBLE\n", "Q: How to check \"apt-get upgrade\" status after losing ssh connection? Usually I upgrade my Ubuntu installation through a ssh connection. Sometimes this ssh connection would be lost or I would accidentally close the terminal window. \nIt is possible to check the upgrade status after a ssh re-login into the computer? \n\nA: The following logs are related to apt upgrades:\n/var/log/apt/history.log\n/var/log/apt/term.log\n/var/log/dpkg.log\n\nIf the command was dist-upgrade, there are additional logs in:\n/var/log/dist-upgrade\n\nFYI, it is usually safe to just re-run the upgrade and apt will continue where it left off when the process died due to disconnection.  However...\nA GNU Screen Primer:\nWhen ssh'ing into a remote server and starting a long-running process in the foreground, it is best practice to use GNU Screen.  Screen provides a virtual terminal that continues running even if your ssh connection is lost.\nInstall screen:\nsudo apt-get install screen\n\nRun screen:\nscreen\n\nAfter running screen you will get a command line prompt as with a normal terminal.  You can then run the upgrade from inside screen:\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nTo understand how this works, \"detach\" screen by pressing Ctrl+a, d.  This will return you to the non-screen terminal.  You can see the list of running screens with\nscreen -list\n\nIf you only have one screen running, you can reattach it with:\nscreen -raAd\n\n(This detaches screen in case it is attached elsewhere, and reattaches it to the terminal you are currently running.)\nTypically you cannot scroll 'normally' from within screen without some extra setup.  To scroll within screen, press Ctrl-Esc to enter cursor mode.  You can then scroll down and up with j and k.  Press Esc again to exit cursor mode.\nThere are many more resources on the net available for additional screen functions.  It is an invaluable standard tool for system administration.\nSee also:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to keep processes running after ending ssh session?\n\nA: To see real-time output from background apt job, use:\nsudo tail -f /var/log/apt/term.log\n\n\nA: I had an upgrade in progress (asking me whether to keep or replace a config file; this information I took from /var/log/apt/term.log) when my terminal was closed by another person. Restarting apt upgrade complained about a lock file being held.\nMy fix was to do the following:\nsudo killall apt # to release the lock\nsudo dpkg --configure -a # to fix the interrupted upgrade\nsudo apt upgrade # to make sure no packages are left not upgraded\n\n\nA: In addition to doublerebel's answer, I noticed an alternative today.\nI went to bed last night after starting an upgrade over SSH. I stupidly forgot to start it in screen and lost my SSH session overnight.\nI was just about to start researching retty when I noticed that root had started a screen session.\nme@GAMMA:~$ ps aux | grep -E 'release|upgrade|apt'\nroot      6208  0.0  0.0  29140  1628 ?

I was back in the game.\n\nA: Had exactly the same issue, lost my connection and the dpkg process was waiting for input.\nMaybe next time try: sudo dpkg --configure -a\n\nA: TL;DR: After losing ssh connection you might have an unreachable console dialog blocking your upgrade from continuing. Kill the whiptail process to allow it to continue.\nI had a similar problem and while some of the answers were useful, they didn't help me resolve my problem.  But between @Huckle's answer and @CivMeierFan's 2nd comment on @Sebastian Faujour's answer, I found my way forward.\n\"ps aux | grep -E 'release|upgrade|apt'\" showed a whiptail process (also shown with \"/var/log/apt/term.log\", but in that case it just dumped an unusable console prompt. Helpful to understand why the upgrade was blocked, but not helpful for resolving the problem).\nKilling the whiptail process allowed the upgrade to continue.\n\nA: This post helped me to do better in the future: use 'screens'\nThis Debian post helped me to fix my acute problem:\nhttps://wiki.debian.org/Teams/Dpkg/FAQ\nsudo fuser -vki -TERM /var/lib/dpkg/lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend\n\nsudo dpkg --configure --pending\n\n", "Q: Desktop icon's won't show until I open folder in file manager When I start my computer and login the desktop icons do not show. However, when I open the desktop folder in my file manager, they appear. How can I make them show right from the start?\nI use Nemo as file manager, Unity is my desktop environment and the whole thing runs on Ubuntu 12.10 Quantal Quetzal. \n\nA: I think the problem is that Nemo doesn't start automatically.\nTo check this, as soon as you log in open \"system monitor\" and control if \"Nemo\" is one of the active processes.\nIf not you should go to \"Applications boot\", or something similar, and add an entry, call it \"Nemo\" and fill in as a command \"nemo\".\n\nA: Make sure the Advanced Settings/ Gnome Tweak tool is installed .

Basicall I have installed a few desktop environments. And if you are familiar with Unity, you know that the way switching works, is you get this sort of drop-down with all the environments installed, you then high-light the desired option and click \"ok\". So my problem is that I have quite a few installed, and OK button is outside of the screen, and I cannot find any way to scroll down? So in turn, I cannot switch my DE as a result.. any way around this?\n\nA: You have a few solutions here:\n\n\n*\n\n*You could change the default session to be what you want using lightdm-set-defaults. If you've already set a different session, this may not work, I think it will prefer the session you chose last. The session name should match the file name in /usr/share/xsessions, without the .desktop on the end. I think maybe the default session moves to the top of the list though, so this may still work for you.\n/usr/lib/lightdm/lightdm-set-defaults --session <session> \n\n*You can go to /usr/share/xsessions and rename the ones you don't want to something besides <session>.desktop, like <session>.desktop.old.  I think that will hide them. You could also just uninstall the desktop environments you don't want.\nLastly, please take a screen shot of this and file a bug against unity-greeter for this list not fitting properly.\n\nA: Use the tab key to scroll down the list, then press enter to select the DE, then tab more until the OK button, then press enter to select and return to the password screen.

The user may later choose to kill the whole process tree (session). \nI have done this by utilizing setsid. One scenario is starting a whole bunch of different processes via a shell script by: setsid <shell script>. The PID represents the new session and killing it will kill all processes spawned in that session. It worked great until Ubuntu 12.10 was released. Now i cannot kill all sessions started via setsid. One example is Firefox and Google Earth. Gedit can still be killed if started through setsid.\nI created a simple test program that perform kill -SIGTERM -PID. The test program manages to kill firefox started via setsid under Ubuntu 12.04 but not under Ubuntu 12.10. I don't know what has changed. I have executed the program in both distributions using OpenJDK 6, 7 and Oracle JDK 6.\n\n\npublic class kill\n{\n        public static void main(String[] args)\n        {\n    try \n        {\n        System.out.println(\"kill -SIGTERM -\" + args[0]);\n        Process proc = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(\"kill -SIGTERM -\" + args[0]);\n        int exitVal = proc.waitFor();\n        System.out.println(\"Exit value: \" + exitVal); // often 1 under Ubuntu 12.10\n        }\n    catch (Exception e)\n        {\n        }\n}\n\n\n\nA: In Ubunutu 12.04 and Centos 5 + 6 it's possible to use the signal name like SIGTERM but on 12.10 one has to use -TERM instead. Changing my code so that the signal names don't have the prefix 'SIG' seem to work well on 12.04 and 12.10. So the example code that works for me is:\nProcess proc = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(\"kill -TERM -\" + args[0]);\n\nTo clarify, kill -SIGTERM -<PID> works in the Bash shell in Ubuntu 12.10 but not if it's executed through Runtime.getRuntime.exec(), one qould have to remove the 'SIG' part as described above.\n", "Q: Why does Google Music Manager refuse to open in 12.04?

If you have software RAID, that gets setup in the initrd. If you have whole-disk encryption, thats handled in the initrd. Some storage drivers have to have things run from userland before using them, so those are handled in the initrd. Thre are probably other things I'm missing. You can checkout the whole thing on an Ubuntu system by looking in /usr/share/initramfs-tools. The file, init, is actually the init script that gets run first by the kernel. If you look at the bottom, you see where it sets up the new root FS and runs /sbin/init (which is upstart)\nBut for a specialized system, like say an embedded system, this is all extra noise and complication. It does eat up a TINY fraction of boot time. We're taking 1 second or less, but thats 1 more second to shave off boot time on devices that need to boot fast.\nUpstart's part in this play is creating the required device nodes and other system setup that is not handled by initrd/initramfs. It needs to initialize the system to such state all required pieces are present for system to successfully boot into userland.

A Nautilus folder will be opened automatically when inserting a CD in a drive. It is under Devices with name Audiodisk. As long as the files are accessed via Nautilus everything is fine. \nThe problem is that I can not find the cdrom files from the File System. This means that I can not access the cdrom files directly from applications.\nThis is a problem in 12.10.\nI have checked all subfolders in /media, /mnt and /cdrom and didn't find the cdrom content there.\nmount and df commands do not show anything related to cdrom.\nIn /etc/fstab there is a line\n\n/dev/scd0       /media/cdrom0   udf,iso9660 user,noauto,exec,utf8 0\n  0\n\nBut the cdrom files are not in /media/cdrom0, it seems empty.\nDisks show the drive as \n\nDevice /dev/sr0 (Read-Only)\n\nWhen clicking a cdrom file in Nautilus and checking the properties it says under the Basic tab \n\nLocation: cdda://sr0/\n\n/etc/mtab commmand output\n\n/dev/sda1 / ext3 rw,relatime,errors=remount-ro 0 0\nproc /proc proc rw 0 0\nsysfs /sys sysfs rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev 0 0\nnone /sys/fs/fuse/connections fusectl rw 0 0\nnone /sys/kernel/debug debugfs rw 0 0\nnone /sys/kernel/security securityfs rw 0 0\nudev /dev devtmpfs rw,mode=0755 0 0\ndevpts /dev/pts devpts rw,noexec,nosuid,gid=5,mode=0620 0 0\ntmpfs /run tmpfs rw,noexec,nosuid,size=10%,mode=0755 0 0\nnone /run/lock tmpfs rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev,size=5242880 0 0\nnone /run/shm tmpfs rw,nosuid,nodev 0 0\nnone /run/user tmpfs rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev,size=104857600,mode=0755 0 0\n/dev/sda6 /home ext3 rw,relatime,user_xattr 0 0\nbinfmt_misc /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc binfmt_misc rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev 0 0\ngvfsd-fuse /run/user/s/gvfs fuse.gvfsd-fuse rw,nosuid,nodev,user=s 0 0\n\nHow to find the mount point?\n\nA: Based on the Nautilus properties you gave, that CD is an audio CD and not a CDROM - it's being detected as CDDA (CD Digital Audio) type, which is not a regular filesystem.  Since it isn't using the iso9660 filesystem, the line in /etc/fstab gets ignored.   The only way to view the contents of an audio CD is via a tool that understands CDDA format.\n\nA: It would be under /run/user/s/gvfs on the filesystem.\nAnother thing you can do is simply drag the file from Nautilus into the file open dialog of the application you want to open it in, or to a terminal. This should give you the full path to open with the classic POSIX methods for apps not using gvfs.\nAlthough, if it is an Audio CD, it is likely not actually mounted. The underlying VFS support in GNOME/Nautilus just scans the disc and presents the tracks as raw wav files in the UI.\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu as the primary OS on multi-boot system I was thinking of downloading this to my netbook since I love the operating system.

I have noticed that different applications use different units, or mean different things by them.\nFor example, I have come across kB, KB, KiB, Kb and K. How many bytes do each of these units represent?\nIf there are different definitions for these units, which ones do which applications use?\n\nA: Introduction:\nData in electronic computers is stored and transmitted in various ways, but they are always interpreted as a sequence of binary values, either 0 or 1. One binary value is called a bit. Eight bits is called an octet, or a byte. On this there is consensus.\nA bit is denoted as b, and a byte as B. On this there is consensus, and if you ever spot an application breaking this convention, it's definitely a bug or an error. People frequently confuse the two, but application developers and manufacturers on the whole do not.\nOnce you get to larger units, there are two schools of thought, which sadly means that there is no consensus. Different operating systems and different applications belong to one school of thought or another.\n\nUbuntu's unit policy:\nUbuntu has a published units policy, which defines units like this.\nThe first set of units are multiples of 1024. (Why 1024? Because 1024 is 2 to the power of 10, which can make life easier for programmers.) This set of units is called binary units or the IEC prefixes, after the IEC standard that defined them:\n\n\n*\n\n*One kibibyte: 1KiB = 1024 bytes (note the capital K)\n\n*One mebibyte: 1MiB = 1024KiB = 1048576 bytes\n\n*One gibibyte: 1GiB = 1024MiB = 1048576KiB = 1073741824 bytes\n\n\nThe second set of units are multiples of 1000. This aligns much more closely with commonly used units in the SI system, such as metres, litres and grams. A kilogram is 1000 grams; in the same way, a kilobyte is 1000 bytes. This set of units is called decimal units or the SI prefixes.\n\n\n*\n\n*One kilobyte: 1kB = 1000 bytes (note the lowercase k)\n\n*One megabyte: 1MB = 1000kB = 1000000 bytes\n\n*One gigabyte: 1GB = 1000MB = 1000000kB = 1000000000 bytes\n\n\nThe traditional units:\nTraditionally, many applications, operating systems and developers used binary units, giving them SI names. Ubuntu, GNOME and OS X all attempt to follow the published standards as explained previously, however, Microsoft Windows and many UNIX utilities still use these traditional units, so you need to be aware of them.\n\n\n*\n\n*One kilobyte: 1KB = 1024 bytes (note the capital K)\n\n*One megabyte: 1MB = 1024KB = 1048576 bytes\n\n*One gigabyte: 1GB = 1024MB = 1048576KB = 1073741824 bytes\n\n\nTraditionally, however, speeds are specified in bits per second, with SI prefixes! So 1Mbps is actually 1000000 bits per second, which is 125000 bytes per second, even on Microsoft Windows.\n\nHow to avoid ambiguity:\nAs you can see, these conflicting definitions lead to a lot of confusion. When I say 1MB, do I mean a million bytes, or do I mean 1048576 bytes?\nTo avoid ambiguity, you should use one of these strategies:\n\n\n*\n\n*Exclusively use IEC prefixes. 1MiB is always unambiguous.\n\n*Include a conversion to the number of bytes. eg: 1MB or 1000000 bytes\n\n*Use both IEC and SI prefixes, eg: 1MiB or 1.048MB approx. I prefer this solution, as it makes it clear what you mean, and it the reader doesn't have to perform any mental calculations.\n\n\nWhere there is ambiguity, here's a good set of rules of thumb that has served me well:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you spot KB (with a capital K), then the traditional units are probably being used.\n\n*If you spot kB (with a lowercase k), then the SI units are probably being used.\n\n*If the number is describing a speed, then decimal units are probably being used.\n\n*If the number is on OS X, on modern Ubuntu or GNOME applications, then decimal units are probably being used.\n\n*If the number is on a hard drive or another piece of computing equipment, then decimal units are probably being used.\n\n*If the number is from a command-line utility on Linux, then traditional binary units are probably being used.\n\n*If the number is from a Microsoft Windows application, then traditional binary units are probably being used.\n\n\nWhen it comes to Ubuntu applications, have a look a this list specifying which applications use which system.\nReferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu's units policy\n\n*units man page\n", "Q: User Switching in XFCE 12.04 with LightDM and dumping unneeccesary Gnome libs I'm an elder non-techie Mac-to-Linux convert trying to play the linux tech game by ear, so please be gentle! :)\nI am running XFCE Ubuntu 12.04 totally on a 8-gig flash drive and it's fantastic. I am starting to run into potential space issues (down to 1.0 gig free from 1.9 gigs since being installed last summer), most likely because of growing Thunderbird mail files, and this prompted my question. I just installed lightDM on my system because I want the ability to switch users in XFCE if I follow instructions on another blog. They advised using LightDM instead of GDM because LightDM doesn't download Gnome libraries. That's great since I need the space, but my question is how can I tell whether I don't already have Gnome libraries installed from other updates and such? And can I minimize having any Gnome libraries? The method for me to switch users entails creating a \"fast-user-switch\" file in /usr/local/bin; is there any easier way? One last thing so I din't have topen another needless thread; while experimenting I somehow lost the share folder in one of my accounts. Is there any way to get a share folder back?\nThanks for any tips!\nJim in NYC\n\nA: Regarding your gdm question, you can try the following. Make sure that you do have the lightdm installed (!), then: \nsudo apt-get remove gdm\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nThe second command will check which packages where previously installed automatically as dependencies, and are no longer needed given all the uninstalled packages. \nFor a more radical approach, you can remove all libgnome-related libraries. But be extra-careful, as this has the potential to remove a lot of apps that you may need. So check each proposed removal carefully: \nsudo apt-get remove libgnome*\n\nLastly, I would suspect that your space issues are caused by updated kernels (aqt least this is what happens on my machine!).  Check in Synaptic if you have several linux-image-* and linux-headers-* packages installed, and remove some of the older packages. (Always keep one or two extra kernels as fallback for when things don't work with the most recent kernel.)\n", "Q: On Ubuntu, which applications use binary file size units, and which ones use decimal units? Applications on Ubuntu use different file size units. Binary units are multiples of 1024, whereas decimal units are multiples of 1000.\nWhich applications on Ubuntu use which system?\n\nA: Intro:\nBefore reading this answer, make sure you understand what the different units and the different systems are. This is a quick reminder.\nThe IEC units are 1KiB (1024 bytes), 1MiB, 1GiB and so on. The SI units are 1kB (1000 bytes), 1MB, 1GB and so on. Ubuntu's unit policy mandates that IEC and SI units be used only.\nThe traditional units are 1KB (1024 bytes), 1MB, 1 GB and so on. Ubuntu's unit policy only allows using them for backwards compatability.\nI'm making this answer a community wiki, so please add applications to the list and keep it up-to-date!\nGraphical applications:\n\n\n*\n\n*GNOME System Monitor follows Ubuntu's unit policy, using IEC units.\n\n*Nautilus follows Ubuntu's unit policy, using SI units. The properties dialog helpfully converts into bytes as well.\n\n*GNOME Disks follows Ubuntu's unit policy, using SI units, helpfully converting into bytes as well.\n\n*Disk Usage Analyser (baobab) follows Ubuntu`s unit policy, using SI units.\n\n*GParted follows Ubuntu's unit policy, using IEC units.\n\n*system-config-lvm uses the traditional system. (bug report)\n\n*Firefox uses the traditional system. (bug report)\n\n\nCommand-line applications:\n\n\n*\n\n*ls uses the traditional system, but has an --si option.\n\n*du uses the traditional system, but has an --si option.\n\n*df uses the traditional system, but has an --si or -H option.\n\n*fdisk uses the traditional system\n\n*fparted uses the traditional system\n\n*lvextend and other commands belonging to the LVM allow you to choose between binary and decimal units, depending on whether you use lower-case or upper-case letters.

Overall, that's probably not the best way to go.\n\n*Ubuntu 12.10 ships with EFI support. It also supposedly ships with support for booting with Secure Boot active. (Any PC with a Windows 8 logo must ship with Secure Boot active.) That said, I've never tried it, so I don't know how well it works in practice. If necessary, you should be able to disable Secure Boot, too.\n\n*In theory, you should be able to install Ubuntu on the SSD and Windows 8 on the spinning disk.\n\n\nYou may want to check out my Web page on EFI boot loaders for Linux. It's not really an EFI primer, but it does have some basic information on it, and on options for how to boot Linux on an EFI-based computer.\n\nA: I had a lot of problems installing Ubuntu 12.10 alongside Windows 8 but this tutorial helped me a lot. Maybe it will help you:\nDual-boot Windows 8 and Ubuntu 12.10 on UEFI hardware \n\nA: *\n\n*Ubuntu12.10 has some issues with UEFI but running Boot-Repair after installing Ubuntu solves them. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI\n\n*Computers sold with Windows8 all have SecureBoot, which may cause problems (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI#SecureBoot ), so better buying a computer without preinstalled Win8.\n\n*To avoid compatibility problems, best is buying a computer with preinstalled Ubuntu or without OS. Nowdays, there are cheap ones, eg at ubuntu-fr we generally recommend Clevo laptop, they are all compatible with Ubuntu12.04/12.10, and there are good ones for 350$.

Will it work if I just put the directory on a USB stick, then replace the default one by ny old one after the install is complete (I'll use the same username/paaswd on the new install)?\n\nA: I wouldn't do it. It will be safer to save your data & do a clean install. There's no guarantee that the config files will match & that could create conflicts.\n\nA: My suggestion is to use cinnamon instead of migrating to mint\nhttp://www.linuxbsdos.com/2012/09/20/install-cinnamon-1-6-in-ubuntu-12-04-lts/\nCinnamon 1.6, the latest edition of the desktop environment whose development was partly inspired by popular dissatisfaction with Unity and GNOME 3 was released yesterday. It is a project from the developers of Linux Mint, a desktop distribution derived from Ubuntu.\nAs a Free Software desktop environment and project, you can install it on any distribution, provided there is a binary package for it. Without that, you can compile it from source, if doing business at the command-line does not scare you.\nUbuntu Cinnamon PPA\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:gwendal-lebihan-dev/cinnamon-stable\n\nsudo apt-get update \n\nsudo apt-get install cinnamon\n\n\nA: Sure.

This is usually safe/correct,\n# unless you have some unusual permissions set up somewhere (like a directory\n# for sharing files with other users on the system) \nchown -R $USER:$USER ~\n\nSome problems you may run into:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disk Space: make sure your usb stick has enough space\n\n*File size too big:  If your home directory has more than 2G of files, you might create a file too big for a fat32 usb-stick.  Either format it ext3, tar up partial directories, copy in batches or use another method to archive things (rsync, network copy it, etc)\n\n*if you don't use tar, and use cp or rsync, you need to copy to a unix filesystem, like ext3.  Copying to a fat usb-disk without using tar will mess up permissions.\n\n*dot files: make sure if you do partial directories, you don't forget all the files in your home directory that start with a dot (hidden).\n\n", "Q: How to know when commercial app will be published Is there a way for me to know when my app will be published.

While trying to edit it, he accidentaly deleted it, I'm trying to recover.\nAfter some research, I've been able to discover that there's a way to recover it and I've been able to make it work but the iPod had 64 GB and doing it through SSH is deadly slow, in the last two days, the process stopped twice with this error:\nroot@g1:/home/gustav# ssh root@192.168.1.101 dd if=/dev/rdisk0s2s1 bs=1M | dd of=iphone-use2.img\nroot@192.168.1.101's password: \nWrite failed: Broken pipe\n4113088+0 records in\n4113088+0 records out\n2105901056 bytes (2.1 GB) copied, 51107.2 s, 41.2 kB/s\n\nI believe the probability of this process  stoping in the middle is a high, mainly because it's a dd on 64GB through SSH (it seems it's going to take 6-7 days) then I thought about copying little pieces of the iPod's disk at a time and merge them after the process is complete.\nSince the beginning, I noticed that the process through SSH is slow, then I have two questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is it possible to make these splitted images from the iPod's hard drive using dd?\n\n*Would it be possible to use something else (such as FTP or anything faster than SSH) in order to achieve this? \n\n\nThe title of the question have only one of this questions for the following reason: \"I've been able to make it work through SSH, having to wait is not really a problem - the processing stopping all the time is the problem, splitting the image is the objective, but you could also help me to find something that  would work a little faster.\"\nAlso for the ones who suggest: \"Why don't you just plug the iPod in and mount it's disk?\" - the answer is: With the small research I did until now, it seems to be impossible, the only viable way I found to do it is with dd + ssh.\n3: I've read here that there's a block size, is this related somehow?\n\nA: You could use 3 options from dd, count, skip and seek like:\ndd if=/dev/rdisk0s2s1 of=iphone1.img bs=1M count=1024\ndd if=/dev/rdisk0s2s1 skip=1024 of=iphone2.img bs=1M count=1024\ndd if=/dev/rdisk0s2s1 skip=2048 of=iphone3.img bs=1M count=1024\n\nAnd so on. This way it will create several images, with the same size(1024MB).\nTo restore the from the backup, load the images in order, and use commands like these:\n dd if=iphone1.img of=/somepartition bs=1M conv=sync,noerror\n dd if=iphone2.img of=/somepartition seek=1024 bs=1M conv=sync,noerror\n dd if=iphone3.img of=/somepartition seek=2048 bs=1M conv=sync,noerror\n\n", "Q: How to keep a package with unmet dependencies?

This worked fine.\nThen, In installed Ubuntu 10.4 and for a while, I could use BOTH Ubuntu and Windows as GRUB was automatically loaded with Ubuntu installation. I could choose which system OS to use upon load up.\nThen, one day, Windows disappeared and I could not recover Windows, so I have been using Ubuntu 10.0.4 on this system for about 2 years.\nSubsequently, Ubuntu 10.0.4 froze too many times, so I partitioned and installed Ubuntu 12.0.1.\nOnce again, GRUB 2 was automatically installed, and I could choose between UBUNTU 10 and 12 each boot up. This was fine but I never recovered my WINDOWS documents from the disappeared Windows 7 OS.\nSo recently, I installed WINDOWS 8 on a separate partition (about 20 GB), and set up a storage FAT 32 partition (for storage of files, both Ubuntu and Windows) so I don't have to reboot using the same files from different systems.\nWindows loaded fine, and detected this partition.

I have been surfing the web for days and spent 3 days and nights figuring this out and my neck is sprained and hurts. How can I access my files?\nIf this is not possible, I just want my UBUNTU back and not WINDOWS 8 cos the problem seems to have started when I installed WINDOWS 8, and I don't have files on that System OS, so I can afford to delete that.\nIdeally, I would like to be able to multi boot all three systems from GRUB LOADER, but that doesn't seem to work.

The computer is connected directly to the Baudtec modem by a LAN cable. The modem is connected to the phone jack. Under Windows, the internet works without any problems. \nUnder Ubuntu, I set up by using pppoeconf and can get online without a problem. However, after some time (about 15-20 minutes, sometimes less), the internet stops working. That is, I cannot open any website. I can still \"ping 8.8.8.8\", although \"ping www.google.com\" says \"unknown host\". Also, if I have gmail open in the browser, it may continue to work for some time, though I cannot load any other site. Also, my ISP continues to see me online, so there is no problem from their point of view.\nThe following commands do not help to restore the full connection:\npkill -9 pppd\npon dsl-provider\nHowever, they do help after powering off the modem, waiting for a little while and turning it back on again.

Inside you'll see in this example there is a profile path which defaults to default.gpfl\nSo, save your gpfl file as default.gpfl in your home directory and see if that works, if not, then change the location mentioned in the config file to where your profile file is.\n", "Q: Jack Audio ubuntu 12.10 I used to have Jack Server working with 10.10, 11.04, 11.10 but not 12.04 and now 12.10.\nI have installed jackd jackd2 qjackctl surfed many forums and even given advice of how to get jack working, but now I am stuck.\nTue Nov 27 22:30:46 2012: Saving settings to \"/home/shane/.config/jack/conf.xml\" ...\n22:31:19.960 D-BUS: JACK server could not be started.

Or you'll need a secondary audio card or interface for using with jack.\nI have a secondary USB audio interface for use with jack and the pro audio tools in my setup, and let pulseaudio keep the internal Intel audio card, for example.\nYou'll also likely want to install the linux-image-lowlatency kernel for better RT processing support with jackd.\n\nA: Try using pasuspender!

The issue that I am having now is that after replacing bootmgfw.efi with grubx64.efi and renaming, it boots directly to grub console. I dont even get a menu where i can chose ubuntu. I tried putting a grub.cfg file next to the new bootmgfw.efi(grubx64.efi), no go?\nAny ideas how i can get the renamed grubx64.efi to find all the rest of the grub stuff outside of the ESP in my linux parition?\nOr do i have to move all grub files to /EFI/Microsoft/Boot on ESP?\nThank you!\n\nA: If you're using the grubx64.efi file from Ubuntu, in theory it should be looking on your Ubuntu /boot/grub directory for its support files. If it's not finding them, then I'm not sure what's wrong. If you've built GRUB from source code or installed in some other way, though, you might need to copy all its support files, as you suggest.\nAnother alternative is to install rEFInd as EFI/Microsoft/boot/bootmgfw.efi on the ESP and leave GRUB where it is (presumably EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi). With a little extra configuration (described on the rEFInd Web page), you should even be able to bypass GRUB completely, if it's giving you problems.\nMore broadly, you may want to check out my Web page on EFI boot loaders, which includes information on boot loader installation and at least the basics of configuring all of them. (GRUB 2 is the hardest in this respect. It's only easy when the distribution installer gets it right.)\n\nA: I have found that putting grub.cfg into /EFI/ubuntu works, even when grubx64.efi is in /EFI/Boot\n\nA: *\n\n*Run Boot-Repair from a liveCD/liveUSB\n\n*Click the Recommended Repair button. (this will automatically install correct parameters for grub-efi, including SecureBoot parameters if needed, and renaming the EFI files in case the UEFI firmware is locked to Windows files). Indicate the URL that will appear if any problem.\n\n\n\n\nA: It is more correct for grubx64.efi to look for grub files as well as to be stored itself in /efi/ubuntu than /efi/boot. I had a grubx64.efi that was saying it could not find /boot on the ESP, the vfat fat32 file partition, but that's desperate. /efi/ubuntu and other custom names in /efi/* are the right way. Then you can have efibootmgr write your choice into the nvram.\nI can boot linux with rEFInd, but I need rEFInd to hand off to grubx64.efi to boot linux iso's.\nI had InsydeH20 \"open file\", grubx64.efi, and grub.cfg in /efi/ubuntu/grub would do if grubx64.efi was in /efi/linux on the ESP. Then it's off to efibootmgr to write either grubx64.efi or rEFInd to nvram.\nI have ubuntu 16.10 loading on Nextbook Ares 11.6, Intel z8500 Atom, a Cherry Trail. Touch works. Somehow I deleted my grubx64.efi. I need that to load ubuntu iso and install into internal mem. Then grubx64.efi, or in my case rEFInd, will boot directly with itself and its files stored in /efi/ubuntu or anything other than /efi/boot.\n", "Q: Battery Life-time on Acer Aspire Timeline-X 4830TG I'm running 12.04.

When I write click \"open\", all I get is read-only files like \".exe.\" The Software Center also says \"installed\". \nNo icon has appeared for Audacity. Suggestions?\nthanks. \n\nA: If you are using Unity, the default desktop environment that comes with Ubuntu, then running a program can be done as follows.\n1. Open the launcher: On the left task bar you'll see the icons for apps. The top icon is to bring up the launcher. If you want to use the keyboard instead of the mouse, use the \"Super\" button, which is also known as the \"Windows key\" between \"Control\" on the left and \"Alt\" on the left.\n2. Start your apps: Use the search feature of the launcher to search for your apps. To run LibreOffice Writer, type \"LibreOffice\" and then select the Writer option. You can also drag the icon from the launcher to the left menu bar (if it's a commonly used app).\nYou can also use the launcher to find files. On the bottom of the launcher there are a few tabs to seach \"Files,\" \"Folders,\" etc.\nSee the image below for a reference of what the launcher should look like when open.\n\n", "Q: Is there an Android remote app compatible with LibreOffice Impress under Ubuntu? I have an upcoming presentation I want to make in LibreOffice Impress on my Ubuntu 12.10 laptop. I was wondering if I could get ahold of an Android app which would act like a remote control, allowing me to switch between slides from my phone over WiFi without having to stay near the laptop (I've been told I need to move around more during my presentations).\nA quick look on the Google Play store seemed to turn up a handful of PowerPoint remote apps for Windows or maybe Mac. I also took a look at Can an Android phone control Ubuntu like a remote?, but that seems more for controlling an Ubuntu media center. Is there anything which will work with LibreOffice Impress on Ubuntu?\nMy phone is a Samsung Galaxy Precedent on Straight Talk, running Android 2.2.2 (latest available version from the carrier). It's not rooted, and there's not much memory on it either, so the smaller and simpler the app the better. Also, it has to be free because I currently don't have a means to pay for an app I may/may not like.\n\nA: You can try PPT ODP Remote Premium (2.50 €). Its description says that the server application works on Linux, too. It doesn't mention LibreOffice, only OpenOffice, but I hope they are compatible enough. But I didn't test it.\nIf you don't mind ads and a bit of ugliness, Ubuntu Remote Control works. It only needs an SSH server on the PC (and public key authentication is possible), and xdotool to send key strokes. You can edit the shortcut buttons by long pressing them.\nHave a look at the predefined \"Open Audio Player\" command:\nexport DISPLAY=:0; xdotool key XF86AudioMedia\n\nTo send a Next (Page Down) key, use\nexport DISPLAY=:0; xdotool key Next\n\nYou can assign the keys in Impress so that they match - or send the correct keys with xdotool in the first place. To find the correct key names, you can use xev in a terminal.\nThere is also Remote Launcher Free, which needs a server program on the PC. You could use it to send keystrokes with xdotool, too.\nAnd there are SSHmote and Coversal.\n\nA: As an update to the accepted answer, the LibreOffice Impress Remote app has been officialy released by the Document Foundation, and you can find it on Google Play. Requires a LibO 4.0.1, Bluetooth, and Android 2.3.3+.\n\nA: The upcoming version of LibreOffice will have integration with the official Impress remote.

That is what pulls in newer kernel versions. To install it, run \nsudo apt-get install linux-image-generic\n\nThat should install the latest available kernel, which will be used after a reboot. \nTo remove the old kernels and headers, you can run the following command, or use other ways as described in How do I remove old kernel versions:\ndpkg -l linux-* | awk '/^ii/{ print $2}' | grep -v -e `uname -r | cut -f1,2 -d\"-\"` | grep -e [0-9] | xargs sudo apt-get -y purge\n\n...and by the way, there's nothing wrong with the column on the right. \n\nA: That last number is patch level. It has nothing to do with version. \nWithout proper information I am going to say that the laptop kernels have more ubuntu specific patches then then pc kernels (not that the number is all ubuntu specific). \nBoth machines are running 2.6.32.\nSo in your example. Both machines run \nMajor 2\nMinor 6\nMicro 32\nPatch (from Debian, you, Ubuntu, Bob in accounting, random person 64) 45 or 42\nThat last number is really unimportant for comparing versions.  \n", "Q: Safari style animations Anybody know if it's possible to get mac book style animations on ubuntu?

I want to know when I will be able to install fglrx from the Ubuntu repositories and for it to work correctly? It seems to work fine on 12.04 but not 12.10 yet.\n\nA: Guess you are having the same problem I have. You can follow the bug on launchpad to see how the progress is.\nUntil it's fixed you can use the fglrx legacy driver. It's unofficial but it works fine for me. It added some fixed to the driver so it will work with the 3.5 kernel. Sadly it downgrades the XServer from 1.13 to 1.12.4.\nIf you want to try it, there is a ppa for it. You can install it from the terminal with.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:makson96/fglrx\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get install fglrx-legacy\n\n\nA: The AMD Beta drivers released on 2012-12-03 may help for 12.10, as long as you're running single monitor.\nRead this for more details\n", "Q: Creating thumbnails with the same name as the pictures Please, here is my little code for creating thumbnails of pictures saved in a folder named 'pictures', and saving them in another folder named 'thumbs'.\n#!/bin/bash\nfor i in *.jpg\ndo\nconvert -thumbnail 100 $i thumbs/$i\ndone\n\nHowever, there two things the program doesn't do:\n\n\n*\n\n*It does not retain the name of the pictures in the thumbnail. For instance, I would want it to generate a thumbnail with the name pic.jpg for a picture named pic.jpg\n\n*Also, when I run the program, i don't want it to generate the thumbnail for a picture it has already generated its thumbnail, unless that picture has been modified.\nAny help will be very much appreciated.\n\nA: According to the ImageMagick documentation,\n\nThe ImageMagick command line consists of\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*one or more required input filenames.\n  \n*zero, one, or more image settings.\n  \n*zero, one, or more image operators.\n  \n*zero, one, or more image sequence operators.\n  \n*zero, one, or more image stacks.\n  \n*zero or one output image filenames (required by convert, composite, montage, compare, import, conjure).\n  \n\nSo you need to have the original image parameter before the -thumbnail 100 command. \nTo only run convert if the file exists, you need to add an if test. \nAlso, in the for loop you have for i in *.jpg but then in the convert command you have pictures/$i. Unless I misunderstand what you're doing, these should both be the same, as I've done in my example script. If you want the thumbs directory inside the pictures directory, remove the ../ part from the convert command and if test. You will need to run this from the pictures directory, or if you don't want to, you can add cd pictures to the start of the script.\nSo, the script should be something like this:\n#! /bin/bash\n\nfor i in *.jpg; do\n    if [ \"$i\" -nt \"../thumbs/$i\" ]; then\n        convert \"$i\" -thumbnail 100 \"../thumbs/$i\";\n    fi\ndone;\n\n", "Q: ERROR: Packet source 'wlan0' failed to set channel 2: mac80211_setchannel() in Kismet and Ubuntu 12.10 I have installed Ubuntu 12.10 in my computer with an Atheros AR5007 wireless card.\nI want to use Kismet but when I run it it starts displaying the message:\nERROR: Packet source 'wlan0' failed to set channel X: mac80211_setchannel()\nIt keeps displaying the same for every channel except channel 1.

So decide to google it and find some interesting information.\nWe are causing a kernel test crash when we execute this command\necho c | sudo tee /proc/sysrq-trigger\n\nAccording to the Ubuntu documentation\n\nIf everything works, there should be some delay (depending on the\n  memory size). Then the system reboots again into the normal mode.\n  Usually apport kicks in and asks about reporting the issue.\n  Alternatively the report file can be found under /var/crash and either\n  placed somewhere else or be unpacked again by calling:\n#> apport-unpack <report file> <target directory>\n\n\nIt all depends on the memory size. I will search how much time it should take for a computer with 4GB of ram. In my case I reboot the system manually, but it was less than 2 minutes. Hope this helps.\n\nA: That's what it's supposed to do. \nIt could take a very long time for a server to dump ram, and depend on your host they may \"catch\" it and do something odd with it. My advise, \"quit messin' with it\". \nThe command triggers a kernel panic. Nothing more. All that extra stuff, is configurable and not really reliable. Your hosting provider may catch it (specially if it's something like Amazon EC2 where they build their own kernels and base images). \nYour best bet to catch a production level kernel panic is with host monitoring of some kind. I use and recommend Nagios. When the server stops responding in a production environment, a reboot is NEVER EVER EVER the answer anyway. Testing and building a protocal around this type of kernel panic handling will just cause you to fail in a most spectacular fashion.\nIf you need syslogs or crash logs look at using the remote features of syslog.\nIn short, from hosting stuff 101, if you can't afford the down time, don't rely on cheap tricks like auto-reboot, setup a proper host monitoring solution, and a cluster.\n", "Q: Sreeensaver timeout for 12.04 sever CLI I have installed 12.04LTS server edition, no GUI.

So how do I learn what App connected to the internet in the last 10 minutes or so?\nWhy is there no log report of what Apps are connecting to internet? How do I get this?\n\nA: There is no log like that. If there were it would be several gigs in size. Your best bet is to run something like iftop or nethogs neither of which is installed by default. \nIf your really, really paranoid, then you could cat /proc/net/tcp but this doesn't log.\nThere's also netstat -tapn but again that's only \"what is connected right now\".\nThen there's also this article that will tell you how to log outgoing connections via iptables.\nAgain, this is likely not that smart of an idea, the log will be huge.\n", "Q: If im using nouveau there is no way to use vdpau with it?

I've tried all the solutions I could find around the Internet but none of them work. Things I have tried include:\n\nEditing /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness\nIn /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-brightness-control.conf: Option\n  \"RegistryDwords\" \"EnableBrightnessControl=1\"\nIn /etc/default/grub: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\n  acpi_osi=Linux acpi_backlight=vendor\"\n\nThere is no xorg.conf file in 12.10 that I have found, so the solutions that suggest editing that file don't do me a whole lot of good.\nI am currently using the Nouveau driver, but switching to the Nvidia proprietary drivers made no difference.\nAny other ideas? When is this bug going to be fixed? With all the reports I've come across I would think it would get a lot of attention. Thanks.\n\nA: I had a similar problem on my thinkpad W530.  I finally found a solution here:\nhttp://blog.pearce.org.nz/2012/08/enabling-external-monitor-on-lenovo.html\n\nThese days X automatically configures itself, so you can't just edit the xorg.conf file, you instead need to add a section to a file in /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/ and X will include that section in the configuration that it automatically generates.\nSo to get the screen brightness keys working with your Nvidia graphics card, create a file in the xorg.conf.d directory, e.g:\n\nsudo gedit /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-nvidia-brightness.conf\n\n\nPaste the following into the file:\n\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier     \"Device0\"\n    Driver         \"nvidia\"\n    VendorName     \"NVIDIA Corporation\"\n    BoardName      \"Quadro K1000M\"\n    Option         \"RegistryDwords\" \"EnableBrightnessControl=1\"\nEndSection\n\n\nA: Did Ubuntu backported patches from Kernel 3.7 to 3.6?

However, when I select the Proprietary AMD Driver from the official Ubuntu repository, Unity does load. Why is Unity doing this? I had no problems with switching between these drivers in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. This started happening when I upgraded to Ubuntu 12.10.\nBefore I ever installed the propriatery AMD driver, the X.org driver loaded Unity fine, but very sluggishly. I downloaded the AMD driver from their official website and installed that first and that is what started this problem. I removed that driver and went back to X.org and X.org didn't load Unity either. Then using Synaptic, I installed the AMD driver from the Ubuntu repositories and thats what I'm using now. I'm very confused why that downloaded AMD driver would effect X.org.    \nI have a AMD Radeon HD 6620G. It's integrated graphics on my AMD A8-3500M Fusion APU (Accelerated Processing Unit as AMD advertises it). Here is a Wikipedia article on my A8 Fusion APU Here.\n\nA: This likely happens because you have a card that is not well supported by the open source drivers (which are still under a heavy state of flux in their development, especially with newer cards).\nIf Unity does not detect certain features in your driver, or encounters a bug, it will fail to load. This is why you would have to use the proprietary drivers.\nTo determine the exact problem, you can run Unity from a terminal (even on a TTY) and see what output it gives you with either driver. If it is crashing with the Open Source drivers you will most likely see \"segfault\" or something similar, and if it fails to load it will report why.\nWith this information in hand, you can then report a bug using ubuntu-bug unity, and describe what information you got on the command line output in your bug report.\n", "Q: Can't login after forced shutdown I am on ubuntu 12.04 and forced a shutdown (hardware switch).

You can find your position (though, a position nearby will do) manually using Google Maps, or similar:\n  \nTo stop it you can use\nkillall redshift\n\nFor more info, run redhsift -h.\n", "Q: How to install Neatx-Server on ubuntu 12.10?

But there is no information anywhere about how to do it in the server configuration file. So before I mess stuff up, can I safely use the same rewrite directives, like\n<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>    \n    Options +FollowSymLinks\n    RewriteEngine On\n    RewriteCond %{SCRIPT_FILENAME} !-d\n    RewriteCond %{SCRIPT_FILENAME} !-f\n    RewriteRule ^test/(\\w+)$ test.php?n=$1 [L]\n</IfModule>\n\nin /etc/apache2/apache2.conf?  /etc/apache2/httpd.conf is blank, but I suppose I could do it there too?\nAnother question, should the rewrite rule paths be prefixed with /var/www/ or can I do it relative to the site root? Thanks.\n\nA: I don't necessarily agree with their reasons for claiming you should avoid .htaccess files.  Their reasons are:\n\n*\n\n*Reason 1 is performance - Apache needs to scan directories and read and parse the .htaccess files at run time.  This isn't a huge burden and caches well.\n\n\n*Reason 2 is security. You're allowing users to modify Apache's configuration.  But they're only modifying its local configuration for that particular directory, and it's possible to specify in Apache's global configuration which directives they are and aren't allowed to modify.  Plus, if users having access to edit .htaccess files is a security problem for you, then surely also allowing the same users to use .php files is an even bigger security problem.\nThere's still some benefits to using .htaccess.  It's somewhat of a de facto standard now so much so that you can pretty much depend on being able to use it on shared hosting, and many web application software packages make use of them in their own software.  And it means that local Apache configuration is kept with the application it's configuring which might be good for backups, version control etc.\nAnyway, whether you want to heed this advice is up to you.\nIf you do want to move to using Apache's global configuration, you can do as in your example.\nHowever, the global apache2.conf file can be somewhat of a mess, and it was installed by the Apache2 package itself.  For a more portable solution, put your rules into individual config files:\n\n*\n\n*Apache2 reads all config files in /etc/apache2/conf.d/.  This can be good for any general configuration directives you want to add that don't relate to any particular virtual host.  Just add a new file there and put config into it.\n\n\n*Apache2 stores config files for each virtual host in /etc/apache2/sites-available/.  That is a suggested place for putting in configuration for each virtual host, in separate files.  Then, enable and disable these virtual hosts with a2ensite and a2dissite.\nAssuming that these configuration directives apply specifically apply to a certain virtual host I'd choose the latter - put it in where-ever you've put the configuration for that virtual host (which I'd recommend placing in /etc/apache2/sites-available/.\n", "Q: Nautilus suddenly looks different after a restart Nautilus now looks different, and I don't like it.

Chances are you added the gnome3 ppa, which has this version of nautilus.\nYou should check if your icon pack has an upgrade for nautilus 3.6, or you can purge the gnome3 ppa.\nIf you have installed the gnome3 PPA, these are commands to restore old Nautilus:\n$ sudo apt-get install ppa-purge\n$ sudo ppa-purge ppa:gnome3-team/gnome3\n\n", "Q: Will Ubuntu remove vnc in favor of freenx? I haved tried out some of the remote control options and to me VNC feels old and slow.  Is there any chance Ubuntu will work with NX Server and bundle FreeNX and completely remove VNC as a core product. \nBecause it installs standard it gives the suggestion of being a relevant product but as most people replace it, I don't think it merits inclusion in the base install. Unless it's predetermined that Android will be replacing Gnome and Unity, fixing this remote tools issue seems like time well spent. Increases usability and exstends the OS family. Phone, tablet, laptop, workstation, server.\n\nA: While freenx will work on Ubuntu, and there are 3rd party packages for it, Ubuntu will not switch to it. It's too young a technology and too much under control of one closed source company. VNC is much wider supported and despite its speed drawbacks much more reliable and used much more than freenx.\n\nA: VNC and NX are totally different protocols. Therefore, you can't just drop support for one for the reason one being superior over the other in your use case.\nAnalogously, just because IMAP provides more features, mail user agents won't just drop POP3 support.\nWhen it comes to implementations to protocols, usually coming in libraries, Ubuntu can decide which one is 'better' and to choose as the default or even drop one of them. However, most applications will just break if the library implementation changes (unless it's ABI-compatible of course).\nPlease remember that you can't say\n\n[...] VNC as a core product [...]\n\nBecause it isn't one.\n", "Q: network is disabled I could successfully connect to network through livecd but through my hard disk it is not possible.\n:~$ sudo ifup eth0\nifup: interface eth0 already configured\n\n:~$ sudo lshw -class network\n  *-network DISABLED      \n       description: Ethernet interface\n       product: RTL8101E/RTL8102E PCI Express Fast Ethernet controller\n       vendor: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.\n       physical id: 0\n       bus info: pci@0000:02:00.0\n       logical name: eth0\n       version: 05\n       serial: ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff\n       size: 100Mbit/s\n       capacity: 100Mbit/s\n       width: 64 bits\n       clock: 33MHz\n       capabilities: pm msi pciexpress msix vpd bus_master cap_list ethernet physical tp mii 10bt 10bt-fd 100bt 100bt-fd autonegotiation\n       configuration: autonegotiation=on broadcast=yes driver=r8169 driverversion=2.3LK-NAPI duplex=full latency=0 link=no multicast=yes port=MII speed=100Mbit/s\n       resources: irq:40 ioport:e000(size=256) memory:f0004000-f0004fff memory:f0000000-f0003fff\n\n:~$ sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart\n * Running /etc/init.d/networking restart is deprecated because it may not enable again some interfaces\n * Reconfiguring network interfaces...

However you can run dpkg -I package.deb to list the dependencies. Then you will need to download all those packages (that are not currently installed). Those packages could (and likely will) have more dependencies. Just rinse and repeat till you find them all. \nYou can also do this by looking though a site like this one and downloading all dependencies. \nThis is going to be a giant PIA and the the primary reason things like apt exist, but this will get you up and running, after a fashion.\n\nA: Install the package on another Ubuntu 12.04 machine (preferably a fairly minimal install). Then you should find all the dependencies needed to install it, in /var/cache/apt/archives on this machine.\n\nA: M2Crypto is available both from PyPI and in addition for Ubuntu as package \"python-m2crypto\". In your case (offline, no apparent desire for Python virtual envs), I suggest to install the \"python-m2crypto\" package.\nYou can find Ubuntu package information including dependencies on http://packages.ubuntu.com. At this point, the site does not have the information for Ubuntu 10 anymore. For Ubuntu 12, the information for the \"python-m2crypto\" package is on http://packages.ubuntu.com/precise/python-m2crypto.\nYou can then download the packages you don't have yet (\"python-m2crypto\" and its dependent packages you don't have yet, resolving dependencies recursively) from there in .deb format, transport the .deb files to your offline machine, and install them there using:\ndpkg -i <deb-file>\n\n", "Q: Is there a graphical pager with syntax highlighting?

If you go to edit > preferences > keybindings there are a massive number of options, and, according to the FAQ, geany uses standard GTK+ keybindings. Virtually every action in the editor can be assigned to a key, so I think you will be able to set it up as you wish.\nIn the screenshot below, I have opened a python script (originally from this site) in which I am trying to fix a problem in the way it parses ustream urls. As you can see, both syntax highlighting and some code suggestion/completion is built into the program:\n\n\nA: i really really really like geany, however it doesnt really provide the kind of answer you're looking for. iSeth's suggestion is close to the best in my opinion, but doesnt really tell you how to use it. you may have already figured it out, but like most applications, vim accepts in put from STDIN, so you can pipe supported source files to it.

Unfortunately kdm (neither lightdm) doesn't show up after boot. I found several posts describing errors due to the migration from kdm to lightdm. Some sugest reinstallation of kdm. Therefore I logged into a shell and tried to install it using apt-get. However it turned out that network is not available. ifconfig showes that only the loopback device lo is available. What can I do to get lan or wlan network working on the commandline? I relized that grub still runs the old tuxonice kernel which I installed from ppa. Is it possible that the installation didn't finish and left me in an inkonsistent state in which the kernel version does not match the modules? How can I proceed the installation from the downloaded packages?\n\nA: The upgrade entailed several different problems which I finally managed to fix:\nThe upgrade was incomplete. Important packages including the new kernel where not even downloaded. This left the system in an inconsistent state. It was possible to boot the system with one of the old kernels. On a different system I downloaded the kernel packages\nlinux-generic\nlinux-image-generic\n\nfrom http://packages.ubuntu.com/ and saved them on USB storage.\nI mounted the storage from the command line\nsudo mount -t ext3 /dev/sdb1/ mountpoint\n\nand installed them using\ndpkg --force-all -i mountpoint/linux-*\n\nI booted the new kernel and got the network working which appeared in\nsudo lshw -C network\n\nas DISABLED.

However only upon\nsudo dhclient eth0\n\neth0 appeared in the ifconfig list and in sudo lshw -C network. As I could connect to the internet now I fixed the upgrade with\nsudo apt-get -f upgrade\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nI had to install several blocked packages with sudo apt-get install [packagename]. And individual ones (in particular one calligra package) with dpkg -i /var/cache/apt/archives/[package] as they had conflicts (common files with different package). \nFinally I could boot the complete system but the login manager lightdm still didn't work. Lightdm shows (this is a known bug) a message \"low graphics mode\".

To be precise I do a lot of Maple, Matlab, Geogebra & for all of those I install Java platform which too isnt very straightforward plus the license management things, which really give me craps. \nI don't install application in /home (to be made available to all users) thus a separate /home partition is meaningless. Can we circumvent this problem somehow such that Java dependent applications along with JDK doesn't blow away after update, may be by a separate partition (just like /home) where only custom (other than provided by Ubuntu Software Center) install application resides\nFurther: I use specific binary of Java (Java6 update 32), its an important requirement for me, thus I don't want to let it crash/overwritten or similar\n\nA: A common solution for this is to install specific software under /opt or /usr/local and add a separate partition for that directory.\n\nA: An upgrade of Ubuntu should leave any third-party applications installed and functional, with the caveat that if they depend on specific versions of libraries, upgrades to them could cause problems. If, OTOH, you do a fresh installation, you'll have problems unless you install your third-party applications to a separate partition that you do not erase. Conventionally, /opt is used for this purpose; /usr/local is supposed to be used for locally-compiled programs -- that is, programs written in C, C++, or other compiled languages that you download and compile yourself. Java doesn't qualify; Java programs would normally go in /opt if not installed via the package system.\nThe main problem with an upgrade rather than a wipe-and-reinstall is that upgrades sometimes don't work right; things sometimes get confused and leave the system unstable or unbootable. When they go right, though, upgrades are very convenient because they preserve most of your customizations. Thus, it may be worth setting aside separate /opt and/or /usr/local partitions in which you store third-party programs but also attempt an upgrade. If the upgrade fails, you can install fresh while telling the installer to not create new filesystems on your set-aside partition(s).\n", "Q: Internet connection lost for browser but still there for transmission I brought Dell Inspiron N5050 few months back. from day 1 i am getting problem with wired connection, i am able to use web browser for few minutes then all of the sudden i lost internet connection but i don't know why transmission is still able to download torrent from internet. today i installed steadyflow download manager and i see it is also downloading fine but beside these everything fails to connect to internet.\n\none more thing internet connection is recovered automatically after few minutes.

Its effect would be to surpress the exit status of gvim, yet I can't think of any reason why you'd want to do that except on a case by case basis. Anyway,I think the simplest thing is to use an alias:\nalias gvim='gvim -f'\n\nYou could also use the function:\ngvim() {\n  command gvim -f \"$@\"\n}\n\nThese two ways are equivalent.\nAs to the name of your function or alias, I don't quite agree with Mik. If you plan to normally call gvim in the way you mentioned, I see no harm in doing what you're doing. If you ever need the default behavior, you can easily use the command prefix. In fact, I've written a few wrapper scripts that are placed earlier on the path and completely override the system program.

For permission 655, mask will be 122 (i.e: for permission xyz mask will be (777-xyz)).\n\nWhat is umask,dmask, and fmask?\n\n\n*\n\n*umask = user mask (folder and directory!)\n\n*dmask = directory only mask\n\n*fmask = file only mask\n\n\nHow To Set Executable Permission for NTFS Partition files?\nRun this command to get UUID (Universally Unique IDentifier) for every NTFS drive:\n\n$ sudo blkid\n\nYou will get output like this:\n/dev/sda6: LABEL=\"Software\" UUID=\"FEDC5DB5DC5D6943\" TYPE=\"ntfs\" \n/dev/sda7: LABEL=\"Works\" UUID=\"585AD06A35149024\" TYPE=\"ntfs\" \n\nNow edit the fstab file:\n$ sudo vim /etc/fstab\n\nIn the fstab file add/edit every drive specifying line with the following options (remember to use other option carefully, as adding any other option may cause problem):\ndefaults,auto,umask=002 \n\nSo after edit/adding nfts drives your portion of fstab file will look something like this:\n#<file system>           <mount point>   <type>  <options>                  <dump>  <pass>\nUUID=FEDC5DB5DC5D6943   /media/software   ntfs    defaults,auto,umask=002      0      0\nUUID=585AD06A35149024   /media/works      ntfs    defaults,auto,umask=002      0      0\n\nAbove umask will set permission equal 775, i.e read-write-execute for admin user (that is you) and admin user group and read-write permission for other users.\nFor samba share you might need to use gid=YourGroupID,uid=YourUserID in the option set. You can find YourGroupID and YourUserID values using the following command:\n$ id YourUserName\n\nNow Unmount your drives if already mounted:\n$ sudo umount -a\n\nThen mount by this command:\n$ sudo mount -a\n\nAfter mount you can use the drives in whatever way you want.\n", "Q: vim is not remembering last position My Ubuntu LTS 12.04 has vim editor. If I open a file, move to a paragraph and reopen vim, then the cursor goes to beginning of the file always. \nThis is not the expected behavior.  How the vim can remember last read position after closing a file?\nI tried vi also, but the result is the same.  \n\nA: I had this same problem and it turned out that the .viminfo file in my home directory had the wrong ownership.  It was owned by root:root.  \nOnce I fixed the file ownership by changing it to myself, remembering file position started working for me again\n\nA: I think this wiki posting may provide a solution. I don't believe restoring the position is the expected behavior. http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Restore_cursor_to_file_position_in_previous_editing_session\n\nA: Good convention is to create your own .vimrc file in your $HOME directory, and include this line which will cause Vim to jump to the last known position in a previously edited file.\nIn $HOME/.vimrc, add the following lines:\n\" Reopen the last edited position in files\nau BufReadPost * if line(\"'\\\"\") > 1 && line(\"'\\\"\") <= line(\"$\") | exe \"normal! g'\\\"\" | endif\n\nThere is no need to edit the system-wide file /etc/vim/vimrc.\nCreating and using your own .vimrc in your $HOME directory is also better for maintainability. The system vimrc configuration file could be updated when the Vim application package gets an update next time, or edited by someone else. Your own file in your own home-directory will be honored when you run Vim.\nI actually recommend you look into all the great things you can do with your own .vimrc file. I have mine configured with tons of useful options and even a few custom functions.\n\nA: There is a plugin called vim-lastplace (I am the author) that will open your files where you left off. It improves on the above suggestions by ignoring commit messages because you're typically editing a new message and want to start at the top of the commit message file.\n\nA: The file /etc/vim/vimrc already contains necessary feature. Just need to uncomment it:\n\" Uncomment the following to have Vim jump to the last position when\n\" reopening a file\nif has(\"autocmd\")\n  au BufReadPost * if line(\"'\\\"\") > 1 && line(\"'\\\"\") <= line(\"$\") | exe \"normal! g'\\\"\" | endif\nendif\n\n(Infact, you can refer to /usr/share/vim/vim73/vimrc_example.vim also)\n\nA: In my case, vi was a symlink: /usr/bin/vi -> /etc/alternatives/vi -> /usr/bin/vim.tiny. The latter has no real vim features. Installing the package 'vim' (using synaptic or apt-get) made this symlink point to /usr/bin/vim.basic, and this fixed the issue.\n\nA: In my case was that I had copied my .vimrc from another machine.\nThis was the offending line.\nset viminfo='10,\\\"100,:20,%,n~/.viminfo\n\nMy problem was that because I use different systems, ie. cygwin, wsl2, linux etc...\nI had copied it from a cygwin install and it had looked something like this\nset viminfo='10,\\\"100,:20,%,n/mnt/c/cygwin/.viminfo\n\nwhich is obviously not correct for my linux install.\nModding it to look like the first example above fixed my problem.\n\nA: There is a mistake in Lunar Mushrooms solution. Here the correction:\nif has(\"autocmd\")\n  \" When editing a file, always jump to the last known cursor position.\n  \" Don't do it when the position is invalid or when inside an event handler\n  \" (happens when dropping a file on gvim).\n  \" Also don't do it when the mark is in the first line, that is the default\n  \" position when opening a file.\n  autocmd BufReadPost *\n    \\ if line(\"'\\\"\") > 1 && line(\"'\\\"\") <= line(\"$\") |\n    \\   exe \"normal! g`\\\"\" |\n    \\ endif\n\nendif\n\n\nA: The last edit information is stored at .viminfo.\nls -l ~/.viminfo\n\nIf it hasn't a read mod for your user, just change it.\nsudo chmod 666 ~/.viminfo\n\n", "Q: Does anyone know how to make nautilus as a file manager in Xubuntu 12.04?

Installing something manually into /usr/local with a make or install script should be something done only when you have a specific reason to do so and you have a greater level of technical skill and knowledge, and willingness to set it up correctly yourself. You'll also need to do updates and security patches manually because it won't be done by Ubuntu.\nBased on your level of technical knowledge of Ubuntu I don't think installing something manually into /usr/local is for you.  Unless you respond with a good reason for not being able to use the one included with Ubuntu and you really want to learn more, I'd advise removing that MySQL and installing the Ubuntu one with sudo apt-get install mysql-server.\nAfter doing this, you'll be able to follow all the normal instructions you find on the Ubuntu wikis and howtos.\n\nA: try the following:\nquit;\nthis worked for me...then i just got the msg: \"bye\". then it was showing again to enter a comand as the USER@user>, not as MYSQL>.

Those two are defined as different services in avahi. To make that work, i have to disable avahi's dbus api, or else netatalk tends to take over all the services (osx prefers afp over smb).\nIf I now try to start forked-daapd, it just doesn't. Forked-daapd requires avahi's dbus api to be enabled and running. Is there some sort of way around this limitation, so that i can manually define my own daap service in avahi.\nMaybe something like enabling but ignoring the dbus in avahi, or launching a duplicate avahi daemon with a different config file?\n\nA: Ok, eventually this was really easy. There is an option -nozeroconf in /etc/afpd.conf, which disables advertising afp shares through avahi's dbus interface. This way, I could turn avahi's dbus interface back on without afp taking over all my shares. Now I can start forked-daapd correctly.\n", "Q: How to create AppIndicator with Python?

Google installs a script and not a config file into /etc/, which is against best practice (or otherwise you wouldn't get a warning message).\nWhat this specific script is doing is checking whether the Google's repository has been disabled by upgrading between releases and if so re-enables it (this is based on very basic skimming of the code of the script /etc/cron.daily/google-musicmanager).\nIt installs fine and the permission of the script are also set correctly, so you can probably just ignore the warning message as long as you are okay with the fact that Google adds a repository for the google-music-manager and runs said script every day once.

I see that I can replace this with a custom key binding, but it overwrites the \"audio next\" shortcut.  \nI'd like a solution that allows me to map a second shortcut to this command without overwriting it.  I see that I can define custom keys, so I could make a unique mapping for rhythmbox-client --next, etc, but that would be a solution specific to rhythmbox.  I'm looking for a more native Ubuntu solution that will work in any player the same way the current \"audio next\" media keys do on my external keyboard.

The internal hard drive of the laptop went bad, that is why I am using the external one.\nI have a USB mouse and keyboard but it is not being recognized. Is this due to the fact that I am running it on the external hard drive? If not, is there a way of fixing this issue?\n\nA: Technically, running a hard drive, keyboard and mouse should all be possible. However with the root file system on the USB hard drive it is conceivable that there is to much traffic across the bus and the mouse and keyboard are not being detected properly. Usually this happens when running silly-massive amounts of data like 4 printers and 6 web cams. The hard drive should not be transferring that much, but it is possible.\nAll that said, you are in should work land so...\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure your using a powered USB hub (not direct to computer, or unpowered hub). A hard drive can require a lot of power, specially if it's the kind that draws it's power from usb.\n\n*Try to use different \"controllers\" for the hard drive and the input devices. On a laptop that can be kind of tricky, and you really just need to move the connections around.\n\n*Unplug the mouse, then run tail -f /var/log/syslog plug the mouse in, watch for errors. If nothing happens at all, you likely have a hardware issue (either real, or you just have \"too much\" happening on that bus and the BIOS isn't passing up events/data.) If something does show up you should get a error message that tells you why it isn't working.\n\n*Try running lsusb and see if your devices are listed. If they are they should be working, if not, then you have a kernel (or hardware) level problem.\n\n*Try a live CD. Do they work there? If so, your down to your configuration, if not, then your back to hardware or unsupported devices.\n\n", "Q: Best collaborative task manager for Ubuntu and Android?

On an embedded system with a very limited disk space I have the folder /var/cache/apt full with some 700MB of srcpkgcache.bin.* and a couple of large *.bin files.\nPerforming sudo apt-get clean did not make a visible difference.\nIs it safe to manually delete these *.bin* files?\n\nA: You can of course delete pkgcache.bin and srcpkgcache.bin, nothing happens. Just run apt-get update to re-create them.\n\nA: Not really. Those files help your system determine what is available and what isn't. Emptying that directory will result in a broken apt-get system. Here are a couple of tips. \nFirst, auto clean\nadd a\nDPkg::Post-Invoke { \"apt-get clean\"; };\n\nto the end of /etc/apt/apt.conf. It will make apt and dpkg processes take longer, but will make it so your cache directory is always clean.\nNext, Remove archives\nStart by removing and disabling all source archives (that your not using). On an embedded system you likely don't need them. Next remove all the archives that are not in use. You can run apt-cache policy to figure out what repo a package is coming from if your not sure.\nMore Removal of archives\nSome PPAs are horrid about having huge number of packages in them when you only need 1 or 2. Try disabling those PPAs and just installing the deb files manually. You save space in those cases, but you loose auto update.  Keep in mind that dpkg will handle dependencies, so you can still install thing-with-tons-of-deps.deb then run apt-get -f install to fetch the dependencies.\nTotally Extreme Answer 1\nBecause were talking about an embedded system, 90% of the main repos won't do you any good. To handel this you could run your own apt-get repo server See this link. It's not easy, and it's a PIA for just one machine. But if you have several of these machines it's totally worth it. (You apt repo server can host just a subset of packages that you actually use. You don't need to mirror the whole thing)\nTotally Extreme Answer 2\nIf space is really that large of an issue, then you can disable apt all together and revert to manually installing via dpkg. I have had to do this on several embedded systems. It works, but it's an admin nightmare. \n\nA: Keep the pkgcache.bin and srcpkgcache.bin, you can safely delete the others. Don't touch the directories!\n\nA: You can of course create a NFS-share (network filesystem) for this. Leave these files on a server and mount the share only when you want to update/install packages. In embedded environments, the installation will usually be relatively static anyway.\nsshfs is another good option, is much easier to set up (basically only requires SSH which is standard), but it has more overhead (slower). \n", "Q: Deleted windows partition, now I can't get into Ubuntu Back story: I installed ubuntu with wubi. I had windows on one NTFS partition, then I made a new NTFS partition in which I put wubi in and where My ubuntu OS was born. Eventually I moved /home into another partition and made a swap partition, but I digress.\nI deleted My original NTFS partition where windows is not thinking it would not matter but now I can't get into ubuntu. And the weird thing is that when I boot my computer I still see the option to boot into both windows and ubuntu. When I try to boot into windows, It tries to fix stuff and never succeds. When I try to boot into ubuntu, it shows me \"cannot find GRLDR in all devices. Press CTRL+ALT+DELETE to restart\". \nso, what do you guys think? I just want ubuntu running again, with all my stuff in /home there and all my system preferences how I like them.\nEDIT: Boot Repair disk did its thing but it did not fix anything. I think I will be installing ubuntu from cd then transferring /home and such manually.\n\nA: This is what happened:\nWubi uses the Windows boot manager to load it, even if it's on a separate partition.  So by deleting your Windows partition, you have deleted the \"pointer\" that tells your computer where to look for the Wubi install.  Now, I in all fairness don't know that much about Wubi (how exactly it is booted) so I can't tell you the exact steps.\nThere is almost certainly a better way to do this.  Wubi stores your OS in a virtual hard disk file.  It's possible that it could be extracted to a separate partition and booted.  BUT that's a little complex and you might run into some issues because of the way it's set up.  So, here's something you can do:\nBoot up an Ubuntu LiveCD or USB that is the same architecture (32- or 64-bit) and version as your Wubi install.  (I assume you already know how to do this, but just in case you didn't use the LiveCD earlier run sudo gparted to edit partitions easily).  Tell it to look for a lost partition or partitions.  As long as you have not written to the space where it was, your data will still be there.  Now, you can run Startup repair for Windows to automatically restore the boot sector of the partition, and voila!  You should be able to boot your Wubi install once again.\nIf you have written to the partition space, try making a new NTFS partition with the same size and dimensions of the previous one and running file recovery.  For instance:\nBoot up Hiren's Boot CD and start the Windows XP option.  Then, install Piriform's Recuva and look for C:\\boot.ini.  Once you have that copied to a flash drive, install Windows again and copy that file over the new boot.ini.  You should be able to start up your Wubi install again.\nSee the Ubuntu community wiki on data recovery for more information\n\nA: Basically you erased your boot partition with the boot information. So you need to reinstall those boot informations.\nFollow the 4 Steps under \"The graphical way\" here and you should be good:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows\nAs long as it works this should be the easiest method to restore your boot-chain.\nPlease report back if it worked or not.\nGood Luck.\n\nA: I think you're screwed. I think you deleted the files needed to boot Linux. There is good news, I could be wrong.\nGive Boot-Repair a try. It might work.\nYou will likely be better off re installing Linux on a native (ext4 is a good choice) filesystem. 90% of your settings are in /home so as long as you don't delete that partition everything should just come back where you left it. You might have to reinstall some packages.\nBoot to a liveCD and seeing if you can still access your files. Then copy those files (in /home/user and /etc) to a external drive. Next, repartition, format, install, and finally copy everything back in /home/user. Leave /etc alone in the beginning. Only copy back what you need to have there. \n\nA: Wubi uses Grub4dos to boot. Usually grub4dos is grldr.mbr and grldr. The first bit is small as it is a bootloader and the second bit contains the code that won't fit into the MBR. With Wubi it uses wubildr.mbr and wubildr. These are the same as the grldr* files but renamed.\nWhat you are seeing is wubildr.mbr looking for wubildr on all partitions, and then after not finding it, it issues the message \"ERROR: Cannot find GRLDR in all devices: Press ctrl+alt+delete to restart\". That's an unfortunate hardcoded message that should read \"ERROR: Cannot find WUBILDR in all devices: Press ctrl+alt+delete to restart\". So you probably deleted the C: partition and the C:\\wubildr that was there. Just copy it (there's a wubildr in the \\ubuntu\\winboot directory) into the root of any partition and it should work again.\n", "Q: Force All Windows To Open At A Set Resolution ('width x height' pixels) Is it possible to force all application windows to open at a specific resolution (i.e. a set specific size like 1280x720 pixels)?\n\nA: Yes, though it doesn't work very well. \n\n\n*\n\n*Install ccsm, sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager (note ccsm is pretty buggy).\n\n*Start ccsm, go to the window management section\n\n*Enable \"Window Rules\"\n\n*In the options for \"Window Rules\", choose the \"Size rules\" tab\n\n*Click new, then the +\n\n*Choose your window (by class is usually best but it takes some experementing)\n\n*Set your width and height.\n\n*Apply everything and enjoy your fixed window heights.\n\n", "Q: lm-sensors shows only 1 core temp On intel atom machine, is this perfectly normal?

But then it turns out that it isn't actually Matlab, but some support package for it, and I when I try to remove it, it opens a new window asking for the directory of Matlab. I can't close it except by force, and every time I try to install a new app, it appears, and prevents the app from installing. \nI've searched around Google, and lots of forums, but no answer related to this app, only the actual Matlab. I tried searching for the app in File System, and deleted the Matlab.desktop and still the problem didn't go away. This app has no actual directory in the file system, and it is quite annoying. Even when I tried app update, it appears after the download has finished, thus preventing the installation.\nNow I could try to install the actual Matlab, which I'm currently downloading, but it takes too much space, and I barely have that space, because I've dual booted with Windows 7 and I have only 18 GB for Ubuntu and the rest of the 400 GB Windows.\nHas anyone faced this problem before, and does anyone know how to fix this?\n\nA: Just run \nsudo apt-get purge matlab-support\n\nThis command will purge matlab-support and fix your problems.\n\nA: Okay, when you have a problem like this, where you can't remove an application via the Ubuntu Software Center, the best way (IMHO) is to purge it via the terminal. Don't worry, it actually isn't that hard :)\nFirst, you need to find the package name. This can be done by either looking at the \"Version\" property of an application in the Ubuntu Software Center (the first part, not the second), or you can search for it in the terminal, like so (replacing Package Name by Matlab, in your case):\nsudo apt-cache search Package Name\n\nand find the most relevant package name (you might find a couple, and if that is the case, use them all for the next step)\nNext, you have to remove the offending package(s). To do so, run this command:\nsudo apt-get purge pkg1 pkg2 pkg3\n\nLet's say, for example, you installed freemat (a version of matlab, I am not sure if this is what you installed or not though), you would type this in:\nsudo apt-get purge freemat\n\nHope this helps!\n\nEDIT: I re-read your problem, and it's actually caused by a failed installation of Matlab. The steps above should fix it :)\n", "Q: Ubuntu Server 10.04 behind proxy.

But I found this page, and using the ideas there I could bring my inode count down from 100% to about 50% quickly: http://www.pkdavies.co.uk/142-dpkg-no-space-left-on-device.html\nThe idea is, basically to locate the folders which are eating up inodes.\nIn a terminal, cd to root to start:\n# cd /\n\nThen search for the folders eating up most inodes:\n# for i in `ls -1A`; do echo \"`find $i | sort -u | wc -l` $i\"; done | sort -rn | head -20\n\nThat will give you a list of folders.\nFollow the above steps again to cd into the folder with the highest count of inodes, and run the search command again.\nI found lots of unused and uninstalled kernels which still took up space and inodes in the kernel sources folders, for example under /usr/src/linux-headers-*.\nBEWARE, DO NOT REMOVE THE SOURCES FOR THE INSTALLED KERNEL --- CHECK OUT WITH uname -rv WHICH ONE THAT IS\nTherefore, after I found the folders, I removed the obsolete directories one at a time, for example with\nroot@gamma:/usr/src# sudo rm -rf linux-headers-3.2.0-30\n\nAfter this I could run this successfully to repair my system:\n# apt-get -f install\n\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 // Likewise Open // Unable to ever authenticate AD users So Ubuntu 12.04, Likewise latest from the beyondtrust website.\n\n\n*\n\n*Joins domain fine.\n\n*Gets proper information from lw-get-status.\n\n*Can use lw-find-user-by-name to retrieve/locate users.\n\n*Can use lw-enum-users to get all users.\n\n\nAttempting to login with an AD user via SSH generates the following errors in the auth.log file:\nNov 28 19:15:45 hostname sshd[2745]: PAM unable to dlopen(pam_winbind.so): /lib/security/pam_winbind.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\nNov 28 19:15:45 hostname sshd[2745]: PAM adding faulty module: pam_winbind.so\nNov 28 19:15:51 hostname sshd[2745]: error: PAM: Authentication service cannot retrieve authentication info for DOMAIN\\\\user.name from remote.hostname\nNov 28 19:16:06 hostname sshd[2745]: Connection closed by 10.1.1.84 [preauth]\n\nAttempting to login via the LightDM itself generates similar errors in the auth.log file.\nNov 28 19:19:29 hostname lightdm: PAM unable to dlopen(pam_winbind.so): /lib/security/pam_winbind.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\nNov 28 19:19:29 hostname lightdm: PAM adding faulty module: pam_winbind.so\nNov 28 19:19:47 hostname lightdm: pam_succeed_if(lightdm:auth): requirement \"user ingroup nopasswdlogin\" not met by user \"DOMAIN\\user.name\"\nNov 28 19:19:52 hostname lightdm: [lsass-pam] [module:pam_lsass]pam_sm_authenticate error [login:DOMAIN\\user.name][error code:40022]\nNov 28 19:19:54 hostname lightdm: PAM unable to dlopen(pam_winbind.so): /lib/security/pam_winbind.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\nNov 28 19:19:54 hostname lightdm: PAM adding faulty module: pam_winbind.so\n\nAttempting to login via a console on the system itself generates slightly different errors:\nNov 28 19:31:09 hostname login[997]: PAM unable to dlopen(pam_winbind.so): /lib/security/pam_winbind.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\nNov 28 19:31:09 hostname login[997]: PAM adding faulty module: pam_winbind.so\nNov 28 19:31:11 hostname login[997]: [lsass-pam] [module:pam_lsass]pam_sm_authenticate error [login:DOMAIN\\user.name][error code:40022]\nNov 28 19:31:14 hostname login[997]: FAILED LOGIN (1) on '/dev/tty2' FOR 'DOMAIN\\user.name', Authentication service cannot retrieve authentication info\nNov 28 19:31:31 hostname login[997]: FAILED LOGIN (2) on '/dev/tty2' FOR 'DOMAIN\\user.name', Authentication service cannot retrieve authentication info\n\nI am baffled.

Can I use the installer to install Ubuntu and then go and delete Windows Vista while I'm running Ubuntu?\n\nA: The Windows Installer (WUBI) avoids partitioning the hard drive by creating a virtual partition as a big file inside the Windows partition. It also allows uninstalling Ubuntu in the same way one would uninstall a Windows application. \nAn WUBI install of Ubuntu depends on components of Windows for (a) installation, (b) during booting to Ubuntu, (c) and for uninstallation. \nSo if you erase (or uninstall) Windows after installing Ubuntu using WUBI, then Ubuntu will not work.\nSolution:\nCreate a Live USB/DVD and boot from it.

Which partitions? I have a few questions regarding installation. I have a 500g HD on my laptop. I dont intend on dual-booting on this thing. I intend you use it for development. I decided to get back into programming after a decade, java, android apps, basically open source stuff. All I intend to have on this laptop is Ubuntu,eclipse and whatever else  imay need for development. I would like to have some space on my disk that can be access from my Windows7 box. There will more than likely be mp3's, video and PDF/eBooks on it. So , i guess what I need to know is\nhow much space i should use for ubuntu.\nwhich partitions should i create. should I let ubuntu only create the default 2, or should i customize the install using the info in the \"The Directory Tree\" section in the Ubuntu Install/Partitioning Guide \nAny advice would be greatly appreciated\nThanks, Mike\n\nA: Simple solution is the best\nJust use the default settings of Ubuntu install, at let use the full drive and do its partitioning.\nYou will get one huge / partition and a swap partition. This gives the most flexibility. Your application development data will reside in the subfolders of /home/[user]/ folder. It can grow as big as you need it to be. Your mp3, video, PDF etc. will also be in subfolders of /home/[user]/. \nSharing files with Windows\nI assume you want to share your files with a different Windows box in the local network. Samba is the best way to do it. just right click on the folder you want to share (such as Music) and select share... This will install Samba and anything else you may need. Installing Samba will also allow you to read and write to shared folders in the Windows box.\nFile ownership/ permissions work differently in Windows and Ubuntu and they do not translate well when files reside in FAT32 or NTFS partitions. Since there will be no Windows installation in the Ubuntu laptop, there is no advantage in making FAT32 / NTFS partitions onto which Ubuntu cannot write file permission information. \nIn the early versions of Ubuntu there were two options to upgrade. (a) upgrade directly from the existing installation. (b) Fresh install from Live DVD/USB. The first preserved the personal settings, and data, the second wiped everyting. \nNew versions of Ubuntu offers a third (c) choice of upgrading from Live DVD/USB. This preserves the /homefolder combing the best of (a) and (b). This also means creating a separate /home partition is not that important if you need to overwrite your Ubuntu installation.\nMultiple partitions keep program and user data separate (Use your own settings)\nChoosing Something Else during Ubuntu installation allows you to setup multiple partitions to your own liking. It also makes you decide the size of each partition.\nI prefer a three partition setup:\n/ to keep the OS and all the applications as well as any web server data (If you do web development). 46-48GB.\n/home to keep all the user data, including music, application development etc. 450GB\nSwap can be 2-4GB, just to keep Ubuntu happy.\nThis gives you the flexibility to reformat / and reinstall Ubuntu if you ever need to do it. Though it is not essential as new versions of Ubuntu gives the option to preserve /home even when it is not a separate partition, during upgrade/reinstall from Live USB/DVD.\nIf you delve into web development, you may want to make / larger, as the web server data will go there.  You don't have to figure out how much to / and how much to /home if you go with the default installation and keep a single / partition.\nHope this helps\n\nA: If your not going to dual boot and your not going to access the drive via windows then just use one big ext4 partition (/). You can still access files on the drive via cifs (file sharing), ftp, ssh, or any number of protocols from other windows boxes. \nIf your going to directly access the drive from windows then the \"shared\" partition should probably be FAT32. This will give you the best experience when sharing the data. \nUbuntu can safely fit, fully running with TONS of apps in under 100 Gig. Personally I don't like to limit my self like that so I would recommend one of two things. \nSingle Partition\nCreate a single 500 Gig partition. Share files via file sharing software like cifs, ubuntu one, dropbox, ftp, etc. \nMulti-Partition\nCreate a primary partition for Linux that is 400 Gigs and a 100 Gig partition for \"shared files\". \nDon't over think\nJust make the Shared partition as big as you think you will need and use the rest for the Linux partition.

Especially about file extensions :)\nIt's hard to tell whether this is a developer's fault without more info. It looks like you're running something that didn't come as a package that's part of Ubuntu. This could be statically or dynamically linked against some libraries.\nYou can find out by running:\nfile /path/to/the/file.x86\nif this is script as opposed to a binary, you need to find what's the actual binary it executes by looking at it.\nThis is important since \"statically\" means you probably don't have to install any dependencies to be able to run it. Dynamically means that your system needs to have certain libraries installed before you can run the binary.\nIf it's a binary, you can find out if it's a dynamically or statically linked by running\nldd /path/to/the/file.x86 \nExample of a dynamically linked binary:\n ldd /bin/bash\n    linux-vdso.so.1 =>  (0x00007fff631ff000)\n    libtinfo.so.5 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libtinfo.so.5 (0x00007fed8fe35000)\n    libdl.so.2 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2 (0x00007fed8fc31000)\n    libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007fed8f871000)\n    /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007fed90082000)\n\nWhile a statically linked binary would show something along the lines:\nnot a dynamic executable\n\nOne other thing to keep in mind - if you're clicking the file in order to execute it, if it crashes, or just terminates, you won't know what caused it since you don't see the output.\nYou could try opening a terminal, entering the directory where you have this binary, and running it with ./file.x86. The './' is important here since it means 'in the current directory'. This way you can see any error or informational messages when it terminates and possibly there's some hint about what you need to do in order to make it work.\nIn other words, check your game's requirements.\n\nA: Make sure the binary file has \"execute permission\"...\nThe easy way , right click in the file, then properties, go to the permissions tab and click in the \"Allow executing file as program\".\n\nor by command line:\nchmod +x /path/to/the/file.x86\n\nThen double click in the binary file or go to the path (in my case is /home/user/Dowloads/262linux) .\nin the terminal and type:\ncd /home/user/Downloads/262linux\n\n./262e.x86\n\n\nCheers.\n\nA: For more information:\nThe Unity3D Game Engine exports Linux game builds to these file types (.x86 & .x86_64).\nI encountered this problem today with my first Linux build in Unity (I am a Unity3D developer), but it's easily solvable, as explained in the answers above.\nJust thought you'd like to know.\nCheers.\n", "Q: C# on Ubuntu 12.04 Is C# a good choice for Ubuntu programming? For example, Unity, or applications that will run on Ubuntu? Am I doing good wanting to learn C# when I'm determined to stick with Ubuntu and develop on it or for it? If not, can you give me reasons why? And which languages would be better than C# for Ubuntu development? I already know C, C++, Java (basics), PHP, MySQL, and Python. I like to learn new stuff, but stuff that worth my time. Is C# worth my time?\nIf C# is worth my time, here's what I have done and what I need:\nI installed all mono packages I could find on the Ubuntu standard repositories. Now I want a good tutorial to get me started. I'm a complete noob with C# so a basic tutorial and how to compile run under Ubuntu 12.04 would be great.\n\nA: I can give you the perspective of someone who has developed an open source application found in Ubuntu (widemargin) using C# and Mono. Mono is very mature and its core libraries are complete.\nFor developing I would recommend MonoDevelop which is a free and open source IDE like Visual Studio.\nThere are a few Microsoft libraries that don't work on Ubuntu. These are mainly GUI libraries (winforms works but not well, WPF does not work at all). This is by design. These are native windows GUI libraries and so would look horrible on Ubuntu anyway.\nIf you are developing a desktop app I would recommend that you use Gtk# which is C# bindings to the native GTK+ framework on Ubuntu. This will give you a completely native looking application on Ubuntu.\nIf you are interested in cross platform applications then C# is the only language you can use on Windows, Linux, OS X, iOS, Android and WP7. The Mono people recommend that you write a new GUI for each platform using bindings to Native APIs (like Gtk# on Ubuntu), and share the code for your back end. This means your application will look and feel native on each platform.\nLearning C# will also allow you to:\n\n\n*\n\n*develop for the new PlayStation Suite, which is C# only, \n\n*make games with unity3d (in game scripting is C#), \n\n*make games like Bastion which use monogame,\n\n*develop websites using ASP.net MVC (what this site runs on).\n\n\nA: I developed an Ubuntu application using Mono C# and found it to be a very effective platform. There is a lot of anti-C# attitude in the community due to C# being created by Microsoft, but the reality is that C# does the job, and does it well. MonoDevelop is a great IDE and GTK# is a joy to use for the interface.\nGood luck.\n\nA: You can also use .NET Core instead of Mono which is open source and blazing fast. Even faster than node js for some cases.\n.NET CORE\nInstall .NET Core SDK on Linux Ubuntu 16.04 should be similar to your version\n\nRegister Microsoft key and feed\nTo start installing .NET, you'll need to register the Microsoft\n  signature key and add the Microsoft Product feed. This only needs to\n  be done once per machine.\nOpen a command prompt and run the following commands:\ncurl https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | gpg --dearmor > microsoft.gpg\nsudo mv microsoft.gpg /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/microsoft.gpg\nsudo sh -c 'echo \"deb [arch=amd64] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/microsoft-ubuntu-xenial-prod xenial main\" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/dotnetdev.list'  \n\nInstall .NET SDK\nUpdate the products available for installation, then install the .NET\n  SDK.\nIn your command prompt, run the following commands:\nsudo apt install apt-transport-https\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install dotnet-sdk-2.1.103\n\n\n\nA: Now you can do that with asp.net core  install visual studio code  https://code.visualstudio.com/download \n", "Q: What's the difference between GNOME Remix and GNOME Shell?

I'm looking for the link to have access to Windows installer for Ubuntu 11.10. My computer has trouble running Ubuntu 12.04 so I want to install an older version.\n\nA: Downloading, Installing, and Using an Unsupported Release (Wubi)\nYou can download unsupported releases, including their wubi.exe (Windows) installer, from:\n\n*\n\n*http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/\nYou should not use unsupported releases, though, because they don't get security updates as new security vulnerabilities are discovered and patched. This puts you at risk. You, and anyone else who depends on the security of your computer or the files on it.\nIf you choose, in spite of the danger, to use an unsupported release, then:\n\n*\n\n*To install it with Wubi, you must have the ISO image (also available from there) in the same directory as wubi.exe (since it will not automatically download the ISO image in a way that will work). Ideally these should be the only files in the folder at the time.\nSee this question for details: Why does wubi fail with a 404 error?\n\n\n*To update the new system so you at least have the security and stability fixes that were released when it was supported, and to install any software on it that was made available in its official repositories, and if you want to be able to upgrade it to a later release, you must change the package manager's download server to the old-releases server.\nSee this question for details:\nHow to install software or upgrade from old unsupported release?\nA Better Alternative: Use a Lighter-Weight Desktop Environment\nIf you've found newer versions of Ubuntu don't seem to work well on your aging machine, I recommend you consider running a lightweight derivative of Ubuntu such as:\n\n*\n\n*Xubuntu (wiki, TW, WP) – Xfce-based (TW, WP), less resource intensive than GNOME/Unity, or\n\n*Lubuntu (wiki, TW, WP) – LXDE-based (TW, WP), even less resource-intensive, very lightweight.\n\nHere's some more information about that:\n\n*\n\n*What is the difference between the various Ubuntu flavours?\n\n*Which is the best Ubuntu Flavor for an old laptop?\n\n*How can I speed up my old computer?\n\n*What kinds of desktop environments and shells are available?\n(no longer expanded, primarily of historical interest)\n\nOr, Try to Improve Performance\n\n*\n\n*How can I improve Ubuntu overall system performance?\n", "Q: How can I Install the Old TweetDeck version on Ubuntu 12.10 64bits?

Their 64 bit support was pretty bad to begin with. The chances of you getting this to work well are pretty slim. I would recommend just using wine. \nYou can use the older version of tweetdeck by installing air in wine then installing tweetdeck.

After somehow starting to search for a \"ppd\" file as a possible solution, I stumbled on said Launchpad question.\nSo when I installed the lpr and cups drivers from the Brother site, it created a ppd file at /usr/share/cups/model, with the name of my printer model.  So I opened cups, navigated to Administration -> Manage Printers -> Brother_HL-2270DW_series -> Administration/Modify Printer, chose Brother as the make, and added the ppd file from said location.

This partition is full.\nThe reason Ubuntu has given you a separate parition for /boot seems to be that you are using LVM and/or \"full\" disk encryption on the rest of the drive.\nThe /boot directory contains all of your kernel images, so the likely cause of this issue is that you have too many previous kernels installed.  Ubuntu issues kernel updates which bump the version number in the package name fairly frequently even for long term stable versions, so over time if you keep the system up to date, the /boot directory will grow.\nYou should be able to list your installed kernels with\naptitude search ~ilinux-image\n\n(Note that this will probably return packages that aren't kernels, too).\nThere is usually no need for more than two kernels to be installed - the one currently in use and the previous known working kernel (as a fallback).  So you can start removing the older ones, one by one, like this:\nsudo apt-get autoremove linux-image-3.2.0-23-generic\n\nMake sure you substitute \"3.2.0-23-generic\" with the actual kernel version you want to remove!  Also, don't remove packages such as linux-image-generic.  You have to be really careful not to remove the currently running kernel or you won't be able to boot (Ubuntu may or may not warn you about doing this).\nYou can find your currently running kernel with:\nuname -r\n\nHere's an illustrated guide to doing what I've just explained. This article uses slightly different tools but basically the same approach.\n\nA: I actually wanted to comment to neon_overload,\nbut the askubuntu prevents me from doing it..\nI followed the process but now the package: linux-image-generic does not appear after I run:\naptitude search ~ilinux-image\nand now I don't know how to continue - I'm running on 3.14 kenel:\n$ uname -a\nLinux ***** 3.13.1-031301-generic #201401291035 SMP Wed Jan 29 15:37:43 UTC 2014 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\nNow I do not know if I need to install the linux-image-generic that I can find in synaptic package manager - 3.2 or install look for the linux-image-generic with the 3.13 version\nI have solved the problem by -\n\n\n*\n\n*installing using synaptic package manager: linux-image-generic and linux-image\n\n*followed the regular procedure to install a new kernel - used dpkg -i on the 3 files:\nubuntu-pc:~/Downloads/kernel_3.13.1$ ls\nlinux-headers-3.13.1-031301_3.13.1-031301.201401291035_all.deb\nlinux-headers-3.13.1-031301-generic_3.13.1-031301.201401291035_amd64.deb\nlinux-image-3.13.1-031301-generic_3.13.1-031301.201401291035_amd64.deb\nNow I have the linux-image-generic and linux-image in my output of: aptitude search ~ilinux-image.\nNow let's try to boot with fingers crossed.\n", "Q: How to tweak Powertop to reduce power consumption?

Its way to complicated to reach your achievable goals. Your likely tiring to get a few extra minuets, maybe an hour. Powertop, while nice it more about tuning, and less about \"user level\" power management.\nAlso, quick disclaimer, Linux tends to use more power then windows because it does \"more stuff\" and uses the hardware different. You may not be able to get the same amount of time in Linux as you did in windows, or you may get more.\nThese are listed in the order of importance to me. That is the easiest to do with the most gain first.\nCPU Frequency\nThe largest impact on my battery is CPU frequency. When I am plugged in I want full speed, but when I unplug I want as much battery as I can muster. This is mostly automatic, these days, however to give it a bit of a hand, and to let me see it, I installed jupiter. This auto does stuff when on battery and when on power. It also gives me some direct control over some power management features.\nDisplay Brightness\nJust turn it down as far as you can. This made a large difference to me. If you want to do this via a script then echo -n 100 > /proc/acpi/video/VGA/LCD/brightness should would with a little adjustment. The path will likely be different depending on build/kernel/hardware.\nKeyboard backlight\nOn My Mac Book Pro, this has only a little gain, but turning off the keyboard backlight is super easy.\nIdle Time and Screen Blanking\nTurn them way down. From \"Power\" in unity, set suspend when inactive to 5 minutes, and when the lid is closed suspend. There is a link in the Tip at the bottom of the window. Click it and make sure that Dim Screen to save power is checked. Turn screen off after 2 Minutes. \nTurn Off Bluetooth\nAgain an easy one that doesn't save a lot. From Jupiter indicator, disable Bluetooth when on battery.  \nnoatime\nEdit /etc/fstab and add noatime to all local partitions and mount points. This \"should\" prevent your drive from spinning up as frequently. Read up on it first. This doesn't give the benefit it once did, but it keeps my drive from spooling.\nDo less stuff\nThis one is kinda tricky, but can give you a ton of savings. Basically Linux does a ton of stuff in the background. This is one of the best things about it. However it can also lead to higher then needed power usage. The easiest thing to do here is disable cron on battery but turn it back on when on power. This can be dangerous if you don't know what you doing. Basically it shouldn't hurt anything if you miss a few cron jobs, but leaving it off all the time will cause problems. \nAlso take a look at/keep an eye on htop. Reconsider the apps that are using a large amount of CPU.  \nNvidia\nI have no idea if this actually does anything so I put it last. Turn nvidia's (if you have it) powersaving on high. nvidia-settings -a [gpu:0]/GPUPowerMizerMode=0 should accomplish that. Side rant, compiz keeps my card from going below the max an awful lot. They need to fix that.\nClosing\nThese should help you get a reasonable level of battery performance from your ubuntu laptop. Powertop is very nice but if your a new Linux person it's about 100 flavors of overkill. Try these steps first.\n", "Q: failed to restart after installation I'm trying to install a 64 bits ubuntu desktop 12.10 to my new asus g75vw from a dvd.\nEverything worked slowly but fine until it finished, then the installation program prompted me to restart.I clicked restart button after which the computer freezes and finally I have to power it off.

This is specially true if I allow the guest option when sharing.\n\nIf Samba is not installed, it will prompt me to install it and configure it in 2 or 3 clicks when I try to share a folder. After login out and in, I can share any folder inside my Home and be done with it. The user from Windows or Ubuntu can see my PC and the sharing resources with no problems at all. There is no additional steps to configure permissions aside from the 2 or 3 Samba Share options when selecting the Sharing Options in the context menu.\nThe problems arise when I try to share something outside of my HOME. For example, a mountable unit. Doing it the same way I mentioned before does not work. The external user either can not access the shared resource or can not see it.

Is there a command that will let me look at file sizes of packages in the repositories/cache, sort them by file size, etc? `apt-cache stats' doesn't provide all the information I'd like. \nI'm interested in only the official repositories at the moment, and I'm interested in sorting all packages in the repositories, not simply the ones I have installed.\n\nA: That should work:\napt-cache -f dumpavail | \\\negrep '^Package:|^Size:' | \\\nsed -e 's,Size: ,,' -e 's,Package: ,\\n,' | \\\nawk '{RS=\"\"; FS=\"\\n\"} {print $1, $2}' | \\\nsort -k2 -n\n\nI'm not proud of it but that was done in a bit of a hurry :)\n\nA: for installed packages you can either use a oneliner: \ndpkg-query -W --showformat='${Installed-Size;10}\\t${Package}\\n' | sort -k1,1n\n\nor third-party tools like wajig:\nsudo aptitude install wajig\nwajig large\n\nthis will give output like\n...\nlibreoffice-core                   117,412      installed\ngoogle-chrome-stable               136,744      installed\nlinux-image-3.2.0-23-generic       145,113      installed\nlinux-image-3.2.0-33-generic       145,872      installed\nnvidia-current                     179,133      installed\n\nfor searches something like this might help:\naptitude search vnc -F \"%p %I\"\n\nThis gives output like: \n$ aptitude search xvnc -F \"%p %I\"\nlinuxvnc                71.7 kB \nlinuxvnc:i386           66.6 kB \nxvnc4viewer             430 kB  \nxvnc4viewer:i386                400 kB \n\nthe %I shows the \"installed\" size of the archive. Now you have the ability to use sort to sort the results as you wish.\n\nA: An alternative to Marcin's solution is this oneliner (only tested in zsh):\napt-cache dumpavail \\\n    | sed -nE '/^(Package|Size):/s/.* //p' \\\n    | while read name; do\n        read size\n        echo $size $name\n    done \\\n    | sort -nr\nIt has the dubious advantage of only using sed and sort, not also grep and awk. :)\n", "Q: Error on attempting to move and shrink an Ubuntu partition using GParted I like to add the unallocated space to the NTFS /dev/sda2 partition.

It's kind of a pain that I would like to get past.\n\nA: No,it is not possible to switch between windows 7 and Ubuntu without rebooting, but you can access windows 7 files(partitions) from Ubuntu.\n\nA: It is not possible to run both operating systems at a time in any part of the PC world. You can't run both simultaneously. At any given time, you can only run one system. Though, you can use virtual box and run a guest system inside of a host system.  \n\nA: Not exactly - but if your hardware supports virtualization, you can run Windows 7 in a VM while running Ubuntu, with excellent performance for anything except 3D gaming.  (If you want 3D gaming, you need to be running Windows natively.)\n\nIf you get Spice support enabled and working - which, admittedly, is currently a PITA - video and sound performance is easily good enough to, for example, watch video clips on YouTube in your Windows 7 VM.  For simple work or web browsing, you don't even need that - the default VNC console or RDP via Remmina is more than sufficient.\n", "Q: Battery icon constantly empty when discharging Vaio VGN-FZ210CE I have a Sony Vaio VGN-210CE laptop, and its battery does not report the drain rate properly.

So you are most defiantly SOL.\nSeems like there are a few people having this problem.\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1025283\n\nA: First, your screen shots aren't really legible; you may want to crop and re-post at full resolution or post links to the full-resolution images.\nSecond, penner is probably right in declaring this to be a kernel issue -- either a bug or an inability of the kernel to handle very new hardware. There is a remote possibility, though, that this is a bug that's being triggered by the new Secure Boot feature that's present on Windows 8 computers. Ubuntu 12.10 includes Secure Boot support, so in theory it should work; but this code is very new, so there could be a bug that's causing the kernel to flake out when launched in Secure Boot mode on some systems. If so, disabling Secure Boot in your firmware may help. You'll need to track down the option in your firmware, though, since there's absolutely no standardization about where such options go or how they're named.\n", "Q: Minecraft not working in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS - Black screen?

I am afraid that clicking \"UPGRADE TO 12.10\" in update manager will upgrade the OS and all the packages and that this will take all my monthly data from my contract which is just 3gig a month.\n\nA: I am not sure if there is a way to pre-download the files you need for the upgrade with an other computer. I am a afraid a iso can only be used for a fresh install (I could be wrong of course). I think most of the software needs to be re downloaded since these need to be the versions compatible with the new Ubuntu install.\nhowever I wanted to mention that if you have your /home on a separate partition most if not all of your settings are stored on that partition. this means that if you do a fresh install, but don't format your /home partition (only point the installation to it) almost all your settings are saved. for example after the re-installation all my e-mail accounts and emails in Thunderbird where still present! this makes doing a fresh install not a big deal!\nsomething can always go wrong so of course make a backup before re-installing!\nIf you do not have a separate /home partition I think you can rescue most of your settings by copying all of the folders in your home directory with a dot in front of the name (make them visible by pressing ctrl-h when in your home folder in your file browser). after your fresh install you copy the folders back and I think this will restore the applications settings. but try at your own risk ;)\n", "Q: How to debug maasserver with django runserver In order to debug maas, I ran the following command:\n$ cd /usr/share/pyshared/maas\n$ sudo python manage.py runserver (IP):8888 --settings=maas.settings\n\nAfter that, I typed the url 'http://(IP):8888/MAAS/' in a firefox browser.\nThen the following error is shown:\nA server error occurred.

I have old notebook with BIOS (not EFI) installed with Windows 8 RTM, want to install Ubuntu 12.10 by booting to a LiveCD. \nDoing some research, I found method either to choose Something Else or Install Alongside...\nWhich method should I use?\n\nA: Alongside\nAs the other answer say, this method is the recommend one for those users that don't have the enough experience with partitions and OS installation.\nIn this method, you don't have to worry about the configurations, the Ubuntu installer will do all the complex work for you and you will be using Ubuntu in minutes.\nOf course that both OS will exist separately and with own programs.\nYour Ubuntu will be as a Windows program, with its own entry in Add/Remove programs.\nThis is relatively low risk for your Windows system.\nSomething Else\nIf you are one of those users how want all the things as they want to, configuring everything and choosing all the options to your way, this option is the one you should pick.\nIt will let you choice the use of the partitions (resizing, moving and allocating the free space).\n\nA: Use install alongside windows 8 if you have never been into partitions before. \nIn 95% of all the cases that is the smartest, and the fastest thing to do. \n\nA: Full installation of UBUNTU to really experience UBUNTU.

To this end, I'll have to\ndebuild -S\n\nthe package which by default requires human interaction since the gpg key used for signing is protected by a password.\nThe cronjob then also fails with an error message of the type\ncannot open /dev/tty\n\nwhich gpg typically uses for the password challenge.\nHow would I have to set up the system to work around such issues?\n\nA: Well, for starters you'll need to get the passphrase to your gpg process somehow. You can use any of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*--passphrase-fd\nRead the passphrase in through a file descriptor\n\n*--passphrase-file\nRead the passphrase in from a file\n\n*--passphrase\nSpecify the passphrase directly\nAfter that, you'll also want to add --batch and --no-tty. See the gpg man page for more explanation.\n\nA: debuild uses debsign to sign. According to debsign manpage, the option -pprogname can be used to change the command for signing. So you can use something like this so gpg will not ask for passphrase:\ndebuild -S -p\"gpg --batch --passphrase PASS --pinentry-mode loopback\"\n\nChange \"--passphrase PASS\" with your preferred way of passing passphrase to gpg.\n", "Q: stuck in violet screen or black screen with dash Since I've installed ubuntu 12.04 I have this problem (on mint 13 I also had this problem) now I have ubuntu 12.10 updated and windows 7 with it. \nWhen I go to windows everything works fine but some times suddenly if I choose ubuntu, it will stuck in violet screen.

I'm trying to debug an OOM situation in an Ubuntu 12.04 server, and looking at the Memory graphs in Landscape, I noticed that there wasn't any serious memory usage spike. Then I looked at the output of the free command and I wasn't quite sure how both memory usage results relate to each other. \nHere's landscape's output on the server:\n$ landscape-sysinfo \n  System load:  0.0               Processes:           93\n  Usage of /:   5.6% of 19.48GB   Users logged in:     1\n  Memory usage: 26%               IP address for eth0: -\n  Swap usage:   2%\n\nThen I ran the free command and I get:\n$ free -m\n             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\nMem:           486        381        105          0          4        165\n-/+ buffers/cache:        212        274\nSwap:          255          7        248\n\nI can understand the 2% swap usage, but where does the 26% memory usage come from?\n\nA: In Landscape\nlandscape-sysinfo actually gets its data directly from /proc/meminfo:\ndpb@helo:~$ cat /proc/meminfo |egrep 'MemTotal:|Active:'\nMemTotal:       12286760 kB\nActive:          3794832 kB\ndpb@helo:~$\n\nThe calculation of \"Memory Usage\" in this case would be:\n((MemTotal - Active) / MemTotal) * 100\n\nYou can see these calculations in:\n/usr/share/pyshared/landscape/sysinfo/memory.py\n/usr/share/pyshared/landscape/lib/sysstats.py\n\ngets its data directly from /proc/meminfo:\nIn free\nThe free utility also gets its data directly from /proc/meminfo:\nMem\n\n\n*\n\n*total: MemTotal\n\n*used: MemTotal - MemFree\n\n*free: MemFree\n\n*buffers: Buffers\n\n*cached: Cached\nBuffers/cache\n\n\n*\n\n*used: MemTotal - MemFree - Buffers - Cached\n\n*free: MemFree + Buffers + Cached\nSwap\n\n\n*\n\n*total: SwapTotal\n\n*used: SwapTotal - SwapFree\n\n*free: SwapFree\nTotal\n\n\n*\n\n*total: MemTotal + SwapTotal\n\n*used: MemTotal - MemFree + SwapTotal - SwapFree\n\n*free: MemFree + SwapFree\nCorrected cached -- lzap\n\nA: Those graphs don't reflect every single memory allocation/freeing event, but samples from /proc/meminfo (exactly as dpb described) at given intervals.  A slightly speculative explanation for why it's not showing in the graph would be that it simply occurred between to points when memory usage was sampled.\nI suspect that what has happened here is that some process acquired lots of memory in a hurry and OOM killer disposed of it before a sample could be made.  That would be a fairly extreme circumstance, and also one that would mean the whole machine was running slowly as it was swapping heavily. This loading on the machine would reduce the likelihood of the system having available time to sample memory usage during that window and report it back to the Landscape server.\n\nA: To add to dpb's correct answer, we need to define the difference between memory types.  Going by redhat's documentation on /proc/meminfo:\nThe main definitions to use:\n\n\n*\n\n*Active memory is memory has been used recently and shouldn't be replaced by the OS when new pages are brought in.\n\n*MemTotal is how much usable memory your system has (physical memory minus a tiny amount of memory used for the kernel code).\n\n*MemFree is memory currently unused memory.  Memory used as disk cache is not free.\n\n*MemUsed is memory being used = MemTotal - MemFree.\n\n*Cached is memory used as a cache for files on disk - if you recently read a file from disk maybe you'll look at it again in the near future so let's keep it in memory when its available (as essentially free and could dramatically speed up your computer as reads from disk take several milliseconds while reads from memory take microseconds or less).\n\n*Buffers is a buffer for the IO devices located -- e.g., when you change values of a file, it first gets saved to the buffers (in your main memory) and then the changes get written to the disk as writing to the disk is slow.  This buffered memory is short lived and tiny on modern kernels.  (Granted the distinction between cached/buffers is less clear on modern linux kernel see [1]).\n\n*MemUsed - Buffers/Cached (first number in second line of free) is how much memory is used by your processes.  This is how much memory is in use ignoring the disk cache (which your system is free to over write)..\n\n\nYou could easily have more active memory than MemUsed - Buffers/Cached.  This scenario would occur when you are frequently accessing parts of disk that have been cached in memory.  Similarly, you could have processes that have allocated memory but haven't used that allocated memory recently -- maybe its ideal to move this allocated memory to swap if you need more memory.\n", "Q: iTunes library.itl cannot be read beacause it was created by a newer version I have installed iTunes 10 by wine on Ubuntu 12.10 and removed it.

When running higher demanding processes such as top notch games, it switch to the more powerful one , the Radeon. The thing is that on Ubuntu, this doesn't happen. BOTH of the GPU's are running, overall generating more heat to the whole machine. This is the cause for overheating on ubuntu, as i'm not a master ubuntu user, i don't know exact coordonation for solving the problem, but this is what happens, i hope i cleared the situation for you a bit.

I already tried leaving only Java 7, and now I am back to leaving only Java 6), but I cannot get it to work.\nHow do I get JRE up and running in Firefox?\nUPDATE: I had so much trouble with Java in Firefox quitting working after upgrades, etc. that I gave up on Firefox entirely (my main purpose of using this Ubuntu machine is to safely run Java applications away from my main computer). I now run Opera and never had any problems again - it comes with Java, and it just works.\n\nA: It appears that the Java verification applet doesn't work with the implementation of Java that Ubuntu uses (OpenJDK), but other applets should work if you install the Java web plugin, which is a plugin that lets Java applets run in a web browser.\nAccording to the community documentation for Java,\n\nBrowser plugin\n\n*\n\n*Install the icedtea6-plugin package using any installation method.\n\n*Install the icedtea-7-plugin package using any installation method.\n\n\nIf you are using or want to use the default version of Java included with Ubuntu, just run\nsudo apt-get install icedtea-plugin\n\nIf you want to use a specific version, just use the packages listed above.\n\nA: You need the browser plugin for Java to work in Firefox.\nsudo apt-get install icedtea-plugin\n\nThen sudo update-alternatives --config java\nCheck which version is activated: java -version\nInstall the icedtea-web plugin if not yet installed: sudo apt-get install icedtea-web\n", "Q: gksudo keeps asking for my password when using a custom Unity launcher I wrote a custom .desktop file that contains an Exec line\n#!/usr/bin/env xdg-open\n[Desktop Entry]\n(...)\nExec=gksudo /my/path/to/bash_script.sh\n(...)\n\nThis script launches some zenity calls.\nThen I made this desktop file to appear in unity-2d launcher side bar.\nMy problem is every time I use this launcher shortcut it keeps asking for my password...

While the same command in the alt+f2 launcher asks it every time.\nEither way, if you want to run something as root, it is not that weird it will ask your password every time. That way you know you will be running the command as root.\n\nA: This is absolutely normal. In the terminal, you've always got the same \"session\", so it remembers the authentification, but that's not the same with a .desktop launcher.\nI'd recommend you to just add a file to /etc/sudoers.d (name it my_script or something like that), so that you can always use your command without password (if your script doesn't accept arguments that should be safe) - but do this at your own risk:\nCreate a new file with following content\nyour_username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /my/path/to/bash_script.sh\n\nWhen I tested it with gksu it worked directly afterwards, but if it doesn't, try logging in and out again or rebooting.\n", "Q: No Windows7 entry on GRUB2's menu after installing Ubuntu I Installed Ubuntu 12.04  and after installation no Windows 7 entry shown.\nBoot-Repair output : http://paste.ubuntu.com/1396793/\n\nA: Some Windows boot files are missing.

It seems the package has some problem (maybe a missing dependency?).\nWhat I recommend (worked for me) is that you uninstall it and use the version provided in their webpage.

Inside you find a sikuli-ide.sh file which you can use to start it.\nAfter that you can create a launcher to it if you want (example for Eclipse here).\nEdit\nI forgot to mention: as stated in their webpage Sikuli requires OpenCV 2.1. Unfortunately 12. 10 only provides OpenCV 2.3/2.4 and it didn't worked for me.\nThe easiest way to solve this was installing OpenCV 2.1 packages from Oneiric. You will need 3 packages:\n\n\n*\n\n*libhighgui2. 1 (x86)\n\n*libcvaux-2. 1 (x86)\n\n*libcv2. 1 (x86)\n\n\nAfter you download them (choose a mirror on each link) install them in that order (libhighgui first) using Software Center (just double click each package).\nAnother way can be achieved by downloading OpenCV 2.1 and build it manually.

I know that Ubuntu uses Upstart and supports SysV, but which one is used to start the services? This matters when you want a \"manual\" start for a service.\nFor example, on my system i have files for the following services either in /etc/init.d/<service> (SysV) and /etc/init/<service>.conf (Upstart):\nacpid, mysql, networking, qemu-kvm, ufw, libvirt-bin\n\nSo if i want to disable MySQL execution at startup, i must use the Upstart way or the SysV way to disable it? Also, how can i tell which of those is really used to start a generic service?\nEdit\nThe really doubt here is not how disable/enable services using SysV/Upstart. What really confuses me is that some services seem to be defined (and enabled) in SysV and Upstart at the same time. Is there any precedence between them (like if mysql is enabled in both launch it using SysV)? Or can it be the case that one tool uses the other in background? \n\nA: It does largely depend on the application and its packaging maintainer.\nThere is a strong preference for Upstart scripts because they handle events (which is generally a great thing) but a lot of applications don't have good enough Upstart scripts available or the application's maintainer has chosen to stick with the defaults (application or Debian's).\nEither way, you're in the position where you have to adapt.\n\n\n*\n\n*For Upstart:\n\n*\n\n*Rename the file to something that doesn't end .conf, or\n\n*Add manual to the file. This will allow you to manually load the service.\n\n\n*For older services:\nupdate-rc.d -f <service> remove\n\nIf you have an /etc/init.d/ script for something and an /etc/init/ script and you want to check if the init.d version is still live, you can check with:\nls -l /etc/rc?.d/*<service>\n\nIf you see a load of symlinks, it's installed in the old SysV init.\n\nA: Regarding services that are defined in both SysV and upstart, generally if you restart it through SysV you'll see something like this:\nal@al-mythtv:~$ sudo /etc/init.d/mysql restart\n[sudo] password for al: \nRather than invoking init scripts through /etc/init.d, use the service(8)\nutility, e.g. service mysql restart\n\nSince the script you are attempting to invoke has been converted to an\nUpstart job, you may also use the stop(8) and then start(8) utilities,\ne.g. stop mysql ; start mysql. The restart(8) utility is also available.\nmysql stop/waiting\nmysql start/running, process 29846\n\nWhat I take this to mean is that Upstart is preferred for these services, and the SysV implementation is just a wrapper.\nAlso, I think you have the meaning of the directories backwards. /etc/init is upstart configuration, /etc/init.d is the SysV compatibility, but it is just symlinks to upstart for these type of services.\n", "Q: Purpose of /run/lock/ (empty except for ./whoopsie/) My /run/lock/ directory is empty except for ./whoopsie/. I have understood /run/lock/ as a replacement for /var/lock/ but was surprised to find it entirely empty.\nIs whoopsie meant as a deterrent from using this directory?\nI did find other lock files under /run/, though. Most notably in /run/user/<me>/. I would have expect per-users lock files in /run/lock/user/ and not in a separate directory.\nHoping for some clarification!\n\nA: /run is something in-between /var and /tmp.

So /run/lock is a TMPFS version of /var/lock.\nSome extra information (put in a much better way than I could ever put it :P): http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.redhat.fedora.devel/146976.\n", "Q: How to set the tempreture at which the fan must speed up - laptop I have HP Probook 4530s and the fan speeds up at around 45C then when it reaches 35C slows down and repeats.

How can set a higher threshold at which it will speed up and how can I keep the tempreture between the two intervals stable ( I mean the fan will not turn off but keep a steady speed ).\nThank you in advance.\n\nA: Fan speed and the temperature at which the fan hits certain speeds can be controlled in linux via a combination of packages lm-sensors and fancontrol, though on my HP laptop I could never get it to work properly, I believe because HP controls this via the bios, but it may just be I didn't research enough.\nI ended up changing the cpu governor to conservative and changing the conservative governor settings this ultimately made my computer run cooler and more efficiently (less fan cycling). \nI found these two pages that helped me manipulate the governor and put my setting permanently in /etc/rc.local to load them on each reboot http://www.pantz.org/software/cpufreq/usingcpufreqonlinux.html\nhttp://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/How_to_use_cpufrequtils\n", "Q: How do Ubuntu updates appear on Amazon EC2?

Your package management updates the package lists from the repositories regularly by default on Ubuntu. When you log in to the system a script queries the package management for the amount of updates in the regular and security channels and displays it.\n\nIf these updates are new how are they shipped from Canonical to Amazon Server?\n\nCanonical publishes the packages in the main repositories and also sets up mirrors to which your machine connects to in the default install.

However I know it's responding because the screen doesn't gray out and I can still move my mouse. \n(That is just one example) I installed the latest Nvidia drivers about 4 days before this happened. It was running amazingly with those drivers. So I don't think that's the problem.  (I tried downgrading just in case and it didn't help)  I've been dealing with this for about a week and a half. The problems started when I was using 12.04 64-bit. \nI've been using 12.10 64-bit since last Friday. Today I turned my computer on and Ubuntu told me it had some errors on the disk so I let it fix them. Now when I boot up my computer is slower than ever. It hangs 5-7 seconds when I do so much as click on a menu.  It takes 8 seconds for the command ls to work.  I would reformat to try and fix, but I'm on a work computer and I have a lot of stuff on here.\nI've tried using Unity, gnome, gnome classic with/without effects. Same problem on all of them.\nI am on a Dell Precision laptop\n\n\n*\n\n*i7 processor\n\n*nvidia QUADRO 3000m\n\n*8GB of RAM\n\n*500GB HDD x2\n\n\nSystem monitor shows that the system is running fine and isn't peaking anywhere. \nPS: When I boot from CD, everything runs normal again.\n\nA: Try reinstalling the graphic driver,if it doesnt work try reinstalling ubuntu, if it still doesnt work.....well consider checking your HDD,good luck \n\nA: First, I have to say it for the whole world. BACK UP YOUR DATA!!! Use back in time, deje dupe, rsync, or just copy files. Problems like this are a good reason why. This is even more important in business land. It's sooooo easy to do, there's literally no reason not to. Sorry juts had to get that in. Occupational hazard I guess. On to actually being helpful.\nIt sounds like you have a timeout happening. That you end up \"waiting\" for that timeout, then continuing on. Here are some things that I would check. \n\n\n*\n\n*Check /var/log/messages and make sure your not getting an error there. If you are, fix it. You can also use dmesg.\n\n*Check that you have freespace and inodes. df -h and df -i should do the trick.\n\n*Run fsck manually from recovery mode. Maybe there are more errors. \n\n*Check your sound card and nic (or other \"extra\") hardware, make sure there fine and, for testing, disable power savings. I have seen both cause issues like you describe (though not out of the blue like that).\n\n*Unmount everything that is not needed to run the OS, and try ls again. That type of freezing sounds a lot like bad networks share.\n\n*If all else fails, mount the drive using a liveCD (not recovery mode) and try browsing around the disk, and issuing your ls again. You may have a bad hard drive. \n\n", "Q: Lucid Lynx 10.04 ISO download Where can I find Lucid Lynx 10.04 ISO image for download?

I am trying to install Percona Xtrabackup to my Ubuntu 12.04 LTS insatlled on Amazon EC2.\nI am trying to follow instruction on the Xtrabackup installation page here. The instruction follows as\nAdd this to /etc/apt/sources.list, replacing squeeze with the name of your distribution:\ndeb http://repo.percona.com/apt squeeze main\ndeb-src http://repo.percona.com/apt squeeze main\n\nIn my case I will replace squeeze with precise but when I open /etc/apt/sources.list for editing it says the following \n\nIt is suggestion three alternatives instead of editing which are listed a.), b.) and c.). \nMy Question\nWhat should I do to install Percona Xtrabackup to my box?\n\nA: In general, it's more elegant to create a new file in the sources.list.d directory. It should have the 'extension' .list though. Just create a new file for example /etc/apt/sources.list.d/percona.list to contain\ndeb http://repo.percona.com/apt precise main\ndeb-src http://repo.percona.com/apt precise main\n\nAnd don't forget to follow the rest of the instructions (GPG APT key, update).\nFor Amazon EC2 you actually ought to do so apparently, as explained perfectly in the comment you posted.\nIt's more elegant, because .d directories are meant for users to put their own part of the configuration in there and scripts modifying this when running dist-upgrades for example are less likely to break.\n", "Q: Thunderbird mail-Outlook 11.10 I want to use Thunderbird mail, but can I use my outlook e-mail?\nIt's not that urgent, but I want to use it.\n\nA: Outlook is a software which runs on Windows only, not Linux. So if you want to use Outlook on Ubuntu, you will have to use a Windows emulator like WINE to make Outlook run on your Linux.\n", "Q: Permission denied, are you root? I get this error whenever I try to install programs using the terminal:\nhome@ubuntu:~$ apt-get install myunity\nE: Could not open lock file /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (13: Permission denied)\nE: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), are you root?\n\nAlso I'm unable to install updates using the terminal.\n\nA: Try with\nsudo apt-get update \n\nIf you still get lock error try this command\nIt will give the process detail\nps -e | grep -e apt -e adept | grep -v grep\n\nThen kill the process using process ID\nthen execute the update command\nAnd also u can delete this file your problem will solve\nrm /var/lib/dpkg/lock \n\n\nA: just run \nsudo apt-get update\nsudo is for running it as super user\n\nA: According to the community documentation about using the terminal,\n\nsudo: Executing Commands with Elevated Privileges\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Most of the following commands will need to be prefaced with the sudo command. This elevates privileges to the root-user administrative level temporarily, which is necessary when working with directories or files not owned by your user account. When using sudo you will be prompted for your password. Only users with sudo (administrative) privileges will be able to use this command. You should never use normal sudo to start graphical applications as Root (Please see RootSudo for more information on using sudo correctly.) \n  \n\nSo, because apt-get installs software and thus affects the system, you need to use the sudo command to give yourself administrator privilages.\nThus, you command should be sudo apt-get install myunity\nIf you want to update your system, run\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nThis will update your system's package database and then install any upgrades.\n\nA: Just read the error output: are you root? because you are not. As a regular user you don't have enough privileges to install packages.\nPrepend sudo to the command to elevate the privileges. Provided that account has sudo privileges that will work.\n\nA: The solution is to read the error message: are you root?. Use sudo to run a command with root privileges, like so: sudo apt-get update\n\nA: Before running any administrative task: installing, removing, changing system wide preferences, etc. you need to be root. This is specially true for apt-get. The message itself tells you where the problem is:\n\nare you root?\n\nIf you are not root, the install command will not work at all.\nThe way to fix this is using sudo before the command:\n➜  ~  apt-get update\nE: Could not open lock file /var/lib/apt/lists/lock - open (13: Permission denied)\nE: Unable to lock directory /var/lib/apt/lists/\nE: Could not open lock file /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (13: Permission denied)\nE: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), are you root?\n➜  ~  sudo apt-get update\nFetched 616 kB in 25s (23.9 kB/s)\n\nAs you can notice, it completed without problems when I used sudo. If you have any open (13: Permission denied) it is almost sure that you are not root and need to use sudo.\n\nA: I had this error and in my case I had to remove\nnoexec on /var in /etc/fstab\nwhich works fine on my CentOS, Fedora and Alpine Linux\n", "Q: How do I reset my display settings from the command line? I'm running 12.10 on a dell e5400 laptop and I used xrandr to get the dual monitors working that I connect through a laptop dock.

I started using Windows 7 again to play some of my games I had been missing and I have to say I've been relieved to be reintroduced to the standard installation area Program Files. \nFrom what I've noticed on almost every Linux distribution there is like 5 different areas where games/programs or other odds and ends end up. When you install something, I feel as though you pretty much have to guess where it installed at, which honestly don't make any sense to me. \nSo my question is, why does it appear as though there is no standard on Linux/Ubuntu? I'm not saying it's a bad thing. I just want to understand the reasons behind it.\n\nA: \nwhy is there no standard on Linux/Ubuntu?\n\nThe reason is that it is part of a standard. It's called the \"Filesystem Hierarchy Standard\".\nI suggest you to read that.\nYour conclusion should be is that it is way more organized than you think it is and in my opinion a lot better than on Windows OS.\n", "Q: Ubuntu gets stuck in a login loop My Ubuntu is stuck in a login loop when trying to enter my desktop. When I login, the screen gets black and soon after that the login screen comes back. \nI've read that the problem might be caused by an error depending on the graphics, here's my graphics card: ATI Radeon 7670M\n\nA: Yes I caused a Login Loop on my main Ubuntu 12.10 user and the fix was simple.\nBackground:\nUbuntu 12.10 is installed in VirtualBox running on Windows 7 and uses Unity.\nCause:\nFrom the Desktop I Ctrl+Alt+T into terminal mode and then tried to run 'startx' (I was trying to help a friend over the phone late at night...but this was a stupid thing to do). A new blank Unity desktop appeared and everything hung...\nProblem:\nForcing VirtualBox to close and then rebooting Ubuntu I got to the login screen but kept looping back to this same screen everytime after entering the password. No errors were displayed. I could login as Guest but I had no Sudo rights and thus no control...\nHowever once logged in as Guest I Ctrl+Alt+F3 and got to a terminal login. \nI entered my main user name and password and logged in with command mode. Logout took me back to CLI login and Ctrl+Alt+F7 took me back to Guest desktop. So my account still worked. I then added a test user and gave them sudo rights. From the Unity login I could login and logout Test user with no problem. So Unity still worked.\nFix:\nSo my main account was still accessable via CLI and Unity was working for all other accounts. This indicated a configuation problem on my main account. I followed the advice of SiddharthaRT at the top of this post and did chown username:username .Xauthority. This fixed my problem. Thanks !!\n\nA: I only had to change the permissions of my home folder:\nsudo chmod 755 /home/<username>\n\nThis can be done by logging in, into a terminal, using your username and password in a shell using CtrlAltF1.\n\nA: Proprietary Driver Issues\nMoKSB State\nI was able to log in to TTY using ctrl+alt+F1, but had no internet access seeing as the driver is proprietary as well.\nNo Xorg issues were apparent.\nI decided to remove the packages when I recieved the MokSB failed message telling me that it could NOT change the secure boot settings. The notable part is that it prompted me for a password even though it failed.\nSecure Boot\nCaution: Do NOT just blindly remove your drivers!\nA good test to see if it is a Proprietary Driver issue is to turn OFF Secure Boot and boot Ubuntu and attempt to login. If logging in works, then you now know what you're issue is.\nBroadcom Drivers and Nvidia Drivers\nI removed nvidia packages\nsudo apt-get purge nvidia-*\n\nand then I removed the broadcom packages\nsudo apt-get purge bcmwl-kernel-source\n\nand rebooted.\nI attempted to login again and success! \nI saw my desktop!\nI rebooted again. \nlogged in again and everything was set to default.\n\n\n*\n\n*I rebooted into BIOS\n\n*turned off secure boot (not recommended, need a better solution) \n\n*booted up ubuntu using grub\n\n*logged in and installed the downloaded *.deb file for my wifi driver \n\n*installed it using Software Center\n\n*and rebooted.\nI followed the same procedure for my nvidia drivers seeing as the default video drivers are awful on my card.\nTurning Secure Boot On Again\nIf I turn on Secure Boot again, I see the same issue. Since the drivers are NOT signed, it's not a true Secure Boot and I get locked out.\nPersonally, I find this to be a very bogus (and annoying) issue.\nAlternative Solution?\nThe most feasible solution I saw was customizing the kernel seeing as I can't simply leave Secure Boot off and turn it On and then Off when I switch OS's. Again, it's just annoying.\nUPDATE on Jan 4 2017\nAccording to this article, the Linux Kernel >= 4.6 now officially supports \n\nGeForce GTX 900 series accelerated support in conjunction with signed\n  firmware images.\n\nThis should resolve the secure boot issue caused by using the unsigned firmware images.\n\nA: I have been through this problem multiple times and it has been a different issue each time.

Its installer is quite capable too and it uninstalled successfully my hack-installed unstable version from Nvidia website.\nTL;DR, just try logging into the shell (Ctrl+Alt+F2 or whatever F between F1 and F6) and type \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install nvidia-367\n\nIf it succeeds, reboot.\nsudo reboot\n\nIf you're lucky enough, problem solved, you should be able to login to Unity.\nUPDATE\nPlease note that sometimes nvidia-current might install the wrong driver. In that case, search the latest compatible driver for your video card and install it. For example, on Ubuntu 16.04, nvidia-current points to the version: 304.131-0ubuntu3. This might be incompatible with your graphics card; therefore, search with sudo apt-cache search nvidia-[0-9]+$ for the package you need, and install it.\n\nA: I encountered this exact problem and none of the suggested fixes above worked for me. After almost giving up I looked at the .xsession-errors and noticed I had a typo in my .profile (I had an extra } in the file after I edited it earlier in the day).\nThat was causing the login loop. It might be another place to look if the other suggested fixes don't work for you.\n\nA: sudo chown $USER:$USER $HOME\n\nwas the problem for me.\nI had set up a home partition with:\nsudo mkdir /home/$USER\n\nbut forgot to chown it.\n\nA: I had a nearly identical problem a few months ago. Switching into a console from the LightDM login screen (Ctrl-Alt-F1), logging in with administrative username and password, and entering the following commands resolved the issue:\nsudo mv ~/.Xauthority ~/.Xauthority.backup\nsudo service lightdm restart\n\n\nA: I found my /tmp file permission settings were not correct. It had permissions for root only.\nThis was my own mistake. I forgot that a day earlier, I deleted the /tmp folder with sudo rights and after recreated the folder again with sudo mkdir tmp.\nBig mistake. I created a /tmp folder with root permissions only.\nIn the ~/.Xsession-errors file I could see that x11 was not able to write a file in /tmp. After execute these commands from the root account (or Alt+Ctrl+f1) in welcome screen and use the problem account credentials to login) I solved the problem:\nsudo chmod 1777 /tmp\nsudo chown root:root /tmp\n\nAfter these, I was able to login to Unity again with the normal account again.\nSo if you have, what looks like a .Xauthority problem, you could try this if nothing else works.\nSee this thread on Ubuntu Forums\n\nA: I got the login loop in connection with an update from Ubuntu 12.04 to 14.04.  With gdm I had error messages in ~/.cache/gdm/session.log with entries such as /etc/gdm/Xsession: line 33: mktemp: command not found and after sudo aptitude purge gdm with lightdm I got several similar error messages in  ~/.xsession-errors, e.g., usr/sbin/lightdm-session: line 24: mktemp: command not found.\nI tried several things. What I believe did eventually resolve the problem for me was this: \nI moved my configuration files .profile, .bashrc and .pam_environment to other names and then I managed to login. I suspect that there is a problem in one of them. \n\nA: Did you end up here after running sudo startx? Nevertheless:\nPress Ctrl+Alt+F3 and login into the shell.\nNow run ls -lA. If you see the line\n-rw-------  1 root root   53 Nov 29 10:19 .Xauthority\n\nthen you need to do chown username:username .Xauthority and try logging in (you may also need to do the same for for .ICEauthority).\nElse, do ls -ld /tmp. Check for the first 10 letters in the left: they should read exactly so: drwxrwxrwt. \ndrwxrwxrwt 15 root root 4096 Nov 30 04:17 /tmp\n\nElse, you need to do sudo chmod a+wt /tmp and check again.\nIf not both, I'd recommend you either\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm\n\n*or uninstall, reinstall it.\n\n\nNow press Alt+→ until you reach the login screen again, and restart. \n\nA: I had the same problem after a clean install of Ubuntu 12.10 (but reusing my existing home partition). I tried all of the other answers, but none worked. But I found the clue to my specific problem in the file .xsession-errors in my home directory.\nThis is how I solved it in my case:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hit Ctrl+Alt+F1 to open a virtual terminal. Then login with username and password.\n\n*Open the file ~/.xsession-errors if it exists (type cat ~/.xsession-errors). In my case, this file contained one single line with an error message: \n\n/usr/sbin/lightdm-session: 27: .: Can't open /usr/bin/byobu-launch\n\n\n*Now byobu is a command line tool that I use and I have no idea how that ended up in a system file since this was right after a clean install. Byobu is not installed by default, so that might explain the error as it looks for a file (/usr/bin/byobu-launch) that doesn't exist. So in my case I had to install byobu to fix the problem:\n\nsudo apt-get install byobu\n\n\n*Hit Ctrl+Alt+F7 to go back to the login screen, and login worked fine now.\nOf course in your case you might find a different error message in .xsession-errors, which requires a different solution.\n\nA: I had a very similar issue where I could log in on the terminal but not on the desktop, my wallpaper from the profile was loaded during login, but after a few seconds it jumped back to the login screen. I checked all file permissions as suggested, they were fine. I tried without a separate home partition and was able to log in to the desktop. After that I checked the settings for the LUKS encrypted home partition, which were also fine (though there were some error messages on the terminal, telling me that the encrypted volume could not be mounted, because it was already mounted).\nThen I looked into dmesg, found BTRFS errors related to the filesystem on the LUKS encrypted home partition (yep, I'm mixing LUKS and BTRFS), tried to actually write to the filesystem and found that it gave me I/O errors. So I had to repair the filesystem or create a new one and restore from backup.\nLong story short: Look at dmesg and actually try to write to the filesystem that seems to be writable.\n\nA: My home folder was full :-( df -h will give you this answer I had to connect through ssh made some space and worked like a flower\nctrl+alt+F1, login as user, free up some space and restart your X server! mostely sudo service sddm restart\n\nA: This could also be because of a special combination of settings:\n\n\n*\n\n*Encrypted /home/$USER\n\n*$USER in nopasswdlogin group\n\n\nlightdm will try to log you in, but can't access any files so you get the described symptoms.\nTo fix this, remove $USER from the group:\nsudo gpasswd -d $USER nopasswdlogin\n\n\nA: I experienced the same problem and the cause in my case was that I tried to add something to the /etc/environment file and whatever I added seemed to not want me to log in after I restarted.\nSolution:\nWhen at the login screen press CTRL + ALT + F2. Login with admin username and password and edit the /etc/environment file and remove what changes you made to it.\nIn the terminal, you can run the following command use nano to edit the file:\nsudo nano /etc/environment\n\nPress CTRL + o and then press ENTER to save the file. Press CTRL + x to exit nano.\nOnce you have edited and saved the file, simply hit CTRL + ALT + F2 to go back to the GUI login screen and you should be able to log on.\n\nA: I had to deal with the same problem.\nUnfortunately in my case it was not resolved by simply changing permissions so my contribution will be to try to create a guide from the simple to the more complex steps. Hopefully your uses will be resolved with the simple ones.\nNote: replace <username> with your username.\nAssumptions: Nvidia Graphic Card, lightdm\n\nAccess To Terminal\nTo open a new terminal simply use (and then login with your credentials):\nCtrl+Alt+F1\nCheck the owned/group/permissions of your home directory files\ncd ~<username>\nls -lah\n\nFix the owner and group of .Xauthority and /tmp\nchown <username>:<username> .Xauthority\nsudo chmod a+wt /tmp\n\nCheck if there is still a problem by restarting lightdm\nsudo service lightdm restart\n\n\nReconfigure lightdm\ndpkg-reconfigure lightdm\nsudo service lightdm restart\n\n\nIf you wish to see possible errors from the system\ntail -n 50 /var/log/Xorg.0.log # if you want to see the last 50 errors\ntail -f /var/log/Xorg.0.log    # if you want to be able to see all new errors live\n\nRelevant log files:\n/var/log/Xorg.0.log\n/var/log/lightdm/lightdm.log\n\n\nAs a last resort, which is what I did, reinstall the graphic card drivers.\nNvidia simply does not work nice with Ubuntu.\n\nA: I had to remove NVIDIA drivers to get in, as in (replace nvidia-current with nvidia-340 or whatever your number is).\nRevert back to Nouveau drivers\nThen I had a buggy UNITY frame. I had to follow the steps showed here to fix them:\nhttps://askubuntu.com/a/290376/275142\n\nA: This happened to me when I switched off the computer while it was still finishing upgrading to the latest kernel images. I did CTRL-ALT F1, logged in, then sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get dist-upgrade and let it finish to setup.\nAfter rebooting, I was able to login into the destkop again.\n\nA: 20.04 and above:\nOpening a console\nTo open a console, you can press  Ctrl + Alt + f5  or boot into grub recovery mode.\nMethod #1 Removing Old Configuration files.\nAs System 76 support says in their article, you can remove the old configuration files to fix this issue:\n\n*\n\n*Add a new user\n\nsudo adduser test\n\n\n\n*log in as the new user (test)\n\n\n*If the login worked without any issues then there are problems with the configuration files of the main user.\n\n\n*Backup/remove the old configuration files:\nmv ~/.config ~/.config.old\nmv ~/.local ~/.local.old\nmv ~/.cache ~/.cache.old\nmv ~/.nvidia-settings-rc ~/.nvidia-settings-rc.old\nmv ~/.nv ~/.nv.old\nsudo reboot\n\n\n\n*If the configuration files are automatically generated then leave this step:\n\nsudo mkdir ~/.config\nsudo mkdir ~/.local\nsudo mkdir ~/.cache\nsudo mkdir ~/.nv\nsudo mkdir ~/.nvidia-settings-rc\nsudo reboot\n\nNow try logging in with the regular user.\n\nMethod #2 Changing permissions of .Xauthority\n\n*\n\n*Identify the permissions of the file by running (run this in your home directory):\n\nls -lah | grep -i Xauthority\n\n\n\n*You should see the file listed with the permissions first, followed by the username and group that own it. If you see “root” listed there, you’ve found the source of the problem.\n\n\n*Give proper permissions:\nsudo chown username:username .Xauthority\n\nchange \"username\" with your username.\n\nRemoving Gnome shell extensions\nSometimes a corrupted gnome-shell extension can also cause this issue. Removing the extensions will help:\nsudo rm -r ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/*\n\n\nResetting gnome\nSometimes, there are problems with configuration files, in that case resetting gnome and its applications will help:\nsudo dconf reset -f /\n\nInstalling correct Nvidia drivers\n\n*\n\n*First, remove all the Nvidia drivers by running:\n\nsudo apt purge nvidia*\n\n\n\n*Auto install the recommended drivers:\n\nsudo ubuntu-drivers autoinstall\n\n\n\n*Install the specific drivers for your device:\n\nubuntu-drivers devices\n# identify the drivers needed \n\nsudo apt install nvidia<version>\n\n\n\n*Try using system76 drivers (optional):\n\nsudo touch /etc/apt/preferences.d/system76-apt-preferences\necho \"Package: *\nPin: release o=LP-PPA-system76-dev-stable\nPin-Priority: 1001\n\nPackage: *\nPin: release o=LP-PPA-system76-dev-pre-stable\nPin-Priority: 1001\" >> /etc/apt/preferences.d/system76-apt-preferences\nsudo apt-add-repository -y ppa:system76-dev/stable\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt install system76-driver-nvidia\nsudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade \n\n\nDisabling AMD Radeon Drivers\nOn newer versions of Ubuntu AMD, GPU chips are not well supported, so sometimes it is causing the issue. Turning it off would help:\nsudo echo blacklist radeon >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\n\nsudo update-initramfs -c -k all\nsudo shutdown -r now\n\n\nReinstalling display manager\nSometimes the display manager needs some troubleshooting, reinstall it:\nsudo apt install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop gdm3 gnome-shell\n\nAfter that run:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm3\n\nSelect the option gdm and press enter.\n\nChanging display managers\nYou can install a new display manager by the following commands:\nsudo apt install lightdm\n### If you want sddm \nsudo apt install sddm\n\nThen run:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure <display manager name> # example lightdm\n\n\n\n\nThanks to System76 support, for letting me use some information (method #1, method #3, and method #4) for letting me use some information from their article.\n\nA: Press Ctrl+ALT+F3. You should be given an unix-style login prompt, so enter your username and password there. From there you should be given a shell (a program that allows you to enter commands, sort of like windows' cmd.exe). Enter these commands and press ENTER (or Return) after writing each one (you will have to enter your password when it shows something like [sudo] password for USERNAME. Note that the password will not show when you are typing it!):\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get -y dist-upgrade\nsudo apt-get -y install fglrx\n\nThen reboot your computer using this command:\nsudo reboot\n\nSee if this works :)\n\nIf this does not work, try going back to the 3rd terminal (Ctrl+ALT+F3), login, and enter this command (pressing ENTER after you have typed it):\nsudo apt-get -y install lxdm\n\nThis will show a DOS-like dialog after a bit. If lxdm is not selected, select it by using the UP and DOWN arrow keys, and press ENTER to accept that selection. Then reboot using the same command as before (sudo reboot).\n\nIf this still doesn't work, go back to the 3rd terminal (ALT+F3), login, and enter this command (same procedure):\nsudo apt-get -y install lubuntu-desktop\n\nThis will install a much lighter desktop environment which should work for now (should enable you to login and use your computer). Once that is done, reboot (sudo reboot), and when you are confronted with the login page, select the Lubuntu environment instead of Ubuntu.\n\nA: Faced the same problem today.\nThe cause was a bit strange to me. xubuntu-desktop was removed, so was ubuntu-desktop. LightDM exited with no error message. Tried lxdm and when I tried to login, it popped up a message saying Xubuntu could not be found.\nReinstalled xubuntu-desktop and it's fixed now. Think apt-get autoremove removed the package.\n\nA: Change to another login screen.\nCtrl+Alt+F2 to open a terminal.\nCtrl+Alt+F7 to go back to the graphic mode.\nType sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm\nIn a graphic screen, select gdm and OK.\nType sudo reboot\n\nA: Just in case changing the access privileges for the files .Xauthority and .IDEauthority with the chown command did not work for you:\nThis solution applies to those who besides having had to change access privileges for the above mentioned files cannot use commands as they used to, i.e. the shell does not find the commands. (This is the reason, why the login command cannot be executed either.)\nType echo $SHELL into your terminal. If you get back /bin/bash, use export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/sbin to temporarily be able to use commands.\nThen open your .profile file, located in your home directory ~, i.e. /home/yourusername with sudo gedit ~/.profile and add the missing paths to PATH, so that it looks like this:\nPATH=/usr/local:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/sbin\nNow reboot your system so that the changes to the environmental variable PATH take effect.\n(If commands are not recognized by your shell, you could also use the equivalent paths to the executables of the commands, e.g., instead of sudo gedit ~/.profile type /usr/bin/sudo  /usr/bin/gedit ~/.profile. The shell tells you the directory to use, i.e. command not found, but the command your are trying to use can be found in /path/to/command's/directory - could be any of the paths you see above.)\n\nA: May you are affected by Bug #1240336 where different permissions are gone after release upgrade.\nOther side effects\n\n\n*\n\n*no guest login\n\n*Synaptic not starting from menu\n\n\nI get login to work when I put the user into the video group or after running sudo chmod a+rw /dev/dri/* in a terminal.\nBut:\n\n\n*\n\n*no sound\n\n*Logout from user menu not working\n\n*running /usr/lib/policykit-1-gnome/polkit-gnome-authentication-agent-1\ngives: polkit-gnome-authentication-agent-1:5805): polkit-gnome-1-WARNING **: Unable to determine the session we are in: No session for pid 5805\n\n\nSolution\nRun sudo pam-auth-update --force in terminal.\nThis solved the described problems in my cases.\n\nA: For me configuration of some packages was off, so running (after ctrl + alt + F3):\nsudo dpkg --configure -a\n\nfixed the problem.\n\nA: If you recently installed indicator-multiload, uninstall it.\nThis problem happened to me after I installed indicator-multiload, so uninstalling it fixed the problem.\n\nA: Solved using these commands:\n sudo apt purge gdm3\n sudo reboot\n sudo apt install gdm3\n sudo service gdm start\n\n\nA: You might be having problems with LightDM, the login manager that comes in Ubuntu by default.  In 12.04 it used to do the same problem you are describing.\nYou can install GDM, an alternative login manager, to get around this:\nAt the login screen, press and hold Ctrl+Alt+F2 to go to the terminal.  Don't be afraid!  Just log in here with your username and password.\nThen, type sudo apt-get install gdm.  Let it install and type sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm and follow the prompts to set it as your login manager.\nPress Ctrl+Alt+F7 to get back to the login screen which should now look different.  Does logging in work?  If it does, your problem is solved!  \nIf it doesn't, go back to the fullscreen terminal (again, Ctrl+Alt+F2) and run sudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm to set LightDM as you login manager again.  Now you know that this is a  problem with your graphics drivers for sure.\n\nA: Your desktop environment is failing to start (it sounds like). I would start by tring to log in as a different user. \nCtrl+Alt+F1 then login \nsudo adduser testing\nOnce the user has been added ctrl+alt+f7 and try to log in as testing. If you can log in as testing then your unity/gnome configuration is borked and should be reset. This Question covers it. I prefer to mv ~/.config ~/.config.old.\n\nA: This is not a direct answer to your case but its more of a general solution to login loops.\nThe problem could be as simple as a wrong command put into the .profile file in the home directory. (Since that file get loaded on logon)\nTo see if that is really the case, press Ctrl Alt F1, and login. Checking the .xsession-errors file in your home directory \n~/.xsession-errors\n\nThis should give some clues about some problematic command. \n\nA: I've pressed Ctrl+Alt+F3 and logged into the shell.\nAfterwards with this command:\nchown username:username .Xauthority \n\nWhere username is my login name, I've solved the problem.\n\nA: I had the same problem after I upgraded to 12.10.Then I came here from Google. I created another user and I could login. \nAs I don't use Unity, I uninstalled lighdm. After reboot, I could login. You can try that.\nGood luck!\n\nA: I have been experiencing the very same problem a couple of times every week and have tried most of solutions given here but the only way I can log back in is by restarting lightdm.\nsudo service lightdm restart.\nThe funny thing is that even after I restrat lightdm, it does not log in on the first attempt but only on my second attempt even though I am entering the right password. I realised this a few weeks ago and I have verified this a few times, making sure that I am not accidentally keying in my password wrong. I am now certain that it does not log me in \nthe first time after restarting lightdm but only on the second attempt!\n\nA: If the other questions do not lead to a solution, my suggestion is to try to follow these steps: \n\n\n*\n\n*Login in character mode with a VC (Virtual Console). That is, Ctrl Alt F1 and your username/password login. Let's call this user original. \n\n*Create a new user. You can use for example: \nadduser newuser --group sudo\n\nto add a new administrative user (that is, a user that can do sudo). \n\n*Try to login as newuser. If it works, you now that the problem is in the specific setup of original user. Otherwise, stop reading here --- the problem is at system level and you'll probably need to reinstall something of the graphic stack. \n\n*Now you can try to search what happened. Compare hidden files in ~original and ~newuser and try to find mismatches. Especially you should search for files not owned by you: \nfind . \\! -user original\n\nand files that are not writable to you (there will be more of them, especially in caches): \nfind . \\! -perm -u=w\n\n\n*You can move suspicious files to a backup (sudo mv whatever whatever-backup) and try to login again. \n\n*Files in /tmp and /var that can be sensible to this problem should be deleted by a reboot --- but sometime there is some remnant over there, too. \nAs a last resort, you can backup the important info of original (not all the home dir! or you'll propagate the problem), and delete and recreate it, although it is better to be able to find where the problem is. \n\nA: In my case the problem was caused by wrong permissions on my home directory.\n1: Boot from a live media (or different linux distro installed on the same system) and open a terminal with Ctrl-Alt-T\n2: Make a temporary mount point and Mount the partition that contains your /home (in my case it was /dev/sda6) \nsudo mkdir /mnt/sda6\nsudo mount /dev/sda6 /mnt/sda6 \n3: check permissions\nsudo ls - la /mount/sda6/\nyou should see an entry username` where username is your username\nFrom this point forward we will use the username tvbox (change this to your username)\nYou should see something like this: \ndrwxr-x--- 67 tvbox tvbox   12288 May  1 07:00 tvbox \nThis indicates that tvbox is a directory and the owner has the required read, write an execute permissions.\n4: correct permissions if incorrect. \nIf the above is incorrect in any way we need to correct it. \nIf data was moved by root you will see root root rather than tvbox tvbox (owners name owners group) This could be referred to as the \"root cause\" ;-)\nTo fix this issue the command `sudo chown -R tvbox:tvbox /mount/sda6/tvbox\nIf somehow the other permissions aren't right you will need to modify them with sudo chmod +rwx tvbox adding read write and execute permissions.(the execute bit on a directory allows you to traverse it.)\n5: reboot the problem OS\n6: login \nIf this doesn't resolve your problem refer to the many other quality answers here.\n\nA: For me following worked.\nType ctrl + alt + F1 and login with your username at command prompt.\nuser@dell$ ls -l ~/.ICEauthority\n-rw------- root root 3668 May 28 09:28 /home/user/.ICEauthority\nuser@dell$ sudo chmod 777 ~/.ICEauthority\npassword:\nuser@dell$ ls -l ~/.ICEauthority\n-rwxrwxrwx root root 3668 May 28 09:28 /home/user/.ICEauthority\n\nctrl + alt + F7 and login worked.\n\nA: I've experienced this issue on a Xenial installed on a usb key, mounted on a HD-less laptop, running unity and gnome-flashback.\nTried about every workaround in here without success, then remembered that some days ago, while in chroot and using qemu, if I choose gnome-flashback-compiz I got the issue while with unity I didn't. Tried with gnome-flashback-metacity and it worked.\nIn this case too, it doesn't work with gnome-flashback-compiz but with gnome-flashback-metacity and with unity it worked.\nSilvia\n\nA: In my case, my user folder somehow got chown'ed by root!  The answer lies in .Xauthority and other files in your home folder; if user config data can't be opened read/write, lightdm will fail.\nI simply ctrl+f1, logged in, then sudo chown /home/<userdir>, then sudo service lightdm restart (may not be necessary), and then I was able to get back in.\nSome diagnostic messages would be more useful, but such is life with free software.\n\nA: Regarding Gnome Users:\nI tried all of these optionals to no avail. Likely due to using Gnome as my preferred UI. \nAfter looking at Sooth's Answer I was able to get it to login with the ubuntu and xubuntu GUI, so his post helped a spark in my brain.\nI didn't see anything related to Gnome, so I looked up some instections and followed this guide from OMG Ubuntu for Gnome 3.2 on Ubuntu 16.04. \nI had Gnome working flawlessly so I have no clue what went wrong one day. It's a bit of a download and upgrades but this worked for me with Gnome and I'm happy without the login loop of death!\n\nA: I found another way to cause a login loop not covered by any of these answers, yay me!\nI had a script to set up my dual monitors that was referenced in /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf as a session-setup-script.  When I went to a single monitor config, I deleted the script, but did not remove the reference.  Next time I booted up - login loop.\nExamining the logfile in /var/log/lightdm/lightdm.log I found an explicit error message telling me the script was not found and therefore lightdm failed to start.  Commenting out the reference in lightdm.conf fixed it.\n\nA: After reading James answer , I realized I had changed the user password by logging in as root. I knew the old password, so I logged in as root again ( to login as root press ctrl+alt+F3 give the username as root and and enter your root password) and changed the password for that user to old one by below command\npasswd <username>\nNow change the password to old one , press ctrl+alt+F7 and login normally.\nThis solution works only if you have encrypted home directory issue and incase you had changed password using root.\n\nA: I had a similar issue recently. Ubuntu made some updates and i got this login-loop that seemed to be related to lightdm.\nI finally managed to solve the issue after trying several things.\nI suspect amdgpu to be the reason of failure but because i dont know for sure, i am going to post everything, that i tried:\nTaken from my original question on askubuntu: See here\n\n\n*\n\n*uninstall amdgpu-pro (amdgpu-pro-uninstall)\n\n*install the open source driver (see here). I also installed all those *hwe* packages.\n\n*reinstall and reconfigure lightdm, ubuntu-dektop, unity\n\n\nAt this point - after rebooting - my keyboard would not respond anymore, so i booted into recovery mode and selected the option to repair broken packages, which worked and i could use my keyboard again.\nUnfortunately the login still would not work. Additionally i added my user to the lightdm group, but i doubt that is of any importance.\nThen i found other similar issues and tried the following steps:\n# as root\nadd-apt-repository ppa:paulo-miguel-dias/pkppa\napt-get update\napt-get upgrade\nreboot\n\nStill no success so far, so i decieded to try another upgrade method\n# as root\napt full-upgrade\nreboot\n\nAnd then i was able to login again.\nMy personal conclusion\nIt seems the problem exists within the amdgpu driver and ubuntu will not be able to install a working driver unless you add the ppa mentioned above. It says to work only with Ubuntu 18.04 but i tried it anyway and it worked for now.\n\nA: Same problem on multiple RPIs (version 2B and 3). Solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*check the .xsession-errors file: cat ~/.xsession-errors. Mine showed:\n\n\n\nXsession: X session started for pi at ****\nXsession: unable to start X session --- no \"/home/pi/.xsession\" file, no \n  \"/home/pi/.Xsession\" file, no session managers, no window managers, and no \n  terminal emulators found; aborting.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*to solve this reinstall the following packages:\n\n\nsudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-core xserver-xorg-input-all \\\nxserver-xorg-video-fbdev libx11-6 x11-common \\\nx11-utils x11-xkb-utils x11-xserver-utils xterm lightdm openbox\n\nSource: https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=154190\nfyi:\nI used the RPIs before with auto-login and non-gui mode. Thus, I reinstalled lightdm and ended up at the login loop problem after switching to auto-login GUI mode (raspi-config).\n\nA: GNOME-Shell extensions installed to user's profile were apparently causing the login-loop in case of Bionic Beaver installation here.\nUser is able to again successfully login to its graphical environment not until removal of all of GNOME-Shell extensions installed to user profile. Found then removed from Bash had been ext-helper@amanda.darkdna.net and workspace-grid@mathematical.coffee.gmail.com.\nI believe to had found that track by examining systemd journal, there was also a signal in web addressing Gnome shell extensions in this or close context.\nProblems started to occur after installation of security and basic updates in calender week #3 of 2019. Actually no reconfiguration at system level was conducted by user that time.\nNow two system-level GNOME-extensions are left because no way was found to uninstall them too. However these are set to disabled. Extensions' main switch is also put to OFF. Maybe middle or long term I will try to use extensions again, however by progressing with caution and in small steps.\nConsequently none of hints found here could help as the underlying points were OK, e.g. ~/.XAuthority, ~/.ICEAuthority, /tmp directory, Nvidia stack.\nlightdm-based approach was undesired as in this case Ubuntu 18.04 is used which does not use lightdm as default.\nIt is installation running in VmWare-hypervisor so the emulated graphic card is not from Nvidia. Those hints could not be applied too nor help.\nI was also unable to find in ~/xsession-errors directive hints.\nI found Rmano's approach interesting and applied that which in consequence uncovered few other interesting points, these will be raised in new Questions.\nAlso Rmano's hint contributed to success in this case. Thank you.\n\nA: If you cannot log in, the disk/partition of your home folder might be full.\nTo find out if your disk/partition is full: press Ctrl + Alt + F3, login and type df. You get information on the used disk space.\n\nA: I'm sure nobody except someone with an extreme case of the issue will see this, but if you do... maybe this will help!  :)\nAdding to the current answers - and building off of them to a large extent, I have once or twice had the problem that files other than .Xauthority are owned by root for some reason.  This can create login loops, problems with secondary monitors, and a host of other issues.  To locate suspect files, run:\nuser@hostname:~$ find -user root\n\nFrom there, you kind of have to fish around in the output and see if you can't locate something that looks unusual.\nAs a side note, it also shows if .Xauthority is owned by root...\n\nA: In my case, this was caused by a newly installed software through the Software center (or whatever its called) called Brightness Control (Xrandr). So I logged into Ubuntu using Unity from the logging window and then I opened up the Software Center to uninstall it. After rebooting I could log into Ubuntu (Gnome).\n\nA: There is another possible cause for this problem not covered in the other answers: \nIf your homefolder is encrypted and you changed the user password without changing the encryption password.\nIn this case when you login, your password will not be the same as the encryption password and your home folder cannot be loaded. As a result, your .Xauthority file will not be able to be loaded, and you won't even find it if you try to as suggested in @SiddharthaRT's and many others' answers.\n(As a hint if you don't remember if your home folder was encrypted, if you do ls -lA you should see some files with \"encrypt\" in their name and a folder called .Private if your home folder was encrypted.)\nYou have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*The easiest is to reinstate your old user password, using\nsudo passwd user\n\nwhere user is your username. Then you'll be able to login as normal again. However, if you changed your user password you probably have a reason for this, so the 2nd option is better.\n\n*Rewrap (i.e. change) your encryption password, as explained here. Basically, to do this (assuming you have kept your new user password), mount your encrypted home folder as follows\necryptfs-mount-private\n\nand then set the encryption password to the new password with\necryptfs-rewrap-passphrase ~/.ecryptfs/wrapped-passphrase\n\nThen everyting should be mounted as normal again.\n\nA: I got into the login loop by running the software updater for 18.04 on Jan 30 2019.  It was very hard to get into terminal mode per Ctrl+Alt+F1 or F2 or F3, succeeding typically only after a number of reboots.  Getting into terminal mode per Ctrl+Alt+F3 became reliable only after installing lightdm and switching to that as suggested in the popular answer above.  The other standard recipes (check ownership of .Xauthority and .ICEauthority and permissions of /tmp) were in order and mucking with the nvidia driver didn't help.  After much googling I found Khalil Laleh's suggestion at Ubuntu 18.04 Login window loop to check your gnome extensions. Bingo! In my case Zakkak's workspace grid = 'workspace-grid@mathematical.coffee.gmail.com' in directory ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions needed to be removed to make Ubuntu finally start up, and then reinstallation from https://extensions.gnome.org restored my workspace layout.\n\nA: I ran into a similar problem on both my office linux installation and home machine. I installed a program which required compilation and the executable file was in the bin directory of the program's folder. I exported the PATH, but on booting the normal /bin /usr/bin ... was replaced by my mistake, so the path to bin was only my programs/bin folder. Hence it went to login loop\nOnce I removed my added path, it started booting normally.\nAnother user -xpioneer had pointed  out the problem.\nI am just reproducing below--\n\"There is one more possible reason . If you mess up the /etc/environment file then also it can happen. To fix . do ctrl+alt_+F3 and login to session. check if you can run any shell command. if not then that's the problem. – \"\nxpioneer\nDec 7, 2019 at 4:28\n", "Q: Can Tutorial \"Dual Boot Windows 7 & Ubuntu 12.04\" Used for Dual Booting Windows 8 & Ubuntu 12.10? I previously used this tutorial to dual boot Windows 7 and Ubuntu 12.04 perfectly. Now I have upgraded my Windows 7 to Windows 8. And I would like to do a fresh install (and start all over again like the tutorial) of Ubuntu 12.10 replacing existing Ubuntu 12.04. I like the way the tutorial presents thus can anyone kindly let me know if the tutorial is compatible with what I wanna do now?\nI have tried doing little research whether this has been asked, but all I got are not too similar to my question, if there are topics like this I do apologise and feel free to close it.\nHope to hear from the community. Thank you so much. :)\n\nA: I'm not familiar with Windows 8 but the principle should be the same.\nBut since you already had Ubuntu on this machine, it might be that the partitioning is still there, unless you installed Windows 8 on the entire disc.\nHowever, upgrading Windows would have erased Grub (the bootloader) from the MBR.\nIf this is the case, then you can recover your present Ubuntu 12.04 by booting from an Ubuntu live DVD, install boot-repair, and fix Grub.\nThen you can upgrade Ubuntu instead of installing from scratch.\nIn the case you repartitioned your disc during Windows 8 upgrade then the lin you mentioned should be the way to go.\n", "Q: How do I install Kodos in 12.10? In previous Ubuntu version I used Kodos extensively. But the package has been dropped in 12.10.\nIt's a neat regular expression testing tool. It's hard to find an alternative that is not Windows only (or Air, or uses action script which bails on more complicated RegEx, or works in Wine - well kinda, but not really..., etc.). \nSo I tried to install Kodos from source, which seems to work (download sourceball and setup.py) but it won't run because of missing PyQT dependencies (that I can't manage to fulfill with anything install-able trough standard packages). I then tried to install PyQT manually (which seems to require manual install of SIP and QT too) and instead of pip I have to use configure.py and qmake. It throws error after error at me. I tried to overcome one after another for over an hour but no luck.\nIt even managed to break Calibre and Music Brains Picard. So I purged all the stuff, reinstalled python-sipand python-qt4 from the standard packages and gave up.\nHas anyone managed to get Kodos running on 12.10? Or any hints on how to do it?\n\nA: You can't get it to work easily. Kodos still uses the very ancient Qt3 which is dropped in Quantal. Debian already dropped it in May. See Debian bug #604359. Quoting:\n\nOne year and a half later, it is about time to remove Qt3 and python-qt3.\n  Please, migrate to the Qt4 version (if existing) or file for removal of your\n  package.\n\nTalk with the developers of Kodos in order to get it fixed. Depending on Qt3 is a dead end nowadays. And that's why installing Qt4 packages isn't helping you.\n", "Q: Creating block devices for openstack deployment using MAAS and juju (nova-volume deployment) I'm currently trying to get a openstack deployment working by using MAAS with 9 nodes and juju. To do this I found this guide, working with ubuntu 12.04 LTS and followed it as good as I can.\nAfter a vigorous amount of trial and error I finally got to the point where I'm supposed to deploy nova-volume using the \"custom\" config file. However, when my node is started and shows up as running in the juju status report the service reports the installation failed. I'm trying to install with juju jitsu by the way. I think it has something to do with the following statement in the openstack.cfg file:\nnova-volume:\n# This must be a free block device that is writable on the nova-volume host.\nblock-device: \"xvdb\"\noverwrite: \"true\"\n\nI did some research and found that (at least I think) this refers to a Xen Virtual Drive/Device, and because the device is not present on the node it's being deployed to, the installation fails. What I don't understand is how am I supposed to have such a block device available on a machine which was completely managed by MAAS. Does anyone here have any experience with this and knows of a way to solve this or am I missing something big here. Some kind of missing link between the MAAS and a separate XEN host? My MAAS server is running Ubuntu 12.04LTS Server.\n\nA: You can set the block device to be a file location.\nIf you look at the nova-volume charm readme here:\nhttp://jujucharms.com/charms/precise/nova-volume\nYou can see that you can set the block device to /path/to/file[|size]\nSo, you can configure your openstack.cfg file with something like:\nnova-volume:\n    # This must be a free block device that is writable on the nova-volume host.\n    block-device: \"/var/lib/nova-volume/volume-1.img|100G\"\n    overwrite: \"true\"\n\nThis avoids the necessity to have a separate hardware device, but of course, is not ideal for a high performance production environment.\n", "Q: Installing wifi driver on late macbook 2011 with ubuntu 12.10 I followed the directions on Installing Ubuntu 12.10 on Macbook Pro Retina (10,1)\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install b43-fwcutter\nwget http://www.lwfinger.com/b43-firmware/broadcom-wl-5.100.138.tar.bz2\ntar -xf broadcom-wl-5.100.138.tar.bz2\nsudo b43-fwcutter -w /lib/firmware broadcom-wl-5.100.138/linux/wl_apsta.o\nsudo reboot\n\nWhen i try to do step three I get:\ntar: broadcom-wl-5.100.138.tar.bz2: Cannot open: No such file or directory\ntar: Error is not recoverable: exiting now\n\nEven though I downloaded the file thrice in Firefox and even extracted it in the archive manager.

I would like to be able to install XFCE to run alongside unity so I can choose, upon startup, which DE I use, without breaking any features of either DE.\nFollowing this: Xubuntu 14.04 Trusty Tahr: a classic beauty\n\nNote: don't install Nautilus in Xubuntu! This will cause system\n  conflicts.\n\nI don't want to affect ANY of the features in Unity, i.e. I want to be able to use the two interchangeably, so I can't follow some suggestions of just cleaning out all the old stuff as that would mean using Unity would be changed.\nCan I install Unity aside with XFCE and switch them as I want? Is this possible in 12.04?\n\nA: Just install xubuntu-desktop and it should work :). It should not conflict anything (never did for me).\n\nA: There are no conflicts between XFCE and Unity, and Nautilus works perfectly fine on Xubuntu 12.04 and 12.10.\nIf you wish to install XFCE in Ubuntu, install either xubuntu-desktop (for XFCE + Xubuntu branding + all Xubuntu default apps), or just xfce by itself if you don't want to end up with two sets of default apps.\nsudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop\n\nor\nsudo apt-get install xfce4\n\nAdditionally - and I stress that this is based only on my own personal experience on one laptop - I've found that Xubuntu boots and runs much more quickly than Ubuntu whether Unity is installed or not. Based on this experience, I always prefer to install Unity on Xubuntu instead of XFCE on Ubuntu if I want an OS with both desktop environments. You may wish to try the same next time you reinstall your OS and see if you notice any performance improvements.\n", "Q: No sound after video card replaced (AMD Radeon HD 7770) Issue:  no sound\nSystem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Dual boot\n\n*\n\n*Windows 7 (sda)\n\n*Ubuntu 12.04 (sdb) \n\n\n*2 harddrives \n\n*Dell XPS 730\n\n*Video card:  AMD Radeo HD 7770 Diamond Multimedia \n\n*Sound card: Creative Labs SB X-Fi\n\n\nAdditional info:\n\n\n*\n\n*My sound used to work.\n\n*Then, my old video card (NVIDIA geforce 280) died.  \n\n*I bought and installed a new video card:  Radeon HD 7770.  \n\n*After this, my sound no longer worked in ubuntu (Win7 audio still works).  \n\n*Everything else in ubuntu, such as video, works fine.  \n\n*I suspect it has something to do with the fact that the Radeon card includes sound capability.\n\n\nProblem Details:\n\n\n*\n\n*If I click on System Settings -> Sound, the panel freezes and stops responding indefinitely.\n\n*The sound volume icon at the top of the screen (by the clock) shows 3 dashes beside it \"---\", and an empty drop-down box shows if I click on it.\n\n*(Possibly related to 1.)

This post is a partial solution to your problem in that, at least, your system will be running, but it will disable ALL usb sound-devices.  \nIn /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf, add this line to the end of the file:\nblacklist snd-usb-audio\n\nThis solution lets me us my laptop very nicely now w/ AMD video acceleration, but w/o USB sound devices.  A better solution would be  some way to selectively disable USB devices on the AMD Radeon card, since the driver seems to be broken.\n\nA: you can uninstall and reinstall the gnome-sound-applet\nit may help \nopen youe terminal and type \n  sudo apt-get install --reinstall gnome-sound-applet\n\nit will uninstall the gnome-sound-applet and reinstall it .\n\nA: I had this identical problem.  I worked around it by adding the line:\nblacklist snd-hda-codec-hdmi\n\nto /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf.  This is similar to user1798721's solution except that the problem is the HDMI sound device, apparently, not a USB sound device.\nOf course, this disables the HDMI sound output. In my case, I am outputting the sound via SPDIF digital from the motherboard sound device to my sound system and only using HDMI for the video, so there is no loss.  But it would be nice to get this fixed.  Older kernel versions do not seem to have this problem on the same hardware.\n", "Q: Using ACLs with SSHFS I've been working on setting up a home fileserver for my family.  I use samba over the LAN and SSHFS for anyone connecting via the internet.  So far samba is working perfectly and SSHFS works, but files created/copied with SSHFS have the wrong permissions.  I have a separate partition where files are stored with a structure like:  \nUser A\nUser B\nShared\nI use ACLs so that the different users can see and access but not change files in each other's folders, but everyone can see and edit files in the Shared folder.  Additionally, I have set the ACL defaults such that any folders and files that are created or copied into the folders on the server inherit the proper permissions.  This works fine with samba, but when I connect via SSHFS any files created or copied to the server keep the client's permissions.\nIs there an option to correct this when I mount the server's drive via SSHFS?  Or does SSHFS simply not support ACLs?  If the latter, is there a workaround/patch/alternative?   \nThanks in advance, and let me know if you need any more information.\nAdditional information:\nAll users have local (on the server) accounts\nAll users have the same primary group\nAll users can connect via SSH and SSHFS with public keys\nWith samba, if a client folder has, say, drwx------ permissions and I copy it to the Shared folder, it's permissions (for the contents as well) will be changed to drwXrwXrwX (which is what I want), and if copied to a User file they will change to drwXr-X---  \nEdit:\nTried switching back to passwords instead of public keys for SSH and SSHFS as per GaryBishop's suggestion.\n\nA: I had a similar problem with AFS. Perhaps my solution will work for you.\nIf I logged in to the remote system using a public key, I didn't get a token and thus ACLs did not work. But if I logged in with my password, I got the token and everything worked.\nSSHFS, is just logging in using SSH. I set things up to require a password when connecting with SSHFS and my issues went away. \nTo test this, simply login with SSH and see if the ACLs work properly. \n", "Q: See output from another user account So here's the setup:\nI have a remote computer running a program directly in CLI from user account NN. If I SSH into the same user account NN, is it possible to see the output of the program running in the first user account instance from the second instance?\n\nA: Unless the program is logging its output into a file, I'd say \"no, not directly\".\nHowever, there is a way of achieving what you want. Use screen, which is a virtual console multiplexer:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Screen\n(You can also use tmux which is more modern, but I'm not familiar with that so my answer will talk about screen).\nOnce you get screen installed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Log into the remote system.\n\n*Start screen (just type screen, then read the intro screen, press space).\n\n*You'll see what looks like a standard command prompt. It is, however it lives inside one of screen's virtual consoles. \n\n*Start your program here.\n\n*When you want to leave your program working and log out, first \"detach\" screen. This \"detaches\" it from your actual terminal but screen (and the program contained inside it) continue running. The program thinks it's connected to an actual terminal so it will see no difference. To do this, press ctrl-a, then d (ctrl-a is screen's control prefix). You'll go back to a command prompt.\n\n*To reconnect to a running screen instance, type screen -rd. This will bring back screen and your running program.\n\n\nYou can of course detach and then log out entirely. When you log back in, you just screen -rd to get your \"session\" back.\nScreen can do a lot more than that, you can have multiple \"consoles\" open, switch between them, copy and paste data, and even use split views and fancy stuff like that.\n", "Q: How do I stop color changes when quitting vi from a terminal emulator? I have a problem with colors when using vi under Ubuntu 12.04.\nI'm connecting to my Ubuntu server from a PC, using PowerTerm terminal\nemulation software.  I have PowerTerm set up to display black text on\na grey background.\nWhen I connect to the Ubuntu box, the screen is fine.  When I open a file with vi, the screen is fine.  The text is black on a gray background, which is normal for my PowerTerm setup.  However, if the file is less than a full screen long, the remainder of the screen is a black background.  When I quit vi, the entire background turns black, and the text becomes white.  I have to do a Terminal Reset to restore my\nnormal text and background colors.\nWhat I want is for there to be no change at all when I use vi.  The text should be black and the background grey.  I have another server loaded with RedHat 9, and that acts normally; colors don’t change when using vi.\nHere is my .vimrc file:\nset compatible\nsyntax off\nlet g:loaded_matchparen=1\nset nocp\nset noincsearch\nset nohlsearch\nset noshowmatch\nset bg=dark\n\nI've tried set bg=dark and set bg=light.  It makes no difference.  Is there some other set command that would clear this up for me, or some TERM setting (my TERM is set to linux)?\n\nA: You just need to keep the TERM setting same in both the computers. So just change it to whatever is in the server.\nNote that you should keep the set t_Co=256 setting in .vimrc for it to work properly, esp when connected remotely.\n", "Q: How to tinker with /dev contents when I do ls for /dev; I get the following output\nloop5               sda       tty24  tty58      ttyS4\n..               loop6               sda1      tty25  tty59      ttyS5\nalarm            loop7               sda2      tty26  tty6       ttyS6\nashmem           loop-control        sda3      tty27  tty60      ttyS7\nautofs           mapper              sda4      tty28  tty61      ttyS8\nbinder           mcelog              sda5      tty29  tty62      ttyS9\nblock            mem                 sda6      tty3   tty63      ttyUSB0\nbsg              net                 sdb       tty30  tty7       ttyUSB1\nbtrfs-control    network_latency     serial    tty31  tty8       ttyUSB2\nbus              network_throughput  sg0       tty32  tty9       ttyUSB3\ncdrom            null                sg1       tty33  ttyprintk  ttyUSB4\ncdrw             oldmem              sg2       tty34  ttyS0      .udev\nchar             port                shm       tty35  ttyS1      uinput\nconsole          ppp                 snapshot  tty36  ttyS10     urandom\ncore             psaux               snd       tty37  ttyS11     v4l\ncpu              ptmx                sr0       tty38  ttyS12     vcs\ncpu_dma_latency  pts                 stderr    tty39  ttyS13     vcs1\ndisk             ram0                stdin     tty4   ttyS14     vcs2\ndri              ram1                stdout    tty40  ttyS15     vcs3\ndvd              ram10               tty       tty41  ttyS16     vcs4\ndvdrw            ram11               tty0      tty42  ttyS17     vcs5\necryptfs         ram12               tty1      tty43  ttyS18     vcs6\nfb0              ram13               tty10     tty44  ttyS19     vcsa\nfd               ram14               tty11     tty45  ttyS2      vcsa1\nfull             ram15               tty12     tty46  ttyS20     vcsa2\nfuse             ram2                tty13     tty47  ttyS21     vcsa3\nfw0              ram3                tty14     tty48  ttyS22     vcsa4\nhpet             ram4                tty15     tty49  ttyS23     vcsa5\n.initramfs       ram5                tty16     tty5   ttyS24     vcsa6\ninput            ram6                tty17     tty50  ttyS25     vga_arbiter\nkmsg             ram7                tty18     tty51  ttyS26     vhost-net\nlog              ram8                tty19     tty52  ttyS27     video0\nloop0            ram9                tty2      tty53  ttyS28     zero\nloop1            random              tty20     tty54  ttyS29\nloop2            rfkill              tty21     tty55  ttyS3\nloop3            rtc                 tty22     tty56  ttyS30\nloop4            rtc0                tty23     tty57  ttyS31\n\nI would like to understand the meaning of the entries listed here. Is there a manual available to help me understand this ?\n\nA: In short: All of the are device entries. So anything written to these items will (should) have the corresponding hardware act on it.\n\nLonger copy/paste with lots of examples: \nThe /dev directory contains the special device files for all the devices. The device files are created during installation, and later with the /dev/MAKEDEV script. The /dev/MAKEDEV.local is a script written by the system administrator that creates local-only device files or links (i.e. those that are not part of the standard MAKEDEV , such as device files for some non-standard device driver).\nThis list which follows is by no means exhaustive or as detailed as it could be. Many of these device files will need support compiled into your kernel for the hardware. Read the kernel documentation to find details of any particular device.\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/dsp\n\n\nDigital Signal Processor. Basically this forms the interface between software which produces sound and your soundcard. It is a character device on major node 14 and minor 3.\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/fd0\n\n\nThe first floppy drive. If you are lucky enough to have several drives then they will be numbered sequentially. It is a character device on major node 2 and minor 0.\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/fb0\n\n\nThe first framebuffer device. A framebuffer is an abstraction layer between software and graphics hardware. This means that applications do not need to know about what kind of hardware you have but merely how to communicate with the framebuffer driver's API (Application Programming Interface) which is well defined and standardized. The framebuffer is a character device and is on major node 29 and minor 0.\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/hda\n\n\n/dev/hda is the master IDE drive on the primary IDE controller. /dev/hdb the slave drive on the primary controller. /dev/hdc , and /dev/hdd are the master and slave devices on the secondary controller respectively. Each disk is divided into partitions. Partitions 1-4 are primary partitions and partitions 5 and above are logical partitions inside extended partitions. Therefore the device file which references each partition is made up of several parts. For example /dev/hdc9 references partition 9 (a logical partition inside an extended partition type) on the master IDE drive on the secondary IDE controller. The major and minor node numbers are somewhat complex. For the first IDE controller all partitions are block devices on major node 3. The master drive hda is at minor 0 and the slave drive hdb is at minor 64. For each partition inside the drive add the partition number to the minor minor node number for the drive. For example /dev/hdb5 is major 3, minor 69 (64 + 5 = 69). Drives on the secondary interface are handled the same way, but with major node 22.\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/ht0\n\n\nThe first IDE tape drive. Subsequent drives are numbered ht1 etc. They are character devices on major node 37 and start at minor node 0 for ht0 1 for ht1 etc.\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/js0\n\n\nThe first analogue joystick. Subsequent joysticks are numbered js1 , js2 etc. Digital joysticks are called djs0 , djs1 and so on. They are character devices on major node 15. The analogue joysticks start at minor node 0 and\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/lp0\n\n\nThe first parallel printer device. Subsequent printers are numbered lp1 , lp2 etc. They are character devices on major mode 6 and minor nodes starting at 0 and numbered sequentially.\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/loop0\n\n\nThe first loopback device. Loopback devices are used for mounting filesystems which are not located on other block devices such as disks. For example if you wish to mount an iso9660 CD ROM image without burning it to CD then you need to use a loopback device to do so. This is usually transparent to the user and is handled by the mount command. Refer to the manual pages for mount and losetup . The loopback devices are block devices on major node 7 and with minor nodes starting at 0 and numbered sequentially.\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/md0\n\n\nFirst metadisk group. Metadisks are related to RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) devices. Please refer to the most current RAID HOWTO at the LDP for more details. This can be found at http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Software-RAID-HOWTO.html . Metadisk devices are block devices on major node 9 with minor nodes starting at 0 and numbered sequentially.\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/mixer\n\n\nThis is part of the OSS (Open Sound System) driver. Refer to the OSS documentation at http://www.opensound.com for more details. It is a character device on major node 14, minor node 0.\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/null\n\n\nThe bit bucket. A black hole where you can send data for it never to be seen again. Anything sent to /dev/null will disappear. This can be useful if, for example, you wish to run a command but not have any feedback appear on the terminal. It is a character device on major node 1 and minor node 3.\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/psaux\n\n\nThe PS/2 mouse port. This is a character device on major node 10, minor node 1.\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/pda\n\n\nParallel port IDE disks. These are named similarly to disks on the internal IDE controllers (/dev/hd* ). They are block devices on major node 45. Minor nodes need slightly more explanation here. The first device is /dev/pda and it is on minor node 0. Partitions on this device are found by adding the partition number to the minor number for the device. Each device is limited to 15 partitions each rather than 63 (the limit for internal IDE disks). /dev/pdb minor nodes start at 16, /dev/pdc at 32 and /dev/pdd at 48. So for example the minor node number for /dev/pdc6 would be 38 (32 + 6 = 38). This scheme limits you to 4 parallel disks of 15 partitions each.\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/pcd0\n\n\nParallel port CD ROM drives. These are numbered from 0 onwards. All are block devices on major node 46. /dev/pcd0 is on minor node 0 with subsequent drives being on minor nodes 1, 2, 3 etc.\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/pt0\n\n\nParallel port tape devices. Tapes do not have partitions so these are just numbered sequentially. They are character devices on major node 96. The minor node numbers start from 0 for /dev/pt0 , 1 for /dev/pt1 , and so on.\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/parport0\n\n\nThe raw parallel ports. Most devices which are attached to parallel ports have their own drivers. This is a device to access the port directly. It is a character device on major node 99 with minor node 0. Subsequent devices after the first are numbered sequentially incrementing the minor node.\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/random or /dev/urandom\n\n\nThese are kernel random number generators. /dev/random is a non-deterministic generator which means that the value of the next number cannot be guessed from the preceding ones. It uses the entropy of the system hardware to generate numbers. When it has no more entropy to use then it must wait until it has collected more before it will allow any more numbers to be read from it. /dev/urandom works similarly. Initially it also uses the entropy of the system hardware, but when there is no more entropy to use it will continue to return numbers using a pseudo random number generating formula. This is considered to be less secure for vital purposes such as cryptographic key pair generation. If security is your overriding concern then use /dev/random , if speed is more important then /dev/urandom works fine. They are character devices on major node 1 with minor nodes 8 for /dev/random and 9 for /dev/urandom .\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/sda\n\n\nThe first SCSI drive on the first SCSI bus. The following drives are named similar to IDE drives. /dev/sdb is the second SCSI drive, /dev/sdc is the third SCSI drive, and so forth.\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/shm/\n\n\nBy default Ubuntu has ramdisk mounted into /dev/shm/ directory so you can just copy/move files into that dir and be sure they’ll be stored in RAM memory. That could be useful for, say, video conversion when both input and output files are stored in ramdisk — resulting performance will be better as read and write speeds are higher for ram than for hdd or any other storage. This is due to the fact CPU cannot access to HDD directly while it can do it with RAM.\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/ttyS0\n\n\nThe first serial port. Many times this it the port used to connect an external modem to your system.\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/vcs /dev/vcsa \n\n\nvirtual console memory. /dev/vcs0 is a character device with major number 7 and minor number 0, usually of mode 0644 and owner root.tty.  It refers to the memory of the currently displayed virtual console terminal. /dev/vcs[1-63] are character devices for virtual console terminals, they have major number 7 and minor number 1 to 63, usually mode 0644 and owner root.tty. /dev/vcsa[0-63] are the same, but using unsigned shorts (in host byte order) that include attributes, and prefixed with four bytes giving the screen dimensions and cursor position: lines, columns, x, y.  (x = y = 0 at the top left corner of the screen.)\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/zero\n\n\nThis is a simple way of getting many 0s. Every time you read from this device it will return 0. This can be useful sometimes, for example when you want a file of fixed length but don't really care what it contains. It is a character device on major node 1 and minor node 5.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Not a complete list but it shows the gist of these items. \n\n*Large part of it from: linux.about.com. The others by using google ;)\n\n", "Q: Palm Centro not even appearing on desktop Background: I'm trying to set up my dad's new installation of Xubuntu 12.10 (I finally got him to switch from Windows :-D) so he can sync his Palm Centro on his computer.

When it's plugged in, it lit up and began to charge when I told it to try and sync with the computer, but it failed the sync and Xubuntu still doesn't recognize it.\nQuestion: Does anyone know how I can get his Palm to be recognized by Xubuntu?\n\nA: The Palm USB connection works only during a hotsync operation.\nSo if you installed Jpilot, try clicking both the hotsync button on your Centro and on Jpilot.\nIf this doesn't sync, open a terminal and type sudo usermod -a -G dialout username changing username with your actual username.\nThen try syncing again as explained above.\n", "Q: Why didn't virtual ubuntu halts clearly?

VM manager does not feel machine is gone, so I need to power off it.\nP.S.\nThe system stops Ok if I shutdown it via GUI.\n\nA: You shouldn't be using halt, especially in a VM. These are the Three Shutdown commands and their meanings:\n\n\n*\n\n*halt brings the system down to its lowest state, but leaves it powered on.\n\n*shutdown brings the system down to its lowest state, and will turn off power (soft power switch) if it can. Most computers now can do so.\n\n*reboot restarts the system. It brings the system down to its lowest state, then starts it up again.\nAs you can see halt only exits the OS, it doesn't Power off the machine. You should use a different command. I recommend you use the sudo shutdown -P now command in Terminal. Or if you want to use the VirtualBox Quit Menu then \"Send the ShutDown Signal\" should work if you have the Power Settings setup right in the VM.\nThat should work fine for you.

I found some terminal commands like this: ffmpeg -i input.avi -acodec libvorbis -ac 1 -b 768k output.ogg\nThe problem with these type of commands is that they are intended to change bit rate, fps, or even resolution.  I would like to just change the file format without changing anything else about the video.\nI looked at the man pages for ffmpeg and found some useful info but I don't know how to space command-line options.\nAre there any easy ways to do this?  In addition, is there a command to change the bit rate so that it doesn't go over a certain rate?\n\nA: You can simply run this to do the conversion.\nffmpeg -i neha.avi -acodec libvorbis output.ogg\n\nDont bother to put any options for bitrate or aspect ratio. It will choose for itself.\nYou can set the max audio bitrate to 192000 (or whatever value you want, upto 320000 AFAIK) by adding -ab 192000 anywhere in the command. Also, you set the video bitrate at say, 1200kb (or any other value), by including -b 1200kb in the command.\nSo here is the command in the end, (the order of options dont matter, since you asked. nothing to worry)\nffmpeg -i neha.avi -acodec libvorbis -ab 192000 -b 1200kb output.ogg\n\nHere is a good guide to all that you might want to do. \n\nA: I don't usually use the terminal for my audio/video conversions.

Thank\n\nA: Well, one could try zero'ing the raw block device to see if that can work. If you can write to that then you may be able to create a clean partition table, create a new partition and format that.\nSuppose the USB stick is on /dev/sdc,  first make sure /dev/sdc1 is unmounted:\numount /dev/sdc1\n\nSee if you can then clear the partition table, say by copying a bunch of zeros over the first few K\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdc bs=512 count=16\n\nIf that works, see if you can write zeros to the whole device without it failing.  To easily see if the kernel can't write to the device, first clear the current kernel messages and throw them away using:\nsudo dmesg -c > /dev/null\n\n..then zero the entire device:\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdc bs=1M\n\n..this will take a while. dd will complete when the raw block device is completely written to, or an error has occurred.\nThen, check to see if the kernel has complained about the device, using:\ndmesg\n\n..if you see a load of error messages then you know that the USB stick is probably not in good condition.\nHowever, if this works fine run fdisk or parted to create the partitions from clean, e.g. with fdisk I use:\nsudo fdisk /dev/sdc\nCommand (m for help): n\nSelect (default p): p\nPartition number (1-4, default 1): 1\nFirst sector (2048-7796735, default 2048): <return>\nLast sector, +sectors or +size{K,M,G} (2048-7796735, default 7796735): <return>\nCommand (m for help): t\nHex code (type L to list codes): 6\nCommand (m for help): w\n\n..note just press return for the First and Last sector questions, fdisk will chose the correct defaults (which will be different to my example above).  And then format the partition with VFAT:\nsudo mkfs.vfat /dev/sdc1\n\nand then remove and re-insert the drive. It should be cleanly formatted.\n\nA: You can simply format it using gparted. If that doesn't work, as documented here, you can :\n\n\n*\n\n*Plug in your USB drive. Watch it appear on your desktop.\n\n*Choose System>Administration>Partition Editor (enter your password)\n\n*In Partition Editor, choose Gparted>Devices, and then the device that corresponds to your flash drive (which I determined by looking at the total size of the disks)\n\n*Unmount the drive: Select it in the list, then choose Partition>Unmount.\n\n*Choose Partition>Check. A window will pop up on the bottom saying that this one task is pending. BE SURE THAT NO OTHER TASKS ARE PENDING.\n\n*Click \"Apply\", and \"Apply\" again in the confirmation dialog window.\n\n*When Gparted is done with the check, it will re-mount the drive and open it in a new window.\n\n", "Q: Network bonding isn't working correctly Hey guys I'm having trouble setting up Ubuntu Bonding, following this guide.\nMy interfaces file looks like this:\nauto eth0  \niface eth0 inet manual  \nbond-master bond0  \n\nauto eth1  \niface eth1 inet manual  \nbond-master bond0  \n\nauto bond0  \nauto iface inet static  \naddress 10.1.10.30  \nnetmask 255.255.255.0  \ndns-nameservers 10.1.10.50  \ngateway 10.1.10.2  \nbond-mode balance-rr  \nbond-miimon 100  \nbond-lacp-rate 1  \nbond-slaves none\n\nI can ping Google and my external static IP from another computer on another ISP (I assigned it a static one-to-one NAT address with the router and also disabled the router's firewall for troubleshooting).

Then I tested with an alias; lo and behold, it works.\nAdd one of these to your alias or rc file (usually, bash_rc tests if .bash_aliases exists and automatically includes it)\nalias subl=\"/opt/Sublime\\ Text\\ 2/sublime_text -w\"\n\nalias sublime=\"/opt/Sublime\\ Text\\ 2/sublime_text -w\"\n\nHowever, if you want to use it in something that uses another shell, particularly Bourne shell, you'll have to exchange the backslashes and wrap the executable in single quotes; example from .muttrc:\nset editor = \"'/opt/Sublime Text 2/sublime_text' -w\"    # Use Sublime Text 2 to compose email.\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu installed along side Win 8 but not shown in boot \nPossible Duplicate:\nCannot boot to Ubuntu, though installation was successful \n\nActually the question says it all, but let me tell you what I did, so u may find exactly what might have went wrong:\nI have Win 8 installed on 500 GB HDD.\nSO I shrunk it four times for:\npartition 1 - the original partition containing Win 8 sys (118GB)\npartition 2 - NTFS formatted for my data (188GB)\npartition 3 - NTFS formatted for my data (100GB)\npartition 4 - NTFS formatted for Linux distro say Ubuntu  (I reformatted it to ext4 during Ubuntu installation) (25GB)\npartition 5 - NTFS formatted for Linux distro (am thinking to try Mint in it) (21GB)\nSo now I booted Ubuntu from USB (created from ubuntu-12.04-desktop-amd64.iso) and \ndeleted last two partitions 4 and 5 to create:\npartition 1 - ext4 where I installed Ubuntu (25GB)\npartition 2 - Swap (4GB)\npartition 3 - unallocated space, not formatted yet (17GB)\nUbuntu installation said it installed successfully and that I have to restart to boot in Ubuntu. But when I restart Windows 8 auto booted - there was no dual boot.\nAfter that I devided above 100GB partition to 80Gb and 20GB ones (since I read online that I should have /home in separate partition for convenience, so I created 20GB partition for it)\nSo I went on to manually create boot entry using EasyBCD as below show in picture at below link\n\nWhen I created the entry, FreeBCD showed the information as follows:\n\nWindows Boot Manager\n--------------------\nidentifier              {9dea862c-5cdd-4e70-acc1-f32b344d4795}\ndevice                  partition=\\Device\\HarddiskVolume2\ndescription             Windows Boot Manager\nlocale                  en-US\ninherit                 {7ea2e1ac-2e61-4728-aaa3-896d9d0a9f0e}\nintegrityservices       Enable\ndefault                 {ea8167ad-d189-11e1-90e4-ab2f09569dcc}\nresumeobject            {ea8167a3-d189-11e1-90e4-ab2f09569dcc}\ndisplayorder            {ea8167ad-d189-11e1-90e4-ab2f09569dcc}\n                        {ea8167b1-d189-11e1-90e4-ab2f09569dcc}\ntoolsdisplayorder       {b2721d73-1db4-4c62-bf78-c548a880142d}\ntimeout                 10\ndisplaybootmenu         Yes\n\nWindows Boot Loader\n-------------------\nidentifier              {ea8167ad-d189-11e1-90e4-ab2f09569dcc}\ndevice                  partition=C:\npath                    \\Windows\\system32\\winload.exe\ndescription             Windows 8\nlocale                  en-US\nosdevice                partition=C:\nsystemroot              \\Windows\nresumeobject            {9bc7fdf7-3ae0-11e2-be77-806e6f6e6963}\n\nReal-mode Boot Sector\n---------------------\nidentifier              {ea8167b1-d189-11e1-90e4-ab2f09569dcc}\ndevice                  partition=C:\npath                    \\NST\\AutoNeoGrub0.mbr\ndescription             Ubuntu\n\n\nNotice the last bolded entry created.\nHowevever after thet, when I rebooted it firstly showed old DOS like bootloader (no Windows 8 UI based bootloader) with two entries Windows and Ubuntu. \nWindows 8 was booting correctly but I was getting an error while booting Ubuntu taking me to GRUB Rescue.\nUpdate:\nNow, I rebuilt Windows bootloader from Windows disk with command bootrec /rebuildbcd. So currently there is no dual boot menu. It loads Windows. Then I booted Ubuntu from Live USB and tried to install GRUB, but it said command not found, so I tried to set path as follows but it did not worked. \nThis occcured: \n\nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo grub \nsudo: grub: command not found ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ \nsudo /sbin/grub \nsudo: /sbin/grub: command not found\n\nIs it like that during installation only Ubuntu was installed on the partition but no GRUB were installed. That may be the reason for the failure of auto GRUB bootloader entry (last entry) created by FreeBCD since it is not able to find GRUB in any partition.\nThis may be the reason for failure of sudo grub.\nSo what should I do next? Please help am new to Linux world.\n\nA: Solved this by using Boot-Repair explained here\n\nA: This happened to me also (the issue with auto-booting into Windows) - I fixed it by disabling Hybrid Boot.\nBeing Windows 8, the steps for doing this are not massivly intuitive, but anyway:\n1) Open Windows Explorer (file browser) on your desktop taskbar\n2) Click in the location bar and type \"Control Panel\" and hit Enter\n3) Type \"Power\" into the search box and click \"Power Options\"\n4) Click \"Choose what closing the lid does\" on the left pane\n5) Find \"Turn on fast startup (recommended)\" and turn it off\n6) Save changes and reboot\nThis worked for me - though I installed Ubuntu 'after' doing this so I don't know if you need to re-install GRUB or not. You shouldn't need to, I don't think, but comment on this if your laptop still won't load Ubuntu and I'll try to help you further :)\n", "Q: Global Menu broken for Gnome Applications after adding GNOME 3 PPA After using the GNOME3 PPA to upgrade Nautilus , (I have been working with it for several days without problems), the Global Menu broke for all Gnome-application, like totem, gnome-terminaL, nautilus 3.4, etc...).\nAt the same time, when I launch any of these applications from terminal, I get the following error:\nGtk-WARNING **: Theme parsing error: gtk-widgets.css:62:17: Theming engine 'unico' not found\n\nI purged the GNOME3 PPA, re-updated, auto-cleaned, dist-upgraded, downgraded Nautilus, reinstalled the gtk3-engines-unico and appmenu, but in vain.\n\nAnyone has a clue of fixing this?\n~$ apt-cache policy gtk3-engines-unico\ngtk3-engines-unico:\n  Installed: 1.0.2+r139-0ubuntu2\n  Candidate: 1.0.2+r139-0ubuntu2\n  Version table:\n *** 1.0.2+r139-0ubuntu2 0\n        500 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ quantal/main amd64 Packages\n        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status\n\n~$ apt-show-versions gtk3-engines-unico\ngtk3-engines-unico/quantal uptodate 1.0.2+r139-0ubuntu2\n\nThe Unico issue seems to be known in RR.13.04.\nI have Installed gtk3-engines-unico from RR-13.04, to see if it fixes the issue but in vain.

A newer version (3.6.2) than the one in quantal archive ( 3.6.0-0ubuntu3.2 ) was still kept in the system. \nActually, the GNOME3 PPA purging when I first did it, was not performed correctly due to a bug in the ppa-purge package in quantal official archives (multi arch bug).

This is what happened  for me and then 6Music played.\nIf Rhythmbox doesn't prompt you to install the necessary packages, I got 6Music playing by installing the following additional packages on 12.04- the packages names might differ on 12.10. This is the list that Rhythmbox recommended, but not all are probably necessary: \nsudo apt-get install libcdaudio1 libflite1 libgme0 libgstreamer-plugins-bad0.10-0 libmimic0 libofa0 libopenspc0 libslv2-9 libspandsp2 libvo-aacenc0 libvo-amrwbenc0 libwildmidi-config libwildmidi1 libzbar0 gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad \n\nThe gstreamer plugins are probably the most important, but installing the whole lot of recommended packages did get 6Music streaming.\n\n\nA: Just to confirm:\nyou opened rhythmbox\nclicked on radio\nclicked the add button\npasted the link http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/listen/live/r6.asx into the box\nclicked on radio again and selected the link?\nif you did this and got the error then try  reinstall of the app.\nensure you have all your settings stored as I can't remember if you'll lose them.\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall rhythmbox \nthen add the link again.\nTo change the title of the station to a recognizable one, right click on the title and click ‘Properties‘.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: How to install Spotify Gnome? I want to have media key support in Spotify, and searching around saw a program called \"Spotify Gnome\" recommended.  But, when I go to the site linked to, I can't figure out where to go to download a .deb, only how to get the source.  Is the only way to compile it myself?!  What repository do I have to add?\nCan anyone give me a quick rundown on how to install Spotify Gnome?\n\nA: As the author of the software, I don't actually use Ubuntu myself, so I don't provide any packages.  However, it's just a simple Python script, so it doesn't need to be compiled at all.\nYou can either download the script itself directly from Github and copy it to /usr/local/bin (make sure to run chmod 755 on the file first), or you can use Git to check out the source code repository and follow the installation instructions in the readme.  I strongly suggest the second method, as it will allow you to do a simple git pull in the repository in the future to update your copy of the script and install it again.\n", "Q: Can't connect nonlocally after 12.10 upgrade I've just upgraded one of my systems from 12.04 to 12.10. Now I can't connect on that system beyond my local network. Connections within the local network seem to work fine, and I can make nonlocal connections from other machines (like the one I'm asking this question from). I suspect that some routing information has been messed up, but I don't know where to look for it. It's not a nameserver problem -- pinging outside sites by their IP addresses doesn't work either.\nI have another laptop next to this one, also running Kubuntu 12.10. On the one that can't connect, arp produces no output. On the other one, it produces\n192.168.0.1 ether 00:23:69:fa:ce:ae C wlan0\n\nOn the working machine, the output of netstat starts with some tcp entries. On the nonworking one, those entries are absent.\nI asked this question on the Ubuntu forum but haven't gotten any answers there.  One further complication: since the troublesome machine has no outside connection, it's extremely difficult to download anything to it.\nFor what it's worth, \"ping 8.8.8.8\" produces \"connect: Network is unreachable\".\nUpdate: after a lot of fiddling, I have my external world back.  I don't know what the key action was, but the first indication of progress was that \"ping 8.8.8.8\" worked.  At that point I still didn't have a working nameserver, so external URLs didn't work.  But I did this (based on an online post, of course):\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure resolvconf\nand answered Yes to all prompts.  That did the trick!!\nApparently my problem was unique, or close to it, since I couldn't find any online references to it: local net working, remote net not working, including explicit IP addresses.  So I suppose that if no one else has this problem, no one cares about the solution!!\n\nA: I was (and am) having a similar problem while connecting to the Internet using my MTS MBlaze (India) dongle which is a ZTE device. I am using Kubuntu 12.10.\nA while back I was only able to connect to the device from Network Manager applet, but a ping to any address including 8.8.8.8 resulted in \"Network is unreachable\". I figured out this could primarily be because of my host not being able to connect to MTS gateway.\nifconfig shows something similar to the following:\nppp0      Link encap:Point-to-Point Protocol  \n          inet addr:180.215.149.123  P-t-P:10.228.10.5  Mask:255.255.255.25\n\nI used the route command to manually add the gateway address (P-t-P in above ifconfig output) as follows:\nsudo route add default gw 10.228.10.5\n\nAnd voila, I was able to ping again, even to google.com (as dongle devices auto configure DNS servers as well); there is no need to change /etc/resolv.conf at all.\nNow I need to figure out how to automate this. Any help most welcome.\n\nA: I had the same problem... I know you said that it's not a nameserver problem, but changing the nameserver entry in /etc/resolv.conf from loopback address to 8.8.8.8 did the trick for me.\n", "Q: Is it possible to reorder my places in Nautilus?

In Windows I can write a file containing commands for cmd (usually .cmd or .bat files).  When I click on those files it will open cmd.exe and run them commands the file contains.\nHow would I do this in Ubuntu?       \nI'm sure this is a duplicate, but I can't find my answer.\nIts similar to these questions, but they don't answer the question:\nStore frequently used terminal commands in a file \nCMD.exe Emulator in Ubuntu to run .cmd/.bat file\n\nA: You mean writing to a file using a shell script? Here are a few ways:\ntouch file\n\nThis method will simply create a file, but if the file already exists, it simply changes the modification date to the time you used that command.\necho \"text\" > file\n\nThat method overwrites the contents of file to text. If you wanted to clear a file, you can simply do this:\necho \"\" > file\n\nSay you want to write more than one line to it, and you don't want to use thousands of echo commands, you would use this command:\ncat << EOF > file\ntest\ntest1\nfoo\nbar\nEOF\n\nThat enables you to write multiple lines in one command. The contents of file would then be this:\ntest\ntest1\nfoo\nbar\n\nIf you wanted to append to a file, replace > to >>.\nHope this helps!\n\nEDIT: Oh, I see, so you would write the file in gedit, using the .sh extension (optional, but it's a good idea), and then on a file manager, right click on the file, select Properties->Permissions, and check Allow executing file as program. Then you can double-click on it and it will run :). Also, if you want to do so in the terminal, you can run this command to make it executable (you might want to prepend sudo if it doesn't belong to you):\nchmod +x file\n\nAnd to run:\n./file\n\n\nA: There are two methods.\nFirst, the most common is to write a file, make sure the first line is \n#!/bin/bash\n\nThen save the file. Next mark it executable using chmod +x file\nThen when you click (or run the file from the terminal) the commands will be executed. By convention these files usually have no extension, however you can make them end in .sh or any other way.\nA few notes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Any (and I mean any) file can be executed in Linux provided the first line is a path to the program that should interpret the file. Common examples include /bin/python,  /bin/sh, /bin/dash, but even odd ball things work like /bin/mysql\n\n*Bash is a full language. It is vastly more complex than cmd.exe in windows. It has a strong programming language that supports functions, loops, conditionals, string operations, etc.\n\n*These documents may help if you run into problems.\n\n*If you do not wish to make the file executable then you can run it by passing it as an argument to bash: bash file/to/run.sh\nA Simple Bash Example\n#!/bin/bash  \necho \"This is a shell script\"  \nls -lah  \necho \"I am done running ls\"  \nSOMEVAR='text stuff'  \necho \"$SOMEVAR\"\n\n\nThe second method is to record commands using script. Run script then just do stuff. When you are done doing stuff type exit and script will generate a file for you with all the \"stuff\" you did. This is less used but works quite well for making things like macros. man script for more info.\n\nA: The equivalent to Windows batch files is shell scripts, and an excellent getting started guide is Bash Scripting.\nFor the most part, commands that you can enter on the command line can be placed in a shell script.\nA couple of things that are different from Windows batch files:\n\n\n*\n\n*There are different command interpretors, called shells. The default is bash, but if you are interested, there are others, such as zsh, ksh, dash, perl, python, etc.\n\n*To run a shell script, you need to make the file executable, which you can do with chmod +x <filename>\n\n*In Ubuntu, the current directory is not the program search path, so you need to run ./<filename>, not <filename>\n\n*Variable names are $<varname>, not %<varname>%\n\n*Commands in a shell script are not printed by default, as in a batch file.\n\n*The filename's extension can be .sh or (more customary) you don't need to use an extension. Put #!/bin/bash on the very first line of the file, which tells Ubuntu what program to use to run the file.\n\n*Comments start with #, not rem.\nHope this helps and have fun scripting!\n", "Q: How to remove bandwidthd 32 bit from 64 bit Xubuntu i downloaded bandwidthd from here and tried to install it using Ubuntu Software Center. \nIt failed,  but still it breaks my Xubuntu.

I want to hook up my ps3 to the net as well, but ps3 doesn't see the internet signal also it is too far to drag an ethernet cable from the router to the ps3. Thus I want to share via my laptop. Ps3 is a bit of a retard and doesn't see Ad-Hoc, so I am gonna try to use ubuntu for this. I wonder is there a way to create infrastructured hotspot . I have successfully created adhoc hotspot between wired and wifi before in ubuntu, but now when I go to create hotspot with my idle wifi it creates it, but I cannot see it, I tried with my android, another pc and ps3, not there.\nWhat would you suggest, thanks\nOr should I rather bridge the connections somehow?\n\nA: I had this problem at my house.  I could not get the ps3 to connect to the hotspot using Ubuntu.  Instead, I dragged my laptop down and connected it to the ps3 and shared my wifi connection to the ps3 over ethernet.  Would it be possible to move your laptop down by the ps3 when you want to play online?  \nBarring that, I would ask if you have tried to find your wireless internet connection manually (not Easy mode)?  I have found that Manual will still find your internet if you manually type in all of your information yourself.  If you need help with putting those settings in the ps3, I would be more than willing to help you over e-mail or on a ps3 forum of your choice.\n", "Q: Lubuntu 12.10 cpu usage sticks at 100% I've upgraded Lubuntu 12.04 to 12.10 via the update manager.

You could change the place were applications are downloaded but when an application is installed files are distributed across the system. You can set a download place or transport applications without installing but you can't have applications installed in a secondary USB drive. Applications installed leave files in several places.\nThe reason why it is done this way in Ubuntu is because in this system applications can share libraries and files. This has a major impact in the size of the system. You can try to compare the amount of space Ubuntu (more accurate, Linux) takes in the hard-drive versus other systems as Mac or Windows.\nIf you are really stubborn there are always ways of some of your plan. But the system won't load without both USB drives connected. It is more advanced but you could just mount a partition to a path on the other pendrive.

Unless you administer these systems, you shouldn't bother about fixing them. You may want to report them to the admins, though.\nOne exception is that if you've configured a proxy server, this may cause trouble as the proxy server will return 5xx error status codes when it runs into problems itself.

The output of free -m is:\n                     total    used    free    shared  buffers  cached\nMem:                  595      482     112         0       63     324\n-/+ buffers/cache:              93     501\nswap:                   0        0       0\n\nWhich value of used memory is correct, 482 or 93?\n\nA: You have 112 MB of completely free memory, BUT the 501 mb you see is without 'cached' memory. This means that the OS has put some stuff in your memory to be quicker. It calls this \"used\" (therefore your 'free' number is only 112), but it is actually available for you if you need it.\nThis is a good thing, because unused memory is useless memory. The cached memory can be cleared if needed. The old \"I need to clean up memory\" stuff people used to do for windows 95 isn't needed here: it's all fine and happy :)\nThe number you are looking for is 501 free (in megabytes because of -m). \nsee for reference these pages:\nhttp://www.linuxatemyram.com/\nhttp://www.itworld.com/it-managementstrategy/280695/making-sense-memory-usage-linux\n\nA: free command shows the information about unused and used memory and swap space.\nBelow is the explanation provided by http://www.linfo.org/free.html \n\nThe first row, labeled Mem, displays physical memory utilization,\n  including the amount of memory allocated to buffers and caches. A\n  buffer, also called buffer memory, is usually defined as a portion of\n  memory that is set aside as a temporary holding place for data that is\n  being sent to or received from an external device, such as a HDD,\n  keyboard, printer or network.\nThe second line of data, which begins with -/+ buffers/cache, shows\n  the amount of physical memory currently devoted to system buffer\n  cache. This is particularly meaningful with regard to application\n  programs, as all data accessed from files on the system that are\n  performed through the use of read() and write() system calls1 pass\n  through this cache. This cache can greatly speed up access to data by\n  reducing or eliminating the need to read from or write to the HDD or\n  other disk.\nThe third row, which begins with Swap, shows the total swap space as\n  well as how much of it is currently in use and how much is still\n  available.\n\nLets analyse the your system's memory usage\nYou have used free command with '-m' option, which is used to display the result in megabytes\n-m, --mega\n              Display the amount of memory in megabytes.\n\nTotal memory is 595(Used+free)\nUsed: 482\nFree: 112\n482MB out of 595MB is used by your system, in which only 93MB is used by active programs and remaining 324MB are in cache\nSo when you run any program in future, say which requires more 120MB. All 112MB(currently free) will be given and remaining 8MB will be taken from the non-active program buffer/cache.\nEdit: Found this link, which provides good explanation.\n\nA: Interpretting output of free:\nThe first line of the free output lists:\n\n\n*\n\n*total Your total, physical (assuming no virtualization) memory\n\n*used How much of that is currently used (by anything)\n\n*free How much of that is completely free (not used at all)\n\n*shared (never anything there, ignore that column)\n\n*buffers Memory used by kernel buffers\n\n*cached Memory used for cache\n\n\nThe last two items, cache and buffers, is memory that is not allocated to specific user processes. It is memory reserved by the kernel to improve performance overall, but is not \"application\" memory. These areas will grow or shrink depending on kernel policies with respect to caching, memory pressure, application I/O patterns, etc.\nSince these two columns are not user-allocated memory, and the zones can shrink (practically to zero) if user allocations require it, they are in a sense \"free\" - there's RAM there that can be freed up by the kernel if your apps actively need it.\nThat's what the second line tells you. It removes the buffer and cache memory from the used column (that's what the - means), and adds (+) them to the free column. (Rounding issue will happen.)\n(The last line shows the state of your swap space.)\nCourtesy: https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/33549/14497\nSo, in your case 112MB is the completely free memory, and if you take into consideration the memory used for caching, which can be allocated to the user applications, if needed; then 501 MB is the actual maximum memory available for use.\n\nA: The answer by @saji89 is excellent, but these days free -m no longer prints the -/+ buffers/cache line, but instead puts the amount of available RAM in a new available column on the first line, for example:\nubuntu@pg_master:~$ free -m\n              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available\nMem:          61406        1571         506       17131       59328       42150\nSwap:             0           0           0\nubuntu@pg_master:~$ free -V\nfree from procps-ng 3.3.10\n\nYou can read the commit to free(1) that removed the line in their repo. Also the commit to add the new available column.\n", "Q: I cannot open my files I had two partitions on my HD under windows.

I have even restarted the system several times but no success. I can't see the installed languages. Only the ones installed by default are still visible there. Can anyone help me?\nMany thanks!\n\nA: Perhaps, it was only installed languages but not keyboard layouts.\nTry to check: System Settings > Keyboard Layout \nType of input can affect desktop controls.\nIn between, IBus support should be enabled to fix language indicator issues.\nRead more about Community Help Wiki - IBus\nLook for this nice help about IBus: How to Enable Foreign Language Input In Ubuntu\nAlso check your Keyboard Layout > Layouts tab > Options > Key(s) to change layout.\n\nA: Once you have language support open, you need to drag the language you want up to the top of the list. I found this confusing at first since the other languages are gray. But they are not \"grayed out\". You can still drag them up. Also the languages you installed will be at the bottom of the list and scrolled of the visible portion of the list box. I had also thought they were not installed.\nDrag the one you want to the top of the list and click \"Apply system wide\". On the Regional Formats tab, choose the language you want (here it's a pop-up list and easier to use) and again click Apply system wide.\nIf you plan to use switch between all three languages frequently, you might want to take a different approach. Changing from, say, Turkish to French will cause the system to want to change the names of your home folders. A slow-down at best but a possible a source of problems later.\nMy recommendation is to make 3 new users, one for each language. user-turkish, user-french, etc. When you create the user, set the language to the one you want. This will have the same effect of changing the language/regional settings but for that user only. After that you can edit permissions on the home folders to make sure you can use all of your files.\n", "Q: How to check in script if upstart event was emited?

After very few issues only I moved my application from Python2 to Python3 making sure it will still run with Python 2.7, and hence has python >= 2.7 as dependency only.\nThis was mainly done because Python3, and some dependencies are not installed in a default 12.04 LTS, and I do not want my users to have to install all Python3 only to run my script.\nWhen I create an appname.desktop launcher I now need to decide if it starts my application using Python2, or Python3 like\nEXEC=python /path/app.py\nEXEC=python3 /path/app.py\n\nBut what I would like it to do is to \n\n\n*\n\n*Launch the application with the Python3 interpreter if Python3 is installed.\n\n*Otherwise use Python2 if Python3 is not installed.\n\n\nHow can this be done? Do I need to tell it in my package installation script, or can I have a launcher which can handle both (in case people install Python3 after they had installed my script)?\n\nA: It sounds too obvious to a good answer but...\nWhy you don't use a bash script as your app binary. I mean drop in /usr/bin/ a bash script that checks for python3 and then runs the real script.\nThe launcher will just point to the bash script.\nIt will even work from the command line (as only the bash script will be on PATH).\n\nA: I would do this in my setup.py script.

You can set the kernel you want as default by changing the GRUB_DEFAULT=0 line to GRUB_DEFAULT=\"1>2\" in /etc/default/grub. 1, means the second option in the first page of the Grub menu and the 2 means the third one on the second page (Counting starts from 0).\n", "Q: Old Fglrx Driver - AMD Radeon HD 3200 - ubuntu won't start I've been using Ubuntu 12.04 64 bit for about 2 weeks now and I installed the latest Fglrx driver (Graphics Card- AMD HD 3200, PC- Acer Aspire 5336, 4GB RAM, 500GB Harddrive).

However, you would then have to make sure that all the right libraries, etc were linked and could be found by the program. You would have to run export LD_LIBRARY_PATH for various libraries, etc as the FAQ explains, so that your compiled wine looked for the libraries in your custom directory. You could definitely run your compiled wine from that drive once it was compiled and all the linking set up, but it might be tricky to set up the linking successfully.  \n2) The second involves installing wine first.\nHowever, there is then a way you could get close to what you want and have an independent wine folder from your system default ~/.wine, and this could be done by creating a wineprefix in your flash drive.\nYou could format your flash drive with a filesystem that fully supports permissions like ext4, and then you can create a wineprefix on your flash drive with\nWINEPREFIX=/media/UnixFlash/wine winecfg\n\nThis would be a way of running programs from the suitably formatted flash drive, and using a wineprefix would keep the applications and settings apart from the main ~/.wine folder which could be set up differently.

I tried putting the urls into proxy sites, but they all just returned to their home page. \nAre there any other solutions?\n\nA: Along the lines of pwnguin's answer but if they are strictly blocking HTTP URL strings then simply using FTP or rsync should get you through the filter.

However, I think your aiming for the wrong goal. I am not sure what freeswitch is so I am going to remove it, and use gedit. \nFirst, Linux is way more \"network oriented\" then windows. This is true right down to the gui level. X windows, is a network protocol. You can run one of several X servers on windows and then use putty to connect to your Linux box and run gedit. The window would then appear on your windows box as if you where running it natively. \nAnother option that is very similar, but good if you want to support running gedit full time is Xvnc. You can start a vnc server (that you connect to from windows). This will give you a totally independent DISPLAY to run gedit on. Xvnc can start as a server, as a particular user, and auto execute some commands. This will help you get started in that direction, but will take a bit of research. I suspect the is the solution you want.\nA third solution is XDMCP. This protocol allows you to login to an entire X session from a remote X server.  Basically you would connect to the \"login screen\" from your windows box and go from there. This page is a good start for XDMCP\nA forth solution is to launch X then run your script inside it. This would give you a \"special\" Desktop that you could use for just that application. This would not \"break\" your normal install or login, but would separate out your application. A quick example script would be...\n\n#/bin/bash\n  sudo X :2 &\n  sleep 5 # wait for X to start up\n  export DISPLAY=:2 # set the X display\n  metacity --replace # start a window manager (this may not be installed)\n  gedit # run the actual program  \n\nOf note is that the forth example can be used in Xvnc or XDMCP sessions as well. \n", "Q: How to turn on Unity HUD I have Ubuntu 12.10 (upgraded from Lubuntu).

In the disk management tool the partition appeared as “unknown”.\nWhen I saw the label was gone and that the partition was acknowledged as unknown, I knew that probably my computer wouldn't be able to recognize my hard drive partition once I disconnect it from my computer. Unfortunately I didn't have enough space to save all data from the hard drive to the computer it was connected to, so I did had to remove the hard drive to another computer: and what I expected happen – my partition is no longer recognized by Ubuntu.\nSince I was able to copy files between the computer and the hard drive (I actually copied the files I wanted to my flash drive) before I remove it from my computer, I think there may be a way to recover my partition to its original state, and that's why I am creating this question.

This is the first time I'm having a Secure Boot-capable PC. What will be the danger in disabling the secure boot? I'll be happy if I can get assistance from anyone.\n\nA: *\n\n*First install Ubuntu-Secure-Remix-64bit (or Ubuntu12.10 64bit) then use Boot-Repair's Recommended Repair as described in the first paragraph of https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI\n\n*If that fails, disable SecureBoot in your firmware as described here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI#SecureBoot , and run Boot-Repair again.\n\nA: You have three options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable Secure Boot. This is likely to be the easiest solution if you want an LTS version of Ubuntu. The downside is that you'll lose the benefits of Secure Boot in protecting against malware. Note that losing Secure Boot is no worse than running Windows on a BIOS-based computer, but in theory at least, Secure Boot can provide some benefits. Also, there's no standardization in user interfaces, so it's impossible to provide detailed instructions on how to do this that apply to all computers.\n\n*Try Ubuntu 12.10, which ships with an EFI boot loader configuration that should work on Secure Boot systems that support Microsoft's standard keys. This is a brand-new feature with 12.10, which is why it's not working for you with 12.04. The fact that it's so new means that it's not yet been well-tested, though.\n\n*Create your own Secure Boot keys, add them to your firmware, and sign both your Ubuntu boot loader (GRUB 2, by default) and the Windows boot loader with your keys. This will take a fair amount of effort and will require ongoing effort whenever a boot loader is updated, but it gives you total control of the Secure Boot environment -- if and when malware signed with Microsoft's key starts making the rounds, your system won't run it.\n\n\nI've written a Web page that covers all three options in more detail.\n", "Q: Virtual USB bus using TCP I have a router that a printer can be attached to to print wirelessly to.

Unfortunately the idea of netbooting off of a wireless network is just something that isn't generically supported across multiple vendors, this seems to suggest that certain hardware supports it:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://superuser.com/questions/310915/is-possible-to-boot-on-pxe-over-a-wifi-device\nI've set up LTSP on a normal ethernet network, and even those \"ethernet over power\" 200mbit devices, which happen to support PXE just fine. The superuser question mentions some support for this on macs, so maybe a good place to start investigating is if LTSP supports or can support this: \n\nApple has built drivers for those Wi-Fi chipsets, as well as a UI for joining a Wi-Fi network, into the EFI bootROM on those models. As far as I know this is an Apple proprietary scheme, not PXE-based.\n\nOne thing you might want to investigate is scripting logging into a remote LTSP server from the local Macs, they wouldn't be true \"thin clients\" would it would get you up and running.\nStill, having deployed LTSP at a school, if you're doing this at scale (I did about 200 clients) you'll want/need a very fast gigabit network anyway; if you have rooms worth of laptops that you were hoping could all hop on the WiFi and get a full remote desktop with great performance, then that's really not going to happen anyway. \n\nA: The main problem here is joining a wireless network for the DHCP offer to come from. With a wired network, its easy because you're physically connected to a network over a standardised connection - Wired Ethernet over RJ45 (can't remember the \"correct\" term, if anyone wants to correct please do). \nWith Wi-Fi you have to specify what network to connect to, along with any passwords. What you could want is iPXE - open source boot firmware which can network boot over both wired and wireless networks. You would have to configure iPXE for your network appropriately and install it to the laptops (this can be done en masse by network booting from LAN or USB on a one off occasion).\n\nA: One way of dealing with it is to use a WiFi range extender with Ethernet port.  This is what I ended up doing.  I use an old laptop to connect to a newer PC with ltsp.  Curtails your mobility but let's me sit in front of the TV when I want to :)\n\nA: I found out that you can take a wifi router and use the existing dhcp on your wired network.  Then use virtualbox and bridge to your wifi adapter.  Then boot PXE on vbox.\n", "Q: How do I save the settings on a Ubuntu Live USB? I made a bootable USB pendrive which works just like a live CD. When I use it and make changes, for example, install an application, it does not save the changes I make on next reboot. Is it possible to do something about this?\nUPDATE: I have followed the instructions in kingmilo's comment. Eventually, I ended up using \"startup disk creater\". Which is a great application. I decided to give 2.6 G as storage....but I faced the following problem:\n\nBasically, I start up with the \"Try Ubuntu\" options...and everything gets saved (applications, wallpaper, music), but I need the extra space to work. How can I make it work in the easiest way?\nUPDATE2 it is working now with kingmilo's help/comment and some other info on properly partitioning and formatting pendrives. \n\nA: It is possible, however, not with your current install of Ubuntu on your USB, you will need to reinstall it and follow the tutorial on this page:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/LiveUsbPendrivePersistent\nand for more information have a look here:\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/174315/how-to-save-settings-on-bootable-usb-drive\n\nA: I always use the Universal USB Installer from pendrivelinux to do my persistent bootable USB drives.

Of course, I use a Windows box to create them and if you don't have access to one of these, unfortunately this isn't the solution for you.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Xubuntu Lubuntu 12.10 and Compiz Compostor Where can I find the Compiz compositor and the plug-ins that will work in 12.10 all versions\nI see the https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompositeManager#Compiz article but it has no mention of anything beyond 12.04 \n\nA: \nWhere can I find the Compiz compositor and the plug-ins that will work in 12.10 all versions\n\nCompiz, Compiz Settings Manager and the Compiz Plug-ins are in the Ubuntu repositories, Compiz being installed by default as a matter of fact because Unity runs on it (as a plug in).\nDepending on the Ubuntu version you're using the Version of Compiz will vary.\nIn any case, if you're running another Ubuntu variant (read: non Unity) you won't have Compiz installed by default.

This is my first dedicated server having used a VPS for over a year and I'm trying to setup a VPS on this new server. I purchased a subnet from my hosting provider that I believe allows me 6 usable IP addresses:\n177.xx.xxx.201 - 177.xx.xxx.206\nThe subnet address looks like this: 177.xx.xxx.200/29. I've gone on my server and added them like it said on a wiki like so:\nip addr add 177.**.***.201/29 dev eth0\nI done that for all six and now when I go to them in the browser they point to my server. The problem is, I'm using OpenVZ web panel to create VMs (http://code.google.com/p/ovz-web-panel/) so I created a VM and assigned one of those IPs to it. However when SSHing to that IP it SSH's to the dedicated server and not the VM. Am I missing something?\n\nA: OpenVZ is adding a new vmnet0 interface.\nIf those address are routed to your server IP address as a subnet You just have to enable routing in kernel.\nIf those address are on the same subnet as your server IP You have to create a bridge of this interfaces (venet0 and eth0).\nI wrote that in polish but commands are the same :)\nhttp://www.dobreprogramy.pl/okokok/How-To-Serwer-VPSow-na-OpenVZ-i-SolusVM-w-VMWare-Workstation-cz,37584.html\nedit: Those address are in the same subnet as eth0.

What's the best way to install Ubuntu without putting GRUB on the MBR?  I would think I can install to another partition (logical?), and then install GRUB on a bootable USB.  When I want to boot to Ubuntu, just plug in the USB.\nWould this work?  How can I get the installer to do that?\n\nA: To do this you will need to set up the partitions for Ubuntu manually.  I suggest you do this with Gparted after selecting \"try Ubuntu\".  You should then go ahead and install Ubuntu but when Ubiquity asks how you want to install select \"something else\" and it will take you to the advanced mode.\nYou then need to specify the partitions manually, and also tell it where to install grub.  Down the bottom of the advanced partitioner, you will it has probably defaulted to installing grub on /dev/sda.  Change this to the correct device name for the USB you want to install grub to.\nAfter installation the machine will only boot into Ubuntu when you boot grub off the USB drive; the MBR on the hard drive will not be changed.\n\nA: *\n\n*Boot the installer\n\n*Click \"Try Ubuntu\"\n\n*Start a terminal (Alt+F2 then typing gnome-terminal is one way to do this)\n\n*Type ubiquity --no-bootloader\n\n*(--no-bootloader literally means \"Do not install a bootloader\")\n\n*To install grub to another location, such as a USB drive, run sudo grub-install /dev/usb_device_name (see How to install grub on usb flash drive? and Can I Install grub on an USB and make it a rescue disk?)\n\n\nA: Why don't you want to install GRUB on the MBR? If you're installing it beside another operating system, GRUB will pick it up and still give you the option to boot into that other operating system. Alternatively, you can choose to not install GRUB at all, and let the other bootloader handle things, though this may take some configuration in the other OS. The easiest and most common thing to do in a dual-boot situation is to just let the new bootloader nuke the old one and replace it.\nThat said, what you want to do probably won't work, anyway. If you could do what you wanted, then you'd end up with two bootloaders trying to fight for control. That's part of why there's a Master Boot Record (MBR) to begin with.\nIf you want to install Ubuntu, without wiping out your other OS, that's entirely doable in a number of different ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*Repartition the drive the other OS is on.\n\n*Install on a different internal drive.\n\n*Install to a USB flash drive and use the \"Boot to USB\" option in your boot options at POST time to boot to it the same way you'd boot to a CD.\n\n\nA: I've never tried, but I think it would work indeed.\nAs for the safest way of doing this, I'd say you need to create a partition (with partition magic or any other program) for ubuntu, by shrinking the windows one.\n\nA: One option is the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from Ubuntu CD or USB and make a backup copy of your MBR:\nsudo dd if=/dev/sda of=/path/to/old_mbr bs=446 count=1\n(replace /dev/sda with the actal device for your hard disk and /path/to/old_mbr with a file name and path to which you want to save the existing MBR)\n\n*Install Ubuntu, including GRUB in the MBR.\n\n*Again, make a backup copy of your MBR, this time with GRUB installed:\nsudo dd if=/dev/sda of=/path/to/grub_mbr bs=446 count=1\n(replace /dev/sda with the actal device for your hard disk and /path/to/grub_mbr with a file name and path to which you want to save the GRU MBR)\n\n*Restore the old MBR:\nsudo dd if=/path/to/old_mbr of=/dev/sda bs=446 count=1\n(replace /dev/sda with the actal device for your hard disk and /path/to/old_mbr with the path where you saved the old MBR)\n\n*Keep the backup copy of your GRUB. You can:\n\n\n*\n\n*place it on a USB stick (dd should do the trick) to run GRUB when the stick is inserted\n\n*if you are running Windows, place it on your C: drive and add the following entry to boot.ini:\nC:\\grub_mbr=\"Ubuntu\"\n(again, change the file name as necessary)\nThis will bring up the Windows boot menu on start, with Ubuntu as a separate entry. Choosing Ubuntu will then bring up GRUB and let you boot into Ubuntu. (OK, some may not like the idea of going through the Windows boot loader to bring up Linux, but it works.)\n\n\n", "Q: Cant see the desktop except for the background Ubuntu 12.10 This happened after I reinstalled the fglrx graphic drivers.

Are there config files I can edit, or is there something else I can do to enable this functionality?\nAlternatively, can anyone post a list of keyboard shortcuts in gedit?\n\nA: I have written a plugin for Gedit 3.30 and later (included in Ubuntu 18 and later) which adds some common keyboard shortcuts.\nCtrl+Tab / Ctrl+Shift+Tab for navigating between documents\nCtrl+Y for Redo\nCtrl+G for Go to line\nCtrl+E for Delete line(s)\n(And it is fairly straightforward to modify the plugin to change the key combinations for these operations.)\nhttps://github.com/foolo/gedit_custom_keys/\nJust copy the files to the gedit plugin directory.\n\nA: At least for Lubuntu 13.10, you can edit .config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css, here's mine:\n@binding-set unbind-ctrl-d {\n        unbind \"<ctrl>d\";\n        unbind \"<shift>F10\";\n        unbind \"<ctrl>Page_Up\";\n        unbind \"<ctrl>Page_Down\";\n}\nGtkTreeView { gtk-key-bindings: unbind-ctrl-d; }\nGtkTextView { gtk-key-bindings: unbind-ctrl-d; }\n\n\nA: For Ubuntu 12.04 and up:\nUse dconf-editor instead of gconf-editor\nsudo apt-get install dconf-tools\n\nThen set dconf>org>gnome>desktop>interface>can-change-accels to true\nSetting shortcuts when using global menu (which is the case in Unity):\n\n\n*\n\n*Open evince (or any app) with UBUNTU_MENUPROXY=0 evince\n\n*Browse menus, hover an entry, type your shortcut\n\n\nA: There used to be an option to enable editable menu accelerators for GNOME apps. The GNOME team removed the GUI for this, but at least under GNOME 2 it was still available via gconf. Recent Ubuntu versions use GNOME 3; I'm not sure of whether that still works (since GNOME 3 has migrated to dconf). I tried it in the old gconf-editor, and setting the option /org/gnome/desktop/interface/can-change-accels using dconf-editor, but it doesn't seem to work in Gedit (v3.4 on Precise).\nAccording to Where to configure shortcut keys of Nautilus?, it doesn't work with Unity's global menu. You could load a different desktop environment and make the change there (if it works).\nIt may still be possible to edit the keyboard shortcuts by editing configuration files. According to a commenter on the (very outdated) Gedit shortcuts documentation page:\n\nYou don't really need a plugin to change keyboard shortcuts.

Currently, all of our printers are served. For instance, our main printer is on \\SST-DC5\\COPIER. I am trying to figure out how to add these printers to Ubuntu.

Any help would be appreciated.\nThank you\n\nA: If I understand your question correctly, you are trying to connect to a printer on a Windows print server. To do this, you want to connect to your printer using a technology known as Samba.\nStart the Printers application, and click the Add Printer button. In the window that appears, click the Network Printer tree and then the Windows Printer via SAMBA item. \nIn the entry box, type the name of the print server, a /, then the name of your printer, for example, SST-DC5/COPIER. \n\nThen follow the instructions as if you were adding a regular printer. \n", "Q: Proxy Client for Ubuntu I want to use a proxy for web browsing similar to Ultrasurf for Windows.  I've tried to use TOR, but it isn't working!  The problem is whenever I search something along the lines of \"ubuntu + linux proxy\", sites assume that I want to set up a proxy server rather than use one.\nI just want something with little to no configuration needed (i.e. I don't have my own proxy server).\n\n\nUltraSurf is a free software which enables users inside countries with heavy Internet censorship to visit any public web sites in the world safely and freely. Users in countries without internet censorship also use it to protect their internet privacy and security.\n\n\nA: Before I give my main answer, as discussed in the comments, it may be worth noting another approach that can sometimes work for unblocking some sites, and that is using Google translate as a proxy. In combination with changing your DNS settings, sometimes this can be successful in unblocking some sites.\nYou can browse whole sites via Google translate, using an url such as this and you can select a translation setting so that the actual 'translation' will still be in English. Just change the u=http://www.bbc.co.uk in the above url to switch sites when you want to.\nYou can also change your DNS settings from your ISP to Google DNS, which may help if there is some DNS filtering done by your ISP, though it might not help if your ISP is using a transparent proxy to filter material. See my answer for this question for how to change your DNS in network-manager without needing to touch your router.\n\nObviously TOR is the service to use for anonymity, but because of the lack of speed and problems you had running it, perhaps a free vpn service is what you want, although there are very few services around.\nI must say that I am wary of free proxies and vpns and am reticent to recommend any I haven't used personally, so the only one I can report that I have experience with on Ubuntu is one called SecurityKiss. I have found the service useful on the occasions that the ISP was blocking a legitimate site and changing the DNS did not solve the problem.\nIt must be said that the limit for free users is only 300 mb per day, which is fine for hours of surfing, but not for hours of downloading. \nThe service takes a while to setup, and is not exactly a 'quick' setup. You can either use PPTP or openvpn, but I usually prefer openvpn, so you need to install openvpn and the openvpn plugin for network-manager:\nsudo apt-get install openvpn network-manager-openvpn\n\nThere are extensive notes at the SecurityKiss site specifically for Ubuntu, with ample screenshots, so on this occasion it is not necessary to simply repeat them all here. \nHowever, the drawback is that before you can follow the above instructions you need to get a configuration generated for Linux based systems from here and then log on to the client area here and download your package which contains further configuration details.\nThe explanation detailed here on the official site is very good, and your SecurityKiss entry in Network Manager should look similar to screenshot below by the end. I have obscured the gateway in the screenshot below. \n\nOnce set up it will be available to use from network-manager.\n\n\nIt is worth trying the Google translate and Google DNS combination first and then the SecurityKiss solution if you need to; if neither of these are satisfactory you might have to try TOR again. \n", "Q: Why is the login section of \"passwords and keys\" empty Where are passwords stored for the user. As a test I deleted the files stored in /home/user/.gnome2/keyrings expecting to have to re-enter my WiFi password at least but it had no effect. So where are passwords stored in 12.10?\n\nA: The keyring files are no longer stored in the ~/.gnome2/keyrings folder. They are now stored under $XDG_DATA_HOME in a combination of the keyrings and keystore directories.\nHowever, WiFi network passphrases are a special case. As NetworkManager now has support for global vs. per-user network settings, your WiFi passphrase is likely stored in /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/ in a file named the same as the WiFi network.\nIf the only password you've entered into the system is the WiFi passphrase, when you were logged in, and don't have any SSH passphrases or other passwords stored in the keyring, then the keyring will most likely be empty. Deleting the files won't change that.\n\nA: This answer may help you\nThis should reset everything:\nShort version rm ~/.gnome2/keyrings/login.keyring\nYou will likely need to logout and back in.\nIf your trying to reset your keys see the link. \nKeep in mind that only applications using the keyring will be effected. Network Manager by it's self does not use the keyring. Only the gnome network manager front end does.

The latter seems more likely. Either the disk was partitioned with RAID features active but you're reading it in Linux with RAID inactive or vice-versa. Either way, you should work to get the RAID situation sorted out. Check the options in the firmware and in Windows related to RAID. If it's active, you probably need to ensure that the dmraid package is up and running in the Ubuntu installer; if not, you need to uninstall it, and you may need to remove stray RAID data. I'm afraid I don't have more detailed references handy, but some Web searches should turn up more information.\nConcerning your inability to boot in EFI mode, I'm not entirely sure what's going wrong, although it could be related to Secure Boot. You could try disabling this feature in your firmware. (Ubuntu 12.10 supposedly includes Secure Boot support, but this feature is brand-new and may yet be buggy on some systems.) It's also possible you're running into a GRUB bug. Note that it is possible to install Ubuntu in BIOS/legacy mode and then switch the boot mode. For greatest flexibility, I recommend you create a separate FAT, ext2fs, ext3fs, or ReiserFS /boot partition when you install. This will make it relatively easy to experiment with certain boot loaders and boot managers, such as rEFInd, gummiboot, and ELILO. All of these boot programs require that the kernel be readable by the EFI, which can be arranged if the kernel is on a FAT, ext2fs, ext3fs, or ReiserFS partition. (For anything but FAT, you'll need filesystem drivers that ship with rEFInd.) You can install one of these programs from Windows and configure it to boot your Linux kernel in EFI mode, which can simplify the process of converting from a BIOS/legacy-mode boot to an EFI-mode boot.\n\nA: I'm running this laptop with Ubuntu GNOME 13.04.\nThe first step is to disable SSD as a cache from Windows, using Intel Matrix Storage software. Yes, it can't be done through the firmware. Without that, you won't be able to use more than 8GB on the SSD.\nIf you want to boot automatically in UEFI, you need to disable Legacy. Currently, Linux is hitting bug with the NIC card in full UEFI mode, so you have to disable it. Once you booted Ubuntu in UEFI mode, you'll notice you wont have sound either.\nThat's a trade off. I suggest you to keep using legacy mode until full support is here.\nRegards,\n", "Q: Why have column borders gone missing in Rhythmbox gui?

At the moment, Id only like to view the stream coming from my old VCR as opposed to recording anything (for now).  The VCR is confirmed working with my regular TV, hooked through AV cords. But when I try and use VLC, all I get is screen static.\nThis is how I get what little I have.\nOpen VLC\nOpen Capture Device\nUnder Capture Mode, the one I can get to show something is 'Video for Linux 2'\nVideo Device Name: /dev/video32 is the only one that will show anything. Running either video0 or video24 causes VLC to close\nAudio device name: hw0:0\nVideo Standard: NTSC (though I tried undefined and got the same thing)\n..and with this, all I get is static, as Ive said.  Im at a loss and could really use pointers from someone who has experience with these cards. \n\nA: Open with VLC with the pvr command, i.e. \nvlc pvr:// :pvr-channel=2\n\nThe pvr-channel= option can accept a 0, 1, or 2.\nUsually 0 is coax, 1 is s-video, and 2 is av.\nRight now, my problem is that I can't get audio in for watching\non my wintv 150, so good luck.\n", "Q: How do I retrieve my files from an Ubuntu install that can't boot? One day I was turning on the computer, and it simply wouldn't turn on. Ubuntu would start to turn on, but froze up/quit just as it was \"loading the dots\" on the Ubuntu boot up screen (Plymouth). It doesn't get past that, and I have files I need in Ubuntu that I obviously cannot retrieve using Windows. If anyone knows how to access Ubuntu files from Windows then I can just get my files and then re-install Ubuntu. Someone told me this was a bug in the last update and said to 'use an older date' when turning it on, but there's no option for this in my boot up screen.\n\nA: You should be able to recover your files by booting your computer from a LiveCD/USB, then mounting your Ubuntu partition from Nautilus (the file manager). Once you have access to your files, just insert another removable data storage device of your choice to back your files up to, then unmount both and reinstall.\nWhen someone told you that this was being caused by a bug in a recent update and to use an older version, it sounds like they think the kernel is the problem and you should try booting an older kernel. Assuming you haven't been removing them manually, you should be able to select the next highest-numbered kernel in your GRUB menu (12.04 LTS and previous), or find this kernel hidden in the \"Advanced options for Ubuntu\" entry (12.10 and later).\n", "Q: Is there a Picasa download for Ubuntu? I love using Picasa and am totally dissapointed to find nothing of the sort in Ubuntu and not being about to download it...anyone know how to?\n\nA: Try this: http://www.afterdawn.com/software/general/download_splash.cfm/google_picasa_for_linux\nThis is Picasa 3.0, I have not tried installing it. Have you tried running Picasa for Windows with Wine or CrossOver? That should work.\nOkay, you are asking about downloading Picasa for Linux. So the following does not really answer your question, but you could still try the following pretty capable alternatives. You can expect to have new releases in the future for these applications.\nShotwell is not bad, you can use plugins to also publish photos to online websites.\nGwenview is a KDE application and another alternative, and is pretty good too. Only thing is that you will need to install quite a few KDE dependencies with it.\nXnView is also pretty good, I have used the Windows version a bit but have never used the Linux version so can't comment much on it.\n\nA: Google used to offer a Linux download for Picasa, although it was just the Windows version bundled with Wine. In april 2012 they discontinued it, but you can always download the Windows installer yourself and run it with Wine. There's info in WineHQ.\nAs Swarnendu Biswas said, there are very good alternatives. Shotwell (Gnome), Gwenview and digiKam (KDE) available in the repos, and XnView has a beta multiplatform version than can be downloaded here.\n", "Q: Canon PIXIA MP 230 How do I get scanner working on 12.04?\nLooked at\nSearching for printer/scanner canon pixma mp230 (32bit) ubuntu 12.04 drivers and how to install\ndownloaded scanner driver, run but nothing happened.\nAny help for dummies available?\n\nA: found the scanner driver, it's working now \nhttp://support-au.canon.com.au/contents/AU/EN/0100469501.html\n\nA: Only GIMP can start ScanGear.

I restarted the computer and the computer automaticaly ran the Ubuntu Instalation. I set it to install alongside Windows 7. I was planning to leave 80GB for Windows and 170GB for Ubuntu. After I set everything, I cliked to install and then came my problem. It wouldn't install. It was taking an awful lot of time so I saw there was an error message (I don't know what exactly) appearing on the instalation screen. I had to abruptly stop the whole operation because there wasn't a button to cancel! \nMy Windows seems to be fine and I'm not having any problems with it. And you probably should know that there are no more than 10GBs of files and software on my computer.\nP.S.: Sorry, if it was hard to understand. I don't really know much about computer and I'm new to Ubuntu and obviously English isn't my first language!\n\nA: You should have probably let the install finish. The error could be totally normal. As is ERROR can't do thing one so doing thing 2.\nThere is not a cancel button because it is not safe to cancel at the point you describe. \n\nA: I think when you install ubuntu, choose something else. and delete unused space for swap area, and ubuntu system. Make sure the format is '/'. i think that's the center of your problem.\n\nA: Try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Insert your Ubuntu CD, reboot your computer and set it to boot from\nCD in the BIOS and boot into a live session. You can also use a\nLiveUSB if you have created one in the past.\n\n*Install and run Boot-Repair\n\n*Click \"Recommended Repair\".\n\n\nNow reboot your system. The usual GRUB boot menu should appear. If it does not, hold Left Shift while booting. You will be able to choose between Ubuntu and Windows. \nMore info and options\nI know you said that you installed Windows 8, then Ubuntu, but it seems like GRUB didn't get installed somehow.\n", "Q: CPU Fan not working on acer 4755G i3 ubuntu 12.10 Hope you can help me, I'm new to ubuntu and install this 12.10 version on my acer laptop.

Can somebody clear this up for me please? I always thought LXDE comes without a compositor or an element that is present in other desktop environments (DE's) that causes other desktop environments to degrade desktop performance.

I have tried booting a Ubuntu live disc but the machine won't boot it.  When I bring up the UEFI boot menu it offers a selection of UEFI BOOT SOURCES, windows boot manager, dvd drive, IP4 Ethernet controller, or IP6 Ethernet controller.  If I select the dvd drive with the CD in it I get the message\n\"Secure boot violation,  Invalid structure detected.  Check secure boot policy in setup.\"  With all other selections it just boots into windows.\nSo where do I go from here?\n\nA: Disable secure boot in your bios. This will prevent the system from preventing you from running the installer. In the future, versions of GNU/Linux (including Ubuntu) will have workarounds for this feature. For now, complain to Microsoft.\n\nA: Which version of Ubuntu have you tried ? \nI think Ubuntu 12.10 64bit supports UEFI mode and secure boot out of the box. \nHere is a similar question-answer : 12.10 UEFI Secure Boot install\n\nA: *\n\n*With SecureBoot enabled computers, you need to use Ubuntu-Secure-Remix-64bit (or Ubuntu12.10 64bit)\n\n*If the error persists, disable SecureBoot in your firmware as described here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI#SecureBoot , and try again.\n\n*Once you can boot the Ubuntu disk, install Ubuntu and use Boot-Repair's Recommended Repair as described in the first paragraph of https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI\n", "Q: Cannot connect to wireless network I am quite new to using Ubuntu 12.10. All I remember while installing Ubuntu 12.10 was that I didn't check any box specifically to enable wireless connectivity.\nI tried looking into the various questions posted here - most of them refer to certain commands (redundantly sudo) and things of that sort. I am quite new and wasn't sure of understanding what those commands were trying to do (the network configuration settings - showed up different options, like 'Wireless', 'Wired', 'IPv4', 'IPv6' etc -- I am not sure of what sort of settings are to be made - like for example what sort of 'WEP' settings etc are to be made.\nAlthough I wasn't able to connect to the wireless network, I was able to connect to the internet, once I plugged in the ethernet cable.\nCan someone help me with:\n\n\n*\n\n*Understanding a way to see if Ubuntu is configured to connect to a wireless network.\n\n*If so - Getting to configure to a wireless network (setting up a new one).\n\n*Where in ubuntu, should I look for seeing if there are any hardware devices (such as the Broadcom wireless adapter or things of that sort - like the way we use the 'Device manager' in Windows to look into the adapter settings).\n\n*Reference material to learn and understand the various ubuntu commands. (things like the lshw etc).\n\n\nA: Generally, you needn't do any configuration at all. If a wireless device has an appropriate driver associated with it, Network Manager will see it and announce that there are available networks and then invite you to click the icon and select your network and connect. We suspect, based on your question, that a driver is needed but missing. When a driver and hardware associate, a wireless interface is created. You can check with the terminal command:\niwconfig\n\nIf there is no wireless interface, it will look something like:\neth0      no wireless extensions.\nlo        no wireless extensions.\n\nIn plain language, there is no wireless interface. Another useful command asks for a list of all hardware and may be filtered to only show network devices:\nlshw -C network\n\nIt will not reveal much useful, except what you probably already know: driver=none or similar. \nThere is an Additional Drivers utility that works primarily for display drivers and some Broadcom network cards. Because manufacturers are building and selling newer devices every day, it is a struggle for kernel developers to keep up. \nThe fastest easiest method I suggest is to ask for a listing of PCI devices and filter to devices in the class 280; wireless.\nlspci -nn | grep 0280\n\nThe pipe symbol | is on the right side of my US keyboard on the same key with . When you have the informative eight-digit identifier, something like 8086:4239 or some such, you can search this site or ubuntuforums.org for a method to install the driver. Of course, you can post it here and we can help you. If your wireless device is USB, then the command is:\nlsusb\n\nIt would be wonderful if there was a built-in utility that found a driver for everything and installed it immediately. However, in addition to the speed with which manufacturers produce new devices without Linux drivers, a number of drivers and firmware files are partially proprietary. Ubuntu, as shipped, is completely free and open source so no proprietary pieces are included.\n", "Q: Ubuntu won't install from Live CD Complete noob here.

Or will I have to run update again to install the patches separately?\n\nA: Once a new version of Ubuntu is released, all of the patches which have been released since the disk images were made will not be incorporated into them the next time you download them. The disk images made available for download at ubuntu.com are pretty much final. Instead, the patches are meant to be applied after installation by running updates, much like what ImaginaryRobots said in their answer. So long as Ubuntu is kept updated, you can be sure that the latest patches for your package versions are already applied.\nA semi-exception to the rule is LTS releases, which include several point releases (i.e. 12.04.1, 12.04.2, etc.) after the initial release for the LTS is made, and a new image is built for each point release containing all of the updates released up to when it was built. This is due to the longer support period for LTS releases so you have fewer updates to install after download.\nDaily images for the current development version of Ubuntu include all the latest patches and revisions for the newest packages as of the day you downloaded them - but these are made only for unstable versions of Ubuntu which haven't been released yet, and you are likely to run into lots of bugs if you try using them. Similar to official stable releases, these daily images can then also be kept up to date just by running updates.\nThe only reason why you might want to reinstall Ubuntu, typically, is to \"fix\" a broken system, or start over with a fresh install. If you plan on using the same version though, you likely won't need to download a new image - just run updates after everything's back in place.\n\nA: You do not need to re-download and re-install Ubuntu to get updates and bugfixes - simply open the dash and search for Software Updater, and run it.  It should run automatically for you on a schedule.\nYou can make sure that updates are installed weekly by following the instructions here:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutoWeeklyUpdateHowTo\n\nA: @WarriorIng64's answer above answered my question but I couldn't find any reliable document to verify it. So I asked the question in #ubuntu IRC channel and got comments from peers confirming WarriorIng64's answer - \"Patches are NOT integrated into the main build\".\nI'm pasting the IRC chat transcript here.\n\n<ME> does the ubuntu image i just downloaded has all the patches released so far\n<Nice Guy 1> does not, but it does offer installing updates rightaway, or even during the install I believe\n<Nice Guy 2> only development version 13.04 has a daily build\n\nThat's all.\n", "Q: Is there an alternative to VS 2012? Hey I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask and sorry if its not, But I'm needing an alternative to Visual Studio 2012 for Linux and I found 2 so far called Netbean and Eclipse, Out of those or any other ones you guys may know of which is the closest or similar to VS 2012?

Ubuntu is only 2 disks: one is 70GB, the latter is 677GB. But inside that disk there are no files from E and F. But when I checked in Windows, that files are exist.\nThis is what I got from blkid:\n\n/dev/sda2: UUID=\"deac59a9-a0d0-4a69-a918-d511a9857204\" TYPE=\"ext4\"\n   /dev/sda4: UUID=\"C606C83106C82471\" TYPE=\"ntfs\"  /dev/sda5:\n  UUID=\"2d3d4bf9-33b7-461c-aa88-c08caa6bef58\" TYPE=\"swap\" \n\nAnd this is from sudo fdisk -l\nHow can I access that disks?\n\nA: You'll need to install something that can install a decryption tool that can read the partitions before you can do anything with them.\nHave a look at gdecrypt in the Ubuntu repositories.  Since I've never done it I will have trouble giving step by step instructions but the following is from software center page:\n\ngdecrypt was written for making the use of decrypted partitions under Linux more easy. It currently contains a GUI written in PyGTK for decrypting/mounting, unmounting and encrypting partitions or container files and it supports partitions created with truecrypt (see http://truecrypt.org for details) and LUKS.\nNote that truecrypt <=4.3a is required for truecrypt support and cryptsetup with luks is required for luks support.\n\nYou should probably edit your question with the vital truecrypt information if you want to get some help from someone who has used truecrypt.  Neither Windows nor Ubuntu come with truecrypt support out of the box so you have to install it before you can access those partitions.  This is easy enough to do with Ubuntu (select try Ubuntu then install gdecrypt) but I don't know how you will tackle Windows.\n", "Q: Cant get lm-sensors to load ATI Radeon temp and fan or output all settings New to Linux and having minor issues :/ .

Change the Boot order to the generic \"usb device\" then make sure that the USB device is plugged in when you turn the machine on and enter the BIOS.  Save the BIOS settings.  You should now see the device listed in Boot priority, though if it still doesn't appear try a reset (warm boot) and enter the BIOS again.\nAnother way to do it is the boot menu.

Choose a stream from the site you are interested in; I chose this 128k mp3 stream from the site you mentioned and added it with Music > New Internet Radio station (as in the screenshot below). \n\nThen on the sidebar (see screenshot below) click library > radio and the new station will probably be listed in the unknown genre slot. So then just double click the new station there.\nIt is also important to note that when you import a radio stream rhythmbox will sometimes assign a gender to it ('Space Electronica') and sometimes not. So, for example, this stream was to be found in 'Experimental Nujazz' when imported. If you can't find the station in the program's list, look through the genres or 'unknown' and double click a station if it doesn't play automatically. \nIf the stream doesn't play correctly, I should choose an alternative, as there are usually several available; for example, on this page the asx stream played the best.\n\nIn general, experiment with the different stream options available on the radio site you are interested in as rhythmbox has good support for .pls and .asx feeds, etc, when the necessary gstreamer plugins are installed.\nIf you can't get the .pls file working, you could just open it in a text editor and extract the url and then add that as a radio station in Rhythmbox, using the process I mentioned earlier in my answer.\n\nYou could also try installing the excellent rhythmbox-plugin-radio-browser from the ppa of one of our moderators, fossfreedom; do not install the version in the repositories as that version does not work with the current Rhythmbox.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:fossfreedom/rhythmbox-plugins\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install rhythmbox-plugin-radio-browser \n\nYou have to enable it by going to edit > plugins first. \n\nMore on the plugins available is explained here:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I install third-party rhythmbox plugins?\n", "Q: my modem cannot connect in ubuntu 12.10 Need help in connecting modem in Ubuntu 12.10! \nhow to connect vodafone usb stick modem in ubuntu 12.10.

It is now under Filters, so I don't know how many of the steps below were actually necessary; anyway here's what I did:\nDownload the tgz file to your desktop from DBP archive\nI downloaded http://www.ozemail.com.au/~hodsond/dbpSrc-1-1-9.tgz\nThere may be a later one, which would amend the following slightly.\nOpen a terminal, and run the following: \nsudo apt-get install build-essential checkinstall\nsudo apt-get install libgimp2.0-dev gcc cpp g++\ncd /usr/src/sudo tar -xvzf /home/MyUserName/Desktop/dbpSrc-1-1-9.tgz\ncd dbp-1.1.9\n\nThen I went to File manager (Dolphin), navigated to root/usr/src/dbp1.1.9.

The benchmark can be accessed from Tools > benchmark. The benchmark tests how fast your CPU can crunch through the encryption algorithms (see screenshot). The performance of your machine will be vastly increased if your CPU supports AES hardware encryption/decryption. That setting is available from settings > preferences > performance.\n\nThere are specific tests available to gauge GTK+ and filesystem performance in the repositories that can be found with apt-cache search benchmark, and the benchmarking tool in Peazip will give you some archive compression/decompression figures, which are not particularly useful. That is the problem really, often the results mean little and are what you would expect for your hardware configuration. \nProgram such as iotop and htop will provide very useful information regarding your current programs and processes, and with iotop you can see if there is a bottleneck somewhere on your system by studying the data presented. You can study these while performing intense tasks such as encryption/decryption or video transcoding.\nHowever, the phoronix-test-suite, available in the repositories, also has specific tests such as ones for CPU encryption/decryption performance, some for archive compression/decompression, gtk, and for every test you could think of.

Running Ubuntu 12.10 with Xubuntu-Desktop. Would like window to minimize if I middle-click on its title bar. Can't find any setting for this. Is it possible?\n\nA: Yes, this is possible- I have been experimenting with xdotool and xbindkeys, and they are mostly all you need to pull it off, so please enter\nsudo apt-get install xdotool xbindkeys x11-utils xinput\n\nNow, your middle mouse button is usually button 2, but you can check by using xev and clicking in the event tester box, or looking at the output of xinput. Enter xinput and that will list your devices, so note the id for your mouse and then enter \nxinput list-props < device id >\n\nto find details on your mouse buttons. You can always choose a different mouse button if your middle button doesn't register properly or is unavailable.\n\nThe xdotool command you need for what you want to do is:\nxdotool getactivewindow windowminimize\n\nThis command minimises the active window; however this action must also be associated with mouse button 2 and the way to do that is to use xbindkeys. We place the above command in ~/.xbindkeysrc (see below) and associate it with the middle mouse button (b:2), so that the depressing of mouse button 2 triggers the xdotool command.\n(This xdotool command will work in the terminal if executed and will minimize it, so showing that it is the necessary command for what you want.)\nThis entry must be placed in your ~/.xbindkeysrc:\n\"xdotool getactivewindow windowminimize\"\nb:2\n\nThe xdotool command must also be enclosed in quotes (as above) when placed in that file. \nSo that xbindkeys re-reads the file, you can clear current bindings with killall xbindkeys and then just execute xbindkeys to restart it.\nNow your command will be available; xbindkeys doesn't seem to need to be put in startup for me, and you can run your command without rebooting; you can cancel it any time again by entering killall xbindkeys and then editing your ~/.xbindkeysrc. \n", "Q: How to find packages recently uploaded to the Ubuntu repository I've recently used reprepro to set up a mirror of the official Ubuntu repository for one architecture and one release (Precise in this case). Please note how in conf/distributions I define one repository that the clients on my network will reference and in conf/updates I pull all components into it (including updates and security). If doing it this way (everything pulled into a single local repository) isn't a good practice, I'm open to suggestions (I haven't mirrored Ubuntu before).\nHowever - I know that in order to keep the repository up to date, it is suggested that we pull in changes from the upstream every 6 hours (exactly as for Debian). I don't know how often the updated packages are uploaded to the upstream repos and that's probably the reason why I'm worried that the local repo update might be missing some packages that had already been uploaded to the upstream.\nI'd like to get a list of packages recently uploaded to the upstream to verify whether my mirror is working correctly and the message I'm getting during the local repository update:\n\nNothing to do found.

I made some changes to sysctl.conf but now need to run sysctl -p on each boot. I can always create an init script to have it run automatically on boot, but I was wondering if there was an Ubuntu / Debian way of doing it.\n\nA: There is a better and more ellegant way:\ncreate your configuration file on /etc/sysctl.d/ directory. \nFor example, if you changing kernel parameters due to database requirements, create a file:\n/etc/sysctl.d/60-mysql.conf\n\nand add your own parameters inside it.

As known, Ubuntu has got rid of tray icons. Instead, it now uses indicators and only indicators. Sniqt converts the Qt tray icons into working indicators.\nThe problem is that it doesn't do a very decent convertion. Actions like single click, middle click etc do not work, while they do in systems that support tray icons.\nIs there a way to have these actions back? Can I use QSystemTray icon and still have these interesting (and very helpful, in my occasion) actions in Ubuntu?\nI would be glad to know the answer to the other thread I talked about earlier (how to make a working indicator using the GTK libraries and prevent the crash), as well.\nLink for Sniqt bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/sni-qt/+bug/1027652\n\nA: Unity, by choice, doesn't support what you are referring to as \"decent tray icons\". It's indicators or nothing. From there you have several options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make do with the limited indicator capabilities. You can set the menu that will by used by your indicator with the standard QSystemTray.setContextMenu() method.\n\n*Detach your app from the systray entirely. As in, turn it into a floating icon on the desktop, that will be able to accept middle- and right-clicks as God and Matthias Ettrich intended. You can find a simple example of how to do this here: http://kde-apps.org/content/show.php/KEyes?content=51493 (Optionally, do this only when you detect that you are running under Unity, i.e. if $DESKTOP_SESSION is set to 'ubuntu'.)\n\n*Declare Unity unsupported. This is not a very good option.\nWhether you'll want to go with option 1 or 2 mainly depends on what your application does.\n\nA: It seems that Qt does not support this thing, at least on Ubuntu Unity, even if it has a signal 'activated'.\nSo I would recommend you to use GTK and a normal trayicon, I see no alternative with Qt.\nYou may contact the developers of Qt for clarification on this.\n", "Q: Beginner help for usb start \nPossible Duplicate:\nMy computer boots to a black screen, what options do I have to fix it? \n\nI tried to try ubuntu from a flash drive but after I selected my language and said try it just is on a blank screen with the normal background.

Alternative solutions are welcome.\nAddendum; if the laptop suspends while the lid is closed and it's brought up again, the windows do stay correct. This problem seems to happen when the lid is opened while still running instead of when closing the lid.\n\nA: This exact same thing is happening to me on Ubuntu 12.10, every time I close my laptop. \nOne work around is to apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager, run ccsm from the command line, enable Window Management -> Put and configure a keyboard shortcut for put_next_output_key.

Do: \nsudo apt-get kde-window-manager\n\nTry it with kwin --replace. Then go to settings manager > Session and startup > Applicaiton Autostart > +Add\nInput whatever in the first two fields and in the last one put\nkwin --replace\n\nSave and log out and in again. Now you have the expected window tiling and OpenGL acceleration giving less tearing. You will get new window decorations. To change window manager settings, you can right click the title bar and choose More actions > window manager settings. In those settings go to Focus and set focus stealing prevention to none for the cursor to appear in the whisker menu, i.e. the regular XFCE menu, when pressing Ctrl+Esc or whatever key you bound to it.\n\nA: This feature is added to Xfce 4.12.\nOpen terminal and type the following:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:xubuntu-dev/xfce-4.12\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:xubuntu-dev/extras\n\nsudo apt-get update\n\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nThis worked for me in Ubuntu 14.04...\n", "Q: Why does Ubuntu not detect my SD card? I can't mount my SD card. I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS on an Asus K55V (Intel), and I have a sd card slot, but Ubuntu doesn't detect when I put a SD card in the slot. Not Ubuntu nor other program.\n\nA: Run these commands from a command prompt:\nsudo modprobe -r r852\nsudo modprobe -r sdhci_pci\nsudo modprobe r852\nsudo modprobe sdhci_pci\n\nThis uses modprobe to unload and reload the device drivers (in this case kernel modules) to automatically detect the SD card into the kernel.\nSource codes\n\n\n*\n\n*r852 driver: Ricoh 85xx xD/smartmedia card reader driver\n\n*sdhci_pci driver: Secure Digital Host Controller Interface PCI driver\n\n\nA: For Broadcom Corporation BCM57765/57785, in addition to the answer below, I had to add lines to modprobe.d (before commands above)\n$ sudo sh -c 'echo options sdhci debug_quirks=0x40 >> /etc/modprobe.d/sdhci-pci.conf'\n\nAND\n$ sudo setpci -s 00:1c.2 0x50.B=0x41\n\n[source]\n", "Q: Install GNOME extensions through website: security vulnerability? I found a GNOME extension through a Google search (using Chromium), and was very surprised that I could simply toggle the On/Off switch to have the website install a full GNOME extension on my computer without any other manual steps involved. (tested, this works with Firefox as well.) Granted, it does pop up a dialog box asking me to confirm installation, but ...\n\n\n*\n\n*While this is great for ease of use and usability, aren't there security vulnerabilities with this? I would be interested in knowing how exactly this feature works, and whether I should be concerned about any \"backdoors\" that this might allow for hackers to easily install executables on my machine.\n\n*Are the extensions on the GNOME site vetted? Is there a way to tell whether extensions are safe or not?\n\n*Are the Chromium and Firefox browsers modified by GNOME in order to allow for this feature? Are there any other custom GNOME Chromium/Firefox changes that users should know about?\nUPDATE: Having understood how this works, I now believe this is a really great feature especially for non-technical users, but it did alarm me a little when I first encountered it. \n\nA: Yes, and no. \nFirst the link you clicked on to install an extension was coded in, specifically (I think) to gnome 3.2 as a method for instillation. So in that sense it is a \"trusted\" site.\nSecond, gnome extensions are user scripts, stored only for your user. They don't have access to any information that the user does not have access to. So for example there can't be a shell extensions to write files to /.\nThird, Browsers were not modified, but gnome shell was.\nBasically the install method is no less safe then providing you a tar.gz file and telling you to manually extract it in your home directory. Rather or not the individual extensions are safe is a decision you need to make on a case by case basis. However gnome.org is a legit site, as is the extensions sub domain. \n", "Q: GRUB error (2) while booting Ubuntu 12.04 I have installed Ubuntu 12.04 on my computer. The install went fine but now I have the next error while booting: grub stage 1.5 - error 2 \nI'm posting from the live CD and I didn't find an useful answer in Google.\n\nA: Boot from LiveCD and from a terminal run 'grub-install /dev/hda' command and then boot from the hard disk. The command will do a fresh install of grub on your hard disk and overwrite any previous versions of grub. Hopefully this will fix it.\n", "Q: Problems installing adobe flash player? Whenever I try installing something I get a error. In a terminal I always get some error. In the Software Center fails. It tells me to check my Internet connection, even when I have an Ethernet cable attached to the WI-FI router. \nWhen I try to download with the browser, opening the with the Archive Manager or saving it happens the same. I've even tried to use Flash-Aid. There seems to be a problem with my proxy or something. \nI somehow managed to install Adobe Reader but I don't actually know how. I've read step by step guides but they use computer jargon that I can't understand.\n\nA: It's Definitely your Proxy. Proxy connections are often unstable(for various reasons) and can cause many Problems. I'd recommend only using the Proxy when you have to. For instance try turning off the Proxy and then install Adobe Flash. Since the Repos don't use region blocks you should be able to download and install anywhere in the world. Only if there are some really strange restrictions on your ISP would you not be able to install software on Ubuntu over the net.\nAfter you're done installing whatever else you need you can turn the proxy back on and get on with your Web surfing.\nI'd also recommend installing a Download Manager like DownThemAll for use while on a Proxy. A Download Manager can make multiple connections to a source to speed up downloads and automatically reconnect if a connection error occurs. Some (like DownThemAll) include Hash mechanisms so you can input the Download's Hash for the Manager to check with to make sure everything downloaded all right. \n", "Q: How can I disable the window manager's alt+drag action? Tumblr uses alt+click to reblog, but Compiz uses alt+drag to move windows.  This is convenient for some, but I have literally never used Compiz's alt+drag and would like to disable it.  How can I get rid of the alt+click+drag function without disabling alt completely?\nThis is different from this question because I would like to disable this functionality, NOT move it to the Super key.\n\nA: Install the Compiz settings manager if you don't have it already. In terminal:\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\nNow find and open the settings manager.  Find the Move Window plug-in.  (You don't want to disable the plug-in; if you do that you won't be able to move windows at all.)\nJust change the first setting, Initiate Window Move. It can be change it from Alt+Button 1 to Super+Button 1, but you stated that is not what you want, so just click on Alt+Button 1 and uncheck Enabled.\n\nA: Some more information: I tried to disable the Alt+Button 1, and all my window bars gone. This is not expected, I consider it a bug. And when I reboot my Ubuntu, the setting is recovered.\nIn my case, it cannot be disabled, but changing it into Super+Button 1 works fine for me.\n", "Q: Terminator transparency not showing other opened windows but only wallpaper Terminator transparency not working after upgrading to Ubuntu 11.10. At zero slider it is  becoming completely black and at max slider its showing wallpaper background rather than background containing other opened windows.\n\nA: You need to use real compositing for that. What configuration do you have? If you have a graphics card, installing the Additional Drivers will solve the problem.\n", "Q: Error:couldn't read file-Kernel panic I have just installed ubuntu 12.04.1.

A friend tried to dual boot ubuntu alongside windows 7 but he didn't succeed. Ubuntu option was in grub, but when you tried to boot it rebooted from the start. So from a Live CD I erased ubuntu, started windows to check if something went wrong, and fortunately everything was OK. Windows started normally!\nSo I tried to install ubuntu. Before installation was completed the installer crashed! I was afraid that he would lost windows, something that was true...\nAt that point I tried to install windows but whichever distro(XP, 7{home, proffessional, ultimate},8) I tried it could never reach the end.\nSo I tried to reinstall ubuntu but I was facing those weird messages.

I'm trying to dual boot 12.10 with it and I have run into a problem with the installer. When I get to the page to pick the partitions I get this: \n\nNo drives are listed and the only thing in that device drop down is /dev/sda. If I click Install Now or +/-/change I get an \"Ubuntu has stopped working\" error message.\nI'm trying to install off a 12.10 64-bit USB drive in UEFI mode, and I have tried it with secure boot both enabled and disabled with the same results.  \nThe hard drive set up is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*500 GB main drive \n\n\n*\n\n*windows recovery (primary)\n\n*EFI boot section (primary)\n\n*Windows' partion (280 GB I believe) (primary)\n\n*unallocated space I created for Ubuntu partition (200ish GB)\n\n*another Windows recovery partition (primary)\n\n\n*12 GB solid state drive\n\n\n*\n\n*all unallocated space\n\n\n\nCould it be a problem with the number of primary partitions? I think I read somewhere about a max of 4.\n\nA: Case 1: Installing on HDD (/dev/sda).\nWhat you have stated in your question is correct.  \nYou can't have more than 4 primary partitions.  \nSince 4 primary partitions have already been alloted to Windows, you are unable create any Partition for Ubuntu. Ubuntu can be installed on Logical Partitions, so if you can free at least one of the Primary Partitions from Windows, you will have the ability to create multiple Logical Partitions on it, one of which can be alloted to Ubuntu.\nFrom your description, I can see there are two Recovery partitions for Windows. I am not sure about how Partitions for Windows 8 work, but my best bet would be that one of those Recovery Partitions is redundant, one of which you should be able to remove.\nBut, before doing any changes to your Windows Partitions, I advise you to get to know the Partition Layout of Windows 8 and their respective uses, and then start.\nCase 2: Installing on SSD (/dev/sdb)\nIf you don't want to mess around with your Windows 8 install, you can just select /dev/sdb in your install menu which should be your SSD.  \nSo, you will now have Windows 8 on your HDD and Ubuntu on your SSD. But now, every time you boot, you will have to choose whether to boot from HDD or SSD.\n", "Q: What is the default call of keyboard shortcuts in GNOME? I am trying to find what is being called when I press a keyboard shortcut. For example, if I hit Ctrl + Alt + L I block the screen, or when I hit the \"mute\" key in my keyboard I mute the sound. I can't find where those bindings are stored.\nI have found the list of bindings in /usr/share/gnome-control-center/keybindings, but I don't see there the effect of the key, just that it is a shortcut.\nI am not looking for the window where the shortcuts are listed (1) but I want what the shortcuts are calling.\nFor example, if I create a new shortcut, which executes a shell script, it's easy to see what it is calling, just clicking on the name (in the said window 1), but if it's a default shortcut, clicking on the name disables the shortcut, so I want to know what the shortcut executes when it's activated.\nI'm using Gnome Shell (not Unity) in Ubuntu 12.04\n\nA: If you have a windows key on your computer hold that down for a couple seconds. hope that helps :P\n\nA: Search for Keyboard Shortcuts in unity.

I am planning to install Kubuntu onto an SSD, but have /home mounted on a hard disk drive.\nBut also, I would like some /home/... subdirectories to benefit from SSD's performance (they will be read often and written rarely).\nAn obvious solution for this is to create symbolic links to some location on the solid-state drive.\nHowever, I was under the impression that symlinks are similar to files in a way, and to get to the files on the SSD, the computer would have to read the symlink from the HDD first.\nSo my question is the following:\nDo symbolic links from a (normal) hard disk drive to a solid-state drive (both ext4 formatted) lead to a significant performance hit? Can I just use them or should I look for another solution?\n\nA: No, it does not lead to a performance hit.  The link has to be read, but only once.  After that it will be kept in the cache.\n\nA: You could keep the whole of /home in SSD, and mount only the Documents, Pictures, etc in the harddisk. Consider this solution as in my computer: \n/disk/zero/bin /home/sddhrthrt/bin      auto bind 0 0\n/disk/zero/Documents /home/sddhrthrt/Documents  auto bind 0 0\n/disk/zero/dotfiles /home/sddhrthrt/dotfiles    auto bind 0 0\n/disk/zero/srv      /home/sddhrthrt/srv         auto bind 0 0 \n\nin your /etc/fstab. I'm not sure if this is better than symlinking, but I guess it performs better. (I did it for backup/sharing purposes anyway, because I do the same folders with other distros too).\nAnd you should consider mounting your /var in the harddisk if you haven't already.\n", "Q: Cryptswap boot error - can't mount?

While most of the time the swap-partition was mounted despite the warning message, sometimes the GUI refused to start upon boot completion because of it.\nHere's what I did as a workaround:\nOpen a terminal by pressing Ctrl + Alt + T.\nType gksudo gedit /etc/fstab and press Enter.\nSearch for the line that reads:\n/dev/mapper/cryptswap1 none swap sw 0 0\nNow enter the value noauto right after sw (separated by a comma), so it looks like this:\n/dev/mapper/cryptswap1 none swap sw,noauto 0 0\nSave and exit. This way, your swap partition won't be mounted while booting, thus the warning message won't appear or even hinder the login screen to appear.\nNow type in a terminal\ngksudo gedit /etc/rc.local\nand enter the following lines before the entry exit 0:\nsleep 10\nswapon /dev/mapper/cryptswap1\nIf there's no entry exit 0, you'll have to enter it right beneath those two lines. \nSave and exit again. This will tell your system to wait 10 seconds after login to mount your encrypted swap partition.\nReboot your system. You should not get the warning message any longer. After login, wait some time, then open up a terminal again and type \nfree -m\nYour output should look something like this:\n\nfuzzyq@Samsung-R710:~$ free -m\n              total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\n\n Mem:          3949       3806        143          0         86       1783\n\n -/+ buffers/cache:       1936       2013\n\n Swap:         4095          0       4095\n\nThe last line is the important one. If there's a positive value showing for total swap, your swap partition was being mounted successfully.\n\n\nA: You don't mount swap file systems. You can however check that they're in use with:\ncat /proc/swaps\n\nwhich will show you all block devices configured to be used as swap.\n", "Q: Dual boot 10.04 and Windows 7 Before downvote, please this is not a duplicate I read the related questions and couldn't solve my problem.\nI bought a new laptop that originally had Win8 installed, I formatted it, installed Windows 7 and then went to install Ubuntu.\nThat didn't work because no Ubuntu version whatsoever (10.04, 11.04 or 12.04) were able to even detect partitions on my harddisk.\nSo I decided to go the other way, install Ubuntu then try installing Windows and fix grup after it gets broken due to Installing Windows.\n\nUsing GParted, I created an NTFS partition and then rebooted and tried installing Windows 7.\nThat failed, the error message was speaking about GPT table.\nI am trying to just understand what's going on here, why am I unable to do what I was perfectly doing on my old machine(please in enough detail; let me know if I need to provide more information)? and how can I fix this?\nI am trying to avoid using Wubi so if there's any other way, I'd take it.\nCurrently running on Ubuntu if I need to use some tool to extract more information about my HDD\nEDIT:\nThanks, fabricator4.\nI indeed used gparted to delete my partioning table and MSDOS table worked just fine(my HDD's size is 500 GBs only).\nI did consider installing 12.04, the thing works just fine on live CD and when I ran the installer it recognized Windows partitions and all; I made a partition for it and installed.\nOnce I reboot and choose at the GRUB screen Ubuntu, the screen goes off(totally off), then on again and kinda blinking; I hear the welcome music of Ubuntu but I cannot see anything, except a very very thin line at the top of my screen where I can see the mouse.\n\nIt's weird, it did work on Live CD just fine, why is it crashing when It's installed? could be a graphics card problem? is there a way to fix such a thing?\nP.S While the system is booting, I do not see the Ubuntu mark and the dots going to indicate it's loading, I have a blinking screen instead.\n\nA: okay so basically boot from the disk and open Gparted and create a comfortable partition for your ubuntu install (25GB IMO) start the installer it should detect windows and add it to its boot loader.\nhope this helps!\n", "Q: Unable to ssh into Ubuntu VM running w/ a NAT ip address even w/ openssh-server installed This is a fresh install of Ubuntu Server 12.10 running VirtulBox 4.8.2 on a Kubuntu 12.10 host.  I have Ubuntu Server running w/ a NAT'ed IP Address (10.0.2.X or something like that).  I want to ssh from my Kubuntu laptop to my VBox server so during install I selected OpenSSL Server or whatever the option is.  Outside of that selection there is nothing custom done and the system is completely up to date. \nSo when I try to ssh to that device I get a timeout response and am unable to connect.  The service is running on my VM but nothing happens.  I also cannot ping the VM either.\nIs there something I'm missing?  A firewall between my VM and Host?  Not quite sure\nThanks for the help in advance,\nJonathan\n\nA: The problem is the NAT. When you are using NAT, VirtualBox basically acts like a router making a subnet, and just like with a normal Router setup you can't access a device on a lower subnet. As I see it you have two options here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Switch your VM to a \"Bridged Adapter\" mode(can be done even after an OS is installed) and then Reboot or Renew your Server's IP. Your VM should show up with a normal IP on your Network and then you can easily access it. I usually recommend this for Servers anyway because burying a Server defeats the use of one.\n\n*Make a Reverse SSH Tunnel. Basically instead of making a tunnel from your Host to the Guest Server, you do it the other way around. This is a pretty straight forward task and there's a nice HowTo to be found here: http://www.howtoforge.com/reverse-ssh-tunneling, Just use your Host's normal network IP and it should work. A user also posted a nice thing in the comments of the article about SSH Tunnels between 2 PCs with both being  behind NATs.\nOut of the above I still recommend #1 for obvious advantages to a server setup but if you really want to keep the Server Sandboxed then #2 should work fine.\n\nA: You can of course also use port forwarding in virtual box:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the VM settings\n\n*Select network\n\n*Click Port Forwarding\n\n*Fill out a row\n\n\n*\n\n*Give a useful name like 'SSH'\n\n*Leave protocol as TCP\n\n*Set Host IP as the host IP (eg: 127.0.0.1)\n\n*Set Host Port as something like 10022\n\n*Set Guest IP as the IP of the VM\n\n*Set Guest port as 22 (or the SSH port)\n\n\n*Connect to the host details (eg: 127.0.0.1:10022)\n\n", "Q: How to allow remote connections to Flask? Inside the system, running on virtual machine, I can access the running server at 127.0.0.1:5000.\nAlthough the 'remote' address of the vm is 192.168.56.101 (ping and ssh work fine), I cannot access the server with 192.168.50.101:5000 neither from the virtual machine nor from the local one. \nI guess there's something preventing remote connections.\nHere's /etc/network/interfaces:\nauto eth1\niface eth1 inet static\naddress 192.168.56.101\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\n\nufw is inactive.\nHow do I fix this problem?\n\nA: The best way to do it\nflask run --host=0.0.0.0\n\n\nA: I've just had the same issue. To solve it, i updated the way to run the application :\n app.run(debug=True,host='0.0.0.0')\n\nUsing host=0.0.0.0 let me access my app through my local network.\nTo access your flask app all you need to do is in your browser type in:\n[your devices ip address]:5000\nie:\n192.168.1.255:5000\n\nA: First of all - make sure that your HTTP server is listening on  192.168.50.101:5000 or  everywhere (0.0.0.0:5000) by checking the output of:\nnetstat -tupln | grep ':5000'\n\nIf it isn't, consult Flask's documentation to bind to an address other than localhost.\nIf it is, allow the traffic using iptables:\niptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 5000 -j ACCEPT\n\nFrom Flask's documentation:\n\nExternally Visible Server If you run the server you will notice that\n  the server is only accessible from your own computer, not from any\n  other in the network. This is the default because in debugging mode a\n  user of the application can execute arbitrary Python code on your\n  computer.\nIf you have debug disabled or trust the users on your network, you can\n  make the server publicly available simply by changing the call of the\n  run() method to look like this:\napp.run(host='0.0.0.0')\n\n\n", "Q: Unable to show correctly symbolic icons with appindicator I'm creating an app under Ubuntu 12.04 and using libappindicator and Vala. I want to use a symbolic icon, to ensure that the colors are adapted to the background in the status bar. Unfortunately, I'm unable to make it work. I installed my icons (which uses the BEBEBE key color) and they are shown, but the color is BEBEBE, not white or black like the other icons.\nI also tried to put an icon that I was sure to be symbolic (audio-volume-high-symbolic) but, again, it's shown with the original colors, instead of them being replaced by the current FG color.\nI used both set_icon and set_icon_full methods, but none of them worked :(\n\nA: Not sure what you mean by symbolic icon.  \nIf you find that your icon does not match the colour scheme of your current theme, then you need to add icons to the relevant directory under /usr/share/icons and then run from the terminal sudo gtk-update-icon-cache /usr/share/icons/ubuntu-mono-dark for example.\n", "Q: Run fstrim from LiveCD A few years ago I installed Ubuntu 10.04 with LVM + LUKS on a system with SSD, TRIM was not enabled. Now I want to install Ubuntu 12.04 on the same SSD.\nI have found a guide explaining how to enable TRIM on Ubuntu 12.04 with LVM + LUKS, but before installing the new system, I want to clean out all the \"marked for deletion\" data generated under Ubuntu 10.04, to make the disk fast as new.\nMy plan is to boot a Ubuntu 12.04 LiveCD and create a new ext4 filesystem on the SSD, then mount the filesystem and run fstrim on it. After rebooting the LiveCD I will install the system as normal, and enable TRIM. Can anybody say if this will work?\n\nA: If you are going to format the filesystem anyhow, you may just use the -E discard switch to mke2fs to have it trim the unused portions of the disk.  e2fsck also supports the same option so you can trim the fs while checking it rather than formatting it.\nsudo mke2fs -E discard -T ext4 /dev/sdaX\nsudo e2fsck -E discard /dev/sdaX\n\n", "Q: Unity Clock Missing I recently installed ubuntu 12.10 and it seems as though my clock is missing. I also don't see any options for date/time in the system settings panel.\n\n\nAm I missing something? Again this is with Unity.\n\nA: Open a terminal window (Ctrl+Alt+T), then run the following:\nkillall unity-panel-service\n\nThis command should reset the panel, and hopefully reactivate the clock indicator.\n\nA: This could be one of two things, either the clock isn't installed, or a setting has been flipped to turn it off.\nFirst make sure the clock is installed by making sure indicator-datetime is installed:\n\nThen log out and back in. If it's already installed and it's still not showing up, try the options here:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to make the date appear next to the time indicator in Gnome Classic?\nIf that still doesn't work update your question with the results, thanks!\n\nA: As per the comments above I've fixed this issue on my brand new 14.04 LTS installation by running.\n$ pkill -f indicator-datetime-service\n\nThe clock came straight back.\n\nA: sudo apt-get install indicator-datetime\n\nand logout/login.\n\nA: Worked for me:\nsudo apt-get install indicator-datetime\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure --frontend noninteractive tzdata\nsudo killall unity-panel-service\n\nReference: https://askubuntu.com/a/357280/25184\n", "Q: Frequent Disconnects ubuntu desktop 12.10 x64 intel 82579V e1000e I'm having frequent disconnects with my new install of Ubuntu 12.10.

You could try resetting Unity in any case:\nunity --reset\n\nYou should be able to get to a console to do this with CtrlAltF1\nYou can also remove screencloud with the command line.  \nsudo apt-get remove screencloud\n\nhowever no-one else seems to have reported Unity conflict problems with it.\n", "Q: How can I open specific ports for my Apache server?

What is the maximum number of lens the heads up display will shown in Ubuntu 12.10? I would like to know, and I am sure other would as well.

I found that to be very handy if I would open f.e.g \"/tmp\", I just needed to press WindowsKey+r, enter /tmp and press enter, there I was. This was also great for URLs (ftp, http etc)\nUnfortunately, since 12.04, this doesn't work anymore. It seem as if the \"run command\" is now integrated with the program finder. It still works when I type \"thunar ftp://....\" or \"thunar /tmp\", but it's a bit tedious now. Is there a way to restore the old behavior?\nNote: I'm running a german localization of Xubuntu - I hope I translated \"run command\" and \"program finder\" correctly...\n\n\nA: Why not just make a shell script to run thunar and drop it in /usr/bin name thuna.  \nHave it run \"thunar /tmp\" if there is no argument specified.  \nSo much easier than fighting with the launcher.\n", "Q: installed AMD catalyst driver and am stuck with 800 x 600 resolution and no unity sidebar First off, Compix kept crashing on me.

Interestingly, Thunar seems to encourage this, because it even comes with a auto-completion for directory names!\nIt would be very handy if the focus could be set with a keyboard shortcut (e.g. Ctrl+d, which is used by most web browsers to do so).\n\nA: You can use Ctrl+L as keyboard shorcut to \"Open location\" in Thunar.\nIf you have set the view in the thunar's menu as View > Location Sector > Pathbar Style.\nThen when you press Ctrl+L a little window called open location will be open\n\nBut if you set the view as *View > Location Sector > toolbar Style.\nThe focus will be in the location bar.\n\nHope this will helpful!\nRegards.\n", "Q: Is there a way to mimic Windows 7's WinKey+Number shortcuts? One of the biggest things I miss from Windows 7 when I'm on Linux is the ability to push WinKey and a number to switch to the program in that place on the task bar. (e.g. You push WinKey+1, and it switches to the first program in the taskbar.) Is there a way to replicate that on Ubuntu 12.10 with Cinnamon? I tried to add custom shortcuts to do it, but I don't know any commands to switch to windows by their place in the taskbar. Is this possible?\n\nA: In Unity Desktop Environment this option is there by default.\nJust hold the Windows key (also called super) and the numbers for the shortcut will appear on each program's icon.\nI don't think Cinnamon has this option.\n\nA: In Unity that's how it works. If I hold Super (WinKey) it shows me the number to hit for each app in the launcher bar.\n\nA: This list of Cinnamon shortcuts suggests you can't switch among windows with Super+1..9.\nHowever, see the solutions for Gnome in this other question. Maybe one of them works?\n", "Q: Simple text editor with margin notes possibility I am looking for text editor, as simple as it is possible, which will give me opportunity to make margin notes. Actually it's only requirement which I have. Currently I use LibreOffice Writer and I solve this problem by use frames as margin space but it is not as useful as I've expected. I mean that order of text in frame is quite strange, I am forced to resize text there in every every case and also creating frame always when I want to write.\nDo you know some Ubuntu tool which can give me mentioned opportunity? Maybe some kind of online tool either?\nThanks in advance. \n\nA: LibreOffice Writer actually already has the feature you want. The marginal notes function in Writer is simple to use and doesn't require any creation of frames, resizing text, or changing the actual body of the document, so I should experiment with that again as it is ideal for annotating all types of document.\nYou place your cursor where you want the comment bubble to emerge from (see screenshot below) and either use Insert > Comment or press Ctrl+Alt+C and the comment bubble appears in the margin. \nAs you can see in the screenshot below, you can have multiple comments and you can use the feature with any other kind of document such as .txt, but you would have to save it as .odt to retain the notes. If using the .doc format, the margin notes will be saved successfully, but use of .odt is always recommended if possible.\nIf you want to prevent the comments from displaying go to view > comments and make sure comments is unchecked. When the cursor is inside a comment box in the margin, enter Ctrl+Alt+PgUp to move to the previous comment, and Ctrl+Alt+PgDown to move to the next one.\nMore information on the comment feature is available at the official site. Full documentation on LibreOffice and its programs such as Writer are available in pdf format from this site.\nI am reluctant to recommend another text editor, because when LibreOffice is used with the special comment feature it should actually be what you need for normal plain text documents as well as office documents.\n\n", "Q: Performance Counter Information required I need to learn how performance counter works for my research project.

When, in different applications, using the menu to open/save files, the dialog that appears might offer different choices. A lot of them lacks the ability to browse the network and connect to (in my case) a smb (samba) share on my NAS. My question: where is it going wrong ?  Or which packages are buggy ?\nI have samba installed on my machine (Xubuntu 12.10), and also gvfs and its backends.\nWith Thunar (1.5.3), I can easily access shares by:  - clicking the 'Browse Network' shortcut in the Side Pane,  - using self-made shortcuts directing to a folder on the share  - typing a path such as 'smb://datastore/action/Pictures'When a share is not mounted yet, a dialog appears to enter my credentials.\nThunar adds the self-made shortcuts to the file ~/.gtk-bookmarks, and to be sure I linked it with .config/gtk-3.0/bookmarks.\nIn LibreOffice ( 3.6.2.2) I find the same shortcuts as in Thunar, only 'Browse Network' is missing. Shortcuts to a smb share do work but only for browsing. Typing in a path works as long as I end it with a '/' ('smb://datastore/action/' does work, 'smb://datastore/action' not). When entering 'smb://datastore/' all shares are shown, but clicking them results in an error message \"Not a directory\".When at last I click the Save button, I get an error-message stating \"Path to the file does not exist\". If I try to open a file, the dialog closes and nothing happens.\nThe erroneous behavior only seems to be associated with the dialog. Opening a LibreOffice file on the smb share by clicking it in Thunar does work, as does saving it by clicking the save button on the LibreOffice toolbar.\nI tested Archive Manager (3.6.1.1), gThumb (3.0.2), Gimp (2.8.2) Inkscape (0.48.3.1) and Gnome MPlayer (1.0.6). They act similar to LibreOffice, although opening a file might work.\nLooking at Firefox (17.0), Leafpad (0.8.18.1) and Audacity (2.0.1), I find no way to access smb shares. All shortcuts referring to a smb share are missing, typing a path that starts with 'smb://' yields no result.\nSo, where is the cause ?  Is it gvfs, gtk, samba, the applications themselves, some packages missing ?  And what about applications that rely on java, python, perl, ...  Do they need additional packages to access smb shares ?  Is this a problem only for smb shares ?  Or is it common to all type of network shares ?  Maybe it has to do with the recent change of mounting point (~/.gvfs/ -> /run/user/$USER/gvfs/) and its awful mappings ?\nAnymore insight information is more than welcome !\n\nA: The problem is the applications themselves aren't necessarily using gvfs to do their I/O. Using smb:// should work in Firefox though, but not work by using the File Open dialog. Typing the URL directly into the location bar should work though, assuming that Firefox wasn't recompiled without the \"GNOME\" integration support.\nApps which do not use gvfs directly to do file I/O will need to open the file via the gvfs mount point (~/.gvfs/ or /run/user/$USER/gvfs/) to be able to interact with it. Opening a file in Libreoffice from within Thunar probably works because it's using the mount point path, rather than an smb:// URL to the file.\n", "Q: Why is my partition claiming to be out of space? My file system claims to only have 4.5 GB left. While my OS (a folder with in file system) still has 75.2 GB left. I put something near 130 GB on my Ubuntu partition, it should have enough space.\nI confirmed that I can put things in OS that exceed the space in available file systems, but that makes no sense, OS is listed as a folder inside of file system, why would it have more space than it's parent folder? What is going on?\nHere is the output of df:\nFilesystem 1K-blocks Used Available Use% Mounted on \n/dev/sda5 113773200 103741440 4252408 97% / \nudev 2004600 4 2004596 1% /dev \ntmpfs 804756 848 803908 1% /run \nnone 5120 0 5120 0% /run/lock \nnone 2011884 436 2011448 1% /run/shm \n/dev/sda2 127526908 54045584 73481324 43% /media/OS \n/dev/sda3 39144708 89016 39055692 1% /media/DATA`\n\n\nA: /media/OS is a separate partition /dev/sda2 and does indeed have 73.5 GiB left as free space.\n/ (root) is on /dev/sda5 and is 97% full - 4.25 Gib available.  It looks like your /home is part of the filesystem on /, so data files that you place in there will take up space on /\nThis is why I usually have a small but sufficient paritition for / of say about 25 GiB, and make the rest of the drive available an mounted as /home.  I can fill home up as much as I like, and it won't affect the operating system on the root file system.\nYou will be able to free up some space on / by moving some of the data files you have in /home onto the partition you have mounted as /media/OS.  I've never been a fan of multiple data partitions for no clear reason since unexpected low usage in one and unexpected high usage in another leaves you in a rather silly situation.\nIn short, it's working this way because that's the way it has been set up.  Another solution might be to resize and move some partitions around to better fit in with the way you are trying to use them.\n", "Q: 12.04 to 12.10 update is not shown I am trying to update to Ubuntu 12.10 from 12.04, but the update manager never gives the option, even if I have selected 'Notify me of a new Ubuntu version: For any new version'.\n\nA: This is how it should work(tested myself):\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Update Manager\n\n*Click \"Settings\"\n\n*Change \"Notify me of a new Ubuntu version:\" to \"For any new version\"\n\n*Enter Admin password when asked\n\n*Click \"Close\"\n\n*Click \"Check\"\n\n\nThat should force the check for Ubuntu 12.10. If that still doesn't work you can do the less pretty way and use terminal.\nThis method is usually used for Servers since they lack a GUI but it works for Desktop releases too.\nJust open a Terminal and enter these commands:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install update-manager-core\nsudo do-release-upgrade\n\nThat should do it.

The Window will now remain on Top of all other Windows so you can Fullscreen a Video and still continue to chat.\nEDIT: Oh I see. The problem here is Flash.

If I can't do that, I just want to know how to get the Unity notifications back.\n\nA: I'm not sure about the first part, but if you don't want to use the Xfce notifications (and thus, use Unity's notifications instead), you can remove the \"xfce4-notifyd\" package:\nsudo apt-get remove xfce4-notifyd\n\nThen log out and log back in.\n", "Q: Is it true that there will not be 32-bit Ubuntu Server 12.10 ?

I ether need to know how to downgrade without losing my data or a simple way to share files again with my other machines.  Thank you in advance.\n\nA: There is not simple downgrade path supported.  You can try installing again and when it asks how you want to install specify \"Do Something Else\" and it will take you to the advanced partitioner.  There, you should specify the partitions to use but do not click the box to format the /home partition if you have a separate one, or the / (root) partition if it also contains your /home.\nThe Ubiquity installer will then install over the top of the existing files leaving everything else in place.  Because downgrading is not supported however, I'm not sure if this cause further breakage.\nRegardless, I recommend that you back up all of your important data before you proceed any further.  Development releases can and do get broken by an update at any time during the development cycle.\nAfter you get it back up and running, make sure that you don't have update manager set to check for development releases.

WUBI makes a disk image file on your Windows partition to store the Ubuntu OS and then mounts the disk image when you choose to boot Ubuntu. This gives the benefit of trying Ubuntu without needing to Repartition the HDD and only suffer some very minor limitations.

Please be warned that this option may suppose a possible security breach since all passwords are stored without encryption.\n\nA: In kubuntu:\n-click network widget > setting icon\n-right click your wifi connection > edit\n-general configuration tab\n-check 'all users may connect to this network'\n-press OK\n\nA: Kubuntu 16.04\nNote: The following is my adaptation of @ccamara's answer, which didn't quite work as written on my system. If you upvote this answer, you should upvote theirs as well. \nIntroduction\nKWallet needs a password to decrypt its stored passwords, which includes your WiFi password. To avoid having to type a password each time, you can store your WiFi password in an unencrypted file. This allows KWallet to use the WiFi password without dycrypting it. \nWarning\nIf you do this, know that this opens a possible security hole, as any user on your computer could access this file and learn your wifi password. \n\n\n*\n\n*Do not use this approach if you need the wifi password to be hidden from other users on this computer. \n\n*If you use your wifi password for other accounts (not recommended!), you may want to hide it so that others would not learn your password and be able to access your other accounts with it. \n\n\nOf course, it would only be vulnerable to somebody who could access your computer. You probably don't need to worried about your neighbors stealing your wifi password through this approach because they probably will not have access to your computer.\nSteps\nRight-click on the WiFi icon and click \"Configure Network Connections...\". \nA \"Connection editor\" window show a list of saved connections. Right-click on the WiFi network you want to work with, and click \"Edit...\" from the drop-down menu. \nThis opens a new window, with a \"Wi-Fi Security\" tab. Click on that tab. \nThere should be a drop-down menu of security options and a password field. The password field should have an eyeball icon and a disk icon both on the right. Click the disk icon to save the password. \nChoose \"Store password and make it available for all users (not encrypted)\". \nDone!\n\nA: I thought there should be a better way than saving into an unencrypted file, and found that one may edit the connection and check that it may be used by all users.  Then, the password will not be stored in the current user's KDE wallet, but somewhere deeper in the NetworkManager infrastructure (presumably in a file only readable by priviledged users, possibly obfuscated as well).  In any case, the connection will be automatically initiated for all users, without any further password prompts.\n", "Q: Cant mount cryptswap1 ?

I've been reading on the news, forums, and different websites that the new version in 12.10, which i'll eventually have to upgrade to if I plan on using Ubuntu, has a lens/amazon function on the dash that sends queries to amazon. Now, this disturbs me a bit, since I don't want to see \"shopping recommendations\" everytime I look for something, be they from amazon or from \"future partners\".\nDoes this new \"function\" only apply to the Unity desktop? If I switch to the Xfce desktop, will I be able to \"save myself\" from sending search data to amazon and/or shopping recommendations from them? Or will I have to entirely switch distributions, in order to evade this?\n\nA: The Amazon ads are specifically part of the Unity shell. Xubuntu uses the Xfce desktop, not Unity; Xfce provides its own panel and run dialog.

I can close computer over the network but finding IP addresses is hard to me.\nHow can I easily find all online IP adresses from 192.168.1.aa to 192.168.1.zz?\n\nA: If all the computers in your network are Ubuntu or any other distribution that makes use of avahi-daemon (DNS-SD), you can get a detailed list of them (with hostname and IP address) by doing:\navahi-browse -rt _workstation._tcp\n\nIf you want to know all the IP addresses used in your network, you can use arp-scan:\nsudo arp-scan 192.168.1.0/24\n\nAs it is not installed by default, you'll have to install it with sudo apt-get install arp-scan. arp-scan send ARP packets to the local network and displays the responses received, so it shows even firewalled hosts (that block traffic based on IP packets).\n\nA: fping is a great tool to scan multiple hosts on a network via ICMP. If not installed, you can install it by:\nsudo apt-get install fping\n\nfping sends ICMP ECHO_REQUEST packets and mark a host as Up if it gets ECHO_RESPONSE from the host.\nFor example, to scan the hosts of subnet 192.168.1.0/24, you can do:\nfping -g 192.168.1.0/24\n\nFor a specific number of hosts e.g. from 192.168.1.15 to 192.168.1.140:\nfping -g 192.168.1.15 192.168.1.140\n\nfping is highly configurable e.g. how many packets will be sent, the time to wait for response, output format etc. \nCheck man fping to get more idea.\n\nA: Note to the reader: Original answer has been posted a while ago and at the time of when I was only learning shell scripting. See the revisited version below for a new and improved script that performs much faster.\nOriginal Answer\nnmap would be my #1 choice, but what if you don't have it ? The DIY way would be with a ping script that goes through each possible ip address on the network manually. What we have here is just while loop, where we set last number in the address, make silent single ping to the address, check if the command succeed or not (and if it did succeed,then host is obviously up ), and printf statement. Quick and dirty way, took me about 10 mins to write it, but runtime might be a bit slow,though.\n#!/bin/sh\n# set -x\nNUM=1\n\nwhile [ $NUM -lt 256  ];do \n    ping -q -c 1 192.168.0.$NUM > /dev/null \n    RESULT=$(echo $?)\n    if [ $RESULT -eq 0 ]; then \n        printf 192.168.0.$NUM\"\\n\"\n    fi\n    NUM=$(expr $NUM + 1)\ndone\n\nRevisited Answer\nI originally posted this answer in August of 2015. Since then I've learned  a bit more about shell scripting, and I once I saw this script, I thought it would be a good idea to revisit this answer to add a few improvements. Here's a few ideas:\n\n\n*\n\n*The script is obviously slow and ping waits for response from the host. By default, ping for two RTT, which can vary depending on how congested is your network , and as far as I understand TCP protocol doubles the wait time each time(at least according to this). So we could force ping to time out with -w 1 flag.  Since we have 256 addresses and we assume 1 second for each address, the script will take about 256/60 = 4.27 minutes.\n\n*Doing a command and then capturing its exit status with $? wasn't really necessary. The if ... then;...fi can operate on commands directly. In other words, it's sufficient to do this:\nif ping -w 1 -q -c 1 192.168.0.$NUM > /dev/null ;\nthen\n     <some other code here>\nfi\n\n\n*The printf command can be rewritten as so:\nprintf \"IP %s is up\\n\" 192.168.0.\"$NUM\"\n\nThis is more of a stylistic change, but it's consistent with how printf works and looks like in a lot of other languages, with quoting \"$NUM\" variable. Quoting here isn't necessary - since we're dealing with numbers only, we don't need to anticipate word-splitting due to having spaces in a variable.\n\n*Much better performance improvement can be achieved if we spawn several background processes.  The script edit below does exactly that. I put the ping and  printf into a function, pingf (yes, corny name, I know). Now, there's also one single main function which does the looping and calling of pingf.\n#!/bin/sh\n# Uncomment for debugging\n#set -x\npingf(){\n    if ping -w 2 -q -c 1 192.168.0.\"$1\" > /dev/null ;\n    then \n        printf \"IP %s is up\\n\" 192.168.0.\"$1\"\n    fi\n}\n\nmain(){\n\n    NUM=1\n    while [ $NUM -lt 255  ];do \n        pingf \"$NUM\" &\n        NUM=$(expr \"$NUM\" + 1)\n    done\n    wait\n}\n\nmain\n\nHow much better does that work ? Not bad, actually, takes a matter of seconds. \n$ time ./ping_script.sh                                                                      \nIP 192.168.0.1 is up\nIP 192.168.0.101 is up\nIP 192.168.0.27 is up\nIP 192.168.0.29 is up\n    0m02.50s real     0m00.01s user     0m00.12s system\n\nThings to Keep in Mind\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows ( starting since Windows 7 , I think ) have started blocking response to ICMP echo requests.

If you want more space for the root as well, delete the /home partition and recreate it smaller.\n\n*Add the two physical volumes to an LVM volume group.\n\n*Create a new LVM volume using all available space.\n\n*Restore your image onto the new volume. Expand the partition to fill the entire space using resize2fs.\n\n*Adjust your fstab to tell it to automatically mount your logical partition.\n\n\nBeware: You will lose the logical partition if either disk fails. Keep good backups.\n", "Q: no way to use opendns on pppoe connection? I have an old speedtouch usb modem (revision 0) and on my desktop with xubuntu 12.04 I've configured a pppoe connection. I can connect and my ISP assign an IP address and the DNS but the primary DNS address is not reachable by ping, the secondary yes but no address is resolved then I can't surf the web. Then I want to set the open DNS but there is bo way, if I change manually /etc/resolv.conf it is rewrited by some script (there is the flag usepeerdns on the configuration script, if I exclude it there is no way to assign any DNS server because resolv.conf is not read) also if I set not writable the file changing the default permission. I changed dhclient.conf with the code\nprepend domain-name-servers 208.67.222.222,208.67.220.220;\n\nand now if I connect by a wifi connection to my router I'm using openDNS server but ppp does not use this script as long as I can see and the DNS server is always setted by my ISP. How can I use set DNS manually to a PPP connection? Is there any way to change it after the connection? Why NetworkManager is not able to manage my dsl connection, it seems not able to manage the dsl usb cable modem.\nIf I use pppoeconf NetworkManager doesn't start and I have to manually delete the lines added to /etc/network/interfaces because the system is not able to start with full configuration of network\nIf I connect a modem-router to the same line I can surf with the DNS server assigned by my ISP, I can't figure why. Some suggestion? Thanks to all\n\nThe problem is that NetworkManager doesn't manage my usb adsl modem (speedtouch 330). Also if I try to set the interface in /etc/network/interfaces NetworkManager process doesn't start when I reboot the system and I have to restart it manually after large delay before the system is ready. In any case it is not the DNS supplied by my ISP the problem because if I address a query to the DNS server expliciting its address it answer the query, if I not explicit the dotted address of the DNS server the pc answers that no server is reachable. The file /etc/resolv.conf is a symlink to /etc/ppp/resolv.conf that is updated when I connect then I don't understand because the system does not use the DNS listed in the configuration file\n\nA: If you are using NetworkManager then you should use the Connection Editor to adjust network settings. To set your own nameserver addresses, click on the network indicator | Edit Connections...; select your connection; open the \"IPv4 Settings\" tab; change \"Automatic (DHCP)\" to \"Automatic (DHCP) addresses only\"; enter the desired nameserver addresses in the \"Additional DNS servers\" field.\n", "Q: Is is possible to use a ntfs usb disk as a liveusb with Startup Disk Creator? I have an USB harddrive with NTFS (for compatibility with windows and support of large files, so FAT is not an option). I would like to use that harddrive as LiveUSB. Ubuntu help says that it is possible, but Startup Disk Creator refuses: \nI have set the flags on the NTFS partition to boot. Is there a mistake in the documentation, or am I missing something?\n\nA: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick currently does not mention \"NTFS\" anywhere. So I'm guessing the support has been removed.\nI just tried using Rufus 2.18, Ubuntu 18.04 Desktop 64bit, and SanDisk 64 GB and it failed to boot using NTFS (i.e. drops to Grub rescue shell). It works well with FAT32 as always.\n\nA: Yes, it's possible to create a live usb with the NTFS file system to install Ubuntu, according to this article at Ubuntu Documentation, you can also use a FAT32 / FAT 16 file system.\nBe sure to carefully read the article and follow the instructions step-by-step, because I tried the same with USB Stick (with the NTFS file system) and It worked correctly.\n", "Q: How to add command-line arguments support to a Quickly 12.08.1 application?

Therefore, subj.\nAdditionally, to the Quickly developers: what was the problem with main executable being changable?\n\nA: Quickly 12.08.1 did not \"wipe\" commandline arguments from your program. It just moved them from bin/project_name to project_name/__init__.py. There you will find the parse_options function, which you can edit to your liking. \nSecond question: I can not speak for the quickly developers, but my guess would be that it is easier to upgrade a project, if you move code that has to change in every project away from code which will probably not change.\nThird point (although you did not ask...): Quickly is just a tool to help you coding. If you would like to change code inside a DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE block, just go ahead and edit it! Nothing horrible will happen. There is no magic involved, just make sure to check (with bzr diff or similar) what part of your code has changed before you commit your project.\n", "Q: WUBI install, reinstalled Windows, can't work with Ubuntu now I had installed Ubuntu in Win OS under different partition (E:) and then formatted my windows (C:), now I am not able to see the partition that had the wubi virtual disk on it (E:) and I do not get the option of booting Ubuntu OS when the PC starts up.\nKindly assist me to recover my partition (E:) and give me the steps as in what is to be done before installing the ubuntu so that it can be recovered easily next time.\nThanks,\nAmit\n\nA: This post outlines a procedure to restore Ubuntu with Wubi after reinstalling Windows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Wubi with the same version as before.

There are several ways to install an application in Ubuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can download a source tarball (generally a .tar.gz or a .tar.bz2 file) and install it manually. (See How do I install a .tar.gz (or .tar.bz2) file?)\n\n*You can download a .deb file and install it manually, using dpkg or the Software Centre.\n\n*You can search for the application in the Ubuntu Software Centre and install it there, or use apt with the official Ubuntu repositories.\n\n*You can find a PPA or a third-party repo, and install it from there.\nWhat are the pros and cons of each method? Please discuss security implications, frequency of updates and program reliability of each method in your answer.\n\nA: *\n\n*Reliability:\n\n*\n\n*When installing from a tarball, software may try to overwrite other software. Build dependencies are needed, and the process has a high failure rate. If you are installing software that packages in the repositories depend on, this will not satisfy that dependency since it is not registered with dpkg, unless you use checkinstall to temporarily convert it to a debian package. With this, you do risk breaking dpkg. Even if the code is open-source, unless you make sure it hasn't been changed, you should still download it from a trusted site. You can install multiple versions of software, as long as it uses different directories. You can override this in the makefile. \n\n*Using a debian package will ensure files do not overwrite those of other programs, however, if using sudo dpkg -i file.deb, dependencies must be installed first. When installed this way, you won't get updates unless the package is also in the repositories, but this package will satisfy dependencies requiring this software. It will also most likely give this package a menu entry or at least register manpages. Debian packages usually are tested with Lintian which makes sure packages meet or exceed a set of standards that can be quite stringent, going as far as whether certain files have any executable code or not. Multiple versions of the same package cannot be installed. A badly made package can fail to install, fail to remove, or even break DPKG, leading to difficult repairs, frantic searches for backups, or even a reinstall if the problem is serious.\n\n*Using apt is the best option when possible. Dependencies will be automatically fetched and installed, and packages are built using reliable build server configurations at launchpad, minimizing failures. Packages can be searched through aptitude or other such tools, and updates will be easily facilitated via the update manager. Since dependencies also come from apt, the package is more likely to interact with dependencies properly. Packages are tested via Lintian as with debs, but the testing, combined with highly stable build servers, make for even more stable packages. Since the packages pass through Ubuntu's build servers, most likely they will be tweaked to integrate with the rest of the OS. Multiple versions of the same package cannot be installed. Since Ubuntu's build servers are used for PPAs, there is less change you'll break apt due to auto-linitianing.\n\n\n*Updating:\n\n*\n\n*With a tarball, you will get no updates, unless the program has its own check for them. With that, you will need to install such updates manually, and they won't be consolidated in a single place. You will probably be able to get nightly or even current source code in a tarball to compile and install. If you need bleeding-edge code, that may be useful.\n\n*With debian, packages will only be updated if you have the repository for them. Developers will most likely make debian packages a bit behind the bleeding edge source, but betas are often found with debs online.\n\n*With apt, packages will be updated very easily. Updates are consolidated in one place, the update manager, and are done automatically or semi-automatically. Unless you are on an alpha or beta of Ubuntu, you will be using well-tested versions, even if they are a version or two behind the current upstream source. Security updates will be pushed as soon as they are lightly tested to make sure they don't make the situation even worse. This means that your security will be protected with timely updates, but these updates will be checked to avoid data loss.\n\n\n*Security:\n\n*\n\n*Tarballs are not digitally signed in any way. They may be mangled or modified by malicious third parties. Even if you do a hashsum(Avoid MD5), you should still trust the owner of the site and the author of the package, since they provide SHA- or MD5-sums.\n\n*Debian packages are not signed, however dpkg will not allow a debian package to overwrite the files of another, so a malicious deb can't destroy init or mess with bash by overwriting it. You should always trust the website and the author of the package.\n\n*apt uses signed keys for repositories, so they can;t be mangled without a red flag coming up. PPA uploads are digitally signed so non-owners of the PPA cannot put up broken or unsafe packages. The no-overwrite for files of another package is also enforced. Of course, you should trust the PPA or repository owner, as unchecked packages with malicious code will execute upon being run.\n\n\n\nA: The short answer is that installing from the Ubuntu Software Centre is generally preferable to all the other methods. However, there are times when you may want to install a program from somewhere else.\n\nInstalling from source:\n\n\n*\n\n*Security implications: You need to trust the authors of the software and the website that hosts the download. You should also check that the download is performed through HTTPS, otherwise, a third-party may modify the download.\n\n*Frequency of updates: You'll always get the latest and best! The updates will be as frequent as the original authors choose. However, you will need to check for updates yourself manually.\n\n*Reliability: It may not be as reliable as other methods, because the software will have gone through less testing, and may not even have been tested at all for Ubuntu, just other Linux distros.\n\n*Ease of installation and uninstallation: Most difficult out of all the options. Even experienced users may avoid this option, because they prefer using native Debian packages, which are much easier to manage.\nInstalling from a .deb package:\n\n\n*\n\n*Security implications: Same as installing from source.\n\n*Frequency of updates: Same as installing from source.\n\n*Reliability: Slightly better than installing from source. If the authors have provided a .deb package, that implies that they probably have done some minimal testing on Debian or Ubuntu.\n\n*Ease of installation and uninstallation: Very easy. Just double-click and click \"install\"! Similarly easy for uninstallation.\nInstalling from the Ubuntu Software Centre:\n\n\n*\n\n*Security implications: You need to trust the authors of the software, and the Ubuntu repo maintainers. On the whole, this is better security than installing directly from source, because the program has been reviewed to some extent by Debian and/or Ubuntu maintainers. Debian and/or Ubuntu maintainers can patch the program to fix security flaws, too, if the program is open source.\n\n*Frequency of updates: Debian and/or Ubuntu maintainers only select some releases of the software. (For example, they may only choose stable updates). There is a delay between the release of a program, and its inclusion in the Debian and/or Ubuntu repos. If you want the latest and greatest, this is not the best option. If you want stable updates that have been reviewed, this is a good option. Updates are proposed automatically through the update manager and apt-get.\n\n*Reliability: Much better than installing from source, as the program has been reviewed and adjusted for Ubuntu.\n\n*Ease of installation and uninstallation: Very, very easy.\nInstalling from a PPA or a third-party repo:\n\n\n*\n\n*Security implications: You need to trust the authors of the software, and whoever maintains the PPA. Absolutely anyone can host a PPA, so don't trust the PPA just because it's on Launchpad. The user could have been lazy and not reviewed the software at all.\n\n*Frequency of updates: It depends on the PPA. Checking for updates is easy.\n\n*Reliability: Frequently less reliable than installing from the Ubuntu Software Centre. PPAs are there for programs that do not yet meet the standards for the Ubuntu Software Centre, so they are practically guaranteed to be less reliable.\n\n*Ease of installation and uninstallation: It's not hard to learn, and it fits in well with Ubuntu's package management.\n", "Q: How to deal with bugs in proprietary legacy driver?

By that, I mean that it is the implementation of the display server for the X Window System. The Xfce Desktop Environment is somehow based on X.Org to manage windows. As I said above, X.Org is like a window manager. So, if it crashes, your desktop does not start automatically since there is no window manager and you have to do it manually.\nYour desktop customizations and settings are not functioning, since the window manager does not start at all and it does not \"remember\" the last session. Since the update, a new (sure buggy) version of X.Org may have been installed and returned every setting and customization back to default. This is probably due to the fact that a new X.Org configuration file (Xorg.conf) being generated and replacing the old one which had your settings.\nAlso, the window manager is crashing because its files may have been corrupted, or because it's buggy, or because it has problems changing, generating, or saving the X.Org configuration file.\nMore info:\n1) Xorg - ArchWiki (ArchLinux Wiki)\n2) X.Org Foundation (Original Website)\n3) X.Org Server - Wikipedia\n", "Q: Keylock indicator for Xfce panel Is there a keylock indicator applet for Xfce panel (preferably native to Xfce)?\nI have almost switched to Xfce, except for this!\n\nA: The keylock indicator plugin for Xfce4 \"shows the state of your keyboard LEDs: Caps, Scroll and Num Lock in Xfce panel.\"\nInstallation instructions for Xfce4 keylock indicator plugin:\n(Note: This works on Xfce versions 4.6 and 4.8.

When I reinstalled Ubuntu 12.10 64-bit on my SSD, I chose the option to use LVM in Ubiquity. I am trying to find out how to enable TRIM for my SSD. I came across this article:\nhttp://worldsmostsecret.blogspot.com/2012/04/how-to-activate-trim-on-luks-encrypted.html\nThe article states in addition to adding discard and noatime to /etc/fstab , discard must be added to the drive (sdX_crypt) in /etc/crypttab. My problem is the only listings in my /etc/crypttab are several cryptswap; it does not list any sdX_crypt.\nI currently have a /dev/sda1 (ext2), which is the boot point, and /dev/mapper/ubuntu-root, which is my ext4 partition.\nAny ideas as to how to enable TRIM?\n\nA: Crypttab could only be relevant if you were actually using LUKS, which you haven't mentioned.  (\"As long as LUKS is not aware that you want to use TRIM it will effectively block all TRIM operations coming from the LVM partition's file system, for security reasons\")\nIf you're not using LUKS, it will be sufficient to add the discard option to fstab.\nBe aware what you're doing.  This would start sending TRIM commands when deleting files on those filesystems.  To TRIM previously deleted files, I believe you will need to run the fstrim command.\nYou should also be aware of the \"issue_discard\" option in /etc/lvm/lvm.conf.  This controls whether TRIM is sent when LVs are shrunk or deleted.  (Again, it doesn't say anything about TRIMing space which is already free).  It's disabled by default.  Personally I would leave it that way, because I'm used to the possibilities of recovering from errors.  (And when I'm happy, I can use fstrim on the filesystem I've created... I suspect swap partitions are still issuing trim by default though).\n", "Q: Dual boot to windows 7 i just installed ubuntu 12.10 alongside windows 7 but now my computer automatically boots to ubuntu. i want windows 7 as my default operating system. when i start up my laptop it shows me no settings or any screen asking me what operating system to use. the ONLY way for me to boot into windows 7 not is to hit f12 at startup to bring up which to boot from, select my hard drive then bring up the grub loader in ubuntu, then select windows 7 loader. when i go into msconfig in windows 7 ONLY windows 7 is listed under the operating systems... i see no ubuntu at all. please help this is really annoying!\nThanks.  \n\nA: It sounds like you're dual booting Windows 7 and Ubuntu from the same hard drive.\nIf that is the case you can go into Ubuntu and edit your grub settings by opening a terminal and pressing CTRL+ALT+T.\nThere you can inputsudo gedit /etc/default/grub\nThis will open the grub settings changer and the topline should read GRUB_DEFAULT=0\nsaying that your default OS is the first one (0-th one) in the list.\nTo find out number what your Windows 7 installation is you can open another terminal window and input sudo gedit /boot/grub/grub.cfg. (It is not recommended that you edit this file as your edits will be erased from here if grub is updated) Here you can see number what your W7 installation is. Just press CTRL+F and search for windows 7.\nNow count the number of menuentries above and you will have your magic number.\nGoing back to the /etc/default/grub file change the number of GRUB_DEFAULT=0 to whatever number your W7 installation is. Save and close. \nNow open up a new terminal window and run sudo update-grub.\nYou can now reboot and by default it should boot into your W7.\nIf this does not work you can also try Boot-Repair and Grub-customizer.\nGood luck.\n\nA: Do you have Windows and ubuntu in two different hard drives?

I have also recently upgraded to 12.10, though I'm not sure if the problem started when I upgraded or after the upgrade. I also note this similar question but it is currently unanswered and I'm providing more detail\n\nA: I suggest you change the USB mode from PTP to mass storage. It should simplify connection problems since USB mass storage is more widely supported.\nI had similar problems with Ubuntu 12.10 and a camera which only had PTP mode.\nWORKAROUND: If your camera doesn't support mass storage mode, maybe it would be easier to transfer files by removing your memory card from the camera and use a card reader if your computer doesn't have a built-in reader.\n\nA: The bug mdr mentions in his comment (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gvfs/+bug/1075923) is now fixed, and a gvfs update that fixes the problem was pushed out on 2013-10-03 (http://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gvfs/1.16.1-0ubuntu1.1). So all you need to do at this point to fix this problem is update your ubuntu gvfs package.\n\nA: I am having similar issues but with copying files over SMB from my NAS. I researched some more and it seems the current version of gvfs (in (X)ubuntu 12 LTS) cannot handle too much data (in my case copying hangs after a few hundred megabytes).\nI also noticed this was logged as a bug but the latest update I saw was that they are in need for a SMB/gvfs expert to fix this.\nSee this: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gvfs/+bug/1075923\nA workaround for file servers is to do the copying over FTP, but I guess that doesn't work for cameras.\n\nA: I suggest you also try to copy your files directly from your memory card (removing it from your digital camera and inserting it in a card reader). If it's working fine, than it's an issue with your camera. If not, than your card is either too slow or it has some kind of a defect. By doing so you can narrow your problem down to \"Is it an USB-issue?\" or \"Is it a memory card issue?\". I also suggest you try using another card in your camera and USB-cable (do combinations: old card-new cable, new card-old cable, new card-new cable), which will definitely point you into the right direction.\nEDIT:\nYou can also ask your friends to use their computers as lab rats. It shouldn't be difficult to find two people - one with 12.04 and the other with 12.10. :)\nThe other thing to do (in case you have enough free space on your hard drive) is to install Ubuntu 12.04 alongside Ubuntu 12.10. One thing to remember here is to carefully handle the /home directory. If you have mounted it on a separate partition it is possible to use it as home in both installation. This however might result in overwriting configuration files etc., which is obviously not a good thing to happen. Install the second Ubuntu in such a way that it is self-contained - all directories are in the same partition, where you install it. By doing this dual boot you can see if the upgrade to 12.10 is the source of your problem. Sadly it often happens that an upgrade from one version to another results in some weird behaviour (which is also often present when you do a fresh install :D).\n\nA: \"Digikam fails to copy any at all\" ... you need to unmount the camera, and let digikam handle it and mount it ... this has worked for me\n\nA: With my Canon 100D, I need to mount the camera and open the camera folder in nautilus, and let it open. \nOnly then I can load the pictures in another nautilus (keeping the first one open) without the camera going to sleep.\nI haven't looked if the camera has a mass storage mode, though.

Or can I switch Win8 to BIOS from EFI, without having to re-install Windows? I went through a ton of boot problems and re-installing yesterday... I really don't want to have to do it again.\n\nA: *\n\n*Your PC is UEFI, so to avoid problems, you must use Xubuntu 12.10 64bit\n\n*Use the Windows tools to reduce your Windows partition. Make at least 20GB free.\n\n*If the Xubuntu installer does not detect Windows, do NOT choose \"Use the entire disk\" option or it will erase Windows. Instead, use the \"Somethingelse\" option, create a root and a SWAP partition in the free space. (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DiskSpace ), and install Xubuntu.

This is how I would get the folder: /media/michael/OS/Users/Michael, then I would make a link to Michael and drag the link to the Desktop. Any ideas on how to get the link to stay?\n\nA: Well your link most probably doesn't work because after rebooting your partition, on which you have your Windows installed, is unmounted. In Nautilus (the file browser) you simply need to click onto the partition and than it automatically mounts it for you (I suppose you did this when making the shortcut).\nIf your partition is not mounted, the shortcut will not work. That means, you would need to click on your partition in Nautilus first (to mount it) and will than be able to follow your shortcut.\n\nA: I agree with @Dominik that the problem most probably is that the windows partition is not set to automount at boot.\nTo do that you need to modify your fstab file.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal (Ctrl + Alt + T) anf type sudo blkid\n\n*Identify your drive and copy the UUID of the windows partition.\n\n*Create the OS folder in /media/michael. \n\n*Press Alt + F2 and type gksudo gedit /etc/fstab\n\n*Add a line at the end like this UUID={your UUID here}  /media/michael/OS   ntfs    uid=1000,gid=1000,dmask=027,fmask=137   0   0\n\n*Save the file and reboot.\nYour partition will mount at boot and shortcuts should \"stick\".\n\n\nA: This is because Ubuntu by default doesn't automatically mount partitions on local disk. You can config /etc/fstab to auto mount the disk to a static mount point in /media and keep the link alive on every boot.\nI assume your /media/michael is a NTFS partition. Run mount and see which device currently holds this partition. For example:\n/dev/sda3 on /media/michael type fuseblk [...]\n\nUnmount the disk in Nautilus. Create the folder /media/michael (because it's created automatically whenever you hand-mount the partition in Nautilus).\nsudo mkdir /media/michael\n\nThen edit /etc/fstab with your favorite text editor (nano if you're not sure) and add a new line like this:\n/dev/sda3 /media/michael ntfs-3g defaults 0 0\n\nRun sudo mount -a then you're done.\n", "Q: Grub-Efi wrong resolution My question, as it comes from the title, related to grub, but it's a different thing. \nI re-installed Windows 7 and Ubuntu 12.10 in UEFI mode (before that I was using normal BIOS) and everything went perfectly fine. Both systems load as they should but there is one thing that keeps bothering me. The problem is before I installed both systems in UEFI I used to boot in both system using common grub (non-uefi) and resolution in this grub was correct (which is 1366x768). Right now with grub-efi I have wrong resolution (which is seems to be 640x480). \nSo my question is can can I safely set grub-resolution using grub config files or issue is related to something else? (for instance graphics card).\nI am using Ubuntu 12.10\nIntel HD 3000 + Nvidia GT 540M Optimus (I am using bumblebee)\nKernel 3.5.0-19-generic\nall updates installed! I also added ubuntu x-swat ppa for drivers.\nThank you for your help!\n\nA: I had the same issue as the Nikki until today, when I fixed it accidentally by making a hardware configuration change.\nMy hardware is different from the Nikki's. I am using the Intel graphics built into my Dell Optiplex 7010.\nSince I changed from legacy boot to UEFI, the grub menu had been displayed at a low resolution, while the frame buffer continued to use the desired resolution of 2560 x 1440.\nToday, I was cleaning-up the 7010's system configuration. On the page at Settings -> General -> Advanced Boot Options, I found a checked checkbox labelled 'Enable Legacy option ROMs'. I cleared this box, saved the configuration, and booted. To my surprise, the grub menu was now displayed at 2560 x 1440.\nPerhaps others may be able to resolve this issue by removing remnants of support for legacy booting from their hardware configurations.\n\nA: According to the Arch Linux wiki entry on GRUB, you can set the screen resolution in GRUB with the GRUB_GFXMODE option, as in:\nGRUB_GFXMODE=1024x768x32\nGRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX=keep\n\nYou must enter these lines in /etc/default/grub and then do a grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg to have them \"take.\" That said, I've never tried this, so I can't promise it'll work or offer much additional help if it doesn't.\nAnother option is to user another boot manager. In particular, my rEFInd offers a configuration file option called resolution that you can use to set the resolution, as in:\nresolution 1366 768\n\nEFI firmware, though, provides a limited set of options for screen resolutions, so you might find that your preferred resolution just won't work. If so, rEFInd will notify you of this fact when you reboot and tell you what resolutions are supported.\nYou can install rEFInd so that it chainloads to GRUB or so that it boots a Linux 3.3.0 or later kernel directly. Unfortunately, Ubuntu doesn't set itself up in a way that's optimal for rEFInd, but you can reconfigure it without too much difficulty. See the rEFInd documentation on booting Linux for details.\n\nA: I have the same issue on my Lenovo Thinkpad W520 (4270CTO) and here is what I learned from a user named \"someotherguy\" in Lenovo Support Forums:\nThe UEFI BIOS has a spec version. Mine is 2.0.In order to have advanced features like access BIOS from Windows 8,having high resolutions in bootloaders,etc the UEFI spec version must be at least 2.3.1.\nI suppose something like that may happen to your PC as well.I might be wrong though.\nPlease note that the update version of UEFI BIOS IS NOT the same as the specification version.\n", "Q: How to run some alias command in bash's non-interactive mode I want to run some alias command in bash's non-interactive mode.

How to do it properly? I am thinking of upgrading my old ATI/AMD Radeon 4870 to nVidia (610 or 620, maybe 630). I am not playing games. I like Compiz effects though.

The main issue I'm running into is signing the .dsc and .changes files. What I'm trying to do is sign the packages with gpg rather than having debuild do it. This way I can sign the files automatically with the gpg option --passphrase-fd 0.\nSo I use debuild with the options -uc and -us and then clearsign the files with gpg.

Having a passphrase on it wouldn't improve the security very much, if the Jenkins job would have to know the passphrase, so one might as well just leave it unprotected.\nIf you really want to sign the .dsc and .changes files by hand, sign them with gpg --clearsign, and rename the .asc files over the originals.\n", "Q: Can not get to login screen, background starts with terminal prompt only My uncle has Ubuntu on his work PC.

Maybe it is in conflict with XFCE's native notification daemon..\nApparently, when it comes to notification daemons, there can be only one.. unfortunately, the right one does not get run, and the packages aren't marked to conflict. XFCE developers closed the bug report, so I assume that according to XFCE developers, you are not supposed to have Gnome and XFCE installed on the same system.\nWhy not just remove one? XFCE's notification daemon isn't tied to XFCE AFAIK (though I haven't actually used it under any DE other than XFCE), although it does rely on xfconf. Both NotifyOSD and xfce4-notifyosd are both implementations of the FreeDesktop Notification Standard so notifications would work equally well under any of them (although I prefer xfce4-notifyosd as it provides an 'X' button on notifications without patching and it has support for buttons on notifications).\nSince NotifyOSD is totally unconfigurable (and it's meant to be \"just there\" hence why you can't close its notifications manually and why it doesn't support buttons on notifications), XFCE can't change its settings. To do what you want, you can either get rid of NotifyOSD and use XFCE's notification daemon (which will start once NotifyOSD goes) or get rid of xfce4-notifyosd and use leolik's patched NotifyOSD which does let you set the position of its notifications. \nIf you're running Precise (which is what I suspect as xfce4-notifyosd in Natty would actually conflict because they share a file), however, leolik's PPA does not have a Precise build.\nLong-story-short...remove one of the notify applications.\nsource\n", "Q: My Amd switchable Graphic Card is not recognized My graphics card is not being recognized.

You'll end up with a plain text file containing one link per line.\nNow open terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T), enter directory you saved the file (for example: cd Documents) and run:\ncat <name-of-csv-file> | { while read; do wget $REPLY; done; }\n\nOf course, replace <name-of-csv-file> with the CSV file name.\n\nA: If you want it automated, you should create a script using an xls parser such as http://www.python-excel.org/ and then pass that to wget to download the file specified in the url.\nThis involves using a number of tools to automate this process.\nAlternately if you don't think you have the skills (and don't know who to pay to write the script for you) you can copy the url and paste it into firefox and File > Save As, this might take some time to do manually.\n", "Q: Highlights in Libreoffice Writer cannot be undone in Office Word I am used to making highlights in texts \n\n\nBut sometimes after saving the document as .doc I have to open it on a windows OS and cannot undo the highlight. (I haven't checked it in Word 2007 yet)\nIs there a solution/workaround to this?\n\nA: UPDATE 2017: This bug was fixed in recent 5+ versions of LibreOffice.\nLooks like it was a known issue in OpenOffice: https://issues.apache.org/ooo/show_bug.cgi?id=24317\nThe bug is presented as:\n1) Highlight some word in OOo\n2) export document to DOC\n3) Open this document in Word - highlighting is visible\n4) Try to remove highlighting in Word - nothing happened\nThe issue should be similar in LibreOffice and so you should be able to remove the highlighting by doing:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the highlighted text \n\n*Go to Format, Character and then remove the background (format->paragraph->shading: set to \"no fill\")\n\n*Maybe you should remove also some text effects (not sure)\n\n\n\n(The 'highlight' option in Libre/Open Office corresponds in MSOffice not to 'highlight', but to 'Shading'. In the old menu of MSO, that is in Format/Borders and Shading/Shading. In MSO 2007 go to Menu, and in the Paragraph group click the bottom right button and look for 'Borders and Shading'.)\n\nA: I began a document in MS Word and later opened it in Libre Office.\nI had highlighted some words which I was unable to un-highlight in Libre. \nWhat didn't work:\nI tried no fill options in the highlighter\nI tried no fill under format character/background option\nWhat did work:\nCtrl + M\nOr in the format menu at the top click \"clear direct formatting\"\n\nA: Edit: As @N0rbert and @dan_s point out, the bug is fixed in the newest versions of LibreOffice. However, for removing highlighting from text in old LibreOffice files, you can press the Clear All Formatting button, and then re-apply all of the intended formatting. \n", "Q: acpi_listen only detects every other backlight hotkey press I am trying to get the LCD backlight brightness control to work properly on my new ASUS G75VW-DH72 laptop in Ubuntu 12.10.

My PC only has 1GB of RAM and is struggling a little. What steps can I take to reduce the memory overhead of the standard install? If it makes a difference, I use Firefox, and a terminal most of the time.\nSimply running those two applications I see:\nfree -m\n            total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\n\nMem:           938        873         64          0          5      167\n-/+ buffers/cache:        701        237\nSwap:          959        158        801\n\n\nA: You can easily install and try out different desktop environments (instead of the default, Unity). Once installed, you can switch between different desktop environments at the log-in screen (there is an icon near your name, which, when clicked, allows you to select).\nProbably in your case, with 1GB ram, I would suggest the lubuntu desktop (based on LXDE). To install, open a terminal and type\nsudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop\n\nIf you don't want the whole environment, you can install LXDE by itself\nsudo apt-get install lxde\n\nMost everything will be the same but you'll have a new look that is less memory intensive (see many screenshots HERE). Firefox will be there, and the terminal will look a little different.\nIf you don't like the LXDE look, you can read about other desktop environments HERE. Options include Xfce (Xubuntu) and KDE (Kubuntu). \n\nA: The web Browser\nFirefox\nFirefox is the default web browser of Ubuntu. It is a great browser but is not recommended for computers with minimal resources, since this has a large memory consumption.

Is there a debian/ubuntu policy on softlinking things to another location in opt once they're installed properly in usr/share or usr/lib?  \nHere's a simple example:\nPackaging up dnsenum.  It's a REALLY simple package (4 files).\nA perl script, two wordlists, and a readme.  \nSo from what I gather:\nThe wordlists should go in usr/share/dnsenum/*\nThe perl script itself would go in usr/lib/dnsenum/\nThe readme would go in usr/share/doc/dnsenum/  \nAdd a wrapper bash script that goes in bin and just passes arguments to dnsenum.pl.  \nThe question is this:  \nIf there are various tools that provide wordlists or some other shared resource, is there a policy on linking all the wordlists from different packages in to /opt/wordlists/ ?  \nIt seems like the \"right\" thing to do respecting the directory structure while still making things convenient.\n\nA: Ubuntu follows the FHS. Ubuntu packages install everything into /usr/. Runtime data can live in /var/lib/PACKAGENAME, and some critical early-boot things that live outside /usr, in /bin, /lib, etc.\nSo, your wordlists would go into /usr/share/dnsenum, yes. The script would probably just go into /usr/bin, and the documentation would go into /usr/share/doc/dnsenum.\nUbuntu doesn't put anything in /opt. However, third party applications distributed through the software centre have everything in /opt, to keep them separated from the rest of the system. These are not part of the distribution.\nThere's nothing special about data that's shared between packages, assuming it's still owned by a single package, depended on, by the others.\nAn example for word lists is /usr/share/dict/words, provided by dictionaries-common. \n", "Q: How do you adjust screen brightness on Acer laptop? I have an Acer Aspire one 5742 laptop. I installed Linux Ubuntu 12.10 on it. I have one problem with it. no matter how I press the Fn+↑ or Fn+↓ keys I cannot adjust the Screen Brightness.

The intent was to use Ubuntu when the USB is inserted and Windows when it is not. But now I receive a prompt asking me to choose the operating system I want to boot, even when I have no USB inserted. It's redundant and unnecessary. Is there a way to remove that so that it loads Ubuntu when it is there and Windows when it is not, like it is supposed to?\n\nA: Grub-bootloader will be installed in the first HDD (this is by default). So if you didn't change that manually , then grub is now installed in /dev/sda , which is your HDD and not USB. \nAs a solution I suggest \n1) Boot from CD/DVD of Windows and fix MBR. (repair - option) \n2) Reinstall Ubuntu and make sure that grub-bootloader will be installed in the USB (and not HDD). USB can be /dev/sdb or /dev/sdc ...etc (but not /dev/sda). You will see this option if you choose \"something else\" during installation.\n3) If you want to achieve this goal  \n\nit loads Ubuntu when it is there and Windows when it is not\n\nyou have to \"play\" with BIOS all the time. If you have \"one boot key\" which allows you to select a device to boot (at my laptop is F12) then is easier. But if you don't have this key , anytime you want to boot in to Ubuntu you have to go in to BIOS configuration page and change the boot-device order and place fist the USB (you have already attached).\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 on Dell Mini 9: direct me to screen aspect ratio directions?

All the discussions I see are for other hardware. I am not so surefooted with terminal commands in general, though I was able to install the OS, so I am not terrible either. But what I have found is that if it's not for my machine, it won't work. The only option I have now is 800x600.

I just upgraded to Ubuntu 12.10, am fooling around with some Python code. In earlier releases, I used to be able to do:  \nimport speechd\n\nAnd now I get that the module does not exist.

Thank you in advance - I searched everywhere but I couldn't find anything.\nEDIT:\nI did a little digging, and this seems to be an issue with Python 2.7, since python3-speechd is installed but not python-speechd. The following works: \npython3 -c \"import speechd\"\n\nbut this does NOT (can't find module speechd):\npython2.7 -c \"import speechd\"\n\nIt would be great to get this working with Python 2.7.\nSECOND EDIT:\nI tried installing python-speechd from here: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/quantal/i386/python-speechd/0.7.1-6ubuntu3\nBut it said that it's installation conflicted with python3-speechd. \n\nA: As part of the migration of both Orca and Ubuntu to Python 3, the Python Speech Dispatcher bindings have been migrated to Python 3 and no longer support Python 2. Technically, it would be easy for those bindings to support Python 2 and to package Python 2 bindings, but it has not been done.\nWhat can you do about it?\n\n\n*\n\n*I suggest that you use Python 3, which is the way forward and the only way to be able to continue using speechd from Python in the future.\n\n*You can try to install Speech Dispatcher 0.7.1 manually: it's the last version with the Python 2 bindings. See the INSTALL file.\n\n*Another solution is to downgrade Ubuntu to 12.04, which is a bad idea but can be done with some fighting: see this Ask Ubuntu question on downgrading.\n\n", "Q: collecting data, saving it into a file and rerun it again in bash script; I'm new to bash and have written this script to collect data then save it to an automated file.

You'll need to throw it away and rewrite it, using a different approach. Hint: Whatever the user types will be stored in the variable you pass to read. You'll be testing that value, so consider carefully what the user needs to type and how you can communicate that. Hint 2: Type help select to see the documentation for a good way to approach this.\n\n*Finally, a really valuable tool for debugging your script is set -x. Put it at the top of your script.

I guess ubuntu deletes all files from guest account on shutdown. \nCan you please guide me to recover those lost files.\nThanks\n\nA: Ubuntu's Guest account is a special type of account, which has its home directory set to the mount point of a tmpfs filesystem, which is used to store data which does not need to be persisted after a reboot.\nThe data in tmpfs is stored in RAM backed up by the swap space, so it is likely the data had never been written to disk in the first place, so there's basically nothing to recover.\nMore details on tmpfs.\nIf you're curious how guest account is set up, you can study /usr/sbin/guest-account, which is a shell script used to create/remove a guest account.\n\nA: Try TestDisk:\nsudo apt-get install testdisk\n\nIt's an all purpose filesystem recovery tool.

The solution was getting into BIOS setup and changing the order for boot loaders.  After installing Ubuntu 12.04LTS it would only boot directly to Windows--I could no longer hit F2 when the initial Asus logo came up to get into BIOS setup!  I then discovered that hitting ESC when the Asus logo came up would bring up a DOS-like box (remember those?), and the bottom item said \"Setup\".  Selecting \"Setup\" then entered the BIOS setup.  Under the boot tab were four possibilities.  #1 was Windows 8, and #2 was Ubuntu.  Making the Ubuntu #1 did it.  When powering up the GRUB menu now appears.\nOn the surface is what it looks like is that BIOS has a selection of boot loaders that it uses.

I would like to make it match the App Menu and all other menus.\n\n\nA: You can set the opacity from Compiz Config Settings Manager (install it by sudo apt-get install ccsm). Open CCSM and go to Accessibility page, Then check the opacity brightness and saturation option if not already checked. Then click the same button to go view its options.\nIn there you'll find the tab Opacity, in this tab clikc on the New button in bottom and enter the values:  \nWindow: DropdownMenu\nWindow Rules: 75  \n\nWindow: popupmenu\nWindow Rules: 75  \n\nWindow: Menu\nWindow Rules: 75\n\nand back.\nCompiz might crash when you check the button but dont worry about that.

We are trying to develop a painting area with integrated tools to draw lines, circles, selection tool and trying to enhance the image manipulation process.\nIs it possible do the things in text view or drawing area?\ntkinter, pygame, cairo which one is the best package to develop these components?\n\nA: I have no experience of the first two examples you give, but it's certainly possible, and indeed relatively easy, using cairo. Using Python, you can hook it up with PyCairo and GTK3. \nThe general idea would be to create a GTK DrawingArea and use the cairo context to draw what you want. Here's the shortest snippet I can come up with to give you the general idea: \n#!/usr/bin/env python\nfrom gi.repository import Gtk\n\ndef draw(widget, ctx):\n    ctx.set_source_rgba(1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0)\n    ctx.move_to(0,0)\n    ctx.rel_line_to(100.0,100.0)\n    ctx.stroke()\n\nwin = Gtk.Window()\nda = Gtk.DrawingArea()\nwin.add(da)\nwin.connect(\"delete-event\", Gtk.main_quit)\nda.connect(\"draw\", draw)\nwin.show_all()\nGtk.main()\n\nYou could use Glade to handle building the GUI. If you felt so inclined, you could even use Quickly (sudo apt-get install quickly, getting started) to help get you started... quickly! Then it becomes as easy as quickly design, quickly edit, quickly run. Granted, it's a long way from a fully developed IDE experience such as VS (shudders), or Eclipse, but for this sort of scripting it's okay.\nUnfortunately, documentation is rather patchy for GTK3 under Python, since almost all the docs are for C/CPP. There are however various basic tutorials on the web to get you started, and it's generally quite easy to figure things out. \nAlso, be aware that since GTK3 has been rolled out, PyGTK is essentially defunct; but a lot of documentation for it still exists on the web, and it's not always made explicitly clear that it relates to PyGTK instead of GTK3. Keep an eye out for that to ensure you don't lose time heading down the wrong path! Remember: PyGTK imports gtk,gdk,gobject; whilst GTK3 goes through gi.\n", "Q: Curl and system proxy I am currently forwarding all my traffic through a ssh tunnel:\nssh -ND 8080 user@remote-machine\n\nAnd have set the system socks5 proxy (in system settings under network section) to 127.0.0.1:8080. Everything works fine, Google Chrome and other programs are using the socks proxy as supposed to.\nThe problem comes when I'm trying to use curl (either in terminal or using it in PHP).\nWhat I get is this:\nuser@laptop:~$ curl -v google.com\n* About to connect() to proxy 127.0.0.1 port 8080 (#0)\n*   Trying 127.0.0.1... connected\n> GET HTTP://google.com HTTP/1.1\n> User-Agent: curl/7.22.0 (i686-pc-linux-gnu) libcurl/7.22.0 OpenSSL/1.0.1 zlib/1.2.3.4 libidn/1.23 librtmp/2.3\n> Host: google.com\n> Accept: */*\n> Proxy-Connection: Keep-Alive\n> \n* Empty reply from server\n* Connection #0 to host 127.0.0.1 left intact\ncurl: (52) Empty reply from server\n* Closing connection #0\n\nI tried to google around but couldn't find anything relevant. So how do I get curl to work with system proxy (if present)? I would like to be able to setup an alias that would work with both cases (proxy and no proxy) because I will not be always willing to use the proxy.\n\nA: For HTTP proxy, use -x.\nHave a $HOME/.curlrc with\n-x 127.0.0.1:8080\n\nor make aliases using curl -x 127.0.0.1:8080 ... for proxy use.\nFor SOCKS proxy, looking at man curl says:\n\n   --socks5 <host[:port]>\n          Use the specified SOCKS5 proxy - but resolve the host name locally. \n          If the port number is not specified, it is assumed at port 1080.\n\n          This option overrides any previous use of -x, --proxy, as they are mutually exclusive.\n\n\nSo, use curl --socks5 127.0.0.1:8080, ie. curl --socks5 $socks_proxy.\n", "Q: how do i install ubuntu without using all harddrive space I want to install Ubuntu without using all the space on my hard drive.

In Precise and in Quantal it's version 9.8.1. The original developer (ISC) currently provide versions 9.8.4 which is a bugfix release in the 9.8 line, and 9.9.2 which is a \"new features\" branch. It looks like when a security issue is encountered, the specific bugfix is backported into 9.8.1.\nNow the question: Why maintainers don't just update to the latest bugfix release ? Why to backport only certain patches ? Is it intentionally or just there's no maintaner who would take the effort to update to the latest bugfix release ?\n\nA: Ubuntu's policy on this is described on the Stable Release Updates page in the Wiki.\nThese policies are all driven by the (perfectly reasonable) fear of introducing regressions and causing inconvenience to existing users for bugs which didn't otherwise affect them. If bind9 is updated in a stable release and production servers fail or unacceptably change behaviour as a result, then that's a disaster for Ubuntu. Users will legitimately complain that a stable release failed to remain stable for them, and many would not consider \"upstream did it\" as a reasonable excuse; especially for the majority of them for whom the bugfix update was unnecessary anyway. \"Unacceptably change behaviour\" can mean different things for different users; for a stable release, any change in behaviour may be deemed unacceptable.\nThe SRU policy of minimal, verifiable fixes to stable releases only serves to prevent this scenario.\nIf upstreams provide bugfix releases, then these can approved for acceptance on a standing basis, subject to the micro release exceptions policy.\nBut most packages in Ubuntu are based on Debian. Deviating from Debian always comes at the cost of extra work and so this kind of change can only be done if someone can commit to maintaining the extra burden that this creates.\nThe stable release team makes decisions on individual updates, and the technical board makes decisions on standing micro release exceptions.\nPerhaps bind's bugfix release branch is suitable for a micro release exception. In this case, somebody needs to drive, gather the upstream policy, regression history and so forth, put together a proposal and put it forward to the technical board for consideration.\n", "Q: Can some one tell me the major differences between Ubuntu 11.10 and 12.04?

It is probably not recommended to go messing with cryptsetup unless you want to brick your machine!!\nProbably about the best you could do would be to write a custom plymouth script (or probably more realistically modify an existing one) to override the message that cryptsetup asks plymouth to display and always display the text that you want instead.\nAssuming you haven't changed it the default ubuntu plymouth theme is ubuntu-logo defined in this script:\n/lib/plymouth/themes/ubuntu-logo/ubuntu-logo.script\n\nYou will need to modify the display_password_callback function I think. Take a backup first!!!\nOnce done you need to run the following to install your custom script:\nsudo update-initramfs -u\n\nI strongly suggest you take a look at the links at the bottom of this page to learn about plymouth scripting (and in particular read about how to test your scripts...you don't want to discover you have a serious bug in your script during a real boot)\n", "Q: Can I have ipsec-tools working for non standard ports?

Anyone please let me know how to recover this data...\n\nA: First of all, get rid of your Wine folder, be careful to backup any data in it before you do this:\nrm -rf ~/.wine\nrm -rf ~/.local/share/applications/wine\nAfter that, get rid of all your .exe files with:\n (You will loose ALL your exe files!) \nsudo find / -name \"*.exe\" -delete\nWhen finished, reboot, and see if the issue is resolved. If not, issue the command:   \nsudo dpkg-reconfigure -a\n", "Q: My partition table is facing limitations; having problems creating more partitions I first noticed an issue when trying to install Linux Mint 14 as a third OS alongside Ubuntu 12.10 and Windows 7 - I was unable to create another partition to install Mint to.\nPoking around, I realised that I had reached the limit of primary partitions: (from left to right of the table) 1) a ~100 MB primary partition that I meant to use for storing Grub files but never got down to, 2) a 25 GB extended partition, with the entire partition containing an ext4 Ubuntu partition, 3) a ~513 GB partition containing Windows 7, 4) some ~50 GB of unallocated space, and finally 5) a 4 GB swap partition. \nI decided to wipe off the first ~100 MB partition, which I didn't need anyway. This brought me to a dilemma, however: as Ubuntu, during initial installation, had created an extended partition for itself, which meant that I could not create any more. Having an extended partition for Ubuntu is virtually useless as there is only enough space to contain Ubuntu itself, and the benefits of extended are worthless here. And if I go ahead and install Mint now, I would face the same issue of too many primary partitions in the future should I want to create any more.\nWhat I'd really like to do is this: convert the current extended partition into a normal primary partition, and create a new extended partition in the unallocated space for all future partitions. Is this possible, and if so how? Thanks in advance!\n\nA: My FixParts program can convert from primary to logical and vice-versa, albeit with some caveats concerning what's legal in terms of MBR partition layouts. If I understand your layout and goals, FixParts should do what you need. This is likely to be safer than using fdisk or parted, since there's less room for user error. I'd recommend also converting the swap partition to a logical while you're at it, since that will reduce your primary partition count to 3, giving your more options should you ever need another primary partition. If you convert your swap space to a logical partition, you'll then need to use GParted to resize the extended partition that FixParts will create around the swap partition. It's best to do all of this from an emergency disc.\n\nA: You can use parted.  Put it into sector mode with unit s, and note the exact start and end sector of the logical partition, then delete it and the extended partition containing it, then create a new primary partition with the exact same start and end sectors as the previous logical partition.  Then you can install mint and it will be able to create a new extended partition in the free space.\n", "Q: Did \"sudo dconf reset -f /org/compiz\". How to restore /org/compiz gsettings from backup? I'm using 12.04. I executed:\n  sudo dconf reset -f /org/compiz\n\nNow changing settings in CompizConfig Settings Manager (ccsm) has no effect. For example, changing the number of desktops has no effect. I found that the number of desktops is now controlled by the Gsettings registry, which I suppose may not be connected to the 12.04 ccsm (ccsm Preferences says it is using the GConf backend, there is no Gsettings or dconf option there).\nThat's OK, but my Place Windows stopped working and I don't know how to configure it now. Presumably a previous upgrade migrated my GConf compiz entries to GSettings and at that time ccsm stopped working and I didn't notice because I wasn't trying to change anything -- but now perhaps i have wiped out the Place Windows and other settings that were migrated, how do i re-migrate them? I would actually like to just put things back to where they were before I executed sudo dconf reset. I have a backup of my hard drive available, I just need to know which files to rollback. I tried rolling back the .config, .gconf, and .cache directories, to no avail. Which files is Gsettings storing stuff in, and how do i read the entries in those files in my backups directly to confirm that they contain org.compiz entries? Alternately, how do i manually redo the GConf->Gsettings migration for compiz, if there even was one?\nIncidentally, where is the documentation for this sort of thing (which documentation specifies where Unity and Compiz store config settings?)? And where does dconf store things? And where is dconf's documentation? http://dag.wieers.com/home-made/dconf/dconf.1.html says nothing about the 'reset' command, and it says it stores things in /var/log/dconf, but nothing was there. Are there two things named 'dconf'?\nthanks,\n  bayle\n\nA: You used sudo the reset personal configuration files inside your home folder, that made the files changed by the reset owned by root.\nTo set that back that you need to open a terminal and type this when logged in to your account:\nsudo chown -R $USER:$USER $HOME\n\nIt will reset all files ownership inside your home folder back to your user and you will be able to use CCSM again.\nNext time you need to reset your compiz (or another config tree) just use dconf reset -f /org/compiz, you don't need sudo to change your own files inside your home folder.\n", "Q: How to recover lost partition and files after installation of Ubuntu on Windows partition?

Guest additions are installed properly to the best of my knowledge. But the resizing options are greyed out. The screen stays the same size in full screen and scaled option and \"adjust window size\" stays the same.\nWhats am I doing wrong? How do I fixit?\nLet me know if you need any specific information.\n\n\nA: In a server guest you likely have no XServer running. Virtualbox Guest Additions will load a virtual graphics drive to e.g. enable resizing the screen. However this driver depends on a running XServer and hence will be of no use in Ubuntu server.\n\nIn Linux and Solaris guests, VirtualBox graphics and mouse integration goes through the X Window System. Virtual Box User Manual\n\nThe only benefit from guest additions is that you are able to access Virtual Box Shared Folders. This however can (and to my opinion should) also be done with networking, independent of guest additions.\n\nA: Don't bother installing Guest Additions, it won't help you resize the terminal. Instead SSH into your Ubuntu VM using a program like PuTTY. You can customize and resize a PuTTY terminal very easily. Using an SSH Client also helps you avoid bloating your server with unnecessary software.\n", "Q: Nautilus missing menubar in 12.10 I installed gnome-shell right away, and then i noticed that Nautilus main menubar (File, Edit and such menus) is missing.

What would be a command to do that?\nthe way of adding tabs is :tabe filename or from terminal for multiple documents \nvim -p file1, file2\nI guess there are more that I don't know, I hope this is doable.\nThanks.\n\nA: Yes, this is possible with vim's server mode. Start a vim-server with:\nvim --servername somename\n\nNow you can send commands to it with --remote, --remote-send and others.\nTo achieve what you want, start a server with a known name, send the :tabe commands with:\nvim --servername somename --remote-send ':tabe filename<cr>'\n\nNote the same commands work for gvim. If this should work from within another program, you need to start the vim-server prior to any --remote-send commands.

Can I oops install Ubuntu alongside Windows 8?\n\nA: I have installed Ubuntu and Windows 8. \nFirst I installed Windows 8 and after this I installed Ubuntu,  but not inside Windows 8. I installed it on a separate partition and everything works fine. \n\nA: It should work fine on most PCs. If you've never used Ubuntu before I'd recommend trying the Windows Installer(WUBI) to make a Temporary Ubuntu Install and try it out first. After you've finished with it you just Uninstall it from \"Add/Remove Programs\" in Windows. EDIT: WUBI currently has issues with Windows 8 that have yet to be resolved see This Post.\nIf you feel you want a permanent install of Ubuntu please refer to this guide:\nWindowsDualBoot - Community Ubuntu Documentation\n\nA: This is an issue that I believe to have solved- it is like this problem here\nMy suggestion (and it's only a suggestion) is to tpe \"msconfig\" (without the quotes) on the Windows 8 start screen. In the boot tab, see if Ubuntu is listed. If it is, select the entry by highlighting it and click on \"Set as default\". This should hopefully load the Ubuntu bootloader instead of Windows' boot menu allowing you you boot into Ubuntu.\nAlso, from the start screen type in \"uefi\" and in the settings option on the seach charm, click on \"Advanced start up options\", click on it. Scroll down to the bottom of the entry and under \"Advanced start up\", click Restart now. You should now have an option to change the boot order.\nI know it is the same solution to another one but to me the core problem is the same- Windows 8 bootloader\nHope this works!\nBen\n", "Q: How do I change which audio jacks are used for input and output? I'm using a Realtek HD audio card built-in my motherboard. The Windows driver comes with a control panel that allows me to select which back panel jacks are used for what. So for example I can make both the blue jack and green jack for output and only the red one for mic-in. (Whereas by default, the blue jack is for line in, which I never need.)\nHow can I do the same under Linux? If possible, please don't suggest something that involves PulseAudio or JACK; I'd like to do it the plain way, e.g. by editing ALSA configuration files, if possible. The way I understand it, my problem should have nothing to do with software servers redirecting streams, just instructing the driver to treat this jack as so and so because it's hardware supported.\nThank you very much!\n\nA: Another gui tool might be hdajackretask from the alsa-tools-gui package. Very simple gui, supports boot override and advanced options.\n\nI hope I didn't misunderstand the question entirely. OP asked for non-JACK-options but I am pretty sure this might help someone else out. In my case, I had to check Advance override and Show unconnected pins and set an unconnected microphone input to a headphone output.. very weird, but works. Would love to see a cmd line solution though\n\nA: I managed to do it, but changes revert after rebooting. (Update: This can be worked around; see the bottom of this post.)\nI did it via a GUI in python called HDA Analyzer that can be fetched and used from the ALSA website like the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*wget -O run.py http://www.alsa-project.org/hda-analyzer.py\n\n*sudo python run.py (Their page doesn't say sudo, but if you don't do it with sudo, it will download the scripts but fail to run them and complain about privileges.)\nNow this will make the GUI start, but its usage is not explained, and it's not exactly newbie-friendly. So to make life easier I'll explain how I did it. In my case, it was a matter of two clicks; the tricky part was locating exactly what needs to be clicked.\n(Note: You may explore all the nodes one by one, but don't modify anything you don't understand. Any modification (e.g. ticking a checkbox) becomes effective immediately; there's no apply button.)\n\n\n*\n\n*The list contains many nodes called Node[0x##] followed by any of AUD_OUT, AUD_IN, AUD_MIX, PIN and VENDOR. The only ones you have to look in are the PIN ones.\n\n*There are multiple types of PIN nodes; the type we want will fill the whole window with panels/control groups (It helps to stretch or maximize the window), as in this screenshot. (The site prevented me from inserting the image inline, sorry.)\n\n*Inside the Config Default field, some nodes will have in the first line Jack Connection: N/A; we need the ones that say Jack Connection: Jack as in the screenshot.\n\n*To change a Line-In to an output jack, look until you find the node that says Jack Type: Line In. (And notice the Jack Location2: Rear and Jack Color: Blue.)\n\n*Then, in the three checkboxes in the Widget Control group below, uncheck IN and check OUT.\n\n*Using the same way, you can assign any of the front or rear jacks to either input or output.\nNow if you close the window, it will ask whether you want to revert changes. Saying yes reverts them immediately; saying no keeps them but only for this session.\nIf you want to keep your changes permanently, don't close HDA Analyzer yet. Instead, click \"Exp\" (Export) at the bottom-left and use Save As to write the python script to a file. Now copy that file to something like /etc/hda-mods.py and edit /etc/rc.local as root (e.g. using gksudo gedit /etc/rc.local) and add the line python /etc/hda-mods.py right before the exit 0 line, then save it and reboot. Your changes should survive.\n", "Q: Postgresql - configuring as Upstart job problem I need Postgresql configured to start with the Upstart system because I use Upstarts events to start another app which depends on pgsql to be running. This is the tutorial/script I've used:\nhttp://bradleyayers.blogspot.com/2011/10/upstart-job-for-postgresql-91-on-ubuntu.html\nWhen I restart the server (shutdown -r now), postgresql isnt running (not visible as a job via 'top' command). I then tried running only the following command manually:\nroot@server:~# exec su -c \"/usr/lib/postgresql/9.1/bin/postgres -D /var/lib/postgresql/9.1/main -c config_file=/etc/postgresql/9.1/main/postgresql.conf\" postgres\n\nAnd my ssh session simply disconects not returning anything. If I reconnect and again check running jobs, pgsql is still not running. So I tried running the command without 'exec' and here is the response:\nroot@server:~# su -c \"/usr/lib/postgresql/9.1/bin/postgres -D /var/lib/postgresql/9.1/main -c config_file=/etc/postgresql/9.1/main/postgresql.conf\" postgres\n\n2012-12-03 19:31:36 MSK FATAL:  could not create lock file \"/var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432.lock\": No such file or directory\n\nI assume the problem is related to postgresql itself not upstart system. I suppose the file it mentions should exist so it can be accessed but it doesn't for some reason. did someone else stumble upon this, or has a potential solution to this?\n\nA: I had the same desire to configure pg this way. For me, I wanted multiple clusters, each with their own independent scheduler (pgagent). When I shut down an individual cluster pgagent will stop automatically, but when I start a cluster I want pgagent to start automatically for that cluster also. If I forget to start the scheduler when I start a cluster, I'm in trouble.\nI had Googled around, but never found a good solution to running PostgreSQL under Upstart. Most of the solutions explicitly started the postmaster instead of using the pg_wrapper commands. With the way Upstart works, this seems dangerous and could result in data loss in rare situations.\nThus, I forged ahead and tried to create my own Upstart scripts that would do the job. I found that it was very difficult to capture the correct PID of both the cluster and its pgagent instance. Eventually however, I realized that with PostgreSQL, you don't actually care about PIDs. You care about versions and clusters. Once I realized that, it all came together, and I created the following three scripts:\nThe first I call pg_versions.conf.\ndescription \"PostgreSQL Version Controller\"\nauthor \"Brian Myers\"\n\nstart on runlevel [2345]\nstop on runlevel [016]\n\nenv DEFAULT_VERSIONS=\"9.3\"\n\npre-start script\n  if [ -z $VERSIONS ]; then\n    VERSIONS=$DEFAULT_VERSIONS\n  fi\n  for version in $VERSIONS \n  do\n    for cluster in $(pg_lsclusters -h | grep $version | cut -d\" \" -f 2) \n    do\n      if [ `tail -1 /etc/postgresql/$version/$cluster/start.conf` = \"auto\" ]; then\n        start pg_cluster version=$version cluster=$cluster\n      fi\n    done\n  done\nend script\n\npost-stop script\n  if [ -z $VERSIONS ]; then\n    VERSIONS=$DEFAULT_VERSIONS\n  fi\n  for version in $VERSIONS \n  do\n    for cluster in $(pg_lsclusters -h | grep $version | cut -d\" \" -f 2) \n    do\n      stop pg_cluster version=$version cluster=$cluster\n    done\n  done\nend script\n\nNext is pg_cluster.conf.\ndescription \"PostgreSQL Cluster Controller\"\nauthor \"Brian Myers\"\n\ninstance $version-$cluster\n\npre-start script\n  if [ `pg_lsclusters -h | grep $version | grep $cluster | cut -d\" \" -f 4` = \"down\" ]; then\n    pg_ctlcluster $version $cluster start || :\n    start pg_agent version=$version cluster=$cluster || :\n  fi\nend script\n\npost-stop script\n  if [ -e \"/var/run/postgresql/pgagent-$version-$cluster.pid\" ]; then\n    stop pg_agent version=$version cluster=$cluster\n  fi\n  if [ `pg_lsclusters -h | grep $version | grep $cluster | cut -d\" \" -f 4` = \"online\" ]; then\n    pg_ctlcluster $version $cluster stop\n  fi\nend script\n\nAnd finally pg_agent.conf.\ndescription \"PgAgent Controller\"\nauthor \"Brian Myers\"\n\ninstance ${version}-${cluster}\n\nsetuid postgres\n\npre-start script\n  PORT=`pg_lsclusters -h | grep $version | grep $cluster | cut -d\" \" -f 3`\n  if [ -z `psql -c \"select schema_name FROM information_schema.schemata WHERE schema_name = 'pgagent';\" -d postgres -p $PORT | grep pgagent` ]; then\n    stop ; exit 0\n  fi\n  PGAGENTDIR=`which pgagent`\n  PGAGENTOPTIONS=\"host=/var/run/postgresql dbname=postgres user=postgres port=$PORT\"\n  start-stop-daemon --start --oknodo --name \"pga$version$cluster\" --exec $PGAGENTDIR -- $PGAGENTOPTIONS\n  pgrep -f \"$PGAGENTDIR.+$PORT\" > /var/run/postgresql/pgagent-$version-$cluster.pid\nend script\n\npost-stop script\n  start-stop-daemon --stop --oknodo --pidfile /var/run/postgresql/pgagent-$version-$cluster.pid\n  if [ -w /var/run/postgresql/pgagent-$version-$cluster.pid ]; then\n    rm -f /var/run/postgresql/pgagent-$version-$cluster.pid\n  fi\nend script\n\nIf you want more than just the 9.3 version, just add the versions to the env DEFAULT_VERSIONS=\"9.3\" line separated by spaces.\nWith these, I can:\nStart all clusters not already running:\nsudo initctl start pg_versions\nStart all clusters for a particular version not already running:\nsudo initctl start pg_versions version=9.3\nStart a particular cluster, auto-starting pgagent for that cluster, but only if the cluster is pgagent enabled:\nsudo initctl start pg_cluster version=9.3 cluster=main\nStart a cluster's pgagent if the cluster is pgagent enabled:\nsudo initctl start pg_agent version=9.3 cluster=main\nChange start to stop to get the inverse behavior. Of course everything starts up on boot and shuts down on stop via pg_ctlcluster, so no data loss. I did have to disable the init.d scripts via bum.\nI'm sure these could be cleaned up or done in even better ways. The pg_agent script for example -- I could never figure out why using script or exec couldn't capture the correct PID. Eventually I gave up and managed the pid file myself, but it's still a mystery. It was probably my very soft shell scripting skills.\nNote also that if you shut down clusters manually with pg_ctlcluster these Upstart jobs will still show as running even though the associated versions/clusters are not. Not a big deal because you can just restart them with either pg_ctlcluster or initctl, but for that reason I suggest using initctl to control your clusters if you deploy these jobs.\nIn any case, these work quite well for me.\n\nA: Error means Postgres cannot create its lock file into /var/run/postgresql directory. The pre-script is expected to create it, and it is setting ownership to postgres. To me, it just looks like this script has not run at all. So check the output of start postgres (as superuser), existence and permissions ls -l /var/run/postgresql.\nFYI: exec is useful in Upstart jobs so the script section running a shell script does not leave an additional PID floating around. In a shell session, it makes your shell quit when executed program exits.\n", "Q: Dual Boot Windows 8 with Ubuntu 12.10 This is my First time so please help\nSteps I Followed :\n\n\n*\n\n*Install windows 8 pro with media center \nOn my asus k55vm, i7 ,8gb.\n\n*Windows boots fine and is in perfect condition.\n\n*Booted into Ubuntu live USB and installed ( it detected windows, installed alongside windows 8 with recommended setting )\n\n*Installed perfectly.

While it might seem a bit tedious the logs can reveal some very interesting information about the machine as it is booting.  For example the kernel log (/var/log/kern.log) gives a blow-by-blow description of what is happened timed down to the closest millisecond.\nIf kern.log doesn't reveal any useful information, try syslog and even authlog.  You are looking for anything unusual such as error messages or something that gets repeated or retried many times.  Most of the logs are time stamped to the millisecond, which can be really useful if you can synchronize real world problems with system time.\nTry running \"log file viewer\" and using that as an assistant.  It helps a bit by putting all available logs in front of you, and giving you the ability to only look at todays logs.\n\nA: Have you ever logged in to a gnome classic session?

Here is the scenario\nI have already downloaded the ubuntu 12.10 desktop 32bit on ubuntu site.\nNow I want to put it in my 4gb flash drive using the universal installer.\nAssuming i have a 100GB hard drive, I want to use \n30GB for Ubuntu.

So explain it detail by detail. The laptop that I will install Ubuntu in is not mine.\nI will use this OS for our thesis project so please advise me.\nI also have 'wubi.exe' but I'm not comfortable using it.\n\nA: The Windows Disk Manager will free the space you want and this space will be completely free, unless you specifically tell it to create a partition. It and Ubuntu will remain happy were they are and will not interfere in Windows.\n30GB is more than enough for Ubuntu (although considering your HD, cut 20GB).\nIf you are nervous about Ubuntu, Wubi works extremely well and with the added facility of \"un-installing\" Ubuntu in case of problems is just what you want. I'd recommend Wubi.\nThere is excellent documentation on installing Ubuntu AND Wubi is user-friendly for newbies. Go for Wubi and you don't need to cut anything at all.\nThis guide will be all you might need as it covers all general issues : \nGuide to Wubi. \nAnd Welcome to Ubuntu!

There is no need to mount-unmount. You can easily uninstall Ubuntu from windows control panel. Windows and Ubuntu start from Windows boot-loader.\nBut wubi is slightly slower because of the NTFS file system.\nI have compared 12.04 wubi and 12.04 stand-alone on same type of netbook Asus eee PC r051bx (with AMD C-60 APU and 1GB of RAM).

Also look out for a trailing space after '.'\n\nA: From the terminal... First, let's test before trying. Create a similar file with this command:\ntouch \\(\\)\n\nThen to remove that file:\nrm \\(\\)\n\nThe \\ symbol is used for special characters.\nIn your case, as long as the file is the only file that starts with (), you should use this command\nrm -i \\(\\)*\n\nThe -i makes it interactive (asks your permission).\n\nA: What I usually do in cases like that is to use tab-completion to make sure everything gets escaped properly.   The steps would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*open a terminal and navigate to the folder with the bad filename in it\n\n*type \"rm \\ \"  (a backslash followed by one space) \n\n*hit tab\n\n*that should expand the filename with the necessary escapes\n\n\nThis is assuming that's the only filename you have that starts with a space - if there's more than one, you might need to manually type and escape the first couple of characters so it can distinguish which one you mean.\n\nA: An alternate solution (even though properly using rm may be preferable) is to use midnight commander, e.g.\n$ sudo apt-get install mc\n$ mc\n\nThen,\n\n\n*\n\n*move to the directory containing the file (use up/down arrows to select directories and enter to cd to them),\n\n*select the file you want to delete (CTRL-T)\n\n*delete the file (F8)\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 10.04.4 is asking for username and password during the instalation.

If the system is powered down or not is a kind of random. However, whenever I use the Terminal to sudo shutdown -h now it will switch off the machine reliably. After having read this answer, I wonder what command Unity issues to initiate the shutdown (and power off) of the system? \n\nA: Ubuntu's session indicator relies on dbus calls, for example the equivalent command in terminal would be this:\nqdbus com.canonical.Unity /com/canonical/Unity/Session com.canonical.Unity.Session.Shutdown\n\nAs for whether or not some of the machines don't shutdown, I would assume either a bug or dbus calls are being blocked by something\n", "Q: help with using the Unity Web API for my website I'm trying to follow this tutorial, but when clicking on the 'executing this now' on that site nothing happens, i have put up this code here  press (CTRL+U) to see the code and that doesn't work either.\nFacebook, Youtube and others websites work, so why doesn't that tutorial work?\n\nA: The code seems to work fine in Firefox.

My win 7recovery partition is around 20GB, since I have created recovery disks I am assuming I no longer need it my windows partition is only small I was thinking to delete the recovery and add an extra 20GB to my Win. Is my thinking sensible there?. The recovery partition shows as the 1st partition on my hard disc. I'm a bit concerned that by moving the starting position of my Win partition to the start of the hard disc I will make win 7 'lost' and unable to boot. I am fairly new to ubuntu and haven't used a dual boot machine before.

Any ideas, in n00b language?\n\nA: I removed the Recovery Partition from my Dual Boot laptop, but I haven't tried to use the recovery disks yet, so I don't know what they do in terms of MBR and existing partitions. However I can say that deleting the partition hasn't affected my Windows or Ubuntu install. \nI recommend using a tool like \nhttp://redobackup.org/\nto make a full, \"bare-metal\" backup of your disks partitions. Then you shouldn't have to mess with Windows recovery disks. You can also use Redo to run Gparted and delete/resize partitions.\n\nA: The ability to boot up an OS depends on the bootloader knowing the start position on the disk on the partition, so moving your Windows partition (or any other with an OS on it) will require you to repair your bootloader.\nYou'll need to repair both the Windows bootloader and Grub. You may see an entry for Window s in your Grub menu, but it's simply forwarding to the Windows loader.

I did a lot of digging, running in circles, and guesswork before I found a solution.\nThe problem here is that the parameters used to define the scrollbar images to GTK are wrong - specifically, the border values given total up to a larger space than the image's dimensions (as the warnings state).\nSolution\nTo fix this, you'll need to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open /usr/share/themes/Lubuntu-default/gtk-2.0/scrollbar.rc with elevated permissions (e.g. sudo emacs).\n\n*The first two Image definitions (containing null.png) will have a border argument defined. Change both of these to have values of {1, 1, 1, 1}.\n\n*The next few Image definitions are for the scrollbar itself, in its normal and prelit states.\n\n*\n\n*For the horizontal scrollbars, change the border to {6, 6, 4, 4}.\n\n*For the vertical scrollbars, change the border to {4, 4, 6, 6}.\n\n\n\nTechnical Reasoning\nI came across this tutorial on GTK2's pixmap engine which explained to me what the various arguments given in the pixmap's gtkrc arguments meant. What the border argument seems to do is define how many pixels of the image should be preserved from the respective edge of the image before the rest of them are stretched to fit the widget (though an image with larger borders than the widget containing it will be squashed anyway; making the vertical scrollbar 12px big resulted in a squashed scrollbar).\nThe order of the numbers are {left, right, top, bottom}. null.png is a 2x2 image, so to make the borders fit within the image, each side should be 1 pixel. A left of 1 + a right of 1 = 2. Same for the top and bottom. The vertical scrollbar image is an 8x18 image. The given border dimensions of {6, 6, 6, 6} total a width larger than 8 pixels. For the horizontal scrollbar (which is 18x8), that's a height greater than 8 pixels.\nIn short, a border argument where the sum of the left and right or top and bottom border values are greater than the dimensions of the image will cause that warning.\n\nA: This bug report says it is an issue with the theme, not the specific program running: https://bugs.launchpad.net/qbittorrent/+bug/789905\nThis page says the solution is to run sudo apt-get install lubuntu-.:\nhttp://www.richelbilderbeek.nl/CppMiscErrorInvalidBordersSpecifiedForThemePixmap.htm\nI ran this solution and the problem went away (I was experiencing the problem when running smplayer [from the ppa] from the command line), but it seems like a bit of an overkill.

There is a nice tutorial for that on https://wiki.freebsd.org/SecureSSMTP\nHere is an excerpt from it, step 4,5,6,8,9 is what you're looking for (the paths may differ according to your linux distribution, I've customized it for Debian now):\n[Step 4] Create an ssmtp user:\nsudo useradd -g nogroup -M -s /bin/false -c \"sSMTP pseudo-user\" ssmtp\n\nThis will stick the ssmtp user in the nogroup group, disallowing password-based logins (-h).\n[Step 5] Set the correct owner and permissions on the sSMTP configuration directory. We set the setuid bit (see chmod(1) to make sure new files in the directory will be owned by the user ssmtp as well:\ncd /etc/ssmtp\nchown ssmtp:wheel .\nchmod 4750 .\n\n[Step 6] Create the sSMTP configuration file with the correct permissions:\nsudo cp ssmtp.conf.sample ssmtp.conf\nsudo chown ssmtp:wheel . ssmtp.conf\nsudo chmod 640 ssmtp.conf\n\n[Step 8] Make the ssmtp executable owned by the ssmtp user and mark it SUID:\nchown ssmtp:nogroup /usr/sbin/ssmtp\nchmod 4555 /usr/sbin/ssmtp\n\n[Step 9] Run some tests as an unprivileged user:\n$ cat /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf\ncat: /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf: Permission denied\n$ sendmail john@example.com < /etc/rc.conf\n\n\nA: Try invoking ssmtp as a regular user instead and specifying a custom configuration file location.\nFrom the manpage of ssmtp(8):\n-Cfile Use alternate configuration file.\n\nPut your configuration file in a safe place in your home directory without read permission for others. Then run ssmtp like this:\nuser@host:~$ ssmtp -C/path/to/somesecuredir/ssmtp.conf [options]\n\n", "Q: Help with xbox gamepad and Wine I installed my xbox gamepad with \"xboxdrv_0.8.2-1_amd64.deb\" and the controller works just fine with Linux games such as Open Arena. The difficulty I am haveing is when I play DOOM64 EX in Wine, my gamepad is not detected. DOOM 64 EX detects my gamepad in Windows, so its not my version of DOOM. I hope some one could point me in the right direction to get this to work. \n\nA: I don't know what Doom 64 Ex is doing, but a general problem withe Xbox360 gamepads and Windows is that there are two APIs for input in Window, Xinput and DirectInput. Wine only emulates the later, older API, and doesn't handle Xinput at all. Some modern games however require Xinput.\nThere is a workaround via a Xbox360 controller emulation DLL (the same you would use to make an old pre-Xinput gamepad work with modern games in Windows).

In the process, my laptop, which is a W520 in a dock, connected to 2 external monitors (the same monitors.. Dell U2400). I finally got the nvidia-experimental-310 driver working with both monitors. Everything was glorious for a few weeks, and then the thing decided to upgrade the kernel and I didn't realize it did that when I asked it to do the apt-get upgrade. \nAfter realizing my mistake, I went back and tried reinstalling the nvidia driver, since I assumed it needed to be built against the current kernel again. I couldn't get either the nvidia-current or nvidia-experimental-310 drivers working (they booted into a black screen with a flashing cursor, or, in the case of the 310 driver, wouldn't let me enable my second screen). \nI was able to get the nvidia-experimental-304 driver working, though. So, after some trial and error, I updated my xorg.conf file and rebooted. Now, however, I get the following error in my Xorg.0.log file:\n[    16.023] (EE) Failed to load module \"nvidia-experimental-304\" (module does not exist, 0)\n\nBut, when I go to a virtual terminal, and run the following:\n# modprobe nvidia-experimental-304\n# /etc/init.d/lightdm restart\n\nEverything now works as expected, except that the following still shows up in my Xorg.0.log file, even when X starts as I would expect it to:\n[    16.023] (EE) Failed to load module \"nvidia-experimental-304\" (module does not exist, 0)\n\nCan anyone tell me what I'm doing incorrectly? I'd like to get the module to automatically load on startup, so I can boot into X directly, without having to manually modprobe the module.\nMy xorg.conf file follows.\nEdit\nIf I change the Driver \"nvidia-experimental-304\" to \"nvidia\" in my xorg.conf file, the system runs in low-graphics mode on reboot, with the following errors in the xorg.conf file:\n[    17.147] (**) NVIDIA(0): Enabling 2D acceleration\n[    17.163] (EE) NVIDIA(0): Failed to initialize the NVIDIA kernel module.

It's really bothersome to have to change the path every time I run this program on the other OS.\n\nA: It's not possible to get Ubuntu to understand Windows File Paths. You can however install Wine and run the program in Wine to get Windows File Paths.

Can I simply install Ubuntu to a free partition and it will automatically ask me each time I reboot which OS I would like to use?  \n\nA: Update for Ubuntu 18.04 and above\nNew installations of recent versions of Ubuntu does not use a separate swap partition any more. They use a swap file by default.\nOriginal Answer\nUbuntu by default uses two partitions, one of type ext4 and the other of type Swap. Windows uses NTFS partitions not useful for Ubuntu installation.\nIf you have a free partition in Windows, delete it using Windows Disk Management Tool. Keep the free space unallocated.\nWhen you install Ubuntu, choose the Install side by side Windows option. Ubuntu will find the unallocated space and create the partitions it needs.\nSee Ubuntu installation on Windows7 with D partition for more details.\nThe default installation of Ubuntu includes a boot-loader called GRUB. Every time you boot GRUB will load before Windows or Ubuntu and give you the choice to boot either Ubuntu or Windows. If you do not choose anything, it will boot Ubuntu after waiting for a while. Both the time it waits and the default boot can be changed later.\nHope this helps\n", "Q: Assign sounds to system events like Windows Can sound files be assigned to system events in Ubuntu 12.04?

This won't work. You need to exit the Python interpreter (with Ctrl-D) and execute your file from the shell prompt. The actual command will be the same:\npython tutorial1.py\n\n(provided that your current directory contains tutorial1.py file)\nIf you need cvxopt module installed in Python, you can do that with\nsudo apt-get install python-cvxopt\n\nYou don't need to use build-dep command.

I've installed Ubuntu 12.10 a few days ago and I have only been able to get up to one hour of battery life. When running Windows 7 I get up to 3-4 hours.\nMy screen is ultra bright, even though the screen brightness is set to the minimum (I installed xcalib to dim my screen, but it doesn't improve the battery life)\nI read about Jupiter and installed it, but it doesn't have a noticeable effect.\n\nA: Quick disclaimer, Linux tends to use more power then windows because it does \"more stuff\" and uses the hardware different. You may not be able to get the same amount of time in Linux as you did in windows, or you may get more.\nThese are listed in the order of importance to me. That is the easiest to do with the most gain first.\nCPU Frequency\nThe largest impact on my battery is CPU frequency. When I am plugged in I want full speed, but when I unplug I want as much battery as I can muster. This is mostly automatic, these days, however to give it a bit of a hand, and to let me see it, I installed jupiter. This auto does stuff when on battery and when on power. It also gives me some direct control over some power management features.\nDisplay Brightness\nJust turn it down as far as you can. This made a large difference to me. If you want to do this via a script then echo -n 100 > /proc/acpi/video/VGA/LCD/brightness should would with a little adjustment. The path will likely be different depending on build/kernel/hardware.\nKeyboard backlight\nOn My Mac Book Pro, this has only a little gain, but turning off the keyboard backlight is super easy.\nIdle Time and Screen Blanking\nTurn them way down. From \"Power\" in unity, set suspend when inactive to 5 minutes, and when the lid is closed suspend. There is a link in the Tip at the bottom of the window. Click it and make sure that Dim Screen to save power is checked. Turn screen off after 2 Minutes. \nTurn Off Bluetooth\nAgain an easy one that doesn't save a lot. From Jupiter indicator, disable Bluetooth when on battery.  \nnoatime\nEdit /etc/fstab and add noatime to all local partitions and mount points. This \"should\" prevent your drive from spinning up as frequently. Read up on it first. This doesn't give the benefit it once did, but it keeps my drive from spooling.\nDo less stuff\nThis one is kinda tricky, but can give you a ton of savings. Basically Linux does a ton of stuff in the background. This is one of the best things about it. However it can also lead to higher then needed power usage. The easiest thing to do here is disable cron on battery but turn it back on when on power. This can be dangerous if you don't know what you doing. Basically it shouldn't hurt anything if you miss a few cron jobs, but leaving it off all the time will cause problems. \nAlso take a look at/keep an eye on htop. Reconsider the apps that are using a large amount of CPU.  \nNvidia\nI have no idea if this actually does anything so I put it last.

Try running the following in a terminal on the PC.\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure resolvconf\n\nThen reboot the PC.\nIf you still can't ping www.google.com but can ping a valid IP address on the Internet then you probably need to adjust the DNS configuration. If you are using ifup and /etc/network/interfaces then you need to add \"dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8\" to the \"iface eth0\" stanza in /etc/network/interfaces, where you can use 8.8.8.8 or some other working nameserver's address. If you are, instead, using NetworkManager then you should use the Connection Editor to enable the acquisition of nameserver addresses via DHCP (Set IPv4 Settings | Method to \"Automatic (DHCP)\" and not to \"Automatic (DHCP) addresses only\") or to set static nameserver addresses for the Wired Connection.\n", "Q: Cannot connect to the internet after installing Cisco AnyConnect VPN Client Today, I tried to install the Cisco AnyConnect VPN Client on my computer running Ubuntu 12.04 updatet earlier today.

If this is not the case then run\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure resolvconf\n\n\nA: I had the same problem. With Ubuntu 12.10 I had installed Cisco AnyConnect, then found that I had lost my internet connection. I uninstalled AnyConnect, then saw that I was still having DNS problems, which prevented me from accessing anything on the Internet. Based on jdthood's answer, I looked at the file /etc/resolv.conf and saw this:\n# Dynamic resolv.conf(5) file for glibc resolver(3) generated by resolvconf(8)\n# DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE BY HAND -- YOUR CHANGES WILL BE OVERWRITTEN\nnameserver 127.0.0.1\n\n127 is a localhost or something, so that didn't look right. I commented out the last line and added this:\nnameserver 8.8.8.8\n\n8.8.8.8 is the ip address of Google's DNS server. That solved the problem instantly. I'm not sure it's a permanent fix (judging by the all-caps warning not to do what I did), but it holds after rebooting, and my internet works again. \n\nA: My case:\nUbutu 14.04, installed vpn by \nsudo apt-get install network-manager-openconnect-gnome\n\nthen change the /run/resolvconf/resolv.conf to \nnameserver 8.8.8.8\n\nNow I can connect to internet with CISCO vpn.\nthe problem is once you disconnect VPN and reconnect VPN, the nameserver is written back to 127.0.0.1.

I built up a Xen Server using Ubuntu 12.04 as the base operating system.  It has multiple domUs running on it.  My home network has a statically defined network where I got all the network connectivity going peachy.  The server was moved to a permanent home this morning.  So, the network configuration on the main system had to change.  Again, another static network, but now I can't ping the upstream gateway from the host.  As the VMs use this NIC over a bridge, they too are broken.  Ping responds with \"destination host unreachable.\"  I simplified the networking down to a simple static network as seen below (no bridge or anything) just to get it to work.  \nHere's the contents of my /etc/network/interfaces file:\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\n    address 216.7.188.228\n    gateway 216.7.188.225\n    netmask 255.255.255.240\n    broadcast 216.7.188.255\n    network 216.7.188.0\n    dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4\n\nHere's the contents of route -n\n0.0.0.0          216.7.188.225  0.0.0.0          UG  100  0  0  eth0\n216.7.188.224    0.0.0.0        255.255.255.240  U   0    0  0  eth0\n\nAnd the results of pinging the gateway:\nPING 216.7.188.225 (216.7.188.225) 56(84) bytes of data.\nFrom 216.7.188.228 icmp_seq=1 Destination Host Unreachable\nFrom 216.7.188.228 icmp_seq=1 Destination Host Unreachable\nFrom 216.7.188.228 icmp_seq=1 Destination Host Unreachable\n\nAgain, this worked in one network flawlessly (obviously with different parameters in the interfaces file). I did try using eth1 (as there are two NICS on the server (in case the MAC address got flipped on bootup).  No success there.  Yes, the cable is in the right port now :)\nAny thoughts?  \nI appreciate the help!\nFurther investigation resulted in finding out the following characteristics.  Grub gives you two main boot options after xen is installed.  One for the vanilla kernel without Xen, and one with Xen.  The default is to use the Xen boot configuration.  If I use the vanilla kernel option, with no Xen, networking is just fine.  If I use the Xen option, networking breaks.  I compared the routing tables for the two setups with \"route -n\" and they are identical.  The /etc/network/interfaces file hasn't changed.  So, it must be something to do with the way the bridge is setup, or Xen performs it's network initialization.  This is diving into an area I'm unfamiliar with.  Can anyone give me an idea how to proceed solving this problem?  Otherwise, I have to bail on Xen (which I don't want to do) and try VirtualBox instead.   This is horribly frustrating.\n\nA: Your broadcast, network, and netmask do not agree.  Using the netmask you specified, the broadcast and network addresses are not on the same subnet as the IP address and gateway you specified.  You probably are using the wrong netmask, and it should be 255.255.255.0 rather than .240.\n", "Q: How can I easily type full width alphanumeric Unicode characters?

Details as to how to turn my pc on and hit F8 or whatever can be discarted lmao :)\nTy in advance.\n\nA: First let's find out where your USB is in using the fdisk command:\nsudo fdisk -l \n\nand you'll see a list of partitions in your computer.\nsysfs on /sys type sysfs (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev)\n/dev/sda1            2048    15624191     7811072   82  Linux swap / Solaris\n/dev/sda2   *    15624192    64452607    24414208   83  Linux\n/dev/sdb1         1214121     3244232    42323242   84  vfat   \n\nnow you'll know that your usb is at /dev/sdb and /dev/sdb1 is the only 'partition' on it, if not per se a partition. \nNow you have to do a block-by-block copy of the .iso file that you have to boot from to the disk. dd command is the one to use.\ndd if=/path/to/iso.iso of=/dev/sdb\n\nNotice that I'm using sdb here, not sdb1 or any other partition.\nNow you'll be able to boot from the usb when you restart your computer. Just select to boot from the USB disk.\n\nA: If the .iso is a \"hybrid mode\" image (like most Ubuntu and Debian images these days, have no idea about Arch), then you can just write it directly to the USB just as if it was a CD-ROM drive.  For instance, using dd.\ndd if=imagefile.iso of=/dev/sdc oflag=direct bs=1048576\n\nIf the .iso is not a hybrid mode image, then you can use UNetBootin, available from Ubuntu's repositories, which is an easy way to burn an ISO (for a Linux distro) to a USB key, converting its filesystem to be compatible.  Note: UNetBootin is a GUI app.\n", "Q: How can I get Involved in the Ubuntu (Mobile) Dev Team? Like the title states, how can I join the Ubuntu Mobile development team? I'm not too experienced but I'd like to help out as I enjoy prototyping hardware with Ubuntu.\n\nA: You can find the Ubuntu Phone team here on Launchpad. The best way to get involved with them is to join the Launchpad team, sign up for the mailing list, and introduce yourself. Tell them your experiences with both Ubuntu and software development, what sort of things you'd be interested in doing, and they'll point you in the right direction.\nIf there's no response straight away, don't be afraid to poke them a little ;)\n", "Q: Openmpi 1.6.3 on ubuntu 12.10 I manually installed the tar.gz of openmpi 1.6.3 on Ubuntu 12.10.

It was running fine if I install openmpi using apt-get install. But that way I will get only version 1.6.1. Thanks.\n\nA: Yes, already posted in the comments as a verified solution, but posting as an answer anyway.\nIf the version 1.6.1 from the Ubuntu repositories in 12.10 is not sufficient, you could try installing the 1.6.3 version from Raring (unreleased 13.04 development branch) here:\n\n\n*\n\n*openmpi1.6-bin\n\n*libopenmpi1.6\n\n*openmpi1.6-common\nDownload the right .debs according to your architechture and install them like\nsudo dpkg -i openmpi1.6-bin_1.6.3-3_amd64.deb libopenmpi1....\n\nA quick look at the dependencies shows this should work in the 12.10 release as well.

If that's the case, how do I do it?\n\nA: patching your kernel\nAccording to this post your particular bluetooth module is not recognised by the current precise kernel.\nYou command usb-devices reveals the particular bluetooth device - the vendor and ProdID values - 0b05:17b5\nA patch was submitted to the main Git repository.  It is likely (but not certain) that this patch would be included in the next kernel - v3.8.  However, it could be a later module if this goes though staging.\nThus, for the moment, to get you bluetooth device to be recognised, you should file a bug-report on launchpad asking if it is possible to backport this patch - give as much detail as possible to the patch and if possible submit the patch as well.\nIf you want to patch this yourself, here are some notes you can follow.\npatching your kernel\n\n*\n\n*download the build environment, kernel source & headers\n\n\nsudo apt-get install build-essential \napt-get source linux-source-3.2.0\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)\n\ni.e. DO NOT use sudo apt-get source linux-source-3.2.0 since this will download the source as root - this will cause compilation issues later if you download as root.\n\n*\n\n*copy the current kernel config and source headers Module Versions file\n\n\ncd linux-3.2.0\ncp /boot/config-$(uname -r) .config\ncp /usr/src/linux-headers-$(uname -r)/Module.symvers . \n\n\n*\n\n*patch the bluetooth module\n\nThe linux above indicated the patch should be applied to btusb.c\nUsing your favourite editor open this kernel module\n\ngedit drivers/bluetooth/btusb.c\n\nSearch & find the line containing the text BCM20702A0\nIt will look like:\n\n/* Broadcom BCM20702A0 */\n{ USB_DEVICE(0x0489, 0xe042) },\n{ USB_DEVICE(0x13d3, 0x3388), .driver_info = BTUSB_BCM_PATCHRAM },\n{ USB_DEVICE(0x13d3, 0x3389), .driver_info = BTUSB_BCM_PATCHRAM },\n{ USB_DEVICE(0x413c, 0x8197), .driver_info = BTUSB_BCM_PATCHRAM },\n\n\nAdd the following your new bluetooth device - that is your vendor and ProdID { USB_DEVICE(0x0b05, 0x17b5) }, i.e.\n\n/* Broadcom BCM20702A0 */\n{ USB_DEVICE(0x0b05, 0x17b5) },\n{ USB_DEVICE(0x0489, 0xe042) },\n{ USB_DEVICE(0x13d3, 0x3388), .driver_info = BTUSB_BCM_PATCHRAM },\n{ USB_DEVICE(0x13d3, 0x3389), .driver_info = BTUSB_BCM_PATCHRAM },\n{ USB_DEVICE(0x413c, 0x8197), .driver_info = BTUSB_BCM_PATCHRAM },\n\n\n*\n\n*Now compile\n\n\nmake M=drivers/bluetooth modules\n\n\n*\n\n*This should successfully compile the kernel modules including your newly patched file.\n\n\n*Finally add the kernel module to your current kernel drivers folder:\n\ncd drivers/bluetooth\nsudo cp btusb.ko /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/drivers/bluetooth\nsudo service bluetooth stop\nsudo modprobe -r btusb\nsudo modprobe btusb\nsudo service bluetooth start\n\nHopefully now your bluetooth device is recognised - it should be visible when you run rfkill list all as well as lsusb\nand finally...\nEach time your kernel is updated by Canonical you will need to re-run through the above procedure because your new bluetooth module will be overwritten - if you are luck you may be able to use run the sudo modprobe commands with minor kernel updates.\n\nA: I have the same problem with BCM20702A0 on my Acer Aspire R7 and just found another permanent solution (without recompiling the driver on updates):\nsudo echo btusb >> /etc/modules - this will force loading btusb driver;\nadd the line echo 0b05 17b5 > /sys/bus/usb/drivers/btusb/new_id to the /etc/rc.local just before exit 0 - this will force driver to be used with the specified device on boot (which is 04ca 2004 in my system, and also works).\n\nA: Refer to WifiDocs/Driver/bcm43xx in the Ubuntu wiki for info on how to install the correct drivers for your chipset.\n", "Q: USB security dongle doesn't get recognised in Ubuntu 12.04 I have an accounting software that runs on Windows and (as per the advice of the user support) Ubuntu.

I wanted to know if it is possible to update Ubuntu from my the Windows side of my computer (I dual boot). The Ubuntu side is a WUBI install. The reason is I accidentally deleted the wireless driver for my Broadcom wireless card thinking I was replacing it. As I had no ethernet driver installed, I currently have no access to the internet from my Ubuntu side. I am relatively new to Linux so please don't be too hard on me haha. I just really want to upgrade to 12.10 so, hopefully, this problem can be resolved in the update. Thank you for your help in advance.\n\nA: If you deleted the driver by uninstalling a package, and you know the name of the package, you can download and install the .deb file manually. Just go to  http://packages.ubuntu.com/, enter the name of the package and the distribution (\"precise\" in your case). The actual .deb file can be downloaded after you click on the name of the package in the search results, the scroll to the bottom and select architecture, and then select a mirror to download from - the interface is a bit confusing but its doable.\nThen move the .deb file to your Ubuntu and install it using\nsudo dpkg -i package_name.deb\n\nif you deleted the driver by physically deleting some files, and you remember the names of the files, you can find which packages contain those files using \"Search the contents of packages\" form on that page.\nAdditionally, the package you need may already be in the /var/cache/apt/archives so you don't even need to download it.\n\nA: YES and NO.\nThere is no really simple way to find the right driver, download it (using windows), and then install it on your WUBI install.\nIt can be done, but someone would need to step you through each step ..\n\nA simpler solution would be for you to use Windows to download the 12.10 ISO file, copy it to your WUBI install, and then create a boot USB (or DVD) using WUBI.\nThen install 12.10 alongside Windows. This would still leave your WUBI install, which could be removed later.\n\nA: I think it would be better if you install 12.10 from scratch. To backup your current files you can access your wubi installation from an Ubuntu Live CD. \n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into the OS press Ctrl + Alt + T to open a terminal. \n\n*Your windows drive should be mounted already, you can find it in /media. This command will mount the wubi virtual disk into /mnt. Change win with the name of your Windows drive.\nsudo mount -o loop /media/win/ubuntu/disks/root.disk /mnt \n\n*Open Nautilus, press Ctrl + L to show the path bar and type \"/mnt\" to see your files. \n\n*Now you can start copy/pasting into your Windows drive so you can restore it later. Most of your stuff would probably be under home.\n\n*Uninstall old wubi from Windows and install new one.\n\n", "Q: Is there any way to create a LXDE customized panel as a launcher? I am currently using (and enjoying) Lubuntu 12.10 on an older desktop, since the last time I tested it, it has improved a lot, but I really got used to Unity workflow and it has become quite an habit to manage applications and windows with the launcher. \nUsing Synapse as an attempt to replace dash, I already created a panel on the left margin of the desktop with the shortcuts to my favorite programs, but they only open the apps, the window management is still made on the bottom panel. I tried to use this default bottom panel on the left but the results were not satisfatory. Besides, some applications still make use of tray icons on the bottom panel, like Dropbox.\nI dont really mind if I have to keep using the tray icons, I can just autohide the panel and reveal it when I need it, my main concern is to manage opened windows on the left customized panel instead of the default one.\nHere it is a screenshot to help me clarify what I am trying to do.\nhttp://imm.io/NUqT\n\nA: I would suggest running Cairo because it had the most configurations available.

I am taking a wild shot here: I am a type 1 diabetic who is going on the Insulin pump.  Unfortunately, the Medtronic Carelink USB device that uploads data from the pump online only has windows drivers.  Has anybody managed to get this working under Ubuntu using Wine or by any other method?\nlsusb yields:\nBus 001 Device 014: ID 0a21:8001 Medtronic Physio Control Corp. MMT-7305WW [Medtronic Minimed CareLink]\n\nI really don't want to buy a Windows machine just for this, but it's probably one in a million that somebody else has managed to make this work under Linux.\n\nA: You will not be able to run any windows driver via wine. There is a slim chance that the device is actually compatible with something else. For example I have many factory equipment which can be connected to as if it is a modem, via minicom. \nHowever, finding this out is tricky and can be answered only by the guy who knows how this medical things are built. \nYou can install Windows as an application via VirtualBox. However, if you are licencse-aware, microsoft prohibits it. \n\nA: It is  possible to log in to the website if you spoof your headers.\n\n\n*\n\n*To do this you install a plugin like Modify Headers 0.7.1.1 \n\n*Click Preferences  \n\n*Select Headers -> Modify\nHeadername: user-agent\nHeadervalue: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 10.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/6.0)  \n\n*Start the plugin\n\n\nNow you can log in to the site from Ubuntu to generate reports and stuff.\n\nA: With the lsusb output above, you can use linux software, written in python or node, to talk fetch logs from your pump.\nYou didn't specify exactly what you are trying to do, but if you want to fetch information from the pump and save it in, eg a json file, you can use the mm-latest.py script to do that in Ubuntu.\nTo create a serial device, insert.sh from the decoding-carelink package Which runs:\n#Bus 002 Device 011: ID 0a21:8001 Medtronic Physio Control Corp. \nsudo modprobe --first-time usbserial vendor=0x0a21 product=0x8001\n\nNow any linux tool of your choice can talk to the pump, so long as it knows how to use the pump's protocol.\nThere is some software available to do this:\nopenaps\nThere's a tool called openaps.\nThis provides a number of commands, replete with tab-completion.\nInstalling:\n# install openaps from pypi\nsudo easy_install -ZU openaps\n\nNow we can create a new instance of openaps, and begin using the devices we'll configure:\nopenaps init my.openaps # creates new subdirectory/git repo called my.openaps\nopenaps device add pump medtronic AABBCC # where AABBCC is your serial number\nopenaps use pump read_clock # to read current clock\nopenaps use pump iter_pump 100 # for last 100 pump records\nopenaps use pump -h # for menu of all commands\n\nThe system will also aide in storing the results to files tracked by the git repo.\ndecoding-carelink\nUnder the hood openaps is using decoding-carelink to talk to the pump.\nThis is like a curl and libcurl for medtronic pumps, it exposes a python library for getting data from the pumps, as well as some useful commandline tools to do common tasks, such as retrieving logs from specified time period.  There are also some udev rules provided to help create the serial device automatically..\n\ncomlink2-uart\n\n\n*\n\n*in node js, comlink2-uart provides javascript bindings for similar purposes\n\n\nOnce you get the data, you can use your favorite visualization program to share or visualize the data.\nSo the alternatives to windows and carelink software are the these two projects, which liberates your data on your own terms.\n\nA: My girlfriend she has the carelink usb too.

I am a new user on ubuntu. My project is to modify an application source code on ubuntu. I had already download an application source code which is using C++. Firstly i need to check whether the original source code can run successfully, how to run it on ubuntu?\n\nA: Before you try any of the following methods check README or INSTALL file it would be carrying whole info on installation.\nI'll give you some common installation methods.\nMake sure to do all the following things as root otherwise it may cause such \"Permission Denied\" errors. \nAn easy way to do everything as root : At the beginning write sudo bash. It would open a bash as root it reduces lots of efforts writing sudo every time.\nFirst extract the source code with \ntar -xvzf something.tar.gz\n\n\n1)With make file.\nWhat ever your app is if it can be installed it should have a Make file in it. If there is a file named MAKE your app source work is now easy as pie. \nJust lead the terminal to the source code folder cd /path/to/source/ (use tab key instead of writing whole path) and then write make \nIt may ask you to configure and if it ask so it would also give instructions how to do so. Configurations are dependent on app so I can't help on it without the app name.\nIf it doesn't ask to config, it'll be easier now just write make install and you're done.\nThere might be some errors like some packges requires so just install packges using apt.\ni.e. apt-get install packgename\n\n2)Without MAKE file.\nIn case the first method goes wrong with error i.e \"Make file not found\" this may work.\nCheck if there is a bin folder in the source, lead the terminal to the bin folder.\nRun a proper executable you think is the main executable of the app using ./appname in this case the app is portable and you can use it without installation.\nProbably this method never works in case you have the zero compiled source code.\nOr there may be such APPNAME.sh anything like install.sh run it with sh something.sh and if it runs without errors it's all yours.\n\nHowever you can always install well known apps using apt.\n\nA: Please follow the package approach.\n\n\n*\n\n*Set some essential build environment settings (you can make these up unless you are publishing these packages).\n$ export DEBEMAIL=yourname@example.com\n$ export DEBFULLNAME=\"Your Name Here\"\n\n\n*Install the build dependencies.\n$ sudo apt-get build-dep package\n\n\n*Download the source package.\n$ apt-get source package\n\n\n*cd into it.\n$ cd package-1.2.3\n\n\n*Do any changes to the source if you like.\n\n*Increment the version in the changelog.\n$ dch -i\n\n\n*Build the package in the simplest form (unsigned).\n$ debuild -uc -us\n\n\n*Install the new package you can find one directory level lower.\n$ sudo dpkg -i package-1.2.3-somemore.deb\n\nRepeat steps 5, 7 and 8 to test your changes to the source until you're satisfied.\nPlease, really do not mess up your system with make install commands. This will overwrite files managed by your package management. Only run those command if you know what you are doing.

The terminal stuff is new to me, I'd appreciate any suggestions.\nObs.: I have looked at some forums/posts on the wireless issue, however none have resolved mine.\nHope you guys can help me. Thanks.\n\nA: Ubuntu normally allow you to easily connect to wireless networks by just clicking the name of the network you'd like to use, but most wifi cards need a proprietary driver to work. So check on the top bar if you have a notification to install additional drivers or go to the \"System Settings\" > \"Additional Drivers\" to see if you need to install a proprietary driver for your wifi card.\nIf new drivers have to be downloaded, you'll need a wired connection to the internet before being able to use your wireless connection.\nIf no drivers is needed you will be able to see a wireless icon on you top bar of your desktop, so just click on it to see the available wifi networks around you, if you can't see your network, click on \"More networks\" and if your network is hidden, click on \"Connect to Hidden Wireless Network...\" and give the information it will ask you.\nThis answer is an adapted transcription of the following YouTube video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJvB97cmrWk\n\nA: I found when putting Ubuntu on my laptop it automatically shut off my wireless so if you have a quick button for that try pressing it. Second if you haven't tried it go to System Settings > Network > Wireless  and make sure it's turned on. It should just take some online searching if that doesn't work. Make sure you've run the updates. \nJust from a little search from the answers try\nsudo iwconfig\n\nThat will tell you the status of your wired and wireless connections.\nI also found this http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2035902&page=3\nIt's solved. Just make sure it applies to you and that you understand what each step is doing.\n", "Q: MySQL port forwarding I am trying to help a colleague to connect to my MySQL server. However the situation is a bit special, and here's why (let's call him person A and me, person B):\nPerson A has a PC, on which he has a virtual machine, which is in the same network as the actual PC he's running. However person A is also in the same network with person B (a different network).\nI want the site that lives on A's VM to be able to connect to the MySQL server on B's PC. For this I've thought a port forwarding would be appropriate: from ip-of-person-A:3306 to ip-of-person-B:3306. This way the site would connect to the IP of the PC it's living on (not the VM), which would forward to A's MySQL.\nI've seen several examples of port forwarding, but I don't think it's what I need, from what I've seen, it's kind of the opposite. So would something like this be achievable?\n\nA: Person A can use port-forwarding with iptables on his machine, it will allow connections made to his machine 10.0.0.1 to be forwarded to PersonBs machine 172.16.0.1\necho \"1\" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward    \n\npersonB=172.16.0.1\npersonA=10.0.0.1\npersonA_VM=10.0.0.2\npersonA_2=172.16.0.2\nmysql=3306 # port\n\n### Make all packets from VM to mysql go to Person B\niptables -t nat -I PREROUTING -p tcp --dport $mysql \\ \n   -s $personA_VM/32  -d $personA  -j DNAT --to $personB:$mysql\n\n### Make all packets local to PersonBs network.\niptables -t nat -I POSTROUTING -p tcp --dport $mysql \\\n   -s $personA_VM/32 -d $personB/32  -j MASQUERADE\n\nBut as I say in the comments a better solution is to add the VM to both networks\n", "Q: How can I close Multiple Pdfs at the same time I have lots of pdf opened(40-50). I want to close all pdfs at the same time, not one by one.\n\nA: You could send a regular kill signal to all instances of the PDF reader application.\nFirst, identify your application name. For GNOME default PDF reader is evince, for KDE this is okular. Now, kill all of those processes you own using pkill, like this:\npkill -u gert evince\n\nTo kill all evince processes owned by me (gert).\n\nA: You can use grep to find all the process and kill it using the below command\nkill -9 `ps -ef | grep \".pdf\" | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}'`\n\nHope this helps.\n\nA: Easiest solution is to go to Task Manager/Processes/Apps and close Adobe there. That will close all open pdf files.\n", "Q: Will Ubuntu 12.10 work on Lenovo Ideapad Z585 laptop?

I did have a very thorough look around about this problem such as wait a little longer since sometimes it cannot load all the wireless connections available that quickly. My wifi is a hidden network and I have used the connect to hidden network feature but it keeps asking for my wep key which has been checked 4 times (I counted) and it still seems to not work; It keeps asking for the WEP key. I did try both WEP 40/128-bit key and WPA & WPA2 since previously on my windows it worked; My family later decided to use WEP.\nI only have a quick fix using a usb wireless stick and I wish to have a more solid fix.\nThanks\nResults from sudo iwlist wlan0 scan\nwlan0     Scan completed :\n          Cell 01 - Address: 00:1E:73:C8:62:BD\n                    Channel:6\n                    Frequency:2.437 GHz (Channel 6)\n                    Quality=25/70  Signal level=-85 dBm  \n                    Encryption key:on\n                    ESSID:\"EnigmaHome\"\n                    Bit Rates:1 Mb/s;

I recently did a fresh install of 12.04 on three computers (two laptops, one desktop). For a while, I was able to connect to my FreeNAS media server through Browse Network, but the connection would timeout after a while and the only way to mount the device again was after a reboot.\nThings get more confusing. I wanted to share folders on the computers and was prompted to install Samba, which I did on one laptop and the desktop. That enabled me to see the two computers in Browse Network, but I wasn't able to mount the shared folders (yes, they were definitely shared). \nAfter some research, I thought installing cifs-utils would help, which I did on the computers with shared folders; however, after installation I could no longer see the computers through Browse Network. I removed the application and also removed Samba on the desktop. The result: I can see my FreeNAS server but not connect to it at all even after a reboot, but suddenly I am able to mount the shared folder from my laptop, which I didn't except after removing Samba.\nI never had any of these issues with 11.04, which is what I was using before installing the LTS. I could easily navigate shared folders and my FreeNAS, and never had any problems remounting a device any time during a single working session. \nI know the FreeNAS box is connected to my network, because I use it with wireless media players.

I am working in my final thesis and I need a stable k/x/ubuntu to this specification. \nThank u\n\nA: In my opinion the latest Ubuntu version or 12.04.1 LTS, would work fine on your laptop if you had at least 2Gb of Ram. Consider upgrading.\nIn the meantime I would try Xubuntu or Lubuntu.\nXubuntu is based on the XFCE window manager which is lighter than Gnome/Unity.\nLubuntu is based on the LXDE window manager and is ever lighter than Xubuntu. See this link for a comparision of the two.\n\nA: I'd recommend Xubuntu for this, due to its low load and stability, although Kubuntu shoudl be fine, if you really wanted that.\nI might actually recommend Lubuntu, however, since you only have one Gig of RAM.

So if I disable my root account with sudo passwd -dl root I still have access to sudo {su,bash} or sudo -{s,i} conceptually how are the elavated rights different from the root account? \nI know the difference between each of the elevations, or shells, I'm looking for an in-depth difference between an account and elevated rights? \n\nA: There is no difference.  sudo changes your user id to root, without regard for whether or not the root account has a password.\nThe difference between sudo -s and sudo -i is whether or not the environment variables ( things like $HOME ) are kept at your current values ( so ~ still points to your home directory ) or are reset to the values root would get if he logged in normally.\n\nA: passwd -dl root does not disable the root user. It removes and \"locks\" the password, i.e. it sets a meaningless password hash.\nHaving an account with a locked password means that you cannot log into the user using the password. su, login and lightdm won't allow you to login as root because, by default, they ask you the user's password.\nHowever sudo works in a different way: roughly, it has a list of users that are allowed to run sudo (the users in this list are called sudoers) and, by default, asks for the password of the user has launched sudo.\nThis is why, using sudo, you can log in into root even if root doesn't have a password. If you try the command su root, you'll see that you won't be able to log in, because it'll ask for a password that you can't provide.\nsu, login, lightdm, sudo, ssh and others are all programs that you can use to log in to a system as a user, but they handle authentication in different ways. It is important to not confuse the authentication method with the action of logging in.\nAs you might expect, the topic of authentication is pretty long and can be tricky. Explaining here all the authentication methods available and how to make use of them would be too difficult. Fortunately there's a tool that can give you more exhaustive answers: man, which surely you already know. You may be interested in reading:\n\n\n*\n\n*man passwd\n\n*man su\n\n*man sudo\n\n*man login\nIn particular, man passwd contains this paragraph which you might find interesting:\n   -l, --lock\n       Lock the password of the named account. This option disables a password by\n       changing it to a value which matches no possible encrypted value (it adds a\n       ´!´ at the beginning of the password).\n\n       Note that this does not disable the account. The user may still be able to\n       login using another authentication token (e.g. an SSH key). To disable the\n       account, administrators should use usermod --expiredate 1 (this set the\n       account's expire date to Jan 2, 1970).\n\n       Users with a locked password are not allowed to change their password.\n\nSo, to actually disable the root user you should run usermod --expiredate 1 root. While experimenting is always a good thing, remember that this command can be really dangerous and will make your box unusable. So, if you want to try it, be sure to know how to recover your system or (better) use a chroot/linux container/virtual machine/live CD/live USB.\nThat said, you'll notice that sometimes you will get a message like this:\nYour account has expired; please contact your system administrator\nsu: Authentication failure\n\nHowever, there are other ways to use expired accounts. For example, sudo ignores the expiration date of the destination user (but checks the expiration date of the sudoer). Also su ignores it, but only when run as root:\nYour account has expired; please contact your system administrator\nsu: Authentication failure\n(Ignored)\n\nTo really make a user inaccessible, you should deal with PAM. See man 7 pam and its SEE ALSO section for more information.\n", "Q: How do I write to an outer truecrypt volume when the inner volume protection prevents writng? In a nutshell\nAfter some time using the outer volume of a hidden volume in Truecrypt I cannot write to the outer volume anymore. The protection of the inner volume always kicks in before. How do I fix this?\n\nDetails\nI'm using truecrypt's two layered encryption of a USB stick. The outer container carries my semi-sensitive stuff while the inner hidden values has a bit more valuable information. I use both, the inner and outer volume regularly and that is part of the problem. Truecrypt can mount the outer volume for writing while protecting the inner. Usually the inner volume, when not protected this way (or mounted read-only) would be indistinguishable from free space. That is of course part of the plausible deniability scheme of truecrypt. \n\nAt the beginning, everything worked as expected. I could copy and delete data to the outer volume as I pleased. Now it seams that I have written and deleted enough data to have filled the outer volume once. Despite the write protection Ubuntu tries now to write to the continuous \"free space\" that is the inner volume. It does that although enough other free space is on the outer volume. But on this free space there used to be data so its fragmented and the file system write prefers continuous space. The write on the continuous free space of the outer volume of course fails (with the error message in the picture above) as Truecrypt's inner-volume-protection kicks in.\nThe Question\nI know this is expected behaviour, but is there a better way to write to the outer volume that does not attempt to write to the hidden free space at the end?\nThe whole question could be more generally rephrased to: How do I control, where on a partition data is written in Ubuntu?\n\nA: I do not know how it works with ubuntu, but with windows you can try a defrag tool like \"mydefrag\" and move all your data to the beginning of your disk (\"consolidate free disk space\"). The position where to write new data will be set to the end of your existing data.\nIf all your data already IS at the beginning of your disk (so mydefrag does not move any data) and you still cannot write (although there should be space in the outer volume left) you need to make mydefrag make some data movement, e.g. by choosing the option \"data disk monthly\" and abort it as soon as the first file has been moved.\nEdit: Works with FAT32. Don't know OP's filesystem. But FAT32 seems common to me for USB pendrives.\n", "Q: Can Searchmonkey find a term inside textfiles? Searchmonkey has a search option called \"Containing\".\n\nWhat can it do? Can it find a term in text file? \n\nA: Yes, searchmonkey can search inside the selected file and the advanced settings and options contain ways of refining the search so that case is matched, ignored, or wildcards can even be specified. You can also construct your own regular expression to use if you have a particularly complicated search request. \nYou can save the search criteria and results to a file, but with searchmonkey you can't modify the file that you are searching within, and you have to open it with your text-editor as the documentation notes. \nRegexxer, however, has options to search for files, and also to search and replace the search terms from a selected document or a whole series of documents. It is a more complete substitute for command-line tools like grep, sed, etc, but you could certainly use both searchmonkey and regexxer for your various purposes.\nAnother bonus is that regexxer integrates into Thunar very nicely, unlike searchmonkey; all you need to use in the custom actions is to add regexxer %F, and right clicking on the folder will open regexxer in that particular folder. \nSee my answer here for more details on regexxer and its various functions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Looking for a grep GUI\nThe screenshot shows the search within a text file with searchmonkey:\n\n\nA: Just to let you know, there is a new version of Searchmonkey available (0.8.3) that let's you look inside PDF files and the common word-processor files such as DOCX, ODT, DOC, etc.\nWe are currently working on making Searchmonkey even better, tighter and lighter, so please let me know if there are any new features or suggestions for the future of Searchmonkey.\nBest,\nAdam -

All this on a single cable and when i plugged this into the headset jack, i can hear sound perfectly. I have another port for mic. But i dont want to use it. I need to record sound from the mic on the headset through headset port. I dont think for buying a splitter for the headset/mic combo cable to work. When i checked the sound settings->Input(tab), there is an option \"Record sound from\" and it is selected to one and only in-built mic.\n\nA: The headphone jack, or line out, has its voltage controlled by the computer. Software on the computer tells the sound card to produce certain sounds, and the sound card creates an oscillating voltage in the headphone jack.\nThe microphone jack does the opposite; it controls the computer through its voltage. An oscillating voltage is induced there by an external device, and that gets measured by the sound card and made readable by software.\nThey are incompatible; one cannot stand in for the other.\nThere is some compatibility between the actual devices that attach to each type of audio jack. A microphone and a speaker work in basically the same way, and provided that you use microphones and speakers with compatible impedance, you can sometimes plug a microphone in where a speaker should go and hear sound from the microphone; and you can sometimes plug a speaker in where a microphone should go and speak into the speaker as though it were a microphone.\nThis doesn't usually work very well. A computer-compatible microphone is lower voltage (amplitude) than a computer speaker. The primary practical application of this concept was in using old telephones, when they started to break down. If you have a landline phone today, you can still often yell into the speaker and make yourself (faintly) heard on the other end.\nSince the microphone jack on your sound card only takes information in, and the line out jack on your sound card only puts information out, you're out of luck. This is a limitation in the sound card, and it cannot be overcome by an operating system (like Ubuntu).\nOn the other hand, if you tell us why you want to do this, it might be possible to figure out some other approach that would achieve your goals.\n", "Q: how to set free hard-disk size correctly? here is 12.10\npartition is 2 swap-devs with size of each 16 Gibi\nand one dev with boot and one dev with main-partition for home.\nI want to dissolve 1 swap-dev for to enlargen the home partition\nwith additional 16 Gibi.\nHow do I do this correctly without risk of data-loss ?\nThere is no partition-table ! command fdisk shows no reaction.\n\nA: There will always be a risk of data loss when you resize a partition with data on it.\nThat said, since you're making the partition larger, it should be a non-issue (though the partition software will likely still complain).\nThe usually-recommended partition software is gparted, which you can get from the repos. Using it, it should be fairly straightforward to do what you need to do. Here's a general run-down:\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete the swap partition.\n\n*Find the home partition and find the resize command\n\n*Resize it to use the newly-available space\n\n\nYou may have to do this from a LiveCD, since /home is mounted when you're logged in (I haven't resized partitions under Ubuntu in a while, so I don't know offhand whether it will let you resize while its mounted), but the steps will be the same in either case.\nEdit To provide a little better understanding of how partitions work, it might be good to think of it in terms of image editing.\nThe Gimp has a feature called \"Resize canvas\", which allows you to resize the editable area of your image, without resizing the image that's already there.\nIf you resize your canvas to a size smaller than what your image currently takes up, then it will warn you that resizing the canvas will result in some of the image being cropped.\nHowever, if you resize the canvas to a larger size than what you started with, you don't get this warning, because the canvas fits the image and has room to spare.\nThe same goes for hard drive partitions, basically. When you resize a partition, you're changing the amount of \"canvas\" on which data can be placed.\n", "Q: How do I copy files onto the hard drive?

Especially on a Windows Install that doesn't yet exist. Portable Programs that don't need to be installed can be moved over though.\nAs for copying files to Windows, First you need to have an actual Windows Partition(If you simply wiped Windows from your Harddrive when you installed Ubuntu this is not possible). Then open Nautilus(The File Manager, Orange Folder in Dash) on the left-hand side there should be a list of other Partitions on you Computer, simply click on the Windows one and it should mount and open the folder. If it doesn't appear there, open Disk Utility and make sure that Ubuntu detects it, if not please inform me using the comments.\n", "Q: How to stop updates nagging me in 11.10 \nPossible Duplicate:\nDisable Ubuntu Update Manager’s new version warning \n\nI'm running on 11.10.

I'm trying to connect to the server as root (on that server) from Nautilus running on behalf of my non-root account on my local Ubuntu desktop. The private key that is needed for authentication is not located in ~/.ssh (I've already got other keys there) but I have it in another directory.\nIn addition to the obvious approach, I tried putting root@server in the \"Server\" field and leaving \"User name\" and \"Password\" fields blank, putting the passphrase in the \"Password\" field, but it still says \"Permission denied\" and it doesn't ask for the private key at any point.\nI also tried ssh-add path/to/privatekey, but it says \"Could not open a connection to your authentication agent.\", however I'm not sure if ssh-add is even relevant here.\nI can ssh into the server from the terminal just fine with\nssh -i <...>/id_rsa root@server\n\nand answering the passphrase question that follows.\n\nA: The short version (skip the script) of Marcin Kaminski's solution is\nssh-agent\nssh-add /path/to/your/private_key\nnautilus sftp://user@server\n\n. I think it's easier to start with, to test if the solution works. I had the same problem after setting PasswordAuthentication no in /etc/ssh/sshd_config and these three commands solved my problem.\n\nA: I don't see why key selection dialogue should appear at all. It's up to the server to offer authentication methods it's willing to accept and up to the client to provide the credentials.\nOne of the most common methods for providing those details is using the ssh-agent which you don't appear to be running. This is a little snippet I've put in my ~/.profile to make sure my ssh-agent is always running:\nrun_ssh_agent() {\n  ssh-agent | grep -vi 'agent pid' > ~/.ssh-agent\n  . ~/.ssh-agent\n}\n\nif [[ -f ~/.ssh-agent ]]; then\n  . ~/.ssh-agent\n  if [[ -n ${SSH_AGENT_PID} ]]; then\n    if ! ps -p ${SSH_AGENT_PID} | grep 'ssh-agent' &>/dev/null; then\n      run_ssh_agent\n    fi\n  fi\nelse\n  run_ssh_agent\nfi\n\nPut the code there, log out of your X session, log back in, open a terminal and add your key to your agent:\nssh-add /path/to/your/private_key\n\nVerify that it's added by running ssh-add -l and connect to the server using Nautilus without providing the password.\n\nA: I could connect to my server in Nautilus (Ubuntu 12.04) using a private key by doing the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Nautilus, select menu: \"File\" -> \"Connect to Server...\"\n\n*Change \"Type:\" to \"SSH\"\n\n*Enter the address of the server in the \"Server:\" field (omitting username@)\n\n*Enter your user name after \"User name:\" but leave the password field empty.\n\n\nWhen you hit \"Connect\" a dialog should appear telling you a password is needed to unlock the key. In my case the key was not the default \"~/.ssh/id_rsa\", so communication between the SSH client and server must have revealed to Nautilus what key should be used.\nAfter entering the password, a new Nautilus window opened where I chould browse the files on my server. In the left pane I now have a shortcut \"SFTP for user on server\" which I can also use to u(n)mount the server file system.\n\nA: If I understand correctly, you are using public-key authentication but your private key requires a password to unlock, and the connection attempt is failing since you are apparently not prompted for the password protecting the key.\nThis question is slightly different, but the first answer seems to describe the same situation. However, it implies that the password dialog should just work. Perhaps it will provide a starting point though?\nSince you say it works if you use ssh in a terminal, presumably it is not something like the remote host identity changing, which I think can cause silent failures in nautilus.\n", "Q: How do I preseed multiple partitions on one disk; /tmp /data /usr swap? trying to get preseeding on 12.04 64bit with what should be a basic setup to work:\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/sda - the only drive beeing used\n\n*/ - rootfs - 100GB\n\n*/boot - 1GB\n\n*/tmp - 10GB\n\n*/data - should take all available space\n\n*swap - 10GB\n\n\n-\nd-i partman-auto/expert_recipe string \\\nboot-root :: \\\n1000 50 1000 ext4 \\\n$primary{ } $bootable{ } \\\nmethod{ format } format{ } \\\nuse_filesystem{ } filesystem{ ext4 } \\\nmountpoint{ /boot } \\\n. \\\n500 1000 10000 ext4 \\\nmethod{ format } format{ } \\\nuse_filesystem{ } filesystem{ ext4 } \\\nmountpoint{ /tmp } \\\n. \\\n500 5000 100000000 ext4 \\\nmethod{ format } format{ } \\\nuse_filesystem{ } filesystem{ ext4 } \\\nmountpoint{ /data } \\\n. \\\n64 2000 10000 linux-swap \\\nmethod{ swap } format{ } \\\n. \\\n500 3000 100000 ext4 \\\nmethod{ format } format{ } \\\nuse_filesystem{ } filesystem{ ext4 } \\\nmountpoint{ / } \\\n.\n\nIf i only use the code for /boot,swap and / it works.\nAlso i was wondering weather i have to specify some other recipe name than \"boot-root\", but trying \"thisNameIsNotDefinedInPartman\" the result was the same.\nThe Error message displayed by the ubuntu installer is always \"no root file system is defined\"\n\nA: I've solved it myself now.

Under Mac OS X 10.8.2, I patched the DSDT file and solved the same problem. I did some search, well, it seems DSDT overriding is no longer suported by Ubuntu. How can I fix this problem?\n\nA: A member of the community has described how to do this using grub rather than having to rebuild the kernel with the DSDT override config options enabled, so this may be an easier way to do it, see:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/grub2/+bug/1045690\nNote that the Ubuntu kernel team disabled the use of DSDT override because it is theoretically possible to damage you machine if it is mis-configured.  Also, one can introduce security issues by creating AML that can access memory with kernel privileges. Finally, with a modified DSDT using the DSTD override config option the kernel will be marked as tainted and one will get little or no support from the kernel team with a tainted kernel.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.10 - VirtualBox not sharing internet with guest system I went from ArchLinux to Ubuntu on my dev box.

The probelm is with the fan . They are running almost all the time . It is annoying and really bothering me. The system is not hot and the temperature for the 4 cores seems to be fine.\nWhat can be the problem and how to fix. I really don't want to go back to windows.\n\nA: (Elaborating on my comment as an answer, to provide more info and in case it is the cause.)\nLaptops with Nvidia cards and Intel processors come with a technology called \"Optimus.\" What it does is dynamically switch between the onboard video (Intel graphics) and the discrete video (Nvidia card), depending on the graphics needs. This is designed to help save battery life, while still providing good graphics performance.\nThe only problem is that Optimus is not supported under Linux by default. As such, it can cause a number of different issues, usually obviously graphics related (screen freezes, generally). That's where the Bumblebee project comes in. \nBumblebee is designed to bring Optimus support to Linux. It's still a relatively recent software, so it's somewhat hit or miss as to whether it will work for you, but it's worth trying.\nIf Bumblebee doesn't work, there is also the option to turn off Optimus in your BIOS settings. Simply go into your BIOS setup/settings when you first boot your computer (before the operating system loads), find the setting for Optimus, and turn it off. That will then force the operating system to use only one of the graphics cards (usually the discrete one). Do note, however, that doing this will likely make your battery life shorter, due to the increased power requirements of running the discrete card all the time (how much shorter depends on what you're doing and how smart the discrete card is when it comes to power consumption).\n\nA: You could configure your fans using i8kmon.\nI posted a guide about it here on askubuntu:\nDell Inspiron 5521 i7-3317U Fan CPU too Noisy\n", "Q: Create a GPT on a new volume during installation I'd like to install Ubuntu Precise (current LTS) on a drive, and I'd like to discard the current partitioning and instead create a new GPT on that drive. The ubuntu installer allows me to partition the device, and even allows me to create a new partition table, but I find no option to choose what kind of partition table I want, and the fact that subsequent creation of partition offers me a choice between primary and extended suggests that it will always create a MBR partition table.\nSo how can I create a GPT during install? Is there some more advanced install tool? Should I do this from the command line?\n\nA: Boot Ubuntu off the LiveCD or LiveUSB and run the Gparted tool.  Click the Device menu and then click \"create partition\".  You will then need to click the \"advanced\" widget so that you get the dropdown menu and will be able to select GPT from that.  You should then make your partitions, then install Ubuntu and use the advanced partitioner to tell Ubiquity how you would like to use them (or you can just use entire disk, as you wish).\nThe computer BIOS will need to be able to support GPT. If it's UEFI instead of BIOS this isn't a problem - GPT is part of the specification.\n", "Q: Graphics issues nvidia GTX 560 Ti I have a Asrock z77 Extreme 4 with a nvidia GTX 560 Ti video graphics card and I recently bought built it about six months ago.

Concentrate your efforts there. Is there something 'not standard' about where/how your graphics card is installed? E.g. I used to have a motherboard that listed the pci numbers backwards. The nvidia installer can fall down in such cases, especially with 2 graphics cards. If you get a black screen\nCtrl+Alt+F2\n\nlogin and attempt to fix/work out what is going on.

The following is taken from that answer:\nAssuming Ubuntu is being moved from D: to C: and if D: is /dev/sda2 and C: is /dev/sda1, then you'd hit 'e' on the first entry of the grub menu and change:\nset root=(hd0,2) becomes set root=(hd0,1)\nDelete the line - search --no-floppy xxx (as this overrides the previous set root command using the old UUID)\nlinux /boot/vmlinuz-xxxx root=/dev/sda2 ... becomes linux /boot/vmlinuz-xxx root=/dev/sda1 ...\nThis is a one-time override - hit Ctrl+X to boot, and make sure you run sudo update-grub after booting to fix the grub.cfg menu so it works the next time.\nPS: There may be some variations. (hd0,2) could be (hd0, msdos2) or (/dev/sda, msdos2) depending on the version of Grub. Also root=/dev/sda2 may be root=UUID=xxxxx\nHope this helps\n", "Q: How to make pulseaudio work again? I was having problems with sound (mono only output), so following advice from another askubuntu question I made some edits in /etc/pulse/default.pa.\nAfter rebooting I had no sound at all. So I deleted /etc/pulse/default.pa entirely and tried another reboot. I did not backup the file (stupid, I know).\nHow to come back to working config?\nI tried: sudo apt-get remove pulseaudio, reboot, sudo apt-get install pulseaudio and reboot.\nIt's still not working. The file /etc/pulse/default.pa is missing.\nHere's what pulseaudio and pacmd commands show:\n$ pulseaudio \nE: [pulseaudio] main.c: Daemon startup without any loaded modules, refusing to work.\n\n$ pacmd\nNo PulseAudio daemon running, or not running as session daemon.\n\n\nA: For those who come here at this time or later, especially if you have never messed with the system wide default in /etc/pulse/default.pa, do note that if you have a ~/.config/pulse/default.pa it completely replaces the system wide default.\nIn other words: If you get the error message\n[pulseaudio] main.c: Daemon startup without any loaded modules, refusing to work.\n\ncheck if you intentionally or accidentally have a file at .config/pulse/default.pa\nIf yes, try to move it to a backup location, and then restart pulseaudio. For example with opening a terminal, then typing\nmv .config/pulse/default.pa ~/default.pa.bak\npulseaudio -vvvvv\n\nIf you now see lots of lines scroll by, more specifically statements of modules loaded, then you know that you have solved the original issue.\nBecause this is hard to track down, especially if you are forgetful (like me), or because you got convinced by one of the many web pages dealing with pulseaudio issues that you should have a default.pa in the first place, there's already a launchpad bug filed against the behaviour that a user specific default.pa replaces the system wide default.pa. Thanks to Jim Carter for pointing me in the right direction.\nNow, if you also must fix the issue that pulseaudio at startup always directs sound to the wrong device, then you can configure your ~/.config/pulse/default.pa to hardcode the default output device with statements such as\nset-card-profile 0 output:analog-stereo\nset-default-sink 1\n\nThis is what I used to have in my config file, in order to prevent the computer from trying to output sound through HDMI connections. However in order for this to work, you would still have to add all the content of the /etc/pulse/default.pa file before those statements. Since that is error prone - consider what happens when the next apt-get dist-upgrade changes the system wide defaults - you can source the default config before your own statements.\nMy full user specific pulseaudio config file thus is\n.include /etc/pulse/default.pa\n\nset-card-profile 0 output:analog-stereo\nset-default-sink 1\n\nBtw, the full list of commands usable in these config files can be listed in a terminal by typing\nman pulse-cli-syntax\n\n\nA: Here's my default.pa file. Try putting it in the original folder, making sure it has the right permissions.\nNext time backup important files before you modify or delete them, but I guess you learned that lesson already.\n", "Q: SMPlayer not playing any sound I am trying to play various formats on SMPlayer but none of them have sound, mp4, mp3, flash videos after download from youtube, wav.\nThese are all playing with GNOME MPlayer, but I require the SMTube tool to watch youtube videos directly on SMPlayer.

For example, I always create in my home folder the directory \"mc\" and put inside of it the minecraft_server.jar file. This is because, when you execute the server it will create several files and folders.\nNow go to the folder where the minecraft_server.jar file is and either in the terminal or Nautilus GUI execute the file. in the terminal it would be:\njava -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar minecraft_server.jar nogui \nI recommend using the nogui parameter to avoid an additional window in the GUI. Afterwards just close the server by either pressing CTRL+C in the terminal where you opened the minecraft server or by typing /stop in the minecraft server terminal. The latter will automatically save any progress. I mention the fact that you need to close it since, the first time you run the minecraft server, it will create all needed files, including the minecraft server configuration file which is called server.properties.

The 2nd one is the group.\nLinux knows several layers that you can set permissions to that would apply to the user. One of these layers is a group: you can create a group, set permissions for that group and then add users to that group. Changing the group applies it to all the users to that group.\nIf you have 100 users it would be rather time consuming to set permissions to all of those users seperatly if large amounts of those users will have the same set of permissions.\nHave a look at AddUsersHowto on how to set this (bottom part includes command line options).\nWhen you type groups in command line you will see the groups you belong to yourself.

For example:\ndefault: sample\nenvironments:\n  sample:\n    type: ec2\n    access-key: YOUR-ACCESS-KEY-GOES-HERE\n    secret-key: YOUR-SECRET-KEY-GOES-HERE\n    control-bucket: juju-faefb490d69a41f0a3616a4808e0766b\n    admin-secret: 81a1e7429e6847c4941fda7591246594\n    default-series: precise\n    ssl-hostname-verification: true\n\nSee the EC2 provider documentation for more options. The S3 bucket does not need to exist already.\nNote If you already have an AWS account, you can determine your access key by visiting your account page, clicking \"Security Credentials\" and then clicking \"Access Credentials\". You'll be taken to a table that lists your access keys and has a \"show\" link for each access key that will reveal the associated secret key.\nAnd that's it, you're ready to go!\n\n\n*\n\n*https://juju.ubuntu.com/docs/getting-started.html\n\n*https://juju.ubuntu.com/docs/provider-configuration-ec2.html\n", "Q: Cannot install Ubuntu on an Acer Aspire One 756 I have used Ubuntu before, in virtual machines, but today I decided to make the leap and I bought a netbook to install Ubuntu as a \"real\" OS alongside Windows. The netbook I bought is an Acer Aspire One 756, with a 64-bit Intel processor, 4GB RAM, and Windows 8 as the default OS.\nI have now encountered several obstacles that actually prevent me from installing Ubuntu 12.10. Here are all the things I have tried so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*Used a live CD, in combination with a USB DVD drive. (I should point out that the Aspire One does not have an optical drive.) The computer does not boot in Ubuntu; the drive keeps spinning, but nothing happens, even though I changed the boot order in the BIOS.\n\n*Used a USB drive created via the tool available on pendrivelinux.com. Again, I've made changes to the BIOS to make sure the computer tries to boot from USB before using the built-in HDD. The results vary in this case: sometimes, the computer keeps rebooting like crazy until I remove the USB drive, at which point the computer boots into Windows 8, as expected. If I use a different USB drive, I get an error message that says that the USB drive has been blocked due to \"the current security policy\".\n\n*Tried to install Ubuntu via Wubi. The program appears to install something, but at some point during the installation process, I get a non-specified error message and nothing else happens.\n\n\nI am not sure if these are known issues; in any case, searching the forum has not yielded any results, so I thought I should simply describe my problem here in the hope that this question has not been answered before. I would greatly appreciate any help with this annoying problem. Of course, if anything is unclear, do not hesitate to ask for further details.\n\nA: \"The current security policy\" is probably something to do with UEFI SecureBoot.\nSee:\nShimming your way to linux on Windows 8 PCs\nThere should be a way of switching this off in your BIOS.\nThe user guide for your machine available here Acer User Guide suggests that \"Boot Mode\" in the BIOS should be \"Legacy\" for a non windows 8 OS \n\nA: I solved this issue time ago: I wrote a guide to install ubuntu together with WIN 8\nsee my answer here https://askubuntu.com/a/328236/181025\n", "Q: Applications not showing in Unity Dash I am running Ubuntu 12.04 on an IBM ThnkPad T42.

Same is true if I'm streaming video. Have I configured it wrong? I am using OpenVPN on Ubuntu 12.10. Thanks!\n\nA: This is probably down to the server configuration of your company. Do you have control of that? It sounds like it is pushing down a default route to ensure all traffic (including your IM and video streaming traffic) traverses the company network. If you don't want this behaviour then you probably want \"split-tunneling\". I'm not an OpenVPN user but a quick search threw up this thread which might help:\nOpenVPN split tunneling\n\nA: This is a very old question, but here goes:\nI suppose that your OpenVPN server pushes its gateway as default gateway to your clients. OpenVPN now allows clients to ignore it via the ignore-redirect-gateway directive that can be added to OpenVPN client configurations:\nhttps://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/IgnoreRedirectGateway\nThe exact directive to add to your client file would be:\npull-filter ignore redirect-gateway\n\n", "Q: Why don't I have System or Application on top?

I'm running 12.04 if that makes any difference.\nThanks for your help.\n\nA: This can be configured from within the game itself, usually from the Settings menu. For example, here's how to set windowed mode for SuperTux:\n\nThe in-game configuration can be done running the game, then choosing\n  the Options menu. There you can configure: Graphics Mode (OpenGL/SDL),\n  toggle fullscreen mode on/off, Enable or Disable Sound and Music, Show\n  FPS (Frames Per Second) and do a Keyboard Setup (changing what\n  keyboard keys do in the games' action).\n\n\nA: For most games you can find a setting either in the in game menu or in a game specific configuration file, most often located in ~/gamename/ or ~/.config/gamename/. For games where that's not the case there is no clean way to force it into a window, but in some cases one can hack something together. For SDL for example one can force the game into the desired mode by overriding the parameter it supplies to SDL.

Any idea how to fix this from Ubuntu (still couldnt get any Windows recovery tools to start from an USB stick..:)?\nThanks!\nFinal Update\nThe problem was in fact a corrupted start sector in Windows. After trying around for hours and manually creating an EFI-enabled Win7 USB stick (repair disk did NOT work, full disk was needed!) i was able to fix the bootsector.\nMany thanks for your help!\n\nA: It's possible that your Windows installation has been damaged -- for instance, if you resized your Windows partition(s) when installing Ubuntu, the resize operation might have corrupted your data. (It sounds like you did not resize partitions, but that's not 100% clear, so I mention this as a possibility.) If the problem is in Windows, your best bets are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try the Windows recovery tool (boot from an emergency disc if necessary -- they are available legally for download, although I don't have any links handy).\n\n*Ask for help on a Windows forum.\n\n\nOTOH, it's possible that there's a subtle problem with your boot loader configuration. I don't see anything obviously wrong in what you've posted, but it looks like something may have created backups of some of your Windows boot files. If Ubuntu did this during installation, it's conceivable that it's accidentally damaged some of those files. You should check out the various .efi files in what is, from Linux, /boot/efi/EFI/Microsoft/Boot. Check them against their like-named .bkp files. If the installer (or whatever created the .bkp files) did what seems logical, I'd expect these files to be identical. If the bootmgfw.efi file, in particular, is empty or seems damaged, that could be the problem.\nAnother comment along these lines: GRUB 2 can be weird sometimes, and configuring it manually can be tricky. Therefore, you might try using another boot manager instead of or in addition to GRUB 2. The easiest to install and configure is probably my rEFInd, but gummiboot is another possibility. To use rEFInd, you should be able to install it just by running its install.sh script from your Linux installation. When you reboot, you should see a boot menu with Windows and Ubuntu listed as options, and probably another for whatever's in the ESP's EFI/boot/bootx64.efi (most likely that's a duplicate of the Windows boot loader, but I can't be positive of that). If Windows works from rEFInd, then you can continue using rEFInd. If not, then rEFInd at least probably won't hurt, except to add a step to get to Linux. (You can easily uninstall rEFInd by removing the /boot/efi/EFI/refind directory; or you can reconfigure your system to boot Ubuntu directly from rEFInd, bypassing GRUB. See rEFInd's documentation on booting Linux for details.)\n\nA: *\n\n*Wait until all packages have a green check on this page: https://launchpad.net/~yannubuntu/+archive/boot-repair/+packages\n\n*then boot into your installed Ubuntu, connect internet, open a terminal and type the following command:\nsudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install -y boot-sav\n\n*Then run Boot-Repair --> Recommended Repair.

Is there anything I can do to fix this? \nThanks for your time,\n\nA: I was having the exact same problem with Ubuntu 12.10 on an Asus Eee pc 1225. I've had some trouble with ACPI functions with this machine in the past. I'm no longer buying Asus products because they are poorly made.\nAnyways, to fix this problem I added a boot parameter to GRUB. I found the suggested solution here:\nKeyboard not working on a Samsung 300e5a laptop\nI tried adding acpi=noirq but that seemed to only re-enable the keyboard. The touchpad still didn't work. Next I tried acpi=off. That worked to get both keyboard and touchpad working. I also tried acpi_osi=Linux and that also worked. I tried rebooting and not changing the boot parameters and the keyboard and touchpad again didn't work. It only worked with acpi_osi=Linux and acpi=off. Your results may be different.\nTo change the boot parameters, check this link:\nHow do I add a kernel boot parameter?\nBasically, when GRUB starts at boot, press E to bring up the editor. Find the line that starts with linux and add acpi_iso=Linux to the end of it, and then press Ctrl+X.\nThen if that fixes your problem, make the changes permanent by editing the /etc/default/grub file. Find the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT line and add acpi_iso=Linux to the end of the value on the right. Save, run sudo update-grub and reboot.\nI hope that works out for you. Good luck.\n", "Q: How to install \"libgtk1.2\" on Ubuntu 12.04/64bit?

I've lately been having an issue with my root filesystem becoming readonly. It happens some amount of time after boot. I don't know exactly when it happens, as I don't usually notice it until something such as suspending the computer or printing fails. It seems to be fairly random. Since most of my system is on that partition, I can't re-mount it without rebooting.\nAfter this happens, the system runs a fsck. Sometimes it prompts to fix problems; other times it apparently finds none.\n\n\n*\n\n*To troubleshoot, I've searched through the logs but found nothing relevant. This might be due in part to not knowing when the actual errors took place.\n\n*The filesystem is apparently good to begin with, as when fsck runs its fixes it doesn't report any errors.\n\n*I've scanned the disk with SpinRite. A while ago, SpinRite found and recovered from some bad sectors on the hard drive. I ran a level 4 scan (a thorough scan) after this probem appeared, but SpinRite found nothing.\n\n*The SMART data reports that the disk is OK with 63 bad sectors. The number of bad sectors hasn't changed recently.\nI realize that the disk isn't in the best of conditions, and I have complete backups in case of catastrophic failure. Yet the lack of errors in the logs, combined with SpinRite's test results and the unchanged SMART data makes me think that this problem has some cause other than disk failure.\nOther than disk failure, what could cause my symptoms?\n\nA: In my experience if he system automatically decides to remount a medium read-only that either means that \n\n\n*\n\n*the medium is broken\n\n*or the file-system on the medium is broken.\n\n\nIn the latter case a fsck run could help. But if a bad block has broken the file system chances are high that it won't be long before another bad block appears - possibly breaking something more vital.\n", "Q: SSH from external network refused I've installed open-ssh-server on my home computer(running Lubuntu 12.04.1) in order to connect to it from school.\nThis is how I've set up the sshd_config file:\n# Package generated configuration file\n# See the sshd_config(5) manpage for details\n\n# What ports, IPs and protocols we listen for\n#Port 22\nPort 2222\n# Use these options to restrict which interfaces/protocols sshd will bind to\n#ListenAddress ::\n#ListenAddress 0.0.0.0\nProtocol 2\n# HostKeys for protocol version 2\nHostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key\nHostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key\nHostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key\n#Privilege Separation is turned on for security\nUsePrivilegeSeparation yes\n\n# Lifetime and size of ephemeral version 1 server key\nKeyRegenerationInterval 3600\nServerKeyBits 768\n\n# Logging\nSyslogFacility AUTH\n#LogLevel INFO\nLogLevel VERBOSE\n\n# Authentication:\nLoginGraceTime 120\nPermitRootLogin no\nStrictModes yes\n\nRSAAuthentication yes\nPubkeyAuthentication yes\n#AuthorizedKeysFile %h/.ssh/authorized_keys\n\n# Don't read the user's ~/.rhosts and ~/.shosts files\nIgnoreRhosts yes\n# For this to work you will also need host keys in /etc/ssh_known_hosts\nRhostsRSAAuthentication no\n# similar for protocol version 2\nHostbasedAuthentication no\n# Uncomment if you don't trust ~/.ssh/known_hosts for RhostsRSAAuthentication\n#IgnoreUserKnownHosts yes\n\n# To enable empty passwords, change to yes (NOT RECOMMENDED)\nPermitEmptyPasswords no\n\n# Change to yes to enable challenge-response passwords (beware issues with\n# some PAM modules and threads)\nChallengeResponseAuthentication no\n\n# Change to no to disable tunnelled clear text passwords\n#PasswordAuthentication yes\n\n# Kerberos options\n#KerberosAuthentication no\n#KerberosGetAFSToken no\n#KerberosOrLocalPasswd yes\n#KerberosTicketCleanup yes\n\n# GSSAPI options\n#GSSAPIAuthentication no\n#GSSAPICleanupCredentials yes\n\nX11Forwarding no\nX11DisplayOffset 10\nPrintMotd no\nPrintLastLog yes\nTCPKeepAlive yes\n#UseLogin no\n\n#MaxStartups 10:30:60\n#Banner /etc/issue.net\nBanner /etc/sshbanner.net\n\n# Allow client to pass locale environment variables\nAcceptEnv LANG LC_*\n\nSubsystem sftp /usr/lib/openssh/sftp-server\n\n# Set this to 'yes' to enable PAM authentication, account processing,\n# and session processing.

I've also tried with TCP/UDP (actually two rules because my router requires separate rules for each protocol).\nWith any router port forwarding configuration, I am able to log in with\nssh -p 2222 -v localhost\n\nBut, when I try to log in from school using \nssh -p 2222 onlyme@IP_ADDRESS \n\nI get a \"No route to host\" message. Same thing when I use the \"Broadcast Address\" or \"Default Route/Primary DNS\". When I use the \"subnet mask\", ssh just hangs. However, when I use the \"secondary DNS\" I recieve a \"Connection refused\" message.\n:^(\nSomeone please help me figure out how to make this work.\n\nA: Once you can connect to the machine from inside your LAN, the rest is completely outside of the control of Ubuntu running on that machine. So the problem is likely to be somewhere outside of your Ubuntu box. Possible causes may include:\n\n\n*\n\n*incorrectly configured port forwarding on your router. Note that the internal IP of your machine may change when you reboot it, especially if you have more than one device in your LAN, it may depend on the order addresses are requested from the router's DHCP. You can use ifconfig command in the console to see your IP address.\n\n*you using an incorrect IP when trying to connect from outside (actually, \"No route to host\" message strongly suggests that). Google \"what is my ip\" to find one of many sites which will tell you what your current external IP is. Note your external IP may change if you reboot the router.\n\n*As a \"security measure\", some providers block incoming connections to their client's ports - either all ports or a range of well-known ports. There may be some setting in the ISP's control panel or you may need to call them to figure this out.\nSo the way to debug the problem would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*make sure you can connect from within LAN\n\n*make sure you correctly configured port forwarding on the router using the correct internal IP of your machine\n\n*figure out your external IP\n\n*make sure you can ping that IP, use traceroute to see where the packets are blocked\n\n*possibly try configuring forwarding for some \"easier\" service, such as HTTP first to exclude problems with authentication etc.\n\n\n(also, I'm not sure why you're mentioning DNS stuff - everything is done via plain IP addresses, DNS has absolutely nothing to do with it)\n\nA: Reading your comments I think part of the problem is that you're using the wrong IP. DNS is the Internet Phonebook, not your External IP. Go to Google.com and type \"ip\" in the search. Google will tell you your External IP. \nAlso go to a Library and use one of their computers, download the Portable Putty client HERE(Run the Installer and choose the Desktop as the Install Location, It will extract the Files to a Folder, the just run PuttyPortable.exe) and then use it to try and Connect to your Home PC. Make sure to delete it after your done with it because most Libraries don't like it when you download programs to their PCs(but they won't check anyway).\nThere are also Online SSH clients that will give you a free 5 minute session so you can try those from the Home PC itself. Although you may want to change your Password temporarily before you attempt so for security reasons.\n\nA: I finally figured out what was wrong: I didn't know anything about TCP/IP. I was using the wrong IP. Since my IP is dynamic, I made a script to dump it into a dropbox folder.

working software by upgrading from natty narwhal to oneric ocelot? I would like to know what happens with my good tuned system on natty narwhal when I upgrade to oneric-ocelot. I cannot find any threads in the forum which is very strange.\nThanks for your answers in advance\nCiao\nRoberto\n\nA: *\n\n*I wouldn't suggest to stay on 11.10: After upgrading to oneiric ocelot, you should be aware that support (security updates) for 11.10 will be ended in April 2013. You could upgrade to 12.04 after that and have support until 2017: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases\n\n*If you use gnome desktop 2.x, you should consider installing gnome-session-fallback (which is a gnome 2.x look-alike and you can select it upon logging in). You could also try out other desktop managers like cinnamon desktop from a ppa.\n\n*When you upgrade, the system disables any third party repositories, even launchpad PPA archives. You can always re-enable them.\n\n*Before trying upgrade you should backup your data (and/or partitions to another disk), at least the important stuff, so that in the small chance of something going wrong you have them stored in a safe place.\n\n*As a personal note, always keep your changes in a text file, e.g. \"I installed these packages: (names of packages)\" or \"I use this ppa for this reason (link to ppa)\" or \"I changed file (path to file) to be like this (paste the contents of the file\". This way you always know what you changed and you can format the root partition of ubuntu and re-apply your changes.\n", "Q: How to search for all the files starting with the name \"ABC\" in a directory? I need to search for files starting with some particular name. There can be multiple files starting with a particular pattern and I want to list all such files present in the directory.\n\nA: There are many ways to do it, depending on exactly what you want to do with them. Generally, if you want to just list them, you can do it in a terminal using:\nfind | grep '^\\./ABC'\n... and replacing ABC with your text.\nTo understand the command, let's break it down a bit:\n\n\n*\n\n*find lists all files under the current directory and its sub-directories; using it alone will just list everything there. Note that find outputs each file or directory starting with ./, indicating that their path is relative to the current directory. Being aware of this is important because it means we will search for results starting with ./ABC and not just ABC.\n\n*The pipe character | redirects the output of one command to another, in this case the output of find is redirected to grep. This is called piping.\n\n*grep takes the output and filters it using the given pattern, ^\\./ABC.\n\n\n*\n\n*Notice that the pattern is quoted with single quotes ' ' to prevent the shell from interpreting the special characters inside it.\n\n\n*Now the pattern itself is written in a particular syntax called regular expression, or regex for short. Regex is an extremely powerful searching tool if you master it, and there are sites such as this which teach you about it in more depth, but note that grep is not a full-fledged regex engine and you can't do everything with it.\n\n*For our purpose:\n\n\n*\n\n*^ in regex matches the beginning of the string; this prevents it from matching the pattern if it doesn't occur in the beginning of the file name.\n\n*. in regex has a special meaning too: it means \"match any single character here\". In case you want to use it as a literal dot, you'll have to \"escape\" it using a backslash \\ before it. (Yeah, matching any character would be harmless in our case, but I did it for completeness' sake.)\n\nA: You can use find command to search files with pattern\nfind . -type f -name \"abc*\" \n\nThe above command will search the file that starts with abc under the current working directory.\n-name 'abc' will list the files that are exact match. Eg: abc\nYou can also use \n -iname\n -regex \n\noption with find command to search filename using a pattern \n\nA: You can search for a particular pattern using the Nautilus file manager and regular expressions.\nTo do so, click on Select Items Matching in the Gear menu like below (you can also press Ctrl+s).\n\nThen, just type the regular expression ABC* and validate.\n\nEvery file whose name matches your pattern will be automatically selected.\n\nI'm using Nautilus 3.6.* from GNOME3 PPA on Ubuntu 12.10 (Quantal).\n\nA: The easiest solution to me\nls | grep PATTERN\n\nHere you can give any regular expression in the PATTERN.\nFor example, to find files with \"ab\" anywhere within its name, type\nls | grep \".*ab.*\"\n\nTo find the files starting with \"ab\", type\nls | grep \"^ab\"\n\n\nA: you can use GREP, I think this is the most simple solution, probably also add some other grep parameters to make the match more accurate\ntree | grep ABC\n\n\nA: If you don't know the directory the ABC* files are located in, and you have millions of files, the locate command is the fastest method.\n$ locate /ABC\n/mnt/clone/home/rick/.cache/mozilla/firefox/9fu0cuql.default/cache2/entries/ABC6AD2FEC16465049B48D39FD2FE538258F2A34\n/mnt/clone/home/rick/.cache/mozilla/firefox/9fu0cuql.default/cache2/entries/ABCBFDA54262F47253F95ED6ED4131A465EE0E39\n/mnt/clone/usr/src/linux-headers-5.0.1-050001/tools/lib/lockdep/tests/ABCABC.sh\n/mnt/clone/usr/src/linux-headers-5.0.1-050001/tools/lib/lockdep/tests/ABCDBCDA.sh\n/mnt/clone/usr/src/linux-headers-5.0.1-050001/tools/lib/lockdep/tests/ABCDBDDA.sh\n/mnt/old/home/rick/.cache/mozilla/firefox/3vkvi6ov.default/cache2/entries/ABC0C99FCEABAD0C6AA2078CD025A1CDE48D7BA1\n/usr/src/linux-headers-5.0.1-050001/tools/lib/lockdep/tests/ABCABC.sh\n/usr/src/linux-headers-5.0.1-050001/tools/lib/lockdep/tests/ABCDBCDA.sh\n/usr/src/linux-headers-5.0.1-050001/tools/lib/lockdep/tests/ABCDBDDA.sh\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*The above command takes 1 second to run on 1 million files.\n\n*In comparison the find command starting at / root directory will a very long time and generate many permission errors.\n\n*If files were created today you must run sudo updatedb first.\n\n\nA: To complete existing answers:\nls\nThe default directory list utility ls can be used in combination with the shell's wildcards . To search for all files with pattern abc:\nls -d abc*   # list all files starting with abc---\nls -d *abc*  # list all files containing --abc--\nls -d *abc   # list all files ending with --abc\n\nNote that the file extension is relevant for the search results too.\n\ntree\nIn case we need to list files in a directory tree we can also issue tree to search for a given pattern like:\ntree -P 'abc*'  # list directory tree of file starting with abc---\ntree -l 'def*'  # exclude files starting with def---\n\nIn this case, tree itself supports wildcards.\n\nA: Command-t in one of my favorite vim plugins, it's ruby based plugin above integration with FZF.\nBy using Comamnd-T and FZF you can do the search with an extremely fast \"fuzzy\" mechanism for:\n\n\n*\n\n*Opening files and buffers\n\n*Jumping to tags and help\n\n*Running commands, or previous searches and commands\n\n*with a minimal number of keystrokes.\n\n\nAs you can see \n\nI always search in command history by opening a new terminal and hit:\nCTRL+R\n\nIn addition to searching in all folders recursively by writing in any terminal tab:\nfzf\n\nThen start your file name\nABC\n\nAlso, you can write inside vim \n:CommandT \n\nReally helpful especially in large folders. \n\nA: I use \nls | grep abc\n\nor \nls -la | grep abc\n\nIt show all files with abc, not just starting with abc. \nBut, It's a really easy way for me for to do this.\n\nA: Python:\n$ python -c 'import sys,os;found=[os.path.join(r,i) for r,s,f in os.walk(\".\") for i in f if i.startswith(\"ABC\")];map(lambda x: sys.stdout.write(x+\"\\n\") ,found)'\n\nPerl:\n$ perl -le 'use File::Find;find(sub{ -f && $_ =~/^ABC/ && print $File::Find::name  },\".\")' \n\n\nA: printf \"%s\" /path/to/files/ABC*\n\nThis is glob pattern matching which is anchored at both ends. This will match all occurrences of files starting with \"ABC\" such as \"ABC\", \"ABC.txt\", \"ABC123\", but not \"xABC\". From the command line using 'ls' in place of 'printf' here is a safe alternative however, depending on who's opinion you agree with, 'ls' is not safe for use in a script. In that case using 'printf' with glob pattern matching is considered safe. If you going to use this in a script the output of 'printf' will not contain a new line character until the end of the output stream as such:\nprintf \"%s\" /path/to/files/ABC*  \n\nReturns:\n/path/to/files/ABC /path/to/files/ABC123\n\nIf you need line breaks after each instance:\nprintf \"%s\\n\" /path/to/files/ABC*\n\nReturns:\n/path/to/files/ABC \n\n/path/to/files/ABC123\n\n\"/path/to/files/\" remains in the output if you entered it that way when you ran the 'printf' command. Without it just the file name appears:\nprintf \"%s\" ABC* \n\nReturns \nABC ABC123\n\nAssuming you run the command within the directory in which the files exist. \n\nA: Assume that I am at the root directory and I want the list of the etc directory only:\nwe write,\nfind -type d -name \"etc\"\n\nresult we get,\n[root@unix /]# find -type d -name \"etc\"\n\n./etc\n./usr/lib/firefox/bundled/etc\n./usr/lib/unix-yarn/etc\n./usr/lib/unix/etc\n./usr/lib/festival/etc\n./usr/bin/lib/vmware-tools/lib64/libconf/etc\n./usr/bin/lib/vmware-tools/lib32/libconf/etc\n./usr/etc\n./usr/share/doc/oddjob-0.30/sample/etc\n./usr/share/festival/lib/etc\n./usr/local/etc\n./usr/java/jdk1.7.0_25/lib/visualvm/etc\n./home/user1/Desktop/VMware Tools/vmware-tools-distrib/lib/lib64/libconf/etc\n./home/user1/Desktop/VMware Tools/vmware-tools-distrib/lib/lib32/libconf/etc\n./home/user1/Desktop/VMware Tools/vmware-tools-distrib/etc\n./home/user1/Desktop/VMware Tools/vmware-tools-distrib/caf/etc\n\nAnother Example, \nAlso we can write:\nls | grep \"etc\"\n\nwe get,\netc\n\n", "Q: High temperature in a AMD Radeon HD4000/3000 series after upgrade I was running 12.04 with Unity 3D for 6 months; my laptop ran almost silently and cool enough to hold on my lap with ~4 hours of battery life.

My computer was not in the 60s prior to the update.\nFIXED!!:\nProblem solved. Thank you to @DrA7 and @YellowApple to pointing me in the direction of graphics card problems. I found this wonderful question and implemented @Nick Andrik's solution. In a nutshell, installing the proprietary drivers (fglrx-updates) from ppa:andrikos solved the problem. I can now use ATI Catalyst to choose my power mode and which graphics card (Intel or AMD) I want to use. My temperatures are down to ~44 degrees and battery life is up to ~4 hours again. I also installed Jupiter, which improved battery and temperatures further.\nThe open source drivers for AMD seem to be getting better, however it looks like their support for hybrid graphics cards (like mine) is not quite up to spec. Use the proprietary drivers for now.\n\nA: Background: ATI PowerPlay vs Open source drivers\nMany people are experiencing drawbacks on graphics performance and powersaving capabilities after upgrading to Ubuntu 12.10. This is ascribed to the lack of driver support for X Server 1.13 that comes with the Ubuntu upgrade forcing people to use open source drivers or downgrade to previous versions of X Server. Although the open source drivers has been improved vastly in recent years they are not up to the level of the power management of PowerPlay supplied with the proprietary ATI drivers.\nA few things to notice here for others who might be reading:\nThis only affects HD 4xxx graphics cards and below. Users of later cards should have no problem using the ATI Catalyst drivers. See this question for known issues though.\nPossible solutions\nI have yet to find fully automated solutions that works at the level of ATI PowerPlay GPU management. However I did stumple accross some interesting tools and tricks that essentially enables you to control the GPU profiles.\nDowngrade to previous version of X Server and install Catalyst ATI drivers.\nPerhaps the most straight forward method is to not use X Server 1.13 at all. Use Tomasz Makarewicz's ppa for downgrading X Server to 1.12 and install fglrx-legacy catalyst drivers. The success to which these packages solves the problems are mixed so you should be mindful about doing this.\nTo add the repository for the packages type in\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:makson96/fglrx\n\nUpdate and upgrade the system to apply the downgrade of X server:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nand finally install the legacy driver\nsudo apt-get install fglrx-legacy\n\nIf you wish to uninstall these packages and get back to the Xorg drivers you need to remove the repository and return to the standard version of X server. This can be done using ppa-purge:\nsudo apt-get install ppa-purge\nsudo ppa-purge ppa:makson96/fglrx\n\nwhich will automatically remove packages associated with target repository. Simply reboot and you should have the Xorg drivers installed again.\nManual control of the power method\nThe Xorg drivers provides features for controlling the power methods of Radeon graphics. Dynamic control should be enabled by default, letting the system mange the power profiles itself. To view the current state of power control you can run\nsudo cat /sys/class/drm/card0/device/graphics/fb0/device/power_method\n\nThis will show either dynpm (automatic control) or profile (manual control). If you wish to control the power profiles yourself you may set it to profile by\nsudo echo profile > /sys/class/drm/card0/device/graphics/fb0/device/power_method\n\nand provide a valid profile using\nsudo echo mid > /sys/class/drm/card0/device/graphics/fb0/device/power_profile\n\nPossible options are\ndefault\nauto\nlow\nmid\nhigh\n\nTo re-enable the dynamic power management simply run\nsudo echo dynpm > /sys/class/drm/card0/device/graphics/fb0/device/power_method\n\nRadeon Power Profile Manager\nGnome 3 users might be interested in the Radeon Power Profile Manager extension, controlling the GPU profiles from the Xorg drivers. I admit I haven't tested this tool myself, but it is worth a try.\n\n\nA: I've found that 12.10 (and Ubuntu-based distros based on 12.10, like Linux Mint 14) tend to run really hot with open-source drivers on AMD/ATI GPUs for some reason.  Installing the proprietary driver helps - or at least it helped me.  Go ahead and give that a try.\n\nA: I think that it must be related to your video drivers.\nCould it be that while using 12.04 you had the proprietary drivers installed but somehow switched to open source after upgrade?\nYour problems match mine exactly and I have 12.10 installed on a HP Pavillion G7, with i5 and Intel HD3000/Radeon 6850 graphics hybrid.\nI would assume that you are currently only using the Intel GPU and that is what is causing your problems. (Yet somehow your GPU temperature reading is the highest...)\nI have yet to find a better solution than applying the Grub parameters you described in Edit 3, along with installing Jupiter and setting it to \"Power Saving\".\nEDIT;\nAm currently for the first time since upgrading to 12.10 able to display Unity using fglrx after applying the solution you suggested in \"FIXED!!\", that is, \"installing the proprietary drivers (fglrx-updates) from ppa:andrikos\" without any further modifications.\n\nA: I had high t due to high uncalled CPU usage. Somehow installing bumbleebee paired with installing jupiter reduced CPU usage and t!\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:bumblebee/stable sudo add-apt-repository\nppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates sudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install bumblebee bumblebee-nvidia linux-headers-generic\n\n\nA: The high temperature is most likely due to a heavy load either on the CPU or on the GPU or both.\nIn your case it seems both are quite hot. I would recommend narrowing down the problem by checking what is using your resources. Issuing the command top or better yet htop in a terminal, then sorting the processes by CPU usage might help you find the task causing the high temperatures.\ntop is already installed by default. Personally I find htop much more userfriendly though. Hit F6 to sort by CPU with htop. \nTo install it: sudo apt-get install htop\n\nA: I had the same problem with both Ubuntu 12.04 and 13.04 on my Sony Vaio SVE1512W1ESI laptop with an AMD Radeon HD 7500M/7600M card.

As the machine heats up in during use and then cools down after being turned off, the memory modules and graphics card tend to move ever so slightly in their slots. Over time the movement causes the component to lost its contact with the motherboard.

I tried installing it through a live cd but the computer hung on the very first screen showing 2 icons at the bottom.\nContent of my cd shows wubi.exe instead of .iso file.\nI downloaded ubuntu-12.04-desktop-i386.\n\nA: This is what worked for me, \n1) Turn off acceleration in the Intel Rapid Storage Tech. It will take a while.\n2) Click reset to available (it will show up once you disable acceleration) which should remove the fake raid thing and free your SSD.\n3) Use some disk utility such EaseUs, to turn your HP Recovery and HP_Tools partitions to logical. Now, you should have atmost 3 primary partitions. If not, then make sure that you don't have more than 3 by changing to logical/removing unnecessary partitions that you may have created. Create some unallocated space from one/more of the partitions. ~10GB is good. DO NOT CHANGE BOOT PARTITION TO LOGICAL.\n4) Restart and enter BIOS, turn off the Intel Rapid Start Tech.\n5) Install using live USB by selecting \"Something Else\" in the unallocated space.\n6) Now, you may turn on Intel Rapid Storage and Intel Rapid Start. The exact same config in the Intel Rapid Storage cannot be restored so what you could do is make 18.6GB cache volume and the rest data volume. From that data volume, you could turn 4GB into hibernation partition using command prompt and use the rest for storing any files that you access frequently.\n* Apparently, there is no way to put back the same config of 4GB data(hibernation) volume and 26GB cache volume.\n* All this may seem to be out of the blue and look like as if I am talking about random stuff but if you have googled enough, you'd know what I am talking about.\nGood Luck!\n\nA: So after many times trying I was finally able to do it.\nDespite HP's best attempts to stop me from running a Linux distro off the SSD I finally cracked it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Get rid of the fake RAID setup on the SSD by disabling Intel Rapid Storage. \n\n*Delete the volume on the SSD by using the windows disk management tool (diskmgmt.msc) or some other disk utility.\n\n*Use a disk utility to clone the HP_TOOLS partition onto a flash drive or something. (Not entirely necessary, but if you want to put it back eventually then you can)\n\n*Delete the HP_TOOLS partition from the main hard disk.\n\n*Resize your C: partition so that you have about 250 MB to 1 GB of free space on the main hard disk. This is to create space for the \\boot partition for the linux install. (This is because the BIOS is setup in such a way that you CANNOT boot from the SSD).\n\n*Create a live usb using unetbootin or some other usb installer software.\n\n*Boot from the USB (I think you can only boot from the usb slot on the right hand side, but don't hold me to this)\n\n*During installation make sure to place the \\boot partition for your linux distro on the main hard disk, IT WILL NOT BOOT OF THE \\boot PARTITION IS ON THE SSD. Then you can go ahead and place the \\root partition on the SSD.\n\n\nAnd boom super fast linux dual boot.\nI don't think i left anything out.

It ran well at first, but after some time, it started to slow down. This was more noticeable when I was playing games and changing the volume. I tried reinstalling Ubuntu, but the problem persisted. Windows 8 is running fine. I have an AMD Vision A8 Processor (1.9 GHz) and 8 GB of Memory. I have the same problem with other distributions. Does anyone know why I am having this problem or how to fix the problem?\n\nA: You are probably running the open source drivers which don't perform well in (some) games. I recommend installing the fglrx drivers, you can read more about this on the ubuntu wiki: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI\n\nA: Windows viruses are largely meaningless on Ubuntu or any other Linux operating system. However, you are still subject to attacks by third parties e.g. malware.\nUse a firewall (e.g. gufw) if you're using SSH, FTP etc. and install a plugin on your browser that stops scripts running without your consent.\nIf you haven't taken steps to secure your PC, that might explain why Ubuntu consistently becomes slow after some time, even when you reinstall it.\nThose preventitive steps will cost 10 minutes of your time, and while they may not be what is wrong in your case, it's worth the effort anyway - and it would help with the process of elimination.\n\nA: This is most likely related to one of two things.\nTemperature\nCheck the temperature sensors and make sure there sane. I had an HP once that no matter what I did the GPU would overheat and cause issues. If your CPU or GPU is getting to warm Linux will throttle it to maintain stability, then if it gets worse, it will shutdown the box to prevent damage.\nPoor Hardware Support\nI see this a lot. Check all your hardware, specially your graphics card and sound card against one of these methods. On one of my HPs they cheeped out on the sound card and it would cause all kinds of hang ups when power management kicked in.\nOne more check\nNext time the slow down happens, immediately tail -n 1000 /var/log/syslog and see what it says.

I'm using Ubuntu 12.10 on a Samsung R710 laptop which is equipped with a NVIDIA GeForce 9600M GT. At the moment, proprietary driver v310.14 (nvidia-experimental) is installed. \nSince my second monitor runs on full HD resolution, I'd rather trade the antialiasing feature for increased performance.\nIs it possible to disable antialiasing completely for all applications without having to disable it in every single app?\nThanks in advance for your suggestions!\n\nA: Yes, this is possible using nvidia-settings.  Launch this application, and then on the left hand side, you should see all your XScreens listed.  Find the xscreen corresponding to the monitor and go to antialiasing settings.  From there you can override application settings and turn off antialiasing for everything.\n\nA: I've found that if you enable the \"FXAA\" setting in the NVIDIA X server settings, fonts in Ubuntu look terrible, especially in Chrome.  Disabling OpenGL in Compiz also fixes it, but then Unity won't load.\nAfter chasing the issue for some time, I finally figured out that it was the FXAA setting.  Yes, I've tested it numerous times and it is definitely that setting that does it.  DISABLE FXAA and the fonts look good again.\n\nA: If you install gnome-tweak-tool, you can switch off or adjust antialiasing in the fonts section.\n", "Q: I am trying to run the update manager The package system is broken\ncheck if you are using third party repositories.

I am using an Ubuntu 12.10 (ARMHF) distribution on a panda board. I want to run applications compiled for ARMEL. It was not possible due to a changed dynamic loader location (https://wiki.linaro.org/OfficeofCTO/HardFloat/LinkerPathCallApr2012)\nI succeeded by creating the following symbolic link\n/lib/ld-linux.so.3 -> /lib/ld-linuxarmhf.so.3\nIs there a way to install a portability package instead? \nIs there a reason why this is not done by the distribution?\nThanks in advance\n\nA: The dynamic linker is baked in at compile time. to see which dynamic linker is being used run. readelf -l /usr/bin/foo | grep Request\nThe only way to change this is to adjust the gcc spec files. See gcc -dumpspecs | grep ld-linux. Or by passing the --dynamic-linker flag to the linker at build time with something like gcc -Wl,--dynamic-linker,/lib/ld-linux.so.3 foo.c\nHowever none of that is needed if the toolchain is setup up right, and you really should not mess with it unless you really have a reason for it.\nIn short your solution is probably the best one, however I would try to find the armhf package and use that if you can, or rebuild the package.\n\nA: Perhaps, such a compatibility package doesn't exist (for the purpose of running older, 3rd-party armhf binaries expecting /lib/ld-linux.so.3 instead of the new standard, agreed upon /lib/ld-linuxarmhf.so.3, right?) because that package (if installed) would give a \"false promise\" to suit just any armel binaries. But the armhf dynamic linker must break armel binaries because the ABIs are incompatible, if I understand this correctly. (In this case, the correct solution would be to wrap the few special non-standard armhf binaries so that the expected location of the dynamic linker is adapted for your system. Or re-write this value in the binaries. If this is possible. Then this won't cause any problems when you'd try to run real armel binaries.)\nOn the other hand, if you want to run real armel binaries on an armhf system, you need simply to go for \"multiarch\" (and hence use a real armel dynamic linker, instead of your symlink!): install the armel prerequisites for your armel binaries. Among the prerequisites, libc6:armel or the like (correct the pkg name if I'm wrong, please) would certainly include the needed  /lib/ld-linux.so.3.\n(Regarding the incompatibility of the ABIs: As I could understand, in armhf, floating-point arguments are passed directly in floating-point registers, whereas in armel, they are passed in integer registers. This indirection adds extra cost for ARM that support floating-point, that's why armhf is better for modern ARM.)\n", "Q: Stop Google Chrome being the default browser in Lubuntu 12.04 \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to set the Default Browser from the Command Line? \n\nDue to an issue presented here I was inclined to use Google Chrome instead of Chromium. \nI have set Firefox as the default browser and disabled that in Google Chrome, but the latter keeps opening the links in Office Writer (for example).\nIt is the same issue as here, except that here I use Lubuntu, and the answer there is for Gnome/Unity, and I do not have that settings.\nOr do I?\n\nA: Source: here.\nFire in Terminal\nsudo update-alternatives --config x-www-browser\nenter password, see something like this\n\nType the number of your default browser of choice and then enter.\nThat's it.\n", "Q: unable to login to ubuntu after upgrade to 12.10 Ubuntu 12.10 upgrade results in blank screen after login\nAfter upgrading to 12.10, I can't login anymore.

Because of this I went a little further to Ubuntu.\nRight now, I am having this problem. I use internet via a 3G Modem, model HUAWEI E303C. The ISP service provided is with Movistar in Argentina.\nThe problem is that I can't establish a connection with the Modem. I mean, since I installed Ubuntu and configured the Broadband Mobile access, it never seems to establish a connection to it. The modem is correctly recognized however.\nBecause of this, I tried to reinstall 12.10 (Downloaded the ISO image), this time, before using my 3G modem, I updated the system and rebooted. Then I proceeded to connect the 3G Modem to the PC and to configure it. Went to the Network icon --> Edit Connections... --> Mobile Broadband. From there I configured the modem since the default was Movistar Argentina. The curious thing is, after saving what I configured, I went to the Network Connection icon and for the first time, I could establish a connection, but there was no internet access from the modem. I tried loading some pages and they just stayed on \"loading...\". I then rebooted the PC again, but this time, I haven't been able to establish the connection.\nIt caught my attention that Ubuntu asked me to create a report about the problem, particularly with the USB section. The thing is, after all of this, my question is:\nHow can I configured and establish a connection with my E303C 3G Huawei Modem in order to use the Movistar 3G Argentina Service provided in my country.\nAgain many thanks, I am new to this system but I actually love it, specially the terminal. I love the fact that I can use commands to configure stuff.\nReally hoping that somebody can help me. Many thanks.\nPS: I don't know a lot of English, this is why I used a translator, although I know is not the same.\nORIGINAL:\nRealmente soy novato en Ubuntu, pero hace un tiempo había probado Xubuntu y me gusto, por lo que fui un poco más alla. \nEstoy teniendo este problema. Uso internet a traves de un módem 3G, cuyo modelo es HUAWEI E303C. El servicio es brindado por movistar argentina.\nEl problema es que no puedo establecer una conexión con el mismo. O sea, desde que instalé ubuntu, configure la banda ancha móvil, nunca establece conexión, pero al modem lo reconoce.\nFrente a esto, volví a reinstalar ubuntu 12.10 (es la iso que descargue), esta vez, antes de usar mi módem 3G, actualicé todo el sistema. Luego, reinicie, ahora con el módem 3G conectado. Fui a editar las conexiones, banda ancha móvil, configure mi conexión tal cual es la predeterminada para movistar Argentina. Lo curioso, es que guarde, fui a la conexión y por primera vez pudo establecerse la conexión, pero igual no andaba internet... quedaba cargando. Reinicié la máquina, y nuevamente, no he podido establecer más la conexión.\nMe llamó la atención, que ubuntu me pidio de informar un problema del sistema, y particularmente era con el usb-data, o algo asi. \nLa cuestión, es que quisiera saber de que manera puedo configurar mi módem 3G Huawei E303C para poder utilizar mi servicio de Movistar 3G Argentina. \nMuchas Gracias, soy nuevo en este sistema, pero realmente me encanta... sobre todo la terminal... me encanta poder usar los comando para configurar las cosas. \nEspero que alguien pueda ayudarme.

T_T\nim new in ubuntu so im '0' it came to linux.i dunno if swap area can effect dual booting and bring error after installation.^^\nif theres a lack of information about my specs please do remind me^^,\n\nA: As a base minimum, it's highly recommended that the swap space should be equal to the amount of physical memory (RAM). Also, it's recommended that the swap space is twice the amount of physical memory (RAM) depending upon the amount of hard disk space available for the system (although this \"recommendation\" dates back from a time when physical RAM was very expensive and most Unix systems ran with many processes in swap space - a situation that hardly applies in most situations these days, but ancient Unix/Linux myths like this \"recommendation\" tend to survive well past their \"use by\" dates).\nIn reality, if you use hibernation you need what was outlined in the relevant paragraph above, otherwise you need as much swap space as your system will use - which actually may be very little in a modern hardware setup. The only downside to having more swap space than you will actually use is the disk space you will be reserving for it. \nExample Scenarios\n\n\n*\n\n*Low RAM and low disk space: With 512 MiB RAM and 30 GB hard disk, use 512 MiB for swap since RAM is very low.\n\n*Low RAM and high disk space: With 512 MiB RAM and 100 GB hard disk, use 1 GiB for swap since RAM is very low and hard disk space is plentiful.\n\n*High RAM and low disk space: With 2 GiB RAM and 30 GB hard disk, use 1 GiB for swap since hard disk space is very low.\n\n*High RAM and high disk space: With 2 GiB RAM and 100 GB hard disk, use 2 GiB for swap since hard disk space is plentiful. \n\n\nFor More Information : Swap FAQ\n\nA: Swap area is the area which you allocate to use as virtual memory when you'll run out of RAM.\nIn old days it was a thumb rule to allocate double space of the RAM for swap. Now a days it's not must to allocate double space for Swap. You have 8 GB of RAM, you don't need to allocate 16 GB for swap. 2-4 GB will be enough for you.\n", "Q: How do I make Thunderbird 17.0 stop notifying me with junk mail?

Then log out/in\nXDG_DOCUMENTS_DIR=\"$HOME/Documents\"\n\n\nA: How does this work?\nThe \"special\" directories in home (e.g. Documents, Music, etc.) are updated early in the login process by a program called xdg-user-dirs-update. If $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/user-dirs.dir (by default this is the same as ~/.config/user-dirs.dir) is present it uses this to set the directories. The content of this file should look something like this:\n# This file is written by xdg-user-dirs-update\n# If you want to change or add directories, just edit the line you're\n# interested in. All local changes will be retained on the next run\n# Format is XDG_xxx_DIR=\"$HOME/yyy\", where yyy is a shell-escaped\n# homedir-relative path, or XDG_xxx_DIR=\"/yyy\", where /yyy is an\n# absolute path.

However, if you remove the target location of $XDG_DOCUMENTS_DIR (like in this question) and reboot (or, presumably, logout), the program will assume you don't want to use it any more and reset the target to \"$HOME/\", effectively disabling it. \nHow do I get it back?\nSimply re-setting the relevant value back to your chosen location in this file should return everything back to normal. \nIn this case, that means using your text editor of choice to change\nXDG_DOCUMENTS_DIR=\"$HOME/\"\n\nto\nXDG_DOCUMENTS_DIR=\"$HOME/Documents\"\n\nOf course, the Documents/ directory (or whatever you choose) should be present if you don't want to go through this process again ;) The change should be picked up by the file manager as soon as you open a new window, there's no need to restart or logout (it doesn't appear to be picked up straight away by the Unity launcher, though). \nAlternatively, you can use the command line:\n$ xdg-user-dirs-update --set DOCUMENTS \"$HOME/Documents\"\n\nJust for completeness, you can fetch the PATH for a particular \"special\" location with:\n$ xdg-user-dir DOCUMENTS\n\nEnter man xdg-user-dir for the list of XDG user dir names, though they should be obvious from the file content pasted above.\nReferences\n\n\n*\n\n*freedesktop.org\n\n*man xdg-user-dirs-update\n\n*XDG Base Directory Specification\n", "Q: How to install git server on my ubuntu desktop 12.04 I'm developing a project on my desktop and I'm in need of a version control mechanism.\nI'm working on ubuntu 12.04, desktop edition.\nI would like to have a git server installed on localhost and also the client will be installed in the same computer.\nIt's easy to install the client but I can't find a full explained guide of how to install the server..\nI found a guide of installing gitosis but it's no longer supported (not supported on ubuntu 12.04)\n\nA: You shouldn't need to install a Git server on your local machine to work with Git. Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS), ss such there really is no idea of a Client and Server. Instead you just have clients, as many clients as you want, which can talk to each other.\nSo when you type git init in a directory and create a git repository, you've got all you'll need to commit, merge, branch, and ultimately use git. For all intensive purposes, this is the master source, the \"god\" source, equivalent to the SVN server. Unlike in subversion, where there is a centralized source, only one true \"god\"/master copy, Git works in a way that everyone who clones a git repository has their own \"god\"/master copy. So when you share code, each person gets the theoretical equivalent of an SVN server on their machine in the form of a portable git repository. This strongly differs from the centralized model (and lends to it's distributed nature) where if your source becomes deleted it does not affect anyone else. In fact if you lose your source you can clone from someone else who has a copy of the repository and continue as if nothing happened. So long as N+1 people have a copy of the code, if all of N lose it the code will live on.\nWhat most DVCS tools provide is a flexibility of workflow. Many people adopt a centralized workflow using services like GitHub or Bitbucket to host a remote copy of their repository. In this setup there is still fundamentally just two git repositories. One on your machine and one on the services remote servers. I strongly recommend reading the free git-scm book before getting started to familiarize yourself with what git is, how it works, and how to use it.\n\nA: Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS). There is no need for a git server though one can be set up if you insist on it. Sometimes a centralized server is used (think Github) and a local server can be set up, but this is usually not the way most git users use the system. Most people do in fact use git as a distributed system with no server and no hub.\nYou may want to read about the philosophy behind git:\nPro Git Book\nGit Documentation\nStrictly speaking Hg Init is talking about Mercurial which is another DVCS system but it does provide one of the most succinct and best explained descriptions of what a DVCS is, and it is still mostly relevant to git\n\nA: @Bush - sometimes people like to distribute knowledge a little too much vs just answering the question \nYour reasons for setting up a GIT server can be whatever they are . \nservices like Github & repositoryhosting.com basically provide GIT servers for you to use as remotes \nso i am assuming you also want a remote setup on your own where you can push code to ?\nhere is a few tutorials you should use :\nhttp://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-on-the-Server-Public-Access\nyou can also use something called Gitolite - another tutorial is at http://realcnbs.com/\n", "Q: How to create a OS X Mountain Lion Bootable USB drive on Ubuntu? I already know how to do it on Mac OS X (plenty of instructions online).\nBut is it possible to do it on Ubuntu? If yes, how?\n\nA: why not just dd the .img file after conversion?\nsudo dd if=/path/to/orig.img of=/dev/s**\n\n\nA: As you want to create a LiveUSB you need a .iso image to make it. The Mac image is a .dmg file, so you must to convert this file into .iso, and then install it. \nInstall DMG2IMG\nDMG2IMG (1, 2) will convert the .dmg image into a .iso image.  To install open a terminal and enter this command: sudo apt-get install dmg2img\nConvert the Image\nWith dmg2img you will create an .img file and this file will have the same format as an .iso file, you just need to replace the extension.  \nIn the terminal enter the following commands or paste the script with the necessary modifications:\n# Replace \"OriginalFile.dmg\" with the filename including the extension\n# of your file. The extension will be replaced where necessary unless\n# you want to specify the filenames yourself.\n\nfilename=\"OriginalFile.dmg\"\n\n# Replace with your file name and it will create the IMG file\ndmg2img -i \"${filename}\" -o \"${filename%.dmg}.img\"\n\n# Note that the extension of the first file is \".img\"!\nmv \"${filename%.dmg}.img\" \"${filename%.dmg}.iso\"\n\nMake the LiveUSB with an ISO image\nNow you already have the .iso image, with which you will make the LiveUSB.

I think the reason why I am not seeing my files from the ubuntu system is because there is no such partition.\nBest Denis \n\nA: Wubi indeed does not create a partition but creates a file in your Windows partition and mounts it as a loopback device (a way for Linux to access a file as if it was a partition).\nThe file should be under program files, under wubi or ubuntu folder (depends on the version of wubi, it's been a while since I used it).\nYou can boot the system with an Ubuntu live CD/USB, access the windows partition from the Ubuntu live system, it should be one of the accessible filesystems on the launcher.\nIn the Windows filesystem find the Ubuntu \"drive\" file under program files, and then do the following in the terminal (ctrl+alt+t launches a terminal):\nsudo mkdir /media/wubi\nsudo mount -o loop,ro /path/to/ubuntu/file /media/wubi\n\nReplace the \"/path/to/ubuntu/file\" with the location of the \"drive\" file.\nNow you should be able to see a filesystem that is your Ubuntu drive and can copy/upload/email whatever you want from it.\nKeep in mind, that your Windows filesystem may be read only on a 12.04 live system, and that by following my instructions, the Ubuntu filesystem is also read-only.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.10: Installing proprietary Nvidia driver causes freeze at boot Ok, so I just installed Ubuntu on my laptop, and I immediately encountered an issue: the HDMI audio output won't work.

I need to upload a scanned image as a PDF document.\nAfter scanning the document, I have a .jpeg with small text that I want to edit before converting to PDF for the upload. \nI have never done this before so I'm really stuck. How can I do this?\n\nA: We can also edit text on top of an image with Libre Office from where we can also easily export this files as PDF.\n\n*\n\n*Open your document to insert the image with Insert -> Picture -> From File....\n\n\n\n*Then choose \"Wrap -> In Background\" from the right click context menu on the picture you just inserted.\n\n\n*Write any text above the image (but we will have to place it with newlines, and spaces or tabstops). Any preexisting text needs to be overwritten. In the example below I have done this by choosing a black background and a white font colour.\n\n\n\n*Finally we can do \"File -> Export as PDF...\".\n\nA: To make text in a .jpeg editable you need Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software. \nI use ocrfeeder.  \nsudo apt-get install ocrfeeder\n\nTo open an image file click on the 'plus' (+) sign.\n\nAfter you have opened the image, click on the next icon to the right to run OCR.\n\nAfter is has finished OCR'ing the image, you can select the text you want on the left, and copy it out on the right.\n\nThe easiest way to get the text out is to just copy it over to LibreOffice.\nWith a little editing, my copy looks very similar.\n \nAfter you make the required changes you can export them as .pdf by clicking 'export as pdf' from the LibreOffice toobar.\n \nUltimately its best to scan to .pdf if you can.  If you can't this works very well. \nNOTE:  OCR is not 100% accurate, you may have to correct errors, and the more formatting your document has, the harder it will be.\n\nA: You can't edit text in a JPG, but you remove the text and add new text.\nFor images, try gimp (open source alternative to Photoshop). Open the image with gimp, then use the eraser tool to erase the old text. Then use the text tool to add new text.\nOr, use inkscape, which is a vector graphics program (similar to Adobe Illustrator). Create a new SVG file and paste in your JPG. Then, cover up the old text with a new text box. \nI would start with gimp but for your image maybe inkscape works better. You can install either code from the software center, or use these lines in a terminal\nsudo apt-get install gimp\n\nsudo apt-get install inkscape\n\n\nA: You cannot directly edit text in an image file. You can edit the image file using a program such as gimp and place new text on top of old but that's it. Sorry.\n\nA: Sometimes I don't want to printscreen a page and convert it. Then I use this little script:\nHow can instantaneously extract text from a screen area using OCR tools?\nIts the fastest way to convert picture to text for me and it works almost very good.\nSo my suggestion is, you scan the document and open the picture. At the same time, you open an editor and copy the parts you need to the editor. \nWith easystroke you make a gesture for the script, it is really easy and fast.\n", "Q: Why is the middle button mapped to pasting? I'm in love with Ubuntu, but I really HATE this feature. I am a programmer and it happened a number of times that I introduced a bug because I inadvertently pasted some code which didn't belong there. I still have nightmares from debugging.\nAnd I can't even turn it off in the 'Mouse and Touchpad' window.\nI think it's a weird design decision. Most people expect the middle mouse button to map to scrolling. What was the rationale behind this decision?\n\nA: It predates Ubuntu and Debian, and the design decision in these OSes has been, as far as I can tell, lack of a contrary design to change historical X-Windows behavior.\nI realize I'm responding to an old question, but I'm talking about the 80s and 90s, so I think that's fitting.\nSee also Jeff Atwood's post at Codinghorror.com. (2008, sheesh!  Practically yesterday.) \nEspecially relevant: \n\nIn the UNIX and X Windows world, the middle button has also meant\n  paste since way, way back in the 1980s. I can't find any evidence of\n  this behavior on Windows or the Mac, however. Pasting into text areas\n  wouldn't necessarily conflict with the tab behavior, but it's an odd\n  hodgepodge of behaviors to attach to a single button.\n\nIndeed, I pasted that block quote with my ancient and still functioning PS/2 three-button mouse (no scroll-wheel ;  a real three-button mouse).  \nI recently ordered a new-fangled yet old-school 3-button mouse.  This one is optical and has a usb connector.  Wow. It was about $20 USD, and available from many online vendors.\nBehold, the HP DY651A :\n\nI'd say buy one now, so you can enjoy an authentic X-Windows *nix experience before it disappears.  \n\nA: The middle mouse button is mapped to paste the current X-selection, which is normally whatever text is selected. This happens because back in the early days of gui's there was disagreement about how copy/paste should work. Some wanted there to be an explicit command to move something into the copy buffer, others wanted whatever was selected to be moved in there automatically. The makers of X11 (way back when these disagreements were still going strong in the 1980's) decided to implement both and make both sides happy, putting mouse-3 to paste the current selection and ctrl-c/ctrl-v for the copy and paste more commonly found today. \nAs to how to stop it the unfortunate truth is that you cannot without either patching X or disabling the middle-mouse button all together (which can be done by running\nxmodmap -e \"pointer = 1 25 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\" \n\nor by putting the line pointer = 1 25 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 in your ~/.xmodmap file).\nMy advice would be stick it out. The X-selection copy functionality is actually quite useful in many places and it is one of those things you quickly get used it.\n", "Q: Multiple terminals don't always restore I generally keep half a dozen terminal windows open. On reboot, usually they are restored to their previous size and position, even if I have closed them all before rebooting.\nHowever, sometimes they don't restore but are all on top of each other in the upper left of the screen. Is this a bug, or is there a setting somewhere that can guarantee that they will be restored as desired? \nI have tried adding \"gnome-terminal --load-config=my_saved_config\" to my profile, but this just doubles up the number of terminals, so apparently the configuration is already being saved somewhere else. \nWhere is all this controlled? I have searched the forums and the likely places in the file system, but have not found anything.\nThanks\n\nA: If you organised your terminals on screen (as in the screenshot below), and then from one of the four you ran gnome-terminal --save-config=Mik4, the resulting file will be saved to the present working directory (pwd) of that terminal (or the script running that command). \nHowever, if the present working directory (pwd) in which you saved the config was anything other than /home/$USER, running gnome-terminal --load-config=Mik4 will not work, as it only looks in /home/$USER. You need to specify the exact location where you saved it and run, for example, gnome-terminal --load-config=~/DOS/Mik3. Then you can could add your command  as a custom shortcut or you could even replace the standard Ctrl+Alt+T. \nIt does restore my configuration perfectly for me every time, and seems to be fine as long as you select the correct config file; it is best to keep your configs in /home/$USER, then you can save and load without needing to remember to specify any other directory.\nEntering man gnome-terminal doesn't give the full options, but gnome-terminal --help-all should provide any further information that you need. \n\n", "Q: Mythtv 0.25 rescan for videos I have been searching for instructions regarding rescanning the /var/lib/mythtv/video folder.

There are a number of guides on how to do this online with different ones working in different ways.\nIf all you want is a bootable USB with Ubuntu for fixing a computer, use UNetbootin. It extracts the ISO to the USB and set it up to be bootable. It's probably worth \nreformatting your USB first, just to be sure it's going to work properly.\n\nA: I had this problem in the past and I believe I solved it using Unetbootin version 494 instead of the latest.\n", "Q: data: loss on installation I installed 12.04 some time ago. Prior to that I had been running Ubuntu 11? as a dual-boot \nsystem. I am still a novice with all this and I assumed (wrongly) that I would be able to do the same when I upgraded - I guess that I must have done something wrong during the install. The problem that I have is that I seem to have lost 2,000 or so photographs and I would like to get them back if possible. Any help would be gratefully received.\n\nA: Have you re-installed Ubuntu 12.04 on the same partition as before? Then it should have asked before installing whether to overwrite all data - and remove it in the process. There should have been an option to upgrade (AFAIK) which should keep all data intact. I'm going to assume you have overwritten that partition.\nIf that is the case - you are essentially screwed. The photos are most likely lost. But maybe not entirely. So read on. If your case is different, please edit your post accordingly (for example, if your home directory is on a separate partition, the photos are most likely still there). The partition setup is the most important bit.\nFirst: don't touch that Ubuntu installation until you have either recovered all you wanted or given up. Starting Ubuntu WILL make matters even worse.\nI have once used a program called TestDisk which seemed to do the job (but AFAIK it didn't do what I wanted, but not at the fault of the program). There is a program by the same developer, called PhotoRec, which should be able to recover photos and other file types from a partition. You can run it from Windows. Starting Windows should not affect the Ubuntu partition (if you haven't done anything than the standard dual-boot install). It will ask for a partition and will search for photos on it. This will take a long time. Filenames and directory structure is most likely lost. And it may not be able to recover all images. But when you have only installed Ubuntu and not done too much other things with that installation, it is, in the best situation, able to recover most of the photos.\nFor the next time, it is (in my opinion) best to put the /home directory on a separate partition (as ext4) and maybe create an additional partition as ntfs that is shared between Windows and Ubuntu. This is the way I use partitions and it works very good with re-installations. Normal upgrading (via the Update Manager / Software Updater) will not erase any data this way. Re-installing Ubuntu on the same partiton as before only removes the OS, not the data (except for directories outside /home like /var/www). It is then only needed to enter the same partitions in the installation dialog so they are automatically mounted on system start (or they may be entered manually in /etc/fstab, but that's more advanced and probably off-topic).\n", "Q: What's wrong with lualatex?

I have a new HP Envy dv6 7200 with dual boot Windows 8 / Ubuntu 12.04.  In windows, the F12 key in Windows activates the \"airplane mode\" switch which enables/disables both on-board (mini PCIe) and USB wireless adapters.  In Ubuntu, however, the wireless adapter is turned off by default and cannot be turned back on via the F12 key (or any other combination of F12 and Ctrl, Fn, Shift, etc.).\nLet me explain the \"fixes\" I've seen in various forums and explain what did or did not happen.  These are listed in no particular order.  (Spoiler alert:  wireless is still broke).\nSolution 1?  Use HP's \"Wireless Assistant\" utility to permanently activate the wireless card in Windows, then boot into Ubuntu to happily find it working.\nUnfortunately, this utility works in Windows 7 but not Windows 8.  On the other hand, hardware drivers from HP are only available for Windows 8 for this model.  Catch 22 (I could not find a comparable utility for Windows 8).\nSolution 2?  Use a USB wireless adapter to sidestep the on-board device.\nI purchased such a device from thinkpenguin.com to be sure that it would be Linux-friendly.  However, the wireless switch enables / disables all wireless devices including USB.  So, there's my $50 donation to the nice folks at thinkpenguin.com, but still no solution.\nSolution 3?  Following the Think Penguin folk's suggestion, modify the mini PCI express adapter following instructions here:\nhttp://www.notebookforums.com/t/225429/broken-wireless-hardware-switch-fix\nTempting, but I then violate the terms of my warranty mere days after opening the box.  This might be a good solution for an older machine that you want to get your geek on with, but not for a new box.\nSolution 4?  rfkill unblock all\nNo effect whatsoever.\nubuntu@ubuntu-hp-evny:~$ rfkill unblock all\nubuntu@ubuntu-hp-evny:~$ rfkill list all\n0: hp-wifi: Wireless LAN\n    Soft blocked: no\n    Hard blocked: yes\n\nSolution 5? Re-install drivers.\nDone and done.  Ubuntu recognizes the device - perhaps even without re-installing the drivers? - but cannot turn it on.  How do I know this?  In the Network Manager drop-down menu, the wireless option is blacked out and a message reads something like: \"wireless network is disabled by a hardware switch\".\nSolution 6? Identify a physical switch on the laptop and flip it.\nThere is no such switch on this machine.  In fact, walking through Best Buy yesterday, I checked and not a single new laptop PC had a physical switch on it.  All of the wireless switches are either the F2 or F12 key ...

I contacted HP Tech Support & put in a request for the BIOS department to add an option to enable the Wireless card (Linux) or disable it (windows) - if enough owners do this perhaps they will actually release a BIOS update with this fix.\nI upgraded the RAM today and the wireless card is easily accessible just to the left of the RAM slots. Taping the appropriate pin (Solution 3 above) to prevent the card being disabled by the BIOS is relatively straight forward - unplug the 2 aerials & undo 2 screws to lift out the card.\nAnother possible solution would be a KVM virtual machine running WinXP / Win7 with the wireless card passed through to the Guest using USB Passthrough & using the \"HP wireless Assistant\" to turn the card on & off.\n\nA: I have an HP Envy dv6-7375ez laptop running dual boot Windows 8 and Ubuntu 12.04.03. The laptop comes with a Ralink 3290 wireless card. In Windows, it works fine. Airplane mode is switched on and off with the F12 key.\nTo get wireless to work at all in Linux, I had to upgrade the kernel to 3.6.11-030611-generic. Some people reported having problems getting this driver to work in 12.10, but I wanted to stay with 12.04 LTS anyway, so I upgraded the kernel. Details are here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1049466/ (see comment #16).\nYou can then follow the instructions in this link to download, build and install the Ralink 3290 native driver: Wireless driver - how to load manufacturer's STA file (Ralink 3290). I was thus able to get wireless to work if no ethernet (wired) connection was present. However, Bluetooth and wireless WLAN seemed always either both enabled or both disabled. Turning one off or on would do the same to the other. Since I really don't care about Bluetooth and would rather have it off all the time, this was less than satisfactory.\nAfter that, I updated the BIOS in a Windows Update session, and then I was always getting the \"Wireless network disabled by hardware switch\" even though I had run \"sudo rfkill unblock all\". Blacklisting the HP driver finally did the trick (see what it is called by doing \"sudo lsmod | grep hp\" ... on my system it is \"hp_wmi\").\nI can now even turn wireless on or off using the F12 key. :) However, the indicator light is always the same, and after you hit F12 it takes a few seconds to toggle (i.e. enable/disable) the wireless, so check the network menu in the status bar to see what it is at the moment. I can live with this for now.\n", "Q: How do I find lost folders Somehow (I don't know how) I seem to have lost my Documents file.

The install closes and I'm back at the desktop, and the cursor is showing the \"loading\" symbol, as if it were still working. Then the screen goes black, with the same cursor. After that, nothing. I left it over night like that thinking it was doing something, in the morning it was still black with the cursor circling or whatever.\nSo what could be causing this?

Changing the theme in qtconfig to another one, such as QtCurve, does have an effect though.\n\nA: Since QT and GTK are two distinct toolkits to create GUIs, what applies to the first doesn't necessarily apply to the last, and vice versa. GTK+ themes apply to applications that are built using the GTK+ toolkit, and the QT themes apply only to apps built using the QT framework. Unless an application is compatible with GTK, it won't adopt a GTK theme. What qtconfig does is imitate GTK themes in the QT framework.It still can't apply properly the GTK theme to a QT item. As for why it didn't work, are you sure you have the proper qtconfig? There are two, one for QT 3 and another for Qt 4. for KDE 4 apps you need the latter. I've changed the QT themes from qtconfig to GTK+ and they did change but they still look fake and don't have the GTK touch to them.\n", "Q: Install ubuntu like it was bought at a store \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I pre-install Ubuntu for someone (OEM install)? \n\nWhen you buy a computer the first time you start it up you create an account for it.

I'm working on a DBus service that needs to export objects on demand when requested by 3rd party applications. That part seems fairly strait-forward.\nBut I also need to \"garbage collect\" these objects when it has zero consumers. I could have API that requires the 3rd party applications to explicitly release the objects, but the downside is if the consumer application crashes without releases the references, unused objects would accumulate.\nFor what it's worth, I'm using DBus from Python via python3-dbus. So I have 2 questions I guess:\n\n\n*\n\n*What sort of mechanisms does DBus provide for reference counting on exported objects, is there a way to know when zero processes are currently \"observing\" an object?\n\n*What is considered the best-practice for designing such a DBus API, and what do people think is a good example to follow? (The only thing like this I can think of is the Avahi Browser objects.)\nMy question will probably make more sense if I describe the exact problem: Dmedia is a specialized distributed file-system aimed at media files. Files are given a globally unique ID based on their content-hash. When an application needs to use a file (say for playback or display), it will use the Dmedia DBus API to resolve the file ID into a regular file path. For example, this ID:\n5PULSAF3PFR4VPNJMLSAJ362HG475NDKKISDYXW7WUJCFUJN\n\nCould for example resolve into the file:\n/media/MyDrive/.dmedia/files/5P/ULSAF3PFR4VPNJMLSAJ362HG475NDKKISDYXW7WUJCFUJN\n\nBut things are more complicated than that. The file might not be available locally, in which case Dmedia can download the file from one of the user's other devices or from the cloud. So we need signals for say download progress, and to signal what that regular file path is once a file is downloaded.\nThe resolution also might change over time when removable drives are connected or disconnected. A user might remove a drive, at which point the file isn't available locally and Dmedia would try to download it. Or the user might plug in an additional drive, and the resolution of a given file could change as Dmedia re-load-balances across the drives.\nIt seems that having a DBus object exported per current file-of-interest is a reasonable approach, but perhaps that's making things too complicated. I suppose it's the difference between needing more filtering and smarts on the consumer vs the service side. A flat collection of signals and methods on a single object would make things easier for the service, but put more burden on the consumer.\nIf we export a DBus object per-file-of-interest, I'm rather certain we need the garbage collection as a very large number of files can be of interest at some point during the DBus service lifecycle.\nI'd much appreciate any advice on this!\n\nA: First, it's probably worth unpacking what “observing” means in:\n\nWhat sort of mechanisms does DBus provide for reference counting on exported objects, is there a way to know when zero processes are currently \"observing\" an object?\n\nThe only sense in which it makes sense to ask whether something is ‘observing’ a DBus object is whether a client will receive any signals that object raises; there's otherwise no concept of observation, just message passing. Clients do this by calling AddMatch/RemoveMatch on the bus, so you could theoretically reference count on matches. That seems like a method prone to error, though - you'll basically need to reimplement the daemon's match handler in order to be sure you've caught all the ways a client can listen to your signals.\nHowever, if all you're after is cleanup after crashing clients, there is a way - each DBus client gets a unique bus-id (for example, :1.693) allocated it by the daemon. When a client requests a file over your DBus API you can record their bus-id, and then watch the NameOwnerChanged signal of org.freedesktop.DBus. This signal has 3 parts - the bus name (which, in the cases we're interested in, will be the unique bus-id), the the new owner's bus-id, and the old owner's bus-id.\nSo if you get a NameOwnerChanged signal with name=\":1.693\", new_owner=\"\", and old_owner=\":1.693\" you know that the client with bus-id :1.693 has disconnected from the bus, and can remove any objects that client was using.\nYou'd want to do this in addition to having clients explicitly telling your service when they're done with a file, of course.\nEdit:\nAs for your global question - what should the API be - I'd suggest that this seems complex enough that your DBus objects should not be the primary API.

I am making a todo like application with indicator support using glade/python/pygtk/glade. I am making a form to save a Todo item. Each todo will belong to 0 or more projects.\nWhen a user enters a project name in a text input field I want it to auto-complete based on existing projects. This widget should behave similarly to the text input when completing the ask a question form on this site (askubuntu.com). Below is a screenshot of what I mean.\nFor example when the user wants to add a todo under the projects \"quickly\" once the user starts typing \"qu*\" it should suggest all available projects that start with \"qu\" (e.g. \"quick\", \"quickly\", \"queue\", \"quack\" etc.). The user may press the down arrow to select the correct option or continue typing. When the user presses spacebar, it should start with a new suggestion.\nIs there a control/widget in pyGTK/quickly that I can use to accomplish this? Bonus points if I can also list a number next to each suggestion with the number of todo items that belong to this project, similar to the screenshot below.\n\n\nA: Here's a simple example:\nfrom gi.repository import Gtk\n\nclass MyExample(Gtk.Window):\n    def __init__(self):\n        Gtk.Window.__init__(self)\n        self.connect(\"delete-event\", Gtk.main_quit)\n\n        liststore = Gtk.ListStore(str)\n        for match in [\"test1\", \"test2\", \"test3\", \"spam\", \"foo\", \"eggs\", \"bar\"]:\n            liststore.append([match])\n\n        completion = Gtk.EntryCompletion()\n        completion.set_model(liststore)\n        completion.set_text_column(0)\n\n        entry = Gtk.Entry()\n        entry.set_completion(completion)\n        self.add(entry)\n        self.show_all()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    app = MyExample()\n    Gtk.main()\n\nYou'll just have to dynamicly fill the liststore with the values you want. Displaying a number next to it can be as trivial as appending it to the string you're adding to the liststore or you can create a second column in it. This all depends on your code and isn't possible to answer, but this should get you going.\nYou can even create most of the above code in Glade if you want.\n", "Q: How can I preserve file modification times when copying to a NAS? I recently installed a Synology DiskStation on my network. I mounted it from an Ubuntu 12.04.1 computer with the Browse Network button in Nautilus 3.4.2. It shows up as afp://randall@DiskStation.local/photo/ in Nautilus.\nSo far, so good. I then uploaded a lot of photos to it, all with modifications times covering several months. When I looked at the directory of photos on the DiskStation, they all had modification times for the moment they were copied, not the modification times on the source computer. So much for sorting them by date on the DiskStation.\nIs there a way to re-copy the files but have their modification date be preserved? Perhaps I mounted the DiskStation the wrong way. Perhaps Nautilus was the wrong tool to use. Any suggestions?\nBTW, I have moved gigabytes of photos to a different NAS (Plextor PX-EH) over SMB/CIFS from Ubuntu 10.04, 10.10, 11.04, and 11.10 with modification times fully preserved. The problem must be with the Synology or some Ubuntu 12.04 software.\n\nA: I believe I have solved the problem. In Ubuntu 12.04, in Nautilus there are two ways to connect to the remote DiskStation NAS. One preserves modification times, one does not.\nIn the menu on the left-hand side of a Nautilus window, the Browse Network... button eventually leads to an AFP (Apple Filing Protocol) connection to the DiskStation, through which neither Nautilus nor cp -p copies preserve modification time. I tried disabling Apple support in the DiskStation, but in that mode the DiskStation wasn't even visible in Browse Network.\nIn Nautilus's File menu there is a Connect to Server... option that offers a host of protocols. I chose Windows, entered my credentials, and connected without trouble. In this mode, modification times are preserved, so I was able to re-copy my photos and have their dates preserved.\nThank you Sergey and david6 for your suggestions. Hopefully people will find this information valuable.\n\nA: Standard cp command has --preserve flag which preserved certain attributes (by default - mode,ownership,timestamps) when copying.\nSo something like this:\ncp -rp /source/photos/folder /destination/photos/folder\n\nshould do the trick in the \"normal\" case. However, the afp:// thing in the URL confuses me - is it Apple Filing Protocol? All bets are off in this case.\nOne think I'd like to add - relying on file modification dates for cataloging your photos is very fragile. This is what image metadata (EXIF etc.) is for. Or, at least, just put them in directories according to their shooting date: photos/2012/12/05 etc.\n\nA: This is the classic push/pull problem, for remote copy.\nThe recipient host is not honouring the date-stamp of the received files. \nNautilus has this same fault, from 10.04 LTS through 12.10 ..\nThis is solved (for Nautilus), when copying between two Ubuntu hosts, by always copying from the remote-host (source) to the local-host (recipient). (AKA 'PULL')\n\nYour problem is with the NAS box, and not with Ubuntu.\nYou need it to honour the date-stamp of received files (by default).\nAre you using NFS (Linux) or CIFS (Windows) for file sharing?\n\nA: Turns out that preserving timestamps for files and directories is still a problem in 2019! I was copying files from an Ubuntu 16 machine to an Ubuntu 18 one over SFTP, using Nautilus on the Ubuntu 18, and all files had the current timestamp, but directories had the original timestamps. Other tools failed as well:\n\n\n*\n\n*BeyondCompare did not preserve the timestamps of directories\n\n*DoubleCommander gave random errors throughout the copying process (no other tool did that; both machines use SSDs and are on the local Wi-Fi)\n\n*Midnight Commander lost the timestamps for both files and directories\n\n\nWhat did work was to mount the remote filesystem using sshfs:\n$ sudo mkdir /mnt/remote-machine\n$ sudo sshfs -o allow_other,default_permissions dandv@10.15.x.x:/ /mnt/remote-machine\n$ cp -rp /mnt/remote-machine/path/to/files ./\n$ # ... or use another file manager\n\nCopying from the mounted path also enabled Midnight Commander to preserve the timestamps (but didn't help BeyondCompare).\n\nA: To solve this issue on the client side, try specifying the protocol explicitly in mount options.\nFrom man mount.cifs:\n       vers=\n           SMB protocol version.

I want to join two image files in Ubuntu 12.04.  Is there any way I can accomplish this?\nIs there any utility for joining image files, perhaps something like MS-Paint in Ubuntu?\n\nA: You can use imagemagick to do this. (I am using it as well.) \nFirst install it: sudo apt-get install imagemagick\nAfter that look here for usage, you will find a lot of examples. The best is that you can use it from command line (integrate within a script for example).\n\nA: As a complement to the other answer on imagemagick and  considering the need for a GUI.\nInspired by this post saying that ImageMagick has command line tool named convert to merge images. To join images horizontally (in alphabetical order):\nconvert +append *.png out.png \n\nTo stack images vertically:\nconvert -append *.png out.png\n\nThat should be run in a terminal into the folder containing png files to join them all.\n\nA GUI for that would be:\na file manager context menu to join selected images.\nAn easy way when it comes to that is Thunar's custom actions:\nTo join selected images vertically (into one png file, in alphabetical order, no matter their extension) add this custom action ('Edit - Configure custom actions'):\nconvert -append %F joined-vertical.png\n\nTo join horizontally:\nconvert +append %F joined-horizontal.png\n\nThe same commands can be used in a .desktop file in /.local/share/file-manager/actions which adds a context menu for Nautilus and/or PCManFM.\nExample for vertical join:\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Action\nName=Join images (vertically)\nProfiles=profile-zero;\nTargetLocation=true\nIcon=gthumb\n\n[X-Action-Profile profile-zero]\nBasenames=image/*;*;\nExec=convert -append %F joined-image.png\nName[en_US]=Default profile\nName[en]=Default profile\nName[C]=Default profile\n\n\nA: \"join two images\" is a quite vague description, but I'm sure you can do what you want with Gimp.

Everyone who was used to Windows can imagine what symlinks are and how they're used. On the other hand, the hard link concept is foreign to Windows (am I correct?).\nI would like to know what are the typical uses to hard links in Linux. I've already seen different posts describing the difference in how they work. What I'm asking is what are some typical situations when a user would be better off using hard links instead of symlinks?\n\nA: I use a hard link where I need a single file in two or more places, I predict that one day I'll want to delete one of the locations, and I may forget that I have a link to the file. This prevents me from ending up with a symbolic link to a file that no longer exists.\nClarification:\nA file name is, in fact, a hard link to the file. Thus, every file has at least one hard link, being what we normally think of as \"the\" file name. When you delete a file, in fact you are removing its hard link (hence the name \"remove\", i.e. rm, rather than \"delete\"). When a file has its last hard link removed, the system also deletes the file.\n\nA: Hard links allow ... \n\n\n*\n\n*a single executable to have more than one name. \nExample: \nls -l /bin | grep -v ' 1 ' | sort will list the ones in /bin for you.

Regardless of whether I then click \"Forget password immediately\" or \"Remember password until you logout\", though, I find that Ubuntu does not lock the drives when I log out.

I know a full fledged app isn't available for Linux, but would like to know about apps that specialize in the same tasks that Coda offers.\nI plan on switching to Vim for code editing, I'm extremely proficient and will install the Janus plugin and be good to go for editing code.\nOne thing that makes editing on Coda so amazing is its extremely good at SFTP, you can drag and drop files and/or folders from your local drive to the server. Also, you can edit code directly on the server. The problem here, is that using Vim I don't know of a way to edit code on a remote server, while using my own Vim settings and plugins. To solve this, I would like to know of a good SFTP client OR a good SFTP CLI. A CLI that could synchronize your files after a file has been modified would be perfect, but not necessary.\nNow, one of the biggest and best features of Coda is its ability to view your databases. You get to create a database, create tables, add stuff, delete stuff and view the contents of the table (all this without writing a single SQL statement). I will admit that databases are my weak point, but is a very important part of my job. If there is a tool that specializes in databases would be perfect. I wouldn't prefer to use the command line for database stuff, but if there is a CLI for databases that I'm missing could potentially be useful.\nSo I guess I'm asking for two things. A tool that makes databases easier to visualize and a tool that assists in pushing my local code to a server.\n\nA: I have never used Coda, but if you are looking for a good and very extensible editor I can recomend SublimeText2.  The good thing about it is that it is cross platform (Win,Mac,Linux), so you can have the same dev setup no matter what OS you are using.  On top it is extendeable using Python, so it is very easy to write your own plugins.\nSome other Editors I have used:\n\n\n*\n\n*BlueFish\n\n*Geany\n\n*Gedit/Gmate\n\n\nthese are the ones I know about, but I am sure there are hundreds more options.\n", "Q: How to run Wayland/Weston?

Once you run the installer, it will ask you where to install the software. Provide different paths for the different versions.\nYou can create soft-links from your desktop to the software executables for easy access.\nIn your case, since you have gimp 2.8 installed, get the installer for 2.6 and/or 2.4, and then install as mentioned above.\n", "Q: free basic compiler error 23: File not found, libsupc++.a I am trying to compile a simple a hello word QBASIC program in ubutu 12.04. downloaded and installed as instructed here. http://www.freebasic.net/get \nprint \"hello word\"\n\nI compiled it.\n fbc hello.bas\n\nBut I got the following error.\nhello.bas() error 23: File not found, libsupc++.a \nld: cannot find -lncurses\nld: cannot find -lsupc++\n\nA: You need to install additional packages.

I'd like to use my Dropbox account to backup my \"Documents\" folder, without running the risk of deleting something on Dropbox and my files being deleted on my computer. Is there any way to do this?\n\nA: You could turn Documents into a symbolic link that points to Dropbox, or use a 'backup' program like rsync to mirror the files. \n\nA: First off, you should be aware that you can recover deleted files from Dropbox. Also, Dropbox keeps a version history of your files. So you don't need to worry about accidentally deleting files from your Dropbox folder.\n\nBacking up to your Dropbox folder is easy. Just use any back up tool, and set the destination to your Dropbox folder.\nHere's how to do it with Ubuntu's Backup tool  that comes with Ubuntu by default:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch \"Backup\".\n\n*Click the \"Storage\" tab.\n\n*Under Backup location, choose your Dropbox folder.\n\n\nYou can also use other backup tools like rsync .\n\nAnother method to back up files automatically is to create a symlink in your Dropbox directory, pointing to directories you want to back up.\nFor example, this will include your Documents folder in your Dropbox storage automatically:\ncd ~/Dropbox\nln -s ~/Documents Documents\n\n", "Q: How to simulate a USB plug? I have an app that implements some automations when an USB key is plugged.\nWhile developing, I have to test it in a specific environment (derivative from Debian Squeeze).\nThe app subscribe to HAL events via DBUS.\nThe problem is: my desk is on the third floor while my test machines are in the basement.\nI would really like to have a way to simulate a USB plug.\n\n\n*\n\n*usbip does not work on Ubuntu.\n\n*I can't manage to use the g_mass_storage module on Ubuntu (I lack the dummy_hcd module) and in Debian.\n\n\nMaybe it is possible to simulate a dbus call?\nMy work station is on Ubuntu 12.04.\n\nA: I found another solution that suited me.\nIn fact I realised that I did not really need to simulate an USB drive, but rather any type of storage device (my app watches HAL or UDisks for \"DeviceAdded\" events).\nSo I did the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*create a filesytem image, for example with the \"virt-make-fs\" command\nsudo virt-make-fs --type=ntfs -- fs.tar.gz fs-test.img\n\n*upload the img file on the test machine\n\n*setup the image as a loop device: sudo losetup /dev/loop0 fs-test.img\nAnd that's it, UDisks just triggered the \"DeviceAdded\" DBus event!\n(however, HAL does not trigger anything in this case, so it's a good opportunity to drop it since it is deprecated)\nIf you want, you can manually mount the image with something like sudo mount /dev/loop0 /mnt/fs.\nIf you need to use pmount, don't forget to add /dev/loop0 to /etc/pmount.allow.\nTo unset the loop device, just use sudo losetup -d /dev/loop0.\n", "Q: Editing GRUB2 listing and background-image? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow can I get some nice eye candy themes for Grub? \n\nIm using ubuntu 12.10.Is that possible to list only ubuntu loader and windows7 loader in GRUB2?\nWith a Image background or something theme that will not damage boot?\nCan you provide some tutorials.\nOr something tool/application to edit grub easily with matching dynamic image input\n\nA: You could try Grub Customizer.\n\nGrub Customizer is a graphical interface to configure the GRUB2/BURG\n  settings and menu entries\n\nFeatures:\n\n\n*\n\n*move, remove or rename menuentries (they stey updatable by update-grub)\n\n*edit the contents of menuentries or create new ones (internally it edits the 40_custom)\n\n*support for GRUB2 and BURG\n\n*reinstallation of the bootloader to MBR\n\n*settings like default operating system, kernel params, background image and text colors etc.\n\n*changing the installed operating system by running on a live cd\n\n\nReferences:\nLaunchpad Project Link\n", "Q: user access on all computers in the Network with his settings loaded via server I have ubuntu 12.04 installed on three computers.

You will find a guide here.\nThe workstations will mount the home directories from the server; the home directories (/home/user etc.) contain all usual configuration files.\nNFS has some drawbacks, and there are alternatives However, if you work within a local LAN, preferably behind a NAT / firewall, NFS will give you great performance at the cost of (relatively) little configuration.\n", "Q: I can't compile a C++ program with the g++ command If I try compiling my C++ source file by the following command:\ng++ a.cpp\n\nit outputs:\nThe program 'g++' can be found in the following packages:\n * g++\n * pentium builder\n\ntry:\nsudo apt-get intsall <<a>selected package>\n\nHowever, if I run the suggested command (sudo apt-get install g++), it shows that everything is already installed.\nSo, basically, how do I compile a simple C++ program in Ubuntu 12.04?\n\nA: Try this\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install build-essential\n", "Q: How to use multiple Python versions on the same System?

It looks like you'll have to re-install apt and then force the system to re-install the apps that it thinks it can.  \n\nA: Here error occured due to lack of dependancies, dpkg -i *.deb is dangerous If necessory dependancies are not satisfied, So I would like to suggest local repository or an aptoncd image to use such debs\n\nA: I'll answer you in simple example,\nsuppose appA have dependencies depA1v1.1 and depA2v1.5\nsuppose appB have dependencies depB1v1.3 and depA2V1.3\nNow appA is install in Pc#1 and appB installed in PC#2.\nWhen you just take a copy of all *.deb from PC#1 /var/cache/apt/archives and move it to PC#2 and then you make dpkg -i *.deb. What happens?\nNow in PC#2 you would have installed appA correctly but appB would have problems, why then?\nsimply because you have incompatible dependency since depA2 is of version 1.5 now not 1.3 as needed.\nHope this explains the problem, now then how could I  use those archives?! \n\n\n*\n\n*Either you have to take care of your dependencies and check whether those *.debs would make problems for your system and this is exhausting job\n\n*Or, you should always be same in the two hosts, so whenever you update PC#1 you should take the *.deb to PC#2 and do the same update, so the two hosts would always be synced with respect to app versions.\n\n\nHint: A  handy use of those debs is just copy them from Pc#1 to PC#2 and move them to /var/cache/apt/archives in Pc#2.\nNow try to install apps you want from these archives using regular apt-get and not dpkg, so apt-get tries to resolve dependencies from those archives if founded and check updates, so if there is no new update on the repositories, then it would use the .deb founded in the path  /var/cache/apt/archives\n", "Q: Prevent certain files from being moved or deleted by a user There are some important files that I might delete by accident (if I'm not careful), and I need to ensure that these files cannot be deleted or moved.

Also, is it possible to prevent files from being moved or deleted by non-root users?\n\nA: Also: sudo chattr +i <file> is a good trick.

At work my group currently use self maintained network printers. We also run our own self contained Linux network for some members of the group. It all works beautifully. The management has decided that it will be more efficient and sustainable for everybody to use centrally maintained printers. This brings us a number of useful features such as being able to submit a print job and then pick it at any printer we want. The problem is that printing will be tied into the central authentication system, which we don't use.\nIt turns out that we don't actually have to make use of the authentication as such, we just need to make sure that the username a print job is submitted under has the correct username - otherwise you can't pick it up. We could change all of the username and home directories for all of our users to match the centrally managed ones, but understandably we'd prefer not to do that. If we can remap our usernames to the centrally managed ones for printing then everything should just work.\nWe're currently using cups for our printing needs and as far as I can tell it doesn't support any form of username remapping. Is this correct? I do know that Samba supports username remapping, but I'm not sure if it would work in this configuration. We need:\n\n\n*\n\n*local username print (to our server if necessary) -> username remapping to central username -> print job sent to print service.\n\n\nCan anybody suggest how we might achieve this?\n\nA: I have now solved this problem. I've added the real printer as normal, then created a new cups backend script called /usr/lib/cups/backend/remap :\n#!/bin/bash\n\nif [ \"$#\" == \"0\" ]; then\n    echo \"network remap \\\"Unknown\\\" \\\"Username remap backend\\\"\"\n    exit 0\nfi\n\nDEVICE_URI=$(echo ${DEVICE_URI} | sed -e \"s/^remap/ipp/\")\nFINAL_CONTENT_TYPE=\"application/vnd.cups-postscript\"\nPPD=\"<path to real printer ppd>\"\nPRINTER=\"<real printer name>\"\nJOBNUM=$1\nUSER=$(ypmatch $2 usermap)\nif [ \"$?\" == \"1\" ]; then\n    exit 1\nfi\nJOBTITLE=$3\nCOPIES=$4\nshift\nshift\nshift\nshift\ncat | /usr/lib/cups/backend/ipp ${JOBNUM} ${USER} \"${JOBTITLE}\" ${COPIES} \"$@\"\nexit $?\n\nI've then added a new fake printer using this backend. The script assumes your fake printer and real printer have the same location but different protocol, so for example:\n\n\n*\n\n*remap://server:631/printers/printer_name\n\n*ipp://server:631/printers/printer_name\n\n\nIt replaces the \"remap\" with \"http\" in the DEVICE_URI environment variable, updates some other environment variables, looks up the mapped user (in this case based on a custom NIS map) and runs the job on the real printer using the ipp backend but with the updated username.\nCups backends expect arguments as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*$1: CUPS job ID\n\n*$2: user name\n\n*$3: job title\n\n*$4: number of requested copies\n\n*$5: print job options\n\n*$6: print job file (with path)\n\n\nIf $6 is empty, it expects input from stdin.\n", "Q: Lenovo W520 back usb port not working The usb port in the back of my laptop (on the right side when viewed from using perspective) is not working.\nDoes anybody know if we can get this port working, and what the port number is.\nHere is my lsusb, if it can help.\n% lsusb\nBus 001 Device 002: ID 8087:0024 Intel Corp.

I am using Ubuntu 12.10 and want to run a set of commands in the terminal, and from what i see in the instructions, these commands each start on a new line. I don't know how to do this in the terminal. I can't find what key to press to do the carriage-return to the next line.\n\nA: You can press the ENTER key after each line and if the command is not terminated (mutiline commands like for loops for example), the terminal will wait for you to enter the rest of the command. If the command is terminated, it will be executed and you enter next command after, no problem.\nIf you are copying the commands from a tutorial, you can copy the whole group of commands and paste it directly in the terminal and it will work.\n\nA: As Web-E explains the most direct way to do what you want with two different commands, I thought I'd show that there are a number of ways to execute multiple commands or to continue commands onto another line without immediately executing them.\nContinuing long commands:\n1) The most common way to construct one long command is to enter your commands, then use a backslash \\, press return, and then Bash will provide another prompt for you instead of executing the command. This secondary prompt is called PS2 and waits for your input:\nfind /home/mike/Downloads -type f -iname '*.jpg' \\\n> \n\nYou can keep on adding backslashes and pressing return as long as you want, as long as you think the overall command will make sense.\nYou can cancel this secondary prompt with the usual Ctrl+C.\n2) Bash recognises some commands such as for loops (for i in....) and the prompt will appear immediately; just as it will if you miss a quotation mark off a command:\napt-cache search 'libgimp*\n> \n\nMultiple Commands:\n3) As Lxnslck notes, you can separate commands with semicolons:\nwhich vlc; whereis vlc\n\n/usr/bin/vlc\nvlc: /usr/bin/vlc /etc/vlc /usr/lib/vlc /usr/bin/X11/vlc /usr/share/vlc /usr/share/man/man1/vlc.1.gz\n\n4) Or you can use the ampersand && to join two commands:\n./configure && make\n\n\nA: The commands you see in each line are to be executed one by one. \nSo after entering a line, press enter to execute then execute next command.\nExample:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nThese are two commands to be executed one by one.\nTo execute at once it will be like sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade (there are other methods also), but these thing doesn't require generally . So don't worry. Type one line and press enter it will do it's job.\n\nA: When it's a set of commands you expect to be using more than once, you should put them in a bash script file. For instance,\nxrandr --newmode \"1280x960_80.00\" 139.25  1280 1368 1504 1728  960 963 967 1008 -hsync +vsync\nxrandr --verbose --addmode VGA1 \"1280x960_80.00\"\nxrandr --output HDMI1 --off --output LVDS1 --mode 1366x768 --pos 1280x512 --rotate normal --output DP1 --off --output VGA1 --mode \"1280x960_80.00\" --pos 0x0 --rotate normal\nsleep 3\nxfce4-panel -r\n\nis nothing you'd like to type ever again, but I happen to need this particular sequence of commands very often. So it goes in a file called 1280x980-2head.sh, you can create that with any editor of your choice. To make that script executable, you put the line #!/bin/bash in front of everything (a shebang), and set the execution-permission: chmod +x 1280x980-2head.sh. Then, just typing ./128<tab> (auto-completion) and <enter> executes all the commands.\n\nA: You can put everything in brackets; for example:\n(sudo add-apt-repository ppa:foo/bar\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install my-package)\n\nThe commands will be executed one after the other in a sub-shell.\nIf you don't want them to be executed in a sub-shell, you can put a semicolon between a command and the other; for example:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:foo/bar; sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install my-package\n\nInstead, if you put \"&&\" between each commands, the command that follows the \"&&\" will be executed only if the previous command has finished with no error, so you don't have to use it to concatenate commands; use semicolons instead. Conversely, if you put \"||\", the following command will be executed only if the first one exits with an error. Example: (the \"which\" command checks if a program exists, and if doesn't exits with an error)\nwhich apt-get && echo \"No error\" || echo \"Error\"    # Will print \"No error\"\nwhich jdhdsd && echo \"No error\" || echo \"Error\"  # Will print \"Error\"\n\n\nA: Back slash (\\) and Enter is what you're looking for.\nExample:\nShell:> command --param1 paramValue \\\n--param2 paramValue \\\n--param3 paramValue \\\n\nWhen you press 'enter' after a '\\' it will continue the command, but on a new line.\n", "Q: I can't find a file in ubuntu 12.04 i used the code in terminal\nsudo mv filename.jpg /usr/share/backgrounds\n\nbut when i check there, it is missing, also can't find in /home\n\nA: if you typed the command as above do this\nls -l /usr/share\n\nyou may have 2 backgrounds, one being a directory and the other being the jpg having been renamed to backgrounds without a file extension.\n", "Q: how to get rid of \"open in terminal\" choise in Thunar \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to customize files context menu in Xubuntu XFCE Thunar file manager? \n\nI want to open a folder in a launcher menu (Home), say \"downloads\". I select it and then a submenu emerges with two choises: uppermost \"downloads\",and behind it \"open in terminal\". How can I get rid of that submenu and just get into \"downloads\"? one click-> downloads (no submenues)\n\nA: As you are using Thunar, I suppose you are using xfce (or xubuntu) so this behavior is when you open thunar from the launcher panel using Directory Menu launcher. In the panel menu, you can add 2 different launchers for Thunar, one with the additional submenu you have (called Directory Menu) and the other (called Locals) without the additional submenu (the way you want). You can edit your panel and change the Directory Menu launcher to Locals launcher.\nObs: not sure of the English names of the launchers... may be something similar but not exact.\n", "Q: Automatically 'select all' in browser address/search bars Is it possible to automatically 'select all' when I left click in a browser address/search bar.\nI know it's only one more click by right clicking and then choosing 'select all' and I probably sound a bit fussy but it's feature I like.\nI'm using Ubuntu 12.10 64bit, Chrome and Firefox\nThanks in advance.\nAs an update, Chrome now does this automatically\n\nA: For anyone interested I have found an answer for this, if only in Firefox.\nIn Firefox url bar type\n\nabout:config\n\nAfter heeding the \"Here be Dragons\" warning either search for or scroll to\nbrowser.urlbar.doubleClickSelectsAll\n\nand\nbrowser.urlbar.clickSelectsAll\n\nDouble click to toggle.\nSet browser.urlbar.doubleClickSelectsAll to false\nand set browser.urlbar.clickSelectsAll to true\n\nThis will work in the url bar but not the search bar, I tend to use the url bar for search also so it wont overly bother me.\n\nA: An alternative option is to double click anywhere in the address bar, which will automatically seleect the entire closest word.

How can I issue apt upgrades without automatically stopping/starting daemons? I'd like to manually restart services.\nTo cite a specific example:\nI'll revisit a long-running machine and run sudo apt-get update && time sudo apt-get dist-upgrade. This is a very straight-forward means of seeing all available upgrades, followed by a simple Enter keypress to get the systems fully patched.\nIf I see postgresql-9.1 in the upgrade list, I abort the upgrade. In that case, apt would stop the service early in the process, apply several non-critical operations, then restart the service much later. A routine upgrade could cause minutes of downtime.\nI'd like to say \"yes\" to the upgrade to get all patches applied, then manually restart the service at a convenient time.\n\nA: \nI'd like to say \"yes\" to the upgrade to get all patches applied, then\n  manually restart the service at a convenient time.\n\nYou can't do this in the general case, sorry. Even if a service is not restarted, packages don't provide any assurance that upgrades without service restarts won't break things (eg. anything dynamically loaded, like modules).\nIf you want a stable system, you should either hold back from upgrading a package, or upgrade it fully, complete with a service restart.\nI can't really point to a credible source here, since I can't prove a negative. Debian policy is relevant here; it simply does not provide the guarantee that you are looking for. According to Debian policy, a package's functionality is not required to work until the postinst has finished successfully. So we can infer that if the postinst includes a mandatory service restart, then it needs to happen.\nSome other mechanisms that might help you:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use apt-get --download-only upgrade to download updates in advance. \n\n*Hold specific packages back from upgrades.\n\n*Look into \"high availability\", so that servers can be upgraded in turn with no interruption to service. With Postgres, this would probably involve some kind of replicated configuration.\n\n\nA: You can prevent service restarts with the Debian policy layer which works on Ubuntu as well.\nExample:\nCreate a file named /usr/sbin/policy-rc.d with following content (don't forget to make the file executable):\n#!/bin/sh\n\nexit 101\n\nNo service¹ would be automatically started/stopped/restarted anymore.\nSee /usr/share/doc/sysv-rc/README.policy-rc.d.gz for details and how to adjust it to just ignore a single service.\n1. as long as the installation scripts follow the Debian guidelines and use invoke-rc.d for service restarts\n\nA: There is CLI based tool named as sysv-rc-conf .

And I mean everything, like it was on the original disk (from permissions to installed apps, configs, paths).\nI don't really trust GUI's to do this kind of job so I'm avoiding anything from the store.\n\nA: After rsync, you need to install grub on the drive, and fix /etc/fstab to point to the new volume uuid ( see blkid ), then chroot into the drive and run update-grub to update grub.cfg with the new uuid, then make sure these changes do not get reversed by any future rsyncs you do.\nAs an alternative, you could just install grub and rsync away, and whenever you actually need to boot the system, press e at the grub menu to edit the entry, and manually fix the root= argument to point to the other disk instead of the original.\nMore specifically:\n#assuming /target is where you have the new drive you rsynced to\n# is mounted, and you are running as root ( sudo -s )\n#bind mount needed run time filesystems into /target\nfor f in sys dev proc dev/pts run ; do mount --bind /$f /target/$f\n#chroot into target\nchroot /target\n#install and update grub ( assuming bios boot, not EFI )\ndpkg-reconfigure grub-pc\n#at the prompt, choose to install grub to the new disk\n\n", "Q: Endless loop when booting from a Ubuntu usb disk I'd like to install Ubuntu on a pavilion g6 2255 but unfortunately the computer enters an endless loop during boot. What I observe is:\n\n\n*\n\n*the screen is switched off\n\n*a few seconds later, the screen is switched on but remains blank and dark\n\n*repeat from step 1\n\n\nI reproduced these steps with Ubuntu 12.10 and 12.04 both in 32 and 64 bits either from a CD or a usb key. I also tried to boot from a live usb key with the same results. My usb key  works fine as I can boot from it with another computer.\nWhat can I do to overcome this bootloop? I read about setting modset=0 in the boot config file, in order to circumvent the lack of drivers for some recent graphical cards, but I'm not certain that would resolve my boot loop problem\nEdit\nAs asked in the comment beneath, no text gets printed during the process I described. Actually I don't even believe this problem is related to Ubuntu since when I press escape during step 2, I can almost access the computer boot/bios menu. But the computer \"runs short of time\" and reboots.\nIn order to check if it was Ubuntu related my plan was to boot from some other USB-based unix both with my old computer (that actually boots Ubuntu) and with my new HP pavilion g6 2255, then compare. As I have installed OSX mountain lion on my old Mac today (a third computer) via USB, I decided to use it as a test specimen. Here are the results :\n\n\n*\n\n*Old PC : nothing, just an underscore prompt blinking on the screen (which was to be expected since it is amd-based).\n\n*HP pavilion : the boot loop I described above\n\n\nOn this basis, I decided it wasn't Ubuntu related and tried to toggle the settings that seemed relevant in the bios, one by one. I first changed the way USB behaves during boot and set the computer to recognize USB as 2.0 during pre-os stage then enable USB 3.0 afterwards. The boot loop was still there.\nThen I enabled legacy support which is useful for some \"old\" OS then booted on the osx dongle. I observed the same blank but switched-on screen as in step 2 but without the loop.\nThat's when I decided to try to boot from a Ubuntu install disc, with the hope that I had overcome the boot loop problem and that now osx was the problem (which is probably to be expected since this is a 100% legit osx version, not something to build hackintoshes).\nAnd that's when I got that epic result : after having inserted the disc and forced the computer to reboot it turned out I'm not even able to switch my computer on anymore. I press the power button and absolutely nothing happens, just like if I was trying to power on a brick.\nSo I guess I solved the problem from above but I think I need some more help (I'm actually laughing as I write this) : I will return this god forsaken time abyss PC to the store.\nIs it legit/legal/allowed/in the scope of my warranty to do what I have done? I mean trying to boot on a osx USB stick with no intent of installing it whatsoever? How should I act? Tell them the truth or act like a fool that just wanted to install Ubuntu on his laptop?\n\nA: I'd have to say that you should be fine.\nBut maybe avoid mentioning that you tried to boot OSX.\nAll you have attempted to do is boot your computer to a Unix based operating system from an Optical and Solid state disk, failed to actually modify your configuration, and ended up with a non-functional computer.\nYou've done nothing that should cause a problem.\nThe reboot loop does seem to be a common issue on HP laptops, my HP Envy is doing the same when I try and boot to an Ubuntu flash drive.\n\nA: If you get a BIOS boot loop on an HP device, you may have to set the device to manually boot via an EFI file called Grub on your Ubuntu installation. HP secure boot seems to ignore Ubuntu EFI files, unless you manually specify them. You can first test that you can boot by going into the HP OS Boot Manager (Pressing ESC once during boot loop) and selecting Ubuntu.\nIf that works, and you want to have this be the default, you'll need to prioritise \"Custom Boot\" in the boot priorirty list as the first option, and then manually type out the EFI path as follows:\n\\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi\n^ This cryptic path can be found via the Boot via EFI File menu option, in case it differs for your device.\nEDIT: This answer explains it in more detail: https://askubuntu.com/a/624964/114641\n\nA: Im not sure if this is the problem you are having but I have more than ones experienced that my usb3 flash drive that can install windows or macOS, does not work with linux even on the same computer. The installation starts but crashes during installation.\nThe solution for me was to use a USB2 flashdrive instead. \n\nA: My G6 did the same thing. To turn the computer back on, just keep holding the power button. It worked for me at least when I was trying to install Windows 7. Good luck!\n", "Q: How to see the localhost traffic details?

What should i use? and is it possible to see all the ip address which has sent the request? i am using xampp server. thank you.\n\nA: What you want to see should be already getting logged in the Apache logs. They already include the source IP address of each request, and several other pieces of information.\nIf you're using xampp I think the logs are kept in /opt/lampp/logs/. The requests are logged in access_log, or ssl_request_log if you're using SSL. The errors go to error_log.\nTo see a log in real time you could use:\ntail -f /opt/lampp/logs/access_log\n\n(Use Ctrl+C to stop it)\nOr, you could see more than one log at a time, using multitail.\nFirst, install multitail if it's not installed already:\nsudo apt-get install multitail\n\nThen:\nmultitail /opt/lampp/logs/access_log /opt/lampp/logs/error_log\n\n(Press q to close it)\nYou can pass it whatever logs you want to watch.\n\nIf what you need is lower-level information, then there are several other choices, like Wireshark, nmap/zenmap, tcpdump.

A while ago I received a PDF file that was digitally signed. \nThe Document Viewer (Evince) shows me that the digital signature was not validated.\nHow do I add the file's digital signature to evince so that the warning disappears?\n\nA: Unfortunately, you can't (now on Gitlab) do this at the minute with the standard version of evince, as a developer explained on the official mailing lists:\n\nThis feature isn't implemented in Evince, mainly because isn't supported\nby poppler, the underlying library for PDF support.\n\nThis is indeed the main point; you would need to patch poppler with the digital signature support as well as evince.\nHowever, there is a interesting project in progress to provide just the functionality you want; the details are explained on this github page entitled 'evince signatures', where all the patches are available.\nAs well as on the github page, there is more information on the project on this site; it is clear they hope to integrate it upstream in the future. The developers note that\n\nthe most used software for reading pdf documents on Windows (Acrobat Reader) has support for showing and validate signatures in pdf documents. On modern Linux desktops that doesn't yet exist and that's the purpose of this project, change Evince document viewer (default gnome pdf reader) to add those features.\n\nSo, you can experiment with the github development code if you wish, but it may not be a good idea to patch poppler as other programs depend on it; however, it is likely that the digital signatures feature will be available soon if it is integrated upstream. Judging by the evince screenshots for a valid and invalid signature the patches do seem to be enabling just the features you are interested in.\n", "Q: Why gwibber-service keeps poping up even if I deleted Gwibber?

I know it can be done on startup, obviously, but the issue in this case is that the backlight of my laptop seems to reset every time it wakes up from sleep, and I'd ideally like to have a script take care of turning it down to a reasonable level instead of having to type it in manually every time.\n\nA: This is not really a separate independent answer but since I'm unable to comment (due to reputation restriction) I'd just like to add an important supplement to mfisch's answer which also worked for me.\nPlease note that the HOME and PATH (and quite possibly other environmental variables) will probably not be the same as your regular shell environment. I had problems with mfisch's solution not seeming to work for the scripts I needed to execute on resume but it turned out that it was my scripts at fault since they were expecting HOME to be set to my user directory (I'm a single user on my system) and for PATH to include /usr/local/bin, and at the point of resume, neither of this is guaranteed (and in the case of HOME, possibly inadvisable). So you may have to adapt your scripts/programs to not depend on those env-vars...\n\nA: In 15.04, Vivid, you need to place your scripts in:\n/lib/systemd/system-sleep/\n\nAn example script based on one from the Arch wiki  (systemd sleep Hooks):\n#!/bin/sh\ncase $1/$2 in\n  pre/*)\n    echo \"Going to $2...\"\n    # Place your pre suspend commands here, or `exit 0` if no pre suspend action required\n    ;;\n  post/*)\n    echo \"Waking up from $2...\"\n    # Place your post suspend (resume) commands here, or `exit 0` if no post suspend action required\n    ;;\nesac\n\nDont forget to make your script executable!\nsudo chmod a+x /lib/systemd/system-sleep/your-script\n\nSee man systemd-sleep for more details.\nThere is no need for sudo as your script will be run as root.\nnote: the Arch wiki link on the subject (systemd sleep hooks) states (incorrectly for 15.04) that you should place your scripts in /usr/lib/systemd/system-sleep/, but this is will not work in Ubuntu 15.04. Place your scripts in /lib/systemd/system-sleep/ if you're running 15.04.\n\nA: pm-utils provides a bunch of scripts that run on sleep/resume, you could add your script there, but you'll need to be careful as screwing up will likely break resume.  Look in /usr/lib/pm-utils/sleep.d, that's where the scripts are, you can look at the script called 95led as it's quite simple and will be a good model to start with.\n95led provides cases for hibernate/suspend and thaw/resume, if you only want resume, you'd write your script like this:\n#!/bin/sh\n\ncase \"$1\" in\n    resume)\n        echo \"hey I just got resumed!\"\n        run_some_command\nesac\n\nYour script should probably run last, so make sure it shows up last in the directory, maybe name it 99ZZZ_myscript or something.  Again, if you're not sure what you're doing here, I wouldn't mess with it. You may end up breaking suspend/resume.

Need to know a way to fix this, to quit Windows 7 for ever.\n\nA: Well, after messing up with my system, i reinstalled ubuntu and i solved this way.\nRight after installation, from the terminal:\nsudo-apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade. \n\nRestart your system and then install Synaptic:\nsudo apt-get install synaptic\n\nAfter that, open Synaptic and click on the bottom left \"Personal filter\" and on the top left you see \"Missing Reccomended\" (or viceversa). Click on that and then on the right install the linux version 3.5.0-18...click on that and choose \"install\", in the next windows  click on \"YES\" (these are the dependencies). When it's done, close synaptic, open the terminal and:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current nvidia-settings\n\nRestart\nI hope it helps. It did it for my GTS450 Nvidia video card.\n", "Q: Windows backup in Ubuntu I am trying to copy the c:\\Users folder from a Windows 7 Installation for a backup under Ubuntu 12.04 Live CD.  The file transfer seems to be calculating way more info than there actually is in the folder.  I am assuming this is do to the \"shortcuts\" in Windows.  It seems to want to copy every shortcut as an full fledged directory.  Is there some other way of doing this easily? Drag in drop in Nautilus?\n\nA: Selective copying would be easier in that you only copy folders such as Documents, Movies, Photos etc. over to your Ubuntu partition...  Windows will see shortcuts as a small link file whereas Ubuntu/Linux has it's own method called symbolic links so it may treat Windows' links as a complete directory in itself...\n", "Q: LibreOffice Command Line Conversion - No Output File? I am using LibreOffice installed on my Linux box and I seem to be having a weird problem in that the conversion seems to be taking place, and there seem to be no errors, but there is no output file in the specified output directory.\nHere is an example of the command I am using:\n/opt/libreoffice3.6/program/soffice --headless --invisible --convert-to pdf /dir/file.pptx --outdir /dir\n\nAnd here is the result of that command:\nconvert /dir/file.pptx -> /dir/file.pdf using impress_pdf_Export\n\nBut the problem is that after running the conversion /dir/file.pdf does not exist.\nI tried a doc file and the command worked, and saved properly. Even though the conversion seems to be taking place with the pptx file, it does not seem to save it anywhere, oddly.\nDo any of you have any suggestions?\n\nA: I use this command and it work properly:\nlibreoffice --headless --invisible --convert-to pdf --outdir ~/dir  ~/dir/file_to_convert.pptx\n\nBut if you can convert a .doc file, you should be able to do the same with .pptx file. It's odd... \n\nA: As noted in a comment to OP, it is vital that no instance of LibreOffice is running.\nWhen I was attempting to do a soffice conversion, I hadn't run LibO at all, so I thought this wasn't my problem. However, on checking Task Manager, it showed \"soffice quick-start\" running, and this was preventing the conversion.\nSo it seems this old bug is still present in latest LibO (I'm running v. 5.1.1.2 under Ubuntu 14.04 LTS), and it's worth being aware of it given the silent \"quick-start\" instance of soffice.\n", "Q: FTP Changes file permisions I am trying to make changes to my website over ftp but when I save any files it changes the permissions and owner to my username. I can edit files in the same folder trough samba without changing the permissions. I really don't understand how the permissions for the /var/www folder work and I'm pulling my hair out trying to get it to work. I have recently made changes to the permissions of the /var/www directory (following this guide) so I could modify files in the www root. Right now I have the entire contents of /var/www set as -rwxrwxr-x 1 www-data www-data  but when I change a file over ftp it becomes -rw------- 1 akbkuku  akbkuku, akbkuku being my username. I am using vsftpd as the server, and I login with my normal user.\nHow do I make it leave to permissions alone?\nAt this point I'll even take a way yo reset all the permission back to stock and I'll just never modify files in the web root. \n\nA: The settings depend on which FTP client you are using.  Also to some extent the FTP server you are connecting to.  \nUsually, from the ftp command line,you can \n\n\n*\n\n*set your umask for the session, or\n\n*change the permissions on files/directories that you own.\n\n\nIf you want to be sure that the website sees your files, make sure they are WORLD readable (and directories have RX bits set).\n\nA: It might be a vsftpd configuration issue. If you're getting -rw-------, maybe the option file_open_mode is set to 0600 or local_umask to 060. From man vsftpd.conf:\n\nfile_open_mode\nThe permissions with which uploaded files are created. Umasks are applied on top of  this  value.  You\n    may wish to change to 0777 if you want uploaded files to be executable.\nDefault: 0666\nlocal_umask\nThe  value  that  the  umask for file creation is set to for local users.\nDefault: 077\n\nIf you want -rw-rw-r--, you could try changin one or both options in /etc/vsftpd.conf: file_open_mode=0660, local_umask=066.\nBear in mind that this change is server-wide. All uploaded files, even outside /var/www if it's not the only accesible directory, will get 660 permission, which might not be what you want.\n", "Q: How do I get localized names of application in python?

This leads me to believe that Ubuntu puts a temporary us map file somewhere that it pulls from, as I didn't even have to restart X to get it to work.\n\nA: See answer of Zaz at https://askubuntu.com/a/12301/82618\nEssentially, you need to append the variant list in /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/evdev.xml.

This all went well without a hitch. Previous to this, I spent several weeks enjoying and exploring ubuntu from the usb pendrive. During this time I changed lots of settings and customized Firefox and more. Now, I'd like to import the home folder from the usb drive into the new install home folder on the hard disk, which is the purported folder that holds all those special settings to my knowledge.\nUnfortunately and only being familiar with Windows file systems, the view of the usb file system from the new hdd install is totally perplexing. I can't find anything that looks anywhere close to the original file system. More, I can't find any of the files I had created and stored there, like the LibreOfficeCalc file that has all my passwords (this one is really discouraging) that was stored on the ubuntu desktop. Help me find this file alone and I'll bow down with full apologies to any and all computer gods. Being able to import all those customizing settings into the new install would be a major bonus also, but hey, I'm not greedy. I'll take the passwords file and be happy! And humble! \nI would be very grateful for some clear, understandable help on this.

But I would like to make this process faster by starting each profile from its own shortcut. How do I create a shortcut to launch each profile?\n\nA: I find this works:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open file explorer\n\n*Navigate to /usr/share/applications\n\n*Right-click on the Firefox link and select copy\n\n*Click on your desktop and select paste\n\n*Right click on the icon that has just been created and select properties\n\n*On the Basic tab fill command: firefox -no-remote -P \"profile name\"\n\n*On the Permissions tab check Execute\n\n\n\nDone!\n\nA: You can use your menu launcher creator (or right click the desktop and select new launcher, depending on what desktop you are on) to fashion two new firefox launchers. The command you need for each launcher is, for example:\nfirefox -Profile /home/mike/.mozilla/firefox/55divdmr.Mike2 -no-remote\n\nThis will launch firefox with that profile and make sure that it doesn't connect to any other running instance of firefox with the essential -no-remote switch. \nIf you wanted to do it manually, the desktop shortcut would look something like this; you could create it in a text-editor and name it firefox2.desktop:\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nName=fox2\nComment=my second profile\nExec=firefox -Profile /home/mike/.mozilla/firefox/55divdmr.Mike2 -no-remote\nPath=/home/mike\nIcon=/my/icon/location\nTerminal=false\nStartupNotify=false\n\n\nSomething else I recommend is going to your firefox folder ( mine is /home/mike/.mozilla/firefox) and checking that the StartWithLastProfile setting in profiles.ini is false: \n[General]\nStartWithLastProfile=0\n\nThis is because it can get confusing if you are using different profiles and you start firefox as normal without using a special shortcut and it just loads the last profile used. \nYou can also get prompted each time for which profile to use by making sure 'don't ask at startup' is unchecked, which is in the firefox ProfileManager settings below. This setting is reached with \nfirefox -ProfileManager -no-remote\n\nas noted in the question you referred to. \n\nFor more information on the command switches available for firefox see man firefox or the Ubuntu manpages online.

At least I guess it's the file manager, though nowhere do you find those words.  You get to \"Browse Network\" by clicking the \"Home Folder.\"\nMy network printer and \"Windows Network\" pop up soon enough, but double-clicking \"Windows Network\" may get to my local network, called \"localan,\" or it may claim a timeout after about 100 seconds.  If it does open localan, it shows the two Windows and a Debian machine on that network.  Trying to open one of them is the most problematic.  Oddly enough, after many timeout reports, suddenly the selected machine will open.  At least it has once in an afternoon of trying.  Once it opens, files in its folders are readily accessible.\nThe hardware can't be the problem.  Yesterday I was running Windows Vista on it.  Local network access was slick as a breeze and not the reason I abandoned Windows.\nTypically after a minute or so, trying to open \"localan,\" I get the following notification:\n\"Sorry, could not display all the contents of \"Windows shares on localan\": DBus error org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.NoReply: Did not receive a reply. Possible causes include: the remote application did not send a reply, the message bus security policy blocked the reply, the reply timeout expired, or the network connection was broken.\"\nand nothing else.  Clicking \"localan\" again gets the same timeout and message, although once it did return the list of machines on localan.\nNote that I am submitting this question from the same machine, using the same hardware and software, so it can't be the Ethernet adapter.

To may amazement, doing so completely fixed the problem!  Now all LAN access was as speedy as it had been under Vista. By the way, the magic trick in setting a static IP turns out to be hitting Enter after each IP you supply under the Network Manager (accessed by clicking that up-down arrow on the top bar).  If you miss even one, you can't save your entries.\nHowever ...\nA new and related problem arose the next time I booted Ubuntu.  It seems one always does!

The first image is the upstream GNOME Online Accounts settings view, which doesn't allow applications or plug-ins to add support for other services. The second one is the modified one in Ubuntu which does allow such abilities.\nHowever, neither of these has anything to do with the Webapps support in Unity, really. If you want to enable Unity Webapps support for GMail, then you should go to https://gmail.com/ and select to integrate into Ubuntu, when the in-browser pop-up asking you to, comes up.

I would like to change the icons displayed in window title bars:\n\nThe window icons appear to be unrelated to the icons used by launchers and docks, as they don't follow the ones defined in their respective .desktop files. In the example above the lower window (Recoll) is lacking a proper icon and showing a stock one instead, even though its launcher comes with an icon.\nSo my question is: Where can I find these window icons in my filesystem and how do I define a new one for an application of my choice?\n\nA: Generally, the icon is part of the theme, and should generally be the same icon as defined in the .desktop file. However, this really depends on the application. In many cases there won't necessarily be a file on the filesystem with the icon, as the icon will be embedded in the application itself.\nSo, it depends on what the application is doing in this case, as there are several ways for it to set the titlebar icons for its windows.\n", "Q: 13.04 Dash Icon and Ubuntu Gnome-Classic Issues The dash icon for Ubuntu 13.04 was \"released\", and a how-to on OMG!

Im trying to find an efficient way to switch between my OS systems without the painstaking shut down and start up.\n\nA: NO you can't. Ubuntu and windows uses same hardware. So they can't be used simultaneously. \nWhy not create a ntfs partiton which is accessible in both  OS.

You may have different successes, depending on which driver you choose. Such as you might increase FPS in games, but lose hibernation. \nThis is why Nvidia should open source their drivers. Open drivers have advantages. Proprietary driver/modules have differing ones.\nThen also do the following:\nhttp://news.softpedia.com/news/How-to-Fix-the-Big-and-Ugly-Plymouth-Logo-in-Ubuntu-10-04-140810.shtml\nThe last time I did Plymouth, with Ubuntu, Ubuntu made it extremely difficult to do any other theme, but the Ubuntu standard (per release) start-up, graphic theme. If you get that deep, some themes (for Ubuntu) work, and some do not.\n", "Q: Nvidia Drivers, Repo v.s Website I know the way to install both, I managed to get both working as it should, now im asking, Which is better ? as for your experience is there a different between Nvidia-Experimental-310 from Repo and the Binary installation from Nvidia Website ? \n\nA: There is no difference in actual performance, but from a package managing point of view the repositories are best. That way the package you install is registered with apt (the package manager) which allows easy updating and removal, and takes care of dependencies. Installing from a .run file (nvidia website) does not have these advantages; removing it might not be trivial.\nNOT RECOMMENDED: \nYou can convert the .run file to a .deb (the file format apt works with) by following the steps in How can I convert the Nvidia driver installer into a deb?.\nThat is also how the driver gets into the repository in the first place. You would for instance do this if there is a new driver on the nvidia website which is not yet in the repositories, and you can't wait.\n", "Q: Short-cut for switching to a given directory In the Ubuntu terminal I find myself spending considerable time to switch to a particular directory every time the computer starts up. Is there some way I can make this process easier? Is there some hotkey or some quick directory change that I can use (like speed dial on a phone)?\n eg:\n    cd 1:Changes to saved directory one\n\n\nA: Bash aliases are useful for creating short-cuts to commonly run commands. \n\n\n*\n\n*In ~/.bashrc, add a line similar to the following to create the alias:\nalias jump1='cd /long/path/name/that/is/frequently/used'\n\n\n*Close and open the terminal again, or run source ~/.bashrc.\n\n*From now on, you can just run jump1 to execute that long cd command.\nSee also:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I create an alias for cd and ls?\n\n*How do I create a permanent Bash alias?\n\nA: Even though there are some good answers already, I thought I'd mention for completeness the old pushd and popd Bash builtins with allow you to move very quickly between directories in deep paths in your filesystem. In contrast to the autojump bookmarks mentioned by burger.ga, the directory stack created by using pushd is only temporary.\nAs the GNU manual notes, pushd and popd are Bash builtins used to construct a temporary directory stack that is a\n\nlist of recently-visited directories. The pushd builtin adds directories to the stack as it changes the current directory, and the popd builtin removes specified directories from the stack and changes the current directory to the directory removed. The dirs builtin displays the contents of the directory stack. \n\nIt takes a bit of getting used to, but there are plenty of useful tutorials out there at this blog and this this site for example. There are no separate manpages for the commands, as they are included in the Bash manpage, but for quick reference you can view the GNU Bash page.\nThe clearest explanation is in this very useful article and is exactly the way I use pushd and popd:\nFirstly, use dirs or dirs -l to list directories on the stack and dirs -c to clear the stack.\nIn a sense you bookmark the location where you want to return by entering\npushd /home/mike/Pictures/Canon/2012_07_01\n\nand then you can add more directories to the stack, so you get a dirs listing as below, which includes 3 designated folders and your ~ home folder:\ndirs\n~/Downloads/folder/interest ~/Music/artist/album ~ ~/Pictures/Canon/2012_07_01\n\nYou actually don't need to use popd straightaway as that removes directories from the stack; the best thing to do is to use pushd to rotate the stack, so that you can keep switching between the directories and order them as you want. For more on that useful stack rotation see the Bash manpage.\nIf you have exactly the stack arrangement as the above dirs listing shows, pushd +3 switches you to the specific Pictures folder and places that on top of the stack (it is +3 and not +4 as you do not count your ~ in the directory stack):\npushd +3\n~/Pictures/Canon/2012_07_01 ~/Downloads/folder/interest ~/Music/artist/album ~\n\nSo the prompt reads, \n~/Pictures/Canon/2012_07_01$\n\nYou can keep on doing this without removing them from the stack, although any folders you cd to, other than those added to the directory stack with pushd, will alter your directory stack. \nOnce you have the directory stack arranged in the order you want, you can use popd to quickly cycle through the directories and then return to the home folder; for example, from Pictures we can return to Downloads:\npopd\n~/Downloads/folder/interest ~/Music/artist/album ~\n\nand the prompt reads\n~/Downloads/folder/interest$\n\nIn general the beauty of this is that you can set up the directory stack and the order of items within it with pushd and then, say you have three files to edit in each of those directories, you can return instantly to each one with popd while removing them from the directory stack. Then with your last popd you will return to ~. It becomes particularly useful when you have particularly deep directories and can use it to set up the directory stack to quickly move between them. \nIn addition, this question contains some tips that you might find useful when working on the command-line:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I undo the last cd command?\n\nA: Also have a look at autojump, it builds a database with previously visited directories and then you can jump to it.\nSo for instance you have\n/home/user/this/long/and/annoyingly/deep/directory/workstuff\n\nthen if you have visited it once you can jump to it by\nj workstuff\n\nor even\nj stuff\n\nbecause it also works with partial matches. If more than one directory matches you jump to the one that is most visited, if this is not the one you wanted, then repeat the command to go to the second. \nHowever it gets better! If you also have the directory\n/home/user/stuff\n\nand you do\nj stuff \n\nand then TabTabTab you get (in the order of most visited)\n$ j stuff__\nstuff__1__/home/user/this/long/and/annoyingly/deep/directory/workstuff\nstuff__2__/home/user/stuff\n\nand then you can just press the number of the directory you want!\nTo install you can just use sudo apt-get install autojump and then you need to add\nsource /usr/share/autojump/autojump.bash\n\nto your ~/.bashrc.\nMore information here: https://github.com/wting/autojump (also instruction on how to install this from src which gets you the most recent version)\n\nA: Even though there exists some command line way to do it faster, I would personnally recommand using a Nautilus extension called nautilus-open-terminal.\nFirst install the package nautilus-open-terminal and bookmarks your favorite folders with Nautilus. On Nautilus 3.6.*, you'll have to go into the gear menu and select Bookmark this Location.\n\nThen use Nautilus bookmarks to go faster in your favorite directories, and just right click on an empty space and select Open in Terminal.\n\nNow you can have both command line and file manager quick access to your favorite directories.\n\nA: anc was designed exactly for that use case.\nhttps://github.com/tobimensch/anc\nHere's an excerpt from the README.md:\n# make the current directory the default anchor:\n$ anc s\n\n# go to /etc, then /, then /usr/local and then back to the default anchor:\n$ cd /etc; cd ..; cd usr/local; anc\n\n# go back to /usr/local :\n$ anc b\n\n# add another anchor:\n$ anc a $HOME/test\n\n# view the list of anchors (the default one has the asterisk):\n$ anc l\n(0) /path/to/first/anchor *\n(1) /home/usr/test\n\n# jump to the anchor we just added:\n# by using its anchor number\n$ anc 1\n# or by jumping to the last anchor in the list\n$ anc -1\n\n# add multiple anchors:\n$ anc a $HOME/projects/first $HOME/projects/second $HOME/documents/first\n\n# use text matching to jump to $HOME/projects/first\n$ anc pro fir\n\n# use text matching to jump to $HOME/documents/first\n$ anc doc fir\n\n# add anchor and jump to it using an absolute path\n$ anc /etc\n# is the same as\n$ anc a /etc; anc -1\n\n# add anchor and jump to it using a relative path\n$ anc ./X11 #note that \"./\" is required for relative paths\n# is the same as\n$ anc a X11; anc -1\n\n# using wildcards you can add many anchors at once\n$ anc a $HOME/projects/*\n\n# use shell completion to see a list of matching anchors\n# and select the one you want to jump to directly\n$ anc pro[TAB]\n\nFull disclosure: I'm the author of anc.\n\nA: There are two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you want to be in a specific directory everyt time you open a bash terminal, edit your ~/.bashrc file and just add the line cd Directory, for example cd ~/Desktop.\n\n*If you want to have several short-cuts, you can always use global variables, which you can set in your ~/.bashrc file as follows export a=/tmp and then you would be able to do cd $a which would bring you to /tmp.\nRemember that after editing your .bashrc file you have to restart the terminal or open a new one.\n\nA: You can place an alias in your .bashrc file (or the config file for your favorite shell-they are usually in your home directory):\nalias cd1=\"cd directory/directory/my_destination/\"\n\nA useful info link about using aliases in bash is here.\n\nA: Consider setting the CDPATH environment variable in your .bashrc or .bash_profile. CDPATH takes the same colon-delimited form that other PATH like variables take, and lets cd take shortcuts in finding your directories. For example:\n$ mkdir -p /tmp/foo/bar/baz\n$ CDPATH='/tmp/foo/bar'\n$ cd baz\n/tmp/foo/bar/baz\n\n\nA: I created a set of bash function for this and added it to my .bash_profile\nScript\ngoto(){\n    cd $(getFolders $1)\n}\n\ngf(){\n    getFolders $1\n}\n\ngetFolders (){\n\n    local folderList=(\n     'alias'\n     'Description of alias'\n     '/path/to/alias/folder'\n     'alias2'\n     'Description of alias2'\n     '/path/to/alias2/folder'\n    )\n    local moved=\"0\"\n    local count=0\n\n    # Returns the path to the project\n    while [ \"${folderList[count]}\" != \"\" ]\n    do\n        if [ \"$1\" == \"${folderList[count]}\" ]; then\n            echo ${folderList[$(( $count + 2 ))]}\n            moved=\"1\"\n        fi\n        count=$(( $count + 3 ))\n    done\n\n    # Returns all project names\n    if [ \"$moved\" != \"1\" ]; then\n        count=0\n        while [ \"${folderList[count]}\" != \"\" ]\n        do\n            echoc 6 ${folderList[count]}\n            echo - ${folderList[count+1]}\n            count=$(( $count + 3 ))\n        done\n    fi\n}\n\nUsage\ngetFolders\nUsing getFolders you have a list of shorthand, description, and location for each folder.\nWhen you use getFolders with a shorthand it will output the folder location.\nYou can get a list of available folders and their descriptions by simply calling getFolders without a parameter\nExample of getting the folder path\ngetFolders alias\n\noutputs\n/path/to/alias/folder\n\nExample of getting available folders.\ngetFolders\n\noutputs\nalias\n- Description of alias\nalias2\n- Description of alias2\n\ngf\ngf is a shortcut for getFolders\ngf alias2\n\noutputs\n/path/to/alias2/folder\n\ngoto\ngoto is a simple way to cd to the selected folder.\ngoto alias\n\noutput\ncd has run on /path/to/alias/folder\n/path/to/alias/folder>\nWhy have multiple functions\nAt the heart the Unix and Linux you have simple reusable functions that can be chained together. I prefer this method as it does not just move you to a selected location but, is a function that by alias returns a path. You can use this function to do anything from that point like cd to that path.\n\nA: you can set up your own shortcut to a specific directory. \nFor example you want to go to nested directory ,generally you do \n\ncd /home/dir-1/dir-2/dir3/dir4/dir5/dir6/dir-target\n\nyou usually use the cd command and then type all the directory names or may be you skip typing (using TAB button) but it still takes few of your minutes.\nSo, to save your time you can make an alias of it in the terminal. Its one-time task to set up alias. \n\nalias dir-target = '/home/dir-1/dir-2/dir3/dir4/dir5/dir6/dir-target' \n\nNow, you have to just use the alias name ( dir-target) to move into your target directory.\n\nA: The quickest way I found is xd, an \"eXchange Directories\" program written by a Dutchman named Frank B.

I have installed krusader under Xubuntu and there I stored an ssh-password in the cache.\nNow the password changed, and I have no option to re-enter the password.\nkrusader only tells me, that the authentification failed.\nWhere do I find the kde security center in Xubuntu?\n\nA: First of all, I don't know if Krusader uses a different password store in XFCE or any non-KDE environment, but in KDE it saves passwords in the KDE Wallet. Anyway, you could try to see if you find your password there.\nYou can start the Waller Manager by running kwalletmanager at a terminal or using Alt+F2. A window should open that will show your wallet; click it to open it in a new window.\nIn the wallet window, search for your ssh connection (or something like that) in the top text box, or expand Passwords -> Maps in the left tree. If you find your entry, just right-click it and choose Delete.\nIf the Waller Manager shows more than one wallet, you can find in the KDE System Settings which one is the default. Run systemsettings and go to \"Account Details\" -> \"KDE Wallet\"; the default wallet should be selected in a combo box labeled \"Select wallet to use as default\".\nOf course, if there is no kwalletmanager in your system or you can't find your password in there, then Krusader must be storing them elsewhere.\n", "Q: broken `Launcher` after experimenting with `MyUnity` themes I used MyUnity to try some themes such as clearlooks and industrial and then I switched back to default.

Has anyone here had some experience creating a Debian / Ubuntu package? I am trying to backport the lammps package (http://packages.ubuntu.com/quantal/lammps) from Ubuntu 12.10 (Quantal) to Ubuntu 12.04\nI only need it unofficially - just need a .deb package for convenience's sake when creating custom virtual machine images for deployment to IaaS platform. \nFollowing the Ubuntu Packaging Guide at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PackagingGuide , I can build successfully, except when I try to rebuild using the debuild command, I usually get this error:\n dpkg-source: error: aborting due to unexpected upstream changes, see\n /tmp/lammps_0~20120615.gite442279-1.diff.aie32n dpkg-source: info: you\n can integrate the local changes with dpkg-source --commit\n dpkg-buildpackage: error: dpkg-source --include-binaries -i -b\n lammps-0~20120615.gite442279 gave error exit status 2\n\nRunning 'make clean-all' at the src directory still does not solve the problem. Is there any way to completely clean off all the files that were generated during the build process, or to ask debuild to ignore any differences in the source files?\n\nA: This means you have applied changes to the unpacked upstream source which are not part of a patch in the debian/patches/ directory, or listed in the series file in there if they are; and/or there is some inconsistency in the state of quilt's application of the patches.\nLooking at the mentioned file in /tmp will show you the changes in question.\n\nA: Avoid the Debian bureaucracy by just building the binary: dpkg-buildpackage -b\n\nA: @Thomas Vander Stichele\nI have come up with a workaround that uses the generated temporary file as a patch:\n$ cp /tmp/path_to_diff_file_created_by_dpkg-source debian/patches/useful_name_of_applied_patch.patch\n$ echo useful_name_of_applied_patch.patch >> debian/patches/series\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20150829023050/https://www.theo-andreou.org/?p=1112#toc-apply-patches-for-policy-compliance\n\nA: I saw this problem when quilt incorrectly thought I had applied patches to my working copy (you can find its current status in the .pc folder).  The fix in that case was to force quilt to pop all the patches with quilt pop -a -f.\n\nA: change the format in debian/source/format from 3.0 (quilt) to 3.0 (native) if you do not want to use quilt. \nThis solved the problem for me anyway. \n\nA: This may happen if you did all the Debian \"paperwork\" but happened to have lingering artifacts from previous attempts.  In particular, auto-generated changes to “config.sub”, “config.guess” and “Makefile”.\nYou could put this in debian/source/options:\n# Don't store changes on autogenerated files\nextend-diff-ignore = \"(^|/)(config\\.sub|config\\.guess|Makefile)$\"\n\nRef: https://raphaelhertzog.com/2011/01/28/3-ways-to-not-clutter-your-debian-source-package-with-autogenerated-files/\n\nA: https://manpages.debian.org/jessie/debhelper/dh_clean.1.en.html\nConfigure often modifies the source tree, you can list these files in\ndebian/clean\n\nExample debian/clean\nsrc/auto/config.h\nsrc/auto/config.mk\n\n\nA: This issue usually appears during subsequent building of debian packages, although you may or may not have made changes to the original source during the first build. During the first time build, dpkg-source creates a <package-source>.orig.tar.{xz, gz, lzma} in the top-level directory. For eg. in the case of libva, you would find it as:\nparent\n├── libva\n├── libva_2.11.0.orig.tar.xz\n\nNow when you make changes inside libva/ or try to build subsequent times, it unpacks this source tar.gz and tries to compare with the new build files, finding changes in the new build.\nThe solution is to remove the older source tar, create a new one for the subsequent build using:\ndh_make --createorig -p libva_2.11.0\n\nAnd continue building the deb pkgs using the commands that you have been doing. Usually it would be:\ndebuild -d -uc -us\n\nor\ndpkg-buildpackage -b -uc -us\n\n", "Q: ubuntu 12.10, 12.04 \"Unable to find medium containing a live file system\" When installing ubuntu via xen i get \n\nUnable to find medium containing a live file system\n\ni go the iso from http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop\nand have been following this tuorial\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/XenProposed : Manually installing an HVM Guest VM\nthis is my xen cfg file\nbuilder='hvm'\nkernel='/usr/lib/xen-4.1/boot/hvmloader'\nname = \"ubuntu\"\nmemory = \"2048\"\nmaxmem = \"13312\"\nvcpus = 4\ndisk = ['phy:/dev/server/ubuntu-hvm,hda,w','file:/data/ubuntu-12.10-desktop-     amd64.iso,hdc:cdrom,r']\nvfb = [\"type=vnc, vncunused=1, keymap=en-us, vnclisten=0.0.0.0\"]\nvif = ['bridge=eth0']\nboot=\"dc\"\ndevice_model='/usr/lib/xen-4.1/qemu-dm'\n\ni tested 12.04, 11.10 ange get the same error\nThanks for your help\n\nA: It's a bit of a guesswork:\n\n\n*\n\n*The space at 'file:/data/ubuntu-12.10-desktop-     amd64.iso,hdc:cdrom,r' shouldn't be there.

I am seriously considering installing Ubuntu, it looks cool, the tour felt nice and it's a really smooth program.\nBut what if I decide later on in life that I would like to go to Windows again, could I? Will I be able to run programs like PowerPoint, Word, Excel and iTunes?\n\nA: You can have both Windows and Ubuntu installed on the same computer. However, in general, you cannot run programs built for Windows on Ubuntu.\nYou could also potentially run either Windows or Ubuntu, and any applications you need on them, inside a virtual machine, such as VirtualBox or VMWare; though for some types of applications, you may experience a severe degradation in performance.\n\nA: PowerPoint, Word, Excel and iTunes all have open source equivalents available for installation in Ubuntu:  LibreOffice Impress, LibreOffice Writer, LibreOffice Calc and Banshee (or Rhythmbox or any number of others).  I dual-boot Windows and Ubuntu, only because my two sons would revolt if I were to remove Windows (because of games).  Remember that besides any practical considerations for migrating away from Windows, there are ethical reasons to do so, as well.  Microsoft restricts its users from altering or redistributing its programs and hides its source code away from the public as proprietary.  Open source software, by definition, makes its source code available to the public, where it can be freely scrutinized, modified, improved upon, and redistributed.  Whenever another person starts using open source software, it helps everyone, even if the new user is only another pair of eyes to look out for and report bugs.\n\nA: If you are pretty serious about running Windows programs in Ubuntu, you can use Wine , to run some, if not all, of the Windows programs.\n\nA: If you install Ubuntu, you can install it alongside Windows. That means, whenever your computer starts, you will be greeted by a selection that asks you whether you would like to start Windows or Ubuntu.\nYou can also, however, remove Windows upon installing Ubuntu.\nIn the first case, all of your programs are kept exclusively on Windows. There is no synergy between the Ubuntu and Windows installation. That means no files or programs are shared between the two operating system. You can access files that are on the Windows system from Ubuntu per default. Windows requires you to install a driver (ext42fd) to be able to access Ubuntu's files.\nIn the second case, all programs and files are lost. You will need to back up your files before making the switch. Programs can never be transferred. So if you have Word on Windows, it cannot be moved to Ubuntu. First, because Word doesn't exist for Ubuntu (we have LibreOffice Writer). Second, because if a Word for Ubuntu existed, it would be incredibly different from the version for Windows under the hood.\nSo, if you install Ubuntu, you will have to reinstall programs that you currently have on Windows. If the program doesn't exist for Ubuntu, you will have to find an alternative program that functions approximately the same. So instead of Word, you would have Writer. Software like Skype, however, has both a Windows and a Linux version. This differs per piece of software.\nIf you decide to switch back to Windows after a while, and you had taken the approach of removing Windows, you will have to reinstall Windows entirely and reinstall all programs you had previously had. So if you have Word now, wipe Windows, install Ubuntu and reinstall Windows, you will have to install Word again.\n", "Q: Black screen on boot after installing ati drivers System: Xubuntu 12.10 x86\nI installed the Ati drivers using the Software Center, everything apparently whent fine (no error messages).\nAfter rebooting the system i get a black screen.

This is pretty important. My school is currently in a stage of digitalisation that wants to get rid of textbooks and replace them with tablets in class. They are, however, contemplating on using iBooks Author to allow teachers to create content for students. And as we know, files created with iBooks Author can only be used on Apple products. Therefore, all students will be required to purchase an iPad for use in class, for any alternatives simply become impossible.\nFor many reasons, I disagree with this approach, and would like to see a BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) policy. This is possible if a workable solution to the problem is found. Namely, the school needs a system that allows the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Easy(!) creation of digital textbooks by teachers. A lot of teachers aren't digital masterminds, and require a simple interface to create textbooks.\n\n*Ease of use for students. Students shouldn't be distracted by complicated interfaces.\n\n*The textbooks must be able to play multimedia. The textbook should be able to contain text, images, audio and video.\n\n*Content allows for use on tablets (iOS and Android primarily). Preferably, it should allow for use on any device.\n\n\nThe following are much preferred (the iBooks approach doesn't meet some of these):\n\n\n*\n\n*Easy sharing. The teacher must be able to easily share the textbook with students and push updates effortlessly. Files are technically a no-no, but acceptable. The school already has a system for pushing files to students.\n\n*Free of charge. The school can't afford licenses for every student or for every teacher.\n\n*HTML5. Anything HTML5 is good.\n\n\nDoes anything come to mind? You can think outside the box, really, see if anything meets the requirements.\n\nA: There are two alternatives available for you. One is Open-Source and the other is a commercial product.\nBookType (Open Source).\n\n\n*\n\n*A cloud-based solution, so inherently multi-platform. Can be installed on a local server.\n\n*The Books developed can be hosted on the cloud, can be made available in any formt, with any license of your choosing.\n\n\nInkling Habitat (Commercial).\nSource\n\nA: I am now using Booksmart by Blurb, and have heard from support that it actually is possible to embed audio and video to an electronic book - which makes me happy! I will say this, though: the software is very slow on my iMac G5 and is extremely picky about the pictures it uses.\nBooktype, by contrast, is a joy to use. It doesn't have the limitations of the Blurb software and is fast and flexible. Then why not use it?\nIt depends on your goals. It is important to me that I retain copyright in my poetry, and Blurb will allow me to do this. Booktype is wonderful collaborative software, but everything produced in it is creative commons. You retain copyright to nothing.\nI don't know if Booktype will let  you add multimedia. If it does, it would be perfect for a collaborative book. The hardware requirements are modest and the program works well. I would not have used Blurb if I hadn't had the concern about retaining copyright. But then, although I'd really like to have multimedia in my iBook, it isn't absolutely essential to me.\nI hope this helps with the original question. Kudos to the inventors of Booktype! Really.\n\nA: Actually, using open software does not make your content open source.  Booktype's page linked above even states that you can assign any license to the books you create.\n\nA: Mashable has a list that shows several alternatives to iBooks Authors called How iBooks Author Stacks Up to the Competition \n", "Q: How can I modify the size of swap with LVM partitions? I'm trying to add/modify a swap partition on my LVM-formatted hard disk by using GParted from a LiveCD.  I only see one big partition taking up the whole disk.  \nIs there a hidden swap?  \nDoes an LVM-formatted system even need a swap?\nI'm using Ubuntu 12.10.\n\nA: I do not like using GParted, partially because most of my servers are without GUI.\nHere's how to extend a swap setup as a logical volume:\n1) Determine the name of the swap logical volume using the \"lvs\" command:\n$ lvs\nLV VG Attr LSize Origin Snap% Move Log Copy%\nroot_lv volgroup0 -wi-ao 7.00G\nswap_lv1 volgroup0 -wi-ao 30.00G\ntmp_lv volgroup0 -wi-ao 3.00G\nusr_lv volgroup0 -wi-ao 7.00G\nvar_lv volgroup0 -wi-ao 4.00G\n\n2) Turn off the swap partition:\n$ swapoff /dev/volgroup0/swap_lv1\n\n3) Resize the swap partition, adding 15GB more space to it:\n$ lvresize -L+15G /dev/volgroup0/swap_lv1\nExtending logical volume swap_lv1 to 30.00 GB\nLogical volume swap_lv1 successfully resized\n\n4) Format the new swap space to make it usable:\n$ mkswap /dev/volgroup0/swap_lv1\nSetting up swapspace version 1, size = 41875927 kB\n\n5) Turn the swap volume back on:\n$ swapon /dev/volgroup0/swap_lv1\n\n6) Use free command to show your new swap space:\n$ free -t | grep -i swap\nSwap: 30719 0 30719\n\n\nA: Whether you use LVM or not has nothing to do with whether you need swap or not.\nTo view LVM logical volumes, run lvs on the command line, or use the GNOME Disks utility.\nThe version of GParted that ships with Ubuntu 12.10 does not support LVM. It only sees physical volumes, and cannot resize or move them.\nHowever, the latest version of GParted does support LVM.

My laptop has 1GB of RAM and an Intel Pentium processor.  Which distribution would be  best for it?\nSpecs are here.\n\nA: Welcome in Ubuntu Community :) Because your laptop can have only up to 1 GB memory I suggest you to go with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (Long Time Support) 32 bit or 12.10 32 bit. Is should work out of the box. You can download it here:  http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop.\nIt's important that you will install 32 bit version. You can  find some discussion about 32 and 64 bit architecture here. \n\n\n*\n\n*What are the differences between 32-bit and 64-bit, and which should I choose?\n\nA: With just 1Gb of Ram I would go with Lubuntu or maybe Xubuntu.\nHowever it seems you have a display driver problem.

I have a 120GB SSD and a 750GB HDD in my computer.\nMy SSD has Windows 7 installed and my HDD has Windows 8 installed.   \nWhen I boot my computer normally, I boot it to my SSD.   \nI went through the installation process, putting Ubuntu on a separate partition on my HDD.  \nWhen I restarted my computer, it didn't give me an option to boot to Ubuntu. If it helps, I believe I used ext4 and only set it to '/'. If I want to make Ubuntu bootable from my computer, how would I go about doing that?\n\nA: From your question, this is what I can summarize about your Disk Layout\nSSD : Windows 8\nHDD : Wnidows 7, Ubuntu\nAlso, you have configured your BIOS settings to automatically from SSD.\nAssuming the above assertions are right, this is how you solve your problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Since your default Boot Media is your SSD, you are not able to see the option for Ubuntu at all.\n\n*So, you can enter your BIOS settings and change your HDD to the default bootable media and the next time you boot, you will be booting from your HDD, and you should be able to see the option for Ubuntu.\n\n*Or, as an alternative, you can enable the option to choose the Boot Media during boot time. This is mostly done by activating the F12 key from the BIOS Options. Now, every time you boot, you press F12, and you will asked for the Boot Media.

What are the potential problems that SELinux can bring into an Ubuntu Web server?\n\nA: I think in the case of a web server, SELinux is probably overkill. Talking with the \"ubuntu-hardened\" folks the focus seems to be on Apparmor. I think this is fine and you can further lock down the Apparmor Apache profile if you want. Assuming your running Apache and SSH. I would run them both in their own chrooted environments. \n", "Q: How can I install screem?

The Ubuntu packages page contains details about it, but the problem in either installing or compiling lies in that it requires very old dependencies that are not compatible with the current 12.10 packages. \nThe package you mention, 'libgtkhtml-2.0' was in the repositories for Hardy with the accompanying -dev files necessary for compilation, as were most of the other necessary dependencies, but they can't be installed to the system on 12.10 without causing a lot of problems.\nUnfortunately, there hasn't been much active development of the project for a long while, going by the mailing-lists and the code commits, although someone did try compiling recently (2011) and the answer noted on the mailing-lists might give you some help, as it points to a more recent version of the project. However, I think the same problem with dependencies will be present.\n", "Q: Can't boot in 12.04 after formatting the entire drive I installed ubuntu 12.04 by formatting the drive that had windows 7.

Richard Stallman states that Ubuntu \"has installed surveillance code\".\nSee: Ubuntu Spyware -What to Do?\nIs this true? \nI agree with him that \"Any excuse Canonical offers is inadequate....\". \n\nA: I guess it depends on what you see as spyware.\nWhen you type something on the dash, what you typed is sent to web to show you results related to what you typed. For example, if i type \"Prince\" i get a listing of available musics from Prince to buy.\nPersonally i don't see this as spyware (maybe \"adware\"?). The perception of spyware i have is of an application that sends information that you don't know and without your consent. Here i know what is sent, and i have means to disable it.\nIf you open the dash, on the right bottom corner, you can find a link named \"Legal notice\" where you can get more information on what is collected: \n\nBy searching in the dash you consent to:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*the collection and use of your search terms and IP address in this way; and\n  \n*the storage of your search terms and IP address by Canonical and such selected third parties (if applicable).\n  \n\nAlso to disable this feature, you can search on dash for \"Privacy\":\n\nHope this helps.\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I remove Amazon search results from the dash or disable the feature?\n\nA: Depends on your point of view. The controversy is over the \"unity shopping lens\". The shopping lens lets you look for \"things\" right from your computer. So if you look for \"candles\" you will get results, even though it's not a file or app.  You will be presented with a choice to buy candles. \nThe real problem isn't that this lens exists, stuff like this has existed for a long time, the problem is the dashboard includes the results by default. So when you press the super key and the dash in unity pops up you type \"can\" and you get some applications, some files, and some amazon search results. You can scope you search to just files, or just applications, but by default, you search for everything (including shopping results).\nCanonical has stated that the results go to their server, are made \"more\" anonymous and then sent to amazon. With Canonical acting as a go between. \nThe truth is it's probably not a totally bad idea. It would be nice to press super, type Mountain Dew, and have someone bring me a cold can of caffeine. However, the implementation leaves a lot to be desired. Most notably that it's on by default. It smacks of evil marketing, and it is quite offensive to many Linux users. \nThe good news is that it's very easy to remove or turn off. \nFrom system setting, under privacy, disable \"Internet searches\". \nIt that's not good enough you can sudo apt-get remove unity-shopping-lens\nPersonally, I have it turned off and everything works fine. I do find it very annoying that my OS had \"ads\" in them, but at the same time, I can see how, properly matured, it could be friggin' awesome. \nHonestly, we will just have to wait and see how the general community plays out, and rather it's accepted as the first step to a more awesome feature or totally unacceptable data mining. \nA few other things to keep in mind:\n\n\n*\n\n*It only effects Unity (Ubuntu default Desktop Environment)\n\n*It's easy to turn off\n\n*Ton's of other \"searchers\" existed before hand, this is just one that Canonical supports and makes use of\n\n*Stallman is a bit of a nut on some topics, and has a history of going, what most would consider 100% overboard on some issues. \n\n*The lens in question is about the same as the amazon store plugin in Amarok, Banshee, Rhythmbox, etc. \n\n*There are tons of people who want this feature and add it in via scripts, extensions, and add-ons. \n\n*Ubuntu's only real sin is having it on by default, and handling the PR extreamly poorly.\n\n\nThis article and the related ones may help you to decide.\n", "Q: \"/etc/init.d/networking restart\" with non-root user I have a thin client with 112mb RAM which boots ubuntu server 12.04.1 from a usb drive with openbox and it is to be used by students to communicate with cisco equipment.

It was added in Linux kernel 2.6.12 in\n  March 8, 2005.\nIt allows a process to make a one-way transition into a \"secure\" state\n  where it cannot make any system calls except exit(), sigreturn(),\n  read() and write() to already-open file descriptors. Should it attempt\n  any other system calls, the kernel will terminate the process with\n  SIGKILL.\nIn this sense, it does not virtualize the system's resources but\n  isolates the process from them entirely.\n\n\n\nGoogle is exploring using seccomp for sandboxing its Chrome web\n  browser.\nAs of Chrome version 20, seccomp is used to sandbox Adobe Flash\n  Player. As of Chrome version 23, seccomp is used to sandbox the\n  renderers.\n\nSee also:\n\n\n*\n\n*Chrome 20 on Linux and Flash sandboxing\n\n*Introducing Chrome's next-generation Linux sandbox\n\n*A safer playground for your Linux and Chrome OS renderers\n", "Q: Best triple head display setup I'm currently running Ubuntu 12.04 with a darn good triple head display setup. I've got a VisionTek 900530 Radeon HD 5450 512MB DDR3 PCI Express video card that has two DVI outputs and one Mini DisplayPort that I have connected to a HDMI adapter.  I'm running three identical Asus 1920x1080 monitors that each have a DVI, VGA, and HDMI input.\nI'm using the xorg-edgers ppa, so I'm using the open source radeon driver version 6.99.99. I tried using the ATI binary fglrx driver, but I wasn't able to get the three monitors working properly- the monitor connected via HDMI / DisplayPort wouldn't run at full resolution.\nThe setup is almost perfect:\n\n\n*\n\n*Compiz runs fine and is quite snappy.\n\n*I'm not able to use that great compiz feature where you can drag a window to the side of a display and it will half maximize.\n\n*I occasionally experience display corruption weirdness with Unity and need to restart it.\n\n*When I use a dropdown menu in LibreOffice it often pops the menu down in another window. For example, if I'm using the center monitor and click the Insert menu, the menu pulls down on the monitor to my right, forcing me to chase it. If I chase down the menu and choose Manual Break, the dialog appears over on my left monitor. This absurdity is mildly entertaining but has lost its novelty.\n\n\nI've decided to build a new system and have spared no expense- latest i7 processor, SSD, etc.  I really like the performance of the Nvidia binary drivers, so I put two ZOTAC ZT-40707-10L GeForce GT 440 in the system, figuring I'd have four DVI outputs and an awesome triple (or even eventually quad) head setup.\nUnfortunately it appears that I didn't do sufficient research before my purchase. It seems that Nvidia TwinView only supports two monitors on one card (I guess that's why they call it TwinView...). I messed around with running two X servers, but I really don't want that- being able to drag windows to any monitor is critical. It doesn't sound like Xinerama is an option because from what I understand it simply doesn't support Compiz.\nI've seen a BaseMosaic option that can be used with the Nvidia drivers that appears to support an almost unlimited number of heads- unfortunately my cheap little cards don't support it. I'm also not sure whether you'll still have all nice maximizing and snapping that TwinView provides, or whether Ubuntu will only see it as one massive display.\nI put my old trusty ATI card into my new system and installed 12.10. I'm using the opensource radeon drivers again because even in 12.10 I can't get the fglrx binary drivers to do triple head. Unfortunately, even with an unbelievably powerful system the experience is extremely sluggish (much more so than my experience in 12.04). The menu scattering problem appears to be fixed, but I get a lot of nasty Unity display corruption.\n\nSo finally, my question is this:\nWhat hardware / drivers should I use?\nI'm willing to buy (almost) any video card(s). I have two PCI-Express 3.0 slots on my motherboard (which has an integrated Intel HD card). I'm willing to use ATI or Nvidia cards and willing to run Ubuntu 12.04.1 or 12.10.\nI'm not a gamer, but do want beautiful and snappy Compiz effects.\nDoes anyone out there have the perfect triple head setup in 12.04 or 12.10?  What hardware / drivers are you using? I have those two Nvidia cards but will probably be returning them unless someone knows a way to use them together for a triple head setup.\nSince I'm having pretty good luck with a single ATI card providing three displays, should I just buy a beefier one with the hopes that it will fix the horrible sluggishness I'm experiencing in 12.10?\n\nA: So I purchased an Nvidia GTX 650 Ti with four video outputs (two DVI, one HDMI, on VGA). The card was about $175.  I am running 12.10 with the nvidia-experimental-310 drivers installed.\nBy playing with the Displays dialog and the NVIDIA X Server Settings program I now have TwinView running three monitors simultaneously.  Compiz effects are fantastic.\nThink I finally found my perfect triple head display.\n", "Q: Polly (twitter client) problem authorization Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.

Does anyone have any experience updating an Asus PC BIOS before installing Ubuntu (Lubuntu)? The laptop currently has Windows 7 Starter installed.\n\nA: The short answer is if it isn't broke, don't fix it. Is there a feature that one of the BIOS updates offers that you expect to rely on? If not, don't bother. If you still feel that you should update your BIOS, generally there are a few ways of going about it. Sometimes there's a windows installer and you just run an executable that does the trick. I went to Asus's download page and all they offer is a zipped .rom file. That means you'll have to do it manually. I don't know the features available on your BIOS and your EEE PC probably doesn't have a disc drive, so I recommend using the Ultimate Boot CD (if you want to save the disc, you could even boot UBCD off a pen drive). Here's a forum thread that should help you on the UBCD site. Last time I flashed a BIOS was on a Pentium 4 with a CD, looks like in your case you're going to have to deal with the command prompt in freeDOS running off the UBCD (plus if you run it off a USB key, you may be able to store the BIOS rom on the same pen drive to flash the BIOS).\n", "Q: Problems upgrading to Python 3.3 and setting up Django I'm new to Linux and am trying to set up Python / Django on my machine!  I installed Python 3.3 from the source file and it was compiled into /usr/local/bin.

Or any tips on how to clean up this install (if this one is too broken)?\n\nA: If you \"replace\" the default python installation you will probably break the system. There are many system tools that use python2.X and will fail when using python3. In your case, python3 doesn't have the apt_pkg module, so you get that error.\nTo solve this just remove the symlink created and link it to the default python2.X (in 12.10 it is python2.7):\nsudo rm /usr/bin/python\nsudo ln -s /usr/bin/python2.7 /usr/bin/python\n\nIf you want to make python3 the \"default\" interpreter i guess the best way without breaking anything is using virtualenv (more info here):\nvirtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3.3 <destination dir>\n\n\nA: Don't symlink /usr/bin/python to python3.

I don't have nVidia graphics, but I do have AMD's Radeon HD 4200.  In my experience, I have found that certain programs on Ubuntu 12.04 Precise Pangolin run better on my Toshiba Satellite L505D laptop when I use my Open-Source video drivers (packages look like \"xorg-xserver-video-(radeon or ati)\" and I will give you a few examples.  \nI found Google Chrome wouldn't work & display pages correctly and would crash when I used AMD's FGRLX proprietary video driver.  I think Compiz was affected by the FGLRX driver too.  I couldn't even change the brightness of my laptop's screen.  But after I correctly and safely uninstalled the proprietary FGLRX video driver and switch back to X.Org's open drivers, I noticed the above programs worked much better/correctly again.  Google Chrome started up and loaded web pages much faster going at light speed! I could've sworn Chrome worked faster on Ubuntu 12.04 Precise Pangolin than on my Windows 7 partition....\nThe downside was that my 3D gaming suffered, and I couldn't play Team Fortress 2 through WINE.

So I didn't touch files under /etc.\nI did the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restore correct association between ZIP-files and archive manager (I did it within default file manager Nemo).\n\n*Create definition of MIME type. In my case I created firefox-maff-my.xml file in ~/.local/share/mime/packages directory with the content provided below:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<mime-info xmlns=\"http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/shared-mime-info\">\n  <mime-type type=\"application/maff\">\n         <comment>Mozilla Archive Format</comment>\n         <glob pattern=\"*.maff\"/>\n  </mime-type>\n</mime-info>\n\n\n*Update MIME database\nupdate-mime-database ~/.local/share/mime/\n\n\n*Edit ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list. \nAdd \napplication/maff=firefox.desktop\n\nline right under [Default Applications].\n\n*Log out, then log in.\nIn case of doubts you can make backup of each involved file before editing it. If something will go wrong you can revert everything you did (just restore original files, remove firefox-maff-my.xml and run update-mime-database ~/.local/share/mime/ again).\n\nI've faced similar issue in Linux Mint 17.1 Cinnamon. Perhaps this also will work for GNOME (because both follow freedesktop.org).\n\nA: As of 2016/Feb/20, this is the correct solution to associate MAFF files to Firefox (or any other files), without affecting the Compressed archive/ZIP association:\n# run as sudo\n\necho '<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<mime-info xmlns=\"http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/shared-mime-info\">\n<mime-type type=\"application/x-maff\">\n<comment>Maff File</comment>\n<glob pattern=\"*.maff\"/>\n</mime-type>\n</mime-info>' > /usr/share/mime/packages/maff.xml\n\nupdate-mime-database /usr/share/mime\n\n# now kill X or logout.\n\nThe assogiate solution is not valid anymore, as the package has been removed from the Ubuntu repositories after v14.04.\n\nA: I don't know what a .maff file is exactly, but you need to define a new MIME type for it. Application associations are based on MIME type and not file extension.\n\nA: Simple way to do this is by using mimeopen command to open .maff file format using Firefox\nOpen terminal and type\nmimeopen some_file_name.maff\n\nYou will be provided with available packages to open the .maff file \nPlease choose a default application for files of type application/zip\n\n    1) Archive Manager  (file-roller)\n    2) Archive Mounter  (mount-archive)\n    3) Other...\n\nselect 3 from the option and enter the command as firefox\nuse application #3\nuse command: firefox\n\nThis will open up .maff file in Firefox and will be set as default program to open .maff file\n", "Q: Gateway IP Returns to Zero When you set a static IP under Ubuntu 12.04.1, you must supply the desired machine IP and the gateway IP, all using the Network Manager.

Now, no matter how often I resupply it, it returns to zero immediately after NM \"saves\" it: that is, appears as zero when redisplayed.  The only way I can get to the Internet is to restore DHCP operation.\nI need to use static IP for access to my home network.  Would appreciate any suggestion.\n--Robert Smith\n\nA: If you can't get network manager to work correctly, you can setup static IP addresses by editing the /etc/network/interfaces file.  Full documentation on how to do this can be found in man interfaces.  For example, you could setup eth0 to have a static IP address by inserting this into the file:\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\n    address 192.168.1.100\n    netmask 255.255.255.0\n    network 192.168.1.0\n    broadcast 192.168.1.255\n    gateway 192.168.1.1\n    dns-nameservers xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx\n\nAfter doing this run \"sudo restart network-manager\" or reboot.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: How do I install the library libSDL_image-1.2.so.0 required to run Dwarf Fortress?

How can I know that I am correctly typing my password in a terminal when invoking sudo?\nI am not very computer literate, so I would appreciate a simple explanation.\n\nA: Having numbers and upper-case characters, or any other ASCII character for that matter, has no bearing whatsoever on whether or not sudo will be able to handle your password. If you can type it on your keyboard, you can use it in your password.\nThe only practical difference between the sudo password prompt and a normal terminal session is that you can't see what you're typing with sudo.\n\nA: If you are using sudo for some GUI programs, you can try gksudo which gives you a GUI to enter password, which atleast shows how much characters you have typed, just like any other password field.\n\nA: Changing case and adding numbers or other characters makes a password much more secure.  While it requires more care when entering it is done in exactly the same way as you enter it anywhere else in the system: using the shift key to enter capitals or special characters as required.\nTerminal and most text-based password verifiers will not echo any keystrokes however, and this causes some confusion.  Just type the password as would normally with no errors and press enter.  Nothing whatsoever will appear on the screen while you are doing this.\n", "Q: Vagrant: VirtualBox: Headless Ubuntu: How to set up bridged networking? I am trying to set up a Vagrant VirtualBox (v4.2.4) virtual machine with a Ubuntu \"box\" which I got from www.vagrantbox.es. \nI was able to use Vagrant to set it up as a headless box and start it, and then I was able to ssh locally into it (using 127.0.0.1:2222), connect the internet and sun a bunch of \"sudo apt-get\" commands to update it and install new software. \nI would like to be able to access this virtual machine on my network, so I need a bridged network adapter for the virtual box. When I went to the VirtualBox console for this device, and tried to set up bridged networking, it said that I needed the \"guest additions\". I tried to install them and I couldn't get the .iso file for the guest additions. \nI went elsewhere on the 'net and it seems that I had to run \"sudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-additions-iso\" from the virtual machine in order to get bridged networking. I tried this, and it installed fine after a couple of reboots. I then tried to set up bridged networking again (VirtualBox console to Devices->Network Adaptors...) but it didn't work. \n-------------- EDIT more clarification-------------------\nMy Vagrantfile looks like this:\n# -*- mode: ruby -*-\n# vi: set ft=ruby :\n\nVagrant::Config.run do |config|\n  config.vm.box = \"ubuntu1204\"\n  config.vm.box_url = \"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4031118/Vagrant/ubuntu-12.04.1-server-i686-virtual.box\"\n  config.vm.network :bridged\nend\n\nWhen I tried \"vagrant up\", here is what I got:\nC:\\Users\\Jay\\vagrantprojects\\vagrant_guide>vagrant up\n[default] VM already created.

So what do I need to do?\n---- end EDIT ------------------------------------------------------\nWhat, or what else do I need to do to set up bridged networking in this virtual machine?\nI appreciate any help that I can get. \n\nA: If you're using Vagrant, then you should be able to specify the bridged network option in your Vagrantfile, rather than trying to configure it by hand on the VM itself.\nHere's a sample Vagrantfile (note line #8) - just change your config.vm.network line to be:\nconfig.vm.network :bridged\n\nSee the docs for reference.\nThe Vagrantfile just goes at the root of your project - the same folder from where you run vagrant up and such.\nAlso, you can ssh into the box using vagrant ssh - you don't need to specify the IP address and port - vagrant will take its config file (Vagrantfile - see a theme here? - most everything having to do with the basic VM config goes in the Vagrantfile), and it will take care of creating, configuring, connecting, and tearing down the VM.\n", "Q: How do add a new line when an expression is found in a text file? I have the page source of a website but the links that I need are clumped together. How do I separate each link, one link per line, if they all start with href? \n\nA: There are several ways to do it. For example, you can write a small program or script to do the work, or use a text editor capable of formatting HTML, or one that can do a search/replace using regular expressions.\nI'll show you the last two options, using jEdit (sudo apt-get install jedit),  although there are plenty of other editors you can use.\nAuto format the HTML text\nYou'll need one of the \"Beauty\" or \"XML\" plugins for jEdit. In jEdit, go to \"Plugins\" -> \"Plugin Manager...\", tab \"Install\", check \"Beauty\" or/and \"XML\", click button \"Install\". If you now go to the tab \"Manage\", the plugin(s) should be listed there.\nTo use Beauty, you'll need to make sure that the html formatter is selected. Go to \"Plugins\" -> \"Plugin Options...\". In the left tree, open \"Plugins\"/\"Beauty\"/\"Modes\". In the right list, select Beautifier html:beauty for Mode html.\n\nClick OK. Now open your file and check that the edit mode is html (status bar, bottom left)\n\nRun the plugin by going to \"Plugins\" -> [initials] -> \"Beauty\" -> \"Beautify Buffer\".\nOr, to use XML, just go to \"Plugins\" -> [initials] -> \"XML\" -> \"Indent XML\".\nSearch/replace using regular expressions\nLoad your file in jEdit, press Ctrl+F to open the \"Search And Replace\" dialog and change the options so that it looks like this:\n\nThat is: Search for: (<a(?:\\s+[^>]*)?>.*?</a>). Replace with: \\n$1\\n. Be careful that \"Regular expressions\" is checked. Now press \"Replace All\" and all links should get a new line before and after. If you want the new line only before the link, replace with \\n$1 instead; if you want it only after, replace with $1\\n. Here's the reference of regular expressions in jEdit.\nI tested the replace with:\n<h1><a name=\"top\"></a>Test</h1>\n<div><a href=\"#top\" title=\"link #1\"><strong><em>first</em> link</strong></a><a href=\"page.html\">page</a><!-- empty --><a href=\"l1.html\"></a><abbr title=\"something\">smt</abbr><p>more <a title=\"\" href=\"#c3\"> third </a> text</p></div>\n\nWhich resulted in:\n<h1>\n<a name=\"top\"></a>\nTest</h1>\n<div>\n<a href=\"#top\" title=\"link #1\"><strong><em>first</em> link</strong></a>\n\n<a href=\"page.html\">page</a>\n<!-- empty -->\n<a href=\"l1.html\"></a>\n<abbr title=\"something\">smt</abbr><p>more \n<a title=\"\" href=\"#c3\"> third </a>\n text</p></div>\n\n", "Q: How to fix gtk theme?

You'll most likely need to edit the CSS files in the gtk-3.0 subdirectory. \nUse gcolor2 to find out the current colour of the toolbar - say it is #eeefff. Now figure out what you want the colour to be - say #ababab.\nnow you update the files - the easiest way is to just replace all occurances of the old colour with the new:\nfind /usr/share/themes/Cupertino -type f -exec sed -i 's/#eeefff/#ababab/g' {} \\;\n\nof course this will replace the old colour with the new everywhere - which may not be what you want.

Back in 8.04 or so, when PolicyKit was new, we had a GUI \"browser\" that enabled us to easily decide things like whether a user should be allowed to shutdown the system when other users were logged in and if it should always be allowed or only while on the console, etc.\nThen those things suddenly disappeared and though it seems PolicyKit is still in use, I haven't been able to find any similar GUI to actually configure the policies. What happened? \n\nA: Very little information has been available about the long absence of a policykit gui until it was discussed last year at a session of Ubuntu Developer Summit. It was discussed there in detail, and in that 'blueprints' session discussing desktop authorisation it was indeed noted that there \n\nis currently no simplified utility to customize policies\n\nfor policykit. However, an important point arising from the discussion was that \n\nPolicyKit upstream is against something as complex as policykit-1's \"Authorizations\" window\n\nSo it seems this may be one of the problems in implementing such a program. \nNonetheless, it was conceded that the command-line interface available was 'too hard to use' and so while the idea of a policykit gui seems to have been well received, I don't know whether there are any firm intentions to bring back a policykit gui anytime soon; it looks like a wishlist item really. \nHowever, somebody with official connections might be able to give some further useful information on the current situation.\n", "Q: How do I install the drivers?

Just to clarify, I'm not talking about running Ubuntu instead of Android on the Nexus 7 but taking advantage of the Ubuntu on Android project using the Nexus 7. Is it possible?\nAlso, is it in the Software Center right now or is it not ready yet?\n\nA: What is the Ubuntu for Android Project?\nUbuntu's founding company Canonical are working hard to make an installer for mobile devices with multi-core processors. The goal is to reach all devices with more than two processing cores. As described, the focus will be the 'docking' feature, allowing you to 'dock' your device to experience a full-screen computer-styled experienced with a mere handset. Considering this is for all devices, it should be available for both tablet and smartphone - however not much has been revealed to the public at the moment。\nIs the Nexus 7 supported?\nAs of late, no it is not. No devices are currently apart of the Ubuntu for Android project. \nSince there is no way to do this, you may find that replacing Android for Ubuntu is the closest you'll get. If you feel like you wish to install Ubuntu, or find out more about the current development involving the Nexus 7, you can read below:\n\nWhat is currently happening with the Nexus 7 and Ubuntu?\nAt the moment, a developer release of Ubuntu on the Nexus 7 tablet running the nVidia Tegra 3 multi-core processor. The release as stated before is for developers only and not intended for public, commercial or (really) any non-development or -testing related uses.\nThe release is running the alpha of Ubuntu 13.04, codenamed Raring Ringtail. The combination of the premature operating system and the very new adaptation to Android-native devices makes the release very unstable, hence why it is not recommended to regular users.\nThe release is has a simple one-click option for those wishing to attempt to install 13.04 on the Nexus 7 tablet. Tips on installation will be officially available at the non-developer release of the application.\nThis is what it looks like right now:\n\nWhat do I do now?\nThe only thing average users can do is wait. Until a stable, safe, non-developer version is released (possibly by 14.04), it's not advisable that you put your expensive tablet at risk.\nIf you wish to keep researching about the project, you can look here:\nAt a YouTube video, or at this article about the latest version of the Nexus 7 installer on this OMG! Ubuntu! article. There is a picture, also:\n\nIf you wish to install the program despite the risks, you can do so by looking at the following sources below:\nYou can learn how to install the program here or ask on the Ask Ubuntu chatroom.\nGood luck!\nSources include this article from OMG!

So I start Pidgin using this simple script:\n#!/bin/bash\npidgin &\nsleep 6\nwmctrl -c \"Buddy List\"\n\nSleeping is neccessary so the window does not respawn. It is ugly but the best possible for me. Note that it closes the window but does not quit Pidgin.

No clue at all what is happening. .MPG files play just fine.\nThe videos play just fine, with sound, in VLC. \nEDIT: Pausing the video and then starting again brings sound back for about one second, and then the sound fades again.\n\nA: Apparently this is due to Totem not using the correct driver/hardware (somehow that changes without notice). By setting the correct channel in the control center, everything works fine. This is strange, since youtube videos would use the correct channel, while Totem would switch to an incorrect one. \n", "Q: wireless tethering problem on ubuntu 12.04 I'm trying to access the internet on my laptop using wireless tethering option on my android phone.

When I install a virtual machine by using Virtual Box or VMware, is it use my real graphical card? If not, is it possible to use it on a virtual machine? \n\nA: As far as I know, VMWare Workstation has the ability of 3D on VMs, it does not exactly lets the guest system use the card, but does some kind of mapping of the requests of the guest to OpenGL requests on the host (at least in the last time I checked).\nIt has limited 3D ability though.\n\nA: No it's not and it is also may not be possible to connect your graphics card directly to virtual machine.\nI read a long discussion in virtualbox forum, why it can't be done. But it said, those software emulates hardware and drivers (to be used in guest) are written according to that.

I am actually running this particular install in a virtual machine inside VirtualBox but will also apply it later to other \"bare metal\" installs on other machines.\n\nA: You can change the console resolution via GRUB configuration. \nIn the file /etc/default/grub you can find the following lines, near to the end of the file:\n# The resolution used on graphical terminal   \n# note that you can use only modes which your graphic card supports via VBE   \n# you can see them in real GRUB with the command `vbeinfo'   \n# GRUB_GFXMODE=640x480   \n\nUncomment the GRUB_GFXMODE=640x480 line(i.e, remove the # at the beginning).

Thanks!\n\nA: No. Not unless you use a 12.10 64bit disc, which will probably eradicate the 32bit install.\nThe online update system replaces packages with the same architecture, as some 32bit machines won't be able to run the 64bit binaries.

Here is the loop I used:\n# sudo apt-get install ffmpeg lltag eyed3 mp3info id3v2 libimage-exiftool-perl libid3-tools id3tool\n\nkeyword='fill_me_in'\n\ngetTitleFF()   { ffprobe \"$1\" 2>&1 | sed -E -n 's/^ *title *: (.*)/\\1/p'; }\ngetTitleLL()   { lltag --show-tags title \"$1\" | sed -nE 's/^  TITLE=(.*)/\\1/p'; }\ngetTitleEyed() { eyeD3 2>&1 \"$1\" | sed -n 's|\\x1b\\[[0-9;]*mtitle[^:]*: ||p'; }\ngetTitleInfo() { mp3info -p %t \"$1\"; }\ngetTitleId3()  { id3v2 -l \"$1\" | sed -nE 's/^(TIT2 \\([^)]*\\)|Title *): (.*)/\\2/p'; }\ngetTitleExif() { exiftool -title -b \"$1\"; }\ngetTitleId3i() { id3info \"$1\" | sed -nE 's/^=== TIT2 \\([^)]*\\): //p'; }\ngetTitleTool() { id3tool \"$1\" | sed -n 's|^Song Title:\\t||p'; }\n\nfor prog in FF LL Eyed Info Id3 Exif Id3i Tool; do\n    echo \"=== getTitle${prog} ===\"\n    time \\\n    for file in *.mp3; do \n        if \"getTitle${prog}\" \"$file\" | grep -q \"$keyword\"; then \n            echo \"$file\"\n        fi\n    done\ndone\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*lltag and mp3info don't find a title, because the files I was using had ID3v2 tags, see the comment by @s-prasanth: How to read mp3 tags in shell?\n\n*eyeD3 is problematic to use programmatically, because it uses color codes (boldness).\n\n*eyeD3 and also id3v2 (but only for ID3 v1 tags) return the title and the artist on the same line, which further complicates things; therefore getTitleEyed and sometimes getTitleId3 return both the title and the artist, so please don't copy-paste those functions.\n\n*getTitleId3 will only work for ID3 v2 tags, because id3v2 has different formats for ID3v1- and ID3v2-tags, i.e.\nTitle  :                                 Artist:    \n\nvs. ID3v2:\nTIT2 (Title/songname/content description): \n\n\n*As the only program of these 5 eyeD3 prints a red warning for two of the files:\nInvalid mode/bitrate combination for layer II\nNo ID3 v1.x/v2.x tag found!\n\nIt seems like those two files have ID3v1 tags, because those two files are the only ones where lltag and mp3info can get a title. I'm wondering if this is a bug in eyeD3 as no other program mentioned here has a problem with these files ...\nResults (real time):\n Program  | Version    | Time / s\n----------+------------+-----------\n exiftool | 10.25      | 49.5 ± 0.5\n lltag    | 0.14.5     | 41   ± 1.0\n ffprobe  | 3.1.3-1+b3 | 33   ± 0.5\n eyeD3    | 0.6.18     | 24   ± 0.5\n id3info  | 3.8.3      | 4.2  ± 0.1\n id3v2    | 0.1.12     | 2.9  ± 0.1\n id3tool  | 1.2a       | 1.7  ± 0.1\n mp3info  | 0.8.5a     | 1.4  ± 0.1\n\nTime-wise the winner here is id3tool (mp3info is faster, but doesn't work with ID3 v2).\nid3v2 is also quite fast, but the getTitleId3 function would need adjustment to also work with ID3v1-tags, which may at worst slow it down by factor 2.\n\nA: Ok, I found a program by myself. It is called mp3info and installed by\nsudo apt-get install mp3info\n\nTo get single mp3 tags from a file, one has to call\nmp3info -p %a file.mp3\n\nwhich gives the artist of the file. The %a means that one want to get the artist and there are some other keys for the other tags.\n\nA: You can try exiftool(Read and write meta information in files).\n\n\"ExifTool is a platform-independent Perl library plus a command-line application for reading, writing and editing meta information in a wide variety of files.

PhotoRec is not able to recover the original file name, so assigns names to the files in order of recovery - eg. f1234567.mp3.\nI wanted a quick way of reading and listing the ID3 tags so that I could see what the recovered recordings were without having to open, listen to and rename each mp3 file in turn. I'm using Linux Mint 20 ('Ulyana') Cinnamon and have previously  installed the free open source app EasyTAG for editing ID3 tags via a GUI.\nIf you open EasyTAG and navigate to the folder containing the mp3 files, its default behaviour is to list the file name (eg. f1234567.mp3 assigned by PhotoRec) alongside the Song Title (eg. La Vie En Rose) extracted from the Title field of the ID3 tag for all files in that folder. I appreciate that this does not use the shell as stated in the original question, but is an alternative which is incredibly simple to use. Hope this helps.\n\nA: I have the same problem and need some app but I have python on my ubuntu, then I decide to use python. you can use the python package tinytag if you have python on your ubuntu\nfirst, install tinytag using pip\npip install tinytag\n\nnow\nfrom tinytag import TinyTag\ntag = TinyTag.get('/some/music.mp3')\nprint('This track is by %s.' % tag.artist)\nprint('It is %f seconds long.' % tag.duration)\n\n\nA: A python mutagen solution.

What do they mean?\nHow scale option is different from zoom and span? I can't see the difference on any of my wallpapers.\n\nA: To understand the intricacies of the various options available, its worth just having a little dig around in the source-code to see what happens with each option.  I'll try my best to put this is simply as possible, but with the caveat - you need to enjoy a bit of mathematics!\nLets grab the source-code:\n apt-get source gnome-desktop3\n cd gnome-desktop*\n cd libgnome-desktop\n\nNow open the following source-module with your favourite text editor:\n gedit gnome-bg.c\n\nThere are two key functions to examine:\nget_scaled_pixbuf\n\n\nswitch (placement) {\n    case G_DESKTOP_BACKGROUND_STYLE_SPANNED:\n                new = pixbuf_scale_to_fit (pixbuf, width, height);\n        break;\n    case G_DESKTOP_BACKGROUND_STYLE_ZOOM:\n        new = pixbuf_scale_to_min (pixbuf, width, height);\n        break;\n\n    case G_DESKTOP_BACKGROUND_STYLE_STRETCHED:\n        new = gdk_pixbuf_scale_simple (pixbuf, width, height,\n                           GDK_INTERP_BILINEAR);\n        break;\n\n    case G_DESKTOP_BACKGROUND_STYLE_SCALED:\n        new = pixbuf_scale_to_fit (pixbuf, width, height);\n        break;\n\n    case G_DESKTOP_BACKGROUND_STYLE_CENTERED:\n    case G_DESKTOP_BACKGROUND_STYLE_WALLPAPER:\n    default:\n        new = pixbuf_clip_to_fit (pixbuf, width, height);\n        break;\n    }\n\n\nand the function:\ndraw_image_area\n\n\nswitch (bg->placement) {\n    case G_DESKTOP_BACKGROUND_STYLE_WALLPAPER:\n        pixbuf_tile (scaled, dest);\n        break;\n    case G_DESKTOP_BACKGROUND_STYLE_ZOOM:\n    case G_DESKTOP_BACKGROUND_STYLE_CENTERED:\n    case G_DESKTOP_BACKGROUND_STYLE_STRETCHED:\n    case G_DESKTOP_BACKGROUND_STYLE_SCALED:\n        pixbuf_blend (scaled, dest, 0, 0, w, h, x + area->x, y + area->y, 1.0);\n        break;\n    case G_DESKTOP_BACKGROUND_STYLE_SPANNED:\n        pixbuf_blend (scaled, dest, 0, 0, w, h, x, y, 1.0);\n        break;\n    default:\n        g_assert_not_reached ();\n        break;\n    }\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Lets first look at the option SPAN\nThis is described by the case option G_DESKTOP_BACKGROUND_STYLE_SPANNED\nThe wallpaper (pixbuf) is first scaled to the area to be filled (pixbuf_scale_to_fit) i.e. take the original wallpaper and expand its width and height to match the area. \nIt uses the following algorithm to expand:\n\nfactor = MIN (max_width  / src_width, max_height / src_height);\nnew_width  = floor (src_width * factor + 0.5);\nnew_height = floor (src_height * factor + 0.5);\n\n\nsrc_ is the wallpaper dimension width or height, whereas max_ is the area dimension width or height\nQuite a complicated algorithm as you can see, but basically it tries to see what is the minimum dimension that needs to be expanded before scaling both dimensions linearly by the same factor it has calculated.\nThis area is the combined area of your monitor or monitors.\nThe resulting wallpaper (pixbuf) is then blended with the desktop background colour for the whole area.\n\n\n*\n\n*Lets look at the option SCALE\nThis is described by the case option G_DESKTOP_BACKGROUND_STYLE_SCALED\nAs you can see in the source code, its very similar to SPAN.  It uses the same algorithm to scale the picture as SPAN.  \nThe resulting wallpaper (pixbuf) is then blended with the desktop background colour for the view port area i.e. not the combined area of all monitors, but the area of each monitor individually.\n\n\n*\n\n*Lets look at the option Zoom\nThis is described by the case option G_DESKTOP_BACKGROUND_ZOOM\nThe wallpaper (pixbuf) is first scaled to the area to be filled (pixbuf_scale_to_min) i.e. take the original wallpaper and expand its width and height to match the area. \nIt uses the following algorithm to expand:\n\nfactor = MAX (min_width / src_width, min_height / src_height);\n\nnew_width = floor (src_width * factor + 0.5);\nnew_height = floor (src_height * factor + 0.5);\n\nsrc_ is the wallpaper dimension width or height, whereas max_ is the area dimension width or height*\nNotice the subtle difference than the previous two options - it calculates the maximum dimension that needs to be expanded before scaling both dimensions linearly by the same factor it has calculated.\nThe resulting wallpaper (pixbuf) is then blended with the desktop background colour for the view port area i.e. not the combined area of all monitors, but the area of each monitor individually.\n\n\n*\n\n*Lets look at the option STRETCH\nThis is described by the case option G_DESKTOP_BACKGROUND_STRETCHED\nThe wallpaper (pixbuf) is expanded both width-wise and height-wise to the area - thus you can get a distortion if your wallpaper is not the exact dimensions of the wallpaper \nThe resulting wallpaper (pixbuf) is then blended with the desktop background colour for the view port area i.e. not the combined area of all monitors, but the area of each monitor individually.\n\n\n*\n\n*Lets look at the option CENTER\nThis is described by the case option G_DESKTOP_BACKGROUND_CENTRED\nThe wallpaper (pixbuf) is actually clipped to size if its too large to fit the area i.e. the the width is reduced to the area width and the height is reduced to the area height.\nThe resulting wallpaper (pixbuf) is then blended with the desktop background colour for the view port area i.e. not the combined area of all monitors, but the area of each monitor individually.  The resulting image is then drawn into the center of the overall area of the monitor.\n\n\n*\n\n*Lets look at the option TILE\nThis is described by the case option G_DESKTOP_BACKGROUND_WALLPAPER\nThe wallpaper (pixbuf) is similarly clipped as the Center option.\nThe resulting wallpaper (pixbuf) is then blended with the desktop background colour for the view port area i.e. not the combined area of all monitors, but the area of each monitor individually.  The resulting image is copied repeatedly starting in one corner filling the overall area with each image i.e. tiled width-wise and height-wise.\n\nA: This is going to be tricky to see but...\n\n\n*\n\n*Tile - tiles an image, like tiles on a floor, try a really small images, like 100x100. see for examples\n\n*Zoom - Zooms on an image so that the largest dimension is now the largest dimension of the desktop. For example a 200x100 image on a 800x600 desktop would be zoomed to 800x400, leaving 200px of empty space. \n\n*Fill -  basically \"scales\" to the width of your monitor. Ignoring height. so if you have a 1000x1000 resolution and a 600x500 image, the image will be scaled to 1200x1000 and centered cutting off the top and bottom a bit.\n\n*Span - is like Scale but across multiple monitors. So if you have 2 800x600s and a 1600x600 image you can \"span\" it across both monitors\n\n*Center - is for undersized images (though larger one works) that place the image in the center of a single monitor.\n\n*Scale - \"resizes\" the image. Making it exactly the same size as your desktop. So a 800x600 desktop will 'scale' a 900x200 image to exactly 800x600, and distortion be damned.\n\n\nSorry I can't provide samples other then tile, but the images depend strongly on your monitor. You should be able to easily see the options in effect if you use a seriously undersized and bad aspect ration image to test with. \n\nA: From my observations on multiple images : \n\n\n*\n\n*Center : places the image at the centre of the desktop, keeping its original size.\n\n*Tile : tiles the image, like tiles on a floor, keeping the image original size.\n\n*Fill : stretches (or reduces) the image to match the screen, but does not care about keeping proportions.\n\n*Zoom : stretches (or reduces) the image, keeping proportions, so as the background is completely filled. When the image and the screen have different proportions it will cut off the extra bands that cannot be fitted (top and bottom or left and right depending on the image).\n\n*Scale : also stretches (or reduces) the image, keeping proportions, but makes sure the image fully fits in the screen area. When the image and the screen have different proportions it will thus allow empty bands on the sides (again, top and bottom or left and right depending on the image).\n\n*Span : no idea. Seems like Scale. I suppose  Coteyr has it right, and that it does the same as Scale but for multiple screens.\n\n", "Q: How to adjust IRQ priority in Ubuntu 12.04? The question says it all. I see some tutorials online for earlier editions of Ubuntu, but am having a hard time for 12.04.\n\nA: Questions like this are very important when running pro audio applications. As you see, and as I have experienced myself many times in the past, Askubuntu.com has a tendency to tell us that we don't need an answer to these kinds of questions. For these narrowly focused questions, you'll find more friendly help on places like the LinuxMusicians forum or the OpenSourceMusicians IRC channel (# opensourcemusicians). \nI run KX Studio (which is a pro audio distribution on top of Kubuntu) and I have gotten a lot of help at both #kxstudio and #ardour IRC channels.\nAnyway, here's how you do it now that I have figured it out with help from the above resources.\nUse these commands to discover the USB bus and IRQ of your audio device:\n\n\n*\n\n*lsusb (or lsusb -t)\n\n*lspci (or lspci -v)\n\n*cat /proc/interrupts\n\n\nIn my case, my USB audio interface is ehci_hcd:usb2 on IRQ 23. It may not be easy to figure it out, but if you cross reference the above listings you'll figure out which IRQ is of interest after some detective work. See below for more tips.\nNext, install rtirq\nSee the Ubuntu Wiki:\nhttps://wiki.edubuntu.org/UbuntuStudio/rtirq\nNow edit the file /etc/default/rtirq (as sudo). And look for the line that contains RTIRQ_NAME_LIST=\nIf you want IRQ 23 to have the highest priority, add it to the front of the list like so:\nRTIRQ_NAME_LIST=\"23 usb i8042 snd\"\n\nHowever, in my case, I would rather use the name of the device in case the IRQ assignment changes for some unknown reaason. So I specify it like this:\nRTIRQ_NAME_LIST=\"ehci_hcd:usb2 usb i8042 snd\"\n\nJust put the device (or IRQ) at the front of the list for highest priority. It is a space delimited list.\nSave the file, then run:\nsudo /etc/init.d/rtirq restart\n\nThere is no need to reboot. You'll see the resulting IRQ priorities listed from the command above. But if you want to see them again later, run:\nsudo /etc/init.d/rtirq status\n\nAnd check cat /proc/interrupts if desired.\nSome extra tips, as promised:\nUsing lsusb I found that my audio interface was on USB Bus 001 Device 003. \nNext, using lspci -v I found that I have 3 USB controllers. I found one listed like this: 00:1d.0 USB controller: Intel Corporation 6 Series/C200 Series Chipset Family USB Enhanced Host Controller #1. The flags in that listed included these: Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 0, IRQ 23. So, assuming I picked the right USB controller (the one controlling Bus 01), those flags told me that I am interested in IRQ 23.\nNext, /proc/interrupts told me that IRQ 23 has the device name ehci_hcd:usb2 associated with it.\nI also used tree /sys/bus/usb/drivers/usb/ and cat /proc/asound/cards to cross reference info to pick the correct USB controller.\nYou might also find the following Perl script useful:\nrealTimeConfigQuickScan.pl\n\nA: There is generally no need to adjust IRQ priority unless you are having particular problems and want to apply boot options such as irqpoll and others listed at the Ubuntu wiki. It is best to let the kernel manage them or look in your bios for any options as that will be the best place for configuration.\nHowever, you are probably referring to the hwtools package that was available before even Hardy (8.04) and which contained the irqtune program; this utility let you tweak the IRQs of serial devices such as modems, which was said in the past to sometimes improve performance. Serial ports are rarely used these days, but there may be settings in the bios to both enable/disable and tweak them.\nHowever, there is a program in the repositories called irqbalance, which is designed only for multi-core CPUS. There is more information here, but it may not be appropriate for you as it is more to do with balancing server load.\nIf you want to list your IRQ ports in Ubuntu you can run cat /proc/interrupts or install the next generation version of the procinfo program and run that and the accompanying lsdev to gain further information. Here is some sample output of procinfo, very much curtailed, which will help identify your IRQs:\nirq   0:         49  timer               irq  15:      30500  pata_sis         \nirq   1:      18634  i8042               irq  17:      78117  firewire_ohci, ye\nirq   6:          3  floppy              irq  18:         82  snd_intel8x0     \n\n", "Q: How to uninstall GMail webapp?

It's a SOLA 330 with serial out.\nI have installed NUT Metapackage and NUT Monitor from Software Centre, but am not sure how to go about setting it all up. A Google search brings up several ways of configuring Network UPS Tools (NUT) or HAL-Drivers, however, HAL-Drivers appears to be obsolete and many commands and config files mentioned to edit do not exist in 12.10 or the current version of NUT (most articles are a few years old). One tutorial seemed to work except the Error: no UPS definitions found in ups.conf even though ups.conf has values in it as laid out in the tutorial.\nHow do I go about setting my system to monitor the UPS for a shut down signal? Also, is there a command to determine the UPS is communicating through the serial connection and on what port (to help with setup and configuring, eg. /dev/ttyS0 is mentioned in one of the tutorials I read).\n\nA: Found some very helpful sites that got me going. The one I found most helpful was on Linux.com (http://archive09.linux.com/feature/128099).

Also, networkupstools.org (http://www.networkupstools.org/stable-hcl.html) helped me select the correct driver name for my UPS model.

Currently in Ubuntu 12.10 we have very few GTK3 themes upgraded to version 3.6 in addition to the default Ambiance theme.\nWhen you maximize an application window, you have only the toolbar below the Unity panel, which assumes the functionality of both title and menubars.\nBut this may create a problem in some themes where the bgcolor of the Unity panel does not match very well with the bgcolor of the toolbar.\nFor example, Greybird theme doesn't have this problem, and it has the following code in \"unity.css\":\n.unity-panel {\n    background-image: -gtk-gradient(linear, left top, left bottom,\n                                     from (shade(@theme_bg_color, 1.2)),\n                                     to (shade(@theme_bg_color, 1.0)));\n\nBut another theme has this code in \"gtk-apps.css\":\n.unity-panel {\n    background-image: -gtk-gradient (linear, left top, left bottom,\n                                     from (shade (@theme_bg_color, 1.1)),\n                                     to (@toolbar_gradient_start));\n\nAnd this produces a unity panel much lighter than the toolbar unlike Greybird. And using Greybird's code or changing the value 1.1 doesn't make any difference.\nThe questions is; how can I make the second theme have a Unity panel with a darker grey bgcolor?\n\nA: The problem that was causing this theme to be unresponsive to changes in the values that affect the bgcolor of the unity-panel was apparently (as far as I could figure out by trial-and-error) int the Gnome Panel section which was included in the same \"gtk-apps.css\" file, which was resolved when I deleted this entire section, which was not needed under Unity anyway.\n", "Q: How to take screenshot of an X11 based GUI from a text terminal (such as tty1)?

Quote:\n\nQ-108: I use Linux Virtual Terminals (VT's) to implement 'Fast User Switching' between users' sessions (e.g. Betty is on Ctrl-Alt-F7, Bobby is on Ctrl-Alt-F8, and Sid is on Ctrl-Alt-F1: they use those keystrokes to switch between their sessions.)   How come the view in a VNC viewer connecting to x11vnc is either completely black, doesn't update, or pixels messed up unless the X session x11vnc is attached to is in the active VT?\nThis seems to have to do with how applications (the X server processes in this case) must \"play nicely\" if they are not on the active VT (sometimes called VC for virtual console.) That is, they should not read from the keyboard or mouse or manage the video display unless they have the active VT. Given that it appears the XGetImage() call must ultimately retrieve the framebuffer data from the video hardware itself, it would make sense x11vnc's polling wouldn't work unless the X session had active control of the VT.\nThere does not seem to be an easy way to work around this. Even xwd(1) doesn't work in this case (try it.) Something would need to be done at a lower level, say in the XFree86/Xorg X server. Also, using the Shadow Framebuffer (a copy of the video framebuffer is kept in main memory) does not appear to fix the problem (last checked 2007.)\nIf no one is sitting at the workstation and you just want to remotely switch the VT over to the one associated with your X session (so x11vnc can poll it correctly), one can use the chvt(1) command, e.g. \"chvt 7\" for VT #7.\n\n", "Q: create PPA source package from existing .deb package i wanna modify some files in .deb package and upload it to my PPA,\nis that possible and how to ?\nThanks in advance\n\nA: No, this is not possible.\nA binary Debian package contains built binaries only and there is no way to retrieve sources from binaries as a lot of information is lost during the process.\nIf you were to edit only data that are not modified by the compilation process (say configuration files for instance) then you would be able to generate a new .deb file from the old one. However, you will not be allowed to upload this one to your PPA for safety reasons. All the packages in the PPA's must be compiled on the servers sandboxes to prevent malicious modifications of packages.

Currently the last part of the username (after the 20th digit) is hidden behind the Ubuntu-icon which enables switching to Unity 2D.\nAnother option would be to decrease the font-size of the username, is any of this possible?\nBtw this is not an issue in Ubuntu 12.10, where the username font-size is smaller, and Unity 2D unsupported!\n\nA: You cannot shrink the font in the user box without a re-compile of the greeter unfortunately. If you don't ever want to use Unity-2d, you can simply rename the ubuntu-2d desktop file.  I don't have a 12.04 system handy, but I think the file is ubuntu-2d.desktop, it lives in /usr/share/xsessions:\nsudo mv /usr/share/xsessions/ubuntu-2d.desktop /usr/share/xsessions/ubuntu-2d.desktop.OLD\n\nAfter you do that you need to reboot or restart lightdm from a virtual terminal. Here's one thing to note, in 12.10, the session chooser is hidden if there's only one session, I'm not sure that's true in 12.04, but try it and let me know and I can edit my answer.\n\nA: The session chooser is still present (but shows only one item) in 12.04 if the /usr/share/xsessions directory contains only one .desktop entry.\n", "Q: How do I let other users access my /media/[username]/HARDDRIVE with Ubuntu 12.10? I am trying to let other users access my external 1TB NTFS hard drive mounted automatically at /media/[username]/STORAGE\nThe problem is that by default, udisk2 (present with Ubuntu 12.10) automatically creates:\n\n\n*\n\n*/media/[username] with chown: root:root and chmod: 700\n\n*/media/[username]/STORAGE with chown: [username]:[username] and chmod: 700\n\n\nTherefore no other user can access it, not even the UPnP server if it is running as a different user than [username].\nOf course I could, just chmod everything this time but if I umount and mount then the default permissions will be back on and I'll have the same issue.\nThe answer probably has to do with a permissions to add in /etc/udev/rules.d/ but I am not an expert. \nCan you help?\n\nA: You need to add an entry in fstab to tell it where to mount, and also tell it what permissions it should have.  Currently you're letting it automount which is limiting other user's ability to access it.\nAs near as I can judge, you should add an entry to /etc/fstab which looks like:\nLABEL=STORAGE /media/username/STORAGE ntfs-3g  dmask=111 fmask=111  0   0 \n\nWhich should give everyone all access to the files and directories except for execute.  If you want others to be able to read but not write you would use a dmask/fmask of 113.  The mask is the exact opposite of the permissions that you want to allow (that's why it's called a mask).  Each number is the octal representation of the binary permissions:\n000 = 000 000 000\n111 = 001 001 001\n777 = 111 111 111\n\nand these bits read\nrwx(owner) rwx(group) rwx(world)\n\nNormal permissions to allow anyone to do anything at all are 777 (dangerous!)  however if you give 777 as the dmask, it makes the actual permissions 000.\nNote that LABEL=STORAGE relies on the drive having the label \"STORAGE\" that fstab can use as a hook.  This way, any device that you plug in with the label \"STORAGE\" will be mounted this way.  \n", "Q: Automated package build service I´m using Bacula for backuping my servers and clients, but the versions of bacula in the official repository are very old. So I compiled and installed all the components by myself.\nBut that was very much work and it is also very much work when I want to update the components.\nIs there a possibility for an automated build service that creates new packages when a new update of bacula realeases? (maybe in combination with git)\nAnd how can I deploy the created packages with a foreign source to my servers and clients?\ngreetings \nNico\n\nA: One possibility would be the creation of a Personal Package Archive (PPA) to Bacula. Basically you provide the source and instructions on how to build Bacula and the packages are built remotely. If you add that PPA to all your machines, after a successfully build they are seen as updates.\nI haven't created any PPA, so i cant ensure you this fits exactly you need and how hard it is. You can find more info here.\nAnother option would be using a continuous integration tool like Jenkins, to constantly watch a repository and when it founds a new version, downloads the sources and build it. \nHope this helps.\nEdit\nHere you can find a very complete answer with the steps needed to create a PPA. Also this shows how to automatically checkout code.\nCredits to Khurshid Alam and George Edison.\n", "Q: How do I use a different drive as an installation location for Steam? I recently got an invitation for Steam. I want to download games but my SSD drive which I have Ubuntu will not be enough. How can I install Steam on a different hard drive?\nI went into the \"Steam Library Folders\" but I can't delete the original folder so steam can install on that drive. I have also tried to change the place but it is again on the down side:\n\n\nA: Some points not addressed in the above answers:\n\n\n*\n\n*While Steam lets you create multiple libraries, it appears some games can only be installed in the primary library. I suspect this applies to games (eg, those using the Source engine like TF2) with shared content.\n\n*Using a symlink to move the SteamApps library folder out of the Steam directory causes problems, since some games appear for whatever reason not to follow symlinks. Certainly this TF2 bug is related, but others may also be. (It appears you can do this successfully using a bind mount, but this is unnecessary - see below).\nHowever, to answer the original question - you can just move the Steam folder entirely to a new location (eg, to move it to /opt/Steam):\nsudo mv ~/.local/share/Steam /opt\n\nOnce it is moved, attempt to start Steam (using the Unity icon or /usr/bin/steam). You will get a message:\nCouldn't find Steam content, did you move it?\n\nWhich will let you select the new Steam directory. Subsequently it will start normally.\n\n\n*\n\n*This worked moving Steam to another ext4 filesystem. I do not know whether this will work if you change the permissions or attempt to use a non-linux filesystem.\n\n*I have not tried sharing a library directory between Windows and Linux steam. I suspect this would end badly.\n\n*Moving the Steam directory will usually make SteamGuard require an unlock code the next time you start Steam.\n\nA: Apparently it gives you the option when downloading a game.\n\nI have not tried this myself but I don't see any reason it wouldn't be straight forward. But reportedly it only works for games that uses the new content system.\n\nA: Steam lets you define what they call \"Steam Library Folders\". In the steam client go to the \"Steam\" menu item, and select \"Settings\", the go Downloads+Cloud tab:\n\nClick on \"Steam Library Folders\" and adjust accordingly:\n\nTo move a game's installation files from one folder to another, go to \"Library\", find the game, right-click on it, select \"Properties\", click the \"Local files\" tab, and click \"Move install folder...\".\n\n\nA: I usually resolve these problems by mounting the default folder to another location. That way it's completely transparent to the application as it just use the normal filesystem (no symlink).\nYou can do it temporarly with mount:\nsudo mount -o bind /your/preffered/folder /home/you/.steam/steam\n\nOr make it permanent in /etc/fstab:\n/your/preffered/folder /home/you/.steam/steam none bind\n\n\nA: The easiest way is to move your steam home folder to that new drive and create a link for it, as \"Steam Library Folders\" is relatively new feature and doesn't work with all games.\n\nA: You may want to create the new library folder and try manually moving the content. It's best to test this with a single, smaller, game rather than the entire 21GB. \n\nA: For it dosent work. When i instaled first time Steam i could to instal games in another disk space it was all ok, After instalation i turned on games and playing few houers. Next step i had to reset my PC after rebooting there was no games instaled on my steam. What can i do is to install again games on my disk where is the system. I cant change location. It strange becouse games are on my difrent location instaled properly but steam whant to instal them again.\n", "Q: Which filesystem should I use? I recently formatted my drive and now it appears as unallocated space in gparted. I want to use the drive for all my files, steam and game installation, to keep my SSD as empty as possible. What filesystem type should I use? \n\nA: If you don't plan on sharing this drive with Windows, then ext4 will be the best option.  \nBut, in case you have plans on dual-booting with Windows, then it is better to format the drive as ntfs, as this is accessible by both Ubuntu and Windows. But, be aware that file permissions may not work properly in an ntfs File System .\n\nA: Do you have any specific needs for the drive? If you don't have a specific need you know about, use ext4. It's modern, uses extents and has journaling. It's also a descendant of ext2 and ext3, which are relatively well tested. I personally used Reiser4 a lot, but not since it stopped being installed by default by distributions. My answer “use ext4” might sound boring, but many of the exciting filesystems out there are generally less tested and gains (without a specific need) are questionable.\n", "Q: SSD caching (e.g. ASUS P9X79 WS) ‒ possible on Ubuntu? Some motherboards such as ASUS P9X79 WS support something called “ASUS SSD caching”. You can connect 1 HDD and 1 SSD to 2 designated SATA ports, and IUUC, you can have a setup in which the motherboard will automatically cache (on the SSD) the most often used data stored on the HDD. It allows you to take advantage of the SSD speed and HDD capacity at the same time.\nI saw a presentation on YouTube, in which they show how to set it up using a program running on Windows. I'm curious if this is really a hardware solution (can be used on Linux), or is it partially in software? If it were just hardware, you could install Windows, run the utility to set up SSD caching, and then install Ubuntu, benefiting from the caching setup? (Also, if it's a hardware solution, why not set it up in right in the BIOS?)\n\nA: I too have been considering options for the SSD on my HP Envy 6. You might want to read this article on Phornix discussing bcache.  Bcache \"is a Linux kernel block layer cache. It allows one or more fast disk drives such as flash-based solid state drives (SSDs) to act as a cache for one or more slower hard disk drives.\"\nBefore you jump in with bcache, I would highly suggest reading the \"Getting started\" section in their documentation.  They way I read it is that the entire SSD must be used for the cache (unlike Intel Smart Caching which can use subsets of the drive).\nThere are also a few posts about this topic here:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1933890\nI have been waiting to see how this project matures before implementing it on my system. As an alternative, you could put the OS on the SSD and /home on the hard drive. There are several suggestions on how to optimize performance in this configuration (e.g. see here); however, the only option I have enabled is the discard line in /etc/fstab as other reading has indicated many of the other changes may not be necessary.\n\nA: See How do I install and use flashcache/bcache to cache HDD to SSD? which explains how to install bcache and other Linux-native hybrid block devices.\n", "Q: Additional drivers page shows nothing at all. (Not an nVidia problem) I just reinstalled Ubuntu 12.10 because before the additional drivers page showed absolutely nothing. During the new install, I made sure to click install 3rd party software (I hadn't clicked this last time and thought that might be the problem).\nHowever, when I was trying to connect to my wifi it didn't work (because of my router only allowing 5 people on at a time), so I said don't connect now. I planned to connect later and install the 3rd party software (what I assume contains the list for proprietary drivers).\nIs there any way to get my list of \"additional drivers\" to show something? I thought maybe I could install updates and get it to work (but that didn't work last time.. But last time I also hadn't checked install 3rd party software..). I don't want to install updates if it won't work because my Internet is pretty slow.\nAlso, I have it set to check for updates once a day, but if updating is the solution then how do I choose to check for updates now instead of waiting for later?\nIf doing another reinstall of Ubuntu with wifi working is the solution then I'll be more than happy to do that. Someone please point me in the right direction!\nThanks\nEdit1: I figured out how to check for updates immediately. I went to the top left on the unity taskbar and clicked the Dash Home icon. Typed in \"software\" and \"software updater\" popped up. That lets you install software updates immediately.\nAlso, when I looked into Ubuntu's software update settings, the box for installing proprietary drivers was checked, so hopefully this update will also get me the list of drivers. I'll edit again when the update is finished.\nEdit2: The updates have finished installing and I restarted my computer, but there are still no options listed in the additional drivers menu. Does anyone know what I can do to see some optional drivers? I have an ATI HD 4200 in my laptop that I would really like the graphics drivers for.\n\nA: I'm having the same issue trying to fix a graphics driver problem causing Ubuntu to crash upon login. Solved it by accident! I attempted to install some language updates, then went to the Software and Updates tab and tried to click X to close out of frustration. It then asked me to update, I accepted and upon reentering the list appeared. Try installing and update in general and try closing the tab to see if it asks you.

Without affecting the quality too much, what is an easy quick way to re-encode these files to smaller files?\nThe original files are MP4 files from my camcorder.\n\nA: Have a look at DeVeDe video creator.  It's in the repositories and I've used it for making .iso files prior to burning them to disk.  Most photographers/vidographers would shudder at the thought of permanently altering the original since anything you do to is is going to change or degrade it in some way.  The MP4 is already a compressed format, so any further compression you achieve is going to be lossy.\nConsider backing up your important original files on an external medium to free up space on your hard drive.  I'd recommend a portable hard drive - I actually have two hard drives with my original photographs and all subsequent work.  One is used as an off-site backup and gets rotated regularly with the current backup.\n\nA: I recommend backing your videos up to an external Hard Drive, but if you can't or don't want to do that, WebM is the smallest video format I've come across.  I use Oggconvert to convert video files (like MP4) to ogg and WebM.\nsudo apt-get install oggconvert\n\nTo convert an MP4, select 'source' and locate the file you want to convert..\n \nAfter you have selected your file, change 'video format' to 'VP8'.

I then changed the path to //xx.xx.xx.xx/PRINTER-NAME (where xx.xx.xx.xx is you IP address of the computer the printer is connected to).  Now it prints fine.\nMy printer Settings are below and are based on a HP K550:\nDevice URI: smb://192.168.1.3/HP_K550\nMake and Model: HP Officejet Pro k550, hpcups 3.12.6\n\nA: *\n\n*Goto Page preview\n\n*Select print from printer icon\n\n\nAfter that It will be ok and you will can print again from the main Print option\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.10 Quantal Quetzal and AMD 12.11 Beta Driver I'm using a Quantal AMDx64 install and a XFX Radeon HD5850 video card. I first enabled restricted drivers through additional drivers, but it resulted in breaking Unity and Compiz (I can only see my wallpaper and shortcuts. But the terminal still works and Nautilus too, however, without Close/Maximize/Minimize and slower). Then I uninstalled it and everything went back to normal. Then I installed it via terminal (12.10 version), and the result was the same. Then I downloaded it via ATI's web site (12.11 beta) and installed the .run file using the terminal, but the result was yet again the same. Then I went to the terminal and entered these commands:\naticonfig --help\nused the command it said it should be used to set the card for the first time\naticonfig --initial\ncompiz --replace - It gave me a driver error, the OpenGL doesn't work\nunity - Same thing\nAnd I also got the \"AMD Testing Only\" watermark.\nSide notes: My Ubuntu is installed on a ext4 partition with 60GB, and I dual boot with Windows 7 (at least for now). \nMy internet is a 50kbps 3G-ish, so downloading even small files is a pain, let alone a video driver. I would rather not reinstall the O.S., it was a herculean task to download everything I had in there, and I have very little free disk space for backups.\nI'm still new to Ubuntu (I know some basic commands), and I don't know how to debug, so please, be patient XD.\nThanks in advance. If you need any info, just ask (and explain how to get it XD).\nUPDATE\nI just installed the restricted-updates driver too, but the result was the same.\nNow I found the Xorg.2.log, but the site doesn't let me post it here, so I'll have to ask me to look for specific parts of it.\n\nA: You might need to first completely uninstall fglrx, then install the linux headers\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic\n\nThen try to either use fglrx-updates from Additional Drivers or Catalyst 12.11 beta from AMD's site (this won't fix the watermark, though).\n", "Q: Problems updating and re-installing VLC in Ubuntu 11.10 I can't seem to fix or update, upgrade VLC at all; this is what I get when trying to install, I had VLC before, but was not working properly so I uninstalled it; then I tried to install it again to have the full properties.

I have heard that displaylink docks do not work but adapters do. Since these have 2 outputs, I wasn't sure if they are compatible with Ubuntu 12.10. Any Help? If these won't work what will?\nThanks\n\nA: So, what I found when using a DisplayLink USB monitor is that I could start X on the monitor fine, because DisplayLink has support in the kernel, but I (1) couldn't use my graphics card's acceleration, (2) couldn't easily have the display extend from one regular monitor to the DisplayLink. I was able to eventually get it working, sort of, using screenclone but I couldn't move windows between monitors, get compositing to work, or use xrandr at all. See these questions for some details on setting it up:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I use a DisplayLink monitor?\n\n*How do I configure a displaylink USB monitor?\nIt looks like there is a project to get this working better called hybrid-screenclone which will make it easier to do some of the hacks I described.\nUltimately, I would advise against a DisplayLink setup unless you're willing to try some hacks and experimental proding, and still possibly be let down. Though the chances if you getting it working if you don't want to also use a regular monitor are much better.\n", "Q: Hi ,I just bought an asus F55A but i can not enter bios? Hi everybody I just bought an Asus F55A but I can not enter in bios or boot the linux usb before startup as i did before with my old asus k50c by pressing F2 for entering bios and CTRL+ESC+F1 to choose what to boot first the usb or the hard drive,can somebody help me please ????  \n\nA: The manual does not state how to enter BIOS setup.  No doubt they expect you to be able to read the instructions when it flashes up on the screen momentarily.  It turns out the key to enter BIOS is Del.   The key to enter the boot menu (very hand to know) is just Esc.  Both of these are very common keys for Asus machines.\n", "Q: When i start my laptop i have a choice of three ubuntu operating systems how can i remove this? Only 1 works and the other 2 don't.I want to get rid of these other 2, also the Ubuntu i am running on now I want it to be the only operating system as i also got windows 7. Is there anyway i can do this with using a CD. \n\nA: It sounds like you did a wubi install, where you install inside the windows file system.  To fix the problem try the answer(s) on this question.\nTo install Ubuntu as the only operating  system you would need to use the bootable LiveCD and and boot off it to replace the operating system.  Make sure you back up all your important data before you do this as you will be starting from scratch with the \"use entire hard drive\" option. \n", "Q: What version of adobe flash player should i download for the latest linux? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I install Adobe Flash player? \n\nyum for Linux\ntarget for other Linux\nrpm for other Linux \napt for Ubuntu 10/04+\ni don't have a clue what is going on \n\nA: You shouldn't download anything.

It is designed to provide DNS and, optionally, DHCP, to a small network. It can serve the names of local machines which are not in the global DNS. The DHCP server integrates with the DNS server and allows machines with DHCP-allocated addresses to appear in the DNS with names configured either in each host or in a central configuration file. Dnsmasq supports static and dynamic DHCP leases and BOOTP/TFTP/PXE for network booting of diskless machines.\nSource:www.thekelleys.org.uk \n", "Q: Update Manager Ubuntu 12.10 (1) Failed to fetch cdrom: (2) Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/jonls/ \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow can I fix a 404 Error using a PPA? \n\nPlease guide how to solve problem described below:\nERROR received while running Update Manager in UBUNTU 12.10: \nW:Failed to fetch cdrom://Ubuntu 11.10 _Oneiric Ocelot_ - Release i386 (20111012)/dists/oneiric/main/binary-i386/Packages  Please use apt-cdrom to make this CD-ROM recognized by APT. apt-get update cannot be used to add new CD-ROMs\n, W:Failed to fetch cdrom://Ubuntu 11.10 _Oneiric Ocelot_ - Release i386 (20111012)/dists/oneiric/restricted/binary-i386/Packages  Please use apt-cdrom to make this CD-ROM recognized by APT. apt-get update cannot be used to add new CD-ROMs\n, W:Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/jonls/redshift-ppa/ubuntu/dists/quantal/main/source/Sources  404  Not Found\n, W:Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/jonls/redshift-ppa/ubuntu/dists/quantal/main/binary-i386/Packages  404  Not Found\n, E:Some index files failed to download.

I would like it to output the processor temperatures in degrees Fahrenheit instead of Celsius.\nIn the ~/.conkyrc file, the command sensors | grep 'Core 0' | cut -c18-19 is used to find the temperature in Celsius  for the first processor core.  I want to use bc to compute this (give it outputvalue*9/5+32).\nProblem is, bc wants just absolute values, and I see no way to pass it program output.  If I try to use something like temp=$(sensors | grep 'Core 0' | cut -c18-19) & echo 'temp*9/5+32' | bc, it ends up giving me 32 because it registers \"temp\" as a 0.\n\nA: According to the Conky help, you can specify this in the config file  ~/.conkyrc\nQuote:\n\ntemperature_unit\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Desired output unit of all objects displaying a temperature.

However, I can not find the experimental driver, and when I use the  stable version of that driver, the top bar does not show and the Unity launcher does not show up. On top of that, when I try to install the AMD drivers from the AMD site, it gives me the error One or more tools required for installation cannot be found on the system. Install the required tools before installing the fglrx driver. Optionally, run the installer with the --force option to install without the tools. Forcing install will disable AMD hardware acceleration and may make your system unstable. Not recommended. See /usr/share/ati/fglrx-install.log for more details. I checked the directory and sure enough, it said Supported adapter detected.\nCheck if system has the tools required for installation.\nfglrx installation requires that the system have kernel headers.  /lib/modules/3.5.0-20-generic/build/include/linux/version.h cannot be found on this system.\nOne or more tools required for installation cannot be found on the system.

I have gnome classic, cinnamon, unity, gnome 3, and KDE installed on my only user account because I enjoy a little change from time to time (although my favorite is gnome classic) so I installed all of these desktop environments. I heard from a friend that it could potentially cause some problems. I was also told that it would be okay if I created a separate account for each environment, but I don't want to if I don't have to.\nAny help is much appreciated, thank you.\n\nA: The main problem that I see is that if you play with a lot of compiz settings, then you may find that these settings cause problems between (say) gnome classic and gnome3.  In past these kinds conflicts have mostly manifested themselves in the form of missing Unity Launchers and panels, requiring these settings to be reset to defaults.\nIf you do some research into where the settings for each environment are stored and whether or not compiz is even used, you should be able to head off any serious problems or at least have an understanding of why they have occurred.\nI'd recommend that you pick an environment and stay with it, or use different users for each one so that the configurations files cannot conflict.  Since I actually do this frequently when testing development releases I know how much of pain changing users actually is, hence my recommendation to stay with one environment.\n", "Q: If format my system and install ubuntu as only OS what will to happen hard disk drives? At this time I am running windows and I want install ubuntu instead of windows. My concern is that if I install ubuntu what will happen to the hard disk drives(C, D, E etc).\nCan you also tell me that how to format the system after booting from a USB Stick?? \n\nA: If you install Ubuntu as the only operating system on the hard drive (install option \"use all of the hard drive\" then it will repartition your hard drive and format it completely.  It will warn you of this, however you have to read the screen carefully. You should back up all of your important data to an external hard drive from which you can recover your data after you have installed Ubuntu.\nUbuntu/Linux doesn't treat hard drives and partitions the way Windows does - there are no drive letters (C:, D:, E: etc), instead all storage devices (hard drives, USB pendrives etc) are given a letter scheme in a device name so that the device names become /dev/sda, /dev/sdb, /dev/sdc and so on.  Furthermore, each partition on the hard drive is given a number so the first hard drive with say three partitions would be /dev/sda1, /dev/sda2, /dev/sda3 etc.\nThese drives are all mounted seamlessly within the / (root) file system, so the main boot drive is usually accessed as /, while a separate partition used to put all user data on will usually be mounted to /home.\nYou don't really need to know how to partition the hard drive.  As soon as you tell the installer to use whole drive it will partition it and do all the set up for you.\nIf you select \"do something else\" at this point instead then it's possible to specify partitions, and even move partitions up or down, and resize them.  It would be quite possible to copy all of your important data onto one of the other partitions and leave it there until after the installation, and copy it to your /home afterwards and re-use the space to grow your main data partition to take up all of the hard drive. You would need to move the data before you start the install; the partitioning program will not move data from one partition to another.  This would be an advanced topic however, and I'd still strenuously recommend that you back up all of your important data to an external drive.\n\nA: The Ubuntu 12.04 installer automatically detects existing Windows partitions and gives you the option to install Ubuntu alongside Windows. The default option is to retain your existing files on your Windows partitions. The following official Ubuntu installation documentation should guide you in performing installation steps.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/installation-guide/i386/index.html\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: How to make folders like \"System Volume Information\" or \"RECYCLER\" hidden, just like it is on windows? I have this external hard drive, and I used it in windows, now that I use it on Ubuntu, and it is kind of annoying to see files like System Volume Information, so how can I make it hidden?\nOr how can I make any file hidden?\n\nA: Although you can make any file/folder hidden by prepending a dot to his name, it is not a good idea to do so on files/folders that belong to another operating system, and that could turn the alien system unstable.\nNautilus, Ubuntu's file browser/manager, has a feature that allows hidding arbitrary files and folders without having to resort to changing their names:\nSimply create a .hidden file in the root of the affected partition or directory, and list in there the names of the files you want to be hidden on Nautilus user interface.\n\nA: Just create text file .hidden on your external hard drive, and add folders you wish to hide, like this:\nfound.000\n$RECYCLE.BIN\nRECYCLER\nSystem Volume Information\n\nAfter that make sure to refresh the view (F5) and the folders should now be invisible.\nPS. if you wish to see/hide hidden files/folders press Ctrl+H.\n\nA: The problem is in linux, hidden attribute of windows doesn't work.\nTo hide a file/folder, you put a . infront of file name.\nBut As those folder are system folder in windows, renaming them with . may cause damage to the OS stability or windows may create another folder with name which will be again visiable in linux\nSo you have to live with that. :)\n", "Q: How to boot windows 7 after installing ubuntu 12.10 alongside?
