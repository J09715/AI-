I've an OpenERP server running on one of my servers.  It's started by a traditional /etc/init.d/ script.  It uses a PostgreSQL database and needs a manual restart every time PostgreSQL is restarted.\nEvery time Ubuntu releases a security update for PostgreSQL, my OpenERP server becomes non-functional until I ssh to the server and manually run sudo /etc/init.d/my-openerp restart.  I usually forget to do that after I do the sudo apt-get upgrade.\nCan I configure upstart to do that for me, every time postgresql is restarted by apt?\n\nA: Since the postgresql server is still using deprecated System-V init script there are two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Emit events from the existing System-V init script\n\n*Port existing System-V init script to upstart job\n\n\nIn both cases you can use start on started-postgresql and stop on stopping-postgresql in your job. As mentioned in the comment  my-openerp will start/stop always on started/stopped postgresql and not only after upgrade.\nIf you opt for emitting events from the existing System-V init script you will need to add in /etc/init.d/postgresql:\n# just before the service is started\ninitctl emit starting-postgresql\n# just after the service is started\ninitctl emit started-postgresql \n# just before stopping the service\ninitctl emit stopping-postgresql\n# just after the service is stopped\ninitctl emit stopped-postgresql\n\nFor details see Helpful Tips in Writing Services section on Ubuntu Boot up Howto page.\nIn case that you opt for creating Upstart job the simplest configuration might look like this:\nstart on runlevel [2345]\nstop on runlevel [016]\nrespawn\n\nexec su -c \"/etc/postgresql/bin/postgres -D /usr/local/pgsql/data\" postgres\n\nMore elaborated Upstart config can be found here.\nI would play around and instead of starting postgresql on runlevel [2345] perhaps say \nstart on filesystem and net-device-up IFACE!=lo\n\nor\nstart on started networking\n\nYou might also consider adding kill timeout stanza\nkill timeout 300\n\n\nA: To elaborate on schkovich's first option, here's a simple modification to the System V /etc/init.d/postgresql script.\nSo whenever postgres is sent \"start/restart\"/\"reload\"/\"force-restart\", I send the \"starting-postgresql\" event before the command is issued, and the \"started-postgresql\" after its finished.  Similarly, with \"stop\", I send the \"stopping-postgresql\" event before the command and \"stopped-postgresql\" after its issued.\nI'm only showing the final case block (case \"$1\" in [...] esac at the bottom of the script.  To make the changes clearer (in case future versions of postgres modify the system-V script, I've highlighted the lines that need to be inserted by putting them between #### BEGIN emit-upstart-event and #### END emit-upstart-event.\ncase \"$1\" in\n    start|stop|restart|reload)\n        if [ -z \"`pg_lsclusters -h`\" ]; then\n            log_warning_msg 'No PostgreSQL clusters exist; see \"man pg_createcluster\"'\n            exit 0\n        fi\n        #### BEGIN emit-upstart-event\n        case \"$1\" in\n            start|restart|reload)\n                initctl emit starting-postgresql\n            ;;\n            stop)\n                initctl emit stopping-postgresql\n            ;;\n        esac\n        #### END emit-upstart-event\n        for v in $versions; do\n            $1 $v || EXIT=$?\n        done\n        #### BEGIN emit-upstart-event\n        case \"$1\" in\n            start|restart|reload)\n                initctl emit started-postgresql\n            ;;\n            stop)\n                initctl emit stopped-postgresql\n            ;;\n        esac\n        #### END emit-upstart-event\n        exit ${EXIT:-0}\n        ;;\n    status)\n        LS=`pg_lsclusters -h`\n        # no clusters -> unknown status                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n        [ -n \"$LS\" ] || exit 4\n        echo \"$LS\" | awk 'BEGIN {rc=0} {if (match($4, \"down\")) rc=3; printf (\"%s/%s (port %s): %s\\n\", $1, $2, $3, $4)}; END {exit rc}'\n        ;;\n    force-reload)\n        #### BEGIN emit-upstart-event\n        initctl emit starting-postgresql\n        #### END emit-upstart-event\n        for v in $versions; do\n            reload $v\n    done\n        #### BEGIN emit-upstart-event\n        initctl emit started-postgresql\n        #### END emit-upstart-event\n    ;;\n    *)\n        echo \"Usage: $0 {start|stop|restart|reload|force-reload|status} [version ..]\"\n    exit 1\n    ;;\nesac\n\nIf you want to handle restarting with all the proper signals (by splitting restart into a stop and start commands) you can do:\ncase \"$1\" in\n    restart)\n        ### HANDLING restart as a stop event and then a start event.\n        if [ -z \"`pg_lsclusters -h`\" ]; then\n            log_warning_msg 'No PostgreSQL clusters exist; see \"man pg_createcluster\"'\n            exit 0\n        fi\n        initctl emit stopping-postgresql\n        for v in $versions; do\n            stop $v || EXIT=$?\n        done\n        initctl emit stopped-postgresql\n        initctl emit starting-postgresql\n        for v in $versions; do\n            start $v || EXIT=$?\n        done\n        initctl emit started-postgresql\n        ### END HANDLING restart separately\n    start|stop|reload)\n        if [ -z \"`pg_lsclusters -h`\" ]; then\n            log_warning_msg 'No PostgreSQL clusters exist; see \"man pg_createcluster\"'\n            exit 0\n        fi\n        #### BEGIN emit-upstart-event\n        case \"$1\" in\n            start|reload)\n                initctl emit starting-postgresql\n            ;;\n            stop)\n                initctl emit stopping-postgresql\n            ;;\n        esac\n        #### END emit-upstart-event\n        for v in $versions; do\n            $1 $v || EXIT=$?\n        done\n        #### BEGIN emit-upstart-event\n        case \"$1\" in\n            start|reload)\n                initctl emit started-postgresql\n            ;;\n            stop)\n                initctl emit stopped-postgresql\n            ;;\n        esac\n        #### END emit-upstart-event\n        exit ${EXIT:-0}\n        ;;\n    status)\n        LS=`pg_lsclusters -h`\n        # no clusters -> unknown status                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n        [ -n \"$LS\" ] || exit 4\n        echo \"$LS\" | awk 'BEGIN {rc=0} {if (match($4, \"down\")) rc=3; printf (\"%s/%s (port %s): %s\\n\", $1, $2, $3, $4)}; END {exit rc}'\n        ;;\n    force-reload)\n        #### BEGIN emit-upstart-event\n        initctl emit starting-postgresql\n        #### END emit-upstart-event\n        for v in $versions; do\n            reload $v\n    done\n        #### BEGIN emit-upstart-event\n        initctl emit started-postgresql\n        #### END emit-upstart-event\n    ;;\n    *)\n        echo \"Usage: $0 {start|stop|restart|reload|force-reload|status} [version ..]\"\n    exit 1\n    ;;\nesac\n\n\nA: I wrote s a script in which I made a -system-update function, which stops openerp, updates the system by apt-get upgrade, then starts openerp, then restart web-client in case of version < 6.1.

Wordpress will generate html pages containing its internal url (for css, etc...). So I am trying to use the proxy_html module to rewrite those urls on the reverse proxy. But I fail miserably.\nMost of the documentation on the internet refer to the latest version of the module, but 12.04 ships with version 3.0.1, and I can't figure out how to make it work.\nHere is what I have put in my virtual host conffile:\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n        ProxyPreserveHost On\n        ProxyRequests Off\n        ServerName example.com\n        ServerAlias www.example.com\n        ProxyPass / http://192.168.1.12/\n        ProxyPassReverse / http://192.168.1.12/\n        ProxyHTMLURLMap http://192.168.1.12 http://www.example.com\n        #SetOuputFilter INFLATE;proxy-html;DEFLATE\n</VirtualHost>\n\nI expect any url containing http://192.168.1.12 produced by wordpress on server 192.168.1.12 to be translated into http://www.example.com.\nThis does not happen.\nI have tried to add other directives, but all failed:\nProxyHTMLEnable On\n\nfails. It seems to be too new and not supported by this version of the module.\nSetOuputFilter INFLATE;proxy-html;DEFLATE\n\nfails also. Maybe I am missing a module to do that ? I have tried adding a2enmod filter, but it does not work either...\nWell, can someone enlighten me on that ?\nEDIT Noticed the mistyping in SetOuputFilter? A t is missing... So SetOutputFilter proxy-html is the way to go to get proxy_html working on 12.04. But I'll rather go for the other solution: tell wordpress to behave according to its public name and generate right urls from the beginning.\n\nA: I have always told Wordpress that my site address was example.com (so that none of the urls created by wordpress have an ip address) and then had my proxy config look something like this:\n    ServerName example.com\n\n    ProxyRequests Off\n    ProxyPreserveHost On\n    ProxyPass / http://192.168.1.1\n    ProxyPassReverse / http://192.168.1.1\n\nkeeps it simple.\n", "Q: I want to install 12.10 Clean but Retain Home from 12.04.

But when I play the music, the Archive Manager HAS to stay open, because when I quit the Manager, the music just stops, and the music disappears from RhythmBox altogether.\nHow do I stop this? Any help appreciated.\nThanks.  \n\nA: Well when the archive manager is opened the audio becomes sort of \"temporaily unzipped\", so you can look and play the files. When the archive manager isn't open, it is in a zipped form, and Rhythmbox can't play compressed files.\nSolution: Type unzip (filename.zip) in terminal. Or in archive manager press Extract, select where you want the files to go, and press \"extract\" or whatever confirm button.\n", "Q: Brightness control stuck on Acer Aspire One After doing a pretty exhaustive search and trying every possible solution I've found on this lovely forum (no joke), my screen brightness is stuck on max.

How can I get Unity (or lightdm) to run .xsession? My .xsession is recognized and run by XMonad.\n\nA: ~/.xsession is only used when no X session is selected. Use ~/.xsessionrc to run programs at startup.\nAs using ~/.Xdefaults is obsolete, Ubuntu, like about any other modern X environment,  uses ~/.Xresources at startup (see for example here for some reasons). So if you put your settings in ~/.Xresources you don't need to run xrdb as Ubuntu is doing this for you.\nSee /etc/X11/Xsession and /etc/X11/Xsession.d/* if you want to know more about what Ubuntu is doing when you start a X session.\n\nA: A note: in Ubuntu 12.03 .xsessionrc is also ignored\nto solve it:\nopen\n./Xsession.d/40x11-common_xsessionrc\n\nat the beginning, add\nUSERXSESSIONRC=$HOME/.xsessionrc\n\nthis is the final content:\n# This file is sourced by Xsession(5), not executed.\n\n#Source user defined xsessionrc (locales and other environment variables)\nUSERXSESSIONRC=$HOME/.xsessionrc\nif [ -r \"$USERXSESSIONRC\" ]; then\n  . \"$USERXSESSIONRC\"\nfi\n\nI don't know if it's solved in versions >12.04\n", "Q: Firefox constantly crashes no log I have Ubuntu 12.10 and it most of times crashes.

I guess that means I'll be stuck with Secure Boot or another distro. These are not porn sites they are newegg.com and tomshardware.com. And I can't even ask why gwibber doesn't work.\n\nA: I am sorry but those 2 sites sites and others work perfectly in Ubuntu. I am pretty sure they will work in all versions of Ubuntu that have ever existed. If you have those 2 sites blocked then you might have one or several of this issues (Try to remember if you or somebody did something to the computer, router or anything related to this issue):\n\n\n*\n\n*You or somebody has listed this sites as blocked in the Firewall or any other app that manages connection to sites.\n\n*You or somebody has listed this sites in the web browser /email client / app as blocked.\n\n*You have a router in between and it has been configured to block this sites\n\n*If you are behind a proxy or using squid3 (Or similar apps) and they are listed as blocked.\n\n*Your ISP has some very weird problems with this sites\n\n*Any other network, security or configuration related issues that could end with this 2 sites being blocked.\nSo I would strongly suggest to first check (Starting with any Ubuntu configuration you might have edited and forgot or somebody else did) configurations in Ubuntu, then move from there to the router, proxy and start checking each one in regards to this 2 sites.\nIf you have another computer on your room/home/office, check with that one to cross from the list where the problem exists. If the other computer, using the same connection has the same issue, it might be the router, ISP or anything that offers the internet service to this computers. If the problem does not appear, then it might be a configuration problem done to Ubuntu.\nWhat I am trying to say with this is that I am 99.99999% sure that this is not the fault of Ubuntu but misconfiguration, hardware related like router, servers and other issues between you and the sites.

When logged into the guest account, \"Guest Session\" doesn't even show up in the menu, so I don't know if it would show then.\n", "Q: how to make putty ssh connection never to timeout when user is idle? I have a Ubuntu 12.04 server I bought, if I connect with putty using ssh and a sudoer user putty gets disconnected by the server after some time if I am idle\nHow do I configure Ubuntu to keep this connection alive indefinitely?\n\nA: If you go to your putty settings -> Connection and set the value of \"Seconds between keepalives\" to 30 seconds this should solve your problem.\n\n\nA: In addition to the answer from \"das Keks\" there is at least one other aspect that can affect this behavior. Bash (usually the default shell on Ubuntu) has a value TMOUT which governs (decimal value in seconds) after which time an idle shell session will time out and the user will be logged out, leading to a disconnect in an SSH session.\n\nIn addition I would strongly recommend that you do something else entirely. Set up byobu (or even just tmux alone as it's superior to GNU screen) and always log in and attach to a preexisting session (that's GNU screen and tmux terminology). This way even if you get forcibly disconnected - let's face it, a power outage or network interruption can always happen - you can always resume your work where you left. And that works across different machines. So you can connect to the same session from another machine (e.g. from home). The possibilities are manifold and it's a true productivity booster. And not to forget, terminal multiplexers overcome one of the big disadvantages of PuTTY: no tabbed interface. Now you get \"tabs\" in the form of windows and panes inside GNU screen and tmux.\napt-get install tmux\napt-get install byobu\n\nByobu is a nice frontend to both terminal multiplexers, but tmux is so comfortable that in my opinion it obsoletes byobu to a large extent. So my recommendation would be tmux.\nAlso search for \"dotfiles\", in particular tmux.conf and .tmux.conf on the web for many good customizations to get you started.\n\nA: Go to PuTTy options --> Connection\n\n\n*\n\n*Change the default value for \"Seconds between keepalives(0s to turn off)\"\n\n\n*\n\n*change it from 0s to 60s (1 minutes)\n--This varies...reduce if 1 minutes doesn't help\n\n\n*Check the \"Enable TCP_keepalives (SO_KEEPALIVE option)\" check box.\n\n*Finally save setting for session\n\n\nA: I keep my PuTTY sessions alive by monitoring the cron logs\ntail -f /var/log/cron\n\nI want the PuTTY session alive because I'm proxying through socks.\n\nA: The 30 seconds timeout never worked for me so I tried playing with a bit and came up with a solution by increasing the timeout to 240(4 mins), now it works like a charm\n", "Q: How can I install both 32 and 64 bit versions of the same -dev package? I'm trying to install libsqlite3-dev for both i386 and amd64 on the same Ubuntu 12.04 machine. I'm developing an application that uses sqlite3, and want to compile and test both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions. \nHowever it looks like the libsqlite3-dev:i386 package is incompatible with the libsqlite3-dev:amd64, as apt keeps wanting to remove one when I install the other. \nIs there a way to get both installed on the same system?\n\nA: You cannot install both of the -dev packages on the same system at the same time. You can only install one or the other, as they contain some of the same files. Multi-arch doesn't enable cross-compilation support, which is what you're trying to do. If you were to install the :i386 version of the sqlite development package, and build with the 64-bit compiler, you'll almost certainly have a broken build as a result.\nYour best bet is to compile in a 32-bit chroot or VM, to build the 32-bit version.\n\nA: Personally, I do not consider forced installations even as a last resort. I think, you might find pbuilder quite useful. Here's a HOWTO for that. You can even install different distros for that purpose, and script the building process for different targets at the same time.\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=206382\nSo, you can even leave all the dev packages uninstalled. They get installed into that temporary chroot installation.\n", "Q: Black loading screen This is the first time that I use Xubuntu and I'm experiencing a problem with it.

After a hardware failure of the motherboard and subsequently a few disks, I am migrating the root partition over to another drive. However, given /dev and other peculiar locations I was wondering whether my method is sound?:\nrsync -avzPHAKXS /mnt/old/ /mnt/new/\n\nNote that the new designated root drive is mounted as /mnt/new and the old one as /mnt/old.\nWill this work or will it fail? I would find out later this week anyway simply by trying, but getting an authoritative answer and perhaps a working alternative would save me some hours.\n\nA: Yes, the method you describe will work assuming neither disk is your current root/active partition (since they're both under /mnt/ it looks like you're OK. \nAlso, you're right that since md devices are involved, it's probably best not to dd the entire partition. That would also need you to grow the filesystem, a step that can be avoided using rsync which is perfectly safe in this case.\nA few comments:\n\n\n*\n\n*No need to worry about special filesystems like /dev, /proc, /sys, /run; since neither disk is your current root partition, these filesystems are not mounted (let's say they're not \"live\") and all they contain are files. Some of the file are \"special\" (maybe fifos or block/char special files) but these copy over OK.\n\n*No need for -z in your rsync line; since it's a local copy and I assume the hard disks are fast enough, it's faster if you avoid the compress/decompress overhead.\n\nA: For copying whole partitions you should use dd. Unmount the partition you want to copy. You need to to know what your partitions are called. You can use GParted or sudo blkid for that. For an example lets assume your partition you want to copy is sdb1 and your target is sdc1. Then your dd command would be\nsudo dd if=/dev/sdb1 of=/dev/sdc1\n\nBe very careful with dd as the target partition specified with the of parameter is overwritten. Always make sure you got your partition names right. Also the partition names can change after reboot so don't rely on them after rebooting.\n", "Q: How to install Nvidia drivers and run unity 3d?

The reason for this is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 10.10 has not had support since April 2012\n\n*Notify OSD is something related mostly to Ubuntu which means the Wine developers or somebody (a 3rd party) would need to code this function into Wine, which probably would not get into the main development of Wine since wine is for all Linux versions, not just Ubuntu.\n\n*Wine is more focused on features and fixes related to the workings of Windows. So something like this would get classified as a wishlist.\n\n*Some might even argue that giving Wine the option to access stuff like the notification bubble would include security issues. The same people might also agree that it would be easier to do the task that needs Wine in Linux using an alternative (eg: Like instead of using Photoshop to send the notification bubble, use Gimp which has scripting features).\nIs it possible to do this? Yes it is.\nWould it get added into the main Wine or Ubuntu development? Most likely not.\nCan a developer do this? Yes. As a patch for Wine that works on Ubuntu and redirects the messages from Wine to the Ubuntu notification system.\nSo as you can see it is tough (Not that tough if one follows the code for it) but doable.\n", "Q: For printing to labels, shifting PDF to align with labels at print time?

At some point, the Qt 5 release was packaged on a separate PPA and the Ubuntu SDK migrated to be based on the contents of that PPA.\nNew installs work fine as described on the Ubuntu SDK installation instructions, but I'd like to know how those of us who installed it on release day on the 2nd can migrate to the latest version of the SDK, as the change of PPAs requires a manual upgrade.\nThis seems to be related to reports of folks who get the \"error importing Ubuntu.Components\" message when upgrading the SDK.\n\nA: In case the step 4. does not remove all the packages from the qt5-beta1 PPA the line helped me to clean up was this:\n $ grep ^Package: /var/lib/apt/lists/ppa.launchpad.net*sdk*Packages /var/lib/apt/lists/ppa.launchpad.net*qt5-beta1*Packages |awk '{print $2}'|xargs sudo apt-get -y remove \nYou can execute the same command and replace the \"apt-get -y remove\" to \"sudo dpkg --purge\" to purge the possible leftovers after apt-get.\n\nA: @sil: sudo apt-get install qt-components-ubuntu will install the missing components.  \nCheers,\n\nA: During the migration from the Qt 5 Beta to the Qt 5 Release, the packaging changed significantly.

I am setting up a server in Amazon EC2. I created an image from Amazon's provided images of Ubuntu x64 12 LTS. My goal is to set up a secure svn server there, where access is only possible by IP address, SSH and certificates. I also need to migrate existing public keys from an old server. \nHaving played with permissions I managed to add another user account, but somehow locked myself (ubuntu) out of the server.

What is the best way to complete this task code wise and mailer wise?  I had hoped Outlook would work but I see wine indicates it as bad.  The email accounts will be work accounts.  This will be my first time setting up email function in a Linux box.  I have typically used Ubuntu as a mod server for files.\nEDIT:\nIm looking to send FROM the server when the script is complete.  If any better suggestions are available I am open to change.  \n\nA: The standard way to send an email from a shell script is the mail command, which is provided by the bsd-mailx package. To use it, you do something like:\necho 'This is the message.' | mail -s 'Subject line here' recipient@example.com\n\nFor more control, the standard way is the sendmail command. The mail command is actually just a wrapper that calls sendmail with a correctly formatted email.\nThe sendmail command is the standard Unix interface to the mail transport agent (MTA) on a Unix system. Traditionally, all Unix systems have one. But since they generally need configuring, neither Ubuntu desktop nor server install one by default. So you need to install an MTA yourself.\nPostfix and Exim are probably the two most popular MTAs right now. Both are packaged well and work fairly easily out of the box. But they're full featured. They can be configured minimally, and the package helps you do this automatically, but the documentation you'll find online will generally assume that you have full MTA functionality configured (eg. mailboxes for incoming email and so forth).\nIf you just want to send outbound email, then nullmailer is a good choice. It is a minimal MTA designed to provide the standard sendmail interface so everything up the stack will work fine, except it sends mail out only.\nPostfix, Exim are all in main, so are well supported in Ubuntu. nullmailer is in universe, so is community supported only.\nSo to summarise:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select and install an MTA. If just for outbound mail from shell scripts, then nullmailer is a good choice.\n\n*Install the bsd-mailx package and then use mail to send email from your shell script.\n", "Q: Updating Less Css I had Less Css working on my 12.1 Ubuntu install fine.

I am running Ubuntu on an ARM based embedded system that lacks a battery backed RTC. The wake-up time is somewhere during 1970. Thus, I use the NTP service to update the time to the current time.\nI added the following line to /etc/rc.local file:\nsudo ntpdate -s time.nist.gov\n\nHowever, after startup, it still takes a couple of minutes until the time is updated, during which period I cannot work effectively with tar and make.\nHow can I force a clock update at any given time?\n\nUPDATE 1: The following (thanks to Eric and Stephan) works fine from command line, but fails to update the clock when put in /etc/rc.local:\n$ date ; sudo service ntp stop ; sudo ntpdate -s time.nist.gov ; sudo service ntp start ; date\nThu Jan  1 00:00:58 UTC 1970\n * Stopping NTP server ntpd     [ OK ] \n * Starting NTP server          [ OK ] \nThu Feb 14 18:52:21 UTC 2013\n\nWhat am I doing wrong?\n\nUPDATE 2: I tried following the few suggestions that came in response to the 1st update, but nothing seems to actually do the job as required. Here's what I tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Replace the server to us.pool.ntp.org\n\n*Use explicit paths to the programs\n\n*Remove the ntp service altogether and leave just sudo ntpdate ... in rc.local\n\n*Remove the sudo from the above command in rc.local\nUsing the above, the machine still starts at 1970. However, when doing this from command line once logged in (via ssh), the clock gets updated as soon as I invoke ntpdate.\nLast thing I did was to remove that from rc.local and place a call to ntpdate in my .bashrc file. This does update the clock as expected, and I get the true current time once the command prompt is available.\nHowever, this means that if the machine is turned on and no user is logged in, then the time never gets updates. I can, of course, reinstall the ntp service so at least the clock is updated within a few minutes from startup, but then we're back at square 1.\nSo, is there a reason why placing the ntpdate command in rc.local does not perform the required task, while doing so in .bashrc works fine?\n\nA: Note that some current Ubuntu based systems don't even use the NTP service by default now. On my Linux Mint 19 (Ubuntu 18.04) machine, time is kept by systemd-timesyncd.\nSo to get an up to date time after it has lost sync, I just run \nsudo systemctl restart systemd-timesyncd\n\nSince 15.04 Ubuntu uses systemd by default. Therefore critical systems like time are managed through systemd. To find what service your system is using run something like \nsystemctl list-unit-files | grep -E 'ntp|timesyncd'\n\nFor TechJS on 16.04 the service was ntp. For myself on Ubuntu 18.04 (Mint 19) the service is systemd-timesyncd. Interestingly, I logged into a 16.04 server I have and it uses systemd-timesyncd as well.\n\nA: The correct way to do this on a Debian / Mint / Ubuntu (or other Debian derivative) system is to have the line\nNTPD_OPTS=\"-g\"\n\nin the file\n/etc/default/ntp\n\nThis ensures that when ntpd is started from the /etc/init.d/ntp script, it runs with the \"-g\" option, viz\n start-stop-daemon --start --quiet --oknodo --pidfile /var/run/ntpd.pid --startas /usr/sbin/ntpd -- -p /var/run/ntpd.pid -g -u 124:128\n\nto allow ntpd to correct the system time when it is more than 1000 s out, eg when the system time is January 1st 1970 on startup because there is no hardware RTC.\n\nA: Use sntp to set the time immediately. Some examples from its man page:\nUSAGE\n     sntp ntpserver.somewhere\n             is the simplest use of this program and can be run as an unprivileged command to check the current time and error in the local clock.\n\n     sntp -Ss -M 128 ntpserver.somewhere\n             With suitable privilege, run as a command or from a cron(8) job, sntp -Ss -M 128 ntpserver.somewhere will request the time from the server, and if that server reports that it is\n             synchronized then if the offset adjustment is less than 128 milliseconds the correction will be slewed, and if the correction is more than 128 milliseconds the correction  will\n             be stepped.\n\n     sntp -S ntpserver.somewhere\n             With suitable privilege, run as a command or from a cron(8) job, sntp -S ntpserver.somewhere will set (step) the local clock from a synchronized specified server, like the (dep‐\n             recated) ntpdate(8), or rdate(8) commands.\n\nIt does work with any ntp time server. A convenient list of servers can be found on ntppool.org.\nYou need sudo privileges, for example:\nsudo sntp -Ss -M 128 0.de.pool.ntp.org\n\n\nA: Check out this one (no apt, no service):\nsudo date -s \"$(wget -qSO- --max-redirect=0 google.com 2>&1 | grep Date: | cut -d' ' -f5-8)Z\"\n\nCheers to Prashant, who solved that issue\n\nA: Use timedatectl (systemd service unit) to set the time. ntp is deprecated.\nsudo systemctl restart systemd-timesyncd.service\n\nYou can check the time was updated reading the logs with journalctl -xe | tail.\nStatus with timedatectl status and config in /etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf.\nReference\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu Server documentation\n\n*Freedesktop\n\n*man timesyncd.conf\n\nA: tlsdate sets the local clock by securely connecting with TLS to remote servers and extracting the remote time out of the secure handshake. Unlike\nntpdate, tlsdate uses TCP, for instance connecting to a remote HTTPS or TLS\n enabled service, and provides some protection against adversaries that try to\n feed you malicious time information.\n$ tlsdate -V -n -H encrypted.google.com\n\n\nA: Instead of ntpdate (which is deprecated), use ntpd:\nsudo service ntp stop\nsudo ntpd -gq\nsudo service ntp start\n\nThe -gq tells the ntp daemon to correct the time regardless of the offset (g) and exit immediately (q) after setting the time.\n\nA: As others have pointed out the best solution is to instruct ntpd to ignore the panic threshold, which is 1000 seconds by default. You can configure the panic threshold in one of two ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*edit /etc/default/ntp and ensure that the -g option is present.\n\n*edit /etc/ntp.conf and place tinker panic 0 at the top\n\n\nSo far this is essentially what others have recommended however there is one more step I think you should take. Install the fake-hwclock program:\n# apt-get install fake-hwclock\n\n\nfake-hwclock: Save/restore system clock on machines without working RTC hardware\n\n Some machines don't have a working realtime clock (RTC) unit, or no\n driver for the hardware that does exist. fake-hwclock is a simple set\n of scripts to save the kernel's current clock periodically (including\n at shutdown) and restore it at boot so that the system clock keeps at\n least close to realtime. This will stop some of the problems that may\n be caused by a system believing it has travelled in time back to\n 1970, such as needing to perform filesystem checks at every boot.\n\n On top of this, use of NTP is still recommended to deal with the fake\n clock \"drifting\" while the hardware is halted or rebooting.\n\nWith fake-hwclock installed your machine will not start up thinking it is 1970 all over again. When your machine boots up it will set its clock to the timestamp fake-hwclock wrote during the last reboot/shutdown. This means you can have a somewhat correct clock in case there are network issues when you boot up. \n\nA: Try using the -b option to step the time.\n\nA: Probably the ntp service is running, that's why ntpdate can't open the socket (port 123 UDP) and connect to ntp server.\nTry from command line:\nsudo service ntp stop\nsudo ntpdate -s time.nist.gov\nsudo service ntp start\n\nIf you want to put this in /etc/rc.local use the following:\n( /etc/init.d/ntp stop\nuntil ping -nq -c3 8.8.8.8; do\n   echo \"Waiting for network...\"\ndone\nntpdate -s time.nist.gov\n/etc/init.d/ntp start )&\n\n\nA: Well, \nI am running a raspbian (debian wheezy) on my raspberry pi, which doesn't have the hwclock. I found it handy to write a little script and run it after my internet interface is up, so that I am sure that the moment the network becomes available, the clock gets updated.\nFirst check that you have the ntpdate package by running\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ntpdate\n\nYou need to add the following into your /etc/network/interfaces (surely eth0 here is just an example):\nauto eth0\n    iface eth0 inet dhcp\n    post-up /usr/local/sbin/update-time.sh\n\nAnd create the following script in /usr/local/sbin/update-time.sh (don't forget to make it executable by chmod):\n#!/bin/bash\n# This script checks if the ntp process is running, stops it, updates the system time, starts it again\n\nps cax | grep -c ntpd > /dev/null\nonoff=$?\nif [ \"$onoff\" -gt 0 ]; then\n    echo \"stopping ntpd...\"\n    service ntp stop\n    echo \"ntpd stopped\"\nelse\n    echo \"ntpd not running, ready to update the date\"\nfi\n\n\nisinstalled=$(dpkg-query -l | grep -c ntpdate)\nif [ \"$isinstalled\" -gt 0 ]; then\n    ntpdate -t 3 -s ntp4.stratum2.ru\n    echo \"date and time update executed\"\nelse\n    echo \"ntpdate package not installed, can't update using ntp\"\nfi\n\necho \"restarting ntpd...\"\nservice ntp start \necho \"ntpd running\"\necho \"printing current date and time:\"\ndate\n\nexit\n\n\nA: ntpdate is a program different from the net dameon.  NTPDate is probably erroring out on boot because ntpd is running on that socket.\nFrom the command line, run\n# sudo service ntp stop ; sudo ntpdate -s time.nist.gov ; sudo service ntp start\n\nYou could also uninstall ntpd all together (apt-get remove ntp) and add a cron script to use ntpdate every hour or so.\nUPDATE\nntp service probably won't have meaningful value for you on this system, so remove that first.\n# sudo apt-get remove ntp\n\nNow add the command:\nntpdate -sb time.nist.gov\n\nto /etc/rclocal \nReboot.  Should be good at that point.\n\nA: rdate -s tick.greyware.com\n\nif all you want to do is set the clock once, simple\n\nA: The ntpd algorithms discard sample offsets exceeding 128 ms, unless the interval during which no [absolute value of] sample offset is less than 128 ms exceeds 900s. The first sample after that, no matter what the offset, steps the clock to the indicated time. In practice this reduces the false alarm rate where the clock is stepped in error to a vanishingly low incidence.\nNormally, ntpd exits if the offset exceeds the sanity limit, which is 1000 s by default. This can be turned off with the -g option:\n-g\n    Normally, ntpd exits if the offset exceeds the sanity limit, which is 1000 s by default. If the sanity limit is set to zero, no sanity checking is performed and any offset is acceptable. This option overrides the limit and allows the time to be set to any value without restriction; however, this can happen only once. After that, ntpd will exit if the limit is exceeded. This option can be used with the -q option.\nboth from http://doc.ntp.org/4.1.0/ntpd.htm\n-Jonathan Natale\n\nA: ntpd and ntpdate run by default using a restricted port (UDP 123).  If you are behind a firewall, ntpd will never work, but ntpdate can work with the -u option.  For example:  ntpdate -u 0.ubuntu.pool.ntp.org  or ntpdate -u time.nist.gov should both work fine.\n\nA: If you can afford the time to wait whatever time it takes before your system gets in sync, you can use the ntp-wait command:\nntp-wait || exit -1 \n# i believe this would exit the script if it fails, but not sure of ntp-wait return codes, learn this first.\n\necho Time is synced, go ahead with backup\ntar\nrsync etc.\n\n\nA: If you are on systemd you could use this command:  \nsudo systemctl restart ntp\n# or\nsudo systemctl restart ntp.service\n\nAnd then the time gets updated within near 10-15 seconds.\nTested on ubuntu mate 16.04\n\nA: Besides recommending to stop the local time server (ntpd or timesyncd), then ntpdate -bs server or ntpd -gq, and after that starting again the time server to keep the time synchronized as many suggested (these steps could be in an @reboot cron job script; see man 5 crontab for details), could be necessary to adjust the Time Zone for the time commands to report the desired time/date. \nFor Ubuntu and the like use: dpkg-reconfigure tzdata and select the right locale. It keeps its value between restarts.\n", "Q: How can I know the USB port? I'm working on a project with an ATmega1280 (Atmel) board. I want to take a look at the stack, so I'm trying to do an OCD (On Chip Debugging).\nIn the tutorial it says:\n\nUse this AVRDUDE command to program the fuses on the ATMega1280 to enable OCD and JTAG:\navrdude -P <port> -c <programmer> -p m1280 -U hfuse:w:0x1a:m -v\n\nReplace port with the port to which your programmer is connected, and programmer with the programmer type.\n\nAt this point, my question is: How can I find out the port of the USB in Kubuntu?\n\nA: I usually list the files in /dev, plug in the device, list the files in /dev again, and look to see which special file appeared. You could also redirect the output of each listing to two different files and use diff to show you which special file appeared when you plugged in the device:\nls /dev > notplugged\n# plug in device\nls /dev > plugged\ndiff notplugged plugged\n\nOnce you know what file corresponds to the device (it's usually something like /dev/ttyUSB0), you just use that file in place of <port>.\nEdit: Apparently dmesg can tell you which device file corresponds to your device. Run dmesg | grep tty after plugging in your device. The device file should be apparent in one of the lines.\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu 12.04 LST along windows without formatting any drive I am facing a problem while installing ubuntu along with win8. The specs about my pc are following:\n500 GB HDD (c:100, d:100, f:50, g:100 h:100 i:50)\nand every drive has important data, and are NTFS\ni have used Lili USB creator for creating bootable usb for ubuntu 12.04 LST. when i boot from usb, it asks me if i want to overwrite windows 8 or do something else, and i chose do something else. now the thing is, it shows me 3 drives having weird names (/sdv like something). first one is reserved (100 MB) second one is c (100 GB) and the last one is what left of hard disk memory (400 GB).\nI have find out that i need to convert file system from NTFS to ext4 for installing ubuntu, which require formatting of my drives, and in this case either format c (windows 8) or what left of hard disk memory (every other thing).\ncan someone explain me what should i do to prevent from formatting any of my drive ??\nthank you !!\n\nA: You probably have a good reason for wanting to boot from a usb, but just in case that's just your chosen means of getting ubuntu onto your machine - you do know you can install ubuntu through the windows installer, right?  This is probably simpler and requires no partitions.\nI installed 12.04 using the windows installer through vista which itself was running through bootcamp on a MacPro.  Rube Goldberg signed the guestbook and so far the ubuntu software is working fine.  I mean, at some point you might want to partition or just get rid of windows entirely, but if like me this is your first installation of ubuntu then I think the windows installer is the easy road.\n", "Q: Cannot shutdown Ubuntu 12.10 When I tell Ubuntu to shutdown it appears to follow the normal procedure but after the screen goes blank the process seems to stop. The bluetooth and wifi LEDs are lit up as well as the batter and wall power. Also the usb ports still have power.\nThis is on a thinkpad x61.\nIs there a way to diagnose this problem?\n\nA: Hmmm there are a lot reasons it might not work. Often, it's because of a quite complex reason.\nWhat you can try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press the 'off' button on the laptop. Maybe it only works after pressing Ctrl+alt+F2.\n\n*Press Ctrl+Alt+F2 and then Ctrl+Alt+Del (this will reboot, but you can press the 'off' button while in the bios/boot screen, when it displays the Thinkpad logo). Sometimes, I have to do this more than once before rebooting actually happens.\n\n*If all else fails, you can press the 'off' button for ~5 seconds until the system goes down. This is basically the same as switching off the power, so not recommended, but sometimes it's the only thing that's left.\n\n\nNote, Ctrl+Alt+Fx switches virtual terminals. You can go back to the graphical screen with Ctrl+Alt+F7.\nThis is probably too late, but I thought in case it happens again.\n\nA: Seems like there's a problem with the wifi:\nhttps://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-nettool/+question/217850\n", "Q: How to Play Bulgarian/Cyrillic subtitles Hello members I'm running Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS 32 bit my only problem is that I'm from Bulgaria and when a download movie with Bulgarian subs VLC player is not showing them properly how can i fix that ? \n\n\nA: I came here for help, but I found the answer myself.\nIn the VLC player menu, go to Tools, Preferences, Subtitles/OSD, then under Default Encoding choose Cyrillic (Windows-1251). You may need to restart the program in order for the change to take effect.\nУспех! Ganbatte!\n\nA: It seems that your problem is related to the encoding of the subtitles. Check the instructions at the VLC's page on subtitles to adjust your preferences to whichever enconding was used to create the subtitle file.\nFonts in your Ubuntu installation should show cyrillic letters with no problem (anyway, that doesn't seem to be your problem).\nIf you need to change the encoding of your subtitle file, follow instructions given in this answer.\n\nA: If your fonts doesn't display correctly with text editor then you can use reopen with encoding using sublime for example, then select the same encoding in VLC. VLC encoding wont be enough if you can't read the Cyrillic subtitles with your text editor. Example: reopen file with Cyrillic (Windows-1251) then set the same for default in VLC. external link for more info\n", "Q: Is it possible to burn an ISO disk along with some documents I want to burn Ubuntu boot disk on a DVD along with some documents I need.  This way I can launch Ubuntu on someone else's computer in case I need to work.  This would allow me to have important notes and commands I use frequently on some text files on the disk.\n\nA: That would be much better using a LiveUSB instead (Install Ubuntu on USB drive).  You can apply persistence to it, which will permanently save your documents on the USB drive, until you delete them!\nUSB is also a LOT faster than CD.\nTry and install Ubuntu on your drive from \"USB creator\", installed on Ubuntu.\nPersistence does not work on every computer, however.  Although you could still use a Live-USB installation (Files resetted at logoff), and store your files on the same USB drive.  Ubuntu only reset specific folders where it is installed on the drive.  You can still use the drive for storing stuff, even if you have Ubuntu installed on it.\n", "Q: Playing a MIDI keyboard without JACK / how to use JACK and PulseAudio/ALSA So, I havea  MIDI keyboard but I'm not really motivated to play when I have to set up JACK and everything else just to get one sound out of it. The problem is that whenever I start JACK I can't play sounds from YouTube, Move Player, RhythmBox, etc. because JACK is taking over the soundcard. \nHere's how I start JACK and my MIDI keyboard:\n$ pulseaudio --kill\n$ jackd & qjackctl & amsynth\n\n(plug in keyboard)\nSo, apparently JACK needs the PulseAudio soundcard. But here's how I exit JACK:\n$ alsa force-reload\n\nI've tried pulseaudio --start but this seems to be the only thing that works. So I'm not really sure whether it's pulseaudio or alsa that I need to play rhythmbox/youtube/etc.\nSo, my question is: Is there any way I can play my MIDI keyboard either without JACK or finding a way I can use JACK and still play RhythmBox etc.? Or maybe a non-JACK MIDI controller? I've tried \n$ jackd -d alsa\n\nand that doesn't really do anything...I still can't hear non-JACK audio...I don't really know what that's supposed to do either, I admit.\nI'm using Ubuntu 12.10 on an Acer AO722 with an Alesis QX49.\n\nA: To let Jack and PulseAudio work together better, you should use pasuspender.\nWith the options -m alsa -a alsa, amsynth should not use Jack.\n(You can the use aconnect to connect the keyboard to the synth.)\n\nA: This is all entirely untested because we do not have a MIDI keyboard here. Nevertheless let me give you some good resources from where you may be able to get MIDI and other audio play together in harmony.\nWhen running JACK you have several options on what to do with PulseAudio, as outlined in the JACK Wiki (commented by me):\n\n\n*\n\n*Do not use JACK and PulseAudio together\nthis of course lets you control your sound system entirely with Jack but you may run into trouble with applications that rely on the presence of Pulseaudio. After removing PulseAudio to replace it with JACK it may not be easy to reinstall Pulseaudio again in case we realize we do still need it.\n\n*Use two different sound cards\nthis means you have one soundcard for PulseAudio and another card for JACK. Not easy to set up without quirks, and involves buying new hardware.\n\n*Route PulseAudio to JACK while JACK is running\nthis may be an elegant way to have both sound servers running in harmony. See also the PulseAudio Wiki on how to set up the PulseAudio JACK modules.\n\n*Suspend PulseAudio while JACK is running\nby making sure to suspend Pulseaudio (as it is already answered) whenever an application uses JACK we may be able to run applications for both PulseAudio, and JACK, but never at the same time.\nYou may also find answers to the following question helpful:\n\n\n*\n\n*Step-by-step to run a midi keyboard input device? 12.04 \nHave a look at rafalcieslak's rather underrated answer there, where he also gives you a link to his nice blog on that topic.\n\nA: If you choose to use jack , which is a rational assumption for audio/midi capturing and playback, you can play sounds from your keyboard and still route the default audio device to jack so that youtube and other application continue to work.\nSee the chosen answer here.\n", "Q: Photo downloading I have a digital Nikon Coolpix.

Use with caution.\n\n*\n\n*You can help yourself recover from an input problem by allowing an SSH connection to be performed right after your computer boot. So, if you do not have any usable input on your computer, you can always connect to it using the SSH connection to try and fix the input problem/misconfiguration.\n\n\n\n*First check which version of xserver-xorg-input-libinput is available on your system:\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-input-libinput\n\n*dpkg -l | grep xserver-xorg-input-libinput\nii  xserver-xorg-input-libinput                   0.29.0-1                              amd64        X.Org X server -- libinput input driver\n\n\n\n\n\n*Then, checkout on the git tag as 0.29.0 correspondent to the installed version 0.29.0 on the package manager.\n\n*Edit the source code, applying the following patch:\n--- a/src/xf86libinput.c\n+++ b/src/xf86libinput.c\n@@ -1651,6 +1651,7 @@ calculate_axis_value(struct xf86libinput *driver_data,\n        value = libinput_event_pointer_get_axis_value(event, axis);\n    }\n\n+   value *= 3;\n    *value_out = value;\n\n    return true;\n\n\n\n*Change the value of 3 on value *= 3; accordingly to how much you would like to change your scroll speed. To reduce the scroll speed, you can use lower values like 0.9, 0.99, 0.2, etc.\n\n*After configuring a desired value, build and install your changes:\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get build-dep libinput\n\n*autoreconf -vif\n\n*./configure --prefix=/usr\n\n*make\n\n*make install\n\n\n\n*In order for changes to take effect, you will have to logout and login of your xorg/user session.\n\n*To revert your changes, just reinstall the xserver-xorg-input-libinput using your package manager, i.e., sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-input-libinput --reinstall\n\nA: I have a Logitech PerformanceMouse MX and none of the solutions here worked.

I've tried the solutions in here but what it only works was intalling solaar and modify the configuration through it. Hope this helps.\n\nA: For Solaar users, the trick was to turn off Scroll Wheel Resolution, i.e. \"High-sensitivity mode for vertical scroll with the wheel\".\n\n\nA: My problem was slightly different and I'm posting the answer here to assist other users as well. My issue was that the default mouse hardware added by VmWare Fusion or Workstation was not supporting scrolling in Ubuntu and other Linux distros, while the cursor was moving. \nThe issue seemed at first to be erratic scrolling, slow scrolling (which lead me here), while in fact, it was a different problem. This thread help me fixed it.\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/1270811/inconsistent-and-erratic-mouse-wheel-in-linux-while-moving-the-mouse-pointer#\nBy moving evdev to a later \"init\" order, the scrolling came back to act as normal.\n\nA: Turning the mouse on and off or removing the USB dongle shortly always did the trick for me. However, now it was not working anymore. Neither was the imwheel solution mentioned above a few times. Only after removing solaar the mouse reboot trick worked again.\n\nA: On my ThinkPad, to change the scroll speed using the TrackPoint, inspired by other answers here, I did\nxinput list\n\nand found the TrackPoint to be named TPPS/2 Elan TrackPoint. I use the name and not the ID as I found the ID can change on reboot, making. I continued with\nxinput list-props 'TPPS/2 Elan TrackPoint'\n\nunder which I saw libinput Scrolling Pixel Distance. I set this using\nxinput set-prop 'TPPS/2 Elan TrackPoint' 'libinput Scrolling Pixel Distance' x\n\nwhere x could be values between 10 and 50 (I experimented), lower values meaning faster scrolling.\nI finally added the last command in the end of my ~/.profile.\n", "Q: The bug reporting process prevents me from reporting my bug I read through the Reporing Bugs Community Wiki. I am unsure exactly what kind of package to report my bug against. The problem is that my USB sound device will only work if connected at boot, but not if I plug it in after. So, is it a USB bug, a sound bug, or a boot problem? I don't know.\nSo, according to the Wiki, it says:\n\nIf you're not sure which package is affected by the bug, type\n  ubuntu-bug in the \"Run Application\" window and click Run\n\nSo I do exactly that. I'm given this dialog:\n\nThe only USB option is for storage devices, and I'm not sure if it's a sound problem or USB problem or what, so I go with \"Other problem\". But then I'm simply dismissed with a \"No package specified\" error.\n\nHow was I supposed to specify a package when the reason I chose \"Other problem\" was because I'm not sure what's going on?\nSo I restart the bug reporting process, this time selecing \"Sound/Audio related problems\". I get this message:\n\n... but wait... Pulse hadn't crashed before I started the bug reporting process, so is it the bug reporting process itself that crashed Pulse, and if so, then isn't that separate from the bug I want to report?\nAt this point I've lost confidence in the bug reporting procedure. This is not the first time I have encountered the incredibly user-unfriendly Ubuntu bug reporting process, so I could go off on a rant about it. But I won't.

How do I re-install drivers?\n\nA: Yes, you will lose everything. Be informed that windows and Linux are completely different operating system, and even if you retain a copy of windows driver it is use less in Ubuntu (Or derivative).

I made a ubuntu 12.10 dvd and loaded it. When i started installing my installer could not recognise any other windows 8  or any other OS installed. When i moved to advanced partition tool, i could see my free space, my windows partitions. But i did not proceed. can anyone help. \n\nA: I had a similar problem with my Dell XPS 8500 desktop. I found the following bug report helpful:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/os-prober/+bug/1079056\nThe workaround suggested there worked for me. Run ubiquity (the Ubuntu installer) with the following command:\n$ WINOSDATA=true ubiquity\nSlightly more detailed instructions, if they are needed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot your computer from the Ubuntu Live CD (or USB), and select the\noption \"Try Ubuntu without installing\".\n\n*Open a terminal window, e.g. by pressing Ctrl+ALt+T.\n\n*Enter the command $ WINOSDATA=true ubiquity\nThe Ubuntu installer should then detect your Windows 8 installation (it did for me).\nThe problem appears to be with os-prober, the command used by ubiquity to detect installed operating systems. You can test this by running first $ sudo os-prober, and then $ sudo WINOSDATA=true os-prober. You may find that in the first case, no OS is detected, but in the second, Windows 8 is detected. (Substituting any non-zero value for \"true\" works equally well. Don't ask me why.)\n\nA: Yes, go to the boot options when the machine starts and disable the UEFI!\n\nA: I had a similar problem with my laptop that came with Windows 8.  It turned out there were both GPT and MBR partition tables, which was confusing the installed (and gparted).  Follow these steps:\nBoot Live CD, don't choose the install option, choose test out Ubuntu.\nOpen a shell and type \nsudo sgdisk --zap /dev/sda\n\nWhere sda is the disk with the Windows partition. It'll complain about partition problems, but this is ok.\nProceed with your Ubuntu installation.\nsource here\n", "Q: Any reason to have a strong user password? I recently decided to change my (very) strong user password to something trivial.\nThis was mostly to eliminate frustration with typing a long password each time I sudo or whatever.\nMy question is, is there any reason to have a strong user password? considering that most services which I run on my box do not use PAM for auth:\n\n\n*\n\n*apache2 - uses .htpasswd for access  \n\n*sshd - only private keys allowed  \n\n*transmissiond - uses its own http auth  \n\n*mpd - uses its own auth  \n\n*samba - limited to LAN\n\n\nPhysical access to the box is out of the question.\n\nA: The reason to have a password is the reason to have a strong or even a very strong password, one of the reasons being to protect you from unauthorized access.\nIf you are certain that your PC is absolutely safe that it doesn't need a password, you may want to have a look at these questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to run an application using sudo without a password\n\n*How do I prevent policykit from asking for a password\n\n*How to change/disable password complexity test when changing password?\n\nA: If you don't run any services (like apache2) then it's not much of an issue.\nIf you run such services in a Virtualbox or Docker or similar situation, then you are protected (assuming you don't give those boxes access to your own computer without a strong password).\nIf you directly run one or more services on your main box, then you are at risk. That is, in most cases you are fine, but if the service has a door that would let a hacker penetrate your system, then a strong password may help you against that hacker by not letting them gain root access.\nOf course, in many cases, a service hack directly gives root access to the hacker. In that case, whatever the password won't mater one bit. But if they gain access to PHP through your website blog (for example), they may not have much to go by to really hack your whole system. With PHP, they can already access your PHP files, read your database password (if you have it in clear, which is the case in many PHP front ends--I won't cite which ones but yeah...) and then access all the data in that database. That would include your users email address and encrypted passwords.

There is no chain of custody back to a Debian/Ubuntu signature, as far as I can see. Which is a real shame because that would be a really simple, really quick way to verify the authenticity of a live file.\nInstead to truly verify a file, you need to download a fresh copy of that deb, extract the internal control.tar.gz and then look at its md5sums file to compare against a real md5sum /bin/which. It's a painful process.\nWhat has most likely happened here is that you've had some system updates (a distribution upgrade even) and you haven't asked rkhunter to update its profiles. rkhunter needs to know what files should be like so any system updates are going to upset it.\nOnce you know something is safe, you can run sudo rkhunter --propupd /bin/which to update its reference of the file.\nThis is one of the problems with rkhunter. It needs deep integration into the deb process so that when trusted, signed packages are installed, rkhunter updates its references to files.\n\nAnd no, I wouldn't whitelist things like this because this is exactly the sort of thing a rootkit would go after.\n\nA: zuba, the whitelist idea is a bad one; it is unassigning a file to be checked\n     which should be visible to you and your anti-malware, the idea is used though and viewing the message is harmless. Could we create a writethrough instead would be better. somewhere along the lines of  \\lines beginning with \\ will be ignored; but that takes some coding experience and intimate knowledge of the workings of rkhunter.\nThe bin/which will be rewritten when needed to accommodate programming changes; In general one file may be replaced or files may be temporarily created and change or disappear after a reboot, and that may trick the rkhunter software. \nThere is a line where software/updates or antimalware resembles a rootkit, and I believe these are one of those. \nThe method you employ is dangerous only if it changes a program or file that will (act to) somehow affect the computers operation. Sometimes we are worse that our machines in that respect. Proving this for your computer is really unfair to ask, as I could if it were mine. I would know, document the warnings and checksums and would note whenever there was a change. \n", "Q: Ubuntu on galaxy note II I recently bought Samsung Galaxy Note II on android 4.1. \nIt was my idea to try to turn it into a pc and I bought a micro-keyboard for the same purpose.

The thing it changes are the icons in Nautilus, bookmarks etc. So, when you go to Nautilus and click the Documents directory (I don't know what it will be called, it's a long time ago that I used translated directory names) you should get to where you want.\nIt seems to me you actually want something different. For example, when taking ~/Documents, what you could do is use this in user-dirs.dirs:\nXDG_DOCUMENTS_DIR=\"$HOME/Documents\"\n\nAnd let point ~/Documents to /media/E/Administrateur/Mes_documents/:\nrmdir ~/Documents\nln -s /media/E/Administrateur/Mes_documents/ ~/Documents\n\nThese are commands you can enter in a terminal (just search for 'terminal' in the dash).\nWhat this does, is that creates a symbolic link named ~/Documents that points towards /media/E/Administrateur/Mes_documents/. In effect, applications (like Nautilus) think they're looking at ~/Documents but they're actually looking at a different directory, somewhere else on the file system (or on a different filesystem, which seems to be the case here). You can use this also for the rest of the directories.\nI think the Desktop directory is a bit of an exception. As I understand it, the desktop is just Nautilus running full-screen without toolbars etc. behind all other windows, showing the directory specified in user-dirs.dirs. That's the reason (I think) why the desktop works. (Note, ~/Desktop would probably still be empty).\nI recommend you also put a real Pictures and Videos dir. Otherwise, some applications might get confused.\nMore about symbolic links: http://www.linuxchix.org/content/courses/filesystem/Lesson2a.html\n", "Q: PXE boot ubuntu 12.04 Customization Just configured my Ubuntu 12.04 server to play host to a diskless PXE/NFS system.

There is two ways to backup your whole OS system.\n   1- You can use Remastersys(stopped development) or Relinux(implement of remastersys, still developing) to bakcup then copy it to NFS.\n   2- You can copy whole OS system as a backup to NFS.  \n\nThere are some advantages and disadvantages of both. Yout have to make new iso file when you want to update system, change some configurations etc. or you can use Aufs if you choose first option. I choose second option.

I have tried searching for the same question or solution but haven't been able to. \nAfter I use boot-repair and it says boot .efi file from sda7/ & I do so in BIOS and this is what I get. \nerror: disk`,msdos5' not found\ngrub rescue>_\n\nA: You've got an MBR hard disk with what appears to be a set of EFI boot loaders for both Windows and Ubuntu on /dev/sda7. This is highly unusual, and most likely represent a GPT-to-MBR conversion on the disk. Some firmware implementations will boot from such a disk, and the fact that you're getting as far as GRUB suggests that yours does so; however, it's conceivable that this combination is causing GRUB to choke. It's also possible there's some more subtle problem with your partition table or GRUB configuration that I've missed.\nI recommend doing one of two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot your installer in BIOS mode and run Boot Repair. This should install the BIOS version of GRUB on the computer, which is a more conventional choice for your MBR partition scheme and is therefore more likely to work correctly. You might need to fiddle with your firmware options to get it to attempt a BIOS-mode boot, though.\n\n*Download and boot Parted Magic, System Rescue CD, or a similar tool, and then run gdisk on the disk to convert it from MBR to GPT form and change the type code of partition #7 to EF00. (You should type p to verify that your partitions are all intact, type t to change the type code of partition #7, and then type w to save your changes.) With any luck this will get the computer working again; however, it's possible you'll need to run Boot Repair again.\n\n\nIf you try one solution and it doesn't work, you can try the other one; however, GRUB on a GPT disk booting from MBR works best if you've got a BIOS Boot Partition, so you should create one if you convert the partition table type and then install the BIOS version of GRUB.\n", "Q: No sound via HDMI and I cannot use mirror display on a lenovo G560 Had some trouble since switching from Win to Ubuntu yesterday. When I connect my pc through HDMI to my TV the sound doesn't work. The video is there (expanded desktop) but the sound is still coming from the PC. \nI want to be able to mirror the display and guess this could solve the problem. But when I try the TV gets no display, just black, and no signal. Anyone know in what direction to push me? Don't want to back to Win, but with no way to watch movies on the TV it's heading that way...\nIt's an integrated intel vid card.\n\nA: Solved. For some reason Alsa couldn't manage it but when installing Pulse I had the choice to switch to HDMI audio, which ment the audio worked on the TV.

What causes this error?\n\nA: I find it is a bit better to create a new file in /etc/conf.d that to modify either apache2.conf or httpd.conf.\nIt's a personal preference that keeps my configuration changes separated from the distribution package.  So updates are less complicated.\nI create the file /etc/apache2/conf.d/AAserverName and it contains only:\nServerName myhost.mycomain.tld\n\nThe other suggestions certainly work also.\n\nA: 13.04 and older\nThis is just a friendly warning and not really a problem (as in that something does not work).\nIf you go to:\n/etc/apache2/apache2.conf\n\nand insert:\nServerName localhost   \n\nand then restart apache by typing into the terminal:\nsudo systemctl reload apache2\n\nthe notice will disappear.\nIf you have a name inside /etc/hostname you can also use that name instead of localhost.\n\nAnd it uses 127.0.1.1 if it is inside your /etc/hosts:\n127.0.0.1 localhost\n127.0.1.1 myhostname\n\nPreferred method\n\nTroubleshooting Apache\n\nIf you get this error:\napache2: Could not determine the server's fully qualified domain name, \nusing 127.0.0.1 for ServerName\n\nthen use a text editor such as \"sudo nano\" at the command line or \"gksudo gedit\" on the desktop to create a new file,\nsudo nano /etc/apache2/conf.d/fqdn\n\nor\ngksu \"gedit /etc/apache2/conf.d/fqdn\"\n\nthen add\nServerName localhost\n\nto the file and save. This can all be done in a single command with the following:\n echo \"ServerName localhost\" | sudo tee /etc/apache2/conf.d/fqdn\n\nBut on Ubuntu 14.04:\n echo \"ServerName localhost\" | sudo tee /etc/apache2/conf-available/fqdn.conf\n sudo a2enconf fqdn\n\nDon't forget the \".conf\" (without will not work).\n\nA: Apache2 can also get the FQDN from a properly configured system hostname rather than hardcoded into the apache config file. Hardcoding it will also cause confusion if the hostname changes. You actually don't need any ServerName directives in httpd.conf or any apache config files.\nPut the following in /etc/hosts:\n# IPv4 and IPv6 localhost aliases\n127.0.0.1 hostname.domainname.com  hostname  localhost\n::1       hostname.domainname.com  hostname  localhost\n\nwhere hostname.domainname.com is the FQDN of your machine. \nAlong with a properly configured hostname in /etc/hostname/ or with hostnamectl, this will also help other services on your machine run properly (i.e. the login prompt, showing This is hostname.domainname.com instead of This is hostname.unknown_domain.)\n\nA: *\n\n*Open a terminal\n\n*Open the /etc/apache2/httpd.conf file:\nsudo editor /etc/apache2/httpd.conf # [1]\n\n\n*By default, it would be blank. Simply add the following line:\nServerName localhost\n\n\n*Save the file and exit\n\n*Restart the server\nsudo service apache2 restart\n\n\n[1] Launch default editor, see sudo update-alternatives --config editor\n\nA: In Ubuntu 16.04:\nsudo -i\n\necho 'ServerName localhost' > /etc/apache2/conf-available/server-name.conf\na2enconf server-name\n\n\nA: In new version of apache2 you just following command like this:\nsudo nano /etc/apache2/apache2.conf\n\nAdd the following new line end of file:\nServerName localhost\n\nThen restart apache2:\nsudo service apache2 restart\n\nIt's done.\n\nA: On Ubuntu 16.04:\nAdd ServerName localhost to the file httpd.conf usin gthe following command.\nsudo vi  /etc/apache2/httpd.conf\n\nThen include this line Include httpd.conf at the end of this file\nsudo vi /etc/apache2/apache2.conf\n\nCheck for syntax errors again\nsudo apache2ctl configtest\n\nYou should now get\nSyntax OK\n\nYou can now restart the server gracefully by reloading the configuration\nsudo service apache2 reload\n\nor kill the process and start again\nsudo service apache2 restart\n\n\nA: 13.10 or newer\nAs of Apache 2.4 - which is available by default as of 13.10 - you cannot use the method about adding a config file in the conf.d directory.\nApache no longer uses the conf.d directory. All the configuration files are stored inside /etc/apache2/conf-available directory and all the configuration files should now have a .conf extension.\nIn order to solve this message in Apache 2.4, we have to create a configuration file inside the conf-available directory. For example servername.conf.\nsudo vi /etc/apache2/conf-available/servername.conf\n\nAnd inside this we just need to add one line\nServerName localhost\n\nYou can combine the previous two commands in one with:\necho \"ServerName localhost\" | sudo tee /etc/apache2/conf-available/servername.conf\n\nIf you want to use a domain name or any other name depending on the requirement its fine, just replace localhost with whatever you need. Next you have to enable this configuration. For this, you need to run the following command:\nsudo a2enconf servername\n\na2enconf is a command to enable a configuration file in Apaches 2.4. Also note that servername on the above command is from the name of the configuration file servername.conf. If your configuration file was ngenericserver.conf then you would have to write sudo a2enconf ngenericserver.\nAfter this reload the server and the above message will no longer bug you.\nsudo service apache2 reload\n\nor\nsudo apache2ctl graceful\n\nNow after this you will see that the message will not be shown again and the problem will be fixed.\n\nA: Add ServerName localhost\nTo\n sudo leafpad /etc/apache2/apache2.conf\n\n sudo leafpad /etc/apache2/httpd.conf\n\nIt's not an error.. It's just a friend reminder\n\nA: Specifying ServerName localhost in your configuration files outside of the virtual host sections is the way to do this.  \nSome other answers suggest that you should modify /etc/apache2/httpd.conf.  This file gets overwritten when apache gets upgraded from apt.  For Apache configuration that you don't want to get overwritten, you should create a new file.  Here is the \"Debian way\" to make this configuration change:\n# create the configuration file in the \"available\" section\necho \"ServerName localhost\" | sudo tee /etc/apache2/conf-available/servername.conf\n# enable it by creating a symlink to it from the \"enabled\" section\nsudo a2enconf servername\n# restart the server\nsudo service apache2 restart\n\nThis is basically the same as Stark's answer, but in an easy to copy and paste script form.  I had originally posted this in a question that was marked as duplicate: https://askubuntu.com/a/432408\n\nA: On Ubuntu 11.10, I saw this message, along with a hung boot occurring because my disk was full.  One of the log files had gone rogue.  Probably there was not actually a problem with Apache, but this message was the last clue given before the boot hung.\nTo fix the problem, I had to boot into recovery mode and remove the wayward log file.\n\nA: Run the following command:\napachectl -t -D DUMP_INCLUDES\n\nto determine path to your httpd.conf configuration file, then edit that file and uncomment/modify the line which specifies the value for ServerName option, e.g.\nServerName localhost\n\nFor the web server, use the registered DNS name (e.g. example.com).\n\nIf your host doesn't have a registered DNS name, enter its IP address here.\n\n\nA: If you're using bash and want minimal dependencies (and just want a one-liner for your entrypoint script if you are using Docker like me), these two options should work.\nIf you want localhost:\necho \"ServerName localhost\" >> /etc/apache2/apache2.conf\nIf you want the existing hostname:\necho \"ServerName $(cat /etc/hostname)\" >> /etc/apache2/apache2.conf\nThis uses the bash redirection operators to append the string to the end of the file.

Tried a bunch of things to fix it, finally actually did:\nOutside of XBMC:\n- made sure my pulseaudio / alsa default system volume levels were at the \"unamplified\" setting.  This didn't do it, but will distort the sound in other ways\nInside of XBMC: \n - During movie playback, get the bottom menu up, and click the speaker on the right.  This will take you to an audio configuration page.  First option is volume.  It is set with the slider all the way to the right, and apparently this is 0db (unamplified).  I lowered the volume to -3db (mostly all the way up, but not quite) -- the pops disappeared.  \nLooks like XBMC isn't exactly sure of where it's amplifying sound and causing clipping (the pops).

I thought everything was still working on YouTube when the first video played flawlessly, but it seems to be hit-and-miss; I'm not sure why some play while the rest give me the \"Adobe Flash Player required for video playback\" message.

If the user an group are yours then we continue with the following step, if not we change it:\nsudo chown -fR jeggy:jeggy /media/jeggy\nThen just in case we do:\nsudo chmod 777 -fR /media/jeggy/INTENSO\nBefore doing all of this of course, the HDD should be mounted. If it is not, then it will not work. So make sure it is mounted before doing chmod or chown. You can also get the information about how it was mounted by typing mount.\nAnd just in case it still not work I would look into /etc/fstab to see if the HDD is there and is being mounted with other flags and options. If it is, remove it or change the flags and options to yours.\nIn relation to the use of fsck, you need to know several things, first you are suppose to use it with the device in question, which is found in /dev/ no to the mounted folder it was assigned to. So\nfsck /media/jeggy/INTENSO would be wrong    \nfsck /dev/sda1 would be right\nThere is no need to add the type of filesystem for fsck (Except in the case of trying to repair a NTFS filesystem, in which case you would use ntfs3g instead of fsck). So\nfsck.vfat -r /dev/sdb1 is the same as fsck -r /dev/sdb1 because fsck will first look for what type of filesystem the device has and with it determined how to proceed. If the filesystem is fat, then it will automatically run fsck.vfat. Same for ext2, ext4 and any others supported. \nAnother tip is that I would go with the -p or -y parameters instead of the -r because they are compatible between each fsck command, so I would run either one of the following lines:\nsudo fsck -p /dev/sdb1  -- Automatic Repair\nsudo fsck -y /dev/sdb1  -- Assume yes to all questions\nNOTE: the -y in fsck is the same as -a in the fsck.vfat command. It is compatible with both.\nLastly, if you want to force a check + repair on the drive I would do the following:\nsudo fsck -fy /dev/sdb1 -- Force Check + Assume yes to all questions\n\nA: Go to terminal and run:\nsudo -H nautilus\n\nIt will ask you the password.\nOnce the Nautilus is open with sudo, copy the directory and paste on the external HD or anywhere you want. Because it is running as root, you will be able to do the same things with it that you can do by running commands with sudo in a terminal. When you're done, you should close this root-owned file browser window so you don't use it by accident when it's not needed.\n\nA: In my case, it was due to my current user account not being given write permission for the external HDD. My external HDD is formatted as NTFS. Remounting the drive with write permissions did the trick. Refer to this for steps.\nTo figure out your drive's file path and name, run mount. An example of what to look for in the output is:\n/dev/sda1 on /media/<<your-account-name>>/<<external-drive-name>>\n\nOnce you have completed all steps, check the HDD's Properties -> Permissions.

Right now, I can access my windows drive from ubuntu, however, I want to delete the windows partition and make it an ubuntu partition. I have already backed up my data. How do I go about it.\n\nA: If you're using Ubuntu 12.10, you can format your partition by opening the Disks application, select the partition, click the two cogs icon below and select format.\nThen choose ext4 as the file system type. Your windows NTFS partition is now a Linux ext4 partition.\nAutomounting your partition (optional)\nIf you want it to automount at boot, you may want to modify your /etc/fstab file.\nCreate your mount point. You may choose to mount wherever you want but normally partitions are mounted either under /media or under /mnt. The former place would make the partition easily unmountable like a pendrive while the latter is more \"permanent\".\nOpen a terminal (ctrl + alt + t) and type sudo mkdir /mnt/choosename. Change choosename to whatever you like.\nType sudo blkid and copy the UUID of your drive.\nPress Alt + F2 and type gksudo gedit /etc/fstab, then add a line like this:\nUUID=your-UUID-here /mnt/choosename               ext4    errors=remount-ro 0       1\n\nOnce you reboot, your partition will be present in the selected mount point.\n\nA: Ok, I think this is how you do it. In a nice two steps.\nWhen you format the drive, it makes it a Linux filesystem.\nSo,\n\n\n*\n\n*Format the Windows drive to FAT or Ext4.\n\n*Copy and paste (Click and drag the mouse, that's the easiest way) the files onto the new drive.\nNow you have the Linux filesystem on your drive and your files in one!\nHope this helps!\n\nA: the Disk Utility program (ubuntu 12.04) or Disks (12.10) allows you to do basic partition operations in a nice GUI interface.\nYou have it in the Software Center. \nOnce installed, open it, select the partition you want to edit, then format it.

I recently installed Ubuntu 12.10.\nAs i started the terminal and ran the command su which we usually use to perform root operations and to get the # symbol.\nAfter running the command it asks me to enter password, I entered the password which Ubuntu had asked me during installation.\nI entered the password many times , but it gives me a message Authentication Failure\nWhat should i do ???\n\nA: Short answer: in Ubuntu the root account is disabled, so you cannot log in as root or use su - to become root.\nInstead (as the user who was created during installation) use sudo <command-you-want-to-issue, after which you are prompted for your password and the command is executed with root priviledges.\nPlease read more about the ideas behind this in the question Differences between su and sudo...\n\nA: The Ubuntu installer never asks you to enter a root password, it only asks for a user password. This is in contrast with many other distros, for example Debian, which will ask you for both.\nThe Ubuntu installer only asks for a user password. It grants special permission for this user so that it will be able to run any and all programs with sudo.\nIn Ubuntu the root user is disabled by default, whenever you need to run something as root you should run it with sudo. This is not a limitation, as you are still able to do all the same things as when you used su, just slightly differently. \n", "Q: Who is ubuntu-etherpad and why did they take ownership of my bzr branch?

See your team membership information.\nThis presumably means that you can write to this team's bzr branches, which you appear to have done unintentionally. Can you delete from https://code.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-etherpad/+junk/cup-pdf-zel too, using the web interface?\nCan you try being explicit when you push? Use, for example:\nbzr push lp:~lantzr/+junk/cup-pdf\n\nDoes this work as you expect?\nEdited to add: so I don't think ubuntu-etherpad has taken ownership of anything; you have been pushing and accessing its bzr branches all along, instead of your own as you intended.\n\nA: You changed the owner of the branch to ubuntu-etherpad at 03:53 UTC on the 11th. You can change it back the same way, using the \"Change details\" link on the branch page.\nAlso, as others have hinted, that's a branch, not a PPA or a package.\n", "Q: What IM clients support Jabber and show notifications on the toolbar in Ubuntu 12.10? I'm migrating from MacOS X back to Ubuntu, and trying to find an IM client I can use.   I use IM quite a bit for work, so I really need to see notifications in the toolbar at the top of the screen.\nWhen I previously used Ubuntu, Pidgin was my go-to IM client, and it's also the one recommended by my company - and it is what I have set up now - however the fact that it doesn't support notifications in the top window is an issue for me.   I've already missed one message from my boss because of the lack of notifications!\nUnfortunately Empathy doesn't seem to work with the custom Jabber server my work operates - some people I talked to said that there was a known incompatibility between the two, and no plans to fix it on either side.\nAre there other IM clients that are well integrated into Ubuntu and will show a notification in the title bar?\nAlternatively, if anyone knows of a trick to get pidgin notifications working, that'd be great - based on the googling I did, it sounds like a known issue that people are working on, but I wasn't able to find a target date for the fix.\n\nA: It looks like the alternative solution with pidgin is possible - this answer https://askubuntu.com/a/69644/22899 seems to do the trick - from the context I thought it only added an icon with controls to the toolbar, but it is the full icon with a notification if there are unread messages...  That solves the problem for me with Pidgin.\n", "Q: Does vncviewer require X locally?

Every time I open any file, I get a message similar to this one:\nThe selected document class\n    article\nrequires external files that are not available.\nThe document class can still be used, but the\ndocument cannot be compiled until the following\nprerequisites are installed:\n    article.cls\nSee section 3.1.2.2 (Class Availability) of the\nUser's Guide for more information.\n\nI'm not sure if the problem is with Lyx itself or some of its Latex dependencies.\nI do have the \"article.cls\" file in my system (from texlive-latex-base) located in:\n/usr/share/texlive/texmf-dist/tex/latex/base/article.cls\n\n(This line shows up in Tools → TeX Information, so apparently Lyx knows about it).\nI have already tried reinstalling texlive and using Tools → Reconfigure, didn't work. \nI'm using LyX 2.0.5.1 in KUbuntu 12.10.\nEDIT:  Apparently this is a bug in 12.10. I just reverted to 12.04 and everything is working smoothly again, with no setup needed beyond apt-get install lyx.\n\nA: I know it's an old question, but I just experienced the same problem myself on a fairly recent Mint 17.2 installation.\nI used apt-file search article.cls to see which packages have that file - and confirmed that it's present in the texlive-* series of packages.  I then did apt-get install texlive - which pulled a few dependencies with it - and the problem was solved.\n\nA: If you only installed the Lyx Processor and Tex-live then you need to extend the functionality of LyX by installing the listed packages (in bold) for full functionality.  They are all available in the Ubuntu Software Center.  \nThose that are NOT in bold are optional (i think they are self explanatory anyway).  When i installed these, all my document classes became available.\nFor additional document classes (subclasses) and other how tos you can visit the Lyx Wiki here\n\n\n*\n\n*chktex: check for typographical errors\n\n*dvipost: display tracked changes in DVI format output\n\n*gnuhtml2latex: import HTML documents\n\n*groff: improved table formatting in plain text exports\n\n*librsvg2-bin, inkscape: use the SVG image format in LyX documents (if your using Inkscape as your graphics editor inr Lyx)\n\n*linuxdoc-tools: export SGML LinuxDoc documents \n\n*mythes-*: use the OpenOffice.org/LibreOffice Thesaurus\n\n*noweb: import noweb files\n\n*rcs: integrated version control\n\n*sgmltools-lite: export SGML DocBook documents \n\n*texlive-xetex, etoolbox: use the XeTeX typesetting system \n\n*wv: import MS Word documents\n\nA: My new LyX installation showed exactly the same symptoms as the original poster's. I found that there was an old .texmf-var directory in my home directory. Renaming or deleting it, e.g. mv .texmf-var .texmf-var.oldsolved the problem. After that, LyX no longer complains about missing .cls files and compiles documents just fine. \nI'm using Ubuntu 12.04, LyX 2.0.7 from https://launchpad.net/~lyx-devel/+archive/release and TeX Live 2012 from https://launchpad.net/~texlive-backports/+archive/ppa.\n\nA: I don't think the problem is Ubuntu specific. I just installed LyX 2.0.5.1 from the Windows binary installer to WinXP. I have exactly the same symptoms - every time I create a new file (or even when I read documentation, via the help menu) LyX complains about the missing .cls files and that it can display the file but cannot typeset. Here, too, Tools/TeX information neatly lists all the imaginable .cls files as available.\nAn extra piece of information: I first installed the LyX as an ordinary user, and then it seemed to work - no warnings about missing .cls files. Compilation of an example LaTeX file also worked just fine. However, the installer had complained during the installation that the .WMF and .EMF graphics wouldn't be available, because they require some library which can only be installed as an administrator. So, I uninstalled, logged in as an admin and reinstalled. From that on I have kept receiving the missing .cls file warnings. LaTeX complilation doesn't work, either: when trying to preview the Welcome file, I get the error message\nFile does not exist: F:/tmp/lyx_tmpdir.gg3264/lyx_tmpbuf4/splash.pdf.\nI have not yet investigated the problem much - my first reaction was to search the web to see whether others have encountered the same problem.

The situation is this:\nI created a directory as /to using sudo and then changed it's permissions to drwxrwsr-x. I also changed the group for the directory to \"xxx\" which exists on my system. I am a member in good standing of group \"xxx\". My understanding is that I should be able to create files and directories in /to since I am a member of group \"xxx\".\nHowever when I run the following command I get permission denied when trying to create each file and directory in /to.\ncp -r from/* /to\n\nWhat am I not understanding about this situation? I can obviously fix this particular instance with sudo or by changing the owner, but I want to understand the principles.\nCommand output\njgossage@Hector:~$ cp -r Downloads/* /Downloads\ncp: cannot create directory /Downloads/Eclipse': Permission denied\ncp: cannot create regular file /Downloads/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb':\nPermission denied\ncp: cannot create directory /Downloads/Kindle': Permission denied\ncp: cannot create directory /Downloads/WindowsDlls': Permission denied\n#Target directory information\njgossage@Hector:~$ ls -al /Downloads\ntotal 8\ndrwxrwsr-x 2 root admins 4096 Feb 13 07:16 .\ndrwxr-xr-x 28 root root 4096 Feb 14 08:23 ..\njgossage@Hector:~$\n\n\nA: Looking at the permissions you set I don't think you have granted \"others\" permissions to write to the directory. Looking at the permissions you've granted \ndrwxrwsr-x\n\nI'm pretty sure that breaks down as: \ntype: d\nowner: rwx (Read/Write/Execute)\ngroup: rws (Read/Write/Special)\nall/others: r-x (Read and Execute)\n\nSince the folder was created as root (sudo) only the root user has access to write to the folder (although as a user you can read the contents of the directory).\nI think to fix the problem you should be able to run: \nsudo chmod o+w /to\n\nNaturally replacing /to with the real folder name/path. This will give ALL users write access to the folder which is probably not ideal. Alternatively you can take ownership of the folder (and all files within the folder): \nsudo chown -R jgossage /to\n\nAgain replacing /to with the real folder name/path. This should keep the directory permissions the same (drwxrwsr-x) which would mean that the owner would have read/write/execute permissions but other users would only have read and execute permissions. \n", "Q: Change launcher icon opacity/brightness Is there any way to reduce the opacity/brightness of launcher icons in Ubuntu 12?\nThey are too vivid and colorful, which distracts me a little. Coders will know.\nIt wouldn't bother me if the launcher was at the bottom or on the right, but it's not possible to move the launcher since version 12.\nReducing the icons' saturation could help a lot too.\n\nA: You can do this with a new tool that several users here on Ask Ubuntu have made.

And the reason that can't happen is because you have no physical Ethernet connection (the link shows NO-CARRIER).\nTo resolve the issue, connect your Ethernet cable.\n\nA: IPv6 address range 2001:db8::/32 is reserved for documentation only and packets with these addresses should never exist on a network. All routers must discard packet with such addresses. Use another address range, e.g. Unique LocaL Addresses fd00::/8 (RFC 4193).

I have Xubuntu 12.10 running fine on a Thinkpad T60. Grub2 is installed as the boot manager and the GRUB....LINUX_DEFAULT is set as \"quiet splash\". Therefore, Grub should display its splash image until plymouth takes over, as I understand it. Unfortunately, it does not. If I hold down shift to get into the boot menu, my splash image shows up, but the screen remains black. I realise it's a minor cosmetic issue, but I have found no way to fix it.\n\nA: First of all, the GRUB splash displays behind the text of the kernel and OS selection screen that you get to by holding Shift during boot. It does not show up by default (unless you are dual booting, although I do not own a copy of windows to my name and am not sure of this) and I don't think it works as a traditional splash (like Plymouth; please someone more knowledgeable correct me here if I am wrong).\nThe splash in the command line determines (on Ubuntu) if plymouth is run at all. Removing it (I often do as my graphics driver does not work well with it anyway) just shuts off the blue xubuntu screen assuming it's showing at all.\nTo make the GRUB menu (and your picture in the background) show up you need to edit the file /etc/default/grub and change the line that says GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0 to the number of seconds you want the menu to display for.\nSo GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=5 for five seconds. Run sudo update-grub and then reboot.\nReference: Grub 2 Basics.\n\nA: An easy way to change grub's background:\n-if you have any image in /boot/grub/, remove them with\nsudo rm image123.jpg\n\n-put your new picture there, copy-and-paste\n-refresh grub with\nsudo update-grub\n\n-Done! Reboot and see.\n\nA: I'm running XUbuntu 12.04 LTS. I went to /etc/default/grub and checked there was some time for grub start-up menu to be seen (GRUB_TIMEOUT set to more than 0).\nWith\nsudo nano /etc/default/grub\n\nI edited the grub settings and added\nGRUB_BACKGROUND=starfleet.jpg\n\nat the end of the file, saving the file afterwards. Then, I copied the file starfleet.jpg to /boot/grub and entered:\nsudo update-grub\n\nAmong other messages, grub-mkconfig reported it found the new background file. After rebooting the system, I had the Startfleet Command logo behind the grub start-up menu.\nOf course, it just appears for the time you allow the menu to be on-screen, with the countdown ticking, before grub starts the default option.\nIt takes way shorter to do it than to describe it.

I want monitor 1 to remain primary, such that the menu bar (using gnome-session-fallback) is located at the top of monitor 1, but I want the bottoms of monitors 1 and 2 to be aligned.  In other words, I want the set up shown below:\n   1680x1050      1920x1080\n\n                  _________\n                 |         |\n                 |         |\n                 |         |\n _____________   |    2    |\n|          -->|  |-->      |\n|             |  |         |\n|      1      |  |         |\n|_____________|  |_________|\n\nGoing to Applications > System Tools > System Settings > Displays, I see the following:\n\nAn obvious apparent solution to my problem would be to simply drag the monitors in the Displays settings such that they are aligned along their bottoms.  However, that causes undesirable behavior.  In particular, that causes the perceived area of monitor 1 to be expanded by presumably the difference between the height of monitor 1 and the height of monitor 2 (after rotation, i.e., as shown in my illustrations above).  In other words, after attempting this solution, my computer thinks that my monitors are as follows:\n  1680x(1920?)    1920x1080\n\n _____________    _________\n|          -->|  |-->      |\n|             |  |         |\n|             |  |         |\n|_____________|  |         |\n|             |  |         |\n                 |         |\n|    FALSE    |  |         |\n                 |         |\n|_  _  _  _  _|  |_________|\n\nTherefore, anything that gets placed in the \"FALSE\" region is not visible because the monitor is not truly large enough to display that region.  For example, if I run Conky with settings configured such that the Conky display appears at the bottom-left corner of my desktop, then Conky will not appear because it's in the FALSE region.  Also, if I repeatedly add items or shortcuts to my desktop, eventually an item will be placed in the FALSE region (since an item gets placed at a non-occupied location on the desktop by default).\nAny idea how I can achieve what I want here?  (For example, is there some way to \"bump\" the pointer by some specified number of pixels vertically when it passes from monitor 1 to monitor 2, and vice versa?)\n\nA: Have you tried arandr? It's a GUI for xrandr and it's perfect to play around with multiple monitors/resolutions.\nsudo aptitude install arandr\n\nHereafter you can see the interface. With the green tick button you can apply the current screen layout and you can also it to a file, which basically contains a xrandr command, to execute it whenever you want, for example at system startup.\n\n\nA: you can easily set the desired position of the two screens with the --pos option of the suggested xrandr command.\nIn your case this would be something like:\nxrandr --output LVDS1 --mode 1680x1050 --auto --output VGA1 --mode 1920x1080 --rotate right --pos 1680x0\n\nFor my quite similar setup this creates two hot corners in either of my two screens in gnome-shell. Don't know about fallback environment though.\nNote that you have to adjust the \"--output\" identifier according to the ones returned by the command xrandr | grep connected.\n\nxrandr --output $1 --mode 1680x1050 --primary --auto --pos 0x240 --output $2 --mode 1920x1080 --rotate right --pos 1680x0\n\nThis should be the proper command. Think of your desktop as huge unified picture with dimension 2730x1920. The primary display (defined by --primary and doesn't have to be the first display configuration in the options) is positioned 240 pixels below the top to align with the 2nd monitor at the bottom. Instead of --pos 1680x0 the second monitor could also be aligned with the --right-of option. Of course you need to replace $1 and $2 with the proper names of the connections as Nix mentioned.\nWith this setup Conky should display properly when configured to align to the lower left as this space is now visible. When it's aligned the top left, you would need to add 240 pixels of spacing in this example. The part with the desktop shortcuts sound like a bug. I recommend not using many desktop shortcuts or not using them at all. :)\nYou could also leave the --mode options out since --auto already does that.\n\nA: Open Additional drivers:\nStart--Preferences--Additional Drivers\n\nInstall recommended drivers for your laptop. After succesfull download and instalation system will reboot. Than after reboot you will have driver's software (Nvidia or ATI), run it as admin and you will have much better control of your monitors than Arandr (or similar software). Set desired settings, save and reboot. That should be it. It worked for me. \n", "Q: Finding all directories with a certain string then changing permissions I'm trying to combine two things.\nI have to set permissions on a number of directories, all of which have \"domain-\" in their name.\nI wanted to \"find all directories in the current directory that have the string 'domain-' in their names and change the permissions to 755.\nI keep getting syntax errors and am so frustrated that I just need to ask!\nthanks\n\nA: I would use the find command:\nfind . -type d -name 'domain-*' -exec chmod 755 {} +\n\n\n\n*\n\n*. specifies the path to search.\n\n*-type d makes this only apply to directories.\n\n*-name ... specifies the name of the directories this should apply to.\n\n*-exec ... {} + is the command that will be run for each collection of matchs.\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu is not there after installation After a lot of trouble with the UEFI-BIOS, my new ASUS 2220, running Windows 8, accepted booting from a live-USB stick with Ubuntu 12.04 on it. Even better: installation of Ubuntu ran without any problem. I wanted to try to make a dual-boot system, just like I had on a equally new laptop.Two partitions of 160 Gig were proposed and accepted.\nHowever, there is no option to choose Ubuntu, the system is stubbornly sending me to Windows. Whatever I try, no way.\nI suspect that it has something to do with Win8. On the laptop I tried to do the same after doing the upgrade to Win8, but had to completely reinstall Win7. I tried to find an answer, but the combination Win8 and Ubuntu does not come forward.\nHelp! Where to look, how to correct this?\nExtra question: what does GRUB mean or do? seems to be important, but I can't find the link.\nThanks a lot in advance.\n\nA: Windows 8 comes with secure boot turned on, which means the firmware on a motherboard will check, at boot time, to see if the operating system that is trying to boot is genuine; this check is done by means of cryptographic keys. It is ostensibly meant to prevent boot-time malware from infecting Windows 8; coincidentally, it also serves to make it pretty hard for a user to boot any other operating system on said machine.\nPress F8 or F9 while the system boots to bring up the boot options. from here you can choose Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu with a DVD on a Mac I tried burning a dvd with Ubuntu on it and every time I put it in my computer it says it cant read it. I don't think it's downloading a version for Mac but I just got it from ubuntu.com. I think it may be downloading as the windows version or something because I tried burning it twice and the same thing happened both times. And I'm using a DVD+R incase that matters and I'm burning it with disk utility and I'm using the speed 4x to burn it. And I'm running OS X 10.8.2. What should I do? And I don't what to buy a copy of the cd from the site.\nAlso is there any reason I shouldn't get 12.10 instead of 12.04?\n\nA: Maybe you didn't burn the DVD correctly. Did you open up the disk utility and clicked on the \"Burn\" icon and then selected the ubuntu .iso?\n", "Q: Is there an archiver/ file manager providing multiple information during archive extraction? I would like one that would provide during action some more information like percentage and speed.\nWhen archives are big the process takes a lot of time and resources, and the computer seem to lag, while this info is not displayed. So I need in such cases to see more stuff to be sure that everything is running as it should. \nFor this purpose I use 7zip in Wine at the present.\n\nIs it possible to have a native application like that?\n\nA: I want to add as part of the definitive answer another application: b1 free archiver. More on B1 in the second part of this.\n\nBut first I want to mention some supplementary problems with the most used archivers .\nWhat I am saying here may be limited to my use of Xfce/Thunar, so the conclusions may not apply in Nautilus and Unity.\nXarchiver and Squeeze do not seem able to open archives protected by password. Xarchiver gives an error and Squeeze seems to extract endlessly with no result (also, it cannot handle 7z archives, as far as I can tell). Archive manager can handle password protected archives. \nAssociating an archive with another archiver other than these three, like Peazip or B1 and using a context menu command like 'extract here' would open a window prompting to select as archive manager one of the three mentioned above.\n\nI am not aware of a solution to this problem in Thunar (which is also mentioned here in relation to PCManFM). But b1 has options for Nautilus to integrate the context menu - see the end of this answer.\n\nNow, concerning b1 archiver.\nIn a way it may partially be a solution to the Thunar's context menu problem as it does not really need the context menu association: unlike Peazip, with B1, associating an archive type and opening it (e.g. by double click) would open a window providing a list of options, each of which can be set as default by checking 'remember my choice' or by setting the default action ('ask me' is the action by default). That is, if so decided, the archive can be extracted just by double clicking on it.\n\n\n\nB1 is able to handle (open and extract) the most used archive formats as well as its own type.\n\nBut it is rather limited when it comes to creating archives: only its native format and zip (with no advanced options) are supported. Even worse, I was not able to create a b1-archive: the process ended invariably with an error. Zip-archiving works. I trust this will be fixed soon.\n\n(Oddly, the program settings do not seem available from the main interface (when just executing the program), but only from the smaller window - clicking 'Set the default action'.)\nThis archiver provides the main info demanded in this question, and also looks more elegant than other solutions.\n\nIt seems that the program can integrate the context menu in Nautilus.\n\n\nUpdate 2017\nThere is a a new (beta) file manager that provides, among other features, the required info during archive extraction: Polo. It comes from the creator of other popular software (Grub Customizer is one) - more here: TeeJeeTech.\nsudo apt-add-repository -y ppa:teejee2008/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install polo-file-manager\n\nIt shows something like this during extraction (click to enlarge):\n\n(details depending on the theme; in the above image it follows the gtk3 theme Victory-16.04 in Xfce)\n\nA: One program that would be suitable is peazip, which isn't available in the repositories, but can be found at the sourceforge page noted above. Just download the appropriate deb file and install it with gdebi or software-center. There is a choice of gtk2 or qt gui, but the gtk2 version is recommended currently and seems to be the most stable.\nIt is important to note that it will extract a large number of formats (150+) such as iso, udf, rar, etc, but will only create a smaller number of formats such as zip, bz2, 7z, xz, etc, but the most well known ones are available. Specialist tools for the rarer formats are always needed anyway. \nFull details are available on the sourceforge page, which also details the file management options of peazip, and how it handles password protected files.\nPeazip is straightforward to use, but here's an example extract of an iso file:\n1) Start peazip from your applications menu or from terminal and click extract when the gui loads up:\n\n2) Extracting the archive: progress bar, speed, and several other menus that contain information on the ongoing extract are shown:\n\nRegarding Thunar integration, peazip doesn't seem to have any command line options for directly opening an archive and extracting, so the best you can do is create a thunar custom action (more information in this answer) and simply place peazip %f in the box and select the appearance conditions as 'other'. Now when you right click a valid archive you can select your thunar action and open the archive in peazip and then click to extract it.\n", "Q: Why does it take so long for ssh to decide there was an error? I use ssh to log onto my server. Sometimes, I leave it connected and go away from the computer, in which time the computer goes to power saving mode (or whatever it's called - the screen just goes black).\nWhen I come back and try doing anything in that terminal window, nothing appears to happen. Though after at least 10 minutes it eventually says \"write failed: broken pipe\".\nMy question is, what's the deal with the massive delay? Why does it take so long to decide that it can no longer connect to the server? Is there any way to reduce that time, besides just closing the terminal and starting afresh?\n\nA: you could debug ssh by types in ssh -vvv ... This will not only debug the login but also debugs the sessions.  It can get somewhat annoying when it continually throws in the debug however.  The amount of 'v's determines the amount of debug which is active in the sessions (the more v's the more levels of debuging).  I'm not positive this will help identify the problem but it could help track it down.  Usually there is a stay alive time set in your client ssh that will send \"pings\" to tell the server that you are still connected here is where that variable is set:\n/etc/ssh/sshd_config \nClientAliveInterval 30\nClientAliveCountMax 5 \n\nWhere\n    ClientAliveInterval: Sets a timeout interval in seconds (30) after which if no data has been received from the client, sshd will send a message through the encrypted channel to request a response from the client. The default is 0, indicating that these messages will not be sent to the client. This option applies to protocol version 2 only.\n    ClientAliveCountMax: Sets the number of client alive messages (5) which may be sent without sshd receiving any messages back from the client. If this threshold is reached while client alive messages are being sent, sshd will disconnect the client, terminating the session.\nIf you alter those settings make sure to restart sshd via this command:\n/etc/init.d/ssh restart\n\nHope this helps!\n\nA: Never found a true answer to this question, although interestingly on Mac the timeout delay is much, much shorter (maybe 30 seconds).\nHowever, I found that you can type ~. (tilde then period) to close the session immediately. So if the SSH becomes unresponsive I just do this.\n", "Q: How do I reset my password?

That’s it.\n\nNote that you should unlock on the right top corner before you could change user accounts.\n", "Q: upgrade gone bad, no ubuntu, no upgrade, no windows I have a hand me down laptop that I don't know the windows password for. Ubuntu worked fine until I allowed it to update. Sadly, it got stuck for hours then shut off and when I turned it on it will not boot into the new Ubuntu, the old Ubuntu, or Windows (since I don't have the password). Should I delete everything, get a live cd, and install Ubuntu again?\nI tried to load ophcrack to get my Windows password but it will not boot.\n\nA: If you have documents on the hard disk that are important and don't exist anywhere else, then you should boot from a live CD/DVD or live USB and back them up.\nThen, you can probably fix the problem. As Vreality says, you should describe to us how it fails to boot. Here are the most likely possibilities:\nIt immediately fails when you select Ubuntu.\nIf that happens, reinstall GRUB to the MBR:\n\n*\n\n*How can I repair grub? (How to get Ubuntu back after installing Windows?)\n(Your problem was not caused by a recent Windows installation, but this still may fix it.)\n\n*Or, equivalently, any of these methods.\n\nIt freezes on the Ubuntu splash screen.\nIf you see the Ubuntu logo and colored dots in the middle of a purple screen, and it never gets past that, then you'll have to provide more information. Press Escape to reveal what's \"behind\" the splash screen. If that doesn't work, try pressing it earlier--right when that screen appears.\nIt boots to a black screen.\nPress Ctrl+Alt+F1, log in with your username and password (don't worry that nothing appears on the screen as you enter your password). You should get a prompt that ends with $ _ (where _ is a blinking cursor).\nNow repair your system and finish the update:\nsudo dpkg --configure -a\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get -f install\nsudo apt-get -y upgrade\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\n(You can attempt to switch back to the GUI with Alt+F7 but it won't immediately work; the easiest way after those commands complete is to reboot. To do this safely, press Ctrl+Alt+Delete--that reboots when you're in a virtual console--or run sudo reboot.)\nIf you cannot get a login screen, or running those commands don't fix the problem, see:\n\n*\n\n*My computer boots to a black screen, what options do I have to fix it?\n\n*How to get GUI back after freeze interrupted an Nvidia driver update?\n(Only do this if you have an Nvidia card!)\n\nIf fixing this proves difficult, you might want to reinstall.\nAn alternative would be to boot from a live CD/DVD or live USB and chroot into your system, mounting the necessary filesystems and trying an update. I would have to attempt this on a recent Ubuntu release to write a good guide for it in your situations, and I would also need more details about the problems you've had.\nBut the procedure will be similar to the methods detailed here; you will be performing different actions than installing a kernel, though. (Depending on the nature of the problem, which would be revealed by a more detailed description of what happens when you try to boot, perhaps these.)\nA general point about lost passwords.\nIf you lose your password to any system (Ubuntu, Windows, or anything else), it is overkill to try to crack the password. Unless your passwords are very easy, this will usually fail or at least take a very, very long time. Furthermore, unless disk or home directory encryption is used, nothing bad comes from the password being lost forever. Instead of trying to recover the password, you should instead reset it to something new.\nIf you ever lose your Ubuntu password, you can reset it with one of these methods.\nResetting Windows passwords is beyond the scope of Ask Ubuntu, but you can:\n\n*\n\n*Search the web. I recommend searching for sethc.exe (which is involved in one of the most common methods).\n\n*If you have trouble, ask somewhere Windows is supported, like Super User.\n\n\nA: You have a few options, some of which will work depending on what's broken.\nIf you can get in to Ubuntu but it doesn't work the way your think it should, then you can try and log in without graphics. To do this, you can boot Ubuntu and then press Ctrl+Alt+F1. After that, just log in with your normal username and password. If you can log in there, then you can try to run:\nsudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade\n\nIf that doesn't work, your Xorg may be broken; you may be able to fix it with this:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg \n\nIf that doesn't work or you can't log in, then try the following:\nLoad the recovery option if you can still load GRUB (I assume you can if you can load Windows). Then, select the recovery option. Note that you may have to select \"Advanced Options for Ubuntu\" and then something like \"Ubuntu, with Linux 3.5.0-23-generic (recovery mode)\" Finally, you can attempt to fix it by enabling networking and then reconfiguring the packages (both of these should be menu options in the recovery menu).\nIf neither of the above work, or you don't feel comfortable trying them, then you can get an Ubuntu Live USB or CD (I'm assuming you can if you could get Ophcrack) and then boot into that. Then, get a flashdrive, hard drive, or online storage service (you could use mega.co.nz and then use goo.gl or a similar service to shorten the URL to something you could write down) and backup your files there. Then, just install the latest Ubuntu and then copy the files back over after installing it again.\nIf you want to try and get Windows working again, you can change the password instead of trying to recover it with Ophcrack. chntpw is the typical way to do this. If you can get a live USB with Ubuntu on it, then you can take a look at this guide (although it is a bit dated, so it'll look different on a newer release)\n", "Q: Booting Ubuntu 12.04 from a USB fails on my VAIO I have already set everything up in BIOS to look for the USB first.

I've been experiencing severe stability issues for the past couple days, and I've narrowed it down to being a part of X, since everything goes back to normal for a bit when I restart lightdm.\nI use one of those video driver PPAs that builds packages right from git, which I know is at my own risk. I've already tried using synaptic to force a version of xserver-xorg-intel from a more stable PPA, and that didn't have much effect, but the version of libdrm currently in the repo dates from the same time as these problems began, so I imagine that's the culprit. However, when I try to use synaptic to force a stable version of the various libdrm packages (-intel and :i386 and so forth), it warns me that virtually every application in my system that depend on X will have to be removed as well. Needless to say, I don't want to have to do this. Do I have a reasonable option other than waiting for the PPA (oibaf, if anyone's curious) to update again?\nUnfortunately, I already did an apt-get clean when I thought the stability issues might be due to dpkg corruption, so I don't have a slightly older version locally to revert to.\n\nA: Solved it. I had to mark packages for upgrade in a specific order so as to trigger the fewest possible number of broken dependencies, then unmark those that had been triggered in the correct order (and some of them simultaneously, i.e. wine and wine:i386 which depend on each other). The machine hasn't been up for long enough to know whether I've resolved my issue, but this is definitely the best idea I've had so far!\n", "Q: Suspend doesn't happen when laptop lid closes - awesome wm I've installed awesome as my windows manager.\nHowever, it doesn't seem to respect the power options from lightdm; if I'm at the login screen shutting the lid will trigger suspend.\nOnce I log into the awesome wm, however, this no longer happens.\n\nA: It no longer happens because power management is different between lightdm and the the session you log in to. Each session is expected to handle its own power management, for various reasons, and so you will need to run a power manager with your WM to get this feature to work as you wish.\nA good power manager for the task would be xfce4-power-manager, which you can get in the repos. You can set it to suspend when the lid is closed.

To enable it, you can do this at a terminal:\nsudo dpkg --add-architecture i386\nsudo apt-get update\n\nAs of this writing, the steam and steam64 debs in the software center are out of date (1.0.0.26) and contain Beta warnings.

I cant find any confirmation anywhere. Does anyone know?\nIf it is not supported, is support planned?\n\nA: As you can find on wikipedia Apt-X is a \"family of proprietary audio codecs\". That's another way of saying they want money for it. While open source is good in many things, it's a legal problem to circumvent Apt-X patents and implement it without paying.\nHence, at present Apt-X support on Linux is very unlikely, at least as long it is not as widely spread as say mp3...\n\nA: Sennheiser BTD 500 USB, Bluetooth 3.0 provides APT-X on Linux including Ubuntu.  It does it by posing as a audio device, not a bluetooth radio.  So it handles the APT-X in hardware rather than software on the OS side.\n", "Q: Command-Line only version of Lubuntu So I visited the Lubuntu download page (specifically because it's lightweight), which happens to be hosted in the Ubuntu Help section of it's website. I tried to find a version of Lubuntu similar to Ubuntu Server (no GUI, visible stacks), but I couldn't find any. Any feedback is appreciated.\n\nA: The only difference between Ubuntu and Lubuntu is that they both use different Desktop Environments and some different packages. Ubuntu uses Unity whereas Lubuntu uses LXDE.\nAccording to Lubuntu Wiki:\n\nBoth Lubuntu and Ubuntu share Two Major Important Things:\nSame Core System\nSame Repositories \n\nLubuntu and Ubuntu belong to the same family and talking about each as\n  totally different two systems is not correct since they have some\n  things in common.\nThe differences between Lubuntu and Ubuntu are:\nDifferent DE - Lubuntu uses LXDE while Ubuntu uses Unity as the default DE.\nDifferent Default Applications \n\nOther than that, they are the same. The DE is what makes Lubuntu a\n  lightweight OS, and of course the selected applications too because we\n  make sure to use the lightest applications which are not resource\n  hungry.\n\nSo, essentially Ubuntu Server with no GUI would be the same as Lubuntu Server with no GUI. Hence, you can go on downloading Ubuntu Server and install LXDE later, if you want a Lubuntu like GUI.\n", "Q: XPS 13 Dual Boot New 1080p Edition 2xUSB 3.0 I just got the newest version of the XPS 13 yesterday.

However, both slots of this newest version are USB 3.0!!\nI've even tried using an external DVD drive with a live CD.\nUsing the above instructions verbatim, at best the system reboots and ignores the USB/DVD.  At worst, it seems to hang and do nothing.  It actually has me a little concerned that it would actually recognize a rescue USB for Windows 8!!\nWhere it usually hangs is when I follow the instructions:\n\nIn Windows 8 find the power off icon (i.e. hit the bottom-left corner and select settings) press it and select reboot while holding the shift key down\nSelect \"Use a device\" (again translated from IT)\nSelect \"USB Storage Device\"  <--- Hangs, often leaving a faded screen with the options\n\nI have even tried making a USB option in the Bios.  The problem with that, upon the next reboot, it seems to not see the USB stick that's still in the slot!!\nI bought this machine purely with the intention of dual-booting.  It's a beautifully awesome machine.\n\nA: Dual-boot on the XPS13 detailed on http://debian.netside.net/xps13_linux.html\nWhile the setup described nukes Windows 8, you could easily keep Windows and install Linux alongside on the HD - just shrink the 222G ntfs partition #5 and use the free space to create your Linux partitions. I needed all of the disk to install two versions of Linux, so Windows is gone. It is best to first install a working Linux version on a USB stick and then use gdisk from shell to partition properly.\n\nA: I had this problem on the new XPS13. I tried to boot using a USB 3 pendrive, and an external usb 3 HDD, on which i'd put the Ubuntu installer for 13.04 using the start-up disc creator tool in Ubuntu.  Neither of these booted. I added the manual entry for usb boot as detailed in the other thread you linked to and that didn't work either.  (I had secure boot on, rapid start off).  I didn't test in legacy mode because in UEFI mode I found that my old 20GB USB2 HDD booted fine, and i could install Ubuntu. So the equivalent of the trick of using the LHS USB(2) port on the previous version of the laptop is to find out an old USB 2.0 stick.  With secure boot enabled boot repair complained, so I still don't have the familiar GRUB OS selector.  However pressing F12 during boot allows you to choose windows, and it boots fine. On restart it boots straight back into Ubuntu if you don't interrupt it.\n", "Q: Why does unity freeze randomly? I've been running Ubuntu 12.04 for a while now with no problems. Overall, the only kind of instability I've had is that the system will occasionally lock up completely under prolonged full cpu usage.\nMy current problem, though, is that Unity constantly freezes. Often, the whole thing doesn't freeze. Usually, only part of it freezes. For example, any open windows will lock up but the launcher will remain responsive, or vice-versa.\nI can find no abnormal resource use associated with these freezes, though. That and the fact that I can often restore responsiveness by clicking somewhere on the status bar at the top make me inclined to think that this is a bug in Unity, and not, say, an issue with the graphics driver.\nIf it's of any use, though, I do have a PCIE Radeon card for which I am using the proprietary drivers, but I was able to use this for a month before I encountered this problem.\nAnother thing that I've noticed is that the problem often manifests itself the most soon after a start-up. As soon as the system runs for a few minutes, the problem becomes significantly reduced. Has anyone experienced something similar, and, of so, how did you fix it?\n\nA: From what you described, it sounds like your experiencing a common issue with apt's update check, which runs as soon as you log in for the first time, and causes the CPU usage to spike for a while. It's harmless, and usually goes away after a few minutes.\nIn such cases, the best thing to do is to be patient and not do too much immediately after starting the system, since most systems (think, core2duo, 4GB Ram, and such like :), will not be able to handle the workload too smoothly.\nUnfortunately, I don't know of any sure fire fix for this at this point in time.\n", "Q: Computer froze during Ubuntu install and now computer won't post and no BIOS A few minutes ago I was installing Ubuntu 12.10 on my Windows 7 machine and it froze during the installation.

That's it, it will not be used for anything else.\nI know the processor isn't good enough to transcode most HD content on the fly but I'm trying to maximize what I can get out of this machine for the next 6-9 months at which point I will probably invest into a more powerful machine.\nSo, getting back to the question on hand: should I go with Ubuntu Desktop version or Ubuntu Server edition?\nThanks, really appreciate the input.\n\nA: Personally, I've tried both in a home server context and I stick with Desktop now.\nThere's nothing I've lacked on the desktop version and I get to use the graphical environment I know and love.\nIf you're still using the external HDD in it's NAS capacity, the only issue I've had is permanently mounting SMB shares in Linux. I'm having difficulty getting the user accounts to line up (there's supposed to auto match up by user account name, but in my situation, they don't)\nIf you're dedicating it behind the server (USB or just putting it inside the machine) you will of course have no such issues.\nIf, in the future, you're looking for a really sorted NAS, I recommend anything by Synology.\nExcept of course I can't get the SMB share permissions to work yet.\nI probably should just use NFS.\n", "Q: If I get Ubuntu, can I still have Windows 7 on my HP Pavilion i5 DV6 Laptop? Like can I easily switch between Windows 7 and Ubuntu easily without any risk?\n\nA: You can use Wubi to install it or to make dual boot menu . Go to >>>  http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/windows-installer \n", "Q: Installed Ubuntu 12.04 alongside Windows7, now win7 wants me to format drive D? I have an ssd boot drive and a Hard disk drive, C: and D: respectively. I just installed Ubuntu 12.04 alongside windows 7 and when I rebooted to go to windows, drive D says it must be formatted. Is there anyway to fix this? Or will I lose all my data on that drive?\n\nA: You didn't mention exactly how you installed both os. A quick fix if D is the drive where you installed ubuntu, would be to go to windows and remove drive later from computer management. Go to Computer-Right click- Management- Disk management and remove 'D' Letter from that drive. now windows will not detect it. Tell me if some thing else that you have asked.\n\nA: Even if you installed Ubuntu on D:, you might not lose almost your data. Please don't install Ubuntu once you have well prepared a partition to install Ubuntu on. And if your data is very important, now you may want to ask for a service to recover your drive. Because you have just installed Ubuntu for a time, so your data is recoverable.\nIf you did not install Ubuntu on D:, but on a partition which was a part of D: previously, just run \"cmd\" from Run, then \"chkdsk D:\" to check the disk.\nBecause W7 still detects D:, so don't worry too much, just ask for someone who's good at this problem to help you check D: and recover your drive's files, that's for your drive's safety!

I can boot into Ubuntu just fine as a guest but it refuses to accept my login name and password that were set during the Wubi install. I reinstalled it again with basic login and password just to make sure and it still won't let me in.\n\nA: There have been some reports of this. It's not clear what the cause is, but you can try resetting the password as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*After selecting Ubuntu hold down the Shift key until the Grub menu appears. If you're using Windows 8, the computer will restart - in this case as soon as the BIOS screen disappears hold down then Shift key.\n\n*Select the second entry, Advanced Options.\n\n*Again, select the second entry for Recovery mode. It will boot to a recovery menu.\n\n*Select Remount drives as read/write\n\n*Select Root shell\n\n*Check your username by entering:\nls /home\n\n*Reset your password (replacing  with your Ubuntu username which you saw under /home):\npasswd <username>\n\n*Enter exit to leave the shell and then select Resume normal boot\ne.g.\nroot@ubuntu:~# ls /home\nbcbc\nroot@ubuntu:~# passwd bcbc\nEnter new UNIX password:\nRetype new UNIX password:\n\n", "Q: Which Nvidia driver should I use?

These extensions are among a few listed in /usr/share/mime/packages/x-retext-markdown.xml.\nIn these three cases, when I right-click on them and look at their properties, they're all \"plain text documents\".\nIf I try touch ~/Desktop/abcd.rst or touch ~/Desktop/abcd.rest, these files do open in ReText when double-clicked. These extensions are present in /usr/share/mime/packages/x-retext-rst.xml. These files are of type \"reStructuredText document\".\nThe image below illustrates what I see when I right-click on files with .md, .mkd or .markdown extensions (top left), or on files with .rest or .rst extensions (top right). The lower image is the view PCManFM takes of files with .mkd and .rst files. \n \nEven when right-clicking and going into Open With ... followed by the second Open With ... shows basically the same thing. The file with a .mkd extension is seen as a \"plain text\" file whereas the one with a .rst extension is seen as a reStructured Text file:\n\nWhile it's quite possible that I've unintentionally tweaked something somewhere, can someone set things right for me?\nJust to be clear, these files are empty so their content isn't an issue:\n[11:10 AM] ~/Desktop $ file abcd*\nabcd.markdown: empty\nabcd.md:       empty\nabcd.mkd:      empty\nabcd.rest:     empty\nabcd.rst:      empty\n\nThe contents of /usr/share/applications/retext.desktop are:\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nName=ReText\nComment=Simple text editor for Markdown and reStructuredText\nCategories=Office;TextEditor;\nExec=/usr/bin/retext %F\nType=Application\nIcon=retext\nMimeType=text/x-retext-markdown;text/x-retext-rst;\n\n***** ReText was updated to 3.1.4 but the issue remains.\n\nA: You can probably try with mimeopen, which is a tool used to pair a specific mimetype with a particular application. \nUse a file with .mkd extension as a parameter of mimeopen.\nAs an example:\n$ mimeopen file.mkd \nPlease choose a default application for files of type text/x-retext-markdown\n\n    1) ReText  (retext)\n    2) GNU Emacs 23  (emacs23)\n    3) gedit  (gedit)\n    4) LibreOffice Writer  (libreoffice-writer)\n    5) Other...\n\nuse application #\n\nNow, enter the number of the application (in this case, 1) and all .mkd files should now open in Retext.\n\nA: You should be able too (I can after a quick LXDE install) right click on a file and choose \"Properties\".  \n\nThere should (according to what I find) be a tab called \"Open With\".  \n\nSelect \"ReText\" and then \"Set as Default\".  That worked for me.  \n", "Q: Public IP Address for LXC container Ok, so I want to know how to do networking on LXC containers. Not just the sort of vague information you get from the other websites, but a true beginner's guide to making them work.. Since most examples are basically setup for people to test with, I want to run a service on one...like a web server for example.\nI am running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and I have LXC installed and I can make, start and stop a container. My server obviously has a public facing IP and I would like to know how to setup a container so it too can have a public IP. Since there already seems to be a bridge in place from my current container it would seem that I either need to give the containers a DHCP range that is public for them to work off or manually assign a static IP address to my container.\nIf I want to statically assign an IP to the container, how do I do that? \nDo I need to make any changes to my bridge config on the host?\nIs it actually better to do it with the MACVLAN option?\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\nA: My approach assumes that your server has a single NIC, and you need to share that NIC between the host and the LXC guests. This involves using a bridge. The bridge owns and manages eth0. The host now configures its own networking on br0 instead of eth0. The LXC guests are configured to connect to the bridge.\n\n\n*\n\n*On the host, sudo apt-get install bridge-utils.\n\n*On the host, replace eth0 with a bridge:\nThis is dangerous. Get this wrong and you could be locked out of your server. Be sure to have a local login enabled and that local console access works, so that you can revert this change if you have any problems.\nIn /etc/network/interfaces:\n\n\n*\n\n*Replace auto eth0 with auto br0.\n\n*Replace:\niface eth0 inet dhcp\n\nwith:\niface br0 inet dhcp\n    bridge_ports eth0\n\nIf you had a static network configuration, then you'd replace:\niface eth0 inet static\n    address ...\n    netmask ...\n    gateway ...\n    etc.\n\nwith:\niface br0 inet static\n    bridge_ports eth0\n    address ...\n    netmask ...\n    gateway ...\n    etc.\n\nYou're just changing eth0 for br0 and adding the bridge_ports eth0 line.\n\n*Reboot the host. If you were doing this locally, then running sudo ifdown eth0 before you started, and sudo ifup br0 afterwards would also do. Note that the bridge can take a little time to come up, so give it five minutes after reboot before you assume that all is lost.\n\n\n*To move a given named LXC container over to a public IP:\n\n\n*\n\n*Stop the container.\n\n*On the host, edit /var/lib/lxc/container_name/config and change lxc.network.link to br0.\n\n*On the host, edit /var/lib/lxc/container_name/rootfs/etc/network/interfaces and configure your public IP as you would normally (DHCP or a static configuration as needed). Note that the interface is still called eth0 from the point of view of the container.\n\n*Restart the container.\n\n\n*To change the default for new LXC containers, edit /etc/lxc/default.conf on the host and change lxc.network.link to br0.\n\n*If you don't need the LXC-provided NAT bridge at all (ie. all your containers will use the new bridge instead), then on the host edit /etc/default/lxc and change USE_LXC_BRIDGE to \"false\", and then on the host run sudo service lxc restart.\n\nA: Robie, thank you so much for posting this answer, I have been taring my hair out trying to get this going and this has been the only method that has worked!\nI thought I should mention a few things I figured out in order to help clarify the instructions for other admins.\nMy host had multiple static ip aliases assigned to eth0 on the guest, for example:\niface eth0:1 inet static\n  address 5.5.5.5\n  netmask 255.255.255.5\n  gateway 5.5.5.1\netc.\n\nNow we don't want to set up br0 the same way, we just want one IP with no aliases like Robie indicated above.\nSo let's say you want 5.5.5.5 to be assigned to the container debian8. \nEdit /var/lib/lxc/debian8/etc/network/interfacesand add:\niface eth0 inet static \n      address 5.5.5.5\n      netmask 255.255.255.5\n      gateway 5.5.5.1\n    etc.\n\nThen issue this command: route add default gw <gateway-ip, in my case 5.5.5.1>\nAfter that, reboot the container and everything should finally work! :)\n\nA: I had the same problem and I have this solution (quick and dirty).\nserver: eth0 = 10.1.0.77/24\nserver: lxdbr0 (lxd bridge) = 10.255.255.77/24\n\ncontainer: eth0 = 10.255.255.100/24 (same network as lxdbr0)\ncontainer: eth0:0 = 194.99.99.99/28  (public ip address on eth0 alias)\n\nOn the server: route add -host 194.99.99.99 gw 10.255.255.100 dev lxdbr0\nAlso, if needed add route to upstream routers. \nProbably, not the best solution but requires no great effort!\nCheers.\n", "Q: Vi - insert mode doesn't work in Ubuntu 12.10 I am working on Ubuntu 12.10. Insert mode in vi isn't working.\n\nWhen I hit i to go insert mode, nothing happens. On hitting i again writes i on terminal, but <-backspace doesn't remove the character. Only Delete works there.\nDo I need to configure anywhere?\n\nA: Its not that insert mode doesnt work. But the vi editor you are using is the older version and is different to use than our usual editors. Get updated version of vi editor by-\nsudo apt-get install vim \n\n\nA: Installing VIM will probably solve that issue\nsudo aptitude install vim\n\nit actually has to work though, it might be that compatibility mode is on therefore you will be in the insert mode but VI won't tell you.\nEither way using vim is recommended, its basically V i  IM proved.\n", "Q: ubuntu server to support unlimited or 100+ telnet users I am new to ubuntu.\nI have installed ubuntu server 12.10 and I want it to support unlimited or 100+ telnet instances or sessions.

This can be installed with\nsudo apt-get install xinetd telnetd\n\nInformation about these package can be found here: xinetd telnetd\n\nConfiguration\n\nIn /etc/inetd.conf there are configuration options (listed this one because it also has the option to set the amount of connections/users): \n\n# Simple configuration file for xinetd\n#\n# Some defaults, and include /etc/xinetd.d/\ndefaults\n{\n# Please note that you need a log_type line to be able to use log_on_success\n# and log_on_failure. The default is the following :\n# log_type = SYSLOG daemon info\ninstances = 60\nlog_type = SYSLOG authpriv\nlog_on_success = HOST PID\nlog_on_failure = HOST\ncps = 25 30\n}\n\n\n\n*\n\n*instances is the number of connections and unlimited can be used instead of a number.\n\n*There is also /etc/services where you can change the port number where telnet should listen too.\n\n*And there is /etc/xinetd.d/telnet where you can set up IP ranges that are allowed (only_from =) or disallowed (no_access =) access and also access time (access_times =).\n\n\n\n(Re-)starting telnet service\n\nTo apply changes you then need to restart services with\nsudo /etc/init.d/xinetd restart \n\n\n-- Warning --\nTelnet is fast but also insecure. It sends all your text, including your password, in plain text that can be read by anyone with the right tools. SSH, on the other hand, encrypts all your communication and so is more resource-intensive but secure even a government security agency sniffing your packets for some reason would still have a hard time cracking the encryption.

The first issue I came across is, from what I can tell, Ubuntu doesn't like Windows 7 computers with UEFI and with 3TB HDD.\nI'm not exactly sure how to fix these issues and simply tried reinstalling it with a reformatted USB of Ubuntu because I assumed originally that the problem lie within the original USB install. However, upon trying it a second and third time I can no longer access Firefox as it goes to a black command prompt-esque screen which tells me about checksumming and seems to freeze there or it will go to the Ubuntu login screen. This happens with Amazon and Firefox from what I've tried so I assume it might be something with how it connects to the internet is messed up as well. \nI haven't been able to exactly find anything that helps me all too much as I am very new to the Linux scene and am not familiar with most of the jargon as of yet so I would most likely need a very simply said explanation as to what I am to do to get it off the ground and installed properly, as the closest I've gotten to getting it installed, is it asking whether I want dual boot or HDD override (which I prefer dual boot if that helps guide me through this).\nThank you for reading this and I hope to find a few people who are able to figure out my issues as I have used every kind of method I could think of at the moment and am at a loss.\n\nA: Try Downloading Unetbootin and use that to create your USB.

Deny other users. possible? i've seen this answer, but it requires the partition to always be mounted (and do the user access via group perms on the root FS that mounted the NTFS)\nWhat i'm hopping to be possible, is to allow only a couple users to initiate the mount of the partition.\nI will rarely have need to mount that partition, and leaving it mounted all the time is just asking for trouble on a portable that will be sleeping/waking/and moving a lot.\nis it possible? something like:\nfstab:\n/dev/sda1 /windows ntfs noauto,user=userA,user=userB,rw 0 0\n\nAnd ideally, requiring the user the type in the password to confirm. I have no idea what happens on the gui land... but trying to learn. if this was a regular server, i'd simply add them to sudoers with that mount point allowed.\nI think ultimately i will just make them 2 administrators of the machine. But i wanted to avoid that.\n\nA: In fstab you can also use\nuid=1000,gid=1000,permissions 0 2\n\nto specify a user, group and permissions to make the mount more specific. If you put those 2 users in a new group and use that ID during the mount they own the disc and can write to it. \nBut ... \nI would not mount the disc automatically at all and mount it only when those 2 users log into the system. Basically when those users log in, start a script that mounts the disc. If you still want a password you can enforce that in the script and if you add in a configuration file you could put the user names in there (so it is easy to add new or remove obsolete users). \n", "Q: Will Ubuntu do any damage to my files installed on windows?

From CHM2PDF_TEMP_WORK_DIR and CHM2PDF_TEMP_ORIG_DIR, the chm2pdf computes its orig and work dirs by adding the basename of the CHM file (without the .chm ending). So if you give it /home/chris/my-file.chm to convert, it will use /tmp/chm2pdf/work/my-file as work directory and /tmp/chm2pdf/orig/my-file as orig directory. It expands the files contained in the CHM file into the orig directory, then copies the ones it needs into its work dir and continues there.

I'd suggest 12.04, if you're not willing to upgrade. 12.10(And 13.04 soon), I'd suggest those two if you'd want a more \"fancy\" feature-updated machine.\nNew features in 12.10 is listed here: http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/whats-new - And if you can go without those, I'd install 12.04.\n\nA: I moved from 12.04 64bit to 12.1064bit on my desktop machine and run 12.04Lts on my servers.\nFrom a technical aspect?..  I don't have enough reliable technical knowledge to offer any advice that would be constructive.\nFrom a usability perspective.  12.10 seems smoother and a little sharper.  It's video is more polished.  On my 64bit 3.0ghz 8gb ram Dell 780 desktop it's beautifully smooth.\nThe 12.04 seemed a little more stable, with the qualifier that I play a little and have destroyed more installs than I can remember :)\nI'm using Unity at home and xcfe at work after going through KDE, LXDE (this is worth having a look at with lower than 4gb ram machines) and Gnome.\nYou can install gnome desktop on any of the Ubuntu flavours, but a direct download and install is more convenient and a little tighter integrated. KUbuntu(kde), XUbuntu(Xfce) LUbuntu(Lxde).\nCan I  suggest you download a few and make some bootable cd's, give 'em a whirl and see what you think?  If your still unsure you can install different desktop environments through out the different Ubuntu flavours.\nI've warmed to Unity, but as it turns out with customisations all over the place, it now looks and behaves more like a mac (after spending 20 years on windows), go figure! :)\nAlways remember,  Linux can't be judged as an \"operating system\" in the same vane windows is. It's actually a usability experience.  You can do what ever your imagination can conjure, including customising the environment you work to an unrecognisable point.\nLinux enables you to run a $50 Rasberry Pi as a home media server, or run a Particle Accelerator buried under Switzerland and go hunting for Higgs particles :)  I'd be guessing you and I somewhere between :)  Which gives us enormous choice.\nGo Play!\nQuick tip!  Run at least 2 partitions!  one as a home partition and one for boot.\nAfter trashing so many installs (Entirely my fault, nothing to do with Ubuntu or Linux. I poke screw drivers into light sockets :) )  Having your /home directory on a separate partition is a god send! :)  And do backups!  Damn it!\n\nA: I think it all depends on when you will upgrade your reinstall your distribution again. If you want it to last for a while and don't really care about having the lastest versions of every piece of sotfware, you should go with 12.04. While 12.10 has some awesome features like the new Nautilus or Gnome 3.6, it may be a little buggier (though it all depends on you computer). You can use Gnome with either of them, and it works very well, but in 12.04 you only get Gnome 3.4, though. Kernel-wise, they use 3.5, so there is not much difference between the distributions.\nIn my case, I was perfectly happy with 12.04, and only installed 12.10 to try Gnome Shell 3.6 and really like the new Nautilus.\nSo, in the end, I would suggest 12.10, but you will be happy with wichever you choose.\n", "Q: How to switch off graphics card?

Since I didn't find a real solution I decided to put the commands into a script and my plan ist to make this  script autostart once it works properly.\nThe commands are:\nnautilus -q\nnautilus -n &\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background show-desktop-icons false\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background show-desktop-icons true\n\nAnd this is my script:\n#!/bin/bash\nnautilus -q\npid0=$(pgrep 'nautilus')\nwhile [ -n \"$pid\" ];\ndo\n  pid=$(pgrep 'nautilus')\n  sleep 0\ndone\nnautilus -n\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background show-desktop-icons false\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background show-desktop-icons true\nexit 0\n\nI had to use the loop and testing since otherwise nautilus is restarted before it has finished to quit itself.\nBut my script never ends. While pgrep nautilus entered manually in a terminal doesn't return any value after nautilus -q, runing the script returns endless a pid so the script isn't executed.\nWhat is my mistake? Where does the pid come from when the command is run within the script?\nAnd how can I restart nautilus from within the script avoiding nautilus to block the script forever from further execution? The line nautilus -n starts nautilus and the script hangs from there on. Using nautilus -n & instetead makes the script run, but the follwing commands are executed before nautilus has completely started so they dont't work as intended, desktop settings are not applied.\nAre there any other ideas to cope with this annoying command-typing at every logon?\n\nA: There are several problems here. Let's walk through your script.\n\n\n*\n\n*You write pid0=$(pgrep 'nautilus'), but test the variable $pid (not $pid0) afterwards. I assume you meant to instead write\npid=$(pgrep 'nautilus')\n\n\n*If I understand correctly, the intention of your loop is to stall execution of the script until $pid is empty, i.e., until nautilus has stopped running. Indeed, the command nautilus -q will send a running Nautilus application the signal to quit, but the command nautilus -q itself will already have succesfully terminated before the running Nautilus application has processed that signal and successfully terminated itself also. Thus, your idea of using a loop in order to wait for the Nautilus application to terminate is valid. However, that loop does not run indefinitely as you say. Run your script with bash -x in order to see what happens. For example, this script:\n#!/bin/bash -x\nnautilus -q\npid=$(pgrep 'nautilus')\nwhile [ -n \"$pid\" ];\ndo\n  pid=$(pgrep 'nautilus')\n  sleep 0\ndone\necho \"Nautilus has stopped running!\"\n\n...when executed while a Nautilus application is running, gives me the following output:\n+ nautilus -q\n++ pgrep nautilus\n+ pid=24602\n+ '[' -n 24602 ']'\n++ pgrep nautilus\n+ pid=24602\n+ sleep 0\n+ '[' -n 24602 ']'\n++ pgrep nautilus\n+ pid=24602\n+ sleep 0\n+ '[' -n 24602 ']'\n++ pgrep nautilus\n+ pid=24602\n+ sleep 0\n+ '[' -n 24602 ']'\n++ pgrep nautilus\n+ pid=24602\n+ sleep 0\n+ '[' -n 24602 ']'\n++ pgrep nautilus\n+ pid=\n+ sleep 0\n+ '[' -n '' ']'\n+ echo 'Nautilus has stopped running!'\nNautilus has stopped running!\n\nAs you see, the loop does not run indefinitely. In your case, the loop is never even entered in the first place, because of problem (1). To answer your question Where does the pid come from when the command is run within the script? -- The pid comes from the running Nautilus application. The reason that you do not see a pid when running pgrep nautilus after nautilus -q from the Terminal is simple: You're not fast enough. The time you take to type pgrep nautilus after you have run nautilus -q is plenty, and when you finally run that command from the terminal, the Nautilus application has already terminated long ago; thus you do not see a pid. You can check this by typing nautilus -q; pgrep nautilus (as a single command) in the terminal while a Nautilus application is running: You have a good chance of seeing a pid then.\n\n*Cosmetic: There is no point in sleep 0, and having pid=$(pgrep 'nautilus') twice in your script is a bit redundant. Start like this:\n#!/bin/bash\nnautilus -q\nwhile [ -n \"$(pgrep nautilus)\" ]\ndo :\ndone\n\n\n*The reason that your script does not end is another than the loop: It is the command nautilus -n. Since this command does not terminate (by itself), your script just hangs. So you do have to run it in the background using nautilus -n &. As there is no easy way to determine from the script whether Nautilus has \"completely started\" such that desktop settings will apply (that I know of... save for some ugly boilerplate code that will try to set and read a dummy desktop setting in a loop in order to check that), the easiest thing is probably to just set an appropriate waiting time that will work for you in practice, say, sleep 2.\nSumming up, I expect the following to work for you:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nnautilus -q\nwhile [ -n \"$(pgrep nautilus)\" ]\ndo :\ndone\n\nnautilus -n &\nsleep 2\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background show-desktop-icons false\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background show-desktop-icons true\n\n", "Q: Transferring ratings and playlists from Rhythmbox to Clementine After the latest update, Rhythmbox (which was my main mp3 player on my Ubuntu Latest distro) stopped functioning: it dies just after startup.

It says only the older version is available, and it depends on the newer version. 4:4.8.1-0ubuntu4.4 is newer than 4:4.8.1-0ubuntu4.3.\nMost likely you are using a mirror that is slightly out of sync with the archive, and has only some of the packages synchronized over to it.

What is the optimal way to go about doing this in terminal?\nThe command rm *.gif removes all gif files including the file filename.gif.\n\nA: Here's the simple solution you should probably use:\nmv filename.gif filename.gif.keep\nrm *.gif\nmv filename.gif.keep filename.gif\n\nThere's nothing special about the .keep extension, this just makes it so that the filename temporarily doesn't end in .gif.\nIf you must not rename the file (and there are scripting situations where this is important):\nfor X in *.gif; do\n    if [ \"$X\" != \"filename.gif\" ]; then\n        rm \"$X\"\n    fi\ndone\n\nOr you can write it shorter like this:\nfor X in *.gif; do [ \"$X\" != \"filename.gif\" ] && rm \"$X\"; done\n\nYou may prefer to use find instead; it's very powerful, you might consider it more readable, and it better handles weird filenames with characters like * in them.\nfind . -maxdepth 1 -not -name 'filename.gif' -name '*.gif' -delete\n\nI've used the -not operator for readability, but if POSIX compliance is important--if you're not using GNU find, or if this is for a script you intend to redistribute to others or run on a variety of systems--you should use the ! operator instead:\nfind . -maxdepth 1 ! -name 'filename.gif' -name '*.gif' -delete\n\nOne handy thing about find is that you can easily modify the command for case-insensitivity, so that it finds and deletes files with extensions like .GIF too:\nfind . -maxdepth 1 -not -name 'filename.gif' -iname '*.gif' -delete\n\nPlease note that I've used -iname in place of -name for the search pattern *.gif but I have not used it for filename.gif. Presumably you know exactly what your file is called, and -iname will match alternate capitalization not just in the extension, but anywhere in the filename.\nAll these solutions only delete files residing immediately in the current directory. They don't delete files not contained in the current directory, and they don't delete files that reside in subdirectories of the current directory.\nIf you want to delete files everywhere contained within the current directory (that is, including in subdirectories, and in subdirectories of those subdirectories, and so forth--files contained within the current directory or any of its descendants), use find without maxdepth -1:\nfind . -not -name 'filename.gif' -name '*.gif' -delete\n\nBe careful with this!\nYou can also set other values with -maxdepth. For example, to delete files in the current directory and its children and grandchildren but not any deeper:\nfind . -maxdepth 3 -not -name 'filename.gif' -name '*.gif' -delete\n\nJust make sure you never put -delete first, before the other expressions! You'll see I've always put -delete at the end. If you put it at the beginning, it would be evaluated first, and all the files under . (including files not ending in .gif and files in deep sub-sub-sub...directories of .) would be deleted!\nFor more information, see the manual pages for bash and sh and for the commands used in these examples: mv, rm, [, and (especially) find.\n\nA: If you're using bash (the default shell), the extglob shell option allows you to use an extended pattern matching syntax.  To enable it, use the shopt builtin command:\nshopt -s extglob\n\n(I include that line in my .bashrc file.)\nAmong other things, it grants access to the !() operator, which matches any pattern not inside the parens.  For your purpose:\nrm !(filename).gif\n\nMore information is available in man bash under \"Pattern Matching\".\n\nA: Open a Terminal with Ctrl + Alt + T and type:\nfind . -type f -name \"*.gif\" -and -not -name \"filename.gif\" -exec rm -vf {} \\;\n\nThe difference between -delete and -exec rm -vf {} \\; is that with the second option, you will be able to see which files have been removed, because of the -v flag. That's something that can't be done with the -delete option. (-name -delete will print the filenames, but rm with -v reveals if each file was successfully deleted.)\n\nA: There's the GLOBIGNORE variable. From man bash:\nGLOBIGNORE\n      A colon-separated list of patterns defining the set of filenames\n      to be ignored by pathname expansion.  If a filename matched by a\n      pathname expansion pattern also matches one of the  patterns  in\n      GLOBIGNORE, it is removed from the list of matches.\n\nSo, a simple way is to just set GLOBGINORE to the filename in question:\n$ touch {a,b,c,d}.png\n$ echo *.png\na.png b.png c.png d.png\n$ GLOBIGNORE=c.png\n$ echo *.png\na.png b.png d.png\n\nSo, in your case:\nGLOBIGNORE=filename.gif; rm *.gif\n\nOf course, since GLOBIGNORE contains patterns, you can use it whenever you want to exclude a pattern:\n$ GLOBIGNORE='[a-c].png'; echo *.png\nd.png\n$ touch bd.png; GLOBIGNORE='?.png'; echo *.png\nbd.png\n\n\nAn advantage (?!) of GLOBIGNORE is that setting it automatically excludes . and .. from being matched, and it enables dotglob:\nThe  GLOBIGNORE shell variable may be used to restrict the set of file‐\nnames matching a pattern.  If GLOBIGNORE is set, each matching filename\nthat also matches one of the patterns in GLOBIGNORE is removed from the\nlist of matches.  The filenames ``.''  and ``..''  are  always  ignored\nwhen  GLOBIGNORE is set and not null.  However, setting GLOBIGNORE to a\nnon-null value has the effect of enabling the dotglob shell option,  so\nall other filenames beginning with a ``.''  will match.  To get the old\nbehavior of ignoring filenames beginning with a ``.'', make ``.*''  one\nof  the  patterns  in  GLOBIGNORE.  The dotglob option is disabled when\nGLOBIGNORE is unset.\n\nSo, a simple way of deleting all files and folders in a directory:\nGLOBIGNORE=.; rm -r *\n\nThe * will match filenames beginning with ., since GLOBIGNORE enabled dotglob, but it won't match . or .., so you won't affect the parent directory that way.\n", "Q: Where can I find reliable review of Ubuntu's performance on a laptop (Lenovo z580) Sorry to ask a hardware related question.\nHope it's relevant enough to Ubuntu users in general not to get instantly down-voted and marked as a replica as a related hardware question did.

(Subtle difference: I'm asking where do I find information, not what is the information).\nI know the main ports of call:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu hardware support (Lenovo doesn't even seem to be listed)\n\n*Ubuntu certified (lists v580 as being compatible: good sign, but not enough to overcome concerns about uefi)\n\n*Google (a load of scare stories about UEFI problems, which I suspect are the minority, but struggling to find a similarly large stash of \"it works fine\" stories.\n\n\nThese are general problems, so please think about the best generic steps that you would take when looking into a new lappy. And people less experienced with Ubuntu compatible hardware purchases (I've bought a few and it's still really hard - imagine what it's like for someone completely new to the wonderful world of Linux and computer hardware).\nThanks.\n\nA: I got a Z580 just recently. Here's what I can say about it.\nIt came with Windows 8 pre-installed. It survived on the laptop circa 24 hours after which I started installing Ubuntu.\nFirst I set out to install Ubuntu 12.10.\nBecause I was aware of the whole UEFI/SecureBoot complications, first I Googled around to find out how to disable it. What I've learned is that you need to go into the setup (BIOS ? Is it still called BIOS?). You do this by turning the machine off and starting it with the small button right beside the power button. \nOnce inside the BIOS, go to security settings. Now here's a tricky part. I went there only to find out that the settings to disable SecureBoot were all greyed out, and of course it was set to Enabled. After more googling I discovered that you can only turn it off if you set a security password first! So that's what I did and I managed turn SecureBoot off.\nAlso you have to enable legacy boot mode, but set it so that the system tries UEFI first, then Legacy mode.\nAfter all this you can proceed installing Ubuntu as normal. If you want to install Ubuntu the UEFI way, remember that you will need a special partition for storing the boot loader. Because I like to lay out my partitions manually, I created a small 300MB EFI partition, one for swap, one for /, and one for /home. Ubuntu will recognize the EFI partition and use it for boot. The rest of the partitions are up to your liking. Remember that the partition table type must be GPT and not MBR for UEFI to work.\nMy experience with how Ubuntu runs on it is quite good. Almost everything works out-of-the-box, even the webcam. Except for the wifi which uses a Broadcom chip. But it can be made to work quite easily. Install the Additional Drivers utility and turn the proprietary driver on.\nSince then I upgraded to Ubuntu 13.04 alpha. Everything works the same way, except that the webcam although recognized only shows a black or white image. So no video-chatting.\n\nA: Linux on Laptops is generally a good resource about configuration of specific distros on particular pieces of hardware. Unfortunately, as of today there are no reports on the Lenovo z580.\nI'm sorry this is not really answering your question.\n", "Q: Is the Ubuntu logo an African symbol?

For instance, for 8.4 and 9.1:\n/etc/postgresql/8.4/main/pg_hba.conf\n/etc/postgresql/9.1/main/pg_hba.conf\n\nI have tried the pg_config command, but it does not seem to include this information.\nThis is so that I can use a uniform command for opening pg_hba.conf and other PostgreSQL configuration files for editing.\nI'm using bash.\n\nA: I am using the following for config files detection:\n$(ls /etc/postgresql/*/main/pg_hba.conf)\n$(ls /etc/postgresql/*/main/postgresql.conf)\n\n\nA: This is how I do it:\njohn@host:~$ ls /etc/postgresql\n9.1\njohn@host:~$ sudo vim /etc/postgresql/9.1/main/pg_hba.conf\n\nSince the path is like this: /etc/postgresql/[VERSION]/main/pg_hba.conf\n\nA: Editing the correct pg_hba.conf with your default visual editor (vim, emacs, nano, joe, etc.) is as easy as:\n$VISUAL /etc/postgresql/$(ls /etc/postgresql)/main/pg_hba.conf\n\n\nA: Simply ask from PostgreSQL.\nPrint pg_hba.conf file location:\nsu - postgres -c \"psql -t -P format=unaligned -c 'show hba_file';\"\n\nPrint postgresql.conf file location:\nsu - postgres -c \"psql -t -P format=unaligned -c 'SHOW config_file';\"\n\n\nA: To find the path to pg_hba.conf, use the command:\nsudo -u postgres psql -t -P format=unaligned -c 'show hba_file';\n\n\nA: pg_config is for compliation information, to help extensions and client programs compile and link against PostgreSQL. It knows nothing about the active PostgreSQL instance(s) on the machine, only the binaries.\npg_hba.conf can appear in many other places depending on how Pg was installed. The standard location is pg_hba.conf within the data_directory of the database (which could be in /home, /var/lib/pgsql, /var/lib/postgresql/[version]/, /opt/postgres/, etc etc etc) but users and packagers can put it wherever they like. Unfortunately.\nThe only valid ways find pg_hba.conf is to ask a running PostgreSQL instance where it's pg_hba.conf is, or ask the sysadmin where it is. You can't even rely on asking where the datadir is and parsing postgresql.conf because an init script might passed a param like -c hba_file=/some/other/path when starting Pg.\nWhat you want to do is ask PostgreSQL:\nSHOW hba_file;\n\nThis command must be run on a superuser session, so for shell scripting you might write something like:\npsql -t -P format=unaligned -c 'show hba_file';\n\nand set the environment variables PGUSER, PGDATABASE, etc to ensure that the connection is right.\nYes, this is somewhat of a chicken-and-egg problem, in that if the user can't connect (say, after screwing up editing pg_hba.conf) you can't find pg_hba.conf in order to fix it.\nAnother option is to look at the ps command's output and see if the postmaster data directory argument -D is visible there, e.g.\nps aux  | grep 'postgres *-D'\n\nsince pg_hba.conf will be inside the data directory (unless you're on Debian/Ubuntu or some derivative and using their packages).\nIf you're targeting specifically Ubuntu systems with PostgreSQL installed from Debian/Ubuntu packages it gets a little easier. You don't have to deal with hand-compiled-from-source Pg that someone's initdb'd a datadir for in their home dir, or an EnterpriseDB Pg install in /opt, etc. You can ask pg_wrapper, the Debian/Ubuntu multi-version Pg manager, where PostgreSQL is using the pg_lsclusters command from pg_wrapper.\nIf you can't connect (Pg isn't running, or you need to edit pg_hba.conf to connect) you'll have to search the system for pg_hba.conf files. On Mac and Linux something like sudo find / -type f -name pg_hba.conf will do. Then check the PG_VERSION file in the same directory to make sure it's the right PostgreSQL version if you have more than one. (If pg_hba.conf is in /etc/, ignore this, it's the parent directory name instead). If you have more than one data directory for the same PostgreSQL version you'll have to look at database size, check the command line of the running postgres from ps to see if it's data directory -D argument matches where you're editing, etc.\n\nA: Using command-line, ask your database:\n$ psql -U postgres\npostgres=# SHOW config_file;\n\n\n*\n\n*Copied from Stackoverflow - https://stackoverflow.com/a/3603162/5677857\n\nA: To know where the file is\nsimply type:\npg_lsclusters\n\n", "Q: Thinkpad 13 Edge microphone noise problem I'm having problems with the microphone making a annoying noise that makes talking really hard.\nMy laptop is a ThinkPad Edge 13 (the version with an intel processor)\nI reported a bug [1] and I got the following response:\n\nunsolicited event should not be enabled on internal Mic which does not support Jack detection Misc = NO_PRESENCE\n\nI reported the following log [2]\nThe problem appears in both 12.04 and 12.10.\nI want to know how to fix it.

I downloaded the Desktop Ubuntu 12.10 ISO for Windows, and used the Pen Drive Linux USB Installer to install Ubuntu on my external hard drive. When I rebooted my PC, nothing extraordinary happened. Then I went and changed my boot device order. There was two different entries including \"USB\", so I just moved one of them to the top, and when I chose save and exit, Windows just started normally again. \nThen I went and tried moving the other entry including \"USB\" to the top, and moved the first one back. This resulted in a black screen with a line of text. The text said something including Syslinux, a copyright symbol, a name (Peter H. Avin or something) and two letters. Nothing else happened after waiting several minutes. I tried pressing several buttons on my keyboard, and at some point, every button started saying a \"blunk!\" noise. Waiting another fifteen minutes didn't do anything either, so I forced my PC to shut down.\nI tried starting up the computer again, and it said that there may be a problem with the computer, maybe caused by recent hardware changes. It gave me 2 options, to start repairing the computer, or to start Windows normally. I started Windows normally, as I knew that this didn't need repair. When I tried going back to change the boot device order, and saw nothing had changed since last time, I just pressed \"Save and exit\", and got the black screen with the copyright line again.\nI can't figure out what I'm doing wrong here to be completely honest. I installed Ubuntu on the right drive, and I've tried moving both of the entries including \"USB\" to the top in the boot device order, and neither of em helped me much. So what I'm \ntrying to say is, I think I need help. What am I doing wrong?\n\nA: I'm not sure about your problem. When you go to the boot menu, go where you said you changed the boot device order, but leave as it was before you changed anything. Under those options, their might be something else about boot system, go into that and change that into your USB boot. Hope this helps. Depends on your boot menu I think.\n\nA: SYSLINUX ran, so you were able to boot to the correct device. (SYSLINUX is the boot loader that resides in the ISO image--and thus on your USB flash drive.)\nBut SYSLINUX did not succeed; it just froze.\nThe most likely cause of this problem is that the ISO file:\n\n\n*\n\n*downloaded wrong, or\n\n*was not written enitrely successfully, to the USB flash drive\n\n\nTo see if the ISO downloaded correctly, check its MD5SUM.\nIf the MD5SUM is wrong, download the ISO again (and MD5 test the newly downloaded copy, too).\nIf the MD5SUM is correct, make sure you're writing it correctly to the USB flash drive. There is a procedure for testing the integrity of the data written to the USB flash drive, but unfortunately you won't be able to use it in this situation unless you have another computer, since your computer doesn't get far enough in the boot process to access the boot menu and choose to run that test.\nYou used the Universal USB Installer to write the ISO to the USB flash drive. If you can't get that to produce a working flash drive, try UNetbootin instead. (Similarly, people who try UNetbootin and have trouble with it can try Universal USB Installer to see if that works better.)\nIf it still doesn't work, try formatting the USB flash drive in Windows (right-click on it and click Format...). Use FAT32. Then try UNetbootin again.\nIf it still doesn't work, please edit your question to provide details about everything you did and what happened. In particular, please describe exactly how you wrote the ISO image to the USB flash drive.\nFinally, you may want to test your RAM. Ordinarily you could do this from the boot menu on the USB flash drive, but you can't get far enough that this works. So, use the instructions on the official memtest86+ website. Attempting to test your memory in this way is helpful for two reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*If this doesn't work either, it suggests there may be a hardware problem (or systematic errors in the way you're creating boot media).\n\n*Assuming you are able to do it, it may reveal a defect in your RAM. Or it may not find one (suggesting that a defect is unlikely). RAM can go bad; it's worth testing under these circumstances.\n\n", "Q: Install Ubuntu 12.10 instead of Windows 8 I have a laptop (4 GB RAM, 500 GB HDD, Intel core i3 2.4 GHz) with 2 Partitions: one For data and one for windows 8 x64.\nActually, I want to install Ubuntu 12.10 instead of Windows 8 but keeping Data partition. \nSo, my question is: There is no matter to use ubuntu with NTFS Windows Partition.

I checked the partition table using fdisk. I figured that there are more then 1 partition (one for example DELLUTILITY). I assumed that simply remounting using the line #mount -n -o remount,rw / might mount the wrong partition. So I tried #mount -n -o remount,rw /dev/sda3 / instead and that worked just fine.

Can you be more specific?  When you say something \"doesn't work\", did you get an error message?  Did the command run, but your problem still isn't fixed?  If so, was there any feedback?  Alternatively, did you input the command and quite literally it \"does nothing\" - your computer did nothing at all?\nOne of the things I did was to uninstall ccsm.  I don't like it; those warnings it gives you about how you can really mess up your install if you fool with the setting?

It's going to be easier to diagnose the problem knowing that information.\n\nA: I'm on 12.04 and didn't realize the unity --reset was deprecated in 12.10.  There is a solution posted here:\nHow do I reset my Unity configuration?\n...but I haven't tried it personally because I don't use 12.10.\nFor the XAuthority issue you should probably look up a solution separately, and if you don't find a fix create a separate question.  There is info on the boards on how to recreate your xauthority script and make sure the environment variable is set properly.  When I had a similar problem, I had somehow removed read/write access to the necessary files and first had to restore that.  So you might want to check first and make sure Xauthority is really missing and not just \"missing\" for you as user...\n\nA: To debug your problem, you can try those steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*First of all you should test if your computer can run Unity:\n/usr/lib/nux/unity_support_test -p\n\nif you get any \"no\" that could be the cause of your problem.\n\n*Try creating another account and login to Unity in it. In tty1 execute\ngnome-control-center\n\nthen select \"User accounts\", create a new user, activate it and login with it. If Unity starts then the problem is your configuration. If you get the same then there's really some problem with Unity\n\n*After you login, switch to tty1 and execute\nunity --replace\n\nswitch to tty7 (Ctrl+Alt+F7) and see if anything changes. Also check for errors in tty1. If the output in tty1 is too long you can redirect the output to a file using\nunity --replace > ~/unity.log 2>&1\n\nand then open unity.log in your home folder and search for errors there.\n\nA: I had pretty much the same problem under 12.04.

You'll need to do this in Windows, with the FSCK utility or a GUI front-end to it, since there's no suitable utility in Linux. Once you've done this, be sure to shut down cleanly, since if you just hit the power button, the disk won't be properly unmounted and you're likely to run into the same problem again.\nOne more point: Windows 8 uses a \"fast start-up\" feature by default, but this is essentially a suspend-to-disk rather than a shut-down. You must disable this feature when dual-booting, or risk filesystem damage.

When I try to watch a YouTube video or something like that, it just says, \"Couldn't load plug-in\".\n\nA: You need to update Chrome to version 24.0.1312.69 or later. This is a known issue which has been fixed in the said version. Run the following command in terminal: \nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\n\n\nSource: Google Chrome Forum Post\n\nA: Try the Adobe Flash plugin, using the flashplugin-installer to get the Mozilla style NPAPI version (from the \"nonfree\" section of the Ubuntu repositories). It's frozen at version 11.2 but still has security updates and works fine with most sites. Plug chrome://plugins into the address bar and disable the libpepflashplayer.\nThen try switching back to the Pepper Flash sometime to see if it works again.\nEdit: My guess was that not all websites were compatible with the newest Flash, but it looks like it was just a bug (see other answer about upgrading Chrome). There were other issues with Pepper when it came to full screening video in a previous release, so it's not a bad idea to have both plugins handy for when you upgrade and everything breaks.\n", "Q: How to access more storage from Ubuntu USB I downloaded Ubuntu USB onto my USB drive and ran it as my operating system, but when I try to download something to Ubuntu it says I do not have enough disk space.\n\nA: The Desktop or \"Live\" runs on a read only file system and has limited space. You can not save your settings between booting and you will have limited space for saving your work.\nYou can, however, save data to your hard drive or a second flash drive.\nYou can also condifure your usb drive. You can add a second partition or boot the live CD with persistance.\nDepending on what you are wanting and the size of your flash drive, perhaps you can simply install Ubuntu onto the usb drive.\n", "Q: Windows button on keyboard When I had windows my windows button worked like if you was in a game and needed to read somting or something else not in game you could press the windows button, and you did not close the whole game, in ubuntu when you take a screenshot or press the windows button, I can't get in game again. I have to restart the game, is there anny possibilty to change it, so it works just the same as in windows?\nI like ubuntu, wont change.\n\nA: Well there is no effective solution to this problem. It happens because the graphics back-end of Linux--the X window system--is very old software and was not built with this capability. It seems that a new graphics back-end is being developed, but until so, people have resigned to using workarounds.\nThe workaround\nYou can run the game in an X window other than the desktop's, and change between one and the other with the X window hotkeys, that go from ControlAltF1..F9 (or so it seems).\nTo open a new X window, you can follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press ControlAltF1\n\n*Run xinit -- :1. This will open a new X window in display :1 (your desktop is currently addressed with display :0). You will be now taken to a black screen, with a small white terminal.\n\n*Now run ck-launch-session, this will enable audio.\n\n*Optionally you can use the setxkbmap program to use your keyboard settings in the new window, but you'll have to look into that yourself. I use setxkbmap -layout \"us\" -variant \"altgr-intel\", but that's me.\n\n*Now run your game through the terminal.\n\n\n*\n\n*You can return to your desktop pressing ControlAltF7\n\n*You can return to your game pressing ControlAltF8\n", "Q: Where can I find the Update Manager in Ubuntu 12.10?

To launch it, open the Dash Menu and search for \"Software Updater\".\n", "Q: df shows all space taken, but du doesn't add up I'm having a problem with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. This is the second time I've encountered this problem in the last 3 weeks. \nThe first time is described in this closed question on StackOverflow.\nThe TL;DR version is I managed to use all the inodes on a 450G ext4 system compiling and building the Android stack less than 20 times.\nI thought I was solving the problem by reformatting the disk as XFS so the inode storage could grow. \nThis morning after doing a build overnight, I'm down to less than 1GB of free space.  There is nothing on this machine other than what is needed to build Android.  I've done 5 total builds on the platform sources.  The build creates a bunch of files, then I delete them shortly after with make clean.  I'm not really less than 1GB but the tools are reporting it that way. I deleted a bunch of temporary files and had about 40GB \"freed\".  A couple hours later, just idling, I was back to less than 1GB free.\nRunning Ubuntu from a flash drive returns the following for the partition...\n$ df\nFilesystem     1K-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on\n/dev/sda5      468521456 468255460    265996 100% /media/f71c77eb-b4cc-\n\n$ df -i\nFilesystem      Inodes  IUsed   IFree IUse% Mounted on\n/dev/sda5      1691760 624214 1067546   37% /media/f71c77eb-b4cc-\n\n$ df -h\nFilesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n/dev/sda5       447G  447G  260M 100% /media/f71c77eb-b4cc-\n\nHere's is the evidence that something is amiss. When I run du (with and without --apparent-size) or the visual Disk Usage Analyzer, I show that I'm really only using about \n35GB or so.  98.7% of the used space is in /home/eric, but du doesn't add up to that. The discrepancy is between /home/eric and /home/eric/android \n\nI've read through the relevant questions here and on SO and they usually suggest it's deleted files held by open processes.  I rebooted into a flash drive to run this test, so it shouldn't be open files.  FWIW, /tmp is empty.\nIs there a tool I can install on a flash drive to recover the 'lost' space?  I can try to free up memory on the system and run it there, but I'm assuming it's better to do this from a flash drive.\nShould I be configuring this system in a different way?  I would rather not do another wipe and install, but I need a sustainable Android build system.\nFOLLOWUP - I had to nuke the installation last week and re-installed 12.04 in order to get work done. As I go through Android builds again this week, I will keep a watchful eye over the disk usage and give information here as I learn more.\nThanks\n\nA: I recently ran into this, and in my case a fsck needed to be run.\nI did touch /forcefsck && reboot and after a few minutes, the server was back online and suddenly my missing 6 GB freed up.\n\nA: On Oracle Linux it happens when you have (a lot of/large) files which are deleted but still open by a running process. Then stop of the processes or reboot of the machine helps.\n\nA: Before you go to far.....take the system down to single user mode and do a FULL fsck (I really mean full fsck -f /dev/sda5) of the filesystem and see what it shows.  You might find the space as portions of problem areas on your disk or mismatch between what is allocated and what is present on the disk.\n\nA: We can do a test, du says you have 10GB free space, while df says 300 MB, can you write a file (or several files) with size of, say, 2 GB?\nIf you can, that means that df is just simply wrong (and there is actually no problem of 'lost space'). If not, then du is wrong (which will be interesting).\n\nA: I have not found the cause of this problem, but it is unique to ubuntu 12.04.  \nJust setting up a new server, I started with Ubuntu 12.04 and ran into this; du showed about 111 GiB usage, while df was around 170 GiB.\nBooting using systemrescuecd 3.3.0 and checking again showed a difference of less than 1 GiB.\nLeaving the partition and file system (it is ext4) unchanged, I moved the ubuntu directories out of the way and installed Debian 7.0.  Again, the difference between du and df was < 1 GiB.\nWith ubuntu 10.04, on the same partition and ext4 fs:\nFrom df -m /, \nFilesystem           1M-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on\n/dev/sda2              2814679    407164   2264538  16% /\n\nand from du -mx,\ntail -1 /root/diskuse \n406920  .\n\nwhich is close enough.\n\nA: This is frequently caused by files within a directory, which also has a different filesystem mounted on it.  A typical fix is to boot with a rescue disk, or in single user mode, and empty the directories, having verified that they are not being used as mount points (cat /proc/mounts or df -h).\n\nA: The image you posted is telling you where the space is being used: /home/eric.  It seems you have a very large file in there hogging all the space, or possibly a large number of smaller files.  Open your home directory, make sure to show hidden files (Ctrl+H in Nautilus ), and sort by file size.\n\nA: Files in trash usually clog up the disk.  It is easy to see them using \"Disk usage analyser\".  The files can be deleted by searching for \"Trash\".  There is the option to delete the contents of the \"Trash\". There is also the option to delete \"temp\" files.  One can also set option to automatically delete \"Trash\" at intervals.\n", "Q: problem installing tor on ubuntu 12.10 I'm trying to install Tor on ubuntu 12.10, I followed the instruction on upubuntu,  but when I paste sudo apt-get install tor-browser (the third line) in my terminal, this is what I see:\nLettura elenco dei pacchetti...

So, I hit the Ubuntu install again, it asked me to erase previous Ubuntu, I said yes, now the Ubuntu 12.10 works perfectly.  \nI used boot-repair to repair the GRUB as suggested in some answers here, and when I reboot, there was no option for windows 8.

Win8 came pre-installed.\nEdit: \nFor the ones who are looking for such solutions, there is NO WAY to get it back, at-least in my kind of situation. I again installed the windows from DVD (I got it from Dell Customer Center, and while purchasing this Laptop I had one month of premium support, which made things easier). \nI installed windows8 with DVD and not selecting UEFI and I used G-Parted from LiveUSB to create partitions, Hence, installed Ubuntu 12.10 in other partition via LiveUSB.\n\nA: I do not think you deleted your Windows partition.  However I predict you don't have your GRUB menu set up correctly.  First to verify that you havn't deleted your Windows partition type:\nsudo fdisk -l\nlook for one that has NTFS as the file system type this is most likely your windows partition:\nDevice Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/hdb1   *           1        2432    19535008+  86  NTFS\n/dev/hdb2            2433        2554      979965   82  Linux swap / Solaris\n/dev/hdb3            2555        6202    29302560   83  Linux\n\nIn this example it is /dev/hdb1\nOnce you verify that it is still existent(hopefully it is) you will need add it to your grub menu.  I recommend you check out this link:\nhttp://technologytales.com/2010/11/21/manually-adding-an-entry-for-windows-7-to-an-ubuntu-grub2-menu/\nBecause it varies slightly depending your windows partition name also check out the first entry in this:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1817827\nIf in fact you did delete your windows partition I recommend you call and get another CD from the manufacturer.

No offence if you knew these things already. But if not, then I cannot let you not knowing those tips. The comments section is too small for this explanation.\nInstalling a program\nI have the impression that you downloaded the packages from http://packages.ubuntu.com and then installed them. Is that correct ? If yes, you have to know that downloading something from the web to install it is very common for Windows but very rare for Ubuntu.\nUsually, you should use the Software Center or a command in the terminal containing \"apt-get\".\nUbuntu versions names\nThe version number is for instance 10.04, 12.04 or 12.10. The first part indicates the year and the second indicates the month of release. For instance 12.04 came out in April 2012.\n\"LTS\" means Long Term Support. There is an LTS version of Ubuntu every 2 years : 10.04 and 12.04 are the latest ones.\n64bits and 32bits are related to your processor.\n\nHave fun with Ubuntu and your video games !

When Ubuntu boots the wireless assistant button on the keyboard is not lit and I can't find any combination of keys or command to get it to light, I assume because the installed driver is wrong. So in short Ubuntu help - Wireless trouble shooting has used up the better part of 3 days but still not produced the desired outcome. Any ideas? I'm sure that if I could find out where that driver is being associated with the device I could make ndiswrapper work instead.\n\nA: Ndiswrapper is the least desirable option, in my opinion.

When creating the VM, try choosing \"I will install the operating system later\", and before you boot the VM, set the virtual CD to point to your ISO or CD/DVD.\nI don't know how the built-in installer works since I've never used it, but I think it lets you enter the details and then it automatically installs the OS.

However, to do that I must use super grub disk. I have a dual boot system, so I thought it would be inadvisable to install grub directly to /dev/sda, and thus installed it to /dev/sda6 (I have a shared partition in between Mac and Ubuntu to transfer files). I am using rEFIt, and whenever I try to boot into Ubuntu from rEFIt it drops me to the grub rescue prompt. I know that my grub.cfg is fine, because I can use it from super grub. Also, before it drops me to the grub rescue prompt, it tells me that it can't find the partition (I don't know which one). I have synced my partition tables using rEFIt, and updated grub with update-grub, but to no avail. Does anyone have any ideas for what could be wrong and how I could fix it?\n\nA: I recommend you try an EFI-mode boot of Ubuntu rather than the BIOS-mode boot you're trying now. You can find instructions on how to do the conversion in the \"Fixing the Installation\" section of my EFI-Booting Ubuntu on a Mac Web page. That page assumes use of rEFInd, which is my updated fork of rEFIt, but the procedure will work with rEFIt, too, provided you're willing to boot through GRUB. If you stick with rEFIt, you can skip steps 8-11. If you also have Windows installed, you must skip steps 1-7.\nOne caveat: Although booting Macs to Linux in EFI mode works fine on most systems, it does pose problems on some systems, typically because of hardware that fails to initialize properly. Therefore, if you have problems, you may need to restore the BIOS-boot configuration by reversing the procedure.\n", "Q: Why Ubuntu ask me for for root password while upgrading?

I have tried some advices from this site, such as sudo passwd -dl root, but the computer replies that the administrator is not in the sudoers file after entering the administrators password. \nWhat can I do to remove or get around the root password?\n\nA: *\n\n*Reboot the computer and stay in the grub menu.\n\n*Select the default entry and press \"e\".\n\n*Add to the kernel line at the end \" single\" (if it doesn't work try with 1).\n\n*Press \"b\" to boot with the modified parameters.

Right now ive increased the size of c: drive so there is no unallocated space anymore. And as a side note I have tried this with ubuntu 12.10, still no recognition of win 7. My hard drive setup in the disk mng in win 7 is just c: drive and system reserved. Oh and fyi my tech level is average so im not that great at this stuff. And sorry if this has been asked before, But i never saw anything. Thanks!!\n\nA: First of all, I recommend using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (The LTS stands for Long Term Support), as you appear to be new to Ubuntu, and 12.04 LTS is the most stable version.\nWhat I think you need to do is put in the Windows disk, and create three partitions, one for Windows, one for Ubuntu, and one small 4gb one called a \"swap space\". Install Windows on one of them (not the swap space), and when that's done, put in your Ubuntu disk, and install Ubuntu on the partition that you haven't yet used.\nInstalling Ubuntu last should ensure that GRUB sees Windows as it's going in, so it will add it to the boot menu.\nIf you have any more questions, just ask.\n\nA: \"Unmounting\" a partition is non-destructive -- that term means that the partition is being made inaccessible to the currently-booted computer, but the partition won't be deleted or damaged in any way. Thus, if you're using the term correctly, you shouldn't be concerned about unmounting a partition.\nThat said, if you're using the term correctly, it's puzzling, since the Ubuntu installer does not, AFAIK, mount the Windows partition, much less unmount it, and it only unmounts the partition(s) it creates at the end of the installation process. Thus, I'm not sure what might be generating that message. I recommend you try again and report what happens with more precision. Describe everything you do in the step or two up to the message and take a screen shot, if necessary, so that you can report the exact wording of the message.\n", "Q: VMware wants /dev/dsp, but it does not exist Running an MS-DOS virtual machine within VMware Workstation 9.01 requires the \"virtual sound card\" to be set to SB16.

All sound works fine in Ubuntu, and other virtual machines in Workstation 9 have fully functional sound.\nUbuntu 12.04, kernel is 3.2.0-37, platform is x64-SMP, oss-compat is already installed.

Already tried setting the virtual sound card to Auto Detect and Alsa-Compatible Sound Card (these are the only two choices).  Result is the same.\nFrom what I have been able to find so far, no one else is reporting this particular problem.  Suggestions for missing /dev/dsp have always involved pointing to a different device or installing oss-compat and/or alsa-oss.  Neither of these fixes the problem.\n\nA: I seem to have had the same problem running a win 3.11 guest on a Gentoo host. Turned out modules for OSS was built and installed, but not loaded at boot. A simple sudo modprobe snd-pcm-oss made /dev/dsp accessible for vmware workstation 9.\n\nA: It might be due to a bug/issue with Ubuntu 12.04. \nIf I read and understand the following post it has to do with missing modules and a workaround that will only work with higher versions of Ubuntu.\nThe post I refer to is this one: oss-compat package does not create /dev/dsp \nThis will not solve your problem but give you an explanation why it is not working.\n\nA: The device was present, but was only accessible by root or group audio (660).

On the second tab, the one that says Other Software find the PPA for Jupiter and remove that (Both, the source repository and the actual compiled repository for Jupiter).\n\nThen open a terminal, update your repositories again like:\nsudo apt-get update.\nThen proceed to add the Jupiter PPA shown in https://launchpad.net/~webupd8team/+archive/jupiter\nIt should look like this when on the terminal:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/jupiter \nThen do sudo apt-get update to update the repositories again.\nFor the heat problem I would suggest:\n\n\n*\n\n*Clean the laptop a bit (Just in case there is dust or something clogging the air flow)\n\n*Use the laptop in a position that makes sure it has enough space underneath it.\n\n*Anything that actually contributes to better air flow.\n\n\nAfter you have solved the Jupiter problem (If you can not find it, just re-add the PPA using add-apt-repository it will take care of checking for anything missing. Maybe it had a problem when adding it the first time.\nFor the cooling part I also recommend using powertop. Install it by:\nsudo apt-get install powertop\nThen run the app like sudo powertop and go to the last TAB that has a column (The first column actually) that says BAD or GOOD. Go to all the ones that say BAD and start pressing SPACE to improve/fix them so they help in generating less heat and less power usage.\nLast I want to point you to this question: How to control fan speed?\nIt has solved many users problems related to Fan speed: How to control fan speed?\nAlthough again I would recommend checking into why the temperature is so high since the fan speed is higher, the higher the temperature of the CPU/GPU. So first check in Windows or physically the laptop for clean air circulation. Then proceed with the question.\nHYBRID PROBLEMS\nSince you have a Hybrid Laptop (It means it has 2 video cards, an Intel one and an Ati one) I did some research and found some links that might help or give you an idea of where to go:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=5275392\n(Research about DELL Laptops and Fan problems)\nIs Dell Inspiron 15R Special Edition compatible with Ubuntu? (Information about this particular model)\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=842775\n(A solution that might work with the Fan issues)\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2095880\n(Question about the same issue)\nHow do I get AMD/Intel Hybrid Graphics drivers to work?\n(Fix for graphic problems. See NOTE1 for some additional information at the bottom.)\nDell Inspiron 15R [Special Edition] fan speed problem\n(Link about checking BIOS for an option to remove one of the 2 video cards)\nFrom all of this, the only one that actually went to where I was thinking was one that mentioned installing some Fan controlling  packages (The i8k). I believe this could be a solution since it involves checking the sensors (Which also made me suggest to install lm-sensors). So here is a small guide to try it out:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install i8kutils\n\n*sudo gedit /etc/modules \n\n*Add in a new line i8k and save the file. It should look similar to this (Look at last line):\n\n\n*sudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/options\n\n*Add in a new line options i8k force=1 and save the file. It should look like this:\n\n\n*Reboot the computer. Type sudo reboot if you want.\n\n*sudo gedit /etc/i8kmon\n\n*Paste in the file the following information and save it:\n(Copy the data and paste that in the file)\n# Run as daemon, override with --daemon option\nset config(daemon)      0\n\n# Automatic fan control, override with --auto option\nset config(auto)        1\n\n# Report status on stdout, override with --verbose option\nset config(verbose) 1\n\n# Status check timeout (seconds), override with --timeout option\nset config(timeout) 1\n\n# Temperature thresholds: {fan_speeds low_ac high_ac low_batt high_batt}\nset config(0)   {{-1 0}  -1  55  -1  55}\nset config(1)   {{-1 1}  55  70  55  70}\nset config(3)   {{-1 2}  70  128  70  128}\n\n# For computer with 2 fans, use a variant of this instead:\n# Temperature thresholds: {fan_speeds low_ac high_ac low_batt high_batt}\n# set config(0) {{-1 0}  -1  52  -1  65}\n# set config(1) {{-1 1}  41  66  55  75}\n# set config(2) {{-1 1}  55  80  65  85}\n# set config(3) {{-1 2}  70 128  75 128}\n\n# end of file\n\nNow reboot. Although before doing that, install lmsensors and make it detect every sensor you have:\nsudo apt-get install lm-sensors \nsudo sensors-detect \nWait for it to finish. Every time it asks for something press ENTER. After it finished asking about the summary it will tell you if you want to automatically create a file to cover all that was checked so it loads every time you boot the laptop, type Yes and press ENTER. Now reboot.\nIf the module does not load by any chance, simply type: sudo modprobe i8k force=1\nIf you want to monitor the Sensors, you could install the indicator-sensor which I found with the following PPA (I am pretty sure it was in the repositories in 11.10):\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:alexmurray/indicator-sensors\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get install indicator-sensors\nNow reboot and run the indicator sensor from Dash (Should appear in the panel).\nNOTE1 - If you do the link above related to fixing the video, please download the packages from this link https://launchpad.net/~andrikos/+archive/ppa/+sourcepub/2909374/+listing-archive-extra the cover some fixes for Ati/Intel Hybrids.\n\nA: I had this problem too, back in January when I bought my Dell XPS.\nHappily, after I installed Bumblebee and updated to the most recent Kernel version available, this problem has been fixed.\nNow it works like a charm.\n", "Q: \"declaration is incompatible with \"int getnameinfo(...\" while installing Trimaran I'm having the same issue as posted here, but in my case, using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS Live USB, inside ~/trimaran/openimpact folder.\nI try to execute ./install_openimpact, then the shell replies me at the end:\nProcessing platform/x86lin_gcc/IPA_lib/__impact_lib.c\ngcc -w -E -m32 -DIMPACT_FIX -I/home/ubuntu/trimaran/openimpact/platform/x86lin_gcc/include -I/home/ubuntu/trimaran/openimpact/include -I/home/ubuntu/trimaran/openimpact/config/x86lin_c platform/x86lin_gcc/IPA_lib/__impact_lib.c > platform/x86lin_gcc/IPA_lib/__impact_lib.i\nimpact-edgcpfe --pcode -m -w platform/x86lin_gcc/IPA_lib/__impact_lib.i\n\"platform/x86lin_gcc/IPA_lib/__impact_lib.c\", line 1943: error: declaration is\n          incompatible with \"int getnameinfo(const struct sockaddr\n          *__restrict__, socklen_t, char *__restrict__, socklen_t, char\n          *__restrict__, socklen_t, int)\" (declared at line 679 of\n          \"/usr/include/netdb.h\")\n  int getnameinfo(const struct sockaddr *sa, socklen_t salen, char *host,\n      ^\n\n1 error detected in the compilation of \"platform/x86lin_gcc/IPA_lib/__impact_lib.i\".\nExiting: non-zero exit code\nmake[1]: *** [platform/x86lin_gcc/IPA_lib/__impact_lib.pst] Error 1\nmake[1]: Leaving directory `/home/ubuntu/trimaran/openimpact'\nmake: *** [all] Error 2\n\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Open the file platform/x86lin_gcc/IPA_lib/__impact_lib.c and go to line NO: 1943 \nthen in the function getnameinfo( ) change the last parameter from  unsigned int flags to only  int flags  then try installing and the software openimpact will install successfully.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.10 won't boot from usb - isolinux.bin missing or corrupt This was an official 64-bit download from the Ubuntu site, so it's kind of sad to see even that's not working. \nI made a bootable Ubuntu 12.10 USB stick with USB Image Writer (mintstick) on Linux Mint 14 Cinnamon and then shut down after ejecting the drive. When I put the drive back in and boot from it, a message shows briefly: 'isolinux.bin missing or corrupt,' before going black and booting to Mint. \nI have tried Unetbootin instead of Mint's USB Image Writer but the USB drive does not show. Unetbootin has not worked for me in the past anyway whenever creating live USBs.\nUSB is formatted to msdos. Did not tamper w/ partitions, etc. in GParted, Disks, etc.\nI have seen this issue asked once before on this website and other times across the web, but no one gives a good answer other than it's probably a bad download. If so, it's pretty disappointing because this is the official Ubuntu.com download link.\nAny ideas? Are there any other alternate download mirrors besides the official one (that don't take hours to download)?\n\nA: I came across this problem(isolinux.bin missing or corrupt) recently.\nThe flash disk is made by dd, the iso file is of 12.04.3 64 bit.\nI fix this by change BIOS setting: change \n\nUSB Flash Drive Emulation Type\n\nfrom 'auto' to 'hard drive'.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: I just came across this problem when trying to install any OS onto a Toshiba Satellite.

But the solution was rather different from the answers already given (e.g. without changing BIOS settings or using extra-tools).\nI've created USB-stick via dd command:\nsudo dd if=linux.iso of=/dev/sdb\n\nAnd got during boot:\nisolinux.bin missing or corrupt\n\nThe stick I've used was not blank but contained some partitions before (as far as I can remember one of them was ISO9660 because I used the stick as Live-USB for past distribution).

The ISO would actually need to be installed onto the USB stick via a program such as unetbootin. https://unetbootin.github.io/\nAlternatively this could also be a permissions problem with ownership of the stick or the files and folders on it.\nI wish you all the best of luck at sorting your issue out.\n", "Q: Removing ubuntu-desktop through Software Center So, I try to delete some applications that I really don't need (Or that I've read reviews and there are better alternatives). But then I got on some applications that tell me \"If you uninstall \"X Application\", future updates will not include new items in the Ubuntu desktop systme set\"\nWhat does that mean? It's still safe to delete it?\nI'm running Ubuntu 12.10 64-bit.\nIs there anyway to remove the stuff I don't need without messing everything else up? \n\nA: Each Ubuntu derivative has its own \"desktop\". For example,  \n\n\n*\n\n*Unity has the ubuntu-desktop  \n\n*Lubuntu has the kubuntu-desktop  \n\n*Kubuntu has the kubuntu-desktop and  \n\n*Xubuntu has the xubuntu-desktop  \n\n\nEach of these \"desktops\" is a metapackage, decribed in detail in MetaPackages. These metapackages contain nothing but a list of software that give you the corresponding desktop experience. Installing lubuntu-desktop, for example, on Unity, will pull in all the software associated with Lubuntu and afford you the choice of running either Unity or Lubuntu at the time of logging in.\nThere are times, when, as you have observed, that you want to delete a piece of software for whatever reason and you maybe be warned that doing so will remove  ubuntu-desktop (or some other desktop depending on your environment.)\nIn fact, Synaptic has this caution regarding the ubuntu-desktop:  \n\nThis package depends on all of the packages in the Ubuntu desktop\n  system\nIt is also used to help ensure proper upgrades, so it is recommended\n  that it not be removed.\n\nBased on the Synaptic comment, removing the ubuntu-desktop now may be detrimental at some future date.\nOn the other hand, Synaptic says the same thing about lubuntu-desktop whereas community documentation on Lubuntu assures Lubuntu users that there's nothing to fear.\n\nWhen you want to remove a program from lubuntu, you may be told that\n  by doing so it will remove lubuntu-desktop. The package\n  lubuntu-desktop is only used for the installation of lubuntu and can\n  safely be removed.\nLubuntu-desktop is what is called a meta-package which, simply put, is\n  just a list of what to install. It is a design decision that all\n  packages included in lubuntu-desktop depend on it, so as to be able to\n  use --no-install-recommends option when the initial installation\n  occurs, thus preventing non-essential programs being installed.\nThe lubuntu-desktop would just need adding back in for the update from\n  10.04 to 10.10, after that it can be safely removed again.\n\nEven though the quote above refers to 10.04 and 10.10, more recent posts elsewhere have similar opinions. You could look at [Lubuntu-desktop] lubuntu-desktop metapackage - Recommends vs  Dependencies and the responses. Again, IMO, even though the desktop being talked about is Lubuntu, the same observations apply to Unity.\nIn my case, I no longer have lubuntu-desktop because I chose to remove a package of games, aces-of-penguins, and lubuntu-desktop went with it. I must mention that I will be doing a clean install from 12.10 to 13.04 and not an upgrade.\n\nA: You might want to install the Synaptic package manager and use that.  It give you more granular control for removing packages, as well as more information about what additional dependent packages will also be removed.\n", "Q: deploy multiple wordpress sites with juju This may seem like an obvious question, but can you deploy multiple (distinct) wordpress sites with their own databases etc? But using a single deployment? So not dedicated vm's for each sites services. And would the optimized tuning work in this scenario?\nie. we are currently using cpanel/centos to host multiple sites (standalone html sites and php/mysql wordpress sites) which uses virtual hosts.\nSo does the juju wordpress charm take into account setting up virtual hosts? or in the case of nginx \"server blocks\"?\nAlso using the wordpress charm can modify it to deploy standalone html sites (that don't require databases) along side it?\n\nA: You've got a few questions mixed in here, so I'll try to address each in turn, starting with the last one as it's the easiest to answer.\nCan the charm deploy standalone html sites along side WordPress?\nYes, you can! This is functionality that currently exists within the structure of the charm, but you'll need to keep your \"files\" (WordPress themes, plugins, and static files) all in a repository. The charm exposes a configuration option wp-content, while a little deceiving, this option allows you to point to any Git, BZR, Mercurial, or SVN repository. In the root of the repo is where you'd place all additional files you want at the root of your WordPress install. For instance if you want to add a plugin \"foo\" and a static file named \"client-login.html\" you would structure your repository like so:\n.\n├── client-login.html\n└── wp-content\n    └── plugins\n        └── foo\n\nThen, you would use juju set wordpress wp-client=<url-to-repo>. You can learn more about this in the WordPress charm documentation under \"wp-content\". You can find and example of this on Githubtwo example repositories.\nTake note that this won't be a separate website but static content within the WordPress site. If you're looking to host different websites, on different domains, within the context of the Juju Charm you'll need to create a new charm that would handle those scenarios\nAs for your second question,\nCan we deploy multiple WordPress sites to the same machine?\nThis is a feature I wanted to add from the start but wasn't quite possible at the time. Now Juju has advanced far enough that this is possible and I'm working on making this possible. The workflow involves using Juju's Subordinate charms to allow you to deploy a base WordPress install with:\njuju deploy wordpress-mu\n\nThen, you would deploy a subordinate charm, wordpress-site, on top of this base. From there the charm would configure it with it's own wp-content, configuration, and apache/nginx configuration, but it would share the same core base. So the configuration options like domain, wp-content, and debug would be moved to this separate charm. In the end you could deploy multiple wordpress-site charms, each unique, on to the single wordpress-mu deployment and still scale wordpress-mu (which would in turn scale all other WordPress site deployments). An example of the commands follow:\njuju deploy wordpress-mu\njuju deploy mysql\n\njuju deploy wordpress-site personal-blog\njuju deploy wordpress-site professional-blog\njuju deploy wordpress-site client-x\n\njuju add-relation personal-blog wordpress-mu\njuju add-relation professional-blog wordpress-mu\njuju add-relation client-x wordpress-mu\n\njuju add-relation personal-blog mysql\njuju add-relation professional-blog mysql\njuju add-relation client-x mysql\n\nAt the end of the day you still only have one server for WordPress but you've deployed three unique instances of WordPress to that server which you can control independently with Juju.\n", "Q: Can I install cadence on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS x86 Machine? I need a cadence-like application to switch between jack and pulse audio. Can I install cadence on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (Not Ubuntu Studio or Dream Studio).\nIs it going to work ? I already installed : QJackCTL, Pulsejack module etc.\n\n\nA: I have just done precisely that. I have not tested the result exhaustively but yes, so far it seems to work. The only thing I would suggest is, use the KX repositories only for the initial install of Cadence and its dependencies; once installed, disable those repositories. That will ensure that the Ubuntu Studio dependencies don't get shot to pieces by KX versions being out of step.\n\nA: Yes it is possible to install Cadence and all kxstudio apps from KXStudio repo on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS x86.\nFor that you need to add these two PPAs:\nppa:kxstudio-team/ppa\nppa:kxstudio-team/kxstudio\n\nOpen synaptic package manager and mark Cadence, Festige, Jackd(Upgrade), QjackCTL(Upgrade).\nDon't select any other application and don't upgrade everything, especially ffmpeg.\nDo not add any other PPAs as they tend to create problems, especially the \"kernels and drivers\" PPA.\nJust install those upper mentioned apps, they will automatically pull down all other required apps from kxstudio repository :)\nAfter installing everything either disable the PPAs or remove them.\n", "Q: I can't hear sounds with Ubuntu but can with Windows I can't hear ANY sounds whether I try to listen to music, movies, or YouTube.\nMy headphones are okay with Windows so please help me troubleshoot my Ubuntu set-up.\n\nA: Do you see that sound icon at the top right-hand corner of the screen? Click on it, and at the bottom of the menu that drops down, there's one labeled \"Sound Settings...\" Click on it. Check how many devices there are on the \"Output\" tab. See if changing devices helps. \n\nIf it does, congratulations, if it doesn't, change back to the original one, and keep reading.\nOn the \"Mode\" settings, there is a dropdown menu for different profiles for the selected current device.

To avoid such problem I should set the brightness level at 100% every time before shutdown.\nEfforts\nI’ve tried all suggested answers for brightness problems, including acpi_backlight in grub and echo values in rc.local, but no change.

I wonder that in this folder brightness is 125 (at maximum) but actual_brightness is 70, even if the backlight is at its actual maximum.    \nDoes anyone know about this or any possible solution?\n\nA: The solution is updating grub such this:\nOpen a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) and enter:\nsudo gedit /etc/default/grub\nThen find the line GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quite splash\" and add \"acpi_osi=Linux acpi_backlight=vendor\" like this:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash acpi_osi=Linux acpi_backlight=vendor\"\nSave and exit the file, and run:\nsudo update-grub\nNow the brightness level stays equal to the actual backlight level after reboot, and brightness hotkeys remain working. All other hotkeys which were working before grub changed are working now, but the hotkey for enabling/disabling touchpad.\n", "Q: Why can't I install Steam onto Ubuntu 12.10 32-bit or 64-bit version? At first I had installed a 32-bit version of Ubuntu 12.10 alongside Windows 7 Premium. When I tried installing Steam onto Ubuntu from the Steam client, I got an error message stating Wrong architecture 'i386'. \nThen I tried installing Steam through Ubuntu Software Center, and I got one message saying that \"Package dependencies cannot be resolved: This error could be caused by required additional software packages which are missing or not installable. Furthermore there could be a conflict between software packages which are not allowed to be installed at the same time.\" \nI also had another message stating, \"The application Ubuntu Software Center has experienced and internal error.

I think you may have to re-install the 32-bit version of Ubuntu, depending on whether your hardware is 32-bit or 64-bit.\n12.10 is the latest version of Ubuntu, but it isn't the most stable. I would recommend using 12.04 LTS (The LTS stands for \"Long Term Support\"). It's the most stable version of Ubuntu (LTS versions are the most stable). Valve built Steam for Linux to work with 12.04, so getting it to work on 12.10 may be a bit of a challenge if you're not familiar with Ubuntu.\nI assure you that you aren't losing anything by going to 12.04 LTS.\nAre you able to tell us what your hardware is, so we can tell you whether you should be running 32-bit Ubuntu or 64-bit Ubuntu?\n", "Q: GRUB2: Always fails to boot have to do a manual configfile on each boot http://paste.ubuntu.com/1690610/\nAfter doing a fresh install of Ubuntu 12.10 from a USB Thumb Drive, (Using UNetBootin to Copy the ISO to the Thumb Drive ...

Most of the commands that I was using in the GRUB recovery console pointed to an i386-pc path, where it should of been an x86_64-efi path. That might be part of the problem, I'm not sure.\ndygear@Dygear-Ubuntu:~$ ls /boot/grub\nfonts  grub.cfg  grub.efi  grubenv  locale  x86_64-efi\n\nAny ideas on how to fix this, or should I report this as a bug?\n\nA: In the 13.04 beta, I downloaded you can fix the underlying cause for this problem by manually partitioning the drive you are installing too, to add a EFI partition at the very beginning of the drive. This makes the installer realize that it needs to install grub-efi there.\n\nLet's first off, boot your system from the Rescue GRUB prompt.\nReboot the system, and boot into the correct drive for your install with Ubuntu. You should be presented with a grub rescue> prompt. From there type the following to boot into the system.\n\n\n*\n\n*set prefix=/boot/grub/\n\n*insmod normal This should turn your prompt's text from grey to white.\n\n*insmod linux.\n\n*linux /vmlinuz root=/dev/sdXY ro Replace X and Y with letter and number of your drive.\n\n*initrd /initrd.img\n\n*boot.\n\n\nThis should start the boot process for your system.\n\nNow that your are in your system, it's time to fix the underlying problem. For me that problem is that it can't find the /grub/i386-pc/ folder. The following should have you booting your system without having to rescue it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Press Alt + F2.\n\n*Type gksudo nautilus and press Enter.\n\n*Type your password.\n\n*Copy your /boot/grub/ directory into your / root directory.\n\n\nThe end result should be that you still have a /boot/ and now you have a /grub/ directory. Reboot the system and it should work. If it does not work, well, you're back at square one.\n\nIt seems to me that the under the following circumstances that GRUB will fail to boot the system right after installation of Ubuntu 12.10 if the following conditions are TRUE.\n\n\n*\n\n*You have an UEFI based system.\n\n*During the install process you delete the entire disk that you are installing too.\n\n*After deleting the entire disk, you do not make a new partition, but simply click next and let the installer do it's magic.\n\n\nThis seems to me where the problem stems from, because the installer does not take into account that it needs to make a EFI partition for the /boot/ directory, but GRUB does not get this memo at all and as far as it knows the /boot/ directory is on it's own partition. From there GRUB tries to read /grub/ but it can't because it's nested in /boot/grub.\nThat's my take on it anyway. Thankfully my system now boots without me having to do some crazy kung-fo on the grub command line.\n\nA: I had a similar problem with my Ubuntu machine. I used software-update to upgrade to 12.04 from 11.10 and somewhere along the way something broke. I was booting into the grub rescue prompt and then I did something I can't remember and was then constantly booting to the grub prompt. From the grub prompt I could load the configfile with the command:\n\ngrub> configfile (hd0,msdos1)/boot/grub/grub.cfg\n\nI tried update-grub, but that didn't help. Then I just reinstalled grub with:\n\n$ sudo grub-install /dev/sda\n\n...and then ran update-grub for good measure, rebooted and it worked.\n", "Q: Getting files from an external partition So I had an external partition on Windows where I used to save (Not important stuff) stuff. Whatever I've been looking around but there's no tool that let's you check the partition.\nIs there any tool that lets you look the stuff inside a partition?\n\nA: Open a window. Underneath the buttons that let you close the window, there should be a list labelled \"Devices\". Your Windows partition should be there. It might be named after the size of the partition.\n", "Q: Are the advantages of having /home on a separate partition actually advantages? With reference to answers given here, it is mentioned multiple times that the main advantage is the ability to change/reinstall Ubuntu versions without losing configuration files. However, will a new install not require all you applications to be reinstalled ?\nLiving in countries where internet connections are slow, won't reinstalling the applications, updating OS, installing drivers just negate this advantage ? You might spend less time switching between Ubuntu versions' but you will spend as much time or more, making them usable each time.\n\nA: In your home partition are all your settings files and personal files stored. The hidden settings files can be shown in Nautilus by pressing Ctrl+h. So when reinstalling Ubuntu, with a separate home partition, you will keep your Firefox settings, text editor settings, ssh keys, photos, documents, etc. But yes, you will need to reinstall the actual programs.\nAnother advantage may be that you have a small SSD (60 GB perhaps) for the OS, and then you can have your home partition on a separate, larger mechanical HDD, where the speed isn't as essential and space is more needed.\n", "Q: How to copy paste contents in the vi editor I tried using Ctrl + V for pasting contents in a vi editor document, but Ctrl + V is not interpreted as a paste.\n\nA: Once you enter vi, press i to get into insert mode, right click into terminal, click paste.\n\nA: Vi (and Vim) works very differently compared to a normal text editor such as Gedit. It also has a pretty steep learning curve. If you want to learn some basic commands, start with this interactive tutorial.\nHowever, to answer you question. The system clipboard's content can be accessed through the plus register. So to paste something from the system clipboard you can, from the Normal mode, press: \"+p (Not at the same time, but one after another). \n\nA: Detailed instructions to copy/paste lines of text in vi using yank and put\n(use the following in the command mode of vi)\nCopy (YANK)\nTo copy one line in vi:\n\n\n*\n\n*In the command mode, move the cursor to the line that needs to be copied and type yy or type Y\nTo copy 2 lines in vi:\n\n\n*\n\n*In the command mode, move the cursor to the first line that needs to be copied and type 2yy or type 2Y\n(likewise, any number of lines can be copied)\nTo copy all lines from the current location to the end of the file:\n\n\n*\n\n*In the command mode, move the cursor to the first line that needs to be copied and type yG\nTo copy all text from the current location to the end of the current word:\n\n\n*\n\n*In the command mode, move the cursor to location from where text needs to be copied and type yw\nTo copy all text from the current location to the end of the line:\n\n\n*\n\n*In the command mode, move the cursor to location from where text needs to be copied and type y$\nPaste (PUT)\nTo paste text in the clipboard - after the location of the cursor:\n\n\n*\n\n*In the command mode, type p\nTo paste text in the clipboard - before the location of the cursor:\n\n\n*\n\n*In the command mode, type P\n\nA: With Vim 8+ on Linux or Mac, you can now simply use the OS' native paste (ctrl+shift+V on Linux, cmd+V on Mac). Do not press i for Insert Mode.\nIt will paste the contents of your OS clipboard, preserving the spaces and tabs without adding autoindenting. It's equivalent to the old :set paste, i, ctrl+shift+V, esc, :set nopaste method.\nYou don't even need the +clipboard or +xterm_clipboard vim features installed anymore. This feature is called \"bracketed paste\". For more details, see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2514445/turning-off-auto-indent-when-pasting-text-into-vim/56781763#56781763\n\nA: I always use Shift+Insert when I want to paste text into the terminal, works in all terminal programs.\n(Which is also the reason why I never get a laptop where you can't press Insert without pressing a secondary key)\n\nA: *\n\n*If you want to copy paste contents within the same file, use yank and paste.\n\n*If you want to copy paste contents across terminals, open the first file, yanking the text you want, then open your second file within vim (e.g. :tabnew /path/to/second/file) and press p to paste it.\n\n*If you want to copy paste contents from vim to an external program, you need to access the system clipboard. I assume you use Ubuntu. The GUI version of vim always has clipboard support, however, if you like to use Vim from a terminal, you will have to check for X11-clipboard support.\nFrom the console, type:\n$ vim --version | grep xterm\n\nIf you find -xterm_clipboard, you have two options:\n1) Compile vim yourself, with the xterm_clipboard flag on\n2) Uninstall vim, install gvim (vim-gtk or vim-gnome) instead. You can stick to non-gui vim by calling vim from the terminal, the same way you did before. This time when you check you should find +xterm_clipborad.\nNow, when you yank some text in the + register inside your vim editor (e.g. \"+yy), it also gets copied to the system clipboard which you can retrieve from your external program like gedit editor, by using Ctrl+V.\n\n*If you want to copy paste contents from an external program into vim, first copy your text into system clipboard via Ctrl+C, then in vim editor insert mode, click the mouse middle button (usually the wheel) or press Ctrl+Shift+V to paste.\nThese are 4 basic copy & paste conditions related to vim. I hope this helps.\n\nA: First, make sure you're in edit mode (press i). Then you can paste with Ctrl+Shift+V, if you're in a terminal emulator like gnome-terminal (or select \"Paste\" from the right-click menu).\nYou can also type :set paste in vim before you paste to disable automated indenting, etc. Then :set nopaste after you've pasted the content.\nAlso check this question on stackoverflow.com for more information.\nIf you want to copy/paste lines in vim (as opposed to pasting clipboard content), you'll want to check out the yank command. Here is a cheat sheet that might help.\n\nA: I had an issue, because my Vim installation was not supporting the clipboard:\nvim --version | grep clip\n-clipboard       +insert_expand   +path_extra      +user_commands\n+emacs_tags      -mouseshape      +startuptime     -xterm_clipboard\n\nI installed vim-gnome (which supports the clipboard) and then checked again:\nvim --version | grep clipboard\n+clipboard       +insert_expand   +path_extra      +user_commands\n+emacs_tags      +mouseshape      +startuptime     +xterm_clipboard\n\nNow I am able to copy and paste using \"+y and \"+p respectively.\n\nA: First, check if your vim has clipboard support installed \n:echo has('clipboard')\n\nIf it returns 1 you do have clipboard support\nTo copy to the clipboard you have to either select your target, let's say a paragraph vip and then \"+y, which means to the register + copy the selected portion or you can simply type in normal mode: \"+yip, which means: to the register + copy inner paragraph. \nTo paste from the clipboard in normal mode you can: \n\"+p\n\nOn insert mode you can simply Ctrl-rCtrl-o+. Tha will insert your clipboard content and preserve all indentation as it is on the clipboard.\nIf you want to copy the whole buffer to the clipboard you can:\n:%y+\n% ........ the whole file\ny ........ yank (copy)\n+ ........ to the clipboard\n\nTo copy the last command to the clipboard:\n:let @+=@:\n\nTo copy the last search to the clipboard:\n :let @+=@/\n\nto copy from the mark \"a\" until the mark \"b\" to the clipboard:\n :'a,'b y+\n\nTo test any function that is on the clipboard you can\n:@+    (and then type Enter)\n:call FunctionName() (and then type Enter)\n\nTo see what is on the clipboard:\n:reg +\n\nTo copy all lines that have \"pattern\" to the clipboard you can:\n:let @a=\"\"\n:[range]g/pattern/y A\n:let @+=@a\n\n:let @a=\"\" ............ cleanses the register 'a'\n:[range]g/pattern/y A   append to the register A every line with pattern\n:let @+=@a ............ copy register 'a' to the clipboard\n\n\nA: Use the center button of the mouse to insert text you've highlighted elsewhere. \nIt is useful when you don't have access to your system clipboard (for example, in a remote SSH session).\nMust be in edit/insert mode for Vim.\n\nA: You could use Ctrl+Shift+V to paste in terminal version vim, But for GUI version vim like Neovim-Qt, pasting text from the system clipboard with Ctrl+Shift+V simply won't work. You have to access to the clipboard \"+ or \"* in the vim editor. \nAdding new keybinding in .vimrc will simply the copy/paste commands:\n\" paste from system clipboard, align indentation with surroundings\nnoremap <Leader>p \"*]p:set nopaste<CR>\n\" copy a sentence into system clipboard\nnoremap <Leader>y \"+y)\n\n\nA: If you're root: Ctrl+Shift+V\nIf you're not-root: Center click the mouse.\n\nA: I just wanted to note that using Vim via Git Bash on Windows, you can just use p or center-click of the mouse without being in insert mode. Using Vim through PuTTY, you can just right click. And highlighting does the copying.\nI've noted this because I got here not seeing that this is SE for Ubuntu.\nOther helpful commands:\n\n\n*\n\n*yy(# of lines) - yank (copy)\n\n*dd(# of lines) - delete\n\n*p - paste line below current line\n\n*Shift + p - paste line above current line\n\n*u - undo\n\n*r - redo\n\n*i - insert mode\n\n*v - visual mode\n\n", "Q: Cannot install Handbrake in 64-bit Ubuntu 12.10 When I go into Synaptic and try to install the handbrake-gtk, after it gives me the list of all the other packages it has to install, I get this message:\n\nThe following packages have unresolved dependencies.

You will need to authorize any changes to the system with your normal password\n\n*If you want to receive recommendations, you can connect USC to your Launchpad account, which is the same as your Ubuntu One account. This is purely optional. It is required because your local login information isn't shared with the Ubuntu servers at all. The only thing they know about you is your IP and optionally your Launchpad login.

Please excuse me if my question is a stupid one. This is my first tryst with Ubuntu :)\n\nA: *\n\n*This is possible, though I don't recommend it (see #2). You'll need to mount your external drive permanently on /tmp by editing the /etc/fstab file as seen here.

You should not expect to be able to do any development, save many files, or install any real number of extra applications. To have the best experience with Ubuntu, you should install on a larger disk.\n\n\nA: First of all you should format the USB storage to some file system that allows POSIX access permissions, like ext4. Check what your root partition is and format the external store to the same file system.\nThen set up your USB to be mounted at boot by adding a line to /etc/fstab:\nUUID=PUT-UUID-HERE               /mnt/mytmp               ext4            noatime         0 0\n\n(Remember to add the UUID to the above line).\nThen you could add another line as well, to bind the mount point to /tmp:\n/mnt/mytmp               /tmp               none            bind         0 0\n\nThis will bind the mount point /mnt/mytmp to be available as /tmp as well.\nUPDATE: You can find the UUID of your disk by looking at symlinks in /dev/disk/by-uuid.\n", "Q: Where to find synaptics mouspad gesture installation packages I stumbled upon following web page  and was immediately interested in the mousepad gesture possibilities.

Firefox determines which program to use to open a download based on the download's MIME type. More information on that can be found in Mozilla's online documentation.\nIt seems to me that when Firefox encounters a MIME type it has no configuration for, it prompts the user to open it in Gedit. Why Gedit? How can I change the default for unrecognised MIME types to gnome-open?\n\nA: The setting for mime types in firefox is stored in helpers.global_mime_types_file and helpers.private_mime_types_file. You can see their values in about:config :  \nAlso default applications for mime types are stored in either ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list or in /usr/share/applications/defaults.list. In my case, this line application/octet-stream=gedit.desktop; was present in mimeapps.list and hence firefox prompted to open some applications in gedit. You can change it to some different application of your choice.\n\nA: Introduction to the Content-Type header:\nEvery HTTP response contains a header named Content-Type, it contains the MIME type of the returned data stream. For example, the MIME type could be text/plain or text/html.\nServers are usually configured to set the Content-Type header to application/octet-stream when it can't determine itself what the file type of the download is. This is why you annoyingly don't get the correct suggestion on downloading new or non-universal file types, like .deb files.\nChanging the default action for new and unrecognised MIME types:\nFor new and unrecognised MIME types, you can simply set the default action by ticking the \"Do this automatically for files like this from now on\" checkbox in the  download prompt. The checkbox is disabled initially, but you can enable it by clicking the radio button next to \"Open with\" or changing the default application.\nYou'll be able to review your choices by opening the Applications tabs under Edit, Preferences.\nChanging the default action for application/octet-stream:\nFor some reason, Firefox won't let you change the default action for application/octet-stream files. You will have to change the user's default handler for that MIME type, like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list.\n\n*Find the line beginning with application/octet-stream= under [Added Associations]. If it's not there, create it.\n\n*On the right hand side of the equals sign, put: gedit.desktop;, or whichever .desktop you want to use.\n\n\nChanging the default action for application/octet-stream to gnome-open:\nIn my case, I want to default to gnome-open, but it doesn't have a pre-existing .desktop file, so I created one under ~/.local/share/applications/ with these contents:\n[Desktop Entry]\nEncoding=UTF-8\nVersion=1.0\nType=Application\nExec=gnome-open %f\nName=gnome-open\nComment=Custom definition for gnome-open\nNoDisplay=true\n\n", "Q: Cannot set up LAN internet connection I just installed both current versions 12.04 and 12.10 of Ubuntu (not simultaneously) and i could not set up an internet connection.

From this the problem is fairly clear. You have a 64 bit processor but the package ist for 32 bit. So you need a different package.\nBut as Steam is now in the Ubuntu Software Center, that would be the way to go. In linux you never download programs manually. If it's not in the Ubuntu Software Center, you can almost always find a repository for ubuntu where you can get what you want.\n\nA: You should either download the 64bit version of the deb package or just install Steam from the Ubuntu Software-Center.\n", "Q: The unicode fonts layout provided by Ubuntu vs. the official font layout While choosing Nepali language.

I checked that Windows is installed in UEFI mode.\nI did a lot of research online on how to get Ubuntu 12.10 installed for dual boot.\nFirst, I xhanged the BIOS settings from quick boot to normal and disabled Secure Boot.\nI installed EaseUS Partition Master 9.2.1 and created a 64GB partition (NTFS), I called this partition F drive.\nI also downloaded Ubuntu 12.10 64-bit DVD iso. In Windows 8 desktop mode, I launched Ubuntu Studio 12.10 and installed Ubuntu on this F drive. The installation went all the way to the end without a problem. When the Ubuntu installation was done, I rebooted.\nAfter reboot, the problem appears. I can see a light blue display, showing Windows 8 and Ubuntu. When I selected Ubuntu, it popped up with another screen showing:\n\nWindows fails to start. A recent hardware or software change might be the cause. \nTo fix the problem:\n 1.

I have got NVIDIA 8400GS which is giving me a lot of problems. Ubuntu does not take the drivers automatically and I'm forced to work in 800 x 600. I tried to install additional drivers but it did not do anything rather it gave me an error after installation and I had to reinstall the system.\nNow I'm trying to install the drivers manually, but when I go to Console mode and turning off the graphics via Ctrl+Alt+F1, the screen remains black and whatever I type, nothing happens.\nHow can I fix it?\n\nA: The gentleman has 2 problems:\n1. He needs NVIDIA 8400GS support\n2. Ctrl+Alt+F1/F2/F3/F4 doesn't work.\nIssue #1 - You should try going into the hardware drivers of your Ubuntu settings manager.  I forgot what Ubuntu 12.04 looks like in Unity or Gnome.  So I cannot guide you there.  If this does not work out, I would suggest doing a distro upgrade to 13.04 (Raring).  That I have done before in the Xubuntu flavor and it worked like a charm.  Why do this?  The hardware support of older graphics boards improved in the kernel and Xorg software.\nIssue #2 - I have been trying myself to find out how to get back Ctrl+Alt+F1/F2/F3/F4 functions from years gone by.  This is a life saver when things go really bad on the desktop and you need to break in with a tty to perform trouble-shooting.  All I get now in 13.04 and 13.10 with Ctrl+Alt+F1 are dead desktop keyboard typing and mouse when I do that although, fortunately, Ctrl+Alt+F7 takes me back to sanity.\n\nA: This is a known bug in the nvidia drivers, too many links out there to reference.

This morning I tried appending nomodeset to the kernel line and it worked, but I'm sure that I've tried this in the past without success.\nFor anyone tracking this, I'm running Ubuntu 14.04LTS on a MSI X58M (MS-7593) motherboard with an nVidia GeForce 210 card and the current nvidia-331 driver.\n\nA: Actually, if Ctrl+Alt+F1 doesn't work, you need to start in recovery mode as your machine is just hung.  Ctrl+Alt+F1 should bring you into a text console without graphics.  \nOnce in recovery mode, you need to uninstall the drivers you have...  Afterwards, I would advise not to use the standard Ubuntu NVidia drivers as they generate some problems on slightly older and slightly newer NVidia hardware.\nIf you want more then the standard Ubuntu repository drivers, install the xorg.edgers PPA.  As the xorg.edgers group ask not to give installation instructions directly without linking to their page, this is the best I can do.\nIf you don't know what a PPA is or need some guidance after reading their page, leave a comment below.\n", "Q: Shortcut to boot on ubuntu from windows I have a dual-boot Windows/Ubuntu, my default OS is Windows :(.\nSo, when Windows is started and I need to go to Ubuntu, i need to choose him on Grub, of course.

There is a way to do this?\n\nA: download easybcd\nadd ubuntu to the boot list \nmake sure the boot type is grub 2 (default is grub)\nthen make it boot with windows bootloader\nbtw which windows is this\n\nA: The simple answer is no.\nImagine it this way: when you boot your computer (the machine that you can hit with a hammer when you are angry) it's going to ask your drive for instructions. If only windows is present: boom, you boot-up on windows. However, when grub is present, grub will work as kinda of a tiny system that will let you choose further. Whilst you are in Grub, Windows hasn't done anything yet. In fact Windows doesn't even know Grub is there.\nWhat you can do, however, is configure Grub to boot straight to Ubuntu. Alternatively you can use a Virtual Machine.\n\nA: The solution by Hate Linux (plus iReboot)  works if your Windows bootloader starts first. If you want Grub to control your boot process, there is another tool: grub-choose-default. However, to use it from Windows, you have to make your /boot partition accessible from Windows. This usually means formatting it as ext2 and using EXT2IFS. Also, I haven't found a PPA for this tool with packages for recent Ubuntu versions.\nSee also the following questions on Unix.SX:\nhttps://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/11423/how-do-i-change-the-grub-boot-configuration-from-within-windows\nhttps://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/43196/how-can-i-tell-grub-i-want-to-reboot-into-windowsbefore-i-reboot\n", "Q: predefined cell ID assignment for an ad-hoc wlan I have a debian/ubuntu embedded boards that I connect them via an ad-hoc network with the following settings\nboard:~# cat /etc/network/interfaces\nauto wlan0\niface wlan0 inet static\n        address 10.0.0.2\n        netmask 255.255.255.0\n        wpa-driver nl80211\n        wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf\n\nboard:~# cat /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf\n# IBSS/ad-hoc network with WPA-None/TKIP.\nctrl_interface=/var/run/wpa_supplicant\nap_scan=1\n\nnetwork={\n        ssid=\"adhoc_test\"\n        mode=1\n        frequency=2412\n        proto=WPA\n        key_mgmt=WPA-NONE\n        pairwise=NONE\n        group=TKIP\n        psk=\"abcdefgh\"\n        bssid=F8:D1:11:52:0C:4E\n}\n\nThese configurations creates an ad-hoc wlan, however, the nodes often gets different cell ID so that they cannot communicate with each other.

(And I Googled a lot ;) ) \nHowever, have you tried the suspend-mode in Ubuntu ? This option is more steady than hibernation I've learned over the several versions of Ubuntu. \nSuspend writes your RAM-memory away to the disc and awakes very fast (within 15 seconds you're back online). In version (kernel 3.5) 12.10 this feature is a lot improved, so I feel you should try this option a time. \nThe downside of suspend is that it consumes a bit more energy (if that is an issue of course) \n", "Q: How can set disk IO priority automatically? If I use some IO intensive application (like Virtualbox, Steam data verification or even dd) my system becomes almost unresponsive. Despite  all being started with normal priority, they make the desktop very sluggish and delay a lot the startup of other applications.\nI know I can use something like ionice to change the priority to idle for instance, but in the case of Virtualbox which spawns many processes it becomes difficult.\nCan I give some type of hints to the system, so when launching some specific applications they are started with the least IO priority?\n\nA: Note: This solution only works with the cfq scheduler, as explained here. You should check which one is used by issuing\ncat /sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler\n\nand change it if necessary.\nIf I understood correctly, you want some ionice setting to be applied every time you start a command. You can do it this way:\necho 'ionice -c 3 /usr/bin/VirtualBox \"$@\"' > VirtualBox\nchmod a+x VirtualBox\nsudo mv VirtualBox /usr/local/bin/\n\nFirst command creates a file VirtualBox with the single-quoted text as its content. This should have the full path to the program, because if one only specify VirtualBox it can interpret it as the file we just created and create a \"loop\".\nSecond command makes it executable, and third moves this new file in a folder which is in front of the \"system\" bin folder /usr/bin, so our new file gets executed instead of the original. The \"$@\" part contains all the arguments the command was invoked with, so they get forwarded to the real VirtualBox command.\nAccording to answer (\"yes\") to this Super User question Do children processes inherit ionice priorities from their parents? How do you check the IO priority of a running process?, it should be enough to ionice the parent process, like this:\nionice -c 3 VirtualBox\n\nFrom ionice man page, following I/O scheduling class values are available:\n\n\n*\n\n*0 for none\n\n*1 for realtime\n\n*2 for best-effort\n\n*3 for idle (used in example above)\n\n\nA number or class name can be used.\nAlso, -n level option is applicable for realtime and best-effort classes, with 0-7 as valid data (priority levels).\n\nA: You can use the 'renice' command to prioritise processes:\nrenice -<priority> <application's pid>\n\nIt could also be your drive is spinning down too much, so when you want to start application like Virtualbox it has to spin up before you can start working around (this can take a while).\n", "Q: Where is Sublime Text 2 installed I was trying to make Sublime Text 2 start from the Terminal.

I want to read my .bok file from maktaba shamela in Ubuntu 12.04. I tried install it by typing:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:sabily.team/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\n\nAnd then I installed it. But then showed:\nE: unable locate thwab package.\n\nAnd I tried other way, dowloading thwab-lib_1.1.2.orig.tar.gz.\nBut I don't know how to install thwab-lib_1.1.2.orig.tar.gz in Ubuntu. What can I do?\n\nA: After the 2 commands I went to USC and it is there (mind you: I SEARCHED for thwab and it shows thawab!!):\n\nSo you probably need to do:\nsudo apt-get install thawab\n\nNo thwab in the USC ....\nLooking at the contents of the PPA: https://launchpad.net/~sabily.team/+archive/ppa/+index?batch=75&memo=75&start=75\nFound a DEB Installer for thwab here: https://launchpad.net/~sabily.team/+archive/ppa/+sourcepub/1415835/+listing-archive-extra\nSo download that and install the DEB by clicking it and have USC handle it.\n", "Q: Making Wubi bigger, or Upgrading to Ubuntu without loosing Windows? I have 4 hard disks. I've got Wubi installed on one, and Windows installed on another.\nThe 300GB Drive for Wubi/Ubuntu is empty, except for Wubi. I'd like to let it take the full 300GB if it's appropriate, not the 30GB that Wubi gave it.\nI still need Windows as software on the two \"data\" needs it and there isn't a Linux alternative yet, so dual booting is still required.\nMy Drives:\n1TB Windows,\n300GB Data,\n1TB Data (Steam),\n300GB Wubi\nI'm very new to Linux, I think you may be able to blame Gabe Newell for this one.\n\nA: You can do a normal install of ubuntu, safely, on the disk that now holds wubi.\nSteps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Uninstall wubi (maybe move your personal files to a data disk first);\n\n*Download a normal ubuntu installer;\n\n*Boot it from usb or cd;\n\n*The installation program will ask you for a target disk. Select the one where wubi was previously installed.\n\n", "Q: Blacklisted items I have been trying to update my Ubuntu but whenever I click on Upgrade, my system does the usual checks and tells me it can only do a \"Partial install\" which, when I accept returns this error: \nAn unresolvable problem occurred while calculating the upgrade:\nThe package 'unity-2d' is marked for removal but it is in the \nremoval blacklist.\n\nHow do I resolve it? I have rev 12.04 LTS installed\nAs requested, the output of  (1) cat /etc/apt/sources.list (2) for X in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*; do echo; echo; echo \"** $X:\"; echo; cat $X; done (3) sudo apt-get update (4) apt-get -s upgrade and (5) apt-get -s dist-upgrade are shown in this pastebin.\n\nA: Debian software sources may give wrong package versions, with wrong dependencies.\nWrong for Ubuntu, that is. (Similarly, Ubuntu software sources may cause problems on Debian.)\nFrom the information you provided, the most likely cause of the problem is probably that you have Debian software sources enabled:\ndeb http://ftp.se.debian.org/debian stable main\ndeb-src http://ftp.se.debian.org/debian stable main\n\nIf you disable them, that may solve the problem. To do that, first back up sources.list:\nsudo cp /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.old\n\nThen edit it:\n\n*\n\n*Graphically, with gksu gedit /etc/apt/sources/list, or\n\n*in the terminal, with: sudo nano -w /etc/apt/sources.list\nFind those two lines and add # to the beginning so they read:\n#deb http://ftp.se.debian.org/debian stable main\n#deb-src http://ftp.se.debian.org/debian stable main\n\nThen save the file, quit the text editor, and run:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nSee if the problem is fixed.\nIf you deliberately added those software sources and installed software from those repositories, then please edit your question to provide details, so I can give information about how to use the software (if possible) without causing problems. It is possible to enable a repository but configure it so it's only used for a couple packages.\nYou have many non-working PPAs.\nThis is less likely to be causing the current problem, but I recommend fixing this. It's worth fixing itself, and at least it will no longer obscure whatever is causing the problem.\n\n*\n\n*How can I fix a 404 Error when using a PPA or updating my package lists?\nIf you do these things, and the problem isn't fixed, please provide more information.\nYou posted only incomplete output from apt-get -s upgrade and apt-get -s dist-upgrade, since the output was too large to fit in the Terminal window.\nSo, run these commands instead:\ncd ~\napt-get -s upgrade &> simulated-upgrade.log\napt-get -s dist-upgrade &> simulated-dist-upgrade.log\n\nThen open simulated-upgrade.log in a text editor (it's in your home folder), copy its contents to the clipboard, paste it at http://paste.ubuntu.com, and provide the link. Do the same thing for simulated-dist-upgrade.log. (The best way to provide both links is to edit your question.)\n", "Q: How to prevent Tor from starting automatically on Ubuntu server? How do I stop Tor from starting automatically on startup? It is Ubuntu Server so I don't have any GUI.\n\nA: You have several options here. For a GUI user I'd suggest using  bum (Boot-Up Manager) like this answer. However you are using a server and at the moment Tor has not moved to upstart, so you can use update-rc.d or rm.\n\n\n*\n\n*Enter sudo update-rc.d -f tor remove. This removes all symlinks and at the next reboot Tor will not start. The answer to \"Chkconfig alternative for Ubuntu Server?\" discusses this.\n\n*Enter sudo update-rc.d tor disable. This changes the start script to a stop script and effectively also disables Tor starting at boot time. The answer to \"how to stop apache2, mysql from starting automatically as computer starts?\" discusses this method.\n\n*As SystemV only uses symbolic links, you can use rm to remove these: sudo rm /etc/rc?.d/S*tor. This deletes every file in the rcX.d subdirectories (X stands for a number or S) which starts with the letter S (for Start script) and ends with tor.\n\n*The same effect has a combination of find and rm: find /etc/rc?.d -type l -name \"S*tor\" -exec rm {} \\;. This looks specific for symbolic links.\n\n\nA: This is quite confusing. But generally you can edit /etc/default/tor and change RUN_DAEMON=\"yes\" to RUN_DAEMON=\"no\". Now Vidalia should start its own tor and tor should not start at startup.\n\nA: Small update.\nSince 15.04, Ubuntu uses systemd instead of upstart by default so now to disable tor on startup we should run:\nsudo systemctl disable tor.service\n\n", "Q: How do I enable Wireless networking with an Atheros 9485 device?

I installed ubuntu 12.10 but I couldn't connect to wireless network. did some googling and tried some suggestions but now I don't even have the choice to enable wireless networking. I can only connect to the internet by wired connection.\n\nA: Get rid off from the Network manager on Ubuntu. Before doing it, first, install Wicd Network manager by sudo apt-get install wicd, then remove the connection manager sudo apt-get remove --purge network-manager-gnome network-manager. check if you have any settings on /etc/network/interfaces just keep \n   auto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\nthen Wicd should give you what you want\n", "Q: How to remove Ubuntu partition and boot menu? how do I completely remove the Ubuntu partition and the boot menu so I can just keep the Windows 7 partition and boot directly into it?

I have a ext4 partition on the disk - could that interfere somehow? I can format it, but I am lazy to do that unless necessary.\nDell latitude e5410.\nThx for any help.\n\nA: It's hard to say how much we can concider this as an answer, but it is a solution. I've decided to give a try to 32bit installation ISO, which worked. Unfortunately I can't tell why, because I have no idea what so ever. I installed the system and everything works fine. When I tried later on (after the install) the 64bit ISO again, I was able to load it. I have no idea why as well.\nAnyway, if you experience any trouble similiar to this, just try to use 32bit installation ISO.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Software Center rendering glitch with NVIDIA drivers I installed Ubuntu 12.10 in my HDD, after that I had some problems because I couldn't boot Ubuntu and the pc booted with Windows instead. (Dual boot screen didn’t appear). I solved this through boot repair. But now my fonts on Ubuntu Software Center are like this:  \n\nFrom what I've noticed, this is the only program affected.

When a new package is installed (even from source), or existing ones are updated/deleted/purged, some system files seem to be updated. Which are these?\nI want the files which contain the list of these packages and their status, not the packages themselves. \nEDIT: A few of the files I came to know are /var/lib/dpkg/status and /var/lib/dpkg/status-old which get updated when you install a new package. I just want an exhaustive list of all these files.\n\nA: dpkg\ndpkg keeps some information in /var/lib/dpkg/:\n\n*\n\n*info/PACKAGENAME.* (where PACKAGENAME is the name of the package): file list and  control files from the DEBIAN/ folder inside the package\n\n*diversions: diverted file locations, see dpkg-divert\n\n*alternatives: information for the Debian alternatives system, see update-alternatives\n\n*triggers: package triggers, see dpkg-trigger\napt\n\n*\n\n*/var/lib/apt/extended_states: package information not used by dpkg, like the auto-installed flags\n\n*/var/log/apt/: several log files\n\n", "Q: Why isn't Unity loading on VirtualBox? \nI also tried Unity doesn't load, no Launcher, no Dash appears, and none of the solutions worked.

I'm sorry for my lack of knowledge about this kind of thing but I would really like to revert back.  Thank you.\n\nA: If your computer has a recovery partition (and you didn't delete it when installing Ubuntu) then you can boot to that. Check the PC manufacturer's website for instructions specific to your computer.\nIf not, however, then reinstalling from a Windows Disc is your only recourse.\nFor future reference; if you ever want to try any Ubuntu distribution you can burn it to a CD and boot to it, then try it out without installing. This makes it easier to audition without the danger of losing your current OS.\n", "Q: How do I change screen resolution? I am unable to change my screen resolution in my ubuntu 12.04.

Or at least some links to similar topics??\n\nA: Ubuntu 12.04.02 ships with a Hardware enablement stack. Basically this is a stack providing kernel/xorg from Quantal (packages linux-generic-lts-quantal and xserver-xorg-lts-quantal) to improve hardware support.\nWhat probably happened when you installed Bumblebee is that, because it depends on the default Xorg stack, xserver-xorg-lts-quantal was removed and replaced with xserver-xorg, and those two stacks don't seem to work well when mixed.\nTo fix this you need to boot in text mode. The easiest way is to achieve this is pressing E when you highlight your Ubuntu entry on Grub. This will let you edit the entry (non permanently). There you should see a line similar to this:\nlinux   /boot/vmlinuz-3.5.0-23-generic root=UUID=(...)  ro   quiet splash $vt_handoff\n\nReplace the quiet splash $vt_handoff with text and press Ctrl+X. This should boot you in text mode. After login you have to choose what to do next:\n\n\n*\n\n*Revert the changes you made: this will remove Bumblebee and  let you start your system again. You will only be able to install Bumblebee without breaking the system when someone fixes Bumblebee dependencies\nsudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-lts-quantal linux-generic-lts-quantal\n\n\n*Remove the Hardware Enablement stack. This will let you install Bumblebee.\nsudo apt-get install linux-generic xserver-xorg\n\nEither one of those options will install a lot of packages and remove others, so you will need to have internet access. Also if you have important information make a backup before you proceed.\nI had the same problem and used the second option, and everything works now.

Have a look at this question, which gives extensively explains how to do this.\n\nA: Ofcourse.\nWhen you install sofware it downloads .deb files (debiain installer files). You can put those on a pendrive and install them manually.

This most recent attempt at installing stops at the installation type screen where I inform it to dualboot with my Windows 7 64 bit OS. When I clicked install now, I receive an error stating:\nstarting sector number, 4294967296 exceeds the msdos-partition-table-imposed maximum of 4294967295\n\nWith this error I cannot click the ok button to remove the error as it stays there and it doesn't seem to be frozen as I can see the lighting on the button light up when I mouse over the selection but it will not continue.\nI have heard this error occurs from 3TB hard drives (which I have) not working properly with Ubuntu. However, when I encountered this error before I somehow got around it and ended up with 2TB on my normal C: drive and 700~GB on a new partition like drive.\nI don't remember doing anything to spur this on but I only assume it was during my troubleshooting of the situation last time and it ended up causing it to split up that 700~gb to another drive.\nAlso a small question about that, does Ubuntu do that or do I need to do it because Ubuntu cannot handle 3TB hard drives and has to force the hard drive to turn into around 2TB where it can easily work with it? I didn't exactly know why it needed it and if it maybe caused it on it's own.\nI am relatively new to the Linux scene.\n\nA: You need to back up and obtain more information. Other answers have been assuming that you're using MBR, but your comment that you're using UEFI firmware raises the possibility that you're already using GPT. If this is the case, then the error message you received is a bug. You can check your partition table type in various ways, depending on the partitioning tool you're using. In Linux, one easy way is to type sudo parted -l and look for output like the following:\nPartition Table: gpt\n\nThis output indicates a GPT disk. An MBR disk will specify msdos rather than gpt. Once you've determined your disk type, you can proceed without guesswork. Chances are you are using MBR and BIOS-mode booting of Windows, but it's best to be sure before doing anything radical.\nWindows (including Windows 8, AFAIK) ties its boot mode (BIOS vs. EFI) to its partition table type (MBR to GPT). Thus, switching from MBR to GPT will necessitate converting Windows to boot in EFI mode rather than in BIOS mode. This adds complexity to the task -- too much to describe here, in fact. For more information, see this article. I don't recommend trying this unless you're desperate, although it really is the better solution in many ways.\nIt is sometimes possible to \"fudge\" things using MBR to get just under 4TiB out of it. To do this, you must assign everything above the 2TiB mark to one partition. In your case, if you're using MBR and the existing partition(s) consume up to the maximum point, you can shrink the final partition on the disk by a small amount (1MiB is the smallest that's practical in many new tools). You can then create the final partition such that it begins before the 2TiB mark and extends to the end of the disk (or for a size of 2TiB, if that's smaller). Note that if you want to use multiple partitions in Linux, you'll need to put all but the last of them entirely under the 2TiB mark, so you may need to shrink your final existing partition by significantly more than 1MiB. Also, be aware that this method is playing a bit \"fast and loose.\" It's technically legal, given the way the MBR data structures are designed, but some OSes flake out with it. AFAIK, both Linux and recent versions of Windows work with it, but if you need to use the disk with something more exotic, it might behave strangely.\nIf it turns out you're already using EFI-mode booting and GPT, then the error message you received represents a bug. I'm not sure how you'd get around it, but shrinking the final existing partition, as in the MBR solution, might conceivably work. Beyond that, filing a bug report is in order.\n\nA: You should use smaller partitions that do not exceed 2TB each. This is because MBR can address exactly as you write 4294967295 of 512 byte blocks in a single partition, which is little more that 2TB.\nAlternatively, you can use GPT partition table instead of MBR, but in case you plan to use Windows 7, UEFI is a requirement (Windows 8 and Linux do not have such a limitation).\n\nA: I had the exact same problem and could solve it by using the Ubuntu live option and typing \"sudo gparted\" in the shell (Strg+Alt+T) and then just setting the flag of the Ubuntu partition to boot (right click on the Ubuntu partition and setting the marker to \"manage flags\"), since the Windows partitions flag was set to boot until then. After a reboot everything was as it used to be.\n", "Q: Chrome Popup Malware \"openadserving.com\"?

Is there some tool I can run to detect the virus?  Or can I totally reinstall Chrome somehow?\n\nA: You haven't provided sufficient information to identify the problem accurately, but the following suggestions may help to identify or even hopefully solve it:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can open your hosts file (enter this command in terminal: gksu gedit /etc/hosts) and enter this line at the bottom: 127.0.0.1    www.openadserving.com As this will prevent all connection between this site and your computer after restart, this might solve your problem or if it doesn't, then;\n\n*You can try a program like Net Activity Viewer to see a list of sites your browser is being connected, and add all undesirable addresses there as in the step 1.\n\n*You can try using a utility like hostsblock to prevent connection to such sites in general.

I'm running Xfce on top of Debian (sorry Ubuntu fans) and am having similar trouble. I have a .desktop file in ~/.config/autostart to invoke xmodmap and this works, but the effect only lasts about 23 seconds (timed it) after which point the custom key mappings are lost. I've suspected this is a problem with Xfce overriding the key mappings and am curious if you're using xubuntu. Even if I enter the xmodmap command in a terminal just after login, it will be forgotten after about 20 seconds. However, if I wait a little while and then enter the command it is permanent (mostly, see notes about suspend below). Adding a sleep to my autostart invocation has the same effect. My ~/.config/autostart/xmodmap.desktop file currently looks like this:\n[Desktop Entry]\nEncoding=UTF-8\nVersion=0.9.4\nType=Application\nName=xmodmap\nComment=custom key mappings\nExec=bash -c \"sleep 30;xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap\"\nStartupNotify=false\nTerminal=true\nHidden=false\n\nI've set the terminal to show so I can see what's happening. This is a terrible work-around since I have to wait 30 seconds before my key map will take effect and when it does, the pc basically freezes for about 6 seconds while xmodmap processes the input file. This is acceptable (I suppose) at startup but not when I'm already in the middle of things.\nI can also confirm the suspend behavior. Using the above .desktop file I get my key mappings, but upon waking up from suspend they're forgotten. Bummer, but I don't use suspend often anyway so this is a limitation I could accept.\n\nA: I'd got the same problem with ubuntu 12.10. \nI just find one solution for me, witch is to use complete .Xmodmap filename :\nxmodmap /home/USER/.Xmodmap\nand not :\nxmodmap ~/.Xmodmap\n\nI put the command in the startup applications. Maybe this works also in .xinitrc. I do not test. \n", "Q: Grub won't find Windows 7 partition I have a customized Sony Vaio S with default Windows 7 64-bit and manually installed Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit installed on it.\nI use Grub as boot manager and initially it worked, booting both Windows 7 and Ubuntu.\nAfter some updates on Ubuntu it broke Grub and I reinstalled it.\nNow it won't let me boot into Win7, apparently there are some issues with EFI.\nblkid gives me the following:\n/dev/sda1: LABEL=\"SONYSYS\" UUID=\"72D1-8783\" TYPE=\"vfat\" \n/dev/sda2: LABEL=\"Recovery\" UUID=\"6E62E06762E0360D\" TYPE=\"ntfs\" \n/dev/sda3: LABEL=\"boot\" UUID=\"5CF7-3AEE\" TYPE=\"vfat\" \n/dev/sda5: LABEL=\"Win7\" UUID=\"BEDC4BEFDC4BA10F\" TYPE=\"ntfs\" \n/dev/sda6: UUID=\"aaff8b62-cffe-4e3c-a539-f57e36f293f8\" TYPE=\"ext4\" \n/dev/sda7: UUID=\"a26bdd92-07e5-41ed-b7cf-79dfcb89560c\" TYPE=\"ext4\" \n/dev/sda10: UUID=\"20565c91-c106-4761-914c-b1c33ed07d1f\" TYPE=\"ext4\" \n/dev/mapper/cryptswap1: UUID=\"f29a5cfc-c098-4308-bada-a519c404d0d4\" TYPE=\"swap\"\n\nsda10 and sda6 are my root and home directory, respectively.\nBoot-Repair gives the following output: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1665681\nThe first Win7 enty in GRUB from 30_os-prober Windows Recovery Environment (loader) (on /dev/sda5) (fixed by Boot-Repair) gives the following error:\n\nerror: unknown command 'drivemap'.\n  error: invalid EFI file path.\n\nThe other ones from 40_Custom Windows 7/Windows 7 Alter/etc.:\nBlack screen and a white rectangle. After a few seconds returning to GRUB.\nI tried using rEFInd to boot into Win7, without success. When i click on the Win7 button, it returns to GRUB.\nAre there any solutions apart from reinstalling Win7? \nSorry for the messy grubfiles, I tried several ways to boot Win7.\n\nA: It looks like you've got an EFI-mode Windows installation, a (probably damaged) EFI-mode GRUB installation, and a BIOS-mode GRUB installation. My guess is that you installed Ubuntu in EFI mode and somewhere along the line the package system decided to install the BIOS-mode GRUB, which damaged your EFI-mode GRUB installation and led to the problems. The Boot Repair tool has made matters worse by unnecessarily renaming and copying files, which is what's causing rEFInd's failure to launch Windows -- Boot Repair has moved the Windows boot loader to a non-standard filename (probably either bootmgfw.efi.old or bootmgfw.efi_backup) and has placed GRUB where the Windows boot loader normally resides (bootmgfw.efi).\nIf rEFInd lets you get into Linux, then the solution is pretty simple: In Linux, type the following command:\nsudo cp /boot/efi/EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi.old /boot/efi/EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi\n\nThis will copy what's probably the original Microsoft boot loader back to its proper name. You should then be able to launch both Windows and Linux from rEFInd. If that doesn't work, try the same thing, but copy bootmgfw.efi_backup rather than bootmgfw.efi.old.\nIf rEFInd is not launching Ubuntu correctly, but is itself launching, then the above should still work to get Windows working, but you'll need to do it from an emergency disc, so the path to the files may be different. You'll need to provide more details about what happens with each of the rEFInd options for me to diagnose that problem.\nThere's almost certainly a way to get GRUB working instead of rEFInd, if you prefer to do that, but this will involve more diagnostics and a way to boot in EFI mode. (Your Ubuntu installation CD can do this if you can't get into your main Ubuntu installation, but forcing it to do so can be tricky if you don't already know how to do it on your system.)\n", "Q: How to get speakers working in 10.04, when they are silent at any volume?

My mount options are\nnosuid,nodev,nofail,x-gvfs-show,nobootwait,uid=1000,gid=1002,fmask=113,dmask=002\n\nThis gives me write access but when other users try to delete a file the error message pops up\nCannot move file to trash, do you want to delete immediately? \n\nAs I understand this is because they don't have write access which is what I want to change.\nI created a new group (with gid=1002) and assigned it as primary group to both user accounts but that didn't help. I also tried mounting without the fmask, dmask and uid options.\n\nA: \nAs I understand this is because they don't have write access which is what I want to change.\n\nNo, this error message does not mean that they don't have write access. If they didn't have write access, you would not be able to right click and \"Move to Trash\" or \"Delete\" a file, or use the Del keyboard button. But since you're getting this error, it means that the users do have access.\nAfter two hours of search, and reproducing this error on my computer, here's what I found out.\nExplanation\nPermissions (owner, group owner, file and directory permissions) are set at the time of mounting. Only the owner can move files to trash. Why? Because when you move files to trash in an NTFS partition, a folder called .Trash-<uid> is created in the root directory of the partition, where <uid> is the uid of the user, and the folder's owner will be the user that's trying to delete. For example, if the username is daniels and the uid is 1000, a folder called .Trash-1000 is created, and daniels would be the owner.\nSo, if daniels is the owner of the partition, he'll be able to do this normally. However, if another user (let's say called alaa, and uid=1001) tries to delete something, the system tries to create a .Trash-1001 folder, with the owner alaa. But, on NTFS, the permissions are set at the time of mounting (example: it was set to daniels), and the \"owner\" of any file cannot be changed, and so the system fails to create the .Trash-1001 folder, giving you the prompt Cannot move file to trash, do you want to delete immediately?.\nTo test this, try manually creating a folder in the root directory of the partition named .Trash-1001 (the owner will be set to the owner of the partition). You'll find that hitting Del on the keyboard on any file/folder will not do anything, and the option when you right click an item will change from Move to Trash to Delete. I can't explain why it changes to Delete, but this is just to identify that the problem is indeed in the .Trash-1001 folder.\nIn my opinion, I classify this as a bug.\nSolution (soft of...)\nRemove all of your uid=, gid=, dmask=, fmask=, and umask= options from your mount command, and add permissions, so I guess your line should be like this:\nnosuid,nodev,nofail,x-gvfs-show,nobootwait,permissions\n\nI've tried this on my computer, and it works; both users can move to trash when using the NTFS hard disk.\nHere's a demonstration:\n\nalaa@aa-lu:~$ sudo mount -o rw,permissions /dev/sdc2 /media/he\nUsing default user mapping\nalaa@aa-lu:~$ ls /media/he -la\ntotal 104\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  8192 Sep 24 21:20 .\ndrwxr-xr-x 6 root root  4096 Sep 24 21:18 ..\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  4096 Dec 15  2012 Files on my hard disk\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  4096 Jul  9 12:18 $RECYCLE.BIN\ndrwx------ 1 root root     0 Jan 22  2012 System Volume Information\n\nThen I went and deleted something using my username alaa, then logged in as another user aaa and deleted something too. Both of them could delete, and this is how the NTFS partition looks like:\n\nalaa@aa-lu:~$ ls /media/he -la\ntotal 104\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  8192 Sep 24 21:20 .\ndrwxr-xr-x 6 root root  4096 Sep 24 21:18 ..\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  4096 Dec 15  2012 Files on my hard disk\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  4096 Jul  9 12:18 $RECYCLE.BIN\ndrwx------ 1 root root     0 Jan 22  2012 System Volume Information\ndrwx------ 1 alaa alaa     0 Sep 24 21:20 .Trash-1000\ndrwx------ 1 aaa  aaa      0 Sep 24 21:19 .Trash-1002\n\nI don't know how it manages to do that, but it just does.\nI found this page: Ownership and Permissions | Tuxera that explains this, as well as a forum post (http://www.tuxera.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=27540) that has some useful information. However, unfortunately I haven't read them yet, so I can't explain exactly what this permissions option does.\nI said \"Solution (sort of...)\" in the title of this section because now you're not controlling who is the owner of the partition, not group owner, nor the read-write permissions. But, when mounting with the permissions option, you can see a \"Using default user mapping\", so as far as I understood, there's a \"user mapping\" thing that can be created to be used with permissions, and that mapping will have the owner/permissions that we want to set. I also have not tried mounting using permissions along with uid= and all those other options (the Tuxera link I posted should explain that though), but that might also work, by controlling owner/permissions and at the same time give access to Trash.\nWhen I read those links, I'll update my answer.\n\nA: Try adding this to your fstab:\nUUID=<YourPartitionUUID>  <YourMountPoint>  ntfs-3g  defaults,uid=1000,gid=46,utf8,dmask=000,fmask=111  0  0\n\n(If you don't have ntfs-3g installed, you can either try installing it or try using just ntfs.)\n\nA: Thanks to Alaa Ali, added the remount and it worked fine for me\nsudo ntfsfix /dev/sdd2 to fix the Windows Not fully Shutdown\nsudo mount -o rw,permissions,remount /dev/sdd2 /home/disk1\n", "Q: Why has networking for my 12.04 setup stopped working?

Used the attach/detach method to instal. I detached disk2 (Ubuntu Drive) then installed Windows 7 on disk1. Then I disconnected disk1, connected disk2 and installed Ubuntu. I read this was a good way to do it as it will prevent Grub2 from overwriting the Windows bootloader.\nNot both disk1 and disk2 are hooked up and I can now boot into each OS successfully by selecting the various disk at BIOS level. I would like to skip the BIOS and auto boot into Ubuntu then use Grub2 to select if I want to boot into Windows 7.\nGrub2 is not working for me and I was thinking about using Boot Repair to repair Grub2 from a LiveUSB. My worry though, is that if I run Boot Repair, it will overwrite my windows bootloader? Should I run Boot Repair with my windows drive unhooked?\nWhat are your thoughts to get Grub2 working without touching disk2?\n\nA: If you connect both disk1 (Win7) and disk2 (Ubuntu) and set your BIOS to boot first disk2 (i.e. Ubuntu), you should be able to update grub2, which is on disk2, without overwriting Win7 bootloader, which is on disk1, and have Win7 included in the grub menu by entering this command in terminal: sudo update-grub\nIf you want to be on the safe side, you can have your Win7 installation CD ready or a recovery CD created in Windows to easily restore Win7 bootloader any time when it gets overwritten accidentally (e.g. if you attempt to install grub2 by mistake to Win7 disk).\n\nA: \nMy worry though, is that if I run Boot Repair, it will overwrite my\n  windows bootloader?\n\nNo. Boot-Repair cannot overwrite the Windows bootloader. It can only install GRUB bootloader which will call the Windows bootloader.\n\nShould I run Boot Repair with my windows drive unhooked?\n\nYes, you can do it, but then you will have to set up your BIOS so that it boots your Ubuntu disk first.\n", "Q: Location of Ubuntu HP Printer Driver I saw a on the HP website that they have printer drivers for Ubuntu machines.  I have tried to find a driver for my HP printer and I have not had much success.  Can anyone point me to where I could download the 32-bit x86 Ubuntu 12.04 driver for a HP C4200 printer?\n\nA: Connect the printer to your Ubuntu computer and it will automatically work\nThis is because 12.04+ already comes with the latest version of all HP printing and scanning drivers for Ubuntu (The hiplip-gui  package). Just plug the Printer to the computer, turn it on and done. You can access the printer by opening the Dash and typing Printers.\nAdditionally I have a HP Photosmart C3100 and a Photosmart C4200 (The C4250 model just in case) and even if you go to the HP website, after selecting in their menu your model, you will be greeted with this:\n\nWhich just means that Ubuntu supports your Printer out of the box.

Here is the update, and the key information from the link:\n\nI tried to use the jockey or Additional Drivers as it was\n  once called, to update my Nvidia driver, rendering my system somewhat\n  useless. I had to manually update my driver with the following\n  guide:\n\nRather than having to do this after your machine ends up with a half-working desktop, you can do this before any damage is caused. Hint, if you've already botched, then press Ctrl+Alt+F1 to reach the first virtual console. Log in there, then follow the instructions.\nIn the past, running apt-get install build-essential was enough. This would get all the relevant stuff, including the kernel sources and kernel headers. Now, you must specify these separately.\nsudo apt-get install build-essential linux-source linux-headers\n\nIf the transitional package linux-headers is not available, instead, please try running the command by specifying the exact version of the headers with:\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)\n\nAnd this should work. Next, install the current Nvidia driver:\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current\n\nIf you skipped the part where you install the sources, headers and the rest, you will get an error here, so, go back and install them correctly...\nOnce the installation completes successfully, check if the Nvidia driver is loaded:\nsudo /sbin/lsmod | grep nvidia\n\nIf it's not, you will need to manually insert into memory. First, make sure all kernel module dependencies are satisfied and resolved:\nsudo depmod -a\n\nThen, load the driver:\nsudo modprobe nvidia_current\n\nThis should succeed and the lsmod command should show it's loaded, but the usage count will probably be 0, because nothing will be using it yet. You will need to restart the graphics environment to actually benefit from the driver:\nsudo /etc/init.d/lightdm restart\n\nThis will restart the graphics environment, you will see the Nvidia splash, and you will load into a desktop that has the nvidia driver running, and all that. Your problem is now resolved. The skeptics among you can reboot to verify.\n\n\n\nA: I believe you tried to update proprietary driver.\nSo, you can remove proprietary drivers (return to free nouveau).\nTry this terminal commands:\nsudo stop lightdm\nsudo apt-get purge nvidia*\nsudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-nouveau\nsudo reboot\n\nNow, you should have all working with free drivers. You can try to install proprietary driver again.\n\nA: I know that AMD drivers need the linux-headers-generic package to work, and I suspect that the issue might be the same with nvidia.\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic\n\nAnd then try to install the driver.\n", "Q: How to change from Legacy boot to UEFI boot? SO, I have been trying to get ubuntu linux on my windows 8 pre-installed VAIO laptop. The USB stick containing the ubuntu boot wasn't working right, so I went into the BIOS and changed UEFI boot to legacy. Now when I turn on my computer with the USB, it displays, \"SYSLINUX 4.04 EDD 2011-04-18 COPYRIGHT (C) 1994-2011 H. PETER ANVIL et al\". Without the USB, it just says that there is no operating system, and Windows 8 doesn't boot. I am worried that I broke my computer. Can anyone tell me how to change back to UEFI so that Windows 8 will boot, or even how to get the Linux Ubuntu USB to boot right? Thanks.\n1 second ago - 4 days left to answer.\n\nA: Take the hard drive out of your laptop.  This should allow you to get into the UEFI.  If that does not work, the instructions (take from the VAIO User Guide) to get into the UEFI are as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press the ASSIST button while your VAIO computer is off.\nThe VAIO Care Rescue Mode screen appears.\n\n*Select Start BIOS setup.\nEnter a password if it has already been set.\nThe BIOS setup screen appears.\n\n\nNow, you should be able to change back to UEFI from Legacy boot.  As far as the second part of your question, this should help you in doing what you need to do.  To make this answer more complete, I will add that guide here:\nIf you want Ubuntu on the same disk as Windows 8.1, here are the steps to go through:\n1) Turn off Windows Fast Boot\n2) You need to shrink the main Windows 8.1 partition.  This can be tricky, as Windows expects a certain partition scheme to be used.  Let me show you a diagram:\n[(Windows RE Tools)(EFI System Partition)(Microsoft Reserved Partition)(Windows 8.1)(Anything else)]\nYou can use your favorite tool to edit these partitions.  I prefer Gparted, but any good disk partitioning tool can handle this.  Backup your Windows install first.  Then, resize the Windows 8.1 partition so that you have enough space for another OS.  I prefer to give my Linux installs about 50-100 GB of space (for expandability).\n3)  Download your Ubuntu (use 64 bit only and I suggest 13.10) iso and put it on some media (CD/DVD/USB/(insert your preferred media here)) by using your favorite tool (most people prefer Rufus) or dd.\n4) Shut off Secure Boot and Fast Boot in the UEFI.  DO NOT TURN ON LEGACY BOOTING (if your motherboard supports UEFI only booting without Secure Boot and Fast Boot on.)\n5) Insert your install media and install Ubuntu in the partition you made earlier.  Make sure that for your EFI boot partition, you make the installer use the EFI System Partition already created by Windows 8.1.  The partition should be something like sdXn (replace X with the drive it is on and n with the partition number, such as /dev/sda2), but this could be different.  DO NOT REFORMAT THIS PARTITION!!  You are only going to tell the installer to use it as the EFI partition.  It will put the grubx64.efi bootloader for Ubuntu in this location.  \n6) With that done, continue the install as normal and set up your partitions as you see fit.  Once the install is finished, you should be able to boot into Jessie easily.  \nIf you are trying to fix an existing install of Ubuntu, you will need to do:\nsudo apt-get install grub-efi-amd64\nsudo modprobe efivars\nsudo grub-install /dev/sdx (x being the drive Ubuntu is installed on)\nsudo update-grub\nFrom there, the UEFI should use Grub-EFI as the bootloader. I have not found a way to get the Windows 8 bootloader to see and allow Linux to boot in UEFI.  YYMV.\n\nA: You can change Legacy back to UEFI in Bios (as you changed UEFI to Legacy).\nBtw, did you tried to wait, when \n\nSYSLINUX 4.04 EDD 2011-04-18 COPYRIGHT (C) 1994-2011 H. PETER ANVIL et al\n\nappeared?\n\nA: Go back into your firmware (what you called \"BIOS\") settings and change back whatever you altered. Assuming you didn't delete your Windows boot loader, that should get the computer booting to Windows again. If it doesn't, you need to be more precise about what you've done; I'm afraid your description isn't very clear. For instance, did you actually do an Ubuntu installation, or does the installer hang after displaying the SYSLINUX message?\n\nA: Do you have (ASSIST) button on your laptop left of power key..if you do when computer off keep assist press till you see bios hope this helps\n\nA: Windows 7 on UEFI requires that the disk partitions use GUID partition table (GPT) rather than the traditional MBR partitioning format found on BIOS systems. Unfortunately, windows provides no way of converting an MBR partition to a GPT one non-destructively. However, if you don't mind copying data off your drive, converting, then copying it back then you could use windows to do it as described here.\nIf you don't want to backup the data first and have access to a a linux machine that you can install the drive in, there are tools in linux that will allow you to convert the partition type non-destructively as described here. If you don't have a linux box handy, you can also try creating a linux boot CD and booting from that.\nSearhing for \"convert MBR to GPT\" brings up other tools, but I have never tried them\n\nA: Just hold the Assist button and keep pressing F2.\n\nA: Though it may be different for each computer manufacturer, MY Toshiba bios can be accessed using the following method:\nWith computer COMPLETELY powered off, press the power button, then immediately begin pressing the F12 key, over and over until your Boot Menu appears, offering which device you want to boot from. From there it should have an option to open Setup, which will be your bios settings.\n", "Q: Windows 'like' Start Menu Is there any Start Menu (that I can use along with Gnome 3) that looks like traditional Windows Start Menu? If so, It's also possible to see all open applications on the \"Taskbar\"?\n\nA: For Gnome3 I believe the closest thing to what you want would be the applications menu extension. You can install it directly from the website.\nIf you like traditional DE interfaces, I think you'll like cinnamon. Its menu is the closest thing to a Windows like start menu. Here's how it looks. \nTo install press Ctrl + Alt + T. Inside the terminal run\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:gwendal-lebihan-dev/cinnamon-stable\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install cinnamon\n\nat login select Cinnamon instead of Unity. \n", "Q: How to run Windows Steam games from Linux Steam (with WINE)? I am currently using 2 versions of steam, the Linux one for games compatible with Linux, and the windows version in wine for games which are not compatible. I was wondering if it is possible to get wine to work on games in Linux steam (the one not using wine) , so I do not have to switch back and forth between the two steams.\n\nA: So, I know this is an old question, but there seems to be a way to do this. Sort of.\nEDIT: So, having downloaded 1 game, it doesn't seem to be working. Launching the game does nothing. No errors.. just nada. So, YMMV.\nIt involves, tricking the client into thinking it can be installed by creating an appmanifest in the right folder. Luckily, since Steam is put together well and is tolerant of errors, you can just copy some other manifest, change a few fields, and it will automatically fix the file and start downloading the game.\nFor future reference in case the link breaks:\n\n\n*\n\n*Right-click on your desired game in Steam. Click \"Create Desktop Shortcut\".\n\n*Open the shortcut up as text and locate the gameid. It will be on the Exec line. For example, \"Exec=steam steam://rungameid/204880\" means the gameid is 204880. (Bonus points for finding which game this is! :P)\n\n*Now we make a new manifest. (Oh, and if you have Steam open still, you can go ahead and close it.) Most likely, you'll go to ~/.local/share/Steam/SteamApps/. There will be several \"appmanifest_xxxxxx.acf files (of variable length). These represent your installed games. Pick one (so far, it seems any one will work). Copy it and save it as appmanifest_gameid.acf (obviously replacing gameid with what it was). Now open it up and change the appID, GameID, name, and second name fields. Save it.\n\n*Re-open Steam.\n\n*??? (Steam corrects our wrong file. Although, I've noticed some of the old properties remain which may come back to bite me/you/us.)\n\n*Profit! (it starts downloading)\nAnd, as of writing, this is as far as I've gotten. My game is still downloading and I thought I'd share as I stumbled across this QA when I was looking for the same answer :)\n\nA: Choose “Add a Game...” > “Add a Non-Steam Game”.\nSearch for the game in the provided list. If you find it, add it and you're done.\nIf you don't find it, create a .desktop file where Exec=wine /path/to/game/exe and put it into /usr/share/applications.\nClose and reopen the add game window. You should now find the game in the list.\n\nA: You could create a very short script to launch the game (See: https://www.winehq.org/docs/wineusr-guide/running ) and then create an entry in your steam library using \"Add a Non-Steam Game\" that points to the script. This will mean that you will have the game in your list of games on the linux client.\nHowever the windows Steam client will still have to load to run the game. I believe it's possible (maybe not at the time of the question original being asked though) for it to be loaded in some kind of minimal by default mode that will only show the system tray icon.\n\nA: You can use your wine prefix with proton (GE for example). For that you need in proton folder (/home/nicourrrn/.steam/steam/compatibilitytools.d/GE-Proton7-43/files/share for 7.43 version) replace or remove default_pfx and take on that place symbol link on your wineprefix (ln -s ~./wine as default)\nP.S. Sorry about my English.\n", "Q: Multiple issues; Kernel panic, Random Crashing, Unable to install/ remove programs So i have been having issues pretty much since installation.\nI have 12.10 installed on an HP Pavillion DV6000.\nIt goes into Kernel Panic (i think) almost every time i interact with the Dash, and sometimes when i interact with the launcher.\ni cannot install or remove programs, it once popped a message up saying that something was broken, the program index or something, and gave me a line of code to run in the launcher to \"fix it at first\", but i couldnt copy it, and when i went to manually type it in the terminal, it disappeared...\nalso, it crashes whenever it feels like. \nand sometimes it takes 3-4 start ups to get it to actually run when i turn it on, which is quite frustrating because the battery can only keep this thing running for about 5 minutes once its unplugged. \nThis computer is driving me insane! I can barely do anything with it, and i'm too broke to buy a new computer.\nsomebody, please, help me.. \n\nA: Wow, I am pretty sure the problem is not Ubuntu and might be something worse. I had an HP DV6000 (Sold the laptop about a month back) and that puppy was running fine with 12.10.\nThe problem I encountered with that laptop (Just in case I had the one with the Intel video card) is that, since it was pretty old by now, the same issue you mentioned happened to me but on Ubuntu 11.10, at the end it was not Ubuntu but the cables that connect from the Power button to the Quick buttons and the hard drive. \nIt is basically a ribbon that connects that, that somehow fails \"sometimes\" and \"sometimes\" doesn't. If you happen to hold pressure on top of the left part of the keyboard or nearby or above the touchpad and suddenly it does not work or it does work and does not fail, then it is the ribbon.\nThis is the quickest one I found: http://www.ebay.com/itm/HP-DV6000-DV9000-KOTL-E220709-AWM-20798-80C-60V-RIBBON-SWITCH-CABLE-POWER-BUTTON-/400313605577?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item5d348cddc9 (Was looking in Amazon but that place sucks in having a better advanced filter). To change it there are steps to do that and is not hard. Will take you if it is the first time you work on the laptop between 15 to 20 minutes.\nI would suggest to actually remove the 2 ribbons it has right now and change both for the new ones.\nThe battery is another problem since the original one will start failing (At least failing to charge) after 2-3 years. I bought a newer, bigger one before selling it. but when I sold the laptop I included the older one but warned the buyer that it would only last about 10 to 15 \"Real\" minutes. I say real since Windows or Ubuntu will say an hour.\nI am sorry to give you such bad news about this, at least you have the solution which I had to live with for about 5 months until giving up and trying to solve the problem myself (In my country it is tough to find a way to fix this laptop and they were charging me about 200$ for something that actually costs 50$ including labor). For you it will cost less than 10$ since with that you can buy the 2 cables. I even saw one guy selling 4 of them for 10$.\nHope you solve the problem with this since I know how it feels. That laptop is the best one I have had so far.\n\nA: That sounds more like either a failing hard drive than anything else. One way to check would be to use an Ubuntu LiveCD, and if that behaves normally, then it is most likely the hard drive. Using a LiveCD means that the hard drive is not being accessed, which takes that piece of hardware out of the equation.\nAnother thing that makes me suspect the Hard Drive is that laptop hard drives generally do not (in my pretty comprehensive, though anecdotal) experience last a very long time, and yours is right about the age where they would start failing.\nTry the liveCD, if that works fine then you may want to look at backing up as much as you can before replacing the HDD.\nOtherwise it is probably some other hardware fault which requires a more indepth diagnosis.\n", "Q: Trying to start nginx on VPS, I get \"nginx: unrecognized service\" Following the How to install rails and nginx with passenger on Ubuntu tutorial from DigitalOcean.com, the seventh step manually starts nginx: \nsudo service nginx start\n\nbut fails with the following error:\nnginx: unrecognized service\n\n\nA: The nginx: unrecognized service error means the startup scripts need to be created.\nFortunately the startup scripts have already been written. \nWe can fetch them with wget and set them up following these steps:\n# Download nginx startup script\nwget -O init-deb.sh https://www.linode.com/docs/assets/660-init-deb.sh\n\n# Move the script to the init.d directory & make executable\nsudo mv init-deb.sh /etc/init.d/nginx\nsudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/nginx\n\n# Add nginx to the system startup\nsudo /usr/sbin/update-rc.d -f nginx defaults\n\nNow we can control nginx using:\nsudo service nginx stop \nsudo service nginx start \nsudo service nginx restart\nsudo service nginx reload\n\n\nA: It can also mean that the permissions are wrong on the init script, e.g. you do not have the execute bit set\n\nA: for me I was running vagrant to setup nginx and forgot to put in the -y so the nginx install had not completed.

When I click on the wiFi network button on the top bar it does not display any networks at all but I know there are at least 3 in my area. I don't know how old the iMac is.\n\nA: I have 12.04, but my guess is there is a similar solution.  If you have just installed Ubuntu and nothing else, it probably does not have the wifi drivers for your card pre-installed.  You will need to plug it in to an ethernet connection (for which it should have drivers) and then download the correct wifi driver that you need.  The recent versions of ubuntu, such as yours, should - probably - automatically download the correct wifi software...and then you can restart with the machine unplugged from ethernet and the wifi should work.  I say should...I had to do some tweaks to get it running and others have had to download and install the correct drivers \"manually\".\nIf you can't get the drivers installed or something else goes wrong, there are a LOT of questions on this board with solutions to wifi problems - do a search and read up.\n", "Q: I can't install LibreOffice Base into Ubuntu 12.04 I am running Ubuntu 12.04 on my USB.

There is no partition in my hard drive that I can find at this point, but when I go to re-install Ubuntu it says that I already have 2 OSes installed, and I can't use the normal install alongside option. Is there anything I am missing that is making it think there is something left?\n\nA: Windows can’t read Ubuntu partition, so you can’t see it on Windows. When you have 2 OS’s there should be an Erase Ubuntu ... and reinstall option with warning. It’s exactly what you need.\n\nI mean the second option in this screenshot.\nAlternative\nYou can alternatively select Something else which shows you all your partitions, then:\n\n\n*\n\n*be careful and don’t do what you’re not sure about;\n\n*select the Ubuntu partition, on which it’s currently installed;\n\n*click on change/edit button [I can’t remember the word];\n\n*set the type as ex4, check for format, and set / as the mount point.\nThat’s it. This will format your current Ubuntu partition and reinstall everything again.\n\nA: You need to use a partition tool to find out how many and which partitions you have. With Windows 7 you will probably have 2 (1 for system and the other for Windows itself). \nPartition tools can be Computer Management tool on Windows 7, or Gparted Live iso for example.\nAfter seeing the partitions you should create the partitions where you want to install Ubuntu.\n\nA: Open Computer Management by clicking the Start button , clicking Control Panel, clicking System and Maintenance, clicking Administrative Tools, and then double-clicking Computer Management.   If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.\nIn the Navigation pane, under Storage, click Disk Management.\nThere you can see all your partitions and you can delete/format it including the Linux partitions.\nBest Advice : Delete the Linux Partition and then extend your Windows partition(by right clicking on the Windows partition).\nBoot up Ubuntu and select the option install Ubuntu alongside with Windows. Then you will get a slider to allocate required space for Ubuntu partition. This will make installation much more easier\n\nA: I screwed up my first install of ubuntu and decided to start over. I just went into the Windows control panel, add/remove programs, and uninstalled ubuntu. ubuntu went away completely, even in the boot options on the machine, and I re-did the install successfully.\n\nA: Use the Live-CD or Live-USB, choose Try Ubuntu. Then use the installer, and when you see the options 'Install inside Windows', 'Re-Install Ubuntu', etc, there should be an option 'Something Else'. In that option you should see all the partitions in your Hard Drive.\nAnother thing you can do to see the partitions is, once in the Live version, open the terminal (ctrl+alt+t) and use:\nsudo -s\nfdisk -l\n\nThe /dev/sda corresponds to the hard drive, and the /dev/sdaX (where X is a number) represents different partitions.\nI guess you don't see the Ubuntu partitions in Windows because they're in a diferent file system (ext2, ext3 or ext4) and Windows recognizes only FAT16 FAT32 and NTFS file systems.\nAnyway, in case there are or not Ubuntu partitions, use the 'Somthing else' option to format the existing Ubuntu partitions, or create them if they don't exist.\nPS: the Ubuntu version I used is 12.10, maybe other versions don't have this option in the installer...\n", "Q: Configure vsftpd to chown uploaded files I have vsftpd up and running on my Ubuntu server. This is a development server and I want to be able to FTP my code directly to the directory which Apache is serving out.\nAs most of you know, www-data is the Apache user and the www-data user needs to have permissions to the directory that Apache is serving out.\nI didn't want to make www-data an FTP user as well, so what I did instead was create another user for use with FTP, and put both www-data and the new user in a new group called www.\nI did a chown -R www-data:www * to the directory that Apache is serving and it works mostly fine.\nThe issue comes in when I FTP upload a file that didn't previously exist in that directory. The owner gets set to my FTP user. I want the owner to get set to www-data and the group to get set to www whenever a new file gets uploaded.\nIs there any way to do this with vsftpd? \nI've been furiously googling around for hours, but I can't find a way to do it. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\nEdit:\nI just set up a couple of cron jobs to run every minute and set the permissions:\n*/1 * * * * chown -R www-data:www /var/www\n*/1 * * * * chmod -R g+rw /var/www\nIt works but it's kind of clunky, and there's a ~1 minute delay between me uploading new code and having it work when I hit F5 in my browser.\n\nA: Read man 2 chmod, especially the part that says:\n   S_ISGID  (02000)  set-group-ID (set process effective group ID on execve(2); mandatory locking, as described in  fcntl(2);  take  a\n                     new file's group from parent directory, as described in chown(2) and mkdir(2))\n\nYou could probably use this to make all files created in the directory in the www group, and change your web server's umask value to 022 \nTo do this safely, read and reread man 2 chmod, man 2 open, man 2 stat and anything pointed to in the See Also: sections.

Is it due to 2 OS's? I have been running Ubuntu 12.10 in it's own partition for dual-boot with Windows 7 for a week now.\nWould running Ubuntu like this make it run slower? Would it be faster if I installed Ubuntu over Windows 7 and have it as my only OS?\nWhat's running slow? Opening a video file in vlc player (800MB/4GB file) takes at least 3 seconds. Extracting files takes much longer than doing with winrar in Windows. \nMy laptop has an i3 with 4GB RAM.\nThanks for your time.\n(currently I'm still deciding between the 2 OS's)\n\nA: Dual booting Ubuntu with Windows does not make Ubuntu run any slower, so installing Ubuntu over Windows 7 would not make it run faster (at least not appreciably faster). If Ubuntu was running inside Windows in a VM or wubi, it would run slower because your processor would have to tell Windows 7 what to tell Ubuntu, and Ubuntu would have to tell Windows 7 what to tell your processor. It's like trying to have a conversation with someone through another person - it's going to take longer.\nSince you have Ubuntu running in its own partition though, it is talking directly to your processor without going through Windows.\n", "Q: Help me please, install problems on ACER aspire 5515 So, I have an ACER Aspire 5515 with Windows 7 Ultimate installed. I have an AMD Athlon(tm) Processor 2650e 1.60 GHz processor. 1 GB RAM, with a 160 GB HDD.\nSo here's what I did:\nI parititioned my hard drive. I have three partitions: a 10 GB hidden partition (for my bios), a 69.5 GB C:/ partition (holds my windows OS), and finally, a 69.5 GB partition that I used to install Ubuntu 12.10. I burned the .iso to a disc, and I formatted the third partition to a ext journaled 4 with the ubuntu install disc, and then I installed Ubuntu on the third partition. Then it took me to a reboot, and rebooted into Windows normally. I have no idea what to do from here, I mean, it seemed like the install process went normal. Any ideas? Help? Instructions?\n\nA: The OS needs four partitions: boot, root, home and swap. You should do the partitioning from within the installer.\nFollow this guide: page 1 and page 2\n", "Q: Why won't Ubuntu use the memory I have left on my PC? I recently installed Ubuntu on my PC. When I tried installing a Valve game on Ubuntu, it said that I only have 2000 megabytes of memory left on my PC. \nWhen I switched back to Windows 7, it said that I have another 500 gigabytes of memory left.\nI would really appreciate it if someone could find me an answer to this problem.\n\nA: Likely because Ubuntu and Windows are each in their own partition. Your Windows partition has 500GB free, your Linux partition has 2GB free. If you want more space on your Linux partition then you are going to need to shrink down your Windows partition using a partition manager like gparted and reassign that space to your Linux partition.\n", "Q: I can't remember my password My computer goes on standby every 5 minutes and will then request an authentication password; I can't remember setting any password, so I will have to restart the computer again before I can use it. A similar problem occurs whenever I want to upgrade or download software; it keeps asking for authentication password and will not allow me to make any updates. I never set up any authentication password.\n\nA: When you installed Ubuntu, it usually asks for a User name and a password, a fairly strong password without which it does not proceed ahead with the installation. The system is asking for this password. If you don't remember what the password was, follow the steps given in the answers of this question. There are multiple versions, follow the one applicable to you.\n", "Q: wubi said files is missing after selecting UEFI and csm After installing ubuntu using wubi and selecting UEFI and csm UEFI as disabled in samsung series 5 with window 8,  wubi said files is missing.\nDo i need to install with wubi again?\ni read the answer, it said to use livecd, but i only hope not actual install in partition, only expect wubi in windows 8, after read, it is quite terrible to install partition with livecd , it said choose anything you want during installation, but i already installed in window 8 already. Why install again using livecd. finally it said it may not boot window 8 any more. is it possible to keep using window 8 boot manager to boot ubuntu?\n\nA: You can't just switch from UEFI to CSM and expect it to boot. That will just stop Windows booting. Wubi doesn't work on UEFI period.\nWubi doesn't work on UEFI computers due to the partition table the disk uses. The only way to get it to work would be to completely reformat, reinstall Windows and then install Wubi. \nEven then, replacing a GPT disk with MBR partition table doesn't clean up all GPT data and Ubuntu will fail to install due to exceptions thrown from parted. You'd have to download a program called fixparts to completely erase the GPT data. \nThis is obviously an excessive amount of effort to go to in order to install Wubi which is generally intended to try out Ubuntu safely. \nSince Wubi does not support any new computers shipping with Windows 8, or any computer booting via UEFI you have to choose an alternative method of which there are many:\n\n\n*\n\n*normal dual boot\n\n*replace Windows\n\n*install (non Wubi) to an external drive\n\n*install in a virtual machine\n\n*run from a live USB with persistence\n\n*run from a live DVD\n\n", "Q: GL_EXT_texture_compression_s3tc error when opening a Steam game So I was trying to play Team Fortress 2 when this message appears:\n\nError!

If you had an Nvidia card then installing the latest proprietary ones (The ones that come in the Xorg Edgers PPA) will solve this issue as seen in the following image:\n \nBut since you have an Ati then you are doomed... just kidding ^^. Simply do the following steps in order to have full support (This is my quick way of solving video support issues like this):\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Dash by pressing the SUPER key (Which is called the Windows key in Windows, in my case it still has the Windows logo on it and I think I got the flu by pressing on it yesterday). Now type terminal. It should look something like this:\n\nNow press ENTER and a terminal window should appear similar to the following:\n\nNow type the following line to install the Xorg Edgers PPA:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa -y\n\n*Update and Upgrade system so the system knows you have included Xorg-Edgers:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\n\n*Install the latest Ati Radeon Drivers which you can do in any of the following ways. I will include them in the order I would do them first (Only do one of the following options):\n\n\n*\n\n*Installing the fglrx-installer package (Which is the one that shows in Xorg-Edgers:   \n\n\nsudo apt-get install fglrx-installer\nAfter this, reboot the computer and you should be finished installing with the Ati Driver. I put this one here first since it is the one that is more compatible with Ubuntu, is updated, less bugs and easy to install. Go to step 4 if you did this.\nIf you had an Nvidia card, it would also be easier to do just by reading How do I install the Nvidia drivers?\n\n\n*\n\n*Type Software Sources in Dash. Open the Software Sources Window and go to the last TAB that says Additional Drivers. Look for the proprietary drivers for your Ati there. For Nvidia it looks like the following image but it will be the same for Ati (Just imagine all Nvidia drivers mentioned there to be Ati ^^):\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the latest drivers from the Ati/Amd site and follow this guide: What is the correct way to install proprietary ATI Catalyst Video Drivers (fglrx) directly from AMD?\n\n*For other \"older\" type of Ati cards go here: How do I install Gallium3d Drivers in Ubuntu 12.10?\n\n\n*After making sure you have the latest driver that supports your video card and have only installed one of the ones mentioned above, reboot the system and test again. The latest driver makes sure your video card supports the S3TC texture compression. To test this you can do one of the following options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run sudo amdcccle in the terminal. If the Catalyst Control Center appears you are good to go.\n\n*Type Catalyst in Dash and see if it appears there.\n\n*Type fglrxinfo and see if it shows information about your video card. If you get \"Command not found\" or something similar, the drivers are not installed yet.\nLastly if you get a message similar to Required OpenGL extension GL_EXT_texture_compression_s3tc it just means that, either your video card does not support this compression or you are missing installing the correct libraries. If it is the libraries do the following:\nsudo apt-get install libtxc-dxtn-s2tc0\n\nI want to also add that there are a couple or articles in PHORONIX about the S3TC issues regarding patents and open source work. It is a good reading: http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=search&q=S3TC\nVIRTUALBOX - All of the above is for cases where you were running Steam in Ubuntu on the host, not on the Guest. Since you have just limited Ubuntu to what Virtualbox can offer, I will point you to this link Sharing between Host and Guest in Virtualbox which should cover the installation of the Guest Addition for Ubuntu. After you have done both, installing the driver and installing the Guest Addition, if the problem is still there, this basically means that Virtualbox is not letting the driver (Inside Virtualbox) read directly the mentioned GLX extension. So the problem would go from an Ubuntu problem to a Virtualbox one where you should go to the Virtualbox site and explain to them the problem.\nLet me know if you solve the problem with this little tips.

Some apps (Google and iTunes) are incredibly slow to start, and although I've confirmed with a separate ISO boot CD of memtest-86 that my RAM is error-free, I'm looking to learn more about this machine and why it might be running slow.\nNow that Ubuntu is installed I think I need to retrace my steps, and I would like to know how to do so safely. I'm not sure I'm finding a lot of value in having another OS on my machine when all I really wanted was some dependable and free diagnostics...I'm not a heavy enough user of XP to notice its flaws, and although Ubuntu may be wonderful (and free thanks to the selfless efforts of many), it represents to me at best a learning curve with little payback if I boot to Ubuntu, and at worst an annoyance in the form of having to bypass the Ubuntu OS at start-up in favor of Windows XP (when my wife starts using this machine that will freak her out). \nFurthermore, I'm gravely concerned that my partitioning activity during installation has somehow robbed me of otherwise usable space on my rather modest 200GB Western Digital drive. I did not know how to tell what the partitioning \"slider\" tool was going to do, e.g. how much would be allocated to Ubuntu versus XP, so I just left it set at the values shown during the install dialog (122GB on the left, 63GB on the right), hoping and thinking that the installer would automatically apportion modestly. Now my drive has only 63GB of usable space with the other 122GB used for something, which I suspect is Ubuntu).\nSo I'm looking for some wisdom in the following areas:\n1) Does Ubuntu give the ability to critically evaluate (other than memtest) the condition of hardware as well as the overall health of a system (registry, etc etc), enabling one to intelligently diagnose and correct performance issues? If so, are these tools/utilities available WITHOUT installing Ubuntu (e.g. to those \"trying\" it)?\n2) Is there a way to safely uninstall Ubuntu, returning the system to Windows XP only?\n3) If there a way (either with or without uninstalling Ubuntu) to optimize the partition sizes of my disk, to allow for maximum availability to Windows XP  (with a modest amount allocated to Ubuntu should I choose to leave it installed)? Currently I have 122GB  used and I can say with almost 100% certainty that my sparsely populated machine is naturally consuming nowhere NEAR that amount of data...rather, I believe I \"clobbered\" this storage during my partitioning activity during the install.\n4) If I choose (or am forced for practical reasons) to leave Ubuntu installed, is there a way to default to Windows XP at boot instead of to Ubuntu, if no keys are depressed within the allotted timeframe?\nThanks to all who offer me advice!!\nDennis\n\nA: Boot once again from the ubuntu live cd.

When checked on windows 7 the same dvd shows up all install files of Ubuntu.\nIs there a solution for this at all?  The bioes does not allow to boot with usb drive for me to try that.\n\nA: could it be that your DVD-drive doesn't recognise the DVD-R ? \nSince you work with XP it could be possible. \nI would try to burn the 12.04.2 (5 years support and kernel 3.5 included) on a CD-R and retry to install on your computer. \nLet's keep our fingers crossed this will help you futher. \nb.t.w. is your fysical RAM memory large enough (1Gb at least) for running Unity - Ubuntu ? \n", "Q: Online accounts in Ubuntu 12.10 not connecting I added my facebook and google accounts to Ubuntu online accounts recently but I keep getting the message \"Connection to example@gmail.com failed No reason specified.\" Im not able to connect to any of my accounts using the Online accounts.

After that I restarted the computer, and set everything up from scratch.\nThen it worked again.\nHope this helps and will fix your problem.\nIf not, maybe someone else has a better suggestion.\n", "Q: How to get past Grub prompt during boot? I am new to Ubuntu and am stuck. Please help as I do not know much about Linux or command line. I am a Windows 7 user.\nHere are the steps I took to install Ubuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*I downloaded \"ubuntu-12.10-desktop-i386.iso\" file\n\n*Further via 7zip, extracted the Ubuntu iso file in Windows only.\n\n*Ran wubi.exe from the extract and installed Ubuntu in E drive. C drive contains Windows 7 and iso file was saved here only. Wubi.exe downloaded some files for around an hour.\n\n*The installation was successful and it asked for a reboot. I got a screen with some characters and after an hour or so I forced the shutdown. \n\n*On reboot I got the option to select Windows or Ubuntu. On selecting Ubuntu I get this and cannot proceed further.\n\n\n\nGNU GRUB version 2.00-7ubuntu11\nMinimal BASH-like line editing is supported.\n\n\nHow do I get past this grub prompt?\n\nA: Don't force shutdown Ubuntu. It's often not required as you can safely reboot using Alt+SysRq R-E-I-S-U-B. (Alt+PrntScr if you have no SysRq key, they're the same).\nIt's common to cause corruption when hard rebooting, especially on Wubi installs where there is a virtual disk that's stored on the NTFS file system, but it contains an ext4 file system.\nSo, since you just installed - I'd recommend reinstalling. Or doing a normal dual boot. To clean up the file system corruption you should first run chkdsk /f from Windows.\nAlso, if you had problems installing you might have some incompatible hardware or something that requires a closed-source driver (not included automatically). i.e. if you have a Radeon or Nvidia graphics card you should boot with nomodeset. You can find out how through this link: My computer boots to a black screen, what options do I have to fix it?\n\nA: have you gone through https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/GRUB_2?rd=Grub2#Encountering_the_dreaded_Grub2_boot_prompt\nIt says you are getting the dreaded GRUB Prompt ... GRUB was not properly configured, use the commands in the link to boot your system.\n", "Q: How do I add a folder to sync.?

You will get a notification saying that the file sync has started.\nAlso, to check whether the sync process has started or not, open Ubuntu One (using Dash or otherwise). If the sync failed to start, then you can add it from the option Add a Folder from this computer.\n\nA: Did you try to add the folder via Ubuntu One application?\nStart Ubuntu One via dash, and under \"Folders\" tab you shuold see \"My personal folders\". All folders, which are synchronized with your ubuntu one account should be listed there. If they are not, try to add them - click on Add a folder from this computer.\n", "Q: detecting corrupted files in ubuntu I had windows7 on my HDD.

I can still move the move around, but cannot click on anything. I've been searching for a solution but it seems like a lot of people have this problem but also seems like there is no solution. Anyone?\n\nA: Any hardware info is required; it could be that your RAM-memory is too low and Ubuntu has difficulty to settle. This comes alive when you open apps from the side bar. Keep in mind that Unity actually needs, for a good work-flow, for about 1.5 Gb of RAM-memory (my own standards).

There wasn't apt.conf file in /etc/apt/ so I've created it using nano.\nBut I don't understand what I need to write there. I've written\nhttp_proxy = http://lgn:pwd@192.168.1.254:8080/ there and then restarted networking. But when I try to apt-get update - it doesn't work.\nActually, I don't understand what port and IP I should write in apt.conf file (there was example with 192.168.1.254 IP and 8080 port, so I decided to use them).\n\nA: If you need to use apt behind a proxy, probably everything else also needs the proxy config.\nI like to manage my proxy settings in one place, which would be the environment variable.\nFor that I create a /etc/profiles.d/99-proxy.sh, that contains the necessary proxy settings (like larent described):\nexport http_proxy=http://DOMAIN\\USERNAME:PASSWORD@SERVER:PORT/\nexport https_proxy=$http_proxy\nexport ftps_proxy=$http_proxy\n\nthat way, all users on that machine have access to the proxy. (don't forget chmod a+x)\nWhen you use apt or apt-get as a user, that user is able to use sudo.\nLike Frank Qiu described, sudo does not pass environment variables.\nFor that you can add \nDefaults env_keep += \"http_proxy https_proxy ftp_proxy\"\n\nto (e.g.)\n/etc/sudoers.d/00-environment \n\nor directly into the\n/etc/sudoers\n\nfile. That way you only have to manage the proxy settings in one place.\n\nA: This is a more general answer along with apt config.\nAs there a lot of places to configure proxy settings, it might get confusing at beginning. Let me summarize some things and suggest some good practices.\nFor console programs\nEx:  wget, git and almost every console application which connects to internet.\nIf you want to configure proxy every time you run your commands then set the environment variables using following commands.\nexport http_proxy=http://DOMAIN\\USERNAME:PASSWORD@SERVER:PORT/\nexport ftp_proxy=http://DOMAIN\\USERNAME:PASSWORD@SERVER:PORT/\n\nElse if you want to use the same settings every time for all users, then:\nConfigure in bashrc\n$ nano /etc/bash.bashrc\nexport http_proxy=http://DOMAIN\\USERNAME:PASSWORD@SERVER:PORT/\nexport ftp_proxy=http://DOMAIN\\USERNAME:PASSWORD@SERVER:PORT/\n\nConfigure in /etc/environment\n$ nano /etc/environment\nhttps_proxy=\"http://myproxy.server.com:8080/\" \nftp_proxy=\"http://myproxy.server.com:8080/\" ...\n\nConfigure using GUI\nOpen the network settings and set the your system wide network proxy.\nNetwork -> Network proxy -> Configure -> Apply system wide.\nBut this might not be useful if you have authentication for the proxy.\nFor apt.\nYou need to do some extra work for apt, as apt doesn't care about the proxy environment variables.\n$ nano /etc/apt/apt.conf\nAcquire::http::Proxy \"http://USERNAME:PASSWORD@SERVER:PORT\";\nAcquire::https::Proxy \"https://USERNAME:PASSWORD@SERVER:PORT\";\n\n\nFor everything out of this scope, there will likely be an option to configure proxy settings in the application itself.\n\nA: Something like the following should work:\nAcquire::http::proxy \"http://lgn:pwd@192.168.1.254:8080/\";\nAcquire::https::proxy \"http://lgn:pwd@192.168.1.254:8080/\";\n\n\nA: To use a proxy, you need a proxy server. The IP and port have to be from this proxy server. Login and pwd must be your user and password on the proxy server (if the proxy requires login).\nFrom help.ubuntu.com site:\n\nAPT configuration file method\nThis method uses the apt.conf file which is found in your /etc/apt/ directory. This method is useful if you only want apt-get (and not other applications) to use a http-proxy permanently.\nOn some installations there will be no apt-conf file set up. Edit apt-conf file (or create a new one if you have no one yet) using the editor of your choice.\nsudo nano /etc/apt/apt.conf\n\nAdd this line to your /etc/apt/apt.conf file (substitute your details for yourproxyaddress and proxyport).\nAcquire::http::Proxy \"http://yourproxyaddress:proxyport\";\n\nSave the apt.conf file. \n\nIf your proxy needs a login/password, substitute:\n\"http://yourproxyaddress:proxyport\";\n\nwith:\n\"http://username:password@yourproxyaddress:proxyport\";\n\nusing username and password from the proxy server.\n\nA: What you can do is also try to run command with sudo -E, which will take the environment settings. It seems to work for me when I try to update, add-apt-repository, and install.\nExample:\nsudo -E add-apt-repository ppa:xxxxx\n\nAccording to @David Foerster this only works for manual interaction using shell, but it won't work on automated tasks and services invoking Apt without user interaction.\n\nA: If you want to set a proxy just in one case, you can use [-o=config_string]:\napt -o acquire::http::proxy=\"http://yourproxyaddress:proxyport\"\n\nNote the =. The option is case-insensitive.\nAlso, if you have repos using https on your sources.list you may want to add -o acquire::https::proxy=false.\nAlready mentioned here.\n\nA: The original question might be in wrong direction. I believe you want to setup a proxy server in Linux ? \nWell that is completely different than wanting to use a existing proxy from Linux environment. \nIf your question is the first one then use any third party services to configure a proxy server in Linux. An example could be squid.\nSimple commands to install squid:\n$ sudo apt-get install squid3\n\nThen edit the configuration to allow the Local Net (in this case your own machine). \n    $ sudo vi /etc/squid3/squid.conf\nAdd/Edit the following lines:\nhttp_access allow local_net\nacl local_net src 192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0\n\nAssuming your IP for the Linux machine is in 192.168.1/24 block.\n", "Q: Can commercial applications use Gsettings? According to specified technical requirements, a commercial application must be self‑contained in a single directory (which I agree is a good requirement), and use ~/.config/<app-name> for its configuration data (good requirement too). However, Gsettings requires to have a schema file installed inside of some subdirectory of $XDG_DATA_DIRS. Do I have to understand commercial applications can't make use of GSettings?\nUpdate\nI've found another page, which seems to suggest requirements are not exactly that restrictive. The latter mention installation of an icon file in /usr/share/icons/ and a desktop file in /usr/share/applications/. If that's OK, may be that's OK too, to install a GSettings schema in /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/? That would still be better to have confirmation. I feel the first mentioned link, lacks precisions.\n\nA: You don't need to install schema files into /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/, they can be installed into any ${XDG_DATA_DIRS}/glib-2.0/schemas/.  \nSo you can install your schema to /opt/<yourapp>/share/glib-2.0/schemas, then have your binary add /opt/<yourapp>/share to the XDG_DATA_DIR environment variable before you try to use GSettings.  \nThis is what we do for Quickly apps being installed into /opt/extra.ubuntu.com/<appname>/\n", "Q: Windows Phone 8 detected as mass storage From version 8 onwards Windows Phone supports MTP (media transfer protocol) to transfer audio and I thought I could use Rhythmbox to upload music onto my device.\nThing is Rhythmbox doesn't display the device under Devices pane (there's no Device pane for that matter).\nI searched other questions here and tried out installing mtp-tools, mtpfs and also tried gMTP, which doesn't seem to detect the device as a portable player.\nI see that the device's icon looks like a Camera in dash bar and when I see the address location, it shows gphoto2://[usb:002,013]/, which makes me doubt that it's detected as a camera or as a mass storage device. /.gvfs/gphoto2 mount on usb%3A002,003 is where the actual mount is. What do I do to fix this?\nI tried creating .is_audio_player too.\n\nA: I was just reading this article:\nhttp://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/how-to/wp8/music/syncing-music-faq\n\"You can navigate to your phone's Music folder (or the Music folder on your phone's SD card, if it has one), and then drag files to it from your PC.\"\nwhich to me makes it sound like you can (outside of rythmbox) open the Music folder on the device and copy files directly there.  The simple solution might be to just to open your PC's music folder, select all, and copy the music into the device's music folder.\nDoes that work for you?  This doesn't work at all with my WP7, but I was thinking of an upgrade to keep my trifecta going -- Ubuntu Dekstop, Android Tablet, Windows Phone :)  If that doesn't work I'm hoping there's good cloud storage.\n", "Q: Problem with installation and first login I tried to install the Ubuntu but had notice a problem twice and it will allow to get in to the desktop, but it appears the login to write a username and a password.

I followed all the steps, burned a DVD with the Ubuntu system, boot the computer with the DVD, until the step to choose install or try (I chose install).\n\nA: A username cannot contain white spaces and it must be a single word. A name can be your name [space] surname.\nIt is usually recommended to only use usernames that begin with a lower case letter or an underscore, followed by lower case letters, digits, underscores, or dashes. They can end with a dollar sign.In regular expression terms: [a-z_][a-z0-9_-]*[$]? On Debian, the only constraints are that usernames must neither start with a dash ('-') nor contain a colon (':') or a whitespace (space: ' ', end of line: '\\n', tabulation: '\\t', etc.). Note that using a slash ('/') may break the default algorithm for the definition of the user's home directory.

Imagine you can boot up on almost every computer with your USB, and work in your own personalized environment anywhere, without carrying a notebook. I managed to install Ubuntu 16.04 in a USB HDD this way:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the latest Ubuntu installer.\n\n*Make a bootable pendrive. I use LiLi on Windows and dd command on Linux. You can google it. \n\n*Boot up from Ubuntu pendrive. The Ubuntu installer detects the internal HDD and offers to install Ubuntu and keep the other OS, or make a clean install, optionally with encryption. However, this window only shows the internal HDD. If you want to install to USB, you have to select the \"Other\" option. But it is really hard to setup an encrypted install manually.\n\n*I did the following: take out my internal HDD from my notebook, and boot up Ubuntu installer again. If the USB drive is connected, but the internal HDD is taken out, the installer will display the USB drive as primary drive and offers to make a clear install with encryption. You can also choose to overwrite your disk before install if you want. \n\n*Start the installation with your preferred options. Same as usual from now on.\nI tested my USB Ubuntu on 5 different computer from old to \"new\" and it works like a charm. No problem with drivers, not a single error or question window when I boot up on a different PC.\n\nA: It can be incredibly beneficial to encrypt everything but your bootloader; obviously, your bootloader must remain cleartext. One answer here suggests to use the alternate installer to encrypt almost everything, but include unencrypted content on the internal hdd. This invites an \"Evil Maid\" attack: during a period when your computer is physically insecure an attacker may modify passphrase collection to store/send your key. \nI have found the best approach makes use of special GRUB features for FDE, with GRUB installed on a USB.

How to prevent this? I am triple booting Windows Vista, Ubuntu 12.04 desktop and a Fluxbox based on Ubuntu 12.10 mini-iso. Vista was installed first, then I installed Ubuntu 12.04 desktop and then Ubuntu 12.10 Fluxbox. The Ubuntu 12.10 Fluxbox installation booted as default, which was my intention. All the systems get updated regularly. Sometimes after a dist-update in the Ubuntu system which isn't booting as default the default boot changes to that system. So sometimes the GRUB boot-order changes from Ubuntu 12.10 Fluxbox as default to Ubuntu 12.04 desktop as default, a number of dist-updates later it changes back again. This behavior happens repeatedly, what causes the behaviour only sometimes is not clear.   \nIt seems like there are two grub.cfg files (resposible for generating the GRUB startup menu as I understand it) ,one generated by Ubuntu 12.04 desktop and one by Ubuntu 12.10 Fluxbox. During boot one of those files gets read. Which one is used changes sometimes after the updates. The updates are not release-updates (e.g. 12.04 -> 12.10).\nIs there any way to prevent this behaviour?  \n\nA: First you need to install Boot Repair:\ngrub-install -v \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair\n\nIf you have already installed boot-repair, then skip previous step and run the boot repair:\nboot-repair\n\nFrom the boot-repair window, you can configure which Ubuntu will be starting as default.\nHow to use boot repair visit\nhttp://www.howtogeek.com/114884/how-to-repair-grub2-when-ubuntu-wont-boot/\n", "Q: ThinkPad W500 ubuntu 12.10 64 poor battery performace This week I installed Ubuntu 12.10 64 on my ThinkPad W500.

I want to dual-boot Windows 8(already installed) and Ubuntu 12.10. The thing is I would like to try out different distros over the coming months. \nSo my question is what would be a good partition strategy to make it easy to migrate from one distro to another.\nI know the first step would be to create a separate /home partition (in addition to the root and swap partition). What about other stuff? I might also have apache installed so  would i need to either migrate /etc/www manually between distros or create a partition for /etc?\n\nA: The biggest single help in my own distribution experimentation isn't partitioning: It's virtualization. I've got VirtualBox set up with over a dozen virtual machines. It's very easy to install a new distribution, delete an unused one, back up a whole virtual disk, and so on, without messing with partition tables or risking my main installation.\nIf you must have direct hardware access, my recommendation is to look into an LVM configuration. This enables you to add, delete, and resize logical volumes to hold filesystems much as you'd add, delete, or resize ordinary files. This greatly simplifies management of multiple Linux distributions, since you don't need to be as concerned about the placement and size of particular partitions. OTOH, some distributions (including Ubuntu's desktop editions) have poor LVM support, so you may need to jump through some extra hoops to get them installed on LVMs.\nBeyond that, you cannot put /etc on its own partition (or logical volume), since that must be part of the installation's root filesystem. (Think about it: /etc/fstab, which tells the computer where filesystems are found, is in /etc.) In theory, I suppose you might be able to make /etc/www a separate partition, but I wouldn't recommend it; if Apache has different requirements from one distribution to another, you might not be able to share those configuration files. Copying them over and tweaking them manually might work, though.\nSharing swap space is perfectly do-able. So is sharing the /home partition, with the caveat that user programs can have varying requirements between distributions, so you shouldn't try to share your user home directory (/home/ned or whatever you use). You can avoid such sharing by using different usernames on the different distributions, or you can use account management tools like usermod to link an account to a directory name that's not identical to the account name, so that the user ned could be linked to /home/nedu for Ubuntu, /home/nedf for Fedora, or whatever.\n", "Q: How do I install Chromium and Skype?

Ubuntu provides an alternative kernel package - linux-image-virtual, that is supposed to be optimized for use in virtual machines. What are actual optimizations and how much faster/smaller/better is it compared to the generic kernel when running on the guest OS? Also, are these optimizations equally effective for all leading virtual machines, or does QEMU/VirtualBox/VMWare/YourFavouriteVM gain any special advantages in performance?\n\nA: The difference between the Virtual and Server kernels is that the Virtual kernel is intended to be utilized inside a virtual machine. The virtual kernel only includes the necessary drivers to run inside popular virtualization technologies such as KVM, Xen, and VMWare. The server kernel in contrast contains the necessary drivers to work with a wide range of hardware, and should be installed directly on host systems. Other than that, all other options are identical between the server and the virtual kernel.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/ServerFaq#What_are_the_differences_between_the_server_and_virtual_kernels.3F\nThe difference is that the virtual kernel only bundles drivers needed for the common virtual hardware devices instead of all the modules for real-world hardware.\nSo it is considerably smaller in terms of disk space. I'm not aware of any tuning for performance or any functional difference that way, I think it's just for smaller images.\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1635961\n\nA: But unfortunately no kernel modules (ip_tables) are loaded with linux-virtual kernel so no csf firewall \"out of the box\".\n", "Q: List all human users How can I list all human users that I've created? I've tried cat /etc/passwd and it just lists a lot of stuff.\n\nA: While it might seem like a clear-cut idea, actually there is ambiguity in the meaning of human user. Is a user account deliberately hidden from the login screen because it's used only for specialized purposes (but by humans) a human user? How about the ubuntu user (UID 999) on the live CD? And guest accounts in Ubuntu are created on-the-fly and destroyed after logout; are they human users? More examples could be devised.\nTherefore, it's fitting that multiple, non-equivalent answers have been given. Saige Hamblin's solution of running ls /home is what people actually do, and unless you're writing a script, you should probably just use that.\nMaking ls /home More Robust\nBut perhaps you have users that have been removed, but whose home directories still exist in /home, and you must avoid listing them. Or maybe for some other reason you must ensure only the entries in /home that correspond to real accounts are listed.\nIn that case, I suggest passing the names of everything in /home to getent (to retrieve the passwd entries of users with those names), then isolate and display just the username field (with grep, sed, or awk, as per your preference). Any one of these will do:\ngetent passwd $(ls /home) | grep -o '^[^:]*'\n\ngetent passwd $(ls /home) | sed 's/:.*//'\n\ngetent passwd $(ls /home) | awk -F: '{print $1}'\n\nThis should work well, as you shouldn't have user accounts with whitespace or control characters in their names; cannot, without reconfiguring Ubuntu to allow it; and if you do, you have bigger problems. Thus the usual problems with parsing ls are inapplicable. But even though it's really okay here, if you consider command substitutions with ls aesthetically displeasing or just a bad habit, you may prefer:\ngetent passwd $(basename -a /home/*) | grep -o '^[^:]*'\n\ngetent passwd $(basename -a /home/*) | sed 's/:.*//'\n\ngetent passwd $(basename -a /home/*) | awk -F: '{print $1}'\n\nThese don't accommodate whitespace or control characters either. I provide them only because $(ls /home) looks wrong even when it is right, and thus rubs many users the wrong way. In most situations, there are real, good reasons to avoid parsing ls, and in those situations parsing basename -a is usually only very slightly less bad. In this situation, however, due to the limitation on what characters may practically occur in usernames, they are both fine.\nExplanation, Benefits, and Drawbacks\nI use getent mainly because it accepts usernames as arguments to restrict its output, but also because it is slightly more universal than examining /etc/passwd directly, in case authentication facilities and the password database are provided by network services.\nThis method has the additional benefit over ls /home that, on systems with a separate /home partition, lost+found usually appears in the output of ls /home.\n\n*\n\n*With the more robust method presented above, lost+found will only appear if there happens to be a user (human or not) called lost+found, which is unlikely.\n\n*But if you're entering commands interactively rather than writing a script, ls /home is fine--you know you don't have a human user called lost+found.\n\nInfrequently, this method (in any of the above variations) will produce unsatisfactory output:\n\n*\n\n*If a user's home directory exists outside /home, or not at all, this suggests but does not imply the account shouldn't be considered to represent a human user. This method only lists users when there is a directory of the same name in /home.\n\n*If you have created additional directories in /home that aren't actually anybody's home directory, and they happen to have the same name as an existing non-human user--or consist of words separated by whitespace, one or more of which has the same name as an existing non-human user--then some non-human users may be included in the output.\n(This method can be implemented with a loop and separate getent invocations, so word splitting doesn't produce spurious output. But the complexity is not warranted; fundamentally, if you use /home as something other than a place for users' home directories, this method will not produce reliable output.)\n\nMaking UID Checking Simpler\nIf you decide to go with a method that checks user IDs to ensure they are in the likely range for accounts representing human beings, as in the accepted answer or Oli's answer, then I suggest this for brevity:\ngetent passwd | grep -oP '^[^:]+(?=:x:\\d{4}:)'\n\nThis uses a Perl regular expression (-P) to show:\n\n*\n\n*text at the beginning of a line (^) containing no :s ([^:]+) — this is the first field, as : is the field separator in passwd\n\n*that precedes but doesn't include ((?= )) the password field x — it should always be x, since in Ubuntu password hashes are stored in the shadow database, not the world-readable passwd database\n\n*and a UID field consisting of exactly 4 digits (:\\d{4}:).\n\nThis is thus a significantly shorter and somewhat simpler variant of the technique in the accepted answer. (The technique described there works fine too, and it does have the benefit of being portable to non – GNU/Linux systems whose grep doesn't support -P.)\nReconsidering the \"Human\" UID Range\nIf you want to accommodate very high UIDs and check for nobody explicitly, you can use the method in Oli's answer. You may wish to consider, however, if users with very high UIDs should really be assumed human, or if they are more likely to be some other special-purpose non-human user (like nobody). In practice such users--besides nobody--are uncommon, so really this is a judgment call on your part.\nA possible compromise is to list users in the range of UIDs that are actually being assigned to newly created, non-\"system\" users. You can check for this in adduser.conf:\n$ grep -E '^(FIRST|LAST)_UID' /etc/adduser.conf\nFIRST_UID=1000\nLAST_UID=29999\nHere are two ways to list users whose UIDs range from 1000 to 29999:\ngetent passwd | grep -oP '^[^:]+(?=:x:[12]?\\d{4}:)'\n\ngetent passwd | awk -F: '999<$3 && $3<30000 {print $1}'\n\n\nA: Human users have UIDs starting at 1000, so you can use that fact to filter out the non-humans:\ncut -d: -f1,3 /etc/passwd | egrep ':[0-9]{4}$' | cut -d: -f1\n\nThis cuts the first (username) and third (UID) colon-delimited fields from /etc/passwd, then filters for the resulting lines which end with a colon and four digits, then cuts the first (username) field from that, leaving you with a list of users with UIDs between 1000 and 9999.\nIf you have more than nine thousand users on your system, this will fail - but it's necessary to restrict the result to 4-digit UIDs in order not to catch nobody (UID 65534).\n\nA: This does pretty much what the accepted answer does, just in one command instead of three:\nawk -F: '$3 >= 1000 && $1 != \"nobody\" {print $1}' /etc/passwd\n\nAnd thanks to Karel in the comments, the nobody user is also filtered out.\n\nA: I personally like to use just:\nls /home\n\nAdmittedly this is not a list of users but instead a list of their home directories. Currently existing human users on the system will have home directories in /home, but you may see the home directories of past users who were removed, as well.\nThis works for my purposes and may work for yours as well. For example, if you are looking to delete a user account that turns out no longer to exist (nonexistent-user) and run the command\nsudo deluser nonexistent-user\nit will just tell you that that this user does not exist.\n\nA: TL;DR: only human users have SystemAccount=false\nOne other way is to list output of while ignoring root ls /var/lib/AccountsService/users/ | grep -v root. Now, there is a quirk - gdm, a greeter/login screen ( or more formally desktop manager ) is also listed as a user. So just from listing we cant tell if gdm is human or not.\nA more efficient and correct approach is to go through the files in that folder and find out which users are listed as having SystemAccount=false. The one-liner bellow achieves that\ngrep SystemAccount=false /var/lib/AccountsService/users/* | awk -F '/' '{gsub(\":\",\"/\");print $6}'\n\nA: Joining the party, I oversee a network systems using LDAP, having home directories outside /home and UIDs (due to a scripting glitch) in the millions. None of the current answers, therefore, work. The test that works for me is checking whether the user has a valid login shell. A valid shell is one which is listed in /etc/shells. The simplest form:\ngetent passwd | grep -wFf /etc/shells\n\nThe file may contain comments (or empty lines), so one might have to filter them out:\ngetent passwd | grep -wFf <(grep '^/' /etc/shells)\n\n\nA: On buntu systems, regular users (human users, that is) have UIDs beginning with 1000 which are assigned sequentially to them when their accounts are first created. What all this boils down to is that the first account created on a buntu system has a UID of 1000. The next one created has a UID of 1001. And so on and so forth.\nSo, the simplest way to list all human user accounts present on the system, in my opinion, is to check whether the third column in the /etc/passwd file which contains the user's UID is greater than or equal to 1000 and less than, let's say, 2000 (it's very unlikely for a typical desktop PC to have more than one thousand user accounts, don't you think so?):\n$ awk -F$':' '{ if ($3 >= 1000 && $3 < 2000) print $1; }' /etc/passwd\n\n\nA: grep -E \"x:[1-9]([0-9]){3}:\" /etc/passwd\n\nIt browses the content of /etc/passwd looking for entries of human users.\nTo do that grep looks for lines that have user id numbers bigger than 1000.\nExamples of matching regex:\nx:1001:\nx:1203:\n", "Q: Can I force grub2-update NOT to use uuid? I am experiencing install hell trying to add an installation of Ubuntu 12.10 and Scientific Linux 6.3 to an old machine (BIOS not EFI) with Debian Squeeze and Linux Mint 10. The installs seem to go OK but when rebooting grub either refuses to boot completely (I had to reinstall grub) or complain that the uuid of both Ubuntu and Scientific Linux are invalid. Most of the time Debian Squeeze and Linux Mint 10 boot OK.\nOne of the hard drives is a 3TB hard drive formatted using GUID/GPT. It is the one that gets grub on it's MBR.\nIs it possible to force grub NOT to use uuids. This way even if it is corrupted I stand a chance of repairing the install manually or at least booting manually with some difficulty?\n\nA: Yes. To do that you need to edit /etc/default/grub (root permission required). There you should find a commented line like this:\n#GRUB_DISABLE_LINUX_UUID=true\n\nUncomment it out, save the file and execute:\nsudo update-grub2\n\nPlease note that the location of this file can be Ubuntu/Debian specific, but as you seem to be using Debian or Mint to configure Grub it should be ok.\n\nA: Grub also uses UUID in searching for the partition to set as root.  Since I wanted to do away with all uses of UUID in grub, I've modified /usr/share/grub/grub-mkconfig_lib such that when I run update-grub, it uses labels instead.\nsee: Patch for making update-grub (/usr/share/grub/grub/grub-mkconfig_lib) use labels\n", "Q: Can't install Ubuntu for several reasons I'm having some issues installing Ubuntu on my Samsung NP-RV520-S02SE Laptop.\nFirst off, I'm getting error: failure reading sector somethingsomething when booting the CD and hitting \"Install Ubuntu\".\nI think it might be because of UEFI, but here's the second issue I'm having.\nSince a couple of ways back, I've been unable to enter BIOS. So I can't check if UEFI is enabled or disabled. When booting it says \"[F2] Enter BIOS\" and when I hit F2 that text changes to \"Please wait..\" so I'm pretty sure it's registering my command and that key F2 key is working, yet it's just skipping the BIOS and bringing me to the Windows boot manager, or the Ubuntu CD if that's in the CD drive.\nAnyone who'd know what might be wrong?\nI should also mention that I'm not the best at Ubuntu, I'm fairly new.\n\nA: First, you should not install Ubuntu on a Samsung laptop in EFI mode! The reason is that there's a very serious firmware bug on at least some Samsung models that can cause the computer to be bricked.There's an Ubuntu bug report here:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-cdimage/+bug/1040557\nMatthew Garrett has further information on why it shouldn't be considered fixed, although a workaround is present in the very latest Linux kernels:\nhttp://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/22855.html\nIMHO, the only safe way to use a recent Samsung computer at the moment is in BIOS mode. Unfortunately, this means re-installing Windows, or at least converting the installation to boot in BIOS mode rather than in EFI mode. (I hear that's possible, but I don't have a URL describing precisely how to do it.)\nAs to your problem getting into the firmware, I'm not sure. It could be another symptom of a buggy firmware. There's a tool in Windows 8 that interfaces with the firmware, so you could try using that to do your firmware fiddling, or perhaps it will at least have an option to let you get in via a more conventional route. You might also check with Samsung to see if they've got a firmware update; that might conceivably fix the problem.\nPersonally, though, if the computer is still within the store's return period, I'd return it for a refund and get something else. A computer that's easily bricked by software is too much of a risk; an accident the day after it goes out of warranty could cost you a lot of money!\n", "Q: Firefox Video Links - Open as VLC Network Stream If I click a link in Firefox and select open with vlc, it downloads the entire file, before opening it in vlc media player and playing it.

Basically, you want to burn your Live USB (preferably with Ubuntu Secure Remix, but regular Ubuntu should work as well), and before you try to boot from it, look in your BIOS for something that says \"FastBoot/QuickBoot\" or \"Intel Smart Response Technology/SRT\" and disable it. \"Secure Boot\", if you have it, might also have to be disabled.

If you are using Ubuntu 12.04.2 or 12.10 and beyond, then it should work; otherwise, you will have to switch back to legacy-BIOS.  If you search how to boot older Operating systems in UEFI Secure Boot, you will find the answer you are looking for, but it will require a lot of risky tinkering.

In this case it is 12.04 LTS. \nKDE and KAlarm are updated.\nIf you need further information/details please let me know.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: You can disable errors on pre-alarm scripts in the Special Actions button, where you edit the alarm. Unfortunately, I don't see a good way of doing it for simple terminal scripts.\nWhat you might want to do is just modify the scripts you have running to check whether the Internet is up or not. See this StackOverflow question for checking the status of an Internet connection from Bash.\n\nA: Command alarms should have the option to ignore execution errors in the same way that pre-alarm actions have.

Then I restart my notebook (samsung r580) and access the BIOS. I select the option to boot from USB, and restart again. The options screen appears. So far, everything is fine.\nI choose Install Ubuntu, then I select the language and then I try to select install alongside an existing W7. Here is where I have trouble. Clicking \"continue\" restarts the system, and the option screen appears again and again and again.... What am I doing wrong?\nOh, I also did the checksum, it's just fine.\nEDIT\nOk, I've tried several options in the BIOS (enable/disable Legacy OS Boot and Large Disk Access Mode) and... still not working\nI went to test the Live version and tried installing from there. It asked me to unmount partitions, I selected no, and that wouldn't allow me to install inside Windows 7, so I went back and selected yes, showing me again that option. Then I selected the 'Something else' option and there I saw the following info:\nsda ATA SAMSUNG HM321HI\nsda1  ntfs  16106MB   12447MB   Windows Recovery Environment (loader)\nsda2  ntfs  104MB     35MB      Windows 7 (loader)\nsda3  ntfs  151928MB  75593MB\nsda4  ntfs  151930MB  3221MB\nI know these are the partitions of the HDD, sda3 and sda4 being C: and D: respectively. These 4 partitions are ntfs formated, maybe this is what is wrong? Do I have to format sda4 with FAT32 or something? Add a new partition so sda4 becomes a loader sector?\nFor the guy that says I should use Universal USB installer, I have the same problem with it, it restarts for ever. Thanks anyway.\nUPDATE\nFollowing @Sand Dust's comment, I did have 4 partitions, so using the installer I could set the sda4 partition (D:) as free space (un-allocated?)\nAfter reading a lot (lol), I've created 3 partitions manually: / (30GB ext4), /swap (6GB) and /home (96GB ext4). And then... finally! install begun.\nHowever, after restarting, it goes straight to Windows.... right now I'm in the live version and I see the / and /home directories, so I guess the install process went just fine. \nWhat's wrong this time? Could it be something about GRUB? I'm gonna keep reading...\n\nA: So, finally got it solved. The aim of the question was that I couldn't install from the Live-USB, because it restarted over and over again. The problem was the partition of the HD (in Ubuntu terms, the sda device). It had 4 partitions, as @Sand-Dust mentioned, and all 4 of them were primary, with only one of these partitions empty, so there was nowhere to install Ubuntu (since from what I learned, it needs at least 2 partitions to install). The solution then was to ¿un-allocate? the partition sda4 (D:) and create 3 partitions in this now empty free space, all of this partitions being logical. You can do this with the installer, under the 'Something Else' option.\nSo after this, I've got Ubuntu intalled, but when restarting, it didn't show me the OS options, and started Windows... instead of messing with the GRUB, or Boot Repair, I chose to re-install Ubuntu, and now I'm writing from it.\nThanks for the comments and help.\n\nA: Did you format the USB as Fat32? For the boot to work properly, it has to be Fat32.\nAlso, make sure that there are no CD's, other USB's or something like that connected.\n\nA: You should not use UnetBootIn, use Universal USB installer, get it from here:\nhttp://www.pendrivelinux.com/\n", "Q: Realtek 8723AE wi-fi won't connect I have read a few threads and found driver installs for my wi-fi card, but when I built them I get the following message:\nmake -C /lib/modules/3.5.0-17-generic/build M=/home/ian/Desktop/rtl_92ce_92se_92de_8723ae_linux_mac80211_0006.0514.2012 modules\nmake: *** /lib/modules/3.5.0-17-generic/build: No such file or directory.

Not sure if that info helps, but that's what it's doing.\n\nA: As cube rotation with the window is still broken you can use a workaround. In the properties of the cube rotation plugin disable the shortcuts Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Left/Right. Activate Put plugin. Then in its properties, in \"Put to adjacent viewport\" section set your shortcuts for the Left and Right viewports.\nInstead of moving to new viewport with the window simultaneously now the window will move to new viewport and then the viewport will promptly follow the window. Almost the same functionality.\nBTW, activation of some plugins in my system (Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS, GNOME Classic session and Compiz 0.9.7.12-0ubuntu2) with ccsm crushed my Compiz and cleared all checkboxes of my active plugins. Put was among them. In order to activate this plugin in more safe way you can edit the file ~/.gconf/apps/compiz-1/general/screen0/options/%gconf.xml and add into it some lines directly:\n<li type=\"string\">\n    <stringvalue>put</stringvalue>\n</li>\n\nThen reboot your system.\nP.S.

I've recently been having some issues with xmarks and found that it hasn't been syncing my chromium and firefox bookmarks correctly.\nIs there a way to combine the two bookmark HTML files?  Preferably with no overlaps while adding missing bookmarks, but I'd be happy if there was any way I can combine the two bookmark files.\n\nA: Firefox Bookmarks.html Merger is designed to do just this. To get it running in Ubuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install python-pyparsing.\n\n*Download and extract the Python version of FBM.\n\n*Copy the HTML files you want to merge into the extracted folder.\n\n*Run python bookmark_merger.py to automatically detect and merge bookmarks from all HTML files in the current folder.\n\n\nShould that fail, the author has compiled a list of software with similar functionality that might be of use to you.\n\nA: Also, Firefox supports export/import html bookmarks with tags and annotations starting with version 43 (my source and test).

As soon as it starts, the keyboard shortcuts for increasing/decreasing the volume (Fn+F5 and Fn+F6) stop working. (I seem to remember the same thing happening for other games.) Is there a way to make those keys continue to work while the game is running?\n\nA: There is no easy way I know of to do that, as the underlying problem is that fullscreen handling in Linux is fundamentally broken. Essentially the app, or in most cases SDL, grabs your keyboard exclusively and lets no one else use it.\nHowever there are a few ugly workarounds:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://github.com/Grumbel/fullscreen-tools\nThe sdl-hack tool in that repository allows you to force SDL applications into window mode via a LD_PRELOAD hack in case they don't have a switch for that themselves.\nThe windowtool.py on the other side lets you manipulate a window and force it into a non-keyboard grabbing fullscreen window by removing window decorations, set the window to keep-above and position the window. Common use would look something like:\nsleep 1 && windowtool.py -a 1 -d 0  -m 0,0 ACTIVE\n\nYou however still have to manually use xrandr to change the resolution. So this isn't exactly an easy to use or easy to automate solution. But it does give you the results you want, at least for SDL apps.\nPS: Documentation in that repository is quite out of date, sorry for that.\n\nA: I actually came across a very simple solution: Just press shift-tab, which opens the in-game Steam overlay.

This works fine in the GUI version, but in a terminal, I run into issues with the keystroke C-. (Ctrl-.). In a tty, this does nothing, and in terminator or gnome-terminal, this simply inputs a \".\".\nWhat can I do to make it do what it does in the windowed version (show spelling suggestions for a misspelled word)?\nEDIT: In case this matters, I am using Ubuntu 12.04 with Emacs 23.3.1 (which I believe is default from the 12.04 repo).\n\nA: It looks like the important part of this question was already answered in the comments, but to address the root cause in case you're curious, I think ctrl-. doesn't work in a terminal because of some limitations of terminal emulators. In a standard terminal, ctrl is defined to send the ASCII code of the key you press minus 64 (this is why ctrl-J (74) sends newline (10) and ctrl-I (73) sends tab (9), for example). Since the period's ASCII code is 46, subtracting 64 would give -18, which is invalid because it's negative and there are no negative ASCII codes and therefore nothing for emacs to receive and understand.\nWhen you run emacs in windowed mode, the terminal emulator mechanism is bypassed and instead the more robust keyboard handling of X11 is used, which can handle more obscure keystrokes (rather than reducing each keystroke down to one ASCII character, the program receives the original key plus all applicable modifiers, separately). So it's probably impossible to make tty-based emacs handle ctrl-. unless you make custom modifications to your terminal emulator (and probably also emacs).\n\nA: While the above answer gives a good explanation on why it doesn't work, it doesn't really address how to make it work. For iTerm2 you can solve this by adding a key mapping for the escape sequence. I imagine there would be something similar in terminator or gnome-terminal\n", "Q: Switch User, Logout, Lock Screen--All Broken At various times, which I can't pin down exactly, my 12.10 with Unity fails to lock the screen after timeout, fails to log me out when I click Log Out, fails to switch users when I command it, fails to shutdown or restart.\nSometimes I can't log into either of the two profiles that are set up on the machine and have to reboot it.

I've tried 12.10 on this configuration but it was laggy probably due to limited graphics memory. So, I am wondering if I can install 12.04 or any other version that is less hungry for graphics memory.\nIf there are any tricks to make 12.10 run faster please let me know because it wasn't running that bad I think few tweaks could work. The thing that annoyed me was the Dash it was taking around 3-4 seconds to open.\nPlease, tell me if I can make 12.10 work on this configuration or 12.04 is better option.\nThanks.\n\nA: 64MB video memory is plenty for running even the newest version of Ubuntu with all desktop effects.  What's more, 2GB is plenty of main RAM to run a full Gnome/Compiz/Unity graphical desktop.\nIf you are experiencing slow performance it's probably not so much the amount of video memory but the overall performance of the system.  A Pentium 4 is pretty old, your onboard graphics is also probably quite slow, and you may also have a slow hard drive if it's from a similar era.\nAlternatively, it could be that your system is not running in accelerated graphics mode because of a problem with your system, which in 12.10 would mean that you're running software-emulated (which would be slow).\n12.04 and 12.10 are not different enough architecturally that you should notice any significant difference in performance from them on the same hardware.  One notable difference however is that 12.04 has an optional \"Ubuntu 2D\" mode whereas 12.10 doesn't.  Ubuntu 2D may work better on systems without 3D acceleration (or with buggy/poorly supported 3D acceleration) than 12.10.\nThings you could try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Switching from Gnome to XFCE.\nThis can be done by installing Xubuntu, a version of Ubuntu which pre-selects XFCE for you, or by switching desktop environments on an already installed Ubuntu.\nXFCE is a lot more light weight than Gnome, but most of this light weight is in the form of memory and resource usage (and with your 2GB of RAM, that's probably the area where you have the least problems).  So you may or may not notice a huge difference.\n\n*Run Ubuntu 12.04 in Ubuntu 2D mode.\nUbuntu 2D mode has been removed from subsequent versions of Ubuntu.  It is an alternative mode which doesn't make any significant use of graphics hardware, yet still has pretty much the same usability and compatibility with Ubuntu Unity.

To offline installation of some software you will need another machine with same Ubuntu version. If you mean applications settings, than it stored in your home folder.

I just installed Ubuntu 12.04.2 64-bit on my desktop PC and I see the kernel in System Monitor is 3.5.0-23 but in Ubuntu 12.04.2 in my laptop the kernel is 3.2.0-38.\nI have already tried to run the command sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade on my laptop but it doesn't update the kernel.\nHow can I upgrade kernel for my laptop?\n\nA: The simplest set of instructions I always used for kernel upgrade / downgrade are by ubuntuforums.org user by the name of lykwydchykyn (url modified by me for this post):\nGo here: http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/\nDownload 3 (maybe 4) debs to a folder somewhere:\nlinux-headers-VERSION-NUMBER_all.deb\nlinux-headers-VERSION-NUMBER_amd64.deb\nlinux-image-VERSION-NUMBER_amd64.deb\nlinux-image-extra-VERSION-NUMBER_amd64.deb   # if available\n\nInstall the debs with whatever package manager front-end you use (is gdebi still around?), or use these commands:\ncd /path/to/folder/where/you/put/the/debs\nsudo dpkg -i *.deb\n\nSource: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=11391743#post11391743 and https://askubuntu.com/a/142000/133170\n\nA: New deployments of 12.04.2 will be installed with an updated kernel and a new X windows stack.\nFor existing 12.04 deployments, users will need to opt-in to what is being called the LTS Hardware Enablement Stack. If you already have Ubuntu 12.04 installed with an earlier kernel stack, it is recommended that you keep this stack in place rather than switching to a later kernel; the newer kernel and X stacks are provided for enablement of hardware not supported by earlier kernels, and there is generally no reason to upgrade to a newer stack if your hardware is supported by the default kernel.\nIn order to upgrade to the 3.5 kernel on 12.04.2, you will need to run the following command(s):\nFor the new kernel:\nsudo apt-get install linux-generic-lts-quantal\n\nFor the new X stack:\nsudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-lts-quantal\n\nWARNING: If you are using the xorg-edgers PPA, do not install the xserver-xorg-lts-quantal package as this will most likely result in breakage. \nReference: https://launchpad.net/~xorg-edgers/+archive/ppa\nThis is only recommended for x86 hardware installations.\nSee also:\n\n\n*\n\n*The 12.04.2 Release Notes for more details.\n\n*Quantal backported kernel in 12.04.2? What's going on there?\n\n*How to remove Kernel/LTS Enablement Stack?\n\nA: Of course you can install 3.5.0 kernels, run apt-get install linux-image-generic-lts-quantal to install the latest quantal 3.5.0 kernel. This package will ensure that you always have the latest quantal kernel.\nI personally recommend raring's 3.8 (base on upstream 3.8.8) kernel anyway. \nNOTE: search for available 3.5.0 kernels apt-cache search linux-image-3.5.0.\nBTW: You can even manually download latest mainline kernels and install them, for example 3.7.9.

I hated Win 8 so I installed Win 7 over it by deleting my 80gb Windows partition and installing it in there.\nBut now I can't boot Ubuntu up, since obviously Windows has overwritten Grub. Routine stuff, so I booted into a live CD, opened up GParted, and I see that the 80gb space that is supposed to be two 40gb Ubuntu partition is showing up as Unallocated!\nWhat's happened here? Is there a possiblity that there's some error in detecting the partition? I'm 100% sure I didn't delete that partition in the Windows installation process!\n\nA: It's entirely possible that there's a bug in the Windows installer that trashed your partitions, despite your not telling it to do so. Whether it's that or user error, I have two suggestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try another partitioning tool. Most tools in Linux (parted, GParted, etc.) are based on libparted, and so are unlikely to help; but one family that's not is GPT fdisk (gdisk, cgdisk, and sgdisk). These tools also have the advantage of a disk verify function (v from the gdisk main menu, for instance), which can point out errors. gdisk also has options to load the backup partition table, although if a Windows tool trashed the partitions, that probably won't do any good. If you can see the partitions in gdisk or one of its family, but it reports errors, chances are saving the table back (via the w command) will fix the problem. I wouldn't hold out much hope that this will help, but it's worth trying, and it's likely to be safer than the next option, so I recommend trying it first.\n\n*You can use TestDisk from a Linux emergency disk, or similar tools for Windows (I know they exist, but don't have any URLs handy) to scan for your Linux partitions and generate new partition table entries for them. There's a good chance that this will work, although if you've done much partition-juggling, there's a possibility that the tool will recover the wrong partition(s), so be cautious.\n\n", "Q: Why does Ubuntu logins to an Orange Screen?

For example, does each field have to be separated by a single tab? Or any number of tabs?)\nI've set up the mount points for the partitions in the /media directory:\nme@ubuntu:/media$ ls -al\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 root root 4096 Feb 18 09:17 .\ndrwxr-xr-x 23 me   me   4096 Feb 13 10:08 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 me   me   4096 Feb 13 16:03 DATA1\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 me   me   4096 Feb 13 16:03 DATA2\n\nThanks to the entries in the fstab, I can mount the partitions as an ordinary user, without any problems:\nme@ubuntu:/media$ mount DATA1\nme@ubuntu:/media$ mount DATA2\nme@ubuntu:/media$ mount\n/dev/sda1 on / type ext3 (rw,errors=remount-ro)\n/dev/sda2 on /media/DATA1 type ext3 (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev,user=me)\n/dev/sda3 on /media/DATA2 type ext3 (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev,user=me)\n\nBut here's the problem: DATA2 is mounted as root, which means I don't have write permissions for it. Why the difference, and what can I do to ensure DATA2 is mounted with the same permissions as DATA1?\nme@ubuntu:/media$ ls -al\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 root root 4096 Feb 18 09:17 .\ndrwxr-xr-x 23 me   me   4096 Feb 13 10:08 ..\ndrwxrwxrwx 10 me   me   4096 Feb 18 09:20 DATA1\ndrwxr-xr-x  3 root root 4096 Feb 13 13:57 DATA2\n\nFor reference, I'm using Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS. Also, the order in which I mount the partitions has no effect on their permissions; they always have the permissions shown above.\n\nA: As the ext3 file system supports Unix style permissions the permissions stored on the file system are used, just like on your / partition.\nIf you want all the files in DATA2 and its subfolders to belong to the user and group me you can use\nchown -R me:me /media/DATA2\n\nto change the owner.\n", "Q: Is accessing Windows files possibly harmful? I have installed Windows and Ubuntu side by side on my system. I heard that it harmful to the hard disk if we access files ont the Windows partition from Ubuntu. Is this true?\n\nA: Yes, writing to files on a NTFS partition from Ubuntu can possibly harm your Windows installation. There are mainly two reasons for this:\n\n\n*\n\n*When accessed from Ubuntu Windows file permissions are not respected. This means we have full read and write access to files we may had flagged read-only or hidden from Windows. This also includes Windows system files which could be accidentally overwritten or even deleted from Ubuntu.\n\n*When we hibernate Windows or use the Windows fast boot option (which is basically the same) the Windows OS is not aware of any changes we made to files on the drive. This may lead to data loss.\nNevertheless, and because we may need access to file we share from Ubuntu and from Windows it is not generally a bad idea to access files on a NTFS partition. When need to be careful what we do, and we may want to follow one ore more of the following precautions:\n\n\n*\n\n*We may want to mount any Windows partitions as read-only. This has the disadvantage that we are unable to write file from Ubuntu but has the advantage of not being able to accidentally delete or alter files on that drive.  \n\n*Do not hibernate when dual-booting. This also includes that we should not use the Windows fast boot option.\n\n*Keep shared data on a separate partition.\n\n\nA: ubuntu(ext) and window(NTFS) have different kind of partitions , in ubuntu you can mount a windows or NTFS partitons and access your file as a safe way,\nbut if you want to do some modification and change in files so , keep be alert because both have different file saving, storing structure. so when you want to save files , in advanced option choose windows type to save and try to read this article:-\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_file_types\n", "Q: How to properly get screen rotation programmatically?

Ubuntu 12.04.\nOk, I don't know if it's my driver's fault or Ubuntu's fault or mine.\nBut while in Ubuntu my laptop's screen goes all white when not adjusting anything to the screen. I don't know why, or how. I am suspecting it is Ubuntu because when I adjust the brightness it changes the brightness on the white, instead of adjusting Ubuntu's brightness.

You may (partly) overcome this by installing the Voria tools for brightness adjustment from the following ppa:\n\n\n*\n\n*ppa:voria/ppa\nWe are also able to read about these tools on the Voria Forums.\nOn our netbook these issues did not resolve completely, and are mostly present when the power cord is plugged in (i.e. the system does not reduce brightness by default). Then we are only able to reduce the brightness using the keys after having logged in blindly.\nAdditional note: as we observed a dependency of this issue from the lid position we believe there is a (mechanical/electrical?) hardware issue involved.\n", "Q: AMD HP Laptop - Screen Tearing I recently defenestrated this laptop and I'm having some issues with the graphics.\nI'm seeing some pretty nasty screen tearing on this thing. I didn't notice any while the machine had windows 8 (a brief amount of time, admittedly) which leads me to suspect some kind of driver issue.\nGoogling led me to some tearing issues from ATI drivers and the new version of X but since most posts are a bit dated I don't know if that is what is happening to me.\nThe machine is a g6-2211nr model with an AMD A4-4300 APU and it's running 12.10.\nThe computer details dialog is showing \"Driver: Unknown\"\nAny ideas?\nEDIT:\nI installed the proprietary drivers. Upon reboot I reached the login screen and it looks flawless. However, after accessing my account, I can only see the desktop background and the mouse pointer. Nothing else.\nI successfully reset everything. I'm back in but the screen tearing is back. I checked to see if the tearing appears during the login screen with this \"working\" configuration that uses the opensource drivers and no, tere is no tearing during the login screen no matter how hard I try to bring it about.\nHere is the output of lshw -c video right now:\n*-display               \ndescription: VGA compatible controller\nproduct: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] nee ATI\nvendor: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] nee ATI\nphysical id: 1\nbus info: pci@0000:00:01.0\nversion: 00\nwidth: 32 bits\nclock: 33MHz\ncapabilities: pm pciexpress msi vga_controller bus_master cap_list rom\nconfiguration: driver=radeon latency=0\nresources: irq:48 memory:e0000000-efffffff ioport:3000(size=256) memory:f0300000-f033ffff\n\nAside from a fix, isn't there a way to just turn off hardware acceleration altogether? Just CPU render the whole thing?\n\nA: Have you installed the proprietary AMD graphics drivers? If you haven't you should do that. Many AMD cards don't work very well with the included open source driver.\nIf you are on Ubuntu 12.10, open the Ubuntu Software Center, go to Preferences -> Software Sources and look under the \"Additional Drivers\" tab. Check out this answer.\nIf you use Ubuntu 12.04, start the \"Additional Drivers\" untility directly from the dash. (Just type \"drivers\" or \"jockey\") Guide here.\nBTW, AMD drivers are a lot more stable on 12.04. So if you don't already use that and don't get it fixed on 12.10, you might consider using 12.04.\n", "Q: Virtual installation: where to find the ISO I'm running windows 7 on my computer (64-bit) and I need to install Ubuntu 12.10 (kernel: 3.5.0-17-generic) virtually. \nI've installed VirtualBox from Oracle but I can't find the iso image for this Ubuntu version. Plus, I've read that there are certain procedures in order to install and write C/C++ programs (some people said that installing eclipse was a problem and others said that the GCC compiler was a problem) and that it's not as simple as windows. \nSo would anyone please tell me where to find the iso image and what steps should I do to successfully start writing parallel programs on Ubuntu.\n\nA: First set up the virtual machine (VM), and download a suitable ISO file from the Ubuntu download page. Personally, I would recommend sticking with a LTS release, in this case Ubuntu 12.04. Mount the ISO file as the VM's optical disk and install from there.   \nBoot the new VM, login, open a terminal and type:\nsudo apt-get install build-essential\n\nThat will set up the basic things you need in order to compile and build packages on Ubuntu.\nNext, install Eclipse from a downloaded archive or (even easier) from the package.\nYou asked about Eclipse, but you might also want to give the Netbeans IDE a try, which also offers a similar cross-platform IDE experience.\n", "Q: Cannot receive UPower signals I am newbie in dbus, so please be patient with me.\nI have a following code:\nhttp://pastebin.com/8zpM7Pwb. \nIt is some sample I found and changed to suit my case.\nGeneral idea is to 'trap' dbus signals from com.canonical.Unity.Panel.Service and from org.freedesktop.UPower (mainly the second one - I use Panel only as comparison). The problem is that I am receiving Unity Panel signals, but none from UPower. I did launch dbus-monitor in second terminal in the same time, so I know for sure, that those signals do fly around.\nI did also testing on those interfaces one by one and the result is the same - code with Unity Panel interface gets signals I want, code with UPower doesn't - it simply blocks on dbus_connection_read_write(conn, -1); and never goes on.\nCan anyone show me where am I making mistake?\n\nA: Instead of DBUS_BUS_SESSION I should have used DBUS_BUS_SYSTEM, as interface org.freedesktop.UPower doesn't send signals in session scope.\nAs simple as that.\n", "Q: Lose Internet When Connected to Trendnet Ethernet Switch I just installed Ubuntu 12.10 on about 30 computers at a high school computer lab (and deleted Win XP and Win 7). The problem that I have now is that we are unable to access the internet over our network.\nThe school has an aDSL router and a single ethernet cable that comes to the computer lab.  This cable connects to a 24 port Trendnet Ethernet Switch.  Half of the computers are connected to this switch.  Another ethernet cable goes from this switch to an identical switch across the lab giving internet access to the other half of the computers. I did not set up the network this way, but it used to work when the computers had windows loaded on them.  After installing ubuntu we no longer have internet connectivity over the network.\nWhen I connect the ethernet cable from the aDSL router directly to one of the computers the internet works properly, but when I connect it to the switch we get nothing.  Ubuntu does not even assign local ip addresses to the computer when set to automatic DHCP.  I tried setting manual ip addresses outside the DHCP range: I set the ip address to 192.168.1.101 through 192.168.1.130.  I set the gateway to 192.168.1.1, the subnet mask to 255.255.255.0 and the DNS router to 192.168.1.1. I later switched the DNS router to opendns's ip addresses.  \nSetting the ip addresses manually did allow me to ping computers on the local network as long as the were on the same switch.  It would time out if the computer were on the other switch or if they were outside the local network and still no internet access. \nI also tried restarting the router and the switches with no luck.\nDoes anyone have any suggestions about how to access the internet over our local network and how to network the computers across both switches?\nEDIT:\nHere is what the syslog gives me:\ncomputer8 dbus[835]: [system] Successfully activated service 'org.freedesktop.PolicyKit1'\nFeb 19 16:18:59 computer8 NetworkManager[902]:    SCPlugin-Ifupdown: init!\nFeb 19 16:18:59 computer8 NetworkManager[902]:    SCPlugin-Ifupdown: update_system_hostname\nFeb 19 16:18:59 computer8 NetworkManager[902]:    SCPluginIfupdown: management mode: unmanaged\nFeb 19 16:18:59 computer8 NetworkManager[902]:    SCPlugin-Ifupdown: devices added (path: /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:05.0/0000:02:00.0/net/eth0, iface: eth0)\nFeb 19 16:18:59 computer8 NetworkManager[902]:    SCPlugin-Ifupdown: device added (path: /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:05.0/0000:02:00.0/net/eth0, iface: eth0): no ifupdown configuration found.\nFeb 19 16:18:59 computer8 NetworkManager[902]:    SCPlugin-Ifupdown: devices added (path: /sys/devices/virtual/net/lo, iface: lo)\nFeb 19 16:18:59 computer8 NetworkManager[902]:    SCPlugin-Ifupdown: device added (path: /sys/devices/virtual/net/lo, iface: lo): no ifupdown configuration found.\nFeb 19 16:18:59 computer8 NetworkManager[902]:    SCPlugin-Ifupdown: end _init.\nFeb 19 16:18:59 computer8 NetworkManager[902]: <info> Loaded plugin ifupdown: (C) 2008 Canonical Ltd.

Whether this is because the usb connection has been lost, or for some other reason I am not sure... I assume the virtual machine can run 'in the background' whilst I go back to working in ubuntu, so am guessing that it is something to do with the USB connection, hence me posting here, but realise it may be a VMWare or postureminder issue. \nThanks in advance for any help - much appreciated.\nRon\n\nA: We can not help you on issues from your Windows software, and how this software may deactivate your webcam when it thinks you are away from keyboard.\nIt may however be worth to install the Guest Additions to allow a much better desktop integration of the guest Windows with the host Ubuntu. Also read this question and answers here on USB integration with Virtual Box. You may want to try out if a USB filter gives you a better result, but I doubt it will change much.\nUSB devices routed to the guest OS will be deactivated from host access.

Unetbootin does not recognize my SD card.\nIs there any alternative software to write a .iso file to an SD card?\nI'm not trying to write a Ubuntu .iso, so Startup Disk Creator wont work..\n\nA: You can use dd to write the image to any drive. First find out what your SD card is called. sudo fdisk -l lists all storage devices. Find you SD card. It should be called something like /dev/sdx where x is any letter.

I installed virtualbox on a newer Macbook Pro, and re-installed Ubuntu + Phone SDK.    Now the demo app works, so my problem may have been trying to run on too old a machine.\n\nA: The problem is that the Ubuntu SDK makes use of OpenGL ES to render widgets, because it can use hardware accelerated graphics for it even on mobile devices.  VirtualBox, however, doesn't currently support OpenGL ES in it's virtual GPU, so it can't run any Ubuntu SDK apps.\n\nA: For me , the black box was an error in the code , usually the UI part, look in the debug Qt Creator gives you and make sure you are using QML Scene (just to double check)\n\nA: As far as I can see on the page of the currency converter app you need Ubuntu 12.10 instead of 12.04 (which I think is quite awkward btw).\nI would start with upgrading to 12.10 and then try again..\nGood luck!\nps.

I edited the MongoDB config file to store it's data in /home/user/data/mongod.\nBut data is still written to the old directory, supposedly because the permissions to the new folder are not granted - how can I give MongoDB the necessary permissions for that directory?\n\nA: To change the location used by MongoDB to store its data, you need to:\n\n*\n\n*Edit /etc/mongod.conf and change the line dbpath=/var/lib/mongodb to the path that you desire, e.g. dbpath=/home/user/data/mongodb\n\n*Update the permissions of your chosen path to allow the mongodb user to write to it, e.g. chown $USER -R /home/user/data/mongodb\n\n*Restart the MongoDB service by running sudo service mongod stop then sudo service mongod start\nNote that if you have any data in the old location that you want to keep, you'll need to stop the MongoDB service first, manually move the files and then start the service again.\nTo stop the MongoDB server use sudo service mongod stop\nNOTE 2\nto run and manage your mongod process, you will be using your operating system's built-in init system.

In the device section of the xorg.conf, you can force the system not to use the edid information. \nSection \"Device\"\n<..>    \n Option         \"UseEDID\"   \"FALSE\"\nEndSection\n\nAnother reason for the opcode error can be that the video driver does not allow non-edid modes (this is actually the default for current NVidia drivers). You might disable EDID as per above and that would work, but that is not optimal if your EDID information is actually correct, since you will lose things like monitor size information (expect wrong font sizes) and the default EDID modes reported by your monitor. Instead, use the following:\n Option         \"ModeValidation\"   \"AllowNonEdidModes\"\n\nAnother benefit with ModeValidation is that it allows more fine grained control (per output in case of multi-monitor setups); look in the NVidia driver readme for more information.\n\nYou can then add the modeline to Section \"Monitor\" \nSection \"Monitor\"\nIdentifier     \"Monitor0\"\nVendorName     \"Unknown\"\nModelName      \"CRT-0\"\nHorizSync       28.0 - 55.0\nVertRefresh     43.0 - 72.0\nOption         \"DPMS\"\nModeline    \"1920x1080_59.00\"  {bunch of numbers from cvt} -hsync +vsync\nEndSection\n\nand the mode to Section \"Screen\".\nSubSection     \"Display\"\n    Depth       24\n    Modes      \"1920x1080_59\"\nEndSubSection\n\n\nA: For anyone else finding this in Google years later like myself, adding the following lines to your xorg.conf will disable all of the necessary checks to allow you to set any unsupported resolution on newer NVIDIA graphics cards (useful for virtual displays).\nUnder Section \"Screen\":\nOption         \"UseEDIDFreqs\" \"False\"\nOption         \"ModeValidation\" \"NoDFPNativeResolutionCheck,NoVirtualSizeCheck,NoMaxPClkCheck,NoHorizSyncCheck,NoVertRefreshCheck,NoWidthAlignmentCheck AllowNonEdidModes\"\n\nthen add the mode using the results from cvt and you're good to go!

From where can I download Ubuntu SDK for mobile application development? I can not find any links.\n\nA: The installation instructions for the Ubuntu SDK can be found at the Ubuntu App Developer Site. The guide currently only supports Ubuntu as the installation host, but since the SDK is based on Qt5 and QtQuick 2.0 you should be able to port (integrate) it yourself to other platforms after installing Qt5 (see the Qt5 Download Page).\nThe problem is that you won't be able to test the full functionality of your applications yet, as on the desktop you'll need to run the them using Qt's QML viewer (qmlscene), which can run the QML based layout, the JavaScript based actions and the Qt backend, but it could not emulate the behaviour of the application within the Ubuntu environment. \nThere might be an emulator in the future, but it isn't clear yet when it will be released and if there will be a Windows version of it.\nSo I think the best solutions for you are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Wait for the first open release version of the Ubuntu Touch Developer Preview and try to run it within a virtual machine (I don't know if this is possible).\n\n*Install Ubuntu in a virtual machine and develop there.\n\n*Drop windows and install the latest Ubuntu OS. \n\n*Try to install the Ubuntu Touch Developer Preview on a developer board like the BeagleBone or Pandaboard and use this for development.\n\n\n(I would prefer the third point!)\n", "Q: cannot detect spotify lens today I installed spotify on ubuntu 12.04.

This has subtly different behaviour from maximise (it should now show over any other UI) but should also keep focus. Failing that, you could always script something separately to give the window focus with xdotool (or another similar tool).\nFailing that, you could just stick a sleep 10; in before the gnome-terminal command. The delay caused would likely mean that nothing grabbed the focus back off the term.\nBut perhaps Gnome is the problem here. If this is a single-purpose machine, you might do better to dump the Gnome and its window manager completely. You could either fly solo and build a dirty little nodm environment (just nodm, and an ~/.xsession file to run your terminal), or go for a tiling window manager (awesome, xmonad, etc) that is better purposed for terminal-priority things.\n", "Q: Factory restore?

After this ubuntu can no longer recognize the plugged monitor (doesn't even show up on the display settings) and the laptop monitor is shown as 'unknown'.\nI tried installing the nvidia recommended drivers and tried to use the nvidia tool to set up the monitors. I was able to put the image only on the external monitor, but when I unplug it I get no image at all on my laptop.\nAfter this I tried a lot of uninstalling and reinstalling ubuntu with no success, though the funny thing is that I found out that if I start ubuntu in a bootable pen (that 'try ubuntu' option) it works fine, it detects the displays properly.\nBetween this and all the OS reinstalls I managed to render my Windows7 unbootable and though I now have fixed that, right now I don't have ubuntu installed and I'm hopping that if I install wubi again I might solve this problem, though I would like to know if there is something I could try if I actually reinstall it again or if I better just install wubi and use some workaround to increase it's space.\nIt seems like a joke that such a simple task as plugging a screen can give so many problems to solve.\nThanks for any help you can provide.\n\nA: Wubi shouldn't be any different to a normal install. You may reinstall it and find that it doesn't work either. I think it'd be better to just work on your actual problem. In my opinion.\nIf you do go with Wubi, then I'd recommend synchronized, real time backups. Any data stored on the virtual disk is contained within a single file and it's a higher risk running a loop file system than on a partition.\nThe only differences between Wubi and a normal install is I believe you get the option to install closed source drivers during the normal install. \nOne last thing, if you still have that working Wubi install backed up, you can migrate it to a normal install (from the root.disk) and that gives you an identical install to your Wubi install, except no virtual disk.\n", "Q: OpenVPN fails from Network Manager, seems to connect from terminal, but no traffic to or from target network I'm new to Ubuntu (as in, last week!) and really liking the system, but am having a real problem getting the OpenVPN connection to work.\nMy system:\n\n\n*\n\n*DELL XPS L702X, 8Gb RAM, tested with both WiFi and wired connection.\n\n*Ubuntu 12.10, updates current.\n\n*OpenVPN + the Gnome-openvpn network manager added.\n\n\nI have a pre-existing configuration and associated certificates + keys from my Win7 install, which I have copied first to /home/documents and then (after a bit of reading around) to /etc/openvpn (using sudo).\nThat configuration and key set has been working successfully for several years on Windows with OpenVPN 2.2.x.

For a fresh Ubuntu 12.10 install  I additionally installed the fglrx video graphics drivers, on reboot I log in and would get just a desktop wall paper image with no Unity desk top. Unity also fails to start from the command line.  This was very repeatable. I looked at the package dependencies for the Radeon fglrx drivers and checked they were all present using Synaptic. I noted two Kernel packages were missing. Installing these packages following a fresh 12.10 install, enabled trouble free install of the fglrx and then fglrx updates graphics drivers. The two kernel packages missing were:\n\n\n*\n\n*linux-generic  3.5.0.17.19\n\n*linux-headers-generic  3.5.0.17.19\n\n\nsee: http://www.divnut.com/Ubuntu/Screenshot_12p10_install_vrs_manifest.png\nHaven't logged this as a bug yet as I'm not sure what to log it against, still investigating.\n", "Q: Can't boot into ubuntu 12.10 after installing on an UEFI system I have Sony VIAO SVS13112ENB which has a Insyde H2O bios with UEFI and enabled. It came with Windows 7 and then i upgraded it to Windows 8. Now I am trying to install and run Ubuntu with dual boot. I used LiveUSB to install Ubuntu.\nWhen I reboot and boot into USB, i see this message: \"Secure boot is not enabled\" for a second, then i get grub-like option to \"try without installing\", \"Install Ubuntu\", \"OEM installation\" and \"disk check\" options. I carry along to install Ubuntu.\nI created new partitions for root and swap, and used the already existing EFI partition. The installation wen't normal but when it is done is when i'm facing problem, when it reboots Windows 8 boots up like nothing ever happened.\nI know ubuntu still have issues with UEFI. Was anyone able to overcome this?\nAm I missing anything here?\nPlease Help Me, I need to install Ubuntu on my laptop.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Some computers have buggy EFI implementations that either \"forget\" the EFI's boot loader NVRAM entries (which normally hold the order in which boot loaders are tried) or that ignore entries other than those for Windows. In such cases, you need to do a workaround, which typically involves moving and renaming files so that the Ubuntu boot loader is installed where the Windows boot loader resides. There are several ways to do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can use the Ubuntu Boot Repair tool. This should make the changes automatically; however, it does so by renaming the existing Windows entry in a way that could cause confusion or further problems down the road.\n\n*You can download the bootable USB flash drive or CD-R image of rEFInd, use that to boot Linux, install the Debian-package version of rEFInd within Ubuntu, and then type sudo mvrefind.sh /boot/efi/EFI/refind /boot/efi/EFI/Microsoft/Boot. This will cause rEFInd, rather than GRUB, to come up as your default boot loader, and you should then be able to launch Ubuntu either directly or via GRUB.\n\n*You can do it manually by mounting your EFI System Partition (ESP), moving its EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi file down one directory, copying EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi to EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi, and adjusting your GRUB configuration to launch the Windows boot loader from its new location. This is obviously both more tedious and more likely to create problems because of a user error than either of the previous two options; but if you know what you're doing (or want to learn), you might prefer to take manual control of it.\n\n\nThere are other possible solutions, particularly if my diagnosis that you've got one of these buggy EFI implementations is incorrect. For instance, you might need to run efibootmgr (with suitable options for your installation) manually from an Ubuntu emergency disc. It's also conceivable that there's a firmware update available that fixes the bug.\n", "Q: How do I download steam? What additional software do I need?

I'm on Ubuntu 12.04, and trying to connect my Samsung galaxy Gio (Model # GT-S5660M) with Android 2.3.4 (GINGERBREAD_MR1). When I plug my phone in,via USB, it will charge, however Ubuntu will not recognize it in any other way. I tried the MTP programs in the software center however they both turned out to be of no use (neither detected the phone).\nSo my question is, How can I make it so I can, at least, transfer audio and videos to the micro SD in my phone with out removing it and using an adapter?\n\nA: I am using Android 4.0.4 with Sony experia.This solution work out for me.\nOpen a terminal in ubuntu 12.04\nthen \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:langdalepl/gvfs-mtp\nsudo apt-get update\n\nthen open software update and install available updates.\nThen restart the system and after restart your Android phone internal data storage will be listed in the devices automatically.\nYou can find out detailed information on this link\n\nA: On stock Ubuntu 12.04, MTP support has many issues with Android phones. There's a PPA available, that brings better MTP support to 12.04.\n\nA: I know the topic is a bit old but I just want to add couple words from my own experience. I am running Xubuntu 12.04 and Thunar as default file manager on it. I had Samsung GT-5500 on Android 2.2 and there was no troubles with the files transfer at all. Couple days ago I changed it to Alcatel One Touch 4030x and Android 4.1.1 Jelly Bean, and when I connected it to my laptop it did not come up. \nWhen I checked lsusb I found it as: \n\nBus 002 Device 009: ID 1bbb:0167 T & A Mobile Phones\n\nThe funny think was a fact, I could add this USB device to my Windows 7 virtual machine as external USB and Windows recognised it, and installed required drivers automatically.\nLinks and syntax above from shailendra are very useful, but in my example it did not resolved this problem completely. What I did was to install Nautilus file manager and change it to the default system file manager. Now, when I connect my mobile it come up every time and I can see it as:\n\nDevices -> MT65xx Android Phone with path mtp://[usb:002,009]/\n  (screenshot here)\n\nbut there is some other issue as well. I have to have my screen unlocked when I do that. Otherwise it will come up, but when I click on device it does not show any SD cards. It's empty. I hope my tips will helps somebody else. Good luck  \n\nA: With Ubuntu 12.04 I could not connect to my vanilla Android 4.1.1 tablet as a USB storage device, to copy files between my computer and the tablet. I followed the advice here without success. Running lsusb in the computer's terminal showed that the tablet was connected as a device (and the USB cable was probably OK), but gMPT reported 'unable to open raw device'.\nMaybe what I wanted to do is not what you want to do, or your Adroid device may be different than mine, but here is how I got Ubuntu 12.04 to treat my tablet as a USB drive, copying files (both ways), deleting files, and managing directories, etc. in the tablet.\nStep 1. remove mtp-tools mtpfs gmtp from Ubuntu (something like sudo apt-get remove mtp-tools mtpfs gmtp); when this was installed Step 2 did not make any difference.\nStep 2. in the Android tablet (not Ubuntu) go to Settings then to Developer Options and turn ON 'USB debugging' so a check mark is shown next to this option - at least on my tablet.\nThen I plugged the USB cable from the tablet into my computer. The tablet's memories, internal and installed micro flash drive, were accessible on the computer's desktop.\n", "Q: The Ubuntu installer can't see the Windows 8 partition during installation I tried to install Ubuntu 12.10 alongside Windows 8, but when I get to the installation type screen I don't have any option for installing alongside Windows 8.

IP addresses are dynamically assigned, so I can't rely on \"traditional\" ping.\n\nA: If you know the MAC address then you can ping it with arping\n\nA: The easiest solution is to check the DHCP server's logs, if you have access to them.\nOtherwise, you can use the traditional ping command to broadcast ping the local LAN and look in your system's local ARP table to see if your target host has replied. This does not require knowing the target's IP address, only its MAC. Example:\nping=`which ping`\niface=eth0 # MAYBE CHANGE THIS\nbcast=`ip a ls $iface | awk '/inet? /{ print $4 ; exit }'`\ncmd=\"$ping -bnrc1 $bcast\"\ntarget_mac='00:11:22:33:44:55' # DEFINITELY CHANGE THIS\nif [[ -u $ping ]] ; then $cmd ; else sudo $cmd ; fi\ngrep $target_mac /proc/net/arp\n\nThis is similar to 'arping' in that it should trigger an ARP reply, only it's noisier. For this reason, add '-r' to limit it to the local LAN, use the directed broadcast address (that awk snippet grabs it, but you may need to adjust 'iface') instead of '255.255.255.255', and send only one ICMP echo request with '-c1'. Turn off reverse DNS resolution with '-n'.\n'ping' will only honor the '-b' broadcast option if it is setuid root or you have root privileges, so I've wrapped it in an if/else to catch that.\n\nA: You need to actively monitor traffic in order to do this. Look at arpalert or arpwatch. arping is also an option but it won't work in this case because it needs the target ip address.\n", "Q: get dpkg --get-selections equivalent list from dpkg.status.0 My SSD crashed, and I can't find the output from dpkg --get-selections that I created recently. \nHowever, I could make a copy of the /var/backups/dpkg.status.0 file from the broken ssd. I feel like all the information, that dpkg --get-selections gave me is in there, but in the wron format. And I feel like, there must be a command, that allows to convert it (rather that writing a script myself).\nQuestion: What is that command? \n\nA: Basically from what im thinking is that all applications in /var/backups/dpkg.status.0 have install ok installed line so you will only have to use this command to get same output of dpkg --get-selections: grep \"Package\" < /var/backups/dpkg.status.0 | awk '{print $2\"\\t\\tinstall\"}'. Check it.\n\nA: First, you check where dpkg --get-selections is getting it's raw data from. If you suspect it's getting the data from /var, then you can further narrow down the results with a grep. Like this:\nstrace dpkg --get-selections 2>&1 | grep /var\n\nThat will produce the following result:\nopen(\"/var/lib/dpkg/updates/\", O_RDONLY|O_NONBLOCK|O_DIRECTORY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3\nopen(\"/var/lib/dpkg/available\", O_RDONLY) = 3\nopen(\"/var/lib/dpkg/triggers//File\", O_RDONLY) = 3\nstat(\"/var/lib/dpkg/triggers/Unincorp\", {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=0, ...}) = 0\n\nThen, if you wonder where that dpkg backup file came from, you can search your cron files for mentions of dpkg:\n grep -R dpkg /etc/cron*\n\nFrom that, you could figure out that /var/backup/dpkg.status.0 was first backed up and then rotated, based on /var/lib/dpkg/status.\nPutting the above together, you get dpkg --get-selections to produce the report you want, by temporarily restoring your \"dpkg status\" file back to /var/lib/dpkg/status and then running dpkg --get-selections. It will now reference your backup data. \n", "Q: How do you purge a manual install completely? When I install have needed to install packages manually by running ./program or make or whatever. I (unsurprisingly) cannot purge such programs using apt-purge to get rid of them. \nI want to know how to do it. Even if it is only a long winded process. How do I find out where an install placed all its files so I can manually delete them at least?\n\nA: Well first attempt is to try make uninstall, which might get you some of the way.\nOtherwise one way that you can do this is to completely wipe the package with make distclean and then build it all again, but this time passing a --prefix=/tmp/install.  After you run the make install this time around you will see all of the packages in /tmp/install rather than in /  This will give you a list of files you can work on to remove from the root directory.\nThere are some other options; make checkinstall might give you details of which files go where but then again it may not.  The above process will guarantee that you know what is written where during the install process.\n", "Q: How to make rsync run automatically when a new file or directory is added? I decided to use rsync for backing up my downloaded torrents from my home-server to my laptop.

This won't happen if those libraries weren't already installed when you installed Bumblebee, hence needing a re-installation. It shouldn't affect your bumblebee configuration either, though it's obviously worth checking after you've done this.\n\nA: I'm not sure if this'll help clarify or not but I had the same issue with skype and libGL.so.1.

I'm wondering if there is a difference between going to a terminal and typing ln -s path 'path or just right clicking on something and selecting make link. \n\nA: No, there isn't. It's just Nautilus GUI option to create a symlink.\n\nA: There is very little difference. To test this I created a new directory with a file \"bug3.odt\".\nI then created two links to it using the command line\nln -s bug3.odt bug_ln and ln -s /home/warren/qaz/bug3.odt bug_ln2 then finally went into nautilus and created a link by right clicking on the file and selecting \"Make Link\".\nThe result was as follows\nwarren@dell:~/qaz$ ls -la\ntotal 36\ndrwxrwxr-x  2 warren warren  4096 Feb 18 20:14 .\ndrwxr-xr-x 69 warren warren 12288 Feb 18 20:11 ..\n-rw-rw-r--  1 warren warren 18505 Nov 12 20:11 bug3.odt\nlrwxrwxrwx  1 warren warren     8 Feb 18 20:12 bug_ln -> bug3.odt\nlrwxrwxrwx  1 warren warren    25 Feb 18 20:14 bug_ln2 -> /home/warren/qaz/bug3.odt\nlrwxrwxrwx  1 warren warren    25 Feb 18 20:13 Link to bug3.odt -> /home/warren/qaz/bug3.odt\n\nAs you can see both bug_ln2 and Link to bug3.odt have the same owner, group, permissions and link to the same location.  Right clicking in nautilus is equivalent to using ln -s with the full path to the file.\nIt is also possible to create a link by holding down CTRL+SHIFT and dragging the file.

One annoyance I noticed in Ubuntu, however, is that switching between using the touch screen vs the mouse causes the cursor to jump. At first I thought it might be remembering the mouse position for each device separately (e.g. when I touch the screen the cursor moves from point A to B, but then using the touchpad would cause it to return to A first before moving) but this is not the case.\nWhat it actually seems to do is move down and to the right a bit when switching back to the touchpad after touching the screen somewhere. These seems pretty consistent anywhere on the screen.\nI haven't been able to find any other mention of this. Any ideas what might be going on?\nEdit: For reference, the following is the xinput list output for the pointing devices.

This required no effort on my part (except updating I suppose).\n\nA: Am I wrong if I guess at the moment of time you were referring at the second paragraph:\n\nAt first I thought it might be remembering the mouse position for each device separately [...]\n\nYou were using Unity but then you changed to Gnome and thus changed your mind about the behaviour?\nI also own a touchscreen laptop and I'm running Ubuntu 12.10 x64. Using Unity I can leave the mouse in a specific point, let's call it point A, then tap or drag on the screen in a completely different and random point in the screen and no matter what when I move my mouse (or trackpad) the pointer will begin it's movement from A.\nHowever while using Gnome (3.6.2) the behaviour gets buggy. If I leave the pointer at A using the mouse/touchpad, then tap/drag in the screen to a final point B and then get to the mouse again the pointer will most of the times jump from B to a lower-right position as you described and in some cases it will start from A as in Unity.\nI heard Canonical updated the touchscreen drivers in Ubuntu 12.10 and I guess they updated their desktop environment to suit these updates too. For me when I want to use the touchcreen I load Unity as in Gnome is mostly useless.\nCheers.\n\nA: This isn't really an \"answer\" per-se, but I don't get this issue using 14.10.

This goes on for minutes, and soon my dvd drive stops running, and the underscore continues to flash, and will not greet me to the setup screen. I currently have quick boot disabled. \nI know there are problems with the UEFI format. I have downloaded, and burned both secure remix 64 bit, along with the traditional 12.10 64 bit.

Also, do I want mainline or something else?\nThanks!\n\nA: You manually download the kernel you wish to use from http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline\nYou normally need just the kernel image, linux-image-3.7.0-030700-generic_3.7.0-030700.201212102335_amd64.deb for example.\nYou then install it with\ndpkg -i linux-image-3.7.0-030700-generic_3.7.0-030700.201212102335_amd64.deb\n\nand remove it with \nsudo apt-get remove linux-image-3.7.0-030700-generic_3.7.0-030700.201212102335_amd64.deb\n\nPlease note, these kernels are intended for testing / development and come with no support \n\nThe mainline kernels builds are produced for debugging purposes and therefore come with no support.

I need to get/download ttf-mscorefonts and preload please.\n\nA: Open a terminal by pressing CTRL+ALT+T and enter id This lists the groups you belong to.  \nIf you are using Ubuntu 12.04 or later then look for the group sudo in earlier versions the group was admin.  If you are shown as being in this group you are a system administrator and can run commands with administrator privileges.  If not then you will need to ask an administrator to either make you an administrator too or do what you want\nAn administrator can make you one too by running sudo adduser username sudo or sudo adduser username admin as appropriate for the version of Ubuntu you have replacing username with your user name.\nIf you are already an administrator then to run a program with a GUI with admin privileges press ALT+F2 to open the command line and type gksu or gksudo followed by the name of the program you want to run.  For example gksu nautilus runs the filemanager. gksudo is just a link to gksu so both commands are equivalent.\nFor command line applications then prefix the command with sudo you will be asked to enter your password.  There is no feedback when you type but it is being acceped.\nFor the specific example of installing preload the command is\nsudo apt-get install preload\n\nThis is explained in more detail in the RootSudo - Community Ubuntu Documentation\n\nA: Provided you know the package you are looking for, you can use sudo apt-get install x where x is the package you are looking for.\nBasically, for your Preload (for example) you would use:\nsudo apt-get install preload\n\nsudo temporarily gives you root permissions. You may want to read up on https://help.ubuntu.com/10.04/administrative/C/terminal.html or even better use man sudo.\nYou can use the man pages to better understand the commands you use, to help you understand where they will help you.\n\nA: You are completely wrong. You are using a non-administrative account, so you can't install software trough terminal. \nThe reason is because you don't have a sudo password (yes, sudo, not root).\nYou can (if not, you have another problem, new question) install software trough the software center with a sudo password of an administrative user.\nIf you want to have administrative privileges, then you need to add the user in the sudo group.\nYou have to know the difference between sudo and root. Root is not a command, sudo is not a user..\n", "Q: slow server download I'm trying to download the latest LTS server.

Now I'm thinking the best solution (I think?) is to completely remove unity and all it's components to get version 5.10.\n\nOr if you have a different solution just for me to get back my desktop would be great.\nThanks for reading.\n\nA: The latest is unity 5.18.0-0ubuntu2, so that's what you'd get after updating the system. The question is if you still get the undesired behaviour.\nIf what you have is the PPA-provided unity 5.18, maybe you could try changing your last command to:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall unity\nso you get the Ubuntu version of the package to substitute the one from the PPA.\nI do not know how safe it would be to purge the ppa-provided package first, but sure it sounds too dangerous to try unless you know exactly what you are doing.\n\nA: found this question because of the same thing happening to me, so for anyone visiting this question you can also run the following:\nsudo sed -i s/XSession.*/XSession=ubuntu/ /var/lib/AccountsService/users/USERNAME\nwhere USERNAME is your the username of the account, in my case since my account is /home/cyrex I would use:\nsudo sed -i s/XSession.*/XSession=ubuntu/ /var/lib/AccountsService/users/cyrex\nWhat this would do is change the current default Session from the Mir (Unity8) to the default Unity one. Before doing this, the value for the XSession variable was something like unity8-mir-default (I might be wrong with the name), after running this, the value should now be set to ubuntu. Then simply reboot and you should now see the default Unity running.\nAll session values can be found in /usr/share/xsessions/ with a .desktop attached to them, so for unity (Unity 3D) you should see ubuntu.desktop. The name of the session would be ubuntu and this would be the value you would use on the SED script above.

The primary symptom is that apps frequently freeze up, graying out.  I've read that the gray is a visual signal from compiz for apps that have become unresponsive.\nIt happens so often that the machine is basically unusable.  Every time I interact with an X app, e.g. Firefox and Software Center, they will freeze and go gray.  The freeze is system modal: alt-tab doesn't work, so I just have to wait it out.  The mouse usually moves, but sometimes not.  I'd say 90% of the time the mouse is movable.\nI've come to expect waiting at least 30 seconds per freeze before I can use the machine again, often longer.  If I scroll a web page, enter a new URL or use a search engine.  If I search Software Center, install an app.  XTerm is the only exception- it never freezes.\nHeck, I've left this machine sitting next to my desktop while I do other work, and have noticed Firefox will grey out the top window every few minutes!  All on its own, without me even near the machine.\ntop shows that compiz is frequently busy, occupying 40-100% of a core.  I also experimented with disabling OpenGL in compiz's config mgr, thinking that maybe this machine doesn't have a proper accelerated GPU (doubtful) and that it's emulating the accelerated window mgr features, but found no difference in performance.\nI'm about ready to scrap this install, and move to Lubuntu, Mint or some similar lighter distro, in the hopes this situ will improve.\nI installed 12.10 onto a Kingston 16GB thumb drive, changed the BIOS boot order, and boot from that.

By default, stdout and stderr are both output to the tty (your bash prompt) where they are displayed, but you can redirect the output. By default, using >> file will only redirect the standard output (stuff that is printed using echo - this is the usual form of output for most programs. However, when programs wish to put out an error, this will go on the standard error output stream, which (by default) is printed to the terminal, and is NOT redirected using >>. To redirect the error stream as well (perhaps for error logging) you use 2>> file, which will append it to file.

I want one user to have two passwords.\n\nA: There's a much simpler solution to the original question and is the way I run:\n\n\n*\n\n*create one non-admin user\n\n*create an admin user\n\n\nAlways log in as the non-admin user and whenever the non-admin user needs to do anything \"adminy\", just:\nfab-user@fab-ux:/media/Data/Temp\n$ su - fab-root \nPassword: \nfab-root@fab-ux:~\n$ sudo smartctl --all /dev/sdc\n\nYes, it's not what you want but it's what you actually need\n\nA: There is a way to do this by overriding the PAM (Pluggable Authentication Module) settings for the sudo service. Do this at great risk to your machine - don't just copy and paste unless you understand what the command does, and always keep a root terminal open - test test test! - before logging it out, in case you need to go back and fix something.\nI recommend reading some information about how PAM works so you know what to do if it breaks. I also recommend most users approach this problem from a different angle (making a separate user account for administration) because the solution may be susceptible to hash table attacks on your password if you haven't set your permissions correctly.\nIf you're determined to proceed, you'll need to install a new PAM module. pam_pwdfile uses the old-style /etc/passwd type file for authentication, which is great for using different passwords for different services. It provides no account recognition - you can create username/password pairs for users that do not exist on the system. Since we'll be using it for sudo, it doesn't matter, as we'll just let sudo check the account exists in the usual way.\nsudo apt-get install libpam-pwdfile\n\nI also recommend grabbing a handy htpasswd file editor. Benjamin Schweizer has created a handy editor in python which works well. Grab it from http://benjamin-schweizer.de/htpasswd_editor.html and install its dependency:\nsudo apt-get install python-newt\n\nGenerate a htpasswd format file using the tool - sudo python htpasswd_editor sudo.passwd. Put in a username and password using the same username that you will be using for sudo - one for each user that will be using it. Copy it to somewhere secure (when testing this I put it in /etc/sudo.passwd) and make it unreadable to regular users: chmod 660 /etc/sudo.passwd as root.\nMake sure the file is owned by root and unreadable to other users. This is a vulnerability as the file contains a hashed password, and if it is readable or writeable by other users, it breaks your security badly. It is for this reason I don't recommend this method on a machine that must be kept secure.\nFinally, edit the /etc/pam.d/sudo file. Add the following line above the other @include ... lines:\nauth    required    pam_pwdfile.so pwdfile /etc/sudo.passwd\n\nObviously replacing the last argument with the path to your generated htpasswd file. Comment out the next line: #@include common-auth to make sure it is using the new authentication method.\nWord of caution - you will need to edit the /etc/pam.d/sudo file from a root terminal. Do not close this without testing! If you do, you may not be able to log back in (if you have broken something), and would have to boot from a Recovery disk to repair your system. Test before logging out by opening a new terminal and try using sudo. You should find that it will no longer work with your regular login password, but instead requires the new password you used when you generated the passwd file. To update the file, use the useful tool again.\n", "Q: Windows and Ubuntu: Can I have Both?

I was under the impression that upgrading from 32-bit to 64-bit required a new kernel.  This would mean replacing the kernel is all that would be needed.  Perhaps drivers and libraries need to be updated as well, right?  \nThat could also be done in a non-destructive fashion.  But all the other software does not need to be 64-bit specifically compiled does it?  \nSo what then precisely, is the technical reason, why upgrading to 64-bit cannot be done without reformatting with a one-click approach?\n\n\nA: *\n\n*A migration can be done: Migrate a 32-bit debian installation to 64-bit one (i386 to x86_64) but it will not be a one click operation. \n\n*If you re-install using the 64-bit installer and do NOT format the discs you will end up with a 64-bit machine where all (but maybe not all: it will sort of upgrade to newer versions so if there is no newer version ... so it probably is best to do this with a newer release) packages are replaces but the setting files are kept intact.\n\n\n*\n\n*See https://superuser.com/questions/129222/upgrade-ubuntu-from-32-to-64-bit-edition (answer by user swcai). \n\n\n\nBoth methods work but are not newbie friendly. Heck they are not even average user friendly. \nRe-installing is easier, more secure since it is a proven method and makes sure you do not end up with an unstable system (for what ever reason). \n\n--Warning--\nChanging the architecture of your Ubuntu installation from 32 to 64-bit is not recommended or supported in any way.

The server will not start and you can happily use the client without the server. You will also not have GUI access.\n\n\nThe subversion package \n\nincludes the Subversion client (svn), repository administration tools\n  (svnadmin, svnlook) and a network server (svnserve).\n\nInstalling the whole packages (including both server and client) might seem like a lot of overhead, but it is the most easily maintainable solution. You easily get future updates, security releases and more. Also if ever one of your users desperately needs a subversion server, it is only a few commands away. \nUse svn --version for the modules included:\n* ra_neon : Module for accessing a repository via WebDAV protocol using Neon.\n  - handles 'http' scheme\n  - handles 'https' scheme\n* ra_svn : Module for accessing a repository using the svn network protocol.\n  - with Cyrus SASL authentication\n  - handles 'svn' scheme\n* ra_local : Module for accessing a repository on local disk.\n  - handles 'file' scheme\n* ra_serf : Module for accessing a repository via WebDAV protocol using serf.\n  - handles 'http' scheme\n  - handles 'https' scheme\n\nand use svn --help for more information. The available commands illustrate that the subversion package is the way to go.\n   add\n   blame (praise, annotate, ann)\n   cat\n   changelist (cl)\n   checkout (co)\n   cleanup\n   ...\n\nYou could also install svnkit, but that comes with a lot of java dependencies. Here is the official screenshot for the package (you can find it in synaptic):\n\nFor more information read http://svnbook.red-bean.com/ and http://subversion.apache.org.\n\nA: Use RabbitVCS\nRabbitVCS is a set of graphical tools written to provide simple and straightforward access to the version control systems you use. Currently, it is integrated into the Nautilus and Thunar file managers, the Gedit text editor, and supports Subversion and Git, with a goal to incorporate other version control systems as well as other file managers.\nIt is primarily inspired by TortoiseSVN.\nRabbitVCS is Free/Open Source Software written in the Python and is based upon the PyGTK library. \n\nA: When you look what files are installed for the package subversion you'll that the package contains both client and server:\n> dpkg -L subversion\n…\n/usr/bin/svndumpfilter\n/usr/bin/svnserve\n/usr/bin/svnversion\n/usr/bin/svnlook\n/usr/bin/svnrdump\n/usr/bin/svnmucc\n/usr/bin/svnsync\n/usr/bin/svn\n/usr/bin/svnraisetreeconflict\n/usr/bin/svn-rep-sharing-stats\n/usr/bin/svnadmin\n…\n\nSo one possibility is using Post-Invoke to remove the server file after installation.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new file 99remove-svn-server with sudo in directory /etc/apt/apt.conf.d.\n\n*Add the following line\nDPkg::Post-Invoke {\"if [ -e /usr/bin/svnserve ]; then rm /usr/bin/svnserve; fi\";};\n\nEvery time you use apt-get (or other installation methods), it will call the script after finishing its actions. This small scripts looks if svnserve exists and if yes, removes the file.\n\nA: Subversion package includes svn (Subversion client) also. So you don't need to worry. If you want a GUI use Rabbit.\n\nA: As dedunumax said, the subversion package includes both client and server, but according to another answer on askubuntu (How do I install svn?) the server (daemon) is not started by default.\nTheoretically this should mean that installing the subversion package should be all you need to do on client machines.\n", "Q: Set audio output device per application Is it possible to configure PulseAudio, so that some applications route audio through the headphones, other applications go to the main speakers, and some applications go to both (as it does now)?\n\nA: go to (ubuntu software center) and search (PulseAudio volume control) or (PulseAudio)\nand go terminal and put (alsamixer) \n", "Q: Cannot download Ubuntu 12.10 from the Site When I am trying to download Ubuntu 12.10 32-bit, it is asking for a username and password of gluh.nith.ac.in\nThank You\n\nA: have you tried alternative downloads:\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/alternative-downloads\nor the torrent:\nhttp://releases.ubuntu.com/12.10/ubuntu-12.10-desktop-i386.iso.torrent\n\nA: go to (http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/thank-you?release=latest&bits=32&distro=desktop&status=zeroc) will download ubuntu 12.10 \nwill start download iso 32 bit \n\nA: you can simply download an ISO file for ubuntu and then install it using wubi.exe if you are installing on win machine.\n", "Q: apt-get broken on kubuntu 12.04 I just wanted to add my little stone, so I tried to do an install of \"wine\" on a Kubuntu installed on my laptop (amd64 quad proc, 12.04, strictly and regularly updated and maintained) which leads directly to a load of apt problems.\nIn addition, I have now 4 different instances of graphics apps for package/software maintenance, all in submenu K/system : software update, muon software manager, Ubuntu software center, muon update manager.

I installed Ubuntu using the in-Windows installer on my Windows 7. Ubuntu was (and still is) slightly sluggish.\nBy sluggish I mean, the OS GUI is perfectly responsive, but an App's GUI sometimes just hangs/freezes for a second, while the rest works, but the app itself can't be accessed (happens with Google Chrome mostly, but other applications suffer, too) and it fixes itself after a few seconds.\nI recently installed Windows 8 and it appears to be the same.\nAnother problem I am experiencing is that, when I try to boot it up, from the Windows 8 boot menu, it doesn't work right away. I have to select Ubuntu, and then I need to reboot the laptop (long press the power button on this laptop), which then automatically skips the Windows 8 boot menu and goes to the Ubuntu login screen. Also, it takes a really long while while it loads up and gets to the login screen (at first it's just staring purple/pink for around 20 seconds, and then when the logo and that load indicator appear, it is loading for 2 to 5 minutes).\nI really love using linux for development (since I don't have to constantly use git to test it). But, this sluggishness is really getting in the way. :(\n\nA: That's because the Wubi installation of Ubuntu is not \"the real thing\". Disk IO is much slower.\nSee the answer to this question\nI never understood the appeal of Wubi. Install the OS as an actual OS. Put the .iso on a dvd or flash drive and install it next to your windows install. As it stands now, your Ubuntu is pretty much an app running inside Windows. (I exaggerate a bit here)\nOnce you've installed Ubuntu properly, you realize that the sluggishness is on the Windows side of things.\n\nA: It's not normal for you to have to hard power off your computer in order to boot into your Ubuntu installed with Wubi. With Windows 8, the Boot Manager automatically restarts the computer when you select to boot into another OS due to the way that Windows 8 automatically implements 'fast-start'. Fast-start means that Windows will actually hibernate the system session even when you shut down.\nOn selecting an alternate OS, Windows 8 removes the hibernated image (otherwise the NTFS partition would be locked for mounting) and sets Ubuntu as a one time default, before rebooting.\nThe fact that you have to hard power off here indicates there are some problems unrelated to Wubi. I would recommend running a file system check (chkdsk /f), checking for BIOS updates, looking for hardware issues.\nAlso, since you said Windows 8 is also sluggish this points to something more general.\nWhile Wubi is slightly slower than Ubuntu, it's not as slow as many people claim. Having said that, by doing a normal dual boot it will not be using the underlying NTFS file system, so it might solve the problems you are seeing (if not hardware related).\nI would also recommend a normal dual boot over Wubi, since there is less chance of file system corruption and data loss.\n", "Q: Dell laptop battery backup 1.30 hours only with Ubuntu 12.04.

I would need to get a setup for java and start learning some of that. \nHowever I am more interested in learning python. So far all I know Ubuntu 12.10 comes with a version of python. I need to know what would it take to get things set up to the point I can actually open python 3.3.0 on Ubuntu 12.10 and starting trying out commands?\n\nA: Python3\nTo just start playing with python just type python or python3 in a terminal. The first starts python 2, the latter starts python 3. There are two major versions of python (namely 2 and 3) and they differ from each other. In fact, the python developers decided to thoroughly review a number of things in python 3. On a fresh 12.10 install, you normally of both already installed. You'll see something like this (for python 2):\nPython 2.7.3 (default, Apr 10 2012, 23:31:26)\nType \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license()\" for more information.\n>>> \n\nThen you can do things like:\n1 + 2\n\nor\na = 1\nb = 4\na + b\n\nor write functions\ndef multiply(a,b):\n    return a * b\n\nand use them\nmultiply(a,b)\n\nYou can save these functions and calculations in a file. Usually you name them someName.py. You can then make that file executable by typing chmod 700 someName.py or you can play with the file in an IDE (see below). If the file is executable you can run python someName.py to run the file with python 2 or python3 someName.py to run it with python 3.\nIntegrated Development Environments\nTo start learning python, the easiest way is to start with what is called an IDE, that is an integrated development environment. Don't worry about all the ways in which you can use an IDE. IDE's allow you to save commands in a file and excute them easily.\nYou can install IDLE (sudo apt-get install idle), which is the default python IDE. Or you can use geany, reinteract, gedit or whatever.\nWhat an IDE does is really help you to manage your files and your commands.\nOne of the best places to start is the official python tutorial for python 2 or python 3, I think.\nEnjoy.\n\nA: bpython\nIf you want to get acquainted to python using the interactive python interpreter, I'd suggest installing bpython, which is an extension of the stock python interpreter. It offers the following features (taken from its website):\n\n*\n\n*In-line syntax highlighting.\n\n*Readline-like autocomplete with suggestions displayed as you type.\n\n*Expected parameter list for any Python function.\n\n*\"Rewind\" function to pop the last line of code from memory and re-evaluate.\n\n*Send the code you've entered off to a pastebin.\n\n*Save the code you've entered to a file.\n\n*Auto-indentation.\n\n*Python 3 support.\n\nInstallation:\n\nsudo apt-get install bpython\n\nRun it:\n\nbpython\n\nAs for Python 2 vs. 3:\nUbuntu includes version 2.7, which is the last iteration of the 2.xx branch and includes many features of python 3. I'd say stick to python 2 (mostly because of the vast amount of libraries not ported to python 3 yet), but if you run scripts, use the -3 switch to be aware of the problems that could arise if you ran the script on python 3.\nE.g.:\npython2 -3 script.py\nThere is a nice website where you can see differences between the major python versions:\nhttp://docs.pythonsprints.com/python3_porting/py-porting.html\n\nA: I'm not sure the suggested duplicate quite applies at the moment. Fact is you don't need to set up virtualenv environments or follow best practices to get up off the ground and personally, I think trying to do so will scare you off Python, which is a beautiful language and a very powerful community of tools.\nTo get a brief glimpse at Python, you can just run python in a terminal and you're dumped into a live python environment. You can play around with code examples to your heart's content.\nFor bigger things (or when you get fed up of the interactive python console's limitations) you can write Python scripts very easily. Write a file in Python syntax, and then just run python filename and it'll run. Simples.\nIf you really want to learn Python, I seriously recommend two things:\n\n*\n\n*http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ - It sounds tough but it's not. The setup section for Linux has a really practical way of getting gedit up to speed too, so don't miss that out.\n\n\n*The O'Reilly Python Pocket Reference - This probably only applies if you have experience with other programming languages. I was forever trying to work out how dicts and tuples differed from other languages' arrays and the pocket reference is great for looking it up quickly. Better than Google in my experience. Again, if you don't know what an array is, this might not be much help for you.\nOnce you advance to projects where you might need best practices, that's the time to start looking at virtualenv (mostly server deployment stuff) or frameworks or anything like that.\nMost importantly: have fun.\nA note of warning on Python 3.x\nA couple of people are suggesting installing (if you need to) and using Python 3. I disagree with this stance. As the asker of the question you're probably completely unaware of the differences between the two or even that there were two versions. That's not your fault - that's just what being a beginner is all about.\nPython 3.x has been around for years already but everybody still uses 2.x. I'm serious. Other people may suggest that Py3k is \"good enough to learn on\" but I posit that at least 90% of all the good tutorials and documentation out there is for Python 2 and trying to follow it in Python 3 will result in tears.\nAnd as you progress and want to pull in external libraries (the really fun bit in Python!) you're going to find that only a tiny slither of the community have migrated over. Inevitably the thing you want to use hasn't been ported and you're left in a pool of your own tears again.\nSo I know it's 2013 and we're all half-robots floating in space, but take some advice from a cranky Python developer: stick with the old stuff for now. Things for Py3k will improve and probably within the next couple of years it'll be safe to use...\n... by which time Python 4 will be released. C'est la vie.\n\nA: One more point to note is that default python version on Ubuntu is Python 2.7.x and not Python 3. However you can install Python 3 by running this command:\nsudo apt-get install python3  \n\nTo start it in interactive mode, just run python3.\n\nA: You might want to check out coursera.org they have many online courses, including a python one starting soon. kahnacademy also has python lectures. python.org has nice tutorials also...\n   Scott\n", "Q: How to set Value of JAVA_HOME variable My /etc/profile code is:\n# /etc/profile: system-wide .profile file for the Bourne shell (sh(1))\n# and Bourne compatible shells (bash(1), ksh(1), ash(1), ...).\n\nif [ \"$PS1\" ]; then\n  if [ \"$BASH\" ] && [ \"$BASH\" != \"/bin/sh\" ]; then\n    # The file bash.bashrc already sets the default PS1.\n    # PS1='\\h:\\w\\$ '\n    if [ -f /etc/bash.bashrc ]; then\n      . /etc/bash.bashrc\n    fi\n  else\n    if [ \"`id -u`\" -eq 0 ]; then\n      PS1='# '\n    else\n      PS1='$ '\n    fi\n  fi\nfi\n\n# The default umask is now handled by pam_umask.\n# See pam_umask(8) and /etc/login.defs.\n\nif [ -d /etc/profile.d ]; then\n  for i in /etc/profile.d/*.sh; do\n    if [ -r $i ]; then\n      . $i\n    fi\n  done\n  unset i\nfi\n\n\nJAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun\nexport JAVA_HOME\n\nwhen I am running command echo $JAVA_HOME I am getting:\nexportib/jvm/java-6-sun\n\nI was expecting /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun.\nPlease point how to get the expected value.\n\nA: Try putting quotes around the location of JAVA_HOME\nJAVA_HOME='/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun'\nEXPORT JAVA_HOME\nAlso you should add system-wide environment variables and exports to a script file in /etc/profile.d ex. /etc/profile.d/java_home.sh instead of using /etc/profile\nSee:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/EnvironmentVariables\nLook under: System-wide environment variables\n\nA: should be:\n export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun\n\n", "Q: Why can't I download bcmwl-kernel-source?

After looking for all compression tools that were also parallel I found the following:\nPXZ - Parallel XZ is a compression utility that takes advantage of running LZMA\ncompression of different parts of an input file on multiple cores and\nprocessors simultaneously. Its primary goal is to utilize all resources to\nspeed up compression time with minimal possible influence on compression\nratio.\nsudo apt-get install pxz\nPLZIP - Lzip is a lossless data compressor based on the LZMA algorithm, with very safe\nintegrity checking and a user interface similar to the one of gzip or bzip2.\nLzip decompresses almost as fast as gzip and compresses better than bzip2,\nwhich makes it well suited for software distribution and data archiving.\nPlzip is a massively parallel (multi-threaded) version of lzip using the lzip\nfile format; the files produced by plzip are fully compatible with lzip.\nPlzip is intended for faster compression/decompression of big files on\nmultiprocessor machines, which makes it specially well suited for distribution\nof big software files and large scale data archiving. On files big enough,\nplzip can use hundreds of processors.\nsudo apt-get install plzip\nPIGZ - pigz, which stands for Parallel Implementation of GZip, is a fully functional\nreplacement for gzip that takes advantage of multiple processors and multiple\ncores when compressing data.\nsudo apt-get install pigz\nPBZIP2 - pbzip2 is a parallel implementation of the bzip2 block-sorting file\ncompressor that uses pthreads and achieves near-linear speedup on SMP\nmachines. The output of this version is fully compatible with bzip2\nv1.0.2 (ie: anything compressed with pbzip2 can be decompressed with\nbzip2).\nsudo apt-get install pbzip2\nLRZIP - A multithreaded compression program that can achieve very high compression\nratios and speed when used with large files. It uses the combined\ncompression algorithms of zpaq and lzma for maximum compression, lzo\nfor maximum speed, and the long range redundancy reduction of rzip.\nIt is designed to scale with increases with RAM size, improving\ncompression further. A choice of either size or speed optimizations\nallows for either better compression than even lzma can provide, or\nbetter speed than gzip, but with bzip2 sized compression levels.\nsudo apt-get install lrzip\nA small Compression Benchmark (Using the test Oli created):  \nORIGINAL FILE SIZE - 100 MB\nPBZIP2 - 101 MB (1% Bigger)\nPXZ - 101 MB (1% Bigger)\nPLZIP - 102 MB (1% Bigger)\nLRZIP - 101 MB (1% Bigger)\nPIGZ - 101 MB (1% Bigger)  \nA small Compression Benchmark (Using a Text file):  \nORIGINAL FILE SIZE - 70 KB Text File\nPBZIP2 - 16.1 KB (23%)\nPXZ - 15.4 KB (22%)\nPLZIP - 15.5 KB (22.1%)\nLRZIP - 15.3 KB (21.8%)\nPIGZ - 17.4 KB (24.8%)  \n\nA: Zstandard supports multi-threading since v1.2.0¹. It is a very fast compressor and decompressor intended to replace gzip and it can also compress as efficient (if not better) as LZMA2/XZ on its highest levels.\nYou have to use one of these releases, or compile the latest version from source to get these benefits. Luckily it doesn't pull in a lot of dependencies.\nThere was also a 3rd party pzstd in v1.1.0 of zstd.\n\nA: lzop may also be a viable option, although it's single-threaded.\nIt uses the very fast lempel-ziv-oberhumer compression algorithm which is 5-6 times faster than gzip in my observation.\nNote: Although it's not multi-threaded yet, it will probably outperform pigz on 1-4 core systems. That's why I decided to post this even if it doesn't directly answer your question. Try it, it may solve your CPU bottleneck problem while using only one CPU and  compressing a little worse. I found it often to be a better solution than, e.g pigz.\n\nA: It is not really an answer, but I think it is relevant enough to share my benchmarks comparing speed of gzip and pigz on a real HW in a real life scenario. As pigz is the multithreaded evolution I personally have chosen to use from now on.\nMetadata:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hardware used: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7700HQ CPU @ 2.80GHz (4c/8t) + Nvme SSD\n\n*GNU/Linux distribution: Xubuntu 17.10 (artful) \n\n*gzip version: 1.6 \n\n*pigz version: 2.4\n\n*The file being compressed is 9.25 GiB SQL dump\n\n\ngzip quick\ntime gzip -1kN ./db_dump.sql\n\nreal    1m22,271s\nuser    1m17,738s\nsys     0m3,330s\n\ngzip best\ntime gzip -9kN ./db_dump.sql \n\nreal    10m6,709s\nuser    10m2,710s\nsys     0m3,828s\n\npigz quick\ntime pigz -1kMN ./db_dump.sql \n\nreal    0m26,610s\nuser    1m55,389s\nsys     0m6,175s\n\npigz best (no zopfli)\ntime pigz -9kMN ./db_dump.sql \n\nreal    1m54,383s\nuser    14m30,435s\nsys     0m5,562s\n\npigz + zopfli algorithm\ntime pigz -11kMN ./db_dump.sql \n\nreal    171m33,501s\nuser    1321m36,144s\nsys     0m29,780s\n\nAs a bottomline I would not recommend the zopfli algorithm since the compression took tremendous amount of time for a not-that-significant amount of disk space spared.\nResulting file sizes:\n\n\n*\n\n*bests: 1309M\n\n*quicks: 1680M\n\n*zopfli: 1180M\n\n\nA: There are two main tools. lbzip2 and pbzip2.

I use the Network Manager to set up my VPN connection, which has worked pretty well.  The VPN I have set up currently using the Password with Certificates (TLS) type.  What I want to do is only route certain traffic through the VPN, and all other traffic over the normal local internet connection.\n  Is this possible?\nJust to help explain my situation I will give an example of the type of connections I usually have to make with the VPN network.  We have an \"intranet\" web site set up on our work network, so this web site is only accessible to me when I use VPN, but is accessed the same way I access other sites, like Google or askubuntu.com.  I often connect to a desktop computer over the VPN connection via remote desktop, where I enter the name )IP Address) of the desktop computer, username, and password.  I connect to a MySQL server using MySQL Workbench, where you enter an IP address, username and password.  I often connect to linux servers using SSH.\nFor all of the above connections I need the VPN.  However I also do some normal web surfing, as well as connecting to resources outside of the work network (Gmail, Stack Overflow, Gaming, etc.).

For example, if you want to see a dynamic output including only the last line of the output, you can use the following script :\n#!/usr/bin/python3\nimport subprocess, sys\nprocess = subprocess.Popen(sys.argv[1:], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)\nwhile process.poll() is None:\n  stdout = process.stdout.readline().decode()[:-1]\n  print(stdout,end='\\r')\nprint()\n\nIf you know how to work with strings in python, you can tweak the script to print only the lines you want to be printed, in whatever format you wish.\nSave the above code in a file such as run.py. Then you can run any command to see only the last line of the output dynamically. For example:\n./run.py sudo apt-get install <package>\n\nor:\n./run.py sudo apt-get update\n\n\nNote 1: Don't forget to give exec permission to your script:\nchmod +x run.py\n\n\nNote 2: You can make a proper symlink for a more convenient usage (or alternatively add the script path to $PATH environment variable which I do not suggest):\nsudo ln -s <path/to/yourscript.py> /usr/bin/run\n\nAfterwards, you can only use:\nrun <command-with-desired-output-format>\n\n", "Q: Where can I buy the Ubuntu phone to start developing apps?

I can't find the answer to this simple question.\nWhat command should I use to open pcmanfm in a specific directory?\nAs an example, I want to run: pcmanfm /home/truc/musique.\nHowever, this doesn't seem to work and the manpage isn't very helpful.\n\nA: Entering pcmanfm /home/$USER/folder should successfully open the folder (it does on 12.04), and so perhaps there is a problem with your installation. You could reinstall pcmanfm, or try specifying the daemon mode when you open a folder:\npcmanfm -d /home/$USER/folder\n\nThe -d stands for daemon mode and not directory; you used to be able to use -t for new tab and -n for new window with pcmanfm, but those switches don't seem to work now. \nThe manpage doesn't list all the options, so to list them all run pcmanfm --help. One further option which might be of interest is the --display= option, but you shouldn't need to specify a display if you only have the one. (Your current display can be found with echo $DISPLAY). So, an example command running pcmanfm in daemon mode and specifying a display would be:\npcmanfm -d /home/mike/Videos --display=:0.0\n\nHere are the other options found with pcmanfm --help, for version 0.9.10 (Precise):\nApplication Options:\n  -p, --profile=<profile name>         Name of configuration profile\n  -d, --daemon-mode                    Run PCManFM as a daemon\n  --no-desktop                         No function.

I cannot just remove read/list permissions for those files because the app runs with my user permissions, and I still want other applications to be able to access them.\nIs there a security mechanism to prevent the application from being able to read some folders? I tried using apparmor, but since it is \"default deny\" there doesn't seem to be a way to say \"allow the app to do everything it wants EXCEPT access these files\".\nThanks.\n\nA: There is one solution that can help you.as you have given full permission to that application from your side ,I'm afraid that you can't restrict the access of the application.\nThe one possible way is turn those file/folder permissions to accessible to only root.so that when you want to work with them you can do it by turning into a root user and your program can't access the root files/folders unless you have given enough permissions to it.\nHope that helps.\n", "Q: Advantages of separate /home partition on HDD + SSD setup I have a brand new SSD and would like to optimize my Ubuntu 12.10 installation for best speed and durability of device. From what I know, there should always be a lot of free space in an SSD, and write operations should be kept to a minimum. Since I always tend to have a lot of junk in the Documents/Pictures/Music/Download folders, I was wondering if it would be a good idea to mount /home on a separate HDD, or to just change the directories for Documents/Pictures/Music/Download by editing the $HOME/.config/user-dirs.dirs file. What would be the performance cost with the first method? Are there any important system files in /home that need to be frequently acessed to? (right now I already am mounting /tmp in RAM and using it for Firefox cache)\n\nA: The problem with putting /home on a spinning disk is that a bunch of things that could take advantage of the SSD (like all the tiny files your browser uses for example) would be on the HDD instead of the SSD, you can mitigate this by using some symlinks:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I symlink certain directories in /home to an SSD?\n\n*What in /home would benefit from being on an SSD?\nIn this case, you're probably better off putting all of ~.config on the SSD. I wouldn't worry about keeping writes to a minimum, newer SSD drives don't have that problem. \n\nA: The symlink idea would require micromanagement.

If I enter the un pw I get full access but I shouldn't have to; my current settings are...\nsecurity = user\nmap to guest = bad user\n\n[Shares]\npath = /home/shares\navailable = yes\nread only = no\nbrowsable = yes\npublic = yes\nwritable = yes\nguest ok = yes\n\nI'm pulling my hair out over this one. Any suggestions?\nEDIT:\nUgh, this is giving me such a hard time. I'm so close.\nHere's what I've got. \nI can get to the share from Windows 7 by going to start and typing \\Hostname\\Sharename but I'm prompted for a username and password. I cant just leave it blank though because it will use my workgroup as the domain; so I enter \\ for the username to clear it out and log in with a blank username and password. Great now I can access the files in the share. \nOnce I'm in, The workgroup configuration is working properly. If I'm on a computer with the the default WORKGROUP I can read and execute; a computer on my Home workgroup can read write and execute. So that's working. \nThe problem is, It shouldn't be asking for a password at all. It should be totally public to anyone on the network. I'm trying to share it with XBMC and it's not even showing up under smb in the file manager. I cant access it manually from XBMC either. I get a connection refused error.\nStill pulling hair out over this. The worst part is the first time I did this about a week ago, I spent about 30 minutes on it and it worked perfectly. Now I've probably spent at least 4 hours and it's still not working.\nTestparm:\n\nLoad smb config files from /etc/samba/smb.conf\nrlimit_max: increasing rlimit_max (1024) to minimum Windows limit (16384)\nProcessing section \"[printers]\"\nProcessing section \"[print$]\"\nProcessing section \"[Shares]\"\nLoaded services file OK.\nServer role: ROLE_STANDALONE\nPress enter to see a dump of your service definitions\n\n[global]\n        workgroup = FELLOWSHIP\n        server string = %h server (Samba, Ubuntu)\n        map to guest = Bad User\n        obey pam restrictions = Yes\n        pam password change = Yes\n        passwd program = /usr/bin/passwd %u\n        passwd chat = *Enter\\snew\\s*\\spassword:* %n\\n *Retype\\snew\\s*\\spassword:* %n\\n *password\\supdated\\ssuccessfully* .\n        unix password sync = Yes\n        syslog = 0\n        log file = /var/log/samba/log.%m\n        max log size = 1000\n        socket options = TCP_NODELAY SO_RCVBUF=8192 SO_SNDBUF=8192\n        dns proxy = No\n        wins support = Yes\n        usershare allow guests = Yes\n        panic action = /usr/share/samba/panic-action %d\n        idmap config * : backend = tdb\n\n[printers]\n        comment = All Printers\n        path = /var/spool/samba\n        create mask = 0700\n        printable = Yes\n        print ok = Yes\n        browseable = No\n\n[print$]\n        comment = Printer Drivers\n        path = /var/lib/samba/printers\n\n[Shares]\n        path = /home/shares\n        read only = No\n        guest ok = Yes\n\nUPDATE: So, the share is now available across my network regardless of the work group. Any Windows user who connects to my network can see the NAS under Netowork and access it. \nThe key was setting security to security = share. I know, it's deprecated, but it works and security = user and map to user = bad user wasn't working for me.\nAnyway, now it seems that anyone who connects to the share get's unix global permissions for the directory, which is manageable,  but I want users that are joined to the workgroup specified in smb.conf to get unix group permissions.\nThis way, I can set the directory to 775 and I will be able to write because I am joined to the workgroup but other users can only read and execute.\n\nA: This is how OpenElec is configured.

It is important that the owner account of your shares has an access to them. If you do not do this, Samba will assume the guest account is a nobody user which  unlikely has an access to the data in your share.\nAlternatively, you can specify force user = <owner-of-your-share> under your [shareXYZ] block.\n\n\n*Make sure your [shareXYZ] has guest ok = yes.\nSet browsable = yes but it is usually inherited from the [global] and is set to yes by default.\nThen, probably security = user should be also set (this is default when you do not have Active Directory set in your environment). Though, I am not sure whether this flag is required as I do not have AD in my environment.\nOf course, if you want the nobody user to work, then you can just chown -Rh 65534:65534 /yourshare, after that you will be fine just with the single setting guest ok = yes under your [shareXYZ].\nNote that having set rwx to others (chmod o+rwx /yourshare) did not let Samba with its nobody user into the share. I have checked this with strace -f -e chdir,geteuid,getegid -p <pid-of-the-parent-smbd-process>. Probably Samba just ignores the permissions set for the others? Not sure.\n\nA: It works for me in 30 seconds\nSource:https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Setting_up_Samba_as_a_Standalone_Server\n[global]\n    map to guest = Bad User\n\n    log file = /var/log/samba/%m\n\n    log level = 1\n\n[guest]\n    # This share allows anonymous (guest) access\n\n    # without authentication!\n\n    path = /srv/samba/guest/\n\n    read only = no\n\n    guest ok = yes\n\n\nA: This probably won't be the solution for everyone with such a problem, but my problem was due to the permissions of the parent directory that the shared directory was in. As soon as I enabled \"Read by others\" I was able to anonymously access the share. This caught me a bit by surprise as in windows servers the permissions of the parent directory don't matter for the shared directory.\nSo my path looks like this:\n/data1/Downloads \n\nI had to enable \"read by others\" on the data1 directory.\nI didn't have to anything special in smb.conf, my share entry looks like this...\n[Downloads]\npath = /data1/Downloads\nbrowseable = yes\nread only = yes\nguest ok = yes\npublic = yes\n\n\nA: Happened to stumble across this thread on the Ubuntu forums, and thought it might help.  It explains the steps that happen behind the scenes:\n\nIn Windows the client's username and password is automatically sent\n  when it browses for shares - this is done without the user's\n  knowledge. That forces Samba to deal with the sent credentials even\n  though it's a guest share that requires no authentication.\nWhen that username is passed Samba will search through it's password\n  database for that user:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*If there is no match to the username the client user is tagged a \"Bad User\" and converted ( mapped ) to the guest account which by\n  default is \"nobody\".\n  \n*If it finds a match to the username and there is a samba password that matches the one sent by the Windows client then the Windows user\n  automatically gains access although not as an anonymous user which is\n  why you needed to add \"force user = nobody\" to your share definition.\n  \n*If it finds a match to the username but the samba password does not match exactly the password that's automatically sent by the Windows\n  client then you will be prompted for a password - even for a guest\n  share.\n\nTry adding force user = nobody to your share definition, and see if that does it.\nEdit 02/20/2013:\nIs testparm returning an exit code of something other than zero?  All the same, I would go ahead and give that area of the config a good, hard look.  Also, I'm not sure how case-sensitive smb.conf is, but every example I see (for example) of map to guest = Bad User has the B and U capitalized.  Check-out the Samba man pages for the options you are using, and double-check everything.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.10. Can't format root partition at installation time I'm trying to install Ubuntu 12.10 on a Supermicro storage server and have an issue.\nI am using alternate (text-based) installation cd image and when I get to the Detect disks section it says there is a s/w raid on the device and asks me whether I want to activate it.\n\nI select no and proceed to manual partitioning. There I create a new partition table on the target device, create partitions and so on, but when I select write changes to disk it gives an error that it is not able to format /dev/sda1 (root).\n\nI tend to think that it has something to do with that s/w raid I don't even have! From the current system (Debian Etch) I have searched for that array, but have not found any.\ncat /proc/mdstat - nothing\nmdadm -As - no arrays found\ncat /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf - no arrays there\nmdadm -E /dev/sda; mdadm -E /dev/sda1 - nothing\nThe reason I'm talking about this raid array is because there was some other system I was not able to install Ubuntu on that also detected some array. I can't remember exactly, but on that former system there actually might have been some s/w raid, but I was not able to remove it whatever I did: clear superblock, may be even dd.\nEdit 1\nSo, I've managed to get rid of ATA RAID. I knew forehand that there was no h/w raid on the server, but as it turned out it has a fakeRAID/hostRAID (not Linux s/w raid as I thought previously).\nHere is what I've done in my case (for reference purposes):\n\n\n*\n\n*Tried to delete the array using BIOS-level utility for RAID management, but to no avail, since it didn't find any arrays already present.  \n\n*Wipe out metadata from the drives using current OS installation and with Execute a shell section during Ubuntu installation: dmraid -r -E. That resulted in errors and failed to delete metadata.\n\n*Finally, I ended up with clearing the first and last GBs of each drives with dd:\ndd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb bs=1GB count=1\ndd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb bs=1GB seek=999 (1 TB drive)\n\n\n\nI thought I'd be good now, but no! As I've mentioned it does not detect any raid arrays anymore, but I still cannot format the partition.\nI'm using a fromLinux approach to installation, where I have hd-media files: vmlinuz and initrd.gz to boot with and an installation iso. I'm installing to sda, have the iso on sdb and tried to put the above 2 files to either sda or sdb, though I think it doesn't matter after they are loaded into RAM. Regardless though of the drive I start the installation from - sda or sdb, I can create partitions on sd[bc], but not sda.\nEdit 2\nThis time I have tried to install Ubuntu on a pre-partitioned drive with existing empty filesystems, meaning a have chosen keep existing data at Partition disk section (indicated with K flag).\n\nEverything seems to be fine. It informs me that system directories on unformatted root will be deleted and such, but at the final step it says that it fails to remove existing data, even though there is no data there (it is a clean partition)!\n\nIt seems as if the drive was read-only or busy. When I try to format it with mkfs.ext3 /dev/sda using command prompt available during installation it says:  \n\n/dev/sda2 is apparently in use by the system; will not make a filesystem there.\n\nAny ideas, Please?\n\nA: See if there's an option in your system's BIOS to turn the hostRAID functionality OFF.  You could then simply use the SATA controller instead of the hostRAID controller.  I've not seen a machine yet that doesn't have that option.\nAnother option is to reset the BIOS to defaults.\nIn addition, look for BIOS updates.\n", "Q: not able to boot sda I was using Ubuntu 12.04.1 64bit, but I'm not able to boot /dev/sda.

Now, is it possible for me to have a GUI written with the help of the Ubuntu mobile SDK while uses the C engine internally? \n\nA: This should work since the SDK is based on Qt5 and QtQuick 2.0 you should be able to port (integrate) your C code because you are able to embed C code in C++.

These two nice SE posts (1, 2) comment on restarting one's ubuntu machine but they leave me with a few questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do you actually do the restart (I'm a beginner and using 12.04.1 LTS)?\n\n*Should I always restart the system when prompted to?\n\n*Does restarting the system affect access to it via SSH or there any other caveats one needs to think about before doing this?\n\n\nA: \nShould I always restart the system when prompted to?\n\nYou may view the list of packages that require a restart with:\nmore /var/run/reboot-required.pkgs\n\nBased on the list, you can decide whether it is worth restarting.\nExample of output:\nuser@server:~$ more /var/run/reboot-required.pkgs\nlibssl1.0.0\nlinux-image-4.4.0-62-generic\nlinux-base\nlinux-base\nlinux-image-4.4.0-63-generic\nlinux-base\nlinux-base\nlinux-image-4.4.0-64-generic\nlinux-base\nlinux-base\nnetwork-manager\nlinux-image-4.4.0-66-generic\nlinux-base\nlinux-base\nlinux-base\nlinux-base\nlinux-base\nlinux-base\nlinux-base\nnetwork-manager\n\n(The answer was tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS x64 and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS x64)\n\nA: Another caveat I haven't seen anyone else mention:\nIf the box you are SSH'ing into is connected via wifi then when you reboot you may not have access to the wifi network until a user physically logs in in at the remote machine which means SSH will fail since the box won't be connected to the network.\nTo avoid this, on the remote machine you have to configure the wifi in advance to be available to all users.  Click the network icon in the system tray and choose \"Edit Connections..\", select your wifi network and click edit button, then make sure  \"Connect automatically\" and \"Available to all users\" check boxes are checked. \nYou can also apparently solve this by messing with /etc/network/interfaces and wpa_supplicant but I found that road much more complicated than simply checking the box.\nSide note: For me, before making the above change, connecting from WSL on windows to an ubuntu box gave \"Resource temporarily unavailable\".  Googling this will take you down a rabbit hole of possible WSL bugs, but for me the problem was simply that the wifi wasn't connected until someone logged in. Applying the above fix solved the issue.\n\nA: *\n\n*Another option is using sudo shutdown -r now\n\n*If prompted, you should do so; as system have things need to be applied (most common if you choose to download and install updates automatically, or you have changed something yourself that requires a reboot to apply changes to your system).\n\n*SSH will definitely be affected on a reboot and it will be terminated. I may suggest Putty as it will give an option on its context menu to reconnect the session.\n\nA: Should I restart when prompted?\nYes, you should. For most cases, a restart is required when an update to the Linux kernel has been installed. These updates are usually security updates, and then only come into effect after a reboot. Updates to normal applications such as Firefox come into effect after you restart the program. Firefox should prompt you to do this automatically, but other programs may not, so it's something to bear in mind.\nHow to restart:\nTo restart the computer in Ubuntu 21.04, click the power icon in the upper right corner of the screen, and select \"Power Off/Log out\". In the sub-menu that appears, click \"Restart...\".\n\n*\n\n*Where is the restart option?\nTo restart from the command-line, run this command:\n$ sudo reboot\n\nThe downsides of restarting:\nOn the whole, restarting is a very safe operation, and I would not consider it in any way unsafe. Of course, when you restart the computer, you lose all the information in RAM, so make sure you save all open documents and files before shutting down your computer. While you are restarting, your computer will of course be offline for a few minutes. If you're running a server, it will be down for a few minutes. If you have an open SSH session, it will be terminated.\n\nA: *\n\n*How to restart:\n$ sudo reboot\n\nOr\n$ sudo init 6\n\n\n*Yes as its most probably a security updates.\n\n*Nothing will affect ssh connectivity after restart.\n\nA: Always try to Restarting the pc after ubuntu updates, install drivers and some application that wants to restart the OS(ubuntu).\nwhen new updates are installed or driver is installed these wants to restart the OS for working performance and properly use.\nNormal application or package don't need to restart the OS after installed.\n", "Q: Able to access shared files on Ubuntu from Windows only when I ping the IP from Ubuntu I shared a folder from the Shared Options of the folder allowing guest access.

Unfortunately it seems that this manifest is not available online for server editions, but you can try to search it on the cdrom.\nAlso, if you installed ubuntu-desktop through apt-get you should inspect the log located in  /var/log/apt/history.log. This log has entries like this (an example from my machine):\nStart-Date: 2013-02-18  23:55:18\nCommandline: apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\nInstall: compiz-plugins-main:amd64 (0.9.7.0~bzr19-0ubuntu10, automatic), compizconfig-settings-manager:amd64 (0.9.5.92-0ubuntu3), compiz-plugins:amd64 (0.9.7.12-0ubuntu1, automatic)\nEnd-Date: 2013-02-18  23:55:35\n\nSo you can try to locate the command you issued to install ubuntu-desktop and get the listing of the installed packages.\nIf you opt to do a clean install, before try tasksel.

The guest OS is getting its own IP from the corporate network and is able to surf to web. The guest OS can also access the host's website just fine. So far so good.\nBut I need to be able to run a LAMP environment in the guest. I have Apache installed on the guest and and in both \nhttp://localhost and \nhttp://[hostnameofguest] \n\nthe apache web page shows up fine in the guest's Firefox. But typing http://[hostnameofguest] or even http://[GuestIPAddress] inside the host does not bring up anything; ping to GuestIPAddress does work but ping to hostnameofguest does not work inside the host machine.\nThis is probably not a firewall issue--I I have that disabled (using Firestarter, I think) otherwise even ping to guest IP shouldn't work? /etc/hosts looks like: \n127.0.0.1   localhost\n127.0.1.1       customhostname\n\nAny idea how I can make the LAMP environment to work>\nThanks!\n\nA: Run 'nslookup hostnameofguest' on the Win 7 host to make sure the dns is resolving the hostnameofguest to the correct ip address.\nIf the firewall isn't the issue, then you will likely have to modify the Apache config  to allow http://[GuestIPAddress] to work.  \n\nThis is probably not a firewall issue--I I have that disabled (using Firestarter, I think) otherwise even ping to guest IP shouldn't work?\n\nA firewall can be configured to block http but allow icmp (ping) to work.\n\nA: In your case you can modify the Host file of Windows 7 which is your host OS. Windows 7 host file can be found at below path (there is no extension to the file name).\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts\nBefore editing the above file assign a static IP to your guest OS on VM.\nDo not change anything else apart than adding the below line at the end of the file.\nYour_VM_Guest-OS_host_name       Your_VM_Guest-OS_IP\n\nSave and Exit. Now open command prompt and enter below command to flush cache of old dns entries to be on safer side.\nipconfig /flushdns\n\nEnter & then close the command prompt. Now you should be able to open the HTTP pages hosted on VM with it's hostname.  \nEnjoy!!\nEdit:\n@Meengla please check 2 things ... 1st your vm's network adapter has to be in bridged mode. You can change and check it by rights clicking on the vm in vmware and then by selecting \"Properties\" please check the screenshot below for the same. \n\n\n\n*\n\n*If you want it to work only in LAN / Intranet, then create a static DNS entry in your physical firewall or router for that website. \n\n*If you want it to work on the internet, then align your public IP to the registered domain using your domain provider's website / web based application. then you will have to do NATing for the between your Public IP and VM's private IP in your physical firewall / router which ever you have at your location.\nlet me know if that solves your issue.\n", "Q: How can I log into an existing remote session using FreeNX? I successfully installed FreeNX server and the QtNX client. When I connect to the server, the screen does not reflect my current desktop on the server, but a newly spawned session.\nHow can I have FreeNX show me the existing state of the desktop on the server instead?\n\nA: You have to use an alternate VNC server.

I was just trying to install (Partially Installed) a ubuntu 12.10 along with existing Windows 8 (Pre-installed with this laptop). By mistake I just started to install the new OS in same partition but in between I terminated the installation process. Now I am not able to boot with any OS. \nHelp me to recover it with factory installation. Just tell me the step by step process so that I can get recover it. I haven't created the media for recovery.\n\nA: If you started installed Ubuntu on the same partition that had windows 8 installed, and then aborted the installation, I suspect it will be very difficult to recover directly - the Ubuntu install would start by reformating the partition, which would wipe out the windows 8 install.  I think you'll need to reinstall windows 8 from scratch, and then restart the Ubuntu install.\nI've never installed windows 8, so not completely sure of the process - but if Toshiba provided a win 8 DVD with the laptop, you might be able to do that.  I know some vendors provide the win 8 media as a separate partition on the HD, so you might be able to boot from that partition to reinstall.\nIt might help to indicate exactly which installer options you selected before aborting - this is assuming that you selected the option to install ubuntu on the entire hard drive - if you choose to share the drive, there might be other options available.\n\nA: Many Toshiba's have a recovery partition which can be accessed by pressing 0 while booting.\nThat said, there's one option in the Ubuntu installer that erases all partitions on the disc. If you chose that option, I'm afraid your recovery partition is gone and if you did not create Recovery DVD's you'll have to order them from Toshiba.\nHowever, there's still one thing to try before doing this. Boot from the liveDVD or liveUSB, install testdisk by opening a terminal and run sudo apt-get install testdisk. Then run testdisk and select recover partitions. See if you recognise a partition labelled HDRECOVERY. Probably it is at the end of the hard disk. Try recovering the partition.\nIf you manage to return your laptop to factory settings then I suggest you create recovery DVD's with Toshiba's utility before trying to install Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Can (and how do) you install Ubuntu in F2FS filesystem? F2FS is a file-system optimised for use in NAND memories (SSDs, USB flash drives, memory cards, etc...).\nYou can read a more complete information here.\nIs it possible to install Ubuntu in it?. Does the installer support it?. Any caveats?\n\nA: Ubuntu 13.04 Raring Ringtail is being developed with kernel 3.8 so it should be possible.

[without affecting current running services] There are some servers that have a task delegated to them.\nFor instance, imagine a scenario where there are web servers, data servers etc. that together provide a service to a client.\nNow how should I make sure the servers are up to date with new software package releases without blindly choosing an automatic update option? I may not be able to shut down a server for an update. How can I know that which update will affect what all running processes in the system, so that if the update affects a critical process pertaining to a service, I can deny that particular update or re-schedule it for some other time?\n--Edited part--\nMy main focus is that the running service should not be affected, while the security updates for that service should be informed to the admin PC connected in LAN. Also all those updates that do not affect the running service should be automatically updated. \n\nA: As far as I understand your question:  You want security updates automatically installed and other updates postponed until tested and you want to know if this is called \"good practice\"\nWell, yes. This is indeed good practice.\nWhat you need on your ubuntu-server install is the package: unattended-upgrades\nrunning services will not be affected until restarted.\nIn the edited part of your question you changed the wishlist a bit:\nHow to update everything except the critical running services.\nThis one is a bit less straightforward but you could fix their current version so they will not be updated, read here about pinning\n\nA: If your server is that critical and can never be shutdown for a few seconds to reboot (for a vm) or something around 1-2 minutes for a normal server, it should be redundant (at least to avoid hardware or connection failures for example) and you redirect services to other machines while you are rebooting. If this is not the case, you should modify this because it is result of bad planning and you are offering something you don't have (100% availability).\nIf delaying the reboot to when service is not used is an option, you can easily do the update and schedule the reboot with cron, with sleep / reboot in a screen session, SSHing in the server at the defined time or using the way you may prefer.\n\nA: Vivek if skipping updates is not an option. How about remote accessing the server overnight and run the update? I work in a very busy environment and I schedule all my updates at 3 am. i ssh to the server and upgrade the package needed.  \n", "Q: I'm very skeptical about installing Ubuntu over my existing Windows 7 OS.

Then it crashes with the error\nconvert: memory allocation failed `myfile.pdf' @ error/pdf.c/WritePDFImage/1595.\n\nAny idea of how to make a workaround to this problem?\nI think that a good enough solution would be to use convert one file at a time to pdf, with the same name. Then use pdfunite or pdftk to merge them. But I don't know how to use convert  in this way.\n\nA: Imagemagick seems to be very violent with memory usage. A suggestion is to use -limit to limit the memory size convert will use, it should use a disk cache for anything else it needs. Read an explanation here:\nhttp://www.imagemagick.org/pipermail/magick-users/2002-March/001285.html\nAnd here's how to use the -limit option : http://www.imagemagick.org/script/command-line-options.php#limit\nIf not, you can do it like you describe, converting each image individually and then merging them with some other tool. Something like\nfor name in p*.png; do convert $name `basename $name .png`.pdf; done\n\nshould do it.\nBasically it iterates over all the png files, runs convert on them, the only magic is the basename $name .png part, which will be replaced by the filename minus the .png part, so that when attaching .pdf extension to it, the filename makes sense.\nTry it for yourself so you get a feel of what basename does:\nbasename something.png .png\necho `basename something.png .png`.pdf\n\n", "Q: 12.04.2 - after the last update my qualcomm atheros gigabit ethernet driver is lost after the last update the driver is lost. \nI have tried hard (several nights) to get it running.\nNow with the last update it's gone.\nAny thoughts why this is not supported natively?\nWhat is the best way to get it back? \n\nA: Open terminal and run:\nsudo apt-get install linux-backports-modules-cw-3.4-precise-generic\n\nthen\nsudo modprobe alx\n\nI hope you have internet access through wifi.\n\nA: I had the same issue but when I installed 12.04.2 from disk, the Atheros 8161\nethernet card was not working due to the alx driver missing.\nI did the following to get it to work:\n\n*\n\n*apt-get update\n\n\n*apt-get upgrade\nThe following packages have been kept back:\nlinux-image-3.5.0-27-generic\nlinux-headers-3.5.0-27-generic\n\n\n*sudo aptitude\nIf you have kept back package you should see Upgradable Packages on top of the list.\n\n*\n\n*Hit + on that list\n\n*Hit g twice\n\n*Answer debconf stuff if asked\n\n*Press Return to continue\n\n*Press Q\n\n*Type yes\n\n", "Q: 12.04.2 Nvidia driver issue?

The compile program runs so quickly and returns to the IDE. So what you need to do is hold it in that output screen by (for example) putting a Readln statement before your program ends.\n\n*If you're trying to run a GUI program, perhaps your code is ending because of a button or other component has an event to exit on focus. On Ubuntu (perhaps this is a bug) I noticed that 'on focus' triggers the click event as well. This issue is non existent on Windows.\n\n*If you have a project on the Windows partition, Lazarus (by default) cannot correctly execute it. I had the same issue but I decided to keep the development project in the Ubuntu partition itself.\n\n*When you say your project doesn't run from the terminal, I assume you run it by typing the program name in the console. By default, Ubuntu doesn't allow this to be done by simply using the program name.

Is there a better way of accessing its value than using a hardcoded .config string? (a la an environment variable)\nWhat is the best practice for this? If there is no established best practice, what is the simplest approach that guarantees the desired result?\n\nA: That configuration directory is specified by the XDG Base Directory Specification standard.\nThe answer to your question is in the Environment variables section:\n\n$XDG_CONFIG_HOME defines the base directory relative to which user specific configuration files should be stored. If $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is either not set or empty, a default equal to $HOME/.config should be used.\n\nBe sure to also read Basics, to ensure that you are using the right directories for the right files.\nYou may also want to know what to do when $HOME is not set.

It appears some of the required files are in /usr/lib/ and some are in /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu, with most in the former.\nHowever, you could set --with-libdir in your configure script to deal with one issue, and that setting breaks for something else #Bummer. In my case, I set this to default to /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu, but there were a lot of files in /usr/lib e.g. libc-client.a as listed in my question.\nSo I decided to set up the configure options for /usr/lib as default and then create symlinks for the errant files in x86_64-linux-gnu.\nSo basically, here's what I did:\nA. Create symlinks for the errant files\nln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libXpm.a /usr/lib/libXpm.a\nln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libXpm.so /usr/lib/libXpm.so\nln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/liblber.a /usr/lib/liblber.a\nln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libldap_r.a /usr/lib/libldap_r.a\n\nB. Changed some specific configure options I set earlier in the question to the following (all I changed was the 3 listed here, the other options remained as they were) \n--with-libdir=lib --with-xpm-dir=/usr --with-ldap=/usr\n\nAnd everything worked ok after this.\nI hope it helps if you run into the same issue.

Done\nE: Unable to locate package google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb\nE: Couldn't find any package by regex 'google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb'\n\nDoes anyone have a solution to this problem ?\n\nA: You can install .deb files with the Ubuntu Software Centre by double-clicking on one, or using dpkg -i packagename.deb command. See this question: How do I install a .deb file via the command line?\nsudo dpkg -i google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb\n\n\napt-get is used to install packages that exist in Ubuntu's repositories. You can explore the packages in Ubuntu's repositories by opening the Ubuntu Software Centre, or Synaptic. Ubuntu's repositories include thousands of applications, but there are still quite a few that aren't included, like Google Chrome. (Chromium, however, is included in Ubuntu's repositories).\nThe beauty of using Ubuntu's repositories is that finding the package, downloading the package, and installing updates for the package is handled for you. For example, you only need to type the following command to install Chromium, you don't have to download anything in advance or anything else:\n sudo apt-get install chromium-browser\n\nFor a comparison of the different ways of obtaining and installing software in Ubuntu, see this question: Should I install programs from a source tarball (`.tar.gz`), from the Ubuntu Software Centre, or from elsewhere?\n\nA: You need a ./ in front of the .deb filename (or the full path if it's not in the current directory):\nsudo apt-get install ./google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb\n\n\nA: I use this to install google chrome on a remote server ... also works on your laptop\nwget  https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb\nsudo dpkg -i ./google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb \nsudo apt --fix-broken install\nsudo dpkg -i google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb\ndpkg -l | grep chrome\n\nthe initial dpkg -i command will fail if your machine lacks required upstream packages so after the --fix-broken cmd the 2nd install cmd works correctly ... output of last cmd verifies package got installed\n\nA: All the other answers and comments should be helpful, but to be comprehensive:\n\n\n*\n\n*No, whoever told you that was wrong.  Installing the .deb package might install Chrome with all required dependencies, depending on what's included in the particular package you have and what dependencies you need.  Or it might not, depending.\n\n*Just to be clear, you do need to have actually downloaded the Google chrome software first.  As mentioned, it is not automatically included in the repositories; you have to manually download it to your machine.  I like the command line too and it is possible to do this from the terminal, but since you're about to click into a web browser anyways, if you google \"google chrome\" from Firefox, which is included with ubuntu, Google Inc. will give you a lot of help in downloading and installing their product.  If you want the branded version, that is. [1]  \n\n\nOnce you have downloaded the package from Google and run it to install, only then will you - potentially - be given an error message that you need to install dependencies.  \nYou would then want to run\nsudo apt-get install libnspr4-0d\nsudo apt-get install libcurl3\n\nWhich - I think - are the most common missing dependencies required by Chrome (in 12.04 that is- YMMV.)  And then you can use, as mikewhatever notes, from the directory in which your Chrome installer is located, the command\nsudo dpkg -i [googlechromepackagename.deb]\n\nWhere that stuff in brackets should be what you downloaded from Google.\nBut you're only using sudo dpkg -i because you're already in the command line anyways.  You could just go back and double-click or however you run the installer file from your GUI.\nIf that still doesn't work and you are still missing required dependencies, \nsudo apt-get install -f \n\ntells ubuntu to try to fix broken packages, then you can run the sudo dpkg... command again.\n[1] I would reiterate that while askubuntu is an extraordinary community resource, if what you really want is to put Google's proprietary, branded version of their software on your machine, and all that entails, your best bet is probably going to be going to Google for help.  I mean they're not working as volunteers, you know?  \n\nA: I install Google Chrome by visiting dl.google.com with another browser and just following instructions.\nThe installation process automatically adds a ppa for subsequent updates. See the last entry in the image below:\n\n\nA: You will want to run sudo dpkg -i packagename.deb instead of apt-get.\n\nA: here is a solution which is worked for me,\nsudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev build-essential\n\nrun the above command first and try to upgrade the packages\nsudo pip install --upgrade pip  \nsudo pip install --upgrade virtualenv\n\nnow you try installing chrome or anything as usual\n\nA: Run:\nsudo apt --fix-broken install\n\nThen:\nsudo dpkg -i google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb\n\n", "Q: Replacing Windows 8 with Ubuntu 12.10 on an Ideapad U510 I have (very) recently purchased a new Lenovo Ideapad U510 with a 24 gb SSD, and was quite disappointed with Windows 8. So I am considering replacing it with Ubuntu 12.10. I have some experience in the past with Ubuntu and Mint, and it has always been simple to install or make partitions - but I've been hearing things about the secure boot feature preventing this. At least without taking extra steps. What exactly do I need to do? I've also been hearing about Samsung laptops being bricked because of installing other OSes. Is that the case with Lenovos too? I just want to make sure, as I don't want to risk ruining my laptop's hardware. Thanks.\n\nA: Honestly any pc could be \"bricked\" when reinstalling an OS. I'm sure I've bricked and fixed my laptops about 4+ times at least in the past 3 years installing and uninstalling OS's. If you want to be extra safe make a clone of your harddrive in case of any issues. Create a boot USB and boot to USB and 'try Ubuntu' first. If everything functions properly install ubuntu as a dual-boot alongside Win8. Ubuntu will automatically create the partitions you need and resize Win8 safely.\nI'm going to say one thing though. 24gb is extremely small to be running Windows... let alone a dual-boot system. Consider upgrading your harddrive. \nHope this helps.\n\nA: Bricking a computer by installing an OS on it is extremely rare, and the issues with the Samsung laptops are the first time that I have ever heard about it.  Unless you purchase a recent Samsung laptop, you are highly unlikely to ever encounter this issue.  Regarding Secure Boot, the Linux Foundation fixed this recently by creating a bootloader signed with Microsoft's key, so you have little to worry about.\n", "Q: Is there a 64bit version of ubuntu for intel CPUs? I have a Lenovo IdeaPad Y580 that I'm planning on dual booting with. I want to use Ubuntu 13.04, but on the daily builds download page there is only \"PC (Intel x86) desktop image\" listed for intel, and \"64-bit PC (AMD64) desktop image\" listed for AMD CPUs. Is there no 64bit for intel? should I just use the 32bit? Or should I just download 12.10 instead? \n\nA: \"64-bit PC (AMD64) desktop image\" is also for Intel's platform.\nAMD64 is just the name of the instructions, and AMD and Intel processors are both able to understand them.\n\nA: While the 64-bit PC image says AMD64 it does not mean it is only for AMD CPUs. This is the architecture description because the AMD64 instruction set became the prevailing instruction set for 64-bit consumer CPUs based on the x86 platform.\n\nA: Yes, there is a 64-bit daily build of Ubuntu Raring Ringtail (soon to be Ubuntu 13.04) for Intel cpus.  In fact, you mentioned it: it's the one that is called \"64-bit PC (AMD64) desktop image\".  Yep, that's a confusing name and I'm sure it's called problems in the past, but that's the right one.  (There's some sort of history behind the name, but it is correct.)  It's the one I'm using with my 64-bit Intel cpu and it works perfectly.

I'm not even sure if i worded my question right but, I'm familiarizing myself with Ubuntu and want to install it on a new desktop I just finished putting together so I'm trying it on my laptop via live usb first.  \nI had trouble mounting my NTFS windows partitioned disks, solved that problem but I also see a disk that has the exact amount of memory I alloted for persistence. I try to access it but it shows the same ACL error I got when my NTFS disks weren't mounting.  \nI've already downloaded some stuff and made some things with LibreOffice and want to know if those things have been save automatically or if I have to mount the usb disk for it to be persistent.\n\nA: Yes, if a Live USB is persistent then it will store all changes to programs and files, including newly installed software package.  However, you should not use persistence as a replacement for a regular installation, only a temporary measure.  Ubuntu's persistence slows down dramatically over time because of the architecture of the Live USB.\nA brief primer on persistence and Live CD/DVD/USBs\nLinux's Live CD feature is very efficient.  Using a read-only filesystem called SquashFS, you can compress a ~4GB filesystem image down to around 700MB, which is small enough to fit on a CD.  Recently, Canonical decided that, because of the rapidly declining usage of CDs, it wasn't worth it to go to the effort of making their CD (now DVD/USB) images fit on a CD, so they decided to target their images toward DVDs instead.  This means that you can no longer fit a stock Ubuntu image onto a CD.  However, that is no excuse for letting the (compressed) image balloon up, so Ubuntu (along with most other Linux distros) still uses SquashFS for compression.  However, there is a drawback to getting ridiculously high compression rates: as mentioned above, SquashFS is read-only.\nSo what about persistence?  How is persistence possible is Live USBs use a read-only filesystem?  Well, what happens is that, when you exit a persistent session, Ubuntu saves all file changes to a persistence file.  Then, the next time that the Live USB is booted up, Ubuntu first loads the \"vanilla\" Ubuntu installation.  After that has completed, it then gets the persistence file and uses the data in it to re-modify the files back to where they were when you last left off.\nThis is a pretty clever mechanism, but is has a few drawbacks, one of them being that, as you use the system more and update some of the packages, that persistence file becomes larger and larger, which means longer and longer boot times, not to mention other nasty side effects.\nSo, the lesson is that, while persistence is a very handy feature for a Live USB to have, you should only use it when necessary, e.g., your main computer is down.\n\nA: Live-only\nYou can install program packages into a live-only operating system (booted from DVD or USB). But the installed packages will disappear at shutdown or reboot.\nPersistent live\nYes, you can install program packages into a persistent live operating system (booted from USB). The installed packages will survive shutdown and reboot. There are limitations: You cannot use new kernels and kernel drivers (for example graphics drivers) because these are started before the overlay for persistence is activated.\nhelp.ubuntu.com/community/mkusb\nhelp.ubuntu.com/community/mkusb/persistent\nThe following link provides a method and tool to keep your personal data and tweaks (in the home directory) while making the persistent live system up to date. But you have to re-install the program packages, that you installed.\nMake persistent live drives with casper-rw and home-rw partitions\nInstalled system in USB drive\nIt is also possible to install Ubuntu into a USB drive like installing into an internal drive. Such a system works well in a fast USB3 pendrive (and even better in an SSD or HDD in an external box).\nSuch a system is as flexible as any installed Ubuntu system. You can install all kinds of program packages including kernels and kernel drivers and keep the system up to date. It is also portable between computers.\nBut live-only and persistent live systems are more portable, so if you want a USB pendrive, that works in most computers (that you can borrow temporarily), a persistent live system is a good option.\nBoot Ubuntu from external drive\n", "Q: How to set two finger scrolling and keep side scrolling as well (touchpad) Gnome settings contains an option for enabling two-finger scrolling.

It's those errors which make me think that python is your problem, since that command executed successfully for me once I had installed python-software-properties.\nThe only other alternative I can come up with--too late to try/fix my own setup--rather than adding an external repository, would be to make everyone's home /home/, and then modify the permissions on all other directories so that the only directory they're allowed to SEE when they read /home/ is \"foo\"..  They'd still have to navigate into it or you'd have to somehow script changing their CWD after login, but when the initial screen shows nothing but \"foo\" and is unwritable, it should be fairly low impact to have to \"cd foo\" or click on the foo folder if using a GUI.  And apparently this is not so simple as I'd imagined, I was thinking of IIS with NTFS permissions when I imagined a permission setting that determines whether a directory can be seen..  I did find that there's an option in vsftpd.conf named \"hide_files,\" which might be able to accomplish this with carefully selected terms (it allows you to specify a regex, but I don't know if you could do something like expand a variable based on the current user's login to make it different for each user...)\n", "Q: WiFi adapter driver problem I just installed my first Ubuntu desktop as a dual boot with Windows 7.

Unfortunately the game lags on the menu, and the graphics were automatically set to low (very rough, pixel-y edges).\nI've currently got the Beta driver 3.10 (I'm pretty sure its the one Steam insists I install over the others) on my Nvidia GT 640.\nMy specs are:\nIntel i5 2320 @ 3.00GHz\nGigabyte 2GB DDR3 GT 640\nDZ77BH-55K Intel Motherboard\nI'm currently running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (64-bit) dual-booted alongside Windows 8 (64-bit).\nThe UEFI is disabled and the motherboard uses BIOS instead (the people who built this computer knew what they were doing!).\nAm I using the open source or official drivers?\nHow can I fix this?\nIs Ubuntu using the integrated graphics on the processor instead of the graphics card?\n\nA: By default you are greeted with the Open Source Nouveau driver (If the Nvidia is installed). If you remove the Nvidia card it will default to the Intel video card inside the processor. The Nvidia Nouveau driver is not bad, but for video cards as powerful as yours you need the Proprietary Drivers. in you case you need to follow the steps I provided in this question: How do I install the Nvidia drivers?\nSince your motherboard is basically awesome (All DZ77 are awesome!) and had the option to disable UEFI (Intel \"Smart\" Technology) then you do not have to worry about Windows 8 on it. At least with all the problems it could have caused with UEFI activated.\nNote that you actually need the nvidia-313 for this card to work (As shown in the link I provided). I already tested that one with the nvidia-310 and nvidia-304 and had issues with it.\nlspci will show all the PCI devices on your system.

This can be changed in the BIOS if you want, but by default, motherboards first look for a PCI or AGP video card. If not found they go with the onboard one.\nI also suggest (Since you have a new system) to run the following command: sudo update-pciids\nThis will update the list of PCI ID devices.

Malware goes cross platform!\nIn practice there's already a certain degree of hardening in browsers that's likely to mitigate the risk of this.\nFirst and formost, unless you're clicking everything you see (and apparently its plausible that the developers in question explicitly trusted this site), firefox is adding click to play for plugins, so its slightly less likely that you'll have something just running willy nilly on your computer.\nYou can also mitigate the risks of this by not installing java (or installing it on a VM). Obviously this is slightly paranoid - you can instead disable the java plugin in your browser as twitter has suggested\nThese are often 0 day attacks so the ability of AV to catch them before they happen is limited. They're also more interested in user data, so, the system itself is safe. The best defense here is common sense.  They're also targetted attacks so unless you're an obvious target, well, there's less to fear.

I am having a problem installing Ubuntu 12.10 on my desktop. I can’t install or run the live cd of Ubuntu, on my display it appear invalid format. I will like to know if there is way for installing Ubuntu. I read some forums and it appears that the problem is my NVIDIA Video Card through the HDMI (Well that’s what I think).\nI have the following hardware specs:\nMotherboard: Asus Maximus V Extreme \nVideo Card: NVIDIA GTX680\nRAM: Corsair 32 GB\nHard Drive: 500 GB\nDisplay: LG TV – Through HDMI 1080p (I don’t have a different type of connector)\nAttempts:\n1.I downloaded the .iso file and burn it on a CD/DVD disk. After that in the menu I tried both options, to install Ubuntu and Try Ubuntu and install. \nResults: By either way I could not install Ubuntu. It only shows a black screen with my TV displaying the invalid format message.\n2.I downloaded yet again in other PC the .iso file and now installed it on a USB as the guide provided by Ubuntu shows. After that in the menu I tried both options, to install Ubuntu and Try Ubuntu and install.\nResults: By either way I could not install Ubuntu. It only shows a black screen with my TV displaying the invalid format message.\nI will appreciate any guidance on this matter. \nThank you in advance. \n\nA: I'm going to say some scary words and they're probably not going to make complete sense but here's the situation.\n\n\n*\n\n*There is a freely distributable, open source driver for Nvidia cards called Nouveau.\n\n*If you have a Nvidia card and no other driver, Nouveau will try to load.\n\n*The LiveCD only ships with free software. Nouveau is loaded and this works for some people.\n\n*For modern hardware (I have your issue with a GTX580) things fail hard.\n\n\nAll you need to do is pass nomodeset to the kernel at the boot screen.\nProbably lost you but when you boot up you're presented with a language choice and then a list of things to do. Under that list, there's another list of options. I think it's currently under F6 but anyway, enable nomodeset (or add it manually to the boot line).\nThat should get you into the live CD. At first real boot you may run into exactly the same issue. The closed source driver still won't be installed. The prodecure is slightly different this time but just use the grub menus to edit and then add nomodeset to the command line. As soon as you're in, install nvidia-current and all your problems should be solved.\nThere's more on using nomodeset here on UbuntuForums.\n", "Q: Can ubuntu be installed using a networked drive? My laptop doesn't allow booting from USB and the CD drive has gone bad. It has Windows XP on it. I want to do away with Windows and use Ubuntu only.\n\nA: Are you sure that your laptop doesn't allow booting from USB?\nYou may need to enable legacy USB support in the BIOS setup to enable it, then reboot with the bootable USB in the drive, then go into BIOS setup a second time and select the boot devices, looking for the removable drive.\nOtherwise, you may have success installing using WUBI, by running the WUBI installer from within Windows.

I'm running a fresh install of Kubuntu 12.10 with KDE 4.10 installed from the Backports PPA. This is my first time using KDE, so I'm still learning where to find everything. I've got KDE's Power Management settings set to my liking, so that when I close my laptop lid, the screen turns off but the computer does not go into suspend mode. This works fine when I'm logged in.\nHowever, when I'm logged out (i.e., looking at the LightDM login screen), if I close my laptop lid, the computer does go into suspend mode. How can I turn this off, so that the computer does not suspend at the login screen when the lid is closed?\nI've searched on several sites for an answer. However, almost every related question that I found was about turning off suspend when a user is logged in; this problem is a bit different. I did find Stop laptop from suspending when closing lid in lightdm, which does gives a CLI answer to this problem. I'm wondering, though, whether there is a GUI setting to toggle this. Is this a bug, or is there a setting that I haven't found yet?\nI'll also be happy with answers that better explain what the answer to the linked question is doing.\nThank you very much!\n\nA: If your system has moved to systemd, specifically the logind service, settings for the logind service will control the system's behavior when the lid closes.\nSpecifically, look for the logind.conf file (probably at /etc/systemd/logind.conf), and edit it to set the HandleLidSwitch setting (to ignore).\n#HandleLidSwitch=suspend\nHandleLidSwitch=ignore\n\nAfter this, make sure to restart the logind service, either via a reboot or systemctl restart systemd-logind.service.\n", "Q: Unity intercepts drag and drop file uploads to webpages Just asking if someone out there has seen the same quirk:\nIf I want to drag a file to a dropzone in a website (say gmail's compose interface) Unity brings up the window picker bar (Launcher) and I can't drop the file in the webpage.\nIt's like nothing happens.\nI haven't seen if it happens in Firefox too, just tried it with Chrome.\n\nA: I had the same problem with chromium when i want to upload files with drag and drop. \nI suggest you do this trick: start drag your file and select the Chrome window with Windows(Super)+Tab. Finally it will focus you the chrome window and hide the Unity Launcher, so you will be able to drop your file correctly.\n", "Q: What does it mean for Linux to erase disk space in Linux I am installing Linux on Virtual Box but it says that the computer currently has no detected Operating Systems. What would you like to do?   \n1) Erase disk and install Ubuntu\nWarning: This will delete any files on disk.\nWhat should I do?\n\nA: This is rather by design. You're inside a virtual computer. The disk that the Ubuntu installer can see is a virtual disk created and hosted by VirtualBox. In reality it's just a file sitting around on the host filesystem.\nWhen VB creates a new one of these disks they have no partitioning and no filesystems or files. The Ubuntu installer is just echoing this state.\nWhat should you do? Format and install.\n\nA: Thats pretty much what you need to select - it will format the disk and install. Usually there will also be an option to resize an existing partition to install. Erasing the disk is fine if there's nothing already on it.\n", "Q: Removed some directories being root and Xubuntu won't start I had some problems before doing this where xfce won't start (applications started, but no borders and couldn't type anything on the keyboard) and someone told me to use this command sudo rm -rf /usr/share/xsessions\nNow not even Xorg will start. I can do Ctrl + Alt + F1 and use tty-1 and I tried apt-get install --reinstall xfce4 but the same problem.\nWhat do you recommend me to do?\n\nA: I'm not sure I believe that in 2013 people still run commands with rm -rf they find on the internet without trying to work out what they're doing... Perhaps Ubuntu should pop up a big warning the first time a user runs rm...\nBut anyhow... The session file lives in the xfce4-session package. Reinstall that and you should be golden.\nsudo apt-get --reinstall xfce4-session\n\nAnd here are a few others:\n\n\n*\n\n*For the standard Ubuntu desktop, reinstall gnome-session\n\n*For KDE you would want kde-workspace-data.\n\n*For Gnome-shell reinstall gnome-shell.\n\n*For AwesomeWM, reinstall awesome.\n\n\nThere are others but I don't know their xsession names to look them up by.\n", "Q: Yet another Dual boot issue Win7x64 and 12.10 There are similar posts out there, but no answer that has helped me get this to work.

So I have some questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Am I missing something, or is there a bug in NetworkManager that it doesn't parse bridge stanzas in /etc/network/interfaces correctly to know to ignore them?\n\n*Is there some sort of dummy statement I now have to put in /etc/network/interfaces to trick network manager into leaving it alone?\n\n*Alternatively, can I just apt-get remove network-manager with no negative consequences?\n\n\nA: *\n\n*NetworkManager tries to manage eth0 because eth0 is not configured in /etc/network/interfaces. \n\n*To cause NetworkManager not to touch eth0, add the following stanza to /etc/network/interfaces.\niface eth0 inet manual\n\n*If you aren't using NetworkManager then you can safely remove network-manager.\nBy the way, there's an easier way to configure bridges in /e/n/i. Use the bridge_* options as illustrated in the answer by bodhi.zazen.\n\nA: NetworkManager does not handle bridges. This has been a long standing shortcoming of NetworkManager. If you want a bridge, you need to disable NetworkManager and use ifup instead, configured in /etc/network/interfaces.\nExample:    \nauto br0\niface br0 inet static\n    address 192.168.0.10\n    netmask 255.255.255.0\n    broadcast 192.168.0.255\n    gateway 192.168.0.1\n    bridge_ports eth0\n    bridge_stp off\n    bridge_maxwait 5\n\n", "Q: is ubuntu phone (or tablet) use X for display server? is ubuntu phone (or tablet) use X for display server?\nif so, it should change the Ubuntu Desktop Application to Ubuntu Phone (or tablet) its much easier for developers.\nif not, what Display Server is used?\n\nA: I watched Jono Bacon talk answer a question about this on a ubuntuonair webcast, just a couple of weeks ago.

However, if I mount it in my .bashrc or startup scripts, the mount often fails because my wireless internet connection has not yet been made.\nDoes anybody know of an easy way to execute a bash scrip every time the connection is made, or to auto-mount an sshfs drive?\n\nA: Add your script to /etc/network/if-up.d/.\nName your script without a '.sh' extension.\nAlso after adding script run chmod +x /etc/network/if-up.d/yourscriptname to give necessary permission.\nMake sure the network interface (e.g. wlan0 or eth0) that should trigger your script when turned on is mentioned in the file /etc/network/interfaces.\n\nA: I will answer this part of the OP question: \"I would love to have this mount automatically\"\nMy favorite tool for automounting network shares is autofs:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Autofs\nAutoFS is my tool of choice to mount my NAS - for all my laptops and workstations. \n\"autofs is a program for automatically mounting directories on an as-needed basis. Auto-mounts are mounted only as they are accessed, and are unmounted after a period of inactivity. Because of this, automounting NFS/Samba shares conserves bandwidth and offers better overall performance compared to static mounts via fstab.\"\n\nA: As far as I'm concerned, the /etc/network/if-up.d/ solution did not work from me as when I added to /etc/network/interfaces the following:\nauto wlp58s0\niface wlp58s0 inet dhcp\npost-up /home/augustin/Config/myscript.sh\n\nWifi would start after reboot.\nBut after some struggle, from this link, what worked was to add the script to /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/ in the form 90myscript.sh where 90 is the priority level of the script and with the following form:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nIF=$1\nSTATUS=$2\n\nif [ \"$IF\" == \"wlp58s0\" ]\nthen\n    case \"$2\" in\n        up)\n        # interface is up\n        ;;\n        down)\n        # interface will be down\n        ;;\n        pre-up)\n        # interface will be up\n        ;;\n        post-down)\n        # interface is down\n        ;;\n        *)\n        ;;\n    esac\nfi\n\nI guess there are issues between who controls the network config at system level and sometimes the default network behavior is left behind the dispatcher one.\nAlso, for those who would like - like me - to try to have a symbolic link to the script (to store the file in a better location), unfortunately it did not work for me.\nHope this helps!\n\nA: Editor's note: Cuttlefish hasn't been updated since 2012 and is not in any current Ubuntu repositories\nUbuntu 12.04\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Cuttlefish:  A simple tool, which realises reflexes on your computer by executing actions when specific events are triggered.\n\n*Open Cuttlefish and click on New.  \n\n\n\n*\n\n*Give it a name, and change Activated by stimulus option to ON.\n\n*Click on Stimulus, select the category Network and type Connect to WLAN.

It's a nice program which I used after windows just removed my grub without asking, and it worked like a charm.\nYou can also use it to boot just windows, or any OS.\nSo just removed the Ubuntu partition, and then run this live cd, it will fix your boatloader, and you are done in 5 mintes or less.\nHow to use resc-a-tux: Boot the disk(explained in step 1) and when it is booted, a windows will popup with the option:\"Restore GRUB\" or something similar.\n**Rescatux features:**\n\nFixes GRUB and GRUB2\n\nRegenerates Debian/Ubuntu grub menues\n\nCheck and fix filesystems\n\nFixes Windows MBR\n\nBlank Windows passwords\n\nBoot Info Script\n\nChange Gnu/Linux password\n\nRegenerate sudoers file\n\n**Extra tools:**\n\nSynaptic\n\nGparted 0.7\n\n", "Q: Does following `man sudo root` permenantly blocks your sudo?

The root log-on is disabled by default for a number of very good reasons and its almost never necessary to enable the root log-on.\nSome benefits of leaving Root logins disabled by default include the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Ubuntu installer has fewer questions to ask.\n\n*Users don't have to remember an extra password (i.e. the root password), which they are likely to forget (or write down so anyone can crack into their account easily).\n\n*It avoids the \"I can do anything\" interactive login by default (e.g. the tendency by users to login as an \"Administrator\" user in Microsoft Windows systems), you will be prompted for a password before major changes can happen, which should make you think about the consequences of what you are doing.\n\n*sudo adds a log entry of the command(s) run (in /var/log/auth.log). If you mess up, you can always go back and see what commands were run. It is also nice for auditing.\n\n*Every cracker trying to brute-force their way into your box will know it has an account named Root and will try that first. What they don't know is what the usernames of your other users are. Since the Root account password is locked, this attack becomes essentially meaningless, since there is no password to crack or guess in the first place.\n\n*Allows easy transfer for admin rights, in a short term or long term period, by adding and removing users from groups, while not compromising the Root account.\n\n*sudo can be setup with a much more fine-grained security policy.\n\n*The Root account password does not need to be shared with everybody who needs to perform some type of administrative task(s) on the system (see the previous bullet).\n\n*The authentication automatically expires after a short time (which can be set to as little as desired or 0); so if you walk away from the terminal after running commands as Root using sudo, you will not be leaving a Root terminal open indefinitely.  \n\n\n\nThat said lets look at what these commands actually do on a live system.  Because the name of the group for administrator users changed from admin to sudo with the release of precise I tested this on both 10.04 and 12.04.  Both tests were using Virtualbox as I have no intention of bricking a real system.\nStarting with Ubuntu 10.04 I enabled the root accout with sudo passwd root then edited the sudoers file with sudo visudo and rebooted.  When I rebooted only my name was listed and when I logged in sudo did not work.  However I was able to become root by entering su in a terminal and the root password.  I was also able to log out and back in as root.   root was not listed as a user but I could type it in.\nNext I tried Xubuntu 12.04 I enabled the root accout with sudo passwd root then edited the sudoers file with sudo visudo and rebooted.  When I rebooted only my name was listed and when I logged in sudo still worked.  I was able to become root by entering su in a terminal and the root password.  I was also able to log out and back in as root.   root was not listed as a user but I could type it in.\n", "Q: How to add a space from outside an extended partition to a logical partition contained in the extended partition? \n*\n\n*First, my partitioning looks like so:\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*I do not like how it looks, and am not sure how I came up with that  extended partition sda3[****] which I do not need, but it did not bother    me initially, so I continued with that structure.\n\n*At a certain point I have shrunk the Windows partition and used the new partition to test different Linux-es. Now, that is called sda2.\n\n*I am not sure if I use the terminology properly, but sda2 is my  only linux partition outside the large extended partition. (As far as I understand it, an extended partition is like a container for smaller partitions: in a way sda3 contains and is formed  by sda5, 6 and7.)\n\n*I have used sda2 to test different Linux OS-es. At a certain point, when sda7 was not a system partition, but an empty one, I have tried to enlarge sda2 into sda7 but this was not possible - I think because sda7 was within the extended partition sda3. So, I just copy/pasted the sda2, which was a system partition into the free sda7 (with Gparted) and in this way have transferred the system to a larger partition. But now I would like to enlarge even more sda7 (now my system partition): and cannot do it. I would like to use sda2 which now is separated and kind of useless.\n\n*sda5 is a space to deposit files.\n\nMy question is: \nIs it possible to change this structure of my partitions so as to add sda2 space to my system partition sda7 without having to remove my system - that is: without formatting  sda7 and sda5? \n\nI am familiar with Gparted booting from external USB and with Boot Repair. So, I do not mind if solving this would corrupt the grub, I could restore it later with Boot Repair. I just want to now what would be the chances of adding the space of sda2 to the system partition.\n\n[****I am under the impression, although not really sure, that the structure of sda3 as extended partition is the result of the manipulations made while installing/testing different Linux-es on sda2 and that the partitioning program of the system installer was able to change the record entries of what now are sda5, 6 and 7 without formatting them: so, I hope to do something like that from a bootable GParted USB].\n\nA: To add a space from outside an extended partition to a logical partition contained in that extended partition, that space has to be first included in the extended partition. \nOnly then it can be added to one or more of the logical partitions from within the extended one.  \nSo:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using GParted from a live CD/USB, delete sda2 which is EMPTY.\n\n*Resize sda3 (extended) partition to the left to take up all the unallocated free space left by sda2.\n\n*You can then use the new unallocated free space before sda7 in any way you like:\n\n\n*\n\n*increasing the size of sda7 (preferably by making a backup of this\npartition first, e.g. using clonezilla or redo although GParted should perform this without any problems), after which you can\neven share some of the newly gained space with other partitions (sda5\n& sda6) in several steps of moving their start boundaries to the\nleft, or\n\n*creating a new partition there\n\n\n", "Q: hidden files always being shown When opening a folder, by default it always shows hidden files. I can uncheck the view option and they disappear but reappear on the next opening with the hidden files option re-checked. Have I inadvertently changed an option or is this a bug? No-one else seems to have encountered this.\n\nA: Here are the steps I took to remedy this.\n\n*\n\n*Open File Explorer.\n\n\n*Goto Preferences under Edit menu\n\n\n*Uncheck Show hidden and backup files if checked\n\n\n*Close and enjoy, see below:\n\n\nA: I'm using ubuntu 15.04. Recently I upgraded form terminal using the cmd \"sudo apt-get upgrade\". After this Nautilus was showing all the hidden folders by default. However, after searching a while in internet I ended here. Maybe the solution I post here has already been posted in some forum, but here is how I solved the problem in Nautilus.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the \"dconf editor\" using the command: \nsudo apt-get install dconf-tools\n\n\n*open dconf editor using the command:\ndconf-editor\n\n\n*Browse to org > gtk > settings > file-chooser\n\n*Uncheck the \"hidden file\" key appearing in right side.\nThat's all. Enjoy!\nThe key from org > gnome > nautilus > preferences : show-hidden-files is ignored as it is deprecated.\n\nA: Another way to fix it: open gedit, type something and click on save. When the file chooser window opens, press Ctrl+h to show/hide hidden folders. This changes the settings to the way they're supposed to be.\n\nA: Assuming you are using Nautilus (the standard file manager in Ubuntu), read the help files on Nautilus views. To change the default option, you can do the following:\n\nIn any file manager window, click Edit ▸ Preferences and select the\nViews tab.\n\nIn that tab you can unselect show hidden and backup files. By default,\n\nThe file manager does not display hidden files or folders.\n\nYou can also toggle showing/hiding hidden files by using CTRL+h.\n\nA: As others have said, the default behaviour can be changed after opening file manager and going to Edit->Preferences->Views and unchecking Show hidden and backup files. \nUsing Ctrl+H only temporarily toggles hidden files, and when a new window is opened the default view comes again. \nNow I am going to say that why suddenly the default behaviour got changed even when you don't remember changing it. \nIt is because when the file manager is opened externally, (like choosing file to upload in a browser, etc), and we press Ctrl+H, the toggle is not temporary, it is permanent. \nI found this issue/feature in Ubuntu 16.04.\n\nA: Ubuntu GNOME 16.04 LTS with Gnome Files 3.14.3\nTo make it clear: I don't have the Unity desktop. If you have Unity or other desktop besides Gnome, this answer may not be of use to you. Second, I have done some mods so my panel may look different and may be in a different location. However the concept should be the same if you are using Gnome.\n\nThis image shows that you cannot access the Files \"Preferences\" menu when Files is closed. So whether you have Files docked in the panel or not does not matter. You need to open Files before you can start.\n\nThis is my menu in the Files app. Note I don't have any menu like \"Edit -> Preferences\" as others have shown elsewhere.\n\nWhen Files is open you can right (outside) click its icon in the panel to open \"Preferences\".\n\nNow when I go to the \"Views\" tab I can see \"Show hidden and backup files\". At this point my answer should be the same as shown elsewhere. It's just a matter of understanding that not everyone has the same desktop or Ubuntu version.\n", "Q: How to revert ubuntu updates and installs to specific time?

Game using virtual desktop.\nThis 768 resolution does not fit the window because it will hit the top bar. And the game goes to another workspace window. It makes some games to play hard, when game menus and toolbars is a bottom in second workspace. Please add Ubuntu options to hide top bar.\nim using Ubuntu 12.10.\n\nA: Yeah I've had several moments like this. There aren't many options to be frank and none of them are ideal.\n\n\n*\n\n*Run the game in windowed mode (inside the virtual desktop) and run the desktop at full resolution. It will become full-screen (over the bars) and then you can get the game window as big as you can. Not all games allow this but it's leaps and bounds more simple than the rest of the options.\n\n*Hack compiz so it targets your Wine window for fullscreen mode (doesn't always work if the application changes resolution after loading)\n\n*Run the game in a separate X server instance. Arguably better performance because Compiz isn't compositing the window.\n\n*Use KDE. Kwin (the window manager) can force windows to become always-on-top and drop their borders at the same time.

I honestly believe in the \"one tool for one job\" mantra, and I think a decent text-editor + command line tools is the better choice.\nThat being said, IDEs are really helpful and I think Photran is the best bet.

If this is the case, the above options will work. They will just copy the content to another container, maintaining the 25fps, bitrate and overall quality.\nIf you do not want to copy the content, simply remove the part that says \"-vcodec copy -acodec copy\" and avconv/ffmpeg will take care of it.\nNOTE - As mentioned by LordNeckBeard, the MP4 example will not work on Raw.\n\nA: Use ConvertMe!\n\nA fine media converter you have never used before...\nhttp://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/ConvertMe!?content=153277\n\nA: run:\nffmpeg -i video.avi -sameq -r 25 out.avi\n\n\nis your video really encoded with 800 MBit/s?\nyou can specifically set the video bit rate\nffmpeg -i video.avi -b:v 876104k -maxrate 1200000 -bufsize 876104k out.avi\n\n", "Q: Do I need to set a \"location\" for a printer in Ubuntu?

Do you installed the driver automatically or manually?\nCan you post a screenshot of your configuration?\n...\n...\n\nA: Is it network or locally connected printer?

The \"location\" field is not required at all, it's just for easier identification of your printer (people usually use \"Name\" field for that; example: \"Xerox_ITsector\")\n\nA: Your problem is for sure not in location field being unfilled. It exist there solely for large scattered installation with many printers, so both users and support personnel has additional information about physical location. In other words, location is just text label to make user clear where actual physical printer had been installed.\nCUPS printing system, drivers you were about to install and actual hardware create enough points of possible problems. You have to test them one by one from bottom to top.\nFrom personal experience, drivers can be of low quality and making whole process of serious exercise in deep learning CUPS system and finding out what went wrong during installation and/or configuration.

However if you consider that:\n\n\n*\n\n*C#/mono is available on android\n\n*C#/mono is available on ios\n\n*C# is available on windows phone 7 and 8\n\n\nIf ubuntu was to prevent use of c# it would be more restrictive then all its competitors. \nThere are a few issues to overcome first however, firstly c# binding for QT although available have not been packaged for ubuntu (yet). There is currently a blocking issue on mono for arm in debian which needs sorting out. This shouldn't be a big issue as mono works on IOS and android both of which are arm.\nMy guess is that ubuntu wont support it, however they also will not prevent it.

Since i cannot boot from the SSD, I cannot run grub-install. Is there any ways around this?\n\nA: First, boot into your BIOS with F10, or whatever your key is. (In my case, it's F10)\nThen, go into the 'Boot' option, and make sure your SSD is on the boot list.\nIf not, add it to the first boot option.\nIf it is in the Boot order, put it BEFORE the OS.

Even kernel panic could occur. In most cases it will work correctly but just so you have that in mind when applying a kernel not tested to an older Ubuntu version (In this case 3.8 is for 13.04).\nFor additional information see:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/MainlineBuilds\n\nA: As 3.8 is very very new, you'll have to fetch is yourself, for now. That said, you can expect 3.8 to make it into 12.04 repositories through backporting, in the similar manner the 3.5 kernel from 12.10 did. 12.10 is not an LTS release, and therefore will remain with its original 3.5 kernel untill the end.\nTo illustrate what I am talking about, check out the available kernels from 10.10, 11.04 and 11.10 in Ubuntu 10.04.\n\nA: Currently you can upgrade to 3.8 from main repositories.\nToday after running:\nsudo apt-get install linux-image-generic-lts-raring\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic-lts-raring\n\nReboot.\nuname -a returned 3.8.0-32-generic # 47-precise1-ubuntu.\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\n\nA: The repos now includes saucy as well:\nsudo apt-get install linux-image-generic-lts-saucy\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic-lts-saucy\n\nReboot.\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\n", "Q: Unable to find Boot Screen to install Ubuntu , with windows 8 installed I am trying to install Ubuntu, with Windows 8 installed on my\nsystem.\nBut I am unable to get the GRUB boot screen to select the Operating System, as it is UEFI secure boot\nprotected.

I'm using ubuntu 12.10 on intel nuc, and have no keyboard only a mouse attached.\n\nA: Well, I took my time just for the fun of it to check all NUC Bios and Driver updates. It just so happen they use the same motherboard and offer the same BIOS Updates.\nYou can see the webpage where they all send me HERE\nSince you do not have a keyboard, the option to press F7 when the system boots to read a pen drive and the Bios file in it is out of the question. This way only works when you boot the computer, after pressing the corresponding key it will read any pen drive you have inserted and look in the root folder of the pen drive for a BIOS file format for Intel.\nYour only way is to Burn a CD with the BIOS update and boot from it. I will be assuming the computer tries to boot from a CD/DVD or a Flash Drive before going for the Hard drive. If this is not the case and it boots directly to your hard drive then you really need to get a keyboard since you are out of options.\nYou will need to get the GKPPT10H.86A.0036.BI.ZIP but for future reference, try to get either the file that ends in .ISO, .BIO or the one that ends in .ZIP. If you had the ISO file you just burn it to a CD/DVD and boot from it. In this particular case there is no ISO option.\nThe ZIP one, you decompress but here is the problem, the files need to be stored in a bootable CD/DVD or USB Flash drive in order to run (Again, assuming the BIOS reads this devices before the HDD). So you would need Windows to make it bootable as stated by the Intel Bios Update Instructions for this motherboard. After making it bootable you can proceed to copy the files to it and then later boot from it. The whole update process will be automatic.\nNow that we have seen 2 options which depend slightly on having a keyboard or having the system boot into other devices before going to the HDD, we can now fall into the Bios Recovery option.\nThe Bios Recovery option found in the Bios Updates is just in case your BIOS fails to update but it is also used to update your Bios to that specific version, in this case, it will be updated to the latest. More information HERE\nThe part that you need to know is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the file that ends with .BIO. In this case it is the GK0036.BIO  \n\n*Copy the BIO file to a CD/DVD (Either External or Internal CD/DVD unit).\n\n*While leaving the CD/DVD connected to the PC, boot the computer. If the computer goes to the CD/DVD first, before the HDD, the Intel motherboard will see the BIO file and update the BIOS.\n\n*If you happen to have a system that boots directly to the HDD then follow the instructions here to remove the jumper and make it boot first from other devices.\n\n\nBy default, this motherboard will first read any other device before going for the HDD. So if you have not yet changed anything in the boot process in the BIOS, you don't need to worry.\n\nA: The BIOS-Update-Tools doesen't run under a OS like Ubuntu, it runs in a console bevor the OS is started. In the console you have no support for a mouse.\nI would say it is impossible.\n", "Q: UEFI dual-boot, how to load recovery partition (Windows 8) after installing Ubuntu I've installed Ubuntu (~EFI mode) in a ASUS Zenbook UX32VD, which has Windows 8 pre-installed. It had Security Boot disabled. I installed grub in the same partition I put the root directory (sda7 in my case).\nAfter installation Ubuntu loaded and worked, great.\nBut there were 2 other partitions in grub that didn't run:\nWindows Recovery Enviroment (loaer) (on /dev/sda2)\nWindows 8 (loader) (on /dev/sda4)\n\nWhenever I try to load any of the above i got:\nerror: can't find command <<drivemap>>.\nerror: invalid EFI file path.\n\nI found in Internet multiple people having similar issues: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/grub2/+bug/1024383\nI tried using Boot-repair (recommended repair) utility from Ubuntu, and I've got 2 new entries in grub called:\nWindows UEFI bootmgfw.efi\nWindows Boot UEFI Loader\n\nThey load Windows 8, but the recovery partition is missing. I've tried using Boot-repair more times with different parameters which could make the bootmgfw.efi fail but none added a recovery partition entry:\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/1690668/    (this is the last one Boot repair I did. EDIT: This Boot-Repair was using Recommended Repair)\nI'd like to know how can I add an entry to grub that loads the recovery one. Any help to make my recovery partition to load would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: The Windows RE cannot be loaded directly from GRUB, as it requires bootmgfw.efi to call it.  The only way to get to it is through Windows 8 because it relies on the underlying framework of Windows to be loaded.  As long as you did not move the original partitions (Windows RE and Windows 8) around, you should be able to get into through Windows.  Otherwise, you will need to rebuild the BCD, which is outside the scope of this question.\n\nA: Late post I know but I found a solution.\nI booted off Ubuntu 16.04 UEFI USB with Secure Boot: off. I had a Dell I was working off for a client who had upgraded to Windows 10 and wanted to run the factory reset which they couldn't access.\n\n\n*\n\n*Booted off USB and selected \"Try Ubuntu...\".\n\n*Open hub and open Disks.\n\n*Looked for the partition on the main hard drive about 5xxmb in size and noted the partition number. In my case I noticed I had 2. The first one was /dev/sda1 so I mounted it and had a look at the contents. I noticed a /EFI/Dell/Boot/bootmgfw.efi\n\n*Restarted the computer and at the grub menu pressed 'e' to edit an entry.\n\n*Cleared the text and added the following:\n\ninsmod part_gpt\n  insmod chain\n  set root='(hd1,gpt1)'\n  chainloader /EFI/Dell/Boot/bootmgfw.efi\n\nand then I hit F10 and it booted to Windows menu, selected troubleshooting and then Dell Backup and Recovery. \nYou may have to play around with the set root line by changing the hd1 to hd0 or hd2 or whatever depending on how many drives you have. The gpt1 is the partition number so if yours was /dev/sda4 you would need to use gpt4 here. The reason I went with the first partition was because it: 1) had a EFI folder in the root of the partition, 2) there was a manufacturer folder in that EFI (Dell), and 3) it contained a Boot/bootmgfw.efi which I understand is a windows boot manager binary.\n\nA: I had almost the same problem (see here) (same machine!), adding/changing the normal start entry (Windows 8 (loader) (on /dev/sda4)) to\nsetparams 'Win8'\nset root='(hd0,gpt1)'\nchainloader /EFI/microsoft/BOOT/bootmgfw.efi\n\nfixed that one. Still, I could not get the recovery-one to work. I really do need that one. Did anyone find any solution to that yet?\n\nEDIT:\nHere is one attempt which seemes to have worked for fixing the recovery mode:\nsetparams 'Win Recover - Recovered'\nset root='(hd0,gpt2)'\nchainloader (${root})/EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi\n\nIt boots, then I get a bluescreen. I don't know if this is because this entry is wrong or my win8 is broken...\nIf someone could verify that it is working - that would be great!\n", "Q: Is there a graphical git commit application to show diffs and set a commit message?

You can safely choose \"Something else\" and you will be shown how your hard drive is arranged and from there it might be easier to make a decision.\nIf, for example, have only one partition and it is entirely taken up by Windows, you'll need to do a bit of rearranging, such as shrinking the Windows partition and leaving some unallocated space for use by Ubuntu.  If this is the case, I'd suggest shrinking the Windows partition from within Windows itself and just leaving the freed-up space as unallocated.  Then, when you boot again from CD, DVD, or USB to install Ubuntu, it'll show you another option, i.e. to install Ubuntu next to Windows.\nHow big you make your partitions (Windows & Ubuntu) will depend upon the size of your hard drive and upon how you plan to use things, but I'd recommend giving Ubuntu at least 50 or 60 GB to get started.\n", "Q: Create a Gtk Window insensitive to Show Desktop and Won't show in Launcher I want to make a Gtk.Window which is pinned to the Desktop and acts like a desktop widget. I've found that I can do this by setting self.set_type_hint(Gdk.WindowTypeHint.DESKTOP) which keeps it below all windows, immovable and insensitive to Show Desktop Unity plugin. However, if you click on the desktop area outside of the widget, the window is hidden behind the desktop and I can't get it back (I have to kill the program).\nWhat is the best way to handle this? Is there another setting? I've found that I can also get a window to ignore Show Desktop commands if I set the skip_taskbar hint and deactivate a setting in compiz, but I'd rather not muck around with people's compiz settings to get this effect.\nEDIT:\nFigured out the ignore Show Desktop (see below), but still can't get it to skip the Launcher bar. The DESKTOP window hint worked for that, but has the drawbacks mentioned above. I also played around with setting the WM_CLASS in the .desktop file, but Unity seems to ignore that.\n\nA: Figured it out... you need to set the type hint to Gdk.WindowTypeHint.DOCK then also set either skip_taskbar_hint OR skip_pager_hint.\nEDIT This works, but even with skiptaskbar, the window still shows up as an icon in the launcher bar. I need a better way....\nEDIT2 Got it! The issue came from other launchers in the bar having the same WMClass as the program I was trying to make a Desktop Widget. To distinguish itself, you need to set the WMClass of the window within the program, as well as within its .desktop launcher:\nIn the code:\nGtk.Window.set_wmclass(WMname,WMclass)\n\nAnd in the .desktop Launcher:\nStartupWMClass=WMname\n\n\nA: I have an application running that does exactly as you wish: It's rainlendar2 in desktop mode.

Many laptop models have a special function key on the keyboard for turning the camera on/off:\nhttps://askubuntu.com/a/91735/18665\nA recent update broke some Lenovo webcams.  I'm not sure if this would apply to your Acer or not, but it's worth a try:\nhttps://askubuntu.com/a/264461/18665\nIf this fixes your issue, please follow the instructions at the end for updating the bug report so we can get more attention from the developers for this bug.\nSince that solution is specific to Lenovo laptops, there's a chance it won't work for your laptop.  But if your camera was working and stopped working, it's possible one of the kernel updates broke it.  I'd recommend going through and trying older kernels to see if any of them fixes it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run this command in a terminal to see which kernel you're currently using, and make a note of it:\nuname -r\n\n*Run this command in a terminal to see which kernels you have installed:\nls /lib/modules\n\n*You should have at least a couple older kernels installed.  For each older kernel you have installed, reboot your machine and at the GRUB boot menu, go to Previous Linux versions and choose one of the older kernel versions (for example, Ubuntu, with Linux 3.5.0-23-generic).\n\n*Test your camera using the older kernel version in Skype and Cheese.  Make a note of the kernel version (use uname -r if you don't remember which one you picked) and whether or not the camera works.\n\n*You should eventually get to a version of the kernel where your camera works again.  If not, search for available kernels:\nsudo apt-cache search linux-image-3 | sort\nAnd then pick an older one to install.  For example:\nsudo apt-get install linux-image-3.5.0-22-generic\nThen repeat the above steps to test that version of the kernel, and keep trying older versions until hopefully you get to one that works.\n\n*Once you find a version of the kernel that works, submit a bug by typing this in the terminal:\napport-bug linux\nMake sure you include relevant information, such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your specific laptop model\n\n*The version(s) of the kernel where the webcam doesn't work\n\n*The version(s) of the kernel where the webcam works\n\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to make OpenStack work with MaaS without involving Juju?

Also the touch input works. You can actually move windows to and from the touch screen, just that, it is not physically turned on. \nSince the touch screen becomes powered upon powering up with lid closed before any Linux loader shows up, I suspect that it may be BIOS that initiates that.

I just wanted to delete websites that I don't need on this server.

During the reboot, apache failed to start because:\nDocumentRoot [/var/www/PATH/TO/DIRECTORY/] does not exist\n\nIn addition, I've got a [warn] NameVirtualHost *:80 has no VirtualHosts notice.\nMy server is running Ubuntu 11.10.\nI just wanted to delete directories I wasn't using anymore. How do I clear this up?\n\nA: The recommended way to enable and disable Apache websites is using the a2ensite and a2dissite (short for Apache 2 Enable/Disable Site).\nWhat these two tools do is basically adding/removing links to/from /etc/apache2/sites-enabled. Such links point to /etc/apache2/sites-available.\nBecause you have removed the files, I'd recommend not just disabling the sites (i.e. removing the links from sites-enabled), but also remove the site configurations all toghether (i.e. removing both the links from sites-enabled and the files from sites-available).\nIn short, you should:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find the sites of which you have removed the files: ls /etc/apache2/sites-enabled\n\n*Disable such sites: rm /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/site1 /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/site2\n\n*(Optional) totally remove the configuration files for such sites: rm /etc/apache2/sites-available/site1 /etc/apache2/sites-available/site2\n\nA: Hard to tell with what little configuration information you posted.\nYou need to check your Apache configuration files and virtual hosts. If you are no longer using /var/www/PATH/TO/DIRECTORY/ , disable the virtual host that is using that directory and/or update your apache configuration.\nSee: \nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/serverguide/httpd.html\nIf that does not solve the problem, please update your question and provide additional configuration information.\n\nA: I figured it out.

First I thought that this may be related by compiz/unity and switched therefore back to gnome-shell (uninstalled all unity stuff).\nBut there gnome-shell causes high CPU load as well (~100% of one core). Do you have any guess what could cause this? \nMy Hardware:\nLenovo t420s with disabled nvidia-optimus and nvidia graphics, meaning I am only running the Intel graphics.\n\nA: Actually you can open the console and type top\nThis will show up a list of all the running processes.  Check under %CPU to identify which process is using the CPU.\nAlso try to disable some of the animation, maybe to see if there is any difference.\n\nA: You can switch to a lightweight desktop environment, such as lxde or xfce of which this last one is more stable and features the majority of the benefits of Compiz (even the Extra Effects) and this way you'll be away of the memory leak of both compiz and the unity panel.\nSomehow, and I say SOMEHOW (which means I don't know how nor why) if you wish to use the Ubuntu Unity Plugin, you'll have all the benefits of the Unity hud and panel in a lightweight desktop environment with no memory leak.\nUnity's memory leak is documented right here, explained in the site, as follows:\n\nBinary package hint: unity\nEvery use of the global menu increases memory used by\n  unity-panel-service by about 1MB per use [...]\nIt's also been reported and seen here that in the Classic login each\n  use of the global menu does about the same for\n  indicator-applet-appmenu\n\nThere are also the cons, in example: Compiz won't exist at the boot. So I suggest you to install the fusion-icon in order to run it at the very startup, manually or automatically, so compiz will become the window manager/decorator. I think it is the hardest thing. Programs setup, file associations and these things are something we can live with (XFCE uses PCManFM instead of Nautilus and certain software for opening pictures and other stuff, which you can override by assigning the proper piece of software to open your files). So, if you consider this, you can live with a lightweight desktop environment but the memory leak is a horrible thing that many people is yet waiting to be fixed. Even if they have released several patches or fixes, the memory leak is a major issue when in Unity.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Should I install zip or use gzip? I have downloaded some .zip files. I wish to decompress them (I have unzip), modify them, and compress them again (into separate compressed files, one decompressed file per compressed file). I have no plan to use the files on another machine. I'm trying to figure out whether to apt-get install zip or to gzip them. (I have gzip.) What are the advantages of each — in general and specifically in my case?\n\nA: In general the main advantage of zip over gzip is that it's more widespread in the Windows community. \nIn your case it might be more or less equivalent. \nM.\n\nA: Sticking with .zip can be a good idea for the sake of consistency. If you end up creating scripts that operate on these files, using a consistent format will keep things simpler for you. Of course, this doesn't exclude the possibility of converting the original files to gzip format and sticking with gzip.\n", "Q: Where can I find a Simple Hello World example for Ubuntu SDK (QT)?

I have got my recovery disk for Windows 8, but when I put the disk Ubuntu cant run DVD's autorun. How can I get my Windows back?\n\nA: In order to reinstall Windows, you must boot directly from the stick without launching Ubuntu at all. Do you know what this means or do you need further explanations? Your style of writing is somewhat incomprehensive.\n\nA: Put the CD in your DVD-drive, restart the computer and pay close attention to which button you need to press to have boot selection menu (usually F10 or F12)\nChoose boot from CD/DVD\nMind you, you will not get your files back if you formatted/changed partitions.\n", "Q: Recommendations for restoring accounts after replacing a disk drive? Several of our development servers have flaky SSDs that need to be replaced. The machines are still usable, but we see lots of errors in dmesg, and every once in a while they need to be rebooted because of I/O errors. We have new SSDs (proven to be reliable in other servers) ready to be installed.\nSome facts:\n\n\n*\n\n*The servers run both Ubuntu 10.04 and 12.04.\n\n*There are about half a dozen different accounts that ideally would be\nrestored to the new disks.\n\n*Much of the data is in git repositories, but there are also many\nfiles not controlled by git.\n\n*Many extra packages have been installed, most of which are documented\nin the various readme files of the projects.\n\n*There is still time to make backups of any and all files, and plenty\nof other servers on which to store the backups.\n\n*If restoration is too difficult, we can simply pull down the git\nrepositories and reconfigure the new systems manually, though we\nwould prefer not to.\nWhat I am looking for are recommendations for approaches to restoring the machines to their current state after the new drives go in. Some more specific questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Should I just tar up / or /home?\n\n*If I tar up /home, how do I preserve the user IDs?\n\n*Is it better to just tar up individual accounts (tar zcvf user.tgz /home/user/*) and restore them after adding each user to the new system?\nI am hoping that there are standard approaches to this problem I can take. I read this question, but it wasn't quite my problem. This other question recommends clonezilla or dd. Is that the way to go? I am a little leery of cloning the disk because I want to avoid propagating corrupt files that went bad due to the flaky nature of the current disks.\n\nA: Clonezilla is OK if your target disk is of similar or larger size than the flaky one. And if you have a bootable CD reader of course.\n\nA: I would use tar\nMake the archive\ntar -pcvzf home.tar.gz /home\n\nExtract the archive\ntar -pxvz home.tar.gz /home\n\nOptions\np = Preserve permissions\nc = Create archive\nx = Extract archive\nv = Verbose (show file names while making the archive)\nz = Use gzip\nf = Archive file name\n\nSee also https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BackupYourSystem/TAR\n", "Q: Add a feature like one in Windows task manager?

Is it safe to run any production server in a KVM?\nPC = i5 vt enabled, 8gig memory 1g hard drive\nHOST = Ubuntu Desktop 64 bit. \nGuest(s) = Ubuntu Server (command line)\nIs this safe? Should I run all from a command line for security purposes?\n\nA: First of all, yes you can (you know that from the existing answer). I would still like to add a few aspects. The desktop and server versions only differ by the packages installed by default or set to be installed by default (tasksel), hence you can do it.\nRunning a production server on a \"desktop version\" of Ubuntu is therefore possible as there are no fundamental differences such as, say, between Windows XP Pro (32bit) and Windows 2003 Server R3 (32bit) - the latter would accept up to 64 GiB RAM in the more expensive editions. On Ubuntu you can install a kernel that speaks PAE and doesn't set arbitrary limits (like cheaper Server editions of Windows 2003) even on 32bit setups.\nThe bigger question should be whether you can run production servers on commodity hardware. And the answer is YES. Check out this article over at Wikipedia. Google runs most of their services on this kind of hardware, but redundantly. A few years ago they (Google) published some study about the reliability of desktop hard drives, too.\nTherefore after we know commodity hardware isn't the problem your requirements about reliability and the known parameters concerning hardware failures to be expected etc should govern your decision making.\nA \"cheaper\" (or rather: \"more lightweight\") alternative would be to use LXC (Linux Containers). Imagine them like an intermediate step between chroot (which was never meant to be a jail like the respective concepts on Solaris or BSDs) and KVM. LXC does leverage apparmor to achieve this, btw. The separation isn't perfect, but given the advantages, the tradeoff seems small.\n\nAbout your rootkit worry, I am not sure because I haven't researched the topic enough. However, KVM guests run as user mode processes and you can even let each guest have its own account, if you like. Now parts of KVM must obviously operate in the kernel of the host, so there is a chance that attack vectors exist, I just wonder whether the attach vector allows code from the guests to break out ...\n\nHow you intend to make things more secure by only using the command line is beyond me, however. You have all the possibilities (usually rather more than less) that you have through a GUI (KDE, GNOME, Unity etc). So it doesn't make the job harder to install host or guest as command line only. The reason to leave out X11 should rather be governed by the use (you say \"server\", so it's not obvious) and the available resources. If X11 doesn't run it also won't take away resources (except for disk space).\n\nA: Yes you can run KVM on a desktop install. In fact, there is a great graphical tool, virt-manager to help configure, install, and manage guests.\n\nTo install it\nsudo apt-get install virt-manager\n\nSee https://help.ubuntu.com/community/KVM/VirtManager for details\n", "Q: How to change the Top bar's icon color The power, wireless, sound, and battery icon are black on my Top bar. I am wondering how I can change the color of these icons to a lighter color.\n\nA: You may wish to change your icon theme. Most flavors of Ubuntu ship more than one icon theme by default. How exactly you change from one to the other depends on your desktop environment (DE) because some DEs allow for changing the icon theme using a GUI available by default while others may require use of the command line interface (CLI) or the installation of additional software such as Ubuntu Tweak or GNOME Tweak Tools, MyUnity, Unsettings, etc.\nHere is a snapshot of \"Customize Look and Feel\" that Lubuntu 12.10 comes with. The active tab relates to icons themes:\n\nHere are two images of my \"top bar\" using different icon themes:  \nmodified \"elementary Dark\"\n\nmodified \"Humanity\"\n\nApart from the icon themes shipped by default, you can download others from \"the internet\".

Of late, there have been significant changes in the GUI of GNOME apps. The theme you linked to has been updated to accommodate GNOME 3.6.x.)\nWhat you have installed is the gtk theme. So, only specific aspects of your program's window are affected. If you want the \"whole appearance\", you may have to download the relevant icon theme and possibly even a window manager theme. I'm afraid you'll have to do this on your own by contacting the gtk theme's developer and asking about the icon theme and the window border theme.

What am I missing?\n\nEdit: This question is relevant for the current versions of Ubuntu (amd64 alias 64-bit, which work in UEFI mode). The boot menu option 'Test memory' is only available in BIOS mode.\n\nA: A beta version of the proprietary PassMark MemTest86 5.0 for EFI is now available:\nhttp://www.memtest86.com/download.htm\nThis should be launchable from GRUB, rEFInd, gummiboot, etc., although you may need to explicitly add a menu entry to do so. (This obviously hasn't yet been built into shipping distributions as I write.)\n\nA: I wanted an Ubuntu Live-USB keydrive with MemTest86 for 64-bit, Full-UEFI systems and I seem to have managed it.\nThis is an old question-post but this still seems to be a problem. (It took me some time to arrive at a working solution.)\n\nHere is what I did:\nI Made a New Ubuntu Keydrive\nOn a Windows 10 workstation, I used the latest Rufus to image Ubuntu 17.04 (x64) Desktop onto a 4GB USB keydrive. In Rufus, I chose:\n\n\n*\n\n*GPT for UEFI partitioning\n\n*FAT32 filesystem (I'd prefer exFAT but Rufus v2.17 would not apply an ISO w/o FAT32)\n\n*ISO Image instead of FreeDOS at the Create a bootable disk using option\n\n\nI Copied MemTest Files Onto It\nI downloaded PassMark MemTest86 a UEFI-compatible (closed-source) tool available for free. Then I:\n\n\n*\n\n*Extracted the downloaded memtest86-usb.zip to folder .\\memtest86-usb\n\n*Found the extracted disk image at .\\memtest86-usb\\memtest86-usb.img (152.7MiB)\n\n*Copied it to the \\boot folder of my new Ubuntu keydrive (mounted at, say, drive E:) to create:\n\n\n*\n\n*E:\\boot\\memtest86-usb.img\nI Configured the Bootloader\nFinally, I modified the boot options menu on the keydrive. Ubuntu 17.04 uses the grub2 bootloader. It's menu options list is configured in E:\\boot\\grub\\grub.cfg. I added the following lines to the end of that file (creating a new boot-options list-entry):\nmenuentry \"MemTest86 (long load time, be patient)\" {\n    loopback loop /boot/memtest86-usb.img\n    chainloader (loop,1)/EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.efi\n}\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows notepad should NOT be used for this edit. It plays poorly with \"unix mode\" text files and will wreck the new-line characters if you try to save any changes.\n\n*BOOTX64.efi is a 64-bit EFI executable binary image. There is a 32-bit EFI file available inside the filesystem \"looped-back\" to memtest86-usb.img. It is named BOOTIA32.efi. You could create another entry for this but I did not need it.\n\n*It does seem to take a long time to go from selecting this entry in grub2 to seeing any positive feedback on screen. On my Intel Atom X5-Z8350-based machine, the screen goes black for, maybe, 30 seconds before the MemTest86 process began to visibly boot up. Then, a dozen system-scanning steps run before you see that familiar MemTest screen. (This could be for a host of reasons, e.g. emulated filesystem, multiple bootloader handoff phases.)\n\n\n\nWhile navigating this problem-space, I took useful cues from this answer on a question similar enough to be considered a duplicate. (I do not have the system cred to mark it as such.) And, when selecting \"bootable USB-keydrive creation software\", I gained some reassurance from various resources regarding the Rufus tool.\n\nA: I was able to run memtest86+ from a Ubuntu-18.04 live-USB by pressing the one-time boot-menu key on bootup, and selecting the non-UEFI USB entry from the list (after reading the answers here that it works with non-UEFI only).\n\nA: Memtest86+\nIf you boot your computer in BIOS mode (alias CSM alias legacy mode), memtest86+ works.\nEdit {\nVersion 6 (of memtest86+) works also in UEFI mode, when secure boot is turned off.\n}\nIf you boot your computer in UEFI mode, older versions of memtest86+ will not work, because they are 16-bit programs.\nwww.memtest.org\nMemtest86\nThe original branch, memtest86 (without plus), works in UEFI mode.

According to this topic you can add it afterwards: How can I add the Memtest86+ options back to the Grub menu? but I doubt it will work: deleted comments state you still get the Error unknown command Linux16 error.\n\nI also found this:\n\nThe issue is not 16 or 32 bits boot protocol, the main issue is the numerous BIOS calls required to do the memory initialization. EFI is a nice idea, but the first time I heard \"EFI will replace BIOS in the upcoming months !!!\" was in 2002 at an Intel Developer's forum. 10 years after, UEFI replaced EFI but BIOS is still present in 99% of PC Motherboard. It's an hard task to build an EFI-readyMemtest86+, with massive code rewrite, and that version will not be compatible with legacy BIOS.

This means that you can just copy music files to it like any other folder.\nCon: It will only play the files within the folder structure that you supply. Unfortunately, this means that it's hard to make playlists.\nThis is definitely not a perfect solution, but it's the best workaround that I've found for now.\nI wonder whether there are other iOS apps that allow syncing like GoodReader, but also can re-organize files as a fully-fledged music player.\n", "Q: can only connect to one network Just installed Ubuntu 12.04 a couple of weeks ago on my HP laptop (completely replaced Windows). Everything seemed fine until a few days ago when I was unable to connect to the internet with my wireless network at home.

In each case it says that I am connected to the network, but when I open Firefox I get the message \"Firefox can't find server at start.ubuntu.com\". I also tried Google Chrome and that didn't work either. \nHowever, there is one network that I can connect to; the secure network at my school. The first time I noticed this problem was after I installed some updates at school and then went home and couldn't connect.

So you should be able to use all Qt5 libraries. Further information you could find on the Ubuntu SDK, the Qt5, the QtQuick and the QML Documentation pages.\nTo test your application on a real device you have to wait until the release of the first version of the Ubuntu Phone OS which will be released next week (February 21st).

I use laptop-mode-tools for power management on my laptop and for the life of my I cannot find where to configure the CPU frequency limits.  When I'm on battery it sets the maximum limit, regardless of governor or my manual intervention, to 1Ghz.  Normally this is good but there are some situations where I want the full 2.4Ghz out of my CPU.  However, if I set this manually through the Unity applet or via cpufreq-selector to higher than 1Ghz it is completely ignored while on battery.\nThis is extremely annoying.  I've grep'ed everything in /etc looking for configuration options.  The only thing I've found is in /etc/laptop-mode/laptop-mode.conf where the limits are simply fastest, slowest etc.  I've found references to several other files, none of which exist, I guess because cpufreqd is not installed.  I tried installing that package but the daemon immediately crashed so I guess there's a conflict between that and the laptopmode tools manager.  Any ideas?\n\nA: If I understand you correctly, you are trying to configure LMT so that it can run at max speed or ondemand even on battery, right?\nIf so, please look for power.d folder within laptop-mode directory for individual modules.  When you open cpufreq.conf, look for CONTROL_CPU_FREQUENCY=\"auto\" and set it to 1 to activate that module.  Then scroll down for further configuration.\nI'm on 12.04 LTS so let's hope it is not too different.  I'm pretty new to Linux myself so don't be offended if my answer didn't help.\nUPDATE:  I don't have any \"pointer to documentation\", sorry.  I found out a quick and painless technique to achieve your objective.\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off by editing the file /etc/laptop-mode/conf.d/cpufreq.conf (I removed mine).\n\n*Look for and set CONTROL_CPU_FREQUENCY=\"0\".\n\n*Use Ubuntu Software Center, type in search box \"indicatorfrequency\". There you will see indicator-cpufreq. Go ahead and install it.\n\n*Now, open a Terminal and type indicator-cpufreq to run it for the first time.\n\n*Restart the PC.\n\n*Voila! You should be able to selectively pick a desired speed or a governor - conservative, ondemand, powersave or performance.\n\n\nA: Eliah Kagan, you made a typo while editing my Answer.  On Ubuntu Software Center for 12.04 LTS, \"indicator frequency\" must be typed exactly in that order for indicator-cpufreq to show up.  Please watch out for typo when you are editing.

Then I rebooted as it asked but after some time a screen appeared saying No root file system is defined. Please correct this from the partitioning screen. But the drop down box is empty. \nI've tried installing Wubi in C:\\ and D:\\ but there is no difference.\n\nA: I've linked you to another answer that describes what causes this problem. If you fix it using those instructions, then you'll be able to do a normal dual boot, as well as Wubi. The same problem is affecting both. \nIf you run wubi.exe standalone (with no CD in the computer, or ISO) then it will probably work as it doesn't use ubiquity (the Ubuntu installer, which is what is kicking out that error via the parted program). It will have to download a 500MB preinstalled disk-image in that case.\nI'm adding this answer only because it's often possible to bypass the error by avoiding ubiquity and parted.

I added this command to startup applications \"/usr/bin/udisks --mount /dev/disk/by-uuid/A2E6A54AE6A52011\" and other three partitions separately. When i close and open startup applications it wont save all three partitions. It is saving only the last command added. Is there any way i can mount all partitions at system startup ? And the above procedure i followed is also opening that system partition resulting to delay in boot. If possible tell how to just mount all partitions but not to open all. But i want all partitions to be mount automatically. Please help me.\nImage of what i edited fstab\nThe last three lines are the lines I added.\nAccording to your first suggestion.\n\nAccording to your second suggestion.\n\nThis is the result of both edits.\n\nOk... Let me be more specific...The image below shows all the partitions of my internal hard disk.\n1. I Just want to mount the partitions labeled\n  (a) Sumana(Backups),\n  (b) Movies,Doc's and Songs\n  (c) Personal\n\nThis is the output of df -h\n\nThis is the output of cat /etc/fstab\n\nAnd this is the uuid of all partitions\n.\nNow i want to mount sda3, sda5 and sda7 if possible even windows partition sda2. \nSorry if I'm bothering you brother. I had Unix as subject and now I'm interested in learning commands and customizing like this. And i wanted to mount. \nHope I've uploaded all outputs you want.\n\nA: You should add the partitions in question to your /etc/fstab. The following line will automatically mount /dev/hda2 at boot (that's hidden in the flag default). \n/dev/hda2   /   ext2    defaults    1 1\n\nIf you don't want to mount, you would issue noauto amongst your options. In your question you appear to be using uuids to address your partitions. You should probably write something like:\nUUID=A2E6A54AE6A52011   /mnt/somedisk  auto   defaults 0 0\n\nUsing man fstab  you can learn the specifics of the file's syntax.\n\nUpdate after you posted your fstab and so on.\nYou really did screw up the mounting. I am surprised you can boot with four devices mounted into the same mount point /. Presumably, it mounts the first (your all important root partiation /dev/sda8) and then fails with mount point not empty when it tries the others (or some other error dependent on the type of file systems involved)\nAt any rate, you need to learn about fstab. Have a look at some of the first google hits for understanding fstab.\n\nSo here is what you should do:\nFirst create the mountpoints:\nsudo mkdir /mnt/sda2 /mnt/sda3 /mnt/sda5 /mnt/sda7\n\nIf you wish you can be more creative with the names. You can also put them somewhere other than /mnt. Your choice.\nNext edit your /etc/fstab and put in lines for each of them\n/dev/sda2 /mnt/sda2 auto defaults 0 0\n/dev/sda3 /mnt/sda3 auto defaults 0 0 \n/dev/sda5 /mnt/sda5 auto defaults 0 0 \n/dev/sda7 /mnt/sda7 auto defaults 0 0 \n\nI think you had a spare whitespace between the slash and the mnt/sda. These things matter since you broke the mount point into two.\nThen, do not reboot. You should be able to test it saying:\nsudo mount /mnt/sda2 # and so on for the other partitions\n\nIf that works, on next boot they should all come up. If you wish you can replace /dev/sda2 and so on with their respective UUID\nfootnote instead of screenshots, simple text would have made it possible for me to copy and paste your fstab. As it is, it's pretty but uses more bandwidth and conveys less usable information.\n\nA: You can easily do it using \"Storage Device Manager\".\nTo install Storage Device Manager run \nsudo apt-get install pysdm\n\nAfter the installation run the \"Storage Device Manager\".\nFrom the left hand side panel choose the partition you want to be mounted on startup. \nThen click on “Assistant” on the right side. \nNow check the “The file system is mounted at boot time” and uncheck the “Mount file system in read-only mode”.\nWhen done click the “OK” button then hit “Apply”.\nNow Restart to see the effects.\n", "Q: update-binfmts warning I'm running Lubuntu on a netbook and I've installed Oracle's JDK.

However when i wanted to install something by apt later, it told me that some dependencies didn't meet. So is there any chance that i can get apt to realize that there is something newer than the packages in its repositories?\n\nA: Yes, instead of using make install you can use the checkinstall utility.\nWhat this does is instead of using make to copy all the required files directly to your file system, checkinstall runs make install in a virtual environment, waits till it completes, then compiles the resulting \"installed\" files into a .deb package.\nThe typical way of running checkinstall:\n./configure\nmake\nsudo checkinstall\n\nDuring checkinstall you give the package a name and version number.\nYou can then install this .deb package with sudo dpkg -i packagename.deb and then dpkg (and therefore also APT) will know that this package is installed.  (It won't, however, know what packages it depends on, but most stuff you compile yourself will be self-sufficient, maybe statically linked).\nIf the package name you chose matches the package name of a package in the repos, then it will be treated by APT as another choice of version for that package - and if it's higher than the version in the repos, it will by default leave it alone.\nThis is a relatively clean way to install things, too, because it lets you \"uninstall\" the software easily too.\n", "Q: Is Ubuntu developer's preview going to be installable on Nexus 10 (besides Nexus 7)?

I don't know if the same code will run on Slax, because of the string \"-A8\", but for this purpose you don't need the \"-A8\", but Slax does have the dmesg package, so instead you can just run the following:\ndmesg | grep CD-ROM\n\n", "Q: Checking LibreOffice-saved Microsoft Word files I'm looking for a method to verify that a .doc or .docx file that has been created in Microsoft Word, and then modified in Ubuntu (in my case, with LibreOffice) will look the same when I give it to people using Microsoft Word.\nUnfortunately, they need the ability to edit it afterward, or I would just export the files as pdfs.\nI can see that the files remain more or less the same, but what I'd like is to be able to check it every time before I send the file back.

When I tried to install it through Steam it said TF2 was about 11GB and I there was only 2GB available so I couldn't install it. \nSo I checked my harddrive and my external one I was running Ubuntu on, the external one had at least 400 Gigabytes free and the other one had about 180.\nWhat's going on? and How do I fix it?\nOutput of df -h\nFilesystem Size Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n/dev/loop0 3.9G 1.1G 2.6G 30% /\nudev 1.9G 4.0K 1.9G 1% /dev\ntmpfs 752M 908K 751M 1% /run\nnone 5.0M 0 5.0M 0% /run/lock\nnone 1.9G 868K 1.9G 1% /run/shm\nnone 100M 56K 100M 1% /run/user\n/dev/sdb1 466G 20G 446G 5% /host\n/dev/loop1 3.9G 2.1G 1.6G 58% /usr\n/dev/loop2 3.9G 840M 2.9G 23% /home\n/dev/sda3 454G 286G 168G 64% /media/isaac/Acer\n\n\nSo I tried adding a library folder in /media/isaac/Acer but this error came up in steam: \n\n\"New Steam library folder must be on a filesystem mounted with execute permissions\"\n\nI have never seen this error before and I did a bit of research about it and I still have no idea how to fix it. A bit of information I don't know if this helps but I think (it might be FAT 32, neeed to double check) I'm running Ubuntu off a NTFS External hard drive.\n\nA: What you probably want to try is tell steam to set-up a different install directory for your games. You can do this fairly easy by going to: \nSettings->Downloads+Cloud->Steam Library Folders->Add Library folder.\nAfter doing this every game you install will ask you what library folder to install into. Just select one that has plenty of space and that should do the trick.\n\nA: Judging by the number of loop mounts, I'm guessing this is a Ubuntu-in-Windows wubi installation?\nSteam by default is installed in your /home partition (in /home/USERNAME/.local/share/Steam - files and folders starting with a dot are hidden, use View->Show Hidden Files to see them). This is only a 4GB partition so no room for TF2.\nYou can create additional steam libraries or move the whole installation to another partition. See the answers to this question.\nI think (but am not certain) that you cannot use a FAT32 partition for Steam, since FAT32 has a maximum file size of 4GB and game installations generally require larger files.\nIt is possible to make the /host disk (presumably your windows C: drive) writable to Ubuntu, but not recommended, since this allows you to accidentally damage your windows installation.\n", "Q: Are there any alternative time and date applets for Gnome Panel?

I have tried adding the gnome-screensaver on autostart settings, which I read somewhere (go to settings manager>sessions and startup>application autostarts>add [gnome-screensaver]), but that doesn't work. \nHow can I make my xubuntu request a password after suspension?\n\nA: I would like to add to this...\nA key component is that light-locker must be running in order for screen locking to work! I was stuck on this for a while, because the answers provided were not working for me, which didn't make any sense. Then I tried fiddling around with light-locker for a bit and realized that it wasn't set to run automatically on startup (thus, screen locking was not working in general, not just on suspend). Upon re-enabling light-locker from startup, these solutions worked :-)\nLong story short: if these solutions aren't working for you, go to whisker menu --> settings --> session and startup --> application autostart, and make sure that \"screen locker\" is ticked. \n\nA: In Xubuntu 12.10, session is no longer locked when you Suspend, so it doesn't ask for a password on wakeup. To solve this, we need to make changes to xfce4-session and xfce4-power-manager.\nUsing Terminal Commands\nRun the following commands in terminal (press Ctrl + Alt + T) to make changes to both xfce4-session and xfce4-power-manager to lock the session when you Suspend:\nxfconf-query -c xfce4-session -p /shutdown/LockScreen -s true\nxfconf-query -c xfce4-power-manager -p /xfce4-power-manager/lock-screen-suspend-hibernate -s true\n\nAlternatively — Using GUI\nWe need to make changes in both Session and Startup as well as Xfce Power Manager.\nYou would find both of them to be available under Settings Manager. Right Click on your Desktop and navigate through Applications → Settings → Settings Manager to open it.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Session and Startup\nOpen Session and Startup → navigate to the Advanced Tab → put a checkmark next to Lock screen before sleep.\n\n\n*Xfce Power Manager\nOpen Xfce Power Manager → click on Extended in the sidebar → put a checkmark next to Lock screen when going for suspend/hibernate.\n\nOnce you have made the changes, you should be asked for the password when you wakeup after Suspend.\n\nAcknowledgement: Information and images for Session and Startup and Xfce Power Manager courtesy this Ubuntu Forums Thread.\n\nA: I solved this with a script, tied to keyboard shortcut: CTRL+SUPER+DELETE.\nCreate the script in /usr/local/bin, and call it something like lock_and_suspend:\n$ sudo gedit /usr/local/bin/lock_and_suspend\n\nHere's the script:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nxscreensaver-command -lock\nsleep 2\nxfce4-session-logout --suspend\n\nUpdate its permissions:\n$ sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/lock_and_suspend\n$ sudo chmod 711 /usr/local/lock_and_suspend\n$ sudo chown yourusername /usr/local/bin/lock_and_suspend\n\nAnd run it by simply typing lock_and_suspend at the command line. Or tie lock_and_suspend to a keyboard shortcut with  SettingsManager > Keyboard > Application Shortcuts.\nIt works by simply locking the screen before suspending the system. The sleep command is necessary because the screenlock needs time to take effect. Suspend will stop it before it has finished if there is no pause between them.\nYou may need to install xscreensaver. The screenlock is usually executed by xlock4. But xlock4 just cycles through possible screenlockers such as xscreensaver and selects the one that works. I don't remember precisely why I did this. Suffice to say that it did not work when I attempted to lock the screen using xflock4 (using its default keyboard shortcut of CTRL+ALT+DEL) before suspending the system.\nAnyway, the point is that you actually to do three things: lock screen, suspend system, close lid. And from experience, you want to make sure the system is locked and suspended before closing the lid, because it's often been the case that when you rely on some setting to lock and suspend when you close the lid, it sometimes fails, and you've no way of checking without opening the lid. But since opening the lid wakes the system from suspend, how do you know if it had suspended? (It's a case of Schrödinger's cat. Or Fourdan's mouse). The only way to be sure is you lock and suspend the system before closing the lid. And the only convenient way to do this is with a single keyboard shortcut (CTRL+SUPER+DEL).\nYou might need to close backdoors to xscreensaver screenlock.\nAt some point I may have installed light-locker, and configured it to lock the screen. I don't remember if this was actually necessary.\n$ sudo apt install light-locker\n$ xfconf-query -c xfce4-session -p /general/LockCommand -s \"light-locker-command --lock\" --create -t string\n\nIt might also be necessary to enable xscreensaver and power manager in Settings > Sesstion and Startup > Application Autostart. And perhaps to uninstall / disable gnome-screensaver.\nYou might want to install xfce4-power-manager, and to configure it (using settings manager or xfce4-power-manager --customize) to 'suspend', 'when laptop lid is closed'. In that case, you might need to configure power manager to handle the lid close event properly. But I was inclined to lock+suspend before closing the lid.\n", "Q: Run MySQL Command In Background - nohup I need to run in background mode some mysql-query...\nBut how can i do this with nohup?\nStandardly i do:\nmysql -uroot -p\nuse SomeDb;\nSelect * from blablalba;\n\nBut how can i do this with launching in db process?\ni do mysql importing with nohup, but how with query?\n\nA: mysql -u [username] -p [database_name] -e \"[sql_query]\"\n\nExample: \nnohup mysql -u root -p somedb -e \"select * from mytable\" &\n\n\nA: Thanks this helped  However, I needed to enter a password after the command, so I did the following:\n\n$ nohup mysql -u [username] -p [database_name] -e \"[sql_query]\"\nEnter password:\n\n\nSince I couldn't successfully run the command in the background, after entering the password at the prompt I closed my connection (by closing my remote console).

And in your boot.ini there are two completely different option. I think the 'boomgr' thing is a red-herring. Even XP has the Windows Boot Manager, just it takes its entries from the boot.ini file.\nWhat I'd do is, figure out which partition has the boot flag - not C:. Then modify it's boot.ini.

You may want to untick Consider recommended packages as dependencies if you're concerned about installing stuff that isn't essential. I've left that option ticked.  \n\n\nA: you may want to have a look at aptitude man pages or at the debian packages documentation \nhttp://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-faq/ch-pkg_basics.en.html.\nshort answer is: aptitude/apt automatically takes care of a package's dependency list by installing everything is required. The version of the packages to be installed is chosen according to your preferences (e.g. pinning rules, etc) and to what a package requires (e.g. a particular version of something). when you remove a package, aptitude/apt usually removes everything which seems not to be needed anymore. Obviously, it can happen that a particular package has a dependency list partially shared with another one, and that's why sometimes aptitude does not remove everything. Sometimes you end up installing something by hand (a *.deb from a random place) and apt can have troubles understanding what to remove. \n", "Q: Why and how firefox shows youtube video despite all plugins are disabled, including Shockwave flash ones?

In my motherboard BIOS I have set the memory clock speed to 2133MHz. However, when I check my RAM speed through the terminal with lshw and dmidecode --type 17 it shows my speeds as 800MHz.\nAre lshw and dmidecode showing the wrong information? Can Ubuntu take advantage of my higher speed RAM at all?\nSpecs:\n\n\n*\n\n*CPU: AMD A10-5800k\n\n*RAM: 8GB (2x4GB) G.Skill Ares @ 2133MHz\n\n*Mobo: Asrock FM2A85X-ITX\n\n\nlshw results: \n\ndmidecode results: \n\n(running Ubuntu 12.10 and using AMDs 13.1 Catalyst drivers)\n\nA: First, memory has two read/write cycles per clock one. So you should multiply clock speed by two to get your memory speed. That means that lshw is reporting 1.600 Mhz.\nSecond according to AMD specs your CPU only supports DDR2 up to 1866 Mhz, so we are quite close to the real result. In the same specs you can see that your GPU speed is just 800 Mhz, what makes me wonder if the real bus speed of your CPU is 800 Mhz, that would explain your memory speed but not the 1866 number in the AMD speed.\nI have found a review benchmarking your CPU and a similar memory. To be able to find any difference they needed to overclock the GPU.\nSo unless you overclock your GPU, your new memory is not going to make any difference.\n\nA: I realize this is an old post however, dmidecode doesn't report the actual RAM speed or its overclocked setting, it reports whatever is hardcoded in the ram chips themselves. If the ram is coded at 1600, dmidecode generally calls out 800mhz as others mentioned 800x2=1600. If you OC'd it to 2133 in your BIOS then you can rest assured it is OC'd to 2133 (your bios splash should report it during boot if its enabled). The GSkill ram chips you bought are baseline 1600 and that is what is hardcoded in them as reported by dmidecode, along with the other info that dmidecode collects from the chip itself. No doubt if you run memtest86 you will see the speed set at 2133mHz. dmidecode is a useful tool but not for checking actual ram speed.\n", "Q: Avoiding the execution upon its installation ldap-auth-config I am trying to automate (by using a bash script) the installation of packages for LDAP authentication.

After a few seconds, a white background a bit larger appears underneath like this:\n \nI've attempted to overcome this by trying a number of changes in the configuration file .conkyrc and the only effective one was changing own_window_type value from override to normal. But then I not only have this conky disappear when I choose to minimize all windows, but it also displays a transparent background of the same size like this:\n\nMy conky window settings are like this:\nupdate_interval 1\ntotal_run_times 0\ncpu_avg_samples 1\nnet_avg_samples 1\nno_buffers yes\ndouble_buffer yes\nimlib_cache_size 0\n\nbackground yes\nown_window yes\nown_window_type override\nown_window_transparent yes\nown_window_hints undecorated,below,sticky,skip_taskbar,skip_pager\nminimum_size 300 480\nmaximum_width 300\nalignment top_right\ngap_x 2\ngap_y 28\n\ndraw_borders no\ndraw_graph_borders no\nstippled_borders 0\nborder_inner_margin 0\nborder_outer_margin 0\nborder_width 0\n\ntext_buffer_size 1024\noverride_utf8_locale yes\nuse_xft yes\nxftfont Ubuntu:size=10\nxftalpha 1.0\nuppercase no\ntemperature_unit celsius\ndraw_shades no\ndraw_outline no\ndefault_color C0C0C0\ndefault_shade_color 000000\ndefault_outline_color C0C0C0\ncolor1 C0C0C0\ncolor2 B2B2B2\ncolor3 808080\ncolor4 D4D4D4\n\nTEXT\n${image ~/.conky/base.png -p 0,0 -s 300x480}\nCan somebody tell what might be causing (and how can I overcome) this unwanted canvas underneath my conky window?\n\nA: A):\nYour .conkyrc states own_window yes. This means that conky has it's own window. By stating own_window_type normal the window is being told to act \"normally\". Thus the conky-window will as well as any other window minimize when the \"Show desktop\" option is used.\nB):\nWhat would keep conky in its place is changing own_window_type normal to own_window_type dock. The drawback of this method is having to place conky on the right spot on your desktop again using gap x and gap y. Gap x is now counted from the left side of the desktop edge instead of the right side. Gap y is still counted from above. So suppose your screen resolution is 1440x900 and gap x used to be 2 and conky maximum with is 300, the new gap x would be 1440-300-2=1138\nC):\nIn addition, to entirely lose any visible dock borders change the line own_window_transparent yes with the lines: own_window_argb_visual yes and own_window_argb_value 0. If own_window_argb_value is set to 255 the conky window will have no transparency and be black.\nFor further configuration settings:\nhttp://conky.sourceforge.net/config_settings.html\n\nA: I've found a solution to the unwanted shadow here: http://linuxexchange.org/questions/821/how-to-avoid-ugly-compizgnome-shadow-for-conky\n\n\n*\n\n*Start the CompizConfig Settings Manager\n\n*Select Effects > Window Decoration\n\n*Go into Shadow windows box and after the value any add & !(class=Conky) to apply this rule to all windows except Conky\n\n\nThis is in deed a workaround rather than a solution, because why Conky draws a larger window than needed still remains a mystery to me ;-)\n\n\n*\n\n*Note: Probably this also requires adding this line to the conky\nconfig file: own_window_class Conky\n\n*Note: A workaround for the black background appearing for some minutes under Ubuntu 13.04: add a command to change desktop wallpaper back and forth after the conky command, e.g. sleep 5 && conky -c /home/user/.conkyrc && sleep 2 && gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri file:///home/user/Pictures/bckgrnd.jpg && gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri file:///home/user/Pictures/background.jpg\n\nA: I had the exact same problem on 12.10 but found that opening the panel or a terminal (which I set to be transparent) made the white background go away.  Annoying, but simple to solve - I assume it was something to do with how the display handles any transparency.\nJust got 13.04 though, and now that trick doesn't work.  Picking away at it, I'm so far getting the transparency working if I set the following:\nown_window yes\nown_window_type dock\nown_window_transparent yes\n\nThe only downside is that the Conky window now aligns itself to the left of the screen (used to be on the right), so I've had to shift it over with the following:\nalignment tr\ngap_x 1120\ngap_y 55\n\nAnnoyingly, this means that if my display resolution changes (I often plug into a projector at work, for example), the Conky window isn't going to be there, but it's a start.  Hope this helps.\n\nA: Here are some of the parameters I use:\noverride_utf8_locale yes\nown_window no\nown_window_colour 313131    # Black\nown_window_hints undecorated,below,sticky,skip_taskbar,skip_pager\n#own_window_hints below,sticky,skip_taskbar,skip_pager\nown_window_transparent no\nown_window_type normal  ## normal\n\n${image ~/BOX/conkybg1.png -p -50,-44 -s 380x500}\n\nI had problems with image being too small.  I just started tweaking the size parameters and got it to work.   \nAs you may notice the own_window is set to no.  If yes, then my image would not work. It was just a mess.\nThis may or may not help you. I hope it is of some help.\n\nA: How about this:\nOn the file ~/conkyrc locate\nown_window_type override\n\nreplace it for\nown_window_type desktop\n\nand add\nown_window_argb_visual yes\n\nThat did it for me.\n", "Q: Why is this `cp` command trying to remove files?

I want to design a sudo rule that will allow the user ricardo to update the system using aptitude, but prevent him from using sudo to run any other command (he's a problem user). Are there any pitfalls to this rule that I'm missing?\nricardo  ALL=(root) /usr/bin/aptitude\n\nRicardo only uses aptitude, not apt-get. Also, I don't have Ubuntu installed anywhere at the moment, so I understand that /usr/bin/aptitude might not be the exact right file to allow. \nIf there are pitfalls to this rule, how can I improve it?\n\nA: This command will restrict the user from using aptitude for anything but updating the repository cache and performing a safe upgrade of the system. \nricardo ALL=(root) /usr/bin/aptitude update, /usr/bin/aptitude safe-upgrade\n\nA similar command will allow the user to perform a full upgrade, but nothing more:\nricardo ALL=(root) /usr/bin/aptitude update, /usr/bin/aptitude full-upgrade\n\nPer aptitude's documentation (10.04), safe-upgrade:\n\nUpgrades installed packages to their most recent version. Installed\n             packages will not be removed unless they are unused\n\nIn contrast, full-upgrade:\n\nUpgrades installed packages to their most recent version, removing\n             or installing packages as necessary. This command is less\n             conservative than safe-upgrade and thus more likely to perform\n             unwanted actions. However, it is capable of upgrading packages that\n             safe-upgrade cannot upgrade.\n\nUse your best judgement for which the user should be allowed to run. If you're unsure, use the first rule, which only allows safe-upgrade.\nNote that if you want to allow a user to install packages (which greatly reduces any benefit to security, but hypothetically), you need to include a * after the aptitude command, i.e.\nricardo ALL=(root) /usr/bin/aptitude update, /usr/bin/aptitude safe-upgrade, /usr/bin/aptitude install *\n\nOtherwise, you will receive an error message that user ricardo is not allowed to run the command /usr/bin/aptitude install <package_name>. \n\nA: You can use sudo -l to see which commands a user is allowed to run. For instance, to see which commands ricardo can run:\nsudo -ll -U ricardo\n\nto see whether he can run aptitude,\nsudo -ll -U ricardo /usr/bin/aptitude\n\nthis will either print the command name as it's expanded by sudo, or exit with code 1 if the user is not allowed to use the command.\nThis should work in any recent debian-based system for you to test; the syntax is not Ubuntu-specific.\nsource: man sudo\n\nA: I can not actually see anything wrong with that sudoers line.

Fortunately, what I can do is give you a line that I do know is safe:\nricardo ALL=/usr/bin/aptitude\n\nThis line is guaranteed to only let ricardo execute aptitude as root, as long as ricardo is not a member of a sudo-enabled group, such as sudo or admin.\nSource: 8 Ways to Tweak and Configure Sudo on Ubuntu - How-to Geek.\n", "Q: Manual mounting of cifs works fine, but not in fstab I have a mounting problem that drives me mad at the moment...\nUsing the manual mounting command\nsudo mount -t cifs //192.168.1.1/shareName /media/shareName -o uid=1000,gid=1000,rw,username='domain/name',password=pw\n\nI am able to mount my network share without any problem.

I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 and at least once a week I get important and recommended updates. These weekly updates are normally between 50-100 Mb, and sometimes they're over 200 Mb.\nI haven't installed anything new in a few months, but those large updates keep coming fairly consistently. It's hard to know what I'm actually downloading, but since it's labeled as important and recommended, it's hard to reject it.\nMy question: when I download that 100 Mb update, does the stuff it replaces get thrown away, or will I just keep accumulating more and more data just by running my system? \n\nA: In general, updates to existing packages will overwrite existing files, and the installed size should stay the same, give or take a few percent.\nSome packages are installed in parallel - for instance, each new kernel version is installed alongside the existing version (so that you can revert should the new version not work). Each kernel update adds O(100MB) to the installation, which will not automatically be freed until upgrade to a new Ubuntu version (but you can manually remove the older kernel packages).\nThe .deb packages recently installed by updates are stored in /var/cache/apt/archives. This directory can grow quite large - you can (harmlessly) clear it out with sudo apt-get clean if space usage becomes a problem.\n\nA: Ubuntu has no support for incremental updates. That is why you need to download the whole package even if few bytes were changed. \nWhen you instal updates only kernel packages are accumulate. This can let you recover your system in case of problems with new kernel. Other updates replace existing data and do not require much extra space, if any, except for cached *.deb files in /var/cache/apt/archives.\n", "Q: Ubuntu SDK does not install on Ubuntu 12.04 64bit?

I have an ACER C7 Chromebook with Ubuntu 12.04 installed.  Also I have two apps installed Bluetooth Manager and Bluetooth.  \nI am trying to connect an MEElectronics AF9-BK Air-Fi Stereo Bluetooth Wireless Headset with Microphone to Ubuntu. I have tried to set up the new device and pair, but the headset is never recognized.\nI checked hard and soft setting for Bluetooth and they are on.\nI am new to Ubuntu 12.04 and Linux and need specific instructions.\n\nA: For those using Ubuntu Studio:\n\n\n*\n\n*If not installed, Install blueman (Bluetooth manager) and pulseaudio-module-bluetooth\nsudo apt-get install blueman pulseaudio-module-bluetooth \n\n\n*Once you insert USB Bluetooth dongle, the Bluetooth icon appears in the top panel.\n\n*Turn on the headset, and go to Sound Settings > app/player and choose your headset (by name) \n\n*Go to the Configuration tab, click the headset name, and choose high fidelity.\n\n\nA: I was wrestling with bluetooth headsets off and on for years, with very limited success. I was able to get bluez/blueman working, pair the device, and even transfer audio using a command line program with a manually-entered device name. That did me no good, though. Only one application was able to find and use my headset (ALSA's discovery API doesn't seem to work with BT headsets) and even that app now fails in its most recent version. I have read that PulseAudio makes bluetooth headsets a bit easier, but since Pulse is not viable for me, the situation is still pretty bad.\nThen I found this little gadget:\nJabra LINK 360 UC USB Adapter\nIt pairs with a bluetooth headset, but presents itself to the computer as a USB sound device instead of a bluetooth adapter. Every application I have is able to discover and use it because it doesn't require any bluetooth support in the operating system. It completely solved my problem.\nJabra is the only company that I'm certain makes such a thing. They also made one or two earlier models that can be found for less money. I chose the new one mainly because it's so tiny. I have heard that Creative makes something similar; perhaps their BT-D1 or BT-W2. If someone knows of others, please post links.\n\nA: You'll need to install these additional packages:\nsudo apt-get install pulseaudio pulseaudio-module-bluetooth pavucontrol bluez-firmware\n\nThen follow the procedure in Takkat's answer.\n\nA: Default Ubuntu Bluetooth Pairing\n\n*\n\n*Open the Bluetooth setting by clicking on the Bluetooth symbol on the top panel:\n\n\n*Choose + in the bottom left corner of the following window:\n\n\n*Put your Bluetooth device in \"Pairing Mode\". Check with your manual on how to do this.\nThe MEElectronics AF9-BK headset will enter pairing mode by turning the device OFF and then pressing and holding the multifunction button for 7 s until the blue light remains permanently on.\n\n*Then Proceed with \"Continue\" to enable \"new device setup\" in Ubuntu.\n\n*The device should now be recognized:\n\n\n*Select the new device. In case we use a non-default PIN for pairing we may give \"PIN options\" but this is usually not needed.  Press \"Continue\" to finish setup.\n\n*Go to the \"Sound Settings\" on the top panel menu:\n\n\n*Choose your headset as audio output or input device, and give in the \"Mode\" for Bluetooth service. Note that the microphone will not be available in A2DP mode:\n\nIn case we had used the headset on a different device, or when pairing failed we may have to repeat the pairing procedure. Before we can do so we may have to remove the device first (this is done in step 2. above by pressing -).\n\nParing with Blueman (here shown for Lubuntu):\n\n*\n\n*Open Bluetooth Manager from Preferences menu.\n\n*Put your headset in pairing mode (see 3. above)\n\n*Then choose \"Search\":\n\n\n*Select the new device and choose the keys symbol for pairing:\n\n\n*Enter the PIN code (for headsets this is usually is 0000):\n\n\n*Right click on the device to select the Bluetooth service:\n\n\nAlso see the following questions:\n\n*\n\n*Bluetooth from the command line in 12.04?\n\n\n*Autoconnecting Bluetooth Devices\n\n\n*pavucontrol doesn't show Bluetooth headset\n\nA: Use default Ubuntu Bluetooth Pairing.\nWait for some time and you’ll see that Ubuntu has recognized your Bluetooth speakers as headsets.\n\nOnce found, Ubuntu will try to setup the device. Have patience. Just wait for a few minutes. If the device setup fails or it asks for a password, try to restart both Ubuntu and speakers, it did work for me. Check also that you don't have another active bluetooth device nearby that interferes with your connection.\nThen if the connection succeeds go to the Sound Settings on the top panel menu and enable your bluetooth device.\n\nA: Now it works for me more or less out of the box for any version 16.04 or above.\nWhen you're connecting or pairing make sure you select Audio Sink then connect your device. \nGo to System > Preferences > Hardware > Sound then go to Hardware panel and select your device. You can then test your device.\n\nA: In Ubuntu 18.04 Gnome there is something slightly different. I needed to do in shorten this (RIVAARENA):\nIn ubuntu 18.04 it is possible to pair and use RIAARENA (in Home or Away switch). Pairing is done/undone by the left part of cradle button ((.)) on the device. Than it is better and sometimes needed to install pulse audio to pair device with player programme - e.q. VLC, Firefox stream, Rhytmbox etc. Pulse Audio -> Configuration. Setup Analog Stereo Duplex, Check if RIVAARENA is on the list.\n\nGo to -> Playback Tab. There are all runnig playback applications.\nPush button on the left to choose RIVAARENA output for the proper app.\n\nMostly there is delay between sound and video stream. Go to -> Output devices tab to setup proper latency offset (in my case it is maximum 2000ms still little late!).\nDocumentation which helped me very well:\nIntel Q/A https://communities.intel.com/thread/62848. There is very detailed written what to do.\n\nA: From:\nPulseAudio can not load bluetooth module\nsudo pactl unload-module  module-bluetooth-discover \nsudo pactl load-module  module-bluetooth-discover \n\nThen repair\nOr in my case I had to not use sudo!\nThis is the quick option, you can see the \"correct\" option if you follow the link.\n\nA: I had this problem. First uninstall then reinstall related packages:\nsudo apt remove pulseaudio pulseaudio-module-bluetooth pavucontrol bluez-firmware\nsudo apt install pulseaudio pulseaudio-module-bluetooth pavucontrol bluez-firmware\n\nPair the device, then run\npavucontrol\n\nand configure your Bluetooth device to use whatever mode will work. a2dp worked for me.\n", "Q: Programmer AND student on Ubuntu? I'm currently set up with a Windows 7 PC for work, with notepad++ and Sublime Text 2, and a XAMPP server.  I'm also using the PC for studying.\nI'm considering switching to Ubuntu, but I wanna make sure I don't lose functionality.\nThe thing is I've heard badly about the LibreOffice and OpenOffice compared to Microsoft Office. Is there anything about LibreOffice and OpenOffice I should know? \nAlso is there a good multiple programming language, syntax highlighting editor built in to Ubuntu, or a good one anyone can recommend?\n\nA: You ask two questions in your post which might be better as two posts, but I'll try to answer both as best I can.\nRegarding MS Office vs LibreOffice, I find LibreOffice good enough for everyday use.  LibreOffice has a couple of weak spots:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you take a MS Office doc, edit it in LibreOffice, then open it in MS Office and try to work with it, you will often find some of the formatting has changed.  If you have to do this often, you will likely give up on LibreOffice.\n\n*If you have used MS Office all day long for months on end and have learned every keyboard shortcut, you will be thrown off by the change.  Don't expect to have everything work exactly the same.\n\n\nIf these issues do not apply to you, or you are willing to put in a bit of extra effort to relearn old habits, you will be happy with LibreOffice.\nRegarding your question about programming editors, Ubuntu (and Linux in general) have a great set of choices.  These editors are available on Ubuntu, OS X and Windows so you won't have to give up on them if you don't like Ubuntu.  These are my favorites:\n\n\n*\n\n*Sublime Text 2 - A great all around editor.  Code is rendered beautifully with a beautiful font.  Good, simple project management through the sidebar.  It also has this thing on the right hand side that gives an overview of the whole file.  For the spatial learner like me this is huge.  I often can't remember what the function is called but I know where it is in the file.  This is a for-pay program, but there are no limitations when you download it, only an annoy-box that pops up on save occasionally.\n\n*Emacs - A great tool for manipulating text.  People joke that it is capable enough to be an operating system, so be prepared for a learning curve.  Many commands are multiple key combinations, like Ctrl-x, Ctrl-s to save a file.\n\n*Vim/Gvim - Another great tool for manipulating text.  I find it a little less polished than emacs, but for some reason I find myself using it more.  It is an example of a Modal editor, which means that in one mode you can edit text like normal, but then you can switch out of it and suddenly almost every key on the keyboard means something else.  It is very powerful if you take time to learn it.\n\n\nThere are other tools like Eclipse (it is utterly giant, but it shines with Java code), gedit (installed everywhere), Bluefish (good for html).  I personally wouln't put in the time to learn anything unless it is available for all 3 platforms.\nGood luck with school!\n\nA: I use Ubuntu for work - and I often need to create/edit office docs that are used by other people using MS Office.   I have tried using LibreOffice/OpenOffice for this in the past, and did occasionally run into issues where what they saw in the docment wasn't what I saw.\nToday I use a licensed copy of MS Office on Ubuntu with CrossOver, and it generally works quite well.  \nYou mention that you are a student - If you are creating documents to submit for assignments, I would not recommend submitting .doc or .ppt files created with LibreOffice - the teacher might not see what you see.\nIf you can submit PDFs, then I'd be more comfortable - as long as you review the PDF before submitting to make sure it says what you meant it to.\nmore generally, if you use LibreOffice to create content and share with others via printing or converting to PDF, you probably won't have issues...\n\nA: Very subjective question... In my opinion, LibreOffice isn't any worth than MOffice, in differents ways. It may be uglier, but I find it more open, and that matters to me.\nFor the IDE, gedit is built-in and support a lot a language and has a lot of plugins. You also have some serious Java IDE like Eclipse, NetBeans and IntelliJ, or C# one like MonoDevelop. Well almost any language can be code from Ubuntu.\nI went there one day, and I'll never come back to Windows.\nHave fun !\n\nA: I think you should install LibreOffice on Windows 7 first and satisfy yourself that you are prepared to go where Microsoft Office is unavailable, especially if you must continue to interchange documents with Microsoft Office users.  \nMicrosoft Office and LibreOffice will co-exist on Windows 7 machine with no problem.  LibreOffice provides more bidirectionality with Microsoft Office at the moment (saving back in OOXML, not just binary Office formats), and it is probably included in the Ubuntu distribution.\nThe question about programming editors also depends on what programming languages and other development tools you expect to be using.  While there should be no problem, you might want to double-check whether the tool chain that matters to you has an appealing counterpart on Ubuntu/Linux.\n", "Q: QtCreator plugins and templates missing I just downloaded the Ubuntu phone SDK and QT creator according to the instructions.\nWhen I fire up QTCreator, I get a screen as shown \n\nIf I ignore this message and hit continue, there are no templates to create the Mobile application as indicated in the tutorial I'm following.\n\nI tried installing qt5-default and qtchooser - problem still persists.

I have made the mistake before of sharing it through CUPS before which does not ask for a user name or password. If you're adding the printer through Devices and Printers and then adding the printer by doing http://ipaddress:631/printers/nameOfPrinter chances are pretty good you've set up sharing in CUPS rather than Samba.

I am migrating my home directory from an old system to a new one, and the tarball I made contains everything, including hidden files like .bashrc. However, when I move the contents of the unpacked tarball (which are in /tmp) to my new home directory, the hidden files do not copy (mv /tmp/home/rcook/* /home/rcook/). How can I get mv to move them?\nActually, I think the problem is not with mv, but with bash's globbing. If I do this:\nmkdir a\nmkdir b\ntouch a/.foo\ntouch a/bar\nmv a/* b/\nls -a a/ b/\n\nI see this:\na/:\n.  ..  .foo\n\nb/:\n.  ..  bar\n\na/.foo did not move. So how can I get the * wildcard to find hidden files?\nYes, I suppose I could decompress the tarball directly into my home directory, but the tarball decompresses into home/rcook/..., and I want to be sure I overwrite the new .bashrc, etc. with the old, customized versions, and knowing how to find and move hidden files is a worthwhile skill. Suggestions?\n\nSome answers suggest doing something like mv src/.* dest/. However, I tried this on my test directories and got errors. Starting with:\nrcook$ ls -a a/ b/\na/:\n.  ..  bar  .foo\n\nb/:\n.  ..\nrcook$ mv a/.* b/\nmv: cannot move 'a/.' to 'b/.': Device or resource busy\nmv: cannot remove 'a/..': Is a directory\nrcook$ ls -a a/ b/\na/:\n.  ..  bar\n\nb/:\n.  ..  .foo\n\nWhat am I doing wrong?\n\nA: I know this is old, but, one simple way to do it is:\nmv a/{.*,*} b/\n\nExplanation\nThis is called brace expansion. In this case, the shell expands the path you give by concatenating the string given before the braces (in this case a/) followed by each variation given in the list surrounded by the braces.\nThe variation list is composed by values separated by commas and, again, surrounded by curly braces. So, in this case we have .* and * as elements, so the list must be {.*,*}.\nmv a/{.*,*} b/\n\nThe above expression can be read this way: move all files starting with a dot (.*) AND anything else (*) in the a/ directory to the b/ directory.\nMore hints\nThis is very helpful and can be used in various scenarios. For example, imagine you have to create 100 files with the following naming pattern: file1, file2, file3...file100. You can easily achieve it by doing this\ntouch file{1..100}\n\nIn this case, you can see a range was given. You can do this by separating the first and last values by two dots (..).\nGoing Beyond!\nI'm new to the Unix world and, even knowing this works in bash and zsh (the shells I've used so far), I can't guarantee this will work in any shell.\nYou can see more about expansions an globbing in your shell's documentation (using: man bash or man zshall, for bash and zsh respectively).\nHope this helps future readers!\n\nA: In your additions, you got errors but the code still worked. The only thing to add is that you told it only to copy the dot files. Try:\nmv src/* src/.* dst/\n\nYou will still get the errors for the . and .. entries, which is fine. But the move should succeed.\n~/scratch [andrew] $ mv from/* from/.* to/\nmv: cannot move ‘from/.’ to ‘to/.’: Device or resource busy\nmv: cannot remove ‘from/..’: Is a directory\n~/scratch [andrew] $ ls -a from/ to/\nfrom/:\n.  ..\n\nto/:\n.  ..  test  .test\n\n\nA: There isn't really such a thing as \"hidden\" files on Linux. Files which begin with a dot are just hidden from file listings by default.\nTo copy files even with a glob, you need to prefix the file with . such as mv -u .* foo and then .foo will appearn as foo/.foo when moved.\nThe -u option will only move the files when the source is newer, or the destination is missing. Or you could just ignore the errors about moving . and .. as they are special files and cannot be moved, but do get caught in the .* glob by the shell.\n\nA: You can do this :\nshopt -s dotglob\nmv /tmp/home/rcook/* /home/rcook/\n\nYou can put \nshopt -s dotglob\n\nin your ~/.bashrc if you want it to be the default.\nSee http://mywiki.wooledge.org/glob\n\nAnother approach to copy the dot files:\nmv /tmp/home/rcook/.[!.]* /home/rcook/\n\nDon't use the pattern ..* as it matches .. (pointer to the parent directory). If there are files whose name begin with two dots (..something), also use the pattern ..?*.\n\nA: If you ls -l in a directory, you will see . and .. among listed files. So, I think mv .* /dest takes those pointers into account. Try:\nmv /tmp/home/rcook/{*,.[^.]*,..?*} /home/rcook/\n\nthis will ignore those current and parent dir pointers.\nYou will get an error if any of the three patterns *, [^.]* or ..?* matches no file, so you should only include the ones that match.\n\nA: Two possible solutions I can think of. The first is to use cp instead with its recursive option, copying the current directory to the destination. \ncp -Rp . /desired/directory\n\nthen you can remove the source files in the current directory\nAlternatively, if you know the files are sanely named (no spaces, wildcards, non-printable characters), you can do something like this\nmv $(ls -A) /desired/directory\n\n\nA: So we have:\na\n|-- .foo\n`-- bar\n\nand:\nb\n\n\nI took a huge time finding better solution than all the answers here.\nThen I took 30 seconds for this command:\n$ mv --help\n\nThen I found my love:\n$ mv a/ b/ -T\n\nNote: I don't even understand the argument -T. It just did what I needed. Here it says:\n\n-T, --no-target-directory  treat DEST as a normal file\n\n\nA: In my case I was simply trying to mv a single hidden file and this was the solution:\nFILE=.myHiddenFile\nmv \"$FILE\" dest/\n\nExplanation\nAt first I was trying:\nmv .myHiddenFile dest/\n\nBut it kept producing the error:\nmv: cannot stat '.myHiddenFile': No such file or directory\n\nEven though a ls -al showed that the file and dest/ existed.\nThe reason appears to be because the shell was interpreting the \".\" in the file name, so by moving it to a variable it avoids the interpretation. There are probably other ways to resolve this, but this was enough for us.\n\nA: An alternate way is to use (GNU) find:\nfind /tmp/home/rcook/ -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -exec mv {} /home/rcook/ \\;\n\n", "Q: powertop color codes I am running powertop in Ubuntu 10.04. It shows a horizontal bar near the top that displays something like:\nWakeups-from-idle per second : 723.6    interval: 10.0s\nMy question is, why is the background color on this line red, and on rare occasions blue? What do these colors mean? Unfortunately the man page does not explain this, neither does a quick Google search.\n\nA: \nBelow the state numbers, a bar shows how often the processor was awakened in one second (Wakeups-from-idle per second). The smaller the figure, the better. If you use the Gnome desktop, you can theoretically reduce this to three wake-ups per second, although realistically a value below 20 is pretty good.

The purpose of my installation is educational - I would very much like to \"learn\" linux. \nUnfortunately, I am encountering various problems with the installation that I'm finding hard to pin down. I have tried to look for similar threads with solutions, but as I understand very little of what is going on it's hard to know what is relevant. I would very much appreciate a guiding hand to point me to things that I should know, and make sure I'm doing nothing \"wrong\". \nStory so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*First (naive) attempt to install - successful, but extremely slow (installed overnight). There was an extreme lag problem (all programs, and mouse input were lagging). The lag problem was fixed by switching the \"Enable IO APIC\" option to ON. At this point, Ubuntu was running, and seemed fully functional. However, since I had only allocated 8Gb of disk space I very quickly ran out (I immediately attempted to install full TeX support, which is quite space-hungry!). The internet made increasing disk space look like a particularly nasty chore, so I decided the easiest way would be to do a full reinstall, with 40Gb space. I deleted the functional Virtual Machine, not expecting any problems with a reinstall (retrospectively a mistake). \n\n*Several unsuccessful attempts. According to all internet sources, my Linux install should take around 40 minutes. However, the installation keeps getting stuck at different points, for hours (each time, I waited up to ~5 hours before closing and trying again). For example, one time it was stuck at something that sounded like \"post-installation trigger software-center\", and my current attempt is stuck at \"configuring hardware\".\n\n*After each new attempt, I must delete the partition and allocate a new, clean one, else the install hangs immediately, a couple of screens after the initial \"install\" button. I systematically enable the IO APIC option, otherwise the installation proceeds extremely slowly, as before.\nA couple of things I have noticed, and don't understand/am worried about\n\n\n*\n\n*Only 12Mb of \"Video Memory\" have been allocated. I'm not sure whether this is the same thing, but my host OS has access to 1Gb dedicated Video RAM.  \n\n*After deleting partitions, the free space does not seem to be recognised by my host OS. (In Windows Explorer, the free space displayed next to my C: drive decreases by 2Gb after each attempt). Perhaps this problem will solve itself? (I believe Windows 7 schedules automatic defragmentation).\nSpecs/Relevant information\n\nUbuntu version: 12.10\nVirtualBox version: 4.2.6\nHost OS: Windows 7 Home Edition (Service Pack 1)\nHardware: Aspire 5755G laptop,\n6GB RAM (1GB allocated to guest OS)\n500GB HDD (40GB allocated during unsuccessful attempts)\nIntel Core i7-2670QM, 2.2GHz\nNVIDIA GeForce GT630M, 1GB Dedi VRAM\n\nThank you in advance for your valuable time! Please don't hesitate to ask for additional information.\n\nA: VirtualBox creates a file on your Host OS within which VMs are installed. The Guest OS (Ubuntu in this case) thinks it has a hard drive, but in reality it's just accessing that large file. \nWith VirtualBox, you have a choice of formats for this file, but you'll usually use the VDI file format unless you've a good reason not to. The default setting is for VirtualBox to expand the file as necessary up to its maximum permitted size. \nIf significant additional space is being used after each installation, I think you may be doing one of two things. \n\n\n*\n\n*You may be creating new VDI files for each installation without removing the old ones. Please check the Virtual Media Manager and delete any VM images you no longer require.\n\n*You may be using the same VDI image for each installation. I don't know how this will play out with the automatic image expansion in terms of reclaiming space. I would advise that you delete the image and create a fresh one.\n\n\n\"Reinstalls\" from the same media should work in the same manner as before. If you're having trouble, just start over with a fresh VM container and disk image (i.e., create a new VM rather than overwrite an old one). Make sure any data you need is backed up.\nWith regard to the paltry 12Mb of VRAM; I also recently installed 12.10 on a Win7 box (I think it took ~ 30 minutes), and chose to \"go wild\" and increase it to 25Mb. I think the most you can assign is 256Mb. You can happily try increasing it to this level. This setting can always be adjusted later. \nNote that you may also want to enable 3D acceleration (which should improve performance), and also install Guest Additions, which besides other things gives you VM window resizing. \nUnfortunately, Unity is quite heavy on graphics requirements out-of-the-box. You may choose to install a different desktop environment, such as XFCE, Cinnamon, MATE etc, in order to improve the VM's responsiveness. Note that there are alternative distributions which come with these by default, such as Mint, which uses Cinammon. I'm by no means trying to dissuade you from using Ubuntu, but I merely highlight that there is a large ecosystem of software available for the whole hardware spectrum. \nFinally, 1GB is a reasonably conservative amount of RAM for an Ubuntu+Unity installation. You may find that better performance is achieved with 1.5-2GB, although you'll obviously have to determine whether you can spare it from the Host OS. \n", "Q: Keyboard/mouse stopped working after 12.04 upgrade So, I upgraded to 12.04 and when I booted back up, my wireless keyboard worked fine on the grub screen, but as soon as I get to the log-in screen neither the keyboard not mouse worked.

Any ideas what's up?\n\nA: I don't know if this qualifies as an answer to your question, but I had the same problem and I solved it by upgrading further to 13.10. It was nasty for me because I had no PS/2.\nI used a different system to downloaded Ubuntu 12.10 and made an install key. Then I booted my broken system off that 12.10 key.

The error occurred again after the next reboot. I deleted the partition and installed Ubuntu a plenty times but the error always occurred again after a short time. \nWhat really helped was not only to completely reinstall Ubuntu on my SSD, but also to leave some unallocated disc space (for new SSDs about 7%) on the SSD and not formatting the whole space. Since then I never had the error again. \n", "Q: Connect to hidden wireless in Ubuntu Touch I'm trying out the developer preview for Touch, and unfortunately I don't have public WiFi I can connect to.

While dpkg will install package, it does not resolve dependencies and install missing packages for you. You'll need to install them with apt to pull from archives, or if you have a .deb of the package you need, you'll need to install it first, or at the same time as your new package, using dpkg.\nWhat you are describing is a Depends which the resulting binary package has, not a Build-Depends which the source package would need to build. Placing all of the binary package runtime dependencies inside the Build-Depends in your control file, is a good way to prevent building a package without them installed. It's also good practice to enumerate all of the dependencies you have, rather than relying on dependencies being satisfied by other packages you depend on requiring them as well, to prevent breaking if the dependency gets dropped from the other package you also need.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Mobile Installation Stuck at \"The device needs to be unlocked for the following to work\" Nexus 7 Like the title says, it just asks for my password and then gets stuck.

I'm using cloud-init to provision servers in AWS, and would like my servers to send an email when they're done (whether they fail or succeed). For successful cloud-init runs, the solution is trivial. cloud-init has a built-in module for this kind of thing. From the the source:\n# When cloud-init is finished running including having run \n# cloud_init_modules, then it will run this command.  The default\n# is to emit an upstart signal as shown below.

I did \"sudo modprobe brcmsmac\" and it's showing it enabled in lsmod:\ncolin@MacBookPro:~$ lsmod | grep brc\nbrcmsmac              531905  0 \nmac80211              540032  2 brcmsmac,b43\nbcma                   35657  2 brcmsmac,b43\nbrcmutil               14756  1 brcmsmac\ncfg80211              206797  3 brcmsmac,b43,mac80211\ncordic                 12575  1 brcmsmac\n\nHowever, lspci shows bcma being used:\n03:00.0 Network controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM4331 802.11a/b/g/n (rev 02)\n    Subsystem: Broadcom Corporation BCM4331 802.11a/b/g/n\n    Flags: bus master, fast devsel, latency 0, IRQ 17\n    Memory at b0600000 (64-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=16K]\n    Capabilities: <access denied>\n    Kernel driver in use: bcma-pci-bridge\n    Kernel modules: bcma\n\nThe thing is, I have \"blacklist bcma\" in my /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf, so I don't know why it's still using it. That lspci output is exactly what was shown when I had my wireless working, but now that I've removed the b43-fwcutter package, it isn't functional. I found another question which does recommend b43-fwcutter, and that one is specifically for a Mac product with BCM4331, rather than BCM4313.\nSo is b43-fwcutter the best option, and I just have to live with these disconnects, or are there other things I can try?\n\nA: I had the same problem. It was so annoying.\nFinally, I resolved my issue by installing Ubuntu 13.04 (daily build, 20. March). Now, I am writing this answer on Ubuntu 13.04. The wireless issue is solved completely. Other hardware is working perfectly fine.\nBy the way, the wireless driver is installed by default and works out of the box. The driver is \"wl\" and not b43. \n", "Q: Trouble installing Ubuntu 12.10 alongside windows 7 I have a windows 7 laptop. I downloaded the Wubi.exe from ubuntu and whatnot, and ran it. After all that went well, I rebooted to finish the install.Then  I get a screen that says\n\" Try (hd0, 0): NTFS5: No wubildr\n  Try (hd0, 1): NTFS5:             \"\nNothing else... if I let it sit for five or ten minutes it just stays there. What do I do to fix this?\n\nA: There's a way to workaround this, but one might argue that the whole point of Wubi - to try out Ubuntu easily from Windows and easily uninstall - is lost when you have to employ workarounds to get it to boot.\nThe workaround is to copy the wubildr file to the first partition of your computer /dev/sda1. There are various ways to do this e.g. from an Ubuntu live CD/USB, or by assigning a drive letter to the partition in Windows (it's likely your boot partition with no mapping), and then copying it from C:\\ to the newly mapped drive.\nMy advice would be to try Ubuntu from a live USB and then if you like it, just do a normal dual boot. Unless it's really important not to modify partitions. \nPS if you want some background on wubildr and wubildr.mbr you can read this: wubildr, wubildr.mbr and grldr\n", "Q: FPM fails while trying to make a deb - No parameters given This is a 2-part question really.  The first part is to try and find out why FPM isn't working, the second is to find out if FPM is the answer in the first place...\nBackground: I've patched some files in an open-source package which I want to repackage with a different name so that it can be installed beside the existing one (in case someone using it already has the main version installed - I don't want to overwrite it).  I also want to use a deb so that I can manage dependencies and have people use apt-get to install it.\nI did some googling and found that FPM seems to be the weapon of choice to build a .deb, but I can't get it to work.  I installed version 0.4.29 and I'm running Ubuntu 12.04.\nHeres what I have in my code directory (its the output of sudo make install):\n~code\n   |_main_folder\n     |_ sub_1\n     |_ sub_2\n        |_sub 3\n\nAnd I'm trying to do this:\nsudo fpm -s dir -t deb -n \"my_package\" -v 1.0 -C ~/code/main_folder/\nBut I get this:\nNo parameters given. You need to pass additional command arguments\nso that I know what you want to build packages from. For example, \nfor '-s dir' you would pass a list of files and directories. \nFor '-s gem' you would pass a one or more gems to package from. \nAs a full example, this will make an rpm of the 'json' rubygem: \n`fpm -s gem -t rpm json` {:level=>:warn}\nFix the above problems, and you'll be rolling packages in no time! {:level=>:fatal}\n\nClearly I have provided several parameters, so the error message is somewhat useless to me.  I've tried a few different variations of this command, but nothing gives me a package.  I'm wondering if its something simple and obvious, but I'm not really sure what to try next.  Google shows me that this is a problem a lot of people seem to have with it, but I wasn't able to find any solutions... which makes me wonder if FPM is all its cracked up to be... \nSo if its not - is there another alternative to building .deb files?  Its not a task I've done before...\nCheers in advance\nPS: I wanted to add the tag 'fpm' to the question, but I don't have enough reputation.  It seems like a sensible tag, so if someone who does have the reputation wants to add it then it might help others in the future.\n\nA: The answer was very simple yet annoying.  Apparently the -C changes fpm into the directory but even though I specified that I was packaging a directory it still needs to know what files to package up.  I tried a *, which just resulted in an error... but a simple '.' on the end did the trick.\nThe working command (including a couple of dependencies as an example):\nfpm -s dir -t deb -n my-package -v 1.0 -C /tmp/installdir/ -d pkgreqd -d libneedthis .\n\n", "Q: How to change screen brightness based on screen colors?

After appending msr into my etc/modules and the wrmsr lines into my rc.local I found I was able to shut off Turbo Boost at boot.\nMy question is: Is this method I've used safely disabling Turbo Boost, or should I attempt to find a different workaround.\nI have an MSI-GE60 with no setting in the BIOS for Turbo Boost, so changing it like this appeared to be the only way.\nThanks to anyone who can help.\n\nA: You could set the max CPU frequencies to a setting just under the turbo boost - attached is the code I use in rc.local\necho 1 > /sys/module/processor/parameters/ignore_ppc\n\nfor x in /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu[0-3]/cpufreq/;do \n  echo 2501000 > $x/scaling_max_freq\ndone\n\nIn my system the speed of 250100 is a turbo speed, non-turbo being 2500000\nCharles Green\n\nA: You can also disable boost by setting /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/boost to 0.\n\nA: For example, to disable turbo over 69 degrees you can crontab every 1 minute:\necho $[`cat /sys/devices/platform/coretemp.0/hwmon/hwmon0/temp1_input`/69000] > /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/no_turbo\n\n\nA: You most probably have to do it through the BIOS - at least, that is how it was for me. Otherwise, you could install indicator-cpufreq (sudo apt-get install indicator-cpufreq) and set it to a setting that doesn't use Turbo, like conservative. You can even set it to a constant speed (mine is usually at 1.2), and change it when you find things getting slow. I would also recommend Hardware Sensors Indicator:\n sudo add-apt-repository ppa:alexmurray/indicator-sensors\n sudo apt-get update\n sudo apt-get install indicator-sensors\n\nTo monitor your temperature and make sure it's not going to high.\n", "Q: Can't flash Ubuntu to my Galaxy Nexus: \"device is unsupported\".

Ubuntu 12.04\nI want to remove all the images from a document in LibreOffice Writer. My document contains ~ 350 images. Is there a way to delete them en masse rather than one by one?

But the place-holders are still visible.\nEdit: I know about saving the page as a plain text file, But I need formatting in my document.\n\nA: I'm assuming that the text of the document is formatted and that saving as text-only isn't ideal. In that case, one could take a somewhat longish approach:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a temporary folder.\n\n*Open the document in LibreOffice normally.\n\n*Choose Save As and here select HTML Document (Writer) (.html) as the format. \n\n\n*\n\n*Also, specify the temporary folder for the destination and give the proposed html file a suitable name. Agree to Save as html and not odt format in the next screen. \n\n\n*Close LibreOffice.\n\n*Open the temporary folder created above. You should see one html file and a bunch of images.   \n\n\n*\n\n*Delete the images if they're not needed further.\n\n\n*Then, open the .html file in an appropriate text editor to strip out the  tags that would otherwise, if left in, cause gaps in the document.  \n\n\n*\n\n*For example, in Geany, I used <IMG SRC=\"[^>]+> as the search expression and nothing in the \"replace with\" box.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Save the .html file. Now, when viewed in a browser or even in LibreOffice, there will be no images, no placeholders, just formatted text.  \n\n\nEdit: Instead of using a GUI-based text editor, assuming one is in the relevant folder and that cli.html is the name given while saving to html in LibreOffice, one could just use the command line this way:\nperl -p -i.bak -e 's/<IMG[^>]+>//g' cli.html\n\nA backup file, cli.html.bak, is created just in case ...\n\nA: You can select one image in document via mouse, then press Ctrl + A for select all images in current Sheet, and Del for delete them.\n\nA: You can also use a short macro from within LibreOffice to remove all images in a document:\nSub RemoveImages\n\n   Dim oDoc as Object\n   oDoc = ThisComponent\n\n   Dim oGraphics as Object\n   oGraphics = oDoc.getGraphicObjects()\n\n   Dim oImg as Object\n\n   For Each oImg in oGraphics\n       oDoc.getText().removeTextContent(oImg)\n   Next \n\nEnd Sub\n\nThis example could also be modified to change the properties of images (such as making them all a uniform size) as well as handling shape objects, etc.\nCreating Macros\nLibreOffice provides a Basic language as well as in IDE to create, debug, store, and run code.\nTo open the macro dialog, use Alt + F11 or, from the menu, Tools > Macros > Organize Macros > LibreOffice Basic\nCode is placed in modules, which are organized into libraries. You can create your own, but for most purposes you can use the built-in MyMacros library and the built-in Module1. \nOnce the macro dialog is open, highlight Module1 and press Edit. This opens the IDE.\nCode is organized into Subs and Functions. Borrowing from VBA, Functions are used to return a value and Subs do not return a value. You can define your own subs and functions anywhere below Main. So to use this code to remove images, you just paste it in the module.\nUsing Macros\nYou can run the code right from the IDE by clicking anywhere inside the Sub you want to run and press F5. (Functions, since they return a value, need to be called from a Sub.) You can also use the dialog buttons or menu to run the code. The IDE includes an integrated debugger, which is crucial when writing new code.\nThe next time you open the macro dialog, you will see the sub listed as a macro and it can then be run without opening the IDE. Individual macros can also be assigned to menu or toolbar items.\nNote: This macro will run on whatever is the active document. When running a macro from the menu or macro dialog, this can be assumed to be the document where you just pressed the button; but when using the IDE to create, run, or debug code, make sure you haven't made another document the active document.\nLibreOffice Basic\nLibreOffice Basic is very similar to VBA, but that similarity can also be deceiving since the object model is completely different and the syntax also has many differences. \nFor example, in VBA, once you have a reference to an image object, the image object would have a delete method. Here, objects have or inherit very few methods. To delete the image object, you use the document element with a structure and syntax very similar to a browser-based DOM.\nLibreOffice Help has links for getting started with LibreOffice Basic. \n", "Q: Will Ubuntu Phone and Tablet have Bash?

(Logout and in after upgrade.)\n \nEven if the monitor is still closed,  press Tab (three times in my case), and then Enter, but pressing one or two times and Enter would still activate internal display. \nEven easier: instead of Tab, use right-arrow multiple times and then Enter: the internal display is the last button to the right and it stays selected in this way.\nBut in fact this might have worked even before the upgrade with just the advanced window (xfce4-display-settings; before upgrade, adding -m displays the same window as far as I can tell) by pressing down-arrow key, then Tab (once) and Enter.\n\nBut the upgraded version is more interesting, more easy to use and has enhanced features (extended display).\n\nAfter vasa1's answer to a different question, a solution emerged that in the end may be preferable, as it involves single, separate, clear shortcuts for each display configuration.\nBut this involves LXRandr, the LXDE default display manager, which can be installed from repos and used perfectly under the Xfce desktop. It is a GUI for xrandr and saves its configurations.\n\n\n*\n\n*Save the desired configuration (the internal display in this case)\n`\n\n\n*Use gedit or other text editor to open the saved file:\n\ngedit ~/.config/autostart/lxrandr-autostart.desktop\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the executive command (it would be something like xrandr --output LVDS --mode 1680x1050 --rate 60.1 --output VGA-0 --off)\n\n*In Xfce, under Menu, Settings/Keyboard/Application shortcut, add this command and the shortcut.\nThis procedure can be repeated for the other two options (external monitor only, or mirror image - but there's no dual display in lxrandr).\n\nA: I am using a Notebook with two external screens unter xfce wit xrandr.

Subsequently running the Steam script actually downloads the application, which subsequently manages its own updates.\nWhile as far as I know Steam doesn't offer you a choice of location at install time (it will go into $HOME/.local/share/Steam), you can subsequently move the install location or create additional libraries - see the answer above.\n", "Q: shell script, read is not waiting with ssh Hi all I am new to shell scripting and please help me in this situation.\nI have created a shell script named ./remote1 which looks like below.\n\n# ./remote1 file\n  ssh username@x.x.x.x  'bash -s' < ./createdir\n\nHere 'createdir' is another file i had created which is given below\n\n# ./createdir file\n  echo \"give directory name\"\n  read name\n  mkdir ~/$name\n\nIf I run the ./createdir alone in my machine, it will execute without any problem.\n\nIf I execute ./remote1, it will not wait for input the data for the 'read' command.Please anyone could help me to solve this problem. \nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Looks like you want to exec the command via ssh on another machine.

It went fast and flawlessly, even did the samba install and all updates. \nI hope this helps out some people, I was going crazy for about 3 hours!\n\nA: if you are installing ubuntu server in a vm, on ubuntu splash screen after you have selected your language, press F4 to open mode menu and select install a minimal virtual machine. proceed on to installing the os, then it won't hang on configuring apt.\n\nA: The OP reported in a comment on another answer that switching from the 64-bit version of Ubuntu Server to the 64-bit version solved the problem:\n\nI gave up, I ended up installing the 32bit version and that seemed to work.\n\n–  7wp Feb 26 '13 at 5:44\nSince 64-bit software usually takes up a bit more disk space than 32-bit software, it occurs to me that it makes sense that either this or Nobody's answer might solve the problem.\nThe post where this was posted may be deleted, as it was posted as an answer but doesn't really answer the question.\n", "Q: How to get past \"sending 'system' (92311 KB)...\" when installing ubuntu on Nexus 7 I'm in the process of installing the Ubuntu image onto my Nexus 7 following these directions.\nI am on the step 4 and typed in phablet-flash -b and it downloaded some files, erased 'system' and is now on\nsending 'system' (92311 KB)...\n\nHowever, it has been on this step for about 3 hours now.  I am assuming it shouldn't take this long so how can I go about getting out of this and restarting the flash without bricking my device?\n\nA: If the system is stuck, you can safely start over albeit you will have to do it manually.\nI'm going to say with a high degree of confidence that the devices that provide a fastboot interface and more so all the Nexus devices are mostly unbrickable unless you flash the bootloader, notice that I say bootloader and not the boot image.\nSo to start from scratch, reboot the device into fastboot once more. You can do so by pressing power and holding the Volume up and down keys all at the same time.\nLocate your image files, I will shortly refer to them as system.img, boot.img and recovery.img from which I am omitting the device specific tag (grouper in the case of the Nexus 7 for a more generic answer).\nOnce you locate them just run:\nfastboot flash system system.img\nfastboot flash boot boot.img\n\nOptionally flash the recovery.img which phablet-flash -b does for you anyways:\nfastboot flash recovery recovery.img\n\nThen boot into recovery\nfastboot boot recovery.img\n\nOnce in recovery, locate the Ubuntu side of the install, the file should be named saucy-preinstalled-phablet-armhf.zip (given that you are working on an unflipped model, the flipped/unflipped will make more sense in the following days from the date of this post). Push this so it is deployed by recovery:\nadb push saucy-preinstalled-phablet-armhf.zip /sdcard/autodeploy.zip\nadb reboot recovery\n\nIt should be mostly done after this.\n", "Q: terminal vim colours broken on focuslost My vim setup uses the csexact plugin to fix match the colors for color schemes that would normally only work in gvim. Everything works fine until gnome-terminal loses focus, and suddenly everything breaks!\nHere is an image of issue in action:\n\nI have the exact same vim setup on my laptop (ubuntu 12.04 32bit, gnome-terminal 3.4.1.1, vim compiled from source). However, on my PC (ubuntu 12.10 64bit, gnome-terminal 3.6.0, vim compiled from source), this issue occurs. I hesitate to blame the csexact plugin, since vim in gnome-terminal cannot receive focuslost or focusgained events, this must be a terminal issue then; however I do notice that when the colors break if I run :CSExactColors  everything fixes again.\nWhat can I do?

I think this package is to choose between qt3 and qt4 or qt5. If it's possible (have you got qt3? qt5?), try to disinstall qtchooser.\n\nA: I had the same problem on my computer after the installation of Ubuntu SDK. I foudn the solution here.\nYour have to follow step with the PPA, I put the solution here but I advise you to follow the tutorial.\nHow do I resolve unmet dependencies after adding a PPA?\nDisable/Remove/Purge PPAs:\nPPAs (Personal Package Archive) are repositories hosted on Launchpad. You can use PPAs to install or upgrade packages that are not available in the official Ubuntu repositories.\nOne of the most common causes of unmet dependencies are PPAs, specially when used to upgrade the existing package in Ubuntu repositories. To solve the problem you have tree options, disable, purge (revert back to original package in Ubuntu repositories) or remove PPA.\nDisable:\n\nDisabling a PPA means no more updates for the packages installed from that PPA. To disable a PPA: Open Software Center > Edit > Software Sources Or,\n\nHit Alt+F2 and run software-properties-gtk.\n\nClick on Other Software tab, you'll see that each PPA have two lines here, one for the compiled packages and one for the source, Uncheck both lines to disable a PPA. Hare you can also add and remove PPAs.\nPurge:\n\nPurging a PPA means, downgrading the packages in the selected PPA to the version in the official Ubuntu repositories and disabling that PPA. PPA Purge does exactly that. To install PPA Purge run the following command:\n\nsudo apt-get install ppa-purge\n\nBut, Considering the question apt is broken so the above command will fail. So use this command\nmkdir ppa-purge && cd ppa-purge && wget http://mirror.pnl.gov/ubuntu/pool/universe/p/ppa-purge/ppa-purge_0.2.8+bzr56_all.deb && wget http://mirror.pnl.gov/ubuntu//pool/main/a/aptitude/aptitude_0.6.6-1ubuntu1_i386.deb && sudo dpkg -i ./*.deb\nTo use PPA Purge:\nsudo ppa-purge ppa:someppa/ppa\nIf 'ppa-purge' command fails for some reason, you can't run 'ppa-purge' again unless you re-enable the PPA (To enable the PPA follow the same steps as disabling a PPA and Check the both lines of a particular PPA to enable it).\nNote: PPA Purge doesn't remove PPAs (may be in future), So you'll have to manually remove the PPA.\nIt's worked for me.\n", "Q: Major issues trying to clean up /boot 12.04 LTS here, first off let me start with a uname -a output for you\n\n3.2.0-35-generic-pae #55-Ubuntu SMP Wed Dec 5 18:04:39 UTC 2012 i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux\n\nSo my boot partition was at 100%.

When I used Windows, I was able to use the Sony Digital voice editor, and I never needed to leave my word processor to stop the audio. That's the kind of functionality I'm looking for. I don't want a speech-to-text program, which would be useless for the multilingual interviews I'm transcribing. \nAudacity seems to not have macros that I can use to just pause and rewind without clicking on the window itself. \nTranscriber, a software recommended in other threads, seems to be wholly non-functional and hasn't been updated in a long time. After it is installed it is unusable. \nAny other recommendations?\n\nA: VLC seems to work well. After installing VLC go to \"Tools\", then select \"Preferences\", then \"Hotkeys\" and from there you can change/edit the \"Global\" commands. So after you configured it you can type from Libreoffice Writer (or any word processor) while listening (play, pause, short step backwards) to your audio file without clicking on the VLC Window.\nHope this helps :-)\n\nA: I realise that this question is 6 years old but it's still getting views.\nI authored 4 Linux Transcriber packages.\nAll have the ability to be controlled using a foot-pedal.\nAll have the usual control facilities, jump back/forward, pause, slower,faster etc.\nAll offer styled timestamps.\nAll use LibreOffice (LO) as the word processor, with LO macro buttons and hotkeys to control the transcription software.       \nFootswitch2 and Footswitch2basic are Vlc based for audio/video, with Footswitch2 offering multiple clients options/rates etc    \nFootswitch3 and Footswitch3basic are Gstreamer based for audio/video.\nThey are all written in python3 on Linux Mint 19.1 (Ubuntu 18.04)\nThey are all free and can be downloaded from sourceforge.net\nYou can access them through the following link.\nhttps://sourceforge.net/u/rolfofsaxony/profile\nor simply search for them by name with your favourite web search engine\nHappy transcribing!\n\nA: As Andy mentions, VLC is a good option, but if you want something more tailored towards the needs of transcribers, check out Transcribe. It has both dictation and audio control built into its text editor. Works only on Chrome, but can work completely offline (after you load it once, no Internet required):\nhttps://transcribe.wreally.com/\n\nA: Try Transcribear. It's free web based editor that includes media player and you don't need keep switching between your desktop player and your text editor when transcribing recordings. \n\nA: If you want to try an automatic online tool, you could check out Maestra. You'd also be able to manually edit the text after it is automatically transcribed.\n", "Q: How can I get the correct Spanish Keyboard layout? I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 and I can't seem to get the right Spanish keyboard layout. I'm used to using the Windows Spanish (International) layout with dead keys on the US apostrophe and open bracket, as well as a ç where the US layout has a \\. The dead keys I'm used to are an acute accent (´) where ' is, a diæresis/\"umlaut\" (¨) where the \" is, a grave accent (`) where the [ is, and a circumflex (^) where the { is. I am also used to having ° where the ` is.\nThe keyboard layout that I have also does not allow me to type @, #, or any of the other characters that I am used to typing by pressing Ctrl + Alt + (key). The previews of keyboard layouts included with Ubuntu are unhelpful and confusing to me. Can anyone help me find or construct the keyboard layout I'm looking for?\n\nA: Press the Super key and start typing \"keyboard\" (for you, it would be \"teclado\") and open \"Keyboard layout\" (\"Distribución del teclado\"). Alternatively, you open \"System configuration\" (\"Configuración del sistema\") and select \"Keyboard layout\".\n\nThere you can add another keyboard layout, by clicking on the button with a \"+\" symbol at the bottom left, check the layout itself by clicking on the little keyboard button, and even change some of the options for your preferred layout (button \"Options...\" at the bottom right). The latter would let you customize the layout.\n\nAs for typing characters in a manner similar to Ctrl+Alt+number, check this question: How can I type ASCII characters like Alt + numpad in Windows?\nIf you only want to know what key combinations are available in you current keyboard layout, click on the little keyboard button (highlighted in pink in the image, below) after you selected the layout.\n\nThe combinations of keys are as follow:\n\n", "Q: Can I setup an smtp server with Ubuntu Desktop?

Is it possible to make Firefox or any other browser user agent appear like it would be Windows?  \nBecause my online-banking refuses access due to my operating system. The only accepted OS is Windows.\n\nA: I'd imagine that they're just querying the user agent, which you can easily customize with an add-on like the User Agent Switcher.\nOnce you've installed that, Google can provide you with any number of Windows/Firefox user agent strings, and you can use the add-on to send the user agent of your choice when connecting to your banking site.  \nAs an example, here's my user agent from Firefox on Windows 7. \n\nMozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:18.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/18.0\n\n\nA: It's an old question, but still relevant in 2022. The introduction of client hints, which firefox has not (yet?) implemented, makes it slightly more complicated than just changing the user agent string.\nOn Firefox\nYou can try pasting the user-agent string (see below for an example) into a string variable you create yourself in about:config called general.useragent.override.

When I click on it to open the file it tells me to go to the chromestore to find an app that can open this type of file because the file is not supported. I just got my chromebook today so I dont think its a computer issue. I don't understand why it's not letting me open the file. I downloaded it directly off of the ubuntu website and downloaded what ubuntu had recommended me to download.\n\nA: You can't install the Ubuntu image from the Canonical website on any Chromebook. Chromebooks have a different booting mechanism than most laptops, so you need a special install process to install Ubuntu on some of these laptops.\nYou can follow these instructions that are specific to the C7 Chromebook you mention: http://liliputing.com/2012/11/how-to-install-ubuntu-12-04-on-the-199-acer-c7-chromebook.html\nNote that this is Ubuntu 12.04, but I believe that is the latest supported release (as I post this anyway.)\n\nA: Hopefully this will help you find the answer to your question as well.\nhttp://www.andrewq.netau.net/tutorials/how-to-set-up-ubuntu-on-chromebook/\n", "Q: Can Ubuntu repair windows 7 that won't boot? So my old computers motherboard died and right in the middle of a windows boot. As you imagine, after buying a new and suitable rig windows 7 will not boot. windows gets to the \"windows starting up\" animation and restarts. When the computer restarts it goes to the startup repair which says it cannot be repaired. However, with ubuntu installed, all HDD files are accounted for and all components work well. Is there a way for ubuntu to repair the booting process without compromising any files on the HDD? Thanks! \n\nA: I imagine that since the motherboard died there is some conflict with the Windows installation process which may have left residual files on the hard disk drive which can't be removed with no OS installed. \nAccessing Ubuntu on the system doesn't go over the Windows install it uses the hardware to run the OS. You could possible format the Windows partitions on the drives and try to reinstall Windows after you have done that. \n\nA: i think a recovery image would do the work, all you need is to download it and burn it on a CD and launch the system reparation procedure \n\nA: The correct answer is No. Ubuntu is not designed either to fix Windows errors nor to clear it's trash. The reason why does Ubuntu work is that Linux surpasses Windows in this way: it doesn't bind to chipset model.\nThere are ways to fix the error, but Ask Ubuntu is not the correct site to ask about them. SuperUser is.\n", "Q: Can't turn on WIFI on Lenovo z580 using Fn+F5 I can't turn my wireless adapter on using the network settings it says wireless is disabled by wireless switch.

Is Ubuntu Touch for phones and tablets meant to be \"dockable\" with an external keyboard/mouse/monitor? If so, how will the touch gestures for navigation be handled when using a mouse or trackpad? Will applications need to be able to handle migrating across different screen resolutions while running, etc?\n\nA: The Touch Developer Preview published on 21 February gives a very good and deep impression of the current status of the project. The first focus was clearly put on the set up of kernel and basic services like networking, video, sound and other hardware support. Also important focus was put on the new user interface and the new application handling for qml-based apps.\nWhat you are adressing, the docking feature that allows to establish a PC-like desktop behaviour from the mobile device was clearly anounced by Mark Shuttleworth but not much of that has been yet put into available code. \nSo up till now it's more a design goal, an idea supported by the fact that:\n\n\n*\n\n*ubuntu is already a usable desktop OS,\n\n*ubuntu is able to be targeted to mobile cpus like arm\n\n*modern mobile cpus are powerful enough to take over the job for desktop OS.\n\n\nAnd this finally makes the first step into the marketing statements before it is actually brought to life by the coding guys. \nAll this shows that your questions cannot be answered clearly at this point of time. In the Developer Preview we can see new applications in a new user interface. These new applications can also run on a desktop version. Also it is clearly possible to have a conventional Ubuntu running on a mobile device. This project https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Nexus7 shows its feasibility.\n", "Q: Will \"legacy\" Linux/X11 apps run on Ubuntu Touch? I've been doing a little testing of the Ubuntu Touch preview on my Nexus 10 tablet. It's very pretty, but I'm curious what support is planned for \"legacy\" Linux/X11 apps that aren't based on Qt/QML?\nWill traditional desktop applications like LibreOffice and Gimp be runnable on the tablet view? Or will they run in a dedicated X11 desktop app? Or only when docked? Or will they be supported at all?\n\nA: Ubuntu Touch, and desktop Unity starting in 14.04, will run on top of the new Mir display server.  Part of the Mir offering will be XMir, an X server running as a Mir client.  This will allow legacy/X11 apps to run on top of Mir without any effort.\nHowever, even if this does allow them to run on Ubuntu Touch, most legacy/X11 applications are not designed for touch-input and small screens, so most of them would not be very usable on phones and tablets.\n\nA: The thin client will use mir as the display server. From what I've read porting apps from x11 to mir will be fairly painless so don't worry about your desktop apps not working.\n\nA: According to \"Ubuntu Touch: Next Generation OS or Just Another Skin?\" (XDA Developers), neither X11 nor Wayland are supported at this time.\n\nA: I purchased the Ubuntu Phone (bq Aqaris E4.5) and if you download a terminal app for the ubuntu Phone and type in service --list-all a service named x11-common is listed as well.\nBut typing in Xorg just returns that the command was not found.\nIf you search for \"ubuntu touch x11-common\" you'll find this:\n\nX Window System (X.Org) infrastructure\nx11-common contains the filesystem infrastructure required for further installation of the X Window System in any configuration; it does not provide a full installation of clients, servers, libraries, and utilities required to run the X Window System.\nA number of terms are used to refer to the X Window System, including \"X\", \"X Version 11\", \"X11\", \"X11R6\", and \"X11R7\". The version of X used in Debian is derived from the version released by the X.Org Foundation, and is thus often also referred to as \"X.Org\". All of the preceding quoted terms are functionally interchangeable in an Debian system.\n\nThis means that you will NOT be able to run windows from your 'normal' OS.\n\n\n\"The phone becomes a full PC and thin client when docked.\"\n\nThis is only true for the Ubuntu Edge, which did not succeed to be funded. It might be realised in the future though. At the current state (early 2015), the bq Aqaris E4.5 does not even support OTG HDMI, while basic OTG USB Keyboard and Mouse support already works.\n\nA: I have recently bought the Aquaris M10 Ubuntu tablet. It has a few X11 programs built-in (Firefox, Libre Office, gedit), but the filesystem is read only. I have managed to install GNU Octave, but the X11 GUI is not working. Touch isn't suitable for users to install X11 software yet (May 2016)\n", "Q: What size cd to burn Ubuntu 12.04 Need recommendation on what cd to use to burn Ubuntu 12.04. I have 80 minute, 700MB discs, but I would get another size if it would make process easier. Thanks.\n\nA: The iso images are too large for a standard 700 mb CD.

I would personally use a 2 gb flash drive.\nSee: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick\n", "Q: How safe is it to shrink the root (EXT4) partition? Note:\nI'm not asking how. I've found nice tutorials on how to do this and will try it myself and I'll dig some more or ask questions about it after my first attempt.\nBackground:\nI installed Ubuntu 12.04 LTS on my machine to dual boot with Windows 8. It's a ThinkPad machine so the disk is pre-partitioned for recovery and other stuff. I decided to do assign the mount points to the different partitions myself.\nStupidly, a friend of mine suggested to use one partition to mount / and /boot (swap is on a different partition of course!!).\nSo after doing some reading, it's clearly safer to have the two mount points on two separate partitions. I've decided to separate them and put /booton a different partition.\nThe thing is, I don't think I have unallocated space nor a free partition on my disk right now.\nFinally:\nSo my question is: How safe is it to shrink the root partition to have some unallocated space on my disk, and use that space as a dedicated partition for /boot?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: It's extremely safe - as long as you've backed up so you can restore your important data if anything should be lost.  Moving partitions around always has some risk, but as long as you have a good backup you won't likely lose anything but time. With that warning in mind:\nIt is usually quite safe.  I've resized and/or moved ext4 partitions many times (I use gparted) and have never had the slightest problem; it's always worked just as it should.  And you appear to have good intructions on how to do it all, so I'd recommend you give it a go.\nIf you plan to do anything with Windows partitions, however, I'd recommend that Windows partitions be moved or resized from within Windows using Windows tools.  Windows doesn't always play nicely with others; the only time I've ever had problems with moving/resizing partitions has been with Windows.\n\nA: Safe is always a matter of opinion. It works most of the time, failure and data loss are rare, but can happen.\nA better strategy is to consider this - it is not a matter of if the hardware will fail, but when.\nBest to back up your data first, then if there is a problem, you can always restore from backup.

For sites with a caching layer and with most visitors are not logged-in, it is not normal.\nIn most cases, it is not Nginx, but php-fpm and MySQL that use more memory than Nginx. Of course, Nginx is more efficient than Apache. While top is useful, you may use this scirpt to find which process uses how much memory. Please know that *ps_mem.py* requires 'root' or 'sudo' privilege.\nIf you'd like to reduce the memory usage, you may use a caching layer, such as Varnish. Alternatively, you may use application level caching, such as WP Super Cache or Batcache (both work fine with APC as WP Object Cache).

It's just deployed to my user accound via the magic of the web interface.\n\nA: A node is allocated to a user when a service is deployed to the node with juju. To return the node back to 'Ready' state you need to remove the service from the node with juju and terminate the machine.\nTo remove the service from a machine check 'juju status' to determine machine-id corresponding to your machine. Then under services see which service is deployed to the particular machine-id.\nTo remove the service use either 'juju remove-unit service/X' if removing a single unit or 'juju destroy-service service' if you want to remove all remaining units.\njuju remove-unit ubuntu/3\n\nThe machine can then be terminated with 'juju terminate-machine machine-id'\njuju terminate-machine 23\n\nOnce the node is in the 'Ready' state it can be deleted from MAAS.\n", "Q: VirtualBox machine will not boot up after MaaS commisioning Question: Has anyone ever had a problem with a VirtualBox machine not booting up after it's been commissioned and allocated to Admin on MaaS?\n\nDescription: I was able to commision a VirtualBox machine on my MaaS\n  and the Ubuntu-12.04-precise image get installed but when I boot up\n  the virtual machine, I get an boot error.

Will my Ubuntu install be lost in the win8 upgrade?\nThanks!\n\nA: It shouldn't be lost, provided you don't format over your drive. It will probably also honour the entries in the Windows Boot Manager (BCD store) But that's something you need to check with Windows 8 upgrade documentation - if it doesn't you could always add it back manually.\nHowever, if you care about your Ubuntu install, then it's advisable to back it up. You should do this anyway, because Wubi installs can get corrupted more easily than a normal install. What you should do is backup the entire \\ubuntu\\disks directory. This contains the main file, root.disk, the virtual disk and swap.disk and then some empty subdirectories (unimportant). In some installs there may be other virtual disks e.g. home.disk, usr.disk, but normally there're just the two.\nIf you back these up it's easy to restore the install even if the upgrade fails.\nWindows 8 works fine with Wubi - provided you don't enable hybrid sleep (not enabled by default). Fast start (which is enabled) is okay with Wubi.\nBacking up a Wubi install\nYou can just copy the \\ubuntu\\disk directory or the separate .disk files to an external drive. Wubi installs Ubuntu onto virtual disks that are mounted as loop devices, but are just physical files on the host NTFS or FAT32 (Windows) \"drives\". So backing them up is as simple as copying the files to an external drive.\nThis isn't the most efficient way to back up a Wubi install since you're also copying the  free space on the virtual disk, plus all the general OS files, packages, cache that you wouldn't normally backup. But the simplicity makes up for that.\nIf you need to restore from the backup you can just replace the .disk files from your backup. This is also convenient when attempting upgrades or if you want to just play around with some things and are worried you won't be able to undo it later.\nYou can even reinstall the same release of Wubi and then replace the new .disk files with the backups, but they either have to be on the same partition, or else you need to do a bit of manual grub booting the first time. See this for details: moved ubuntu folder from C: to D: drive how to correct UUID entries\nData backups\nIt's also a good idea to maintain separate data backups which can be done as for a normal install, just focusing on personal data and settings. I prefer to use Ubuntu One to keep all data fully sychronized, and with data that doesn't have to be on the virtual disks, e.g. jpegs and mp3s etc., I store these on the /host partition or another mounted partition. This is the safest way to use Wubi, as there seem to be many cases of filesystem corruption that can lead to a full loss of the install.\n", "Q: When I try to install ubuntu my computer freezes then shuts down It's a really old computer that I had lying around and windows got corrupted so I tried installing Ubuntu but it freezes and shuts down after 10 minutes.

I'm new to ubuntu, and recently ubuntu said that only about 800 mb was left on the hard drive.

Just follow the instructions of the answer of this question: \nCan i install/run Ubuntu 12.10 on my laptop (ACER 5755G)?\nNow, your problem is that when you installed Ubuntu with Wubi, you probably got the option to say how much space did you want for Ubuntu, now, 30 gbs is good for it if you're new... (you probably will not need a lot)... If you're running out of space, you can always use an external HDD, or partition your HDD so Ubuntu can use it...

I checked Eduroam info of your university and it has info on Linux but it wants you to go through XpressConnect. It was like that at my old uni, too, but only for Windows and Mac (I believe) You can try this guide (steps 4 and 5 in particular) which lists out the steps for Linux. I think Eduroam is supposed to be worldwide so I would assume settings are the same everywhere.\nEDIT: My current university's guide doesn't have the same steps as the other so perhaps they are not universal settings. Still worth a try though I think.\nIf all else fails, you could disable and re-enable networking or wireless instead of rebooting your computer. It's not going to fix anything but it's somewhat faster (if it even works).\n\nA: Have you tried removing the saved connection?\nClick the network icon in the top right, click \"edit connections\", go to the wireless tab, click your connection in the list on the left and click delete.\nThen disable/enable networking.  That should clear any saved authentication info and allow you to put in a new username.\nI'd compare the security settings with those on a machine that connects normally as well.\n\nA: I have the same problem. I'm on my local network at home. Sometimes the connection is just lost and then it asks for the password.

If so, how does it work?\n\nA: That's a great question!\nSadly, the actual console TTY in Linux is not an actual Xterm, which is able to capture and support far more key presses.\nI have long suspected that the Linux TTY could be taught to support the Shift-F-keys, though I've never gotten around to trying.  Sorry.\n\nA: A bit of background:\nHistorically, there have been lots of \"terminal types\" (a \"terminal\" is a keyboard & text display - xterm is a terminal type, so is the console), all of which had different keys. If you look at your keyboard now, it probably has a \"Windows key\", left of the spacebar. Macs don't have these, they might have an \"Apple key\" (google, if you want to see this). Some keyboards had a \"Del\" key where the backspace is on most modern keyboards. On some terminal types (e.g. teleprinters - essentially it used a printer as a screen), you could not \"delete\" a character. Did it have function keys? how many? Which character would make the cursor move back one character? Did the \"carriage return\" character move to the beginning of the current line, or the next line? How characters wide was the screen? Can you \"display\" do text colours? How do you change colours?\nTo make Unix/Linux as usable as possible, on as many terminals as possible, there are files which described what each terminal was capable of, and what keys should perform which functions (e.g. when you hit the \"Del\" key, it might work as \"Del\", or it might work as \"Backspace\"). These files (in Linux) can be found in /usr/sare/terminfo. Which of these is actually used is decided by the environment variable \"TERM\". if you \"echo $TERM\", you can see what it thinks you have.\nIf the terminal definition doesn't say you have particular keys, then there is no way for programs to receive those keys.\nxterm, gnome-terminal use the 'xterm' terminal type, which supports things like function keys; the console uses (by default) the \"linux\" terminal type, which doesn't think it has these keys. Since the terminal type describes how to say the key has been pressed (and tells the receiving program how to listen for it, then byobu can't receive them, and so cannot act on them.\nSo that is \"why\". Now the solution. There are 3, as far as I can see (in \"most convenient to least convenient order\"):\n\n\n*\n\n*Set a different terminal type, compatible with the actual terminal, but with more capabilities. NOTE: this has to be done BEFORE running byobu, not inside it. My install has over 1,600 terminal types, and if you set it to the wrong one, you may not be able to type, press enter, or the like. And setting it to something else doesn't necessarily give you that functionality - For example, if you are on the console, and you set the terminal type to \"xterm\", that doesn't give you the ability to resize your console with your mouse, nor will setting it to \"dec\" give you a \"setup\" key. However, most terminal types are mostly the same - 'a' will still be 'a'. You might see garbage characters, but usually not. I found that \"TERM=linux-vt\" seems to work pretty well. All of the keys I tried worked ok, except Alt-Function keys, and Alt-direction keys. Note that the Alt-Function keys and Alt-direction keys are handled by the console directly, to switch between virtual terminals.\n\n*Use alternative key combinations. All (as far as I'm aware) keybindings that are not accessible from the console, have alternative keybindings. For example, on the default install, Control-A followed by % will will do a horizontal split, and Control-A followed by a vertical pipe (\"|\") will do a vertical split. Control-A followed by a question mark will show the keybindings. I think it takes a while to understand what you're reading, but the main thing is the \"-T \" (root means it's always available, prefix means you have to hit Control-A first. If you \"bind-key -T root a\" to something, you won't be able to type 'a' anymore!). The next column (immediately after the key-table), is the key. The last column is what it runs. So if it says \"bind-key    -T prefix %                split-window -h\" then if you press the \"prefix\" (control-A) followed by '%', it will split the window (horizontally).\n\n*You can run these things from the commandline (often this only makes sense inside byobu), if you know what byobu calls it (and what options). Conveniently, this is the last column of the keybindings page. Just put 'byobu ' in front of it to do that from the commandline. For example, the keybindings page shows \"bind-key    -T prefix %                split-window -h\", so I can do the same by running the following command (from bash or the like) directly from inside byobu: \"byobu split-window -h\".\n", "Q: Will the Ubuntu tablet OS be flash-able from zip files?

For \"normal\" releases which are made every 6 months the upgrade procedure works only from release N to N+1 (e.q. from 10.04 to 10.10, from 10.10 to 11.04 and so on).\nThe Long Term Support (LTS) releases are made every 2 years and you also can upgrade one LTS release to the next LTS release. 10.04 was an LTS release, so you can directly upgrade it to 12.04, which is also an LTS.\nThen you can either stay on 12.04 and upgrade it to 14.04 when it is released (in April 2014, supposedly), or to upgrade 12.04 to 12.10 now, but in this case you'll have to upgrade your machines every 6 month to stay on top.\n", "Q: which comes first, system proxy or VPN?

So I'd accept that all of the tablet features will be working in due course.\nSo while there is no actual 'image' the relevant packages seem to have been packaged and ready for a machine running normal Ubuntu.\n\nEDIT/Clarification: I don't think that this a duplicate of the other question. I'm not asking whether I can run it on my laptop specifically, or what specific hardware will work. I'm asking about its compatibility with the Desktop environment and whether the two could be run side by side on some type of hybrid machine. Switching between the two depending on the mode of the hybrid.\nSo I understand now that QML is the main language used on the touch interfaces. So there is no correspondence between running a QML application in the desktop environment, in a similar way to how you could run a KDE/QT app in a gnome environment?\n\nOriginal: \nPlease could someone explain a bit more for me on the tablet interface. I've Googled around but haven't had much luck.\nMy initial understanding was that the tablet interface would be like a new interpretation of unity, but running on the same basic system (with power and driver tweaks etc). With this understanding, would it be likely to find some way to install this tablet interface over the standard desktop interface? \nIn my case, I have a Dell XPS12 Hybrid - laptop with a screen that rotates and turns into a tablet. The multitouch basics work. So I'm less interested in the ideas of drivers, but more about the touch interface itself. I find the desktop interface perfect when I'm in laptop mode, but very difficult in tablet mode. Is there likely to be a system that allows me to switch between the two on my laptop?\nSpecific answers about the XPS12 are welcome, but generally I'd like to know if I'm fundamentally off the track on the idea of running the desktop and the tablet interfaces side by side on x86.\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: QtQuick and QML are multi-platform, so you can run ubuntu touch interface even on Mac or Windows. But it's need some coding and porting.\n", "Q: How can I hide mounted volumes when I still want USB volumes to appear on the desktop? \n*\n\n*Xubuntu 12.10\n\n*XFCE 4.10 with Thunar 1.6.2\nI have two greyed out mounted (or \"mountable\") volumes on my desktop:  \n\nIf I right-click on them, I can mount them, implying they appear not be mounted yet.

I have found the right C++ compiler (arm-linux-gnueabihf-g++), but how can I get Qt5 working?\n\nA: There is another suggestion (third way, but hard):\n1. get linaro toolchain for armhf\n2. get libhybris and platform-api (from phablet-team at launchpad.net)\n3. get dynamic libs from device (/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf and /usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/)\n4. patch mkspecs for qmake\n5. compile\n6. add <your_app>.desktop file to /usr/share/applications/\n7. add lines to /usr/share/qml-phone-shell/Applications/applications.js (may be optional, I think)\n8. push your app and resources\n9. reboot shell or phone\n10. Your got worked app! (I tested this!)\n\nA: The easy way\nYou can use an experimental feature of the Ubuntu SDK Alpha. The beauty of it is that you don't need to cross-compile.\nFirst connect to your device:\n\n*\n\n*Plug in your device to your computer's USB port\n\n*Start Qt Creator\n\n*Click on the devices tab\n\n*Click the Enable button to enable developer mode\n\n*Go to Tools > Ubuntu > Device > Enable > Cpp compiling on Ubuntu device (experimental)\n\nThen start hacking:\n\n*\n\n*Open your app's project in Qt Creator\n\n*Go to Build > Ubuntu > Build C++ project on Ubuntu device (experimental)\n\n\nAnd off you go! :-)\nIf you like a challenge\nYou could conceivably compile the apps on the device by hand. You might want to try the following (untested) steps:\n\n*\n\n*SSH into your device running the Ubuntu Touch Developer Preview\n\n\n*Install the required development packages. Depending on what you need, you might need to add packages to the list, but here's a first shot:\nsudo apt-get install qt5-default qtbase5-dev libqt5v8-5-dev qtdeclarative5-dev libqt5xmlpatterns5-dev qtscript5-dev qttools5-dev qt3d5-dev qtmultimedia5-dev libqt5svg5-dev qtdeclarative5-dev-tools qttools5-dev-tools qtlocation5-dev qtsensors5-dev qtpim5-dev qt-components-ubuntu\n\n\n*Build your C++ app with your build system of choice (cmake, qmake, etc...)\n\nA: Extended instruction founded on previous answer.\nKeep in mind: this instruction describes Qt/Qml developing on PC for Ubuntu Touch without ssh connection with device and require cross-compile tool like linaro.  \nPART 1: making environment\n\n\n*\n\n*Get Ubuntu SDK\n\n*Get toolchain: Linaro or wia sudo apt-get install gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf install toolchain and it's dependencies.\n\n*Get this two libs libhybris and platform-api plus Qt5 libs for armhf (can be obtained from device) or just download tarball with all libs (from tarball your need libs and headers, put them at /usr/arm-gnueabihf/lib and /usr/arm-gnueabihf/include).\n\n*Get modified qmake config - unrar it in mkspecs (for example, mine at /usr/share/qt5/mkspecs/). Inside unrared directory - qmake.conf. If something missed on compiling - it's need to alter path variable in that file.\n\n*For Qt Creator make new compiling profile: in Compiling and deployment settings, on tab Compiler - add new compiler (arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc), on tab Tools - add new profile and specify Device type - General linux-device,  Compiler - ones, that you are added Profile Qt - generic (I'm using not recompiled Qt!!!), Qt mkspec - linux-arm-gnueabihf-gcc. It's all you need for compiling. For debugging - it's need to be specify other params. And beside it, that's better recompile Qt from sources.

My music collection has grown to now approx. 4000 files over the years. They mostly consist of mp3 downloaded from different online shops at various bitrates, mp3 ripped from CDs I own, and DRM-free m4a files from iTunes.\nIn case this matters, I made quite some effort to have my files orderly saved with the following pattern:\n/shared/music/artist/album/track# title.mp3\n\nNow I plan to upload these to a cloud music service (I was thinking of Google Play). I understand that these services are capable of not actually uploading the music data from my files but rather just provide a link to songs they already have on their servers.\nThis is fine as because of limited bandwith, and because of a possible violation of copyright laws in my country I do not want my music files to be uploaded anywhere.\nAlso I do not want my files to end up like this:\n/artist/album/track# title1.mp3\n/artist/collection/sometrack# title2.mp3\n/artist/best_of/yetanothertrack# title3.mp3\n/artist/bonusalbum_from_japan_only/specialtrack# title4.mp3\n\nHow would I have to prepare my music collection to be properly recognized by the service? What applications are available to aid me in doing so?\n\nA: Testing with Google Music, I realized that it's all about the ID3 tag. Whatever you put there, Google uses it. it doesn't matter what the name of your files are, it's all about the ID3.\nEven if you have songs where the Artist and Album Artist are different, Google will display both correctly without any confusion.\nI suggest that you organize your music exactly the way you want it. It seems that Google is following the ID3 standard pretty good, so as long as you also follow that standard your fine.\nI also have a similar structure and I'm pretty obsessed on how my music should be organized, not only file names, but also the metadata.\nI use two programs to achieve this: for a few changes to a few files, use kid3-qt. It doesn't have any dependencies on kde and it's the best ID3 tag software in Ubuntu.\nYou have many options to tag your data from the file name or vice-versa. You can see all the ID3 tags (because software as easytag hide the ones they don't know).\nYou can even select the version of ID3 and text encoding, so you're whole collection is standard.\nI used ID3v2.4 with UTF8.\nYou can install kid3-qt here: http://apt.ubuntu.com/p/kid3-qt\nFor your case, I recommend using a script and use eyeD3 for it. It uses python and has amazing capabilities, and can access almost any tag in ID3.\nYou can use eyeD3 directly from the command-line but I find it more powerful when you create a script with python.\nYou can install eyeD3 by clicking here: http://apt.ubuntu.com/p/eyed3\nThe webpage has sample python scripts on how to use it in a script.\nI'm posting an example script that puts all the artist, album, track# and title in the ID3 following the format of your music directory.\nIt saves the tag in ID3v2.4 with UTF8 encoding\nYou should run the script in your root music folder (/shared/music/).\n#! /usr/bin/python\nimport fnmatch\nimport os\nimport eyeD3\n\naudiofile = eyeD3.Tag()\n\nfor root, dirnames, filenames in os.walk('.'):\n\n    # Linking of ID3 tags and fixing Images\n    for file in fnmatch.filter(filenames, '*.mp3'):\n\n        # Splits the directory name\n        dirSplit = root.split('/')\n        fileSplit = file.split(' ',1)\n\n        # Linking of tags\n        audiofile.link(root + \"/\" + file, eyeD3.ID3_V2)\n\n        audiofile.setTextEncoding(eyeD3.UTF_8_ENCODING)\n\n        print fileSplit[0]\n\n        # Setting the Artist, album, number and title\n        audiofile.setArtist(dirSplit[1])\n        audiofile.setAlbum(dirSplit[2])\n        audiofile.setTrackNum([fileSplit[0]])\n        audiofile.setTitle(fileSplit[1])\n\n        audiofile.do_tdtg = 0     # set to not use the TDTG frame\n        audiofile.update(eyeD3.ID3_V2_4,0)\n\nYou can use this script as a starting point and maybe read the full filename and directory and use it to tag each one of your file exactly the way you want.\nIf you're not as obsessive as I am with metadata, kid3-qt with the option to set the metadata as the file structure (and you can set the structure exactly how you want it) will work perfectly.\nBTW, you can also use eyeD3 to batch remove ID3V1.1 which I find it extremely annoying since it's such an old standard that lacks many features and people and devices should stop using it completely.\n\nA: I would do two things. Because your directory structure is so neat (compliment) I would use this structure to a) put as much information as possible in the actual file name and b) put that information in the tags.\nYou could rename your files artist-album-track. You could also write a bash script to rename them based on your directory structure. If you have the right ID3 1.x tags, you can use mp3info to extract the data and use it in a bash script to rename your files according to their tags to achieve a similar result. \nIf you want to, you could even use your directory structure to add the album and artist tags in your files. Again you can use mp3info here:\n\nmp3info is a utility used to read and modify the ID3 tags in MPEG layer\n  3  (MP3)  files.   It  can  also (optionally) display various technical\n  attributes of the MP3 file.\n\n\nA: Personally I like mp3tag. It can edit all the tags with a lot of helpful functions. It can also rename files according to their metadata and even extract metadata from file names. It is a windows program but it runs flawlessly with wine.\nIf you want a Linux native program try easytag. It seems to have similar functionality but I've never tried it myself. It should be installable using apt-get or the software center.\n\nA: This may be completely off-base, but I've used a program called Picard from Musicbrainz that allows you to add tags and artwork to files. It's exceptionally good at figuring out what files are which.\nIt's available here: http://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_Picard\n\nA: Remark: I wanted to edit my other answer, but this tool deserves a separate answer for future reference.\nFor users that have metadata in their mp3s (which is often the case when music is bought legally), it is possible to rename the files based on the metadata. \nThere is an excellent package which does renaming based on metadata for music and images:\npyRenamer. One can install it using sudo apt-get install pyrenamer.\nIt essentially uses regular expressions and metadata to rename files. You can thus rename the files to include the information available in the metadata. Here is a screenshot.\n\nThis also works for images. \nSources:\n\n\n*\n\n*A Blog post\n\n*A demonstration video\n\n*The author's docs\n", "Q: How to uninstall a program (MagicDraw) and clean hidden files I installed MagicDraw 17.0 SE in /opt running the sh I downloaded from the official site.\nI had to re-install it because of a java issue, so I deleted the opt/MagicDraw folder and I ran the sh again.\nThe problem is that I have a hidden .magicdraw folder which has not been updated after the new installation, and I need it to be updated, since I messed with the files that were inside it and it's completely useless now.\nSo, how can I uninstall MagicDraw properly?\n\nA: Since you didn't install it as a .deb through dpkg you sadly can't use \nsudo apt-get purge magicdraw\n\nYou would have to find all the folders it installed and remove them manually.\nThe .magicdraw is most likely found in your /home/$username directory.\nTo find any other files or folders that could've been installed with the script I'd use \nlocate magicdraw \n\nand then delete every file it shows on there.\nI'd recommend running \nsudo updatedb\n\nbefore using locate to make sure the information is not outdated.\n", "Q: Networking Disabled under VMWare Fusion on Mac OS X I use MacBook with Mac OS X Lion 10.7.5.

I would like to know what exactly is that large list of files? Sorry if this is a naive question...\nHere's a link to the screenshot: Screenshot of my Software Center's History Section\n\nA: I think you must install ubuntu using LiveCD.\nInstalling Linux with LiveCD is something like installing Windows using Ghost_CD/DVD.\nSo the softwares you saw in Software Center's history were installed by the Canonical before the company packed the whole ubuntu system up and made it into LiveCD.\n", "Q: How to find and download a missing plugin?

I have a dictionary in StarDict format without an *.ifo file.\nI know how the file should look like, but I don't know how many words exactly the dictionary has, neither how to check it without counting manually [sic].\nI've spent a couple of hours looking for the answer but found none.\nI have installed stardict-tools from the Software Center, but apparently it isn't equipped with the option \"stardict-repair\", mentioned here: http://code.google.com/p/stardict-3/wiki/RepairStarDictDicts, on the StarDict project's page.\nSo my question is twofold: 1. how to obtain stardict-repair on Ubuntu 12.10 and get it running; 2. (perhaps a bit off-topic) how to conveniently create a correct ifo file if there isn't any.\n\nA: The tools are installed to /usr/lib/stardict-tools/. stardict-index and stardict-verify are both there. Since they are located outside of your current PATH setting, the terminal cannot find them to run. \nTo run them from the terminal, you have several options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal and use the fully qualified name that includes the path:\n/usr/lib/stardict-tools/stardict-verify\n\n*Browse to the stardict-tools directory and use the ./ prefix:\ncd /usr/lib/stardict-tools, then use ./startdict-verify\n\n*If you find you use the tools a lot, you can add the directory to the PATH or add aliases, .desktop files, or make your own wrapper scripts, etc. But those things are probably not worth the trouble right now.\nstardict-repair, however, is not included in the directory. The Ubuntu package is not the current version, so that could be the reason, or there could be another reason.\nFor making your own dictionaries, seeStarDict Create Dictionary\nFor details on the .ifo format, see StarDict Formats\nIf you must have the repair tool, you would need to compile and install the package from from source.\nHow to Compile the Package\nDownload the source code\nOpen a terminal in ~/Downloads. The download will go to the directory you are in when you run the download command.\nRun hg clone https://code.google.com/p/stardict-3/ to download the source code.\nPre-compilation steps\nThere's a bug in 2 of the files that needs to be fixed. Because of changes to one of the required libraries, each file has a line that needs to be changed before they will compile.\nThe 2 files are libcommon.h and libcommon.cpp, but you can download the updated files.\nThe downloads are at http://code.google.com/p/stardict-3/issues/detail?id=31. Scroll down until you see the post with the replacement files attached.\nDownload each file into ~/Downloads/stardict-3/lib/src, saying yes when asked if you want to replace the existing file.\nA standard Ubuntu install will not automatically have tools for compiling installed, plus each app will its own required libraries. \nFor stardict tools, you need: \nsudo apt-get install build-essential automake libtool libmysqlclient-dev libpcre3-dev\nCompiling\ncd ~/Downloads/stardict-3/\n\nMost packages have a ready-made configure file that you would run at this point. With this package, you need to run a utility to create the configure file.\nMake sure you are in the stardict-3 directory (there are multiple autogen files in the structure and you need to run the right one), then: \n./autogen.sh\n\nNow run the configure file with the --disable-dict option to compile just the tools.\n./configure --disable-dict\n\nCompile the package with make (Note there's no ./ this time)\nmake is usually followed with make install, but I don't think we want to do that here, since it will copy over the files installed from the Ubuntu repository. Instead, cd tools/src where you will find the binaries you just compiled.\nIn the terminal, binaries will be the green files and will not have an extension. (Files with the same name ending in .o are intermediate files that are no longer needed, files ending in .cpp are the original source code and can also be ignored. \nCopy stardict-repair and any other file that may not have been included before to /usr/lib/stardict-tools. You only need to copy the binary file. Remember the ./ when run you them.\nOne note: we compiled the newest version. It's possible, though I think really not very likely, that there may be some incompatibility between this version of stardict-repair and the rest of package you have. If so, it should be possible to compile a previous version of the tool.  \n", "Q: How can I remotely stream videos to my tablet? I'd like to be able to watch my videos that I keep on my desktop running Ubuntu 12.04.2 on my tablet (Nexus 7) when they're connected to  different networks.

YouTube has offered me no help; same with Google. \nIf I make a DVD or CD (the CD would have to be of Ubuntu 12.04 due to file size), it boots from it, but won't even get to the purple screen. It just stays on the first black screen with a white blinking cursor. Nothing changes.\nI can't make a bootable USB stick for mac, though. I do have another computer with Ubuntu on it, but ever since it started to crash when I make a bootable usb, I started downloading more programs, which caused it to just say 'installation failed' immediately.

I eventually just delete it and try again. It happens every time. Reinstalling Ubuntu didn't help either. \nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Follow instruction here\nYou need to install the cutter application, use that to unpack the proper firmware.  Then you use modprobe -r to remove all the drivers... then modprobe to load the driver you want.

It's on a 30GB primary SSD, and I want to offload large files to the 1TB hard drive that also resides in my system.\nI installed steam and it defaulted to my SSD as expected. Is there anything special I would have to add to the fstab for my second ext3 HDD? Is this as simple as symlinking to a directory on the hard disk?\nConclusion:\nI mounted my hard drive disk as /home in fstab.

But than you have to choose this drive at every Download.\nTo change the default Download folder,\nJust quit Steam (important!) and move the entire Steam folder to another location\nmv ~/.local/share/Steam /new/path\nand start Steam again. It says something like \"can't find Steam, did you move it?\" and than you can choose the new folder location.\n\nA: When you click on a game to install it on the first window that pops up there will be a drop down menu.

I've used the scripted removal advised by fossfreedom but I'm still getting errors when Software Updater tries to run. I'm only concerned because based on my homework it seems that Launchpad is somewhat important, so I'm concerned unchecking it in Software Sources will keep me from getting future updates on it.\nSo, the two parts are if I uncheck them in Software Sources, will that be preventing all possible Launchpad updates, will some other \"failsafe\" still update Launchpad with those items unchecked, or is there something else I should be doing? Thanks in advance for any guidance you can provide.\nPS: I apologize that I had to link to a text file with info on the errors and a link to the question I had checked, but I don't have enough rep to have 2 or more URLs, and the errors contain URLs.

I have a Lenovo u410 ultrabook. It's sata scheme consists of a 30gb SSD and a 1tb hdd in a raid0 with intel rapid start technology. I removed IRST and disabled the raid0. I want to install ubuntu on the ssd and /home/ on the 1gb hdd. I foolishly erased the efi partition on the 1tb and attempted to recreate it by formatting the ssd and creating a new GPT partition table. I made a 250mb fat32 partition (/dev/sda1) and filled the rest ~24gb with an ext4 partition (/dev/sda2)\nI made a live USB using a 12.04.2 iso and universal usb installer. The installation completes fine however at the end I get the error \"Failed to install grub-efi to /target/ the system will not boot\". \nI tried to open terminal and update grub however it's not there and when trying to install grub-efi from the repo I get flagged for missing a lot of dependencies. Ubiquity crashes after the error message.\nI had success a few months ago installed 12.10 using my friends usb cd drive however I broke the system and cant be down until I next see him. Is there a huge difference in 12.10 and LTS that would stop this install from working smoothly?\nMy net goal is to have Ubuntu running on the machine with steam (tf2 and bastion) and eclipse IDE. If 12.10 is better suited, and can solve this efi issue then I'll gladly install that however from my understanding LTS would be more stable and still run the modern updates of Quantal.\nWill 12.10 install grub-efi flawlessly? and if not how can I install grub-efi from the live usb onto a solid state drive /dev/sda with efi boot on /dev/sda1, ext4 mounted as root on /dev/sda2, and /home/ on the hard disk /dev/sdb2?\nConclusion:\nLTS wasn't capable of handling the uefi environment. Downloading and installing 12.10 worked flawlessly. Raring worked fine too, however it was unstable with the drivers necessary for steam.\nHardware: Lenovo U410 ultrabook\nHDs: 30 GB SSD, 1 T HDD with raid0\nUbuntu: 12.04     \n\nA: In my case, I skip install grub by running ubiquity from terminal using the following command: \nubiquity -b\n\nIt also means that  you have to install grub by your bare hand.\nAfter ubuntu has been installed.

You have to do mount /dev/sdXY /boot/efi. Then run the grub-install /dev/sdX and the remaining commands with success. And reboot.\n\nA: Ubuntu's been making slow but steady improvements in its EFI support for the last several versions, so yes, there are differences between 12.04 and 12.10 that could be important. That said, the fact that you got a bunch of dependency errors when you tried to install grub-efi suggests that a more fundamental problem might be the root cause -- perhaps there was a network problem that prevented a string of other packages from installing, for instance. If so, trying again at a later time might correct matters.\nThat said, on an EFI system, IMHO it's better to use 12.10 than 12.04. This is especially true if it's a recent computer that shipped with Windows 8, since such computers also invariably use Secure Boot, which Ubuntu 12.10 supports but Ubuntu 12.04 doesn't. This isn't the root cause of your problem, though, since 12.04's installation disc won't boot at all if Secure Boot is active; I mention it only for the benefit of others who might read this page.\n\nA: You should have \n/boot/efi    \n\nand about 100MB  ,then everything is ok...\nmine is\nsda1 /boot/efi  100MB\nsda2 /          100G\nsda3 /swap      16384MB    \nsdb1 /home      3TB\n\n\nA: This error was solved for me by making sure there was an internet connection available to the installer.\nWhen I chose not to connect I got this error.\n\nA: Try to disable BIOS QuickBoot/FastBoot and Intel Smart Response Technology (SRT).\nThen install Ubuntu 12.10 <- IMPORTANT 12.10\nThen try to install, if nedeed, grub-efi-amd64-signed \nRegards,   \n\nA: In my case, on a Lenovo X230 laptop, I also reproducible got this error. Things got solved by:\nsetting in the BIOS `Boot tab➝UEFI/BIOS boot mode´ to legacy. \nBefore, the setting was a ‘smart mix’ of UEFI/LEGACY („legacy first“). Pure UEFI might sound more logical but all I can say is: it works. Even in a dual-boot context with two linux distros around.\n\nA: This was happening to me with Xubuntu 16.04.2 installer. Certainly you could disable UEFI and do a traditional install, but in my case I would be losing the faster POST times.\nThis problem is caused because the Efi System Partition (ESP) partition is missing. It must be a FAT32 partition marked as bootable. You can create it with GParted, fdisk or your tool of choice. Then the installer will detect it and mount it as /boot/efi, solving thus the problem.\nThere's more info and details about the size, type, etc. in the ArchLinux wiki page about ESP (it applies to Ubuntu too).\n", "Q: Can I change user in the Unity interface without having to type password when changing back? First of all, let me emphasize that I am talking about my home computer that I use for personal use.\nI have two accounts in Ubuntu: one for me, one for my wife.  We don't use separate accounts to keep secrets from one another (as far as I know), but we do like having separate internet cookies and application settings.\nUbuntu makes it convenient to switch from one user to the other without logging out, but the issue I have is that when I switch from my account to my wife's account, the screen locks so that I must type my password again when switch back.\nHow can I make it so that the screen doesn't automatically lock under this circumstance?\n\nA: Press CtrlAltF7 and CtrlAltF8 to switch between two currently running graphical user sessions.  This will keep your session running while you are on your wife's account.  Note that, if you ever have more then two users logged, in, they will be assigned to CtrlAltF9, CtrlAltF10, and so on.  When you use Unity's \"Switch User\" feature, behind the scenes it automatically locks your screen and then switches between graphical consoles.  This method does that without the locking step, which is what I believe you are looking for.\n", "Q: How do I change the timezone on PHP5 for Apache?

Yesterday I downloaded Ubuntu 12.10 and I installed it along side my Windows XP installation. Then since it was running slow, I decided to remove XP. I decided to do a fresh install of Ubuntu via USB.\nSo when I was installing it, it detected that my PC has a Windows XP installation, but it didn't show that I already have Ubuntu or anything like that. Should I continue just by formatting Windows XP or should I do something else?\n\nA: I have had success in the past by reformatting using gparted and wiping the entire drive and then doing a fresh install of Ubuntu after that. You can make a live USB here. After you have wiped the entire drive just do a fresh install of Ubuntu.\n\nYou can also just select use the entire drive on Ubuntu when installing.\n", "Q: SMPlayer doesn't work with VDPAU? I recently bought a Nvidia GT 440, and installed the proprietary nvidia-experimental-310 driver.\nEvery player seems to be working alright with VDPAU, except Mplayer frontends like SMPlayer.\nAny ideas on why this is happening?\n\nA: If it actually works with mplayer:\nmplayer -vo vdpau -vc ffh264vdpau somefile.mkv\n\nin SMPlayer, it should be as simple as setting it to use vdpau in Options / Preferences / General / Video. Set the Output driver vdpau (it should be there in the drop-down list in a recent enough version, without the need to use the User defined setting).\nHow did you install the proprietary drivers and are you sure the required libraries for vdpau are installed?\n", "Q: Wubi's Ubuntu files Can I access to Wubi's files from Windows? I saved a few files on my Ubuntu desktop and I'd like to access them even when I'm running Windows. Any help?\n\nA: There is a tool called Explore2fs which allows you to read ext2 and 3 partitions in Windows. This program works in every version of Windows.\nThere is some valuable information in the Wubi guide\n\nA: You should check what your file system is. You can do this as follows:\nbcbc@16:14:50:~$ mount | grep ' / '\n/dev/loop0 on / type ext4 (rw,errors=remount-ro)\n\nIf your file system shows up as ext4 then you can use ext2read, but this is read-only access. If it's ext3 then ext2read will still work, and others such as Explore2fs will likely work. The website for Explore2fs seems to indicate that it's read only access too. \nI've used ext2read and it's known to work with Wubi when you have an ext4 file system.\nAlternatively, you should consider storing shared data on an NTFS partition. This is much easier for sharing with Windows and allows read/write access from both Operating Systems. In addition, if the data is important then it's safer to install them directly to the /host or another mounted partition, rather than storing them on a loop device (the Wubi virtual disk) that is a single file, and when corrupted can be lost (along with all data within it).\nPS a bit of background... Wubi installs are supposed to be ext4 only, but when Ubuntu 11.10 came out, Wubi added a new disk image install option (when wubi.exe is used to install Ubuntu only, and with no ISO present), and these disk images were supposed to be ext4, but they found out later they were ext3. The idea is that they'll switch back to ext4 when this bug is fixed; it looks like the plan is to do this for release 13.10.\nBut any Wubi installs from USB/DVD or with the ISO, including Xubuntu, Kubuntu, Lubuntu, Edubuntu etc. all use ext4.\n", "Q: Is BumbleBee installed incorrectly?

When I then tried to run it again, it gave me the same error.\nBased on the strace, I think there is some problem with how it's threading, but I have no idea how to fix this. Is there some way to reinstall the basic bash utilities? \nHere's more information about my system:\n$ uname -a\nmyhost 3.2.0-37-generic-pae #58-Ubuntu SMP Thu Jan 24 15:51:02 UTC 2013 i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux\n\n(I'm pretty sure the hardware is 64bit)\n\nA: Use aptdcon, which communicates with apt-daemon via dbus so it doesn't need su or sudo, to reinstall the damaged packages. Probably your best chance is to reinstall ALL the packages.\nFirst, make sure there is no broken install pending a fix:\naptdcon --fix-install\n\nAlso make sure there is free space available on your disk:\ndf -h\n\nThen, get your currently installed package list:\necho \\\"$(dpkg --get-selections | grep install | cut -f 1)\\\"\n\nSave that for later, on a text editor of something. Then, call aptdcon like this, using the full package list:\naptdcon --reinstall \"package1 package2 package3...\"\n\nI'm telling you this way because aptdcon won't be able to reinstall some packages for various reasons, so you will have to strip them out if aptdcon cries about that, and try again, probably more than once.\n\nA: I saw this problem, but the root cause was slightly different. I had been testing Kerberos and had something misconfigured in my /etc/krb5.conf. I discovered via strace that sudo was segfaulting shortly after reading that file so I figured there was an issue with my configuration file. I didn't track down a specific variable but one thing that stood out was that I had the default_domain variable empty in the krb5.conf like so\n[libdefaults]\n   default_realm = \n\nThis may have cause some sloppy code in sudo to make a zero length string and mishandle it somehow causing the SIGSEGV. I didn't try to debug it any further since this wasn't the correct setting. I simply deleted my /etc/krb5.conf.\n\nA: There is a chance that a pam module from samba is causing this.\nIf that's the case, then this should fix it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot the machine and choose to boot to the recovery mode.

How can I make it persistent?\nI use xfce4-xkb-plugin as my input language switcher, but it doesn't seem to have an option to set caps key function.\n\nA: Add the setxkbmap option in XKBOPTIONS in /etc/default/keyboard.

After about one hour of waiting I closed the USC and rebooted the PC. \nNow I have got the problem that whenever I want to install software via sudo apt-get install <software> I get the following error:\nquantal@Flubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get install <whatever-package>\nE: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (11 Resource temporarily unavailable)\nE: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), is another process using it?\n\nAfter killing dpkg in terminal (sudo killall dpkg) or rebooting I get the next error: \nquantal@Flubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get install <whatever-package>\nE: dpkg was interrupted, you must manually run 'sudo dpkg --configure -a' to correct\n\nAnd when I try to execute sudo dpkg --configure -a the command hangs at \nupdate-initramfs: Generating /boot/initrd.img-3.5.0-25-generic\n\nWhen I start sudo update-initramfs -k all -u -v in verbose mode it says that it adds many modules, binaries and firmware (which I have not included in the output) but then is stuck after the following six lines:\nAdding binary /lib/firmware/radeon/TAHITI_me.bin\nAdding firmware radeon/TAHITI_me.bin\nAdding binary /lib/firmware/radeon/TAHITI_pfp.bin\nAdding firmware radeon/TAHITI_pfp.bin\nAdding module /lib/modules/3.5.0-23-generic/kernel/drivers/gpu/drm/i2c/sil164.ko\nAdding module /lib/modules/3.5.0-23-generic/kernel/drivers/gpu/drm/i2c/ch7006.ko\n\nBlacklisting ch7006 or the module before doesn't work; I have also tried to manually rename ch7006.ko and sil164.ko (after checking that it isn't necessary for the system) but then it is stuck at the line before.\nMany thanks in advance!\nFurther information:\nNOTE: When booting Ubuntu I get NO errors or so, so the kernel boots but I cannot update it (and apt-get install doesn't want to install software as long as this problem exists).\nThe output of uname -a:\nLinux Flubuntu 3.5.0-23-generic #35-Ubuntu SMP Thu Jan 24 13:15:40 UTC 2013 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\n\nA: Today I've also encountered this error and removing then reinstalling initramfs-tools have fixed the hangs I've been experiencing.\nsudo apt remove initramfs-tools\nsudo apt install initramfs-tools\n\nIn my case, it was probably some configuration or a temporary file was broken / locked for initramfs-tools.\nThis was on Ubuntu 18.04 so it can still happen.\n\nA: Okay, I have found a workaround to fix this error.\n\n\n*\n\n*After I executed the steps in my question, I tried to remove the kernel with:\nsudo update-initramfs -k 3.5.0-23-generic -d\n\n\n*After a reboot GRUB showed up and selected my version of Ubuntu but when it tried to load the kernel, it said\n\nKernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block (0,0)\n\n\n*Then I just chrooted with a LiveCD into Ubuntu and executed:\nsudo dpkg --configure -a\nsudo apt-get install linux-image-3.5.0-25-generic\n\nAnd after a reboot everything was OK.\n\nA: Step 2 of slashcrack’s sounds largely unnecessary. Instead it should suffice to run\nsudo update-initramfs -d -k <VERSION>\nsudo apt-get install -f\n\nwhere you replace <VERSION> with the affected kernel version string (here: 3.5.0-23-generic).\n\nA: so I found a major reason for myself on update-initramfs would get stuck.\nproblematic usb drives.  if a usb drive would be connected but in a stuck state, it would just hang. if the usb device device would be removed (physically) the system would realize it, and whatever was hung on it, would get unhung and continue.\nIn practice, I really think whatever it is doing (os-prober or something else) should be generally smart enough to skip removable disks, unless specifically configured to not (ex: if installing ubuntu onto a removable disk, then it mark it as true to scan removable media, if installing to a fixed disk, then it wouldn't, though in both cases could be modified to change behavior.  But this is more of a bug fix, the practical fix (for me) is above.  dis\n", "Q: \"sudo bash\" ignoring read-only permission of .bash_history file This problem is in an up-to-date 12.04, and seems to have started recently.\nI have my .bash_history file set to read only. Lately I've noticed that despite this the file is being modified !\nHere's the scenario. \nIn a new terminal, here is the tail of the file:\n$ tail -5 .bash_history \nmkdir -p ttt ; gs -dNOPAUSE -sDEVICE=png16m -r180 -sOutputFile=ttt/p%03d.png *.pdf\nrsync -av /home/u1204 /media/SEAGATE/u1204 \ngnote.late.reminders|GREP_COLOR='1;32' egrep -i \"is overdue\"\npvr_iplayer -x -HD /home/u1204/Documents/pvr/tv-hd ; pvr_iplayer -x -STD /home/u1204/Documents/pvr/tv-std\nexit\n\nopen a shell with raised privileges\n $ sudo bash [sudo] \n password for u1204: \n\n # ls -l ~/.bash_history\n -r-------- 1 u1204 u1204 1266 Feb 23 19:52 /home/u1204/.bash_history\n\nso .bash_history is still definitely read-only.\nDo something, then exit the escalated shell:\n# echo \"written to history file\"\nwritten to history file\n\n# exit\nexit\n\nAnd Voilà, the history file has been modified !\n$ ls -l ~/.bash_history\n-r-------- 1 u1204 u1204 1324 Feb 23 20:10 /home/u1204/.bash_history\n\nOpen another terminal to confirm:\n$ tail -5 .bash_history \npvr_iplayer -x -HD /home/u1204/Documents/pvr/tv-hd ; pvr_iplayer -x -STD /home/u1204/Documents/pvr/tv-std\nexit\nls -l ~/.bash_history\necho \"written to history file\"\nexit\n\nI'm pretty sure that it didn't used to do this (in 10.04 at least). \nAnyway, this can't be correct behaviour, can it?\n\nA: Root has universal read/write to everything.  Period.  \nProponents of windows like to claim its authentication system is stronger because it doesn't have a \"god\" account and even local administrators can be explicitly denied.  \nYou cannot deny root any access to any thing on the local system.  \nAfter some comments, it got me thinking you might be looking for a way to not write to bash history at all.  You could do that like this: http://www.commandlinefu.com/commands/view/7041/dont-save-commands-in-bash-history-only-for-current-session \nPutting unset HISTFILE in your bashrc for those that don't want to follow the link.\n\nA: Yes, you can ultimatively deny access.\nchattr +i\n\n\nA: @Thor \n\nI'm pretty sure that it didn't used to do this (in 10.04 at least).\n\nIt actually does.  \nWhat I think happens is if you use sudo, you still get to keep your identity but with lifted privileges, if you used sudo su - on the other hand, you would have become the \"real root\". hence the difference.\n\nA: RO is nothing a program cannot override, as long as you're root or owner of the file. So the correct way is not to set the file to r--, but to execute \nunset HISTFILE\nFor \"sudo -s\" this should work (environment is copied, exactly the reason why your user's .bash_history is used), for \"sudo -i\" (like \"su -\") you're using /root/.bash_history anyway. If you do not want to do this, you need to unset HISTFILE in your root's .bashrc/.bash_profile.\nbtw: as already mentioned the correct way to get a root-shell is sudo -s / sudo -i. \"sudo su\" or \"sudo bash\" works, but its a rather unclean way to do so.\n", "Q: Super key shortcuts \"unresponsive\" when configured via Custom Shortcuts When I set custom shortcuts from Keyboard / Shortcuts / Custom Shortcuts, all of the ones set to use Super key (e.g. Super + 1, set to open a text file using the default text editor) have a weird threshold between key presses. If Super is released too quickly, the shortcut is not registered. In practice, it requires, what I would call, an abnormally long press.\nIf I set up exactly same keys via Commands plugin in Compiz, the unresponsiveness is gone. What causes this behaviour? Can the the \"threshold\" be changed from somewhere? Does this happen on purpose - to give priority to the default Super key shortcuts in Unity? \nAdditional information:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 12.10\n\n*Seems to affect only Super key (at least I have not noticed the same on other keys)\n\n*Super key is not assigned to show the launcher (I've changed it to Super + A, but it seems to make no difference whether Super is used)\n\n*The command or key combination does not matter, except possibly if additionally Ctrl, Shift or Alt are used (e.g. Ctrl+Super+1), but I am not 100% sure about this, because it is hard to test this consistently as the difference is only in milliseconds\n\n\nI do not want use Compiz / Commands, because the plugin only allows 20 commands (why is there such restriction in the first place?!) and setting up them in there is much more troublesome.\n\nA: I just tested it and it seems like Super will have preference always, so just add Alt to your Custom Shortcuts and you should be sorted.\n", "Q: Making bootable usb in Mac OS 9? So I have an old G3 imac with mac os 9.2 and mac os 10.1.5  installed on it. I would like to use this computer to make a bootable ubuntu usb stick. However when I followed the instructions for using terminal in os x,it did not work.I dont know if the computer is just too old. I am new to linux. Is there any way that I can use this computer to create a bootable usb?\n\nA: I believe that this thread has the answer you are looking for:\ncan't make bootable usb on mac\nLooks pretty straight forward.\n", "Q: Take the first n files from a directory starting with a particular letter in alphabetical order to another directory I need to take the first 3 files from a directory starting with letter b in alphabetical order to another directory.

Ideally I'd just pipe the output of the above command to mv, but I don't think that's possible.\n(P.S. I have to do this without grep, sed or awk)\n\nA: Instead of parsing find output (very bad idea), you can take advantage of the fact that for loops over files in an ordered way:\ni=0; for b in /path/to/files/b*; do (( ++i < 4 )) && echo mv -v -- \"$b\" /path/to/destination; done\n\nRemove echo after testing to actually move the files.\nHere it is with ugly comments:\n# set a variable to 0 so we can increment it\ni=0\n# glob for the files starting with b\nfor b in /path/to/files/b*; do \n   # test how many times the loop has been run and if it's less than 4...\n   (( ++i < 4 )) && \n     # ... then move the files*  \n     echo mv -v -- \"$b\" /path/to/destination\ndone\n\n*This won't happen until you remove echo from the start of the line - instead it will echo out which files will be moved and where (expand the variables for each iteration)\nI don't know if this works in tcsh, but it works in bash, so might help other Ubuntu users who mainly use bash\n\nA: You can take a list of file and process them through a for loop in a shell script, or if you on the command line itself (it will just be harder to reader)\nCheck out this article at nixCraft. Another tutorial as well.\nYou should be able to do something like\nfor f in `find /users/students/ejackson/A3-ejackson-55688-114906/CS282in -name \"b*\" | sort | head -3`\ndo\n    cp $f [target]\ndone\n\n\nA: You mentioned that you are using tcsh. The family of C-Shells is not compatible with Bourne shells. This command might work:\nset THREE_FILES=`find …`\ncp $THREE_FILES NEW_DIRECTORY\n\nThe first set command makes a new enviroment variable called THREE_FILES and saves the output into that variable. The cp takes the three files and copies them to the NEW_DIRECTORY.\n", "Q: Intel G630 Processor suitability I have a computer with an Intel 630 Processor, 4Gig Ram and 500 GB Hard Drive.

A bit annoying.\nMy question IS NOT about \"how to add a shortcut for switching keyboard layout\".\n\nA: It does not appear possible to get Kile (or any KDE app) to behave the way that you want. \nGtk apps, such as Gedit, do behave the way you want. The keyboard shortcuts change according to the selected keyboard. They work this way whether under Unity or KDE.\nKDE apps, in contrast, do not change the keyboard shortcuts when you change the keyboard layout. Rather, they will keep the shortcuts aligned with the system language setting. They work this way whether under KDE or Unity. I could not find any setting or configuration method in KDE to change this behavior.\n", "Q: Secure boot error on Lenovo z475 I can't seem to install Ubuntu 12.10-desktop-amd64 to my computer. I've written the install to my memory stick but it flashed secure boot error really fast then sits on the grub screen.\n\nA: I found the problem. There was no mention anywhere of having to use a special image called amd64+mac anywhere. Everything worked after I used one of these images.\n\nA: Ubuntu 12.10 is supposed to include Secure Boot support; but maybe there's a bug that's affecting you, or maybe your computer tried to boot the disk in BIOS/legacy mode rather than in EFI mode (which is required for Secure Boot).\nProbably the easiest way to proceed is to disable Secure Boot. This is a firmware option, but unfortunately, there's no standardization of firmware user interfaces, so I can't provide step-by-step instructions on how to do this. You'll just have to activate your firmware setup utility (usually by pressing Del or a function key early in the boot process) and browse the options until you find one related to Secure Boot.\nOnce you've done this and booted the Ubuntu installer, drop to a shell and check for the presence of a directory called /sys/firmware/efi. If it's present, proceed with the installation. If it's not present, you've probably booted in BIOS mode. Although you could install in this way, that will create complications related to selecting which OS to boot, so I recommend you reboot and try checking your computer's boot menu (usually accessed by pressing a function key early in the boot process) to find a way to force an EFI-mode boot of the Ubuntu installer.\n\nA: I have the same notebook and the same problem. \nWhen I tried to boot using different ubuntu live versions it hangs up in the grub menu (totally freeze) most of the times.\nBut the menus respond with other distros or at least it can boot (with debian 6 and 7 full use of boot menu and boots with fedora 17)\nAnd one thing that i'm not able to figure, but happens, is that if a boot with debian live cd, not install anything, just boot, and then reboot with a ubunutu live cd (12 or 13) the grub menu doesn't freeze most of the times. \nIts odd.\nIt's not too elegant, but you can give a try to this, and try ubuntu 13, that seems to be more compatible with this lenovo model (z475)\n", "Q: PyGTK changing theme for popup menu I spent few hours searching on google and I gave up now...\nI need to change background for popup menu in my app.\nIt set to whatever system default theme is... and I need this to be set to Radiance for all the time.\nany ideas how to achieve this?\n\n\nA: I theme my popup windows like so:\n#Use Css themes\ncss = Gtk.CssProvider()\ncss.load_from_data(\"\"\"\n        .popup {background-color: rgba(0,0,0,0); border: 0px rgba(255,255,255,0);  border-radius: 14px; border-width: 0;  }\n    \"\"\" \nGtk.StyleContext.add_provider_for_screen(Gdk.Screen.get_default(), css,\n        Gtk.STYLE_PROVIDER_PRIORITY_APPLICATION)\n\n#Get popup parent and set rgba visual so I can do transparency\npwindow=self.popup.get_parent()\nscreen=pwindow.get_screen()\npwindow.set_visual(screen.get_rgba_visual())\n\n#Give popups the popup CSS class\nself.popup.get_style_context().add_class('popup')\n\nI also use cairo to draw the popup window and give it a nice texture. To do that I just connect its 'draw' signal to a call back.\nI would look at the Radiance Gtk theme to find out what the background color is and use that for the background-color css setting. You can find it in /usr/share/themes/Radiance/Gtk-3.0/gtk.css. If you don't need transparency, then skip the pwindow stuff above and just add the style_context to your popup.\n", "Q: WiFi randomly turning off \"via hardware switch\" My network card uses a 'Realtek RTL8187B chipset'. The issue is, after about 30 minutes of working, the WiFi turns off, and dmesg says: \nturned off via hardware switch\n\nTurning the actual switch [off] and [on] again doesn't change anything, and rfkill list all shows the device as Hard Blocked.\nIf I do rmmod rtl8187 and then modprobe rtl8187, dmesg shows:\nrtl8187: wireless switch is on\nieee80211 phy1: eeprom reset timeout!, ADDRCONF(NETDEV_UP): wlan0: link is not ready\n\nThe 'nm-applet' shows the device as not ready.

Sometimes the iwlist scan succeeds, sometimes it shows nothing and whenever I manage to connect, after about 30 minutes I'm back to square one.\nIf I'm particularly unlucky, the card doesn't start at all, and instead it spams my dmesg from the system start by unable to enumerate usb device messages. Everything seems to happen more or less randomly.\n\n\n*\n\n*Can it be a problem with my drivers; rtl8187 3.2.0-29-generic or is the card faulty?\n\n\nA: Perhaps you can try sudo iwconfig wlan0 power off and see whether it solve the problem. Sometime wireless issue could be due to its power management feature. I have encountered some issue with the power management on.\nTo confirm whether power feature is on, you can do sudo iwconfig and you would see the power management status in the output.\n", "Q: Partition: Read error My laptop came to a grinding halt.

Check the SMART status in the disk utility for more details.  You might try dd if=/dev/zero count=1 of=/dev/sda to write zeros to the MBR and see if that prompts the drive to recover that sector.  If that fails, then the drive is toast and it's time to restore from backup.\n"]
