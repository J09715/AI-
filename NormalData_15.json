["Q: How does Apple's Power Nap interact with File Vault? If a machine is periodically waking up to check for updates with Power Nap, does this also mean the disk encryption keys are always in RAM? If so, this makes a DMA attack against a \"sleeping\" Mac possible.\n\nA: In general, Apple disables FireWire DMA in states where the computer isn't unlocked for use. There were some states they missed early on (see Todd Garrison's description of the problem), but they tightened the access controls in 10.7.2 (see CVE-2011-3215 here).\nPower nap adds a new DMA-should-be-disabled state, so there's a possibility that it might have reintroduced this vulnerability, but I would expect Apple to have handled this correctly. Unfortunately, I don't know of anyone who's actually tested it (and I don't have a power-nap-capable Mac myself).\n\nA: Unless Apple messed up and writes the keys or passphrase insecurely, then the Mac is no more vulnerable than when it is running or sleeping normally.\n", "Q: Can Mac App Store Apps be \"sideloaded\"? The issue I am facing is bandwidth is very expensive where I live, I pay by the MB so if I need to install Final Cut on 10 different computers it would be murder to download it 10 times, is it possible to install on one computer and then move the files over and just pay for it on the other computer without having to get the files again? Or is the installation tied to a computer? Thank you.\n\nA: You can copy/paste the application from one Mac to another, they will run as they are self-contained (no files required in other locations).\nYou may not even need to login to the App Store to run them. I had to install Xcode and Final Cut Pro on a very restricted network environment where the App Store is blocked, the apps ran fine.\nLicensing is an issue if you use the apps in a non-personal environment (businness, education). Download and install work the same way.\n\nA: Technically, side loading is fine. Most applications require you to be signed in to the store to run the app, but you certainly don't need to download 10 copies of the same app if you are using the same account. \nLicense wise, this is fine for personal use since one copy of an App is licensed for use on all of your personal-use computers. You would want to get an OK from Apple for commercial use as you are expected to have one license per computer or person. \n\nA: I think the technicalities lie in how the developer chooses to package their apps.  Each download has a signature/receipt file as part of teh download bundle.  This should be tied to your Apple ID as part of the purchasing process, so as long as the other computers have access to this ID then copying will work fine.  It is possible if I recall correctly to have a receipt file that doesn't require even this level of authentication, and some apps once downloaded can be freely distributed regardless of where is came from - I think most devs have sorted this one out to be honest, but you sound like you are good to go with a legit download and access to the same ID.\n\nA: You can: \n\n\n*\n\n*enable the Debug menu of the App Store\n\n*Show Download Folder… \n\n*download, and perform a carefully timed copy of the download (timed to occur before the download is purged from that area). \n\n\nVolatile items in this area may include things that are installers (not the installed results of an installer).\nRelated, and not limited to Lion: Does the Lion App Store have a debug menu?\n\nAnother volatile area: \n/Library/Updates\nI'll test to figure out the relationship between the two areas. Maybe: \n\n\n*\n\n*all App Store downloads go first to the downloads folder\n\n*then downloads that will be used for updates are moved temporarily to /Library/Updates\n", "Q: How to change the color and format of the static host/path/user string in the Terminal or iTerm?

I would like to have \"cookie:~ j$\" or at least part of the string be of a different color than the rest.\nI know that I can specifically enable color coding for specific applications like ls or git, but I haven't found anything like this.\nIs there a way to change the coloring and format of the static host/path/user string in the Terminal or iTerm?\n\nA: What you are looking for us customizing the prompt in the bash shell. Many articles on the web including this one.\nThis is basically done by setting the variable PS1 e.g.\nPS1=\"\\[\\033[35m\\]\\t\\[\\033[m\\]-\\[\\033[36m\\]\\u\\[\\033[m\\]@\\[\\033[32m\\]\\h:\\[\\033[33;1m\\]\\w\\[\\033[m\\]\\$ \"\n\ngives for user mark on machine flat\n\nThis includes \\t as time, \\u as user \\h as hostname and \\w current working directory\nThe \\[ then \\octal number \\] send commands to the terminal , in this case acting as an xterm and sets the colours.\n\nA: Check out this page for instructions on how to do this\nhttp://www.macosxtips.co.uk/index_files/customising-the-terminal.php\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut stopped working in Safari 6.0 I've created a custom keyboard shortcut for entering and exiting fullscreen in the keyboard preferences menu.\nThis stopped working for Safari 6.0 after I upgraded to Mountain Lion. I had the beta version of Safari which I got from the developers' site before I upgraded and the keyboard shortcut worked on that one.\nSo, how do I get this keyboard shortcut to work with Safari again?

I recently updated to 10.8. When I had Lion Wine and Steam worked perfectly, but because of some problems I had to re-install Wine. The thing is, now that Wine is re-installed, I can't install Steam. First off, when I run the installer the console shows:\nfixme:storage:create_storagefile Storage share mode not implemented.\n\nThen, after I start the installation and press the first next, the X11 window disappears and never re-opens (believe me, I left it for half an hour and nothing happens, not that it should take more than a few seconds, but still). X11 is still running, or rather XQuartz. What is wrong and what does fixme:storage:create_storagefile Storage share mode not implemented. mean?\n\nA: How did you install Wine? When I installed Wine using Homebrew, it told me that it had problems with the new Apple llvm compiler, and said to use the old GCC compiler, and gave me a link to download and install it. I haven't tried to install Steam in Wine though, so I don't have experience with your specific problem.\n", "Q: How do I get my AirPlay mirroring to take up my entire TV screen? I have a 2011 27\" iMac that currently has Mountain Lion installed on it, and I am trying to get the AirPlay mirroring to take up my entire 1080p widescreen TV.  How do I get that to happen?\n\nA: Try setting the Match Desktop Size To setting in the AirPlay menubar item to Apple TV\n\nIf that doesn't work, it may be that AirPlay is outputting at 720p and your TV isn't scaling - perhaps try a stretch or scale mode on your TV.\n\nA: Click \"Open Display Preferences\" in the AirPlay menu (as shown above). \nSet the resolution on your TV to 1080p. \nThe key, at least in my case, and I suspect in yours, is to click \"overscan correction\", which will get that last 1~5% black border to go away. \n", "Q: Where can I buy iMovie that is compatible with SL? I just upgraded my macbook to SL and wanted to upgrade iMovie too. But the system requirement for the version available on App Store is 10.7.4 or later.

I always used to save my Chat logs because I use IM in the professional environment. Now I find that I can’t save chat logs anymore. That option is gone. Is there any workaround or hidden preference to enable saving chat logs again?\n\nA: In Preferences, select Messages and check \"Save history when conversations are closed.\" Now when you quit Messages, it will create a collection of chat transcripts. You can easily access these in your Library folder. From Finder, select Go>Go to Folder and type: ~/Library/Messages/Archive. If you are on Mavericks or Yosemite, the location is ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.iChat/Data/Library/Messages. This will take you directly to the appropriate folder.\n\nA: Please note that the new location for logs in Mavericks is ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.iChat/Data/Library/Messages (yes, even though the app is called Messages, the container is called iChat).\nThis appears to be a way of replicating the way that apps like iMessages work on iOS -- Messages gets its own Library folder with its own dedicated hierarchy of files.\nUpdate: At some point after 10.9 Mavericks and by the time of 10.15 Catalina, the real location for stored chat logs became ~/Library/Messages/Archive.\n\nA: I don't know if you are still looking for an answer to this, but it looks like you can use Automator (in Applications) to copy all files to a certain folder when items are added to the Archive Folder us \"Folder Action\".  I am trying it out now, but seems it should work.\n\nA: In addition to native Automator, if you're a Hazel or Alfred user they can give you other ways to do this on addition of a file to a folder.\n\nA: I had the same problem. \nOn my machine I resolved the problem by removing the Archive link.\nOpen Messages and send a message. Close Messages. This should now create the Archive folder. \nI copied my older chats to this new Archive folder, and everything worked for me.\ncp -r /Users//Documents/iChats/ /Users//Library/Containers/com.apple.ichat/Data/Library/Messages/Archive\n\nA: If you want the easiest, most foolproof way to do this with the most flexible format WITH images/videos/gifs/emoji/allthethings, follow along. This method contains absolutely zero automation, so even your hip grandma can follow along.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Messages app\n\n*Open the conversation you want to copy and keep scrolling to the top to load more of the conversation until you've loaded all that you want.\n\n*Select all (Cmd+A)\n\n*Copy (Cmd+C)\n\n*Open TextEdit and start a New Document\n\n*Paste (Cmd+V)\n\n\nAs you can see, all of the text and media are there, and you can edit it like any word file. Want it as a PDF? Just Export to PDF, and it won't even break pages in the middle of images and stuff (as would printing to PDF from the Messages app). Make sure you save this file somewhere before proceeding to the extra step below: resizing photos.\nIf your transcript contains gargantuan 3648x2736 images like mine do, you're going to want to reduce their size to fit in the document. This is simple: the image data is saved as part of the document. So, just...\n\n\n*\n\n*Double-click the image you want to reduce to open it in Preview\n\n*Once in Preview, select (from the menu bar) Tools > Adjust Size\n\n*By default, the Width value is selected and the dimensions are constrained (meaning changing one will adjust the other to keep it in the current Height/Width ratio) as depicted by the little locked padlock icon nearby. Enter a more sane value; I like to go with 640x480 for my images. If you're savvy, move to step 4. If you have no idea what value to enter... First make sure the little padlock icon is 'locked'. If it isn't, click on it and it should become locked. Next, select the larger of the two values (double-clicking on it will fully select), delete the value, and then enter 640. Press ENTER or click the OK button at the bottom.\n\n*Your image should now be reduced in size, and you can close the window (Cmd+W), quit (Cmd+Q), or whatever (Cmd+????????)\n\n*You should be back in your text document and the image size will have updated. Note: The one anything thing here is that TextEdit likes to scroll you all the way to the top of the document. Them's the breaks.\nThere you have it. Chat transcript archived like a boss.\n", "Q: Has anyone figured out a keyboard shortcut to globally strikethrough selected text in any OS X app? We have ⌘B to bold, ⌘I to italicise, ⌘U to underline, but we don't (as far as I can tell) have a shortcut to strikethrough selected text in any OS X rich editor. \nI added a keyboard shortcut into System Preferences, but that way doesn't work very consistently. I also tried using TextExpander, but it doesn't support rich text formatting.\nHas anyone come up with a way to do this?\n\nA: Shortcuts created in System Preferences will only work globally with applications that have matching Strikethrough options in their menu. This is not a feature that all rich text editors provide, thus the inconsistencies you experienced.\nNevertheless, TextExpander does support rich text formatting. When creating a new snippet click the \"Content\" header above the snippet and select \"Formatted Text, Pictures.\" You could use this to store a small sample of strikethrough text to use the formatting of. This is sort of a painful workaround, but it should suffice in the majority of applications. You will probably encounter a few exceptions where this will not work.\nThe simplest solution is built into Mountain Lion. Select any text in a rich text editor and CTRL+Click (right-click) on it. Select the Font>Styles\n\nA new menu pops up. Select \"Favorite Styles\" and then select \"Struck through\" from the drop down menu. Now click Apply. \n\nYour text will now be struck through. Keep in mind this Font menu may not appear in all rich text editors and others may not display struck through text at all.\n\nA: an even quicker way is to use the upper left corner with with the little drop down menu with the paragraph symbol. \n\n\nA: Here's an AppleScript that automatically opens the Font panel, applies the strikethrough and closes the font panel, in less than a second.\nYou can edit the number in the line \"tell menu 2\" to \"tell menu 3\" to get double strikethrough. With \"tell menu 1\" you can remove a strikethrough.\nI've created a Macro Group for Stickies in Keyboard Maestro, and have one macro of the following code to apply the strikethrough, and one to remove it.\n\nApplescript:\nset theBundle to ((path to library folder from system domain as string) & \"Frameworks:AppKit.framework:\") as «class furl»\nset fonts_loc to localized string \"Fonts\" from table \"FontManager\" in bundle theBundle\n\ntry\n    with timeout of 5 seconds\n        tell application \"System Events\"\n            tell (first application process whose frontmost is true)\n                if not (exists window fonts_loc) then\n                    keystroke \"t\" using command down -- show fonts window\n                end if\n                repeat until exists window fonts_loc\n                    delay 0.1\n                end repeat\n                tell window fonts_loc to tell toolbar 1 to tell group 3\n                    tell menu button 1\n                        click it\n                        repeat until exists menu 1\n                            delay 0.1\n                        end repeat\n                        tell menu 2\n                            -- number of menu item --> {\"None\", \"Simple\", \"Double\", missing value, \"Color\"}\n                            click menu item 1\n                        end tell\n                    end tell -- menu button 1\n                end tell -- window…\n                keystroke \"t\" using command down -- hide fonts window\n            end tell -- process\n        end tell -- \"System Events\"\n    end timeout\nend try\n\n\nA: Hey I just came across this question because today I just started to use Stickies as a To-Do list for things I need to finish over the day and I also wanted to have that feature that you strikethrough items or text you are done with…\nI think an easy workaround for this is that you have lets say 3 items, then you go to mark your first item with the strikethrough from the Fonts panel and then select that all the item and go to Font > Copy Style (Opt+Cmd+C) and then because it is copied in the Stickies app, after, anytime you use the shortcut Opt+Cmd+V (Paste Style) over a selected item it will paste the strikethrough style anytime later on the app, even if you have any other copied item in your clipboard.\n\nA: Cmd+Shift+X works in MS Excel for Mac 2011.\n\nA: You can cross through individual characters in Safari and other Mac docs by:\n1 In Safari (or other) Toolbar, Click 'Edit' > 'Special Characters'\n2 In pop-up's 'Search' box type: \"combining long stroke overlay\" and click on the '-' that   comes up under the 'Unicode' heading at the bottom of the central column in the box\n3 Click 'Add to Favourites' box\n4 The Special Characters pop-up can be left open and dragged to a convenient area of the screen whilst completing Safari docs etc (I use it for writing foreign language rules in Quizlet). Type the character you wish to show crossed out, then double click the '-' character in the Favourites section of the pop-up to strike through\n\nA: This one's what I do as a workaround.\n\n\n*\n\n*Write a \"struck-through text\" on Word.\n\n*Copy and paste that \"struck-through text\" to the sticky note.\n\n*Format the newly pasted \"struck-through text\" the way you want on your\nsticky note.\n\n*Select the \"struck-through text\" and click Opt+Cmd+C (or click Font >\ncopy style)\n\n*Highlight the item you want to strike through.\n\n*Click Opt+Cmd+V (or click Font > paste style)\n\n\nTedious at first but works fine after.\n:)\n\nA: Shortcut key is ⌘ Cmd+Shift+X. \n\nA: I just had the same problem and figured out you could if you went to the side bar (the format tab in Pages) and then clicked on character styles then held down strikethrough and liked shortcut you could set F1–F9 as shortcuts for the strikethrough effect!\n", "Q: Contextual Menu Keyboard Shortcuts Is it possible to create a keyboard shortcut for a contextual menu item and if so, how? I'm not sure if this functionality was available in Lion, but if it wasn't, maybe it is in Mountain Lion. \n\nA: You can set shortcuts for some context shortcuts, specifically anything that's a service. Most app-specific context menu items aren't services (although some, such as services to modify a file in a particular app are), so they can't be assigned shortcuts. So it depends which items you want a shortcut for, but it's doable.\nTo add a shortcut for a service, open Keyboard Preferences, click the Keyboard Shortcuts tab, and select Services in the left pane. Then look for the context menu item you want in the right pane, click it and you'll get an option to set a shortcut.\n", "Q: Connection timeout when sharing internet with password I have a MacBook Pro with Mountain Lion 10.8.

Ad-hoc Wi-Fi only supports WEP for encryption on Lion and earlier. You can’t use WPA2 to encrypt an ad-hoc Wi-Fi network unless you are running Mountain Lion.\nEdit: I see that you are using channel 36, that means 5GHz Wi-Fi.

I have a a Mac Pro that has my actual iTunes library, but I have full access to it from my iPhone, MBP, AppleTV, etc.\nIt's not free, but it's a pretty significant service IMHO.  I think it's probably the most elegant solution :)\nOk, so your best bet is probably going to be the external HD.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure iTunes is closed on the iMac.\n\n*With your external HD plugged into your iMac, move the entire iTunes folder (~/Music/iTunes) to wherever you want on the external\n\n*Start iTunes while holding down the option key.  This will allow you to tell iTunes where to look for the iTunes Library.

I'm trying to create an Automator Service that will act on selected text, converting dashes to spaces, and also making word caps for all the text.\nA friend gave me this python script (I know nothing about python or shell scripting):\n#! /usr/bin/python\n\ncliptext = \"%clipboard\"\nprint cliptext.replace('-', ' ').replace('%', ' ').replace('&', ' and ').replace('#', ' ').title()\n\nIt works great as a TextExpander snippet, but I'd like to have it available in the Services menu as well. I don't need it to use any specific scripting language, it just needs to run within Automator. My coding buddy had no experience with Automator so he couldn't help out. His script requires copying the text to the clipboard, and then runs the formatting and pastes the result. I'd like to be able to just run this on the selected text and not have to deal with the Clipboard (at least manually).\nThe particular use for this is to rename photo uploads on Flickr, since Flickr uses the filename to generate the photo name. When exporting artwork via Photoshop or Illustrator using Save For Web, the lowercase and dashes are my default settings. I want to be able to highlight the Flickr title, and then run the Service to reformat the file name to a properly formatted title.\n\nA: This isn't too difficult to do, you just need to know the right magic.

This is because every time I plug in my Ethernet cable my IRC client automatically reconnects over wired, and then when I disconnect the cable it reconnects me on wireless. \nSo now I have multiple users logged into IRC.\nCan I force an app to use a certain connection over the others? I like having the wired connection as the primary connection over wireless, because I do a lot of uploading and downloading and the NIC card gets hot sometimes. I guess I should of stated I'm using a MacBook Pro. \n\nA: Add a static route for your irc server. For example I have 2 interfaces: wired (en0) and WiFi (en1) of which the wired one is the default.

(.app) Is there a better QuickLook plugin than the built-in for quicklooking applications?\nSomething that would show more of the info define in Foobar./Contents/Info.plist, like version number and bundle identifier for example would be ideal.\n\nA: Simple answer, no.\nMore complex answer is still no, but that doesn't mean it can't be done (Late Night Software's Script Debugger overrides the default QuickLook viewer for applications (com.apple.application) but you as the user don't see any difference).\nThere are a few sites around such as Quick Look Plugins and QLPlugins that offer plugins (.qlgenerator files), however there are none that enable more information on .app files to be shown.\nThe qlgenerator that does the job is StandardBundles.qlgenerator and is found in the /System/Library/QuickLook/ folder which is OSX's base folder for all QuickLook plugins that are OSX base types such as applications, Text files or Emails.\nIt provides the QuickLook functionality for the following base file \"types\".\n\n\n*\n\n*com.apple.application (base type for ALL OSX application)\n\n*com.apple.systempreference.prefpane (Preference Pane files naturally)\n\n\nAny replacement plugin would have to provide all the functionality of the existing plugin, in this case the Preference Pane quick look functionality.\nPlugins live in 4 different places, and the order in which plugins are preferred is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Inside an application bundle - an application specific QuickLook plugin usually used to provide QuickLook functionality for bespoke file types\n\n*~/Library/QuickLook - your user plugins (does't exist until created by the user)\n\n*/Library/QuickLook - your mac's system wide application plugins\n\n*/System/Library/QuickLook - your mac's system wide Apple base type plugins\n\n\nOverriding the system default behaviour for .app can therefore be done with the following caveats:\n\n\n*\n\n*If another application also provides QuickLook functionality for the\ntype (com.apple.application) and it appears higher in the\nhierarchy (1 highest, 4 lowest) then it will be used instead.\n\n*Apple do state in the QuickLook developer documentation that\nfor each of the above levels of hierarchy, if more\nthan one plugin is found for a specific type (e.g.\ncom.apple.application) then only the first one is used and you have no control over which one under normal circumstances except by forcing QuickLook to use a specific plugin using qlmanage -g\nSo yes it can be done, but nothing currently exists in the public domain that provides this functionality and therefore something would have to be written bespoke to provide it.\nIf it was implemented, using it has it's issues since it would be for an OS X base type... so replacing the base type is not a good idea; the priority of the plugins is not fixed and you cannot be sure that the plugin would actually be the one to run.\n", "Q: Moving Application to other folder I just upgraded from Snow Leopard to Mountain Lion. Now when I open my application folder via the Dock there are different programs present, e.g. Automator, which I moved to the \"Utilities\" sub-folder on Snow Leopard.\nIf I try to move them again to the sub-folder I get the message that the application cannot be moved to this sub-folder since the sub-folder cannot be changed.\n\nA: You can still do something like sudo mv /Applications/DVD\\ Player.app /Applications/Utilities/.\nI ran into several issues after moving applications on 10.6. For example Console crashed on launch, even though that stopped happening on 10.7. And OS upgrades will add duplicate applications at the original locations as in your case.\n\nA: I \"solved\" the problem by performing a clean installation of Snow Leopard and upgrade to Mountain Lion afterwards. Maybe this is not the most common way but now I don't have duplicated apps. Furthermore, I'll leave the apps where they are now and don't care that much about it anymore.\n", "Q: Is there a way to completely disable Dock? I want the Dock completely gone.  I haven't used it in the past three releases of OS X (10.5 to present).  I want it completely gone, and LaunchBar there instead.  Is there a way to kill the Dock so that it does not load or run?\n\nA: You can change icons size to 1px using:\ndefaults write com.apple.dock tilesize -float 1; killall Dock\nTo restore it to usable size:\ndefaults write com.apple.dock tilesize -float 64; killall Dock\nOr simply open System Preferences and change the Dock size there.\nThere's a downside though, you can't quickly inspect the Dock if you need to, without changing the size back.\n\nA: The Dock process on OS X is responsible for more than just the actual Dock on your screen. It does a bunch of background stuff, including Dashboard. Most notably, the Finder won't function properly if the Dock process isn't running, so turning it off completely is pretty much a no-go without breaking OS X in the process.\nThe best I can suggest is keeping the dock hidden, and make the size as small as possible so you're less likely to trigger it.\nYou can also position it where it's least likely to get in the way - as you probably know, you can put it on the left, right or bottom of your screen. But you can also pin it to a particular corner, just use the defaults write com.apple.dock pinning -string start command. Type that command in Terminal (replace start with end to change which corner it goes in, or middle to go back to the default), then killall Dock to restart the Dock and apply the change.\n\nA: This answer doesn't really add that much to what is already here, but I felt that the answers offering solutions for hiding it lacked some information.\nI personally use uBar and I've used the following set of terminal commands without any issues. I can only confirm that I've used these without any issues since El Capitan. I can't remember further than that for sure.\nTo be clear, this only hides Dock, so that you will never have to deal with it accidentally popping up.\nFor those who don't know, these lines of code should be run in Terminal. It can be found here: /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app. Just open Terminal and paste in the lines and press enter.\n# Hide Dock\ndefaults write com.apple.dock autohide -bool true && killall Dock\ndefaults write com.apple.dock autohide-delay -float 1000 && killall Dock\ndefaults write com.apple.dock no-bouncing -bool TRUE && killall Dock\n\n# Restore Dock\ndefaults write com.apple.dock autohide -bool false && killall Dock\ndefaults delete com.apple.dock autohide-delay && killall Dock\ndefaults write com.apple.dock no-bouncing -bool FALSE && killall Dock\n\n\nYou can run each line separately as well.\n\nExplanation on what each line does:\n\n\n*\n\n*First line turns on autohide\n\n\n*\n\n*As someone mentioned, Cmd+Alt+D still toggles Dock visibility just like before. This is useful if you need to assign application to a specific space. Using the Dock is the only way (AFAIK).\n\n\n*By default when Dock autohide is on, hovering over the edge where it sits shows the Dock pretty much immediately. This line Makes the hover delay 1000 seconds, making it pretty much impossible to accidentally show dock if you happen to hover over the edge. You'd have to let it sit there for ~17 minutes.\n\n*This removes the bounce animation that happens when applications want your attention or when an application is launching. I've noticed that depending on the Dock icon size, they may peak from the edge when they start bouncing. This gets rid of that issue.\n\n\nkillall Dock at the end of each line forces Dock to quit and then it restores itself automatically. This is to basically load the new settings. It's only necessary to run killall Dock after the very last line, but this way it's easier to run the lines separately if necessary ...and in bulk it really makes no difference.\n\nA: To double click an icon and toggle the behaviour. using @Jonas code -Thanks!\nI saved the following into a file named Toggle_Dock then ran sudo chmod +x Toggle_Dock which might have not been needed. Now I can just use the icon to toggle the dock.\n# Check if dock is hidden\nif [[ \"$(defaults read com.apple.dock autohide)\" -eq \"1\" ]]; then\n  # Restore Dock\n  defaults write com.apple.dock autohide -bool false && killall Dock\n  defaults delete com.apple.dock autohide-delay && killall Dock\n  defaults write com.apple.dock no-bouncing -bool FALSE && killall Dock\n  exit\nfi\n# Hide Dock\ndefaults write com.apple.dock autohide -bool true && killall Dock\ndefaults write com.apple.dock autohide-delay -float 1000 && killall Dock\ndefaults write com.apple.dock no-bouncing -bool TRUE && killall Dock\n\n\nA: This article from Lifehacker.com.au suggests setting the Dock autohide delay to 1000 seconds, like so:\ndefaults write com.apple.dock autohide-delay -float 1000; killall Dock\n\nTo restore the default behavior:\ndefaults delete com.apple.dock autohide-delay; killall Dock\n\nThe author says he sets the delay to two seconds, so he can still get to the Dock in those rare cases when it's needed.\n", "Q: ios devices screen overview I am really reckless and just dropped my ipod touch second time in past year and the screen is broken, I am not very keen on trying to replace it with flat fee, bacause I am sure it would happen again, what i want to ask is how resilient are the screens of iphone devices : iphone 3gs or iphone 4s, I am not sure about 3gs but it is fairly cheap where I live and 4s is too expensive howeever I already have shelved a lot of money trying to replace my ipod touch, I have a two year old wp7 device which is showing it's age so can anyone suggest a screen comparison, or buying a conver , protector is the last resort.\n\nA: The strength of the screen was greatly improved in the 4s.

It will unpack and install the new one, copy the settings, save games, etc. then remove the old one. Even if you only remove the app binaries (program code) prior to installing the new code and not the user data, you run the risk of getting a bad download or corrupt compression and not having a valid program for the user to run.\nSo, the reason you can't install is that iOS needs some scratch space to decompress the file, and will almost certainly have a large portion of both versions on disk at some point. And I believe iOS also needs a bit of breathing room, so I suspect the app updater program has fairly conservative limits on how much free space it needs when installing something.\nUnless you don't have any saved games or other data that you want to keep, I would recommend not deleting then installing the new version, but rather try to free up some other space by deleting apps or media that you can replace.\n", "Q: Where did Icon Composer go from Xcode?

I'm trying to create a project folder for some woodworking I will be doing over the next few weeks. Among the first items into this folder is a collection of ~25 emails containing photos and measurements of components on a similar project.  \nIs there a quick way to copy each of these emails to a specific folder rather than copy/paste'ing the contents of each one?\n\nA: If the photos and measurements are attachments you could use Automator to download the selected messages to a folder.\n\n\nEdit: I wrote this AppleScript that will download the message and the attachments for all the selected emails in Mail.

Is there a way to check if it is enabled from the command line?.\n\nA: You actually can find out if the Do Not Disturb is currently enabled or disabled.  Notification Center drops a plist in the following location that you can read the value of.\nRun the following to find the plist file:\nls ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.notificationcenterui.*.plist\n\nNow, you can read the value from the plist you just found by using:\ndefaults read ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.notificationcenterui.8D3EA20D-8D7F-52E2-9F99-BC17A13A3F0E.plist\n\nNOTE: your actual filename may be different than what I have listed above.\nYou will see a key called \"doNotDisturb\" and it will either have a value of 1 or 0 (enabled or disabled)\nYou can also change it's status by doing:\ndefaults write ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.notificationcenterui.8D3EA20D-8D7F-52E2-9F99-BC17A13A3F0E.plist doNotDisturb 1\n\nor:\ndefaults write ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.notificationcenterui.8D3EA20D-8D7F-52E2-9F99-BC17A13A3F0E.plist doNotDisturb 0\n\nTo make the change take effect, you'll need to restart Notification Center by typing:\nkillall NotificationCenter\n\nI've actually written a very simple Automator script so now I can enable/disable the Do Not Disturb for Notification Center with a keyboard shortcut.  Very handy. :)\n\nA: To get the Do not disturb status in Yosemite, just enter the following in your terminal:\ndefaults read ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.notificationcenterui.plist doNotDisturb\n\n\nA: Setting of the Notification center is stored in the ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost folder, which means it's a machine-specific settings.\nYou can use defaults -currentHost command to read the settings within. -currentHost is used to specify the ByHost setting not the common user specific one stored in ~/Library/Preferences.\ndefaults -currentHost read com.apple.notificationcenterui doNotDisturb\n\nOutput value 1 means it's activated, 0 for disabled.\nIn fact, the above command is reading options from ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.notificationcenterui.<your-UUID>.plist file.\nCaveats: Setting ByHost options with defaults -currentHost write doesn't work. The options are indeed written into the file, but it's not reloaded by the corresponding daemon. I guess this is a bug.\nReferences\n\n\n*\n\n*Modifying plist in ByHost folder.\n\n*ByHost doesn't work: Config Profiles on ByHost Plists\n\nA: Probably the best way I can think of is to install terminal notifier and send it a message from the terminal. \nInstall Terminal Notifier\nTerminal notifier can be installed through Ruby Gems \nType: \nsudo gem install terminal-notifier\nSend NC a message\nType: \nterminal-notifier -message \"The notification center is running\" -title \"NC Status\"\nIf notification center is running you'll get a message that says \"The notification center is running\"\n\nA: At the moment, the ways to interact with Notification Center programmatically (including via the command line) are pretty limited. As InfluenceJamie noted, there's terminal-notifier, which allows you to send notifications from the command line, but sending notifications is pretty much all programs can do at the moment. From my reading of the developer documentation, programs can only send and get information about the specific notifications they send, no status information for Notifcation Center itself, or other notifications. There's also no Applescript interface.\nSo at the moment, you're limited to manually testing whether a notification goes through, as InfluenceJamie suggested, or hoping that someone figures out Apple's private APIs and makes a command line interface.\n", "Q: If I uninstall or delete Sparrow, will Mail files be left on my Mac? If I delete Sparrow set up to use gmail via imap, does Sparrow have any local mail files? Or is everything on the server?\nI.e., if I uninstall sparrow, can I delete all Sparrow directories safely?\n\nA: In general, you probably want to use something like CleanApp for this, but for Sparrow you can actually get this form the App itself.\nIn the Help menu on Sparrow, you'll see a couple of items \"Show Log Folder\" and \"Show Data Folder\". The latter is the local cache of your emails, the former may or may not actually do anything (e.g. if Sparrow's not generated any logs).\nThere are a few other small files around the place (like preferences), but that Data folder is probably the only one big enough to worry about (e.g. mine is ~1.3 GB). The preferences/etc will likely be a few kB; again, something like CleanApp is what you should be using if you're that fanatical about removing files (;\nBear in mind that if you're using Sparrow for POP3 mail, and deleting emails off the server, this might be your only copy of said emails (i.e. if you don't have another client or another account hosting them).\n\nA: best to remove accounts first from the sparrow preferences tab! I switched to airmail :)\n", "Q: Get disk temperature in terminal Is there a command I can use just to get the hard disk temperature in the terminal?\nIs this possible without a third party app?\n\nA: Without add on software there is no command to get the disk temperature, after:\nbrew install smartmontools\n\nOne can run the following command o retrieve de disk temperature:\n$ smartctl -a disk0 | grep Temperature\n194 Temperature_Celsius     0x0022   044   044   000    Old_age   Always       -       56 (Min/Max 17/70)\n\n\nA: Note: The tool isn't available any longer, and the replacement hasn't been updated since 2014 (and doesn't seem to work on recent versions of macOS).\n\nUnfortunately you won't be able to do this without a third party app. However, if you're happy to use a third party software it is possible to get the temperature in terminal.\nYou can temperature monitor, which is a free application and provides a command line option. The ins and outs of using the software may be a bit much to go into here, but you can find all the instructions here.\n\nA: You could try Smartmontools (S.M.A.R.T. Monitoring Tools) which has a command-line app. Most (if not all?) hard drives will report their temperature in the S.M.A.R.T. report.\nThere's also a native GUI SMARTReporter app which lets you perform certain actions based on temperature, if that's what you're after (and also happens to include the smartctl command-line binary — though if you're just after the binary you should, as a rule, get it from the \"original\" developers, just to be safe!).\n\nA: Apple doesn’t program that sensor directly for command line access.\nYou will only be able to get a temperature reading if there is a sensor. This article explains how you can get this information via the ioreg command.\nThis one-liner worked for me to get the GPU temperature (unfortunately I was not able to see any other IOHWSensors on my machine):\necho $(($(ioreg -c IOHWSensor | grep \"current-value\" | grep -oE [0-9]+) / 65536))\n\n\nA: iStat Menus shows a lot of detailed information about the running state of the system, including all temperature sensors.\n", "Q: How to stream my video files from the cloud? I use Dropbox to backup all my important files, but I'm running out of storage space on my computer.\nMany of the files are video files that take up the majority of my storage, and it's not imperative that they're stored on my computer.\nIs there a way to configure Dropbox so some selected files (in my case the videos) are stored in the cloud so I can stream the videos when I need to watch them, but otherwise they don't take up space on my local drive?\nOr is there an alternative cloud service that provides this functionality?\n\nA: You could try Jungle Disk. It's a pay service, but it gets you what you want - a locally mountable cloud drive. It can store data locally as well, like Dropbox, but you can configure it as an archive, with no local storage used. It uses Amazon S3 or Rackspace as the backend storage, so you pay a $3/month fee, plus an amount per GB per month.\nI believe there are similar services out there, and you can just use S3 directly and get something like Panic's Transmit to mount the S3 storage as a local volume.\n\nA: Try Bitcasa, which is currently in beta and free. It will be 10$/month when the beta ends. It gives you unlimited storage. All music and video files you store on the cloud are streamed to you rather than downloaded. You can delete a folder from your HD once it is synced to Bitcasa. It will remain there until you delete it from the app.\n\nA: Maybe give mediafire a go, it gives you everything you want and you don't have to pay for it, you get 50GB storage for free instead of the 2GB dropbox gives you. (Just a note, I'm not affiliated with these guys in any way, just think 50 gigs free storage is awesome.)\n\nA: Well. Base on my current experiences using Jolicloud OS (http://jolicloud.com), which features a fully operational linux based personalized distribution/operating system and web apps such as Google Chrome/Chromium-Browser web application, and full access to your virtual desktop via web browser, it is possible yes.\nHave a look at this: Access your Dropbox from the JoliCloud Desktop\nBasically, what Jolicloud does is to link your current Dropbox account into your JoliOS service/system, after which you can gain access to your file's list (and only the list itself) and choose which of these files you wish to download/preview, etc.\nFrom the site:\n\nSome media files like music, photos and videos can be accessed\n  directly inside Jolicloud. This feature depends on the HTML5 audio and\n  video codecs installed in your browser. If you are using Joli OS, make\n  sure to install the HTML5 Video add-on to preview media files.\n\nIllustrations from the JoliOS Blog:\n\n\n\nThis way you won't spend your disk space in storing locally your Dropbox Files/Folders but you can choose when to use them. The next screenshot is from my desktop, which is JoliOS 1.2 Installed on a 8GB SD Card running in a HP Pavilion dm4 WITHOUT Hard Disk Drive, and where you can see that my Dropbox Capacity is 11.8GB (much more than my SD Card) and in the next screenshot you will see my current SD Card available storage which is yet 2.3 GB and running like a charm.\n\n\nThe same behavior is applied to Google Drive.\nI can't say for sure how are the JoliOS achieving this features but this wide opens the possibilities for creating new services for the Dropbox Cloud Storage.\nThe richest feature on the JoliCloud Service is that you can gain access to your Joli's account from technically everywhere. Only Internet and an updated web browser is required.\nGood luck!\n\nA: Just gave BitCasa a go and it's my new favourite, this actually works alot like dropbox but allows you to stream online, and storage is virtually unlimited.

But after I upgraded my OS to Mountain Lion, it seems like Houdini is not working correctly. So I deleted Houdini.\nBut now it seems like my files and folders in Finder are distorted (see image below). I'm not sure if this because of Houdini or because of Mountain Lion bugs.\n\nI already tried sort by name, it sorted at the moment. But when I reopened the same folder, the file back distorted.\nHow can I fix it?\n\nA: The files are not \"distorted\"; they just are not arranged in rows.

Since there's a lot of apps that support Growl, and only a handful have been updated yet, I'd like to know if there's a way to convert those Growl notifications into Notification Centre notifications.\ne.g. some kind of add-on for Growl or a 'proxy' of sorts so that the notifications all come through ML's Notification Centre.\n\nA: Sure is.\nHiss is an app that takes the place of Growl to catch Growl notifications and reroute them to the Notification Center.\nOne limitation of Hiss, however, is it displays all notifications as coming from Growl, rather than the application that actually generated them.\n\nA: In the 2.0 version of the Growl SDK, we introduce Notification Center support. If Growl is not running, the app will post directly to Notification Center. If Growl is running, it's assumed the user wants Growl, and the app will post to Growl.\nHere's the fun part.\nIn Growl 2 there will be a big switch that you can turn to on, to turn on NC support in Growl 2. The way it works is that any app that has the 2.0 version of the framework will be notified that the switch is enabled. Those apps will send to both Growl and Notification Center.\nIf this switch in Growl is enabled, then the visual notifications portion of Growl will be grayed out and you cannot use them. However, actions will work. So you can send notifications to Prowl/Boxcar/MailMe/etc etc and have Notification Center be the visual notifications.\n\nA: In the interim here is another method to forward Growl to Notification Center:\nhttps://github.com/stigi/MountainGrowl\nNotifications are still shown as coming from Growl rather than the originating app. In use, it's a bit easier to deal with than Hiss, which seems buggy at present.\n\nA: Since version 2.0, Growl supports \"bubbling\" notifications to the Notification Center out of the box. You can find the setting for this in the General tab of Growl's preferences.\n\nIt does come with the same limitations as Hiss though, all notifications appear to be coming from Growl and not the originating app, and clicking them does not appear to launch the expected actions.\n", "Q: Battery warning \"Service Battery\" goes away by itself I got the \"service battery\" message when clicking on the power indicator of my MBP the other day, only my battery appears to be fine. Then today, it's gone away by itself, I haven't taken it in for a service but now it shows battery condition normal...?\nAnybody else experience this or have any idea why this would happen.\n\nA: I believe this is fairly common behaviour. You may want to calibrate your MacBook Pro's battery to help Mac OS X better gauge its health.\nI have a MacBook with an older battery.

I saw multiple videos that the iPhone 4 screen can not be scratched by keys, coins and is even quite resistant to dropping. What are the drawbacks to adding this layer of protection (in general or perhaps for a specific film you have used) so I can weigh whether I wish to use one?\n\nA: In the end, the worth of a case/screen protector is entirely up to you.\nThe iPhone 4/4S screen is incredibly durable, and without a protector, I've had mine since the release of the 4S and it's only got the smallest micro-buffs in the screen (you really have to be looking at them to see it).\nI'd say the only real good reason for protection of any kind is to protect your device from drops. Being that they're a specially treated glass, if you drop it from a sizeable distance, they'll more than likely shatter.\n\nA: Apple made big improvements with the latest iPhone screens. I've had the iPhone 4s since for a while now (since it came out) and I'm notoriously hard on my phones, but the screen still looks as good as new. Personally I find the plastic screen covers just annoying, they always come off and they're a pain to apply. Hope that helps.\n\nA: I've been using a transparent protector since I had my first iPhone (4 years ago) and I can only recommend it. If you buy a decent one, you won't even notice it's there.\nI agree Apple has made a lot of improvements on the durability of the iPhones, but the protectors has always kept my iPhones next to brand new (which has come handy when I sold my iPhone).\nAnd these days, you can buy 10 protectors for less then $10, so in my opinion, this is a very small amount to pay to keep my iPhone scratch-less. \n\nA: I agree that screen protectors are quite necessary, but not only for just resisting scratches.  The ones I have used for years (ScreenGuardz) have an anti-glare feature which is nice to have in bright situations and they are less prone to collecting fingerprints all over the screen.\nThe decent ones cost a bit more (still inexpensive) but are still worth it.  Here's the ScreenGuardz link...\nScreenGuardz - iPhone\nCheck for them on eBay though, they might have new ones for cheaper.  ;)\nBut, if you have already picked up scratches on your touch screen panel, then make sure to use the right buffing agent for your specific screen to work out the scratches.  Touch screen panels vary in their composition (Glass, Acrylic, Gorilla Glass, etc.) so be sure you use the right one.  These guys have a line of buffing compounds specifically for mobile device touch panels so you might look them up...\nTDI-LLC Technology - Glass, Acrylic, and Gorilla Glass Compounds\n", "Q: How can I connect Linux server with Applescript using iTerm or Terminal? I want to connect and run bash script on Linux server automatically by using Applescript and iTerm or Terminal on OS X.\nHow can I connect Linux server with Applescript use iTerm or Terminal?\n\nA: Applescript\nYou can execute shell commands directly from Applescript\ndo shell script \"ssh user@linuxbox command-to-run\"\n\nAutomator\nYou can create a new workflow and insert the necessary shell commands into the \"Execute shell script\" action.\n\nA: Depending on what you're doing with that AppleScript, you might be over-specifying the solution. (On the other hand, I might be over-simplifying the solution.) If you don't need too much done, I suggest you create a new profile within iTerm. \nGo into iTerm's preferences and click on the Profiles tab. Create a copy of your default profile (cmd-=) or whatever other profile you want to use. In that copy, under the General tab, in the Command section, make sure the radio button is set to Command (instead of the default \"Login shell\"). For the command, type ssh <server_name> <command>. If there's output you want to see, click on the Session tab and make sure the \"Automatically close a session when it ends\" checkbox is unchecked. \nThat should be it. From within iTerm, you can open that profile by hitting cmd-o and choosing it or, under the profile's General settings, you can assign it a shortcut key so that you'll never need to open the Profiles dialog.\n", "Q: Some information about an extra SSD drive in MacBook Pro I have a MacBook Pro (6,2; mid 2010; 4GB DDR3, 2,66 i7) And for a while now, I've been thinking about building in a SSD in my Mac.   \nMy first plan was to switch my 512GB drive with a 512GB SSD, but the prices of those things made me think again.\nThen I learned about OptiBay, a company which allows you to switch your optical drive with a secondary hard drive.\nSo I came up with the plan to switch my drive with a 128GB SSD where I'll install Mountain Lion on and by so keeping my 512GB drive for all the data. \nBut the world of SSD is fairly new to me. So I've got some questions for those who are more familiar with this topic.\n\n\n*\n\n*Which method would you use to switch the drive with the SSD? (OptiBay,...)\n\n*I heard some rumors about the performance of the SSD, something about limited times you could read/write the drive. Are those rumors true?\n\n*Is there a way to recover my optical drive and use it as an external drive (I think OptiBay offers such a way)\n\n*When will I gain the most performance gain? Installing only my OS on my SSD or when I install all my extra software on the SSD as well? Or which combination will give me the most performance gain?\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Crucial. They've got a 4.5-star average review out of 810 reviews on Amazon. Further, their 128GB model only sets you back $104.97.\n\n*OptiBay is the only option I've heard of for this type of modification, and I have yet to read anything negative about it.\n\n*I've never heard any such rumor, and I've actually gone and installed the 256GB variant of that same Crucial drive I linked in my own 2011 17\" MacBook Pro with nothing but outstanding results.\n\n*This post at MacRumors would go along with your idea to use an enclosure from OptiBay:\n\n\n\nFirst, I ordered a kit from Optibay, you can google their site. The\n  base kit comes with the \"frame\" for the SSD to fit into your Macbook\n  Pro, as well as a USB enclosure for a slot load SuperDrive. The cost\n  of the kit is $99, a bit pricey, but it was well worth it and came\n  with the enclosure.\n\n5.As far as performance is concerned, you're gonna find the most bang for your buck by installing the operating system on the SSD for sure, as well as any apps that you find yourself using most often.\n\nA: *\n\n*The OptiDrive and similar products work very well. I have the similar Date Doubler (OWC) installed in my 2009 Mac Mini and am very pleased. The combination of the fast but small SSD and still having the larger but slower HDD is the best you can do until prices come down. Optical media is passé, as you can see by Apple now systematically dropping it from its product line, and you can easily get by with only an external drive for occasional use.\n\n*Yes there's a limit on the number of write cycles on an SSD but it is mitigated by the firmware on newer drives which have complex \"wear levelling\" algorithms (basically evenly distributing writes across the disk to reduce wear) and most (though not all, check the drive specs) manufacturers ship drives with about 10% \"hidden\" reserve space that gets put into operation as bad blocks fail (so called over-provisioning.) Further more there are some measures you can take yourself to limit writes to disk, such as the mounting your drive with the noatime option (see\"Optimizing MacOS X Lion for SSD\") which will tell the OS not to update (write) the accessed time every time you read a file.\n\n*Yes OWS sells an enclosure that will take a mac Superdrive. I'm sure others can be found also.\n\n*You will get the most performance gain putting everything on SSD, obviously. However, this is not always practical. You may have large files (e.g. VMWare images) or large collection of files (e.g. iTunes folder) that take up an inordinate amount of space on the SSD. Personally I put everything on the SSD and then create links for those directories (Movies, Pictures, Music) to the internal HDD. Applications I recommend keeping on the SSD no matter how large because of the performance boost.\n\n\nOne more recommendation: when choosing an SSD do a thorough search on the internet regarding OSX compatibility. Some SSD drives do not support SATA-III speeds on OSX and yet others require a firmware update to do so. I've seen even hardcore tech nerds get bitten by that one.\n", "Q: How to restore default Mountain Lion font distribution? Deleting windows font which were copied from my bootcamp partition\nI'd like to clean the installed font list because there might be a lot to deactivate by hand.\nIs there a way to confirm which fonts do not originate from a Mountain Lion default installation?\n\nA: Starting in Lion, Apple added a Restore Standard Fonts… command to Font Book. Open Font Book and choose File > Restore Standard Fonts…:\n\n\nA: Unfortunately, there may not be a way to do it automatically, but here is a list of fonts that are included in Mountain Lion.\nAlso, once you get them all restored, you can use a font manager to help you organize your fonts. This will allow you to \"group\" your fonts, and install and uninstall whole groups in one step. Google \"font manager mac\", and you'll get some options.\n", "Q: Editing contacts creates a duplicate I have 5 different email accounts: iCloud, GMail, Hotmail and two others which my iPhone does not give the option to sync its contacts. \nSo, I have only synced my contacts with iCloud and since barely a month ago, when I edit a contact it appears immediately a copy of it and if I delete one, both of the are deleted.\nDoes anyone know what is going on?\n\nA: Does the duplicate appear on your iPhone or within your iCloud account. \nTry editing your iPhone contacts directly via this tool for example:\nhttp://www.copytrans.net/iphone-contacts.php\nAlso, where do you edit the contact entries from which the duplicates result - on your iPhone or within the iCloud. I would assume that if you are editing them on the iPhone, a temporary local copy is created on your iPhone until it is synced back to the iCloud after which the duplicate copy (physically residing on your iPhone) will be gone. \n", "Q: Should I run Parallels off of my SSD or my internal HD? I have an internal SSD running Mountain Lion and my apps and an internal 5400 rpm drive with most of my other data (pictures, movies, music). I've put my Parallels (using version 7) virtual machine files on my non-SSD drive so that Mac OS is running off the SSD and Parallels is running on the non-SSD. I use Parallels primarily for development using Visual Studio and I was just wondering if it would be better to put my virtual machine files on the SSD or if that would slow down both the Mac OS and the virtual machine?\n\nA: I put it on my SSD, like all other apps.  I think the advice to put it on a separate drives is for when you only have hard drives - 5400rpm at that (slooow).  With Visual Studio being so slow (been using it for years), it can certainly use the speed boost.  Mind you, I just set up my iMac on Friday and set up Parallels this morning, but so far, so good.  Windows apps are running very fast, and so are Mac apps.\n\nA: In general, it's best to place the operating system and all the apps that you typically use on the SSD in order to gain the most performance out of the SSD.\n", "Q: Can i use my old MacBook charger on my new Mac? I have a 2011 15\" MBP, that uses a 85W power supply. \nMy old 2008 MBP 15\" also has a 85W power supply, but I cannot get it to work. Shouldnt it? Its the same watt power, and the adapter fits.\n\nA: The way Apple power adapters are designed is that you can use any charger on any laptop that has the same, or lower, power rating. For example, you can safely use an 85W power adapter (for MacBook Pro) on a MacBook Air (which requires only 45W) or MacBook (which requires 65W).\nHowever this does not work the other way around, you cannot use a MacBook Air (45W) adapter to power a MacBook Pro.\nA 2008 MacBook Pro adapter rated at 85W should power a 2011 MacBook Pro with no problem. If this is not the case, then the adapter is faulty.\n\nA: Yes.\nApple sells and markets the Cinema Display with an 85 watt adapter and it's an accessory for all MacBook whether your portable shipped with an adapter of 45 watts, 60 watts or 85 watts.\nUsing your higher rated adapter with a Mac that draws less power is safe to do. Going the other way is also safe - but the Mac will either not charge, charge slowly or work fine depending on how much power it needs from moment to moment.\n\nA: After 2 years my Macbook Pro battery life has seen better days. It will only last 2 hours max. However, I recently visited friends and forgot my 85W power supply. Instead I charged up with the 13\" Macbook 60W adapter. Yes, it took longer to charge all the way. However, I found a seemingly rejuvenated battery - with life extended to 4-6 hours depending on what applications I'm running. \nTo test this phenomenon, I have since tried multiple charge cycles with both a 60W and 85W adapter. Sure enough, every time I used the 60W charger I had a much longer battery life. And when I switch back to my brand new 85W power supply, I'm back to about 90 minutes battery life. \nI've discussed this with several physicist and engineer friends, who can't offer an explanation. I assumed that the battery life was running down with time (even though I maintain proper battery training protocol) but I can't argue against the reality that using a 65W adapter has yielded a bigger charge and longer life. Go figure?\n\nA: I have only just found out that adaptors are universal. I saw the new shape attachment on my MacBook Pro and thought it would not fit my old Macbook. The old 65W adaptor works well on my upgraded 2011 Macbook Pro and vice versa. The battery life is good. I'm so happy to discover this.\n", "Q: My Mountain Lion won't recognize USB controller button presses... Why? All right.  I've played games on my MacBook Pro using a crappy Microsoft Sidewinder gamepad for years, plugged into my USB port.  I just upgraded to Mountain Lion a few days ago, though, and for some reason, I can't get any programs to recognize my controller's button presses.  System Information (not System Profiler anymore, I guess) will tell me it's plugged in, sure, but no programs will actually register button presses.  It's rather odd, and extremely frustrating since I would really like to, you know, use the controller.\nI've tried unplugging it and plugging it back in after a few minutes.  Or hours.  I've tried restarting with the controller not plugged in.  I've tried restarting with the controller plugged in.  I've tried using a different controller to rule out controller malfunction.  I've tried using a different USB port.  (I have a USB mouse and it works in either port.)  I think signs point to a driver issue, but why would Mountain Lion suddenly be incompatible with my controller if it worked under Lion?  Something's very strange here.  Thank you very much!\nEDIT: The USB Prober app from the Hardware I/O Tools download (from the dev site) sees my controller just fine.  It identifies it and everything.  Other applications, on the other hand, don't...\nEDIT x2: I restarted with the controller in the port, and it was working!  Hoorah!  I used ControllerMate to see what was up, and it recognized everything I did!  I played a game with it and quit the application.  But now it no longer works; ControllerMate suggests that some other software is controlling my controller.  I've had issues with this with my built-in camera before, years ago, but they kinda just went away.  So I'm still stuck -- unless the only way is to restart every time I want to use my controller, which is kinda anti-Mac.  Suggestions?\nEDIT x3: Well, that's kind of odd.  The Ink preference pane showed up for some reason.  And weirder, after a restart where my controller was connected during startup, I could use the controller as a mouse.  It was actually moving around the pointer, though only in an absolute sense: when I let go off the direction pad, the cursor jumped to the center.  I disconnected the controller and plugged it back in, and now it doesn't work again.\nEDIT x4: The Ink prefpane was due to SteerMouse; I uninstalled it and the prefpane went away.  I also reset my NVRAM, but no change.  However, I figured out something very important.  I had the controller running, then I used Chrome for a while.  Controller was still running.  I used Chrome again.  Controller stopped.  Gah, not again.  I quit Chrome.  Controller came back online immediately.\nSO THE PROBLEM IS CHROME.\nPerhaps the reason I thought it was my Mountain Lion update is because Chrome did an auto-update at the same time, or perhaps Mountain Lion breaks Chrome's behavior, or perhaps Mountain Lion's USB drivers don't like Chrome.  Whatever the situation is, I've at least managed to pinpoint the problem better.  Still not solved, though...\n\nA: I was having virtually the same problem and it turns out Chrome was the cause.\nI'm using an Xbox 360 controller on Mountain Lion with the tattiebogle driver.  Recently, my controller would just cease to respond, even though it was showing as connected and no amount of disconnecting/re-connecting would fix the problem; the only thing that seemed to work was a re-boot.\nI was doing some research earlier and came across this post.  I found it hard to believe that Chrome would be the cause, but sure enough, the controller has stopped working twice now and both times I closed down Chrome, re-connected, and all is fine again!  Thanks for your post, it helped me a lot!\n\nA: Install Chrome's latest beta\nhttp://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel\nSame was ocurring to me, with osx 10.7.4 and Chrome 21, installing 22.0.1229.56 beta solved the problem.\nps: Thanks for this post, saved my week!\n\nA: Try to see if a third party USB controller will work. Something like SteerMouse. Even though is says Mouse in the name, I believe that it does other USB devices as well. I think that there is a trial, available so you can try before you buy. There are other USB mouse controllers available for Macintosh if this doesn't work.\n", "Q: What kinds of files can be added to Documents in the Cloud? I already know that Pages can add .doc files too, but my knowledge ends at that. Does anyone have an exhaustive list of files that can be added to Documents in the Cloud through Apple apps (Preview, iWork, TextEdit, etc) only?\n\nA: If you consider the Finder to be an Apple app, the answer is any arbitrary file.\nFrom my experimentation, it appears files dropped into folders in the ~/Library/Mobile Documents hierarchy get synched to other computers using the same iCloud account, regardless of type.\n", "Q: iMessage not working on iPhone without sim My friend never had a sim for her iPhone 4. She uses the phone as a skype device and camera (and she loved it that way!). I recently persuaded her to update to iOS 5.1, created a new iCloud account (she never had one), enabled iMessage. However, she does not receive any iMessages. She can send out iMessages but they do not reach me (I have a working iPhone with iCloud, iMessages). I have restarted her machine several times and did a clean install of iOS 5.1. Can anyone tell me what might be incorrect here? (I see that a lot of people have an iPhone without sim working as an iMessage device.)\n\nA: I can iMessage from my Wifi only iPad, so it can be done. I have a feeling it has something to do with the sending or receiving address. I would check the Messages setting to make sure it is set to her Apple ID/email address. I would also try, instead of her sending it to your phone number, having her send it to your Apple ID/email address, as that is more universally recognized. It would be interesting to know if she can iMessage other iPhones as well.\n\nA: I turned off iMessage, restarted the iPhone and turned iMessage back on and it suddenly can recieve and send iMessages.\n", "Q: How can I diagnose why I can no longer access certain sites on certain networks since I upgraded to Mountain Lion? Since upgrading to Mountain Lion, I can no longer see certain sites, when connected to certain networks.\nI have a 2011 15\" MacBook Pro (Quad-Core i7) which came with Lion (actually I think it came with Snow Leopard and a free upgrade to get Lion form the Mac App Store).\nI work as a consultant on a client site. I connect my laptop to a WiFi network at the client.\nI have recently upgraded to Mountain Lion, and since then when I am on the client's network, I can no longer visit certain sites. One of the sites affected is *.apple.com - including www.apple.com, the iTunes store, the App Store and developer.apple.com.\nI used to be able to access all of these sites prior to upgrading.\nI thought that maybe the client's IT services had blocked certain sites at the same time - maybe seeing a spike of traffic to the app store when people upgraded, but that is not the case. I can access the site from other devices on the same network. Also, apple.com is not the only one I cannot access.\nI thought that maybe there was something wrong with my laptop, but I have no trouble connecting to these sites when I am connected to my own company's VPN (over the very same client's WiFi network).\nAs far as I can tell, it only happens for certain sites, when connected through this one network, only after I upgraded to Mountain Lion.\nI suspect that it has something to do with DNS resolution, and possibly to do with sites that redirect in a certain way - for example apple.com redirects to edge networks like Akamai - and possibly something to do with how the client network is set up, and possibly to do with some change in the network stack in Mountain Lion (but none of these factors on its own - only in combination!)\nHas anyone else experienced this? \nWhat can I do to fix it? \nOr at the very least to help diagnose it and report to the company's IT team and to Apple?\nUpdate: I have noticed, since I posted this, that it only affects Safari, iTunes Store and Mac App Store (I imagine they all use the same underlying component), but not Firefox or Chrome.\nUPDATE 2: Since the 10.8.2 update to Mountain Lion, this problem has gone away – Vihung Oct 8 '12\n\nA: When I've had this issue in the past, like the two day period when I couldn't access Flickr from my laptop but I could from other machines, the solution was to flush the DNS Cache: essentially a small database on your machine that can help (or so my understanding) speed up network access.\nAccording to the latest Apple Support document on this, the command is:\nsudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder\n\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT5343\n\nA: The asker has indicated in the comments that updating to 10.8.2 has fixed this issue for him.\n\nA: Since the 10.8.2 update to Mountain Lion, this problem has gone away\n", "Q: Can I Enter Sleep Mode While Downloading File?

Is there an application I could run, keyboard shortcut maybe? I'm using rMBP running ML.\nEDIT: All I found was using Hot Corner as explained here: https://www.apple.com/findouthow/mac/#quickscreensaver \nBasically it means I have to move my mouse cursor into a corner and maybe comine a key such as command to enter Screen Saver. I don't really like this solution.\n\nA: If you open Keychain Access (I use Spotlight, but you can go to /Applications/Utilities), go to the main menu and hit Preferences... (or Command-,) you'll find a checkbox labeled \"Show keychain status in menu bar...\" If you check it, you'll get a little lock in your menubar.\n\nIf you click \"Lock Screen\", your screensaver will activate. I use this at work as an OSX Control-Alt-Delete alternative.\n(Note: it will require your user password to unlock the screen. This may/may not be desirable.)\n\nA: Well this is sort of a hack, but you can create a script/service to enable the screensaver and then assign it a shortcut. This AppleScript works for enabling the screensaver:\ntell application \"ScreenSaverEngine\" to activate\n\nYou have two options for assigning a keyboard shortcut to this script:\n\n\n*\n\n*Save it as a service and assign it a keyboard shortcut through System Preferences.

You don't need to press any keys with a hot corner.\n\nA: From Apple's discussion forum\n\nAnother option would be to use Automator to create a service to start the screen saver and set a keyboard shortcut to turn it on.\nTo do this, open Automator and choose Service as the template for a new workflow. Type \"screen\" in the search field to locate the \"Start Screen Saver\" action and drag it to the workflow. Set the \"Service receives selected\" option to \"no input\". Save your workflow with the same name you want it to have in the Services menu.\nNext, open System Preferences > Keyboard and go to the Keyboard Shortcuts tab. In the left column, click on Services and scroll the right column down to the bottom to find the Service you just created (it will be listed under the General category).

This past weekend I \"dropped a pin\" on restaurant X using Maps and then \"Shared the location\" via Message to a friend. I had no idea what kind of phone this friend had. I assumed she received the destination and I waited, and I waited, and I waited. Turns out she was waiting for me at a different restaurant X location -- the one across town. We cleared this up the old fashioned way (via voice), and when she finally arrived, I looked at our chat history on her Android. Where there should have been a map link, there was a blank sound or video file. Clearly, \"dropping a pin\" doesn't work when there is an Android on the receiving end.\nBut how to know if one's pin drop hasn't been received? Do I have to confirm a friend has an iPhone before I \"drop a pin\"? \nIs there any way to text message a location via Maps to an Android?\n\nA: If you use the iOS Maps Share Location feature via email, the recipient gets a message with a Google Maps link to the specific location, which is openable in anything with a browser (although mobile devices may open it in a Google Maps app). It also attaches\nvCard containing the address of the pin and the Google Maps link.\nYou could also use the email feature to just get access to the link directly, and copy it into your medium of choice, discarding the email.\n\nA: This feature can be a bit unpredictable sending locations to Android with some of them receiving the location and others not (in actuality they all \"receive\" the message, just some systems don't know how to translate the information hence your friends white screen). \nHowever, you could give something like Viber a go, since it's a third party app for both iPhone and Android the messaging systeming is not OS dependent. It has some other distinct advantages but this page has a good article aout the location sharing function they added last year.\n\nA: When I don't know which kind of smartphone is on the receiving end, its better to use Google Maps app on my iPhone.  I send the \"dropped pin\" from the Google Maps app (instead of using the Apple Maps), all Androids have Google Maps and will be able to access the link.

After upgrading to Mountain Lion, audio playback in iTunes stutters, as well as video playback and other minor system hangs.\nHow can I solve this without a downgrade?\nIs there confirmation of it being a ML bug?\nThere's a thread on this problem, still unsolved and the problem seems pervasive:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/4149309?start=60\nMy specs: Early 2011 13\" MacBook Pro i7 with 16GB of OWC RAM.\nEDIT\nCNET has made an article about the issue\n\nA: The stuttering is a known issue. It should be fixed in the upcoming 10.8.1 update due shortly.\n\nA: I've solved my system wide stuttering with Mountain Lion by now (first sound only, mostly, then aggravated system wide).\nHere's why: My MacBook Pro became unbootable from stock HDD.\nI had a bootcamp partition, no luck when booting into Windows too, got stuck when booting, jusk like when booting into OS X (got stuck at apple sign with spinning wheel).\nI've got a Ubuntu DVD and started a live session, SMART disk diagnostics: 258 bad blocks, imminent disk failure.\nI half apologize Apple in this point, for blaming solely the OS for being just weird. The stuttering origins, in my case, wasn't solely about the OS.\nI should have take notice since when first upgraded to Mountain Lion. With my stock HDD, everytime I tried to install OS X, I needed to reboot a few times and got negative time counter (WEIRD) for the remaining installation time.\nSo what confused me so much?\n\n\n*\n\n*I booted into Windows bootcamp: no stuttering, booted into Mountain Lion: stuttering plus very slow OS.\n\n*OS X Disk Utility never helped or warned about the amount of bad blocks (doing PRAM/SMC resets, filesystem and permission repair never truly helped).\n\n*When using Lion and Snow Leopard, there was no such a slowness/stuttering as there was in Mountain Lion. Before ML, I never experienced \"sound stuttering\", only when upgrading to ML this started to happen. So I suspect ML may be more sensible to disk with bad blocks.\n\n\nI think I had few bad blocks initially and it became aggravated over time, I don't know whether ML usage helped in the aggravation process. Truth is, it was like I'd forced the disk to became unbootable when I last used it with Mountain Lion. It was slow as aways but still usable, I'd got a miniDisplayPort/HDMI cable and thought it was time to try it. The machine became very sloooow when I tried to play some video while connected to my TV, after disconnecting, it just hang, so I forced shutdown and it never booted again.\nI've just replaced the original Toshiba MK5065GSX 500GB 5400RPM (what a crap and I think it was failing when under warranty) with a new Seagate Momentus XT 750GB (SSD hybrid drive, 7200RPM).\nMAN, NOW IT'S BLAZING FAST! (also now I see the benefit of my early OWC 16GB RAM upgrade)\nAnyway, I bought a MacBook Pro in early 2011 and here's what I've learned about MacBooks:\nFirst problem:\n     MacBook Pro refuse to charge without any apparent reason, I thought it was some smart emergency battery calibration routine, no it was not. I've dumbly let the warranty end and didn't replaced this failing and VERY expensive MagSafe, needed to buy a new one. At some point the stock MagSafe stopped charging and didn't return to charge after some hours, as it was aways doing.\nSecond problem:\n    Slowness in Lion (I bought Lion)\n   Got RAM upgrade, no help (I bought 16GB RAM)\n   Got ML upgrade, NO HELP, got stuttering (I bought ML)\n   Died HDD (started dying around 1 year of usage)\n    Got new better HDD (bought)\nThird problem:\n   Bad management of headphone jack makes sound speakers muted.\n    Blame OS X, any other OS: sound speakers working when expected to work.\n    Google for: Headphone jack red macbook\n   I think I can't solve this\nFourth problem:\n    I've spent a lot of more money\nGiven my experience, I have some concerns whether ML helps HDDs die.\nNow it's blazing fast, no stuttering and I can't put a headphone. If a put one, sound speakers only return to be recognized at random afterwards.\nI WILL NEVER BUY APPLE STUFF AGAIN\nMaybe, only used and cheaper apple stuff for upgrades with my own choice of good hardware.\nTIP: Aways check your disk healthy with serious tools\n", "Q: Why are text files not supported by Quicklook? So I know some questions have already been asked about this like Is there a QuickLook preview for plain-text files with unknown extensions? and QuickLook for files with no extension or an unknown extension, but those questions are regarding fixes as oppose to Apple's reasoning behind not supporting QuickLook for some file types. \n\nI have many text files that I use with TextEdit, some in .rtf format and some in .txt format. I also have many .docx files for school. I'm pretty sure Microsoft created the plugin for QuickLook to work with .docx files. .rtf files are also supported by QuickLook.\n\nText files seem like the simplest file type, because unlike .rtf files, they lack elaborate text ornamentation and (sometimes) complex formatting.\nWhy aren't .txt files supported by QuickLook? Are they more elaborate than they seem, or is there something I'm missing?\n\nUPDATE:\nHere's an illustration of what I'm talking about:\n\n\nA: Normally, text files are supported by QuickLook. If you have one that isn't, chances are that there is something \"odd\" about the file, at least from the Finder's point of view.\nTry opening the file in TextEdit and then choose \"Format\" and then \"Make Rich Text\" as shown here:\nhttp://images.luo.ma/TextEdit-Format-Make-Rich-Text.jpg\n\n\n*\n\n*Type a space (or modify the document in some other minor way).\n\n*go back to the \"Format\" menu and choose \"Make Plain Text\" again. \n\n*Save the file. \n\n*Check to see if QuickLook is able to show the file.\n\nA: I had the same problem, and Lri's comment of using qlmanage -r fixed it right up for me.  It also caused .sh and .c files to work with quicklook as well.\nI would have commented in that space but StackExchange doesn't think I'm cool enough to do that\n\nA: I had the same problem and I solved it by noticing that a wrong (corrupted or so) qlgenerator was used to generate the quicklook preview of plain-text files. To do this, you can type, in a terminal,\nqlmanage -m plugins\n\nand search for the public.plain-textstring (e.g. using grep), so you should get something similar to\nqlmanage -m plugins | grep public.plain-text\n   public.plain-text -> /Library/QuickLook/QLMultiMarkdown.qlgenerator (1.2.1 - loaded)\n\nHere it means that in my case the QLMultiMarkdown is responsible for generating the corrupted quicklook for plain-text extension (.txt). There must be a way to force quicklook to point to another qlgenerator for public.plain-text. However, I didn't even try because I don't need QLMultiMarkdown. Instead, I simply moved QLMultiMarkdown.qlgenerator to a backup subfolder (/Library/QuickLook/bak/) and reloaded qlmanage with\nqlmanage -r\n\nYou can now try to preview any .txt files with quicklook by hitting the spacebar. I hope it works for you!\nJust for your own info, to verify which qlgenerator is in use now, re-type\nqlmanage -m plugins | grep public.plain-text\n\nwhich outputs\npublic.plain-text -> /Library/QuickLook/QLColorCode.qlgenerator (2.0.1 - loaded)\n\nin my case. (Note that QLColorCode is a very handy extension for syntax highlighting of source code but rather useless for simple text files. However it works so I won't complain about it.)\n", "Q: How do I get two status-bar clocks with different timezones?

Here is my situation. I live in a shared house where there is already a wireless router that other people use. I have a Macbook Air that has 128GB of hard drive. I want to use Time Machine for automatic backups. I'm considering one of the following options:\n1) I have a spare 320 GB USB drive and spare old Thinkpad that I basically use as a Desktop running Ubuntu. Its on 24/7 and connected to the wireless network. If I connect my hard drive via USB cable to my Thinkpad, is it possible to configure it to be used with Time Machine on my Macbook Air? If so, can I also access the drive from \"outside world\"?\n2) I can get a Time Capsule. I do not have the option to use it as the router (other guys won't like messing with the router). I can connect it via Ethernet to the router but since the router is not in my room, I'd rather not. Is it possible to connect it wirelessly to the router for backups? If so can I access it from the outside network?\nWhich of the two options is more feasible?\n\nA: Both are feasible. I use the first myself, and my sister had the second set up at one point.\n1) On the laptop, you can install netatalk which handles AFP file sharing. Time Machine requires some special AFP features but those are supported by the version of netatalk that comes with Ubuntu 12.04 (just do sudo apt-get install netatalk).\nHere's a decent guide for that, although with current versions you shouldn't actually need avahi-daemon, netatalk can handle Bonjour by itself now. You may actually just be able to get away with adding a line like:\n/home/username/backup    \"Time Machine\"  allow:username   options:tm,noadouble\n\nto /etc/init.d/netatalk/AppleVolumes.default, which is all I had to do on one machine running 12.04 (I don't remember having to do the other stuff, but YMMV).\nNote that you should NOT ever need to use the \"EnableUnsupportedVolumes\" hack as netatalk meets Apple's spec and should appear as a backup destination automatically. Using this hack causes Time Machine to ignore problems that can cause loss of your backups.\n2) A Time Capsule can indeed be connected to a wireless network as a client to share the hard drive (it can also share a printer connected via USB). I think the setup wizard makes it pretty easy, you're basically just looking to set it up as a wireless client and not a router. You might want to hook it up by ethernet if the signal isn't so great, though.\nIf 320GB is enough space (which I imagine it is, unless your Air has a 512GB SSD), I'd go with the netatalk solution unless money is no object.\n\nA: Addtionally:\n\n\n*\n\n*To get netatalk on Ubuntu working with Mac, you have to build the Ubuntu package with SSL support yourself. It's pretty easily but it'll mean you'll have to download the package manually and rebuild the package for every upgrade\n\n\n*\n\n*http://kremalicious.com/ubuntu-as-mac-file-server-and-time-machine-volume/ (full guide of getting Time Machine to work with netatalk on Ubuntu)\n\n*http://blog.damontimm.com/how-to-install-netatalk-afp-on-ubuntu-with-encrypted-authentication/ (guide to build Ubuntu netatalk package with SSL support)\n\n\n*If you want to access the drive from the outside world there are many options, but you're limited by the wireless router: How does it handle VPN passthru? Do you have access to set up port forwarding on it? It probably deserves a separate post.\n\n*Using AFP on Linux for Time Machine backup is fine, but if you plan on sharing other things on that drive, remember that AFP does not support symlinks on its shares.\n\n*If you use AFP on Linux for Time Machine to backup wirelessly, you'll probably always have to backup/restore wirelessly from Linux because the disk will be foramtted as ext3/4 and Time Machine requires HFS+ with ACL for local backups. You can possibly format the backup drive as HFS+ on Linux, but you have to either disable journaling for write support (if you use the native Linux driver) or install Paragon HFS driver for Linux (free).\n\n*You can get an Airport Extreme instead of a Time Capsule since it's cheaper. Use the hard drive sharing feature on Aiport Extreme and have Time Machine backup to it. The HDD can be formatted in HFS+ in such case. You can also configure the Airport Extreme as a WDS wifi extender so the wireless feature won't go to waste (and might make your housemates happy too).\n", "Q: How do I force Keynote to sync with iCloud? When I create new Keynote presentations on my Mac they are not showing up on my iOS devices. I noticed when I open a document from iCloud there is a dotted iCloud symbol in the file viewer.\nIs there a way to manually force the sync to occur? Last time I resolved this by disabling my iCloud account and re-enabling it, this is pretty painful though as it takes awhile.\nAnyone know why these documents won't sync?\n\n\nA: Ok so I got ahold of Apple support and they helped me resolve the issue by deleting the Keynote preferences file located at\n~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iWork.Keynote.plist\nThey instructed me to move it to the Desktop for backup purposes and then reboot the system, after rebooting and opening Keynote again the file was regenerated and the issue was resolved.

Will we ever have BBM service on the iPhone ? Is it possible to port such feature from the blackberry to the iPhone ? I know they use their own servers for verification, but isn't there a method that can divert users to such servers from a stand-alone app made on the iPhone ?\n\nA: It's almost certainly technically possible, but the reason it hasn't been done isn't a technical one, it's a business one.\nBBM and the network of users that go with it is one of RIM's strategic assets, and their thinking is likely that opening it up on other platforms would eliminate a reason for people to buy their hardware (which is where they make their money). Whether that's a sound decision or not and whether RIM may change its mind may be up for debate, but at the moment, that's why there's no BBM for iOS, Android or any non-Blackberry platform, not technical challenges.\n", "Q: How to disable individual USB ports by script? I am looking for a script which will allow me to disable one specific USB port on my Mac mini. It would only serve a purpose if it works in real-time and didn't require a reboot. I've found scripts for various Linux distros that seemed to do something similar - however most required a reboot.\nI've got ambient lighting behind my monitor which is powered by USB and it doesn't turn off when the system sleeps. So my office is constantly lit up, it would be nice if I could write a script that would disable that specific USB port.\nHow to disable individual USB ports by script?\n\nA: Have you seen this thread and the code here? Maybe shell could be used to \"manually\" rename the device ID or port to something odd that won't work, upon a specified event, then renames it to what it's supposed to be later.\n\nA: Another way of attacking the problem could be to add a USB hub to the system and connect the ambient lighting to that.\nSome USB hubs supports that you enable/disable individual ports from software - it is called \"ganged power switching\". That way you can control the lighting from a script. You will need to select a supported USB hub though.\nI used this method for controlling power under Linux - but the same method could also be used on Mac OS X. The USB hub was very cheap.\nYou can find source code for controlling the external hub power here:\nhttp://www.advistatech.com/software/hub-ctrl-20060120.c\nI don't know if it builds with libusb on Mac OS X, but it might.\n\nA: Unfortunately, what you are asking is not possible with any OS X API or AppleScript hook. This is something controlled by the hardware layer of the OS and involves far more work than it's worth. While similar scripts exist for Linux, you must keep in mind that even though OS X and Linux are distant cousins, OS X wasn't built for such fine-grained control over its components like Linux was. Sadly, the only options you have in this case is to unplug the device or completely disable the USB interface. That last one, of course, isn't feasible for you, so unfortunately, there's no solution to this problem. Sorry. :(\nGood luck and happy sleeping!\n", "Q: Does the Mountain Lion installer work on any Mac capable of running Mountain Lion or is it hardware specific? Perhaps this is an obvious question, but will the Mountain Lion installer from the App Store work on any Mac? E.g. if I download it and put it on an SD card on my MacBook Pro can I use that SD card to install Mountain Lion on a family member's white MacBook? I know that the OS discs that the laptops came with were hardware-specific. I'm just trying to avoid downloading and burning the installer again.\n\nA: Once you have downloaded it from the App Store, but before you run it, you can copy the Install Mountain Lion app into the Applications folder of any Mac you have an Admin account on (and have signed into the App store as you obviously) and run it from there.  If the Mac is not recent enough to install Mountain Lion the installer will tell you, otherwise it will happily install Mountain Lion for you.  That's how I updated all the Macs at my place.\nNote that once run the installer will delete itself from the Applications folder.\n", "Q: What is the recommended way to flag a contact as being deceased in the Contacts app on Lion or Mountain Lion?

I am interested to know how other people have dealt with this.\n\nA: I've had the same \"need.\" I guess we all do sooner or later. Here's what I did.\nCard menu > Add Field > Dates. Then select the Date field drop down in the contact and select custom.\nYou can also change the general new contact template in the same Cart menu.\nI hope this helps.\n\nA: As CDK suggests, my solution was adding a new custom date. \nMy problem was that I didn't want to be reminded with this person's birthday every year. Finally, I deleted the birthday and added a new custom date for \"birth\", so it's not recognized by iCal and there are no more notifications about it.\n\nA: You could also add a special symbol to the contact’s comments (I use «†», also known as U+2020 DAGGER), and then create a smart group, where the criterion is Note > contains > † (Alt-t).\n\nA: As others have said, you can add a custom date for deceased and that will help you keep a record. But that doesn't flag them very well for general viewing. You can't filter by the presence or absence of your custom field (at least not in 10.7).\nI would also insert a keyword in the notes to use as your filter, something like #deceased. Then you can set up a filtered group called Not dead to mask all those poor folks.

I've read that the EULA now allows to install Mac OS X in a virtual machine, and I'd be interested in doing it. However, since I forgot to back up the Mountain Lion installation program before using it, I'd like to be able to do it from the recovery partition. Apparently, Parallels can do that, so it's probably not impossible from VMware Fusion.\nThis is what I've tried with VMware Fusion:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mount the Recovery HD partition, then find the BaseSystem.dmg file on it and assign it as an OS installation disk: the system boots, but it says \"This copy of the Install OS X Mountain Lion application is damaged, and can't be used to install OS X\" when I try to install it.\n\n*Dump the whole Recovery HD partition to a disk image and try to boot from it: does not boot, the Apple logo gets replaced by a Ø symbol.\n\n\nConsidering these two failed attempts, I'm not too sure how I should proceed from here.\nHow can I install Mountain Lion in a VMware Fusion virtual machine from the recovery partition?\n\nA: You cannot install OS X Mountain Lion through the Recovery HD to VMWare Fusion.

For example, I'd like to automatically run YUI Compressor whenever I edit a JavaScript source file to output a compressed version.\nIdeally the process does not run in the background but in a dedicated shell, so I can easily terminate the process at the end of the day.\nWhat would be the cleanest and most flexible way to watch specific files and/or directories for file changes and perform a custom action inside a shell?\n\nA: The $25 Codekit does watch folders and files for changes and does compress/minify/combine JavaScript and CSS files. \nI know this is only a partial answer for your question, as it is not a generic watcher, but it does fit your example:\n\nwhenever I edit a JavaScript source file to output a compressed\n  version\n\n\nA: Watching a file for changes can be accomplished with a LaunchAgent. For example create a plist file at ~/Library/LaunchAgents/watch.and.lol.plist and fill it with this content:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>watch.and.lol</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>/Users/Shared/changeAction.sh</string>\n        <string>-force</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>WatchPaths</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>/private/var/radmind/client/.radmindOnDemand</string>\n    </array>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nNow make sure that the file /private/var/radmind/client/.radmindOnDemand does exist. Then load the launchagent with command $ launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/watch.and.lol.plist. As soon as the file ~/Library/LaunchAgents/watch.and.lol.plist does no longer exist, this launchagent job will be unloaded.\nNow write some shell script that watches your file for changes, like:\nchsum1=\"\"\n\nwhile [[ true ]]\ndo\n    chsum2=`md5 /private/var/radmind/client/.radmindOnDemand`\n    if [[ $chsum1 != $chsum2 ]] ; then           \n        compile\n        chsum1=`md5 /private/var/radmind/client/.radmindOnDemand`\n    fi\n    sleep 2\ndone\n\nNote: this shell script needs some extra work to be done to make it efficient. Now it polls every 2 seconds (sleep 2). Better is to exit the script after the compile command has executed. That requires the storage of the output of the md5 hash command that can survive the exit and relauch of this shell script.\n", "Q: Producing/archiving an overview of a directory structure I try to find a way to make an archive of my ~/ directory so that I can go back in case I've lost something.

With all the ruckus surrounding the Mat Honan debacle, I'm curious: When you remotely wipe a Mac, is it a secure wipe or does it just lock down the machine with a code?\nFrom the Wired article:\n\nWhen you perform a remote hard drive wipe on Find my Mac, the system asks you to create a four-digit PIN so that the process can be reversed. But here’s the thing: If someone else performs that wipe — someone who gained access to your iCloud account through malicious means — there’s no way for you to enter that PIN. \n\nThat's as far as they dig into it, and most of the top Google results don't go any further, either.\n\nA: I've done a remote wipe on a MacBook Pro with an SSD running Mountain Lion because I wasn't sure how else to securely wipe the SSD.  So I can answer some of your questions.\nTo start with, Mat Honan was wrong when he said that the purpose of the PIN was so that \"the process can be reversed.\"  It is to prevent the thief from using the computer.  I believe the thinking is that if the computer has to be taken to Apple to be unlocked, then it is much more likely that a stolen computer would be recovered.\nYes, when you remotely wipe the computer it does a secure wipe.  Apple even warns you that it could take as long as a day.  However, if your drive was encrypted with FileVault 2, then it is not necessary to erase the disk.  It is sufficient to securely erase the encryption key(s) stored on the disk, so that's what they do.  It's very quick and as secure as the underlying encryption system is, which for now is very secure. You cannot recover the drive with the recovery key once the encryption key(s) have been erased.\nBefore starting to wipe the disk, though, Apple installs some kind of lock on the system that prevents you from booting it up from the internal or an external drive.  I don't know the details of how this works, I only know that I did not find an obvious way around it.  \n\nEDIT\nI did this a second time and this time I wrote down the steps.\n\n\n*\n\n*After the laptop received the remote wipe instruction it emitted 2 short beeps and then froze, displaying the spinner (not a beach ball), and then rebooted\n\n*After reboot, it displayed a Grey screen with the message “Enter your system lock PIN code to unlock this Mac” and options to sleep, restart, or shut down.\n\n*I entered the PIN code pretty much right away\n\n*After a brief delay the laptop rebooted into the Recovery partition and asked about installing a system (either a new system via the internet or an old system via a Time Machine backup or other computer to clone)\n\n*I then rebooted the computer into Target Disk mode and examined the drive from another computer. The drive is no longer seen as an encrypted drive and I could find no signs of useable data on the drive, though to be fair I did not try anything too fancy. I have faith that the encryption key was wiped and that all I would find is encrypted data for which I no longer had the key. \n\n\nNow back to our original story...\n\nBelow is from memory, so might be slightly wrong in some details.  You can read another person's account of the process from MacObserver.  (They were able to recover files from their unencrypted mechanical drive, but I believe it was because they entered the passcode and interrupted the wipe before it finished.)  I think that after the remote wipe started and the lock screen came up on the MacBook Pro I did not wait very long for it to finish wiping the drive and entered the PIN to see what I could see on the drive. (I never saw anything on the drive, but I also did not take it out of the computer and send it to DriveSavers for them to check out.)  I don't recall exactly how I got to powering down the machine post-wipe.\nAnyway, after the wipe and power-down, I attached an external Mountain Lion Install drive and powered up the computer. I got a flashing folder with a question mark (meaning it cannot find a boot drive).  \nI rebooted, holding down the option key to get a choice of boot disks. I had a choice between Macintosh HD (the internal drive) and the external drive.  I picked the external drive and again got the flashing folder with a question mark.  \nI rebooted again, holding down the option key again, but this time chose \"Macintosh HD\".  Then I was presented with a screen to enter the unlock PIN.  Which I did.  I was then back to the screen where I could choose a boot drive, but this time the internal drive was labeled \"10.8 Recovery HD\" or something like that.  I again chose the external drive and it booted fine.  I was then able to reinstall the OS and all was normal from there.  \nI didn't see about trying to put the computer into target disk mode but Apple is pretty savvy about encryption and security so I expect that the PIN code lock is in the firmware and the computer just won't do anything until it's unlocked. I also suspect that Apple can unlock the computer with some secret procedure, but that would only restore the computer to normal operation: whatever was on the disk would still be gone to the extent the computer was able to erase it before you got it to Apple. (The MacObserver article states that they were not able to put the computer into target disk mode until they unlocked it when it was just remote locked. Mat Honan stated in a follow-up to his original article about getting hacked that the Apple Genius he eventually got to help him \"had been able to reset the firmware password\" even though he \"couldn’t crack the PIN\".)  What makes the encrypted drives so secure is that all you need to erase is probably just one file system block containing the encryption key(s), so it's done in under a second.\n\nA: No, it's not a secure wipe, and technically it's not even a \"wipe\" according to Apple's Technical White Paper \"OS X Security\":\n\n\"FileVault 2 provides IT departments with the ability to erase the\n  encryption key from a given Mac at any time to ensure that encrypted\n  data cannot be accessed by either user login or data recovery tools.\n  This process is referred to as a remote wipe.\"\n\nSource: Apple Technical White Paper OS X Security (March 2012)\n", "Q: Will Apple's Mac Remote Wipe delete items on external disk?

According to Siracusa's ML review, unlike in previous OS X versions, in 10.8 your system is eligible for sleep immediately upon \"user inactivity\" (the inactivity delay being set in your energy saver settings) unless the currently running apps make \"power assertions\".\nIn this case, that key combo is signalling to the OS that \"user inactivity\" should be triggered right away. In such a case, if your particular app that's downloading stuff does not make power assertions, your system will sleep.\nI have come across the same issue generally (not necessarily related to triggering the screen sleep combo). See: Mountain Lion sleeps too aggressively\n\nA: You can set a hot corner to turn off the display.\n\nMountain Lion ships with a new command, caffeinate, to temporarily prevent the machine from sleeping.

Heres a few solutions that should get everything syncing nicely for you:\nFirstly, you need to have all devices set up to the same Apple ID\niOS Devices (iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad):\n\n\n*\n\n*Navigate to Settings > Messages.\n\n*Make sure iMessage is turned on.\n\n*Tap on Receive At.\n\n*Check your Apple ID. Make note of this Apple ID.\n\n*Tap on Caller ID.\n\n*Use your email address. If you use your phone number (assuming you’re on an iPhone), then the non phone devices (including the Mac) may not (and probably won’t) see the messages.\n\n\nMac version:\n\n\n*\n\n*Navigate to the Messages app.\n\n*Go to Preferences > Accounts.\n\n*Add the same Apple ID as you used on the iOS devices.\n\n\n \nIn a nutshell: everything needs to be consistent. Use the same Apple ID everywhere and an email address as a caller id for best results.\nIf things are still not syncing, try the following.\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete all your previous conversations: Some people have reported that they had to delete all of their conversations before things would sync up.\n\n*Make sure you have your phone number added to your Apple ID account online.\n\n", "Q: Different language for Mac OS and AppStore's softwares My OS X (Mountain Lion) is in English, and I want to keep it like this.\nBut, for some softwares in the AppStore (not necessary all), I would like to turn it in French when supported (like OmniFocus) because all my colleagues are working in French, and it's hard for me to tell them what to do when they have a problem:\nThe translator of the software does not necessarily use the same words as me, and it become difficult to navigate through the menus in some cases.\nSo, is it possible to configure just some software (or all of them as a last resort) to use a different language that the one used by the Mac OS?\n\nA: Yes! You can launch a single app into any other language with this nifty tool: Language Switcher.

The phrase for Disk Password will remain unchanged. \nYou need not use the FileVault areas of System Preferences but if you do, most things work as expected. \nThe machine pictured above is perfectly clean, restored from a Mountain Lion template that I created following installation of the OS (at the Welcome screen I shut down, then used Disk Utility to image all partitions/slices of the disk).

A more definite opinion may be drawn from Infiltrate the Vault: Security Analysis and Decryption of Lion Full Disk Encryption (2012).)

I had the problem too and I found that there was one simple fix on this thread. \nBasically, the theory (and I'm 99% certain it's correct) is that the bug relates to bonjour, and some apps that use bonjour in mountain lion are causing wifi processes to hang and thus crashing OSX. Anyway, the program that was doing it for me, and probably what I've seen to be the most common one, is Transmit, the awesome little FTP client by Panic. Unfortunately, Panics Menu Bar icon which can be quite useful appeared to be the worst culprit, but toggling off \"Show Transmit Disk in menu bar\" in transmit preferences  solved the problem.\nIf you're not using Transmit or if you're still having issue, run through that forum and hopefully you'll find one of the other fixes works for you.\nPS. Apple knows about the problem and I think they're working on a fix.\n\nA: Does this happen all the time or only after waiting for a while?

I have an 80GB Fujitsu 2.5\" hard drive that died about a day ago and had nothing backed up. Is it possible to retrieve data off of it somehow.\n\nA: SSDs don't come in an 80GB size (that I've seen -- usually multiples of 32GB). It may be possible depending on why the drive dies. If its a mechanical failure, then you could take the drive to a specialty computer repair shop (try local before the big stores), and they should be able to help you with diagnosing the actual issue. Since the data is stored magnetically, (if the drive data is not corrupt) you can retrieve the data but you may have to remove the platters and put into a new HD unit with working mechanics... this might cost quite a bit of money -- you'd need a clean room to be safe.\nBottom-line, the data is retrievable (most likely) but the cost may prevent you from getting it back.\n\nA: If your HD still has some life you could try a few tricks: \n\n\n*\n\n*Some people have had success with hard drives that still spin but won't mount by cooling them down with aerosol coolant or refrigeration (in a completely dry rice or silica gel filled container) and then plugging back in and if they mount, quickly creating a virtual image of the drive. \n\n*Another trick is to replace the hard drive's printed circuit board with the one from a working identical drive and quickly create an image. Apple users have long used Disk Warrior to fix non-mounting drives -- in fact, if you can get a hard drive to mount long enough to create a virtual copy Disk Warrior will repair the image itself. \n\n*Finally, as the poster above mentioned, there are data recovery companies that will recover the data pretty much no matter what if the platters are intact but they are shockingly expensive. \nYou might consider all the common data recovery programs or dd_rescue. Try Disk warrior first and if none work, try mounting the disk again and again in Disk Utility -- sometimes it will suddenly come to life for a little while. \nOtherwise try my first suggestions and if absolutely nothing works and you are ready to write the whole thing off and about to throw it away whack it two or three times laterally as hard as you would smack a bee that stuck you but no harder. \nIf that doesn't work send it off to professionals or if you are incredibly brave and very poor, get an identical drive and take both apart, replace the platters and immediately create a disc image because that is about how long it will continue working. It IS possible to do so and mount the disc without a clean room, it is just very very difficult and not likely to work due to contamination, the massive power of the magnets inside hard drives touching the platters, etc. Best of luck, we've all been there.\n\nA: With the software DataRescue I have been able to recover data from an external hard drive but the folder structure was not recovered.\n\nA: I resurrected most of my died external harddrives by changing the enclosure. Usually the problem is in the bridge between HD and USB.\nSometimes, I needed to rebuild the partition table with testdisk, or with tools present on a live DVD of Ubuntu (working with an OS other than OS X may help bypass OS specific features that prevent Diskutil from repairing disks).\n", "Q: How to fix AFP where some users connect after 4 minutes and others never connect (spinning progress bar and no authentication dialog)? I am having an issue for multiple (but not all) users whereby AFP connections are taking 4+ minutes to connect to the share. Some never connect.

What defines a \"shared\" calendar?  I have a bunch of iCloud calendars, and a Google one, and I share them all with my wife.

With this option not checked (as it is in your screen shot), if she made an adjustment to one of them on her iOS device or Mac, I would have a new notification on my iMac notifying me of the change. \nSimilar to this screen shot, but instead of saying 'Coffee in 24 minutes', it said '[other persons name] changed [event name]' or something similar. \n\nIf you check that box, these notifications would be suppressed. This feature was annoying me (because of another bug, many of our events had alerts put on them that we didn't want, so I checked this box so we didn't go crazy trying to fix them). Something similar may show up in iOS 6 as well.\nFinally, I have only used iCloud calendars with this, so I am unsure if it works exactly the same when using a shared Google calendar.

Based on the answers above, I made an Alfred extension script that toggles Keyboard Viewer.\nhttps://dl.dropbox.com/u/29440342/linkedFiles/Keyboard%20Viewer.alfredextension\nIt provides an alfred keyword \"kv\" that toggles Keyboard Viewer on and off, by running the following applescript:\n-- adapted from http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/62532\nif application \"KeyboardViewer\" is running then\n    quit application \"KeyboardViewer\"\nelse\n    activate application \"KeyboardViewer\"\nend if\n\n(*\n-- adapted from http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/59986\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"SystemUIServer\"\n    tell (menu bar item 1 where description is \"text input\") of menu bar 1\n        click\n        click (menu item 1 where title ends with \"Keyboard Viewer\") of menu 1\n    end tell\nend tell\n*)\n-- icon ripped from osx /System/Library/PreferencePanes Keyboard.prefPane/Contents/Resources/Keyboard.icns\n\nI left an alternative implementation commented out, in case I experience performance problems that it was meant to avoid.\n\nA: The Extra Scripts Plugin of Quicksilver offers this functionality by providing Show Keyboard Viewer.scpt.\nAlso, when you create a Quicksilver Trigger for Show Keyboard Viewer.scpt with the action Run, then you get the global Keyboard Viewer hotkey.\nHere's the source of the script:\nproperty theApplication : \"KeyboardViewer\"\nproperty thePath : \"/System/Library/Input Methods/KeyboardViewer.app\"\n\nset HFSPath to ((POSIX file thePath) as string)\ntell application \"System Events\" to ¬\n    set isRunning to 0 < (count (application processes whose name is theApplication))\nif isRunning then\n    tell application HFSPath to quit\nelse\n    ignoring application responses\n        tell application HFSPath to activate\n    end ignoring\nend if\n\nIf KeyboardViewer is opened with an AppleScript or with open and the main window is closed, the Keyboard Viewer process stays open and keeps using about 0-20% CPU.\n\nA: It's dead in Catalina - no app called KeyboardViewer any longer.\nInstead, use the Accessibility options in System Preferences and toggle everything else off so the Accessibility options shortcut (⌘ + ⎇ + F5) only turns the Accessibility Keyboard on and off. Of course, if you need the other options and to see the keyboard, you're boned. Thanks Apple!!\n\n\nA: This would also work after the main window has been closed by clicking the close button:\nif application \"KeyboardViewer\" is running then\n    tell application \"System Events\" to number of windows of process \"KeyboardViewer\"\n    if result is 0 then\n        quit application \"KeyboardViewer\"\n        delay 0.1\n        launch application \"KeyboardViewer\"\n    else\n        quit application \"KeyboardViewer\"\n    end if\nelse\n    launch application \"KeyboardViewer\"\nend if\n\nIf Keyboard Viewer is opened with AppleScript or open -a KeyboardViewer and the main window is closed, the process stays open and keeps using about 0-15% CPU. It doesn't happen when selecting Show Keyboard Viewer from the input menu. So a better option might be to click the menu item:\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"SystemUIServer\"\n    tell (menu bar item 1 where description is \"text input\") of menu bar 1\n        click\n        click (menu item 1 where title ends with \"Keyboard Viewer\") of menu 1\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nBoth scripts require access for assistive devices to be enabled in the accessibility preference pane.\n\nA: The selected answer does not work on Catalina.

(Section 4)\n\nArrows will navigate you to the Keyboard Preferences icon and the Show/Hide options. When you enter Fn+Ctrl+F8 the icon to the furthest left side of the \"Status menu\" icons which are on the right half of the menu bar will get highlighted. Once it is selected, then use the Right Arrow → to navigate to the one you want.  Use the Down Arrow ↓ to open the menu and select the option you want. Note that the Option key will make different menu options available in some of the \"status menus\".  \n\nOf note, Fn+Ctrl+F2 will activate the Apple menu icon  on the left hand side. From there the Right Arrow → will give you access to the Application menu. These options are available in System Preferences >> Keyboard >> Shortcuts::Keyboard:\n\nDepending on how you have your Function keys configured, the Fn is optional.  \n\nIn macOS Sierra you can also use Siri to help with this. Invoke Siri with whichever keyboard shortcut you choose from System Preferences >> Siri::Keyboard Shortcut, for example Option+Spacebar \n\n...then say \"Turn on the Keyboard Viewer\"  \n\n...and voila:  \n\nUnfortunately, Siri will not close the Keyboard Viewer, nor will Command⌘+w\n\nA: Launch Keyboard Viewer with a Service (Improved)\nYou can launch the Keyboard Viewer with a shortcut by using Automator and the OS X Services functionality.\nThe Keyboard Viewer program lives at /System/Library/Input Methods/KeyboardViewer.app (in versions prior to Lion, it may be at /System/Library/Components/KeyboardViewer.component/Contents/SharedSupport/KeyboardViewerServer.app). You open it with a hotkey by using Automator to create a simple launcher service.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Automator and select Service as the type of your new document.\n\n*Set the options (at the top of the workflow area) to \"Service receives no input in any application\".\n\n*Add the Run AppleScript action to your workflow, and replace the text with the following lines:\nif application \"KeyboardViewer\" is running then\n    quit application \"KeyboardViewer\"\nend if\n\nactivate application \"KeyboardViewer\"\n\n-- wait until the window has been closed, then end the KeyboardViewer process\nset numberOfWindows to 1\nrepeat until numberOfWindows = 0\n    delay 5\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        tell process \"KeyboardViewer\"\n            set numberOfWindows to count windows\n        end tell\n    end tell\nend repeat\nquit application \"KeyboardViewer\"\n\n\n*Save with a name like \"Open Keyboard Viewer\", then open Keyboard Preferences to the Keyboard Shortcuts tab. Select Services in the left pane and scroll to the bottom, where you should see the name of your Service under the General Section.\n\n*Make sure the box is checked to enable it, then select it and click add shortcut to set a hotkey.\n\n*After setting the hotkey, open the Services menu in any application (i.e. Finder > Services), then close it. For some reason my hot key didn't work until I did this.\n\n\nA couple notes:\n\n\n*\n\n*The script requires that you check the Enable access for assistive devices box in the Universal Access preference pane.\n\n*Closing the Keyboard Viewer window doesn't actually quit the application, and as Lri points out, it can be a bit of a resource hog, so the repeat loop checks every 5 seconds if Keyboard Viewer has any open windows, and if not, quits the process.\n\n*If you're running a pre-Lion OS, you may need to replace the instances of KeyboardViewer with KeyboardViewerServer. I don't have anything pre-Lion handy to test this (if someone else could report back in the comments, that would be great.\n\n*Because the script loops until the Keyboard Viewer is closed, the Automator spinning gear icon will show in the menu bar until it closes.\n\n\nA: you can do everything by Automator:\n\n\n*\n\n*open Automator and select \"Application\"\n\n*in top of Library find \"Launch application\", double click it\n\n*choose \"other\" and navigate to KeyboardViewer file in /System/Library/Input Methods\n\n*Save with an name like \"start keyboard\". test it.\n\n\nnext part is to close keyboard: \n\n\n*\n\n*open Automator and select \"Application\"\n\n*in top of Library find \"Quit application\", double click it\n\n*choose \"other\" and navigate to KeyboardViewer file in /System/Library/Input Methods \n\n*Save with an name like \"quit keyboard\". test it.\nnow you will have two files one for open, one for close.\nall you need is associate your mouse buttons to launch these two files!\nfor example, i`m using Microsoft Bluetooth Notebook Mouse 5000 and it\nwork great for me in 10.9.1\n\nA: Activity Monitor, KeyboardViewer.app launches from  \nFinder location:    /System/Library/Input Methods/KeyboardViewer.app. \nNormal use: open from Menu Bar, close from mouse hover to view window buttons where (x) close button can be clicked.

Find My Mac is a useful feature of iCloud to locate your computer. As recent events have shown, however, if bad guys gain control of one's iCloud account, they can wreak havoc, including remotely erasing the contents of your Mac.\nIs there a way to enable \"Find My Mac\" to find one's computer but not to enable the remote wipe feature?\nA good answer would point to some official Apple document about whether or not this is supported. A great answer would say no, this isn't supported, but you can modify this particular file on your computer to prevent remote wipe from happening.\n\nA: In this Knowledge Base article, Apple write \"With Find My iPhone set up on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch or Mac, you can locate, display a message, play a sound, remotely lock, or remotely wipe (erase) your device using the Find My iPhone app from another device (such as a friend's iPhone or iPad).\"\nThis is the closest I have found to a direct statement that it's one package: if it's set up, you can locate, display a message, play a sound, lock, or erase. None of the documentation about configuration mentions options to enable these selectively; the control is off/on.\nAs far as disabling remote wipe, there seems to be a strong indication that the remote wipe involves rebooting to the Restore partition. Evidences for this include the fact that \"Find my Mac\" will not turn on (be greyed out) if there is no Restore partition present. Also, it would be very difficult for a running process to wipe its own boot drive. The Find my Mac remote wipe causes a reboot. It seems most likely that wherever the remote wipe lives, it's somewhere on the recovery partition.\nSo, Find my Mac won't turn on unless there is a recovery partition. Remote wipe most likely won't work if the Recovery partition isn't bootable. To enable Find My Mac but disable Remote Wipe, you need to have a recovery partition, and it needs to not successfully boot. Sabotage the recovery system somewhere so it can't boot and thus can't be used as the plaatform to wipe your main drive. Of course you will want to keep an external bootable recovery drive (USB stick?) available if you do this.\n\nA: The first suggestion of sabotaging you recovery partition will not work. If you do that, the \"Find My Mac\" feature will disable itself. Meaning when you log into the feature, your computer will no longer be listed. The computer needs that recovery partition to function. If it's gone, \"Find my Mac\" will turn itself off on the computer. I found this out by accident. I used Carbon Copy to transfer my data to a bigger harddrive on my MacBook Pro and the software didn't copy the recovery partition over. When I went onto Find My Phone about a month later, My MBP was no longer listed (I was showing the feature to a friend who just bought a mac). So I went into iCloud in system preferences and noticed Find My Mac was greyed out and said \"recovery system update required\". the only way i was able to fix this and get FMM running again was to reinstall the operating system so the Recovery partition could be rebuilt. So yeah. Don't damage / erase the recovery partition or the FMM app WILL stop working altogether.\n\nA: No, you can't selectively disable remote wiping.  If you could, the thieves could do it too.\nYou also can't modify anything on the machine to prevent it, that I know of.  It might even be using built in UNIX tools that come with the machine, such as rm, to do the deleting.  You really, really wouldn't want to rename or delete the rm program.\nSorry.  There are alternatives, such as Prey and Orbicule's Undercover and Witness.\nGood luck.\nEDIT: The alternatives above may give you what you want.\n\nA: What do you think of this: \nGo to iCloud.com and sign in. \nSelect \"Find My Phone\"... FMP actually is misnamed and finds all your devices, including your Macs. \nYou can email yourself when the Mac is found, and you can also \"remote lock\" - rather than \"remote wipe\".\nNaturally, you will also have a location.\n", "Q: Lion on LDAP Linux domain I need to put a desktop Mac OS X Lion in the domain of a corporate network - Linux LDAP.\nThe Mac is already picking up the IP and the DNS name released.

Sparrow also can open EML file, but not sure if need you to setup an account.  If you just want to view the file, just use Quick Look but cannot save attachment.\n\nA: To extract attachments from the Terminal, you can use a couple of different methods. Probably the easiest is  \n\nperl -MMIME::Base64 -ne 'print decode_base64($_)' < file.eml > out\n\nwhere file.eml is the email file in question and out is the name of the attachment.\nThe same thing can be accomplished by using the base64 command, but you have to do some cleanup work on the original email file first -- namely strip everything out of the eml file before the base64 encoded attachment. The command would be something along these lines\n\nbase64 -D -i file.eml -o out\n\nIf you take the 2nd approach, recommend that you operate on a copy of the original file.\nOf course for reading the eml files, you can probably use cat or your favorite editor.

So I had thought that my AppleCare lasted until September, so today I visited the Geniuses to try to squeeze a new hard drive out of them. Unfortunately, my warranty ended a couple weeks ago, and so I am shopping for a new SSD instead. \nNewegg has some great deals, and it looks like I will be getting off pretty easily price-wise. My one question is, however, how does changing out my hard drive (myself theoretically) change the Mountain Lion upgrade issue? Are there any involved problems with a new drive and upgrading?\n\nA: Nope. While you've got to re-install the OS, now would be a great time to just do a clean install and use Migration Assistant from the old hard drive, using it as a pre-install \"backup\".\n\nA: Backup your old HD to Time Machine, and do a clean install.  Using the Migration Assistant to restore from your Time Machine.\nOr, install ML in your old HD, and use SuperDuper to restore the whole old HD to your new SSD.\nPrefer the 1st option.\n\nA: *\n\n*Install your SSD by following the copious amount of guides on the internet. \n\n*Download Carbon Copy Cloner. Select your magnetic drive as the source disk. Uncheck the “Users” folder. Select your SSD as the destination. Copy over the stuff.\n\n*Reboot while holding down the option key so that you can select the SSD as the boot volume.\n\n*It will start as a completely new install. Create a new user account with the same credentials as your old one.\n\n*Once logged in, go to System Preferences > Users and Groups > Right click on the current user > Advanced options > Home Directory. Choose your previous home directory on the magnetic disk.\n\n*Logout and Login and voila!\n\n\nA: Will you be installing your SSD in place of your existing HDD, or replacing the HDD with the SSD and replacing the optical drive with the HDD? (I chose the later on my 15\" MBP)\nMany SSDs come with a USB to SATA connector to allow cloning/copying of data. You can plug the new SSD in with this connector and install Mountain Lion straight on to this. Once that's done and it wants to reboot power down the system. Install your new SSD internally, and either replace your optical drive with the HDD, or connect your HDD to the USB connector, then boot up and hold the option key (alt) and select the SSD Mountain Lion drive, when it's finalising and asks you if you would like to migrate any data, you can select the HDD.\nOne other step you should do is enable TRIM if your drive supports it by following these steps (don't use the TRIM Enabler app as this is known to cause problems) http://digitaldj.net/2011/07/21/trim-enabler-for-lion/ which also works on Mountain Lion.\n", "Q: Google two-factor doesn't work on iPad after iPhone is set up Love the idea of two-factor auth and was pushed to do it finally by the issues that plagued the Gizmodo author.\nI enabled two-factor auth and it was all going really smoothly. I used Google Authenticator and two-factor setup to create some application-specific passwords, scan the Authenticator QR code with my iPhone to set it up, etc. etc.\nHowever, now my iPad is reporting that it can't connect to GMail via Google Sync (Exchange) on the iPad.\nI've taken the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Attempted to use an app-specific password.

It told me to use Google Authenticator to add my iPhone, but doesn't seem to an address an iDevice that isn't the primary device (i.e. Phone). I can't add an additional QR code as far as I can see.\n\n*I can't navigate to the App Store on my iPad because the google sync login window incessantly pops up.\n\n\nAny advice on how best to proceed from someone who activated his iPhone before an iPad?\nThe main thing I seem to be getting hung up on is that the process to connect the iPad is the same as the iPhone, except Google's process recommends adding an iPhone, and when I already have one and need to add an iPad, the only options I have are replace or remove.\n\nA: I have this set up on my iPad and iPhone. Google's site isn't very clear, and it's easy to get confused between the different elements of the two factor logins.\nIt sounds like what you're getting hung up on is the Google authenticator app. That's only used for logging in to Google's websites, it doesn't authenticate your iPhone/iPad for email access or anything else. For mail access, all you need (and the only thing that will work) are app specific passwords.\nHere's what I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to this page and generate an app-specific password. Label it iPhone Mail. (Doing this on the actual device is probably best, since you can copy/paste rather than manually copying from your Mac).\n\n*Open your iPhone Mail settings, and input the password you generated into your Gmail account settings.\n\n*Repeat for the iPad (creating a different app-specific password is highly recommended).\n\n\nThat should be all you need.\nI think the reason you had trouble with the authenticator on your iPad is that Google probably allows only one authenticator active at a time for security purposes. I'm not 100% sure on this, but it's my best guess. I'd suggest keeping it on whatever device you have with you more often (guessing that's your iPhone).\n", "Q: Keyboard Viewer via keyboard shortcut wont actually quit after closing it I managed to add a shortcut for keyboard viewer via BetterTouchTool.

According to Apple's page on Mountain Lion, the Mac App Store is supposed to send you notifications:\n\nMac App Store notifications\nThe Mac App Store notifies you when\nupdates are available for OS X or purchased apps.\n\nThis doesn't seem to be the case for me, as I have now opened the App Store twice to find updates (one for Day One, another to Xcode), having never received a notification for either. Does the App Store only notify about OS X updates, does this feature not actually function, or am I missing something?\n\nA: You need to have it set to \"Automatically download system updates\" in the software update panel of system preferences. I got a notification about the xcode update today.\n\nA: When new updates are available on the Mac App Store, it doesn’t notify you at first. It waits “for a while” and then downloads them in the background. This includes ALL updates. System updates, app updates, all of them. When the download is complete and ready to be installed, that’s when it notifies you.\n", "Q: MacBook Air display to external projector I have a new 2012 MacBook Air (just a week old).  Today I tried to connect to an external LCD projector, using a mini-DisplayPort-to-VGA adaptor, to project my slides.\nSomething went wrong and I was unable to project.  My Mac detected the external projector, and I was able to mirror my main display, but nothing showed up on the LCD projector, despite trying two different mini-DisplayPort-to-VGA dongles.  In the end, I was able to successfully project from a different, older Mac using one of those dongles, so I don't think the dongle is broken.\nWhat should be the troubleshooting procedure, if this happens again?  Does the new 2012 Air require any sort of different procedure or equipment for mirroring your display onto an external projector?\n\nA: In a pinch, this usually works:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect your computer to the projector and turn the projector on.\n\n*Restart your Mac.\n\n*It should now work.\n\n\nA: The recommendation I received was to open a call from \"bugreport.apple.com\" and hope that this is fixed in future updates of the operating system.\n\nA: Pressing CommandF3 should cause the display to show.\n\nA: I often encounter this problem. I found out that unplugging and reconnecting both the adapter from the MacBook and also from the projector cable makes the projection work again.\n\nA: Go to System Preferences >  Display > then click on Mirror.\n", "Q: Should I use the same Apple ID for iCloud and iTunes? Should I use the same Apple ID for iCloud and the iTunes store?\nMy immediate assumption was \"sure, of course, keep it simple\", but today I read the following recommendation:\n\nOne potential problem that users of Apple’s iCloud and other services can easily fall into is the overuse of a single account across the services used on their devices—for example, using the same Apple ID for both iCloud and the iTunes store. The iTunes store links your credit card data to your Apple ID for music and application purchases, as well as in-app purchases. It stores your contact information and address as well. So it’s a potential source of even bigger headaches if it’s exposed along with your iCloud account.\n\n... with the obvious implication that you should not use the same Apple ID for both iCloud and the iTunes store.  So, what is the best practice?  What are the tradeoffs?\nRelated: Are there disadvantages to using different Apple IDs for iCloud and Store purchases?; Is it a bad idea to have a shared Apple ID for purchases that also is used for iCloud?; How many Apple IDs should one household have?.  However, those questions do not address security concerns.\n\nA: In any of the common scenarios in which you store your Store credentials on devices under the control of others, it makes good security sense to have those be different from the ones you use for iCloud. \nFor example, it is common to share music among family members by using an Apple ID for purchases on all of the family's machines. If that Apple ID were the same as the one you used for iCloud, then (unless you can be sure that all family members have secured their machines) anyone who got his hands on one of those machines could potentially gain access to your e-mail, calendar, and documents (and, in typical configurations, could even log on to your machine if he had access to it).\n\nA: \nthe overuse of a single account\n\nThis is pure bs. It would be more of a headache to have to manage two accounts rather than one. Of course your stuff is saved either way, just make sure to vigiliant with your password (make it strong, and not 1234 or password or your name). \nJust make sure to log out of your account whenever your not using it (i.e. so another family member doesn't hop on and start to purchase items).\n", "Q: How to apply written defaults to a Magic Mouse (com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.mouse)?

For some browsers, like Firefox, folks have discovered ways to change this aspect of browser behavior and force the browser to remember your password, even on a site that uses autocomplete=off.  I know how to do it on Firefox, but that doesn't work on Safari. Yes, I do understand the security implications of doing this.\nHow do I make Safari remember my password for sites where autocomplete=off?\nReferences: \n\n\n*\n\n*http://randosity.wordpress.com/2012/04/16/stupid-security-measures-autocompleteoff/\n\n*http://www.howtogeek.com/62980/how-to-force-your-browser-to-remember-passwords/\n\n*http://lapcatsoftware.com/blog/2010/06/10/safari-extension-autocomplete/\n\nA: The \"autocomplete\" extension in the third link works for me.\nHere is a step-by-step recipe on how to install it, for others who may run into this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Safari.  In the menubar, click on Safari >> Preferences.  Under the Advanced pane, tick the box labelled \"Show Develop menu in menu bar\" at the bottom.\n\n*In the Safari menubar, you should now see Develop.  Click on Develop, then click on \"Enable Extensions\".\n\n*Download the extension from here: http://lapcatsoftware.com/downloads/autocomplete.safariextz\n\n*In your downloads folder, click on the file that you just downloaded.  Safari will ask you whether you want to install this extension.  Say yes.\nNow you're good to go!\n\nA: Did you test the extension for Safari which you can download on the bottom of the third URL cited above?\nhttp://lapcatsoftware.com/downloads/autocomplete.safariextz\nI can install it w/o any problems in Safari 5.1.7. under Snow Leopard but could not test it due to lack of a site which uses autocomplete=off\n\nA: Safari 7 allows overriding \"autocomplete\" in Password Preferences\n\n\nA: I use and recommend 1Password to store my passwords, but I've heard LastPass is another good password manager. Instead of storing your passwords in a single browser on a single computer, a password manager lets you use stored passwords in all of your browsers and syncs to all of your computers and devices (Mac, Win, iOS, Android). \nhttps://agilebits.com/onepassword\n\nA: I was able to successfully install the autocomplete script by Jeff Johnson (lapcatsoftware.com link above) on Safari 6 and it automatically filled in my credentials on the WHM control panel which was previously blocked.\n\nA: The bookmarklet in the second link (howtogeek.com link) doesn't work well for me.  The problem is you have to click the bookmarklet on the page everytime you want to log in (not just the first time you visit the page, but also every subsequent time you want it to fill in your password).  No good.\n\nA: I recommend using TapIN for that kind of sites. It's an alternative iOS excellent browser. \n\nA: Use Google chrome. It memorizes all passwords and auto fills them for you. Haven't gotten safari to do that for me on all the sites I want to yet. \n\nA: It is a bad idea to let your browser memorize all your password, especially the important ones.\nIt is easy to read stored passwords of any browser, even from Firefox password manager (https://www.raymond.cc/blog/how-to-find-hidden-passwords-in-firefox/#comment-645841)\nI would prefer to control which password is saved with my browser. But if you wanna stay really safe, use a password manager, online or offline.\nI'm using Limitlesslane, which provides autosave, autofill and autologin features through a browser extension, available for all major browsers (except IE)\n", "Q: does icloud sync cydia apps as well? Can you add an app downloaded from Cydia to iCloud, so it will sync to all your jailbroken iDevices? I wonder what content iCloud does sync and does not sync, is it folder specific?\n\nA: Simple answer: no. \nLong answer: it only works with Apple's own apps as well as apps downloaded from the official App Store. \n\nA: It's not folder specific, but it is app specific. iCloud syncs apps from the app store only. It also syncs documents (like pages and numbers files) and media (like photos).\n", "Q: *AMP setup Impact on upgrading from Snow Leopard to Mountain Lion I have Snow Leopard.

But after I click it and correctly enter my password it does not continue to download. Nothing happens. It just remains on the \"download\" button. I have installed every update imaginable, including Java and the latest Lion compatibilities, iTunes, everything from the App Store. I checked if my Macbook (2010) is compatible and it is, including the space on the harddrive, 64 bit etcetera. What could it be? Why is isn't it downloading?\n\nA: Try one of the following solutions: \n\n\n*\n\n*Quit the App Store and reboot your Mac. Most of the times, your problem will be solved.\n\n*Try again in 15 or 30 minutes. Sometimes, as large as the server farms might be, they simply can't handle the overload in request. Maybe later, there will be an open slot for you\n\n*Flush the cache of the App Store. Opeq Finder and use the \"Go to\" option to go to ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.appstore.

I received an email from cdhhospitals.org/upload.htm and opened it. I immediately was redirected to a waiting screen. I immediately closed the Safari app.  \nI tried to track this site down and the search states that this site may damage your computer.\nDid I expose myself to information-theft or anything alike? \n\nA: It appears the site is distributing malware. If you opened the page on your computer you should first install a good antivirus/antimalware program, try Sophos which is good and free. If it was on your iPad (as your tag suggests) there's probably a bit less cause for alarm as there is currently no known virus which can infect an iPad.\nNext it's probably a good idea to change all of your passwords, most importantly your AppleID as it stores your confidential information and credit card data. You can manage your apple id here.\n", "Q: How to use a custom text editor (like Emacs.app or MacVim) in Xcode 4? In Xcode 3 we could change file type settings, like indicated below:\n\nUsing External Text Editors with Xcode\nThere are lots of text editors available on Mac OS X. If you shelled\n  out good money for a text editor, you want to use it to edit your\n  source code instead of Xcode's editor. How do you tell Xcode to use\n  your desired text editor to edit your source code files?\nChoose Xcode > Preferences to open Xcode's preferences window. There\n  is a toolbar at the top of the window with many buttons. Click the\n  File Types button. From here you can assign the editor to use for lots\n  of file types.\nInitially there will be two items: file and folder. Click the\n  disclosure triangle next to file. Click the disclosure triangle next\n  to text because you're interested in text editing. The two most\n  interesting subcategories are sourcecode and scripts.\nWhen you come across a file type you want to edit with your text\n  editor, select the Preferred Editor column for that file type. A menu\n  will pop up. Choose External Editor. If your text editor does not\n  appear in the submenu, choose Other. Navigate to the location of your\n  text editor, and click the OK button. Repeat these steps for every\n  file type you want to edit with your text editor.\nNow when you double-click a source code file in Xcode's project\n  window, it will open in your text editor.\n\nBut there are no settings for using external editor with Xcode 4.\nIs there any way to use custom text editors with Xcode (such as Emacs.app or MacVim)?\n\nA: There is not really a setting with in Xcode 4 to configure external editors as there use to be in Xcode 3. \nThe workaround is to set up your preferred text editor to open the file types that you want.  And then right click on a source file in Xcodes Project Navigator and select \"Open with External Editor...\"\nThis suggestion of using \"Open with External Editor...\" at first will probably just open in Xcode a standalone window, since by default Xcode will probably be set to the default application for opening programming source files.  \nSet up your preferred application/s to open source files with. \nFor example for each kind of source files such as .c .h .m you want to edit in your preferred editor. Open a Finder Window/s that contains each type of file you want to set your preferred editor for.\n\n\n*\n\n*Right click on a source file\n\n*Select \"Get Info\"\n\n*Expand the \"Open With:\" section and select your preferred text editor to something other than Xcode.\n\n*Press the Change All... button.\nNow when you select \"Open with External Editor...\" in Xcode it should open the source file in your preferred external editor. \n", "Q: In full-screen mode, Chrome only sometimes reveals tabs -- why? In full-screen mode, Chrome reveals all open tabs when you move your mouse to the top of the screen. Except when it doesn't. Sometimes clicking on the content of the currently open tab seems to jolt Chrome and make it start noticing the mouse-to-screen-top movements, sometimes I have to do Command-L to reveal the search/URL bar to force the tabs to show. \nAnyone else have this problem? Am I doing something wrong? Is this just a bug?  \n\nA: Make sure \"Always Show Toolbar in Full Screen\" is enabled under \"View\" when Chrome is open.\n\nA: No, it's not just you, no, you're not doing anything wrong, and yes, it seems to be just a bug.\nI had exactly the same problem. When this happens, using Command-L or any tab-related shortcut (opening, closing, switching, etc.) will reveal all open tabs, but sometimes they disappear immediately, and sometimes they don't.\nFrom what I can tell, both the bar refusing to reveal and the bar refusing to stay visible once it does while in Presentation Mode are completely random. However, this issue appears to have been fixed in recent updates, because I haven't noticed it happening to me in a long time.\nIf it's still an issue, the topic Frustrating Show/Hide Tab Bar Behavior in Presentation Mode on Google Product Forums may be of use.\nIf I notice it happening to me again I'm going to try the solution linked. I'll update on whatever the result is.\n\nA: I had similar problem but not exactly as yours.. In my case, sometimes in full screen mode of chrome and safari, the address bar and tabs bar was autohide enabled and sometimes it was not. After searching google I found the keyboard shortcut (command + shift + F) for switching applications to full screen mode, when I switch chrome to fullscreen from normal mode using this shortcut the tabs bar and address bar hides automatically. \n", "Q: Python stopped working after Mountain Lion upgrade I upgraded my Mac from Lion to Mountain Lion and ever since then, Python stopped working.\nSo I re-installed Python and his setup-tools. Now everything seems to work fine except for iPython. iPython requires readline, which in his turn requires the Mac OSX 10.6 SDK. \nHow can I install the MacOSX 10.6 SDK in my current confuguration (Mountain-Lion)?\nOr is there an alternative solution to get things working again?\n\nA: MacOSX SDK 10.6 is a component of Xcode. It is at least available in Xcode version 3.2.6.\nXcode is available for download from Apple after registration as a software developer.\nThe file is named MacOSX10.6.pkg and is located in the /Volumes/Xcode and iOS SDK/Packages folder.\n", "Q: No sound and volume icon I have a Mac mini and the sound has disappeared.  I have also lost the sound icon off the toolbar.  I went to preferences for the sound and see that mute is checked.  I can't un-check it because it is in gray-scale.  Any ideas?\n\nA: Try to open the system preferences then click sound,on the sound you can see the Internal Microphone below the Name,on the lower,beneath the output you can see the Show Volume in Menu Bar,you can put some check on it and everything's gonna be alright :)\n\nA: I had it once before. You should check your audio-input. Good chances there is a red light inside your input. \nInside your audio jack, there is some kind of spring which controls your output (internal speakers or headphones). And for some reason, this switch inside the audio jack is stuck. Try using a toothpick (if you dare) and try to unlock the quill. \nIf using a toothpick did not work, you need to take the computer in for service, because there is probably something wrong with your I/O board.\nIf there is no red-light, my answer expires. \nAbout the disappearing of the icon in the menu-bar, you should try and reset your PRAM.\n", "Q: How do I add all Tweets to the Mountain Lion Notification Center? I love the Notification center gesture and would love to be able to glance at my full Twitter stream that way. How can I put all of Twitter into that notification area?\n\nA: You can get the home timeline from the Twitter API and display tweets using terminal-notifier.\n#!/usr/bin/env ruby -KU -rubygems\n\nrequire 'twitter'\nrequire 'cgi'\n\nTwitter.configure do |config|\n  config.consumer_key = \"\"\n  config.consumer_secret = \"\"\n  config.oauth_token = \"\"\n  config.oauth_token_secret = \"\"\nend\n\ntimeline = Twitter.home_timeline\nfirst = timeline.first.id\nprevious = `defaults read me.lri.scripts nctwitter 2> /dev/null`.chomp\nminid = previous == \"\" ? 0 : previous.to_i + 1\n`defaults write me.lri.scripts nctwitter #{first}`\n\ntimeline.each do |tweet|\n  break if tweet.id <= minid\n  system(\"terminal-notifier\", \"-message\", CGI.unescapeHTML(tweet.text),\n  \"-title\", tweet.user.screen_name)\n  # system(\"/usr/local/bin/growlnotify\", \"-t\", tweet.user.screen_name,\n  # \"-m\", CGI.unescapeHTML(tweet.text))\nend\n\ngrowlnotify would stack multiple notifications and not clip the text in long tweets.\nThe Twitter library can be installed with sudo gem install twitter.\nYou can run the script every minute by editing the crontab with EDITOR=nano crontab -e and adding a line like * * * * * ~/bin/nctwitter.\n\nA recent update to Tweetbot added an option to send notifications for all tweets:\n\n\nA: You can’t get your Twitter stream in the Notification Center. Only those tweets that someone sends to you or those of the people you follow are sent to the Notification Center.\n\nA: You could also use the Growl app which will show all tweets you are interested in.\n", "Q: Jailbroken iPhone, iOS 5.1.1 suddenly has new diagnostic apps I jailbroke my iPhone so that I could make use of the F.lux app which allows me to sort of dim my screen with an orange hue so that I could read on a flight I took recently without annoying other passengers. I'm home now, though, so I don't mine un-jailbreaking.\nWith that out of the way, here's what's happened. A few days ago I was reading and my phone froze for a moment and the new voicemail popup appeared and told me that I had 2 new voicemails, which I didn't have, and then the camera light turned on and stayed on. So I rebooted the phone and it was fine. But now, moments ago, 4 new apps appeared, seemingly at random, on the home screen - AdSheet, FieldTest, iOS Diagnostics, and Setup. All 4 of them have blank, white icons.\nShould I be concerned about a possible security breach of my phone or is this some of the unexpected behavior that one could expect once they jailbreak?\nAlso, I applied the PDF fix from Cydia and changed my SSH password immediately after jailbreaking. I don't know if that info is important, but is given here for completeness.\n\nA: This bug occasionally happens to me when I install new apps or update existing ones. All the apps you've listed are built into the phone, but do not have icons by default. Respringing or restarting the phone always works to rehide them. Have you tried that yet?\n\nA: Libhide my friend... I disabled this MobileSubstrate add on and put those icons into a unused folder. Even after updating lib hide, I still had that issue.\n", "Q: Can the alert sound in Mountain Lion's notification center be customized? Is there a way to change the default \"Basso\" alert sound in Mountain Lion's Notification Center?  What I'd really like is support for application-specific notification sounds, so I can tell without looking at the screen whether a notification is from, say Mail vs. iCal.  Is this possible, and if so, is it something the application controls or NC controls?  If not, at least the ability to change the sound from Basso to something else would be an improvement.\n\nA: An even better Idea is to got to ~/Library/Sounds and create a sound file with the same name as Basso.aiff and it will supersede Basso without the need for deleting a system sound file.  \n\nA: Unfortunately, no, you can’t specify different Notification sounds for different apps. That’s the job of the app developer, just like on iOS. There is no “default” sound in Notification Center. It’s all app specific. It’s just that Calendar and Reminders use it for their Notifications. If you don’t like the Basso sound:\n 1. Go to /System/Library/Sounds.\n 2. Delete the “Basso.aiff” file.\n 3. Make a copy of the alert sound you want.\n 4. Rename the copy to “Basso.aiff.”\n 5. This will make all apps that use Basso for Notification Center play your chosen sound instead.\nP.S. Basso is a really awful sound effect\n\nP.P.S. You'll need to restart your Mac for the changes to take effect.\n\nA: In System Preferences, select Sound (on the far right-hand side under Hardware) and then click the Sound Effects tab, if necessary. From there, you can select a different alert sound. Unfortunately, you can only select one sound for all alerts.\n\nA: An earlier post suggested deleting Basso.aiff and replacing it with a copy of another sound renamed \"Basso.aiff\". A safer alternative to deleting Basso is to rename it to something else (like \"Basso-BACKUP.aiff\"). That way, if you ever decide you want to get the sound back, it's not gone forever. Or you could make a backup copy of it in some other directory.\n", "Q: Being asked to log into a different account on Mac App Store? Just recently I'm being asked by the Mac App Store to log into a different account to update my apps. I've never had a second Apple ID and this computer has always belonged to me, meaning there's never been another account logged into this Mac. Screenshot of the message attached.\n\n\nYou have updates available for other accounts\nTo update this application, sign in to the account you used to purchase it.\n\nI've tried signing out and logging back in, but to no avail. I had to remove Xcode and install it from scratch for it to work, but I don't want to do that with every app.\nAny ideas? :(\n\nA: To make the AppStore forget the old credentials with which an app was downloaded, remove the _MASReceipt directory in the app itself.\nTo do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Finder and navigate to Applications.\n\n*Ctrl+Click the application and choose \"Show Package Contents\".\n\n*Expand the Contents directory and click the _MASReceipt directory to select it.\n\n*Type Command+Delete to delete the directory permanently---you will be prompted for your credentials since this is a protected file.\n\n\nQuit and restart AppStore, then find the application.  The button should now say \"Free\" or \"Install\" instead of \"Update\".  Clicking it will update your app to the latest version, doing so as the currently logged-in Apple user.\nThis can also be a temporary issue and it can clear up over time once the servers recover from some overload conditions.\n\nA: I had the same issue and neither repairing permissions nor resetting SpotLight did anything to fix it.\nIf no email address is present in the error, the message means that it thinks that you purchased the app while logged into a different local account on your computer and the App Store does not have write permissions to update it.\nIt seems that something got messed up on my machine, because I only use a single local account, so I checked the permissions on Xcode.app and had to add my current local account with Read & Write access.\nOnce I had done that, I could then update XCode through the App Store.\n\nA: If you've loaded apps that were purchased with other Apple IDs, this is the screen that you get. (try it:))\nSo for example, if a friend gave you a copy of their app, and an update appears, you would need to log in with your friend's ID to update that app. \nIf they are legitimately yours, You can delete them from your computer, and then go to AppStore > purchases, and download them again..\nHope this helps.\n\nA: This can also happen when spotlight indexing is broken, so it might help to try rebuilding the spotlight index (sudo mdutil -E /) before reinstalling a large app like Xcode.\n\nA: Trivial \"fix\" in my case. In Applications folder, my Xcode install was named \"Xcode.app\" ... Renamed it to \"Xcode 4.app\" and suddenly AppleStore allowed me to update it.\n\nA: In my case I was able to do the first part (delete the file within the application's package contents), but there is no option for me to login with my new account, and I must, since I actually purchased the app with the other login. \nNow, when I go to the app center, and search for the app in question, as well as click it to update, it simply says I've already installed this application on this computer, and asks if I'm sure I want to purchase it again. It doesn't offer an \"update\" option.  \nI can't seem to find where to \"login\" to a new account through the app store. \n", "Q: X11 Forwarding with my Entire Screen I am able to ssh to my Linux computer which is on the same network as my Mac. From the Linux machine, I can ssh to my Macbook.\nI am currently at work and I want to forward my Mac's display to the Windows machine that I am currently on (using Putty and Xming). I am able to run \"Xeyes &\" so I know that the X11 forwarding is working correctly.\nHow can I forward my entire screen, preferably without having to setup VNC? And remember, I only have access to the command line.\n\nA: This isn't how X11 works on the Mac currently (or at any time in the past).\nThe native Mac window manager uses Quartz 2D and Core Graphics to accomplish the rendering and composting of windows and icons on the Mac screen.\nX11 writes into that space as a consumer - not as the end-all provider of drawing services so it can't forward things it doesn't get to see.\nYou will want to set up VNC sharing (which is the native Mac screen sharing technology) if you can't get by with just forwarding the X11 graphics.\n\nA: You can run a VNC session through ssh. \nConnect to the remote system from Terminal:\nssh -Y -g -l username -C -L 5901:localhost:5901 remote_hostname\n\nStart VNC server on the remote system. The above assumes your server starts on display port 1.\nLaunch a VNC viewer on your local system and enter the connection information. In this example you would use 'localhost' for 'Host', and '5901' for your port.\n", "Q: OS X 10.8, unsigned application: reset open confirmation When I try to open an unsigned application by double clicking it in OS X 10.8's Finder, it rejects it.

For the past few days the brightness always resets to full on boot up and just when the spinning wheel stops loading (before desktop loads), it dims automatically to the level I've set it at.\nThe brightness level is sometimes maintained during boot up but its very sporadic. \nI've already tried resetting SMC and PRAM but neither seems to have helped.\nI thought my new Mountain Lion install had something to do with it so I reinstalled Snow Leopard but the issue still persists. \nWhat could possibly be the issue? Any help will be appreciated.\n\nA: I've also noticed that my Macbook Pro boot sequence only occasionally ups the brightness to full when rebooting. (However, I reboot so rarely that I don't really mind.) I thought it was just me! I'm running OSX Lion (10.7.4), btw.\nI like the suggested answer that the user preference value isn't read soon enough, but I suspect that the issue is that the appropriate driver isn't loaded until the last moment. From what I understand, the user prefs would be readable at any time during the boot sequence (assuming the root/boot disk volume is mounted, anyway), but if the driver isn't loaded, the value wouldn't be applied. That would account for the display being really bright for some time, but it doesn't explain the occasional (for me, about every second bootup) dimmer value.\nOf course, if the dimmer code is part of the BIOS, that's completely wrong, and it probably would be down to when the user prefs were read and fed to the driver!\nThe strange unpredictable behaviour may depend on what sequence of events occurs when shutting down; it's possible (though not probable) that in some situations, the brightness register isn't reset when shutting down. This probably wouldn't happen if the machine was off for some hours/days/weeks. It would be interesting to see if there's a pattern to the behaviour though!\nIt might be possible to re-order the sequence so that the display brightness setting is applied sooner rather than later, but it will still be some number of clock cycles between the LED backlight being turned on and the appropriate driver load/preference read.\n\nA: This appears to be just how it works, unfortunately. The best solution I can come up with is to not ever shut your Mac down so you don't have to deal with an over-bright screen on bootup. \nMy Mountain Lion (previously Lion) MacBook Air does this too: full brightness on the login screen, then it dims after login. The cause is probably that the brightness preference is stored in the user account's settings, which can't be read until the user logs in. \n", "Q: AirPort doesn't find any networks I have a 13'' MacBook Pro from early 2011. Suddenly it can't find any WiFi Networks anymore. It used to find networks (including mine) at my home, but now it doesn't.\nI cant remember when this happened, most of the time i'm using ethernet.\nI installed all updates, repaired the permissions, tried do de/activate Airport, deleted\n /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.airport.preferences.plist\n /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/NetworkInterfaces.plist\n /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.network.identification.plist\n\nrebootet several times. Still no wifi.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: If your Mac is capable of running internet recovery, I would boot to the Recovery HD or full on internet recovery to see if the OS is the culprit.\nIf you can't join any networks from recovery HD it's very likely a hardware or severe interference issue is at play. At that point, you could take your Mac to one or two different networks that are known to work with Macs and test.\nBeing able to isolate the major systems helps when it's hard to guess what is happening.\n\nA: have you tried reseting the PRAM and SMC?\nHowto:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT3964\nand\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ht1379\n", "Q: Using iCloud at work and privacy What is the best way of using iCloud at work, and retaining privacy?\nI have work computer, an iMac. Management requires the login password to be known, so that others can use the computer when I am away. That's fair, they bought it. But I want to use my personal iCloud account.\nWhat's the best way of doing this while retaining privacy? Once I have logged in to iCloud, in System Preferences, it seems like anyone could turn on Bookmarks, Photo Stream etc without even asking for my iCloud login.\n\nA: Is there anything stopping you from creating a separate user account for others to use in the office?\nBy explaining that the Mac might expose personal information due to the Apple ID on your user account, they should accept that there's a security risk to you if you allow everyone access on that account.\nAlternatively, you could try to remember to sign out of iCloud each time you leave, however that wouldn't delete content stored locally already.\n\nA: Which features of iCloud do you want to utilize? You may just be able to access them via http://icloud.com in the browser.\n\nA: Simply, iCloud should not be used at a job that is under any regulation.  What is your need to be using iCloud at work?  I'd find another solution to meet your needs.  Maybe a new user is a good idea?  Sharing work documents in a designated folder may be a good solution.\n", "Q: Toggle the keyboard language by *holding* a button? On my Linux computer, my keyboard switches from English to Serbian when I hold the Caps Lock key. For example, to write č all I have to do is hold Caps Lock, and press the key where č is on the Serbian keyboard (in this case, they key is ; on the English keyboard). When I release Caps Lock, the keyboard  \"switches back\" to English, so that if I press ; I get ; as desired. Super useful.\nIs there a way to replicate this behavior on OS X?\n\nA: You can use KeyRemap4MacBook:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<root>\n  <vkchangeinputsourcedef>\n    <name>KeyCode::VK_CHANGE_INPUTSOURCE_SERBIAN</name>\n    <inputsourceid_equal>com.apple.keylayout.Serbian</inputsourceid_equal>\n  </vkchangeinputsourcedef>\n  <item>\n    <name>test</name>\n    <identifier>test</identifier>\n    <autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::F1, KeyCode::VK_NONE, Option::KEYTOKEY_BEFORE_KEYDOWN, KeyCode::VK_CHANGE_INPUTMODE_SERBIAN, Option::KEYTOKEY_AFTER_KEYUP, KeyCode::VK_CHANGE_INPUTMODE_ENGLISH</autogen>\n  </item>\n</root>\n\nVK_CHANGE_INPUTMODE_ENGLISH is defined in inputsourcedef.xml. You can see the IDs of input sources from EventViewer.app. Caps lock can be remapped to an F-key with PCKeyboardHack.\n\nA: If you're on 10.7 Lion or newer, you can also press the c key down until it shows a list of all c characters with various decorations.\n\nA: You can easily switch from the Serbian keyboard to the US keyboard or vice versa by pressing Command-Space. To set this up:\nGo to System Preferences..., Language & Text, Input Sources, and select both the Serbian and English keyboard layouts. Select the check box next to  Show Input menu in menu bar. Make sure that under Input source shortcuts that Select previous input source: is set to Command-Space.\nThis is all you need to do.\n\n\nA: The Alt key gives you access to a number of non ascii characters that depend on the layout you use.\nOn a standard US keyboard, pressing Alt+underbar creates a \" ` \" under which the vowel you'll type after will come: \" à \" if I type Alt+underbar followed by a.\nIn your case, the US Extended layout will give you access to all the accents that you need to use in Serbian. For ex, Alt+v followed by c will give you č.\nYou need to keep the Keyboard Viewer opened to get used to the various possible modifications but once you get the set that is used in your language you won't need it anymore.\n", "Q: Mountain Lion Share Sheet Keyboard Shortcuts? Using the Keyboard Preference Pane, I've assigned shortcuts to the items in the share sheet in the Finder. Command-Option-Control-M for \"Email\" and Command-Option-Control-C for Message. The keyboard shortcuts actually get listed next to those commands when I click on the share sheet. \n\nBut they don't actually work. I've tried relaunching Finder and restarting, but to no avail. Any ideas to kickstart these commands, or is it just a glitch that they even appear in the menu?\n\nA: Though these actions can be given shortcuts for All Applications, it does not  appear that they will work in all apps. For example, Finder and Safari will not recognize them, but Preview will. I'm not sure if this is the intended functionality—due to some of the applications having application-specific sharing options—or a bug.\n\nA: It only works if you highlight the file as text selection, not as file selection. So it grabs the name of the file into Apple Mail instead of a whole file attachment. It looks like a bug and I don't think Apple intends to have it working that way. I had submitted the bug to Apple and hope they fix this issue on the next update.\n\nA: The same thing happens with other more exotic menu items:\n\nThe custom shortcuts are shown next to their titles, but only work in some cases like if the menus are expanded.\nSo it's probably just a glitch.\n", "Q: How to use LaunchPad and Mission Control on Mountain Lion with an external keyboard I am using an external (generic) keyboard.\nI just switched from Snow Leopard to Mountain Lion.\nOn Snow Leopard, I could pull up Expose by pressing F2 on my external keyboard, but now I can't.\nIs there a FN key (or a way to enable the right FN key) to show \"Mission Control\"?\n\nA: Open System Preferences and click on \"Mission Control\".

Does anybody know a way to sleep the Thunderbolt display if I don't need it for a short time? Like if I'm going to watch TV, normally I've just got my MacBook Pro's display turned on, while my old external then got turned off.\nI'd like to do the same with the Thunderbolt display - to sleep it, or at least turn off the display, but still keep the screen on in my MacBook Pro.\nI don't care if I need to use a program or something to do so. I would just like to be able to actually sleep the Thunderbolt display because there's no power off button.\n\nA: SwitchResX lets you disable an unused display via a handy menubar item (bottom of page). This should cause your Thunderbolt Display to sleep.\n\nA: Unplug the thunderbolt display cable from your macbook.\n\nA: I don't know how to put just one display to sleep, but you could put both of them to sleep by pressing control-shift-eject. On 10.8, the power key can be substituted for eject on laptops without an eject key.\nYou could also try decreasing the display sleep times in the energy saver preferences.\n", "Q: How can I track my stolen iPhone 4S phone? My iPhone 4S was stolen and I reported it to the police and my network. \nBy my iCloud account through Find My iPhone, I had request for remote locking. I don't know if the remote locking worked because I didn't get any mail.\nAfter 1 week when I checked my iCloud account again, I saw contacts that I don't know and there are none of my previous contacts. (How is it possible if it's my iCloud account?). \nHow can I track my stolen iPhone 4S phone?\n\nA: It sounds like whoever has your phone hasn't bothered (most likely doesn't know how to) to change the Apple ID and has entered their own contacts in. You should take this information to the police. \nThen check if there's a contact labelled \"Mum\", call the persons mother and tell them that their child is a thief :-)\nBest of luck!\n\nA: Someone can easily change contacts by opening the Contacts app or just using the phone app. Because you have iCloud enabled, this will sync all those contacts to the cloud. However, in order for it to sync to iCloud, it must have (had) a interent connection. \nThe other way for someone to change contacts would be if they knew your Apple ID password. It sounds like that is not likely in this situation, but it would be possible. For good safe measure, I would log in, and change your Apple ID password immediately. That gives you hopefully another safety buffer.\nI would immediately also go in and try to locate and/or lock the device (again). It is very easy to turn off FMI services on the device (note that if they were to do that, they probably would have wiped the device already or done something similar. Still faster may be better for you). If you can get a location from the phone (log into www.icloud.com, select Find my iPhone), you will likely be able to lock it right away. If you can't get a location, it will try to lock it next time the device comes online. By the way, if you remotely wipe the device, you will no longer be able see or lock your phone. When you lock your phone, make sure the Email when Found switch is set to On. (I just tested sending a message to my iPhone in airplane mode. When I turned Airplane mode back off, it immediately sent my \"Test\" message and emailed me that the device had been found.)\nIt would likely be a very good idea to get as many of the contacts as possible and give them to the police. Depending on the type of person that stole your phone, this could be very helpful. You could also look through and see if any of the contacts have your iPhone's number there. That very well could be the thief's name (they would have to do this to use Siri efficiently).\n", "Q: Dock - app name instead of icons?

Are there drivers, kernel extensions, or hacks to fool the OS as to what machine it's running on that would let it use the external Superdrive?\n\nA: You can edit a plist file by following the instructions found here to enable it on your system, however be aware you won't be able to boot from it (such as installing an OS via CD/DVD at boot).\nI have no idea why Apple place the limitations on things like this, other than the potential that it makes things difficult for people (such as myself) who want to stray from normal configurations by installing two hard drives rather than a hard drive and optical drive in their systems. By making it difficult for the masses, they create a more stable experience overall as they have more control over the default configurations.\nIt's a combination of the firmware on the device, and the plist file which tells the OS whether to recognise the device. There's something in the EFI which prevents it working at boot level though which I don't know enough about to provide further information on though.\n\nA: I just got off the phone with apple as we had a new 27\" iMac built from the ground up. It won't be here until sometime in January. I was worried about it not having a drive for such thing so I went and bought the new USB SuperDrive. I got it from best buy which they currently have it on sale for $69.99, $10 less than retail. After buying it and reading all kinds of things saying the USB SuperDrive isn't compatible with the new iMacs I decided to call apple. I found out that the new USB SuperDrives are compatible with the new iMacs. They have to be the new updated SuperDrive to go along with the new iMacs but they said its 100% compatible!

Take a look at this video and How to record both screen and sound with Quicktime on El Capitan?\n\nA: To answer your P.S.: Picture-in-picture videos are done with third-party software. A free option for this on Mac is OBS, which is primarily intended for live streaming to gaming sites, but does allow offline recording too. In my experience, it can be a little tricky to set up. \nReputable paid options include Screenflow and Camtasia, which are far more polished but can only be used for offline recording.\n\nA: This is a Youtube video I produced on how to do it entirely for free: record CPU audio as well as Mic Audio while doing a screen capture.  You'd think that it would be a standard feature...\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lB9Ovqk5H5c\nIt should work just fine!\nGood Luck\n\nA: Theres a few youtube videos that show you how to do this (as best it can) with quick time, heres a good one.\nQuicktime is far from the best screen recording software though, and it won't give you the picture in picture you're looking for.

I recently found out that VMware Fusion, Parallels, and Boot Camp are the best ways to get Windows running well.\nI want to use windows mainly for Steam related games, and some other applications not available on OS X.\nThe question is: which one is the best and most reliable? I really want something that is easy to use, install, and uninstall (if needed).\nI'm running Mountain Lion, if it makes a difference.\n\nA: I recommend Parallels 7. I have run any number of games (Both Steam-based and not) this way. Call of Duty: Black Ops and Modern Warfare 3, Blacklight: Retribution, World of Tanks, Diablo III, World of Warcraft and others all run with no problems. It's not going to be as fast as running native code, but it's about as good as you can get. Run the VM in fullscreen (and make sure you're using the discrete graphics card if you're using gfxCardStatus!) for best results. Boot Camp obviously will give you the best performance, but I hate dual booting and refuse to do it.

My main problems is these other applications). ))\nEarlier in the day I successfully ran StarCraft 2 and a different game launcher. I also used Safari successfully. StarCraft 2 had an update for Macs today that appeared to prevent HotCorners from working at all while SC2 is the active application, whereas they normally worked fine while running SC2 in windowed mode (before today). \nThe SC2 mac-specific updates were defined as:\n\n\n*\n\n*Command-click now properly issues a right-click command to the game.\n\n*Enabling the “Disable OS Keyboard shortcuts” option no longer causes a system hang on exit.\n\n\nI'm not sure if this is important, but it was the only significant thing that happened prior to the topical error.

I live in Norway so I have my iPad 2 language set to Norwegian.\nMost of the books I read in iBooks are english. The dictionary is English which is great, however I often try to look up words that are not part of the dictionary. I am then provided with a \"search on Wikipedia\" option. \nUnfortunately this option uses no.wikipedia.org (Norwegian Wikipedia). I wonder if there is a way to change which Wikipedia version iBooks uses? (Without changing the language of the device.)\n\nA: Yes there is, although you have to modify the iPad's files, so you either have to jailbreak your iPad, then use an app called iFile (paid with a free trial) or openSSH (free but more complicated - I used iFile), or find some way to modify your files without a jailbreak.\nAn explanation\niOS apps store data on \"property list\" files. To localise an app they have a property list file that stores all the stuff in the app that they want to change, and what to change it to. The one we are interested in has a field dealing with the Wikipidea search URL, all we have to do is change that URL to go to the English Wikipidea instead of the Norwegian one.\nSteps (note that I am using iFile)\n\n\n*\n\n*Using your chosen file manager navigate to /var/mobile/Applications\n\n*You should see the names of your apps as well as some random characters, if you only see the random characters then click the settings button (bottom left), go to preferences and turn on \"App names\"\n\n*Scroll down until you see the \"iBooks\" folder\n\n*In the iBooks folder, click \"iBooks.app\"\n\n*Scroll down until you see the folder \"no.lproj\" - this is the Norwegian language folder\n\n*Click on the file \"Localizable.strings\" open it with the property list viewer - this is the main file that deals with localisation\n\n*Scroll down to near the bottom until you find the field called \"Search_Wikipidea_URL\", tap on it\n\n*You should see a text box with the URL \"http://%2$@.wikipedia.org/wiki/%1$@\", change it to \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%1$@\"\n\n*Click \"Done\", then exit iFile\n\n*That's it!\n\n\nNow to test it go to iBooks. When you search Wikipidia it will show the English version. I tested this on my iPod (yes, I put my iPod into Norwegian!) and it worked, so if you have a problem and want me to post pictures for the steps then just leave a comment!\n", "Q: How does the Finder refresh in OS X Mountain Lion?

The highlight function in the Mountain Lion version of Preview.app is now directly accessible from the toolbar, while the other annotation functions keep their usual location. The problem is that Apple reduced the number of colours for the highlighting function. For example, red and orange are missing. The number of colours stays the same for the other annotation functions.\nI work with scientific articles on a daily basis and the highlighting function is my main tool. I really need all the colours that were available since Apple introduced PDF highlighting several years ago, because I follow a colour scheme to quickly distinguish different parts of an article. I do not understand why they removed these colours, It's not like a few menu items were bloating the software. At least one other person is in my case: http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1416813\nI tried reverting to Lion's Preview.app, but Apple has disabled Lion's applications on ML and I get an error message when I try to open it. In the past, one could run SL's Preview.app on Lion in order to circumvent the \"highlights fading bug\".\nTherefore, I'm looking for either one of two solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*getting all the colours back in the highlighting function;\n\n*or getting Lion's Preview.app to run on ML.\n\n\n(Skim is not a solution because it stores the highlights in another file and I need my PDFs to be transportable.)\n\nA: You can reinstall and use the version of Preview.app from Lion.\nInstructions are here (start with post #8 and move forward from there)\nhttp://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1412516\nHere are some of the salient parts, in case the link breaks. I'm just quoting text from the poster on the linked thread:\n\nThe Lion Preview.app seems to be blacklisted in ML through the \"Bundle\n  version=719.25\" entry in the Info.plist. So I changed it to something\n  higher (760 in this case - 765 is the version-number from ML\n  Preview.app). Now the app fails to start, because modifying the\n  plist-file apparently broke the signing. Then I resigned it using this\n  command: \ncodesign --force --sign - Preview.app/Contents/MacOS/Preview\n\n\nThe linked post also contains a link to a downloadable version of Lion Preview that has presumably been modified as described. I have downloaded it and it works perfectly.\n\nA: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4145911?start=0&tstart=0\nMost suitable answer seems to be in the above link. Select the underline tool. Hit Cmd + T, which will bring up the font box. Select the Font Colour button, select the colour you want and you're done - it should now underline in that colour\n\nA: I found a workaround. Not convenient at all but it works.\nIt involves using Adobe Reader (AR) to edit the annotations made with Preview. With AR, you can export annotation data to a FDF textfile. You can then edit this file to get your annotations back to how they were in the older versions of Preview.app.\nIn ML's Preview, there are four colours that were removed (red, orange, black, grey), and one added (rose). There are also the underlining and the strikeout annotations. So you can use either of these last three tools (rose highlighting, underlining, strikeout), to annote your PDFs, instead of your usual highlight colours. Then you change them to how they should be by editing the appropriate FDF file.\nFor example, I need red and orange highlightings. I will temporarily use rose highlight for red, and underline for orange. When I am finished annotating my PDF, I open it with AR. I export all highlights to a FDF file. In this file, I replace the rose colour code with the red one. I then export all underlines to another FDF. I replace the red colour code with the orange one and I replace the underline markup with the highlight one. I then erase all annotations from the PDF file and import the two FDFs.\nColour codes :\nRed :       /C[0.9935237 0.694295 0.5490015]\nOrange :    /C[0.9962542 0.8236187 0.5058712]\nRose :      /C[0.9215688 0.4980392 0.7294117]\n\nAnnotation codes :\nHighlight :     /Subtype/Highlight\nUnderline :     /Subtype/Underline\nStrikeout :     /Subtype/StrikeOut\n\nThis procedure is tedious so other solutions are still welcome.\n\nA: I share your disappointment that the change to Preview.app has taken away the ability to select a highlight color from the color picker.\nI have requested that Apple add it back at http://www.apple.com/feedback/macosx.html.\nFor me, reinstalling the old Preview is the interim solution.\n\nA: You can change the color of the highlighter by clicking on the markup highlighter icon then press ⌘T and this will open the fonts panel. If you then click on the text color icon this will bring up the color palette and whichever color you pick will be the color of your highlight!\nHappy highlighting! \n\nA: Click Highlight - Type control + T (brings up \"Font\") - Click \"Font Color\" (letter T with color at side) (Brings up font color) - Click Palette - choose any color and proceed to highlight\nIf you keep the the Font Window and Color window open (at side of document window) - you can quickly change colours by re-clicking \"Font Color\" and then choosing new color from 2nd window showing font color.\nBeing forced to do it this way - actually gives me more colors to highlight than previous version of preview.\nHope this helps\n", "Q: Faulty power button on an iphone 3g and upgrade to 4.1 I have a jailbroken 3.1.3 iPhone 3G with a faulty power button.

I have a desktop PC with a pretty small hard drive.  I bought an external hard drive with 500GB of space and now use that for all of my pictures, music, etc.  Its almost full.\nI am now in the process of buying a laptop and I am considering an Apple laptop.  The one issue I have is trying to figure out how I would access all of my content that I mentioned above.\n\nA: It depends on the file system used by your external hard drive. Most likely, the file system is FAT which allows both Mac and PC to read from and write to it, so you would be fine to just plug it into your Mac. \nIt could however be NTFS which is Microsoft file system that PCs can read and write to but Macs can only read. In this case, you'll still be able to read all of the files on the drive and copy them to your Mac, you just win't be able to add any more files or alter the files while they're still on the drive.\nTo tell what file system the drive is, just right-click it in Windows and select Properties, the file system should be shown in the General tab.\nIf the drive is NTFS you have a few options: \n\n\n*\n\n*You could format the drive to FAT32 or exFAT.\n\n*You could install Paragon NTFS on your Mac which allows you to write to NTFS drives.\n\n*You could share wirelessly from your Windows machine. You'll have to Google this yourself as it's different for each version of Windows and you haven't said which version you're using, but it's fairly easy.\n\n\nA: Assuming your desktop PC runs Windows, you can share the drive from Windows and connect it it from your Mac.\n\nA: Sharing it is easy, as mentioned above.  Or if your drive is FAT32, and not NTFS, your Mac should be able to mount and read it without a problem.  That is, if no files are wicked large (over 4GB).\n\nA: If you are moving from a PC to a Mac just unplug your external hard drive from the PC and plug it into the Mac. Chances are your drive is FAT formatted which can be read just fine with your Mac. \n", "Q: Is there a way to access a Mac's geolocation from terminal?

Recently, I have acquired a MacBook Pro Retina. Previously, I had always used Windows, and I still need it, because of Visual Studio. Hence I installed VMware Fusion and Windows 7 as a virtual machine.\nThe problem is that whenever I launch the VM, VMWare automatically sets the resolution of the guest to the maximum available on the Mac (that is 2880x1800). So I changed the resolution from Windows and set it to 1440x900, but, when I restart, on the login screen, it automatically reverts back to 2880x1800. I thought it was due to the VMware Tools, so I uninstalled them. It now works correctly, however I lose a lot of features without the Tools installed.

In the meantime I found this hint via Google:\nGo out of full screen mode (ctrl-cmd-F) and then back again. \n\nA: I am using VMWare Fusion 5.x on MAcBook Retina 13' and as a workaround, I have created a .bat file (auto executable) to automate the commands as suggested by Michiel on my Windows and I just double-click it to bring back my preferred resolution.\nResetResultion.bat file has the following content:\n\"C:\\Program Files\\VMware\\VMware Tools\\VMwareResolutionSet.exe\"  0 1 , 0 0 1920 1200\n\n", "Q: Why won't OS X Mountain Lion remember smb password on login? After mounting an smb shared drive and putting in my username and password, OS X will ask me if I want to save password to keychain.  I can say yes but it will not save it.  The drive has also been added as a login item.\nMy username requires the domain, so it's like:\nmydomain\\firstname.lastname\nOn login, the window pops up and has forgotten the mydomain\\ leaving firstname.lastname and the password field is, of course, blank.\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!\n\nA: You can create a link file with the username and password, and put that in the login items.\nIn Finder select Connect to Server and enter:\nsmb://domain\\username:password@serveraddress\n\nDon't click connect or press enter, just highlight the whole address and drag to desktop (or anywhere else), and it will save as a file.

I eventually got rid of it by having a close look at the entries saved in the keychain - I actually found two relating to that server - and deleting them. (Keychain Access in Programs > Utilities is the tool for that.)\nOnce the botched entries were removed from the keychain, I could save my login credentials. Dragging the share to the sidebar in Finder, or to the desktop, also worked all of a sudden (it didn't previously).\n\nA: There may be a corrupt entry for that server in the Keychain. Delete the entry for that server from KeyChain Access, log out and back in, and try saving it again.\n", "Q: How can I find my IP address - not my company's router, but my local machines I run rails servers at ports 3000 and 5000.  \nWhat do I use (or how do I find) the IP address of my Mac?\nNot the one used for web browsing which is my companies host supplied IP but rather my local machine one. \nI imagine it would be 192.168.x.x?\n\nA: Alternatively, you could try running\nifconfig\n\nin the terminal. It will show a list of interfaces with IPs by default, along with many many other details such as physical addresses. It can also be used to configure network adapter settings, the man page is here: http://linux.die.net/man/8/ifconfig\nor you can run man ifconfig on the terminal.\nIn your case you're probably looking for en0 or en1, look under inet for the IP address.\n\nA: I installed iStat Menues. Now I can see all the IPs, the one from my provieder is called \"public ip\" and the in the WiFi network is called \"private ip\" in iStat Menues.\nIt could also work with the iStat Nano Widget. Only tried the full version.\nI only need to click on the menu bar item to get the info.\n\n\nA: I used: \nipconfig getifaddr en1\n\n\nA: There are several methods...\n...but some methods give different kinds of IP addresses. Make sure you know which kind of IP address you need. For many (most?) purposes, the public IP address is what's required.\n\n*\n\n*Your public IP address is the one people on the internet will see. (This is usually what people mean if they don't specify which kind of IP address.)\n\n*Your local IP address is the one that your router uses to communicate with you on your local area network.\n\nNote: in certain situations, your local IP address may be the same as your public IP address.\nHere's a few ways to get each kind of IP address:\n#1: From the WiFi menubar -- gives your LOCAL IP address\nHold option and click on the WiFi icon in the menubar at the top-right corner of your screen. You will see a special menu that lists, among many other things, your IP Address.\n\n#2: From Network Preferences -- gives your LOCAL IP address\nThere are two ways to get to Network Preferences:\n\n*\n\n*Click on the WiFi icon in the menubar, then select \"Network Preferences\"\n\n*Go to the System Preferences (either on your Dock at the bottom of the screen or by searching for it with Spotlight), then open \"Network\".\n\nYou'll see your IP address as shown:\n\n#3: From a terminal (Method A) -- gives your LOCAL IP address\nFire up your favorite terminal (e.g. Mac OS X comes with one called Terminal), and type the following:\n\n*\n\n*ipconfig getifaddr en0 if connected via a wireless connection.\n\n*ipconfig getifaddr en1 if connected via ethernet.\n\n*ipconfig getifaddr en3 if connected via a Thunderbolt-to-ethernet adaptor.\n\n#4: From a terminal (Method B) -- gives your PUBLIC IP address\nFire up your favorite terminal (e.g. Mac OS X comes with one called Terminal), and type curl http://ipecho.net/plain; echo.\n#5: From a browser -- gives your PUBLIC IP address\nThere are many websites you can use that will tell you your public IP address. The simplest is probably a Google search for \"what is my ip address\".\n\nA: I can't believe nobody has suggested the simplest method of all, only 2 clicks (or 3 if your adapter isn't at the top of the list).\nClick System Preferences, click Network.\nIt will display the IP address of the adapter under Status to the right of the network adapters. If your device isn't at the top (which will be the default selected) then simply click on the one with the green status. It's going to be either Wi-Fi or Ethernet.\n\nA: All these answers are good... I'd like to add one thing. If you're trying to get your Mac's IP so you can access the server you're running locally on the same Mac, you can use http://127.0.0.1/ (the local loopback IP) or http://localhost/. It is always the same and you can use it without even being connected to any network.\nIf you're trying to let others connect to the server on your Mac it would likely be easier to give them your hostname which you can set from the Sharing System Preferences pane (at least as long as they are using a Bonjour-enabled system). Then you can access something like http://mymacbook.local/\n\nA: You can also go to \"About this Mac\" and click on the grey text under \"Mac OS X\" until it displays your local IP address for OS's before Lion.\nAlso, for Mac OSX versions before Lion, this action also works at the login screen.\n\nA: ifconfig en0 inet\nUse ifconfig , then followed by the interface.\nUse man ifconfig to know more.\n", "Q: Safari 6: Replaces all instances of font X with font Y A certain website that I sometimes frequent for Oracle information uses a lot of Courier New. \nThis looks horrible in Safari. Is there a way I can always force Safari to substitute Andale Mono or Monaco when a page calls for Courier New? \nThe HTML in the offending page is not using CSS. The code looks like this:\n<font face=\"Courier New\" size=\"1\">\n\n\nA: The easiest method would be to handle this with CSS and a browser extension.\nInstall the User CSS extension on Safari 6 available here: http://code.grid.in.th\nRunning the extension, create and enable a New User CSS. Name it whatever you want. Under URLs, delete the single asterisk and include the domain for the site you frequent (http://*.oracleinfoworld.com/* or whatever. Place asterisks for wildcards). Now under styles, enter the following:\n@font-face {\nfont-family: 'Courier New';\nsrc: local('Monaco');   \n}\n\nClick save, and reload the Oracle information site.\nThis creates a CSS font-face rule for Courier New, replacing it with your local Monaco font. When the site calls for Courier New, your browser will pass in Monaco (or Andale Mono if you change the name). If you really hate Courier New, you can leave the single asterisk in the include section and replace all instances of Courier New with your preferred font. I would not recommend this, as it may have unexpected effects from time to time.\nHere's an example of how I would configure this extension.\n\n", "Q: Is It Possible to Interact With the Windows in Mission Control? Is it possible to use the windows shown in Mission Control?\nFor example, let's say I have Safari window opened and I want to scroll the page up/down while in Mission Control - is that possible?\nIf it isn't possible - do you know an app that can do something similar?\nEDIT: I should point out that when you focus on a window in Mission Control and you press Space, it enlarge the window. (not what I want, but it's useful feature of Mission Control).\n\nA: The only things you can do with them are move them to other desktops, select them from groups to bring them to the forefront, or drag files/copied text into them.\n\nA: Good question. I've wondered about this myself too. Hypothetically it should be possible, since the window views are updated normally even while using Mission Control. In fact, in Tiger I was sometimes able to enter keyboard input into the top window if I held down a key while using Expose. However, I don't think the Mission Control service is programmed to send mouse input to the windows, so unless a talented developer writes an app of some kind, it doesn't seem to be possible with the current version of Mission Control.\n", "Q: Prompting personal warning before putting my Macbook Pro to sleep I carry my Macbook Pro (15\" Retina, Mid 2012 with Mt. Lion) between my work and home. It is connected to an external HDD as a Time Machine. I always forget to properly eject the HDD before putting my notebook to sleep (I rarely shut it down) at my office.\nIs there a way to have it prompt with a custom reminder or warning when I try to put MBP to sleep, using Automator or something?\n\nA: You could have the drive automatically ejected when you sleep the mac instead?\nQuick search found Jettison on the Mac App Store\nhttp://itunes.apple.com/us/app/jettison/id447430809?mt=12\nThere is also an app you can use to run Apple script on sleep/wake:\nhttp://www.lagentesoft.com/scenario/index.html\n\nA: You can write an AppleScript to do this, then instead of picking sleep from the  menu, you can select your script from the Script menu.\nAll of this can be set up from within AppleScript Editor:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch AppleScript Editor\n\n*Open Preferences\n\n*Check the box to \"Show Script menu in menu bar\". \n\n*Create a new script\n\n*Here is the content of the script:\ndisplay dialog \"Are you sure you want to put the computer to sleep?\"\ndo shell script \"pmset sleepnow\"\n\n\n*Save the script as ~/Library/Scripts/Applications/AppleScript Editor/Sleep.scpt\nNow you can put your computer to sleep from the script menu and be warned before sleeping.\n", "Q: 10.8 reminders snooze duration When I get either a Calendar or Reminders notification, I have the option to 'snooze':\n\nI would like to be able to say something like 'remind me in 10 minutes' or 'remind me in 2 hours' (much like the iCal notifcations used to allow in <= 10.7).\nIs this possible?\n\nA: Yes, Apple failed to include a multi-time snooze feature in the Mountain Lion version of Calendar.  LIke you, thousands of us would like to have this feature back. \nGo to www.apple.com/feedback and tell them.  I did.  If enough people point out this omission, they will address it sooner than later.\nPower in numbers!\n\nA: In Mountain Lion, you can select the snooze duration by holding down the button:\n\nThe various times in the menu differ based on the length of time before the event begins.  There's no visual clue that this functionality is available, but it is.\nUpdate: The same functionality is available in Yosemite\n\n\nA: SnoozeMaster solved this issue for me. It works with both Calendar and Reminders alerts, giving you many more options than the default OS X Mountain Lion 15-minute Snooze. I didn't want to switch to a non-Apple program (such as BusyCal) because I like the way Apple Calendar syncs easily with my other OS X and iOS devices. SnoozeMaster allows me to keep using Apple Calendar, but with a much more flexible Snooze option.\nYou can enter any value you like for the Snooze period. Alternately, you can configure your own drop down menu (similar to the default Apple drop down in OS X Lion). This configurable menu can contain as many items as you like, with time values of your choosing (5 min, 15 min, 3 hrs, 7 days, 0.5 min, etc.).\nWhile running, SnoozeMaster lives in the menu bar under a \".zZ\" icon. To insure that it's always monitoring your alerts, I recommend setting SnoozeMaster's preferences to:\nStart at Login: On\n\nI also recommend turning off Apple Notifications for Calendar and Reminders. These settings can be found in System Preferences:\nSystem Preferences > Notifications > Calendar > Calendar Alert Style: None\nSystem Preferences > Notifications > Reminders > Reminders Alert Style: None\n\nThen you will only get alerts generated by SnoozeMaster and not Apple Notifications.\n\nA: Yes, that drove us crazy too, so we wrote a menubar app to have control over snoozing the Apple Calendar alerts.  Check out \"SnoozeMaster\" on the App Store.  Hope everyone likes it?\n\nA: Busycal seems to be the main contender for the throne and it has a 30 day trial. I am about a week into my trial and I was fairly sure I was going to buy it within the next day or two as it is at a reduced price til the end of the month... until I went and looked at SnoozeMaster (which is only $2) and which seems to do the job - so I'm off to buy that instead.\nupdate: Bought it and it seems perfect - much better than the old Apple iCal one in Lion as you can set any times you want - and certainly better than Mountain Lion as that is totally unusable! Just sent them an email request asking if they would add an option to put off alarms until 9am tomorrow - that would be perfect.\n\nA: According to this answer in the Apple Discussion Forums, it appears to be no.\n", "Q: Exact clone of HD I managed to broke something on my iMac's internal HD. I have now done a successful restore using DiskDrill, but just in case I want to make an exact copy of the internal HD. Not just some partition, but everything, even \"free\" disk space.\nI have tried creating a disk image with Disk Utility and CCC, but they both seemed to clone the only working and empty partition, not the free space where all my data is.\nI should also mention, the internal HD is 1TB, and the external one where I planned to put the disk image is 2TB with some (about 150GB) used space.\n\nA: If you are comfortable using the command line, you could use dd to copy your drive byte-for-byte. First, you need to find the BSD identifier for your internal drive. If you are booted from the drive, this will be disk0. Otherwise, it is most likely disk1, but you should run the following command to see all of your disks and the partitions they contain.\ndiskutil list\n\nOnce you have determined the identifier, you need to determine the exact size of the drive. Run the following command, replacing N with the proper number.\ndiskutil info diskN\n\nAbout halfway through the information shown, find the Total Size. Find the size in 512-byte blocks.\nI will assume you want to clone your drive as a file on your external disk. With the disk plugged in, run the following command. N is the disk's identifier number, EXTERNAL DRIVE is the name of the external partition (you can use the tab key to complete this automatically, clone.hdraw is the name of the file you are writing to, and XXXXX is the number of blocks on your internal drive.\ndd if=/dev/diskN of=\"/Volumes/EXTERNAL DRIVE/clone.hdraw\" bs=512 count=XXXXX\n\n\nNotes:\nThis will copy the drive 512 bytes at a time, which means it will be slow. You can copy faster using a larger block size by increasing the bs argument and decreasing the count argument, but make sure that you are copying an exact number of blocks and that the product of the two remains the same (if you double the block size, the count must be half).\nThis will create a new file on your external drive, but it will not be mountable as a disk image. It is just a binary file containing the raw data from your drive. You can use this file to restore your drive by switching the if and of arguments.\nIf you want to copy to another disk instead of to a file, you can change the of argument to a different /dev/diskM. This would replace any partitions already on the other drive with the partitions from your internal drive. This is not recommended if your drive uses a GUID partition table (if you have an Intel mac), since the unique partition identifiers would also be copied, and therefore no longer be unique.\n\nA: SuperDuper is considered by many to be the go-to disk imaging utility for OS X, and a vital part of a good system backup routine.  For example, see John Gruber's (DaringFireball.net) backup regimen.  It costs $27.94, and I've found it to be well-worth the money.\n\nA: SuperDuper specifically says it copies files, and not even every file. The OP is asking to copy the entire image of the hard drive sector by sector. So far the only method I've found is DD. Even Acronis for Mac doesn't seem to do a raw image.\n", "Q: iTunes Podcast Rejected by Apple I am trying to submit a podcast to iTunes for the first time, and thought everything was going well, but I just got a rejection email:\n\nDear podcast owner,\nThe podcast located at the URL shown below has been blocked or removed from the iTunes directory as a result of technical problems with the feed. \nName: In His Word\n  Feed URL: http://joshburnett.org/podcast/rss_source.rss \nIf you wish to reactivate your podcast in the iTunes directory, please troubleshoot your feed and check the functionality of each episode.

Everything seemed correct, but I finally tried a couple different MP3 files and submitted the podcast and it worked. So, I'm wondering if the audio file my client gave me has issues. When I go to \"Get Info\" for other MP3 files, it shows things like \"Audio Channels\", \"Total Bit Rate\", and stuff like that. The MP3 file I am using doesn't really show anything. All I know is it says it's \"Kind: MP3 audio\" and \"64865838 bytes\". Any thoughts? I know pretty much nothing about audio, I'm a web developer. I can provide the audio file if anyone wants to download it and check it out. \n\nA: Okay, after a long period of troubleshooting, I determined it was the MP3 file that was having issues. After importing it into GarageBand and exporting it from there, it finally worked! I received the MP3 file from the client. He is a preacher and they recorded it at the church. Then he uploaded it to Google Drive and I downloaded it from there. It sounds like it was not encoded correctly, but I am not an audio expert.\n", "Q: OS X Lion, Moutain Lion, Mavericks, Yosemite: deep sleep on low battery leads to crash I'm having an issue on my Mac since I installed Lion and now Mountain Lion (I thought that the Lion problem could be because I've put an SSD in my Mac and did not make a fresh install but a carbon copy to the new disk, but it still happens with Mountain Lion with a format/fresh install).\nWhat is happening to me is that, when I put my Mac to sleep and the battery dies, it does not restore the state like a normal sleep that it did when I was on Snow Leopard. Now when the battery dies, the computer restarts: I need to put my password and the programs open again but some of them lose the previous state (like VLC, Chrome has the \"restore\" option, etc.) it is exactly like a restart with the option \"Reopen windows when logging back in\" selected.\nIs this normal or should it happen like in Snow Leopard? \nIf this is the normal behavior, I will turn off Deep Sleep since the Mac takes less time to sleep with it off. (I think that the more time is because it is storing the state of the RAM on the disk so it could recover when the battery goes off which it doesn't do properly!)\n$ pmset -g | grep hibernatemode\n hibernatemode        3\n\n\nA: Does you SSD use a SandForce controller?  SandForce controllers seem to have some serious issues related to battery and sleep/hibernate activities, and you might (I repeat might) be seeing some of these problems coming up:\nSandForce controller problems \nIf you have a SandForce controller you might want to change SSD altogether, based on the info provided by the link above.\n\nA: Yes, I am having very same issue, not always by the way. It just looks like remaining battery is not enough in order to complete writing to disk.\nI am coming from Lion.\nPreviously after hibernation my Mac status was just restored fine from disk.\nSadly it looks like there is no way to change haltlevel for battery, just like you can do with UPS.\n\nA: It sounds like your battery is either in need of calibration or it needs to be replaced due to being unable to sustain power when the system expects it to. \n\nA: It is completely normal. When battery level reaches reserve (less than 10%), it hibernates which saves RAM state onto HDD as you've mentioned in the question.\nIf you still want to disable that behaviour run this in the Terminal:\nsudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0\n\nand it will be disabled. You can change it back by replacing 0 with 3 (the default).\n", "Q: Upgrading Leopard Server from 10-client to Unlimited I need the lowest-impact way to allow more than 10 AFP sessions on my OS X Server running 10.5.8. If I buy a boxed retail copy of 10.5.4 Server Unlimited, will I just have to enter the new license key in Server Settings? Is it OK if the version numbers don't match up exactly on this type of upgrade?\nThe specific product I'm looking at is here on Amazon. Apple product ID MB605Z/A.\n\nA: Success! I purchased an open-but-unused retail copy of OS X Server v10.5.4 RTL Unlim Client (product number MB605Z/A) and replaced the license key on my server from the 10-client version with the Unlimited key included in the new box. 30 seconds later I was up and running! So yes, it is simple to apply the new key and upgrade your access, and the exact version number does not need to match that which you already have installed.\n", "Q: Change Dock Icons only? I just want to change the dock icons instead of system wide.\nIt it possible to only change the icons in the dock, and not elsewhere?\n\nA: Use Candybar. It's free now as it's not as effective in Mountain Lion as it used to be.\n\nA: Can you be more specific? If you mean add or remove new dock icons on Mac OS, this should work.\nTo Add icons: simply drag any icon from system onto the dock. This should add it automatically.\nTo Remove icons: just hold any icon which you want to remove and drag it onto the desktop and leave, this should remove them.\n", "Q: Getting notified when my iPhone is found at a different email address? If my iPhone gets stolen and I try to use Find my iPhone while it's off, I am given the option to be notified by email when my iPhone is found.\nI believe this sends an email to my iCloud account.\nI see 2 problems with this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Since my iCloud address was automatically set up to receive email on my iPhone, the person who currently has possession of the phone will also be notified when my phone was located. They could then take measures in order to make it harder to find the phone. Ideally they wouldn't get a notification message when my phone is found.\n\n*My iPhone was the only place that I used to get my iCloud messages. Right now I would need to manually login to iCloud.com and check the email every so often to see if it's been located. I realize that I could use an application such as Apple's Mail app to check this account automatically, but I am not using Mail right now. I'm using Gmail instead, and would prefer to get the message at my Gmail address.\n\n\nIs there any way to send the email to a different address and/or bypass these 2 issues after the phone is stolen?\n\nA: You can setup your gmail account as default iCloud account.\nTo do this : \n\n\n*\n\n*Go to settings\n\n*Mail Contacts, Calenders option\n\n*Add new Email Account\n\n*Choose iCloud Account\n\n*Choose Get a Free Apple ID\n\n*When it asks for Email provide your Gmail Address\n\n*It will then pair your email with iCloud account so that you can use it as primary iCloud account\n\n*Once setup is done go to iCloud in Settings and change the account from iCloud me address to your newly setup Gmail iCloud Account\n\n\nHope it helps :)\n\nA: The simple solution in my mind would be, rather than change the email address, lock the phone first. Then there won't be any updates.\n\nA: You can just change all your passwords that way your emails won't be sent to that device because you have changed all the passwords.\n\nA: You can go to your email's settings and forward all your emails to a different email address. \n\nElaborating on this further, you can set up your existing email to forward your emails to another email address which is not synced to your phone.\nYou can set up the forwarding from any browser & the thief will not have access to the account.\n", "Q: How to have terminal close tab when shell exits?

How can I reset the terminal right before command execution?\n\n\nA: What you're looking for in BASH is equivalant to what is built-in precmd in ZSH. This built-in function would be executed prior to executing a command. A work around is mentioned in https://superuser.com/questions/175799/does-bash-have-a-hook-that-is-run-before-executing-a-command. I hope it gives you a hint of how to solve your problem.

While I don't have an iPad to try this on, I was able to bring up several instances of that particular video on my iPhone - I imagine that this method would also work on an iPad.\nHere's one of the links if you'd like to check it out from a computer: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMLG7FvDuCI\nUpdate (Nov. 2016):\nSince full Nova videos are no longer available on YouTube, the only other option I've found is to go to PBS directly:\n\n\n*\n\n*PBS Video app (iTunes link)\n\n*Nova episodes list on the PBS site\nHowever, to actually view the videos may require a membership/passport to your local PBS station (mine is KQED).\n", "Q: Mac OS X 10.7.4 Mail Client triggers Opera for external links in email I would like to have Safari open any links in email messages.

Is there a way to mount disks in Mountain Lion that works with cron?\nThe following command works fine from the Terminal:\n/usr/sbin/diskutil mount disk1s6\n\nBut when executed via my crontab, it fails. My crontab is working fine, otherwise.\nI've been using cron to mount my backup disk once a day before I do a smart clone via SuperDuper. (Possibly related... the SuperDuper release notes mention problems mounting drives in Mountain Lion, but I want to emphasize I was mounting drives separately using a shell script and/or cron.)\nAny ideas or potential workarounds for this problem?\n\nA: I had this same problem and found that I could get it to work if the cron job was launched under root.\nThis Apple discussion link has this note:\n\n[...] Basically, Apple is tracking where an application launches from,\n  and seems to be preventing processes that launch from \"cron\" (one of\n  the system schedulers), even indirectly, from mounting local disk\n  volumes, even when that application is signed.\n\n", "Q: Internet connection no longer reliable after installing Mountain Lion I installed Mountain Lion yesterday and find that when my 2 year old iMac comes back from sleep it finds the router and connection but fails to allow internet connection.  In other words it indicates the machine is connected but I cannot access Mail or use any Internet browser.\nI have two PCs in the house that have no problems, so I assume the problem is neither with the modem or the router.  There was never a problem when I was running Lion, it began only after installing Mountain Lion, so once again I assume the problem is with the new operating system.  My iMac is circa early 2010. My son's iMac (2012) is not demonstrating the same problem.\nThe most reliable way to establish an internet connection is to reboot my router (NetGear N300).  When the computer reconnects after the reboot, it invariably finds the Internet.  I have occasionally been successful Turning Wi-Fi off, and then back on, but most times not.\nI see that other users are reporting similar difficulties.  Even if no one has an answer I hope that this is brought to the attention of Apple Engineers and a fix is quickly forthcoming.\n\nA: I tried all the tips imaginable.\nThe only solution was to set the channel on the wireless router on channel 11.\nIt seems to me, the Mountain Lion has a problem when the channel the router is in automatic, then every time the channel is changed, the connection of the Wi-Fi card of MacBook drops.\n\nA: I had the same problem with my MacBook Air. Resetting its SMC (System Management Controller) seems to have worked, the problem hasn't surfaced since.\nIt seems worth trying this, instructions here\n\nA: I hope you've resolved the wifi issue with your iMac. My daughter's 2012 MacBook Air would not be able to keep a wireless Internet connection, even with the wireless router with clean line-of-sight in the same room. I know how frustrated she was (and I was, trying to help!) I remember how many times we would reboot the router to regain the connection.\nIt took a while, but I tracked the root of the issue to the new power-saving modes Intel and Apple have incorporated into their newer computers. In the distant past, a computer could not independently power down a complete subsystem, such as the wifi networking components. Power savings was more of an all-or-nothing practice: your computer was asleep or it was not.\nToday, saving power is much more granular. Your computer can power down almost any subsystem, and often does without your even knowing! I don't have definitive proof, but I believe the newer Mac hardware will even power down the wifi subsystem while you are reading a web page... not just for longer periods of complete inactivity.\nOlder wifi routers would keep an \"inactive\" connection open for a shorter window of time before releasing the connection, because the computer would ping the router several times a second. Today's Macs will let the connection sleep for longer periods of time, thereby saving power. With this longer timeout period, the router would think the computer had turned off. Restarting the router would renew and reconnect all devices.\nIf you can find the device timeout in the N300's configuration, try setting it to a longer time duration before dropping a connection.\nThe full story is here: Wi-Fi connection randomly disconnects on 2012 MacBook Air\n\nA: I had the same problem. I solved it by using a cable instead of  wifi connection. All the others, iPad,xpria,etc work normally.\nI hope this can help you \n", "Q: Using Terminal, how can I find which directory is my USB drive mounted in?

In my iPad, the cookie setting for Safari is set to \"from visited\", which should block all third party cookies. But if I am not logged out of Facebook, then from any third party webpage that uses the Facebook Social plugin, I can see which of my friends have liked that page. That means Facebook knows that I am visiting that page, so its third party cookie isn't blocked. What am I missing here? (I use Chrome with my Desktop computer, and this does not happen, i.e. with its \"block third party cookies\" setting, the Facebook social plugin cannot see who I am, even when I'm logged in to Facebook.)\n\nA: Facebook's 'social plugin' is iframed, and as far as the browser is concerned content in an iframe is on the domain that served the iframe, not the domain of the page that had the iframe in it.\nSo, to the 'social plugin', facebook's cookies are first-party cookies, not third-party ones.\n", "Q: Higher resolution on Macbook air - simulated?

I have a very long workflow dealing with renaming, resizing and duplicating a large number of high resolution images. The workflow was working fine until I tried it with 300 images.

Or may I just install a fresh copy without disturbing Windows partition?\n\nA: It shouldn't affect your BootCamp partition, I upgraded to Lion and ML on two macs without any issues.\nIf you want a completely clean install and you're booting from a USB drive with the ML installer, then run the disk utility to wipe the OSX partition, and choose that as the destination for installation afterwards, it still won't touch your Windows partition.\n", "Q: Is it normal that iPhone 4S touch screen is not working correctly when charging When I use my iPhone 4S's touch screen while charging, sometime it is not working correctly. For example; if I touch something in the middle screen, it acts like I touch some bottom in the border.\nIs this normal behavior or should I go back to the Apple Store?\n\nA: That's definitely not normal behaviour!\nIt could be something to do with earthing or voltage though as the screen is capacitive, so try charging from another source to see if it does the same thing. e.g. if you're charging from USB on your computer, try it on another computer if possible, or with the mains adapter. If that fixes your problem, it's possible you have a voltage issue or earth leakage issue on the port.\nIf it doesn't fix it, then the problem is likely with the iPhone itself.\nI've had problems in the past where I was charging my iPhone on a work PC and sometimes when I touched the phone it would reset it. Luckily there was no damage caused, but it was a little weird.\n\nA: Same problem bought a new cable and its all good now\n\nA: Had the same problem at work but it was just the outlet.\n", "Q: Why get a regular MacBook Pro versus the Retina display model? I am looking into getting an Apple laptop. I took a look at the MacBook Pro (regular versus retina display). After reviewing the specs, it seems the MacBook Pro with Retina display has the following benefits:\n\n\n*\n\n*Lighter (by about 1 pound)\n\n*SSD\n\n*The display, of course\n\n\nIs cost the only reason I should look at the regular MacBook Pro? It seems like the Retina display is about 300 – 400 dollars (USD) more for the same specs (hard drive space, etc)?\nI wanted to see if there were other things in the regular MacBook Pro, besides cost, that would be considered an advantage over the new retina display.\n\nA: I can buy a regular MBP, with a cheap HDD, open it, upgrade the RAM and replace the HDD with a SDD, all for a fraction of the price Apple would charge me. In addition, I still have Ethernet and a CD/DVD drive, in case I need one. \nAs I said, you might need the retina, or you might just like it, both of which are perfectly reasonable points. I don't, and I prefer to keep my money with me, upgrading my hardware when I need it, and at the price I choose to pay (out of a range of options).  Uh, and I also hate the lack of Ethernet port.\nTo each their own.\n\nA: Graphics performance may be an issue for some. A retina display has to push many more pixels than a traditional display. The graphics card performance needs to be significantly better.\nThis could make a difference for those working with 3D software and to gamers.\nI also suspect you are underestimating the influence of price in the buying decision.\n\nA: Due to the huge increase in pixels being pushed, the retina model has to spend more energy on a GPU and in some circumstances might not benchmark as well as the non-retina model when a high frame rate is needed. Finding a conclusive measure will be hard since personal sensitivity to \"lag or tearing\" when scrolling or gaming means that something that is totally unacceptable to one wouldn't even be noticed by another. There will be no substitute for hands on test driving or buying from someone that will accept a return if you can determine a mistake in estimating your needs soon after purchase. \nThe hardware features are far less subjective - clearly any or all of the components that no longer ship could be seen as viable reasons to purchase the non-retina 15-inch MacBook Pro:\n\n\n*\n\n*Security slot\n\n*Integrated optical drive\n\n*Line in and out (in addition to the headphone jack)\n\n*Integrated Ethernet\n\n*Integrated Firewire\n\n*User-replaceable/upgradeable and Physical Hard Drive (as opposed to solid state)\n\n*User-replaceable/upgradeable RAM\n\n*Glass protected LCD panel\n\n*Physical size of the MagSafe connector or the body itself\n\n\nMissing these components is amplified if you already have accessories or manage several computers that are pooled and expected to be the same physical size. For most, these omissions when selecting a retina MacBook Pro are a welcome change as adapters are available for most of the connections that are lost. Subjectively, if you don't need the resolution or weight/performance that the retina model allows, any of these considerations could tip the scales to make the non-retina model preferable. In my experience, the added screen protection and the known strength1 of the non-retina model as well as the ability to upgrade RAM/storage are the primary reasons people have passed on a retina model thus far.\n\n1 - It's too soon to know if the retinal model's design is more, less or equally as rugged as the 15 inch MacBook Pro, but the existing design is extremely strong and I have seen them survive falls from a moving car roof at 40 MPH with no protection and only cosmetic damage. I have also seen a short 10 inch fall do $1300 damage to case, logic board and LCD panel even though most drops from less than two feet do anything but cosmetic and light bending of a Pro.  Even with that variability in damage, the Pro are clearly more stout than the Air line so if you are hard on your hardware, the added bulk of the non-retina model might be a good reason to prefer it.\n\nA: The ability to upgrade the RAM and HDD myself, the ability to have two hard drives by replacing the optical drive, and the obvious cost.\nI have the 1680x1050 display in my 15\" mbp, and side by side against the retina display, it simply didn't look that much better to make it worthwhile. I'd assumed that with the higher res I could fit so much more on the screen if I wanted to work with more detail, but it doesn't allow you to shrink things that much. I could only fit a tiny bit more on, so there was no value in spending so much more for so little gain this time. I'll buy one in another year or so when I plan to upgrade anyway provided that the base model starts at 500gb on the SSD and 16gb RAM isn't a stupidly expensive option. Hopefully by then they will have used a graphics chipset which is more suited for such a high resolution display.\nIf you're buying a new laptop anyway though, and don't mind paying a lot more to increase the storage and memory up front, then I'd say go for it.\n", "Q: Loosing WiFi router connection when moving from one router to another I have an issue with my mac book pro (15\")\nI connect to the WiFi at home but when I take it to my work WiFi it cannot connect.\nI get no errors or messages.\nDoes anybody have any idea what can resolve this issue?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: This could be caused by any number of things. Your work may have access restrictions in place which prevent unauthorised devices from connecting. The first place to ask would be your companies IT staff.\n\nA: One solution, if possible, would be to connect to the router via ethernet. If there are so few restrictions, you could login to the router's configuration page, find the DHCP config, and reserve the MAC address of your computer to a specific LAN IP. This is supposed to happen automatically, but minimally doing this won't hurt. The procedure is different for each router, but here is a general tutorial. When you're done, save the changes and logout. Afterwards, you should have no problem connecting to the network.\n", "Q: What drivers should I install to use the trackpad \"two finger swipe\" on Windows 7 running under VirtualBox? I'm using Oracle VirtualBox to run several VMs on my MacBook and am unable to use the trackpad to \"two finger swipe\" to the previous webpage under Win 7.\nI'm guessing this is a driver issue.\nSince my mac never came with a CD, or anything else, where can I download the Win7 drivers that will allow me to properly \"swipe\" under Win7?\n(The OracleBox drivers do currently support two finger scroll, but not the \"go back\" macro in IE)\n\nA: Multi-touch gestures aren't built in to Windows. you'll need to use third party utilities to get these sort of functions.

I'm new to the Mac platform and need to figure out which virtualization platform is best for me.\nIs there a comparison list of features (and missing features) for each of the major virtualization platforms?  (VirtualBox, VMware Fusion, Parallels Desktop, Microsoft VirtualPC, or VMware ESX?\nI have a license for each and am running on a retina MacBook Pro with 16 GB of RAM.  I need to run a number of Microsoft operating systems in 64-bit mode.  \n\nA: As you've pointed out, there is plenty of virtualisation software. However, the most famous are Parallels and VMware Fusion (the other ones I haven't used, so I can't give you an opinion about them).\nIn my opinion, Parallels is the more robust one and gives me the best performance. There are a lot of online battles going one between both camps and there both apps have their (dis)advantages. For me, Parallels is the best way to go, because it has the most functions.\nFor most people it's a close race and they let the price decide. Both companies often hold special sales, so you should look for those kind of things. \n\nA: VirtualBox is free so the downside to trying it is just your time. I did, and stayed with it. I primarily run XP but I did play with a couple of Linux flavors on it as well. \nIts seamless mode works well, showing only the application's windows on your OS X desktop among whatever other OS X stuff is there. I point my few remaining Windows apps to shared folders on the OS X file system which means I don't have to backup the Windows VDisk very often; my data is safely included in my OS X backup scheme.\n\nA: VirtualBox is free.  I’ve used it with various Linux distro’s, but didn’t find it too stable.  It crashed way too often.\nParallels is a good solution, but they force ads on you.  I don’t like that.  This solution is reputed to have the best performance.\nFusion is a good product, not free, but no ads.  As a bonus, you get the VIX API for controlling virtual machines across the entire VMWare product line.

Is there a way to queue up a song to start after the current one?\n\nA: As they say in the iPhone world, \"There's an app for that\" (Review) :-) It's called OnCue.\n\nA: You could try Play It Next, it does just that.\n\n\nA: You should get the Music Queue Player, this app will solve your problem. It uses the iOS music library and iOS 7 design and allows you to manage queues of songs that you can update whilst playing. You can also save queues. It's the best app of this kind I've seen!\n\nA: This requires just a little preparation: first you need to be playing a playlist. \n\n\n*\n\n*create a new playlist\n\n*add your first song\n\n*hit 'Done'\n\n*Play the song you've added\n\n*hit the back button to view the playlist\n\n*hit 'Edit'\n\n\nAt this point you can add and rearrange songs without interrupting playback.  I always miss the function 'Play in iTunes DJ' which iTunes on the Mac has, which would shortcut this whole process.\n\nA: OnTheFly Playlist does exactly what you are asking.\n\nA: Queue Music does exactly what you are asking for:\n", "Q: How can I create a new group for items in the Sidebar in Finder? I have:\n\n\n*\n\n*Favorites\n\n*Shared\n\n*Devices\n\n\nI'd like to create something like:\n\n\n*\n\n*Cloud Files\n\n\nMy Favorites is getting a little cluttered with shortcuts to a DropBox folder, a SkyDrive folder, a Google Drive folder, an IDrive folder, etc.\nHow can I create a new group for items in the Sidebar in Finder?\n\nA: No. You can rearrange the order of the three you mentioned though - just click and drag to move them. \nA possible workaround would be to create a new folder, say \"Cloud files\", and put it in the sidebar. You could then place aliases of your other folders into that one. This would help trim down the folders in your Favorites section, as well as keep the same quick access to them. \n\nA: I use a folder named ------------ as a divider. If you need more dividers you could create a new folder inside the first one and so on, be creative!\n\n\nA: I really can't understand why apple can't implement this, since many finder app alternative have this feature! I don't think it is so difficoult! If it can be of any help to you, I use ForkLift, and it has such feature out of the box\n", "Q: Finding videos in iCloud Do the videos you take on iPhone go to the iCloud? If so where do I find them on my computer? It didn't go where my pictures are.\n\nA: No they don't get moved to the iCloud. At least not automatically. There is a feature called Photo Stream which does exactly that with photos. But there isn't a Video Stream (yet).\nNote that iCloud backups do backup your videos (and hence go to iCloud), however, they are not user accessible (except in restoring an iDevice).\n", "Q: How to repair/recover Snow Leopard when the installation DVD has been lost? So I seem to not have my Snow Leopard DVD available anywhere.\nI can't use a newer version like Lion.\nWhat can I do to repair/recover Snow Leopard now that the installation DVD is not available?\n\nA: If you computer not booting is the reason you need your Snow Leopard disc, there are several things to try and troubleshoot your issue.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into single user mode (Cmd + S @ POST (chime)).  Once the command prompt comes up, type fsck -fy.  This will attempt to repair your disk.\n\n*If this is okay, hold down Shift at POST and see if it boots.  This disables kexts, fonts, etc.\n\n*If this does not work try verbose mode (Cmd + V @ POST) and see where your computer stops loading at and troubleshoot from there.\nGood luck.\n\nA: An unrepairable disk error requires an Erase/Install of OS X.  It may not cause issues right away, so get the files transferred now.\nIn fact it may fail to even boot up.  The previously mentioned shift key at boot (Safe Mode) worked.\nI just used Disk Utility to BACK UP the entire hard drive to a properly setup USB.  That will repair the installed OS X 10.6.8.\nCarbon Copy Cloner allows bulky user files to be excluded.\nI made a copy of OS X 10.6.8 installation right after Software Update was finished.\nThanks to apple discussions for tip on using a copy to repair the system.\n", "Q: How to implement shortcut commands to the \"Share > Email\" under contextual menu? How to implement shortcut commands to the \"Share > Email\" under contextual menu in Mountain Lion?\n\nA: The New Email With Selection service is basically the same, but it's available in more applications and views.\n\n\nA: You can make a service for that using Automator. The following screenshots show you what to do:\n\n\nPay attention \"Service receives\" part.\nThan save a service and activate it as in the post above. This will go into \"Services\" (not to \"Share\") though.\n", "Q: How to fix locate.updatedb not respecting directory excluded from /etc/locate.rc? I wanted to exclude some directories from the results of /usr/libexec/locate.updatedb by editing /etc/locate.rc.  Unfortunately if I edit locate.rc locate.updatedb runs forever and does not actually terminate -- I have to kill it, and then the database for locate is an empty file.\nAny ideas on why locate.rc is not respected?\nI'm on ML (OS X 10.8), using bash from Macports (bash 4.2.37(2)-release), and my locate.rc reads:\n#\n# /etc/locate.rc -  command script for updatedb(8)\n#\n# $FreeBSD: src/usr.bin/locate/locate/locate.rc,v 1.9 2005/08/22 08:22:48 cperciva Exp $\n\n#\n# All commented values are the defaults\n#\n# temp directory\n#TMPDIR=\"/tmp\"\n\n# the actual database\n#FCODES=\"/var/db/locate.database\"\n\n# directories to be put in the database\n#SEARCHPATHS=\"/\"\n\n# directories unwanted in output\nPRUNEPATHS=\"/tmp /var/tmp /Users/me/.vim /Users/me/.cups /Users/me/tmp\"\n\n# filesystems allowed.

If you can use an alternative command, you actually can use spotlight command 'mdfind' in terminal.  You can set the folders to exclude folders in spotlight preference pane, and then type 'mdfind -name' to find files. And make an alias for 'mdfind -name' to 'locate' in your bash or zsh setting could save you a few strokes.\n", "Q: Toggle Finder sort order with AppleScript under Lion 10.7?

I am looking for an app on iphone to do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*I can select a bunch of photos into the app\n\n*I click a button\n\n*Then the app will randomly pick a photo from what I have selected and show up in the screen.\nIf possible the app could quickly slide through all the photos I have selected and randomly stop at one of them.\nThis app is very useful in a party and when people want to do a raffle gift drawing.\nIs there such an app there?\n\nA: The built in slideshow would work to set the order of photos to random if you've already classified the photos into an album. Just set the delay to a while and remember to re-choose the album to re-seed the randomness if you choose to repeat the selection.\nIf you need to classify photos on the go, you can use the iPhoto app to import / sort / add / remove photos from a group and then set up your random slide show for the ordering of them at random.\nAs a bonus, you can play music if desired while you set things up. I don't know of an app to provide your slot machine animation but perhaps someone can find just that app on the store for you.\n\nA: I realise this post was written 6 years ago but judging by the number of views it seems some people are wondering the same thing.\nThere's an iOS app (not sure about android) called Random Image Select that does what the original poster was looking for. \n\nA: There is also the app \"Random Gallery\":\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=at.DiTronic.androidgroup.randomgallery\nIt randomly shows photos and provides basic features like folder selection or adding photos to favorites.\n\nA: I made a website like that, have fun\nhttps://agile-cliffs-83385.herokuapp.com/\n", "Q: Sound turns off when Mountain Lion sleeps When my Mac (running Mountain Lion) goes to sleep, it turns off my apps. For example, I was listening to music with VLC, and when it goes to sleep mode, VLC stops playing. What can I do?\n\nA: Sleep mode is designed to suspend apps so the system can sleep. (All apps and most of the OS stop executing and some hardware is turned off to save battery.)\nThere is no fix for this other than setting your system to not sleep. You can do this permanently in the Energy Saver preference pane or temporarily by using an app like Jiggler or a command-line utility like caffeinate.\n\nA: That is what (System) Sleep does.\nPerhaps you want to change your power settings to enable Display Sleep rather than System Sleep.\n\nA: apple is preparing a supplemental update to 10.8.5 for fixxing that issue.\n", "Q: Understand \"Open in browser\" vs \"Open in Preview\" for PDF files When I click on a link to a PDF file, sometimes the PDF document opens in the Safari browser window, and sometimes it opens a new window and opens the PDF document in the Preview application.\nIs there a way to predict which will happen, before I click on the link?  If I want it to always open in Preview, or always open in the browser, is there a way to configure the browser to do so?\nI'm using Safari on Mountain Lion, if that is relevant.\n\nA: Something that I have found quite useful is getting info for one type of file and then setting it so that all files of that kind open in a specific application.\n\n• Right click (or control + click) on any PDF file and choose Get Info from the pop-up menu.\n  • In the window that pops up, choose which application to open that file with. (choose Preview if you want to open PDF files in Preview).  \n  • Click Change All… to automatically open all PDF files in the selected application.\n\n", "Q: Disable two week view in the Mountain Lion Calendar App In Lion I enabled the \"Top sekret\" debug menu and checked the box to show 14 days in the weekview. In Lion it worked quite nice.\nNow I upgraded to Mountain Lion it doesn't work as nice as it was and I want to change it back to the normal 7 days in a week-view. One problem, I can't enable the debug menu anymore! So I don't know how to change it back.\nI already searched the internet, looked in the App bundle etc, but I can't find where Calendar stores this setting. Do you know how to \"reset\" Mountain Lions calendar to the default setting for the weekview?\n\nJust replaced my Calendar.app with the Calendar.app from another Mac, but no luck. So it seems that this preference is saved somewhere else. Hope somebody can point me in the correct direction.\n\nA: Another (and more definite way) to get this fixed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Close the Calendar app.\n\n*Edit ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iCal.plist and REMOVE the following keys:\n\n\n*\n\n*CalUIDebugUseIPadStyleEventLayout\n\n*last calendar view description\n\n*IncludeDebugMenu\n\n*CalUIDebugDefaultDaysInWeekView\n\n\n*Save and restart Calendar.\nYou may need XCode or the PList Editor to edit the file (or use plutil to convert to text, edit with TextEdit and convert it back to binary).\n\nA: Like you, I had set iCal's week view to 14 days using the Debug menu in iCal under Lion before upgrading to Mountain Lion.  However, at least for me, changing the value via Calendar>Preferences... did not permanently change the setting.  When I restarted Calendar, it always reverted to the previous value (in my case, 14 days) if the value was not one of those available from the menu (i.e., 5 or 7).\nThere is another way to set the number of days shown in week view, and that's to use the following shell command:\ndefaults write com.apple.iCal CalUIDebugDefaultDaysInWeekView 7\n\nThis works where Calendar>Preferences... does not, for reasons I don't understand.  \nThe \"7\" in the command above can be another number, including ones not previously available from Lion iCal's Debug menu, e.g., 10.  However, I find that Mountain Lion's Calendar has a peculiar bug when the value is not 5 or 7: in week view, if you have moved the viewed range of dates such that today is not visible, then using View>Go To Today (or Command+T) does not move the days in the grid to show today.  The title changes to the correct dates, but the days in the grid don't change to the correct range of dates.\n(Hat tip to this posting for pointing out that the numerical value could be anything, not just a value shown in iCal's Debug menu.)\n\nA: Finally I figured it out! :) Was pretty simple actually. Just go to Calendar > Preferences... and change the value of days in a week to another value. This will make Calendar reset the number of days in a week!\nFull story over here.\n", "Q: How can I set and use a PATH component with blanks in bash? I have Mathematica 8 installed on my OS X Mountain Lion laptop. I want to set my PATH so that I can run either MathematicaKernel or Mathematica from the command line. To this end I have configured my .bash_profile so that it reads:\n$MAC_Mma=\"/Applications/Mathematica\\ Home\\ Edition.app/Contents/MacOS/\"\nexport PATH=/opt/local/bin:/Users/comerduncan/newipython/ipython/build/scripts-2.7/:/Users/comerduncan:/Users/comerduncan/Sandbox/sympy/sympy/:$MAC_Mma:$PATH\nWhen the .bash_profile file is read when the terminal is created and I try to execute MathematicaKernel, no such executable is found. However, if I create an alias:\nalias math='/Applications/Mathematica\\ Home\\ Edition.app/Contents/MacOS/MathKernel'\n\nin the .bash_profile file, then when I run math the kernel starts up as usual.\nAlas, this alias way does not fit my need in another case where a bash script is run which needs to find the MathematicaKernel in the path. SO, my question is why does the alias way work and my way via the PATH not work?\n\nA: Stop using backslashes in your variables, and start quoting them.\nfoo=\"/path/that/has some spaces\"\nPATH=\"$foo\":\"$PATH\"\n\n", "Q: SMTP Issues with Mountain Lion 10.8 BACKGROUND\n\n\n*\n\n*I upgraded from 10.7 to 10.8 on  7/28/12\n\n*I upgraded Xcode from 4.4 to 4.4.1 on 8/8/12\n\n\nPROBLEM\n\n\n*\n\n*On 8/9/12, on my MacBook Air, Mail.app refuses to connect to the SMTP service on a server that I frequently use.

No problems with incoming mail.\n\n*Outgoing Mail is set to use the default ports, with SSL and Password authentication.    \n\n\nEFFORTS TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEM\n\n\n*\n\n*I can telnet to the server on port 587 with no issue.  The server responds as it should.\n\n*I can ping the server and connect to it via SSH or WWW.\n\n*My iPhone and iPad with the exact same SMTP settings are able to, from the same WiFi network, send mail without issue.\n\n*The same problem happens if I use the server's public IP or its domain.\n\n*I experience this on my network at work and when connected through a VPN to another network.   \n\n*I have deleted and recreated the SMTP server in Mail.app with no success.\n\n*I have deleted and reinstalled the certificates associated with the server with no success.\n\n*I tried to create a new IMAP and SMTP account for the same server using another name and password.  Upon setup, IMAP was found and connected immediately, but the SMTP server was never found.\n\n*Using Sparrow, I tried to add an account on the server and also did not get past the SMTP portion.\n\n*Connection doctor shows NOTHING as far as attempts to reach the server for SMTP.  All IMAP attempts are logged and attempts to reach the other SMTP servers appear as they should.  But, there is nothing showing for attempts to reach the SMTP service on the server in question.\n\n*In my SMTP server settings, I tried manually adding 587 both with SSL and without without any success.  My mail server only accepts on 587.\n\n*Restarted Mail, restarted MacBook Air, flushed DNS entries.\n\n*Dragged the Mail and Mail Downloads Folders out of ~/Library and tried recreating the account.  Again, it connected to IMAP fine, but stalled when trying to connect to the SMTP server.\n\n\nA: I ended up having to go to ~/Library/MailData, edit Accounts.plist,  and remove the keys and value entries related to SSLEnabled. Luckily I had a POP server that was okay to copy from. There were two entries, first the SSLEnabled one and the following entry all good for now.\n", "Q: iTunes can no longer find music files after changing IP address of NAS I have a problem with finding my music again in iTunes after the IP address was changed of my NAS where all my music resides. \nAfter switching internet providers, I changed the layout of my home network. Formerly my NAS could be reached on IP 192.168.0.12, but the new modem demands another IP range, so my NAS is now at 192.168.1.200.\nI connect to my NAS (QNAP TS-410) through NFS to a folder called QMultimedia. I mapped the folder to Finder so I have easy access to it and iTunes uses that folder. Next to NFS, I use the same mapping via a Samba share and an AFP share through Bonjour. \nAfter I changed the network location everything is working fine (XBMC, Finder, Time-Machine), except that iTunes cannot find any of my music anymore. If I open a track in iTunes, it will hang for a while (showing the eternal flame for a minute) and then display a message that is could not find the track because it cannot find the path (192.168.0.12, the old location) and if I want to search for it. I can, but I can only do that for a single track and with a few hundred tracks of music, it is an impossible job to remap my music this way.\nDid someone experienced this before and how did you solve it? Is there a way to get it easily working again without reorganizing and relabeling all my music in iTunes again? Any suggestions are welcome!\nI am experienced with PCs and networking, but a little new with OSX, the Terminal and Bash. I am running iTunes 10.6.3 on a mid-2010 MBP on Mountain Lion.\n\nA: As I can't comment on post so it comes as an answer:\nAre your iTunes library accessing the NAS as a shared library or as imported files?\nIf it's imported files the \"file location\" stored in your iTunes library still contain the old IP. Changing all of these will take forever and I do not know if there is any application or plugin that can batch-change them. Deleting all files and importing them again might be the easiest solution to your problem.\nYou can see the songs location in the Get info -> Summary -> \"Where:\"\n\nA: *\n\n*Make sure you have rebooted the NAS since this change occurred.\n\n*Access the QNAP admin screen using your web browser.\na. login with the admin account\nb. navigate to Applications->iTunes Server\nc. verify Enable iTunes server is checked\nd. set a new password for the iTunes server if you do not remember it\ne. click apply\nf. access the iTunes server using the link right above the password box, it should be http://192.168.1.200:3689 in your case\ng. check for any errors\nh. restart iTunes\ni. in the top left of iTunes, there is an icon with a Music note, if your iTunes server is running on your network, you should be able to select this drop down and change the server your iTunes client is accessing\n\n", "Q: Mountain Lion, EFI and Intel SSD Toolbox Here's the problem:\nI want to do a clean install of Mountain Lion on my (custom) Intel 520 SSD inside my iMac. The first time this SSD was setup, it was done by a certified Apple Retailer.\nThis time, I wanted to use the \"Intel SSD Toolbox\" to do a \"secure erase\" of the drive to get it back to full condition. However, to do this, there can be no partition on the drive, and currently the EFI partition is still present.\nI searched on AskDifferent and via Google, but it seems removing this partition makes Mountain Lion complain while installing.\nSo my question is this: (How) can I safely remove the EFI partition so I can use the Intel SSD Toolbox and then install Mountain Lion? I figure the drive initially never came with any EFI partition and the Apple Retailer installed Lion (not Mountain Lion though) just fine, so there has to be a way to tackle this.\nI am currently writing, and working on this from Windows 7, my Lion partition is already gone so I can't work from there\n\nA: Delete the EFI partition, do your secure erase, then don't partition or format the drive from Windows 7. Instead, boot from the OSX installer disk or recovery environment, and use its version of Disk Utility to partition the drive, using the GUID partition scheme. Disk Utility will create the EFI partition for you if done this way.\nTo be clear: the EFI partition doesn't contain any useful data - in fact it's generally completely empty - but it's used by OSX and the Mac's bootloader for installing firmware updates. This is why the installer complains if it doesn't exist.\n", "Q: How to access USB External Drive on iMac from Macbook Pro? I have an iMac with an external USB 1TB harddrive, running Mountain Lion. Under File Sharing I have added this external drive to my list of \"Shared Folders\".\nI have a MacBook Pro also running Mountain Lion and I want to be able to access the external drive on the iMac, but it's not showing that drive when I access the iMac via Finder on the MacBook Pro.\nWhat am I doing wrong?\n\nA: I've realised that all the time the external drive is NTFS file system, it won't share it, but as soon as I formatted it to Mac OS Journalled FS, it appeared straight away.\n", "Q: Windows-PowerPoint presentations on an iPad with great typography distortion I have a PowerPoint presentation created on Microsoft Windows. When I play it on an iPad there are great typography distortions. There are a lot of fonts not found on the by iPad. Could I install my own fonts on an iPad, or solve this in another way?\n\nA: Unfortunately, the iPad does not support the installation of fonts by the user, and microsoft office documents do not allow font embedding. If you wish to maintain consistent typography you'll have to use a document that supports font embedding such as a PDF.\n\nA: In order to obtain similar results in typography on a Windows PC running PowerPoint and on an iPad, perhaps you should construct your PowerPoint presentation with fonts that are already available on the iPad.\nApple's list of fonts in iOS 5 is here.\nIf you want things to look the same on different platforms, it is always a good idea to restrict your presentations to the basic fonts Arial, Courier, Georgia, Times New Roman and Verdana.\n", "Q: How to highlight changes when comparing versions of a document in OS X? I've been exploring the versions functionality of the new document model in Mac OS X 10.8. It's mostly similar to what was in Lion.

I assumed there must be a feature to highlight the changes but I can't find it. Has anyone figured this out?\n\nA: Sadly, I'm quite sure the highlighting doesn't exist. Apple's documentation doesn't mention it either: OS X Lion: About Auto Save and Versions\n(I know it's from Lion)\nMountain Lion changes to Auto Save doesn't mention it either.

This is called inactive memory, and is intended to improve user experience by speeding up some actions:\n\nFor example, if you've been using Mail and then quit it, the RAM that\nMail was using is marked as Inactive memory. Inactive memory is\navailable for use by another application, just like Free memory.\nHowever, if you open Mail before its Inactive memory is used by a\ndifferent application, Mail will open quicker because its Inactive\nmemory is converted to Active memory, instead of loading it from the\nslower drive.\n\nSounds questionable (just how much can you possibly speed up Mail on a quad-core machine?), but at least that couldn't possibly hurt since such memory can be treated like free memory! Actually, it can:\n\nIn OS X, when the number of pages in the free list dips below a\ncomputed threshold, the kernel reclaims physical pages for the free\nlist by swapping inactive pages out of memory.\n\nThis makes me question whether OSX' memory handling is in fact superior; after all the same page mentions that\n\nPaging of any kind... affects performance negatively because it\nforces the system to spend a lot of time reading and writing to disk.\nReading a page in from the backing store takes a significant amount of\ntime and is much slower than reading directly from RAM. If the system\nhas to write a page to disk before it can read another page from disk,\nthe performance impact is even worse.\n\nIssue:\nThis (paging out inactive memory and the subsequent severe performance degradation) is likely to occur even during trivial tasks such as multi-tab browsing, even if the number of simultaneously open tabs is kept within reasonable (both Safari and Chrome appear to be guilty of adding to inactive memory whenever a tab is closed).\nThe machine becomes hardly usable when this happens - even opening up Terminal and purging memory can take a few minutes.\nQuestion:\nCan swapping inactive memory be turned off? Or, with inactive memory not being essential, can it be disabled completely?\nAlternatively, is there a daemon or a preferably Apple app available that monitors inactive memory usage (an OSX oxymoron) and when it goes over an arbitrary amount (half a gig?) a purge is performed?\n\nA: I've been researching this very question for some time, and I've come to the conclusion that while there are several so-called \"solutions\" offered in various places, none of them really fixes the problem or makes the symptoms go away. The best I've found is techniques that change when inactive memory is swapped, such as the use of the purge command you referred to. I believe that MacLemon is correct that swapping can be disabled only in entirety and not selectively, and so disabling the swapping of inactive memory would in practice be equivalent to disabling virtual memory altogether—which could be a workable solution on a machine with really large amounts of RAM, but is impractical on machines with a low maximum RAM capacity, such as MacBooks or Minis.\nThe reason that none of the ad-hoc purging solutions make the situation significantly better is that there are really only two ways to force OS X to clear inactive memory: the purge command, or forcing allocation of all free memory (and since I'm not certain what method purge uses, these two may actually be more or less the same). purge, as you mentioned, takes a non-trivial amount of time to complete. Allocating all free memory simply accelerates the process by which the contents of inactive memory would be swapped out naturally, and so still takes up the same large amount of system resources. The only advantage of either of these solutions is that they allow you to choose when the swapping occurs, so it can be done before you would be normally trying to allocate that memory to something else. Whether that is actually useful to you depends on several factors, so the simplest way to find out is to just try it.\nI've been testing a few of the memory-clearing utilities out there, and I've found that for me, manually forcing inactive swap requires more active monitoring of memory levels than is practical while I'm actually working, and using a utility that automatically forces the swap when free memory drops below a certain threshold is no better than letting the OS do it on its own, as I still have no control over when the swapping will occur and my apps will SPOD. So while there is an app that will do exactly what your alternative question asks for, that doesn't actually make the situation any less painful.\nUntil Apple's OS development team decides that the memory management system isn't working the way it's supposed to, and they figure out a way to make it work properly, the only real solution is to identify which apps are generating the most inactive memory and stop using them. In my situation, this has meant changing web browsers. I've been testing a variety of them, and Chrome is so far the one that seems to generate the least inactive memory, probably in part because every tab and every extension runs as a separate process, allowing the OS's native memory management to treat each one separately in terms of prioritizing swapping. Safari is the worst I've tried; starting with Safari 5.1, I could open a few tabs, do absolutely nothing, and watch the inactive memory rise rapidly in Activity Monitor—it would easily go from <1gb inactive to >3gb inactive within about five minutes, run the swap cycle, and then do the exact same thing. (Granted, memory that is doing nothing is exactly what makes it inactive in the first place, but it shouldn't create more inactive memory than was allocated active in the first place.) Safari 6 under Mountain Lion is a bit better, but not better enough to be worth switching back. Firefox, not being based on WebKit, ought to be better about this than either Safari or Chrome, but it has its own legacy of memory management problems, including a history of memory leaks, that make it no better in practice.\nWhat would really fix the issue is if there was an option, likely a hidden option in the OS, telling the OS to simply dump the contents of inactive memory when needed instead of swapping its contents to disk. But I don't expect Apple to ever make such an option available.\n\nA: How much RAM does your Mac have? Also, browsers (especially Webkit ones) are known to use huge amounts of memory these days. Inactive memory is put to good use opposed to free RAM which just sits there consuming power. In the case of a browser this enables you to undo closing a tab and still have it's history preserved, etc.\nYou can completely disable memory swapping by running sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.dynamic_pager.plist and a restart. You cannot selectively disable swapping.\nYou can undo this by running sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.dynamic_pager.plist and restarting again.\n\nA: Update 2020\nThis question was asked in 2012 and this answer was written in 2020, and some things have changed in the interim, but a lot has remained the same.\nI believe most of this question, the answer from Quantumpanda, and the description from Apple Support article suffer from a misunderstanding of the nature of \"inactive memory\". The OP points to Apple Documentation that says\n\nIn OS X, when the number of pages in the free list dips below a computed threshold, the kernel reclaims physical pages for the free list by swapping inactive pages out of memory.\n\nThe Apple documentation said that in 2012 and still says that in 2020. However, that quote comes from the \"Paging Out Process\" section of the documentation; the OP missed the discussion of \"Page Lists in the Kernel\". The key sentence (for our current purposes) in that section is\n\nIf an inactive page has not been modified and is not permanently resident (wired), it is stolen (any current virtual mappings to it are destroyed) and added to the free list.\n\nWhat the Support Article was talking about\n\nFor example, if you've been using Mail and then quit it, the RAM that Mail was using is marked as Inactive memory. Inactive memory is available for use by another application, just like Free memory. However, if you open Mail before its Inactive memory is used by a different application, Mail will open quicker because its Inactive memory is converted to Active memory, instead of loading it from the slower drive.\n\nIn order to run a program, Mail in this example, the code for that program is read from disk and written to RAM, because the CPU can only execute code from RAM. The OS keeps track of the fact that the RAM is a copy of a file on disk, and it keeps track of whether or not that data in RAM has been modified. When the Mail program exits, the RAM copy of the file is no longer needed and ends up on the \"inactive\" list. However, if there is plenty of RAM to go around, there is no need to destroy the data in the RAM, so it is just left as-is.\nNow if you run the program again right away, the OS does not have to copy the code from disk to RAM because it can see, by looking through the inactive list, that it already has a copy of the file in RAM, so it just moves that RAM to the active list and assigns it to the new running Mail program. This is much faster than re-reading the file from disk.\nMail is a bad example, though, because you are not often stopping and starting the mail program. However, there are dozens of small programs the OS runs in the background, such as to keep Spotlight indexes updated or keep your local data in sync with iCloud, that are frequently run and then quit when done. For these programs the time savings is much more significant.\nThe critical point: this kind of inactive memory is never swapped\nThis kind of memory, which is backed by a file on disk and not modified, is never written to swap, because there is already a copy of it on disk elsewhere. This is the kind of memory called out in the added quote above: \"has not been modified and is not permanently resident\". When there is not enough memory, this kind of inactive memory is not swapped, it is stolen and placed directly on the free list.\nInactive memory that is swapped is memory a running application still needs\nThe other way memory become inactive is if an application has not touched (read from or written to) it in a while. For example, if you are working in a word processor and have several open files, this might be information about one of the files you have open but are not working on. When memory runs low, this kind of memory is swapped out to disk to make room for whatever is requesting memory it needs right now that is causing memory to run low.\nThis kind of inactive memory must be swapped out because it contains data that is not saved anywhere else. The only way to prevent this kind of memory from being swapped out is to disable swap entirely, and that is almost always a poor choice. When you disable swap entirely, you reduce the capacity of the system significantly. If you limited the system to only running what it could run with swap disabled, it would perform just as well with swap enabled.\npurge is a red herring\nThe purge program is a counter-productive red herring. It will force the inactive memory that would be stolen rather than swapped to be stolen right away. That may look good for the numbers, but it actually hurts performance in 2 ways:\n\n*\n\n*It takes time to run the purge program\n\n*It removes the performance that is gained by keeping track of what the inactive memory contains and allowing it to be reused.\n\nBottom line: do not try to disable inactive memory swapping\n", "Q: Can the list section shown in Day view in Calendar removed?

It will, obviously enough, delete any of the files you created when you were logged in as the previous user.\n\nHow is it possible that there be a folder for a user who doesn't appear at the login window?\nOS X keeps track of users and their passwords using Directory Services. On most people's computers the Directory Services files are stored in /var/db/dslocal. This database stores the names of users, and other information, such as the location of their home folder. When you deleted your user, your Mac removed the account entry (from the dslocal database), but did not delete the home folder stored in the /Users folder.\n\nSo why didn't the system automatically delete the home folder when it deleted the user from the database?\nWhen you delete a User from System Preferences, you are asked what to do with the home folder itself. You can see from this screenshot which option you must have accidentally chosen:\n\n\nWhat's the best way to delete the old user's home folder?\nI would suggest logging into the account one last time to ensure it does not contain any files you wish to keep, and then deleting both the user record and its files (as you originally intended).

I've been toying around with AppleScript and Automator to get this thing to work, but I just can't seem wrap my head around it. If anyone could show me an example or give me some tips on how I can set an application to close at a specific time and then put the computer to sleep or shutdown, it would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: You can schedule an event once with at:\nat 23:59 <<< 'osascript -e \"quit app \\\"Mail\\\"\"; pmset sleepnow'\n\nOr to schedule it to repeat every day, edit the crontab with EDITOR=nano crontab -e and add an entry like this:\n59 23 * * * osascript -e 'quit app \"Mail\"'; pmset sleepnow\n\n\nA: I'm assuming that you'd like to initiate this procedure as opposed to having it run at a regularly scheduled time.  \nMy approach would be to initiate this from the command line, but any commands can be run in a shell script component of an Automator script with some modification. The following approach combines a few components to get the job done:\n\n\n*\n\n*A tell command to quit the application\n\n*A command-line call to put the computer to sleep\n\n*A command-line call to schedule 1 and 2 for a specific time.\n\n\n1. Telling the Application to quit\nThis can be as simple as:\nosascript -e 'tell application \"AppName\" to quit'\n\n2. Putting the computer to sleep\nHave a look at pmset for more details, but issuing the following command will put your computer to sleep:\npmset sleepnow\n\n3. Scheduling an operation to be run at a specific time\nHave a look at the at command. This command gives you the ability to specify a time for a command to run. You'll need to enable this functionality as it is not by default. To enable the atrun daemon, run the following command [reference on SU]:\nsudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.atrun.plist\n\nOnce you've enabled atrun, any command can be scheduled for a specific time by issuing\necho \"<command>\" | at HH:MM\n\nwhich works because at takes it's input from stdin by default. A simpler approach is to run commands listed in a file. A file can be executed by using the -f flag, followed by the name of the script to be run like this:\nat -f /path/to/file HH:MM\n\nPutting it all together\nWhat follows assumes that atrun is enabled. As a toy example, let's say that I want to quit Mail and put the computer to sleep at 11PM. I would create the a file containing the commands that I want run as follows:\nosascript -e 'tell application \"Mail\" to quit'\npmset sleepnow\n\nSave that file to quit-and-sleep and then run on the command line\nat -f /path/to/quit-and-sleep 23:00\n\nCaveats\nI didn't do any checking to make sure that Mail actually closed. The script also assumes that nothing else is going to get in the way of putting the computer to sleep.  I've kept it simple here as a starting point for what you want. \n\nA: Here's a strictly applescript version that accomplishes this given a hard-coded time value. You could, of course make this part interactive if you want. Also, this version assumes the time-string relates to today. \n--Get time setting for action to occur\nset t to \"3:16:30 PM\"\n--build a time string to use as a target.\nset cd to (current date) as text\nset AppleScript's text item delimiters to \" \"\nset targetTime to text items 1 thru -3 of cd\nset targetTime to date ((targetTime as text) & \" \" & t)\n\nrepeat while (current date) < targetTime\n    beep\n    delay 30 -- check the time every 30 seconds\nend repeat\n\ntell application \"Mail\"\n    quit\nend tell\n\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    display dialog \"Do you want to shut the computer down now?\"\n    if button returned of the result is \"Ok\" then\n        shutdown\n    end if\nend tell\n\n\nA: Here's code that will wait an amount of seconds before quitting the current application and going to sleep.   \ndelay (your amount of seconds here)\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    key down {command}\n    keystroke \"q\"\n    key up {command}\n    set volume \"1\"\n    say \"computer going to sleep\"\n    tell application \"Finder\"\n        sleep\n    end tell\nend tell\n\n", "Q: Is my installation of Xcode correct?

However unless you need to run a beta version you're probably better off installing Xcode from the App Store, where you can benefit from update notifications and delta upgrades.\n", "Q: Can I install Linux and Windows on a Mac to triple boot the hardware? I'm quite the newbie at operating systems etc., so forgive me if my question is dumb. Is it possible to install Linux and Windows on a Mac, to run side by side with OS X? I'm about to start a new study, and I would like the new retina MacBook Pro for it, but for my study I'm definetely going to be programming C# and for that I'll prefer Windows. And I've recently started exploring C++, and I really love Linux and would like to make some apps for it, so that's why I'd like to have Linux on there as well.\nQuestion summary: On a new retina MacBook Pro, is it possible to install Windows and Linux next to Mac OS X so I can choose which OS I want on boot?\n\nA: It's possible to install them in multiple partitions and multiboot. But the resulting setup will be a little \"rigid\".\nDoing OS X and Windows is easy. Adding Linux to the mix is a little more complicated.\nI suggest you do not multiboot and only install OS X as the main OS and then use a virtualization solution, like Parallels Desktop or VMware Fusion. With those you can basically run a whole operating system, like Windows or your favorite Linux distribution, as if they were OS X applications.\n\nA: I recommend that you check out rEFIt for your Partition boot manager on Mac.  It works great for triple booting a mac, with robust documentation.\nhttp://refit.sourceforge.net/doc/\nFirst install refit, then install Windows via BootCamp Assistant in Mac.  You will need to partition your Mac drive again and install Linux (settings depend on the distro).  It should work out of the box.  If you need more help, post on www.superuser.com\n\nA: A fairly easy way to do this is to install Windows through Bootcamp, then Ubuntu Linux using Wubi. This negates the need to install a boot loader. There's a writeup on it at lowendmac.\nIf you want to get a little more technical, or use a different Linux distro, a little familiarity with boot loaders might help. Here's a good triple boot guide that goes over the process, step by step.\n\nA: Technically, it's possible using Apple's default boot manager utility, Boot Camp. You'll need to make some extra effort to install Linux however, as Boot Camp supports Windows only officially (but, as I said, some people have already done it).\n\nA: I have a triple boot MacBook Pro (late 2013) with OS Sierra, Windows 10 and Ubuntu 16.04.\nI install macOS first, then Ubuntu, then Windows 10 \nFormat the SSD in Recovery Mode and do a clean install of Mac OS.\nBoot into mac os and use UNetbootin to make a bootable Ubuntu thumb drive.\nBoot into macOS and make 3 more partitions. I have a 500 GB SSD. partition 1 mac os 210 GB. partition 2 Windows 10 (fat 32) 117GB. partition 3 Linux 67.4 GB. partition 4 linux swap area 5GB.\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down. Boot into macOS and install rEFInd.\n\n*Shut down, insert Linux usb boot drive and Boot into Linux (ubuntu 16.04 LTS) thumb drive and install linux into linux partition (mount point /). Install swap area to swap area partition.\n\n*Shut down and remove linux thumb drive. Make sure Linux boots.\n\n*Shut down.\n\n*Boot into macOS and configure rEFInd the way you want it (or leave it stock).\n\n*Insert blank 8GB thumb drive for Bootcamp and boot into macOS. Using Bootcamp, install Windows 10 to windows 10 partition- making sure to format the windows 10 partition during installation. \n\n*Make sure to stay at computer during install and restarting of windows during installation making sure to boot into the Windows drive and not the thumb drive. Bootcamp drivers will install and restart. Make sure the computer boots to the Windows hard drive icon and not the thumb drive.\n\n*When done remove Windows usb drive created by bootcamp. This is now a bootable windows installation disk for later installs.\n\n\nDone. \nThe only problem is when you have a mac os major update or you reload the mac os as the boot files will be changes to the standard mac boot loader.\nI clone the EFI boot drive and re-copy it over when mac os messes everything up. Otherwise, you have to redo the whole process when a major os update to mac is installed.\nI bought an 8GB usb thumb drive for bootcamp bootable windows disk, a 4 GB usb thumb drive for gparted boot disk, a 8GB thumb drive for linux boot disk, 128 GB JetDrive lite SDXC card for time machine mac os backup. a 128GB thumb drive for windows 10 backup and a 64 GB for linux backup.  \n(Make sure you have UNetbootin, Windows 10.iso, Ubuntu.iso, gparted and rEFInd somewhere on your Mac partition before you backup macOS. That way you don't have to re-download all these files and all files will be there for you to re-install everything in case of problems.) \nMy partitions are:\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.3 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS OS Sierra               310.0 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3\n   4:       Microsoft Basic Data WINDOWS 10              117.0 GB   disk0s4\n   5:           Linux Filesystem LINUX                   67.4 GB    disk0s5\n   6:                 Linux Swap                         5.0 GB     disk0s6\n\n\nA: There are several methods. The easiest way is to use a program like rEFIt which is a 3rd party boot menu manager. \nBut that is NOT the best option, in my opinion, because during every boot you would need to pass through the new boot menu. I made a tutorial using a slightly more complicated method, but the results are worth it as this method does not require any 3rd party apps. By creating a hybrid Master Boot Record (MBR) for the boot camp partition, you will be able to add Two or more OSs to your bootcamp partition.\nTo boot into Linux or Windows, you would just need to press alt/option key to access the bootcamp partition, as usual. Otherwise it will boot to Mac OS X.\nBut before you start be sure you have a good backup.

Both the iPad and the iPod require a computer to sync.\n(Unless you jailbreak it, and somehow convince the iPod that the iPad is a computer with a registered version of iTunes.

I am using OS X Mountain Lion.\n\nA: You can do this by turning off the \"When switching to an application, switch to a space with open windows for the application\" checkbox in Mission Control preferences.\nHowever, this will mean that when you toggle to a different application, with Cmd+Tab or another mechanism, you'll stay in the same workspace. This may or many not be convenient for your workflow.\n\nA: You can do this by turning off the \"When switching to an application, switch to a space with open windows for the application\" checkbox in Mission Control preferences.\nThis option does next to nothing. Mission Control still switches workspaces when switching applications, closing windows, opening windows, etc. As far as I can tell, the only thing this option has any effect on whatsoever is Chrome. When I click on Chrome in the dock with a window open elsewhere, it does not switch and gives me a chance to open a new window. (However, if I make the mistake of clicking twice, I get banished from whatever it was I was working on).\nIs there any way to disable auto-switching entirely? I NEVER want to be moved to a new workspace against my will. I can't imagine this is a pleasant experience for anyone.\nThanks.\n", "Q: The free vs. inactive memory ratio on a Mac with 16 GB RAM has me concerned I am looking for clarification since I am seeing large allocations of RAM on my Mac. I have 16 GB of RAM and recently installed Windows 7 on Parallels. When the machine runs, I see 3.55 GB Free memory and 8.39 GB Inactive memory. I do not want my RAM to be hogged by Windows if I only need it for a small task and am concerned about a slowly running Mac in this case.\nMight the huge amount of inactive memory be due to Parallels being run recently? I am not sure if Parallels is the culprit. Moreover, Wired and Active memories show 2 and 2.13 GB, respectively. The total Used memory is 12.54 GB which means the majority (12.54 GB of 16 GB) of RAM is committed now.\nThis seems too much. How can I diagnose what is exactly eating up my RAM? I have a retina MacBook Pro and the 10.8 release of Mountain Lion. When I launch Parallels, the increase in memory is allocated to \"Wired\" yet Inactive memory is still 8GB.\nIs what I am seeing explainable?\n\nA: Free memory has nothing in it. Inactive memory caches recently used information just in case the system might use it again. This is especially beneficial for file storage.\nThe system only needs a tiny amount of free memory so the program asks for memory to be allocated it doesn't have to page some other active memory out to disk and cause that program to stall momentarily while the virtual memory system is doing housekeeping. The overhead for the system to release inactive memory is almost immeasurably short so worrying about a large amount of that memory is generally not worth your brainpower to even think about it.\nIn summary:\n\n\n*\n\n*Inactive memory: this is always good, it makes the system fast.\n\n*Free memory: any more than 200 MB is a waste, so the system will keep adding files and/or code to inactive memory until free memory hits a low-water benchmark based on a few factors.\n\n\nWhat you describe seems perfectly normal for a system that has been recently booted and doesn't seem to me to be anything of concern. VMware fusion or Parallels clearly has need to access a lot of files when running Windows 7 and they are likely to be the reason for your large amount of inactive memory.\nIf, however, you wish to diagnose what is using memory, the sysdiagnose program will run several memory allocation utilities and saves the results to a directory.\n\nA: I'm a designer and what's happening to me is barely the same. I'm using Snow Leopard and have a MacBook Pro 15\" (i7) with 8GB Ram, 500GB (180GB free) (2010 model).\nI usually use Chrome (4/5 tabs), Firefox (1/2 tabs), Skype, VM Ware Fusion (with Win XP, using only 512MB), Photoshop CS5, Adium, iTunes, maybe Filezilla.\nPhotoshop is the main Ram user. It can eat up to 3GB or more as time rolls by, and I'm not working with very big files, 50mb max, and only 2 or 3 open.\nWhen you start opening programs everything works fine. It's later on that you see that you have very (and I mean veryy) little Free Ram left. Between 8MB and 15MB.\nAt the same time I have 2.21 GB of Inactive Memory.\nThe machine gets much slower once you get below 150MB of Free Memory, and it's a total lie that Inactive Memory gets released onto other programs to overcome this slowness. It never gets released until you close the program.\nI wanted to post a screenshot of my Activity Monitor but your site doesn't allow it if I'm a new user.\nOnce your Free memory gets to these levels (15MB), the Page Outs start increasing and the Inactive Memory never gets released. It gets laggy.\nPlease don't tell me that a 2010 Macbook Pro with 8GB is not enough to work with Photoshop on small to medium sized files.\nNormal users (internet, skype, movie watching, etc.) won't have this problem, but if you use it for design or more heavy tasks, it doesn't work properly.\nI think this is a very important issue that has never been addressed. I don't know if Mountain Lion has solved this, but I've been searching around and haven't read good commentaries (they even say Mountain Lion eats up more Ram).\nDo you know if a MacBook Air i5/i7 8GB 256GB SSD will improve on this matter? Do SSD's improve Ram usage? \nI'm planning on changing the MacBook Pro (not because of this, because of it's size).\nThanks, Jimmy\n", "Q: Burning songs to a virtual CD I have a playlist of 180 songs that I downloaded from the internet. I imported it into iTunes, but all the data for the songs was put into their name. for example: 001 - artist - song title was put into the ‘song name’ section and the rest of the data fields were left blank. I tried getting track names from gracenote or whatever iTunes uses, but it said that I need to import the songs through iTunes in order to do that. \nSo basically, what I want is a way that I can burn the 180 songs (1.5gb) onto a virtual CD and then have iTunes import from the CD. \nI have tried using Toast Titanium’s burn to .dmg function but it has a 99 song limit for burning CD’s. I have also tried using Virtual CD-RW but Finder wouldn't let me burn the files to the virtual CD it had created because there was ‘not enough space on the disk’ \nIs there an app that can create a virtual CD (CD-R/CD-RW) that I can burn 1.5gb of music to?\n\nA: No music formatted CD can hold 1.5 GB. I suspect most virtual CD software will deliberately limit the maximum contents size to 800 MB to mimic real CD limits.\nHave you considered using a script to extract the information from the filename and set the results as metadata?\nManage MP3 ID3 tag information from the command line discusses a suitable command line tool available.\niTunes supports AppleScript and the Doug Scripts web site appears to have a good selection of example scripts.\n", "Q: How many photos will fit on a 16 GB  iPad? I am interested about an iPad for my mom and can't decide whether to go for 16GB or 32GB. Assuming no movies on it, and minimal amount of apps (she will use it mainly for browsing and skype) how many photos can fit on a 16GB?\n\nA: Short answer: 16GB should be fine for photos.\nLong Answer: Your question is hard to answer with any accuracy as photos come in a variety of sizes depending on resolution, subject matter etc. For example, a photo taken on your 3GS iphone will be smaller than one taken on your 4GS iphone, which will also be smaller than one taken on your nikon DSLR digital camera. And as you could also reduce the image size based on how you want the photos to appear on your ipad, it becomes a bit more complicated to answer.\nHowever, some math might give you a better idea at least.\n1GB = 1024 MB so 16GB is 16384MB. Assuming you lose say 4GB for the in built apps and skype etc. we could say you might be left with 12GB or 12288MB. \nLet's assume your mother isn't a professional photographer with a 30 megapixel dslr camera, but for the sake of being conservative we'll say all of her photos are taken on a hi definition camera, like the iPhone 4s. Depending on a variety of factors the photo size will range from about 1.5mb to 3mb at full size (bearing in mind these are still HUGE photos at full res.) If we say 2.25 is an average photo size, you're still left with roughly 5,500 photos on your spare 12GB of space. \nBearing in mind this is still pretty conservative the answer is that your mum can store literally thousands of photos in her 16GB iPad. If you weren't using a really hi def camera like the 4s iPhone, your photo sizes could be as small as 100 or 200 kb's each and the number is more like 50,000 photos. \nHope that's helped.\n\nA: It depends on how big each of the photo files are. If they are all exactly the same, you can get a rough estimate by dividing the hard drive size by the file size.\nIf each photo is 120kb in size, and the operating system on the iPad is 3.4 gb, you can use the formula:\n(16-3.4)gb/120kb = 105,000 photos\n(32-3.4)gb/120kb = 238,333 photos.\nOr more generically: \n(Hard-Drive-Size - 3.4gb) / (Average-photo-file-size) = estimated photo capacity\n\nA: It will probably be able to hold a couple hundered pictures, because on my 16gb iPad, I have 125 photos, but it still keeps saying \"storage almost full.\" Still, I am taking pictures, which means I can still keep taking as many pictures as I want to until my iPad gets up to 16gb's.\n\nA: Back up to Google photo - The free cloud. \n", "Q: Is there a way to get iBooks to display the generic cover for my PDFs? Most (all) of my PDF's I read on iBooks are actual novels or textbooks. Is there a way to force iBooks to use the generic book cover rather than the first page of the PDF document? I'm tired of trying to find a book I want to read when all I'm seeing for thumbnails are the start of the copyright information...\n\nA: You could convert them all to ePub using Calibre. Add the ePubs to iTunes and they should sync with iBooks. As not all PDFs are formatted the same, some will show the generic cover while some will show the first page when converted to ePub. You can change the cover art for each book individually in iTunes, by selecting the book > Right click > Get Info > Artwork.\n", "Q: Mountain Lion Figlet through MacPorts error?

I am a web developer and am wondering why os x comes a long with a lot of gnu tools (nano, bash, vim). How can apple provide them in their closed-source system when the GPL forbidds this?\nRegards,\nBodo\n\nA: The basic philosophy in the GNU world is that they want you to be able to change their software, and anything which requires their software.  (This is their definition of \"Free Software\")\nThis essentially implies you need access to the source of all GPL software in a form so you can change things and install a new binary.\nFor programs which use GPL libraries directly (\"linked with\") they want you to have that ability too for those programs.   For programs not linking with but invoking through a command line (like \"gcc -o foo foo.c\") this does not apply, as you can just use another c compiler instead.  This is intentional and the GCC license address the fact that you can use it to create non-GPL'ed software.\nMany commercial Unix server distributions have included GNU software over the years, but they have faded away.  To my knowledge there is only Solaris and AIX left with any serious market impact (due to their ecosystem).  \nSo, yes, Apple can include and ship GPL'ed software as long as they provide the sources you need to change that software yourself.\n\nA: GPL does not forbid delivering software as binary. In case of OS X you can separate the GNU software. It's not linked but comes in individual binaries.\nTo make it GPL compliant you have to deliver the source and the licence. The source is available at http://opensource.apple.com/ .\n", "Q: What causes me to be unable to burn Windows 7 ISO due to a medium error?

If you watched a full length movie from a USB drive, it would cause the computer to have to constantly access that drives hard disk, and unless it was hooked directly to the motherboard like the internal hard disk, it would need to go through several different technologies (cable, serial bus, driver, etc) that the normal hard disk didn't have to, which would all cause the computer to have to run just that extra little harder to play your movie.\nIt doesn't seem like much, but if you're on a laptop, it will surely cause your battery to drain faster.\n", "Q: How to avoid the GUI password prompt when using `osascript`? I’d like to use the osascript shell command to run some AppleScript, but I’d rather avoid the GUI password prompt.

But washing it with water and letting it dry in the shade for a few days should not cause a problem. If any, you should be worried about rusting any metal and not about the membrane, which is made up of rubber or plastic.\nEDIT: Don’t forget to remove the batteries!!!\n\nA: Use isopropyl alcohol (rubbing alcohol). Remove batteries. Pour some around the keys that are hard to press, tap on them vigorously so that the alcohol reaches every spot and drain the alcohol. Leave to dry.\n\nA: http://www.wikihow.com/Clean-a-Keyboard-in-a-Dishwasher\nthis i have heard from numerous websites, though if you have a very expensive keyboard like mine with built in macro software and other numerous features or a touch pad etc i wouldn't be to quick to slap it in the dish washer on a cool run. when my keyboard kets dirty i usually turn it upside down proceeded by lots of shaking, but that only removes dust. about once per year i just dismantle the whole thing screws on the back and all and clean the whole lot with the alcohol wipes usually you can get to the keyboard key mechanics without any problems and give them a good wipe if any have become sticky. if you keyboard does not have access to the button you can usually prize off the keys of that sort of board and clean them individually, fortunately the design of keyboard is as such that cleaning them no matter how messy can be done with little fuss and a screwdriver.\nkeep you screws you take out in a bowl so they don't run away, remember what order you took it to pieces (you can take photos) and then reverse the process to put it back together after cleaning. they are very hard to break. under the keys there is sometimes a white protective film on top of a rubber sleve that is always present this is on top of a white film that has the contacts that leads to a very small circuit board where you plug it into the computer.\nwashing electronics in water is fine. the idea behind this is that electronics only stop working when the contacts on the components break. this happens when people get electronics wet then put them someplace warm then the electronic board begins to expand under the heat, usually unevenly, this causes various components to break away from the electronic board.\nso you can wet the hell out of a mother board or a phone or anything providing you do not change the temperature, no components will move, the item drys out. then you may plug it in though some electronics may take several months to dry out such a phones and you must make sure they remain at 20 degrees the whole time. if you plug it in before it drys it will short and not come on until its dry. having said all this its not great to grab a board and flush it with water unless it is your last resort because although in theory it is fine it can still warp and change things which is not so great.\n", "Q: What causes an iMessage to be delivered as a text message?

When I click with the right mouse button on the Messages icon on the dock bar, I see there  is a \"Show Recents\" menu item.\n\nWhen I click on it, the only thing it seems to do is showing me a Finder window. It hides the other windows, and when I click on the desktop, the window I was seeing before re-appears. In my case, I had Safari open, and its window was hidden until I didn't click on the desktop.\n\nWhat is that menu item supposed to do? Is it working correctly?\nUpdate: It doesn't seem that menu is specific for the Messages application. Dock icons for applications that are not running show that menu item. I don't see it for Mission Control, Launchpad, Downloads and Trashcan. I see that menu item for System Preferences, and Reminders, for example.\n\n\nA: The official documentation is very thin for messages (it doesn't even have an entry in the Applications section of OS X support online)\nIt could be working correctly if it's just a stub to allow you to see some recent messages when the application is not running, but that functionality isn't present today. Once you start up the app, the Show Recents menu item in the dock is suppressed and you instead get to show the various windows that the app could have open.\nSo - it's useless and could get hidden if it's simply a bug or perhaps an update will add this functionality so that it actually shows something that has happened recently since it doesn't show any recent activity at 10.8 build 12A269.\n\nA: I finally found an application for which that menu item does something.\nWith Coda 2, a text editor for web developers, when I click on \"Show Recents\":\n\n\n*\n\n*The screen dims, as it happens when using the Dashboard\n\n*The windows shown in the screen disappear\n\n*An icon for each of the most recently open files for that application appears\n \nI am now using OS X 10.8.2; it could be that something has been between the moment I asked this question and the moment I answered it.

The only difference seems that now the Finder window doesn't appear anymore, not even for applications without recently open files.\nAs side note, this menu item seems to be shown when \"Show All Windows\" is not shown; for an open application, \"Show Recents\" is always replaced with \"Show All Windows.\"\n\nI guess that happens because an application normally shows a list of recently open files in its dock menu, when active.\nNow, I wish the applications would be able to say to the OS if the \"Show Recent\" menu item does make sense for them. An application that usually opens a specific hardcoded file (and only that) should not show that menu item.\n", "Q: geolocate iPad via Dropbox activity Is it possible to find the location of an iPad via Dropbox activity? \nWe are looking for a 'lost' iPad and don't have any other app that might be able to give us information.\n\nA: While you can sometimes geolocate an IP address (which you can find out from Dropbox on the website by clicking the account name, settings, security, and the \"i\" by the relevant device) and typing this into an IP geolocation service, it will not usually show you a location anywhere near where that IP address is in use. In fact different services can report completely different locations.\nThe IP could be used by the police to request that information from the ISP themselves with a warrant though as they will hold records on where it's currently in use, and would be by a single location.\nThere are some caveats though, the IP could be a public hotspot, or a company which allows VPN access which means it could be anywhere.\nAll Dropbox can give you is the IP and hostname of the device though, so unless you're able to take it through the route of legal proceedings, it's unlikely.\n", "Q: Is there a way to disable iCloud documents only Does anyone know if there is a way to disable iCloud for documents only?

I could drag a window an inch, release it, and then pick it up and drag it to another desktop just fine.\n\n*The \"new desktop\" button never seems to suffer from this problem.\n\n*The problem also occurs on the guest account.\n\n\nAny ideas how to fix it, or why it's happening? Any help is appreciated.\n\nA: This has been killing me, too. But I went into the MC preferences pane and unchecked \"Group windows by application.\" It worked.\n\nA: If you'd like, there is a keyboard shortcut which allows moving windows between desktops. All you need to do is to to go to System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Keyboard Shortcuts -> Mission Control and enable Switch to Desktop 1, 2 ,... n Desktops you have.\nThen in order to move the window you need to move your mouse to start dragging the window and then use Switch to Desktop keyboard shortcut.\n", "Q: Preview auto-open of PNG files after being downloaded from Safari How can I make PNG files be automatically opened after being downloaded from Safari?\n\nA: This might be related to a preference in Safari rather than Preview.\nOpen Safari, then Preferences, then go to the General tab.

I see that Mountain Lion has come preinstalled with 4 versions of the Dvorak keyboard layout. I do not think these versions are \"Programmer's Dvorak.\" I found a version of this layout here: http://www.kaufmann.no/roland/dvorak/\nAfter installing it I had no luck finding it in my System Preferences. Does anyone know if this layout is available under Mountain Lion?\n\nA: It does seem to work on 10.8, but you have to log out and back in after running the installer.\n\nA: You should run\nsudo rm -f /System/Library/Caches/com.apple.IntlDataCache.le*\nin order to invalidate layout caches, and then you will see Programmer's layout in the list.\n", "Q: Keyboard Shortcut for Notification Center not working The keyboard shortcut \"Show Notification Center\" you can set under System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Mission Control stopped working for me after a restart. \nI tried resetting to defaults, changing the short cut and finally exiting all running apps and processes - nothing seems to bring back the short cut.\nDoes anybody know how to debug this or a plist where I can manually edit this?\n\nA: Resetting PRAM worked: https://discussions.apple.com/message/19284693?ac_cid=ms123456#19284693\n\nA: Resetting PRAM does not solve the issue for everyone (including another poster in the above thread, and myself).\nI worked around it locally by using the MacOS Automator to create a new Workflow. The workflow had a single \"Run Applescript\" action in it where the applescript is as follows:\non run {input, parameters}\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        tell process \"Notification Center\"\n            click menu bar item 1 of menu bar 1\n        end tell\n    end tell    \nend run\n\nThen I saved the workflow and used BetterTouchTool (http://www.boastr.de/) to bind a \"Start Automator Workflow\" trigger to a a keyboard shortcut. \n\nA: Resetting PRAM didn't work for me either. Chris Kline's solution is great, but I don't think the AppleScript is compatible with Mavericks or Yosemite.\nThis AppleScript works in Yosemite:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    click menu bar item 1 of menu bar 2 of application process \"SystemUIServer\"\nend tell\n\nBetterTouchTool, as Chris mentioned, or Alfred (http://www.alfredapp.com/) can be used to assign a hotkey to the script.\n", "Q: Multiple installs of the same application? Is there any way to have multiple installs of the same application (in the same user account)?\nBasically, I have several google reader accounts, and I want to be able to have multiple instances of Reeder. As it is, changing accounts at the moment involves restarting the app, and manually typing the different account info in. At that point, you have access to only one of the accounts, and switching involves the whole rigamarole again.\nIs there any way I can have something like a sandbox for each instance, with it's own keychain?\n\nI have Xcode installed, and I would imagine there is some mechanism in Xcode for letting programs have separate keychain/info, for when you are testing an app you have compiled. Is there something like this and/or how do you use it?\n\nA: You can do this with Reeder. \n\n\n*\n\n*You will need as many user accounts as you have Google accounts. \n\n*Supposing you have 2 Google accounts, you can obviously run your main Google account as the default user. Just click on Reeder from Launcher or Dock and you are good to go. \n\n*Go to System Preferences, Users & Groups, and create a new user. Call it TestUser. Make sure you set a password. A standard user account would do.\n\n*Open Terminal. \n\n*execute this: echo \"password\" | sudo -S -u TestUser /Applications/Reeder.app/Contents/MacOS/Reeder & \n\n\nvoila! You can now see a 2nd Reeder window! \n\nA: Create a new desktop user for each different Google Reader account. Then you may use fast switching between accounts to change to the desired user (there's a menu bar available for that).\nYou may also be able to use a shell command to launch a process under the same window manager from another user. Say su other_user -c 'open /Applications/Reeder.app'. I've done this to launch GUI applications as root. I toyed around with opening Chrome using that approach, but it seems like the keychain isn't initialized correctly in that case -- it might be trying to read the keychain from the host user. You may be able to resolve that by first logging in as the user, creating the keychain, and then running the script.\nAddendum: I'm not sure if an App Store program will launch as another user, having different authentication (I haven't used App Store yet). If that's the case, I would create a script to temporarily modify the keychain, launch Reeder, and then recreate the original. That's a pretty grotesque approach, though.\n\nA: Depends on the app, I imagine this is perfectly possible for some, and not for others.  It depends on whether the app is self contained in it's own bundle, or if it requires the use of ancillary file in your ~/library folder, such as plists etc.  Use of such plist files etc is often where your settings and preferences are stored including account settings, and having multiple instances of the application will still result in them all looking in the same location for the plist file.\nYou could wrap your application binary in some scripting to move the correct plist in place before starting each instance, but again app dependant, there is no guarantee that an app already running will continue to run if it's plist changes, or it it will just take on the new settings at some point.\n\nA: If the app came from anywhere other than the App Store, I'd suggest you had a reasonable chance of poking around inside the app bundle and maybe changing what it considered its name to be by editing a .plist and hoping that the name influenced the keychain usage.\nHowever, as Reeder is an App Store app, I suspect you're stuck. If you modify the app, its signature will become invalid and the OS won't let you run it. Unless there's some sort of self-signing hack you can do...\n\nA: No - the keychain is a deeply embedded system interface where the mapping is strongly tied to the user home folder (the application doesn't get to choose which user's keychain to access as the system tells it which literal folder maps to ~).\nHowever, the only special case where this will work is for applications that are programmed in with code to read a configuration file (plist file, .dotfile, or other mechanism) and you could use automation to set those run time variables, settings or directly manipulate the .plist files before launching the app in question.\n\n\n*\n\n*Platypus would be my choice for a shell script to change things and then launch the app and bundling things.\n\n*Keychain Scripting might also scratch your itch if you could retrieve the name of the keychain item you wanted to pass into the app to get different behavior each launch.\n\n\nThe system doesn't have a view of sandbox for this separation of data other than if you were to literally start a second user session (which Lion and later allow) but the app would need to opuput the data to a pipe or a file rather than exist on screen as a running app from a different user. \nShort of writing this tool yourself (you do have Xcode after all), there isn't something that Apple provides to automate keychain sandboxing as I understand you describing it.\n\nA: The only way to achieve this with applications that do not have native multi-account support would be to patch the CFBundleIdentifier which is also used by the application to find passwords on keychains. You can change that by editing the Info.plist file in the application bundle. This will break the digital signature of the application, so always work on a copy.\nWith Reeder being an application from the Mac AppStore this will break the digital signature of the application rendering it non-launchable. So you will need to remove all signs of Contents/_CodeSignature/CodeResources as well. Then this might work unless the application does additional bundle checking that will prevent this. (Which is something I don't know in the case of Reeder.) When that actually works, you will need to launch the application with a secondary-click (right click, two-finger click or ctrl-click) then selecting “Open” from the contextual menu and confirming the subsequent warning from Gatekeeper. (I definitely can not recommend to turn off Gatekeeper completely.)\nOf course you will need to do all these steps for each and every copy after each update of Reeder again. (With the risk that Reeder may add additional checks at any time rendering this process not working anymore.)\nOther solutions may be to use different RSS clients for your multiple accounts and requesting multi-account support from the developers.\n\nA: I am betting here, but some applications cannot be opened twice and I cannot buy Reeder for tests purposes. However, I suppose that you cannot open it twice. What happens when you duplicate the .app and try opening both different .app's? If something like that works, you could try having a duplicate .app and maybe find the contents that you want shared or which can be shared between both of these as symbolic links from the copy referencing the original or main app.\nDoes something like this help somehow?\n", "Q: How do I disable images in Safari 6.0? In Safari 6.0 the 'Appearance' tab from 'Preferences' was omitted.\nHow can I now switch “Display images when the page opens” on/off ?\n\nA: Open Safari and go to Preferences, then click on the Advanced tab.  There's a checkbox at the bottom titled \"Show Develop menu in menu bar\".  Check that then close the Preferences window.  \nYou'll notice that in your menu bar between Bookmarks and Window you have a menu called Develop.

In Safari 5 you could just change the Reader.html file inside of the Safari.app to use a sans-serif font.\nThis Reader.html does not exist in Safari 6.\nHow do I manage to change the font of Safari Reader (6)?\nI hate to read serif fonts.\n\nA: Add a rule like this to /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Safari.framework/Versions/A/Resources/Reader.html:\n.page, h1.title {\n  font-family: 'Avenir Next' !important;\n}\n\nThe !important is required because a .page div has an inline style attribute that overrides the fonts in Reader.html.\n\nA: You can also change the Reader.html CSS on iPad, iPhone or iPod, confirmed working on iOS8.1.2 iPad Air 2.\nYou will need to Jailbreak your iOS device, and download a file system managing app called iFile. Then you'll have full Explorer/Finder functionality on your iOS device.\nNext, navigate to the folder:\n\n/var/stash/_.HVRQId/Applications/MobileSafari.app/Reader.html\n\nThis is the location on my iPad Air 2 with iOS 8.1.2, it may differ for you. If you upgrade to the paid version of iFile for $4, you can do a search system wide for the Reader.html file, which is what I did.\nOpen in Text Viewer, now just change the CSS as desired, anywhere you see the \"font: -apple-system-*\" declaration. \nIf you want to change the main body typography, add a font-family declaration to the .page tag. For example:\n  .page {\n        font: -apple-system-body;\n        text-align: start;\n        font-family: Georgia;\n\n}\nYou can do the same thing to edit the page heading under the h1.title tag\nh1.title {\n        font: -apple-system-headline;\n        font-weight: normal;\n        text-align: start;\n        -webkit-hyphens: manual;\n        font-family: Georgia;\n    }\n\nSave Reader.html, reload the Safari webpage, and enjoy your new Reader font!\n", "Q: Lion special characters input at Snow Leopard Is there any 3rd party app to enable special character input on holding key for Snow Leopard same it is at Lion?\nThanks a lot.\n\nA: Unfortunately no, I was also looking for this.\nThe closest I found was going to System Preferences, then International, then in the Input Menu tab, select Character Palette.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have only one keyboard input, this will add a menu item on the top right.\n\n*If you have more than one keyboard input, this item will be added below the flags of your keyboard inputs.\n\n\nWhen you open the Character palette, you'll see on its left the categories of characters. I often work with mathematics so the Math and Greek categories are useful to me. If you click on the bottom Character Info, it will show all related characters to the one you selected above in the palette.\ne.g. if you choose the Latin 'u', you will see ü, û, ù, µ, etc. Double-click on any of those and it will paste itself on your working document.\nHope this could (partially) resolve your question.\n", "Q: Could iCloud be replaced by a personal WebDAV server? I like to run all my own data services (for security and confidentiality).\nI'm wondering whether anyone has tried to replace iCloud with a personal server.\nI presume that a combination of server side WebDAV plus jabber might do the trick together with some client side scripting and sculpting of the hosts file.\nThe aim would be to as completely as possible replace Apple's services but still use the OS X and iOS integration for documents and messages between a single user's devices.\n\nA: Simple answer: No\nMore exact answer: Maybe.\nYou would need to have a inside knowledge of the internal processes of the iCloud. The iCloud is not just one server, but many of them with different parts (Key Value Storage, Document storage, ....)\nI don't think it's possible to replace them without extreme inside knowledge.\nFor more info about what exactly the iCloud is (much more than just a file server) you could read this Mountain Lion Review from John Siracusa\nOf course there are other services which provide the same tools for managing reminders, todos, ... But there isn't a direct replacement for the iCloud and I can't imagine that there will ever be one. That would fundamentally contradict with apples philosophy of a closed and controlled environment.\n\nA: Have a look at ownCloud which provides Calendar, Notes and File Sharing. It can be installed on any hosted or own server.\n\nA: I run Calendar, Contacts, WebDAV, and VPN as a service on OS X and can access it from my iDevice. It's not as complex as iCloud (as in offering a lot of features and being replicated across multiple data centers in different geographic regions, but for my personal use, it works fine.)\nWhile having multiple geographic locations is nice, it's not necessary. If you have the money, find another location near your residence so that data is transferred to and from quickly. \nIf you live on the east coast and only travel on the east coast, having a Mac colocated on the west coast is almost pointless. Sure someone can say, well what if a hurricane destroyed the east coast. Well my response, most likely my ISP or cell carrier will be down anyway and I'd have bigger issues to worry about - like finding a new home maybe.\n", "Q: Mail in Mountain Lion does not search mail server Ever since upgrading to Mountain Lion, I don't get the full search results when searching my Mail.

I'd like to turn off my iMac display while connected to it via a remote desktop session.  I'm using TeamViewer or LogMeIn, and unfortunately the screen stays on during those sessions when it really doesn't need to be on.\nIs there any way to set the screen to off while in use?  \nNote:  I don't want to put the display to sleep because that will only last until I start typing or move the mouse.  \n\nA: You can try RedScreen (I don't have an iMac to test it). I read that it can not only decrease the screen brightness beyond OS X defaults (like others do) but also control the screen backlight. You can bypass the default red tinting mode and just use these brightness controls.\n\nA: You could turn the brightness on the machine all the way down, which will effectively blank out the screen until the brightness is set up again. \n\nA: If you would not mind using Voice Over, VO has the option of turning the screen black, called screen curtain. You must have VO on to use the screen curtain. To turn Voice over on use command f5, to enable screen curtain press VO (control and option) shift f11, to turn the screen back on use the same key combination. I am not sure how this will work while screen sharing.

Is there any way to move a contact in Contacts on my iPhone into a group? I can create a new contact in any group, but I don't see a way to move an existing contact between groups.\nSeems like an oversight that I would have to go back to my Mac, or delete a contact and manually recreate their card in a different group, in order to do this.\n\nA: *\n\n*Go to \"groups\" in \"Contacts\" and uncheck all the groups except the one the contact you want to move is in.\n\n*Search for the contact you want to move and \"Share\" the contact  to your own email address or phone # via text. \n\n*Click \"edit\" on the contact you just sent and delete it.\n\n*Go back to Groups and uncheck the group the contact was sent from.\n\n*Leave only the Group you want the contact in checked.\n\n*Go to your email/text and import the new contact.  It will automatically be added to the only active group which you selected.\n\n*Go back to Contact Groups and select all the groups you want showing on your phone.\nVoila!   \n\nA: This cannot be done on the phone. You can sync your contacts to a Mac and do the changes from Address Book on the Mac.\nYou can also do this via iCloud.com.\n\nA: Use Orbi Tools. Can be downloaded from App Store.\n\nA: For the specific case of moving contacts to Gmail/Google, you can move them on the web using iCloud.com and google.com/contacts.\nThe basic flow is: select the contacts you want to move in iCloud, export them as a VCF file, then import that VCF file in Google Contacts. Then, if you would like your device to stick with Google Contacts, in your iOS device turnoff Contacts sync for iCloud so that future contacts don't end up there (and end up in Google Contacts instead).\nDetails are in this article Get all your iCloud contacts into Gmail, easily. \n\nA: Moving contacts between groups cannot be done via iPhone. You will have to sync your iPhone via iTunes and ensure that contact sync in enabled. The following process can also be used with your GMail account instead of Exchange.\nTo move the existing contacts, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect your iPhone to your Mac.\n\n*Open iTunes and look for your iPhone under devices in the left navigation section.\n\n*Click on your iPhone to view iPhone sync settings.\n\n*Click on the Info tab at the top of the sync section.\n\n*On the Info tab, select the checkbox next to 'Sync address book contacts'\n\n*Click Sync on the bottom right corner of the sync section.\n\n\nThe above instructions will sync your iPhone contacts to your Address Book on Mac.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Address Book.\n\n*Add your exchange account, if you have not done it already.\n\n*After that you can move your iPhone contacts to your exchange account by dragging-and-dropping.\n\n\nYou should also configure the iPhone settings so that newly created contacts are created in the correct place, so you don't need to repeat this process,\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings -> Mail, Contacts, Calendars\n\n*Scroll to 'Contacts' section\n\n*Tap on the 'Default Account' tab and select your exchange account.\n\n\nYou should be set now!\n\nA: i think i have a perfect solution for this.\nLet me explain the issue,\nI have an iphone 6 which is now 5 years old and in all this time i have changed multiple jobs, i had a company exchange account and at some point all my contacts were being saved into that account. i moved on, they deleted my account so i could not login and my most of the contacts lived in that group. It complained about the password to that exchange account which i ignored and it still worked.\nBut comes 2020.\ni move on to a new iphone, i realise my icloud can not help, itunes is out of game no more even supported on catalina ios.\nI came across this app on apple store for iphone MCbackup it works wonder,\nno setup, no fee, no subscription, no activation nothing\nI simply gave access to contacts, it copied everything from all the groups and gave me option to send a csv or vcard which i then sent to my email.\nAfterwards i now use only gmail for contacts and then easily imported this csv into it.\n\nNow all historical contacts are working for me. :) i hope this helps you all.\n\n\nA: Ten years after this question was asked iOS contacts now support editing \"list\" / Contact relationships within the Contacts app on iPhone. On iPhone they call \"Groups\" \"Lists\".\n(I can't find an official Apple reference about this but it's a nice implementation. I wonder if they are slightly embarrassed about adding it so late.)\n\nA: As noted above changes can be made via Mac or iCloud web GUI. I use Contaqs.app on my iPhone to make Group/Contact edits. Within a Contact I can remove Group relationships, in a Group I can add Contacts, or with a Contact selected I can drag/drop to a group to add it.\nThere are other 3rd party solutions, this is just one I've used that continues to be maintained and is useful in other ways.\n", "Q: Can't ever remove partition?

It has the glossy glass screen and I'm able to see everybody behind me by just changing the focus of my sight. It's a bit weird.\nHow do you get used to this mirror/screen?\n\nA: You could also use something like a 3M privacy filter to give it a bit more of a matte appearance and reduce the glare. \n\nA: It is just a matter of time. You do eventually get used to it (I had to). However, the glare will almost always be noticeable. Unfor tunately, this is because of the glass used on the screen. If this is really bothersome, make sure you order the non-glossy screen (another $150). The new retina display MacBook Pro and the newer MacBook Airs have a less glossy screen that the current MacBook Pros.\nIf it really bothers you now, you may want to look into getting a screen protector. Here is a MacWorld article comparing a couple protectors. I also found one on Amazon. I will note that I have never used on of these.\n\nA: My advice would be to either invest in a matte-style screen protector as others have suggested or to adjust the screen in ways that reduce the glare problem.  I usually combat glare problems by increasing brightness or just moving the laptop around until I find a good spot with minimal glare.  That said, you do get used to the reflections over time.\n\nA: I don't think this is something you can get used to if it really irritates you.\nThe obvious solutions or countermeasures to control reflected light from the glass screen are available:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apply a surface film or treatment to diffuse the reflections.\n\n*Apply a polarization filter. (Polarized glasses could potentially help, but I've never been happy with polarized glasses indoors looking at an LCD for more than a moment to entertain myself. The 3M privacy filters however are incredibly good if that's your thing.)\n\n*Investigate computer distance specific glasses to reduce eye strain so your eyes can focus for longer times on the screen than the reflections. (I have seen incredible increases in comfort from having your optometrist check your eyes for close focus and any need for correction there.)\n\n*Control the lighting ratio between the items behind you and your immediate workspace. A bright tasklight on the keyboard and above the display will not reflect from your display and will reduce your eye's sensitivity to reflected light from the screen.\n\n*Control the angle of the screen (send the offensive reflections above your eye level if possible).\n\n*Screen your work area from behind (above or below depending on the angle you can accept for the main screen. I have seen a matte partition hanging above standing eye level work wonders for people that work with the glassy cinema displays and other countermeasures have failed).\n\n\nYou could try the easiest of these and hope that in time your eyes learn to focus near so the reflections are out of focus, but unless this irritation is quite new, your eyes may have adapted as much as they can and you will need to look into a different location or exchange the machine for a different display. The Air and Retina MacBook pro are not as reflective as the glassed over displays but also not nearly as anti-reflective as the optional wide-screen anti-glare display that you can configure on some of the 15 inch MacBook Pro models.\n", "Q: iPhone 4S Message Display Format Is there a way to display sent/received iMessages in a vertical format rather than the current left/right bubble formate?\n\nA: No. This is not something that is built into iOS.\nThere may be an option if you were to jailbreak your phone.\n", "Q: Is there a Safari 5 download still on apple.com somewhere? My friend's mother-in-law upgraded to Safari 6 and is now panicking because she doesn't have separate address and search fields. Is there somewhere on apple.com where she can download a Safari 5 installer? She's still running Lion so that shouldn't be an issue.\nUnfortunately, telling her to relax and get used to it isn't an option. It's like when my mother's Safari started defaulting to Top Sites and she nearly started crying.\n\nA: Take a look at this question on Ask Different. How do you remove Safari 6 on Mac OS X 10.7.4\nI had the same problem when I upgraded and was able to switch back following this answer.\n\nA: Safari 5.1.1 for Lion can still be downloaded from apple.com.\nHope this helps!\n\nA: No!\nI had the same problem, when I reinstalled Snow Leopard lately.\nApple strangely took all pages for the latest Safari 5 version offline and they also don't deliver Safari 5 updates via the integrated software update anymore.\nCurrently they're providing no way to update to the latest Safari version 5.1.7 after a reinstall of an \"older\" OS X.\nBUT, there are some pages providing a mirror for download:\nhttp://mac.softpedia.com/progDownload/Safari-Download-25616.html\n\nA: You can go to OldVersion.com to search for older versions of software.

I recently started ripping and adding some of my TV Shows from DVD and I've stumbled into a problem.\nSome of TV shows episodes are played consecutively (one-by-one without my intervention) while some are not and after the playback the screen goes back to episode selection menu. This happens on iTunes 11.0.5 on Windows and the versions available since mid-2012. Similarly Apple TV is updated anytime a software update is released for that device as I always use the latest stable software available. I play the movies/TV shows on my Apple TV via HomeSharing.\nMy guess is that I must have tagged some of them badly and they're not recognized as consecutive or of the same titles maybe. \nCan someone suggest what I might have done wrong?\n\nA: If you create a Playlist or Smart Playlist and choose the episode from that it will continue to the next item auotmatically.\n\nA: I've always found that if I just go into the library using the AppleTV regularly, it will always return me to the Episode selection screen, however if I use the Remote app on my iPhone or iPad to first select the AppleTV, and then point it at my iTunes library, and then select the episode (all on the Remote app, without changing any screens on my AppleTV till I select an episode), then the episodes will play one after the other. This is a very consistent thing for me at least :)\n\nA: Select the track in iTunes and Get Info. On the 3rd tab (\"Video\") ensure that the Season Number and Episode Number are correctly filled out. Also double check that the Sorting tab is blank (this is only necessary if you are custom sorting tracks).\n\nA: Instead of going into the episode details page and clicking \"play\" from there, you can hit the \"play\" button on the remote from the season episode list to directly play the file. Sorry if this was obvious- I just discovered this after using the Apple TV for six months.\nIt saves you a few seconds, and the clicks to enter and back out of the specific episode page. If only they would add the continuous play feature for tv shows now...\n", "Q: Change SMS/iMessage display format Is there a way to display sent/received iMessages in a \"horizontal\" format rather than the current \"vertical\" left/right bubble format?\n\nA: In iOS, aside from using accessibility's large text features, there are no options to adjust the display of messages in the Messages app.\nOn OS X, all of Message's display options present new messages vertically – each new message appears below the previous one. There are three settings to choose from and only (the default) one displays them in a left/right format.\nTo change the way Messages displays messages, you have to 'secondary-click' (AKA control+click or right-click) in the blank space between messages. That brings up a contextual menu with only three options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Show as Balloons\n\n*Show as Boxes\n\n*Show as Compact\n\n\n\nYou can secondary-click in the Messages (main chat) window or in the sample transcript found in Messages > Preferences > Messages.\n", "Q: Does OS X have a builtin DHCPv6 client? Upon testing a within a standalone network with just a DHCPv6 server on it and several client computers with different operating systems, OS X 10.7.4 fails to automatically obtain an IPv6 address from the DHCPv6 server.\nSettings are set as the following for IPv6\nSystem Preferences > Network > Ethernet > Advanced... > \nConfigure IPv6: \"Automatically\"\nIs there a way to make OS X Lion work as a DHCPv6 client for a full IPv6 network with a DHCPv6 server?\nOr a way to add a 3rd party DHCPv6 client?\nAs of now each Macs has to be manually set to a static IPv6 address to get them on the network, which is not ideal.\n\nA: Actually yes it does have a DHCPv6 client. I have verified in 10.8.4 but the email thread referenced above talks about it working with Lion too.\nTo get it to work, you need to set the IPv6 configuration to \"automatic\" and then on your router, you also need to configure the routing announcements to indicate that hosts should use DHCP to obtain an address. I believe that's what they're referring to in those emails where they say they've got it working with Lion.\nRelevant extract from that email (since links may die eventually):\n\nQuick testing shows that when \"Automatic\" is used for the IPv6\n  setting, OS X will correctly look at the A, M, and O flags of an IPv6\n  RA and make use of DHCPv6 when instructed to.\n\nAs an example, on a Cisco ASA 5505 running software version 9.1, you'd need something like this:\ninterface Vlan1\n nameif inside\n security-level 100\n ipv6 address 2001:db8:1234:1::1/64\n ipv6 nd managed-config-flag\n ipv6 nd other-config-flag\n\nThe managed-config-flag is the \"m\" flag and the other-config-flag is the \"o\" flag from that email. You might or might not need both, depending on what you want to do.\nDon't forget that if your DHCP server is on another interface you'll also need something like:\nipv6 dhcprelay server 2001:db8:1234:2::2 dhcpinterfacename\nipv6 dhcprelay enable inside\n\nSo yes, DHCPv6 client, but needs a little help from routers on the network. I can't help feeling it's a bit of a mess, but it works.\nNote that you'll also get the EUI-64 address and the privacy extension address in addition to the DHCPv6 assigned address. I don't know how to turn them off I'm afraid. In particular, at the moment, I don't know how the OS decides which one to use for outbound connections, which could present some problems.\n\nA: Currently OS X does not have a DHCPv6 client built in.  Note that in OS X the IPv4 configuration gives you a choice of manual, DHCP, DHCP with manual DNS, BOOTP, or off. The IPv6 choices are manual, automatic, link-local, and off. The \"Automatic\" is not DHCP, it's autoconfig from a router.\nWith IPv6, there are multiple ways to get an address.  OS X doesn't use DHCPv6, it uses Autoconfiguration (routers provide the information).  Windows Vista & Windows 7 both use DHCPv6.  But typically routers doing autoconfiguration and DHCPv6 servers don't talk to each other, so collisions and confusion are possible.\nThis is one of the ugly parts of IPv6 that isn't widely communicated.  See http://arstechnica.com/business/2010/09/there-is-no-plan-b-why-the-ipv4-to-ipv6-transition-will-be-ugly/2/ for more info on this.\n\nA: Mac OS X has definitely DHCPv6 support. \nI currently use ISC-DHCPD in combination with radvd on my Raspberry Pi as home Router. \nIt is important that the M and the O Flag are set for route advertisement. That instructs to \"switch\" to DHCPv6. \nRadvd then advertises the default route (because, providing the route via DHCPv6 is currently not defined as a final standard). \nRemaining information is then provided via DHCPv6.\nI only have Apple clients in my office environment and it works like a charm. \nEven my iPad and iPhone get leases via DHCPv6. \nHere is an example configuration (I build it on raspbian, another OS with radvd and isc-dhcpd should also do it):\nradvd.conf: \ninterface wlan0\n{\n    AdvSendAdvert on;\n    AdvManagedFlag on;\n    AdvOtherConfigFlag on;\n\n    prefix 2001:1234:5678:9abc::/64\n    {\n        AdvOnLink on;\n                AdvAutonomous off;\n                AdvRouterAddr off;\n    };\n\nThe important flags O and M are set with these directives: \nAdvManagedFlag on;\nAdvOtherConfigFlag on;\n\ndhcpd6.conf: \nddns-update-style interim;    \nallow leasequery; \ndefault-lease-time 600;\n    max-lease-time 7200;    \n    authoritative;   \n    log-facility local7;\n\nsubnet6 2001:1234:5678:9abc::/64 {\n    range6 2001:1234:5678:9abc::10 2001:1234:5678:9abc::ff;\n    option dhcp6.name-servers 2001:4860:4860::8888, 2001:4860:4860::4444;\n    option dhcp6.domain-search \"example.com\";\n    option dhcp6.fqdn \"example.com\";\n\n    allow unknown-clients;\n}\n\n", "Q: Change DMG capacity When changing my mac HDD to an SSD I ran into the following problem:\nI've created a DMG image of my old HDD which has a capacity of 320GB. The DMG file remembered and saved the capacity in the image, and the problem is my SSD is only 120GB.. So the DMG can't be used if I can't decrease the capacity somehow.. \nEDIT: The total amount of used space on the image is only 15GB.. \nI've looked at hdiutil but I'm actually a ruby on rails developer so I don't really get this stuff.. \nIs their any way with this or another util to decrease the capacity of the DMG?\nThanks!\n\nA: There isn't a good way via GUI that I've seen to do this - you've got to use hdiutil as you asked. It's a quick command. To resize (change 25G to whatever you want),\nhdiutil resize -size 25G /PATH/TO/DISK/IMAGE.dmg\n\nAnother way to compress it is to clone your disk image into a sparsebundle, then compress the sparsebundle. This may or may not work, depending on how much compression takes place.\nFirst, create the disk image which mirrors your old disk image:\nhdiutil convert /location/of/disk.dmg -format UDSP -o /PATH/TO/NEWIMAGE.sparseimage\n\nThen, compact the resulting sparseimage:\nhdiutil compact /PATH/TO/NEWIMAGE.sparseimage\n\nIf these commands don't work then it's got something to do with your disk image and/or permissions.\nI have spent a lot of time playing with hdiutil and it's far from flawless - I've found & submitted bugs in Snow Leopard that still haven't been corrected in Mountain Lion, so if you do get a bit of odd behavior, don't be off-put!\n\nA: Try this one:\nhdiutil compact image.dmg\n\nBut as you can see in hdiutil manual:\nDepending on the location of files in the hosted filesystem, compact may or may not shrink the image.\n\n\nA: After cjc pointed out to ask the question at apple.stackexchange.com, I did. When asking the question I got to a related questing answered by someone saying to try Carbon Copy Cloner. \nCarbon Copy Cloner cloned the files via FireWire to my SSDisk no questioned asked, and everything is how it should be..\nHere's the question I'm referring to:\nRestore system from DMG (original source disk bigger than destination)\nFor those of you interested in resizing a disk image:\nMake your disk image read-write in Mac's Disk Utility:\nMount the disk, select it and click new disk image. Select read-write in the disk image structure drop down and click save. ( My OS is dutch, so these are my own translations ).\nUse hdiutil to resize the disk image:\nIn terminal: hdiutil resize -size 100G /location/of/disk.dmg. You can replace 100G by the size you want.\nOptional (didn't work for me), you can try to compact it:\nIn terminal: hdiutil convert /location/of/disk.dmg -format UDSP -o /location/of/NEW/disk.dmg. \nThis creates a sparse image.\nThen: hdiutil compact /location/of/SPARSE/disk.dmg.sparseimage\nThis will try to free up space on the disk image.. If it works I guess you may need to resize your DMG again to lower the capacity (I'm not sure)..\n\nA: Tried all this to no avail; hdiutil wouldn't let me resize below a certain threshold (much lower than OP).\nSimple answer:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a new DMG file at the size you want.  \n\n*Copy all the files over from the old DMG\n\n*Close and reopen new DMG and verify it's all good\n\n*Trash/backup/archive the old DMG.\n\n", "Q: how do i uninstall an app in mountain lion? I'm trying to uninstall MAMP and MAMP pro from my mountain lion macbook and don't know how i should do that.

Mount that disk image and you should see the uninstaller. Go here for more information.\nFor the rest of your apps that don't have specific uninstallers, use AppZapper, which is a nice utility.

Also, though I can see my existing notes synced up there, I cannot edit them. Is this the default behaviour or a bug?\n\nA: icloud.com does not have a notes feature at this time. It is rumored that around the time that iOS 6 is released, icloud.com will be updated to include notes and reminders. Previews of these features might be available to you already, if you are an Apple registered developer and have updated your iOS device to an iOS 6 beta, by visiting beta.icloud.com\n\nA: As of September 13, 2012, iCloud.com has Notes and Reminders apps added, so you can directly access the iCloud-synced notes and reminders data on the web.\nIt's worth noting that you're required to have an iCloud email address for the notes syncing. If your notes are set to sync with another address (such as Gmail), the web app can't access them. I believe this is because the Notes syncing still uses IMAP behind the scenes (each note is just a mail message in an IMAP folder).\n", "Q: External USB drive connected to Airport Extreme doesn't show up in Airport Utility I have connected an external drive to my Airport Extreme, but it doesn't show up in Finder, and it doesn't show up in the list of drives when I connect to the Airport Utility.\nThe same drive worked previously, but I have since reformatted it. The drive works fine when connected directly to my Mac via USB cable.\nUpdate\nI don't recall how the drive was previously formatted, except that I had both a Mac and Windows partition, and the Airport Extreme recognised both of them. Now I've formatted it as a single partition, with format: Mac OS Extended (Case-sensitive, Journaled, Encrypted)\n\nA: I had the same problem with my Western Digital USB drive. I re-formatted it as Mac OS Extended (Journaled, not case-sensitive, not encrypted) and it worked.\n\nA: I would probably reformat the drive as journaled HFS+ but not Case Sensitive. Encryption is fine, but Case Sensitive is a pain in the arse, especially because the OS X is generally not case specific.\nYou plugged the USB drive into the AirPort Extreme, but did you use the AirPort Utility to configure everything to work together?\nThe rightmost tab/button is where you configure attached storage. You'll need to set the password security for either plain visibility when you useFinder to log into the AirPort Extreme, or if the hard drive will require its own password, independent of the device password.\nWhole the setup parameters are fairly straight-forward, I may have missed one or two checkboxes. I'm doing this from memory.\nGood luck!\n\nA: Given the same drive worked previously, I think the format is most likely to be the issue, as covered in other answers here.

Some drives spun up, and the power light on the drive lit up, but the drive didn't show up in the AirPort Utility.  I fixed this issue by providing power to the drive via a split USB cable and mains USB power supply.\n\n*For one particular drive, I found the controller board in the drive enclosure was incompatible with the AirPort Extreme.  The drive didn't show up in AirPort Utility.  When I moved the drive into a different enclosure, it all worked OK.\n\nA: I ran into the exact same issue with a 1 TB Western Digital disk. It turned out that the disk was encrypted using the WD security app. Once I turned this feature off, the drive showed up in Finder (via \"Export Extreme\" under the \"shared\" category).\n\nA: I had the same issue with an USB 3.0 drive. It was formatted with HFS+ and had external power, but still wouldn't work. The problem was that I used the USB 3.0 cable that came with the drive. When switching to an old USB 2.0 cable and rebooted the AirPort Extreme it finally showed up in AirPort Utility.\n\nA: I have the same issue with encrypted Toshiba external drive.

Our Thunderbird mail clients successfully pick up their IMAP settings for their accounts on (Mountain Lion) OS X Server automatically. They just supply their email addresses and Open Directory passwords at mail account setup and Thunderbird does the rest for the client user.  \nAt autoconfig.myexample.com we simply supply a small XML file containing IMAP and SMTP server names and which connection protocols are offered.   \nMac Mail does not use this convention though. So the question is: how does the Mac Mail client do autoconfigure - if at all?\nI see many discussion threads concerning Mac Mail \"autodetect\"ing MS Exchange account settings but none answering the question re Mac Mail to IMAP accounts on OS X Server.  \nIf Mac Mail can make it easy for Exchange users I assume that it can also make it easy to get their mail from OS X Server? But how?\n\nA: I did a little digging and found out a little of what OSX tries to do to auto-configure an email account.\nIn system preferences when adding a mail account, OSX makes a POST to https://mac-services.apple.com/iconfig/dconf the post parameters are:\ndomain: EMAIL_DOMAIN_THE_USER_ENTERED.com\nversion: 1\ncapabilities: MACOSX\n\nFor a service like gmail the following is returned:\n<domain>\n  <name>gmail.com</name>\n  <description>Gmail</description>\n  <service>\n    <hostname>imap.gmail.com</hostname>\n    <port>993</port>\n    <protocol>IMAP</protocol>\n    <ssl/>\n    <requires>MACOSX</requires>\n    <authentication>PLAIN</authentication>\n  </service>\n  <service>\n    <hostname>smtp.gmail.com</hostname>\n    <port>587</port>\n    <protocol>SMTP</protocol>\n    <ssl/>\n    <requires>MACOSX</requires>\n    <authentication>PLAIN</authentication>\n    <usernameIncludesDomain/>\n  </service>\n</domain>\n\nUnfortunately, for my domain I receive the following response:\n<domain>\n  <name>EMAIL_DOMAIN_THE_USER_ENTERED.com</name>\n  <unknown/>\n</domain>\n\nAs far as I can tell after an unknown response OSX gives up and requires a user to enter the details manually.

But, either way, if you're using OS X Mail Server, just have them add a new Internet Account (through ->System Preferences->Internet Accounts or Mail->Accounts, from the Mail.app client), scroll down to \"Add Other Account...\" and have them choose \"Add an OS X Server account\".  This will configure all services granted to the user on the OS X Server, such as Mail, Calendar, Contacts, etc.\nIf you were using a custom POP3 / IMAP server, autodiscover configuration would be difficult to get going with the Mail.app client.  But, being that you're using OS X Server accounts, you can directly specify that type of account when adding new Internet Accounts.\nAlso make sure to configure your autodiscover service locater record in DNS in the form of: _autodiscover._tcp\n", "Q: How do I use AirDrop from the Terminal?

It's not completely automatic since you still have to select your phone.\nopendrop doesn't work on the iPhone unfortunately.\nI've written a blog post about this\nAdd the following to your init.lua\n\nlocal hex_to_char = function(x)\n  return string.char(tonumber(x, 16))\nend\n\nlocal unescape = function(url)\n  return url:gsub(\"%%(%x%x)\", hex_to_char)\nend\n\n\nhs.urlevent.bind(\"airdrop\", function(eventName, params)\n    local file = unescape(params[\"f\"])\n    print(file)\n    local url = hs.sharing.fileURL(file)\n    local ad = hs.sharing.builtinSharingServices.sendViaAirDrop\n    local s = hs.sharing.newShare(ad)\n    s:shareItems({url})\nend)\n\nThis will construct an endpoint to the hammerspoon Custom URL that can receive filenames as input.\nThen you can create a script like this\n#! /usr/bin/bash\n\nrawurlencode() {\n  local string=\"${1}\"\n  local strlen=${#string}\n  local encoded=\"\"\n  local pos c o\n\n  for (( pos=0 ; pos<strlen ; pos++ )); do\n     c=${string:$pos:1}\n     case \"$c\" in\n        [-_.~a-zA-Z0-9] ) o=\"${c}\" ;;\n        * )               printf -v o '%%%02x' \"'$c\"\n     esac\n     encoded+=\"${o}\"\n  done\n  REPLY=\"${encoded}\" \n}\n\nrawurlencode \"$@\"\n\n/usr/bin/open -g \"hammerspoon://airdrop?f=${REPLY}\"\n\nThis will URL-encode the input and send it to the airdrop custom URL which we've registered with hammerspoon.\nSave this somewhere as airdrop file in your $PATH, chmod +x it (make executable), and then you can airdrop <myfile>\n\nA: No - the functionality is programmed into the core OS and lacks official hooks supplied by Apple via the command line.\n\nA: I created a CLI tool a few years ago that does what you want:\nhttps://github.com/vldmrkl/airdrop-cli\nHope this helps\n\nA: osascript -e 'tell application \"Finder\"\n    activate\n    tell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"R\" using {command down, shift down}\nend tell'\n\n\nA: You can also automatically set your AirDrop receiving setting to \"Everyone\", script based on None of the above's answer:\n#!/usr/bin/osascript\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    make new Finder window\n    activate\nend tell\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"Finder\"\n    keystroke \"R\" using {command down, shift down}\n    # open the \"Allow me to be discovered by\" dropdown\n    click button 1 of splitter group 1 of splitter group 1 of window 1\n    # select the 3rd option (Everyone)\n    click radio button 3 of pop over 1 of splitter group 1 of splitter group 1 of window 1\nend tell\n\n", "Q: How do I use the Logitech Webcam 9000 on my Macbook Pro? I have OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion installed on my Macbook Pro. I want to use my Logitech Quickcam Pro 9000 webcam with it, but Logitech does not include drivers for OS X.\nI need an camera that is not on the laptop.\nIs there third-party software I can use to make this work on my MacBook?\n\nA: I use the Logitech Pro 9000 webcam (which shows up as a Miscellaneous Device in System Profiler, see below) under Mac OS X 10.8.2.\n\nNo drivers are required. Simply plug the camera in, then launch a video-enabled application (such as Skype.) You should be able to select the camera as a video device within the app without further ado:\n\n\nA: I have a Logitech Webcam 9000. It's a very good 720p camera with an excellent microphone. Unfortunately, this camera is no longer working out of the box under El Capitan 10.11.5.\nThe video instructions above don't work for current Skype 7.44 or for Photo Booth 8.0.\nIt's possible to get the microphone working under 10.11.5 by following these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Audio Midi Setup from /Applications/Utilities/\n\n*Select the Unknown USB Audio Device by clicking on it in the left pane. This is the Logitech Webcam 9000, as recognized by OSX.\n\n*Click on Input on the Right Pane\n\n*In the format dropdown, select a different Hz from what is already selected.\n\n*Now in the Volume Tab right under the format dropdown, fiddle with the volume bar, decreasing it all the way and then increasing it to the max.\n\n\n\nAnd now your microphone should work again. Untreated sample recording attached from SoundStudio as quality demo (fragment from Loving and Beloved, Sir John Suckling).\nSince the camera part no longer works, I've mounted my Logitech Webcam 9000 on a mic stand to use for podcasts as a guest. If I decide to host, I'll have to make one of my fancier mikes work with OS X but this mic is a great start. Webcam makers do not often include microphones this good any more (the Webcam 9000 was pretty expensive in its day).\n\nA: I am running Catalina 10.15.6 on my MacBook pro, and the 9000 works right out of the box - no driver needed.  Granted, it did some pretty fancy stuff when it lived on my PC with the Logitech software, but for basic video conferencing (Skype,Zoom,Meets) it works just fine - audio and video.\n", "Q: Disable Stand By Mode on Retina MacBook Pro? I learned that the retina MacBook Pro has a Deep Sleep Mode that is initiated when left idle for a long time. This, however, causes my laptop to take about 3-5 seconds to wake up after it sleeps, such as opening the lid.\nCan I disable this Deep Sleep Mode?\nI would also like to know the advantages/disadvantages of disabling it. Does it really save that much power? I would rather have a faster wake up time than saving 1% of battery or something.\n\nA: To disable deep sleep, run the following command in Terminal:\nsudo pmset -a standby 0\n\nThis is a description of \"standby\" (deep sleep) from the pmset man page:\n standby causes kernel power management to automatically hibernate a\n machine after it has slept for a specified time period. This saves power\n while asleep. This setting defaults to ON for supported hardware. The\n setting standby will be visible in pmset -g if the feature is supported\n on this machine.\n\n standby only works if hibernation is turned on to hibernatemode 3 or 25.\n\n standbydelay specifies the delay, in seconds, before writing the hiberna-\n tion image to disk and powering off memory for Standby.\n\nBattery savings depend on how much time your Mac spends in standby. While in standby mode, your Mac consumes 0 power, it's as if it is shut down (note: not taking Power Nap into consideration).\nMy personal recommendation would be to set the \"standbydelay\" value to something bigger. 2 hours, for example. This means that if you open the lid back in less than 2 hours, your Mac would be in regular sleep and wake up instantly. If longer than 2 hours, your Mac would enter standby mode and consume no power, and waking up will take a bit longer.\nExample for 2 hours:\nsudo pmset -a standbydelay 7200\n\n", "Q: How can I turn off my Time Capsule's wireless router? I have a useful wireless network, and then my Time Capsule's wireless network, which overpowers the other network when the computer is next to it. I don't know if it's misconfigured, but the Time Capsule's wireless network lets me do Time Machine backups and nothing else.\nIs there a way to turn off the Time Capsule saying \"I am the network\" or configure my MacBook Pro (Lion) to ignore the router's network unless instructed to? Or how can I configure the Time Capsule, which is plugged in to a working wired network, to be a better router and forward traffic appropriately?\n\nA: Yes, using the Airport Utility you can turn off the router and WiFi functionality independently of each other.\nUnder the Wireless tab - Network Mode: select Off\nUnder the Network tab - Router Mode: select Off\nAt this point you can connect the Time Capsule to the wired network using the ports with a horizontal icon <-> or even use it to receive the internet and connect your router to the ethernet ports.

I have 2 different OS X partitions on my Mac. I use ReFit to boot them.\nBut since they're both the same OS, it shows the same icon for both of them, which isn't their disk icon that I can change.\nIs there a way to use a specific icon for each partition? Or is there an alternative to ReFit that will let me do this?\n\nA: I, too, am dual booting 2 OS X's (Mountain Lion and Yosemite). This is because Yosemite is too heavy, so it's there only as a safety net! \nIf you are double booting Yosemite or El Capitan with another prior OS X, copy the rEFInd folder to this older OS X. This is because of the scheme Yosemite and El Capitan use to boot, and having the rEFInd files inside these partitions will require special installation instructions. In my case as I said, I have Mountain Lion and Yosemite, so the rEFInd folder is at the root of the Mountain Lion partition (volume).\nBut in the other hand if you are booting Yosemite and El Capitan (without an older OS X version as 3rd boot) then you'll have to go to the rEFInd page and read how to install rEFInd in these OSs.\nThis is how it's done:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the latest rEFInd from http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/\nThe latest version (0.9.2) supports .png for icons, so no need to create .icns files.\n\n*Configure your icons and place them in the icons older. I have made a God fearing simplistic theme. If you use it may I suggest you keep the background as a reminder of to whom one day you will answer to! Download this theme (and the binaries). It's basically my rEFInd folder zipped.\n\n*Configure the refind.conf file to use manual boot stanzas. These are  hardcoded (in the config file, much like a grub file in linux) options so the name of the volume of your OS X cannot be changed without changing the configuration file. If you fail at this and change the volume name without updating the .conf file, that particular boot option will not be bootable anymore. But since you'll have two OS X's you can force Apple's bootmenu with Alt at the startup, boot the other volume and fix the .conf file. The proper basic necessary configuration is as follows:\nscanfor external,optical,hdbios,biosexternal,manual\n\nmenuentry \"Mountain Lion\" {\n    icon \\rEFInd\\icons\\ml.png\n    volume \"Mountain Lion\"\n    loader \\System\\Library\\CoreServices\\boot.efi\n    graphics on\n}\n\n\nmenuentry \"Yosemite\" {\n    icon \\rEFInd\\icons\\yoyo.png\n    volume \"Yosemite\"\n    loader \\System\\Library\\CoreServices\\boot.efi\n    graphics on\n}\n\nExplanation: In the scanfor line you'll have to remove the \"internal\" option so rEFInd will not scan for the partition (as they are defined with menuentry) or you will have 4 boot options, the two from the scan itself, and two from the hardcoded menuentry sections. Also still in scanfor you have to put the manual option so rEFInd will read the menuentry sections. \nAnd the menu entry can be explained with this example:\nmenuentry \"Name that Will Appear In The Boot Menu\" {\n    icon \\path\\to\\the\\icon.png\n    volume \"THIS IS THE EXACT NAME OF THE MAC VOLUME\"\n    loader \\System\\Library\\CoreServices\\boot.efi\n    graphics on\n}\n\nLeave the \"loader\" option as it is. Because that is the default path for OX S' boot.efi (on all recent versions).\nAnd finally the graphics on is to hide the rEFInd command like black screen when booting, so you get a nice graphical transition between the boot menu and the screen with the apple (Apple's boot screen).\nI thinks this should cover. The end result should be (the rEFInd.zip at the top has this theme already) something like the following\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Finally set the boot to be done using the non-yosemite/ElCapitan partition (or the partition where you copied the rEFInd folder to. To do this go to:  System Preferences > Startup Disk click the partition and press restart.\n\n\nIf things go horribly wrong and for some reason you cannot boot, try either Alt to choose a bootable partition (ie. Recovery)\n\nJust a final note, App Store uses Spotlight indexes to identify apps, so before you launch App Store to update apps that are present on both OS Xs, be sure to unmount the Volume with the OS X that is not running so the AppS tore app can find the right one to update.\n\nA: (Disclaimer: I haven't tried this personally.)\nhttp://refit.sourceforge.net/doc/c3s1_icons.html\nIf I'm understanding this page of the rEFIt documentation correctly, you should be able to take a 128x128 .icns image, name it \"boot.icns\", and plop it in /System/Library/CoreServices on the partition whose icon you wish to change.\n(rEFIt automatically searches for .icns images named the same way as the EFI loader file. On OSX, that file is /System/Library/CoreServices/boot.efi)\n", "Q: Are cheap cable remotes for the iPhone and iPad good for listening to podcasts I like to listen to podcasts while driving - but I can't use the iPhone's touch interface to play/pause podcasts because it requires looking at the iPhone long enough to cause an accident.\nI'm looking for a physical pause/play button I can operate by touch and I've found this product on eBay Cable Remote Music Control for Apple iPod Nano 6 Touch 3 Classic iPhone 4S 4 3GS\nI've had issues before with a car's built-in iPod control that would mark a podcast as completely played even if I listened only to a short part of it and that made that car's iPod control completely useless for me.\nDoes anyone here has experience with that iPhone remote and knows if it works well for podcasts?\nRecommendation for alternative products are also welcome, as long as the alternative is cheap\nif it makes any difference the iPhone is connected to the car's radio speakers with a cable connected to the phone's earphones jack.  \n\nA: I have the same issue, and here's the workaround I use:\nI create a playlist and add the podcasts I want to listen to that day. \nIt's a little time consuming but then I do not have to try and find the podcast on my ipod while driving. \n\nA: I bought one and after using it for 2 days I can say it works just fine.\nNote: every time you disconnect it and reconnect it to the iPhone it forget the volume (and starts on very low, impossible to hear volume level) and it does pick up some interference (probably from the phone) every one in a while - but it solves my problem and it's a very good buy for $5.50\n", "Q: Quarantine alert for Skim I'm on Mountain Lion.

Here, only the most important information is listed.\n\nApparently decrypting an external disk is very slow (or even paused) if you use a laptop which is running on batteries. So always make sure to plug it into mains power when performing this operation.\n\nA: The accepted answer does not seem to work for APFS volumes.  It seems that the only way here is to use fdesetup status. This fantastic blog offers a script which basically uses that command to determine the status. In the article it reads:\n\nIf encrypted, the following message is displayed:\nFileVault is On.\nIf not encrypted, the following message is displayed:\nFileVault is Off.\nIf encrypting, the following message is displayed:\nEncryption in progress: Percent complete = 27\nIf decrypting, the following message is displayed without quotes:\nDecryption in progress: Percent complete = 10\n\nThese are also the outputs of fdesetup status.\n\nA: Catalina works with:\nwhile : ; do printf \"$(date) - \" ; diskutil apfs list|grep Encryption ; sleep 300;done\n\nGiving 5-minute (300 second) interval updates...\nIf you use:\ndiskutil apfs list\n\nto find out which disk (in this case disk5) you can be more specific/efficient:\nwhile : ; do printf \"$(date) - \"; diskutil apfs list disk5|grep Encryption ; sleep 300;done\n\nThis gives the output as:\nTue Feb 16 21:51:25 AEDT 2021 -         Encryption Progress:       10.0% (Unlocked)\nTue Feb 16 21:56:25 AEDT 2021 -         Encryption Progress:       11.0% (Unlocked)\nTue Feb 16 22:01:26 AEDT 2021 -         Encryption Progress:       11.0% (Unlocked)\nTue Feb 16 22:06:26 AEDT 2021 -         Encryption Progress:       12.0% (Unlocked)\n\n\nA: An alternative to the timed status reports in other answers that use diskutil cs list or diskutil apfs list, you can also use fdesetup status.\nFor the currently booted volume:\nwhile true; do fdesetup status | grep 'Percent' ; sleep 30; done\nFor a mounted external drive:\nwhile true; do fdesetup status -device <disk identifier> | grep 'Percent' ; sleep 30; done\nwhere <disk identifier> is in a form like disk3s1 corresponding to your external disk's system or data volume as found in diskutil list.\n", "Q: Are Logic Pro 8 projects working in Logic Pro 9? I'm doing some software tests in my company and one question is wether old files can be opened in new programms. According to my google-fu it is possible to open Logic Pro 9 projects in LP 8, but is the opposite possible as well (open LP 8 projects in LP 9) - that's where my google-fu left me?\n\nA: Yes the session files are fully compatible both ways.\nOptions or plugins from PT9 that are not available in PT8 are automatically disabled (and vice versa).\nTrack routings are obviously not working if the originally used audio-interface is not available. You'd have to re-route.\n", "Q: if both data and wi-fi are enabled, will iPhone use both? I was using my iPhone with both data enabled, 3G enabled and inside my hose, where I was connected to wi-fi. I just saw that I exceeded my monthly limit and I was billed $10. So when data is enabled, will it always be used? I understand that 3G is only used for data, so I am not billed for it separately. right?\n\nA: If you just saw that you exceeded your data, it could've been many hours ago while you were not at home. AT&T says it could be delayed by 24 to 48 hours.\nIn my experience, the iPhone will only use data from one connection at a time, not both; Its choice is indicated by which adapter symbol is showing in the menu bar. When you see the Wi-Fi symbol, your iPhone is only using Wi-Fi for the internet.\nExample: When I'm connected to a really bad Wi-Fi network (if I am almost out of range or it lost its internet connection), and trying to load a page in Safari, my iPhone will struggle with loading the page for about 10 to 20 seconds. Then, the Wi-Fi symbol switches to the 3G symbol and the page loads using cellular data.\nThe only exceptions I know of are multimedia messages (MMS) that aren't iMessages and Visual Voicemail – both of these things will not come over Wi-Fi and can't be received with cellular data off. They are not using both, but they could use cellular while you're on Wi-Fi.\nLast bit of evidence and future-proofing: In iOS 6 Beta 4, Apple added an option for \"Wi-Fi Plus Cellular\". (MacRumors: iOS 6 Beta Adds 'Wi-Fi Plus Cellular' Option...)\nIt will help people who may be on a Wi-Fi network with little or no internet connection be able to get cellular data through to some apps. (Maybe I'm just on the Wi-Fi network for Airplay for example.) It allows you to choose (from their pre-set list) which apps can access cellular data while you're on Wi-Fi. Before iOS 6, this option was unavailable.\n\nA: No. When data is enabled, it will only be used when you are not connected to wifi (iOS was built to prefer wifi).\nYes. Your cellular company (i.e AT&T, Verizon, etc) doesn't know how much data you use over wifi, and they will not bill you for it (obviously, there is some cost for internet in your house, but that is separate). When you are actively using the phone on wifi, iOS 5 will not use any cellular data. \nEdit (thanks, Gerry):\nWhen the phone is locked, it may turn off wifi (in order to save battery), and use data for some background processes like push mail. Chances are those processes will use negligible amounts of data, but still note worthy.\nBe careful of doing large downloads when you aren't connected to wifi. Downloading apps (which can happen automatically in some cases), and streaming videos are two big resource hogs.\n\nA: The phone chooses cellular data over wifi. I was home in a wifi environment on day one of my phone. My phone ran up 17.5 GB choosing data with wifi available and not LTE symbol on phone. I was not connected to the cloud. I was not connected to Siri.\nYou have to turn off cellular data for every app you install and turn off cellular data period. The reason you do this is because you don't want all your apps using it it the moment you need to turn data on. For example if you use maps. Make sure you turn it off for itunes. Do not stream music. Make sure you do not use the cloud. Keep real versions on your songs on your device.\nI had the iPhone 4 since I upgraded to the 6. I never broke 3.5 GB in a month. I broke 17.5 GB in one day syncing my iPhone music library next to my wifi router while physically connected by a wire to my mac. The WiFi symbol was there all the time. That should not happen.\n\nA: In the UK an iPhone will definitely use mobile data BEFORE wifi if both are switched on and available, probably a sop to the mobile carrier - remember when these first arrived the MOs didn't even want people connecting via WIFI as they were making a stack of cash with their mobile data.. I learnt this the hard way..\n\nA: As far as I know, WhatsApp uses cellular data over WiFi, even if you are connected to both. If you are connected to WiFi only, then WhatsApp will connect using WiFi.\n", "Q: How to determine what apps are running on iPhone? If I double tap the home button I will get the recently used apps. \nI have an app which I must keep on but I don't want other apps to send any data in the background and increase my data usage and my billing amount.\nIf an app is currently running will it 100% be in that group?\n\nA: If an app is running, it will always be in the task switcher, but just because an app is in the switcher does not mean it is currently running. There really is no way to say if an app is running with 100% certainty other than to open it (with the exception of audio apps, which if they are playing audio, they are running). See Apple's page on multitasking.\n\nA: The general rule about background applications is that they get five seconds of background time. An application can, however, tell that it's performing an background process and that way extend the background time to about a maximum of ten minutes. This makes it possible for applications to start a download when it's active and continue it if put to background.\nTo this there are a couple of exceptions where applications wont get suspended when put into the background.\n\n\n*\n\n*Apps that play audio.\n\n*Apps that tracks location.\n\n*Apps that listen for VoIP calls.\n\n*Newsstand apps that downloads new content.\n\n*Apps that get continuous updates from an external accessory.\n\n\nThere are also all applications that you allowed to receive push notifications that use data. This together with the built in apps people already named. You can of cause choose to inactivate automatic mail fetch, turn off the iMessage functionality and disconnect from iCloud.\nMacworld have a nice article that explains this and the different states of applications.\nYou can also dive deep into the App States and Multitasking at iOS Developer Library.\n\nA: It depends from application to application. One such example is TuneIn Radio for iPhone it uses internet to stream radio even when the application is in background state. If you want only your application to use internet you can close other application which are in background state by holding on one of the application icons to trigger wiggle mode. Once they start wiggling you can remove unnecessary applications :)\nP.S : iPhone default applications such as Email client, iCloud service, iMessage also consume internet bandwidth. So make sure you disable all if you only want certain applications to consume bandwidth\n\nA: There are apps like WhatsApp which can receive updates (and therefore produce traffic on your data plan) even if you close them in the overview you mentioned.\nI don't think there is a way to block this behavior without disabling data usage completely. Your could change the settings on the most of these apps to just update manually, but there is no switch to do so with all or a range of apps at once.\n", "Q: Is it safe to delete \"~/Library/iTunes/Mobile Backups\"?

After updating a Pages/Numbers document in iOS, I can go back to the app's file browser to get the list of all of my docs in iCloud. At that moment, the document that I had just updated displays a progress bar with the message \"Uploading...\". If I exit the app, will the upload complete in the background every time? \nI am getting into this bad habit of waiting before closing my app \"just in case the upload needs to complete\". I believe that waiting is unnecessary, but I don't know yet how reliable iOS is when uploading to iCloud in the background. What has been your experience so far? Is uploading of iWork apps always completed in the background? What about Wi-Fi versus cellular? Any pointers will help. Thanks!\n\nA: I've just answered on a post about iOS background processes that can explain this for you.\nThe short answer of your specific question is: As the application is made by Apple I expect them to use the background upload so you can close it.\n", "Q: imagent constantly sucking network bandwidth, won't die Since installing Mountain Lion and configuring Messages, I've noticed a trickle of network activity that is basically constant.\nI installed Little Snitch and discovered that a process called \"imagent\" is connecting to my work Jabber server, pushing about 45Kb/s up and pulling about 75Kb/s down.

I'm using AirDisplay to allow me to use my iPad as an external monitor for about 10 hours a day. I have it plugged into my Mac the entire time (so the battery doesn't completely die).\nWill this negatively affect it's lifespan? I'm sort of expecting my iPad to last for 5 or 10 years at least if I treat it well (is that realistic?), but, will this cause it to burn out in the next year or two?\nWhat I'm specifically worried about is:\n\n\n*\n\n*The display could somehow stop working (would pixels burn out? Would it not be able to get as bright? What specifically bad will happen from over-using the display?)\n\n*The battery could go to crap (I'm worried I'll get to the point where I'd have to continually charge it and it wouldn't be able to hold any meaningful charge)\n\n\nA: With regard to your question about a realistic lifespan:\nI would define the life expectancy of any device as however long its user can use it for its intended purpose. Which will cease to be the case when something physically breaks or when functionality is phased out (e.g. AirDisplay functionality is removed in a future update). It is impossible to predict if and when either of these things will happen to your iPad in the next few years. There are simply too many factors involved.\nIn my own experience, we have a 1st gen iPad (bought end of 2010) in the office that is on 24/7 (no screen timeout) as an interactive wall calendar and it is still going strong. On the other hand, one of my coworkers bought a 3rd gen iPad a few months ago and it died after a few weeks of use (he apparently got a lemon). I hope you see my point: There are so many factors involved in determining the lifespan of a certain device that it is impossible to say what will happen to your iPad: Sometimes you get lucky, but there are no guarantees.\nWith regard to your other 2 questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*As far as screen life is concerned, 'screen burn' only occurs on the old-style (CRT) monitors. Also, the backlight is provided by LEDs which are supposed to have a pretty long lifespan.\n\n*As far as battery life is concerned, there are some pointers at http://www.apple.com/batteries/ipad.html and at http://thehowto.wikidot.com/prolong-battery-lifespan-for-ipad on how to maximize your battery lifespan.\n\n\nI hope this helps.\n\nA: Unfortunately iPads haven't existed long enough for us to gauge their normal lifespan, but I've seen many ipads being used as \"displays\" in one way or another without adverse effects so I doubt this would cause any display malfunction. Theres a bar round the corner from our office that services the \"creative district\", they have several iPads inside glass domes with different pieces of art on them, they've been there over a year now running pretty much non stop with no issues.\nIn terms of the battery, Lithium Ion batteries nowadays are pretty good, as opposed to the NiCad batteries we used to use. Running them down and charging them up and all the other \"battery care\" tips are basically obsolete nowadays. I saw another post on here where someone had referred to this and some of the more obscure battery saving tips like freezing your batteries as \"snake oil\" and I'm inclined to agree.\n\nA: You definitely want to use the iPad's battery every few weeks, otherwise it will stop taking charge and fail prematurely. Rechargeable batteries are like a muscle, if you don't use it, it will waste away. \n", "Q: MacBook Pro connected to Dell monitor display issue I have rather a strange issue when I try to connect a dell monitor to MacBook Pro.\nFirstly the Dell monitor won't detect the signal from MacBook if I connect it immediately after the laptop is booted.

Take your Mac, the adapter, and the monitor so they can reproduce it. They'll probably try other monitors, other adapters, and other Macs to see what the issue might be. Hopefully you're under warranty and/or it's just a bad mini DisplayPort adapter, as that's the cheapest fix.\n", "Q: Internet Sharing won't show under Share settings on OS X Server 10.6.8 I need to use the Mac Mini Server running 10.6.8 as an access point for my team at the office.\nWhen I go under System Preferences>Sharing there's no Internet Sharing Option.\nWhat to do?\n\n\nA: The server OS doesn't offer the one-click Internet Sharing.

I formatted the iPad and lost my songs.\nIs it possible to re-download songs I bought via iPad?\n\nA: Yes the purchased tab in the app stores should allow you to re-download most if not all of your purchases. If you have previously hidden some purchases, you may need to access your Apple store account (Apple ID) to see the unfiltered list of past purchases.\nPlease see this link or this link on Apple's website for more details. You can edit your question or ask another if you find a problem on a specific step.\n", "Q: How can I disallow all network operations except for browser, mail? I am on a rather low monthly limit with my mobile phone plan. When travelling, I usually write mails and browse the web on my Macbook Air via iPhone Personal Hotspot.\nHowever, I do know several system services send and receive data \"in the background\" when a network connection is available — but I don’t want my Mac to download hundreds of MB of system updates or similar through my costly mobile data plan. \nIs there a way to temporarily limit data throughput to a set of applications, let’s say Mail.app and Chrome.app? CLI solutions preferred, but any help is greatly appreciated!\n\nA: You'll want a tool that lets you script the changes so you can roll them in and out or perhaps get fancy and script it based on the detected network connection interface.\nI would start by evaluating Little Snitch to see if it fits your needs or at least can give you a leg up on the processes that are connecting in case you care to just control them. I wouldn't be surprised if Little Snitch were controllable from the command line - but haven't used it lately to know for sure.\n\nA: I settled for Little Snitch:\n\nI created a \"deny any connection\" for any processes and added back the applications I want to be able to use the network.\n", "Q: iPhone 3G dead and unresponsive to charger and buttons My wife synced her iPhone 3G and installed two new apps yesterday.  While my son was playing with one of the new apps in her company (ie no dropping or water) the phone went blackscreen.  Son says the rotating gear icon etc did not appear.  The app was a Disney game.\nThe phone does respond to 60 seconds of pressing of the home and on buttons together (ie hard shut down/restart) and attaching it to various Apple brand charges and computers never produces the Battery Charging screen.\nIs there anything to be done short of locating a repair shop?\n\nA: You could attempt to put the iPhone in DFU Mode, and see if you can restore from iTunes. But this is almost certainly a hardware problem, and will require a trip to an Apple Store or a service provider.\nTo try DFU mode (note that this does a complete wipe, you'll have to rely on whatever backups you made previously):\n\n\n*\n\n*Plug the phone into your computer.\n\n*Turn it off.\n\n*Hold the sleep/wake and home buttons for 10 seconds.\n\n*After 10 seconds, release the sleep/wake button, but keep holding the home button.\n\n\nIf this is successful, you should get an iTunes popup stating that it has detected an iPhone in recovery mode.

I upgraded to OS X Mountain Lion from Snow Leopard and all of a sudden my scrolls in the browser window (chrome, Firefox etc) have reversed. \nI need to scroll up to go down and vice-versa. Is there a way to change the direction ?\n\nA: You can change this in \"System Preferences\" -> \"Mouse\"\n\nThis change actually happened from Snow Leopard to Lion with the introduction of Natural Scrolling to match iOS scrolling behavior where the motion is expected to work on the content - not the scroll indicator - as the two move in opposite directions.\n\nA: You need to go to System Preferences icon on the Dock, then mouse in Hardware category, then scroll direction. The description could be different because I have it in Spanish that I am translating, but you need to un-check it anyway, it worked for me.\n\nA: In System Preferences, go to Mouse and on the Point & Click tab ensure Scroll direction: natural is disabled\n\n\nA: The system preference for scroll direction is all-or-nothing and applies to every input device uniformly.  With some things, this just doesn't make sense.  If you want fine-grained control of which input devices scroll in which way (for example, if you want touchpads to use the \"natural\" scrolling while having the scroll wheel use traditional scrolling), try ScrollReverser.\n", "Q: How can I log in again after downgrading a 1st-gen MacBook Air from Lion to Snow Leopard?

This method resets the OS so that it thinks that it's the first time it's been run. This will kick off the Create New User Account wizard when the OS is rebooted, which allows you to create a new account with Administrator rights.

Periodically, my MacBook Pro 17\" stops recognizing my headphones. No amount of unplugging and replugging seems to help. The sound settings never show headphones as an output device. How can I fix this? The only thing I can find elsewhere on the Internet are people saying, \"Reboot!\" This works, but is impractical and annoying.\n\nA: There seems to be a bug whereby if the headphones are plugged in when the MBP is put to sleep and are not present when it is rewakened, the headphones stop being recognized. The solution is to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unplug the headphones\n\n*Put the MBP back to sleep (close the lid; without an external display hooked up)\n\n*Plug the headphones back in\n\n*Wake the MBP by opening the lid. \n\n\nThis should fix the problem.\n\nA: This worked on Catalina 10.15.3\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Activity Monitor\n\n*Search for \"audio\" processes\n\n*Force kill coreaudiod process, it will be restarted, then the Helper processes appeared and the audio jack recovered without rebooting\n\n\n\n\nA: open system preferences and go into sound. under the output tab\nmake sure where it says \"use audio port for:\" is set to \"sound output\"\n\nA: Ok, looks like I fixed my issue by resetting PRAM.

On other Unixe,s I can use top and then hit K and type the process ID. \nHow can I do that in OS X?\nI can type kill [the_pid] on its own at the command line and that works. However, I was wondering if there was a way for it to happen while in the top program.\n\nA: # top\n\npress shift + s.

I've recently got hooked to listening to white noise at work because it helps me focus amidst all the noise. I use the brown noise generator from SimplyNoise for this. I was trying to measure if it was safe to actually listen to noise for around 6-7 hours a day.\nFor evaluating this, pretty much the only references I've found was that listening to noise at 64dB for 6-7 hours a day is considered \"safe\" which lead me down this road.\n\nA: Extracted form Apple's Store In-Ear Headphone's overview:\n\nTechnical Specifications\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Frequency response: 5Hz to 21kHz \n  \n*Impedance (at 100Hz): 23 ohms\n  \n*Sensitivity (at 100Hz): 109 dB SPL/mW \n  \n*Drivers: Custom two-way balanced armature (woofer and tweeter in each earpiece)\n  \n\nIf you are using the regular Earphones, although I couldn't find any official technical specs, it's dB output would be lower than the In-Ear's, something like 103 dB.\nAnd for the safe decibels, just remember that:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*A typical conversation occurs at 60 dB – not loud enough to cause    damage.\n  \n*A bulldozer that is idling (note that this is idling, not    actively bulldozing) is loud enough at 85 dB that it can cause permanent damage after only 1 work day (8 hours).\n  \n*When listening to a personal music system with stock earphones at    a maximum volume, the sound generated can reach a level of over    100\n  dBA, loud enough to begin causing permanent damage after just    15\n  minutes per day!\n  \n*A clap of thunder from a nearby storm (120 dB) or a gunshot (140-190    dB,    depending on weapon), can both cause immediate\n  damage.\n  \n\n", "Q: Can iOS receive email from two Apple ID but iMessages from only one of the two email addresses? I have an iPod Touch and an iPhone, both on separate Apple ID accounts. What would happen if I added the iPod Touch email to the \"receive at\" on my iPhone (in addition to the separate email already in place) and confirmed that email address? \nI would like to recieve messages for both email accounts on my iphone, but have my itouch only get the messages from one of those accounts.\nWould only my iPhone get both account's messages? I want two addresses sending messages to my iPhone and only one to my iPod touch.\n\nA: Based off of my tests, when you choose what email addresses you want to use to receive iMessages, this is set on a per device basis. It's true that each Apple ID will have the same verified email addresses wherever you look. But the checklist in each devices' iMessage settings allows you to choose which email addresses you want to receive messages on that device.\nSo if you added the one from your iPod Touch as an address to receive at on your iPhone, only one thing would change: you would begin receiving messages sent to that email address on your iPhone.\nAll this being said, I would recommend you use only one Apple ID for all of your iMessage needs. Changing it around at first will seem a little tricky but should pay off in the end. (Tap the 'Apple ID: ______' button in your iMessage settings and you can change it out without messing up anything else Apple ID-related on your device.)\n\nA: What you ask is quite doable.\nOn one device, add the account you wish to get Messages from in the messages settings. It will ask for the user name and password. If that device is a phone, you will have to register that email to be a receiver for iMessage in addition to the cellular phone number. If the device is an iPod touch or iPad you can only receive iMessages to an email address / Apple ID.\nNow for the email, go to the Mail, Contacts and Calendars settings and add both accounts.\nThere you go - email comes in on two accounts and messages come in on one. Repeat these steps as needed on your second, third and other iOS devices. When you have completed the registration, iMessages should propagate to all devices that are enabled for a particular addressee.\n\nThe only potential problem would be if you had an iPhone and tried to add an email to be a secondary receive address as well as the phone number and that email was already tied to another different cellular number. In that case, you would have to detach that email from that other number before attaching it to the new number.\n", "Q: Is there a way to disable \"Top Hits\" in the Safari 6 address bar? The Top Hits section of the suggested results list that appears when I type in the Safari address bar proposes sites that are way off base.\n\nIs there a way to remove Top Hits from the address bar's suggested results, or at least \"demote\" the Top Hits section so that it is not the default?\n\nA: The Top Hits section uses the top two sites from your history, so if there are certain sites you don't want showing up in Top Hits, just press option-command-2, and delete the offending sites. (I don't know how to remove it though.)\nEdit:\nAs noted in the comments below, the keyboard shortcut to access History is now Command-Y.\n\nA: The other two answers are very incorrect.  The Top Hits does not come from your history and changing the settings for providing suggestions has anything to do with the Top Hits.  \nThe Top Hits section pops up suggestions from websites that you have saved as a favorite.  I have not found a way to disable the Top Hits, but if there is a website that you do not want to pop up, you have to delete it from your favorites.\n\nA: If you only want to remove the suggested search phrases, you can check Preferences > Privacy > Prevent search engine from providing suggestions. After that, there is only one item between the top hits and other results.\n\n", "Q: MacBook Pro flashing question mark but I can't repair because hard disk not found in disk utility Today my MacBook showed up some wheel of death and I waited and waited and then after a long time (10 minutes) decide to force shutdown. \nOk, I know its not a good idea but I've done this before and then put in the installation disk and with Disk Utility I could easily repair the boot, if it's crashed.\nBut this time Disk Utility could not find my hard drive.\nI believe its not a physical issue, once started from a forced shutdown and no noises with the hard drive. But how can I repair my hard drive if even the software cannot find it?\n\n\nPs.: I have already opened my MacBook, disconnected the hard drive, and plugged it again. You know, just in case, but no effects.\n\nA: I'd say this is almost certainly a hardware issue. Likely something internal to the drive (if it sounds like it spins up normally, probably some part of the onboard electronics), the hard drive cable or the SATA controller on the logic board.\nI'd advise taking it in to an Apple store if you can (especially if it's under warranty), but if you want to try it yourself, the first thing to do is try a different drive, and see if that gets recognized. If it does, your drive is dead, if not, it's a problem with the logic board or the cable. You can get replacement parts from iFixit, but if it's the logic board, then you're better off getting a quote from Apple for a replacement.\n\nA: I will tell you guys that the problem is the hard disk cable. You need just to replace it and everything will be fine again.\n\nA: I had this problem too. Fortunately had an identical (working) macbook pro in the house. It was the HD cable. Note that the cable from my other macbook pro looked a little different, but the connectors were the same and it worked ok in the newer macbook pro unibody 13\".\n\nA: What I did was format my disk, \nThen it popped up with the questioned folder\nI was confused, and after hours of rebooting and holding alt/options and command R/P\nI just went to where it said install OS X again.\nVerified it with Apple again. (Press continue). \nAnd now I'm playin The waiting game for my computer to restart and hopefully get back to normal [Macbook Pro early 2015]\n\nA: I had the same issue. Went to Apple store and of course, they mentioned is the cable (apparently it was a QC problem), so it was free replacement and labour. However, later the y came back to me to say that apparent my hard drive had crashed (totally dead and not detectable), an issue that is uncommon. Leaving me no choice but to just get a new laptop since its not worth paying for a replacements on a 4 year old computer (also had to replace battery). Brought my hard drive for data recovery and the guy was shocked as well because it also haywired their system, pretty scary i think.

I have an iPhone with my own Apple ID and my daughter has an iPod Touch with her own Apple ID. Am I able to set iMessages syncing so I get my messages AND all of her messages sent to my iPhone, without having any of MY messages sent to her iPod Touch? (shes 8) \nWould I just add her apple id and password on my phone? Will I then get messages for both accounts? And would she still only  receive her messages like normal, but would NOT receive any of my messages?\nHow would I set that up on my iPhone so all the texting done by me with my contacts are sent from my iPhone, but so that I am also able to view and monitor all her iPod Touch messages?  What will happen if I add her Apple ID to my iPhone?\nWill that work?\n\nA: I understand you want to keep an eye out... but all messages?  and no privacy? ;-)\nThat said. \nWhat you could try is setting up a extra account (user) on your iMac/Macbook. Hookup her iCloud account there. You can swap between your own account and 'her' account on the fly. \nWhen you then open iMessage on the desktop i think (and expect) that you would find all copies of her iMessages. That is, Apple iMessages, true SMS are not delivered (only on the iPhone). But since she has a iPod Touch... i think you should be safe. Give it a try.\n\nA: \n\nAs you can see in the first screenshot, you can set a number of email addresses by which you can receive messages at on your phone. However, as the second screenshot shows, you can only have one Apple ID connected to a device at a time.\nYou might be thinking, \"Ok, can't I just add her Apple ID email address to my phone?\"\nThe answer is no. Any time you add an email address to your iMessage account, the email is verified with Apple. If you attempt to add an email address associated with another Apple ID, Apple will decline it and neither iPhone nor OS X will not allow you to add the email address.\nConclusion: Unfortunately, there is no way to do this with iPhone or OS X. You could do what was previously suggested and set up a secondary account on your Mac (if you have one) and link that account to her Apple ID and use Message there to view the exchanges, but to specifically answer your question, OS X does not accept more than one Apple ID for iMessage per user and iPhone does not accept more than one Apple ID for iMessage either.\n\nA: go to settings and add your daughters email address \n", "Q: How to get my lost mail and accounts back after kernel panic? Today while working my system suddenly had a kernel panic.\nI tried to restart in safe mode and the meter went to about 1/4 and no further (did this twice).

Is there any possible way to get my accounts and email back?\n\nA: Click on the Finder icon, then press shift-command-g. This will open up a dialog where you can type a direct path.\nNow type ~/Library/Mail/ and press return. You should be able to see a folder called something like 'V2', and possibly other folders with similarly cryptic names. Open them and look for your mail messages. If your mail messages are hidden anywhere on your computer, they will be somewhere in these folders. If they are not here, then I hope you still have access to the messages online, or have made a Time Machine backup of your computer, because they are gone from your mac.\nIf you have made a Time Machine backup, then keep the Finder window open and and go to the Time Machine menu and click 'Enter Time Machine'. You will be able to travel back in time through the folder looking for your messages.\nIf you still have the messages available online, then you should be able to setup your accounts again and re-download the messages. (If you are using IMAP, then the messages should all download automatically when the account is setup, but if you are using POP you may have to go online and change your POP download settings to allow all mail to be downloaded.\n\nA: This worked for me:\nI replaced the file: library/preferences/com.apple.mail.plist\nwith a backed up version which.

I'm a mac noob, and a terminal noob.\nI'm used to installing things in Windows, and now I'm trying to set up Eclipse with the Android SDK on Mac and I'm having some trouble.\nI downloaded Eclipse and stuck it in a folder I called Android, then downloaded the Android SDK and stuck it in that folder as well. The next step of these instructions says this:\n\nUpdate your PATH environment variable to know about the Android tools.\n  There are different ways of setting your default PATH variable. I use ~/.bash_login but ~/.bash_profile also works. The Android tools are in the tools directory of the Android SDK. So this is what I added to .bash_login:\n  export PATH=$PATH:/Android/android-sdk-mac_x86/tools\n\nI have absolutely no idea what any of that means. Can someone help to dumb it down a little for me? That instruction presupposes way too much Mac/unix knowledge on my part.\n\nA: The PATH environment variable is simply an order list of directories over which (typically) executables are searched for and run. In short, to get you through the setup you'll need to edit /Users/<username/.bash_profile to include\nexport PATH=$PATH:/Android/android-sdk-mac_x86/tools\n\nThis is the most painless way to do that. Note, this assumes that you have the same SDK install path. Modify the text to suit otherwise.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open up a Terminal window (don't cringe).

I upgraded from Lion to Mountain Lion and, when I started the Messages app for the first time, it imported the iCloud account, a Google Talk account and to old iChat accounts I used in the past.\nI removed all the unwanted accounts and only left the iCloud one, but the problem is that it is someway duplicated.\nTwo iCloud accounts appear, one active, with the right account set-up, and the other one in inactive, and I can't delete it.

I've seen other questions covering the topic of how to set the file limit on Leopard/Lion.\nFor example: \n\nHow to properly increase ulimit -n on Lion?\nToo Many Open Files\n\nBut after  reading through those I'm still not clear on how I would set the open file limit for my instance of emacs.  Can anyone explain that to me? \nIt seems to me that ulimit -n sets the limit for the current shell.  That won't work for emacs, because emacs is not a shell. Also, apparently launching emacs from the shell would allow the ulimit -n value for the shell to apply to emacs. But I would like to not invoke emacs from a  shell; I'd like to just click the pretty icon. \nAlso there are some other ways to modify the open file limit but I am not clear  on exactly where those limits apply. At least one of the limits applies to \"all open files on the operating system\" and for my purposes that is much too broad a brush. \nI want to know how to set the file limit for a specific app.  Chrome, Emacs, or whatever. In my particular case, I am interested in emacs but I guess it would be a generic solution. \nThanks.\n[I tried tagging this with ulimit but could not, because I am at 101 rep right now]\n\nA: Before\n\nEdit:\nsudo vi /etc/launchd.conf\n\nAppend:\nlimit maxproc   100000  200000\nlimit maxfiles  100000  200000\n\nReboot\n\n", "Q: Mountain Lion on Macbook Air Just got a MacBook Air, and it is running OSX 10.7.4.\nIs it possible to upgrade to 10.8 (Mountain Lion)? \nAre there any benefits to doing so? \nWhat is the process?\n\nA: Yes \n200 new features: http://www.apple.com/osx/\nYou download the OS via the App Store, which you'll find in your applications folder. If you bought your Mac recently you may be eligible for a free upgrade. Check here: http://www.apple.com/osx/uptodate/\n\nA: It depends on the model you have.

I just purchased the base model (i5/4gb ram) MacBook Pro 13' 2012 computer. The reason I purchased the base model is because I already had an SSD drive and 8GB of memory compatible with this computer.\nUnfortunately, Apple does not give the Mac OS X DVD any more, they load it as an image on the hard drive.\nSince I need to remove the existing hard drive and replace it with the new SSD drive, how will I load the Mac OS image?\n\nA: Any computer that shipped with Lion or Mountain Lion has Internet Recovery, which is a very limited installer that downloads the full OS from Apple and installs it. To get into the Recovery mode, just boot while holding down commandR, and it will prompt you for the rest.\nHowever you can also do a direct clone of your existing disk to your SSD, which will avoid having to download the installer (it's about 4 GB) or reinstall all your programs and data. You'll need an external enclosure to put one of the drives in. You can do this with the built-in Disk Utility tool, or a tool like SuperDuper (the free version of which suffices for this task).\n\nA: If you are happy to wait a long time, new macs can actually download the OS over the internet.

Now: if I download any app from the internet (and I'm talking about apps I've never run before) it just runs, Gatekeeper seems to be not working at all.\nDoes anybody know what's happening?\n\nA: As bogdansrc mentioned, Gatekeeper only applies to application bundles that have a com.apple.quarantine extended attribute. Some applications (like μTorrent) don't add them to the files they download, and some unarchiving programs (like unzip) don't add them to files after extracting archives.\nYou can list extended attributes with xattr -l.\nGatekeeper is also disabled if you have disabled LSQuarantine with for example defaults write com.apple.LaunchServices LSQuarantine -bool false.\n\nA: It should not run them. However, what browser are you using? Can you replicate this if you download the app with Safari?\nIn order for GateKeeper to work, the browser you downloaded the app with needs to set a \"internet downloaded\" flag on the file. This way, GateKeeper knows that you have downloaded the app from the Internet.\nP.S. This should give you an idea on how \"secure\" GateKeeper is.\n", "Q: Convert a number of zip file to rar? Any suggestion of how to convert tens of zip files to rar format?

When an application is not responding I force Quit and Restart it.\nBut, is there a way in which I can save my data before quitting? Is there anything I can do to confirm that the application is really dead?\n\nA: Unfortunately when an application is not responding, it is generally not possible to rescue any of the data. The exception to this would be applications that save a recovery file at regular intervals e.g. Microsoft Office suite of applications.\nYour options are either to wait and hope that the application responds or the Force Quit.\n\nA: It depends on why the application is \"Not Responding\".\nAn application in this state is not replying to UI events sent by the system.  So nothing you do in the UI is getting through, which limits your options.\nI know of three scenarios in which a \"Not Responding\" (aka \"hung\") application can be resurrected, with the possibility to recover your data.\n\n\n*\n\n*The most common cause of an application hang is heavy disk contention.  This usually resolves itself if you wait long enough, but it can take minutes in extreme situations.  Quitting all other applications, especially those using a lot of memory, can speed up this recovery.\n\n*Less common is an application which hangs because of a problem with a disk.  This is actually not so rare if you are accessing a network mounted disk, but it can also happen with any external hard-drive.  In the case of network disk, you can try to unmount it, or change your network location to disable networking as a way to forcibly unmount it.  In the case of a physical disk, try unplugging it (obviously as a last resort).  Once the disk device is forcibly removed from the system, the application may be able to resume operation... or it may crash.\n\n*Much more rare is an application which spawns a sub-process and then hangs because that process does something unexpected.  For example, I have seen Safari hang due to problems QuickTime and WebKit sub-processes.  Finding and killing the right sub-process may free up the main application.  But you need to be fairly comfortable with the terminal, the \"ps\" command, and tracking down parent process ids.\nFiguring out exactly why an application is hung involves a lot of poking around at the unix level to see what the process state is.  Tools like \"ps\", \"top\", and \"lsof\" can be helpful.  But hopefully the tips above can get you pointed in the right direction.\n\nA: You can quit a non-responding app via the Activity Monitor, which will also confirm that it is gone by not showing it in the list of active processes.\n\nA: Yes, we can prevent data loss.\nSelect Tools, Options, Check 'Save AutoRecover info every:' and provide the interval.

After upgrading to Mountain Lion, I noticed that I can't install ports via Macports. I get the following error: \nError: The installed version of Xcode (3.2.6) is too old to use on the installed OS version. Version 4.1 or later is recommended on Mac OS X 10.8.\n\nI have Xcode version 4.4.1 + command line tools, I tried upgrading ports, and selfupdate, but I still get the same error. \n\nA: Downloading a new version of MacPorts will be required as noted in Migration - MacPorts since you updated to a new version of OS X and additionally too a new version of Xcode.  The old MacPorts install is now longer compatible with the installed OS and development tools.\n\nMigrating a MacPorts install to a new major OS version or CPU architecture\nAn installation of MacPorts and the ports installed by it are only designed to work on a single OS release and a single CPU architecture. If you upgrade to a new OS version (e.g. from Leopard to Snow Leopard) or migrate to a new machine with a different type of CPU (e.g. PowerPC to Intel), you may get lucky and have your ports keep working, but in general, things will break. If you are only upgrading Xcode (e.g. 4.1 to 4.2 on Lion) but not the major OS version or CPU architecture, you do not need to reinstall ports as described below.\nReinstall Xcode and MacPorts\nAfter performing either of these types of system upgrades, you will first need to  install the base MacPorts system again, either from the appropriate disk image or from source. If you are upgrading from a prior version of Mac OS X, install the latest version of Xcode for your new OS. This will not be done for you automatically; Xcode is not updated by Software Update, so you must update it manually. For Lion, Xcode is available for free on the Mac App Store (after install you may also need to install \"Command Line Tools\": XCode->Preferences->Downloads; if upgrading from previous version of xcode you may also need to do 'sudo xcode-select -switch /Applications/Xcode.app',  see this SO article). For earlier OS versions, you will find the Xcode installer on the Mac OS X installation DVD or on the Apple Developer web site.\n\nSee Installing MacPorts for more information on how to get and install the latest version of MacPorts.\n\nA: I don't use Macports, but sounds like you maybe have some old bits of Xcode lying around—a /Developer folder, for example? What does running /usr/bin/xcode-select --print-path in a terminal tell you? If the output isn't /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer (i.e. Xcode 4.x), you can use xcode-select --switch to make it so. That might help, but if that's the problem you'll probably want to try and completely clean up your old Xcode installation sooner or later.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro Retina lag when switching workspaces I got a lag when I switch between workspaces (four fingers left/right).\nCan somebody confirm this?\nI assume this is the weak ivy bridge graphics.

It may be trying to use the slower integrated graphics over the dedicated GPU.\nAlso, you may experience lag when using a scaled resolution.

There seem to be two layouts for Swedish (not counting Sami) and I don't understand the difference.\n\n\nA: As far as I can tell the only difference is that @ and ™ has switched places on the two layouts.\n\nScreenshots from MacOS High Sierra (10.13.4)\n\nA: On Macintosh computers, the Swedish and Swedish Pro keyboards differ as regards the characters available using the ⇧ Shift or ⌥ Option keys. ⇧ Shift+§ (on the upper row) produces the ° sign, and ⇧ Shift+4 produces the € sign. The digit keys produce ©@£$∞§|[]≈ with ⌥ Option and ¡”¥¢‰¶{}≠ with ⌥ Option+⇧ Shift.\n\nA: With \"Swedish\" the @ sign wasn't available on alt-2, so I had to switch to \"Swedish Pro\" to get back the \"old\" behavior.\n", "Q: Guest account on Lion vs Mountain Lion When you enabled Find My Mac on Lion or ML, it creates a guest account for you.\nIn Lion clicking on the guest account would restart the computer into a Safari only mode.\nIn Mountain Lion the guest account is traditional account except the user's data is deleted when they log out.\nWhat was the point in the Lion guest account, I heard something to do with helping to locate the Mac if you lose it, but I don't understand how having a guest account enabled and not normally in use helps? If someone finds a Mac, and happens not to steal it, how would logging into the guest account help? It seems like this is a very small use case, and not really enough to warrant having the feature, so I'm sure I'm missing something?\nWhy is Mountain Lion's guest account enabled when you enable iCloud/Find My Mac? What is the connection between them?\nI can't see any reason to keep the guest account enabled on Mountain Lion?\n\nA: The Guest account is enabled in Lion and ML for the Find my Mac feature as it enables the location function for the Find My Mac feature to work. Without the guest account, the location feature will not turn on and therefore will not work. \nDisabling the Guest account will effectively disable usage of the Find My Mac feature. \n\nA: The purpose of the guest account is to trick thieves into using the computer and hooking up to an internet connection (WiFi or ethernet). Doing so allows the computer to check with iCloud's servers and perform any outstanding actions (such as remote locking, wiping, pinging, etc.) and transmit it's location. It IS NOT necessary for the Find My Mac function to work, although having the computer limited to a single password-protected account disallows the thief from connecting to the internet for the aforementioned actions to occur. \n\nA: See this Macworld article for a useful explanation of this behaviour.\n", "Q: How can I open a file in its default application from the command line in OS X?

I'm confused by the variety of methods for encrypting drives in Mountain Lion. There are at least four methods,\n\n\n*\n\n*FileVault in System Preferences;\n\n*Finder's \"Encrypt...\" command;\n\n*Disk Utility's \"Erase\" command, specifying an \"Encrypted\" format; and\n\n*Disk Utility's \"New Image\" command, specifying an \"Encrypted\" format;\n\n\nbut it's not clear to me what the differences among them are.\nI understand that the first two allow for in-place encryption, but I'm not clear on the differences among products of these different methods. Specifically,\n\n\n*\n\n*Is the encryption the same for each?\n\n*Is (1) just a version of (2), applied to the boot volume?\n\n*Why does the password entry dialog for a volume created with (4) differ from the dialog for the others?\n\n*Why is the format for disk images created using (4) not \"encrypted\" (though it is at least a familiar Mac OS format), while mounted encrypted drives created with (3) are (though the format is an unfamiliar \"Logical Partition\")?\n\n\nA: Filevault's use the XTS-AES 128 encryption. As Finder's contextual menu encryptation option and the Erase with the Encrypted format use Filevault's system, the encryption is the same.\nDisk Utility's, in the other hand, when creating an new image, lets you choose between a 128 or 256 bits AES Encryption.\nThese two methods are, therefore, different. The latter just creates a folder which requires a password to be opened, while Filevault is a lot more complex.\nAnd for the Logical Partition, here is explained in detail. \n\nHow Does FileVault 2 Work?\n  Compared to the bare file system, or even FileVault 1, FileVault 2 seems like magic. How does it work? The first thing to know is that Apple has included a Logical Volume Manager (LVM) with OS X Lion. This is what FileVault 2 gets to ride on top of. ￼\nPhysical media still exists—we really can’t get away from that, as the data need to be stored somewhere. CoreStorage doesn’t really care what the media is, though: traditional spinning-plater drives, SSD, USB storage or even a disk image. Represented above in green, we have three volumes that reside on some physical disks. These three volumes are converted into CoreStorage volumes and imported into a Logical Volume Group (LVG). This sets up a “pool” of storage. Volumes can be added to and removed from the pool after creation. A LVG is represented with a UUID. This LVG is then brought into a Logical Volume Family (LVF). An LVF maintains properties about the volumes in a LVG and presents these Logical Volumes (LV) to the system. CoreStorage creates new device nodes for each LV. As shown in the visualization above, the LVs, in blue, have a device node (disk1, disk2, disk3). The ‘key’ icon associated with the LVF shows that encryption is one of the properties maintained about the LVG. This is the layer at which the encryption key resides.\nWhen you “Turn On FileVault…”, one of the steps converts your disk to a CoreStorage volume. Of course, when you “Turn On FileVault…”, only your boot disk is encrypted. Naturally, this fits Apple’s 99% case and is the right fit for the bulk of Mac users on the planet. That said, FileVault cannot and will not encrypt any other drives you may have attached to your system. That’s up to you.\n\n", "Q: Swap is growing fast, I think I know which app is causing it, how can I check? My swapfile has been growing fast lately, and I think I know which app is responsible, but I'm not sure.\nIs there a way for a non-developer to check something like that, or would you need a version of the app which has debugging enabled?\nn.b. I have Xcode/Developer tools installed. Running 10.8 on a MacBook Air.\n\nA: You don't need any special tools like xcode or a debugger to pick apart the virtual memory system in terms of allocation and summary statistics.\nI would start with sysdiagnose from the command line and perhaps pass in the PID or process name you care about. It samples that app, but you also have the PID and information on that suspect program with all the diagnostic information. Passing in the process ID will run vmmap, heap and (perhaps) other good diagnostics or added details on the program in question.\nYou'll want to focus on the zprint.txt and allmemory.txt first. The sysctl.txt has some vm information as well and fs_usage.txt shows file access, but generally not swapping.\nThere are unix manual pages for most of these tools as well as the sysdiagnose script is readable so you can see what it does or change it to collect.

Unfortunately, this also happens for users that are not system administrators (and so cannot run the App Store). How can I turn this off?\nNotification Center has preferences, where applications can be vetted, but App Store does not appear in this list.\n\nA: I recently discovered that you can dismiss individual notifications by clicking on the app store update notification, and swiping/dragging to the right.\nI do it about 20x a day because I don't have the time to restart my iMac every day for software updates.\n\nA: Disabling App Store Notification\nOpen your Applications folder and navigate to the App Store application. Right click on the application and select ‘Show Package Contents’. \nSelect the contents folder.\nWithin this folder you will see an application named ‘Info.plist’. \nCopy this to the desktop or another folder. \nOpen this file in Text Edit. \nThere are various options within this file. \nScroll down to the option which states.\nNSUserNotificationAlertStyle\n alert\nChange ‘alert’ to ‘none’.\nSave the file and copy it back to the location in which you found it. You will have to authenticate with your admin password to make the change since you are altering a protected system file.\nYou may need to restart the App Store application, or your Mac.\nCredit for this idea is found on imgur.\n\nA: You can now simply go to System Preferences > App Store, and turn off \"Automatically check for updates.\"\nNo messing with firewalls, and just works with App Store. So just remember to check every now and then manually to find out when you have updates!\n\nA: It's located in:\nSystem Preferences < Security and Privacy < Firewall < Firewall Options (you might have to activate this) < + < AppStore\nClick the arrow on the right for a drop down to select \"block all incoming connections\" and I keep it like this until I decide it's time to update everything.\n\nA: Uh....for some reason I can't respond to Buscar up there who is talking about the whole <key>NSUserNotificationAlertStyle</key> thing, in response to \"App Store Is Annoying\". \nIf you go to info.plist in the package contents, and it looks all XML-y, I think the trick to this is to find that line with NSUserNotificationAlertStyle inside the <key> tag, and then look below for the <string> tag, which should be sandwiching the word \"alert\". Just change \"alert\" to \"none\"... I think that'll work. Will restart & test out now.\n\nA: I just discovered the missing solution here:\nhttp://osxdaily.com/2012/11/15/stop-software-update-mac-os-x/\nYou can selectively disable notifications about specific software updates you don't care about (like useless App updates) by control-clicking the update inside the App Store to reveal a hidden \"Hide Update\" option.\nThis is best for those who want to keep Notification Center active for all its other uses (calendar alarms, etc.) and who also want to be notified about critical software updates. It should permanently mute notifications about certain software updates (until that software comes out with a new update).\n(Hopefully this also works for the case where non-admin users are getting update notifications they can't act on.)\nScreen-capture from OSxdaily article:\n\n\nA: The best solution I've found for this so far has been to ⌥+'click' the notifications menu icon in the top right and disable notifications. This resets every day though.\n\nA: I found that the preferences for the notification center are located in a sqlite database in ~/Library/Application Support/NotificationCenter/ The file is named with a GUID so I'm not sure if it's the same for every account, but it was the only file in the directory and has a .db extension. I used the following sql command\nupdate app_info set flags = 134 where bundleid = 'com.apple.appstore'\n\nI'm not 100% sure if it is working or not, but you can try it by running\nsqlite3 ~/Library/Application\\ Support/NotificationCenter/*.db \"update app_info set flags = 134 where bundleid = 'com.apple.appstore'\"\n\nin a terminal.\nMeaning of Flags\nAs suggested, here's what I was able to figure out about the flags value by modifying entries through System Preferences and observing the resulting change in flag value.\nThe flag value appears to be a bitmask of at least 16 bits as follows\n|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | M |   | A | b | S | B | H |\n\nThe meanings of the fields are\nM Set if the options have been modified from the default values\nA Set if alerts should be shown for the application\nb Set if banners should be shown for the application\nS Set if \"Play sound when receiving notifications\" is checked\nB Set if \"Badge app icon\" is checked\nH Set if \"Show in Notification Center\" is unchecked  \nI was not able to find any meaning for the remaining fields. The value 134 is the original value that the appstore entry had (which was 150) but with the alert bit cleared. I thought one of the extra bits set on the appstore entry was the one that caused it to be hidden from the preference pane, but even after clearing them it did not show up.\n\nA: Update: This doesn't work, the key appears to be ignored for some reason.\nI think you might be able to change the default behavior of App Store.app by changing the NSUserNotificationAlertStyle plist entry from alert to banner.  I just applied this change myself, but haven't been able to verify that it works because there haven't been any updates yet.\nHere's what I did:\nsudo nano /Applications/App\\ Store.app/Contents/Info.plist\n\nFind alert: ^w alert<\nreplace with banner and save ^x y\n\nA: If you wish to go one step further and disable Notification Center permanently, open the Terminal (located in Applications/Utilities), and type in the following command followed by the return key:\nsudo defaults write /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.notificationcenterui KeepAlive -bool false\nYou’ll be required to type in your administrator password to continue with the request to disable Notification Center. You can re-enable notification center by replacing “false” in the above statement with “true.”\nAfter doing that, type in the following command to quit the Notification Center:\nkillall NotificationCenter\nWhen you log out and back in to your Mac, the Notification Center icon in the menu bar will be missing.\nOR\nYou can simply hide the update in the Mac APP Store or wherever your notification is coming from.\nAcknowledgements : http://www.maclife.com/article/howtos/how_disable_notification_center_mountain_lion\n\nA: Try: System Preferences, App Store, and turn Automatic Updates off.

You can import photos or videos on an external drive to the Photos app, if you set up the file structure to emulate a USB-connected camera - I believe you need a folder in the root directory named DCIM with the photo and video files within named DCIM_1234.jpg (or .mp4, etc. as appropriate).\nYou may find this article useful: CNet: Secrets of the iPad Camera Connection Kit\n\nA: Hi there I have an older iPad , it's the iPad 3. \nI have a WHITE IPAD 1/2/3 USB ADAPTOR CONNECTION PORT KIT - Female end USB, bought from eBay.\nInto this I can plug in any USB device.\nMy Apple 2002 White pro keyboard does NOT WORK due to it requiring too much power.\nHowever, my cheap as chips TRUST ( WINDOWS ) Keyboard, bought from Morrisons works...

The white does not appear in top sites in safari 6.0 in Mountain Lion.  \n\nA: The Top Sites update indicator (blue curl with white star) used the RSS functionality (which if you remember was removed from Safari v6) to work - this is how it could tell if a website was updated.  This means that since Apple removed RSS for Safari v6, this also removed the Top Sites page site update indicator functionality.\nJust like the removal of RSS for v6, this missing Top Sites indicator functionality is a feature of v6.0.\n", "Q: How to see the results of Apple TV's network tests?

I also tried uninstalling xorg since I felt that should be installed via Xquartz (I could be wrong).  With only X uninstalled, Quartz launched and I got what I expected to get for a Xterm window.  With xorg uninstalled, I am getting no xwindow launch when called via the terminal, so I think I'm only halfway to an answer here.  [or leave xorg installed and remove X]  I will mention that my windows had no window handle, which was extremely frustrating, so I don't think this is completely solved yet.\n\nA: Ok- I seem to have fixed mine somehow.  I think it was a problem with all my initialization .files - watching the console, I was able to determine that there were lines from an older Fink install that were upsetting the start of the Xquartz server.  In particular it may have been the source /sw/bin/init.sh line that was the primary problem.  Be sure that all your rc files etc., are setup right and not missing things (check console to be sure) - .bash_profile, .bashrc, .xinitrc all had issues due to past installs for me.

I currently own a MacBook Air and I need to bring a backup of this current computer to US, so I can restore it on my new computer when I arrive.\nI currently do incremental backups to a Time Capsule, but bringing it is not an option. What would be the best strategy to back my data up to an external HD and restoring it later on this new MBP?\nI am OK if I need paid solutions too, but of course freebies are better.\nUpdate: I used the approach of adding an extra drive to Time Machine and it worked beautifully! I got my new MBP and it had Lion installed. When I used the Migration Agent, the user was successfully migrated but it wouldn't recognize my password. I had to reinstall from scratch, add a new user, login, update to Mountain Lion and finally run the Migration Agent again. Once that was done, everything worked.\n\nA: Have you considered using Time Machine to backup your computer to an external drive? If you change the Time Machine backup destination in System Preferences > Time Machine, it will stop backing up to your Time Capsule, and backup to your external. Then once it has completed a backup to the external, just point Time Machine back to the Time Capsule.\n\nCarbon Copy Cloner is one of the best applications for this. It is free and makes a complete bootable backup of your hard drive to an external. I've used Carbon Copy Cloner many times and I highly recommend it.\nSuperDuper! is another option. It allows you to create a fully bootable backup of your hard drive. The backup part is free, so you don't need to pay the $27.95 for the scheduling part. I've used SuperDuper! as well and it is a great application.\n", "Q: What steps I should take for data security and prevent misuse of my lost iPhone?

My one point if the phone can used for illegal activities it can be problem for me. Is it possible to track me by a wiped phone?\n\nA: Call your phone carrier and disable your sim card and report the phone stolen to the police. If law enforcement finds evidence that the phone SIM, serial number or IMEI were involved in illegal activity, a dated police report is something they may consider when investigating a crime. Of course, a bad person could report a phone stolen and still use it for crime, so you can't really get the carrier or Apple to erase their records but just do what you can if you lose a possession.\nYou won't be able to use \"Find My Phone\" as you've erased all the data on the phone.

You should save any photos you want to keep to your photo roll or iPhoto within the 30 days allocated. \nFor this and more information about iCloud check out the iCloud FAQ\n\nA: In November 2013, Apple removed the limits on photo storage and other than hourly, daily and monthly upload limits - you can store as many photos in the cloud as you care to.\nhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/a/108911/5472\nThe throttle points are currently:\n\n\n*\n\n*25,000 photos per month\n\n*10,000 photos per day\n\n*1,000 photos per hour\n\n\nA: From Apple.com - Photo Stream\n\niCloud manages your Photo Stream efficiently so you don’t run out of storage space on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch. If you have Photo Stream enabled on your iOS device, every single photo you take appears in a special Photo Stream album that holds your last 1000 photos. You can delete any photos you don’t want from the Photo Stream.1 To touch up a photo or keep a favorite shot permanently, simply save it to your Camera Roll. iCloud stores new photos for 30 days, so you have plenty of time to connect your iOS device to Wi-Fi and make sure you always have your most recent shots handy.\n\nSo your photos will get deleted if you reach the 1000 photos limit or the 30 days limit. It's important to note that photos stored in iCloud by Photo Stream doesn't count towards your storage limit.\n", "Q: Messages AIM account regularly stops working I have set up iChat with different accounts: Facebook Jabber, Google Jabber, iCloud and an AIM account coming from MobileMe.\nMy AIM account regularly stops working where Messages will indefinitely get stuck at \"Connecting...\".

At about 1% I rebooted it, but instead of rebooting it presented me a nice empty battery pictogram (just one you may know from iOS devices). I pushed power-on button several times just to see the very nice pictogram again. I left the notebook off then and started looking for a charger. After a few seconds, the MacBook Pro powered itself (!) back on. Still on battery! I pressed Option and waited on boot screen until it turned off again - but this lasted for long minutes.\n\n\n*Having it recharged to 100% I used it on battery again. This time I didn't notice that it went down to 0% while I still had my system booted and many applications open. I glanced to notice a \"running on reserve battery power\" warning then the screen went blank. Pushing power-on button - no action. I simply put a charger in and went to sleep. In the morning another suprise: I open the lid and see that the system didn't actually shut off. It is up and all my applications are still running. So at 0% battery it simply went to some \"sleep\" mode.\nMy guessing is that either battery is somehow uncalibrated and provides more power than the system expects from it, or the MacBook Pro with ML is keeping some additional non-reported reserve of power below displayed 0%. Or am I wrong? It's a pity that the nice sleep indicator was removed from the chassis - without you never actually know what your system is doing right now.\n\nA: macbooks generally hibernate (save your ram's state to your hdd) when the battery is too low.\nto do that efficiently (without losing data) there's an internal threshold that keeps some energy for the system to save state.\nin general, you don't shut down (as in \"windows is shutting down\") your mac. you either let it go to sleep after some time or just close the lid (and trigger hibernation). you can even trigger hibernation from the apple menu.\n", "Q: For equal cost, why would you select the MacBook Air over the MacBook Pro?

What's the catch in this?  \nI was thinking of buying a MacBook for development purposes, and worried if there's any problem in the Pro version, because it comes with more features (like more storage).\nEdit: \nThanks for the answer guys, I bought a MacBook Pro a week ago and already loving it.\n\nA: The MacBook Air runs at a higher resolution (1440 x 900) vs the Pro (1280 x 800). \nFor development the higher resolution could be nice if you are only using the laptop screen, if you are running connected to an external screen, this doesn't really matter.\nHaving looked and worked on both (pre 2012 models), the Pro screen seems to be a better quality with better viewing angles and colours - this is subjective as Apple's website describe them as the same.\n\nA: The MacBook Air is much smaller and therefore lighter. Less space means smaller components and therefore either less power or more expensive parts.\nIf you're going to travel a lot with your MacBook buy a Air, if you don't and need power buy a Pro.\n\nA: MacBook Air\n\n\n*\n\n*Solid state storage (faster read/write)\n\n*Lighter frame\n\n*No optical drive (optional external superdrive available)\n\n\nMacBook Pro\n\n\n*\n\n*Superdrive optical bay\n\n*More storage for less money\n\n\nA: The primary cons for the MacBook Pro are:\n\n\n*\n\n*heavier and more bulky compared to the Air\n\n*noticeably slower HDD versus SSD at the same price point\n\n*only has a 1280x800 screen resolution\n\n\nNote: but is confirmed to be a better quality display than the one in the Air, with a more accurate color gamut.\nThings that sold me on the MacBook Pro over the 13\" MacBook Air: the MacBook Pro is more future-proof and upgradeable and offers more value for the money in my opinion. \n\n\n*\n\n*Primarily Upgradeable RAM, the Pro Comes with 4 GB and so does the MacBook Air, but the key point is that I can just order it with the 4 GB for the Pro, knowing that I will be able to upgrade to 8 GB or even 16 GB at market rate for RAM whenever I want to. I cannot do that with an Air, you either order the 4 GB and shorten the usable life of your computer or pay upfront to upgrade to at most 8 GB at a premium price (thats shoddy and I would like to avoid that).\n\n*Secondly the MacBook Pro as of Mid-2012 version still has a standard form factor drive bay where you can purchase and install 3rd party 2.5\" SATA Laptop Drives of your choice in SSD or standard hard disk drives. \nAnd then the bonus features in order of importance to me, all of which without the need for external dongles and adapters:\n\n\n*\n\n*Gigabit Ethernet \n\n*Firewire 800 port\n\n*SuperDrive (optical drive)\n\n*Standard Audio headphone jack that can do both output or input over analog or digital cables\n\n*Hasn't moved to the new MagSafe 2 adapter format\nSo the flexibility and value of the MacBook Pro sold me on it, its really sad to note that all MacBooks will probably be Airs (like the MacBook Pro Retina) soon enough and this value option will be nothing but a thing of the past, so enjoy it while it lasts.\n\nA: I've owned both and personally found the pro to be FAR FAR FAR superior to the air. \nAs stated in the other answers the air has the advantage of being a lot lighter and solid state drive is also reliable and faster. However, the air is essentially a netbook competitor. I found mine to be not up to the task for most of the things I wanted to do.\nAs a designer and web developer I quite often have illustrator, photoshop, dreamweaver and bridge all running at the same time as well as a web browser or two and and FTP program, the macbook air always struggled with even one or two of these applications and the fan would be running virtually constantly if I wanted to do more than surf the web.\nWith the macbook pro on the other hand, I have Transmit, Illustrator, Photoshop, inDesign, Dreamweaver, Bridge, TextMate, Microsoft Outlook, Telephone, Chrome and Safari all open as I write this post... and the fan hasn't even started.\n\nA: Also, although this isn't generally accepted by Apple users, MS Windows doesn't run well on the MacBook Air, whereas it does on the MacBook Pro. \nA small thing to keep in mind.\nEDIT: As stated below, this appears to be untrue for newer MacBook Air models, as from version 11 and up they are using Sandy Bridge, which I did not know about - since i've never put my hands on one of the newer models. In short; this makes my original point moot.\n\nA: At the price point you're talking about, the Air comes with an SSD drive, whereas the Pro comes with a 5400 rpm hard drive (and a slightly faster CPU). Depending on the type of development work you do, the SSD drive may give you a more noticeable advantage than the small CPU bump.\nFor what it's worth, I went with the Air, for the SSD and higher resolution (plus it looks awesome) - but I'll retire it from dev use next year when Retina displays are cheaper and in a smaller form factor.\nEdit - in the latest 2012 models, both the Air and the Pro have similar i5 processors and matching memory speed, so the differences in speed people are talking about aren't quite fair.\n\nA: If your requirement includes physical security, you might want to know that the Air doesn't come with Kensington lock. There are locks made for Air but they seem a bit hackish — eg: putting a metal in the gap between the screen & body, or covering the whole Air with plastic that is screwed to the body.\n", "Q: Apple keeps resetting my Apple ID password? For the last 4 weeks or so, I get the \"This apple ID has been disabled for security reason... bla bla bla\" notification at least two times per week. All my devices are up to date and have been updated to use the new password.\nThere are at least 5 people in my office that are experiencing the same problem. I have read the article @ http://support.apple.com/kb/TS2446 but it doesn't help me much.\nHow can I make them stop? I will run out of passwords very, very soon.\n\nA: It might be the case that someone is trying to gain access to your and your coworkers accounts by trying out random passwords. After a certain number of failed attempts, your account will be disabled to prevent bad guys from continuously trying out passwords.\nMy suggestion would be to try to find out why it is being reset by contacting Apple support. They can probably tell you the specific reasons for disabling the account as it will probably be logged by them.\nSorry to redirect you, but this is not something we can 'solve' without knowing the reason behind the resets :-)\n\nA: They have your email address and pasword. I would recommend to change email password and iTunes password in these situations.\n", "Q: Customizing iTerm. Creating a display profile with Pastel color I was trying to follow the instructions given on the page http://kpumuk.info/mac-os-x/customizing-iterm-creating-a-display-profile-with-pastel-colors/\nAfter running the final command when I reopen the iTerm i find that only the background has changed to black and the text to cream color, it doesn't apply variable colors like blue to folders, some red colors for other file types. Please tell me how can I do so. Is there any other thing I can do to have a beautiful programmer's terminal.\n\nA: I recommend Solarized if you're looking for a fully-realized lower contrast pastel(-ish) colour scheme. Setting files for iTerm are included in the package.\n\n\nA: You can easily customize the color scheme from iTerm's preference. You can manually pick each of the 8 ANSI colors, or choose or import a custom color scheme.\nDefining the colors does not automatically colorize all output though. For example to display the output of ls with colors you need to add the -G argument: ls -G.\nYou can also alias this to always display colorized output, by for example putting the following in ~/.bash_profile\nalias ls=\"ls -G\"\n\n", "Q: How to re-download Lion from Mountain Lion I'm currently running Mountain Lion, but I'd like to redownload Lion (to create a bootable install drive).\nHowever, when I click the download button in the App Store, I receive a message telling me my current OS X is newer and the download will not start.\n\nDoes anyone know a way to download Lion when already running Mountain Lion?\n\nA: Official Answer:\nUnfortunately, it is not possible to download OS X Lion 10.7 from a computer currently running OS X Mountain Lion 10.8 unless you want to do a little hacking see below for more on that. \nI would like to be proved wrong, but the results around the web such as Apple Support Communities - How do I download Lion if I'm running Mountain Lion? kind of confim you can no longer just download 10.7 from a Mac running 10.8.\n\n\n*\n\n*I Attempted to Download OS X Lion from a Mountain Lion Mac but no amount of option key tricks could get it to work.\n\n*The Lion re-download started immediately on a Mac running OS X Lion 10.7.4\nConfirming, you will need to download the \"OS X Lion\" Installer from a computer not running Mountain Lion. This limits downloading OS X Lion to a Mac running OS X Lion 10.7, or OS X Snow Leopard 10.6.6 or later.

In Apple's recent iOS Security paper here\nhttp://images.apple.com/ipad/business/docs/iOS_Security_May12.pdf\nThey speak about the Secure Boot Chain, my question is has iPhones/iPods/iPads always had this feature?\n\n\"Secure Boot Chain Each step of the boot-up process contains\n  components that are cryptographically  signed by Apple to ensure\n  integrity, and proceeds only after verifying the chain of  trust. This\n  includes the bootloaders, kernel, kernel extensions, and baseband\n  firmware\"\n\n\nA: The Secure Boot Chain is a succession of steps designed to check and verify the integrity of the iOS. As it ensures too that the iOS runs only on validated Apple device, I'd say that it has been like this since the beginning. \n", "Q: CentOS 6.x for CUDA development on a MBP Here is a short description of my situation - I need a portable machine for CUDA and iOS development, so any of the newer MacBook Pros with NVIDIA GPUs seemed like a no-brainer at first. However, the CUDA-requiring project already has a huge code base from a large number of contributors that is developed on CentOS 5.x/6.x. CentOS is also the only platform that is officially supported.\nI obviously need a Mac because of the iOS project, but is MBP the right machine for the CentOS+CUDA based one? Did anyone get this to work properly, or is buying two separate machines (MacBook Pro + a PC laptop) the only solution?\nP.S. I am mostly worried about the GPU-switching support between MacBook Pro's cards on Linux, so any first-hand experience from existing MBP owners is very welcome. \n\nA: I don't think you'll be able to do this. I tried RHEL and it locked up on load. Same results on Fedora 16. I did successfully install Fedora 17 but was unable to get dynamic video card switching to work. Nor was I able to get the Nvidia card to work. I believe you have to run dual X servers and map the second card to your DFP out based on other posts. Additionally, heat and power consumption are increased since it never powers off the NVidia card. I did a lot of playing with Bumblebee and switching configurations for the Nouveau driver since the Nvidia driver yields a black screen. However, it wasn't switching properly. I believe the best I ever had it working was to run on the Intel card with hardware acceleration using the Nouveau driver. I would not recommend it as a CUDA platform at this time. There is a reasonable amount of contrib energy focused in this direction though and I don't think it will be too long before it is working. The Linux kernel has had support related to this being implemented as well.\n\nA: I know this post is long time ago, but I want to share some information for someone visit this post later.\nI did install Ubuntu & Centos & Debian on a MBP(9.2). It seems the important point is the kernel version, not the distro itself. The newer the kernel, the better the performance/ compatibility to Apple's hardware. In my case, intel_pstate kernel module support better than older module(don't remember) for Ivy Bridge. Being on Debian jessie 3.13, work like a charm, just a little bit tweak.( a little). On Centos 2.6 and Ubuntu 3.2, it seems not right. Temperature, fan, keyboard, trackpad... Have to tweak them all. And kernel panic, hanging happen a lot. Not even mentioning on a MBP with dedicated graphics card.\n", "Q: Why do Twitter notifications in Notification Center open in Safari? Is it possible to load Twitter.app instead of opening Safari when clicking Twitter notifications in the Notification Center?\nThe current behaviour really annoys me because it keeps making me sign in and I don't want it to remember my credentials.\n\nA: Indeed, the Twitter notifications will always redirect you to the web application, even if you have a native Twitter client installed. In fact, Twitter notifications also work without Twitter.app as long as you have your Twitter account configured.\nThere currently is no way to change this behaviour.\n\nA: If you use Choosy, you can redirect twitter.com links from anywhere to the official Twitter app (which Choosy recognizes as a browser). It won't open the specific tweet you've clicked on, but it will at least open the client.\n", "Q: How to type this tilde ~ in Mac (I can only type ˜ Using Fn + N) on an Italian Mac? I've seen this answer, but on my Italian keyboard I've got < between Z and Left Shift instead of the ~. So, how can I type it? \n\nA: With the italian keyboard you can use  alt + 5\n\nA: Option ⌥ + 5\n\nYou can show the keyboard viewer from the input menu if it's enabled.\n\n\nA: It is left Alt + ^ which will give you tilda sign over Swedish Mac keyboard.\n\nA: Just change the language of your USA International Keyboard - PC for USA\n\nA: I struggled a lot about writing accents and special characters in macOS with an Italian keyboard. The most comfortable way to do them is to hold option + press a key.\nSpecifically, for tilde, as mention above is Option + 5 (try other keys also, you'll be used to it in a while).\nThere are other special combinations for accents which are:\n\n\n*\n\n*option + N and a letter for ñ\n\n*option + U and a letter for ü\n\n*option + 8 and a letter for ú\n\n*option + 9 and a letter for ù\n\n*option + ì and a letter for ô\n\n\nA: Using an Italian Keyboard. \nThe option + N will Also give you a Small Tilde  ˜ as apposed to ~\n", "Q: \"Natively\" add emails to Mail by PHP pipe script I found this awesome tutorial on how to send emails on localhost that will open your Mail showing you the email that was sent from PHP, however this is slightly annoying getting Mail to open when an email is sent - I have some tasks that run in the background which sends an email for development reasons for my site so I can test the emails.\nI want to be able to not get annoyed by getting popped up with emails, instead I would like it to pipe it to Mail and show in my inbox when I click \"Get new messages\" so I can look into the email whenever I want not at the instant when the email is sent.\nI've looked into where Mail stores their email ~/Library/Mail/V2, I was wondering if I could adjust the script to add the email there, but it looks quite complication so I don't want to risk having any confusion or corruption happening.\nIs there any possibility to store the mails without any problems so Mail can add it to my inbox list via PHP?\nAnything?\n\nA: You can do what you ask, but it requires a Mailbox > Rebuild operation. That asks Mail to scan the ~/Library/Mail directory you found and rebuild its email header database from the files it finds there. I doubt you'd find that acceptable.\nI'm afraid Gerry's comment above is the right way to go about this: set up a test email account somewhere, use one of the many PHP-to-SMTP methods you can find online, and point Apple Mail at that email account.\nPerhaps the simplest, most Apple-like way to achieve that end is with OS X Server. It gives you a configuration UI for the Postfix SMTP mail server built into OS X. Setup through the Server GUI is about as easy as you can hope for. You can create a private user account, and be assured that your test emails won't ever even leave the machine. As cheap as OS X Server is these days, it's pretty much a no-brainer.\nIf you absolutely have to do this for no cost, you can configure Postfix by hand. The configuration GUI you get with OS X Server is helpful, but not strictly necessary.\n", "Q: How can I upgrade Mac OS X for free on a recently bought rMBP? I've recently bought a rMBP. I've heard I could ask for an OS update for free. Im not sure what that means as I'm new to the Mac. What should I do?\n\nA: Apple typically calls their upgrade program up to date.\nIn this case, you would go to this page below and follow the instructions based on the purchase date of your Mac.\nhttp://www.apple.com/osx/uptodate/\nYour seller can assist as well - but most people can find things themselves once they know where to look. You can then use one Apple ID on the Mac App store to redeem the Mountain Lion upgrade just like you may have to redeem the iLife (iPhoto, iMovie, GarageBand).\n\nA: Just go to the Up-to-Date Program Website and request one licence.\nYou will receive a key with which you can \"buy\" Moutain Lion in the App Store for free.\n\nA: There is one more detail to add to the link provided in bmike and Christian's answers. Between entering your request and receiving a key, someone must check that you are eligible.\n\nSomewhat annoyingly, this is the case even if you have purchased directly from Apple's online store (in which case confirming that you are eligible based on your order number and/or your serial number could be easily automated). \n", "Q: I have an Apple ID but it is not associated to App Store. I have tried to associate it, but it wont let me without a credit card. How to proceed? I have got guidance on how to create a new Apple ID that wont use a credit card, but could not find a way to associate my existing Apple ID (with my main email) to App Store without inserting a credit card. I have tried the OS X App Store software, the OS X iTunes software, and logging into the Apple Site.\n\nA: I believe this is the intended behavior on Mac OS X. On iOS, you can establish App Store use of an Apple ID without requiring payment information so you could borrow a friend's (or a store's) iOS device for a moment and just establish your account as valid for App Store use.\nFrom there, you could of course load a gift card by redeeming it or just log out and then try again. This has worked in the past for many corporate ID where we didn't want to have billing information on individual accounts.\nLastly, the Apple support might be able to guide you if things have changed with them being more protective of accounts to prevent fraud, false reviews in the App Store or whatever else motivates Apple to change policy around the online stores they run.\n\nA: There should be a payment type selector as \"None\" on your account setup screen. The only caveat is that the account needs to be created via iTunes in order for this payment option to show up.

I recently tarred up a directory to send to a remote linux system.  When I untarred it, there were ._ files tossed into the target directory.    \nI did a search and found articles of people being livid about this in 2003.  \nmacosx forum on ._ files\nWhat purpose does this serve on Mac OS X and can I tell it not to create these files?\nThe reason I ask is I am managing network shares where these files will land and am inclined to I set a cron job to periodically delete them. From my understanding this deletion will help since the files result from user-a setting a preference in a resource file, then user-b will be subjected to cross user contamination of preferences.\nAccording to the forum link, if I block their creation, MacOS will freak, but that information is quite stale. Can someone point me to an up to date summary of these files? Will deleting the files have bad consequences when files return to OS X?\n\nA: Before Mac OS X, the Mac OS used ‘forked’ files, which have two components: a data fork and a resource fork. The Mac OS Standard (HFS) and Mac OS Extended (HFS Plus) disk formats support forked files. When you move these types of files to other disk formats, the resource fork can be lost.\nWith Mac OS X, there is a mechanism called “AppleDouble” that allows the system to work with file systems that do not have a forked file feature, such as remote NFS, SMB, WebDAV directories, or local UFS volumes. AppleDouble does this by converting the file into two separate files. The first new file keeps the original name and contains the data fork of the original file. The second new file has the name of the original file prefixed by a “._ ” and contains the resource fork of the original file. If you see both files, the ._ file can be safely ignored. Sometimes when deleting a file, the ._ component will not be deleted. If this occurs you can safely delete the ._ file.\nEssentially, when you’re working on files located on a network share you end up with duplicates of the file with a “._” prefix.\nYou can run the following command to clean the files up.\nfind . -name '._*' -exec rm '{}' ';'\n\nYou could also make this into a launchctl or cron task.\n\nA: \n… can I tell it not to create these files?\n\nThe proposed cron job\nAs your file server serves multiple users, the short answer is: \n\n\n*\n\n*you should allow and not schedule removal of ._ files.\n\n\n\nFor a file service that is without support for things such as extended attributes: \nFile service\nIf you configure the server to prevent creation of ._ files: \n\n\n*\n\n*the server will be incompatible with Finder and other apps that are commonly used on OS X. \n\n\nIf you allow creation but schedule removal: \n\n\n*\n\n*corruption or dataloss may affect the native file. \n\n\nVisualise: scheduled deletion of a dot underbar file, whilst that file is present in relation to a copy in progress, or a save in progress. Visualise a rug, pulled from beneath the feet of an operation. It's difficult for me to say exactly what corruption or loss may occur (effects may vary, depending on the timing of the rug-pulling) but I have seen ill effects often enough to caution against scheduled removal of dot underbar files. \nRecommended reading\nRe: Dot files – a 2006 post by Matt Deatherage, formerly an engineer at Apple. This is highly recommended, for convenience I made annotations.\nMore obscurely, a table linked from the following question: With WebDAV provided by Microsoft SharePoint, how can users of OS X minimise risks of corruption and multiuser overwrites? – \"… some parts … may be generalised …\". Within that table are some of the workarounds to which people might resort when faced with a service that prevents dot underbar files. Without going into detail (only much could be squeezed into that table): test results were very thought-provoking. \nClients of the file service\nFor commonplace tasks such as copying or moving, ._ is required by Finder. That requirement is non-configurable. \nFor commonplace tasks such as saving, ._ is required by Microsoft Office Excel, PowerPoint and Word 2011 (Service Pack 2). That requirement is non-configurable. \nAnd so on …\nClient OS\nUse of a client computer running something other than OS X may leave an AppleDouble file dissociated from its corresponding native file. In some use cases the dissociation may be viewed as corruption. \nPerceived effects of corruption and of dissociation\nFrom test results in a variety of environments, I should say: \n\n\n*\n\n*when a native file is corrupt or lost, the effect is always severe\n\n*when dissociation occurs, the effect is usually harmless (without attributes, the native file remains usable). \n\n\n\ndot_clean\ndot_clean(1) OS X Manual Page\nWhen used with file systems such as HFS Plus and ZFS: \n\n\n*\n\n*dot_clean behaves as expected\n\n*mergers succeed without loss. \n\n\nBeware of running this command on file systems that are without support for information that may be stored in AppleDouble files.

It does not accept other options. \nVarious other programs, such as 1Password, also accept their own set of characters although this software applies to the first part, which is that it accepts whichever characters are available to you in iOS.\n", "Q: How to refresh random wallpapers on non-active spaces? I've got 5-6 desktops going in mission control and I have a random wallpapers on each that change every 30 minutes. I've become very annoyed with the fact that OS X doesn't change the desktop on a space I'm not using until I switch to that space. I'm getting tired of seeing fading wallpapers every time I switch to a desktop.\nThe only thing I've come up with is running killall Dock but that's pretty brutal and I don't want to run it all the time.\nIs there a way to get OS X to refresh all the desktops at once? Are there any defaults write tricks for this in Lion or Mountain Lion?\n\nA: I did find another answer which provides two applescripts. One answer gives an apple script to trigger the image change on the current desktop. Another example shows how to do this iterating all desktops.\nMaybe you could create a hybrid script mixing both (the solution that works and the solution for all desktops). Then, set your system preferences to random wallpapers changing every X seconds. This will work for the current desktop as you experience now, so maybe you could thrown in a cron which at X seconds - 5 calls this new applescript which forces a switch on all desktops?\n", "Q: Outlook 2011 and autoaccepting meetings So I’m about to ditch Outlook for Mac because I’m missing too many meetings.  I’m not sure if anyone is experience the same issues but when using Outlook on Windows, if I get a meeting invite sent to me it automatically gets added to my calendar as “tentative”.  When using Outlook for Mac, unless I physically accept, decline, or tentative the meeting it doesn’t show up.\nMy understanding is that this is a server side setting so I’m not sure what the issue is.  Even the iphone when pulling down mail marks me as tentative and syncs it back to the Exchange server.  Its almost like when the mail is pulled down into Outlook for Mac, the client side does something to the invite.  No idear.\nIts an issue when I get backed up on emails from being either out or in meetings all day and I miss an invite.\n\nA: From Microsoft Support:\n\nIf you have an exchange server, you can set that under the calendar\n  settings in the ECP for each individual user. But it will only accept\n  them tentative: \"Automatically place new meeting requests on my\n  calendar, marked Tentative\"\nIts under Options > Settings > Automatic Processing (Right).\nMake sure your url reads http://exchangeserver.com/ecp not\n  http://exchangeserver.com/owa\n\nYou can try something.  Use the OWA server, instead of the ECP server.

I want to get an image of this box before the OS installs just in case I have any issues.\n\nA: If you have access to another Mac and the necessary cable, you could boot your MacBook in Target Disk Mode (hold down the T key when powering up). Connect via Firewire or Thunderbolt to another Mac. The drive on the machine in Target Disk Mode can then be cloned.\n\nA: The Macbooks include what's called a \"Recovery Partition\". This partition allows you to troubleshoot and repair boot issues as well as do what's known as an \"Internet Recovery\", which will do a clean install of Mountain Lion as if it were clean out of the box. \nPlease see this link for more information: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4718\n", "Q: How to set reply-to address in Apple Mail I have two accounts set up in Apple Mail. The second account is for backup purposes and because at times the primary account is unavailable. When that happens, I send from the second account but would like the reply-to address to be that of the primary account. Is there a way to set things up this way in Apple Mail?\n\nA: If the View Reply-To Address option is checked, the Reply-To Address field will be blank in an email draft. It can then be populated as desired. \nHowever if then left unpopulated - or if the View Reply-To Address option is unchecked - on email send it will automatically be set. The email address used will be that of the default account as specified in Preferences.\n\n\nA: Simple!\nWith a message composition window open in Apple Mail make the following menu selection:\nView > Reply-To Address Field\nThat works for a message-by-message basis. If you want to apply all the time there's a hack you can do this via Terminal:\ndefaults write com.apple.mail UserHeaders '{\"Reply-To\" = \"reply-to@address\"; }'\n\nMore details can be found here.\n\nA: Just configure both email accounts with the same email address, but different server details and credentials.\nYou can set the e-mail address in Mail.app Preferences > Accounts for each account individually.\n\nA: If you go to settings, then mail then account, under IMAP information it says Email, click on the arrow on right, then choose add account and enter the email address of the account you want reply sent from and hit RETURNABLE it will add the account then you must click on that account to select it.

Our IT technician formatted my hard drive and re-installed the operating system and now my iPhone no longer syncs automatically.  Any suggestions?\n\nA: I'm guessing (since you do not state this in your question) that iTunes tells you something along the lines of \"This iPhone has not been synced with this computer before so now I have to erase everything on your phone.\" This is because after the reformat, your iPhone and computer no longer recognise each other because the computer is seen as a different computer.\nIf this is the case, I don't think you have any choice but to setup your phone anew. Fortunately, you can at least transfer your iPhone content to your computer before you do this by following the instructions at iTunes Store: Transferring purchases from your iOS device or iPod to a computer and/or Downloading past purchases from the App Store, iBookstore, and iTunes Store. I hope this answers your question, but like I implied earlier: some more information would be nice :-)\n", "Q: Time Tracking App with Alfred integration Is there a time tracking that integrates with Alfred, so you can start/stop time tracking using typed commands? \n\nA: I use Harvest to track time. It has a robust API. There is a command-line tool called hcl for interacting with Harvest time sheets.\nI haven't bought the Alfred Powerpack myself, but I presume that since the Powerpack includes an interface to develop your own shell scripts to extend Alfred that it would be fairly straightforward to start/stop new tasks:\n$ hcl start mytaskalias adding a new feature\n\n$ hcl stop\n\nYou've inspired me to look into this for improving my workflow. I currently use the Harvest application which has a very handy menu bar control, but being able to start/stop a timer quickly from Alfred sounds like a nice option…\n\nA: I just released a workflow with this functionality.\n\n\n*\n\n*View details on the Alfred forum: http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/3166-harvest-time-tracking/\n\n*Or view the project directly on Github: https://github.com/tinystride/alfred-harvest\n\nA: I’m not really sure if there’s a time tracking software that integrates with AlfredApp but take a look at this project management app that has an integration with some useful Google applications, this might help you find a good alternative. In addition, most time trackers have an easy option to simply start/stop the timer.

When dragging and dropping, the Library window highlights like it's going to accept (If you try to drag an unsupported file, the window doesn't highlight, and the thumbnail you're dragging flies back to the original folder).\nIf I rip a handful of movies and do an overnight encode session, in the morning some of the files can be added to the library, some can't. I have to re-do the ones that don't work.  Is there a way to found out what the problem is? An iTunes setting that will output what it doesn't like about certain files? A piece of software that can validate the files?  The resulting files play in VLC and Quicktime Player regardless of if they're added to my iTunes Library.\n\nA: Handbrake keeps individual logs for every encode. You can find them in ~/Library/Application Support/HandBrake/EncodeLogs.\nIf an encode fails, it should contain any relevant information on why it failed.\n\nA: Using Handbrake 0.9.9 (64 bit) on OS X 10.8.4 with iTunes 11.0.4, I encoded the same movie using the AppleTV 2 preset and the iPhone's.  It successfully encoded the movie, generating two .m4v files on my desktop. I couldn't, though, Add To Library nor drag and drop into the library. They would play fine in QuickTime. \nThe solution was dead simple, rename them to .mov files.\nVoilà, everything worked.\n", "Q: External display on MacBook Pro Retina (Mountain Lion) remains blank after screen timeout or waking up from sleep I have a retina MacBook Pro running Mountain Lion with a 23\" external display attached through the Thunderbolt port (DVI/Display Port adapter). I have the monitor configured as an extension to my internal display (arranged just above as it actually is placed on my desk). \nThe arrangement works very well. However, sometimes (~30-40% of the time) the external display remains blank if the MacBook Pro screens have timed out or the MacBook Pro has gone to sleep and I then wake the MacBook Pro (by pressing a key). The MacBook Pro still thinks that the external display is connected as the screen remains in extended mode and apps are also there (though invisible, if that's where they were placed before the screen/MacBook Pro went to sleep). If I disconnect/reconnect the display port (Thunderbolt), it does go to internal only, but I cannot get the external display back unless I restart the Mac. Any ideas?\n\nA: To get the display back without rebooting, I've had success doing this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disconnect the display\n\n*Wait until the display goes to sleep (set the timeout to 1 minute first)\n\n*Reconnect the display\n\n\nTo avoid the issue altogether, I've gotten into the habit of disconnecting the display before I leave the Mac.\n\nA: I've decided there's a strong correlation (though not a very high sigma) between a monitor being on Thunderbolt port #2, and having this problem occur.\nThunderbolt port 2 is the one closest to you when sitting in front of the keyboard (Route String 3).\nThis would seem to indicate a hardware issue, whether or not it can be fixed in firmware/software is unknown. Also unknown is whether this issue occurs on all port 2s, or whether there's a quality issue on these ports in general (maybe not all Retina MacBook Pros have this problem?).\nIt's certainly distressing, since I shelled out on a 3k piece of hardware I want to last 3 or 4 years and there's a strong likelihood I'm just going to have this problem forever.\n\nA: Open System Preferences/Energy Saver.  Set Computer Sleep to \"Never\" and select any time for the Display to sleep. \n", "Q: Can I delete my iPhoto themes folder (/Library/Application Support/iPhoto/Themes)?

I am familiar with so-called visual bells in terminals, but I've noticed a similar effect happening in any window in my OS X session - not just in Terminal.  I've researched this and there appears to be a setting in System Preferences -> Universal Access -> Hearing where you can enable a screen flash in place of an alert sound.  However, this is unchecked on my system.\nAny ideas how I can correct this?  I'm going to seize out soon if I can't figure out how to disable it...ugh.\n\nEDIT:  In response to the comments/questions below, I have confirmed that the plist also shows this setting disabled.

I'd expect that when I paste a new link in the new tweet window the link would be auto minified or I'd have the option to minify... but this doesn't happen.\nAm I doing something wrong or is this expected behaviour?\n\nA: It's the expected behavior. Links are shortened after sending a tweet and only count as 20 characters when composing a tweet.\nTwitter has shortened all links automatically with t.co since 2011. Many clients display t.co links with the target URLs, but you'll still be taken to a t.co URL first when opening a link.

I am writing a slide with Maslow's Hierarchy on it, and I want to build in from bottom to top.  How do I change the animation order or otherwise make it build in from the bottom of the pyramid, on the bottom of the page, to the top of the pyramid, on the top of the page.  \nI know how to do it in PowerPoint or use LibreOffice but the inspector won't let me break apart the build in ordering.\n\nA: If each section of the pyramid is a separate object then this shouldn't be too difficult to do via the inspector. All you need to do is select each object one at a time and add an entrance effect to it. Then in the animation tab of the inspector you can click on \"More Options\" (in the same place that the \"Close Drawer\" button is in the screenshot below)  and a drawer will slide out that allows you to change the sequence of animations (by dragging and dropping). Here's a screenshot of a simple sequence involving three objects. \n\nIt is also possible to control the animation of text boxes in a similar fashion (since they can be selected as individual objects). Additionally one can also set bulleted text to come in one bullet at a time with the following settings:\n\nSo instead of setting the \"Delivery\" occur \"All at Once,\" change it to \"By Paragraph.\"\n", "Q: No one- and two-finger tap in Better Touch Tool? I'm trying to get my three-finger tap to middle-click functionality in Mountain Lion since MiddleClick seems to have been broken in the upgrade. However, in order to let BTT react to tap gestures, \"Tap to click\" has to be unchecked in the Trackpad preferences panel.\nBut by doing this, you remove the ability to either one- or two-finger tap on content to interact with it.\nI'm 99.9% certain I checked everywhere in BTT's settings, but I cannot for the life of me figure out where to find the options for those (though single-finger gestures do allow for taps in quadrants, I don't like having to tap in specific places on the trackpad—it's more convenient as it's implemented in OS X).\nEdit: I'm open to alternative solutions, so long as it's not MagicPrefs. At least on my machine, that app seems to make the trackpad pretty wonky with the sensitivity.\n\n\nA: Seeing as my original question was brought up due to a lack of compatibility with Mountain Lion from MiddleClick, I think that this answer should suffice:\nAs of 19AUG12, MiddleClick has been updated to support Mountain Lion and is now available for download.\n", "Q: How to fix Safari print preview crash after upgrade to Mountain Lion?

Part of the project involves compiling a binary file with NASM (the one that is pre-included), then creating a disk image based on that binary. The important point comes from the fact that the binary is written to the first sector of the image to be bootable from other hardware (the binary is compiled with a FAT16 BPB), which I test with VirtualBox.\nUnfortunately, whenever I compile and try to mount the image in Mountain Lion, I get a dialog box that says, \"The following disk couldn't be opened: boot.img — no mountable filesystems\". I figured this was some oddity in my code, so I made a blank FAT16 disk image with Disk Utility, then compared my disk with the one created in a hex editor, then modified my code accordingly. Unfortunately, while it did manage to mount afterwards, my code no longer worked after making said changes.\nSo, knowing that I managed to successfully compile the code before (and hadn't touched it since recently), I popped into Time Machine and pulled my old working directory out. I tested the image in VirtualBox, and it works. However, I get the same mounting error. I found this very peculiar, so I copied the disk image to a physical drive, plugged it in to an old Ubuntu box, and it did, in fact, mount. I even sent the disk image to a friend (who is still running the latest version of Lion), and he was able to mount the disk image.\nTL;DR: Why does a FAT16 disk image I have properly mount in Lion, but not in Mountain Lion? I tried mounting by trying open boot.img, hdid boot.img, mount boot.img some_folder, and mount -t msdos boot.img some_folder, none of which worked. I've attached the disk image in question via Droplr.\n\nA: I eventually got the disk to mount whilst retaining compatibility with my bootloader. For anyone wondering, the compatibility conflict was in the FAT BPB (BIOS parameter block). Basically, the BPB has a field for specifying how many sectors compose a FAT cluster, where I manually supplied a value of 1. However, changing this to 4 fixed the issue. For more information on the BPB, you can see this reference page (you want to look at byte 13).\nFor anyone stumbling upon this answer randomly, this basically means that some older disks (such as floppy disks copied by dd) may not be able to be mounted by OS X Mountain Lion any longer. This is just a hypothesis based on observations of my own project, but hopefully this helps someone else running into this far-fetched issue.\n", "Q: Can I download Angry Birds as HTML5? I know that Angry Birds is available as an online HTML5 version at http://chrome.angrybirds.com/.\nI have an iPad, but I cannot install apps onto it, so I'd like to download the game so I can play it on my iPad (I think the iPad can render HTML5).\n\nA: The culprit here is actually your browser -- the device you are using is actually reported to the website by means of your browser's \"user agent\". The user agent tells the website what device and browser you are using. So, it makes sense that the only way to fool the Angry Birds website is to send a different user agent.\nI'm assuming you can't jailbreak your iPad and modify the browser, but there is a method to modify the Safari user string without jailbreaking. However, you do need to be able to sync the iPad with your computer. Here is a link with instructions. Aside from that, you might be able to find a web proxy to change your user agent, but I don't know of any that will do that.

I have AquaTerm and Terminal both.\nWhenever I do a search in the spotlight with query \"term\" it shows up AquaTerm before Terminal.

When I try to connect to a site, it's showing the authentication screen, but only allows me to enter the password. The username is defaulted to my Mac login user, but I can't change it (it's greyed out). Connecting using these credentials does not work, it always displays \"You do not have permission to connect\".\nFor a successful connection, I think I have to prefix my username with the name of our Windows domain, e.g. DOMAIN\\username. Unfortunately, Microsoft Document Connection does not allow me to do that.\nAny ideas on how I can change the username?\n\nA: I had this same problem, and found the fix.\nOur problem was that the company had migrated to a new domain, with all our usernames etc intact. So our old username (without a domain specified) was in the MDC Preferences, but it wouldn't let me change the username to domain\\username. And the old username couldn't be entered either.\nSo the solution was to enter the new domain in the Preferences.\nFor future reference, here's the procedure:\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit Microsoft Document Connection.app if it's running.\n\n*Go to a Finder window, pull down the Go menu, then \"Go to folder\" and paste in\n~/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/Office/14.0/Document Connection/\n\n*Edit the file Document Connection.xml with your favorite reliable text editor.\n\n*Find the line containing authkey, there should be only one.

I'm trying to put a link to Outlook Express in my dock but can't see how it's done. When I right-click on the application icon in a finder window, \"Make Alias\" is not one of the options available, so I can't make a shortcut and then move it down to the dock. If I drag the application icon itself down towards the dock it simply makes another copy of the entire application on the desktop. For some reason I can get a \"Make Alias\" option from this version (why would the right-click options be different depending on whether the same icon was in a finder window or on the desktop???). And I can then move the alias icon into the dock.

You should just be able to drag it.\nTry going to Terminal (/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app) and typing\nkillall Dock.\nThen you should be able to drag the application straight in.\n", "Q: Different remote SSH access password than user account password Is it possible to have a different password for SSH access than your user password.\nI would like to have a strong password for remote SSH/SFTP access, while having a password that is fast to type on my user account.\n\nA: You can only have one password for one and the same account, but for SSH and SFTP you can however further restrict access to make it more secure.\nOne thing you can and should do if your SSH server is available to the public is disable password authentication altogether:\nEdit /etc/sshd_config (requires root credentials) and uncomment the line:\n#PasswordAuthentication no\n\nNext uncomment and change the following directive to no.\n#ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes\n\nNow you can only authenticate with SSH keys and authenticating with passwords is disabled. To set up a public and private key I'd refer you to the following documentation.\nAdditionally you can also restrict which accounts can login over SSH and for example only allow one specific user (which can be different from your day-to-day account and can have a more secure password). You can do that right from the Sharing preference pane.\n\nA: If you're looking for strong security over SSH, I recommend using key authentication.  You have the option of assigning a password to a key.  You can be the judge of how strong the password for your key needs to be.  Remember, that a medium strength key password when the key yields stronger security than simple password authentication--assuming that you've properly secured your private key.\nThe basic process is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Generate a public / private key pair using ssh-keygen (see link above)\n\n*Copy / Append your public key to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on the remote host. \n\n\nTo copy your public key to the remote host painlessly, grab and run ssh-copy-id once you've generated your key pair. \n", "Q: Backing up iPhoto pictures and folders from the command-line I'd like to install a new OS X on a MacBook and I'd like to know what needs to be done to backup only the iPhoto pictures.  I definitely do not want to backup the entire /Users/Cedric/ directory.  All I need is my iPhoto pictures and all the iPhoto \"folders\".\nIdeally I'd like to do this over the network using ssh / scp.\n\nA: Your whole iPhoto library is stored in ~/Pictures/iPhoto Library.

To correct the error, set disksleep to a value greater than zero but less than (or equal to) sleep.  \nUse something like the following with your preferred disksleep time,\npmset -a disksleep 45\n\nto set disksleep to 45 minutes for all power situations.  You may want to adjust these times for when your MBPr is running on battery.  Set battery profiles with -b instead of -a.  \nI think you'll benefit greatly from the pmset man page. It's very clear and You'll probably discover something else that pertains to your needs there. \n", "Q: Restoring iPhone's state from a dd hard drive image This article, Recover Lost Data From Your iPhone, in its \"Method 1\" suggests a promising method to backup iPhone's entire state, that is iOS settings, apps, email settings, media files, that is everything to the least detail, using Unix/Linux dd utility that makes an image of the iPhone's hard drive. This allows treating iPhone backups akin to snapshots of a virtual machine or global restore points, which is very useful. However, despite of the article's title, it doesn't explain how to actually restore an iPhone's state from a file produced by dd utility.\nAny ideas how to restore from dd hard drive images? Or maybe suggestions about better methods to save/restore iPhone's entire state?\n\nA: You'll need to JailBreak the device before restoring. Then you'll need to go through the same process you took to create the image, except the values of the if and of arguments will need to be swapped.\nAdditional Reading\n\nA: The problem I see is that there is not exclusive access to the NAND disks. The restoration software is attempting to update a live file system that is also in use by the current ios os\n", "Q: \"All My Files\" option in Open/Save dialog get 100% CPU on Mountain Lion for a couple of minutes? \"All My Files\" option in Open/Save dialog get 100% CPU on Mountain Lion for a couple of minutes?\nHow to solve this?\nMainly this happens twice: once before drawing anything on screen and once again after displaying the files. \nAfter about two minutes you can use the dialog, but the problem reapers every time you click on All My Files.\nI do have a SSD+HDD setup on my machine. Console does not say anything interesting.\n\nA: This might be caused by the general slow spotlight problems with OS 10.7.5 and 10.8.2.  What version of Mountain Lion are you running?  How long has this been a problem?  If you're running 10.8.2 you might try this workaround.\n", "Q: Change Command Prompt - Variables are literal, and changes to .bashrc or .bash_profile not making a difference Trying to change my command prompt in OS X 10.8 / Mountain Lion. Changes to ~/.bashrc and ~/.bash_profile do not make any difference. Like:\nexport PS1=\"\\W \\$\"\n\nIt defaults to the host name (\"\\h\\%\"). Even if I try to set PS1 in the terminal, it changes but displays the variables literally, as below:\nws10% PS1=\"\\W \\$\"\n\\W $\n\n(with ws10 being the host name)\nMy ~/.bashrc file:\nexport PS1=\"\\W \\$ \"\n\nAny ideas? I keep getting lost when I cd up and down the directory structure! Thanks a lot. \n\nA: Typically on Mac OS X, only .bash_profile is executing when starting a new terminal. A common solution is to source one file into the other, for example in ~/.bashrc:\n[ -r ~/.bash_profile ] && source ~/.bash_profile\n\nApart from that, your example works perfectly fine for me when put in .bash_profile. If you still experience problems, maybe you are overlooking something else?\n\nA: I copied my .bashrc and .profile from an old mac and was seeing this issue.  It came down to the fact that .bashrc was checking for a specific terminal emulation name \"xterm-color\".  In Mountain Lion, xterm-color was renamed to xterm-16color and a new xterm-256color emulator was added:\ncheck to see if your .bashrc has this check:\ncase \"$TERM\" in\n    xterm-color) color_prompt=yes;;\nesac\n\nand add the new term names, so it looks like this:\ncase \"$TERM\" in\n    xterm-color)    color_prompt=yes;;\n    xterm-16color)  color_prompt=yes;;\n    xterm-256color) color_prompt=yes;;\nesac\n\n\nA: My .bashrc reads:\nPS1=\"\\[\\e[0;32m\\]\\u@monkey:\\w\\$ \\[\\e[0m\\]\" \n\ni.e. no 'export' in front of the PS1 setting.  Does it help?  I surely get the prompt I have specified.  In addition this line\nsource ~/.bashrc\n\nin .bash_profile should also help is you set the prompt in .bashrc.\n\nA: In .bash_profile add at the end following line:\n[ -r ~/.profile ] && source ~/.profile\n\nThat made it work again for me under Mountain Lion.\n", "Q: How to disable any and all eye-candy features on Mac OS X 10.6.8? I'm going to install Linux Mint virtual machine and work primarily through there.\nI want to shut off any and all eye candy on Mac to squeeze out every last bit of performance I can. Akin to \"Set for best performance\" setting on Windows 7.\n\nTurn off visual effects\nIf Windows is running slowly, you can speed it up by disabling some of\n  its visual effects. It comes down to appearance versus performance.\n  Would you rather have Windows run faster or look prettier? If your PC\n  is fast enough, you don't have to make this tradeoff, but if your\n  computer is just barely powerful enough for Windows 7, it can be\n  useful to scale back on the visual bells and whistles.\nYou can choose which visual effects to turn off, one by one, or you\n  can let Windows choose for you. There are 20 visual effects you can\n  control, such as the transparent glass look, the way menus open or\n  close, and whether shadows are displayed.\nTo adjust all visual effects for best performance:\nOpen Performance Information and Tools by clicking the Start button ,\n  and then clicking Control Panel. In the search box, type Performance\n  Information and Tools, and then, in the list of results, click\n  Performance Information and Tools.\nClick Adjust visual effects.

(For a less drastic option, select Let Windows choose\n  what’s best for my computer.)\n\nHow can I do something similar on Mac OS X 10.6.8?\n\nA: You can use applications such as Onyx or Tinkertool to minimize the amount of effects that are displayed on OS X. OS X does not have a built in function to disable graphics like Windows does.\n\nA: Here are some apps, some free and some paid, that can be used to disable or change the behavior of various features. All of these products provide a graphical user interface that (in most cases) works by issuing a Terminal command called defaults write to create custom preference files that enable or disable or provide parameters for features that are inaccessible via the Mac OS X user interface.\n\n\n*\n\n*MacPilot \n\n*TinkerTool \n\n*Lion Tweaks \n\n*Cocktail\n\n*Onyx\nIf you want to use the Terminal to create your own defaults write preferences, there have been a lot of posts about that here on Ask Different. The advantage of several of these utilities is that they provide you a list of what tweaks are possible, and also give you a convenient way of reversing the changes if you don't like the results. \n", "Q: Auto Brightness in Mountain Lion Ever since I've updated to Mountain Lion, the screen brightness keeps changing automatically.

My son, who's now an adult, has been using my iTunes account (I don't use iTunes) that I created for him many years ago and he's accrued a large legal iTunes library.  \nHe will be leaving home in the near future.\nThe problem is how can I transfer everything he's purchased into his own iTunes account? \nHe plans on creating his own iTunes account before leaving.\nIs it even possible to transfer these thousands of songs from my account to his?  \nNote : This is all Windows PC based.\n\nA: You can't really transfer content from one account to another. But what you can do is to change the Apple ID and all personal information for the one you currently have all purchased songs on.\nThere is a nice article at ehow.com\n\nA: Copy the files from your computer to his using an external hard drive. And authorise your account as an audible account on that computer. Any account can be audible on up to 5 computers. Just remember to de-authorise each computer as you update. Your son wouldn't have ownership of the music but it is the quickest way of transferring a large amount of music. He could add this music to his library and play it through any device.\n\nA: No, unfortunately, you can not change 'ownership' of the files to another account. You would have the same issue with a married couple that bought all the music on one account, but then got divorced. This happened with my dad and his ex-wife's account, and we contacted Apple to make sure.\nThe most 'legal' route would be to possibly convert this current account into his new account. As in, change the contact, billing, and email address to use his info. This way, his account just moves with him. If you ever wanted to make an account, you could create a new one.\nThe closest thing you could possibly do otherwise is when he has his second account set up, turn on Home Sharing on both machines. He could then add this music to his new library, and your account could authorize it. \nAnother option would be to possibly use iTunes Match. He could copy all of the files he purchased into his library, and turn on iTunes Match. Then delete those files locally, and re-download from iTunes in the Cloud. This would remove DRM on some files, so he could play them, and have them in his library. (This is the path my dad chose).\nThe legality of either of the last two methods though is questionable, since that's not really the design of the service. Although, this may be more of the 'right' thing to do than illegally download them. I am not a lawyer, so what I say in regards to that is only in observation or feeling, not official.\nIn the end, with DRM'd files, and many Terms of Use of digital files, the purchaser is the only one who owns the 'rights' to the files. While he may have purchased them on an account you owned, you are actually the owner, etc. iTunes does not let you transfer this ownership, but they do provide services like the two above to help families.\n\nA: There is one way (if he either has another laptop or is taking the one with your Apple ID). First off, if you're going to be using a different laptop you can create another Apple account on that laptop.\nNext log in and then log out. Now log in with your Apple ID and download all of your songs to the laptop (it may take a while since all of the music). The other way, if he will be taking the laptop that already has the Apple ID, you will already have all the music in that computer's library so just simply log out and log in with a new Apple ID you have created and you will have all the music this way still.\nI prefer the latter because with the former, sometimes there is a chance it will in a sense get locked but not locked out, just you can download anything with another Apple ID for 90 days but in this case I do not think that will happen. (I have done all this before). Hope this helps.\n\nA: I just had the same problem, bur when you select al of your music on your mac or pc, and then right-click on one of them. you can select make a version for AAC, if you do that, your mac / pc will copy the songs, but the account will not be linked anymore to the copied version!!!\n\nA: Once a purchased is made with one AppleID that content can be played only on 5 different devices. If you enable Home Sharing this only allows you to transfer iTunes content easily between users either on the same computer or other computers in the network, but the content has to be authorized to play on any additional computer/device even though you transferred the content via Home Sharing (note the HOME in \"Home Sharing\" :) So, if your son leaves your home and wants to take the music you purchased for him using your AppleID, he can use Home Sharing to get the music into his library, but we won't be able to play it on any device other than the ones you authorized to play content purchased with your AppleID. It seems to me that \"Music Match\" is the best way to handle this kind of re-ownership.\n\nA: This deserves a new answer, just to keep it up to date.\nThis is now possible using Family Sharing\n\nFamily Sharing makes it easy for up to six people in your family to share each other’s iTunes, iBooks, and App Store purchases without sharing accounts. Pay for family purchases with the same credit card and approve kids’ spending right from a parent’s device. And share photos, a family calendar, and more to help keep everyone connected.\nYou can use Family Sharing on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch with iOS 8, your Mac with OS X Yosemite and iTunes 12, or your PC with iCloud for Windows 4.0. To get started, one adult in your household—the family organizer—sets up Family Sharing, invites up to five additional family members, and agrees to pay for any iTunes, iBooks, and App Store purchases they initiate while part of the family group. Once family members join, the features of Family Sharing are set up on everyone’s devices automatically.\n\n\nA: Yes, as long as your connected to the same WiFi, you can use iCloud to enable 'Home Sharing'. Your son can create his own, separate iTunes account and once 'Home Sharing' is enabled you will be able to drag and drop all of the songs from one account to the other. I've done it many times with a few different accounts in the family. \n", "Q: What terminal command shows the type of display that I have on my MacBook Pro? What terminal command shows the type of display that I have on my MacBook Pro?

Apple TV stores a number of passwords (or some kind of credentials) needed to access services like Vimeo and YouTube, as well as the Apple IDs needed to access the iTunes Store (and the now defunct photo galleries).\nWhere are these passwords stored and how secure are they? Are they stored in a keychain like the ones used by OS X and iOS? If so, what are the \"settings\" for the keychain (expressed in terms of the corresponding settings on OS X)? Can anyone with access to the Apple TV hardware see the passwords it stores?\n\nA: The Apple TV (2nd and 3rd generations) runs iOS under the hood, so it almost certainly (hard to be 100% sure without doing some substantial hacking) uses the system keychain, just like iOS on an iPhone or iPad.\nI defer to someone with a more concrete knowledge of the iOS security layers, but my understanding is that like most other things on iOS, keychain access is sandboxed, so an app can only access the data that belongs to it. There are further security mechanisms in the keychain, but I don't know enough to speak about them with confidence. Based on the answers to this StackOverflow question, I think that it is possible to gain access to keychain data if you have physical access to the Apple TV, but it's not a trivial task.\n", "Q: Mac doesn't respond after sleep mode: how to Prevent this?

Specifically:\n\n\n*\n\n*Are all user accounts still present? \n\n*Are all keychains still present, or are they reset or cleared as part of the password creation process?\n\n*If the keychains are still present, does the (new) administrator have access to the contents of existing keychains.\n\n*Are any files (other than keychains) erased or reset as part of the process?\n\n\nI assume that FileVault protects against using this technique in an attack; would a firmware password confer any protection?\n\nA: If someone has your administrator account, everything on the machine is accessible to them. People in IT Security circles say \"Physical access = Total access\".\nKeychains can only be unlocked with the keychain password.  If an account password is changed/updated without being logged into the account AND having the relevant keychain unlocked, the keychain password doesn't change.\nMeaning, someone could get access to your account perhaps, but not your keychain, without the original password.  The account and keychain passwords fall out of sync with one another.\nFileVault protection similarly, will remain in place until unlocked using the correct password.  I don't believe having root access on the machine allows you to unlock the keychain or the file vault account without the relevant passwords.. that's the whole point.\nOf course, theoretically a hacker with godlike skills, patience, and knowledge could manually edit the relevant passwd files to be whatever he/she wanted it to be (if they had root access), but the probabilities of this happening is somewhere between zero and nil.\n\nA: If FileVault is enabled, booting into single user mode requires a password, so neither of the methods for resetting the password in single user mode work.\nAs others have mentioned, resetting the login password doesn't reset the password of the login keychain. I tried resetting the login password a few months ago. I could access most files normally, but not my account in Mail.app or auto-filled passwords in Safari. But I could access my Gmail account from Safari because I had set it to log in automatically.\nThe login password (but not the password of the login keychain) can also be reset with an Apple ID. There's a checkbox for allowing that when creating an account. I think it was checked by default. The option can be disabled later in the Users & Groups preference pane. If the option was enabled before you turned FileVault on, you cannot disable it without turning FileVault off and back on. See Michael Tsai - Blog - FileVault 2’s Apple ID Backdoor.\n\n1. Are all user accounts still present?\n\nYes. And all of their passwords can be changed separately, or from the Users & Groups preferences after logging in to (or creating) one adminstrator account.\n\n2. Are all keychains still present, or are they reset or cleared as part of the password creation process?\n\nThe keychains aren't removed, but the login keychain isn't unlocked automatically after the login password is reset.\n\n3. If the keychains are still present, does the (new) administrator have access to the contents of existing keychains.\n\nNot without knowing their passwords.\n\n4. Are any files (other than keychains) erased or reset as part of the process?\n\nI don't know, but you can access most files normally.\n\nA: I have gone through this recently with a friend's computer. Once the person has the Admin password, they can enable Root access. Then everything is available. I think that Root overrides even FileVault. (That's a question).\n", "Q: Front facing camera stopped working on the iPhone 4s Attempted to use the Camera App today and was presented with a closed shutter screen in the Camera app as pictured below. No tramma or anything happend to the phone no recent OS update, just not working out of the blue.\n\nIf I open the FaceBook app and go to the \"Take Picture\" section, the camera opens successfully, but when I attempt to switch to the front camer, it goes back and gets stuck at the shut shutter screen.\nWhat I have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Quitting the \"Camera\" app and re-opening it\n\n*Shutting down and restarting the iPhone.\n\n*The force shutdown method, hold power + home button until it turns off.\n\n*The Restore in iTunes\nStill the same rear camera works, and when attempting to switch to the front camera boom closed shutter screen.\nAny other ideas, it looks like I have a hardware problem...  \n\nA: This is a hardware problem. This comes up when the ribbon connector from the camera to the main circuit board comes loose or gets disconnected altogether. If you have the right tools and enough DIY skills to open up your iPhone, it's a very simple fix that should be fairly obvious to see. Otherwise, the Apple Store should be able to repair it for you (I would think free of charge, but who knows).\nIf you do want to take apart your iPhone and attempt the repair yourself, PowerBook Medic has some really nice instructions for taking apart all versions of iPhones from 3GS and above. They also sell replacement parts and will repair it for you as well if you want. (Disclaimer: I have no affiliation nor prior experience with this company, so use at your own risk.)\nThis is what the front camera of an iPhone 4 looks like:\n\nThat little white/silver part is what's probably come loose; just pushing down on it gently should allow it to snap right back in.\n\nA: This does indeed seem like a issue worth taking your iPhone to an Apple Store to repair, as you have performed all the recommended troubleshooting steps already.\n\nA: If you have this Issue and your still under warranty your wireless carrier will likely replace your phone with a refurbished one. \nGiven that solution I unfortunately will not know for sure what the actual problem was causing the front camera to stop working.\nAlthough, when I took the iPhone 4S to my local wireless providers store, it did not take them long to conclude that it was a hardware problem  and issue a replacement phone, given the fact that is was still under warranty. \nThe wireless providers customer representative  seemed to conclude given the above information, and after taking a quick look at the phone that it was a hardware failure of some kind.\n\nA: i cant find any ways to fix mine so I put it rice\n", "Q: How should I configure VirtualBox to be able to connect to the internet from the guest OS I am trying to move from VMware Fusion to VirtualBox since Fusion 3.0 is not working since I upgraded to Mountain Lion.

Is it possible to clear out Chrome's history from the command line? I know that this history is also cached online, ideally it would be good to do this from the command line as well.\n\nA: The Google Chrome history files live in ~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default. If you really, really want to delete browsing history from the command line (why?), I think removing the history files in this directory with a command line command/script would be the only way to go like this guy is doing. , as Google Chrome does not provide any ready-made commands or command switches for deleting history according to this list.\nHowever, please consider this excerpt from the README-file: \n\nGoogle Chrome settings and storage represent user-selected\n  preferences and information and MUST not be extracted, overwritten or\n  modified except through Google Chrome defined APIs.\n\nSo, do it at your own risk. I would experiment with deleting the history files of a test installation of Google Chrome and see what happens.\n\nA: To delete the files containing the all-time history (past 10 weeks) and the current (logged) history, do:\n\ncd ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Google/Chrome/Default\n\nthen\n\nrm History History-journal\n\n", "Q: Problem downloading 10.8.

However, the internet at his location is iffy at best, and we've tried for days to download with no success. Can I use my own saved copy to install on his system, or will we run into update issues?\n\nA: There should be no update issues.\n\nA: It will download the components required for that specific Mac, which doesn't take long and will ask for his AppleID.\nSo yes.\n\nA: No problems so long as he enters his apple id, on which you've also purchased ML, in at installation.\n", "Q: Do Solid State Drives need Power Management? Do they need sleep? Is there any positive (or negative) to checking the power management option \"Put hard disks to sleep\" when I only have a SSD drive installed?\nIs there any difference if I'm connected to another external drive, or Mac in Firewire taget mode?\n\nA: There is no advantage or effect on SSDs with the \"Put hard disk to sleep\".

After which, then go find\n  your Boot Camp drivers, and don't run the full setup, but instead\n  find the folder that specifically has the driver install packages in\n  them and install the ones that are along the lines of \"Apple\n  Multitouch Trackpad.\" After this, go to your Boot Camp options to make\n  sure that it now sees your Trackpad.   You should have full\n  functionality restored after this.\n\nDid get the answer from this forum post: How do I get my Macbook Pro trackpad working on Windows 8\n\nA: Got my Apple Macbook Multitouch Trackpad drivers to install on 64 bit Windows 8 RTM.\nUpgraded Windows 7 to Windows 8, keeping applications and files. As as result, Boot Camp 3.2 was already installed, but trackpad was not working.\nInstalling drivers manually using device manager from the Boot Camp 4 installation files failed. Windows compatibility mode failed. Hacking the BootCamp64.msi file using Orca to detect a different Windows version also failed.\nSo I went back to device manager which did not have any devices with problems, and I couldn't find the devices Apple Trackpad or Multitouch Trackpad. I tracked down two generic device entries called usb input device and figured out they were the trackpad installed with generic Microsoft drivers. When I tried to update these generic device drivers to the apple drivers, I got the error \"system cannot find the path specified\". Open up the system's SetupAPI log file and discovered the file not found error was caused by attempting to find driver files in DriverStore which did not exist:\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\DriverStore\\FileRepository\\applemtm64.inf_amd64_e9ad032101401c02 C:\\Windows\\System32\\DriverStore\\FileRepository\\applemtp64.inf_amd64_e01424b60295b8a0\nSo I created those two folders and copied all of the *mtp64 and *mtm64 files from boot camp 4 installation files to these respective folders, and also copy the WdfCoInstaller01005.dll file into both folders.\nAfter doing that I was able to use the device manager and install the apple trackpad drivers without any problems just by searching for the driver normally, and now my right click and two finger scrolling work great!\n\nA: I have just upgraded Win7 to Win8 RTM on my Macbook Air 2011 (core i7, Bootcamp 4.0). I tried to install Trackpad++ but it failed, the latest drivers from Apple failed to install. But the solution here http://maxcho.com/2012/08/windows-8-on-a-macbook-pro/ worked perfectly.\n\nA: I was only able to get the 32-bit install of Windows 8 RTM to work.  The one annoying driver that remained was the Light Sensor (the display was always too dim for my liking).  I didn't like only having 4GB RAM available, so I am switching back to Windows 7 (64 bit) until Apple gets the issue resolved.\nIf you don't need the track pad, you can always use the mouse.\n\nA: Try Refreshing the PC, then running the Boot Camp setup.exe file... instructions and the download (which is otherwise a hassle to find) are here: http://lift.co/compapps/apple/win8/\n", "Q: Can you use Catleap display with MacBook Pro?

Given that I've successfully installed VS2012 through Parallels on the same box, I can't help but think it's specific to an interaction with MBP and Windows 8 through Boot camp.\nWhat can I use to diagnose this problem and fix it? Is there a known issue with MBP and Windows 8 freezing up during installs?\nAs I've been using it more, it seems to freeze up after about 15-20 minutes of usage, without regard to what program is running.  I have to restart the Mac to get it to work again.\n\nA: I encountered a similar issue on my MBP when I installed the Windows 8 RTM (also a Core 2 Duo 13\" MBP). Reading around, I found the following discussion on the Apple forums that mentions a bcdedit fix, along with updating NVidia drivers. I followed the key \"fix\" steps on the second post at that link, and they have fixed the issue for me.\nTo summarise:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run a command prompt as administrator and enter the following command: bcdedit /set disabledynamictick yes\n\n*(This step is only relevant if your MBP has NVidia graphics instead of the Intel HD / ATI graphics on more recent models) Download the latest NVidia graphics drivers\nIf you're interested, this article theorises about the dynamic ticking issue, and why turning it off should fix the freezing.\n\nA: I've found that changing my power plan from Balanced to High Performance on my 2011 MacBook Air addresses the random freezing I'd see during install or normal use.\nAlso, during install of Windows 8 RTM, I also found that not having my power adapter plugged in allowed me to avoid freezing too.  So, the general rule of thumb is don't run Windows 8 RP or RTM with your power adapter plugged in with the Balanced power plan -- switch to High Performance if possible.\n\nA: As an extension to the answer by Bogie, I can confirm that (at least on a MacBook Air 2011) changing the power profile to either of:\n\n\n*\n\n*Power Saver\n\n*High Performance\n\n\nrather than using \"Balanced\" results in an entirely stable crash free laptop. \nNOTE: I'm making the, perhaps erroneous, assumption that the innards / firmware of a MacBook Air and MacBook Pro are sufficiently similar that this information is useful\n", "Q: How to turn off Mountain Lion's screensaver's password requirement? I have the current version Mountain Lion and set the Screensaver to 30 minutes, but since I am the only person that have access to this computer, I would like to turn the password off, but there seems to be no such method?\n\nA: Under System Preferences -> Security & Privacy there is an option to not require password to wake computer from sleep or screen saver.\n\n\nA: If you turn on FileVault then the checkbox disappears, so your only choice is how long it will take before you need to enter a password. I found this so irritating that I turned off FileVault altogether. Then the checkbox came back and I could get rid of that option.\nWhat is also strange here is that when you have FileVault on (and thus have no choice about having to enter a password) the maximum time is 1 hour. When you have it turned off, not only can you turn the password option off altogether, you also have a maximum grace time of 4 hours.\n", "Q: Help choose a better upgrade for my MacBook5,2 I recently got a 2009 macbook 5,2 as a gift from my uncle.

I love Byword.app and there's a very handy quick key (⇧-⌥-p) that, recently, started showing the uppercase Greek character pi (∏) instead. \nI'm not sure what I changed, but it's very frustrating, as I have never needed this character in the past, nor as easily.\nI have looked through all the Keyboard and Language preferences, keyboard and character viewers and so on, searched online, and I can not find a way to disable this. \nPlease, help me get this key combination back!\nThanks!\nUPDATE:\nI realized I had the Byword key-combo wrong, it's actually ⌘-⌥-p! (doh!) However, I'd still like to use shift-option combos for other things so I'll leave the question up.\n\nA: Is the ⌥⇧P shortcut a default in Byword? In OS X, shortcuts involving option without command or control as a modifier are for inserting special characters, like the symbol you're seeing inserted. I'm surprised that you're only seeing this functionality recently, as it's been there for many years - perhaps a recent Byword update changed something?\nTo my knowledge, there's no way of disabling these in System Preferences. You might be able to create a custom keyboard layout that would remove these, but I haven't tested that. I would suggest either setting a different shortcut for the functionality you want in System Prefs. The other (more awkward) way is to take advantage of the fact that the special character shortcuts only do anything in text entry fields. If you don't have a text entry field active, the shortcut should return to it's previous functionality.\n", "Q: SD card reader does not work after upgrading to Mountain Lion I have upgraded my Mac Book pro MB991 (13-inch, Mid 2009) to OS X Mountain Lion.

I always struggled with different kind of problems when I was an owner of other laptops like ASUS, HP, DELL, etc. I wanted   something more reliable.\nThe new MacBook Pro made me very happy until I noticed a stuck green pixel in the middle of the screen. It showed up 2 weeks after I received my MacBook. My problems start like before with other laptops...\nAnyway, I have an appointment at the nearest genius bar but my guess is that they will do nothing for one dead pixel.\nSo my question is : Is there any Apple worldwide policy for dead/stuck pixels ? What I should be aware of before my appointment to help me with the eventual MacBook replacement ?\nI tried to fix it with a different methods that you can find on Internet with no results.\nP.S. MacBook was purchased online and the appointment is in one of Paris genius bar.\n\nA: My guess is that it would be covered under AppleCare.  They may opt to either fix it or replace it.  But I'm not 100% certain.\n\nA: I've replaced an iPhone, and a MacBook with dead pixels, they they swapped both on the spot.\nIt doesn't matter where you buy them from, as long as they are under warranty they will fix/replace them for you.\nI would recommend that you either clone your drive with carbon copy cloner, or at least ensure you have an up to date time machine backup in case they are unable to swap the SSD over for you if they do offer to replace it on your visit.\n\nA: Mine had a single dead pixel after the 14 day period.  They replaced the screen no questions asked.  Had it leave it over night due them not having the parts.\n", "Q: Dragging objects with MacBook Pro touch area To drag a window on a Windows laptop I could put my mouse in the title bar area of the window, double tap and hold the second tap down (instead of letting off).  As long as I hold this down I can drag the window wherever I want and let off of the touch pad to release the 'hold' of whatever the mouse is over.\nI recently purchased a new MacBook Pro and tried to do the same thing.  It goes as planned, but after dragging the window and letting off of the trackpad the item I was dragging is still 'locked/held'. If I go to use the touch pad again, it keeps dragging the window until I tap it again. This is very annoying!\nHere's how the process goes:\nMac: \n\n\n*\n\n*Tap twice and hold the second tap\n\n*Drag the object selected anywhere you want \n\n*Remove finger from the touch pad\n\n*Tap the touch pad again (to release the object)\n\n\nIt should go like this (Windows):\n\n\n*\n\n*Tap twice and hold the second tap \n\n*Drag the object selected anywhere you want \n\n*Remove finger from the touch pad (DONE!)\n\n\nStep #4 kills me on the mac because I have used Windows machines for the last 15 years.  I just can't conform to the Mac drag!\nHow can I resolve this?\n\nA: On my MacBook Pro 15\", Mid 2012, there is a new option for dragging with three fingers in Mountain Lion. You place the pointer on the window title and use three fingers to move it around. As soon as you let go of the track pad it releases the window. To make the window stick to your pointer you tab twice with three fingers and tap again to release it.\nImportant is that activating three finger swipe gestures for Expose change to four finger swipes.\n", "Q: Why does Apple TV show screensaver when playing video? On occasion, our 3rd Gen ATV will display the screensaver while playing video. Once it starts doing this, the only way to get it to stop is by restarting.  I love my ATV, but this is quite a distraction.\nSo far, I've noticed that this occurs with both Hulu and Netflix.  The reports I've seen say that a reboot solved the issue with no follow-ups.  For me, that fix is temporary.  A few days later, the problem is back again.    \nHas anyone else had this problem? \n\nA: That is very unusual behavior and should not be happening. Try restoring the firmware of the ATV by plugging it into a computer, opening iTunes, and selecting Restore.\nNote you will have to re-enter all of your passwords into the ATV afterwards.\n", "Q: Are there known DTS or Dolby Digital encoded videos readily available on Apple TV for testing? I am trying to troubleshoot playback of discretely encoded 5.1 audio on Apple TV.  It is apparent that Apple TV can \"pass through\" Dolby Digital (aka AC-3).  \nAre there readily available video clips (i.e. no charge, and able to be reliably found through the Apple TV user interface) that are known to be encoded in either Dolby Digital or DTS?\n\nA: After about a week of use, I have not come across any free content on AppleTV that is 5.1 encoded.  My search was by no means exhaustive, but even the previews for blockbuster movies seem to only be plain old stereo.\nThe good news is that various movies on Netflix (e.g. a Big Year) and iTunes (e.g. The Hunger Games) are Dolby Digital encoded, so if you play them on Apple TV, discrete audio channels are played back if your audio equipment is capable.\nEdit:\nOther notable Dolby Digital encoded content:  \n\n\n*\n\n*iTunes festival 2012 - Usher (free, but probably not for long)\n\n\nA: You can use TVAndMoviesNow.com to search for titles with surround sound on Netflix, just check the box labeled More search options and then check Surround sound only.\n", "Q: Cannot access mounted .dmg over the network in Mountain Lion I noticed this with TrueCrypt volumes.

Is there a cover that is designed for standing up the iPad 3 in portrait as well as in landscape orientation? I'm not talking about the Apple official Smart Cover.

As you have asked for the case, then there are some cases that come with a stand. The crocodile leather plus stand case could be the right choice for you. It is built with leather and has a stand too. The black, white, and other colors are available. Hope this will helpful for you. \n\nA: The Moshi Versa origami case is great. It has a hard plastic back case and a thin cover that folds to allow the iPad to stand vertically (for portrait viewing, ideal for reading books) or horizontally (for landscape viewing, ideal for watching video). It also folds to make a 40 degree angle for typing. \n", "Q: Presence of a Linux partition causes FileVault2 setup to fail I'm currently dual booting Mountain Lion and Ubuntu 12.04 on a rMBP. Everything works fine, but enabling FileVault fails with the error message: \"Some information was unavailable during an internal lookup.\" I receive the same error message if I run \"Verify Disk\" in Disk Utility.\nBy experimenting over the course of half a dozen reinstallations, I made the following observations:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Ubuntu 12.04 (x64, alternative Mac version) and GRUB -> ERROR\n\n*Add a ext4 or btrfs partition using Gparted on a LiveCD without installing GRUB -> ERROR\n\n*Removing the Linux partitions (but leaving the hybrid MBR) -> NO ERROR\n\n\nAs a result, my best guess is that OS X throws an error as soon as it detects a filesystem that it doesn't recognize. Has anyone else encountered this problem? How do get OS X to ignore my Linux partitions?\nUpdate 1\nAdding 128 MiB of padding between partitions solves the \"Verify Disk\" error. Unfortunately, I still get the same error message when I attempt to enable FileVault 2. Interestingly, \"Verify Disk\" started returning errors as soon as I attempted to \"Repair Disk.\" Disk Utility seems quite adept at corrupting its own partition tables...\nUpdate 2\nI get more information if I run fsck_cs from the terminal. It looks like this may be related to FireVault2 using CoreStorage. Here's the output:\n$ sudo fsck_cs /dev/disk0\n** Checking volume.\n   Content Hint for disk0 is not Apple_CoreStorage\n** disk0: Scan for Volume Headers\n   Invalid Volume Header @ 0: invalid field value\n   Invalid Volume Header @ 251000192512: invalid field value\n** disk0 is not a CoreStorage volume\n\n\nA: I believe I found the issue: Apple expects 128 MiB of free space between every partition. Disk Utility hides this free space, similar to how it hides the ESP. If this padding isn't present, it generates the error I described above.\nEasy fix: Tell Gparted to use +128 MiB as the beginning offset for each partition.\nEdit: Nevermind, this only solves the \"Verify Disk\" problem...I still can't enable FileVault. See above for an update.\n", "Q: iCloud backup does not show up in restore list The only iCloud backups that show up in the list when choosing to restore a brand-new iPhone (4S) are ones from November last year.  However, I know that there should be much more recent backups than that.\nIf I look at the list of backups on an iPad that uses the same iCloud account, there are more recent backups listed (as well as the older ones that show up in the restore options).\nI've tried with a different iCloud account, where the iPhone that's being backed up is still active, and says that the last backup was a few hours ago.  However, it doesn't show any backups available for restore at all.\nIs there any way that I can get access to the backup that's (presumably) there?\n\nA: Not all versions of iOS can back up from backups made using more recent versions (i.e. the backups are not necessarily forwards-compatible).  Confusingly, rather than show these unusable backups in some way (e.g. disabled with an error message available on tap) they simply don't show up at all (at least with iOS 5.0.1).\nA new-from-the-box iPhone isn't necessarily running the latest version of iOS; it's running what was latest (or close) when it was boxed.  If the version on the phone is older than the version that was used to make the backup (which is actually quite likely now that iOS updates can be done over-the-air).\nThankfully, there is a simple fix: choose to set up the phone as a new phone, rather than from a backup.  Skip the step where you are asked for an Apple ID, since you won't actually be using the phone like this.\nOnce the initial setup is done, plug the phone in to iTunes and choose \"Restore\" (you can skip the backup of the clean-state phone).  This will download the latest version of iOS and install that first, and then offer to restore (either from backups on the computer or iCloud).\n", "Q: How to install font from sources What is the right way to install font from sources on OS X?\n\nA: You don’t want the \"source\" package from SourceForge, instead download the TrueType (TTF) fonts optimized for OS X from this website.

It's not always plugged to my MacBook.\nWhat's the best way to make a backup of it on another external hard drive (B) ?\nWanted features :\n\n\n*\n\n*fully automated (that executes itself hourly, or something like that)\n\n*incremental (in order to be fast)\n\n*only activates when both disks (A & B) are plugged in\n\n*works with multiple backup disks (in order to have a backup at home and another at work)\n\n*discrete indication that a backup is in progress\n\n*ability to pause or stop backup (useful if I am in a hurry and have to disconnect external drives)\n\n\nIt would be nice if backup disks could be networked, but that's not mandatory.\nI would have loved to use Time Machine in order to have an history, but it doesn't seem to work well with external hard drives that aren't always connected and I don't trust it for that use case (my internal SSD is backed up thanks to Time Machine, though).\nOnline backups aren't adequate because I have a very poor internet connection.\n\nA: Another possible option: use rsync and a launchd job to execute it when the disk is mounted. I believe Time Machine uses a similar approach to running on disk mount. For the hourly execution, you can use cron. The discreet notification can be done in a number of ways (for instance sending a mail or the Growl extension which allows notifications to be sent from the command line). killall rsync should stop the backup safely if you need to pack up and go. Also rsync is also entirely capable of networked syncing.\nIt will take a bit of work to set up, but the advantages are:\n\n\n*\n\n*it's versatile (see man rsync, they pretty much thought of everything)\n\n*it's discreet\n\n*it doesn't cost anything\n\n*rsync is quick\n\n\nYou may find this helpful for launchd jobs involving disk mounting.\nEdit: I should add that the --partial option to rsync will mean that the backup is resumed after killall rsync.\nEdit 2: You can use a Control Plane context instead of launchd if you prefer.\n\nA: I'm continually amazed by Carbon Copy Cloner's speed and advanced features. I just double-checked and confirmed that it can be used to clone external drive to another external drive. \nIt's free for a month's trial period with full functionality. I strongly recommend this app as the best option I'm aware of. \nAlternatively, there is another excellent program Clonezilla (I've actually linked you to the company's Tuxboot page on Sourceforge, because Tuxboot is an amazing program for booting from USB flash drives):\n\nTuxboot helps you to create a bootable Live USB drive for Clonezilla live, DRBL live, Gparted live and tux2live. It is modified from unetbootin and runs on both MS Windows and GNU/Linux. You can choose to download the latest version of ISO file then create the live usb.\n\nnb. You can actually use unetbootin on a Mac - there is a dmg download on Sourceforge I can't link to as new users are limited to two hyperlinks. I think to use Tuxboot on a Mac, you'll need to use CrossOver or Wine or one of those Windows emulation programs (I have done this successfully with CrossOver when I couldn't get the tar.gz installed). \nBut really, Carbon Copy Cloner has all the features you list and more so that's got to be your best option, I believe.\n\nA: I have used Time Machine for years to back up external hard drives which were not connected 100% of the time. Occasionally, it will require a full rescan of the drive to make its backup, which will obviously take longer than usual, but the system has no way of knowing that the drive hasn't changed since the last time the system saw it.\nWhy don't you trust it?\n\nA: My internet connection is pretty poor as well which is why I have turned to CrashPlan to perform local backups of my MacBook Air and always connected external HDD to a sometimes connected storage device. Indeed, CrashPlan also allows you to back up to your drive at work over the internet for free as well - this point however is moot since your internet connection is poor.\n\nA: I tried using External Hard Drives but i'm not satisfied coz it can be stolen or lost so I decided to back up my files using Cloud.

Is this normal? Or should I change speed of fan and make it faster for better cooling?\n\nA: I believe that it is common for the CPU to reach 90°C under heavy load. However a simple video should not bump an i5 into that region. Depending on the footage and format you are playing back you might want to try a different player (vlc mplayerX). If you are playing back flash HD videos in your browser (especially multiple streams simultaneously), that behavior might be common (due to the bad flash performance on os x). \nSo much for the software.\nSecondly you should take care of the outer temperature (e.g.is your computer in a very hot room) and even more importantly where your notebook is placed. e.g. does it sit on a carpet or any other good insulating soft cushiony surface that prevents heat from leaving your computer. \nThirdly you might want to take a look in the activity monitor and see whats using your cpu. (Maybe some background application e.g. spotlight indexing new pdfs)\n\nA: After further clarification, it seems that you're getting this high temperature from running videos on YouTube's Flash Player. Flash Player is infamous for its overall crapiness, especially its resource usage (especially CPU usage). One solution to this problem is to find solutions for watching online video (such as off YouTube) without using their Flash Player. Here are the two applications I use:\n\n\n*\n\n*ClickToFlash is a free app that replaces Flash content with a gray placeholder, which only runs the Flash content if clicked on. It works on most YouTube videos, detects the video frame, and lets you play the video using the HTML5 video player, which uses almost no CPU at all. As a bonus, it prevents Flash ads from running (which can sometimes slip by AdBlock)\n\n*HUDTube (it's accompanying Safari and Chrome extensions) allows you to open videos in an external player (much like QuickTime, but with a togglable ability to keep it on top of all other windows). It's useful to play the few videos ClickToFlash doesn't pick up.\n\nA: I have bought a Retina macbook Pro late 2013 13' and when i play civilization V my temps are 95/98, in idle they are 30/40..I think they're normal\n\nA: Try SMCFanControl, a free app for regulating fan speed. Your Mac only increases fan speed once core temperature hits a certain threshold. At this point, the mac is already hot, and the fan must work overtime to lower it. If you expect a high load, you can primitively increase fan speed, to avoid the sudden temperature spike.\n\nA: If youtube is giving you heat issues it's pretty likely that it's due to them using VP8/VP9 codecs by default, which your mac won't have hardware decoding for.\nIf you use chrome you can install the plugin h264ify. You should be able to hardware decode youtube with that & take the load off your CPU. \n\nA: This problem can be easily solved\nFirst, download and run the Adobe Flash uninstaller\nThen restart the computer\nSecond, place the power supply in a cool place\nIn one minute the temperature reaches less than 70 degrees\n\nA: In Safari, right click, copy url of the video and play it on VLC.

We wiped and re-imaged their laptops with new software AND with Mountain Lion. We just discovered that you can no longer use Time Machine to \"Browse other Backup Disks\" in Mountain Lion. (The option is there, but the functionality is broken.) The students will have to navigate in Finder to their most recent backup and manually drag the files to their new computer.  However, the Library is hidden on the disk, and they can't access it without unhiding it.  I know how to unhide the folder using this method in Terminal: \ncd ../../Volumes/WhateverTheyNamedTheirBackupDrive/Backups.backupdb/Student's MacBook Air/2012-07-30-192502/Macintosh HD/Users/StudentsUserName\nls\nchflags nohidden Library\nDoes anyone have any idea how I could script something that unhides the mounted backup folders' libraries? I'm struggling with the extreme variability of student backup disk names and folder names within a Time Machine backup. (And I can't exactly expect 400 kids to get it right in terminal.) \n\nA: Could you use something like this?\nsudo /System/Library/Extensions/TMSafetyNet.kext/Helpers/bypass chflags nohidden /Volumes/*/Backups.backupdb/*/*/*/Users/*/Library/\nbypass was in /System/Library/Extensions/TMSafetyNet.kext/Contents/MacOS/bypass on Lion.\n", "Q: Audible alarm for iPod Touch low battery I'd like my iPod Touch to play an alarm sound whenever the battery is low (for example, 10% power remaining). Is it possible to do this?\n\nA: Unfortunately not. The battery warnings are fixed system behaviour, and not configurable by the user currently.\n", "Q: Terminal won't choose new window settings at startup I've been running into an odd behavior on 10.7 where editing Terminal preferences to launch a new window setting via \"On startup, open\" doesn't result in the changed terminal after a quit/launch. \nAny idea what I may be doing wrong and/or how to trigger the new style?\n\nA: It sounds like Lion's resume feature is confusing the cause-effect relationship between settings and application behavior. \nThe \"On Startup, open\" should work, assuming that you had no windows open when you closed Terminal.app.  Lion's resume feature is enabled for Terminal.app by default, so quitting the application before closing any windows will yield the same windows the Terminal is re-launched. \nThe simplest fix is this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you've closed all Terminal windows.  \n\n*Restart Terminal.app.  \n\n\nIn the normal course of events, the resulting window should have the \"On Start, open...\" settings. If the steps above do not fix the issue, then I recommend deleting your Terminal preferences with a backup so that you can revert if needed. \n\nDisable Resume for Terminal.app\nYou can also just disable resume for Terminal.app. Run the following command and re-launch Terminal.app twice:\ndefaults write com.apple.Terminal NSQuitAlwaysKeepsWindows -bool false\n\n", "Q: How do I get my Mac to receive iMessages sent to a phone number? I love the new messages app on Mountain Lion. Ideally, if another iPhone user sends me an iMessage, I'd like it to appear on both my Mac and iPhone. Currently this only works if someone sends a message to the email associated with my Apple ID. \n\n\n*\n\n*Since Apple does know both my phone number and email, is there a way to have all iMessages appear on my laptop?\n\n*If not, is my only solution to ask people to text my Apple ID email so it appears on both devices?\n\nA: Right now OS X Messages can only receive iMessages sent to an email address associated with iMessages. So you'll have to ask people to send to your Apple ID email (or another one if you've got it set up with iMessages) if you want to receive them on your Mac.\nThere was some talk of Apple ID/phone number unification coming with iOS 6, so that an iPad or Mac could receive iMessages sent to a phone number, but that's not available yet, and from the publicly available information, it doesn't look like it's a sure thing either. However it's a possibility, you may want to pay attention when iOS 6 is released (which looks likely to be in September).\n\nA: This is now working with the Beta iOS 6 where an iPad can now get messages sent to the caller id of the iPhone.  However, it doesn't seem to work with the OSX iMessage app (or at least not that I can get working).\n", "Q: What is trying to launch 'java' on my Mac OS X Mountain Lion \nPossible Duplicate:\nIs there a way to determine what application wants Java installed? \n\nI recently installed OSX Mountain Lion and as you know, the default install removes any java VM, offering you to install it if something needs it.\nAfter login in, something does try to launch 'java' and brings up the \"To open 'java' you need to install Java SE 6 runtime.

An insecure wipe, a single pass of zeroes, a \"DOE-compliant\" 3 pass, and a DOD (Department of Defense) 7 pass. \nDOE doesn't stand for Department of Energy, does it? That sounds silly.\n\nA: DOE is a method to wipe disks, developed by Department of Energy as part in their manual to ensure the confidentiality of Department of Energy information.\nFrom macs.about.com :\n\nWhen Disk Utility uses the DOE-compliant 3-pass secure erase, it will write two passes of random data and then a single pass of a known data pattern.

Thanks a lot!\n\nA: No fully functional IDE exists on iOS to make runnable apps without jailbreaking  but you can sign up for a free Amazon Web service account and get an ssh client and program \"on the iPad\" assuming you have a network account.\nAn app like nimbus or textastic would be an ideal companion once you were clear how compiling elsewhere fit your desire to learn.\nXcode is currently only available for Mac OS X to develop programs that run iOS and cocoa touch (not which is very much not C++ - even though Xcode can be used for C++).\nHave a look at this question on learning C which will apply almost entirely to C++ on iOS.\nIs there a C compiler for iPad?\n\nA: Is your iPad jailbroken? If yes, download mobile terminal (a commandline) , vim (the text editor) and the gnu c compiler from cydia, and google for a file \"iosgcc.zip\", download, unzip, and enter the terminal and install the package of g++.\nThe way to jailbreak depends on the version of your iOS, visit www.jailbreakme.com as a reference.\n\nA: There is no compiler that runs on the iPad. There are numerous web apps that will accomplish what you're probably looking for.  This of course assumes that you are not hoping to use an iPad as a development environment. \nHave a look at:\n\n\n*\n\n*CompileOnline: Has C++ and many other languages. It's simple with no account necessary.\n\n*CodePad: Very simple. For short snippets only.\n\n*Compilr: Requires registration, but is more like a full-blown Web-ide app with storage available for your code. \n\n\nGoogle searches will get you further.  If you are looking for short, snippet based online compiler / interpreters abound.  Compilr works with the iPad and is looks to be sufficient enough to support small projects or college-level coursework. \n\nA: The development environment for iPad is called XCode and runs on Macs only.\nI would suggest you should look into anything that will allow you to enter code,compile it and run it in a browser window instead.\n\nA: Try CppCode ios app - http://www.cppcode.info.

There seem to be lots of people with this issue but couldnt find an answer.\nProblem happens on IPhone 4 with latest software running. This occurs with calls coming from contacts but 99% of incoming calls are from contacts anyway.\n\nA: Almost a month after doing the reset, the issue has not appeared, so I believe this has been solved. Dirt on the screen did not apply on my case but I guess it can cause this issue in some cases.\n\nA: I had this problem many times. To solve it I had to reset my iPhone 3G settings.

All the applications running are very slow to respond, and several have the \"Application not responding\" message when I right-click on them in the dock. Now everything works fine when the battery is above 5%, so I'm wondering what goes on when the battery is low that causes the performance drag. Basically, I have two questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*What is causing this lag (for the sake of curiosity)?\n\n*How can I fix it (for the sake of practicality)?\n\n\nSystem Info:\n\n\n*\n\n*Device: Macbook Pro (Spring 2012) 13-Inch running Mountain Lion (10.8)\n\n*Memory: 8GB\n\n*Processor: 2.8 GHz Intel Core i7\n\n*Storage: 500GB SSD Drive with more than half free\n\n\nA: See if this link provides you with some useful knowledge. http://smallbusiness.chron.com/change-processor-speed-macbook-pro-43635.html\nIt's likely that the MBP is automatically scaling the processing power back to conserve battery power, but that isn't necessarily the only cause.\n\nA: This is normal, the same thing happens on my MacBook Air (11 inch, 2014) when the battery gets around 5%, performance drops significantly, it does this because your battery level is so low, just plug it in a charger and it will start working normally again.\nIf this doesn't solve it, try resetting the SMC.\n", "Q: Can't mount AFP and SMB shares through Finder but can manually mount via terminal I have Mac OS X 10.6.8 on a laptop which cannot mount or connect to any shares, AFP or SMB, through Finder.

I've done a bit of research on the Internet, and it looks like I'm at a dead end.\nMy goal is to minimize cost, and be able to send and print documents automatically (approximately 10 or 20 pages per day) to a laser printer in a remote office.\nThe preliminary method is to use: iOS 5.1.1 (jailbroken) with 3G connection, HP (or other brands) printer with AirPrint, iCloud Documents and maybe write some launchd scripts to monitor any new documents in iCloud. Maybe with other software. I am not sure yet.\nBy using the cloud, I can upload new docs to the cloud anywhere in my city, and the iOS will be able to see them within a reasonable amount of time, then print it.\nBut it seems this combo is not workable.\nAnyone got any advice on how to make this set up work, or propose other alternatives? Currently I have a 3GS with 3G connectivity spare. Need to buy a new printer though.\n\nA: AirPrint isn't likely to help you here. It's a basically a local network only technology, because of how it functions, it's very unlikely that you could get it working over an iOS device's 3G connection. The only way I could see it working is with a VPN, but I'm not aware of any solutions that can pipe AirPrint over a VPN.\nWhat I would suggest (in rough form) is using email or Dropbox to send documents to be printed remotely. Pretty much any document you can access on iOS can be sent via email or Dropbox.\nThe basic idea is a computer running in your office that monitors an email address and/or a Dropbox folder, and automatically prints email attachments or files in the Dropbox folder. How you go about this depends on what software you're running on that computer, but on a Mac, you could print email attachments using Mail.app's rules filtering and some AppleScript, or files in Dropbox using a Folder Action.\n", "Q: Why are some apps greyed out when Command+Tab'ing through programs? Sometimes when I switch through programs using the Command+Tab shortcut certain programs appear to be greyed out.

I am trying to understand how you need to set things up when trying to run Windows from a Mac (using Bootcamp /  Parallels).  I understand the differences in terms of Bootcamp requiring you to choose at bootup versus running side by side with Parallels but I want to understand the implications around HD and RAM.\nSo lets say I buy a Mac with 512 GB SSD and 16 GB of RAM.  I see that if you want to install windows, you need to partition and allocation memory and disk space for Windows.\nOn Windows I would need to run:\n\n\n*\n\n*SQL Server 2008\n\n*Visual Studio 2010\n\n*Microsoft Office\nand a few other pieces of propriety software\n\n\nSo my questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do i decide how much space is allocated to Windows and once I decide that, can I change it in the future?  I was thinking about allocated 100GB to Windows which seems like it should cover me.\n\n*How do i decide what RAM is allocated to Windows.  Can I change that on the fly in the future after that decision?  Once I do this (lets say i allocate 8GB of RAM to windows), either through BootCamp or Parallels, does that mean that my Mac only will be able to leverage 8GB (since i have a total of 16GB) regardless if I am running Windows at that time or it only \"takes\" 8GB away when i start up windows.\n\nA: *\n\n*If you run Parallels off a disk image, you can expand that partition to as much disk space as you have available. All it requires is shutting down the VM. As far as I know you can't shrink a disk image.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you're running Parallels off a Boot Camp partition, it's possible in some cases to expand that partition later on, using third party tools. This depends on how the other partitions on the disk are set up (typically a partition can be expanded to fill free space after it, but you can't change the starting point on the disk).\n\n\n*How much RAM you allocate can be changed using Parallels. You simply shut down the VM, change the setting in Parallels and restart. This doesn't change whether you're using a disk image or a Boot Camp partition, but it's worth pointing out that if you boot from the Boot Camp partition (not in Parallels), that's running Windows directly and it will use all the RAM available to the system, like any other laptop.\n\n\n*\n\n*The RAM allocated to your VM is only \"used\" when the VM is running. If you shut down Parallels, OS X can use the full amount in your system.\n\n\n*How you allocate disk space and RAM depends on what you're doing with your VM, and what you expect to be doing with OS X while that VM is running. Think of it as configuring a whole new computer - you need a quantity of hard drive space and RAM sufficient for the tasks at hand. The easy part is that you can (mostly) change your mind later on if you guess wrong with a VM.\n\nA: MiniTool Partition Wizard Free does the trick to expand the partition if too small. So if you are running Windows through Boot Camp already,\nfirst boot to OS X, open Disk Utility, click on the main drive at the top. Click on partition and then shrink the Mac volume to the required size. Let the process completely finish and do no other work on computer.\nThen reboot and switch to Windows. Download the MiniTool Partition Wizard Free and set it up on Windows.\nOpen MiniTool, right click on bootcamp, click expand and make sure you drag the toggle to include all the extra space. Then click apply. When prompted click restart computer and then MiniTool does everything else. It takes 10 minutes.\n", "Q: Run iPhone with network off, wifi on Most of my iPhone usage is data - Google Voice, WhatsApp and Twilio Client.

I had a large list of reminders in OSX (Mountain Lion) sync'd to iCloud (i.e. my iPhone). While editing the list on the Mac and trying to delete (not 'checkbox') one work item, I accidentally deleted all the items in that list! Having a horrible delete user flow didn't help :( \nI presume there is local copy of the reminders database on my Mac - which is then sync'd with iCloud.

Does anyone know where that file is stored on the file system?\nAny other suggestions to restoring my previous copy of reminders or undoing the delete? The obvious,  undo doesn't work. Not sure why...\n\nA: You should be able to find them if you're using Time Machine, but it might take a little digging. I'm not quite brave enough to use Mountain Lion so I can't say with certainty, but I believe the reminders are actually stored as calendar items, so you should be able to find them in the \"Calendars\" folder in the Library. You might want to use the Finder interface to look through the backups instead of Time Machine. The iCloud calendars should be stored as random number \"caldav\" folders. You'll have to look inside each folder until you find the reminders you're looking for. You can then drag the files into the Reminders app which will allow you to import into a list.

I have 1TB external HDD I use for storing various stuff. \nThe thing is I selected the drive for Time Machine to work on but nowhere it is mentioned that it will either format the disk or Time Machine will create a separate folder leaving other stuff on the disk untouched. I am bit skeptical that it might erase my disk. I dont want that to happen.\nWhat will happen if I let Time Machine take backups on that disk? Will it erase everything? Can I use that for time machine without erasing the stuff on it?\n\nA: Time Machine creates a separate folder ('Backups.backupdb') at the root of the external drive in which it stores its backups, leaving all your original data intact.\nTime Machine does require your external drive to be formatted as HFS+, by the way.

The home button on my iPhone seems to work on and off. \nIt does take me back to the home screen but it feels like there is a loose connection and does not trigger on every press.\nIs there a fix to this besides Apple support?\n\nA: You could take it apart and fix it yourself, however it will void any warranty on the phone. You can view the iFixIt Repair Guide for steps for removing and replacing the Home button. Note that you will have to take apart the majority of the phone to get to the button. \nYour best bet would be to go to Apple for a repair or find an authorized repair service shop to do it for you.\n\nA: Thanks guys!\nBtw my phone is out of the warranty period, so no luck there. \nHere is something I found in the forum that can help as well (not as much as a fix than a workaround) - AssistiveTouch, which is baked into iOS. It provides an overlay on the screen for several functions, including the Home button. Credit goes to Bentsai's answer.\nWorks great!\n\nA: There is a trick I've used many times to 'fix' my home button, it only takes a couple of seconds and it works every time.  [But, disclaimer, the issues you have may be something different.]\nThe solution is to insert a charging cable into your iPhone (it doesn't need to connected at the other end, just the bit that goes into the iPhone).  Then if you put your finger on the botton of the connector (the solid bit that goes into the iPhone) and pull it towards you.\nIt would appear that the hardware parts are somehow separating inside the iPhone through repeating use of dock stations / connectors, and this just helps to squeeze the parts back together - albeit it isn't as good as it worked on day 1.\n\nA: This is commonly caused by a build up of dirt and or grease under the button, thus interfering with the contacts. One resolution is to get some 70%+ alcohol wipes and squeeze some of the liquid into the gap around the button (with the phone off) and give it a good old pressing. Leave it to dry for a few minutes and test. You don't want to go crazy with the amount you put in, but this will sort it out in many cases.\n\nA: I have the exact same issue. I'm convinced it's a software issue, due to reboot \"fixing\" it for a while, which might help you also.\n\nA: The alcohol wipes thing did the trick .. Just put some of the liquid from it on your home button so that it can go inside .. Switch off phone and press the home button many times so that the liquid somewhat goes inside . Wipe it off and check it .. Works like a pro\n\nA: The guy at the Apple Store told me to press the homebutton rapidly (center and moren on the sides). You will see the dirt come out. Wipe it off and repeat it until there is no more dirt coming out. Works fine for me.\n", "Q: Sync Google Contacts in Mountain Lion I am having trouble with keeping my Contacts sync'd with my Google Apps account.

I am currently using Apple 10.6 (Snow Leopard). How long will Snow Leopard be supported for? Does Apple provide an end-of-life policy in writing?\nI have read that Apple tends to only provide security updates for the latest two versions of Mac OS X (an 'n-2' support policy, where 'n' is the latest version of the OS. Since Lion and Mountain Lion are out, Apple might drop security updates Snow Leopard.\nAccording to \"Mac users left wondering if OS X Snow Leopard's retired\" from Computerworld and \"Where are the Safari security updates for Windows and Snow Leopard? Users left exposed\" on Sophos's blog, some believe that Apple has already, quietly retired Snow Leopard. However, those pages have some contradictory information (Tiger was updated in 2009).\nHowever, the articles above seem to cite rumor. Does Apple provide their support policy in writing?\n\nA: Apple don't provide any end of life information unfortunately, and you're correct that they only support the current and previous versions, although they do still release security patches for the one before that from time to time for another release cycle after this.\nSo you'll get up to 3 years out of an OS release, and that usually an Apple computer will be supported by new OS releases for around the same time.\n\nA: Haven't yet come across a support policy in writing, but this page would seem to contradict the notion that older products stop receiving current updates.

Is there any way I can tell if anyone has set up my laptop to where they can see what I'm doing remotely whether it be the camera or surfing? Maybe there is a way I can just look at what programs have been installed recently or what programs are set to run on startup, so I can make sure they all look legit?\nI don't have a password set on my laptop.\nSome back-story: a (very close but somewhat scary as I get to know him) friend watched my apartment while I was gone and I just want to make sure nothing was tinkered with. I believe he's technically savvy, and familiar enough to try to hide his tracks. It sat out in the open but didn't show signs of having been disturbed. He said nothing to make me think he had done something, but better safe than sorry.\nThe computer is a MacBook, of a couple years vintage, running OS X 10.6.8, and I don't have backups!\n\nA: A possibly malicious user with physical access to your machine and practically unlimited time could have indeed done much damage and covered tracks very effectively; the only way to be sure your machine is \"safe\" is to erase the drive and reinstall the operating system. Should you choose to go this route, back up your data first, then wipe your computer, reinstall OS and software from their install discs, then restore your user files  from the backup as needed.\nThat said, there are indeed ways you can reassure yourself about your computer's safety.\nI suppose you could physically look for fingerprints on the keyboard, but that falls outside anything I know how to do. Were you to attempt that, you probably would want to do it before any of these other methods so as not to disturb the evidence.\nThe program Little Snitch can monitor to see what programs on your computer are sending data to the internet. If someone wanted to spy on you somehow, it would not be enough for your computer to collect data for them; somehow, that data would have to leave your computer and get to them, which means some program would need to communicate with the internet. Little Snitch can find unexpected outbound traffic.\nWhile it's fairly easy to alter this one, if you do find files whose \"Last Modified\" date was while you were away, that is a sure sign that someone was doing something on your machine during that time period.\nIf your iSight or FaceTime camera is in use, a green light will appear next to it. If that light unexpectedly appears, this is a sign that something is amiss.\nIf your machine was off, rather than merely sleeping, when you were away, you can see if it was booted when you were gone. Go to Terminal, and type last |grep console to see a list of the most recent user logins.\n\nA: To answer you directly, for things that run on start-up, open up System Preferences from the Apple Menu, then Users. Click on your username and look at the Login Items.\nAs for installed programs, that's difficult, because he might have just copied files over. You can use Spotlight to run a search for recently modified files. Open a new Finder window then type * into the search box on the top right. Then click the + on the right hand end of the Search bar. Change the first parameter (usually Name) to 'Last modified date' is 'before' the date you came back, and click + again, and set to 'after' the date you went away.\nIf your laptop was on certain automatic clean-up processes might have run, so you might see stuff here.\nIf he's that good, he can change these timestamps though.\nTo add a couple of things to Daniel's post, you can also run history from the Terminal (in Applications → Utilities) to see the last commands run. This is assuming he didn't create then remove a special user to work as.\nThere are other places you can control stuff from too. /Library/LaunchDaemons and /Library/LaunchAgents, and ~/Library/LaunchDaemons being some.\nGiven you didn't have a password the system was wide open.\nAt this point, if you're still concerned, get a friend to help you with a backup/restore, or take it to a Genius at an Apple Store.

If you're getting a connection error, try doing it with your device attached via USB, not Wi-Fi (I've found Wi-Fi syncing can be a bit flaky at times). If that still doesn't work, open up your private key in a text editor, copy the text and send it to yourself in an email (or any other means that gets the text to your device). You can then copy that text, and when you click the key button in Prompt, it should give you the option to Import Clipboard Key.\n", "Q: App Store only sells latest OS X version?

Any way to get that anymore, maybe at Apple Stores? Or am I out of luck and have to go to 10.8 if I want to upgrade? Too bad I should have upgraded sooner when 10.8 wasn't out yet.\nUpdate: looking around online, looks like my Mac may not even quality for requirements for 10.8, but 10.7 should be ok.\n\nA: It is still possible to purchase 10.7 for installing/upgrading on your mac, see my answer at question Can we still upgrade to OS X 10.7 now that 10.8 is out?:\n\nAlthough you can no longer buy Lion through the App Store or directly\n  by SKU from the online store, you can still order Lion after Mountain\n  Lion was released.\nI called 1-800-MY-APPLE, it took some time to get through but they\n  told me that I would be able to purchase Lion, OSX 10.7 from them for\n  $19.99.  They would send me the physical copy through the mail.\n[…]\n\n\nA: Unfortunately you're out of luck. 10.7 got pulled as soon as 10.8 was released. That said,  most of what I've seen suggests that 10.8 is about on par, and possibly even a bit faster than 10.7.\nThe catch for you is that your model may not be supported with 10.8. The A1181 covered a lot of models, but the only ones that are supported under 10.8 are the ones with the model identifier Macbook5,2—which you can check in the System Information app, under Hardware Overview.\nIf yours is supported, the good news is that you can add more RAM (and do so fairly cheaply). 4 GB is what's officially supported, but you can go to 6 GB with a 2+4 configuration.\n", "Q: Mountain Lion freezes after sleep on iMac (Mid 2007) After upgrading to ML, my iMac freezes when going to sleep.

I did had the \"hdd to sleep\" and \"wake-up\" LAN checked. I still got a black-screen, and complete froze, noway to wake-up the Mac. Unplugging the power for a restart.\n\nA: Please try resetting PRAM and SMC. Also, you may want to run Disk Utility to perform a validate and repair on your permissions and disk to see if that helps. \n\nA: Reseating the RAM is certainly easy, and a real fix to many arcane power problems. Let us know if you've done that. \nThis seems to be iMac-related, I see a lot of similar posts around the web. If it were mine, I would be certain to remove any special Sleep or Hibernation setting, whether input by command line or via a 3rd-party Preference Pane. \nIf reseating RAM didn't help ... did you know, resetting P-RAM (NVRAM) and the SMC - Power Manager can be repeated ... and repeated. Especially the SMC.\nThe other thing to check is whether your second User Account -- which you did create for Fast User Switching, to test things like this, didn't you -- shows the same problem. Therein lies a clue. \nAnd I would not own a Mac without also owning Disk Warrior. The go-to repair after Disk Utility. You've run DU from another startup source, right? Repaired disk and permissions?\nAha, so Apple is the one recommending a reinstall for every fix. Overkill, but I guess easier for them. \nKeep trying - and uncheck that wake on LAN and anything else but the simplest sleep and wake. I highly doubt this is a network OR app problem, just a stubborn power glitch or setting the machine isn't letting go of.\n\nA: I'm copying in my answer from another post as the words \"Mountain Lion\", \"Freezes\" and \"Sleep\" instantly raise a few flags for me that suggest its all the same issue:\nI'm going to take a wild stab in the dark guess and say that this is related to the highly documented \"Mountain Lion wake bug\" (at least that's what I've dubbed it.) \nIt's been discussed in a variety of threads on apple support forums, but probably the most successful I found was this one. I had the problem too and I found that there was one simple fix on this thread. \nBasically, the theory (and I'm 99% certain it's correct) is that the bug relates to bonjour, and some apps that use bonjour in mountain lion are causing wifi processes to hang and thus crashing OSX. Anyway, the program that was doing it for me, and probably what I've seen to be the most common one, is Transmit, the awesome little FTP client by Panic. Unfortunately, Panics Menu Bar icon which can be quite useful appeared to be the worst culprit, but toggling off \"Show Transmit Disk in menu bar\" in transmit preferences  solved the problem.\nIf you're not using Transmit or if you're still having issue, run through that forum and hopefully you'll find one of the other fixes works for you.\nPS. Apple knows about the problem and I think they're working on a fix.\n\nA: PCIRootUID=1, this may fix this problem.

Since macbook pro retina's battery are no longer easily switchable I'm concerned about it's life and would like to maximize it. Before macbook retina I used to charge the battery to 50%, then after removing it I used the macbook without battery on AC power. But it's no longer possible. \nI googled a little but didn't find a clear guidance about how to use your macbook mainly connected to AC power and not doing damage to your battery.\nFrom what I know :\n\n\n*\n\n*Full discharges should be avoided.\n\n*Keeping you battery charged to its maximum for too long time is also bad.\n\n*Try to keep charging cycles as low as possible. It's battery life (macbook pro retina battery is expected to keep 80% of its charge after 1000 charging cycles).\n\n\nI try to disconnect AC power once a week until battery indicator goes down to approximatively 75% and then I connect back the AC to charge it to 100%. I don't know if it's the best steps to maximize the battery life but I think it's much better then to keep it all the time connected to the AC power.\nWhat do you think. How to preserve battery life working on AC power ?\n\nA: Apple Says:\nCharge your Apple lithium-ion battery whenever you want. There’s no need to let it discharge 100 per cent before recharging. Apple lithium-ion batteries work in charge cycles. You complete one charge cycle when you’ve used (discharged) an amount that equals 100 per cent of your battery’s capacity — but not necessarily all from one charge. For instance, you might use 75 per cent of your battery’s capacity one day, then recharge it fully overnight. If you use 25 per cent the next day, you will have discharged a total of 100 per cent, and the two days will add up to one charge cycle. It could take several days to complete a cycle. The capacity of any type of battery will diminish after a certain amount of recharging. With lithium-ion batteries, the capacity diminishes slightly with each complete charge cycle. Apple lithium-ion batteries are designed to hold at least 80 per cent of their original capacity for a high number of charge cycles, which varies depending on the product. \nCompared with traditional battery technology, lithium-ion batteries charge faster, last longer and have a higher power density for more battery life in a lighter package. When you know a little about how they work, they can work that much better for you.\nIt charges fast for convenience and slow for longevity.\nYour Apple lithium-ion battery uses fast charging to quickly reach 80 per cent of its capacity, then switches to slower trickle charging. The amount of time it takes to reach that first 80 per cent will vary depending on your settings and which device you’re charging. This combined process not only lets you get out and about sooner, it also extends the lifespan of your battery.\n\nA: It's best to follow the guidance of Apple: http://www.apple.com/batteries/notebooks.html\n\nStandard Maintenance\nFor proper maintenance of a lithium-based battery, it’s important to\n  keep the electrons in it moving occasionally. Apple does not recommend\n  leaving your portable plugged in all the time. An ideal use would be a\n  commuter who uses her notebook on the train, then plugs it in at the\n  office to charge. This keeps the battery juices flowing. If on the\n  other hand, you use a desktop computer at work, and save a notebook\n  for infrequent travel, Apple recommends charging and discharging its\n  battery at least once per month. Need a reminder? Add an event to your\n  desktop’s iCal. When your battery no longer holds sufficient charge to\n  meet your needs, you may choose to replace it. If your notebook came\n  with a built-in battery, you should have the battery replaced only by\n  an Apple Authorized Service Provider.\nLong-Term Storage\nIf you don’t plan on using your notebook for more than six months,\n  Apple recommends that you store the battery with a 50% charge. If you\n  store a battery when it’s fully discharged, it could fall into a deep\n  discharge state, which renders it incapable of holding any charge.\n  Conversely, if you store it fully charged for an extended period of\n  time, the battery may experience some loss of battery capacity,\n  meaning it will have a shorter life. Be sure to store your notebook\n  and battery at the proper temperature. (See “Notebook Temperate\n  Zone.”)\n\nBasically what it says is use your Macbook in whichever way is comfortable to you. If you prefer to use it plugged into AC at all times, just make sure to disconnect it at least once per month and let it discharge to make sure the electrons moving around inside it.\nCycles are based on a cumulative basis. If you choose to let it go down to 50% twice, that's one cycle. If you chose to let it go down to 75% four times, that's still one cycle. The cycles will go with normal usage and you'll be much happier if you don't worry about it too much. The hardware is designed to last much of the life of the unit since the switch from Li-on batteries.\nContrary to your post, Apple DOES NOT recommend running laptops with removable batteries on AC without the battery: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2332\nPlease check out this link from a less official, but still helpful source: http://forums.macrumors.com/showpost.php?p=9875442&postcount=23\n\nA: I asked Apple themselves and they told me that charge the Computer to 100% and then get it down as close as possible to 0% without it shutting down and then charge it back up and dont keep it plugged in, also you can close your laptop hence putting in sleep mode and not needing to shut it down. \n\nA: A recent article on Wired suggested that you should unplug the charger once it gets to 80%, then use it until it gets to about 40%, then plug it in again and charge it until 80%, etc.\n", "Q: Connecting 4 DVI (or VGA) monitors to the Macbook Pro Retina I have an existing four monitor set up connected to my PC via two video cards. If I move to a Macbook Pro retina, what is the most strait forward way to preserve this monitor set up?\nThese monitors are all Dell monitors that only have connectors for DVI or VGA (although my largest appears to support HDMI). \n\nA: You could run 2 DVI/VGA montiors via the thunderbolt ports with adapters, and 1 via HDMI.

In Lion, TextEdit used to open with a blank file by default. On Mountain Lion, it launches  with a file picker by default — either for choosing to store the file in iCloud or for opening a local file.\nHow can I make TextEdit launch with a blank file by default in Mountain Lion?\n\nA: System Preferences > iCloud > iCloud Drive ( Options ) > uncheck TextEdit.\nStarting with macOS Ventura, it is System Settings > Internet Accounts > iCloud > iCloud Drive > Options > uncheck TextEdit.\n\nA: If you don't want to disable syncing documents and data, run\ndefaults write -g NSShowAppCentricOpenPanelInsteadOfUntitledFile -bool false\n\nand quit and reopen TextEdit to apply the changes.\nTo restore (thanks to comments run)\ndefaults delete -g NSShowAppCentricOpenPanelInsteadOfUntitledFile\n\nTo set this for TextEdit only (thanks to comment by gklka)\ndefaults write com.apple.TextEdit NSShowAppCentricOpenPanelInsteadOfUntitledFile -bool false\n\n\nA: Go to System Preferences > iCloud > uncheck \"Documents & Data\" from the sync list. \n", "Q: What is the license on mac wallpapers? As a user (not a developer), what are the license terms governing use of the included wallpapers on broadcast media, for example, a website?\nCould I, for example, use the mac wallpaper as a starting point for building a banner to my website?\n\nA: Apple sources their wallpaper from others so it's not free use for any commercial projects. If you plan on making money from their source without modifying it severely, you could be sent a takedown request.\nThe Galaxy wallpaper in Lion is based off the Robert Gendler Andromeda picture: robgendlerastropics.com. They also got into some hot water for not paying the original artist for one of their iPad wallpapers, which was resolved: http://news.softpedia.com/news/Apple-Uses-Unlicensed-Photo-for-iPad-Wallpaper-134605.shtml\n\nA: Here is the Mountain Lion end user license agreement that is your best starting point for what Apple feels it has actually sold you for your money.\nhttp://images.apple.com/legal/sla/docs/OSX108.pdf\nOf course, you'll want a lawyer to give you advice on what is customary, but the artwork isn't explicitly called out as something you are prohibited from using commercially. However, you would want to be very sure of trademark infringement issues if a reasonable person would recognize that you are re-using Apple's works for commercial benefit.\nI personally would steer clear of using this and pay someone to provide you with your work or grab thing that are shared more explicitly under a creative commons license. Apple does indicate that you can use fonts under some restrictions (make something with them - don't just resell them) and you will see in the application specific licenses that in general you don't get intellectual property rights to any assets included in the software unless it's called out explicitly as done for the loops in GarageBand. The obvious uses like loops for music software are given knowledge base articles, but items like wallpaper don't get an article and you are expected to be able to read the license and perhaps between the lines of what the licenses don't say.\nBasically, you probably haven't been granted the right to re-use the assets, so use common sense if you don't know it's OK or have asked for permission to use it. You might find out that Apple has licensed these and you can use them, but I don't see any wording to call this out in the license terms.\n", "Q: Time Machine restore on new OS I have a Time Machine backup of my MacBook running Lion. My install of Mountain Lion just failed, and I'm going to format the drive and install Mountain Lion anew. Will I still be able to restore my files from my Time Machine backup onto the new version of the OS?\n\nA: Yes. Use the Migration Assistant and choose your Time Machine backup.\n", "Q: Safari 6.0 Rendering problems I have a 2011 MacBook Pro with OS X 10.8 I have noticed a lot of rendering issues in Gmail, and Google instant. It seems related to JavaScript. Has anyone had this problem and is there a solution?\n\nA: This is a common issue with Safari 6.0 (screen tearing, text not showing up, etc.). I've updated to 10.8.1 developer build and can confirm that I haven't had the issue pop up since I've updated.\nThe update will be going live in the next few weeks and that should help fix any tearing issues.\n", "Q: My iMac refuses to log me in \n*\n\n*I'm not an idiot, caps lock is off, num lock is off, I am using the correct password.\n\n*When I type in an incorrect password, the screen shakes as it's supposed to. \n\n*When I type in the correct password, the screen changes as if it is about to log me in, but goes straight back to the login screen in a second or two.\n\n*I have gone into single user mode and created a brand new admin account. Same thing, doesn't log in.\n\n*Safe mode does not work either.\n\n*Guest account is the only thing that actually works.\n\n\nI've been a PC user for almost 8 years, so I am relatively new to this whole Mac thing. The problem I am getting does not appear to be a very common issue, as I can only find a few threads on Google that relates to this.\nLast resort would be to reformat the computer -- I really want to avoid this option since 1. I have not backed up any files, and 2. This is my best friend's Mac, which he lent to me while he is spending a year overseas.\nOn a sidenote: The iMac fell on its side yesterday (yikes!), but since the Mac boots up and goes to the login screen, I doubt I have damaged the hard drive. However, since I am new to this whole Mac thing, I'm not 100% sure if the fall was the culprit of this issue. Anyone care to chime in?\nedit: Thanks for the replies. I booted the iMac with the Recovery Disk, and I tried re-installing the OS. The HD in which OSX was installed in does not show up -- so I tried deleting the partition. However, it gives me an error that says \"Volume Erase Failed - Couldn't open disk.\" Does this mean my hard drive is done?\n\nA: One thing to do would be to trick the iMac into thinking its a new setup but jumping into single user mode and deleting the .AppleSetupDone file in /var/db. \nRestart the mac and it'll act like the machine has just been pulled out of its box. (all your data and accounts are still on there). \nCreate a new admin account and see if you can login. You should be able to. If not something is seriously broken. If you can, run the standard system checks to see if anything is amiss. \n\nA: Sounds like something's screwed up on a system level.  The guest account might only be working because it might be configured such that files don't need to persist: IE, it doesn't need to be writing files to the disk.\nBackup your files, reformat, and start from scratch.  It might be repairable still, but you'd need to spend a lot of time investigating and fixing, or you'd need to hire someone.  \nEDIT: Silly me, I didn't read it as thoroughly as I could have.  Boot from an OS X disk, go past the first screen (careful -- don't wipe your data) until you see the Utilities menu.  You want Disk Utility.  Run a verify and perhaps a repair if it finds anything.  Run a verify afterwards again to make sure problems are fixed.\nYou can also try DiskWarrior, which in my experience is more thorough (and capable) than Disk Utility, but isn't free.\n\nA: Another solution is to start the computer up and hold down the option key. Then select the recovery HD as your start up drive. Wait for the computer to start up from it and then select Terminal. Simply enter the UNIX command that resets the password to whatever you want. This backdoor option is something to know about because it is also a BIG security threat to your computer UNLESS the computer has been locked down with a firmware password.\n", "Q: Valgrind Alternative for Mountain Lion Unfortunately, Valgrind does not support OS X 10.8 yet. After some Googling, I came across some forum posts where people were able to get it to compile and \"almost\" link. Does anyone know of any good alternatives to Valgrind for memory leak detection?\n\nA: The Instruments app (part of Xcode) is a very good way to look for leaks and run stress tests on the memory allocation of a running program. \n\nA: While valgrind can be installed, the current state isn't very usable. In a simple program I got the following result;\n==16016== \n==16016== HEAP SUMMARY:\n==16016==     in use at exit: 63,264 bytes in 364 blocks\n==16016==   total heap usage: 516 allocs, 152 frees, 67,154 bytes allocated\n==16016== \n==16016== LEAK SUMMARY:\n==16016==    definitely lost: 8,624 bytes in 14 blocks \n==16016==    indirectly lost: 1,168 bytes in 5 blocks\n==16016==      possibly lost: 4,933 bytes in 68 blocks\n==16016==    still reachable: 48,539 bytes in 277 blocks\n==16016==         suppressed: 0 bytes in 0 blocks\n==16016== Rerun with --leak-check=full to see details of leaked memory\n==16016== \n==16016== For counts of detected and suppressed errors, rerun with: -v\n==16016== ERROR SUMMARY: 0 errors from 0 contexts (suppressed: 0 from 0)\n\nThe same code will be fine with using valgrind on a linux.(compiled on their respective systems)\n\nA: Assuming you can be bothered, if you install MacPorts you will be able to install a functioning Valgrind (3.8.1 as for today) on your system.  Unfortunately MacPorts will require you to install the whole XCode, not just the CL tools, so YMMV.\n", "Q: Can a ML USB stick created with Lion Diskmaker be shared with others (who have their own ML license)? I purchased and downloaded Mountain Lion from the App Store for my own personal use. I created a bootable USB stick using the Lion Diskmaker utility to make it easier to install and for any future reinstalls.\nMy boss has also purchased a copy of Mountain Lion from the App Store for her own Macs, but the download is taking forever.\nIs there any difference between the USB stick created using my ML download, versus a USB stick created using someone else's ML download? Is it okay to use my USB stick in lieu of someone else's download to upgrade other Macs for people (assuming they already have a license for Mountain Lion)?\nUpdate: I ran a diff --recursive on the two downloads, and the only difference between them was Install OS X Mountain Lion.app/Contents/_MASReceipt/receipt. So technically they are slightly different, but functionally they're identical.\n\nA: No, there are no technical differences. And, yes, its ok to use someone else's Mountain Lion image, if you've purchased your own copy.\n", "Q: Preview copies aliens. How to change the encoding/make it work? Preview copies aliens! Literally. Here is a screenshot:\n\nThe text selected on the pdf was copied (Cmd+C) and pasted (Cmd+V) from Preview to TextEdit. What did I get? A bunch of aliens.\nI'm guessing this is an encoding issue. Is there a way to change encoding in Preview or something? Is there a way I can check what encoiding it is using and then choose the appropiate on TextEdit? Here is the text, just so you can see the squares for yourselves (No aliens, apparently that error character only appears on native OSX apps and not browsers).\n \n\n(I must admit OSX's error character is pretty amusing).\n\nA: The PDF file has been protected. You can’t copy-paste text from it. Plane 16 is displayed when a character is in the “private” area of the Unicode specification. This has been deliberately done to prevent you from copy-pasting.\nAlso, this is not OS X’s error character. It just appears when it encounters something in the private area of the Unicode spec.\nA PDF file optionally contains a mapping to the Unicode private area for each character in the font. This particular PDF contains such a map, so it will display the correct glyphs only in a PDF reader.\nSimple English: The PDF file is full of characters, which are mapped to different places in the Unicode private area. Normally, it would just display Plane 16, but because the PDF file contains a map which translate the private area characters into readable latin glyphs (a, b, R, F, etc), you see words in the PDF but aliens in other places.\n\nA: I had a half Chinese, half English PDF that also copied aliens (different alien though). It used to copy just fine until I added some annotations in Preview.app (some highlighting and text). I reverted to the previous version and it now copies fine again. Something to consider. \n", "Q: How can I use the \"signature\" function in Preview on Mac Mini with no camera? I have a Mac Mini with no attached camera. I would like to use the feature of Preview that allows you to insert a signature. This relies on taking an image of your signature using an isight/facetime/webcam. I do not have on.\nI do have a MacBook pro on which I use the signature function. Is there a way to copy a file from the the MacBook Pro to the Mac Mini to enable this function on the Mini?\n\nA: You apparently can transfer the signature from your Macbook to your Mac Mini.

If you run into any problems feel free to ask. \n", "Q: Time machine clean up hangs chrome (and other apps) Whenever Time Machine finishes a backup and says its \"Cleaning up\" other applications start to hang until its finished - worst of which is Chrome - Chrome won't open a new URL until Time Machine is done.\nToday this happened after Time Machine backed up only 65 kb of changed files - after that tiny backup it spent 5 minutes cleaning up. Very frustrating.\nI'm assuming Time Machine is locking files somewhere that chrome is waiting on. But I can't find mention of this behaviour by googling.\nIs there any work around available short of ditching time machine?\nI'm on snow leopard, up to date with software updates, time machine is backing up to a USB attached disk.\n\nA: I don't know, how to prevent it,\nbut here is solution how to exclude Chrome files from backup.\nIf not very important to keep the state of Chrome Browser at a certain moment - it might help.\n", "Q: Is Voice Control still present in Siri supported devices? I had an iPod touch two years ago, and it had voice control features for simple things like \"next song\", or \"what time is it\".\nIs this functionality still present in the current version of iPhone, or has it been replaced by Siri (which does not work off-line)?\n\nA: Voice Control is still available on the iPhone 4S, unless you have enabled Siri in the iPhone preferences (listed under the General menu).\nIf Siri is disabled, holding the Home button will still launch the \"classic\" voice control, which does work offline, and also supports a whole lot more languages than Siri currently does.\n\n\nA: Yes, voice control has been replaced by Siri on supported devices.\n\nA: It seams to be available on the iPod Touch. See the Voice Control feature.\nIt was replaced on the iPhone 4S, but not on the older ones . Siri is still just available for the iPhone 4S.

They all seem to use WebKit, so the browsing experience will be similar to Safari.\nHere's what I found:\n\n*\n\n*eCrisper $79. Looks fairly configurable, it would allow you to display some branding or supplementary information in addition to the browser.\n\n*xStand $99.99. This looks like the most actively developed and supported option. Available on the Mac App Store.\n\n*Kiosk $4.99 This is the cheapest ($4.99), but also has the fewest features, and hasn't been updated since October 2011. Available on the Mac App Store.\n\neCrisper and xStand both have demos available.\nAny of those should fulfill requirements 2 and 3. For the first one, I'm not aware of any way to boot up a Mac automatically when it gets plugged in. There is an option in Energy Saver Preferences to \"Start up automatically after a power failure\", which will restart automatically if the power gets disconnected, but for a cold start, you need to press the power button or use Wake on LAN.\nHowever once the power goes on, you can put whatever kiosk software you decide on in the login items, and enable automatic login (probably for a user with limited privileges, as an added security measure). That will get it automatically booting into the locked down browser mode.\n", "Q: Offline webpages reader/browser for iPad iPhone? Is there an app for iPad/iPhone that allows me to save an entire webpage including JavaScript, AJAX actions, images, etc., and open it when offline?\n\nA: Offline Pages lets users save entire web pages for offline reading, including formatting and images; 4.99 USD on Apple App Store.\nOpen in App Store\n", "Q: Remember Kerberos tickets after reboot I need to use Kerberos to connect to my network at work. The built-in kinit and ssh in Lion work fine for me. However, I need to get a new ticket and re-enter my password every time I restart the computer. Is there a way to make it remember the ticket after reboots (until it actually expires)?\n\nA: By default, the kerberos ticket cache is placed under /tmp, which is cleared out on reboot.  You can specify your own location for the ticket cache, in a location safer for long term storage, by passing the \"-c\" flag to kinit, and setting KRB5CCNAME to point to the same location, so ssh will use it.\n$ kinit -c ~username/mykrbcache\n$ export KRB5CCNAME=~username/mykrbcache\n$ ssh kerberoshost\n...\n$ reboot\n...\n$ export KRB5CCNAME=~username/mykrbcache\n$ ssh kerberoshost\n...\n\n", "Q: How to record audio over Powerpoint/OpenOffice slides? Many times I've seen videos of people talking while presenting their slides. How is that done on a Mac?\nI know that I can do a screen recording with Quicktime, and I notice there are two options New Screen Recording and New Audio Recording.\nBut there is no New Screen+Audio Recording.\nThanks for any help.\n\nA: You can actually record audio with a Screen Recording in Quicktime, you just need to set the proper option. Just open a new screen recording (⌃⌘N), then click the white triangle:\n\nYou'll get a popup menu with options to choose which sound input you want to record from:\n\nSelect the appropriate sound device, then start the recoding, and you'll be able to narrate as you record your screen.\n\nA: The type of software you want is called Screen Casting. There are many apps which do this, but it's usually the paid ones which offer unlimited recording with audio, although I'm sure there's something out there which will suit your needs.\nI used to use one called Jing, but having just looked, there's a 5 minute limit on creating the videos for free.

I may be going to China for a business trip and I've been advised to do this but not provided steps that work for a Mac.\nIs it safe to say that by setting \"IPv4 Configure\" to disabled that this will make it impossible for anyone to violate my Macbook through either Ether or Firewire? Should I do similar for an IPv6 setting?\n\nA: Recommend taking a \"throw-away\" computer and not one you will continue using after returning.  You're not going to be able to secure it just by disabling access (even with restricting boot).\n\nA: Most of your concerns and more can be found on the Security board of Stackexchange. \nHere is a post discussing Firewire concerns: https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/17051/safely-disable-firewire-thunderbolt-patching-up-dma-exposure.\nThis is about mobile devices but the same principles are true: https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/11612/what-are-prudent-security-precautions-to-take-for-business-travel-by-people-with\nAnd what you will eventually learn is that you will not be able to achieve: \n\nsecuring my Mac completely and utterly\n\nYou should take basic precautions but if you are concerned about your Firewire and Ethernet ports; you probably won't be able to stop whomever is trying to attack you.\n\nA: Turn on FileVault2 and set an OpenFirmware password. Shut it down rather than letting it sleep whenever it will be leaving your sight. That should protect you against any attack that could come over the Ethernet port or the Firewire port, although of course there's always scope for having your hardware hacked, e.g. by adding a keylogger to your keyboard.\n\nA: You can also remove the active network interfaces from the system; in the Network pane of System Preferences, highlight each interface and click the - (minus) button, or use networksetup -listallnetworkservices from the shell to show all available interfaces and then networksetup -removenetworkservice <networkservice> for each entry.  (Use networksetup -detectnewhardware to re-enable everything.)\nAgain, physical security is paramount; encrypting your hard drive and setting an OF password will greatly delay an attack, but not be 100% effective in preventing one. \n", "Q: Set macvim as default application after homebrew installation I've installed macvim via homebrew. This is working fine.\nBut when it commes to choose a default application for a new file type I cannot see MacVim. How can I set MacVim as the default application for a file type when it has been installed with homebrew?\nNote: The question is not about how to select a default application in Finder, the question is how to set an application as default which is not listed in /Applications and there fore not shown by the Finder as a possible default application.\n\nA: Try running brew linkapps. That's how you're supposed to do it, but it never works for me; if the same is true for you, do ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/macvim/7.3-64/MacVim.app /Applications (substituting the actual location of the app, if it differs on your system).\nHomebrew should have told you that when you installed MacVim.\n\nA: You can set the default app from Finder.\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the file (e.g. foo.rb) and then choose 'Get Info' (command I, or File | Get Info).\n\n*Open the 'Open with' section. \n\n*Select your default app and then press 'Change All...'.\n\n\nA: I had the same issue. I moved MacVim.app to /Applications and then symlinked it into the Homebrew cellar directory.\nmv /usr/local/Cellar/macvim/7.3-65/MacVim.app /Applications/  \nln -s /Applications/MacVim.app /usr/local/Cellar/macvim/7.3-65/\n\n\nA: Correction: This is no longer the case, see https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/issues/8699\nNote that brew linkapps puts links in ~/Applications, not /Applications. I had to follow the symlink (select your home directory from Favorites, select the Applications icon in the main pane, and click Open), then pull down the path list-box near the top of the dialog box (or hit Command+Up) to go one level back up the physical path.  Then you can see the icon for the actual .app folder.\n\nA: I had a similar problem, however I only wanted to use third-party MacPorts (a Homebrew alternative) applications where there was no native Apple version on the system.\nTo stop the MacPorts applications from being used in preference over native APPLE apps, I modified my $PATH: vi ~/.profile\n# Original PATH which favoured MacPorts Commented-out\n#export PATH=\"/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:$PATH\"\n\n# Modified path prepending \"/usr/bin\" in front ensuring native apps favoured\nexport PATH=\"/usr/bin:/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:$PATH\"\n\nUsing this PATH configuration, only if a native Apple application is not found will the MacPorts path be consulted.\nBEFORE PATH Modified: Default VIM is MacPorts\nTerrences-MacBook-Pro:pi-ap terrence$ which vim\n/opt/local/bin/vim\n\nAFTER PATH Modified:  Default VIM is Apple's version\nTerrences-MacBook-Pro:pi-ap terrence$ which vim\n/usr/bin/vim\n\nIf you want the third-party Homebrew apps to be default where there are alternatives in other paths, just ensure the Homebrew path is precedes them in your PATH.\nWorked for my use-case, but might not be right for alternate use-cases.   \nRemember to logout after changing your .profile for the new PATH changes to be effective-\n", "Q: App for offline bookmark reading on iPad I'm currently using Diigo for saving my bookmarks and reading them later on the iPad offline. However, it allows only the 20 last for reading.\nDoes anyone know an app that enables reading older history items offline?\n\nA: I really like Instapaper. Not only does it allow storage and hierarchical organization of seemingly unlimited bookmarks/pages, it has a nice, big cache and reading offline works like a charm.\nIt will save articles that are broken into multiple pages automatically which I particularly like.\nIt also sports an iBooks-like UI which allows typographic control, strips ads and fluff out, and helps with the reading experience. Frankly, I prefer reading in Instapaper than on the original site.\nLastly, it keeps track of where you left off in multiple articles if you don't finish one and move to another.\n\nA: I discover since few days, the Pocket App (http://getpocket.com) available for the iPad and iPhone, versus with Instapaper, you can bookmarks video and other kind of content and see on the iPad after the application have downloaded.\nAlso, you can use the Chrome/Firefox plugin to bookmarks directly from the browser, the link where you are.\nIn my opinion, is better than Pocket Instapaper\n", "Q: iOS: How to see pictures on a network hard disk? Which is the best free app for browsing and displaying pictures that are stored on a network hard disk? \n\nA: Yes there are many, like for example File Browser.

I did work on a Microsoft Excel 2011 spreadsheet (saved in .xls format) and noticed a file on my desktop that said it could not be trashed. It disappeared when I re-started the Finder. But the next time I opened the Excel spreadsheet, the work I had done had been lost — except for a 'sum' field which displays the total from the lost fields but says it contains the function  '=SUM(#REF!)'.\nPerhaps the Excel file on my desktop was a temporary storage file for the new data I added to the spreadsheet. Getting rid of this file may have trashed the data it may have contained.\nI've just done work on another spreadsheet and a new 'non-trashable' Excel file has appeared on my desktop. I hesitate to re-start the Finder in case I lose the work I have done. Has anyone else experience the same problem, and is there a solution? \n\nA: There is clearly a bug in Excel 2011 for files on the Desktop where Excel does not clean its scratch files during editing and quitting. Like you, only rebooting seems to get rid of them. The only workaround I have sorted out is to simply not edit Excel docs on the Desktop. I have not seen any data loss issues related to those files on the Desktop.\n", "Q: Organizing user home directory between SSD and HDD I've installed an SSD into a new Mac mini. I've installed ML, and used the migration tool to copy programs and user settings from the stock 500GB drive.\nWhat doesn't fit onto this 64GB SSD drive though, are the Pictures, Music, and Movies directories. Maybe 200GB worth. I use the Finder's shortcuts often for these directories, and like the different icons.\nHow can you configure OSX to take advantage of the large HDD for these directories that won't fit onto the SSD? \nHow can I wipe that HDD of the previous OSX install? A simple 'move to trash'?\nI've got external drives to help shuffle directories and files around if need be.\n\nA: You can use aliases for those directories containing lots of data. Example:\n/Users/you/Movies -> /Volumes/MyStuff/Movies\n/Users/you/Music -> /Volumes/MyStuff/Music\n/Users/you/Pictures -> /Volumes/MyStuff/Pictures\n\nThe easiest way to wipe the contents of the previous drive is to open Disk Utility, select your drive, and then select the 'Erase' tab. Choose the options you want and wait until it finishes.\n\nA: With the lastest version of Montain Lion, you can set up a Fusion Drive and let OS X manage where your files are at while you enjoy SSD speeds and spinning hard disk drive capacity, seamlessly. This option would be business as usual once the Fusion Drive is set up.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a Boot-able Backup and make sure Mountain Lion is up to date.\n\n*Create a Fusion Drive between the 64GB SSD and and the 500 GB hard drive. \n\n*Avoid manually managing what is or is not on the SSD\n\n*Do backup often, since now there are 2 things that can fail that can cause your one effective set of data to go bye bye.\n", "Q: How to make red distinguishable from grey in Terminal profile \"Pro\" The default for Terminal.app profile Pro is a black background with ANSI colors. Since the background is black the preferred color setting for Vim is background=dark. In this combination red text (emitted from syntax highlighting) is indistinguishable from grey text (at least for me):\n\n\"Foo\" is red, \"bar\" is grey. A color picker reveals that red is rendered as R=243, G=222, B=222, so yes it actually is a slight bit more red than grey.\nNone of the color changing options in Terminal.app preferences allows me to change this to something that makes me recognize it as red. So how can i make red look red?\nEdit (Further information from the comments): The issue is reproducible with any Vim (local or ssh remote, from OS X or mac ports) as long as Terminal.app is used for display.\n\nA: The problem is likely due to your vim settings rather than your terminal settings.\nThe color you mentioned is pretty close to color 224 (of 256 colors), so you might try looking in your vim colorscheme to see if that color is used in a ctermfg= declaration.\nTo test and see if I'm right you could try\n:syn match Foo /foo/\n:hi Foo ctermfg=red\n\nIf that turns the word foo red then you know your terminal's red is working properly and it will be an issue with your vim settings.\n", "Q: Ordering a 21.5\" iMac with a different graphics card I've searched through the site but it seems nobody asked this.\nBasically, my question is: When ordering a new 21.5\" iMac, is it possible to choose a different graphics card other than the listed ones? \nNow, online this is impossible (as far as I can see), but maybe I'm missing something? What about ordering it at some Apple Store and not online?\nPlease note that I'm aware that you cannot change your card after the purchasing. I'm asking whether it's possible when ordering the iMac.\n\nA: No you are correct there are no upgrade options available for the 21.5\" iMacs (Mid-2011). Yes, you are stuck with what comes in each of the two 21.5\" models available. Your eyes are not deceiving you on the iMac Specs, what you see is what you get no exceptions. \nYou graphics card options are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Buy the 21.5-inch: 2.5GHz model and get the AMD Radeon HD 6750M with 512MB\n\n*Buy the 21.5-inch: 2.7GHz model and get the AMD Radeon HD 6770M with 512MB\n\n\nAccording to MacWorld's article / review \"21.5- and 27-inch iMacs (Mid 2011)\"\n\n\n\nSo in reality you have two options, and its all in which machine you buy. If all you want is a graphics boot, your going to have to pay the premium to upgrade all the other components too, unfortunately there is no way around it, other than letting apple know you want options, give them some feedback stating so. \n\nA: Currently with the 21.5\" iMac, the only choice you have is between the base model with the 6750M, and the higher end configuration with the 6770M.\niMac's don't use standard PCIe expansion slot graphics cards like a desktop computer, but rather custom packages integrated onto the motherboard, like a laptop. This is necessary due to the space and thermal requirements of the iMac enclosure (as is the case for all Macs except the Mac Pro).\nApple typically chooses one or two GPUs per model for cost and supply chain purposes. In case of the current model iMac, the options are an Radeon 6750M in the low end 21.5\", 6770M in the high end 21.5\" and low end 27\", and the 6970M in the high end 27\" (with an optional upgrade to 2GB of graphics memory).\n\nA: Yes.  Looking at the iMac Tech Specs page, you can upgrade the graphics card ONLY on the top of the line 27\" model.  All others have only a single available card.\n\nA: In a 21.5 Mid 2011 iMac the GPU is not integrated onto the motherboard but it's true that you can't upgrade the 6570M/6770M to 6970M because of internal space - the 6970M is half an inch bigger than the 6570M/6770M (heat sink also). So, if you have now a 6570M your only option to upgrade it is 6770M.\n", "Q: DNS Issues after Updating to Mountain Lion I've updated to Mountain Lion, and I'm having some DNS problems.

(Which means at some point it was a normal folder.)\nThis may be a remnant from Lion, as the data for the Lion network folder will have been copied during the disk clone.

I would like a nice new keyboard with mechanical switches. Pretty much every high-end keyboard I see is a \"Windows\" keyboard, with the Windows key. And no Command key.\nI imagine that I could use a combination of remapping keys through the OS, and paint \"Command\" on one of the keys, in order to make my new keyboard just like the one built into my Powerbook.\nHow to map the Command key to a \"Windows\" keyboard?\n\nA: Remapping a Windows keyboard so that the key positions match a standard Mac keyboard is pretty easy.\nJust open Keyboard Preferences, and click the Modifier Keys… button in the Keyboard tab.\n\nThis lets you change the behaviour of the keys on each attached keyboard (make sure you select your external one from the top drop-down menu).\nTo turn the Windows standard Ctrl⊞WinAlt configuration to the Mac standard controloptioncommand ⌘, just change the Option and Command drop downs so they have the opposite entries (i.e. Option performs Command and Command performs Option).\nIf you want to change the physical keys, most of the premium mechanical keyboards use Cherry switches that have interchangeable key caps. You can get Mac specific modifier key sets from places like DAS Keyboard and WASD Keyboards. If you want to go nuts, you can even get a fully customized key cap set in a style similar to Apple's keyboards, as this guy did (looks pretty nice IMO, but I'm sure it's costly).\n\nA: Blogger Shawn Blanc wrote an excellent article comparing three popular mechanical keyboards designed for use with Apple computers:\n\nThis review has been typed out using three of the most popular\n  mechanical keyboards for Mac. They are:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Das Keyboard Professional Model S: This is the keyboard that I started with. I pre-ordered one a few months ago for $113, and it\n  arrived about a month ago. The Das Keyboards begin shipping on Friday,\n  April 27 for $133.\n  \n*Apple Extended Keyboard II: Bought on eBay, the keyboard itself is circa 1990, uses Alps switches, was not made in Mexico, and cost me\n  $31.45 shipped. I also had to purchase an ADB cable for $8.35 and a\n  Griffn iMate ADB to USB adapter for $25. Total cost: $64.80.\n  \n*Matias Tactile Pro 3: A well-known 3rd-party keyboard that bills itself as the modern version of the Apple Extended II. It seemed\n  unfair to write a review of Apple mechanical keyboards and not include\n  the Matias Tactile Pro. These sell for $149, but Matias was kind and\n  generous enough to send me a review unit.\n  \n\nHe goes deep on each, describing sound, feel, his typing speed, and compatibility with OS X. The article concludes (emphasis mine):\n\nIf you too want to adorn your desk with an ugly keyboard — one with a\n  loud personality and which increases typing productivity — then I\n  recommend the Das Keyboard. I prefer both the tactile feel and the\n  sound of the blue Cherry MX switches, and though I find the Das to be\n  the ugliest of the bunch, a serious typist knows you shouldn’t be\n  looking at your keyboard while you’re typing.\n\nGoing further than this - since mechanical keyboards are a bottomless pit of geeky fascination - I've found some other options (though I haven't yet tried any mechanical keyboards myself):\n\n\n*\n\n*The PFU Happy Hacking Keyboard has an unusual compact layout but is designed (and printed) for use with PC or Mac.\n\n*WASD Keyboards sells highly-customizable mechanical keyboards that let you totally customize how the keycaps are printed.\n\n*It differs by key/switch type, but many mechanical keyboards seem to have easily-replaceable keycaps, should you buy one printed for Windows and wish to change the appropriate caps to your liking.\n\n\nA: I can recommend the \"SpaceSave M\" from Unicomp. Keys are arranged and labeled for Mac OS. It uses buckling springs. Ugly as sin but joy to type on :-) The design has barely changed since 1984.\nThe one possible point of complaint is the action of the \"Function\" key. On Apple manufactured keyboards the \"Function\" key acts like a \"Shift\" key where the base state (shifted or unshifted) can be toggled in System Preferences. On the Unicomp keyboard the \"Function\" key acts like a \"Caps Lock\" key and cannot be toggled in System Preferences. Once I got used to it I found I preferred it.\n", "Q: How does Apple achieve such an ultra fast boot up? I'm a recent Mac user (MBP) and the booting time really surprises me.\nWithin few seconds, from complete power down, the OS prompts you to log in, then the rest just flies!\nAnd even faster recovery from sleep mode.\nI believe Mac OS is based on Unix BSD, so I'm wondering why we havent see such thing on Unix/Linux with similar hardware?\n\nA: There are many factors that go into booting speed (age of computer, processor, hard drive type and speed). The biggest factor is that Apple has a closed environment and it's OS knows what to expect in terms of hardware and is optimized for that hardware. With Linux and Windows, there are many factors that the OS has to take into account driver-wise in order to optimize itself. \n\nA: 5 top factors in this.\nThe biggest single factor is the primary hard drive. If your MBPro has an Solid State Drive shipped by Apple as stock (or an option), then it should boot in seconds because the OS and apps are essentially in flash memory (like RAM). I have a MacPro tower 1.1 optimised with an SSD running OS 10.6 Snow Leopard that boots in 7 seconds (and its 9 years old). If your Mac has a traditional Apple SATA or PATA spinning platter drive, then it will be significantly slower (20+ seconds to boot is common) because Apple pitch these for longevity not performance - typically Apple none SSD drives run slow at 5400 RPM and don't have major cache (its the first thing I change when I get a new Mac) and makes a huge difference to boot speed.\nSecond factor is what you have installed application wise and set to launch at startup (preferences / startup applications). A new Mac will be relatively light as there wont be a lot of bloatware on there initially. All applications in the Startup panel WILL launch before your desktop settles down, many in the background so you wont see them. Some apps are sneaky and pre-launch without asking you like Adobe's AIM software check which runs in the background ALL THE TIME. You can take control and disable these making them a manual operation once a month v much quicker boot. Use Utilities / Activity Monitor (its free on the Mac) - you will be shocked at what is running all the time and how much RAM and processor it is hogging.\nThird factor is your desktop - if you have a very untidy Mac Finder (desktop level) with 50+ alias folders and files on it, your boot will slow down significantly as the Mac will look at these paths FIRST to make sure they are still active / accessible. Ditto any network drives and external hard drives you have connected. For example, if your external HDD is slow to wake up the OS boot can stall for 5 to 7 seconds waiting for it. So keep a clear desktop (set up your alias in the Dock using stacks) and disconnect external drives unless you are using them.\nThe fourth factor (whilst not directly a boot issue) is Fonts / Language Kits / Printer Drivers. By default Apple overloads these in the root OS to help novices (so the Mac just works everywhere) but they bloat the system - especially loading 300+ fonts before it opens any app. Take out the printer drivers and languages you don't need (about 10GB) and use a Font Manager like Lintotype Font Explorer Pro which will reduce pre-loaded fonts to just 30 ish core system fonts - it will then load fonts only when an app needs them (I have 10,000 fonts on my system as a graphic designer - probably only 150 open at any one time). Significant boost.\nFifth factor - max the RAM. Most Macs ship with the minimum e.g. 4GB. This is simply not enough and you will have slow boot and the spinning ball often. Max it and everything will run smoother. \nFootnote: from experience, I can advise you that any portable is slower than a desktop. This is not a myth. I invested in a top line MacBookPro QuadCore i7 17\" 8GB Ram and 1GB graphics card, the original Apple workstation MBPro circa 2012. Initially I was very disappointed as it was slow compared to my lesser QuadCore i5 iMac, 4Gb Ram, 512MB graphics. Why? Because inevitably, portable is synonymous with BATTERY LIFE, WEIGHT and HEAT / NOISE so the laptop is nobbled in several areas to favour these - there is no room inside a MBPro for two big fans on-board the graphics card so it has to be limited or it would overheat the first time you played COD on a plane and burn your knees.  So, although not advertised as such, laptops are not equivalent to desktops in terms of like for like performance. On the MBPro I mention, it does tell you this in the detail and has two states - desktop (powered) and battery to offset this performance drop. Desktop mode is still limited compared to a Mac tower or iMac.\nHope this helps answer the question and to optimise your next Mac purchase.\nP\n", "Q: Smart Playlist in iTunes for songs that contain lyrics I’m looking for a way to create a Smart Playlist in iTunes that contains only songs without lyrics. \nOr to be more specific, I want to be able to create a Smart Playlist of songs that I haven’t put through Get Lyrical and then run it though the app so that it gets lyrics for the songs that I don’t already have lyrics for.\nI’m using iTunes 10.6.3 (25) on a mid 2010 MacBook running Mountain Lion.\n\nA: You can't do this with a smart playlist as Apple doesn't expose the lyric field there.\nYou can create an Applescript that creates a playlist.

The smart playlists take certain aspects of a song, and use them to filter through your entire library, looking for matches. They do not check the lyrics.\nHowever, if you were to somehow get your 'Get Lyrical' app to make a minor, consistent change to the song title, or to rate all non lyrical songs a particular rating, then this could be used to filter out only the songs you want.\nHow to get this to work, I do not know.\n\nA: Rerun Get Lyrical on all songs and save a playlist at the end. This is the only way I know of.\n\nA: TrackSift 2 seems to be able to do at least some of what you want.\n\nA: When you run Get Lyrical, say Yes to the option to replace existing lyrics.

My brother has an iPad 1 running iOS 5, and keys don't repeat at all. Instead, if you hold them down long enough, you get the option to chose special characters, but if you don't choose any special characters you still get the letter you pressed. iOS updates are free, so if I were you I would update to iOS 5, which should fix your problem. (You can do this by plugging your iPad into a computer, opening iTunes, clicking on the iPad in the sidebar, and clicking the 'update' button.)\n\nA: Although there is currently no way to adjust the key repeat rate on iOS, one solution may be to find a usb keyboard that your father can use. Getting a keyboard that has a large travel (the keys are tall, as opposed to the more modern slim keys) might help with this.\nUsing the Camera Connection Kit from Apple, you can connect just about any USB keyboard to an iPad.\nAlso, in Settings > General > Keyboard > Shortcuts you can define letter combinations that will auto-expand to longer phrases. For example, the default \"omw\" expands to \"On my way\". Defining shortcuts for things like signing off messages, or people's names can be useful.\nLastly, take a look at Settings > General > Accessibility > AssistiveTouch as your father may benefit from custom gesture controls. Although it may not help with typing, it provides multi-touch gestures from the tap of a button. \n", "Q: How to use Finder's \"Open With Application\"?

In Windows I use WinSCP. How can I do this?\n\nA: It sounds like you're using (S)FTP to connect to your server. Finder doesn't support SFTP and supports read-only access for FTP. You can use Terminal and the command line SFTP client, or you'll need to use a 3rd party app like Cyberduck or Transmit to connect via FTP or SFTP.\nThe Finder supports AFP, SMB (Windows file sharing), NFS, VNC, and probably a few others I'm forgetting via the Connect to Server window.\nDetails on supported protocols can be found in Finder Help\n\nA: You can also use xdav via a command like https://[your xdav server]\nAlternatively I recommend Expandrive which works quite transparently as a mounted disc. (The only issue if the disc is large is the possible indexation by Spotlight)\n", "Q: How to install Snow Leopard from USB where USB disk is prepared using Linux? I'm trying to install Snow Leopard (a retail version) into my MacBook, but seems like that the MacBook can't find the boot disk over USB. \nI guess this is related to the fact that I mounted the .iso of Snow Leopard via Linux, using dd if=image.iso of=/dev/sdx and this rewrites the boot sector.\nIs there a way to copy the ISO into my USB disk via Linux and make the MacBook recognize this? \n\nA: Why use Linux for this? Just do it in OS X. To prepare the USB drive (e.g. 8-GB flash drive), you need to partition it using the GUID scheme and format it to the file system standard 'Macintosh Extended (Journaled)', also known as 'HFS+ (Journaled)'.\nThen use Disk Utility's Restore feature to copy the contents of the iso image file (Source) to the USB drive (Destination). When done, restart the Mac keeping the Option key pressed – the USB drive should then show up in the boot volume lineup... \nThere are many tutorials for this process on the Internet, e.g., http://www.maciverse.com/install-os-x-snow-leopard-from-usb-flash-drive.html\n", "Q: Data recovery on Lion with a disk that disk utilities cannot mount? I ran iDefrag last night because my MBP was running sooooo slow. I barely ever use it and it has 300 GB of free space. I used to use OnyX to optimise the disks on Snow Leopard but I didn't see that option in Lion. I let iDefrag run and went to sleep. This morning I woke up to the Do Not Enter sign and the spinning thing below it. I made sure I left it plugged in so I don't understand what happened.\nI booted into recovery and tried to run the disk utility but the repair failed. I tried to reinstall Lion but the drive can not be mounted. I'm currently downloading Lion onto a USB Drive, but now I'm thinking 16 GB won't be large enough to migrate my data like this guide shows: http://www.thomasverbeek.com/blog/?p=183\nAm I even going about this correctly? I don't even know if the drive will be mountable once it's done downloading. I just don't want to lose the files on my desktop.\n\nA: Reinstalling Lion won't necessarily save your data. It sounds very likely your hard drive was failing (disk access substantially slower than normal can be a symptom of failed reads and/or the drive attempting to recover), and it died during the defrag.\nThe USB drive is only used to install Lion (just like a DVD), not to transfer any of your existing data.\nYour next step should be seeing if you can mount the drive on someone else's computer, either via Target Disk Mode, or taking the drive out and putting it in an external enclosure. However if the recovery mode can't mouth the drive, chances are another computer can't either.\nIt's hard to say for sure without more information, but at this point it's likely your best bet for recovering your data is having good backups. Failing that, there are data recovery services, but they can be extremely expensive.\n", "Q: Can't download DOC or PDF from iCloud web app \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhy won’t iCloud let me download Pages documents uploaded from a computer? \n\nI recently updated Pages, Numbers and Keynote to the latest versions, and my OS to Mountan Lion. I went ahead and tried the \"documents in the cloud\" feature by saving a Pages document on iCloud. \nAs a long time user of the now shut-down iWork.com beta, I was surprised and pleased to find the following menu on the iCloud.com iWork web app:\n\niCloud appears to allow download in other formats but the options are disabled for some reason.\nHow can I enable this document to be downloaded in PDF and WORD formats?\n\nA: It seems to be enabled after having opened on iOS, my thinking is that it's something to do with the message you get when opening an iOS version of something created on OS X, which lets you open copy or open, saying that it may look different. Anyway, after opening on iOS, you can download from iCloud.com in all three formats, however, after saving or editing on OS X the PDF and DOC options are blanked again.\n", "Q: How do I stop emails highlighting dates (with links to my calendar)?

My 6-year old kid uses the family iMac for his Kodu-projects, which require Windows. He wants the real deal with Boot Camp and won't accept any virtualization :)\nThe problem: I want the OS X-disk to be the startup disk, of course. He wants a convenient way to restart the computer in Windows-mode (easier than pressing the Command-key at startup). There are some Apple-scripts and applications out there (like BootChamp), but they all ask you to enter the admin password. Despite (or because) he's quite computer savvy, I'd rather not give it to him at this point.\nWhat options do I have?\n\nA: BootChamp requires you to input the administrator password at its first use, but after that it allows you to restart without asking you for the password again. Unless you child is tech-savvy enough to get into Keychain, I think BootChamp may be exactly what you're looking for. It's also very easy on system resources.\nAfter installation, you could reboot into Windows yourself, giving BootChamp future permission by inputting your admin password. From then on he'll be able to change OSs without having admin access.\nI have had BootChamp crash a couple of times, usually when I plug in a USB device or remove one without using OS X's remove function. I've been running it for several months with only five or so instances, so it's pretty rare, but something to consider.\nCheers!\n\nA: If you don't mind doing a bit of shell scripting, and you've found a script you can run from the Terminal that will switch to windows, you can create a script containing that command (and maybe a reboot command following it). Let's call it winreboot.sh for sake of argument. Then change the owner of that script to root, mark it as executable and put it in a useful location (such as /usr/local/bin/). If you run it like so:\nsudo /usr/local/bin/winreboot.sh\n\nIt will ask you for the admin password, and then should do its thing, as the script then runs as root. However, sudo maintains a list of rules on which users are allowed to run what commands using sudo, and whether or not a password is required. This ruleset is stored in /etc/sudoers - unfortunately the syntax is very confusing, which is why you're not supposed to edit the file directly, but should use\nsudo visudo\n\ninstead, which checks your syntax on saving. Note that this uses vim for editing, which you might want to read up on before running it - it can be very confusing if you're not used to it. (to quit it without saving, press <ESC> and type :q! followed by the <ENTER> key) If you can't get on with vim, edit a copy of sudoers with your favourite editor and check the syntax with visudo -f /path/to/sudoers-copy. If it's OK, copy it back over the original.\nGetting back to the point, the rule you want to add to sudoers is that you want users in the admin group to be able to run your script as root without a password. That looks like this:\n%admin  localhost=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/winreboot.sh\n\nAdd it as the last line of sudoers. If you now try to run your script with sudo (must do so with absolute path), it will NOT ask for a password and just run it instead. Wrap the sudo command in another shell script, link to it from the desktop or wherever, and your 6-year-old should be able to switch to Windows any time.\nHope that helps, let me know if anything is unclear.\n\nA: Install rEFit?\nIt will give you a graphical boot loader so you can simply choose OSX, Windows, or some utilities at boot.\nIt's easy to remove if you don't like it, simply delete the rEFit folder from the root of the OSX partition.\n\nA: rEFIt is no good if you have a wireless keyboard and mouse as it won't recognize them.\nIt's a pain in the backside for our meeting-room mac minis. or rEFIt needs to be able to use wireless keyboard and mouse.\nBootChamp is the way to go IF you trust your keychain security.\n", "Q: Is there a desktop pager for Mac OS Lion? A desktop pager is a little program that sits in the corner or the dock, that allows me to switch desktops with a click, and drag windows between desktops.\nSomething like KDE had with kpager:\n\nMission control is very nice, but it works better when you use a trackpad and not a mouse, and it can be quite an interruption. To move windows between desktops with key combos you need some acrobatics (click and hold titlebar, then ctrl+⬅). With a pager, you could just fling the icon to a different desktop.\nIs there a desktop pager for Mac OS (Lion)? \n\nA: You can indeed use a mouse efficiently with Mission Control. Set any corner, preferably bottom, as the hot corner (System Preferences > Mission Control > Hot Corners) for Mission Control. After that, it’s just simple drag and drop, and you can switch apps and desktops in under a sec, or 2 secs with a file being dragged.\n\nA: There is also a shareware, totalspace which I found gives you the closest experience to unix-like pager.\n", "Q: How to transfer from iPhone album to Mac My iPhone contains pictures from camera roll and pictures I synced from my previous Mac to the iPhone album.

For a few days now I've noticed that the PID keeps going up quickly, at a rate of over 200 or so an hour. \nI'd like to make a log entry of every process that starts (and quits) so I can figure out what is happening.\nI've looked in the logs and with Activity Monitor but I haven't seen anything obvious. \nWhatever is happening doesn't appear to stop the MBP from going to sleep though.\nCurrently using Mountain Lion 10.8.0 on a late 2008 MacBook Pro\n\nA: There is a command execsnoop that you can run in a terminal window. Like so:\nsudo execsnoop -v\n\nA more detailed log of all that is going on requires a bit of dtrace hacking, as you need to track the fork and _exit system calls as well.\nEdited to add a bit of explanation: Processes don't “start” on a unix system. New processes are created by the fork system call, which results in the calling process being split into two (almost) identical processes. One (the parent) keeps its PID, while the other (the childe) given a new PID. The most common reason for a fork is for the child to exec a new program; it's this fork+exec combination that you most commonly think of as a new process starting up. This is why you need to track three system calls (fork, exec, _exit) for the complete view. But just tracking exec, as execsnoop will do, seems sufficient for your purposes.\n", "Q: Will a Lion Fortran Binary work on Mountain Lion? I want to install a fortran binary from here GCC wiki GFortran binaries, but the binary for Mountain Lion is not yet available.  Would the binary for Lion work, or would it be a terrible mistake to install it?\n\nA: It should run just fine on Mountain Lion, and it should not do any damage to the Mountain Lion machine.\nThere is only one way to know for sure if it will work - installing it. I didn't want to do this because I am not sure how to test it, but will say that it shouldn't be a terrible mistake to install. \nIt will either not run (due to various things like Gatekeeper, minor API changes between Lion and Mountain Lion, etc) or not even install. Otherwise, a Mountain Lion specific build either uses new APIs, etc. \nFinally, quickly browsing around online it looks like depending on your install there may be an issue error trying to exec 'f951': execvp: No such file or directory\".

Is there a hardware limitation of some sort, or is it just restricted for some other reason?\n\nA: Hardware limitations.  Note that Mountain Lion's supported models are for at least partially multitouch-capable trackpads; ML doesn't require you to use, say, a 4-finger swipe.\nI haven't used any of my Magic Trackpads with 10.8 yet, but it should be fine.\n\nA: The old-style trackpad can detect up to something like 15 fingerpoints on it's surface (as someone proved when running linux on the laptop, can't remember where I saw it though). However it is difficult to make the laptop support the gestures, because the software detects the laptop model and does not offer the multitouch gesture options.\nHowever, there must be some way of tweaking it or using some 3rd party software - try doing a four finger swipe on an old MacBook trackpad - the pointer does not move, so the software detects it, it just doesn't know what to do with it.\nAs I said, I read a very interesting article about this somewhere, but I cannot for the life of me remember where. \n", "Q: Accessing iOS iCloud app data from a Mac?

I've purchased a new iPod touch 4G last week through a 3rd party reseller. I saw the packaging is still good in white plastic around the acrylic box. The seller assured me that the product is new and still in sealed condition. \nThen, he unsealed the box to open it and picked the unit to another room (he said that he wanted to activate it first). 5 minutes later, I received the unit again and noticed that the iOS was 5.1.1 (I thought it was supposed to be 5.0.1 considering it was released in 2011)\nThen I went home to register the iPod in my ASP (with the SN of course). However, after I put in the serial number, this came up :\nAccording to our records, this serial number is registered to another Apple ID. If you have more than one Apple ID, log in to My Support Profile with that Apple ID to see your other registered products. Not sure if you have another Apple ID? \nAs I was about to contact Apple with telephone support, this came up :\n1. Valid purchase date\n2. Telephone technical support : Expired\n3. Repairs and Service Coverage : Active, 2 August 2013\n4. Elgible for Apple Protection Plan \nYep, the telephone support had expired and the warranty was less than 365 days. I went back to that guy for an explanation but he said that I'd better bring this matter to the Authorized Service Provider. Before I went there, I did noticed that the iPod touch often freeze after \"slide to unlock\" and I had to hard-reset it to get it back working. Then, it's battery capacity was awfully weak; I used it for music then it got 20% warning in just 2 hours from full charge.\nSo I did go the Authorized Service Provider, but the guy at the ASP laughed at me because I've received a quite non-functional product which was not supposed to be sold to customer just by looking at the serial number and the part number (ZP). Honestly, I don't even know where was ZP region located ? (My iPod touch 3rd Gen was a ZA actually). Those guys also said that Apple won't be held responsible for such thing.\nHence, I don't know where should I bring this matter, since both sides (reseller and ASP) are dead-end. I wanted to ask guys here if there were really such thing as \"not supposed to be sold\" iPod touch. Or if there's someone else have the same problem as I did.\nI can only think of one thing, probably this iPod was a display unit, then somehow, the seller cleaned the box and the unit then resealed it again to make it looked new. I don't even know if it's possible to reseal an iPod packaging.\nI don't know where else to ask, so I hope that I might find something here.\n\nA: Phone AppleCare, they will have more details on the original purchase date, location and registration details. Then take this information to the reseller and demand your money back if it was sold as new. If they are an Apple Authorised Resealer consider reporting them to Apple for not following the correct sales procedures. \nIn future I would suggest buying directly from Apple wherever possible.\n\nA: As far as I can tell, you might be doped by the reseller (since you said 3rd party, I'll assumed that it's not an authorized reseller). By looking into your problems, I've done some searches through google. Here's what I found :\nAccording to this website, ZP covers a lot of region. Your unit might be came from Hongkong and Macau. But it doesn't stops there. I also found ZP products in Malaysia, Indonesia (ID), and Australia + New Zealand. From the looks of those items, ZP iPods are legally sold only in Hongkong, Macau, and Australia + New Zealand. (I need someone to confirm if there are legal ones in Malaysia)\nIn short terms, I may conclude that you bought the iPod in Indonesia or Singapore because you had ZA iPods before the ZP ones which were both (illegally) imported to your country (especially through a 3rd Party reseller). Legal products were to include import tax, however if your seller could bought some iPods from Malaysia or Australia, packed them in a luggage, and traveled back to your country, the seller may get better profit this way (I've tried once with 3 macbooks actually, so it might work).\nUnfortunately, that's a risk you'd have to take if you bought it through a 3rd Party reseller. However, about your ASP who said \"quite non-functional product which was not supposed to be sold to customer\", it'd be quite right for illegal products. I thought that your iPod may be used iPod in other countries which then bought by the reseller and he resold it.\nHere's how :\n\n*\n\n*Since the product was a display unit but still functioning (at least), the seller bought it from another store at a cheap price (this would explained how the box and the contained headphone + cable still looked so good).\n\n*Then, he restored it with iTunes to wipe any data but it could not revert the iOS to the default 5.0.1 (that's why your iPod touch got 5.1.1)\n\n*He'd cleaned the unit and the box carefully, putting the unit back to its box, and he'd used an illegal seal to reseal it again.\n\n*He'd put a good price for that fake new iPod too (i.e. $199 instead of $229 for Indonesia)\n\nSource :\nI've bought an iPod touch 4G during my visit in Medan (island of Sumatra, if I wasn't mistaken)  a few months ago because I thought it'd be cheaper here, but I got a used one while the seller said it was new. I knew this from the fact that I didn't had to register it for the first time. The box was sealed as well but then I found out the seal was just another fake adhesive tape.\nYou also mentioned that you can't register your iPod touch into your Apple Support Profile. You could ask your seller to unregister it first for you. Some stores, registered its product in order to make sure that it won't be missing or stolen. But, if your seller is witted enough, he could've snatched an iPod touch with its box. However, that could only be possible if your seller admitted that they can't unregister it for you.\nAnyhow, you'd have hard time to get to Apple, since you'd be in South East Asia. The closest Retail Store there would be in Australia. Since, it wasn't an Authorized store, you could always demand full refund from your seller for selling bogus iPod but telling you that it was new. In another word, the store cheated on you.\nThen, you could wait until the new iPod touch to be released and buy a perfectly new unit. Sorry if this is too long, but I hope this might help.\n\nA: Freeze when unlocking might be cause by the small number of RAM inside iPod touch 4G. However, there's also a possibility of a faulty RAM module from the factory.\nThe short battery or unstable battery life is definitely a factory flaw. There's no other reason for battery flaw when you got the iPod brand new.\nMeanwhile, I've checked the SN you emailed to me through the help of my local ASP. The purchase date was in 4th January when it was pre-installed with iOS 5 (not 5.1) and registered somewhere in Malaysia (I still can't found out what was the appleID).\nMy wild guess would be a customer who bought the iPod touch, registered it, and found out it was defective. So he/she went back to the shop in Malaysia for a refund. The store accepted it and restored the iPod touch to 5.1, then resealed it back so it will looked like new. I found out that resealing was quite easy to do especially to pre-unlock iPhones\nNow the store (where you might be purchasing the iPod touch) sold the iPod to you and now you are the one using the defective product.\nYou can find more about it here :\nFaulty iPod touch 4G\n\nA: Regarding the freeze and the battery problem, I had thought of another possibility.\nThe iPod touch you received might be a fake (not exactly) unit. There could've been 2 iPods with the same SN, one which had been purchased before the one you purchased and the second one is yours. This will explain why your warranty started before you purchased it and why you were unable to register onto ASP. (Someone else shared the same SN with you)\n\n\n*\n\n*Try to check the free RAM of your iPod touch when no apps running in background, usually the fake units I ever used were equipped with less-quality RAM, hence made less free RAM available.\n\n*Next, try to play games and compare it to other iPods, yours would be significantly slower in terms of frame-rate.\n\n*Weak battery was usually caused by someone had used another (possibly used) lower quality battery\n\n*Yours kind of freeze are usually caused by a large app/game were installed. It's normal considering the bad RAM you had.\n\n\nThe rest of the quality might be the same, except the fact that you had received somewhat weaker iPod. I really recommends you ask for refund ASAP then wait for iPod touch 5th gen to be released.\n", "Q: Disable voiceover on login I bought a used Mac from someone who was using VoiceOver on the login screen.\nI don't have any handicap, and I would like to disable VoiceOver, which I personally find annoying.\nStrangely, VoiceOver is ONLY on the login screen, and I can't find an option to disable it anywhere on the computer. Also VoiceOver seems to come along with some sort of highlighting and on screen text.\nAny help?

They can be dummy entries, but I just need to create an address book with > 2000 entries. An Automator script is what I have in mind, but I'm not sure how to go about this.\nI apologize if this is in the wrong place. Was considering SU or SE, but figured I'd start here.\n\nA: I have used Rob's code in shorter form to create an Automator Service that lets you right-click on an email and create a contact:\n\nThanks very much Rob - you've saved me hours and hours of work :-)\n\nA: An Applescript can bulk-create OS X address book entries, which you can then import to your iPhone.

If you need other fields (like phone numbers), ask and I can show you how.\nImproved version\nI went a bit overboard and made a version that comes up with nicer names. I took the 20 most popular male and female names, 40 most popular last names, and added a middle initial, so you get a pretty low chance of duplicates (a bit under 5% in a set of 2000, by my math) without the goofy looking numbered contacts.\nIt also adds all the contacts to a group (\"Test Group\") so you can pick out all the dummy ones easily if you're adding to an existing address book and want to clean it up later.\nEdit: I also changed it to prompt for how many items to create, so it's not necessary to edit the code.\n-- name lists: 20 most popular (US) male and female first names, 40 most popular last names\nset firstNameList to {\"Mary\", \"Patricia\", \"Linda\", \"Barbara\", \"Elizabeth\", \"Jennifer\", \"Maria\", \"Susan\", \"Margaret\", \"Dorothy\", \"Lisa\", \"Nancy\", \"Karen\", \"Betty\", \"Helen\", \"Sandra\", \"Donna\", \"Carol\", \"Ruth\", \"Sharon\", \"James\", \"John\", \"Robert\", \"Michael\", \"William\", \"David\", \"Richard\", \"Charles\", \"Joseph\", \"Thomas\", \"Christopher\", \"Daniel\", \"Paul\", \"Mark\", \"Donald\", \"George\", \"Kenneth\", \"Steven\", \"Edward\", \"Brian\"}\nset lastNameList to {\"Smith\", \"Johnson\", \"Williams\", \"Jones\", \"Brown\", \"Davis\", \"Miller\", \"Wilson\", \"Moore\", \"Taylor\", \"Anderson\", \"Thomas\", \"Jackson\", \"White\", \"Harris\", \"Martin\", \"Thompson\", \"Garcia\", \"Martinez\", \"Robinson\", \"Clark\", \"Rodriguez\", \"Lewis\", \"Lee\", \"Walker\", \"Hall\", \"Allen\", \"Young\", \"Hernandez\", \"King\", \"Wright\", \"Lopez\", \"Hill\", \"Scott\", \"Green\", \"Adams\", \"Baker\", \"Gonzalez\", \"Nelson\", \"Carter\"}\nset initialList to \"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\"\nset counter to \"1\" as integer\n\n-- prompt for how many contacts to create\nset dialogText to \"Number of contacts to create?\"\nrepeat\n    display dialog dialogText default answer \"\"\n    set numberOfEntries to text returned of result\n    try\n        if numberOfEntries = \"\" then error\n        set numberOfEntries to numberOfEntries as number\n        exit repeat\n    on error\n\n    end try\nend repeat\n\n-- populate the address book\ntell application \"Address Book\"\n    set theGroup to make new group with properties {name:\"Test Group\"}\n    repeat numberOfEntries times\n        set firstName to some item of firstNameList\n        set lastName to some item of lastNameList\n        set middleInitial to some item of initialList & \".\"\n        set thePerson to make new person with properties {first name:firstName, middle name:middleInitial, last name:lastName}\n        make new email at end of emails of thePerson with properties {label:\"Work\", value:firstName & middleInitial & lastName & \"@example.com\"}\n        make new address at end of addresses of thePerson with properties {label:\"Home\", city:\"Fakeville\", street:(counter as string) & \" Some St.\"}\n        add thePerson to theGroup\n        set counter to counter + 1\n    end repeat\n    save\nend tell\n\nHere's what it generates:\n\n", "Q: Any way to get the \"Open With...\" list via AppleScript?

I have a HP Officejet 7210 printer/scanner. I used to use Preview to scan, using File/Import from scanner. However, since upgrading to Mountain Lion, the option is greyed out.\nPreviously, the option had a sub menu where I had to select 'Include Networked Devices'. Afterwards, the printer, which is connected via Ethernet, showed up and I could scan. Now, there is no submenu anymore.\nImage Capture also says no scanners are connected, and going through printers/scanners in preferences and clicking 'open scanner' shows a dialog with the 'scan' button greyed out.\nDoes anyone know how I can make HP Officejet 7210 scanning work again, either with Preview, or with some other software?\n\nA: Suddenly, the printer now appears directly in the menu of Preview. I have no idea what changed. So the takeaway is that 'Include Networked Devices' doesn't exist anymore and is always on.

I use Clean My Mac to periodically clean out old log files and caches. Right before the clean, it asks me permission and I have to enter my password to authenticate. Is there any way I can authorize the app once and skip this step every time?\n\nA: No, it's asking for authentication not because the app needs it but because it's altering system files and OS X will always need authentication for this.\n\nA: The answer will depend on how the application requests authorization.\nAuthorization Services\nIf the application is well designed, the request will be through Authorization Services provided by macOS. In this case, you need to determine which authorisation right or rights are being requested by the application.\nA well designed Mac application will define their own unique rights. A reasonably well designed application will use an existing right defined by Apple.\nOnce you know the rights involved, you can modify the security policy database to lessen or even remove the authorisation restrictions. The database is modified with the security command line tool included with macOS; see the authorizationdb flag for making changes to the authorisation policy database.\nAll this is not recommended because you are actively reducing the security of your computer.\nAs an aside, Authorization Services are not available to applications sold in the Mac App Store or sandboxed applications.\n\nA: I don’t think there is a way to completely authorise the “Clean My Mac” application. The reason why it asks you to confirm your password is that you are authorising the app and to make sure it doesn’t starts by itself. Trust me, even I feel frustrated because of this, but in a whole, asking of permission is a better way.\n\nA: you can find the binary in the application folder, according to view package content, and to run the binary in sudo mode\n", "Q: MBP retina + Dell u3011 via HDMI: intermittent screen message about audio I have a new Mac Book Pro (MBP) retina connected via HDMI to a Dell U3011 display.  Every few seconds, but irregularly, the display pops up \"MESSAGE Unsupported audio format. Please set the audio output on your audio player to Pulse-code Modulation (PCM) if available\"  \nThe message is dead center on the screen and lasts much too long.  This is highly disruptive and makes it almost not worth it to use the screen.\nI would like to find any way at all to turn off the message, either on the Mac side, the Dell side, or both.  I do not need to pipe audio from the Mac to the Dell or vice versa.  I'd be happy with a way to turn off ALL messages if it will get rid of this one.\nHere is what I have tried.  In the Mac's System Settings, I found Sound, the Dell shows up as one of the audio devices, but all settings are grayed out on it.  \nI have muted the sound on the mac via the function key F10.\nI've been to the Apple support forums and not found a solution.  I also left a message there. \nI've been through the Dell manuals online for the U3011 and not found any way to configure the HDMI in port to turn off audio, and not found any way to turn off the messages. \nI've been through all the on-board menus of the Dell, including the sound menu.  The only option in that menu seems to be 2.0 versus 5.1.  I didn't see a way to turn off sound input, and I didn't see a way to turn off messages.\nIt could be I've just missed the appropriate documentation or menu item, but I spent considerable time looking without success and thought I'd consult the sages at \"AskDifferent.\"\nEDIT: I'm pretty sure the message comes from the Dell firmware and not from the mac because it looks just like all the other messages from the Dell: it's in a non-Mac font, it's at a different resolution, there's no anti-aliasing of the font, etc.  \n\nA: Verified that this device http://www.monoprice.com/products/product.asp?c_id=104&cp_id=10428&cs_id=1042802&p_id=8119&seq=1&format=2 fixes the problem EDIT: using displayPort between the adapter and the screen)!\n", "Q: Public Wifi spot + \"Not trusted\" = Danger? Occasionally, when trying to connect to open Wifi spots (unknown to me)...\n\n... my iPhone gives me a warning about the server identity...\n\n... and shows a dialog that looks like a certificate confirmation to me.\n\nNeedless to say I cancelled the operation, and made a mental note to ask you, dear reader:\nAm I in danger? What is happening here? And why does it say www.apple.com in the second screen?\n\nA: This is happening usually because the router itself is doing some sort of proxy or authentication. You would usually see something like this in a public area where you need to 'log in' to get access. \niOS (and I think the Mac too) goes to look for a known file on one of Apple's servers. If that file doesn't exist (which basically means it can't reach it), it knows there must be some go-between first. It then will display this sheet, usually asking you to log in or accept the terms. \nIf the location is legitimate, I usually have no issue doing this. For example, businesses or restaurants that advertise free wifi service. I know the place I see this the most is at a grocery store I frequent. You must first click 'agree' on a form before moving on.\nAlso, the reason the cert is invalid is because until you 'authenticate', that router usually tries to forward all requests to its internal page. So, if you had an HTTPS connection open on apple.com, the device complains because apple.com is now resolving to that local router.\n", "Q: How to install and override Vim in Mountain Lion for +ruby +python support?

I'm trying to configure a lab of OS X workstations to print to a Ricoh Aficio MP C5000.  The Aficio is configured to require user authentication (a 4-digit passcode) in order to print.\nIn Mac OS X System Preferences, I've created a printer (LPD connection to the Aficio's IP address).  When I print to it, OS X thinks the print job has completed successfully.\nThe job shows up on the Aficio, but immediately has status \"Cancelled\", with the error log message \"You do not have a privilege to use this function.  This job has been cancelled\".\nHow can I tell OS X to authenticate before sending the print job?  (I don't see any field for entering the passcode in the OS X printer settings.)\nI've already tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Setting the \"User ID\" under \"Job Log\" in the Mac print dialog.\n\n*Setting the \"User Code\" under \"Job Log\" in the Mac print dialog.\n\n*Setting it up as a Windows printer but OS X is unable to connect to the Aficio using this protocol.\n\n*Using the Gutenprint driver but that makes no difference.\n\n*Using IPP instead of LPD, but that makes no difference.\n\n*All of the above on both Lion and Mountain Lion; neither works.\n\n\nA: User codes are setup via either WIM (using the machines IP address in a browser on same network) or on the device itself it is called User code Authentication.\nNow you can assign a prompt for a suer code on all services (Aside from printing as this is handled by pacing the code into the 'Valid access' tab on the driver.\nOn newer models you can edit the driver to force a prompt on the driver to access the user code.\nTo enable user code auth. see the following:\nUser Tools/123 key --> System Settings --> Administrator Tools --> Next --> User Code Authentication.\nSelect User Code Auth.\nSelect the options in which you require a user code to authenticate.\nPress Ok.\nNow you need to add a user code, select the previous key.\nAddress book management --> New Program --> Add a name --> Select the Auth info. tab --> Apply a user code.\n\nA: I have the same problem.\nFrom what it looks like, it seems a problem in the driver.

I'm considering charging a bunch of my iPod Touches with a USB 3.0 PCI add-in card.\nIn my research, I've found that USB provides 5 volts per device.  \nThe differences come in charging speed. The more amperage, the faster a device charges.\nUSB provides \"Unit Loads\" of amperage for each device based on need.\nUSB 2.0 provides 100 milliamps per Unit Load, with a maximum of 5 unit loads per device.\nUSB 3.0 provides 150 milliamps per Unit Load, with a maximum of 6 unit loads per device.\nWhen a device is connected, it draws 1 Unit load until it asks for a higher amount based on need.  That means a device can draw maximum 500 milliamps (or 0.5 amps) from USB 2.0 and 900 milliamps (0.9 amps) from usb 3.0.\nThe Apple wall charger for iPhones provides 1 amp (1000 milliamps).  \nDoes that mean that an iPhone or iPod Touch plugged in to a USB 3.0 port will charge nearly as fast as one plugged in to Apple's AC plug?\n\nA: I have tested an iPhone 5, and on my system it charges from a USB 3.0 port at the same rate as a 500 mA USB 2.0 port. As you would expect, the included 1 A wall charger is about twice as fast.\n\n\nA: Actually the power delivered by USB does not really depends of the generation. Some USB 2.0 will deliver more power than others. It depends of the hardware and how the USB is powered by the motherboard. \n\nA: Apple has created something of a superset of the USB charging spec for devices with a dock connector, like the iPhone. It's compatible with USB 2, so you can plug it into any USB port or charger and draw the standard 0.5A. However with a bit of voodoo (I believe it has to do with resistors on certain pins and so forth), it can draw a 1A charge.\nHowever this doesn't mean an iPhone can draw the full power from a USB 3 port. Currently iPods and iOS devices aren't compatible with the USB 3 spec, only USB 2. So, like any other USB 2 device, they're limited to drawing 0.5A, unless the charging device speaks Apple's custom protocol. This could of course change in the future, but at the moment, that's how it is. You might be interested in these pinout details of the dock connector, which offers some insight into how the charging works.\n", "Q: Can a MacBook Air battery be replaced? I have a MacBook Air which is an awesome computer, however I am curious what my options will be when the battery finally kicks the bucket. Can it be replaced?\n\nA: Apple will replace it for $129 US (price varies by country), or you can do it yourself, following iFixit's guide. However iFixit lists a used 2010/2011 MacBook Air battery for $99 US, and if you mess up anything doing the repair, it won't be covered under warranty. If I were you, I'd spend the extra $30 and have Apple do it.\nIt's also worth noting that Apple has improved battery durability considerably over the past few years (I think ever since they went with the \"non-removeable\" batteries). From Apple.com:\n\nThe built-in battery of your MacBook Pro or MacBook Air is designed to deliver up to 1000 full charge and discharge cycles before it reaches 80 percent of its original capacity.\n\nOne \"cycle\" is a full discharge and recharge - so going from 100% to 0%. Or Going 100% to 50% twice.\nFor comparison, the older batteries (and to my knowledge, most non-Apple batteries) were rated for 300 cycles. In my experience, the first 300 cycles on my MacBook Pro took about 2 to 3 years of pretty heavy use (you can keep track in the System Information app, under the Power section). 1000 cycles should last the usable life of an Air, unless you're in the 99th percentile of hard use.\n", "Q: Locked iPod Touch, any options besides total system wipe My 2 year old daughter goofed with my son's iPod Touch and locked it out. The message says that he can try again in 22,566,234 minutes, which is a heck of a long time.\nHe is 8, and has lots of photos that he hasn't backed up. We went to the Apple Genius Bar, they said a total wipe was the only option, which caused him to cry for a long time.\nAnyone on here have any other suggestions as to how he can recover his photos and stop being mad at his sister. Or is this a life lesson for him?\n\nA: The easiest way to retrieve pictures from a disabled iPod/iPhone is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new folder on your PC/Laptop called \"Retrieved Pictures\".\n\n*Connect your iPod/iPhone to your PC/Laptop via USB.\n\n*Open \"My Computer\".\n\n*Under \"Devices\" locate your iPod/iPhone.\n\n*Open the iPod/iPhone folder and locate a sub-folder called \"DCIM\". \n\n*In the \"DCIM\" folder you will find all of your pictures.\n\n*Cut all of the pictures out of the \"DCIM\" folder and paste them in to the \"Retrieved Pictures\" folder you created earlier.\n\n*Having retrieved all of your pictures, you can now restore your iPod/iPhone back to factory settings using iTunes.\n\n\nA: Not sure it'll work without unlocking the phone, but there are apps that can pull photos and music back off an iPod, eg. Phone To Mac (http://www.macroplant.com/downloads.php), or iExporer by the same company. Might be worth downloading the demo then testing.\n\nA: Download Diskaid 5. I had the same thing happen to me, but I was able to recover my Photos with it. Report back if it works.\n\nA: I hope the genius explained your options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect the device to the computer that last synced it - you can reset the timer with a sync / backup operation\n\n*Wipe and start over\n\n\nBoth of these show how important a backup is. If the computer crashes, you'll need a backup to get past the passcode (since the backup is either in the cloud with an Apple ID password controlling it or on a computer which you control outside the PIN code used to lock the device). It also allows you the freedom to wipe the device to regain control of it now and then later, restore from the backup.\nThe life lesson is important whether you and your son can get past the passcode lock or not.\nTo get past the passcode lock, there are forensic tools to try and crack backups or image the device - but most new iOS devices have data protection and connecting it to a computer will just yield scrambled / encrypted files - and until you present the proper decryption key (which is stored in the keychain behind the PIN code) - physical access to the device won't yield the pictures in a usable form.\n\nA: This happened to my daughter. \nConnect the iPod to your Mac, open iPhoto, import the pictures. \nThen restore the iPod.\n", "Q: Changing desktop background in OS X 10.8 only changes it for the current desktop space I'm experiencing  a bug in Mountain Lion. I have 2 desktop spaces open. When I change the desktop background picture, it only changes for one of the spaces and not the other. Rebooting solved the problem.\nIs this a bug? If so what is causing it? Is there any way to change the behaviour?\n\n\nA: Seems like if you set the first desktop to the picture you want and then go to each space and right click on the desktop and select \"Change Desktop Background\" it changes that desktop's background to the background of Desktop 1.\nYMMV: This in  10.8.1, pretty sure it wasn't like that before (in 10.8).\n\nA: *\n\n*Go to Mission Control and remove all Spaces but the Main Space (which is the leftmost space) by clicking the \"X\" buttons at their upper left corners.  \n\n*Click the Main Space to enter it and chose the desired desktop background.\n\n*Go to Mission Control again and add the desired amount of spaces by repeatedly moving the mouse pointer to the upper right corner of the screen and clicking the \"+\" Button that will emerge.  \n\n*Voilà: every new space will have the same background.\n\n\nA: As Alex pointed out. I falsely assumed workspaces was the same as in 10.6 where all workspaces backgrounds change simultaniously. This is not the case in 10.8. Meaning my bug is not a bug, it's a feature.\n\nA: It's an annoying issue but I found a decent solution.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open up the system preferences pane and choose Desktops&Screensavers.\n\n*Choose your background of choice for the current Space that the preference pane is open in.  Only the background in this space will change.\n\n*Activate Mission Control and drag the system settings preference pane to your next Space that you'd like to change.\n\n*Click on a picture within the Desktops&Screensavers pane that you'd like for this background and it'll change for this current Space.\n\n*Repeat the Mission Control and dragging the preference pane as necessary for other Spaces.\n\n\nA: If you want to do it in a more automated way try the Applescript below.\nIt needs a bit of manual setup, you have to put in the number of spaces and if you changed the default hotkeys for first and next desktop.\n-- Adapted from http://movingparts.net/2012/09/25/changing-backgroundwallpaper-on-os-x-with-multiple-spaces-and-multiple-monitors/\n\n-- pick a new background image\nset theFile to choose file\n\n-- *Note*: Set the number of spaces/desktops manually\nset numSpaces to 12\n\n-- Loop through the spaces/desktops, setting each of their backgrounds in turn:\n-- *Note*: Set your keyboard shortcut for desktop 1 if it’s different\ntell application \"System Events\" to key code 18 using {control down} -- ⌃1\nrepeat (numSpaces) times\n\n    -- Now loop through each monitor (confusingly called desktop) and change its background\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        set monitors to a reference to every desktop\n        set numMonitors to count (monitors)\n        log numMonitors\n        repeat with monitorIndex from 1 to numMonitors by 1\n            set picture of item monitorIndex of the monitors to theFile\n        end repeat\n    end tell\n\n    delay 0.2\n\n    -- switch to the next desktop\n    -- *Note:* Set your keyboard shortcut for \"next desktop\" if it’s different\n    tell application \"System Events\" to key code 124 using {control down} -- ⌃→\n    delay 0.2\nend repeat\n\n\nA: This simple shell script can change the backgrounds on all spaces:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nif [ -z $1 ]; then\n  echo \"Usage $0 [filename]\"\n  exit 1\nfi\n\necho \"UPDATE data SET value='$1';\" | sqlite3 ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Dock/desktoppicture.db\nkillall Dock\n\n\nA: Open up System Preferences.

Things in my iMac are failing, most notably the hard drive. I can only reliably boot to the Recovery Partition. Booting to the regular system, either normally or in Safe Mode, does not work, and causes the machine to power off midway through boot. \nThis computer is most likely fubarred. Is it possible to initiate a backup through the Recovery console? I'd prefer to get a Time Machine update, but I'll take whatever backup I can get.\nI am running the latest version of Lion (OS X 10.7). \n\nA: Unfortunately you cannot backup the Mac through the recovery partition. However starting the Mac in Target disk mode or booting the Mac from a bootable external drive may allow you to mount the iMac's drive and copy files from it. \n\nA: The Recovery Partition includes Disk Utility, which you can use to clone your hard drive to a new drive. However it's worth noting that if your disk doesn't reliably boot, at least some of the files on it are corrupt (at best), or the mechanism is damaged, and you may be causing further damage by trying to do a heavy read operation.\n\nA: You can clone the volume in Terminal with the rsync command (replacing \"Macintosh HD\" and \"Backup\" with the actual volume names):\ndev=$(hdik -drivekey system-image=yes -nomount ram://1024)\nnewfs_hfs $dev\nmount -t hfs -o union -o nobrowse $dev /private/tmp\n/Volumes/\"Macintosh HD\"/usr/bin/rsync -axE /Volumes/\"Macintosh HD\"/ /Volumes/\"Backup\"\n\nNote: it's very important that the source path ends in \"/\", and the destination path not end in \"/\".\nNote: this could be optimized a bit by excluding irrelevant things like /private//var/vm, but since you'll be typing it by hand it probably best to keep it simple.  Also, @CanuckSkier's warnings about corrupt files and disk damage apply here too.\nEDIT: after testing, found that I need to create a ramdisk on /private/tmp so it can store its metadata files. I added steps to the procedure above.\nEDIT: fixed typo\n", "Q: iPod Touch won't play music or videos I have a 2nd generation iPod Touch and I can't get it to play any media files. Everything else seems to be working fine on it, it just can't play music or videos.\nFor instance, when I tap a song in the music app, I see the \"Now Playing\" view for about 1 second before it goes back to the list. It's as if the song started and ended in .01 seconds. But no music ever starts. Whether I have earphones plugged in or not, nothing plays.\nWhen I trying to play YouTube videos or iTunes Store song previews, I get errors like \"This movie could not be played\" and \"Could not play preview\".\nSo far I've tried a hard restart, resetting all settings, erasing all content and settings, restoring in iTunes (EDIT: w/o restoring from backup), restoring using DFU mode. None of these things have worked. I would appreciate any other suggestions. Thanks!\n\nA: When you restored the iPod did you then put the backup onto it restoring it back to how it was before? If so restore it again and set up as new. Past doing this you're out of options and it would point towards a hardware fault.\n\nA: You definitely have a problem with the Audio chip on the iPod touch. iOS devices use a separate chip for decoding audio files, so that the processor can be put to sleep. The chip can probably decode all supported formats, but it may be optimised for mp3 and m4a. If the audio chip is dead, nothing will work. Movies won’t play because the iPod decodes only the video part (which has a dedicated chip on and after A5) and not the audio.\nThis answer is just based on a few facts, rumours, deductions and reasoning, and may not be the real problem in your iPod. I think it’s best to wait until mid-September, when a new iPod touch is rumoured to be released, and buy the new one.\n\nA: I have two ideas:\n\n\n*\n\n*I had a similar problem with ogm files. Some files play fine on a Mac - but the ipod has very limited support on formats. Only mp3, mp4, aac - if I'm correct. iTunes can do the conversion for you in only a few cases. \nSo what format is your music?\n\n*if your music is on an external drive, or has some strange access attributes it could be that iTunes can not read it. Where is it located?\n", "Q: Web sharing : Images won't load - 403 Forbidden I've recently \"activated\" the web sharing in OSX 1.8 « Mountain Lion ». It works well with PHP & HTML. But I stuck with 403 errors with images (jpg, png). \nDo you have any idea why ?\nThx\n\nA: So as I said in the comments above, the problem was that only the owner of the file did have the rights to read the file. \nA simple chmod +r on the file solved my problem. \n\nA: Have a look at /var/log/apache2/error_log and try to identify your problem.

I am currently running OSX Lion on my Mac and I do a lot of Rails development.\nI am wondering if upgrading my system to OSX Mountain Lion is going to really mess up my Rails/Ruby work. I run Ruby off of RVM.\n\nA: I'm not sure about Ruby or Rails development specifically, but here's some things I had to do after upgrading to 10.8. See also this question and this blog post.\n\n\n*\n\n*I had to install the command line tools package from Xcode's preferences.

Will I be able to set password 'xyz'? \nFrom then on, when I return to iTunes 1 will the backup password on that iTunes be 'abc' or 'xyz'?\n\nA: You can sync (and backup) your iDevice with one computer only, so the problem of assigning different passwords doesn't come up at all. \n", "Q: How to install homebrew on Lion I tried install homebrew on my Lion, and got this\nremote: Counting objects: 77394, done.\nremote: Compressing objects: 100% (37271/37271), done.\nremote: Total 77394 (delta 52745), reused 61413 (delta 39308)\nReceiving objects: 100% (77394/77394), 10.96 MiB | 1.87 MiB/s, done.\nResolving deltas: 100% (52745/52745), done.\nFrom https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew\n * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD\nerror: Untracked working tree file '.gitignore' would be overwritten by merge.\nFailed during: git pull origin master\n\nWhat is this?

I need to either: restore a deleted iOS Safari history; or,\nfind the date/time that the Safari history file was cleared.  Can anyone direct me to simple directions to do either/both of these tasks?\n\nA: There isn't a simple way to do this since the system doesn't record an audit log of changes to safari that would allow you to easily detect the when and more importantly the what changed from moment to moment.\nTheoretically, the file system would have a last modified date (that can easily be changed) to indicate the last time the file was saved - but you would either need some forensics skills to build up a history and a snapshot of the filesystem going back in time - like Time Machine might provide you.\nSince Time Machine doesn't exist on iOS - your best bet is to restore the entire phone from your backups and test to see if the history is correct. This is similar to building a new house because you want a new cabinet drawer in one bathroom, but there just isn't an interface (at least built by Apple) to automate what you ask.\n\nA: I don't think this can be done.\n", "Q: Microsoft true type fonts on mac How do I install the mainstream Microsoft Hebrew true-type fonts (David, Arial, Times New Roman Hebrew) in Mac?

Are there some way\n\nA: Syncing to the home PC iTunes would lead to the iPad data(Music and books from work) getting backed up to the iTunes and you can keep both the data. And again when you attach it to the work PC iTunes, the backup of the iPad(games from home) would get backed up.

Please update billing info. there is also a message like:\n\nAmount you owe is 1.88 USD\n\nThanks!\n\nA: You may have overdrawn/gone into your overdraft. If your card does not have an overdraft facility, be careful, the amount of money you overdrew can get charged horrifically (at least it does here in the UK). \nNot sure what Apple policies are or the time they allow to fully pay if off if they haven't collected the full money though. \nHope this helps!\n\nA: (There are answers from my comments in this post)\nWhat you have suggested is that Apple has undercharged you for an app. This is highly unlikely, so the money would have had to come from somewhere.\n\n\n*\n\n*The most likely place for this to come from would be from your iTunes\ncredit, which is received by redeeming iTunes gift cards, to your\naccount.\n\n*You can find this number in the top right of the 'iTunes store' tab, by your username.\n(EDIT)\n\nIn my purchase history, there is a message says We were unable to authorize your payment card for this purchase.

The rMBP is on Mountain Lion with all possible updates. When I open the lid I can see the login screen just fine but it is unresponsive for several seconds, can't enter my password or move the cursor.  Sometimes it makes the 'pop' system sound like it's getting a new mail or something several times in immediate succession, like pop-pop-pop-pop, just after opening the lid. Now this might make you think it might be related to power nap but this is happening before power nap came along. If I remember correctly, this happened before I installed Mt. Lion too. \nAnother very clear symptom is whenever I log back in from sleep and had the problem just described, the RAM in activity monitor is always clear. All green. \nIt is almost faster to cold boot it. Any ideas?  \n\nA: I actually experienced this on my '12 MacBook air as well and it was driving me crazy so I think I've figured it out without having to buy any apps like smartsleep, etc.\nSo first off you need to look at how the Mac operates with its settings.  The pmset command from Terminal shows and controls the settings. Don't change anything until you read the man page.  Enter pmset -g in Terminal to see your current settings.\npmset -g | grep hibernate mode\nhibernatemode     3\npmset -g | grep standby\nstandbydelay      4200\nstandby             1\n\nThose are the defaults and you should read the full details on Apple's Man Page.\nBut basically what that means is after 4200s (70min) of regular sleep (\"standby\" on Windows), it goes into deep sleep (\"hibernate\" on Windows).  From testing, wake from deep sleep takes about 3-4 seconds or up to 10 seconds depending on what you had open (all SSD times of course).\nNow you can increase this time which means it remains in standby (aka memory is still powered).  I have mine set to 42000s (700min) so that it covers most of my inactive scenarios (sleep, travel etc) and only hibernates on an errant weekend or two where I don't turn my computer on.  Mac OS still creates the hibernate file anyways so you don't risk losing data.  I have yet to test its affect on battery drain but maybe someone here can do that.\nTo set the standbydelay to 42000 seconds (11.66 hours), in your Terminal, type:\nsudo pmset -a standbydelay 42000\nand enter your password.\nNow if you'd rather have it based on battery percentage there's a neat loophole.  You see Power Nap basically also means that you have to keep standby active as obviously waking from Hibernate is inefficient.  So when you check Power Nap on battery you are essentially keeping the computer on Standby until you hit 30% and then it will hibernate.  This is because Apple set up Power Nap to do this so you can use this mechanism as well.\nI've tried both and now my computer wakes quickly all the time.\n\nA: Okay, I found a helpful link somewhere on Macrumors or here on Ask Different, can't really remember. Basically this is due to an added hibernate mode for new MacBooks to enable the '30 days standby time' that apple promises. \nThese machines go into a deep sleep or hibernate mode after about an hour of sleeping which writes your RAM contents to your SSD and switches off your RAM and other things so even more power is saved. So when you wake your computer up from this deep sleep, it takes about 5 seconds for the machine to read the previous RAM contents from the SSD. \nThis isn't the best solution according to me since I'd be waking up my machine far more times after an hour but would probably never need it to sleep for 30 days (or even 3 days :P). IMO this should be done as a precautionary measure only, when the battery is low and the computer will self shut down. This article, from Macworld explains in a bit more detail and also tells you how to change this behaviour. http://www.macworld.com/article/1053471/sleepmode.html\nI've also found an app that I'm going to buy for this purpose, it's called Smartsleep. This one gives me the flexibility that I need. It will let me specify a specific level of battery at which hibernation will automatically kick in. Levels above that and the computer will just sleep, and wake in less than a second every time. \n\nA: I also was confused about this and found help about the topic.\nBasically disable sleep by\nsudo pmset -a standby 0 ~stops sleepsmode/hibernation\nor Delay it using\nsudo pmset -a standbydelay 7200 ~delays it to 7200 seconds or 2 hours\nCheck this for more info Disable Stand By Mode on Retina MacBook Pro?\n", "Q: How to spot the cause of a Kernel Panic in the problem report?

92821232282\n\nCould it be a problem with Airport ?\n\nA: This is a cascading failure. The ReportCrash process is listed as the problem, and it is highly likely a different process started the issue but the backtrace is corrupted. \nThis would likely need someone with full access to the system to step through the log as detailed in this KB:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/library/content/technotes/tn2063/_index.html\nWithout seeing a few of your crashes (assuming you have several), I would reason that the unload is irrelevant since your system was up 38 minutes and the kext unload happened at 1 minute 32 seconds after boot - so the system ran for 36 minutes after the kernel extension was unloaded. \nSince this is a page fault crash, report crash was reading data from a null pointer and this will be hard to diagnose after the fact since the real culprit wasn't located by the log file dump of the panic. You'd need to disassemble the libraries or have a second Mac to symbolicate the kernel and many of the objects to know what happened. Unless you have this exact panic about 5 more times and/or can make it happen at will - digging deeper is going to be very costly and time consuming and exceptionally low chance of success.\n", "Q: Does Time Machine change file permissions while doing a backup? I use Time Machine to make backups of my computer. Now I would like to mirror the complete backup to a remote machine for added security.\nHere's my rsync command:\nrsync -azvH --progress --partial --delete -e ssh /Volumes/2tb/Backups.backupdb/ user@remote:/backup\n\nI use -a to preserve timestamp, -z for compression, -v to get verbose output, -H to preserve hard links (essential to copy Time Machine backup), --progress to see what's happening, --partial keeps partially transferred files, --delete removes files on remote that are deleted locally.\nWhen I run this, I get a lot of file permission errors. Apparently, I'm not allowed to access a lot of files in my Time Machine backup. This is not only for files in /private, but also files in /usr/ which should have read permissions.\n\n\n*\n\n*Does Time Machine change file permissions while doing a backup?\n\n*How can I use rsync to mirror my complete Time Machine backup without using sudo?\n\n\nA: This site is devoted to answering questions about Apple Products, but it's aimed more towards comsumers than power users. That doesen't mean your question is \"wrong\" in any way or you should remove it, but I strongly reccomend to ask it at the Super User Stackexchange site, which is devoted to power users like you. I think you might find there someone who can answer your question much sooner than here.\n", "Q: MacBook Cannot Boot Up - Grey Screen My MacBook won't boot past the grey screen (white unibody MacBook 15\", Intel-based, dual core).\nI installed an illegal copy of Snow Leopard onto my Mac (as legal copies were not available in my country at the time).\nIt doesn't boot up anymore, but sometimes when I hold down the option key it boots.\nI've installed linux mint onto it, and it works – or rather it worked fine.  More often than not it doesn't even boot into target disk mode (no hard drives appear nor the Mac installation disk).\nMore often than not it doesn't boot the os installed or reads the installation disks. Its just a blank grey screen. No icon or anything.\nHowever on the rare occasion that it does boot as it should in target disk mode, hard disk appears and if an installation disk is inserted, it is read perfectly and after selecting one of the targets, it boots fine. Problem is, this normal boot only occurs like 1 out of 30 attempts.\nI have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Resetting the SMC - can perform\n\n*Resetting the NVRAM and PRAM - can perform\n\n*Boot into safe mode - cannot perform\n\n*Boot into verbose mode - cannot perform\n\n*Removing the battery and holding the power down for a minute\n\n\nA: The simple answer is it sounds like your operating system is totally fried. You will need to do a full erase (zero out all data and not the quick erase drive option) of your hard drive. Reinstall a legal copy of Mac OS X. This is absolutely key. It's just plain out not smart to install anything illegal. It is so easy to add key logging or any other type of malicious software into illegal copies of operating systems. Furthermore, they could easily install stuff that could grab personal data such as passwords, bank account information, or use your computer as a zombie to hide illegal activity. You could get easily screwed. Do you want that? I don't think so. Who would? Just buck up the cost and get a legal copy of OS X. It's worth every dollar and the peace of mind. \nIf you can't afford Mac OS X install a stable build of Linux, but I scratch my head as to why would someone have a Mac but not run Mac OS X as their primary OS. Doesn't make sense. You might as well have a PC.\n", "Q: How to run the Apple Hardware Test in Snow Leopard on a MacBook Pro? I have a MacBook Pro with Snow Leopard.\nI have an image of the Installation Disk in a USB Hard Drive (Snow Leopard Partition). Then to boot the system and start using the Hardware Test software I did this:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*I change the Starup Disk to the 'Snow Leopard Partition'\n  \n*I restart holding down the 'D' key \n  \n\nBut it shows me a gray screen and the it start from the Snow Leopard Partition. But I can't see the Apple Hardware Test software.\nWhat am I missing here?\n\nA: If I remember correctly, in Snow Leopard the Apple Hardware test was on the second install DVD, and would only run from the DVD (unless you manage to install it on the hard drive and run it from there).\nSee also the official Apple page: Apple hardware test\n\nA: As far as I know, the Apple Hardware Test (AHT) was only able to run off of the Snow Leopard Application disc (disc two).  You will have to try the same procedure as you already have - holding D during startup - with the original disc in the drive.\n", "Q: How can I remove errant podcast entries in iTunes? I am using iTunes 10.6.3 on OS X 10.8\nOn my second generation AppleTV there are 8 podcasts showing that I have long since deleted. When I look in iTunes there is nothing there. I then created a smart playlist that would show only podcasts and it listed the 8 podcasts just as the AppleTV did. The problem is, in the smart playlist all 8 of the podcasts have exclamation points showing that iTunes does not know where the actual files are.\nSeeing that I closed iTunes and edited the library xml file to remove each of the haunting podcasts. Upon opening iTunes the same entries show up again. It appears that the itl library file keeps adding them back to the xml file. Is there anyway I can remove these entries from the itl file directly? If not, how can I get these things not to show up on my AppleTV?\n\nA: In iTunes, edit the bad podcast (Right click on it and select 'Get Info'). It will give an error and say it can't find the file and ask if you want to locate it. Say Yes and point the podcast to one in your recycle bin that is already deleted. Actually, any mp3 file will work. You could also make a copy of an existing one to use. Then you will be able to delete the podcast and send the file to the recycle bin. You can then use the same file for the next errant podcast. \nIf you are deleting the podcasts from a (smart) playlist, then use Shift+Delete (on Windows) or Option+Delete (on OS X) to remove them from both the playlist and the library.\n\nA: You can Google for ways to force iTunes to recreate your library based on the hand-edited XML library.  Just make backups - it's pretty easy to quit iTunes and copy your backups back into place.\nBut, maybe try this first?  Re-subscribe to the podcastst, and then delete them again.\n", "Q: Best way to stream videos and music from my iPhone to my TV? So I got a samsung galaxy s advance and found out that it can stream stored music and videos wirelessly (via WIFI) to my TV. It is very efficient with no buffering time and full HD quality. \nI use an AppleTV for my iPhone, however the connection keeps dropping (the icon disappears), the buffering time takes ages to load a video stored in my iPhone, and the whole experience is very dissatisfying.\nIs there another way (through an App or Cydia app) that allows streaming similar to the Galaxy S ?? I have a jailbroken iPhone so I can use cydia.\nThanks\n\nA: Well, this is one of those things where there's 101 ways to do it and it's just trial and error to see which works best for you. You could try wired connections using an HDMI cable  or composite AV from your iphone to your TV, or there's a variety of aftermarket apps that may work better for you. I've detailed some ideas below:\nConnect With HDMI\nYou'll need to purchase an adaptor for this option.\n\n\n*\n\n*Plug the adapter into your device’s 30-pin iPod connector.\n\n*Plug one end of an HDMI cable into the HDMI port of the adapter, and\nthe other end into an available HDMI port on your TV.\n\n*Switch your TV to the appropriate HDMI input. For earlier models\nsuch as the iPhone 4, the original iPad, or the fourth-generation\niPod Touch, the display won’t be mirrored, but it will show photos\nand videos in supported apps once you start playing them on the\ndevice.\n\n\nConnect With Composite AV\nIf your TV doesn’t support HDMI, or if it doesn’t have an available connection, you can link your device to the set through an analog connection, using an Apple Composite AV cable.\n\n\n*\n\n*Plug the adapter into your device’s 30-pin iPod connector.\n\n*Plug the yellow video cable at the end of the adapter into an\navailable analog video port on your TV.\n\n*Plug the red and white audio cables at the end of the adapter into\nthe red and white audio ports corresponding to the yellow video\ninput on your TV.\n\n*Tune your TV to the appropriate composite video input. The display\nwon’t be mirrored, but it will show photos and videos in supported\napps once you start playing them on the device.\n\n\nConnect Wirelessly via Airplay\nApple developed a wireless technology called AirPlay specifically for streaming content from iOS devices to other devices that support it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure that your iPhone is on the same wireless network as your\nother AirPlay devices.\n\n*On your iPhone, double-tap the Home button.\n\n*Swipe the list that appears to the right, until you get to the\nvolume and AirPlay settings.\n\n*Tap the AirPlay button to bring up a list of supported AirPlay\ndevices on your network.\n\n*Tap the device to which you would like to stream. A TV icon next to\nthe device indicates that you can stream images, video, and/or\naudio, while a speaker icon indicates that you can stream only\naudio.\n\n\nConnect Wirelessly via DLNA\nIf you don't want to shell out for an AirPlay-capable device, you may be able to use DLNA instead. These days, many modern TVs support streaming from a local network (wired or wireless) via the DLNA (Digital Living Network Alliance) standard. If your TV supports DLNA (or sometimes just \"UPnP\") streaming, you can use your iPhone as a DLNA server. Just download and install a DLNA-server app--Media:connect, for example--and you're good to go.\nConnect Wirelessly with Aftermarket Apps\nYou could try iMediaShare or AirVideoEnabler as alternatives to the standard airplay functionality.\n\nA: I'm wondering if anyone else is using this. Here is a list of 14 useful DLNA Streaming Apps For iPhone.\n", "Q: Determine valid iMessage address on a Mac? On my iPhone, I can try messaging someone by tapping on a contact entry or enter a phone number or email address. If the person has iMessage enabled, the text entry field will say \"iMessage\" instead of \"text message\", and I'll know if the person can actually receive iMessage.\nOn my Mac, however, there is no way to tell. I can enter an email address, type in the test and send it, and attempt to send it. If I don't see the status as \"delivered\", I can guess maybe the other party doesn't have iMessage, but i never know, maybe the person's device is simply off line, or I can wait for a few hours to be sure.\nIs there a way to determine whether the address is valid on a Mac like I can on the iPhone?\n\nA: If it is not an e-mail address registered for the service, it will turn red.\n\nAdditionally, you will get an error message when trying to send the message.\n\n", "Q: Using crashplan to backup a time machine disk So, crashplan themselves say it can't and shouldn't be done, because of hard links and how TM works... But can't it, really?! Isn't there any way around it?\nReason I want to use CrashPlan is because it does everything else I need - except easy recovery, which TimeMachine provides.\nPS: \"Nope, it can't be done\" and a very detailed answer on why, or \"do it with rsync\" or something are both ok here.\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Do not attempt to prove crashplan wrong. Many bad things can happen.\n\n*Use the new Time Machine (since Mountain Lion) instead.\n\n*Problem solved.\n\nA: Backups are important, right? So I'd tend to take Crashplan at their word, rather than try and prove them wrong.\nHowever, if I were going to try and use Crashplan with TimeMachine, I'd look into backing up time machine to a sparse image, and then using crashplan to backup the sparse image. TimeMachine automatically backs up to a sparse image when doing backups to a network location. The sparse image itself is just directory containing basic files, these are used to provide the filesystem features, like hard links, that TimeMachine requires.\nWhatever you do, remember to test the backup and restore process before you put any faith in it.\n\nA: For backing up my Time Machine volume, I use SuperDuper!, which correctly handles hard links on folders. I already saved my Time Machine data using the backup in place of the original Time Machine disk.\nWith Mountain Lion, I plan to use the multiple Time Machine disks feature.\n", "Q: Can the iPad support multiple Regional Settings simultaneously? I need spell-checking in different languages such as English, German and Norwegian. I currently have only German spell-checking and it is quite irritating that it messes up with other languages' words. Is there some easy way of having spell-checking in multiple languages on the iPad? \nWhat about keyboards? Is it possible to have many regional settings on one iPad, easily?\n\nA: You can have multiple keyboards enabled: Settings -> General -> Keyboard -> International Keyboards. Add whichever keyboards you wish. Then, when you are typing text, hit the globe key on the keyboard to switch between the different keyboards.\nAs far as I know, you can't have multiple languages enabled at the same time for spell checking. However, you can switch between them using Settings -> International -> Language.\n", "Q: Getting a file from my non-syncing Mac to my iPad? My professor posted a reading assignment via PDF, and my iPad isn't rendering the website he set up so I can't download the PDF to iBooks.\nI have my MacBook with me, but it's not the main computer to which I sync all my devices (which is my mini at home). I can email the file to myself, but that would only work for files below 20mb, which if I need to read a whole book, would be too much to email.\nIs there another way to get the file to my iPad for reading without having to go all the way home to sync my iPad to my mini?\n\nA: Sounds like Dropbox might be your best bet with the large files. There is an app available for iPad so you can view the files on there. \n\nA: Any app that uses iTunes File Sharing (e.g. FileApp) will let you add/remove files without having to be the there-can-be-only-one syncing computer. \nYou just pop over to the Apps tab on your device in iTunes and scroll down. You'll see e.g. FileApp in the list and you can just drag your file over to the list and it will be transferred. \n", "Q: Why can't I change my desktop background? I had a nice background, a photo from the internet. It had been there for quite awhile. Then I tried to set it to a different one, another picture from the internet, by right-clicking and doing \"Set as desktop background...\", but it instead set my background to blue. And now I can't change it.\nI also tried downloading this photo (and a number of others, all jpegs) but when I tried to open them to set as background directly from the downloaded file, it just said it couldn't, because the file was damaged or had an unrecognized format. JPEG?? Now the Mac can't open JPEGS?\n\nA: Go into System Preferences->Desktop & Screen Saver. Change the desktop to one of the defaults. Then drag the image file into the window. That should fix it.\n\nA: all you have to do is go into system preferences - than desktop and screensaver - than click solid colors - and than import a photo. \nthis is because if you have recently chosen solid colors as your background, or have had one of the pre made backgrounds for apple, it will automatically default to that instead of one of your custom photos. \n", "Q: Files in ISO DIsappear When Mounted Some time ago I downloaded a QuickLook plugin that allowed me to look at the files in an ISO called Suspicious Package. I used this to inspect the contents of an ISO and it displayed this:\n\nAnd Finder says that the ISO is 428.1 MB. So the ISO definitely contains some files, but when I mount it by double-clicking on it, there's nothing in it; I get this:\n\nI went into Disk Utility and clicked \"Verify Disk\" and I get this:\n\nVerifying volume \"PROSHOW DVD\" \nChecking file system \nfsck_udf: Cannot read directory entry at offset 236: Undefined error: 0 \nfsck_udf: Directory Checking was bad! \n** Checking Hierarchy \n** Filesystem is dirty and non-repairable \nError: This disk needs to be repaired. Click Repair Disk. \n\nThe \"Repair Disk\" button is grayed out though. My question is, how do I get at the files in the ISO?\n\nA: ISO images typically contain more than one file system, the original ISO9660 file system for CD-ROMs (hence \"ISO\"), the \"Joliet\" extension to it for long filenames, and sometimes UDF or even a HFS+ file system. It's possible that one of them is corrupt, but the others are fine.\nYou could try explicitly mounting with the ISO9660 file system driver, as the UDF file system seems to be damaged. First, open a Terminal window. Attach the image without mounting:\nhdiutil attach -nomount /path/to/image.iso\n\nThis should output the name of the disk device node, e.g.:\n/dev/disk2\n\nCreate a mountpoint for the filesystem, e.g.\nmkdir /Volumes/rescue\n\nThen try mounting the device there, e.g.:\nmount_cd9660 /dev/disk2 /Volumes/rescue\n\nIf it worked, it won't output anything, but the disk should be visible in Finder. (You can \"eject\" it via Finder when you're done)\n", "Q: Why do I keep getting this error message after updating to OS X 10.8.1? After I updated to OS X 10.8.1, I keep getting this error message when I execute purge:\n\n[ERROR]    The device-file for this operating system, 'osx-12.1.0.xml', was not found. An attempt to revert to a previous revision of the OS device-file: 'osx-12.0.0.xml' has been made. Please file a Radar report with Apple, on the 'CoreProfile' component, version 'X'.\n\nIs there anything I need to do to fix the error? To what exactly is the error message referring?\n\nA: The purge command is still executing correctly, but it looks like Apple forgot to update the file and it's kicking this error back.\nThe best temporary solution is the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal\n\n*cd /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/CoreProfile.framework/Versions/A/Resources/De vices/\n\n*sudo ln -s osx-12.0.0.xml osx-12.1.0.xml\nThis will add a non destructive symbolic link that is a reference to another file; in this case you're pointing the link 12.1.0 to the previous file, 12.0.0. Since this is only a link, if an update does roll out with this file it will just overwrite the link.\nThis is the best temp fix, and I'm sure it's been submitted a few times to their bug tracker. Hopefully it gets fixed soon! There is an Apple support communities thread about the same thing here.\n\nA: That’s probably a message a developer forgot to delete, as only registered Apple developers can file radar reports.

The program Calendar.app clearly has some preferences that are settable.\n\nHowever, when I type defaults read com.apple.Calendar (and various permutations on capitalization), I get the message Domain com.apple.Calendar does not exist. Additionally, I don't find a file in ~/Library/Preferences with a time stamp to match the changes I made.\nWhere does the Mountain Lion Calendar program store its preferences?\n\nA: The bundle identifier is still com.apple.iCal. You can see it from the Info.plist or with something like bid() { osascript -e \"id of app \\\"$*\\\"\"; }.\nSo the property list for the preferences is still in ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iCal.plist.

It makes NMEA GPS data available to connected clients. \nI've been thinking about buying an iPad (first one for me). Can the wifi-only iPad use this data? For the apps that I plan to use, GPS location is desirable.\nI'm trying to figure out whether I need to shell out the extra dollars for a 4G model, or purchase a Dual or Bad Elf...\n\nA: You are most likely out of luck here. Essentially, you can not install any drivers on the iPad, and the handbook states on page 69 that...\n\nDrivers are needed to use either the \"USB tethered mode\" or \"GPS over\n  Wi-Fi\" features.\n\nThis question mentions a jailbreak for iOS to use a bluetooth connection to pass GPS data into an non-3G iPad, but your hotspot does USB and WiFi only — and I personally would not advise to jailbreak for certain reasons. \nThe most promising approach to your question is this: If you do own/have access to an iPhone, you could try to tether the two via Personal Hotspot. The iPad might get the location from the phone — as described in this article. Let me know how this works.\n", "Q: Mountain Lion sleep and caffeinate command I am having an issue where my retina MacBook Pro (10.8.1) will sleep when uTorrent is actively uploading or downloading. I have tried my old go to programs like \"Caffeine\" and \"InsomniaX\" to no avail. I was about to try Jiggler, but when I am finished working at the machine for the night, I like to sleep the display (using a hot corner) and I want my display to remain off/asleep. Jiggler would wake the display every 5 minutes with the password prompt, then the display would sleep and this would repeat till the morning.  \nI have read this question and the best answer was helpful but left me wanting to know more.\nI am wondering if someone can give me a little more info on how the caffeinate command works?  For example, if I were to run the command caffeinate -i open -W -a uTorrent.app (which I assume is working because it will open uTorrent) does the caffeinate command remain active until:\n\n\n*\n\n*The terminal window is closed,\n\n*Break (control+c) is entered,\n\n*uTorrent is closed,\n\n*Until restart or log out, or\n\n*Until a 'decaffeinate' or (complimenting command) is entered in the Terminal.\n\n\nBasically if I wished to run the caffeinate command, would I have to run it every time I launched uTorrent?  \n\nA: The assertions are removed when the caffeinate process exits.\n\ncaffeinate creates assertions to alter system sleep behavior.  If no assertion flags\n  are specified, caffeinate creates an assertion to prevent idle sleep.  If a utility\n  is specified, caffeinate creates the assertions on the utility's behalf, and those\n  assertions will persist for the duration of the utility's execution. Otherwise,\n  caffeinate creates the assertions directly, and those assertions will persist until\n  caffeinate exits.\n\ncaffeinate (or caffeinate -i) prevents idle sleep until the process is terminated by for example pressing control-C or closing a shell window. caffeinate open -Wa uTorrent would also remove the assertion when open exits.\nYou can get a list of power assertions with pmset -g assertions. caffeinate or caffeinate -i should set PreventUserIdleSystemSleep to 1.\n\nTo always prevent sleep when uTorrent is open, you could add a line like this to a crontab:\n* * * * * pgrep -x uTorrent && caffeinate -t 60\n\n(Use EDITOR=nano crontab -e if you haven't changed $EDITOR and don't know how to use vi.)\n", "Q: Delete all OS X accounts in terminal when selling laptop I have an old macbook with some photos on it that I'm trying to sell.

You could (and most likely will) get some unpredictable and possibly data corrupting behaviour if the Mail app tries to access data only to find the network volume isn't mounted or accessible.\n", "Q: Which SSDs are compatible with my old Macbook Pro? I have a MacBook Pro A1260 from 2008 and I want to upgrade to the fastest SSD I can get, as long as the rest of the system isn't the I/O bottleneck.\nWhere can I find information on compatible SSDs, and how many MB/s my system can handle?\n\nA: Everymac.com is as close to a comprehensive source of system information as you'll find. In the case of your Mac, you can see it has a 1.5Gb/s SATA interface. So you won't be able to get the full potential sequential transfer speeds of a recent SSD, but keep in mind that the most noticeable benefit of an SSD comes from the random access speeds, which are less likely to be bottlenecked by the SATA interface.\nIt's also worth considering that SSD prices have come down a lot lately, so you're less likely to save much by getting an older model. I'd recommend looking at the Samsung 830 series or the Crucial m4. Both have excellent performance and good reliability.\n\nA: Supposedly almost every SSD should be compatible with your Macbook Pro. Most SATA III SSD is also backwards compatible with SATA II. Even if you won't get the full benefit of the SSD by having a SATA II interface, but it will still be way faster by traditional hard drive.\nHowever I may just be a really unlucky guy. My late 2008 Macbook freezes occasionally after I installed SanDisk Extreme SSD. After getting a replacement SSD, reinstalling OS X a few times, resetting PRAM, enabling TRIM, and so many other things; I was convinced that my laptop is not really happy with the SSD itself. It was kind of confirmed by reports by a few people.\nSo I guess the best advice I have is see if other people has problems before buying the SSD, and then if you still decided to buy it, have a plan B of what you're gonna do if it doesn't work.\n", "Q: PDF annotations: Annotating with Preview on Mac, view annotations on iPad My workflow is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open PDF on Mac using Preview\n\n*Annotate PDF using the annotate tools within Preview\n\n*Send PDF to iPad\n\n\nI would like the annotations to show up on the iPad in the native PDF viewer, but for some reason they do not! Does anyone know the reason why, and (better yet) a solution?\nNote: When I use PDFPen to do the annotations, they do show up on the iPad, which has been my workaround so far. For reasons too lengthy to discuss, I cannot do the annotations directly on the iPad.\n\nA: This seems to be an interesting problem.  I started annotating PDFs on my iPad using GoodReader.  Such annotations always show up fine in another PDF readers on other platforms.  Then, more recently I wanted to do a similar things on my MacBookPro.  At the time, I didn't realize Preview provides this feature.  The App Store provides an abundance of choices for PDF annotation programs.  I chose PDFProfessional since it only costed a few bucks.  I soon noticed it had a problem similar to the one you described.  I could see lines and scribble, but not text notes in other viewers unless I clicked and expanded the text box.  Otherwise the text box seemed empty.\nLast month PDFProessional released an update and this fixed that problem.\nIt may be be that providing annotations that show up universally is harder than it seems and Preview just hasn't reached that level yet.\n\nA: Annotations created in preview on the Mac will show up in GoodReader for iPad and vice versa.

So, if your drive has corruption where many blocks are unavailable or lost, you will see large other \"allocations\". \nIf the other space remains the same after running disk utility to verify and/or repair the volume then you can assume it's really files taking that space.\nThe categorization comes from spotlight indexing, so you could search here how to rebuild that index if you suspect bad metadata leading to an incorrect storage report. \nThe simplest way to rebuild the metadata (spotlight) index is to simply add your hard drive to the spotlight privacy list in system preferences and subsequently remove it. The built-in help should have a guide if you're not sure how to refresh all spotlight data. \n", "Q: Prevent email signature from being inserted when replying Is there a way to prevent Mail.app on OS X from auto inserting your email signature when replying to a message?\n\nA: I believe you can create a template for a new email (which would include you signature) and then leave signatures off everywhere else by setting our signature to none.\nThe template can be a draft message or a sent message. Either way you have the option of sending them again, which makes them de facto templates. \n\nA: With MacMail the only way to do this is to set the default to no signature, and then use a program like TextExpander to insert a signature for you.\nYou CAN do this in Mozilla Thunderbird however.\nGood luck\nB\n\nA: You can set the default signature or \"None\" for each mail account in Preferences -> Signatures\n\n", "Q: How to increase the amount of time the wifi waits before timing out a connection? I'm currently traveling abroad.  Sometimes when connecting to a very old or a heavily used router, the connection will timeout after 2-3 seconds.  I think some of these routers just need more time to respond to my connection request, I would like to increase the wait time to 10-12 seconds before the wifi times out the connection.\nSuch things do not appear to be configurable through the networking GUI.  I'm quite handy with the terminal but not familiar enough with networking to know where to look.\n\nA: I doubt there's anything you can do short of jailbreaking and re-flashing the code that drives the wireless chipset.\nThe things you can control are getting closer to the transmitter, potentiallly moving objects that could attenuate or reflect Wi-Fi signals or set up a repeater to sit within range of both the base station and the location where you wish to have network coverage.\n", "Q: Change installation directory of XQuartz on Mountain Lion Mountain Lion doesn't include X11 any more, and XQuartz is the substitute.

I have a router at the moment that keeps dropping Airplay connection between different iOS devices. I'm trying to find a better router that can withstand the amount of interference from various devices such as multiple iPhones, iPads, MacBooks, Windows laptops, AppleTV, and a TV.\nI know the iPad (1 and 2) and the iPhone cannot use 5 Ghz wireless signals, yet the AppleTV and retina MacBook Pro do.

Is there a notes dashboard widget that connects to iCloud ?\nThanks :)\n\nA: With the caveat that this is just one example of a notes widget, I've used Junecloud's Notefile app a bit, and it seems to fit your requirements of a widget that connects to iCloud. I can sync to iCloud or the app provider's JuneCloud sync. However, Notefile is not a free app (currently $4.99), so you'll need to look elsewhere if you want a freeware solution.\nJunecloud also provides an iOS application for mobile devices (iPad/iPhone/iPod Touch) for $2.99 at the time of this answer.\n", "Q: Mini DisplayPort and DVI cables not working? I recently bought a Mini DisplayPort to DVI and DVI/DVI cable to connect to my monitor. However, when I connect my MacBook Pro (late 2009) to the monitor it doesn't work - laptop screen flashes blue, but monitor stays idle.\nThe laptop recognises the monitor ('Displays' in System Preferences shows 2 monitors); but the monitor does not seem to recognise the laptop (it just continues to scan and eventually goes to sleep).\nSo I borrowed a set of cables from a friend to see if the cables I bought were faulty. Tried all combinations of cables and all combinations worked - except for using the two that I purchased!\nFrom testing out the combinations, I'm assuming that none of the cables are faulty.\nFrom doing some research, I believe the DVI/DVI cable I bought is a DVI-D (Dual link), whereas my friend's is a DVI-D (Single link) - though that shouldn't make a difference should it?\n\nThe cables I bought:\n\n\nThe cables I borrowed:\n\n\nCombinations tried\n.             | CableA (Female) | CableB (Female)\n--------------------------------------------------\nCableA (Male) |  does not work  |     works\n--------------------------------------------------\nCableB (Male) |      works      |     works\n\nWhere:\n\n\n*\n\n*CableA = Cables I bought\n\n*CableB = Cables I borrowed\n\n\n\nI still don't understand why the only combination that did not work was using the two cables I bought - any ideas?\nWould also like to know if there is a way to get the monitor working with the cables I bought.\n\nA: There's no reason it should work with a single-link DVI cable, but not a dual-link one. The second link is only needed for resolutions higher than 1920x1200x60Hz, and the second set of wires will otherwise be unused. In fact, a standard passive Mini Displayport -> DVI adapter can't use (or see) the second link.\nYou could check if a lower resolution works - if it does, this would indicate that the cables suffer from too much interference to carry high resolutions. This would be the case if they had cheap/bad shielding. If both your adapter and the DVI cable are very close to the minimum required shielding, it could cause problems in combination but work OK when combined with higher quality cables or used on their own.\n\nA: On my Mac Pro I use the mindisplay to DVI adapter from Apple. It has a usb (male) cable and a USB port on the DVI adapter end. I don't use the USB at the second monitor so nothing is plugged in. However, I only get a signal to my second monitor if the USB cable is plugged in!\nThe monitor has a separate power (D-plug) source, and I've tried restarting, rebooting and checking the monitor settings. The song remains the same. Unless that USB cable is plugged in, the signal doesn't appear on the second monitor.\nWC\n", "Q: Deleting home folders ~symbolic links in Mac OS X  I bought an SSD, so now I have SSD + traditional HD on my Mac. On SSD OS + Applications. On HD data.\nI wanted to keep applications and library on the SSD and move my home folder from SSD to the traditional HD. \nI used this solution of creating symbolic link on the  HD to follow my purpose. \nI opened the terminal and in my /Users/Homefolder I've typed\n sudo rm -rf examplefolder \n ln -s /Volumes/nameofHD/pathofexamplefolderontheHD\n\nSo one after one I deleted all folders on my home folder on the SSD and created symbolic links on the HD.\nThe problem for what I'm requesting Super User's help:\nOne folder, exactly the one named \"Download\" any time I reboot the system reappears. So now I have two \"Download\" folders and I'm not able to delete the one on the SSD (the original) anymore, precisely anytime I use \nsudo rm -rf examplefolder \n\nAfter rebooting it magically reappears. Sometimes using terminal it says to unlink the folder but after some time I'm able to delete it\nFor trying deleting the file I've also used this app/script called Trashit, but that didn't work either.\n\nA: That’s not the recommended way of configuring a two-disk OS X install. Steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a clean install on the SSD. Or you can just copy over the System Files. This would make steps 2 and 3 unnecessary.\n\n*Create a temporary admin account on the SSD.\n\n*Add a new account in the Users and Accounts preferences. It should match the credentials of your old account on the HDD.\n\n*Right click on the account after it has been created, then click on Advanced Options.\n\n*Set the home folder of this account as the previous home folder on your HDD.\n\n*Transfer the necessary apps, libraries, etc by using a disk cloning app or good old copy-pasting.\n\n\nThe Download folder reappears because OS X thinks that the home directory is on the SSD, not on the HDD.\nSource: http://macintoshhowto.com/hardware/how-to-speed-up-your-mac-with-a-ssd-drive.html\n", "Q: How to change the default Mail account in Mountain Lion? I have 2 mail accounts configured. When composing a new message, it will default to the account for the currently selected mailbox, which is fine. However, when no particular mailbox is selected (when viewing the combined Inbox for example), it will default to the first listed mail account.\nHow can I change the default mail account when no particular mailbox is active? IIRC, you used to be able to drag them into order, but this no longer seems to work.\nI am aware that you can specify a default mail account for all new messages, but I'd like to preserve the behavior where it will default to the account of the currently active mailbox, if one is active.\n\nA: Instead of trying to drag the account(s) into the desired order in Preferences, drag the account's mailbox to the desired order from the mailbox list in the sidebar of Mail.app main window. Open the inbox and drag the desired sub-inbox to the top. The position in the other places like the trash and drafts boxes will follow.\nThen quit Mail.app and open it again to make the changes take effect.\nWhichever account's mailbox is at the top of the list will be the default mailbox.\nIf an account mailbox is at the top, but the account is not the default, drag it down and then back up to the top. This will reset the order and establish the top one as the default.\n\nA: Mail will use the Default address unless you override it by selecting another address in the \"FROM\" drop down field when creating a new message.\n\nA: The answer's very easy.\nGo to System Preferences > Composing > Send new messages\nand choose the desired email you want to compose from and WALAH!! = )\n", "Q: Move items from old keychain to new keychain I've just done a clean Mountain Lion install, and one thing bothers me a lot:\nHow can I move passwords from my old keychain to the one created by the installer when it performed a clean install without a migration of data?\nI copied my old keychain to ~/Library/Keychains and added it to the keychains list. It works except that I have to unlock it every time I log in. It's rather annoying and I'd much rather have all my passwords and certificates in one keychain.\nI've tried to just Cmd+C/Cmd+V the passwords from old keychain to the new one, but it asks me about keychain's passwords for every item (and there are hundreds of them)\nAny ideas?\n\nA: As a workaround, you can make the password of the old keychain empty. You can do that by pressing the OK button for a second time after this error message is shown:\n\nYou can then just click the allow button repeatedly without having to type the password every time.\n\nA: Keep the two files separate to start with.\nUse \"Import Items...\" from the File Menu and select your previous Keychain file. It will attempt to import all your previous keys, asking for old passwords as necessary.\nWhen finished, all your previous data will be in the new login.keychain; your old login.keychain can be thrown away.\n", "Q: Is there a way to load a LaunchAgent as another user? From a script run as root I copy a LaunchAgent .plist to /Users/xyz/Library/LaunchAgents.\nIf I load that via launchctl logged in as user xyz it works without problems. If I try to load it from the script with the following command:\nsudo -u xyz launchctl load /Users/xyz/Library/LaunchAgents/x.y.z.plist\n\nit doesn't work. The error message is\nCould not open job overrides database at /private/var/db/launchd.db/com.apple.launchd.peruser.0/overrides.plist: 13: Permission denied  \nlaunch_msg(): Socket is not connected\n\nIs there any other way to accomplish my task?\n\nA: It looks to me like the permissions error is just a symptom of a much deeper problem: you're trying to load the item into the wrong mach bootstrap context. Specifically, you're running the launchctl command as xyz, but it's trying to load the item into root's context, which xyz doesn't have permissions to do. What you want is to load the item into xyz's context instead (which xyz should have permissions to do).\nOk, let me back up a bit, and give you a bit of a summary of the launchd hierarchy in OS X. When the OS boots, it starts a master instance of launchd (the \"system\" launchd), which loads items from the various Library/LaunchDaemons folders.\nWhen a user logs in (or otherwise starts a \"session\"), a new \"bootstrap context\" is created, a new instance of launchd (the \"user\" launchd) is started (in that new context) which loads items from the various Library/LaunchAgents folders (all within that new context).\nWhen you use sudo -u xyz ..., it switches user IDs to xyz, but doesn't switch to xyz's context.\nNow, there are a couple of cases here: first, if xyz isn't logged in (i.e. doesn't have an active session), they don't have a bootstrap context or a launchd instance, so you can't load a LaunchAgent as them. Basically, LaunchAgents load into user sessions, so if there's no session there's nothing to load it into. On the other hand, this shouldn't be a problem: next time xyz logs in, your item will be loaded automatically (as long as it's in the right place).\nIf xyz is logged in, you can get the process ID of some process within their session, and use launchctl bsexec to switch to that process's bootstrap context (and then use sudo -u xyz to switch UIDs to xyz, and then load the item):\nloadUser=xyz\nloadPID=$(ps -axj | awk \"/^$loadUser / {print \\$2;exit}\")\nlaunchctl bsexec $loadPID sudo -u $loadUser launchctl load /Users/xyz/Library/LaunchAgents/x.y.z.plist\n\n\nA: I discovered that you can do this in two steps.\nFirst sudo into root\nsudo -s\n\nThen impersonate the user\nsu -l user\n\nApparently that establishes the correct context and launchctl works.\n", "Q: How can I reset a Mac's password from Single User Mode?

Thank you.\n\nA: I kept getting the launch_msg(): Socket is not connected message, so I used cd to get to the LaunchDaemons directory and typed in\nlaunchctl load com.apple.DirectoryServices.plist \npasswd username\n\nThis worked.  Not sure why it didn't like the directory path as it had no errors.\n\nA: Try loading com.apple.opendirectoryd.plist instead.\n\n\n*\n\n*Hold command-S on startup.\n\n*Run mount -uw /. (fsck -fy is not necessary.)\n\n*In 10.7 and later, run:\n launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.opendirectoryd.plist\n\nor in 10.6 and earlier:\nlaunchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.DirectoryServices.plist\n\n\n*Run passwd username and reset the password.\n\n*Run reboot.\n\n\nA second way to reset the login password of an account is to use Reset Password.app from the recovery partition:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hold command-R on startup.\n\n*Open Terminal from the Utilities menu.\n\n*Run resetpassword, which opens the Reset Password application.\n\n*Select the volume and account and reset the password.\n\n\nA third way is to create a new admin account:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hold command-S on startup.\n\n*Run mount -uw /.\n\n*Run rm /var/db/.AppleSetupDone.\n\n*Run reboot.\n\n*Go through the steps of creating a new account.\n\n*Reset the password of the old account from the Users & Groups preference pane.\n\n\nNone of these options resets the password of the login keychain.\nIf FileVault 2 is enabled, you have to enter a password to start up in single user mode, and you can't use Reset Password.app to reset the password of an account.\n\nA: Once you mount the file system, you should be able to use passwd username and then put in the password twice. \n\nA: Hold ⌘-S on startup, then type\n/sbin/fsck -y\n/sbin/mount -uw /\nsh /etc/rc\n\npasswd [username of account you want to change here]\n\nIt should ask you to enter the new password twice.\nreboot\n\n", "Q: How can I clean up my user Library folder? Is there a way to clean up the ~/Library folder of a user? My folder is about 32 GB! What the heck is all in there?\n\nA: For Developers:\n~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData directory can become pretty large after some time of creating different projects. You can easily delete all the directories with age a week and higher.\n~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Archives same story here, but you need to be more careful with removing old archive files (especially if your projects are not under version control).\nBy my experience archive folder for an app can become really huge as developers usually create lots of versions of same app before its public releases. I believe it's better to clean this folder from XCode by going through all your old archives and removing the ones you don't need. The best scenario is that you have commented each archive during your work. On the other hand, if you didn't, most probably it won't make too much sense to keep old archives when you don't know what those are about.\nI cleaned about 300GB only from above directories (2 years those were out of my attention).\n\nA: As usual for cleanup stuff, start with a visualizer like GrandPerspective or Disk Inventory X so you can see what folders take up space.\nBe careful deleting stuff in your Library folder: apps store lots of different things in there, some of which are required for them to run.\n\nA: Your Library folder contains several things which may be quite large: all your mails (including attachments), various caches, databases of some applications (e.g. Evernote) etc., so the big size might be ok (or even desired!).\nTo identify the big stuff you can open Terminal.app and run\ncd ~/Library\ndu -sm * | sort -n\n\nwhich will show you the largest directories at the end. Use cd again to drill further done and repeat the du command.\nPS: Just for reference: My Library folder currently holds about 16 GB of Evernote data, 4 GB Developer docs from Xcode, 1 GB mail and 1.5 GB iOS software updates.\n\nA: You could also enable calculating all sizes and sort by size in list view:\n\nTo let that right window appear, use command ⌘ + J in Finder.\nYou can also reach this window by clicking on \"Show View Options\" within \"View\" in your menu bar.

I want to use Automator to extract any text in a set region of a PDF, extract all images from the PDF, place all the text in corresponding fields of an Excel spreadsheet, and then upload that spreadsheet to my website.\n\nA: Automator can extract the text from a PDF, although the action included with OS X acts on a PDF file, not the selected region thereof.  Automator likewise has an action to turn entire PDF pages into images. Automator can also call scripts or programs. Because of the extensibility of Automator, I am sure a skillful programmer could be hired to write a program (perhaps using Automator) that would do what you propose, it falls beyond the capabilities of the stock automator components.\nAutomator could create the text and image files you want, then call custom-written scripts or programs to scrape those files and put the information from those files into the spreadsheet you describe, and call another script to upload the spreadsheet to your website.\nThe specifics of how to write such a script customized to your particular formatting and uploading needs is a question localized to your unique situation, and far too localized for this site, but the answer to the more general question is:\nit's probably possible for Automator to call programs that do this, but there's no easy way to do it with built-in Automator components\n", "Q: Is it a good idea to create a \"soft link\" from iTunes Library to an external hard drive to release hard drive space? My iMac has a 1TB internal hard drive, and 300GB is allocated for Windows 7 using BootCamp.\nOf the 700GB, right now the space remaining is only about 20GB, and I do hope to create a new partition and install Mountain Lion on it (or install Lion on it and upgrade the current Lion partition to Mountain Lion).\nSince the majority of hard drive space use is:\n/Users/mike/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/iTunes U        270GB\n/Users/mike/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Movies           70GB\n\nand since Mac OS X is UNIX and can create a \"soft link\", how about creating a soft link (using the Terminal app) using:\nln -s \"/Volumes/My Passport/Movies\" \"/Users/mike/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Movies\"\n\nand the same for \"iTunes U\", so that two soft links are created, and they point to the external hard drive (\"My Passport\", which is a WD 1TB drive).\nI probably will do it by rebooting the system, move the Movies folder from the internal drive to the external drive by Finder, using drag and drop, and then create the soft link, and then do the same for \"iTunes U\", and then create the 2 soft links, and start up the iTunes app and see.  \nIs this actually a good practical solution by creating a soft link like that?  In a way it is like fooling the system to go to the external drive and can there be any side effect?\n\nA: It's a better idea to copy the iTunes Media folder to your external hard drive, then go to iTunes Preferences > Advanced tab and change the iTunes Media folder location to the one on your external disk.\nYou can also move the library file itself (in ~/Music/iTunes/ on my system), but I don't recommend doing both at the same time. There're other questions around here that go about explaining how to use a different library location.\nTo more-directly answer your question, I don't know of any downsides to using symlinks, but that's because I've never done it. I have done the approach I described here and it's generally better to avoid going behind an app's back if you can.\n\nA: I tried many techniques and the symlink is the one I prefered for my library located on a NAS. Using any of the copy techniques, with auto-mounting and the like, you will eventually run into the situation where the mount or NAS is temporarily unavailable for X reason, and iTunes will reset its media folder location. You will then have media in two locations. With the symlink, it will at least throw an error at startup.\n\nA: Or you could switch iTunes libraries at will by holding ⌥ during iTunes launch. This will give a dialog where you can select another library location, or create a new Library. I use this all the time.\n\nA: Yet another method is, I found, is that \n\n\n*\n\n*Just go to iTunes -> Preferences and the last tab and change the folder to an external drive, such as \"WD 2TB\"\n\n*Now, go to iTunes's Music or Movies and choose any file or files and right click and choose \"Consolidate File\".\n\n*The file will copy from the old location to the new location.\n\n*Follow the usual step of deleting the movie / song file from your boot drive. (the ones that you consolidated)\n\n*Empty Trash of the Recycle Bin.\n\n\nNow your system boot disk will have more space because the file has been moved over to the external drive.\nIf iTunes can even let you choose to verify the files (that are moved properly, by comparing the original and copied files), and then automatically delete the original files, it will be even more perfect.\n\nA related technique (I am using iTunes 11.0.2):\n\n\n*\n\n*If you moved any movies to the external hard drive \"WD Passport\" before, then you can right click in iTunes and choose \"Play Movie\" for the movie that was moved.  (moved by Finder's file moving mechanism, not iTunes's)\n\n*iTunes will say \"cannot find movie\", but would you like to locate it.  Answer Yes.\n\n*Now, you can type in part of the movie name, such as \"Iron\" for \"Iron Man\", and wait 1 second, and choose the search option of \"Search for Iron in Filename\", and then make sure you click the main window's \"Search this: Mac\", (as opposed to search in a particular folder), now choose the movie file, which is usually at least 1GB or larger.\n\n*iTunes will ask you, found, and would you like iTunes to search for other missing files near that location?  Answer Yes, and iTunes will automatically add files that you moved from the boot drive to the external drive.\n\n\nThat's why Apple products are usually a work of art.\n\nA: This is the usual way I'd do it on a mac. I've done it a few times and it seems to work well.  You can use the technique described by CajunLuke above, but I prefer to do it the way you've described.  It keeps the location of the actual library out of iTunes control (and knowledge) and makes it easy to move it multiple times.  It also means you can move the whole folder rather than just the media folder.\nI've also been able to keep my music on one drive and my movies on another with iTunes treating it all as the same library. I don't think iTunes can do that, but by setting up the appropriate symlinks it just works.\n", "Q: Find multi-line block using grep and/or automator with BBEdit I have an xml file output from WordPress.\nI have BBEdit as my main search tool.\nI am on a Mac running 10.7.4\nI am trying to find a muli-line block of text that starts with <item> and end with </item>\nIn the block, there must be <wp:status>publish</wp:status> and <wp:post_type>post</wp:post_type>\nDoes anyone have any idea how I would find that using GREP or Automator?\n(Sorry I don't have enough rep to make better tags)\n\nA: You can do multiline greps in TextWrangler using various pattern modifiers (i, m, s, and/or x)\ne.g. \nsearching for\n<item>(?s).*?<\\/item>\nwill match across lines. \nAfter that, you can modify your regex to be more elaborate.\n", "Q: Can two external displays be driven from one Thunderbolt port? I have the new MacBook Air which only has a Thunderbolt output (no HDMI or DVI) and I have 2 external monitors. How can I get this all hooked up (at the lowest cost, if possible)?\nEDIT:\nAfter using the DualHead2Go ME, I'm half-satisfied; it does split my single external port into 2 DVIs, but the externals act as 1 with double the width, so the resolution is very off and weird to look at. Looking back I probably should have bought the Pro to support both of my externals, but with my current Air this is the best I can do for 2 externals.\n\nA: While Apple's display adapters will let you connect one of these external monitors, there's also the Matrox DualHead2Go Digital ME which will connect two external DVI displays (I've never seen or used one, ymmv).\n\nA: The current-generation MacBook Air's integrated graphics only supports one external display. \nFurther, there are no products that I know of that are shipping (as of when I answered this) that can \"split\" a Thunderbolt signal to connect two non-Thunderbolt displays. The only way I know of to connect multiple displays to a Thunderbolt Mac via Thunderbolt is to use Apple's Thunderbolt Display.\nYou could use one of the various DisplayLink products to connect one of your displays via USB and use a plain mini DisplayPort adapter for the other display (this would connect to your Thunderbolt port).\n\nA: Zotac provides an adapter to split a regular or mini DisplayPort into two HDMI ports. It's the ZT-DP2HD (DisplayPort) or ZT-MDP2HD (mini DisplayPort). Anandtech has a brief blurb about it here. For $50, I think it's worth checking out.\n\nA: The only problem with the splitter of 1 thunderbolt to 2 display ports is that the monitors will be mirrored, they won't be extended desktop. With Mac Air I had to use the thunderbolt for monitor 1 and the usb for monitor 2 in order to have extended desktop.\nAnother annoyance is that, for example, if you have a large spreadsheet, you wont be able to see it using both monitors.\nIf you really need a full extended desktop, you will need 2 thunderbolt ports.\n\nA: If you have monitors that have DisplayPorts, you should be able to go from the MacBook Air to DisplayPort, and then DisplayPort out on one monitor to the other one.\nThis is DisplayPort 2.0 or 2.1 I think.\n\nA: Belkin Dual View Mini DisplayPort to 2X DVI Adapter Dongle (F2CD060) $60...all you need\n", "Q: How can I remove the window shadow in Mountain Lion?

Then I discovered something much simpler:\ndefaults write NSGlobalDomain NSUseLeopardWindowValues NO\ndefaults write com.apple.Safari NSUseLeopardWindowValues YES\n\nThe second one is necessary because Safari doesn't seem to like the shadows (you get a \"Invalid unbuffered shadow parameters.\" comment in syslog).\n\nA: The program I use to do this on OS X 10.8.4 is ShadowSweeper.\nhttp://download.cnet.com/ShadowSweeper/3000-2072_4-75966596.html\nThis one looks like it might also work but I haven't tried it myself.\nhttps://github.com/puffnfresh/toggle-osx-shadows\n", "Q: Songs will not sync or transfer Certain music downloads in my iTunes library appear with an \"!\" to the far left.

How can I install Lua 5.0?\n\nA: Based on my reading of Lua 5.0's makefile, I'd say:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run make echo, and note the folders INSTALL_BIN, INSTALL_INC, INSTALL_LIB, and INSTALL_MAN\n\n*For each file in bin, remove that file from INSTALL_BIN\n\n*For each file in include named *.h, remove that file from INSTALL_INC\n\n*For each file in lib named *.a, remove that file from INCLUDE_LIB\n\n*For each file in doc named *.1, remove that file from INCLUDE_MAN\n\n*Upgrade to Lua 5.2 so if you accidentally install again, you can uninstall  :-)\nAlternatively: if you download Lua 5.2 and configure it in exactly the same way (so all the INSTALL_* folders are the same), then its make uninstall will delete almost all of these for you.  You only have to delete liblualib.a from INCLUDE_LIB.\n", "Q: Is there a way to add items to notification center through terminal or other means? I'm wanting to add specific Websites to notification center (the stack exchange network, for example) and I want to be able to see various notifications that the website would send me. \nIs there a way to add a website to be checked in notification center via terminal or some sort of script that can be written?\n\nA: You can send a notification from the command line with this terminal-notifier utility. Getting the notification data off a site can be fairly involved, requires at least some decent scripting and/or web coding knowledge, and is probably a better question to pose on Stack Overflow.\nThe basic outline of such a script would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a site\n\n*Send login data if necessary\n\n*Scrape the page for the data you need (unless you're lucky and the site has a JSON or XML API, in which case you can parse that)\n\n*Send the appropriate data via the terminal-notify utility\n\n\nThis sort of thing may be more common in the future though, as Safari 6 and Mountsin Lion add support for web notifications, which will allow a site to display notifications, when Safari has an open tab for that site.\nSupport for this needs to be coded into the site however, so it's not really an end user solution I'm afraid.\n\nA: If you dont’t want to script anything, try this little menu bar application called SENotifier. I use it for all notifications related to the StackExchange network.\nAlso, it might me a good idea to first check if the website in question has a RSS feed for the notifications you want. \nIn case you want to write a scraper, first have a look at possible options regarding languages and modules.

My iPhone 4s is giving me the option to set up as new phone or restore via iTunes or iCloud. I have pictures on my previous phone that is now destroyed. I am unable to maintain a stable wireless connection.\nIs there any way I can set up as a new iPhone now and restore all my data later? Or will I lose all my data from my previous phone if I set up a new iPhone?\n\nA: The backup for the old phone will be stored in the cloud until you delete.  However, if you restore later, you will have to erase any data that you have added since then on the new phone.\n", "Q: Can I hook up a MyBook Thunderbolt Duo external drive to a late 2009 Mac with mini DisplayPort? Can I hook up a MyBook Thunderbolt Duo external drive (only has Thunderbolt ports) with a Thunderbolt cable to a late 2009 iMac (with mini DisplayPort) and use it for storage (at a slower speed) until I can buy the new iMac comes out and I use it with that? Will the data still be accessible then?\n\nA: Nope. Mini DisplayPort has a physically compatible connector to Thunderbolt, but it's a totally different technology. You can only use Thunderbolt devices with Thunderbolt equipped Macs (or PCs).\n", "Q: Can I use a Mac Mini as an Airplay audio receiver? I don't have an AppleTV (yet), but I do have a Mac Mini hooked up to some decent speakers.

All I see in attachment is a winmail.dat file (no matter my friend sends a Word or PDF file over).  This happens only after I upgraded to Mountain Lion.  Just wonder if there's some setting I need to tweak, hopefully this is not a 10.8 problem.  Thanks for any help.\n\nA: There is a free online winmail.dat reader at Winmail.dat.

So I need to buy a copy of Windows.  I guess I'm aiming at Windows 7 Home Premium or some such thing, but please tell me a better flavor if you are passionate about it.  Or would a copy of WinXP be less of a resource hog?\n-- Main Question:  Is it possible to purchase the windows copy via 100% download online, with no CDs shipped to me... I live overseas and prefer that. (I suppose I would then burn an installer CD myself to feed to VMWare?)  If yes, Please give any and all recommendations on online stores that would have a legit copy at a decent price...\n-- If it's not possible to buy windows via 100% download only, please let me know your favorite online stores to buy the physical legit versions. The only one I have learned of that didn't seem incredibly sketchy is http://www.newegg.com/\n-- Anything important to know about whether aiming for an \"OEM\" version would be smart, foolish, frugal, risky... Can they not be re-installed a second time if the computer crashes, or some other kind of risk?\n\nA: You can buy Windows 7 online from Microsoft, and they will give you a license key and a download link. You should be able to use that installer directly in Fusion, no need to burn it to a disk.\nI would recommend Windows 7 over XP - it will be supported by Microsoft and 3rd party software much longer, and has many technological advantages. You should be made aware  that Windows comes in several flavours—in addition to Home Premium, Pro, Ultimate, each of those can be purchased as an Upgrade, Full, or OEM version.\nOEM is typically the cheapest, but is intended to be installed once on a computer you build, and can't be reused. Technically it's not meant for VMs, but in practice you shouldn't run into issues with it. However it can only be purchased as a physical copy, not downloaded. You want to stay away from Upgrade versions, which are cheaper than Full versions, but check for an existing Windows install. Finally, Full versions are the most expensive, but if you want to live by the purest letter of the license agreement, this is what you need.\nWindows 8 is also an option, and will have cheaper licensing, but won't be available until October.\n", "Q: iMac reachability over sleep I've got an issue with my iMac...\nLet me explain the configuration:\n\n\n*\n\n*The router is connected to the internet, the WiFi is turned off.\n\n*Time Capsule is connected to the router with an ethernet cable, it's in Bridge Mode, the WiFi is set to 802.11 n only, the 5GHz is set to channel 36 and the 2.4GHz is set to channel 8.\n\n*Airport Express is connected to the network created from Time Capsule, it extends the network in 2.4GHz (this AirPort Express doesn't support dual bands).\n\n*Apple TV is connected to the network in 5GHz.\n\n*iPad 2 is connected to the network in 2.4GHz.\n\n*iMac is connected to the network in 5GHz.\n\n*iPhone 4S is connected to the network in 2.4GHz.\n\n*MacBook Pro is connected to the network in 2.4GHz.\n\n*The printer is connected to the network in 2.4GHz.\n\n\nThe trouble is:\n\n\n*\n\n*When the iMac is in sleep mode, after a few hours it dissapear from the network. So I cannot access it while on the go with my iPhone through 3G network, neither from my Macbook Pro on the same network.\n\n\nWell, I hope everything is clear to understand...\nThanks in advance \n\nA: I found someone else with this specific problem.  My understanding is that Apple's Airport Base Stations simply \"forget\" the previously attached computer.  \nTwo things to check:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a static IP address in network configuration on the iMac\n\n*in Airport Utility make sure you've created a MAC address based DHCP reservation for this iMac.  Apparently, the AEX AEB & TC will still \"forget\" but it might be longer now, like 6-8 hours.  \n\n\nThe work around: using either and application or System Preferences > Energy Save schedule the iMac to \"wake up\" and turn back off every 6 hours or so if not being used.  This should re-up the IP.  Alternatively, DD-WRT router software supports WOL out of the box.  Wireless WOL is not part of the spec, however, I believe wireless WOL is an Apple deal.\n\nA: Firstly, make use that \"Wake for network access\" is checked in the Energy Saver preference pane of the System Preferences.\nIf this fixes your problem, then stop here, otherwise continue...\nIf your iMac is quite new, then it will have the Wireless Wake-On-Lan feature, but it doesn't seem to work correctly. Contact Apple. A reinstall of your operating system may fix this problem.\nIf your iMac is a older model, then Wireless Wake-On-Lan will not be available to you. You must alter your set-up so that your iMac connects using ethernet, to take advantage of traditional Wake-On-Lan.\nEither:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect the Time Capsule to the iMac directly using an ethernet\ncable.\n\n*Move your current Airport Express (or buy another one), and place it\nclose to your iMac, connect the iMac to the Airport Express using an\nethernet cable, and set the Airport Express to extend the network\n(bridging mode).\n\n\nA: Is the basic problem that you can't wake your iMac from a device outside your LAN (you say you want to wake a LAN device over 3G and don't mention VPN, so the 3G device must be on the WAN)?\nIf that is indeed the issue, then I would put the modem-router in bridge mode, and have the Time Capsule do NAT instead.\nApple designs their devices to be easy to configure with the services they advertise (like sleep proxy, icloud, etc) but it's harder for them when you have a generic device making decisions about incoming traffic.\nSo again: have the modem-router just pass everything wholesale to the Time Capsule, so that it can handle NAT.\n", "Q: Dependencies for LaunchAgent so it mounts a bundle before other daemons run I have following setup: I have a sparsebundle on an external disk containing steam (it wouldn't install on my internal disk - something about the format). But by now I depend on this approach as this bundle got much larger as my internal disk.\nFor this I have written a simple LaunchAgent that mounts the bundle (if available) onto ~/Library/Steam when I logon.\nI have this setup for some time now, but just recently noticed that Steam itself also installed a LaunchAgent - no idea what it does... But I want to make sure the mounting happens before the Agent from Steam runs.\nSo far I checked if I could set some dependencies or so in Launchd - but couldn't find anything. Do you have suggestions how I might achieve this?\n\nA: Firstly, a rant: Sparse Bundles work in a way to allow the bundle to increase in size to accomidate it's contents, however any files that you modify or delete in the bundle will not decrease the bundle size as you'd expect. For example, if I add two 1GB files to the bundle and then delete one, the bundle will be 2GB in size. If I then add another 1GB file, then the bundle will increase to 3GB in size. Long story short, don't run applications in bundles.\nAs for the LaunchAgent for Steam, it's probably just a background server connection. I would disable it within the Steam preferences if you can, and/or try to remove it from the start-up list.\nThere is no built in delay for startup apps that I'm aware of.\nI use Keyboard Maestro for this. My workflow is for Keyboard Maestro to launch at login, then to wait for a certain period of time (delay) after login and then launch an app (eg Dropbox). \n", "Q: Prevent Address Book (Contacts) to quit when closing the window The Address Book quits when closing the window. Did anybody find a way to prevent this behavior?\n\nA: If the application is designed like there is no way to change it. If you want to keep the application open and not see it you can hide it:\n\n\n*\n\n*from the menu \"Address Book\" → \"Hide Address Book\"\n\n*with the keyboard shortcut command + H\n\nA: Those settings are defined when the code for the app is compiled. You can’t edit those by modifying a plist or something. I don’t see the reason behind the behaviour you are looking for. If you could give a reason, maybe I can suggest a workaround.\n", "Q: How can I reduce/optimize downloads when upgrading to an SSD and installing Mountain Lion? I am worried about downloading so many things:\nHere what is I have:\n\n\n*\n\n*A macbook Pro, with Mountain Lion installed (Upgraded from Lion)\n\n*Things installed Xcode, Eclipse with android, RVM, GIT, And lot of another developer tools.\n\n*A lot of another things like spotify offline songs, emails, some 30-40 applications downloaded from app store.\n\n\nNow here is the thing:\nDo I need to download xcode, Mountain lion, Eclipse etc again to make a fresh install on my new SSD.\nWhats the possible way to minimize the download?\n\nA: How much space are you using on your current drive and how big is the SSD? If your current space is less than or equal to that of the SSD, you can do a direct clone, without downloading the OS again.\nYou'll need to get an external enclosure (2.5\" bus powered USB ones can be had for ~$20). Put your SSD in that, and you can use Disk Utility to clone your current drive to the SSD. If your current drive is bigger than your SSD (but the capacity used is still smaller), you'll have to shrink your current partition first. You'll also probably want to reinstall the recovery partition to your SSD, using Apple's tool. Once the clone is done, you can just put the SSD in your Mac and everything should work as before.\nIf you don't want to buy an external enclosure, you can use another external drive (if you have enough free space), and essentially perform the above procedure twice - once from the old drive to the external, then install the SSD and clone from the external to it.\nThe final option, if you have a Time Machine backup, is to install the Recovery Disk to the SSD (so you can boot to a recovery mode off the SSD), then restore from the Time Machine to the SSD.\n\nA: *\n\n*Make a clean install on the SSD. Or you can just copy over the System Files. This would make steps 2, 3 and 6 unnecessary.\n\n*Create a temporary admin account on the SSD.\n\n*Add a new account in the Users and Accounts preferences. It should match the credentials of your old account on the HDD.\n\n*Right click on the account after it has been created, then click on Advanced Options.\n\n*Set the home folder of this account as the previous home folder on your HDD.\n\n*Transfer the necessary apps, libraries, etc by using a disk cloning app or good old copy-pasting.\n\n\nWith these steps, if you do not do a clean install, there is nothing to download and everything is guaranteed to work. You don’t even need an external disk.\n", "Q: Charging behavior of iOS devices Does the speed at which the battery of an iOS device charges vary depending upon whether it is being used or not?\nFor example, when I am charging an iPhone in my car, will it charge faster when not in use?\n\nA: Yes if you use it, it takes longer to charge because your usage consumes power as well. OTOH I doubt whether you will notice a huge difference when you only have 20 minutes left to charge.\n", "Q: Is there a way to auto switch wireless networks depending on signal strength? I have a Linksys dual band router. Near the back of our house (which is where our computers are mostly located) only the G network really comes through so when I'm working in the front of our house, I like to connect to the N network for the extra speed. Unfortunately we are unable to move our router. If it is possible, I would like my Mac to automatically switch networks depending on the signal strength. Is there a way to do this?\nOur Macs are running 10.8. \nThanks\n\nA: Not saying this is ideal or works well. But Just to give you an idea.\nYou can use command line tools to write a script that checks the strength.\nand then changes the network as needed.\nTo get the strength you can use this command line code:\n/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport -I |grep -i \"agrCtlRSSI:\"\n\nLook at the man pages for /usr/sbin/networksetup for changing the setup.\nAs an example here is a quick applescript.\nIt only runs once as it is only an example of use.\nBut in your script I would do it as a LaunchAgent\nThere is an app called lingon that simplifies the writing of LaunchAgents.

I've noticed that Mountain Lion does not show up as 'Purchased' in the App Store and indeed when I search for the app, the store offers to sell it to me. Is this a bug or by design?\n\nA: If Mountain Lion is pre-installed on your Mac, you won't normally get a redemption code to purchase the \"upgrade\" but that serial number will be checked if you have to do a bare install, and the installer will download because the Mac deserves to get Mountain Lion internet recovery install on a bare drive.\nBasically, the license is tied with the hardware, not the Apple ID. However, some Macs purchased during the window surrounding the release can often take advantage of the Up To Date program which according to the web page is intended for Machines that shipped with Lion and not Mountain Lion.\nThe upgrade lets you install the software on all of your personal Macs whereas the machine license generally lets you just install it on the Mac that shipped with the OS.\n\nA: It's actually hidden. If you open the app store and go to the \"Store\" menu and select \"View My Account\", it will tell you that you have \"Hidden Purchases\". Unhide and download.\n\nA: I've been on the phone with Apple Support for almost two hours explaining this and why I would want an installer for the OS my computer shipped with. I was finally sent to the App Store support who then sent me back to Apple Support. Short answer is that nobody knows how to do it at Apple Support or the App Store.\nHere's what I did. I attached a USB drive large enough for the Mountain Lion installer (8GB) to my 2012 MacBook Air that shipped with Mountain Lion. Then I booted up in Recovery mode (the only way we can download the OS that shipped with our books), told it to do a fresh install on my USB drive (you'll need an internet connection) then I unplugged the USB drive after it rebooted to install the OS. The result is the OS installer image in a folder called \"Mac OS Install Data\". I then copied that image to my book's drive, then used Disk Utility to burn the image to the USB drive. Now I have a USB bootable drive for installing Mountain Lion.\nWhat a chore!\nOn a related note this is how I save app installers from the App Store:\nCopy and paste this into the Terminal app while you're downloading an app:\nsudo find /var/folders -mmin -1 -size +1024 -type f -exec ls -lAdh {} \\;\nI leave it to the UNIX gurus to come up with a better \"find\" line. You'll have to enter your password in order to search the directory where the file is being downloaded to.\nThis command searches in \"/var/folders\" and all of its subfolders for a file that's been updated in the last minute and is larger than 1MB (fairly safe assumptions for a downloading installer). Somewhere inside \"/var/folders\" is where the installer is downloaded.\nCopy the folder from the Terminal window (don't copy the last bit...the [garble].pkg part. Your string should end in '/'.\nThen in the Finder and press command-shift-g. Paste the folder string copied from Terminal and click \"Go\". You're going to want to copy that [garble].pkg file out of there (drag it to the Desktop. Keep a watch in the App Store as you'll need to start the copy AFTER the installer has downloaded and BEFORE it has finished installing!\nWhat a chore!\n\nA: I'm fairly certain this is by design. If it were \"purchased\", then you could download Mountain Lion on any other Mac that has your App Store credentials.\n\nA: If your computer shipped with 10.8 Mountain Lion you should DEFINITELY be able to see it as installed in the Mac App Store.  \nI would double check to make sure that you are actually running 10.8 Mountain Lion (click on the Apple in the top left hand corner of your screen, click on 'about this mac' and you should see a window that either says 'Version 10.7' or 'Version 10.8').  \nWhen I was selling Macs for a living we would sell Macs that had the prior operating system on them even though the new operating system was out.  In that circumstance you are expected to go to: http://www.apple.com/osx/uptodate/ to claim your free upgrade.  I would do so quickly since you only have 30 days from date of purchase. \nIf you have 10.8 Mountain Lion attached to an Apple ID you can install it on \"any Macs you own or control for personal use.\" http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4461\n", "Q: Lost Launchpad configuration If I move an app in Launchpad and then I \"killall Dock\" from the terminal, the Launchpad sometimes gets its previous configuration so my changes are lost.

If not, you could also quit and reopen Dock by logging out and back in.\n", "Q: How do I prevent TGZ archives from being automatically un-gzipped upon download? I use Safari on Mac OS Lion, and one behavior I find rather annoying is that it insists on automatically un-gzipping TGZ archives when I download them. It doesn't untar them; it just uncompresses them, which is virtually useless. Ideally, it wouldn't uncompress them at all, but if it would uncompress and untar them I could live with that.\nI'm aware that I can uncheck the \"Open 'safe' files after downloading\" option in Safari to false, but that also means giving up such niceties as PDFs automatically opening when I download them. Is there a more tailored solution?\n\nA: Uncheck the, \"Open \"safe\" files after downloading\" checkbox in Safari's General preferences.\n\n\nA: You can create a file that overrides OS X's safe file types. Instructions here. Keep in mind that this is a white list, so you'll have to add the identifiers for file types you do want Safari to automatically open.\nNote: these instructions are a bit old, and I can't confirm if this is still the case with Lion and Safari 6 (only on an iPad at the moment), but its worth a try.\n", "Q: Ghost podcasts appearing on smart playlist When I create a smart playlist that should only have podcasts, a \"ghost\" podcasts appear then disappears when I am updating my podcasts subscriptions.

Please note that I am not using the Podcasts app. \n\n\nA: I had been using the Podcast app, and then deleted it. I believe this left orphaned podcast episodes in the phone itself. I had to SSH into the phone and delete the orphaned files.

I am using Find my iPhone on a Jailbroken iPhone 4 running iOS 5.0.1. My service does not have a data plan. It is T-mobile with only voice and SMS.\nWhen trying to view the location in Find My iPhone, it shows my phone as \"Offline\" even though I am connected to an active Wi-Fi signal and have location services on. When viewing the Find My iPhone app in iOS, it displays my phone as \"No location available\".\nI've tried all steps in Troubleshooting Find My iPhone under \"'No location available' alert\", but the issue persists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA: Location on an iPhone requires a data plan. This is because your iPhone’s GPS downloads an “almanac” file to help locate itself. This can’t happen over Wi-Fi, as these files are not on the internet, but on the internal network of your carrier. \nAs for your iPhone not using the Wi-Fi to locate itself, that’s probably because the network is not yet in Apple’s database.\nThere’s must be something broken if the iPhone is not showing up as online. There can be two possibilities. Either Apple has configured Find My iPhone only to use GPS or some tweak or a bad jailbreak is not allowing the findmyiphoned (process responsible for responding to Find My iPhone requests) to work or launch properly. As there can many things that can cause this problem, I would suggest first booting up in safe mode (SBSettings can do that) and seeing if the problem is resolved. If it is, that means a tweak caused a problem. If it isn’t, that means you did a bad jailbreak. In the latter case, a restore is the only option.\nSource: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_GPS\n", "Q: Clicking \"Downloads\" in Finder does nothing. How can I repair it?

I verified that I can still log in to my account without the external drive connected.\n\nA: According to this Apple Support discussion this is normal and is due to the mounted volume size being a \"potential\" size (usually twice) of the actual hard disk size. If it puts your mind at rest, I see exactly the same thing on my Snow Leopard 10.6.8 system with FileVault enabled and that's been just fine.\nIn addition, in my answer to FileVault sparsefile uses double of actual allocated disk space it could simply be that as Filevault mounts (and links to) the encrypted disk image, the size reported in Get Info is a result of the structure being traversed twice.\n", "Q: Is target disk mode a clean way to install (Mountain) Lion on a blank mac? Since I don't have an optical disc, and no USB thumb drives are available, but I do have a second mac, target disk mode over FireWire seems like the only way to install Mountain Lion (since this 2010 MBP doesn't have that permanent recovery mode in its firmware, and I was dumb and formatted the whole disk, instead of just the system partition, thus deleting the recovery partition).\nBut I'm thinking, when you install on a local disk on a MacMini, is some aspect of the installation MacMini-specific? After installing from the MacMini, will the OS be missing some MBP drivers, and include superfluous Mac Mini drivers?\n\nA: You should be fine installing that way. The OS X installer is pretty flexible, and is designed to be able to install on external drives (which is essentially what a Mac in Target Disk Mode is). With the exception of the system disks included with Macs prior to Lion, which were machine-specific, OS X installs work on any Mac the OS supports. You can even boot a Mac from a different system's drive without issue, as long as it's not a version prior to that Mac's release.\n\nA: You have two options using Target Disk mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start the MBP in Target Disk and then boot the mini normally and install to the MBP disk.\n\n*Start the Mac Mini as Target Disk and then boot the MBP from the Mini disc, then install to the local disk.\n\n\nIf you are worried that the install will be tailored to the hardware running at the time then you can try option 2. However in my experience when you install off commercial OS-X disks (not the ones that come with a particular Mac) all files are included.\n", "Q: How to use an AirPort Express as an AirPlay device with a TP-Link router? I recently upgraded my router (TP-Link TL-WR1043N) so now my wireless network is broadcasting in 11b/g/n mixed mode, and my 1st generation AirPort Express is having trouble joining the network.\nI have done a factory reset several times, and each time everything seems to work fine but then when the APE tries to reset, AirPort Utility bombs with the message\n\nAirPort Utility was unable to find your AirPort wireless device after restarting.\n\nI'd love to keep this working just as an AirPlay device.\nUPDATE: I tried resetting the wireless network to use 11bg mode, but got the same result. So I'm guessing the thing has just crapped out coincidentally at the same time I made the change to my network. Oh well!\n\nA: I had the exact same thing. I have three AirPort Expresses and it seems to me that my oldest one is not compatible with the new technology. The other two work fine. I can't update the firmware, so I guess I'm left with buying a new one. It took my whole system down.\n\nA: what you need to do is to extend the wireless network! Loud sound link!\nand you shuld be able to use it perfectly as a repeater and airplay, this is how i use mine, however if your issue still presists, try conect it with a LAN cable, although this should not be needed!\n\nA: I have a TP-Link TL-WDR3600 and a first gen Airport Express. I was having the same problems until I set both configurations to use WPA2 Personal instead of WPA/WPA2 Personal. With that change, the Express now connects to the wireless network.\n", "Q: Using an iPhone 4S in South Korea My brother will soon be going to South Korea to teach English and he is wanting to make sure that his phone will work properly with a local carrier. The phone is SIM unlocked (we verified it with an Orange UK SIM card that I picked up last summer in England). So, does anyone know of a South Korean carrier that supports iPhones?\nThe iPhone 4S is from Sprint in the USA originally and they unlocked the GSM SIM slot for me because I was going to spend some time in the UK.\nWill this GSM-unlocked CDMA phone work with any South Korean carriers?\n\nA: It will work on KT (they even sold the 3GS which wasn't CDMA), and possibly others.\nHe may need to get the IMEI registered with the network before the SIM will work in it though as they are very protective over their networks (this was true up until 2010 at least, although they may have become more relaxed on this since then).\n\nA: SK Telecom and KT (Korea Telecom) are both vendors of the iPhone, but they are CDMA providers I believe. I'm not sure\n\nA: Apple maintains a list of all carriers that work with iPhone, so if no one here has first-hand experience of using an authorized unlock Sprint phone with one of the Korean carriers, you can always use the contact information for both carriers to ask how you might spend some money with them while in country.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1937\n\n*http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3939\nThe second link shows that the Sprint 4s is A1387: iPhone 4s (CDMA model), so that means it is capable of working with both CDMA voice networks and GSM voice networks. Since you've already unlocked for GSM, that might be your easiest bet since most carriers offer prepaid SIM that just works. It's really up to the carriers in Korea, however since they could not service a phone that's not enrolled and you will need their help to get the CDMA MEID registered before it would work on a CDMA network. You might need their help registering your IMEI or they might be open to most devices.\n", "Q: Does Time Machine fix ownership of files when restoring from another Mac? My computer recently crashed with no backup of Time Machine. I'm having issues getting a clean install to install on my hard drive (it won't let me do a fresh install from my Boot USB disk).\nI am however having more luck using a Time Machine backup from my girlfriends MacBook Pro.\nAm I going to run into any ownership issues when restoring Lion from another computer its Time Machine backup?\n\nA: As far as I can tell, if you use Migration Assistant (either the standalone application or during the installation of OSX) to move files from Time Machine to any computer there is no problem. I've moved users before from one computer to the other. If you copy directly from the hard drive you might run into issues, but Migration Assistant does the trick. \n", "Q: Sync Notes on iphone with a txt file on windows PC Is there any way to sync a txt file on the windows filesystem with a Notes file on the iOS device- iphone or ipad. I regularly take my notes on my PC but want them to be viewable on my iPhone. Could be through a cloud technology such as iCloud/dropbox. Any suggestions?\n\nA: You have two options:\nUsing Dropbox, save your files on your Dropbox folder and access them on your iPhone through:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Dropbox app, tap on a file. I think Dropbox has a built in text editor, or you can select any text-editing app on your device to view/edit it.\n\n*Any of the many dedicated text editing apps with built in Dropbox support, such as Elements, Droptext, etc. Look around a bit.\n\n\nUsing iCloud, create notes using the native app. They will be accessible on your PC through:\n\n\n*\n\n*iCloud.com. Click on mail and select the folder\ncalled \"Notes\". Note though, you wont be able to edit them just now on this site.\nNonetheless, Apple is supposed to be releasing an update to their\niCloud.com website during the next month or two and give it a\ndedicated notes application, which will likely allow for editing\nwithin the web interface. \n\n*Outlook. Install the iCloud Control Panel for windows, and check the box that allows you to syinc notes. Note though, you need a compatible version of Outlook.\n\n", "Q: encrypted time machine backups to a single external hdd from more than one mbp I am planning to get a external HDD for time machine backups for 2 macbook pros.\n\n\n*\n\n*Can both of them backup to the same HDD\n\n*Can the disk be time machine encrypted and still be accessible to both?\n\n\nA: Yes you can do that. Just divide the disk into two partitions and you are done.\nThe Disk Utility app provided by Apple with your Mac can be used to create partitions.\n", "Q: How to Connect printer to macbook pro I have a printer HP deskjet f4210 connected to a windows 7 system, I am trying to connect my macbook pro os 10.7.4 to it, however I get the message authentication required. I tried entering guest/guest as I found this tip from another forum, and it connected. However it goes through the print process and nothing is printed. There are no errors, it shows the progress bar and then the job is removed from the queue as if its printed. \nWhat is the fix?\n\nA: Have you done a software update? As HP updates their drivers to suit different versions of OSX different updates are pushed through to users. Read more on hp's website.\nYou could also try resetting the printer system.\n", "Q: Is it legal for other people (with different IDs) to share different apps,games and music with each other & if it is legal, is there a limit? Say for example there's 3 people. Person 'A' has an app that person 'C' wants, while person 'A' has another app that person 'B'&'C' want. Can person 'A' transfer these apps without any memory wipes or repercussions, and would the apps act as if they were bought from person 'B'&'C' as in for games to connect for Multiplayer and so and so forth? \nAnother question I have is what are the means to transfer data and purchases, is the only legitimate way via iTunes? \n(I know it's not very detailed but I do appreciate any answers that can help clarify because I bought several of the same apps on different IDs and I'm hoping I can unify them)\nAlso, is there a limit to the number of accounts that can share an app or is it limited to one per account? Sorry to add on, but can anyone copy and paste, explain or link the rules and regulations that explain and could help with my problems?\n\nA: Though it is technically possible, it's not legally possible.\nAs per Apple's Licensed Application End User Agreement:\n\na. Scope of License: This license granted to You for the Licensed\n  Application by Application Provider is limited to a non-transferable\n  license to use the Licensed Application on any iPhone or iPod touch\n  that You own or control and as permitted by the Usage Rules set forth\n  in Section 9.b. of the App Store Terms and Conditions (the “Usage\n  Rules”).

Though each developer is free to choose his/her own wording for their EULA, so your mileage may vary.\n", "Q: changing language on ipad3 I changed language on the iPad3 from english to italian, but I noticed that a few things remain in english. For instance, day and time in locked screen, as well as in the calendar. Is there a way to fix it?\n\nA: Did you try to change the Region Format settings in Settings > General > International ?\n\nYou should be able to change it to Italian.\nNote : this is an iPhone capture but it is exactly on the same place on the iPad. It is easier to put an iPhone capture in a post.\n", "Q: How can I create a separate address book to sync to a different mobile phone? I maintain my husband's contacts database up to now on a PC using Outlook. I switched to Mac for my own use (Mountain Lion) and use Apple Contacts for my own Address book.\nI would like to create a separate address book for him on my Mac which I would then sync only to his mobile phone and iPad. I wish to keep his contacts completely separate from mine.\nIs this possible and how do I do it? \n\nA: Create a separate user account for your husband. Your stuff will be different. Steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences > Users and Groups.\n\n*Click the lock icon in the bottom left and fill in your password.\n\n*Click the + below the left pane.\n\n*Fill in the credentials.\n\n*Log in to that account and start filling out the contacts.\n\n*If you want to copy over any contact, select the contacts in the address book and then File > Export. Save the files on a USB drive or a place not in your home directory.\n\n*Just open the files in your husband’s account. They will be added to Contacts.\n\n\nIf you are talking about an iPhone, another thing you could do is use iCloud. That would be much better and much more streamlined.\n", "Q: Avoiding malware in recommendations? Occasionally, answers on this site include software recommendations. Let’s assume a \"legitimate developer\" pretends to have created a useful application that is (secretly) capable of doing harm. How can I be sure I do not install something that contains malicious code or a root kit, especially if it is closed-source software?\n\nA: Sadly, malicious code can be so small and obfuscated in an infinite number of ways so you can't simply make a rule to test a package to tell if it's good or bad.\nStatistically, people have established some guidelines like trying to know the source (typing in the web address directly and not trusting a link, not downloading it from an alternate site, insisting that it be code-signed and verifying the package check sum before installing executables), but these are indirect remedies. \nApple maintains a page with links to most security information here:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://ssl.apple.com/support/security/\nAdditionally, you could insist that all software that you run is signed by a legitimate developer to reduce the likelihood that someone has added a key logger to the game you just downloaded.\nLastly, after several delays, Apple has released GateKeeper to effectively sandbox software so that it has to explicitly list the things that it does (like access the address book, or modify files without user interaction) so that you can only let the system run code that obeys the sandbox rules. From a consumer perspective, you can prevent all code from running while you do whatever checks you feel are appropriate before allowing that code to run on your Mac. \n\nA: Run Sophos and keep it up to date. It's free and it doesn't slow your system down like we've probably all experienced on windows machines. Just sits up in the menu bar, doing it's thing, minding it's own business.\n\nA: There is no surefire solution, but there are some simple steps you can take that in practice are effective:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn on Gatekeeper.\nIt should be on by default, but if you want to be sure: go to System Preferences, then Security and Privacy, and then click \"Mac App Store and identified developers\".  Like this:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Try to get your software through the Mac App Store, whenever possible.  This is much safer than getting software through the web.\n\n*When installing an app through the Mac App Store, take a quick look at the reviews, the number of people who have installed it, and the brand.  If it has bad reviews or very few reviews, and if very few people have installed it previously, you might want to be cautious.  If in addition you've never heard of the brand, you might be even more careful.\nWhile there are no absolute guarantees in life, software that has good reviews and many installs is very unlikely to be malware.  It is very rare for malware to make it onto the market, and when it has happened, it tends to get removed fairly quickly -- and I would expect this to be especially true for widely used software.\n\n*If you are forced to install software from outside the Mac App Store, be extra careful.  This is your primary risk factor.\n\n\n*\n\n*Only download software using https.  Check that the browser address bar shows https (not http) and/or has a nice background glow.\n\n*Only install software from trusted sources: i.e., major brands that you recognize or who have been recommended to you by folks you trust to give you good computer advice.\n\n*Don't install sketchy stuff.  Don't install pirated software.  Don't install free file-sharing software.  Don't download and install stuff off of bulletin boards and file-sharing sites.  These applications are at much greater risk of containing malware, spyware, or other bad stuff.\n\n*If you are configuring a computer for someone who is not very software-literate, who you are worried might get fooled into installing bad stuff, and who probably won't need to install new software off the web for any legitimate purpose, you could configure Gatekeeper to only allow applications downloaded from the Mac App Store.  This will provide extra protection against malware, at some cost in flexibility in where you can get your software from.\n\n\n*Make regular backups.  Install and enable Time Machine.  It is a simple and painless way to keep good backups.  And good backups are great, last-ditch safeguard if you should suffer security problems: while you don't want to get infected by malware (it's a hassle and no fun), if it does happen, at least you should have backups of all your data.\nDon't bother with anti-virus software.  It doesn't add enough value.  If you use Mac OS X's built-in protections, and exercise some good judgement when installing software, you are very likely to be fine.\nAnd, don't get overwhelmed or too scared by the malware stuff.  By selecting a Mac, you're already at significantly lower risk than most other users.  And, by following the advice above, you've further reduced your risk.  While nothing in life is risk-free, the risk is pretty low.  Use good judgement, and you will almost surely be fine.\n", "Q: Change directory for screenshots on IPad for using Dropbox I would like to change the directory for the screenshots in a way that dropbox uploads it automatially. There are a lot of tutorials on MAC OS but I cannot find it for IPad. Does someone knows how to save screenshots in directory that dropbox can uploads?\n\nA: You can't change the location of screenshots in iOS, they always get stored into your Photo Library. To get the into Dropbox you have to open the Dropbox ap, pick the photos you want to publish and store them into one of your Dropbox folders.\n", "Q: How do websites offer a factory unlocking service There are numerous websites online which offer an actual genuine factory unlocking service if you provide the iPhone's IMEI code. They advertise a service which whitelists your iPhone's IMEI code from Apple's database. As far as I know, only certified carriers can carry out this service.\nHow do these independent websites and other individuals manage to offer this service too? According to user comments and testimonials they really do carry out what is advertised. \n\nA: They pay someone that works for a carrier to enter that information into the carrier database or they have hacked access to that database. \nAs long as iTunes gets the device ID as one to be unlocked when it restores the device, it gets unlocked. Otherwise it gets locked to the carrier under which it was sold. \n", "Q: How to create a 'New Email with Attachment' option in Finder? With OS X Lion, the 'New Email with Attachment' option is missing from Finder. It is supposed to be replaced with the new \"Share Button\". Unfortunately, the only two ways I can share a file are Airdrop and iMessage. I use Mac Mail and this isn't present.\nI checked 'Services' under 'System Preferences' and didn't see any option to add email to the share menu.\nHow do I customize the share to items?\n\nA: Is the service present and enabled in the Services section of Keyboard Preferences?\nYou should see this:\n\nIf it's not there for some reason, you can recreate it easily in Automator. \nCreate a new Service in Automator, add the \"New Mail Message\" action to the workflow, and change the first drop down at the top so it reads \"Service receives selected files and folders in any application\". It should look like this:\n\nThen save it, and you should have it available in your services menu.\n\nA: To create attachments, you can drag files from Finder into an empty email message. But I agree that this is too much work.\nTo save some keystrokes, you can create attachments by dragging files from Finder directly to the Mail icon in the dock - doesn't matter if Mail is running or not.\nNB. In most cases dragging files to an app icon in the dock will do something meaningful, depending on the file type and the app.\n", "Q: Configure MacBook Air at Apple Premium Resellers in Singapore I am Abhimanyu, located in Singapore. I have a question for you all: Can I configure MacBook Air at one of the Apple Premium Resellers?\nI want to buy 13\" MacBook Air, but I need 8 GB Memory, instead of default 4 GB memory. Can I get my system configure at one of Apple Premium Resellers? Is it safe to do it? Does that void warrenty?\nBTW, what is difference between Apple Premium Resellers and Apple Authorised Reseller?\nIf I cannot get MacBook Air configure at Apple Premium Resellers, can I get it configure at Apple Authorised Resellers?\n\nA: \"Difference between Apple Premium Resellers and Apple Authorised Reseller\": The premium resellers are supposed to have better service and more knowledgable staff.\nUnless the Premium resellers stock the CTO (configure to order) models then you will need to order it online.  \nThe majority of Apple Retail Stores will not carry that model but some Resellers do.  So I would check with the particular store.\nAs the other commenter stated you cannot physically put more ram into a MacBook Air once it is already put together.  The ram is soldered onto the Logic Board.  \n\nA: In the case of the MacBook air and 15\" Retina MacBook Pros, the RAM memory chips are directly soldiered onto mother ('Logic') board, rather onto removable modules that slot into DDR3 connectors (for example). As such, \"upgrading\" the memory on these devices isn't really possible, instead, different configurations are made during manufacturing. (much like the capacity of an iPhone, it can't be changed; it can only be exchanged for a whole different device that was built with the desired capacity)\n", "Q: Problem with web-sharing and resolving localhost I was using web-sharing and accessing some webpages that I had developed using localhost. I messed up a PostGreSQL installation and deleted anything related to PostGreSQL and in the process appear to have damaged my apache installation. \nIf I run ping localhost the result is \n\n--- localhost ping statistics --- 794 packets transmitted, 794 packets received, 0.0% packet loss round-trip min/avg/max/stddev =\n  0.033/0.076/0.920/0.055 ms\n\nI then tried running apachectl configtest and recieved the following output:\nLibrary not loaded: /usr/lib/libpq.5.dylib   Referenced from: /usr/sbin/httpd\nReason: image not found /usr/sbin/apachectl: line 90: 16227 Trace/BPT trap: 5       $HTTPD -t\n\nI also tried\ncurl http://localhost || echo $? curl: (7) couldn't connect to host 7\n\nWithin System Preferences->Sharing->Web Sharing when I try to tick web-sharing I end up with it being unticked automatically.

How do I change the color depth of a monitor in Lion/10.7? I vague remember it being an option in the display prefs or the display menu bar in an older OSX version, but it seems gone in 10.7?  \n\nA: You're right in that Apple removed the option to switch between \"Millions\" and \"Thousands\" of colors from the Displays preference pane in OS X after Leopard (10.5). \nI've not tried them, but something like Display Maestro or SwitchResX both appear to have the ability to change color depth and might help.\n\nA: I've discovered the Quicksilver Displays plugin changes color depth for Lion as well. If you use Quicksilver already (and you should) its very easy - search for the display name, choose the color depth action, and choose the depth you want. It's great for changing display size also.\nA little more info is here - http://lifehacker.com/322363/top-10-quicksilver-plug+ins.\n", "Q: What utilities assist in taking and annotating screen captures for local (clipboard) reuse?

This is what Jing used to do, but it's being discontinued and it doesn't work very well on the retina MacBook Pro.\n\nA: Pix.am! meets all your requirements. And since it's a lesser-known service, it has shorter URLs than services like droplr.com or Cloudapp.\n", "Q: How to completely disable password saving in Safari? Safari keeps asking if I want to save passwords whenever I submit a login form.\nIs there any way to disable this password saving feature completely?\n\nA: If AutoFill is disabled, Safari won't ask to save passwords either.\n\n", "Q: Automatically expose underlying files in iPhoto My wife and I use a blog on Blogspot to post pictures and videos of our kids for our far-flung relations.\nRecently, we have had issues with posting videos from iPhoto to the blog. The blog uses a standard browser interface to get to the content.\nAfter a lot of investigation, I found that the issue is that the iPhoto library (package) is exposing the thumbnail of the video to the interface, not the actual video.  The website can't process the thumbnail as a video (obviously) and this is causing us all sorts of grief.\nThis apparently worked fine until a recent update within the past month or so (per my wife).\nIs there any way around this or am I stuck with having to manually locate and migrate the files to a temporary folder so we can share them?\n\nA: Go to File > Reveal in Finder > Original File.\nIt will open a new Finder window with some obscure path, but don't worry, you don't really have to deal with that.\nJust grab the file, drop it on the file dialog sheet...\n\nand vuala! Your file has been selected. This little trick applies to any file and any native file dialog in OSX.\n\nQuick and easy.\nNote: As an extra tip, you can also drag the file directly to any \"Choose File\" button in Safari. \n\nSo there you go! First show the file, then drag it to the file picker. No temporary folders, moving or even remembering a path involved.

When I was installing OSX 10.8.1, when the install when to reboot Finder refused to shut down citing a mount point problem.  I force closed Finder at which point the post-reboot install started without the system having fully rebooted.  Is there anyway to verify that nothing went wrong with the install?\n\nA: There is not really an easy way to verify the update went successfully. Your next steps should be to check your start up disk and then run a stand alone installer for the suspect OS X update. There is no harm in re-running an OS X installer over an OS with the same version.\n\n\n*\n\n*Run Disk Utility on your start-up disk selecting Verify the Disk and also try Verify Permissions, selecting the repair options as needed.\n\n*Download the standalone OS X 10.8.1 installer.\n\n*Re-run the installer, and hopefully this time it completes without issue.\n\nA: There really is no way to verify these things except to trust Apple to get it right. If \"check for updates\" doesn't tell you to update, then you should assume it worked perfectly.\nFrom the sounds of it, you've got nothing to worry about. It takes more than finder failing to shut down to kill a software update. Most likely the update simply paused, and then automatically resumed once you force quit finder.\nIf you're worried, you could reboot and check for updates again.\n\nA: Yes - you can look over the install log and you could also re-download the combo updater and run it with the log file open and logging everything.\nBoth will alert you if there are problems deploying the patch.\n", "Q: Why does Drop Box not work after 10.8 upgrade? Setup: I got SMB shares on my old-old Mac Mini (running 10.5). I have Drop Box folder/directory with Write-only permission - it is used to be called \"Dropbox\". Recently I upgraded my laptop (MacBook) from 10.6 to 10.8. It was clean install - meaning format drive, install new OS.\nIssue: Running 10.6 on my laptop, \"Dropbox\" use to work great - no issue whatsoever. Used it for over 5 years. However once I got 10.8, I can't seem to write to the remote (Mac Mini) SMB Write-only folder.\nScenario: Drag a file to \"Dropbox\" folder. Finder shows active window of copying a file. Once the transfer is done, I look under the folder (from a server side via VNC) and there are no file's.\nI am certain the issue is with my laptop running 10.8, not a Mini. However I can't figure out what is wrong.\n\nA: To be honest it sounds like it could be a bug in DropBox, and you should contact them to find a solution (and please post the solution here if they give you one).\nWhy do you have the DropBox folder on the server? Why not have a dropbox folder on the server and a completely separate one on your notebook?\nPerhaps it's not what you want, but it seems like that should work perfectly. DropBox usually sends files across to the other machine within a few seconds.\n\nA: A clean install of Mountain Lion means all your settings and preferences have been reset.\nPlease double check your Sharing settings under System Preferences.\n", "Q: How to get MacBook Leopard installation disks? We bought this computer second hand without the disks. Some of the applications were accidentally removed. The trash was emptied before realizing they were in there.\nWe are trying to find someone with the disks to recover what was lost. \nWhere to find the installation disks or if we can use other disks that are more available?\n\nA: Apple doesn't technically sell operating system software discs anymore. If you call AppleCare will often mail you replacement DVDs for what shipped with the system depending on how old it is (1-800-APL-CARE).  \nIf you are looking for the DVDs for third party software AND you have the valid serial numbers for said programs, sometimes the software manufacturers will send you replacement DVDs.  That is as long as this system is the only one that they will be installed on.  \nOtherwise you can look on ebay/amazon for slightly out of date software that may well work for your needs.  \nIf you need a very capable free office package you can try http://www.openoffice.org.  There are many very capable open source programs that you can use on the Mac as well: http://opensourcemac.org\n", "Q: Can I use my Macbook Pro Retina as a monitor for PS3? I want to connect my PlayStation3 to my Retina Macbook Pro so that I can play my games using the MBP's display, is it possible to do it with HDMI port or something else? \n\nA: No, the video ports (HDMI and Thunderbolt) are output only. The MacBooks aren't designed to function as monitors.\nYou could try getting a video capture device that supports live viewing, but the performance and quality are likely to be far from optimal—such solutions are designed for recording video, not live playback or gaming.\n", "Q: Deploying a python application in OS X Server 2.0.23 (aka Mountain Lion Server) OS X Server 2.0.23 (aka Mountain Lion Server) already has python 2.7.3 and wsgi installed.  What is the procedure to install a python web application on that server to run under its own domain?

I'd like to understand how to use the tools provided to deploy the application.\n\nA: Being more of a programming question, I asked it at Stackoverflow and got an reasonable answer to make it work.\n", "Q: Where to find missing USB Driver for Windows 7 on MacBook Air 2012? I successfully installed the latest Boot Camp for Windows 7 on the latest MacBook Air 2012. \nMy only problem is with one driver for USB controller, which it couldn't be found. Any attempt from device manager to find this missing driver searching automatically or inside the Boot Camp folder was not successful.\nWhere can I find the missing driver?\n\nA: The Apple-supplied driver have been overwritten probably by a Windows update. After I reinstalled the Apple Bootcamp Drivers, the problem was solved for me.\n", "Q: What is causing a black screen while switching spaces on Mountain Lion? On Lion I used to see the next space wallpaper while pressing Control + → to switch desktops. But on Mountain Lion I see a Black Screen until the transition is complete. Is it just me who is facing this issue or is this the new behaviour in Mountain Lion?\n\nA: Its now resolved. It was not an issue with OSX. I was using a software called ScreenShade which was causing this issue. Disabling ScreenShade resolved the issue.\n", "Q: Can I prevent OS X 10.8 Mail.app smart mailbox configuration changes/corruption? I have an IMAP account with number of archive mailboxes structured like\n\n + Archive  \n +-- 1996\n +-- 1997\n +-- ...\n +-- 2011\n\nI have configured a smart mailbox including all of these mailboxes plus INBOX and Sent Mail from the same IMAP account:\n\n  Contains that match ANY of the following conditions:  \n    Message is in mailbox Account (in fact, Inbox/Account)\n    Message is in mailbox Account (in fact, Archive/Account)\n    Message is in Mailbox 1996 (in fact, Archive/Account/1996)\n    ...\n\nIt worked just fine since 10.6 I believe.

However, I failed to make a synchronized configuration which would be the same on box mail.app instances.\nCould you please advise how should I configure this smart mailbox to avoid irritating bug?\n\nA: The problem indeed was with synchronisation: my iMac had this account configured as name@company.com, while MBA had this account configure as name.alias@company.com. Once I have deleted all IMAP accounts from both iMac and MBA and created it once again, problem disappeared.\n", "Q: How to shorten startup time after Lion to Mountain Lion upgrade? I have been looking for answers since and have seen a few that say I need to do a fresh install and whatnot. I am simply unhappy with the fact that I just bought a brand new laptop that got a free Mountain Lion upgrade and now regretting it because the startup time is over 1 minute. \nI'm not a techy person and I don't know how to do a fresh install. I refuse to do so if I have to pay for another Mountain Lion download.\nHow to fix the slow computer start, to make start up time as it was before?\n\nA: Once you've paid once for an OS upgrade, you own the right to download the OS again at any time. Reinstalling will not require another purchase. If you wish to try your luck with a fresh in a fresh install, consider watching TLDToday's video series:\nHow to Create a Bootable Mountain Lion 10.8 USB Install Thumb Drive\nHow to Clean Install OS 10.8 Mountain Lion\n\nA: Long start up times are sometimes indicative of a few things:\nFile System issues - if the Mac shuts down improperly then on start up, it will take the time to perform a quick scan of the file system.  If by starting up and shutting down the system, on the next statup the boot time is still long then you should consider using Disk Utility to \"Repair File Permissions\" and \"Check/Repair Disk\"\nExternal USB Device - if you have external devices plugged into your laptop at boot time, dependant on the device type e.g. external USB disk drive, then the USB probing of the devices will increase your startup time.\n", "Q: How to fix a Macbook Pro trackpad where the mouse pointer is randomly moving? The trackpad on my Macbook Pro just started acting oddly. It's randomly clicking (which might cause me to switch programs), right-clicking and even once my screen even showed the swiping animation as if I was trying to switch to a different desktop.    \nPart of me fears that this is some sort of joke hacking attempt (I know of a USB device you plug into someones computer and it randomly moves their mouse and types on their keyboard), but there is nothing plugged into my machine and I just turned off the Wi-Fi and watched as this web page tried to close, the mouse right clicked twice, highlighted a word and clicked \"Paste and Match Style\" in the Chrome right-click menu.\nAlso as I've been typing (with my Wi-Fi turned off) the mouse has randomly been clicking inside this question and changing where I am typing.  \nI just plugged in a USB mouse which seems to work fine but the trackpad is now nearly useless. I can't even move the mouse cursor more than a few centimeters with it.\nIs this a common issue?\nEDIT\nI think it is dying actually. I can now click but not move at all with the trackpad, while a regular mouse works fine.\nEDIT 2\nAnd now it seems to be working again. I turned on the option for \"Ignore Trackpad when Mouse is plugged in\" under Universal Access. I cleaned the trackpad with rubbing alcohol, I whined and complained for a few minutes to my dog, turned off the \"Ignore Trackpad\" setting, unplugged the USB mouse, and the Trackpad appears to be working mostly normally.\nIf I run my finger across it at the top or bottom portion of the mouse, it works, but there is a line horizontally across it (almost exactly where a physical trackpad button would end on the old trackpads) that is \"dead\".  The mouse stops moving, or moves sluggishly when hitting that spot and that \"spot\" goes across the whole trackpad.\n\nA: Your trackpad is definitely dead. It needs a replacement. The dead line means that it is slowly dying. I have had these things. Probably your connector is getting old. But mine got burnt up because the hotel I was staying in did not have proper grounding in their mains supply. This meant that current was flowing from the metal parts and trackpad (it is electrified), through my body, and onto any grounded metal surface I touched. Trackpads are very sensitive to current changes as they have very thin wires running through them. The high ground current burns them off, either row by row or column by column.\n\nA: This was driving me crazy, too. It just started happening yesterday, but was dangerous as the cursor kept selecting everything--making selection rectangles especially on the desktop, opening programs I didn't want to open on the dock, and generally jumping around like a drunk rabbit. \nSearched forums, read about others saying this happened to them after updating their Mac software, etc., etc. Got so frustrated I literally slapped the trackpad with my open palm. And what do you know -- that fixed it! Now my trackpad is working perfectly again. Must have been something pinching or pressing against the underside of the trackpad. \nDon't know if you're all going to believe me 'cause it sounds ridiculous, and if you do believe me I don't know if you're willing to do it. But I swear on my soul it's true and I'm posting this solution for all to see because I want to help. \n\nA: Here are suggestions to try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure your trackpad is clean and dry, and you fingers not wet.\n\n*Try to restart your Dock service by typing in Terminal: killall Dock command (be aware, it'll restart/re-open all your windows). Here is another similar command to restart it:\nlaunchctl stop com.apple.Dock.agent && launchctl start com.apple.Dock.agent\n\n\n*Quit/restart any mouse related software (like BetterTouchTool).\n\n*In System Preferences, Trackpad, slow down your Tracking speed and re-enable  all options.\n\n*Try to reset the System Management Controller (SMC).\n\n*If the problem still continues even after restart, it could be a hardware problem.\n\n\nA: The solution I found on iFixit was to press hard on opposing corners of the trackpad. Just once was enough.\nI had the jumping cursor problem after leaving the Macbook Pro (mid-2012 13 inch) in a drawer for two weeks, which is unusually long for me. \nThe problem consisted of the cursor moving by itself, but there were also pinching motions, text selecting and taps going on that didn't come from my fingers. Or from a combination of my finger and the trackpad itself. At some points, part of the trackpad seemed to be dead. But not always the same parts.\nJust pressing hard on opposing corner has solved the problem... at least for the last hour. Of all the other solutions I've tried, only slapping helped, but only for a few minutes.\n\nA: The trackpad slapping with my open palm works !\n\nA: Today I had a horizontal line not working on the touchpad. I fixed it by removing the touchpad from the laptop (which is very annoying and requires a miniature screwdriver) and cleaned it with a lot of ethanol (ethyl alcohol) and a piece of cotton. I put it back in and it now works perfectly.\nI have had a similar problem a couple of years ago and I didn't have a special screwdriver (that I do have now) and I fixed a similar problem with a syringe with ethanol and squirted the ethanol in the crack around the touchpad.\nI have seen many people suggest to change the touchpad, but you can try with a cloth and ethanol (remove the battery and charger if possible and wait for 30 min for the ethanol to evaporate).\n\nA: This was fixed -- and remains fixed -- after a third internet Reinstall. \nDone through the Recovery Partition, start up with Command R.\n\nA: If you are on macOS Sierra, clearing the login items worked for me. To do so:\n1. Try safe mode\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off your Mac.\n\n*Press and release power button. Then, press and hold left shift until the login screen appears.\n\n*Enter your password and wait for your Mac to log in. Right now, your Mac will start in the safe mode. Note that starting in safe mode can take considerably longer. Mine took around 5 minutes or so, maybe longer.\n\n*Check if you are not experiencing the issue on safe mode. If you are not experiencing the issue on safe mode, then:\n\n\n2. Clear your login items\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences -> Users & Groups.\n\n*Click your account name and select Login Items\n\n*Remove everything in this list by selecting them with cmd+a and clicking the minus sign.\n\n*Restart your Mac.\n\n\nThe issue should have gone now.\nSources:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201262\n\n*https://support.apple.com/kb/PH25614?locale=en_US\n\nA: Shift/control/option and turn off the computer wait 10 secs and then start-up,it should stop that annoying cursor.\n\nA: Nothing just go to system pref. , click over trackpad setting , in point and click select only the first one tap to clik  , after that 2nd scroll & zoom click only the first one, 3rd box leave all blank no selections.....\nNow your mouse'll work as you command \n\nA: I've heard dust and dirt inside the MB/MBP can cause the trackpad to act very weird. I'm having issues with my mouse now and am thinking of taking apart my MBP and blowing it out with a compressor.\n", "Q: Can Mail warn when emailing certain addresses? I have my own personal mail account (a gmail account) and my academic email account (a university account) as different profiles on my Mail application in OS X Snow Leopard. I sometimes forget to switch the outgoing account to my university account when emailing my students and it will send from my gmail account instead. This is not a huge deal but I would prefer to have my students never get mail from my gmail account.\nIs there a way to have Mail warn you when sending to a certain address (or an address that has a certain keyward in it?) \n\nA: Yes, you can have Mail put certain addresses in the to field in black and all others in red.\nI use this to have Mail flag email that's going outside my organization.  \nDo this by going to Preferences > Composing.\nThen under the \"Addressing\" header check \"Mark addresses not ending with [ ].\"  Inside the box put \".nameofyourschool.edu\".\nThen every email address destined within your school will be black, and all others will be red.\nJust the thing to ensure FERPA compliance.\n", "Q: How to get my networked drives to also work on Mountain Lion? I have a networked drive on the XP side of my MacBook. I use a VPN and then can login to the drive. Nothing too special going on. I believe the server uses Active Directory.\nThere isn't a ton of info I have to enter. The \\\\server.local.blah blah\nand some IP info.\nI have never been able to get these to mount or show up and authenticate on the Mac side. I can use the network connect to login to the VPN, but directory access has always been a no-go.\n\nA: If the VPN is working and the same as on the Windows side, you should be able to enter the server details in the Go > Connect to Server (⌘K) dialog in Finder. If it's a standard Windows file share, just enter in smb://server.local.blah and it should connect.\nHowever if that doesn't work, you'll need to provide more details on how your VPN and servers are set up.\n", "Q: How can I triage a MacBook Pro that won't charge with the LED dimly lit green? I have an early-2011 MacBook Pro that will not charge. The green light on the MagSafe connector is barely green. \nBesides the fact that the system info tells me the battery is not charging, the battery is stuck at 39%. If I unplug the charger, the battery begins to get low and I soon as I plug the charge back in the battery stops dropping. \nSome sites say that the problem may be in the logic board and some say that the problem may be in the battery itself. My notebook is always plugged and I never really had a chance to let the battery drain completely. \nThe system profile shows the battery condition as normal and that the ac adapter is not connected.\nSo, my question is: what should I try since my city does not have an Apple Store that I can take my notebook to? Is it possible that letting the battery die (forcing a cycle) could help in that case?  Is there any way of testing if the problem is in the battery (since it is more affordable to change the battery than a logic board)?\nEDIT\nWhat I have done so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have already left it to charge for several hours.  \n\n*I have tried SMC reset more than 10 times already.  \n\n*I have already tested with another charger.\n\n*I have changed the DC-In MagSafe board myself.\n\n\nThe ac adapter shipped with my MacBook is 65w. Will it make any difference to try with a 85w adapter?\n\nA: Please stop resetting your SMC. You can totally screw up your Mac by resetting it too many times in a row. But yes, it seems through what you tried, your logic board is likely the issue. \n\nA: First off, make sure you're using an 85 W MagSafe adapter; MacBook Pros can use the 60 W that shipped with MacBooks, but won't necessarily charge while running. A Pro with a depleted battery won't boot from a 60 W until it has been left to charge for several minutes.\nYou said you tried a SMC reset - try it another 2-3 times, just to be sure.\nWhat does System Profiler/System Information say under the Power section?

I'm having a couple problems with basic command line stuff in the terminal of Mountain Lion.\ncontrol + D does not exit Python as it does in Lion; instead it splits the screen.\nMeanwhile, I also haven't figured out how to continue writing after having viewed the contents of a text document - the terminal doesn't allow it.\nHello hello hello!\nex12.txt (END)\n\nSo far, no matter what I push after this, I get a nasty little beeping sound\n\nA: You can type exit() to exit Python.\n\nA: As Control + D works for me on multiple Macs, I'll presume something is amiss with your installation, keyboard or keyboard handler. (Your difficulty with the pager also lends credence to this theory.) \nYou can use the alternate quit() to exit the interpreter until you have looked at how Python was installed or think of some modifications you might have on the key mapping on your Mac.\n\nA: I had the same problem and I came across this post.\nI think we both thought that we did ^ Ctrl-D but we actually did ⌘ Cmd-D, which is different shortcut and splits the terminal window.\n", "Q: Making MacBook command-key the Emacs meta-key under VMware/Windows I can configure emacs under OS X so that the key nearest the space bar (the key labeled Command ⌘) is my Meta key by running\n(setq mac-command-key-is-meta t)\n\nHow can I configure the same key to be the emacs Meta-key when I run emacs under Windows, and Windows is itself running in VMware Fusion?

I'm looking for technical details on how the Notification Center is architected on Mountain Lion so I can make the most use of it as a user of OS X. Specifically, does it receive messages directly from Apple's push notification service? The high level overview documentation on Apple's developer site for Notification Center mentions UDP delivery of a notification so it seems a network trigger is provided but I can't find a reference to or example of this being implemented on Mountain Lion.\nIf not, can it receive messages from the local network or just from other programs that run locally on OS X?\n\nA: It can work in a couple of ways. One, as you say, is through APNS. \nApps can also use the local notification centre to trigger a notification (you can see this in XCode when a build completes for example). \nWhat are you trying to do?

My kids were playing with some cool magnetic rocks and left them sitting on top of our iPad. This provoked some non-trivial discussion in our family as to whether this was a bad thing.\nI grew up in the era of magnetic floppy diskettes, where sitting a magnet on one could cause you to lose important data. But the iPad, as far as I can tell, doesn't have any magnetic storage. It clearly does have magnet sensors, as that's how the Smart Cover turns it off and on, and I'd hate for magnetic rocks to desensitize said sensors, but I'm also thinking that it seems unlikely that magnets will cause data loss.\nWhat are the risks, if any, of leaving medium-strength magnets (not weak, but not any kind of industrial super-magnet), sitting on top of an iPad? Assume that the screen is covered, so I'm not worried about scratching the glass.\n\nA: You should be fine. As you note, there are magnets (which are actually fairly strong for their size) in the iPad and Smart Cover. There are no magnetic components aside from the Smart Cover attachment points and the unlock sensor—there's a magnetometer for the compass, but it doesn't use a magnet.\nFurthermore, the whole magnets damaging hard drives thing is a bit of a myth. You can wipe them with magnets, but it takes a very powerful one, pretty much nothing you'd have in your home.\n\nA: I have a case with magnets to keep it closed, haven't used iPad in over a month (magnets sitting on iPad without moving) now the entire top half of my screen has 100's of multi colored lines going across it and you can't see anything on the sop half but can still interact with it. At this point I will never trust magnets around electronics again.\n\nA: I have 2 iPads - iPad3 and iPad Air.  The iPad air has a magnetic cover from iHome.  I placed the iPad3 (face down) on top of the magnetic cover of iPad air over night and now i can't power up my iPad 3. :(\nHowever, the iPad Air is still fine with the magnetic cover but the magnet is on the back side of the iPad Air. So, I guess it really depends on where and how long you place the magnet on the iPad and it does and damage the battery.  I am not going to use the magnetic cover on my iPad Air anymore. \n\nA: Oddly enough I've done some reading on this and it seems a magnet, unless we are talking dangerously powerful, cannot erase or damage flash memory.\nHowever, I had to return an iPad that had failed and was assured by the 'Genius Bar' that they put them through a powerful magnet to erase the data. When I mentioned that magnetism doesn’t erase flash memory the response was \"I'm not sure but that’s what they tell us to say\"\n\nA: I just picked up my iPad off a shelf and it was behind a speaker. Half the screen is damaged. Let this be proof magnets will damage your iPad mini.\n\nA: My iPad air just stopped working after being in my therapy bag with magnets(children's toys) for three days. There were not problems prior.  If it wasn't the magnets it's a strange coincidence.

I normally have a lot of USB devices that I need to have plugged in so when I got my Macbook Pro I just continued to use my mouse plugged into my USB hub along with my other devices. But recently I was out somewhere and I just wanted to bring my mouse along with me and when I plugged the wireless dongle straight into the usb port it wouldn't recognize my mouse. I messed around with settings and tried to reinstall the drivers but that didn't work. When I got home I plugged it back into my USB hub and it worked. It's not really a big inconvenience but it's kind of strange and I'd like to fix it. Has anyone else experienced this or know of a solution? \n\nA: I have a brand new mid-2012 Macbook Pro i7 15\", which I bought on 12-23-2012. I was using my bluetooth mouse but the secondary button wasn't working accurately in one of my applications, so I switched to my trusty Microsoft Wireless Mobile Mouse 4000. When I plugged the dongle into the USB 3.0 port, I got an error that said my laptop keyboard needed to be identified (?!). I couldn't get it 'identified' until I turned off my Bluetooth option.

Post upgrade my desktop background isn't no longer changing. The background will not change when I try and select a different background via system preferences. Even if I reset it to the default background the same behavior persists. My system has exhibited this problem for almost 7 months now, I have this ugly plain blue background I cannot look at any more. Can anyone offer a solution that might resolve this?\n\nA: Try deleting /Users/username/Library/Preferences/com.apple.desktop.plist\nThen, empty your trash and reboot.  This file stores the preferences for desktop wallpaper and deleting it will give you a clean slate.  Your system should default to the standard Mountain Lion wallpaper.\n\nA: Open Terminal (Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app) and paste this command\nrm ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Desktop.plist\n\npress 'return' on the keyboard.\nLog out, log back in again. Change the wallpaper to what you want. Log out, log back in once more to test.\nAny improvement?\n\nA: My steps (on El Capitan 10.11.2):\n\n\n*\n\n*Deleted com.apple.desktop.plist- problem persisted\n\n*Replaced /System/Library/CoreServices/DefaultDesktop.jpg (req. disabling System Integrity Protection here) - problem persisted\n\n*Repaired permission for /System/Library/CoreServices/DefaultDesktop.jpg as detailed here - problem SOLVED (can choose new desktop image via Sys Pref. as normal)\n\nA: Note that you have to delete the com.apple.desktop.plist file as another user. Otherwise, the original settings will be restored from cache.\n\nA: By any chance have you performed a repair permissions using disk utility lately? Perhaps there is a problem with the OS accessing the files it needs. \n\nA: The easiest fix for this is to just go into your desktop and screen saver settings, under the system preferences tab, and click on the \"change picture\" button. Then it should allow you to set the background to what you want again.\n", "Q: Smart Folder containing AACs that aren't Apple Lossless My iTunes library has well over 25,000 tracks in it, and so I have to use this workaround in order to use iTunes Match. sigh Fine. So I've created the dummy library, and now I have to populate it with the tracks that I want to sync with iTunes Match. I don't want to do this track-by-track, so I'd like to create a Smart Folder of tracks that I can then import into the dummy library.\nI want to sync my AAC files, but not my Apple Lossless files (because I don't want iTunes Match replacing the Apple Lossless files with the lower-quality iTunes Store versions). But when I create a new Smart Folder and specify the Kind to be Music and the codec to be AAC, it includes both the AAC files (which I want) and the Apple Lossless files (which I don't want).\nHow can I create a Smart Folder containing just AAC files that aren't Apple Lossless files?\nUpdate: Here are some screen shots:\nThese are the current Smart Folder settings:\n\nAnd here's the info for two tracks, both of which are Curtis Mayfield's \"(Don't Worry) If There's A Hell Below We're All Going To Go\", the first one encoded as a 256 kbps AAC, the second as an Apple Lossless (For the curious, I rip my CDs as Apple Lossless for listening through my home stereo and then convert them to 256 kbps AAC for use on my capacity-limited iPhone).\nHere's the AAC version:\n\nAnd here's the Apple Lossless version.  Note the much larger file size:\n\nSo: As you can see from the Smart Folder settings screen shot, both of these files are included in the Smart Folder, even though only one of them is actually an AAC.  The thing is, both AACs and Apple Lossless files have a .m4a extension, despite the fact that they're different codecs.  From Wikipedia:\n\nApple Lossless data is stored within an MP4 container with the filename extension .m4a. This extension is also used by Apple for lossy AAC audio data in an MP4 container (same container, different audio encoding). However, Apple Lossless is not a variant of AAC (which is a lossy format), but rather a distinct lossless format that uses linear prediction similar to other lossless codecs.\n\nHope that helps, and thanks in advance for any insight you can offer.\n\nA: When you create your Smart Folder, Set Kind to Music » All\nThen, add an additional field. When prompted for what you are searching for in the first column, select \"Other\" then pick \"Codecs\" from the drop-down list:\n\nThe resulting Smart Folder should include AAC files but not Apple Lossless ones.\n\n", "Q: Possible to send an image from Preview app to Adobe Photoshop? I would like to have a button or configurable keyboard shortcut to send the image in active Preview app to Adobe Photoshop.\nIt will also be useful if I can specify which version of Photoshop to open with.\nDoes anyone know how?\nUsing OS X Mountain Lion.\n\nA: My recommendation isn't a keyboard shortcut, but an easy way to send files between applications. Simply grab your file's icon at the title bar (proxy icon) and drop it on the app's dock icon (doesn't matter if the application is closed or open):\n\nSubsequently your app will open (launch if the app is closed) and open the given image. \n\nIt works on all sorts of apps with all sorts of files.

Hope it's useful!\n\nA: If Photoshop is in your Dock, you can drag the Proxy icon (the small document icon that appears next to the document name in the title bar) and drop it on the Photoshop icon in your Dock (or, if you have multiple versions of Photoshop in your Dock, drop it on the one you want).\n\n\nA: \nFull instructions here\nhttp://osxandioshelp.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Send-Image-from-Preview-to-Photoshop.jpg\nIt would be cool if we have an icon or contextual menu to do that. \n", "Q: Turning off hibernate on a mid 2012 MacBook Pro with an SSD I've been reading several articles on the Internet how to \"optimize your Mac with an SSD\".  I'm not sure whether or not to agree with the articles because I think that Apple knows what's the best settings for a computer with an SSD drive. My question is: should I be worried about disabling hibernate to \"save\" my SSD from wear?\nI also heard that the user's home folder (as well as the Application folder, and temporary items) be stored on a RAM disk/spinning hard drive to improve the life of the SSD. I personally think this is a bit overkill, because I don't see why Apple would sell SSDs if people had to do all of this extra configuration.\nEdit: here is a seven year update using my SSD as normal, including hiberation on, and using my SSD as a temporary storage location for backing up my 2TB and 4TB hard-drives, anti-virus on, installing hundreds and hundreds of apps (and then uninstalling them), running countless virtual machines, and finding out later that a malfunctioning internet radio app wrote 1TB to my SSD over a year. I did not baby it at all; I just used it as normal:\n\n\nAdditionally, I had it partitioned into 64GB/64GB, with only one partition being actively used (Windows) for two years. I then unpartitioned it a couple of years later. Given that this is a bad scenario in terms of wear (was not able to spread it across the other unused 64GB), it has aged fairly well. There are 100 re-allocated sectors, but if each sector is 512kb, then that's 5mb that I can't use, which isn't too bad.\n\nA: Although this is an old question, I would like to update it with my answer because it is still relevant to me.\nhttp://blog.alutam.com/2012/04/01/optimizing-macos-x-lion-for-ssd/#hibernation\nsudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0\nsudo rm /var/vm/sleepimage\n\n\nWe do not recommend modifying hibernation settings. Any changes you make are not supported. If you choose to do so anyway, we recommend using one of these three settings. For your sake and mine, please don’t use anything other 0, 3, or 25.\n  hibernatemode = 0 (binary 0000) by default on supported desktops. The system will not back memory up to persistent storage. The system must wake from the contents of memory; the system will lose context on power loss. This is, historically, plain old sleep.\n  hibernatemode = 3 (binary 0011) by default on supported portables. The system will store a copy of memory to persistent storage (the disk), and will power memory during sleep. The system will wake from memory, unless a power loss forces it to restore from disk image.\n  hibernatemode = 25 (binary 0001 1001) is only settable via pmset. The system will store a copy of memory to persistent storage (the disk), and will remove power to memory. The system will restore from disk image. If you want “hibernation” – slower sleeps, slower wakes, and better battery life, you should use this setting.\n\n\nA: That’s just paranoia. Hibernate mode is perfectly healthy for an SSD. A SSD will last about 2-4 years of continuous writes. This means the time for which the SSD is powered. I have a 4 year old computer and its HD has been powered for 1.5 years (according to disk utility). Your SSD can definitely last a longer time.\n\nA: I actually prefer SmartSleep. Using this little app gives you the best of both worlds. When you sleep your Mac (close the lid), SmartSleep will decide based on your remaining battery capacity whether to write the hibernation image or not. This is useful, because if you ever find yourself in a tricky situation, where your battery runs out, you will not loose your data.\nI have been using SmartSleep ever since I had a SSD (2-3 years now) and really appreciate it. It also offers some nice shortcuts, like caffeinate or instant hibernation.\n", "Q: Is it safe to eject my timemachine backup whilst its decrypting? I encrypted my Time Machine backup (A Western Digital 2tb external drive) then realised that Airport wont mount the backup over wifi, so am currently decrypting the drive (via Disk Utility).\nI found the command:\ndiskutil cs list\n\nwhich shows me the progress of the operation (it took a while to register at the under the the menu-bar icon).\nHere's a snippet from the output:\n    Sequence:               13\n    Encryption Status:      Unlocked\n    Encryption Type:        None\n    Encryption Context:     Present\n    Conversion Status:      Converting\n    Has Encrypted Extents:  Yes\n    Conversion Direction:   backward\n\nEncrypting the backup took about 24 hours, and the time machine icon currently shows 'Decryptig Backup Disk (28%)'.\nMy question is: can I eject the drive without losing the backup?  Will the decryption continue when I mount the drive again?\nTIA, Tim\n\nA: I had to leave, so took a punt and ejected my drive. Timemachine took up where it left off when I remounted the drive, no problems!\n\nA: I would say no - I ejected a decrypting drive (it was decrypting due to me not ticking \"encrypt\" when adding it back to the computer and it then starting to decrypt) and on reconnection it a/ does not appear and b/ in Time Machines Preferences reports 0 bytes.\nIn disk utility the drive is detected, the logical volume is greyed out and will not mount.\n", "Q: When streaming movies online, should I keep the computer on the charger? I watch a lot of movies streaming online. Should I keep my computer on the power cord, or should I charge the unit completely, remove the power cord, then wait till it gets to a low battery and plug it in again?\nMy main concern is that if I keep it plugged in, it will degrade the life of the battery, but if I keep plugging and unplugging, it will cycle through the battery life anyways.\nMy question is essentially: Should I keep it on the charger when doing something that would cause the battery to drain faster than normal?\n\nA: To get the most out of your MacBook's battery, follow the Notebook Battery advice from Apple: unplug and use your battery until empty about once a month, then charge back up to full. Your question expands a bit on another question on the site about general charging:\nShould I disconnect my MacBook Pro's power cord when the battery is fully charged?\nIn your case, streaming video is usually a high power usage event that can drain a battery in 4 or 5 hours. You will therefore be more likely to have a higher recharge cycle count than someone that isn't using as much power. For that reason, I would try to keep it plugged in when running. Everything is a balance, and it would be hard to reach the 1000 recharge cycles design lifetime of the new batteries in Apple portables - but as long as you are once a month draining it down, you might be better off keeping it on power the rest of the time it runs just in case you reach that limit before you are done with using the Mac.\n\nA: Well, Apple does not recommend leaving your portable plugged in all the time, as for a lithium-based battery, it's important to keep the electrons in it moving occasionally. MacBook / Pro, though, are designed to deliver up to 1000 full charge and discharge cycles before it reaches 80% of its original capacity. \nA charge cycle means using all of the battery’s power, but that doesn’t necessarily mean a single charge. For instance, you could listen to your iPod for a few hours one day, using half its power, and then recharge it fully. If you did the same thing the next day, it would count as one charge cycle, not two, so you may take several days to complete a cycle. Each time you complete a charge cycle, it diminishes battery capacity slightly.\nSince 2009-2010 laptops carry a technology called Adaptive Charging which basically is a chip within the battery that talks to its cells monitoring everything from charge level to temperature. The chip relays this information to the computer, which uses an advanced algorithm to determine the optimal charging current. Adaptive Charging reduces the wear and tear on the battery giving it a lifespan of up to 5 years.\nSo, I'll actually won't worry that much about the battery. Just try not to keep it plugged all the time, and remember to do a full charge cycle at least once per month.\n", "Q: There is no connected camera message with built in FaceTime camera Anyone run into \"There is no connected camera\" message while using any of the camera applications (Messages, PhotoBooth, Skype, etc.)? I tried force quitting all the applications that use the camera but with no luck. Even tried sudo killall VDCAssistant without any luck. Restarting the machine fixes the issue, but it is highly annoying to do so every day. I am running 10.8.1 on 2012 MacBook Pro.\n\nA: If the issue is not Application-specific, nor User-specific, and your computer clearly recognizes the iSight, you should try reseting the SMC.\nTo do so, just:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down the computer.\n\n*Plug in the MagSafe power adapter to a power source, connecting it to the Mac if its not already connected.\n\n*On the built-in keyboard, press the (left side) Shift+Control+Option and the power button at the same time.\n\n*Release all the keys and the power button at the same time.\n\n*Press the power button to turn on the computer.\n\n\nA: From osxdaily:\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit all open apps that may try to use the FaceTime camera\n\n*Open Terminal, found in the /Applications/Utilities directory in OS X\n\n*Enter the following command string exactly, then hit return:\nsudo killall VDCAssistant\n\n\n*Enter the administrator password when requested, this is required to execute a command with superuser privileges as prefixed by sudo\n\n*Relaunch the app that was attempting to use the camera\n\n\nOr...

Would love to know if there is a way to switch all my current Terminal.app tabs to a different profile on the fly.\nThe use-case being to change Terminal profile from a dark to a light theme, and vice versa, depending on a user's current mood/preference. This can be achieved manually by right clicking on a Tab header and choosing \"Inspect tab\", and then changing the theme for each tab.\nThe other option is to close down all the open tabs and reopen them with a new theme, again suboptimal IMHO.\nHope someone has a better way :)\n\nA: Create an AppleScript like this one, and call it something like TerminalNightMode:\ntell application \"Terminal\"\n    set current settings of tabs of windows to settings set \"Pro\"\nend tell\n\nYou can replace the \"Pro\" setting with the setting name of your choice. When you run this AppleScript, it will change the settings for all the tabs in all windows. I recommend putting this script on the dock for easy access. Likewise, you can make another script for day mode. \n", "Q: Work-around for the absence of \"save-as\" in OS X 10.7 Is there a more convenient work-around for Apple's decision to drop the \"save as\" command than clicking on duplicate, then save the copy which then displays the file structure?\nI have tried the app \"Default Folders\" and it does not solve the problem (at least in my hands).\n\nA: I'm afraid not. You could, though, add a shortcut to the Duplicate command, to make it more like the Save as. To do so just:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences / Keyboard / Keyboard Shortcuts.\n\n*Select Application Shortcuts and click the add button.\n\n*Set it to All Applications and enter Duplicate as Menu Title. It's case sensitive, so make sure it's written with a capital D.\n\n*Choose a keyboard shortcut and hit Add.\n\n\nMountain Lion, by the way, has the Save As command back. Holding down Option while clicking the File menu, will turn the Duplicate command into Save as....\n\nA: Sometime between when this question was asked and macOS 13, the shortcut was restored.\nTo replicate Save As...:\n\n*\n\n*Press ⌘ + ⇧ + S or File > Duplicate\n\n*Press ⌘ + S or File > Save...\n\nYou will now have a file save dialog you can complete to save the copy\n", "Q: View PDF on iPad from Windows 7 over WiFi I have a home fileserver running Windows 7.

I tried to read the Goodreader docs and could not find much information without buying it on the iPad. Can someone help?\n\nA: Run a web-server on it.\nLook here and choose one you would like or even here for smaller ones\nThen put PDF in web server directory or designate current one in webserver configuration.\nAfter that you'll be able to use just Safari to read that PDFs\n", "Q: Select text in a Quick Look window?

Anyone know how to prevent this?\n\nA: Several things could cause this, but you could eliminate or reduce the chance by doing any or all of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off all networking before sleeping.\n\n*Reduce the refresh time period for that calendar to avoid it refreshing while the system is waking or getting re-connected with an available network.\n\n*Quit Calendar before sleeping.\n\n*Move the calendar to another hosting site (assuming it's not really the Mac that's causing the http error.)\n\n", "Q: How can I type a § in a Microsoft Remote Desktop Connection window? How can I type a \"§\" in a Microsoft Remote Desktop Connection (RDC) window? I am using the OS X client software to connect remotely to a computer running Microsoft Windows. In OS X Option ⌥+6 produces the symbol I want to be sent to the remote computer.\n\nA: Here is the easiest  way to do this. You can copy and paste characters and text between the Mac and the remote Windows session.\nOn the Mac, open a word processor and type Option-6 to get the \"§\" character.\nCopy this character.\nClick on the Microsoft Remote Desktop Client window, click in a word processor on the Windows computer you are connecting to, and Paste. The \"§\" character will be pasted into your word processor document.\nIf on the other hand you want to learn how to type various special characters on Windows while using Microsoft Remote Desktop Client on a Mac, here is what you must do.\nIf you don't want to memorize Windows character codes (such as Alt-0167 as @OghmaOsiris explained above) you can select an alternate software keyboard layout on the Windows computer.

I am running OS X Lion/10.7.4 and have set up a network disk hosted on an Ubuntu server using directions I found online. Time Machine recognizes the disk and backs up to it. However it backs up as sparsebundle \"bands\" files. I would like to be able to read the backed-up files from the Ubuntu server. \nIs there any way to tell Time Machine to back up to regular files instead of using sparsebundle/bands files?\n\nA: I found a github project a short time ago, which handles the \"read the backed-up files\" part of this question:\nhttps://github.com/torarnv/sparsebundlefs\nThat is good enough for my purposes.\n", "Q: how to track the pid of a process using mDNSResponder?

I type in the passphrase and check the box to remember it. I then connect ok to the server but then the next time I get prompted again and so on...\nI have a private key to ssh into my server and the connection works.

To be clear, I can 're-add' to keychain every time and connect but this defats the purpose. The permissions on my dsa key are set at 600 or -rw-------@\nI tried repairing disk permissions but that did no good. My Google-foo is also failing me, nothing of use came up. So I am not sure if this an OS X / keychain issue or an SSH issue. \nupdate:\nWhen I try ssh -vvv myhost, I think it reveals the issue:\ndebug1: Trying private key: /Users/danny/.ssh/mykey_dsa\ndebug1: PEM_read_PrivateKey failed\ndebug1: read PEM private key done: type <unknown>\ndebug3: Not a RSA1 key file /Users/danny/.ssh/mykey_dsa.\ndebug1: read PEM private key done: type DSA\nIdentity added: /Users/danny/.ssh/mykey_dsa (/Users/danny/.ssh/mykey_dsa)\ndebug1: read PEM private key done: type DSA\ndebug3: sign_and_send_pubkey\ndebug2: we sent a publickey packet, wait for reply\ndebug1: Authentication succeeded (publickey).\n\n... and after that I get connected. I think this crux of the matter is:\nPEM_read_PrivateKey failed\n\nUpdate 2:\nAfter trying the same key and settings on another Mac with 10.6.8 as well, everything worked fine so I think this is a Mac specific question, possibly a permissions keychain issue. \nUpdate 3\nI also tried a clean install of Mountain Lion (10.8.1) and alas the same issue which I totally don't get. \nPossibly related:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/3518441?start=0&tstart=0\nUpdate 4\nThis is the answer\n\nA: Answer copied from https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/26252/17690\n\nMake sure you have a corresponding id_rsa.pub or id_dsa.pub in your ~/.ssh directory.\nWhen I had an id_rsa but not a corresponding id_rsa.pub, Mac OS X kept popping up the dialog and remember passowrd in my keychain did nothing.\ncd ~/.ssh\nssh-keygen -y -f id_rsa > id_rsa.pub\n\ngenerated the appropriate public key file for me.\nIf you already had your public file there (rename it to another name) and generate the public key again using the above command, you'll notice that the generated and the old one are not equal. Somehow the older versions of Mac OS X generated a public key that Lion does not like anymore, generating it again fixes that.    \nFor the curious, the key is exactly the same, the part that changes is that there is no \"comments\" section after the key on the file any longer.\n", "Q: Do I need to make my Windows 8 install disk bootable when using boot camp?

So I have been using that as my theta.\nBut I would love to know how to type Theta for a mac?\n\nA: The only way I know is as follows (and I presume you are working with a US/UK keyboard):\nSystem Preferences > Language and Text > Input Sources.\nScroll down and enable Greek (or Greek Polytonic).\nCheck Show Input menu in menu bar.\n\nWhen you want to type a θ (theta), switch the menu item to greek.\n\nType u or U. Change back to your original language.\nI hope this helps.\n\nA: In System Preferences, select Keyboard, then again select Keyboard, check the \"Show Keyboard and Character Viewer in menu bar\" option. \nUse the drop-down menu from the menu bar and select Show Character Viewer - there will be a short list that Apple thinks we will use. In the upper-left-hand corner there is a sprocket with a drop-down menu: select Customize List. Scroll down to European Alphabetic Scripts, click the arrow down to open that list, select the Greek check box, then choose Done. \nGreek will now be displayed in the list on the left. Select Greek in the list, highlight the theta character in the center, choose your variation, then scroll down and you will find Font Variations of the selected character. \nAfter you have decided which variation you would like to use click Add To Favorites. A new list name will show up under Recently Used called Favorites. When this is selected it will only show the favorites you have added.\n\nA: If you are using Lion or Mountain Lion then just press and hold the 'o' key and a list of o's with accents will appear with a number underneath. Then just type the number for the character you want or click on it. Just like the iPhone works.\n\nYou can also use the procedure from this other question to add a theta character to the press-and-hold menu.

Edit carefully or make backups.\nNow, when you press and hold 't' this appears:\n\nThen click θ or press 1 to have a \"θ\" inserted into your document.\nI did not have to relog after making edits. \n\nA: You can achieve this another way: You can add your own substitutions using Apple's symbol and text substitution in the text tab of Language and Text of System Preferences. I found it very simple and straightforward.\n\nJust as a test, I chose to substitute \"o-\" with \"θ\". You can use anything you want to substitute with anything you want. It's the same system that substitutes a typed 1/2 for ½.\n\nA: If you are using Microsoft word you can use auto correct to make the ø symbol into the theta symbol. using the toolbar at the top of your screen click 'insert' and then 'symbol'\nproceed to select the symbol that you want and then click 'AutoCorrect...' and you can make Word automatically change ø to theta.\n\nA: in ms word, go to word preferences then equations then math autocorrect. There will be a list of recognized functions and the key combinations for lots of different symbols. At the top of the screen there is an option to use math autocorrect rules outside of math regions, select this.\n\nA: I do a LOT of math answers online such as Yahoo!Answers where I have to enter both Greek letters like θ, but also , √, ±, ≥, ℉, superscripts x² and subscripts H₂O, etc.\nI do this in 2 ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*I use Keyboard and Emoji viewer in the Menu bar. \nThe setup is: System Preferences, Keyboard, check the box \"Show keyboard and emoji viewers in menu bar. \n\n\nTo use, click on the icon, select 'show Emoji and Symbols'. Select Greek and theta for θ. I put those I use a lot into my '★ Favorites'.  I leave the Character box 'up and showing' so I can select symbols immediately.\nTechnique 1 above works EVERYWHERE, including in Word.  \n\n\n*The second way is to use the Mac built-in text substitutions. Again in System Preferences, Keyboard, select the text tab. I have entered all the Greek letters such as '!a' (which is exclamation a) for α, and '!t' (exclamation t) for Greek Theta θ. As I type (in most programs) it immediately substitutes one for the other.  Does not work in Word. \n\n\nIn conclusion, I prefer the text substitution method (if it works). I even put in my name as ',j' and it types in my name Jim, email as ',e', ',p' for phone number, etc. but use what makes sense to you.  BUT, it doesn't work everywhere, for those apps & programs I use the Symbol Viewer.\nIf ANYONE wants my Keyboard Text Substitution.plist, let me know. You simply drop it into the Keyboard Text area and it adds mine to your list.  \nIf you enter a bunch of Keyboard Text Substitutions, SAVE THEM. It's very very easy! Do a 'Command A' to select them all, then drag the selection to the desktop. It will make a plist file!!!  A LOT of people have issues retaining the Text list, so save it after any changes.\n\nA: hold in alt(or option) and shift, then press O (the letter)\n\nA: Ι use command and v on the keyboard.

Any Ideas?\nI'm very comfortable at the shell level, solutions using the commandline are welcome.\n\nA: There is no way to make App Store output debugging info, all debugging info is that what you see in the Console logs.\nApp Store doesn’t “detect” that it is on Mountain Lion. Mountain Lion 10.8.0 ships with a different version of App Store that is unique to that version. In addition to this, App Store may check the SystemVersion.plist file to determine on which version it is running.\niWork and Mountain Lion don’t appear in the Purchased tab of App Store, because you did not purchase them through the App Store.\nAs for the App Store not detecting the 10.8.1 update, that is a problem even I have had (With Xcode, though). About 3 days after the update disappeared, it reappeared. I never found out the cause of the problem. \n", "Q: In Finder, directory size is not shown I linked Mail.app to my Gmail account and to my surprise it downloaded all of the 300000+ (!) messages that are on it (I looked in the Preferences for a way to limit the amount of messages downloaded but to no avail, if anybody has any directions on that please post them in a comment).\nSince Mail.app refused to delete the messages in the mailbox I did not need, I wanted to check how much space on my disk all of those messages take.\nI located the folder containing all my emails at /Users/gabriele/Library/Mail/V2/IMAP-*****/*****.mbox/*****.im.mbox which contains another folder with all of the messages I don't want but I'm forced to keep.\nI showed the information for this folder but instead of the file size, it only said --:\n\nAt first I thought it might mean that it's still calculating so I let it sit, but it's been there for about 10 minutes now and it's still just two dashes.\nWhat does it mean? How can I show the size of this folder?\n\nA: In Finder press Cmd-J to access display options:\n\nThe option is set individually per folder. If you want it applied by default, click the button at the bottom. Calculation folder sizes make take a long time though for big folders.\nAlternatively you can open Terminal.app, type du -sm (followed by a Space), drag the folder you want to know to size of into the Terminal window and press Enter. Takes some time as well and gives you the size in Megabytes.\n", "Q: Are Boot Camp drivers for thunderbolt to gigabit ethernet available? I have a Retina MacBook Pro with Mountain Lion and Boot Camp with Windows 7 and the Boot Camp 4.0 drivers. I'm also using the Thunderbolt to Ethernet adapter.\nMy problem is that my ethernet port (aka wired connection) is not available in Windows' Control Panel > Network & Internet > Network Connections. Only Bluetooth and Wireless are available. When I try to set up a connection, the only options are wireless and Broadband (PPPoE).\nDo I need to download a specific driver to get ethernet working?\n\nA: First of all, connect the adapter and reboot. In many cases, it will solve the problem. You need to reboot because the adapter is not hot-pluggable. For the same reason, if you remove and re-insert the adapter, it won't work until you reboot.\nIf you still have difficulties, I've found driver information while looking at the Thunderbolt to Gigabit Ethernet Adapter page at Apple Store.\n\nGoogle \"broadcom driver windows netxtreme\". Select the netxtreme I\n  Desktop/Mobile driver.  Install via device manager (select location\n  where you unzipped driver).  Note, the PCI ID for this device\n  14e4:1682 is not listed in Broadcom's web page list of supported IDs.\n  However the driver's .inf does include the requisite matching for the\n  new device ID.\n\nHopefully, you can solve this with a reboot due to it not working as a hot-plug device, and each time you need to boot Windows with the adapter attached for the driver to load.\n\nA: Given the correct answer from iskra, here is a workaround I finally came to: set up Parallels Desktop (yes, it's not free) and use Thunderbolt for Bootcamp when Windows is run under Parallels. As long as network connection is set up in Parallels as Shared, effectively it makes Thunderbolt adapter hot-unpluggable for Bootcamp even within a single boot session. Parallels gives only a fraction of memory (normally not more than a half or 2GB) and only part of CPU power, but in some scenarios that's I can live with. \n", "Q: Why is my \"Encrypt backups\" option greyed out for local (USB) time machine disc? I'm using Mountain Lion on a new MacBook Pro (retina) with a local USB drive for backup. From what I've read searching around (including other questions on here) I should be able to encrypt my time machine backup on this local USB drive, but the option is greyed out.\nThe USB drive is 500.11 GB in two partitions of 251.33 and 248.77 GB - the first partition is the time machine backup drive, formatted as Mac OS Extended (Case-sensitive, Journaled). My Mac's hard drive is internal SSD 250.14 GB formatted as Mac OS Extended (Journaled). I don't know what this means, but the internal SSD and the first partition of the USB drive (time machine backup) both say YES for Owners Enabled and the second partition on the USB drive says NO.\nDoes any of this explain why \"Encrypted backups\" would be greyed out?\nWhat would I need to do to fix it?\n\nA: Make sure that your partition scheme is GUID, not Master Boot Record (MBR) or Apple Partition Map.\nTo enable encryption, the partition map must be changed to GUID. Note that this will make your drive invisible to older PCs and will wipe all of the data on the drive.\n", "Q: Can't copy into my own Public folder I can't copy into my own Public folder neither with my finder nor from terminal 'sudo cp ~/temp/gyongyinek/* ~/Public/'\nIf I execute the above command from terminal I got this:\nOperation not permitted\nIf I want to copy from finder then the crossed out mouse cursor appears suggesting that the operation is invalid...\nThis is my Public directory access flag:\ndrwxr-xr-x+  3 boti  staff     204 Jan 11  2012 Public\nIf on finder I hit Command+I then I have the following access rules:\nFetching: Read Only\nFetching: Read Only\nboti(Me): Read & Write\nstaff: Read Only\neveryone: Read Only\n\nA: I found the solution\nThe folder was locked...\n", "Q: What causes a Macbook Air (mid-2011) crazy CPU cooling since upgrading to Mountain Lion? Since I upgraded to Mountain Lion, my Macbook Air 13\" (Intel Core i5) has become extremely noisy.\nThe CPU cooler starts going crazy after just 10-20 mins of internet surfing. Before I could only make it loud and crazy when I used Xcode or similar 'heavy' apps.\nWhat I can see from the Activity Monitor, is that the securityd process is consuming 12-15% CPU at all times:\n\nDoes anyone have a workaround to solve this?\n\nA: I had similar on my late 2008 MBP 15\" after upgrading to Mountain Lion.\nI found a post about resetting the SMC controller (system management controller) to solve this and it worked a treat for me. I have a removable battery on my MBP so the process was a little different to unibody mbp's where you can't easily get at the battery. It was basically:\n\n\n*\n\n*remove power cable and battery,\n\n*hold the power button for 5 seconds.\n\n*Power up normally and see if it worked. \n\n\nFor portables without a user-serviceable battery (like your Macbook Air):\n\n\n*\n\n*plug in the power cable to mac and a power source,\n\n*press the (left side) ⇧ ⌃ ⌥ keys and the power button at the same time,\n\n*release all the keys and the power button at the same time.\n\n*Power up normally.\n\n\nGive it a try - there are plenty of posts on the web on how to reset it. Mine is quiet as a mouse now\n", "Q: How to open a file in the default application for it directly from QuickLook? Is there a way to open a file straight from QuickLook?\nI have a directory containing symlinks to the PDF files I usually refer to. I cannot copy the files locally and I must use symlinks. When I need to open one of the files, I can't rely on Finder icon previews as these do not show for symlinks (I think that's absurd, don't you? Is there any reason why they would not?). Not knowing how to pick the file I am interested in, I select them all and press Option + Space. Immediately following Option + Space, I press Command + Enter and finally see them all tiled across the screen (Note: Command + Enter is not bound in Finder as far as I can see, why not allow users to press that directly?).\nOnce I choose the file I want, with the mouse or the arrow keys, I don't see how I could open just that file in the corresponding application (say: Adobe Reader).\nThat, to me, is dumbfounding. Command + O opens ALL files I selected to begin with but I think QuickLook should allow for opening the file currently being previewed with a UI element or a keystroke, shouldn’t it? It is so strange that it almost can't be, maybe I am just missing the obvious... in that case I apologise.\nFor the record, I am running OS X Snow Leopard 10.6.8.\n\nA: Quick Look windows have had a button for opening files since Lion:\n\nThey're not shown in the full screen slideshow windows though. Holding or secondary-clicking (but not control-clicking) the button shows a menu for selecting other applications.\n", "Q: Script to turn flagged emails into reminders I am looking for a script that will recognize when an email is flagged and then turn it into a Reminder using the Reminders app.\n\nA: Well, I got the automator to filter the the flagged mail using the action [Find Mail Item (Message is marked with - flagged)]. But there isn't much you can do with the mail items except have them pop up on Mail using action [Display Mail Messages].\nThen I found a script here: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3435695?start=0&tstart=0\nthat takes mail and automatically generates reminder from Mail. \nI haven't tried it through myself. But hopefully that gives you a start.\n", "Q: Recover iTunes username (email) Using iOS 5.1.1 \nI have installed an app with an iTunes account which is not currently logged-into the 'App Store' in my iPad 2. In addition, I do not remember which username (email address) I used for that account. \nHow can I find out, in my iPad, which account was used to buy that app? \n\nA: If you sync with an iTunes library, hopefully you have authorised it with the account you used to purchase the app. If so, then the app would be in the “Apps” sidebar item. Click on it and press command+I. The General tab will tell you about which account purchased the item.\nIf you don’t sync with an iTunes library, your only option is to go to the App Store, sign in with all the accounts you know one by one, and check the purchased items for that account.\n\nA: If the app has an update available you can download that and try entering your iTunes accounts one-by-one. Trial and error.\nI do not have a sure-fire way on the iPad, but if you have a computer with iTunes installed (and perhaps even through the web), you can log into your account, check the account info and see your purchases.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: How does (stereo) sound work with Thunderbolt displays? Apple's Thunderbolt displays, I understand, have stereo speakers in them.  How does it work if you have two Thunderbolt displays plugged into your computer?\n\n\n*\n\n*Do both displays play the same sound, so you get left-and-right sound from your left display and left-and-right sound from your right display?\n\n*Do you get sound from only one, so you get left-and-right sound but only on one half of your desk?\n\n*Do both speakers in the left display become the left speaker, and both speakers in the right display become the right speaker?\n\n\nI'm curious how this works.\n\nA: Both displays show up as audio input and output devices on your Mac and you can pick one or the other to route audio in to from applications. You might be able to create an aggregate device out of them and use them as a four channel output source, but that would not turn out well sonically speaking. You can see it here.\n\n", "Q: Is there a free, actively developed IRC client for Snow Leopard? So far I've been able to find only outdated clients, which are either abandoned years ago or they are currently developed but only for newer systems, or commercial.\nIs there a free1 client actively developed for Snow Leopard?\n1 Free \"as in beer\", though, of course, I'd prefer if it was also \"as in speech\".\n\nA: \nTry Adium, which has IRC support and a lot more all free and its still under active development.

Free as in beer and free as in speech. The latest release was 2.32 (2012.07.30) -- so it's getting actively developed. I was running it on Snow Leopard just fine. As well as Lion and now Mountain Lion. Snow Leopard is the minimum OS requirement for it.\nAs for the regular update request: Snow Leopard is getting on in age now. It's two minor versions behind Mountain Lion. Expect that development for this platform is going to taper off severely at this point in time. That's just how it goes. In the case of LimeChat, the 2.30 release support Snow Leopard and it got an update in January 2012. That's hardly a dead and abandoned code line.\n\n\n\nA: Colloquy (http://colloquy.info/downloads.html) is actively developed, though not for Snow Leopard. There is an old version still available for 10.6.\n\nIt's the only IRC client I've used for any length of time and it seems to do its job fairly well, though it certainly has some quirks.\n\nA: You can use KVIrc, it is free and it received an update recently\n\nA: IRCCloud is a web service with a free tier (iOS and Android apps too). As such, it's actively developed and will run on Snow Leopard.\nI ‘wrap’ it in Fluid for some desktop client features (notifications, unread badge, etc.).\n", "Q: How can I use RSVG with ImageMagick? I'd like to use the RSVG for SVG processing in ImageMagick (the included library is fairly incomplete). RSVG is a supported delegate but needs to be installed separately.\nI've installed librsvg and its dependencies using Homebrew (no custom settings or anything like that). Running rsvg-convert manually works fine.\nInstalling ImageMagick with Homebrew doesn't auto-detect and use the RSVG library and running IM's configure script with --with-rsvg doesn't detect the library either.\nClearly something isn't talking to something else, but I can't make sense of the log messages well enough to sort it out.

You should move it to the Trash\n\nWhy is it not working?  I'm running 10.8 Mountain Lion on a MacBook Pro.\n\nA: Just tried this myself and confirmed that the executable gives the error you mentioned:\n\"JDiskReport\" is damaged and can't be opened. You should move it to the Trash.\n\nI was able to get it to run setup by Ctrl-clicking JDiskReport.app, clicking Show Package Contents and navigating to Contents/Resources/Java/jdskreport-1.4.0.jar.  Ctrl-clicking this .jar file will allow you to click Open and bypass Mountain Lion's default 'unidentified developer' error.  I did not go completely through Setup (only confirmed that it ran), so try this and let me know how it goes.\n\nA: The solution above, Show Package Contents... will also fix an 'Unable to load Java Runtime Environment.' on OS X Mavericks with Version 1.4.1 of JDiskReport.

I would like to know if it is possible to add the due date checkbox shown in my screenshots to the OS X version of Reminders. I am not looking for the notification option, just the old fashioned due date option.\nThe due date checkbox is not an option normally. \"Test item\" was created on the OS X Reminders app.\nHowever if I make one, \"Test item 2\", on iCloud.com, I have the option to add a due date. This is then changed, through iCloud, on my Mac.\nThis leads me to believe that maybe a file could be changed on my Mac to enable this option to be turned on by default.\n\n\nA: You can use AppleScript with this one-liner to create an item with the Due Date independent of the Remind Me Date:\ntell application \"Reminders\" to show (make new reminder with properties {name:\"New reminder\", due date:(current date)})\n\nOr you can use Automator to create a Service that does the same thing. That way, you can assign a keyboard shortcut to it in System Preferences. See the Services list under System Preferences… Keyboard… Shortcuts… Services.\nIn Automator, add the New Reminders Item snippet and make sure Due Date is checked. Use menu item File… Save to save the workflow in the default location (~/Library/Services/). The Service should now be visible in the Reminders application, under menu item Reminders… Services….\n\nA: Under the OS X Reminders Application you can Copy and Paste reminders. Doing so with previously created on iCloud one, will preserve the Due Date option. \n", "Q: Mountain Lion won't wake up after an extended sleep I've recently upgraded my MacBook Air to Mountain Lion. Now whenever the machine sleeps for a long time (more than two hours or so) while disconnected from the mains, it won't wake up.  I had to hold the power button to reboot the machine.\nIs there a solution to this problem?\n\nA: This is a known issue that hasn't been fixed as of 10.8.1. When Mountain Lion hibernates (either directly or as part of standby mode), it couldn't wake up and thus need to be restarted.\nThe current workarounds are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable hibernate mode.\n\n*Disable standby mode.\n\n\nI've written an article how to get around this issue by preventing OS X from hibernating.\nFor Apple folks: please see rdar://1212084 - Thanks.\n\nA: I encountered the same problem, maybe you can try the following ways to wake up your Mac.\nHold the power button for two seconds, then release the button, not until reboot. \nIf this way does not work, try this:\nAdjust the light button F2, maybe just the screen does not light.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: \"on my mac\" calendar option missing from New Calendar menu I recently did a clean install of Mountain Lion (upgrading from Lion). Exported my calendars to a \"Calendar Archive\" on Lion and then imported them on Mountain Lion.\nMaybe I broke something, but I don't see a way to add new calendars \"on my mac\". The only option i have in File | New Calendar is \"iCloud\" (which is not what i want). Is there a preference I'm missing somewhere?\nA possibly related problem: syncing with iCloud seems to be broken. I get a triangle alert icon to show there has been a problem (but there is no clue what the problem is). I spent and hour on Google hunting but couldn't find a place to look for logged error messages.\n\nA: Apparently you'll have to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable iCloud by going to Calendar > Preferences > Accounts. It seems important just to disable iCloud from Calendar's preferences, not completely sign out of it from within System Preferences.\n\n*Create a new calendar which name does not conflicts with any calendars you've already got in your iCloud.\n\n*Enable your iCloud account.\n\n\nThis will make the new calendar, under On My Mac to remain. \n\nA: Another option is to open the Automator app, Once inside of it, search for add calendar  and add it to the right canvas aria. Then name the calendar anything and set it to create “on my mac”. Click the play button at the top of the window. Go back to calendar and the “on my mac” should  be back there again. As long as you  have more than zero calendar at a time under on my mac , it should stay there. \n", "Q: Encrypt existing unencrypted Time Capsule backup Since Mountain Lion Time Capsule can now backup to encrypted sparsebundles. This is great and easy to setup for new backup locations, just select 'encrypt backups'. However, I have backups for around a year now that I want to keep. If I go through the setup, I can only erase the current (unencrypted) backup and start over, or keep using the current (unencrypted) backup. So how can I work around this issue and encrypt my existing backups?\n\nA: The only solution I can offer is to use Disk Utility to create an encrypted sparsebundle, then copy the contents of the existing backup disk into the sparsebundle. This is essentially what Time Machine does.\nThen, select a new backup disk in Time Machine and select the sparsebundle. If all works according to plan, Time Machine will ask for your password and begin using the new sparsebundle.\n\nA: Here is a solution\nhttps://www.howtogeek.com/305540/how-to-encrypt-your-macs-time-machine-backup/\nBasically you remove the existing target and re-add it and the select Encrypt.\nHowever, the article is covered by copyright so I can't copy it into this answer but it archived in the Wayback Machine in case it ever disappears.\n", "Q: Would a 2.6 Ghz CPU drain a laptop's battery faster than a 2.3 Ghz CPU? Apple offers the MacBook Pro with two processor options -- 2.3 Ghz and 2.6 Ghz.\nI'm wondering if the more powerful CPU drain the battery more quickly by any significant degree.\n(And incidentally, would additional RAM consume additional power?)\n\nA: If everything else was equal (CPU architecture, generation, manufacturing process, OS, power management strategy, software running etc.) the answer is maybe. Modern CPUs like the i3/i5/i7 series downclock themselves when idle so it depends what you're doing and what the actual CPUs are. If everything is as equal as you can make it and you compare CPUs of identical generation, one with maximum clock speed higher than the other and you are using the CPUs to their maximum capacity - then the more powerful CPU does drain the battery faster - but it gets more work done in the same time too, and might get back to the idle state faster. \nYou can only really answer this question if you test your exact scenario.\n", "Q: How to move the Downloads folder (in Mountain Lion) to another disc I want the \"Downloads\" folder not on the system drive but on my second internal drive. \nIn Lion I just deleted the \"Downloads\" folder and replace it with an alias with the same name (pointing to the folder on the second drive ofc). \nIn ML I get \"\"Downloads\" can't be modified or deleted because it's required by Mac OS X\". \nHow to delete the folder? Can I change the permissions first to be able to delete it? \nAny help much appreciated. \n\nA: I'd encourage you not to mess with permissions.\nYou can create a new folder on the other drive (or use any other folder that you prefer) and use Safari preferences to set the new folder as the destination for  downloaded files to be placed.\n\nA: It is possible to do this from within the Terminal.

I have a Macbook Pro with Mac OS X 10.7, and an external display screen attached to my Macbook, which is working fine.\nSometimes, I have to switch the second display to a projector (because I want to give a presentation).\nThose settings (e.g. arrangement, resolution) are different from my external display screen. In 90% of the cases, Mac OS X knows which arrangement/resolution I want, depending on the type of external screen; in 10% of the cases, it's mixing up the configurations and I have to manually edit the configuration again.\nCan I see somewhere what configuration is attached to a certain display?\nWhy does Mac OS X mix the configuration settings between my external display screen and my projector?\n\nA: 1) You should be able to see these configurations in System Preferences > Display. I believe you go to to Layout (or could be called mirroring).\n2) OS X displays two Display panels so you know which panel is attached to which screen.\nIf the Display options don't allow you to pick a resolution, change the Resolution from \"Best for XX display\", that will allow you to pick a supported, lower, resolution.\n\nA: You might want to investigate a third-party solution.\nI would try SwitchResX (Macupdate link) as it claims to be able to save the resolution better than OS X can on it's own.\nI do not own this software.\n", "Q: AirPort Express extending AirPort Extreme wireless network: can I use WEP and WPA2 Personal? I have an AirPort Extreme home network that is extended with an AirPort Express.  Because some legacy devices within the household do not support WPA/WPA2 Personal, I would like to keep my AirPort Extreme network secured with WPA2 while allowing devices that can connect to the AirPort Express to connect via WEP.  Is this possible? (knowing in advance would certainly help, as I do not want to mess up the current configuration for the AirPort Express.\n\nA: First you can save you current configuration in Airport Utility.\nThen you have two options:\n1. If your Extreme support guest network then just set it up as WEP and extend it with Express.\n2. Or connect Express with ethernet to Extreme(i.e. just use it as gateway to internet) and setup WEP network on Express.\n\nA: This is admittedly not a full answer.  But I am going to bet that your final method is going to involve having your airport Extreme serve up two separate networks (you can configure it to serve up the 5GHZ band as a fully separate wireless network.)   But, this has the obvious disadvantage that that network will not be repeated on all the airport Expresses.\n", "Q: Why does mdworker keep spamming the logs on Lion?

The tags can be found in the AlbumData.xml written out by iPhoto for sharing use (such as Spotlight and other media sharing tools)\nWithout more information about the version of iPhoto in use, or whether you have any issues with iPhoto itself (and Spotlight's integration) there's not more more I can tell you.\n", "Q: Dragging selected text using the Three Finger gesture Mountain Lion here. I can select text using the Three finger swipe. But to drag that text (for copying into another window, for example), I have to resort to the old fashioned (:)) press-click-on-trackpad-and-drag-with-second-finger. Is there is some way I could drag the selected text via the same three finger movement (maybe by pressing some modifier key to signal that I wish to drag and not select)?\n\nA: After selecting the text, place your three fingers on the trackpad and don't drag for a half-second or so. Then, slowly drag your fingers until you see the I-beam cursor turn into the mouse pointer. Then you can three-finger drag normally. \nWhen using click and drag for text, you need to hold the click for a half-second or so before the system realizes you want to drag the text instead of selecting it. This procedure replicates that with the three-finger drag gesture. (As you get better at this place-hold-slow-fast gesture, you can speed it up to a point where you're comfortable with the speed and it still works.)\n", "Q: Lyrics sync with running audio Does anyone have any idea on how to keep text in sync with audio such that as the audio progresses, the lyrics that are being sung are what is being displayed onscreen?\nWhat I actually want, is my audio file to be playing playing and at the same time the lyrics of that audio file will be highlighted. (Similar to a karaoke machine.)\n\nA: Soundhound can show lyrics in real time.\n", "Q: tmux on mountain lion I have recently upgraded to mountain lion and every time I start a new tmux session, I get the following warning:\n│warning: unsupported new OS, trying as if it were 10.6-10.7 \nIs this anything I should be worried about?\n\nA: That message comes from my reattach-to-user-namespace wrapper program that let’s you (e.g.) access the pasteboard inside tmux. You are using an old version of the wrapper (from prior to Mountain Lion).\nThe old wrapper does work correctly under 10.8; the message just means that you are using a version from before 10.8 was available/verified. So there is nothing to worry about, but it may get annoying seeing the message every time you start a new tmux pane/window.\nTo get rid of the message, you should upgrade to a newer version of the wrapper. If you previously installed via MacPorts of Homebrew, just upgrade via that package manager. Otherwise, download the latest tagged source (or pull into your previous Git clone), rebuild it (e.g. type make), and copy it to the location that your tmux default-command setting uses.\nBoth MacPorts and Homebrew currently package the 1.1 version, which suppresses the message when running on Mountain Lion. The 2.0 version also includes the program’s name in such messages so that the source of any future messages will be more obvious.\n\nA: Nope, but try the new version (you can find it into the iTerm2 beta download package)\n", "Q: How often does Apple.com update their refurbished stock? How often does Apple.com update their refurbished stock? Is there a schedule, is it based upon product availability, or a combination of the two?\n\nA: Apparently there's no schedule, it is all based upon product availability.As soon as the product has passed all the Refurbishing steps, it's posted. What's certain is that products don't last long, so keen buyers are suggested to check every day, or even every hour.\n", "Q: Mac Terminal PATH settings \nPossible Duplicate:\nReset your PATH variable \n\nEverytime I open Terminal I need to set the PATH using:\nPATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11/bin\nOtherwise commands like 'ls' do not work. This is a pain. How do you fix the PATH so that each time you open the Terminal you don't need to set the PATH?\n\nA: You can do this by editing the .profile file in your home directory - just add your PATH command into there and it will be executed each time you open a Terminal window.\nYou can read about some other ways to do this in this question.\n\nA: One good way is to set your environment variables in /etc/launchd.conf, as shown here. Putting them in launchd.conf makes them accessible in the terminal as well as in any code you may write which uses the environment settings.\n", "Q: Are the iPad 2 30-pin cable and the iPod touch cable different? They look the same and get mixed up. My iPad 2 can't charge with the iPod's cable but vice-versa works. \nMight this iPad question apply?: Using an iPod charging cable to charge an iPad\nCan this behavior be because the iPad 2 30-pin cable and the iPod touch cable are somehow made differently? \n\nA: The USB-to-30-pin-dock cables are electrically identical. All of them can carry enough charging current for both devices. The same is not true for the power sources as the iPad gets a 10W supply and the rest 5W.\nWhat power source are you using with the cables? iPads need more power than most USB ports offer to charge with the screen on.\n\nA: The standard iPad/iPhone/iPod Touch cables are identical and interchangeable. As the Apple store item notes:\n\nThis USB 2.0 cable connects your iPhone, iPad or iPod — directly\n  or through a Dock — to your computer's USB port for efficient syncing\n  and charging or to the Apple USB Power Adapter for convenient charging\n  from a wall outlet.\n\nHowever, the chargers are different - as commenter @Mark noted, it takes a long time to charge an iPad with an iPod charger.\niPhone/iPod Touch charger specs (from Amazon):\n\nInput:110-240V 50/60Hz 1.0A, Output:5V==1A\n\niPad charger specs (from Amazon):\n\nInput: 100-240V 0.45A 50/60Hz, Output : 5.1V 2.1A 10W\n\nThe iPad charger can output twice the wattage and current of the iPod charger, so your iPad will charge a lot more slowly if you use your iPod charger (at about a quarter of the speed using the iPad charger). If your iPad is on, it may not even charge because it's power usage is higher than the iPod charger's capacity to charge, as noted in Adam's answer in the question you've quoted.\n", "Q: Can’t reboot into OS X from Boot Camp I made a partition with Boot Camp on my wife's Macbook Pro and installed Windows, however after being installed I can not find the Boot Camp control panel.\nI have looked in the control panel and the task bar. The program is simply not there. I can't get the Macbook to run OS X at all at this point, but can verify that the partition is only 40 GB in size. At this point, I don't care if I can get the partition working. I'm more worried about getting the OS X partition back up. I do not have a OS X install disk — the computer didn't come with one.\n\nA: First you should be able to boot into OS X if you press and hold the ⌥ key just after pressing the power button.\nFor the Bootcamp control panel to appear, you should install the Bootcamp drivers from Apple. Run Boot Camp Assistant to get them or try these tips.\nAlso: More on Boot Camp.\n", "Q: Can't unlock preferences - no password dialog In system preferences, if I click the \"lock\" icon to allow me to make changes as the administrator, no dialog opens.  The message \"Authenticating...\" appears momentarily, then disappears, and the lock stays locked.\nI'm on OS X 10.6.8.  \nAny idea what could cause this or how to fix it?\n\nA: I've had this same issue for months. Before it was my old MBP since \"upgrading\" from Snow Leopard to Lion, and now again on my brand new MBP with Mountain Lion.  After some digging it looks like a fairly common problem, possibly to do with CAC/ID card readers.\nAnyway, this worked for me (without a reboot!). From Terminal:\nsudo pkill -HUP securityd\n\nWhen I did this Mail apparently lost it's connection to the security framework and started prompting me for passwords; I just restarted it and it was good to go.\n\nA: It sounds as an issue either with permissions or keychains. Try repairing them both. \nTo check Keychains for problems just:\n\n\n*\n\n*Locate the Keychain Access application, under /Applications/Utilities.\n\n*Choose Keychain Access > Keychain First Aid.\n\n*Enter your User name and Password.\n\n*Select Verify and click Start. \n\n*If any problems were found, select Repair and click Start again.\n\n\nA: This issue has something to do with authd. You can just kill or force authd to quit like this (in Terminal on Mavericks):\nsudo pkill -HUP authd\n\n(when prompted, type your password.)\nJust killing securityd doesn't work on Mavericks.\n\nA: I has the same as original problem after latest update to 10.10.3\nkilling the authd as this:\nsudo pkill -HUP authd\n\nand checking with the terminal and 'ps -ef | egrep \"authd|securityd\" showed that is was restarted immediately. But this did not change the behavior.\nThen I tried the same with the target of securityd, \nsudo pkill -HUP securityd\n\nafterwards, it is still not running, but then I did not check before hand and so I don't know whether it WAS running previously. But there is a new behaviour>\nWhen I click the lock icon to unlock access to change the Sys Preferences, it does NOT respond at all - no brief message about authenticating. \nThat what I get for poking around in the dark :-)\nA system reboot will be happening as soon as convenient (reach a good stopping point).\n\nA: My Security & Privacy wouldn't unlock either. I had no password set on my account when this was happening. I went to Accounts and set an arbitrary password and I was able to finally unlock the pane. Afterward, I just reset the password back to being no password.\n", "Q: How can I access preview documents saved to iCloud from 10.8 on an iPad?  As of OS X Mountain Lion (10.8) one can move Preview documents to iCloud, how do I access these documents from my iPad?\n\nA: You unfortunately can't, there is no related application for iOS right now. Whether this is an oversight in Preview (which shouldn't be able to save into iCloud in the first place) or a hint for things to come with iOS 6 is unclear right now.\n\nA: Me Too, saved photos edited in preview and it saved them to iCloud allegedly and now i can't know where they are. Somewhere in the cloud I am guessing.\n", "Q: Is there an iOS app or jailbreak modification that can activate true caps lock? I'm using jailbroken iOS 5.1.1 and am looking for an app or setting that enables true caps lock.  Meaning, once activated, caps lock behaves like it does on a PC and stays enabled when you switch to numbers or even between apps.\nAs it is right now, caps lock is disabled when you go to the home page, switch apps, or even switch to number input.\nIf necessary, I'm willing to manually configure a custom keyboard to have capital letters in place of the default ones.  I'm even willing to downgrade the operating system for this.\nDoes something like this exist in jailbreak land or is there a hidden setting of some sort?\n\nA: To enable caps lock in iOS 5 double tap the shift key. The shift key will become blue signifying caps lock is enabled.\n\nCaps lock will be disabled if switching to other input keyboards (switching to type numbers/special characters) or applications.\nSource for answer is from a TUAW article.\n", "Q: Mail.app on 10.8: How to get back the \"N Messages Selected\" label? In OS X 10.7 Lion: Mail.app in \"classic layout\" (Preferences > Viewing > Use classic layout), would display a very helpful \"N Messages Selected\" label in the empty bottom pane when you selected multiple messages:\n\nBut in OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion, the helpful label is gone and replaced by some terrible (slow, choppy) animation of individual messages flying around and being added to a stack of overlapping messages.\nQuestion: is it possible to get the old \"N Messages Selected\" label back on OS X 10.8?\n\nA: I usually just drag the selected messages a few pixels and then let them drop back. While you're dragging them, the number of messages is shown next to the cursor.\nNot exactly the same thing, but it does the job for me.\n", "Q: How to restore hidden Library folder in Time Machine I want to restore the hidden user Library folder from Time Machine but I am unable to see it when I enter Time Machine. Read on.\nI thought the hidden Library folder would appear if I used the Terminal command to either reveal the hidden Library folder AND/OR to show all hidden files and folders. Both commands work outside of Time Machine but they don't show any hidden files or folders when I am in Time Machine space.\nIs it possible to see and/or restore the hidden Library folder in Time Machine?\nI appreciate any help? I'm stuck.\nP.S. I am using 10.8.1 if that is helpful to know. And the Time Machine backup that I am trying to restore my Library folder from was from my previous hard drive in which I was also running 10.8.1. I switched to a new hard drive.\n\nA: If you use the Finder's menu \"goto\" while holding down the Alt, the library folder is visible in the menu:\n\nSelect it. The finder shows the content of /Users/<your name>/Library. Now start Time Machine by clicking on its icon in the dock – violà, you have what you want:\n \nWhen you want to access another invisible folder that is not listed in the 'Go' list in Finder you can go to the same folder and choose for 'Go to Folder' or CommandShiftG. Here you can type in any location you want to goto.\n\n\nA: I tried using Tinker Tool and it does show the hidden Library folder but the folder has the red dot with the dash inside meaning I don't have access to it. So although a creative solution I am not able to access the contents of the Library folder.\nI used these Terminal commands:\nchflags nohidden ~/Library\n\nor\ndefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool true\nkillall Finder\n\nBoth methods show hidden files and folders but they don't work right for Time Machine.\n\nA: You can use bypass to make changes in the folders for snapshots: sudo /System/Library/Extensions/TMSafetyNet.kext/Helpers/bypass chflags nohidden /Volumes/*/Backups.backupdb/*/*/*/Users/*/Library/. bypass was in /System/Library/Extensions/TMSafetyNet.kext/Contents/MacOS/bypass on Lion.\nRelated questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Scripting the unhiding of Library folders on Time Machine disks\n\n*How to recover file from 'hidden' directory with Time Machine?\n\nA: Using Tinker Tool 4.9 I showed invisibles, then went into Time Machine.

I'm running low on hard disk space and I'd like automatically resize all images over a certain size/resolution by 50%. This is somewhat similar to how iTunes can downsample all your music files above a certain size on your iOS device.\nI'm guessing an AppleScript is necessary for this?\n\nA: There is no way to do this in iPhoto, as what you're doing is destroying data, and iPhoto is built to expressly avoid this.\nSo, File -> Export, set the Kind to Jpeg and then choose from the Quality setting as appropriate. Export the images to a folder on the desktop.\nTrash the images from iPhoto.\nImport the exported ones.\nNote some things 1: You lose your lossless editing history and Faces data at the very least. If any of the images are used in Books, Slideshows etc then these will have to be remade.\nIf space is an issue, have you considered moving the Library to a larger disk - an external, for instance? It's easy:\nMake sure the drive is formatted Mac OS Extended (Journaled)\n \n\n\n*\n\n*Quit iPhoto\n \n\n*Copy the iPhoto Library from your Pictures Folder to the External Disk.\n \n\n*Hold down the option (or alt) key while launching iPhoto. From the resulting menu select 'Choose Library' and navigate to the new location.

First login happens fine. Creates mobile account, no issues noticed.\nHowever, after I logout, the next login attempt fails, and after only shaking one time, their AD account is locked out.\nopendirectory.log makes a vague mention of account being expired but honestly I don't see much in the logs that pops out as useful.\nAny help?\n\nA: I ended up using the AD plugin from Centrify which worked fine.  I have abandoned the Apple plugin until they get their act together. Thanks!\n\nA: Would the network time server have anything to do with it? Sometimes password reset events can cause locks due to the old credentials being rejected as multiple devices hit AD, but these are new accounts? You can turn up logging on the client, and even tail the logs in realtime over ssh if you'd like less vague of a picture of what's going on.\n\nA: Interesting.  I recently had a similar experience with 10.8 and 10.8 Server with Open Directory.\nWe applied a global policy to NOT have passwords expire (there's a bug where it defaults to expiring shortly after the account is created).  That wasn't enough however: I then had to delete and re-create all of the OpenDirectory accounts.  Smooth sailing after that.\nI'm wondering if you're experiencing the same thing in AD.\n\nA: It could possibly be (in order of likelihood):\n\n\n*\n\n*AD is creating the account with a one-time-use password: Make sure to change the password upon successfully logging in for the first time.\n\n*A domain prefix might be required: OS X can be configured to imply the account's domain name, or explicitly require the account's domain name. Examples:\n\n*\n\n*A username with an implied domain name: username\n\n*A username with an explicit domain name: DOMAIN\\username or username@fully.qualified.domain.name\n\n\n*Time drift between AD server and Mac client: Make sure the sure the two machines are synched to the same time server.\n\n", "Q: How can I open a folder called something.app in various applications? For whatever reason, I created a folder on my Mac called customer.app, and it contains a python module.  I want to open that folder and it's files in applications like BBEdit and GitX, but the open dialog shows this folder as greyed out and won't let me select them.\nAre there any settings or properties I can set on this folder to tell my Mac that it is just a regular old folder?\n\nA: UPDATE: Recent versions of OS X have removed this ability. The answer below applies to OS X 10.9 or earlier.\nA simple right-click of the folder will enable you to view the contents using \"Show Package Contents.\"\nIf you're trying to access the folder from a Save/Open dialog, then try changing your view type from icons to Column mode.\n\n\nA: As others have said, a simple right click in a regular Finder window will make it possible to \"show package contents\". \nFor a file open dialog, use the \"Go to location\" functionality (⌘ Cmd+⇧ Shift+G) and type the full path to a subfolder or subfile of the package. For example...\n/Applications/Skype.app/Contents\n\nAfter doing that, you can browse around inside the folder normally.\n\nA: It is doing this due to the name of the folder, ending in .app\nApplications on Mac OS (and iOS for that matter) are actually 'app bundles', containing various resources and executables in a folder ending with .app. \nThe reason this is grayed out is because the Save/Open box would automatically filter those out. \nIn Mountain Lion on my MacBook Air, if I do the same thing by making a folder with .app at the end, it asks if you are sure you want to do it, and then won't even let you open it through Finder. Much less use and open or save dialog. \nI would recommend renaming the folder if you can. It looks like you may have to do this through Terminal. That would be just as easy as running mv customer.app customerdotapp. \nI do not know of a workaround on allowing the .app at the end of the folder name.\n\nA: In Finder you can view the contents of a folder whose name ends in .app by doing: \nCTRL+left click->Show package contents \n\nA: I know this thread is old, but am sharing in case someone stumbles across it as I did.  On my Yosemite based Mac, it appears that naming a directory with the .service extension also has the same effect.  Changing the extension name in the command line to something else allowed it to be accessed in Finder.  \nThis may be true on older Mac O/S's; I don't know for sure.  Since my folder did not have the .app extension, this thread helped me to at least try changing the extension name as a test.  I was not aware of this issue until I found this thread.  \n\nA: Some programs allow you to drag files from a finder window.\nIf that doesn't work, try shift-command-g and type the folder name (something like /Applications/program.app/Contents ) and browse from there.\nShould work in all OS versions.\n\nA: *\n\n*Type Command + Shift + G.\n\n*Type your path for the application Eg: /Applications/ReadyAPI.\n\n*Right click on the application and select show package contents.\n\nA: One application which allows you to open .app bundles is BBEdit. You just need to select open file from inside BBEDit then navigate to the application and it will show the enclosed files and allow you to open them. Other full-featured text editors presumably do the same.\nNB This does work on modern versions of MacOSX (tested on 11.2, BigSur)\n", "Q: How do preference files become corrupted? I've read a few different troubleshooting articles and Q&A's where the culprit is a corrupted preference file for an application or process. Typically the solution is to delete the bad preference file and allow a new, default preference file to be spawned upon restarting whatever software was misbehaving.\nHow does a preference file become corrupted? Is this simply a low-level read/write error, or is there a higher level error occurring in some cases? Is it just malformed or misspelled XML? \nI believe plutil could tell you if there's a syntactical error with the file, but again, how was the error introduced? I'm unclear on the usual source for these corrupted files. Thanks.    \n\nA: It can be caused by a great number of things, but I believe the most common cause is where the file is being written to, and the application terminates before it's finished writing the file. This could be caused by system overheads being too great for a successful write at the time.\nHardware errors with the hard disk, or memory could also cause data errors, but I would imagine these would be the least of your problems by this time.\n\nA: I would bet that in almost every case, there is nothing syntactically wrong with the plist file.  Apple's functions for loading and saving plist data get a lot of attention and a lot of use.  Almost every bug has surely been found and fixed by now.\n\n(Consider that plists are used for all kinds of things, like drag-n-drop and the clipboard, sandbox permissions for launching apps, the user interfaces for every app, and even which icon to display in the Finder.  It would be incredible if there was a bug in the plist-writing code which just happened to screw up preference files for some apps, but not any of these other things!)\n\nAn app's preference file (plist) is simply storing some of its in-memory data structures on disk.  So if the app has a bug that causes something to be set incorrectly, it gets saved.\nOften when an app starts misbehaving, you can simply quit it and restart. That resets many parts of it, and may fix the problem.  Preference files are reloaded from disk, though, so if the affected part of the app was saved in a persistent preference, restarting the app will have no impact: the bad value will just get loaded again.  That's when deleting the preference file can help.  It's like restarting the app, but for things that got saved.\nThese things can happen because programmers assume that the data their app has is correct.  If a color can be chosen only by the user clicking on a standard color wheel control, they probably don't do any extra work to verify that it's correct before using it.  (In comparison, an app like Safari does a ton of extra work verifying everything, because it loads and runs files straight off the internet.)\nThe upside is that it's almost always correct, and it's far easier if you assume that internal values are correct.  The downside is that if a bad value sneaks in somehow (like the user did something totally unexpected), things can go haywire until everything is reset.\n\nA: As a tech-challenged senior citizen, I found my iTunes Preference File was corrupted and caused the licensing agreement to come up every time I opened iTunes.  Plus, all my preferences had to be reset.  I believe the above answers are correct, as just before I had this issue, I was forced to do forced shutdowns of my computer (electrical issues in the area) and rebooting/half rebooting several times.  The applications terminated before instructions/writing was complete.  But the fix to spawn a new iTunes preference file was shown online and very easy to do.  It fixed the problem.\n", "Q: Is there a sane way to emulate the newer media key behavior completely on an Apple Extended Keyboard II? The operative word here being \"completely\".  I recently found a nearly flawless (cosmetically and functionally) AEKII (Alps, not Mitsumis) on eBay and won it for $30.  It's an awesome keyboard and it gives me fond memories of my typing classes in elementary school, but I hate the lack of modern media keys; I used them all the time on my wired Aluminum keyboard.\nMy current \"hack\" involves some custom AppleScripts (I've only implemented volume up/down) that I imported as Alfred Extensions and bound to some custom hotkeys, but this approach has some downsides:\n\n\n*\n\n*No system feedback; the volume overlay and sound effect don't show up.  And I'm fairly noobish when it comes to AppleScripting so I have yet to figure out if it's possible to do this.\n\n*Because it's a script and not a true hardware interrupt, things like system load can lead to delays in responding to the key presses.\n\n*I can't hold down the key to affect a continuous increase or decrease.  I have to repeatedly hit the keys to repeatedly increment or decrement the volume value.\n\n\nI'd imagine that there is a way to write an AppleScript that captures keypresses and I can use that to process a continuously depressed key, but I haven't found it worthwhile to spin a bunch of cycles trying to figure this out.\nAre there any other AEKII users out there that have found a sane way to handle special functions from the keyboard?\n\nA: You could try KeyRemap4MacBook:\n\nor FunctionFlip:\n\nIf neither works, you could also try creating a private.xml in KeyRemap4MacBook:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<root>\n<item>\n<name>Change F-keys</name>\n<identifier>0A0FE074-9C9C-43DC-8AEB-6683C5CB3259</identifier>\n<autogen>--KeyToKey-- KeyCode::F1, KeyCode::BRIGHTNESS_DOWN</autogen>\n<autogen>--KeyToKey-- KeyCode::F2, KeyCode::BRIGHTNESS_UP</autogen>\n<autogen>--KeyToKey-- KeyCode::F3, KeyCode::MISSION_CONTROL</autogen>\n<autogen>--KeyToKey-- KeyCode::F4, KeyCode::LAUNCHPAD</autogen>\n<autogen>--KeyToConsumer-- KeyCode::F5, ConsumerKeyCode::KEYBOARDLIGHT_LOW</autogen>\n<autogen>--KeyToConsumer-- KeyCode::F6, ConsumerKeyCode::KEYBOARDLIGHT_HIGH</autogen>\n<autogen>--KeyToConsumer-- KeyCode::F7, ConsumerKeyCode::MUSIC_PREV</autogen>\n<autogen>--KeyToConsumer-- KeyCode::F8, ConsumerKeyCode::MUSIC_PLAY</autogen>\n<autogen>--KeyToConsumer-- KeyCode::F9, ConsumerKeyCode::MUSIC_NEXT</autogen>\n<autogen>--KeyToConsumer-- KeyCode::F10, ConsumerKeyCode::VOLUME_MUTE</autogen>\n<autogen>--KeyToConsumer-- KeyCode::F11, ConsumerKeyCode::VOLUME_DOWN</autogen>\n<autogen>--KeyToConsumer-- KeyCode::F12, ConsumerKeyCode::VOLUME_UP</autogen>\n</item>\n</root>\n\nIt might only work if you use the external keyboard with a laptop or have another keyboard connected.

Before buying a Time Capsule it was connected to a USB port on the Mac. After purchasing a Time Capsule I attached the printer to the USB on the Time Capsule. This allows printing to the networked printer from other systems on my LAN.\nNote: prior to the Time Capsule the other systems were still able to print but had to print by connecting to the printer attached to the Mac; a different but equivalent functionality. But it seemed to be more trouble prone, requiring frequent setup of the printer on Windows machines.\nHowever, after connecting to the Time Capsule, I have lost the ability to scan, as that function is not allowed via the Time Capsule. The workaround is to swap USB cables to connect the printer directly to the Mac. So I can scan, but the cable swap is annoying, and then the other machines cannot print until the cable is swapped back.\nIs there a solution that would avoid the cable swap?\n\nA: You could connect your multifunction printer via USB to a computer and use printer sharing to enable other machines to print through it. The downside is, as you point out, it is often less reliable, and you can only print from other computers when the host computer is on.\nYou could connect through your Time Capsule. Some multifunction printers only support scanning when directly connected to a computer.\nYou could get a new wireless multifunction printer that supports scanning wireless. This requires a more sophisticated machine, as the scanned documents have to go somewhere.\nIt is possible there is a way to make your multifunction printer work as a scanner while attached to the Time Capsule, but it's a property of the device, and you didn't specify what you're using.\nSo in the absence of more information in your question, this is my answer.\n", "Q: Why do I get serious execution lag on clicks, application switching and general usage I have an MBP 8.1, early 2011, 13 inch, Mountain Lion. Whenever I leave it on for more than a couple hours, I get serious execution lag on every command. For example:\nI click something (a link, button, command, even a tab in the browser) and the rainbow wheel of death shows up. After a couple seconds, my command gets executed.\nI click on another app, and the app does the same before warming up for use - rainbow wheel of death, couple seconds of stall, revival, work.\nText edit and preview are sickeningly slow in opening the very smallest documents, so I've had to stop using them completely - the forced version control of 10.8. is not helping in the least.\nWhenever I do anything I get this rainbow wheel of death lag prior to execution, and what's interesting is the fact that\na) The CPU usage NEVER spikes above 10% (I have it on scree at all times)\nb) I actually have free RAM while doing this\nI can find no processes hogging up the machine, and there are no fatal errors in the console showing up.\nI use it for web development, so I have the following apps open at all times: a Java (I know, death to any machine) IDE running (PhpStorm), Chrome, Sparrow for mail, Twitter client and TotalTerminal. \nThat's all the apps I'm running.\nAny ideas?\nI'm willing to try anything except sending it to an Apple store for diagnostics and service.\nEdit: Additional info: This is a mint condition MBP, formatted a mere three months ago to Lion and upgraded to Mountain Lion some weeks ago. It has 4GB of RAM.\n\nFinal edit:\nI have installed Ubuntu alongside OSX, on the same hard drive. I have also installed all the apps I use on OSX. Ubuntu FLIES, the difference is enormous. Not a single lag, in clicking, rendering, indexing, nothing. Conclusion: OSX just sucks.\n\nA: Let me explain to you how RAM works. Data is loaded into RAM first, in blocks called \"pages\". That is called a “Page in”. When a piece of memory is just paged in, it is in Active or Wired Memory. Wired memory is the memory used by the Core System and Active Memory is memory used by other applications. \nWhen a page in Active Memory is no longer being used, it becomes Inactive Memory. The data still stays in RAM because an app may request it later, at which point it becomes Active Memory again. \nWhen your RAM starts to fill up, the oldest pages in the Inactive Memory region are “Paged out”, which means that they are written to the Swap. Your system is slowing down because of this. Your RAM is full, so the system is paging out things to the disk. The disk is slower than the RAM, so your system slows down as data is paged in and out. \nYou must find out the app(s) using up your RAM with a combination of trial and error and using the Activity Monitor to check the memory usage of each app. Most likely, the problem is a memory leak in an app.\n", "Q: Mail.app keeps trying to connecting to old mail server Yesterday my web host (Dreamhost) unexpectedly moved my email account to a new server. Most of my email clients didn't skip a beat, and continued to connect to the server and receive mail.\nHowever, immediately after the server migration, Mail.app on my home computer stopped receiving mail. It continued to successfully login to the mail server, but did not find any email received post-migration. My assumption is that it was connecting to the old mail server.\nToday, Mail.app fails to login to the mail server at all. My assumption is that the old server has now been decommissioned.\nTo me, it seems as if Mail.app has some sort of bad DNS cache, causing it to 'look' at the old server rather than the new one.\nSteps I tried to resolve the issue:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restarted Mail.app.\n\n*Rebooted computer.\n\n*Cleared OS X DNS cache.\n\n*Synchronized IMAP account with server.\n\n*Deleted email account from Mail.app, and recreated it.\n\n*Rebooted cable modem.\n\n\nNot a spot of difference.\nIs it possible that Mail.app is somehow caching DNS details for the email server, even after I clear the OS X DNS cache? If so, how could I force Mail.app to 'look' at the new server?\nSetup: OS X Lion, IMAP email account\n[SOLVED] See the comments for a description of the solution. The culprit was Avast Anti Virus.\n\nA: This sounds like a DNS caching issue still. I know that most web browsers do cache their own DNS as well, and I am sure Mail does, but I think that cache empties after exiting. \nI always try to telnet into port 25 on a remote mail server to test the connection when something is weird. Port 25 is for SMTP traffic, or what sends the mail. If you get a valid connection, you can actually interact with this interface. With your comments though, this probably did not work. \nDNS is a very strange beast, because so many different services do many things, not to mention the different hardware on your network. In this case you have:\n\n\n*\n\n*router\n\n*Mac, but DNS cache and hosts file\n\n\nIn the end, it sounds like you discovered this in your hosts file. I can't count the number of times (I do a bit of web dev) that I set something up in the hosts file and then got confused why something was acting wrong. \n", "Q: Alfred - Open selected url in browser I'm looking for a way to open the url in clipboard with Alfred - using shortcut key.

I found out that it cover path\n/usr/local/Cellar/aircrack-ng/1.1/bin\n\nbut it couldn't find commands after I tried tab-completion in path\n/usr/local/Cellar/aircrack-ng/1.1/sbin\n\nWhat should I do? Do I need to add another path?\n\nA: The sbin directory, which some admin tools like dsniff and aircrack install to, is not on the path by default, and it's not in Homebrew's initial setup instructions, which tell you to get /usr/local/bin on your path. This is because, traditionally, sbin/ is for administrative tools that only root would expect to run.\nTab completion is picking up the files in /usr/local/Cellar/aircrack-ng/1.1/bin because they are symlinked in to /usr/local/bin, which is on your PATH. It does not find the files in /usr/local/Cellar/aircrack-ng/1.1/sbin, because they are symlinked in to /usr/local/sbin, which is not on your PATH. Your current working directory does not matter for tab-completion, because . (the current directory) is not on the PATH.\nIf you want to see those other programs on your path, where tab-completion can pick them up, add /usr/local/sbin to your PATH in the same place you added /usr/local/bin - probably your ~/.bashrc file.\nIn general, if you want to use tab-completion on programs in the current directory, you need to call them with a ./ prefix. For example, cd /usr/local/sbin and then type ./air and hit tab, and you'll get some choices.\n\nA: By convention, .../bin directories are for all users, .../sbin directories are for usage by root only. I don't know the setup if homebrew, but maybe /usr/local/Cellar/aircrack-ng/1.1/sbin is on the path if you are root?\n", "Q: How to show all annotations at once in Preview? I just got an heavily commented pdf, when I open it in Preview, all annotations (highlights, notes) are \"hidden\", i.e. do not show up in the left margin. I can display them by clicking on them but I would like to see them all at once without having to click on each of them individually. I couldn't find a menu item but maybe I missed it? Or is there a keyboard shortcut?\n\nA: This is a workaround, as I couldn't find a hotkey or menu option to do this. Still, clicking\nView > Hide Notes\n\nand then\nView > Show Notes\n\nWill show all anotations. I can now see all the annotations without manually clicking them.

But I'm having the same problem with subsequently-created files in Byword, and they don't feature this icon.\n\nA: A dotted-lined iCloud icon means that it is waiting to be uploaded (or it is currently uploading).

I've gotten a $100 back to school from Apple, along with a recent Mac purchase. Can I pay for apps across multiple purchases, or must I spend $100 in one go?

To access the shared files just:\n\n\n*\n\n*While in Finder select Go > Connect to Server... or hit Command+K.\n\n*A window will appear, prompting for the Server's URL, which is the File Sharing Computer's network IP, something like 192.168.1.2.

So, it will look like afp://192.168.1.2.\n\n*The other Mac's sharing folder will be mounted on your Finder. \n\n\nJust so you know, when you enable the File Sharing, beneath the green light, the exact URL of that computer will be shown. The afp://your.network.ip.numberthingy. \nIf you are using Lion, or later, Airdrop is, by far, the best option for file sharing. It requires no setup nor special settings, and it sends the files wirelessly, without having both Macs to be connected to the same Wifi network.  \n", "Q: Can Mountain Lion be modified so that a double click will open \"hidden\" folders and files? I've noticed something strange in Finder since upgrading to Mountain Lion; any hidden folder or files (that I've already run defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE for) can only be opened by manually Ctrl-clicking the it and selecting Open. Is there a way I can modify Finder's behavior to be able to double-click and open hidden files and folders as was possible on Lion?\n\nA: Its looks like this might be a Mountain Lion Bug and a bug report has been submitted to Apple for this issue. Additionally, after some testing its seems that hidden files and folders will not open when double-clicked from with in a Finder window that has an icons, lists, or Cover Flow view selected.\nNote:  For the Cover flow view double-click does not work in the list view, yet double clicking items in the cover flow section will cause the file or folder to open.\nNote: If you double-click hidden files/folders on the desktop they open as expected, which seems odd, and kind of indicates that this not working in most Finder window views is just a bug.\nWork Arounds until the bug (hopefully its a bug and not a new feature) is fixed by Apple: \nUse the \"column\" or \"Cover Flow\" Finder views.\n\n\n*\n\n*With column view selected hidden folders just open when clicked on, and hidden files open as expected when double-clicked. \n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*With the Cover Flow view selected the work around is two steps.\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on the hidden file or folder in the list on the bottom of the window.\n\n*Then double-click on the file or folder to open it.\n\n\n\n\n\nA: Obvious, but ⌘-O works fast enough for me, rather than trying to modify Finder.\n", "Q: Cannot enter Time Machine I have been running Time Machine for about 10 months with no problems.

Is it creating a .cdr disk image of the DVD using Disk Utility?\nNote that some are multiple install DVDs i.e. a set of 9 or so DVDs.\nThanks,\nOsu\n\nA: A good way to back up of software CD/DVD install media is to create a disk image for each disk you want to back up, then you can store those disks images on a backup hard-drives, etc. The '.cdr' format is essentially a .iso which is the industry standard way of representing software disk images, so its a pretty good universal choice, that works on many platforms.\nTo create a disk image for an optical disk using the Disk Utility Application:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Disk Utility Program\n\n*Insert the CD/DVD you want to create a disk image for.\n\n*Select the mounted CD/DVD disk under the \"Super Drive\" dive icon.\n\n*Click the Unmount button.\n\n*Select the the unmounted CD/DVD disk, by clicking once on it. \n\n*Select \"File\" menu > \"New\" > Disk Image from  \"YourCD/DVD Disk\"\n\n*Set where you want to save the disk image and select Image Format: \"DVD/CD master\" plus any other options you would like, and the press \"Save\"\n\nA: Yep, the best way to back them up is to create an image. You should create multiple images for multiple disks, otherwise the installer may look for data in another disk.

This still leaves a leftover directory in /Volumes, which doesn't get deleted.\nSo if I mount the drive foo, a directory /Volumes/foo is created for the mount. This directory is still there after disconnecting the network cable and confirming to disconnect the drive. The next time I mount the same foo share, a new directory /Volumes/foo-1 is created etc.\nThis is causing some trouble with scripts (or Unison, which I point to /Volumes/foo), since the expected mount point is not the same (/Volumes/foo is empty in this case).\nIs there any way to automatically remove this directory after the disconnect I described above?\nThis happens to me on a regular basis when I put the MacBook to sleep, remove the network cable and then want to work e.g. on the train without being connected to the network.\nUpdate\nAfter observing this issue for a couple of months now (I'm still on Snow Leopard), I've noticed the following: The folder /Volumes/foo is not removed even with the network cable in when removing the mount through Finder. To clarify:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Finder, press ⌘+K\n\n*Select a Samba drive to mount, e.g. smb://server/foo\n\n*This will be mounted in /Volumes/foo, make sure you can browse it through Finder\n\n*Click the Eject button next to the share in Finder\n\n*The directory /Volumes/foo is not removed\n\n\nAs a consequence, when I try to mount the same share again, another directory /Volumes/foo-1 is created, etc.\n\nA: Not an answer, just to let you know that I cannot emulate your problem in a similar setup, and that you might have a problem.\nI have an iMac with 10.6.8 and a MacBook with 10.8.1. Sometimes I forget to eject the connected volume on the iMac before I shut down the MacBook, and then the mounted volume remains as an image on the Desktop and in the sidebar of any open folder. I then simply click the eject-symbol in the folder sidebar or right-click on the desktop symbol and tell finder to eject the volume. It disappears. Now, looking in my /Volumes (in Finder as well as in Terminal), there is no remaining network volume. Maybe ejecting it did the trick.\nNow, if I do NOT eject the remaining volume after I shut down the MacBook (or put it to sleep) and then boot (or wake) it and connect it again, the remaining volume icon on the desktop disappears and a new one appears. If I check under /Volumes (in Finder and Terminal), there is only one connected volume. (I did not shut down the iMac or do anything, except shut down the MacBook and start it (or put it to sleep and wake it) and connect it again.)\nI do not get a Finder notification, that the drive is no longer available, either.

You can set another one as the primary, but the first email address that you use to create the account with cannot be changed ever. Not even by calling Apple. I tried. Eventually, I created a dummy gmail account to get my invoices and stuff.

Here is the entire code that I used to replace Patrick's in Automator (again, make sure to replace [UserName] with your actual user name):\non run {input, parameters}\n\n        display dialog \"Your Administrator Password:\" default answer \"\" with hidden answer\n        set PWD to text returned of the result\n\n        do shell script \"sudo kextunload -b com.apple.driver.AppleSDXC; sudo kextload -b com.apple.driver.AppleSDXC\" user name \"[UserName]\" password PWD with administrator privileges\n\n    return input\nend run\n\n\nA: Locations moved around in High Sierra\nThis will reload the SDXC reader. \n$ sudo kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/AppleSDXC.kext; sudo kextload /System/Library/Extensions/AppleSDXC.kext\n\n\nA: Probably the best solution I've seen on the web:\nUnmounting an attached hard drive\ndiskutil unmount /dev/disk2s1\n\nVolume VM Drive on disk2s1 unmounted\n\nNote how we use the unmount command. We need to specify the location of the partition with its full path (i.e. /dev/disk2s1).\nMounting an attached hard drive.\nTo mount the drive again, without having to take it out and plugging it in again, I can issue this command:\ndiskutil mount /dev/disk2s1\n\nVolume VM Drive on /dev/disk2s1 mounted\n\ncredits\n", "Q: MacBook Air 2011 - External Display I currently have a MacBook Air 13\" 2011. \nI want to connect two external Displays.

When the internal Display is closed, it should be possible to connect another display to have two one!\nI want to buy a Dock where i can close the display and have two external ones. \nDoes anyone know if this solution works? \n\nA: The specs say that it only supports a single external display.\n\nA: Check out the Air Display app.\n", "Q: Is there a way to temporarily allow popups in Safari 6 without going into Preferences? If I know I'm about to click on a link that will pop up a window that I want, is there a modifier key or anything I can do to temporarily allow the popup to appear, without going into Safari's preferences window, unchecking the box, opening the popup, then checking the box again (and getting the same warning every single time)?\n\nA: At least in Safari 5.1.7 it's under Safari menu\n\n", "Q: How to make Adobe applications respect desktop/spaces? I have my applications arranged on three different desktops (formerly known as Spaces) to avoid cluttering.\nThe only problem is that Adobe apps such as Photoshop or Illustrator always spawn windows in whatever current desktop I'm in. It works with all the other apps.\nIs there a way to make Adobe apps respect my settings?\n\nA: Been struggling with this problem too, until I've found that the fix is, actually, very simple.\nRight click on the Photoshop icon in dock > Options > Assign To \"None\".\nThis worked for me.\n\n", "Q: Can an iPad 3 connect to a Windows 7 adhoc network with internet connection sharing enabled? Is it possible to connect to a Windows 7 adhoc wireless network without jailbreaking from an iPad 3 running iOS 5.1?\nI have tried these instructions, including the Manual IPs (with my own IPs and subnet mask etc)\nThe iPad can see the network but will not connect (unable to connect or similar generic error).\n\nA: Yes this is definitely possible. I have created an ad hoc network on windows 7 and connected to it with my iPad 3.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to control panel > Network and Sharing Center\n\n*Click setup a new connection or network\n\n*Scroll down and choose Click setup a wireless ad hoc network\n\n*give a network name and choose WEP encryption from the dropdown list. The password should be 10 characters long and I used all numeric digits for this.\n\n*tick save this network. and click next at the bottom to create the network.\n\n*On your iPad or other device select your network which will be broadcast with the name you chose and connect to that network with the password yo uused in step 4.\n\n*If the device fails to connect, try repeating this process again. It took me a couple times but worked eventually.\n\n*After Connecting, you must also setup network sharing in order to connect to the internet. You must have an internet connection on either LAN or a different Wireless card or some other device. Go to the Network and Sharing Center again in COntrol Panel.\n\n*Choose on the left sidebar Change adapter settings to get to Network Connections\n\n*select the network connection that is connected to the internet (The LAN or alternate wireless / other device) and right click and choose properties.\n\n*Go to the Sharing tab and check Allow other network users to connect through this computer's internet connection.\n\n*Select the network connection that you were using to broadcast the ad hoc network for the associated network connection.\n\n*Click on the Settings button which will bring up a window with a list of services to allow or deny for users using this internet connection via the ad hoc ICS (internet connection sharing)\n\n*Check at least HTTP and probably HTTPS protocols, SMTP for email, POP3 for email as well if you need, etc... and Click Ok when you're done.\n\n*Click Ok again on the original window.

Don't have to provide manual addresses.\n\nA: You just can’t create an ad-hoc network and expect devices to get internet access. You will have to download an app like Virtual Router which will allow you to get internet access on the iPad.\nYou will also get WPA2 encryption with Virtual Router, as opposed to WEP, which I don’t consider encryption at all.\nEDIT: I was just thinking about this again, and now I realise that we are setting up Wi-Fi Direct instead of an ad-hoc network. An ad-hoc network doesn’t support anything but WEP. By the way, Wi-Fi Direct is way better than ad-hoc networking.\n\nA: Hey guys _ I was able to get around all of this using iPad and Win7 by bridging the adapters on the win7 side.. It allows the wifi to route directly through the LAN port, and then you get direct adhoc access to your dhcp server and gateway..\n", "Q: Is there a way to sync bookmarks between chrome and safari on an ongoing basis? I have Chrome and Safari both installed on my Mac.\nMy underlying need is wanting to use Chrome on my MacBook Pro and to have all bookmarks I create to sync to mobile Safari on my iOS devices.   \nYes, I could just use chrome on my iPhone, but I don't want to as iOS directs other apps to always open URL in Mobile Safari.\nIs there a way to have two way sync from OS X Chrome to iOS Mobile Safari whether through a cloud service or my Mac which can run 24/7?\n\nA: The chrome extension \"Xmarks\" may serve your needs. The extension syncs bookmarks between computers.\nhttps://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ajpgkpeckebdhofmmjfgcjjiiejpodla\nseems to be available for both chrome and safari. Then if you use icloud sync, bookmarks \"should\" propagate to your mobile device. Changes on the idevice would propagate back to desktop safari. What is unknown, is if you would have to periodically launch Safari on the mac to get things in sync. NOTE that this solution runs on PCs only (Using a '.com' ap / program). If on Apple only, will work only if your Mac also runs Windows.\n\nA: Not only the chrome extension for xmarks, but you can use this on all browsers, ie, firefox, safari, chrome, etc.  www.xmarks.com.  I have used it for several years and I heard it changed from free to paid about a year ago, so not sure what all it takes now, but I am happy with the setup I have and use the web access to find my bookmarks remotely often.\n\nA: You can also use the BookMacster Mac app, which can sync bookmarks across many browsers and bookmarking services, like Pinboard.\n\nA: Yes, its my solution: on Windows machine install iCloud Control Panel (http://support.apple.com/kb/dl1455) and check option \"Bookmarks\" which sync your iCloud Safari bookmarks with Chrome, IE and Firefox. Then all your mobile safari bookmarks will sync with desktop Chrome(witch link with your Google account) and when you open Chrome on Mac with your Google account you will get all you Safari bookmarks in it.\nP.S. Yes, for this solution necessarily need a machine with Windows\n", "Q: Apple Universal Dock & Bluetooth Just acquired an azatom Tune-Stream Bluetooth dongle which turns 30-pin iPod docking stations into Bluetooth devices. However, it doesn't work when I insert it in an Apple Universal Dock (connected to a TEAC micro hi-fi system via a small jack). My iPod Touch works in the Dock, and it pairs with the Tune-Stream remotely when that is in place, but no sound. Azatom instructions say doesn't work with speakers with \"digital signal interface\", but why would Universal Dock have a different interface from usual iPod docking station?\n\nA: iOS devices can output either digital or analog audio through their dock connectors. Your hi-fi is only compatible with digital audio. But your Bluetooth dongle outputs analog audio to the hi-fi, which it can’t play.\n", "Q: How do I run an interactive GUI application in pre-login environment? I am interested in writing an application which runs in a pre-login environment, i.e. right after a user enters their username and password, much like how OS X does the initial account setup:\n\nHow does this work? I've used iHook to run scripts, but I'd like to use replicate the same look and feel of Apple's initial account setup.\n\nA: I've been looking into this for awhile myself.  Mike Bombich been able to do it for years with his Bootpicker app.  And this developer is able to tap into running a GUI app as soon as the user clicks on a login icon: https://github.com/grahamgilbert/crypt (can't tell from his screenshot, but look up his OS X Management with Puppet presentation).\n", "Q: How can I have my shell always start in a certain directory that is not my home directory I've tried putting\ncd /Users/my_name/my_directory/structure\n\nin both .bashrc and .bash_login but neither works, i.e. when I open a new terminal window I am in my home (/Users/my_name/) directory.\nNo error messages, just not cd'd into the directory as hoped when starting a new terminal window.\n\nA: First of all, if you are not using iTerm2 already, I suggest you download this free software as a replacement for Terminal.app.\nAmong many other extra features, in iTerm Preferences, you can configure the default working directory for new shells. You'll find these settings in Profiles - General.\n\nThe advantage here is that you can set different behaviors for opening a new window vs opening a new tab or even creating a new split pane. I personally like staying in the current working directory when adding a split pane, for example.\nYou could do it in your startup script as well (though I find the iTerm solution cleaner, or at least more flexible), but then I advise you to use ~/.bash_profile instead.\n~/.bashrc is not automatically sourced when opening a new shell window, and ~/.bash_login is only sourced if no ~/.bash_profile is present.\n\nA: As Gerry mentioned, .bashrc is not read by login shells. New tabs are login shells by default in Terminal and iTerm 2. .bash_login is only read if there's no .bash_profile.\nYou could also add a cd command to .bash_profile.\n", "Q: What can be done about the calendar app closing itself on an iPad? I have been using my calendar fine but this afternoon when I click on the tile it briefly opens (1 sec) and then closes itself. I have waited 30 mins, I have turned iPad off & back on and still no joy.\n\nA: This is how applications crash on iOS - so you may want to check your settings to see if your iPad is sending crash reports to Apple.\nSettings App -> General -> Diagnostics & Usage\nYou can also look in the Data submenu from the above screen and scroll down to look for LatestCrash.plist and see if the date matches when your iCal quit.\nIn general, it's not possible (even as a developer) to read these reports without access to the iCal source code and you have some short term things you can do to isolate the issue further.\nFirst is to remove any notifications (turn of WiFi and cellular data) and reboot the iPad. If iCal crashes, then it's due to the calendar data on the device and not some external cause. You can then remove your calendar information, account by account to clear up which account has the data corruption that is causing iCal to have a problem. Worst case, you will have to connect your iPad to a computer (iTunes) and force a sync to erase the calendar data on the iPad and replace it with data from the computer to clear the data that is causing the crash.\nApple will likely fix the crash (even with bad data - the program should handle it and let you know an event is broken or ignored and why) in the upcoming updates - but you can report the crash to add weight to this particular bug getting fixed.\nYou can also take an overkill (but faster) approach to erase all content and settings on the iPad and set it up again.\nIt's unlikely the data will come back corrupt from your calendar sources (or the backup) but if it does, at least you'll know a bit more about how to isolate which calendar is causing iCal to have problems.\n\nA: Sounds like the April 1st calendar crash. Delete whole day events on April 1st (and unsubscribe from calendars that give you public holidays on that day), and that should fix crashes that occur when you go to month view in March. \n\nA: Apple support tell me that the problem is known, their engineers are working on it and the temporary solution is to deselect the uk holiday calendar, and by implication any other calendar where events on April 1st are all day, and to change any all day events on April 1st on your own calendars to say 0100 to 2300.\nIt occurs that people might have several day events stretching over 31st March and 1st April which might also need amending.\nConspiracy paranoids might think the original programmer thought, ahah it's April Fools Day in 2013, but I guess it's more likely to be an unintended consequence of the 31st not having enough hours for a 24 hr all day event.\n\nA: If your calendar appears as a blank page and then closes you are unable to delete or change all day events from the 25 hours imposed by daylight saving to fewer hours.\nIn that case change your location a territory that does not use daylight saving, e.g. Most of Africa. When you reopen Calender you should be able to edit your all day events\n\nA: Drag the appointment to an empty date. Then you should be able to delete it. Worked for me.\n\nA: I deleted the subscription to DE Holidays events (German holidays) - and it fixed the problem, even though I have other all-day events listed on April 1.\n", "Q: How do I add/adjust words in/to the keyboard dictionary on iOS? I want to add some common building names for my college campus to my keyboard dictionary, but in the General tab in Settings, I only see an option to reset the dictionary.\nI tried typing the words, expecting to see a red squiggly underneath them and then an option to add the words to the dictionary, but only a suggested edit was there.\nIt added one of the buildings =, but only because it tried to auto-correct to something else but I corrected it and it added itself to the dict.\nBut other names that have no auto-correct don't get added.\nAlso, I want to adjust a word that was added by making it auto-correct to being capitalized. And I want to remove some of the autocorrects like correcting \"te\" to \"the\" instead of the preprogrammed \"TE\", etc.\n\nA: *\n\n*Go to Setttings > General > Keyboard.\n\n*Tap Edit in the top right corner.\n\n*Tap Add New Shortcut. Type the word you wanted to add to the dictionary in the Phrase field. You can also optionally add a shortcut.\n\n*Add a shortcut with the Phrase TE and the shortcut te. This will auto-capitalise te to TE. It will also prevent it from auto-correcting to the.\n\n", "Q: Jailbreak and iOS 'hardware encrypted' data My understanding of reading apple security document below\nhttp://images.apple.com/ipad/business/pdf/iPad_Security_Overview.pdf\nis that using iphone4s or ipad3, \nand setting a complex passcode, \nthe data on the iPhone/ipad is encrypted when iphone/ipad is locked.\nIf iPhone/ipad is jailbroken, does it mean the original data is lost ?\n\nA: There are two partitions on all iOS devices. One is for the system, other is for the data. Jailbreaking only affects the System partition. So jailbreaking doesn’t affect your data.\n", "Q: Transfer an App Store app to another machine without internet access I have a Mac, running Mountain Lion, which does not have internet access and cannot be given internet access. I would like to take an app, which is only available on the App Store, and install it on this Mac. I do have another Mac with internet access and can purchase the App on it. However, when I try to copy and install the app on the other machine, the app won't launch. \nHow can I accomplish this? \nI have no intention of using the App on the Machine on which the purchase was made.\n\nA: Short of cracking the code signing, you will need to have the receiving Mac connect to Apple's servers (through the internet) at least once to validate your account on that Mac. Once that is done, you should be able to run apps for the length of time that the code signing certificate remains valid.\nYou could also see about contacting the developer and see if you can purchase the app from them directly if you don't want to have the App Store model for software installation and validation.\n", "Q: Has Mountain Lion changed file sharing setup or permissions? Recently I installed Mountain Lion (I had Snow Leopard), I used to share files with a PC enabling the file sharing and use Filezilla in the PC to download and upload files.\nNow with Mountain Lion for some reason I can't connect to the Mac computer. Nothing changed; I'm using the same credentials. This is exactly what I did: http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/how-to-set-up-file-sharing-from-mountain-lion.html\nIs there some kind of new security policy or something similar in Mountain Lion?\n\nA: The FTP server in Mountain Lion is still there, just not part of the GUI. You can re-enable it using the following in Terminal:\nsudo -s launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ftp.plist\n\nTo disable, do unload instead of load.\n*The FTP root directory is your Users home folder.\n\nA: I assume since you mention Filezilla that you used to access them via FTP. IF you compare the SL and ML preference windows you will see that ML no longer has 'FTP sharing', that option moved to Mountain Lion Server as far as I know. You may still access those files via the Windows based File Sharing (SMB). \n", "Q: Can I have multiple monitors on my MacBook Pro (Early 2011)? I have a MacBook Pro (13\") from Early 2011 and want to use 2 external monitors (And not the actual display). I've seen the Matrox, but that appears to make one BIG display out of 2 monitors, so I can't really have 2 desktops.\nIs there any way for me to have 2 external displays and have them recognized by the OS?\n\nA: If you want a cheaper alternative to running two Thunderbolt Displays, you can add a second monitor (in addition to one off the mini-Displayport) try a USB Displaylink adapter, like this one from OWC (there are other brands, any one using the Displaylink technology should work).\nThe performance won't be as good, but as long as you're not doing anything involving lots of 3D, it should be acceptable.\n\nA: Any 2011 MacBook Pro model will support Thunderbolt. You can daisy-chain 2 Thunderbolt displays. You can also connect one mini DisplayPort monitor to the end of a Thunderbolt chain and connect your Mac to your Thunderbolt Display.\nA non-Thunderbolt solution if you don't have a Thunderbolt Mac: a DisplayLink-style USB to DVI display adapter.\n\nA: You can always try the Matrox DualHead2Go Digital ME. I use the Mini DisplayPort version and it works well except it can get quite fussy when I try to resume from sleep. Of course, I'm using it with the MBP lid closed; it doesn't seem to have this problem when the lid is open.\nOne other note: the device makes both monitors appear to the Mac as being a single, giant monitor. However, I haven't really had any issue with this myself.\n\nA: There is a way to connect two non-Thunderbolt monitors to a Macbook Pro (Early 2011). You just have to daisy chain two Thunderbolt docks together, where at least one of the docks has an HDMI out.\nThis is because each Thunderbolt device can demultiplex only one DisplayPort signal from the Thunderbolt signal. So to get two DisplayPort signals out of the Thunderbolt signal, you need two Thunderbolt devices.\nExample\nI have an Elgato Thunderbolt 2 Dock and a Belkin Thunderbolt 2 Express Dock. My Macbook Pro is connected with a Thunderbolt cable to the Elgato dock. My first monitor is connected to the Elgato dock via the HDMI port. The Belkin dock is then daisy chained to the first dock using another Thunderbolt cable. I then use a Mini DisplayPort to HDMI cable to connect the Belkin dock to the second monitor. When this is all connected up, the laptop's display shuts off and the two external monitors work normally.\nIt's not a cheap setup, but second-hand Thunderbolt docks are a lot cheaper than they used to be. Hopefully this helps anyone else like me who is stubbornly refusing to upgrade their 8 year old laptop!\n\nA: It seems I fell into the vicar's tale (http://www.belkin.com/us/p/P-F4U085/) and bought this Belkin Thunderbolt™ 2 Express Dock HD.\nIt's page states \"Imagine connecting two displays to your laptop. Now imagine one of those displays boasting an eye-popping 4K cinema resolution. With the Belkin Thunderbolt 2 Express Dock HD, you can make the display setup of your dreams a reality.\" but I cant tell if it's a MacOS issue or not as \"notebook\" includes WindoZe notes.\nIf I plug a thunderbolt adapter to it, HDMI port stops ;/\n", "Q: My iPhone 4 (model AI332) won't turn on or charge My iPhone's back got smashed and, not liking the look of it, I took it off and used the phone without the back. \nLater, I dropped the phone again and the battery came out completely. Although the battery was a bit loose before I dropped it the second time, now it wasn't even in the phone.\nI put the battery back in and because it would not turn on, I began charging it. The iPhone started booting up, but then it shut off and restarted. It did this several times before it finally brought up an image showing me to plug it into iTunes.\nWhen I did connect it to iTunes, nothing happened; the iPhone did not light up at all as I plugged it into my laptop.\n I went to a phone repair store, and a gentleman told me it was the battery, but is there any way I can fix this myself and is it definitely the battery?\n\nA: The real answer is you can:\na) pay someone to test a new battery in the device and tell you if it's just the battery\nb) buy a new battery (or one that is so old and used, that it doesn't hold a long charge, but works well enough to restore the device when it's being powered from a computer).\nThere's no way the internet can do the diagnosis on one device with the details you have provided. We can explain how to test things, how things work but generally refrain from making guesses.\n\nA: Your best bet in my opinion is to send it to UBreakIFix. They will give you an honest estimate of what's wrong and what it would cost to fix it.\nIt may be cheap. It may be as much as $200 or equivalent.\nI've used them a number of times (unfortunately)...\n They are fast and good. I got my phones back on average in about 2-3 days.\n", "Q: Is it possible to change the order of the tabs shown in the Dictionary? In my Mac Mini running OS X 10.8, the tabs shown from Dictionary are the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*All\n\n*American English\n\n*American English Thesaurus\n\n*Apple\n\n*British English Thesaurus\n\n*Wikipedia\n\n*British English\n\n\nI would like to change their order, as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*All\n\n*American English\n\n*American English Thesaurus\n\n*British English\n\n*British English Thesaurus\n\n*Apple\n\n*Wikipedia\n\n\nI tried dragging them, but nothing happens; I also tried selecting them pressing the control keys, but all I got was a contextual menu that allows me to edit the labels, which  is not what I want to do.\nIs there any way to change the order that labels are shown?\n\nA: Yes, just go to the Preferences for the Dictionary app.  There's a list there of all the possible dictionaries, which you can then drag to be in any order you like.\n\n", "Q: How to prevent Mac sleep from command line? I have a long running script at the remote computer.\nI don't want terminate my ssh session, and need enter it into a shell script.\nHow is it possible to prevent my Mac from falling into sleep from the command line?\n\nA: caffeinate -i -s /bin/ssh ...\n\nExplanation:\n-i - Prevent idle sleep.\n-s - Prevent system sleep (entirely, even if you close the lid). Note: it only works while on AC power.\n/bin/ssh - Just keep writing the command you want to execute. Using ssh directly instead of /bin/ssh should also work.\nResults: Your system will not sleep as long as the ssh command is running.\n\nA: In Mountain Lion you can use the caffeinate command.\ncaffeinate -u -t 1000\n\nwill prevent idle sleep for 1000 seconds.\n\nA: If you are looking for the nuclear option like I was:\nsudo systemsetup -setcomputersleep Never\n\n–Set or Disable Sleep Due to Mac System Inactivity from the Command Line in OS X\n\nA: The solution to this problem is not keeping the client (your Mac) awake.  Using approaches like this are undependable.  What happens if the network connection is lost? Even if your Mac is awake, the script will halt. \nUse nohup\nIf your long-running script is called eternity.sh, try the following:\nnohup /path/to/eternity.sh > /path/to/output.out &\nNow you can even close the connection and your script will keep running. The & backgrounds the process so you can keep the connection open and enter commands.  View any output from your script via:\ntail -f /path/to/output.out\nThe paths in the examples are optional if the script is on your path and you want script output to be written to output.out in the current directory. \nI manage scripts that run for days at a time.  Scripts like these should be detached from the terminal.  Thankfully, nohup provides an easy-to-remember command invocation to achieve this--think no hangup. \n\nA: Another option is pmset. Use the command pmset noidle  to prevent sleep as long as pmset is running. Unfortunately, it requires a separate Terminal window with pmset running in it. However, the other option, caffeinate, only lets you set a certain time. So it's a matter of choosing whether you want to open a second SSH session, or deal with a time restraint.\nEdit: According to binarybob's comment, you can actually run it in the background like this: pmset noidle & To get back to pmset type fg.\n\nA: use caffeinate.\nthe installed policies on my machine make everything dependent on the display, so the only thing that worked for me was to invoke caffeinate with the -d option.\n$ caffeinate -d\n\nexcerpt from the man page:\nCAFFEINATE(8)\n\nNAME\n    caffeinate – prevent the system from sleeping on behalf of a utility\n\nSYNOPSIS\n    caffeinate [-disu] [-t timeout] [-w pid] [utility arguments...]\n\nDESCRIPTION\n   caffeinate creates assertions to alter system sleep behavior.  If no assertion flags are specified, caffeinate creates an assertion to prevent idle sleep.  If a utility is specified, caffeinate creates the assertions on the utility's behalf, and those assertions will persist for the duration of the utility's execution. Otherwise, caffeinate creates the assertions directly, and those assertions will persist until caffeinate exits.\n\n Available options:\n\n -d      Create an assertion to prevent the display from sleeping.\n\n\nA: The StarMessage screensaver ( http://starmessagesoftware.com/moonscreensaver/ ) has also the option to keep the MAC awake for 2 hours, 8 hours, or permanenty. \nThis way of disabling the MAC sleep, is much easier than caffeine.\n", "Q: Can Microsoft RDC client use retina scale resolution on the MacBook Pro? I'm using the Microsoft Remote Desktop Connection tool with my MBP retina to connect to a Win7 system, but I can't get the resolution over 1440 x 900, even in full screen mode. Is this a limitation, or am I doing something wrong?\nChanging the Retina display scaling didn't seem to make a difference.\nI tried Cord instead, and while that seems to support other resolutions, the quality seems terrible.\n\n\nA: Go to RDP settings, add the full screen resolution of your Mac (eg. 2880x1800 or a scaled version thereof, eg. 1920x1200, 2160x1350, ...).\nGo to connection and choose that resolution and enable scaling.  Looks exactly like Jump\n\nA: Sorry, you're fresh outta luck here, unless Microsoft re-writes RDC to support Retina.\nBasically, what's happening is that OS X is detecting that the app isn't retina-aware, reporting a 1440x900 screen size to the app, then pixel-doubles the app's output.\nThis is the same as what happens when you run a (non-retina) iPhone app on an iPad in \"2x\" mode, it just pixel doubles, and the app doesn't know any different.\nGreat for compatibility, not so great for graphic quality...\nI would suggest (to everyone!) to submit as a bug/feature request to Microsoft.  If enough people complain, they might just do something about it.\nHope this helps.\nEDIT: You might want to give Jump Desktop a try. It's been updated for Retina as at 18th August.  At $30 or so, it's a tad expensive for my limited use, but it sounds like your best bet.  Cheers!\n\nA: Buy 'Jump Desktop (Remote Desktop)' from the App Store. It solves the lag caused by the retina display...I had the same problem and it was doing my head in. It also makes the resolution look a lot better than the Windows RDC software.\n\nA: I was able to force RDC to accept other resolutions. I already knew in advance that forcing the desktop to Macbook Pro's Retina 2800 x 1800 would cause problems if you weren't able to adjust the text and item size (some Terminal Server setups won't allow display changes - my client's doesn't)\nThe goal is to get a good-sized piece of real estate with legible text and icons.\n\n\n*\n\n*RDC Preferences/Display, change resolution to any value OTHER than “Full Screen” \n\n*Close preferences dialog\n\n*Save the RDP file\n\n*Open Finder, find the RDP file you just created; Open with TextEdit.app\n\n*Find the DesktopHeight and DesktopWidth tags, change the values in the integer tags immediately below to values you want.

However using the same cable and adapter my friend's 3G cannot be charged.\nFirst thing that comes to my mind is a problem with the 3G unit however it works well elsewhere with the same cable (e.g. 3 different laptops, wall outlet and even a PS2's USB slot). \nSo I think there is some mismatch between the unit and the car adapter. But I am not sure what I must consider when ordering a new car adapter for the 3G, for example do voltage consumptions vary between the 3G and 3GS? Anything else? Or is it just a random problem and I don't need to worry and just buy a new car adapter?\n\nA: I had the same problem, i had 3GS and de car adapter i am using is from philips, my collegeau with a 3G couldn't charge.

I know that it is possible to completely disable Java in OS X, and to disable its use from within a given browser. I use just one or two applications that require Java, and would like to enable it for them, but prevent it from running in all other cases.\nIs there a way to enable Java only for certain apps that I specify?\n\nA: There is a way, but it's convoluted and non-intuitive.  I will say that I do not recommend this approach, but I am listing it for completeness.\nJava Default Policy Administration is the official doc on Java's own internal security and access policy.\nThe idea is that you can set deny access to files/folders at a global level, then add specific grant permissions to those Java classes/jars you want to allow.\nThe permission's that can be set are listed in the JDK Permissions \nSome examples of what can be done can be found at ExampleDepot\n", "Q: How make changing to the /etc/hosts file take effect? I added some lines to my /etc/hosts file to resolve a private hostname, but every time after rebooting, the lines I added get lost. Should there be any setting options to make these changes take effect?\n\nA: The Cisco AnyConnect VPN Client is known to show this behavior. It will reset your /etc/hosts file on reboot to the contents of /etc/hosts.ac.\nIf you use this VPN client, you should make your modifications to both files.\nSee this hint for more info.\nhttp://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20111011050950471\n\nA: Looks like some app deletes this lines from /etc/hosts on system startup.

I just did a clean install of Mountain Lion on a new drive, and I would like to import some, but not all, of my files from my Snow Leopard system installed on another drive.\nFor example, all my Safari Bookmarks, some installed software, but not everything because something there was an issue with my profile under Snow Leopard and I did not whant those issues to to be copied over with my profile.\nIs there a way to do this ?\nThanks a lot for some help\n\nA: This is definitely possible. For starters you may want to look at Migration Assistant, which will allow you to migrate only certain items.\nIf you want finer grained control, you can manually copy just about anything if you know where it lives. Most programs can be copied over without any trouble, and most apps have a folder in ~/Library/Application Support/ to store their settings and data.\nSafari bookmarks can be transferred by either copying the ~/Library/Safari/Bookmarks.plist file, or using the Import/Export Bookmarks commands in the Safari File menu.\nThis blog post by Matt Gemmell has a good walkthrough of some items that may be useful to migrate manually.\nIf you need advice on transferring specific items, try searching for them directly on here or Google, or post a question specific to them if you can't find an answer already.\n", "Q: How do I Get Info for multiple items in one window? When selecting multiple items in the Finder and hitting the ⌘+I shortcut, OS X produces one window per file, which is painful when attempting to view a summary of, for example, the total size of a number of files at once.\nHow can I view info for multiple files in a single window?\n\nA: There are two modifier keys that allow you to view grouped info for multiple files (note that the names are derived from what the Finder's File > Get Info menu item changes into when the relevant modifier key is pressed):\n\n\n*\n\n*⌥+⌘+I (alt/option + cmd + I): This opens the Inspector, an independent window that tracks info for whatever the selected files in the focused Finder window are. The Inspector updates as you change selection (or change which Finder window is focused), and remains until it is closed.\n\n*^+⌘+I (control + cmd + I): This opens a Summary Info window, which aggregates info on multiple selected items. Unlike the Inspector, however, it is static and always displays info on whatever items were selected when it was opened, regardless of changes to which items are selected in the Finder, or which Finder window has focus.\n\n", "Q: Parental Controls Always Allow does not work I have enabled Parental Controls on my son's MacBook Pro (OS X 10.8.1, Mountain Lion) and have restricted the applications his account can use. Everything works fine with the exception of Minecraft (of course the application most important to him). Minecraft is marked as an application that he's allowed to use in the parental control settings.\nWhen I try to start Minecraft under his account, a message pops up saying that he's not allowed to run it, giving the following three options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Always Allow\n\n*Allow One Time\n\n*Cancel\n\n\nWhen clicking Allow One Time, I have to enter the admin account username and password and the game starts without problems. But when I click Always Allow, it asks for the admin account as well, but then pops up the same message again. I have verified that I'm using the right admin account username and password, but it's still refusing to run the game.\nWhen I disable parental controls, everything works, but the moment I turn it on again, it fails, despite having Minecraft in the list of allowed applications for his account.\nIn the Console application, I can see the following weird error message whenever this happens:\ncom.apple.launchd.peruser.501[148]: \n([0x0-0x11c11c].com.Mojang Specifications.Minecraft.Minecraft[1216]) \nJob failed to exec(3) for weird reason: 13\n\nHas anybody else experienced this or knows how to fix this?\n\nA: This gave me enough info to fix the Minecraft launcher.  The prior answer works, but has an ugly menu name, which my son would pester me about.  So instead, I fixed the Minecraft.app setup.\nIn a nutshell, in terminal:\ncd /Applications/Minecraft/Contents/MacOS\nmv JavaApplicationStub Minecraft\ncat > JavaApplicationStub << EOF\n#!/bin/sh\n\nexec `dirname $0`/Minecraft \"$@\"\nEOF\nchmod +x ./JavaApplicationStub\n\nBasically, it would appear that ParentalControls expects the application being run to match the name of the executable (which is not the case with the distributed app: It's Minecraft.app, and JavaApplicationStub), so by moving the executable to match the app name, it works.  I had to create a shell script to actually exec the executable because I got \"Path not found\" otherwise.\nThis seemed to work.\nI only put this here because it worked for me.  If you do not understand the code block again, please keep in mind you might have to re-download the app (or make a copy first).\n\nA: I've posted the same question on the Apple Support forums here - quite a few people seem to have the same issue, but no answers so far.\nMeanwhile, I have worked around it and have managed to get it to work on my son's MacBook Pro. Here's what I did:\nI added a shell script called MyMinecraft with the following contents:\n#!/bin/bash\njava -jar -Xms512m -Xmx1024m /Applications/Minecraft.app/Contents/Resources/Java/MinecraftLauncher.jar\n\nAfter saving this file, I made it executable (either through Finder's Show Info or using chmod +x MyMinecraft in the Terminal) and tried running it from my son's account. It worked fine and started Minecraft. So far so good.\nTo make it a bit more pretty, I created a real Mac application from the script - there are multiple options for this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Platypus: http://sveinbjorn.org/platypus\n\n*Create the following directory structure in the user's Application directory: MyMinecraft.app/Contents/MacOS and move the MyMinecraft script there. Now you can add the original Minecraft icon through Finder's Show Info dialog\n\n\nDouble-clicking the MyMinecraft icon should now start Minecraft.\n\nA: When you use /Applications/Utilities/Console.app to watch for errors and get:\nJob failed to exec(3) for weird reason: 13\n\n...it is usually a permissions issue. The symptom is that you will click on an application and it will not launch at all. You will need to make the application binary executable for the current user.\nI do this by opening /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app and running the following command:\nchmod u+x <Application.app>/Contents/MacOS/<application binary>\n\n<Application.app> needs to be changed to the location of the app, and <application binary> needs to be changed to the name of the binary.\nFor Minecraft, if it is located in the root /Applications folder, the command would be:\nchmod u+x /Applications/Minecraft.app/Contents/MacOS/JavaApplicationStub\n\nIf it is located in /Users/jsmith/Applications, where jsmith would be your username on your Mac, the command would be:\nchmod u+x /Users/jsmith/Applications/Minecraft.app/Contents/MacOS/JavaApplicationStub\n\nchmod is the command to change file modes or Access Control Lists. You can read the manual for chmod by running the command: man chmod In this case, we are allowing the file to be executed by the current user. So u+x means \"user add executable permission.\" If you would like to make the file executable for all users, then you would change u+x in the above commands to be a+x.\nI hope this helps.\n\nA: The answer to this problem is date related. If you change the system date to something before 2008 it will cause this problem.\nReset date - then \"Always allow\" the app and voila!\n", "Q: Large ping times in normal mode, okay ping times in safe mode I pinged google.com to see that ping times ranged from 54 ms to over 2000 ms on my MBA. After a quick isolation and testing, I figured that it was my MBA only issue. I log into safe mode on my MBA with Mountain Lion and I suddenly get ping times of around 15 to 30 ms, which I think are normal from my place and thus okay. \nNow that I know ping times are okay in safe mode, how do I hunt down, what might be the issue with my MBA in normal mode? Any clear procedure you advise? \n\nA: This issue affected several people after upgrading to Mountain Lion. For many, reducing their MTU size solved the issue:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences.\n\n*Select Network.\n\n*Select your connection and choose Advanced...\n\n*Select Hardware.\n\n*Change Configuration to Manually\n\n*Reduce the MTU size to 1300. Most people had good experiences with this value.\n\n*Observe how ping behaves over time. You can further reduce the MTU size in steps of 4.\n\n\nHowever, there seems to be another issue: Proxies. The solution suggested here is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences.\n\n*Select Network.\n\n*Select your connection and choose Advanced...\n\n*Select Proxies.\n\n*Turn off Auto Discovery Proxies.\n\n*Apply the settings.\n\n\nBut this should be fixed with an upgrade to OS X 10.8.1 (not sure if an upgrade to Mountain Lion directly brings you to the latest upgrade, or to 10.8.0).\nActually, I would first try the upgrade to 10.8.1. If this does not work, try the proxy solution. If this does not work, try the MTU size reduction.\n", "Q: Is it normal to have duplicate JVMs or JDKs in a MacBook? I just bought my first MacBook Pro a week ago and this morning, I installed the Java for OS X 2012-004 Developer Package at http://connect.apple.com. Right now, I'm encountering a bunch of weird errors in my code and I wonder if what I just did is to blame, since this machine came with Java built in.\nSo when I click on the .jdk file in the Developer Package, this is what I see:\n\nIs that normal? I think they are exact duplicates of each other and might be causing the bugs I'm dealing with right now. I'm not sure if there were four or only two entries before. How do I delete the other JDK if it's a duplicate?\n\nA: That is normal but they are not exact duplicates. To test I just installed the \ndeveloper package that you mentioned. This added the two Java SE6 non system lines.\nSo I think the four packages you see are split by 32 or 64 bit and whether they are the JDK or the JRE needed to just run java and installed when you are asked to run a Java program or web plugin.\nAs to the 'wierd' errors best to show those and the code in a question on Stack Overflow.\n", "Q: How to hide the Flagged folder in Mail.app (Mountain Lion)? Since upgrading to Mountain Lion, my Mail.app has sprouted a Flagged folder for each of my Gmail/Google Apps accounts.\n\nI have no use for this and would like to disable or hide it - how can I do that?\nTo pre-empt some answers, no, this is not a folder that exists in either Gmail account, it's something that Mail.app has made up for itself, much like a Smart Folder.\n\nA: Drove me crazy too, so I made a mailbundle to right this wrong ;-)  Download it here:\nhttp://eelco.lempsink.nl/NoFlaggedMailbox.zip\nNote: I’ll update the plugin every time when Mail.app breaks it for ‘compatibility’ reasons.  Just download it again and run the INSTALL script again to update.  (Might take me a couple of days though.)\n", "Q: How do I maximize the Safari window all the way? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do you maximize windows? \n\nThe green maximise window button in Safari.app is doing a \"smart\" maximise instead of using the full area available. So in most cases, it only grows to the maximum vertical size but tries to work out what it thinks is the ideal width of the web page and grows only to that size horizontally (about 1024 pixels for Stack Exchange for example).\nThis doesn't work so well when using tabbed browsing extensively, as it only uses the frontmost tab to determine width and there might be another tab (open or soon to be opened in the same window) that would benefit from using the whole screen width instead. So I end up manually resizing the Safari window to it's full width a lot.\nHow do I get Safari to always maximise to full size, like TextEdit.app does? Preferably this would be the default, while option-clicking the green button gives me the \"smart\" behaviour, or the other way around.\n\nI'm a bit surprised nobody has asked this question yet, but a search for maximising Safari showed nothing. Please do point me to it if I missed it!\n\nA: The green button is in fact the Zoom button, and does not serve the same purpose as a Maximize button in for example Windows would. You can read more about the differences between Mac OS X window controls and Windows window controls here: http://www.davidalison.com/2010/11/window-controls-mac-os-vs-windows.html\nIn short, whereas a Maximize button's purpose is enlarging the window to take up the entire screen estate, the purpose of a Zoom button is to enlarge the Window based on the resolution and the user interface inside the window.\nSome applications might implement an Option-click for a maximizing behavior, instead of zooming, but this is application specific and Safari does not have such a functionality. Instead, Safari will \"zoom\" the window based on the content of the window, which usually just means enlarging it vertically. If there are horizontal scrollbars, Safari might also enlarge the window horizontally to try and eliminate the scrolling.\nAs an alternative, you can use fullscreen mode in Safari which will always take up all available desktop space.\nIf that doesn't suffice, there are some additional window management tools you can install which facilitate window placement and scaling. I can recommend Moom, which is available in the App Store.\n\nA: A lot of the  solutions (such as Right Zoom) for this are intrusive: they REPLACE the current \"zoom\" functionality, with the \"maximize\" functionality your looking for. Although that \"solves\" your problem, I would advise against it, as the regular zoom is invaluable in many situations, and isn't as wasteful of screen space as maximize.\nThe solution I would recommend is Cinch ($7), which adds Window's AeroSnap functionality to the Mac OS. Holding a window up to the top of the screen with \"snap\" it to full screen, or dragging it to one of the side will make it fill that respective half of the screen. This will allow you to maximize what you wish, but it still retains the zoom buttons ability to optimally increase the size of a window.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro early 2012 SSD retire block count I've recently bought an OCZ Vertex3 480 GB SSD (VTX3-25SAT3-480G) for a drive upgrade.\nThis is what I did after I purchased the drive:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backed up my system with Carbon copy cloner\n\n*Installed the SSD drive\n\n*Install OSX Mountain Lion (fresh install from USB drive)\n\n*Installed some basic apps and tested the speed (500m read, 250m write)\n(I've enabled TRIM via TrimEnabler)\n\n*Attach my backup drive (where I backed up my earlier system) and started copying my data (something like 130GB)\n\n*OSX turned the screen off after 5 min (not sleep)\n\n*Went back to check and the system froze (beach ball + black screen)\n\n*Force shutdown pressing the power for 5 sec\n\n*Reboot and found out that: my brand new SSD had 19 \"retired block\" and 3325114 of \"total error\"\n\n\n(10?). I've upgraded my firmware from 2.15 to 2.22 after I discovered the 19 bad blocks just to make sure it's not faulty firmware.\n\nI got 0 of both when I first booted into the system, after a forced shutdown, I got 19 bad blocks and a bunch of errors.....\nIs this normal? Is there something wrong with my SSD? should I send it for warranty?\nSSD info:\nOCZ-VERTEX3:\n\nCapacity:   480.1 GB (480,103,981,056 bytes)\nModel:  OCZ-VERTEX3                             \nRevision:   2.220000\nSerial Number:  OCZ-1M53V336YLR07271\nNative Command Queuing: Yes\nQueue Depth:    32\nRemovable Media:    No\nDetachable Drive:   No\nBSD Name:   disk0\nMedium Type:    Solid State\nTRIM Support:   Yes\nPartition Map Type: GPT (GUID Partition Table)\nS.M.A.R.T. status:  Verified\n\n\nA: The Block count number you have should not be a problem.\nTaking some information from The SSD Anthology: Understanding SSDs and New Drives from OCZ\nIf your SSD has a 20KB block size, that means that there are about about 25,165,824 blocks for a 480GB SDD and thats not including any of the extra storage that some SSD manufactures include. So only haveing 16 bad blocks out all those block does not look like a problem at all, as for a number that would indicate a failing drive, I am not sure what that would be but I can assume that would be the number of extra block the Manufacture provides, once your SSD uses that up, then you start loosing storage capacity.\nAccording to OCZ Product sheet\n\nVertex 3 2.5” SSD  512GB 480GB VTX3-25SAT3-480G 842024025559\n\nOf Note the 512GB is the Raw Capacity, so it looks like there is 32GB of extra space for block failures, so that works out to about 1,677,721 total extra blocks of storage.\nIf the drive is causing problems like spinning cursors, slowness or crashes see below for more suggestions.\n\n*\n\n*A possible solution try formatting the SSD 1 more time and try running it with out TRIM enabled or any other 3rd party SSD tools software. See if the drive can work on its own with just a clean install of OS X, with out any weird crashes.\n\n\n*If the drive starts acting up again after the clean install and no 3rd party trim enabler on, it could be that there may be a hardware / software incompatibility between the SATA controller on the Mac and that particular drive. I would try to verify the drive is working OK by placing it in another computer or external hard drive case, etc.\nAnd also try searching around on the web for issues between MacBooks and your particular brand of SSD.\n\n\n*If the drive is acting weird on all testing computers and interfaces, then you would have a confirmed failed drive and would have an evident need of a getting the drive replaced under warranty.\nNote: If your having a rough time with the SSD drive it would not be a bad idea contacting OCZ support and explaining to them the issue you are having, they may already have a solution figured out.\n", "Q: Which Macbook Pro USB port should I use to charge an iPad? I heard that one of the two USB ports provides more power, decreasing the charging time.\nStill, I forgot which one is the powerful one. I would be nice to give a hint that's easy to rememeber ;)\nIt is does matter, this is a MBP from Early 2011, not one of the new 2012 series which has a very powerful charging port.\nUpdate! I checked using System Report (you need to restart it after you plug/unplug iPad as it does not refresh itself).\nSo far there is no difference on my MBP, it it provides is 500 mA which is quite low.\nCurrent Available (mA): 500\nCurrent Required (mA):  500\nExtra Operating Current (mA):   1600\n\n\nA: Actually, your Macbook CAN provide extra current for apple products. Your screendump indicates that it is charging with 500mA + 1600mA of \"Extra Operating Current\" which makes a total of 2.1Amps (same as the iPad charger). \nSee here for a comparison - http://www.hardwarezone.com.sg/feature-effective-charging-apple-ipad-2012\n\nA: This is a very interesting question. Apple has a support article about powering peripherals through USB. Apple states that each USB port is supplied with up to 900mA at 5V. There have been a few discussions brought up on various forums about port inequality that I have seen, but I don't think Apple has ever addressed any of the claims.\nThe users who suggested the inequality took it into their own hands to do a bit of testing; I found this very nicely written breakdown. \nSparing the technical details, they ran tests with the front & back USB ports and noticed very small differences. It also suggests that the keyboard/trackpad, memory card reader, and Bluetooth are all connected to the 'front port', and that iSight and IR reciever are connected to the 'back port'. Based on what is connected where and on the numbers from their tests, it appears as though the back port has slightly better performance.\nThis all said, the difference is so small you'd never notice it charging a device (especially from Apple). Using your iPad with either port is fine. There won't be a noticeable difference.\nAs suggested, you'll likely get better charging performance by using the wall cube, rather than charging via USB.\n\nA: Also make sure that the port/device is not being used by Parallels. If you set up your iOS device so it syncs with Outlook on a Windows VM in Parallels, then the current available drops to 500mA. The solution is to temporarily release the device from Parallels, and you will get proper charging ability again.\n\nA: You can use either port, the limitation is that only one USB port can provide this higher power level. If you try and charge two iPads at the same time, only one will get provided with the higher power level, and the decision as to which is made on a first-come-first-served basis.\nEdit to Add: I forgot to mention that the article says Macs with more than two USB ports may be capable of powering multiple ports (but not necessarily all) at this higher power level. Unfortunately they don't give any further details.\nSource\n\nA: Use either port. There is no risk of damaging your computer. Both should be sufficient to charge your device.\n", "Q: How to convert Vmware Fusion virtual machine to bootcamp image i'm using ENVI + IDL software on a windows xp virtual machine. That software is too heavy so i can't work as well on that virtual machine so i need to boot that virtual machine on boot so to have all cpu and memory allocated for windows. Is there something could i do? Thanks!!\n\nA: Converting a VM to a Bootcamp image is not supported and is technically difficult for a number of reasons, not least of which is that a Windows installation for a VM (or any physical computer) will not necessarily have all the drivers needed to run on different hardware.  There are other twitchy things about Windows like the whole license activation thing which tend to get in the way as well.  \n\nA: Although not conventional - you could use a DR (disaster recovery) imaging tool (ie StorageCraft), create a disk-level image backup and save to an external drive, then you would boot from the imaging tool's bootable software on a USB stick and restore it to a bootcamp partition.\n\nA: I think you can open your VM in Parallels. Parallels has a feature that lets you boot your VM in Bootcamp. \nI have not done this myself; you'll have to do further research to verify. \n", "Q: Can different Apple ID co-exist for iTunes and iCloud backup? If I register and actually sign with an unique Apple ID  on iTunes and main account, on iPhone, in order to use different accounts between iTunes and main Apple identity (without having iTunes available on my PC), how should I change the account without losing backed-up data?\n\nA: The description is not very clear, but yes, you can have different Apple IDs for iCloud and for iTunes purchases (if that's what you are asking).\nTo do this: on the iPhone, go to Settings > iCloud > E*nter the Apple ID you want to use for iCloud Backup* > Turn On \"iCloud Backup\".\nNow, to setup a different Apple ID for iTunes purchases, go to Settings > \"App Store\" or \"iTunes & App Stores\" > Enter the other Apple ID to be used for purchases.\nThat way, you can sport 2 separate Apple IDs: one for iCloud backup and one for iTunes purchases.\n", "Q: How to fix the Jerky and jumpy Apple Magic Trackpad behavior?

Immediate 90% improvement.\nThis helps since I am using a 30\" monitor.  \nI have Magic Trackpads for all my other machines.  No problems with them.  Only this machine.\nBTW, also tried resetting the PRAM, cleaning the surface of the Trackpad, changed the batteries, grounded myself, scrubbed my fingers clean, and turned off the internal backup (a hidden function for when the machine is not connected to a Time Machine drive).\nInfo:  MacPro '06, 30\" Cinema Display, 22 Gig RAM. 6 Gig internal storage, 11.5 total storage.  10.7.5\n\nA: It seems that new Alkaline Batteries may do the trick.I was disappointed because after the replacement of the batteries the problem remained.\nBut I see that after some time the trackpad returned to its previous good performance!\n\nA: I know this is an old question, but for my current-model magic trackpad, I used two alcohol wipes; the kind used for insulin injections. I turned the trackpad off, then carefully wiped the entire surface in a grid pattern, then did the same with another wipe, being careful not to get the trackpad too wet. Using two wipes ensures removal of fingerprint skin oil. After wiping, I held the surface of the trackpad in front of my desk fan until it was dry (maybe a minute or so.) I turned it back on and the problem was solved.\n\nA: One other thing to consider is to make sure nothing else is touching your magic trackpad, especially the Lightning cable that's used to occasionally charge it (or some may keep it permanently connected). I had a jumpy cursor suddenly and I couldn't figure out what it was until I noticed that part of the cord was very slightly touching the upper corner of the trackpad. Once I moved it out of the way, suddenly the cursor was behaving normally again. Just something else to consider for folks.\n", "Q: Hard drive defect? Help me recover my music! I've an old iPod Classic with 80 GB of Storage, suddenly it stopped showing any music. I can still access the files on it (with Windows Explorer). Copying all files is possible but it stops at a certain point. I need help, I don't have a backup of my music. Is there still something you can do? (Maybe a program which skips bad files or sth.)\nI tried \"chkdsk\" but it stops after 4% with \"Wrong Drive\" (Falscher Datenträger). iTunes recognises the iPod but wants to restore to factory.\nThe Hard Drive is formatted with FAT32.\nThis is the SMART data from the drive:\nRetracts: 16\nReallocs: 320\nPending Sectors: 192\nPowerOn Hours: 1340\nStart/Stops: 66331\nTemp: Current 32C\nTemp: Min 0C\nTemp: Max 53C\n\nHDD SPEC:\nSNO: 97M4S655S\nFW Revision: VQ110A\nLBAs: 0x950f8b0\n\nI don't have access to a Mac.\n\nA: You could try running SpinRite on the disk, then trying again to get the files off.\nSpinRite (among other things) talks the drive's internal error correction into working better so Windows or the iPod's OS can more-easily read the files. \n", "Q: What software extends quicktime to support codecs as an alternative to Perian? Now that Perian is closing its doors (and thus ending support), I'd like to know if there are any alternatives to Perian - specifically alternatives that add Quicktime support for more filetypes (and thus all the benefits with Apples Video editing/burning applications)\nOf the alternatives that Perian themselves have suggested, none have Perians integration with Quicktime:\nNiceplayer - standalone application that relies on Perian(!)\nVLC - standalone application that doesn't integrate with Quicktime\nMPlayer - standalone CLI program that doesn't integrate with Quicktime\nSo, are there any other QuickTime-integrated codec applications out there? Bonus points if like Perian it's one application that bundles many codecs.\n\nA: If even Perian themselves do not suggest anything that has QuickTime integration — they should know — I assume you are out of luck. I miss Perian, too, but have made the switch to Zongyao Qu’s MPlayerX, which is current, useful and pretty (not the Sourceforge flavor!) …\n", "Q: Needs Office for Mac 2011 Outlook Spotlight? I have deactivated Spotlight, because the mdb process used a lot of memory and I use Spotlight not really often :-) Today I searched some emails in Outlook (Office for Mac 2011) and the mails could not be found, but they are there (I can see them!). Is this only by accident or does Outlook use the Spotlight index?\n\nA: As you suspected, Outlook for Mac does use Spotlight's index files (as do many other apps, such as Alfred). If you've got Spotlight disabled, search in Outlook isn't going to work either.\nSpotlight shouldn't take up any memory really at all if it's not indexing and/or updating indexes.\n", "Q: Offline Use of Sparrow I have a ton of mail to catch up on and a flight coming up.  Does Sparrow (for Mac, not iOS) support an \"offline\" mode?  If I read, respond to, label, and archive GMail messages on Sparrow while unconnected to the internet, will Sparrow correctly \"sync up\" to GMail once an internet connection is re-established?\n\nA: I use Sparrow daily, but haven't ever needed to use it offline. From a few different websites (after Googling), it appears as though people do use it offline, but that it is still slightly buggy. I found a blog post that talks a bit about how it works great offline. There was also this question over on webapps that suggests using Sparrow or Mail.app (if not the offline Gmail feature).\nIt should sync up fine since it's just another IMAP email client, but as usual, be prepared for the slight possibility of some issues arising.\n", "Q: Mac and Windows backup I have a Mac and a PC at home, and I am thinking of getting a NAS like (GoFlex Home Network Storage System or Western Digital My Book Live) to back up both machines.\nIf I were to use Time Machine to backup on the NAS system, would the Windows be able to backup to the same NAS? If you know of any good ways to backup both PC and Mac, do let me know as well.\n\nA: One easy way to do this would have separate shares: one for Time Machine to back up your Macs and another for another program to back up your PCs. \n(The shares could be separate partitions or separate folders on a single partition; it depends on how your NAS is set up.)\n", "Q: How can I associate OpenOffice documents with OpenOffice apps instead of TextEdit? I just updated to Mountain Lion.\nMy documents were prepared in OpenOffice and contain many mathematical equations. After updating to Mountain Lion, the documents open in TextEdit instead of OpenOffice. This is an issue because TextEdit doesn't render the equations properly.\nHow can I re-associate OpenOffice documents with the OpenOffice apps instead of TextEdit?\n\nA: Go to one of your OpenOffice documents in the Finder and Get Info (⌘+I). In the \"Open with\" section, choose the appropriate app in the popdown (OpenOffice or LibreOffice), then click the Change All... button and hit Continue in the confirmation dialog.\n", "Q: How to leave or silence a group ichat? I keep company with night owls. Also, I have an iPhone 4s. Oftentimes, my friends include me in group ichats that start at a reasonable hour, but continue into the middle of the night. Every time I get a group ichat, or any text, my phone vibrates. I want to keep it this way -- except for late night group chats.\nIs there any way to mute or leave group ichats?\n\nA: Do not disturb is a feature that isn't supported in iOS 5.\n", "Q: Copy contents of a smart folder to a new folder in Mountain Lion I admit that my music collection is a royal mess. This is the result of merging many sources of music (external drive, old iPod sync, iTunes purchases, etc) into my iTunes account. iTunes Match has done a pretty good job of cleaning it up visually as I look at it in iTunes.\nWhat I want to do is create a backup copy of all my music no matter where it lives (external HD, etc.) to one location and hopefully eliminate duplicates in the process.\nMore specifically, I setup a smart folder to find all of kind:music with a bitrate over 44kbps. This results in over 20,000 music files at around 485 GB. I now want to copy all this content to my external drive to ensure I have a backup of all these audio files.\nI tried a simple select all and drag to copy, but that didn't seem to work. After a few days of Finder \"not responding\", I killed the process.  Some zero-byte files were created on the external drive, but no sign of progress after the first few minutes.\nI'm wondering if there is a Terminal command that could reference the contents of a smart folder and copy or some other creative way to get this done.\nI really don't want to mess with iTunes, I just want to copy all music files to the external HD. Bash script maybe?\n\nA: You could use mdfind in a shell script to simulate your smart folder's settings (mdfind is how you use Spotlight from the command line). Use kMDItemKind to specify the kind and kMDItemAudioBitRate for the bitrate.\nThen you can use that list of files and copy them to your external drive.\nSomething like this script below. (scp copies files to a server; use cp to copy to a drive. Or, if you want to get fancy, rsync is generally better for incremental backups.)\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfor FILE in $(mdfind 'kMDItemAudioBitRate >= \"44000\"')\ndo\n    scp $FILE myname@myserver:~/music-backup\ndone\n\n", "Q: On Mac OS X, why would a network folder appear dimmed, and not be accessible? I have a user who is using a Mac to connect to our corporate network.  He is attaching to a DFS share on a Windows Server 2003 machine using the IP address.  He created a folder a few weeks ago that has 800+ MBs of data in it.  Now, whenever he selects the folder, he cannot see the contents of the folder, instead he sees a \"Preview\" pane showing the name of the folder, the size of the folder, etc.\n\nAny idea how to allow him to see the contents of the folder?  I've already checked that he has NTFS perfmissions on the folder, and I (and other users) can see the contents of the folder using standard domain user accounts.\n\nA: Since I could not find any way to resolve this, I simply made a copy of the folder, then used Cut-and-Paste to move the contents over to the new folder. I then renamed the old folder as 'Old Folder', and renamed the new folder 'Images New Website' (the name of the original folder). \n", "Q: Prevent keyboard viewer from displaying Whenever I plug my MacBook into my external keyboard at work, the keyboard viewer window automatically opens up.\nHow do I prevent the keyboard viewer from automatically showing?\nIf possible, I'd like to keep the input sources menu bar item visible (the little American flag on the menu bar).\nEDIT: i'm on mountain lion, i've got the viewer un-checked, and i'm still getting the viewer:\n\n\nA: This problem hasn’t bothered me for some time, but I remember it used to occur (though I couldn’t pinpoint the exact circumstances). I have tried two different things:\n\n\n*\n\n*After invoking the Keyboard Viewer, don’t close it by clicking the red close window button, but by clicking Hide Keyboard Viewer on the Input Menu in the menu bar.\n\n*If that doesn’t help, try deleting the Keyboard Viewer preference file: ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.KeyboardViewer.plist.\n\n\nA: Go to System Preferences > Language & Text > Input Sources.

My 8 year old iMac died some days ago. Fortunately, I have everything backed up on my Time Capsule. I just tried to get my photos from iPhoto off it, but realized that all my shots have been compressed down to something between 30 to 80 kB instead of the couple of MBs they should be. Is there any way I can retrieve my photos at their full quality? All my SLR shots just look horrible now. \n\nA: Find your iPhoto Library, which should be in Pictures. It's a package. Control-click on it and select Show Package Contents. You will see a Masters folder. Make a copy of that folder and all its contents by dragging it to the Desktop or anywhere you like, holding down the Option key at the same time — the green plus icon appears. If it doesn't, you're not making a copy.\n", "Q: How to have links open in Google Chrome from emails? Before switching to the Chrome browser app from mobile Safari when I would click a link in a email it would automatically open the page in Safari. Now clicking a link does nothing and I have to copy and paste it into Chome. How to have it open like before but in Chrome instead of Safari?\n\nA: You cannot do this on iOS. Maybe a future iOS will let you select your default browser but iOS, as of version 5, does not. \n", "Q: Midi in browser on Mountain Lion I recently moved on Mountain Lion. It seems that the OS does not allow midi playback in browser anymore. I can't find more informations but this threads: 1 ; 2\nCan you help me to find a solution to get back my good old midi files in web pages?\n\nA: Chrome still allows this, Safari doesn't. It is a per-browser configuration. To my knowledge, Safari does not currently have an option to re-enable this.\n", "Q: Fonts and Fonts Disabled folders in OS X Mountain Lion In my /Library directory I have two folders of fonts - Fonts, and Fonts Disabled. Would deleting the Fonts Disabled folder cause any issues?\n\nA: If you're currently having no problems without those fonts, actually deleting them should not cause any problems. The system just ignores the fonts in the folder \"Fonts Disabled\" so there should be no effect on the system. \nJust be careful you don't delete the following fonts:\n\n\n*\n\n*Keyboard\n\n*Geneva\n\n*LastResort\n\n*Monaco\n\n*LucidaGrande\n\n*Helvetica\n\n\nlocated in /System/Library/Fonts. These fonts are used by the system. \nSee also http://www.macworld.com/article/1051630/tcofonts.html\n", "Q: How to fix  missing icons and labels in System Preferences -> Spotlight? I have a late 2011 MacBook Pro and I started noticing a weird bug in my Spotlight system preferences.\nIt looks like every time I open preferences -> Spotlight an assortment of icons and labels are missing from the Search Results tab.\n \n \nI noticed the following log entries along with this\n\n\nA: Assuming your drive passes hardware verification, you might want to rebuild your spotlight index.\nFirst though, repair permissions as much as possible.\nRebuilding the spotlight index is straightforward but time consuming. You will see that it is indexing as the spotlight magnifying glass icon will have a dot in the center of the glass.\nThis is how to reindex your drive:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch System Preferences from the  Apple menu\n\n*Click on “Spotlight” and then click on the “Privacy” tab\n\n*Drag Macintosh HD (and other drives if necessary) into this window\n\n\n\n\n\n*Click “OK” when asked to confirm\n\n*Now select the drive(s) you just added and click the “-” minus button to remove it from the list (weird right). Note: if an item is left under the “Privacy” list, it will exclude from Spotlight indexing completely.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Spotlight will immediately begin to reindex the drive(s) you added and then removed from the Privacy list. Note: How long it takes to reindex the drive varies, ranging from 30 minutes to several hours, depending on the speed of the drive and it’s contents. At any point, you can pull down the Spotlight menu and check the progress:\n\n\n\n\n\n*The Mac will probably feel sluggish during reindexing as the mdworker and mds processes run and consume a lot of CPU and cause a lot of disk activity.\n\n*After all this, if the problem still occurs, here are some other techniques:\nAlternative #1: Kill SystemUIServer\nLaunch ‘Activity Monitor’ (located in /Applications/Utilities/).\nLocate the process ‘SystemUIServer’, highlight it, and click the red button “Quit Process”.\nWithin a few seconds the menubar will rebuild itself and often Spotlight will magically work.\nAlternative #2: Rebuild the Spotlight Index manually\nLaunch ‘Terminal’ (located in /Applications/Utilities/)\nAt the command prompt, type this exactly (copy and paste):\nsudo mdutil -E /\nYou will be asked for your password, provide it, as this command requires administrator privileges to run.\nYou will receive a confirmation message saying that index will be rebuilt.\nWait until index is finished rebuilding, this can take a while depending on the size of your hard drive, amount of files, etc.\nAlternative #3: Change Desktop Resolution\nThis is a strange fix but it works sometimes.\nOpen “System Preferences” via the Apple Menu\nClick ‘Displays’ and select a resolution smaller than what you are currently using, 640×480 seems to always work\nSelect your native resolution again, changing your screen resolution back to normal\nThe Spotlight search tray will magically become available again\nAlternative #4: Clear caches and preferences\nClear caches and preferences relating to Spotlight, this is best done using a tool like OnyX, MainMenu and/or Cocktail.\nAlternative #5: Clean the Font caches\nSometimes, this is adequate to repair a screwy Spotlight, but it won’t hurt to clear them all\nHope this helps (I got this information from experience, but a lot of the text is lifted from OSXDaily.)\n\nA: It's quite possible these are the first indicators of a possible hardware issue with either the hard drive or the hardware interface between the hard drive and the logic board (motherboard for all those recent PC switchers).\nI would do an overnight backup as soon as possible (make sure you don't over-write your old backup, as it may already be too late to prevent data corruption).\nAfter that, I would check on the integrity of your hard drive.\nTo check on your hard drive, you can download and install an app that checks your hard drive's SMART settings :\nhttp://www.corecode.at/smartreporter/\n\n... polling the S.M.A.R.T. status of your hard disk drives. S.M.A.R.T.\n  (Self-Monitoring Analysis and Reporting Technology) is a technology\n  built into most modern hard disk drives that acts as an \"early warning\n  system\" for pending hard disk drive problems.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*update *\n\n\nI forgot that the built in OSX app, DISK UTILITY, can also check on a hard drive's SMART status.\nThis is a relatively unobtrusive way of checking on your drive.\nYou can also do other checks like verifying directory structures, etc. (I would recommend that you backup your hard drive BEFORE starting any other checks, as a failing hard drive may not have a very long life span before total failure).\nFor other 3rd party commercial hard drive utilities, you can go here :\nhttp://www.peachpit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1620209\n(although, I would personally recommend that you take your mac directly to an Apple Store to have it looked at, since this will give you a better chance to have the exact issue located, than any software utilities can give you).\n\nA: I found elsewhere another solution to missing icons. (I had missing icons in the menu bar and in apps, too.) Simply reboot into safe mode (hold down SHIFT as soon as you hear the start-up sound until the log-in window or desktop appears), then reboot again into normal mode (don't hold SHIFT). Icons all returned!\n", "Q: What is Logger.bundle? I am running a late 2010 MacBook Air running OSX Mountain Lion with latest update.\nLooking around in my system folders I found a file called Logger.bundle and it's in my /System/Library/SystemConfiguration directory. The file logger.bundle was apparently created Monday, June 25th 2012 (so very recently). If I \"view package contents\" inside the /Contents/MacOS directory is an executable called Logger.\nIs this Logger.bundle some sort of trojan or something like that, or is it a normal part of the file system?\n\nA: It's a normal part of OS X.\nThe name isn't very searchable, but you could copy the bundle identifier from the Info.plist. logger.c was the first result for com.apple.SystemConfiguration.Logger site:apple.com.\n", "Q: Open as text option for every file, regardless of what OS X thinks of it \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to permanently put TextEdit in the Open with… menu list? \n\nBeing a programmer, I often work with text files. As you probably know, file extensions are more or less meaningless; therefore, many text files I work with don't have the standard .txt extension.\nUsually I use the Terminal so all is well, but it's a huge pain to open these text files outside of Terminal, because OS X doesn't think they are text files based on the extension.\nSo every time I have to do right click-Open With-Other-look for text editor-Open.\nIs there a way to force OS X to always display my text editor in the Open With list?\n\nA: You can add an action to the context menu to do this, with OS X's Services feature. Depending on your text editor (I'm pretty sure BBEdit offers this), there may already be pre-installed services available, you may just have to activate them.\nTo manage your services, open the Keyboard pane in System Preferences, and select Services from the left hand pane in the Keyboard Shortcuts section. You'll get a long list of services, each with a checkbox (to enable them), and the option to set a shortcut key. Check this list (probably in the Files and Folders section) for a service from your editor. If you find one, make sure the box is checked to enable it, and you should be able to access it in the context menu when you right-click a file (or a hotkey if you set one).\nIf you don't find a pre-made service, you can make one easily.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Automator, and select Service as the document type.\n\n*Change the options at the top to read \"Service receives selected files or folders in any application\" (change the last part to the Finder if you prefer).\n\n*Add the Open Finder Items action into your workflow, and change the Open with: drop down to your text editor.\n\n*Save, and it will prompt you for a name (which gets displayed in the menu).

Initially, I put in my SIM card (from the company Cellcom) and it worked. Then, in order to get my apps and music, I restored the phone through Apple's service. After I did that, the SIM card no longer worked on the phone. I had no success unlocking the phone, so I am returning it to the seller. My question is:  what kind of phone should I get, and how can I transfer my apps and music to it without losing the ability to put in a SIM card? \n\nA: You need to buy officially unlocked iPhone. There is no universal way to tell if particular phone is officially unlocked until you restore it in iTunes and it's still unlocked.\nHere you can find countries/providers that sell unlocked phones if that could be of any hep to you.\n", "Q: Why does the gyroscope in an iPad stop working on an airplane? The gyroscope (not to be confused with the accelerometer or GPS) in my iPad (3rd generation) works wonderfully both when standing still on the ground as when moving at high speeds in a car on the highway.\nHowever, as soon as I try out the gyroscope while in flight on an airplane, the gyroscope returns non-sensical data!\nDoes anyone else experience this? I have tried replicating the airplane conditions on the ground (high temperatures, vibration, driving as fast as possible) but the gyroscope keeps working while on the ground.\nWhy does the gyroscope not accurately work in the air?\n\nA: OK I THINK I FIGURED IT OUT!\nIt was my fault almost entirely, but I have an answer that may be useful to others.\nHere is the deal:\n1: I set the gyros to update at 60 hertz\n2: On the ground, the app RAN at 60 hertz, so grabbed one gyro update per frame\n3: In flight, my app did MORE WORK (!!!) to display what the airplane was doing, and thus fell to less than 60 hertz update rate of the app!\n4: At this point, the update messages from the gyro queued up and the event-reader got behind... WAY behind, so I was looking at real gyro data from EARLIER IN THE FLIGHT!\nSo, the REAL lesson here is that setting the update rate of the gyros to a value greater than the frame-rate of the app results in event queing that has you running behind.\nIf anyone knows how to soak up ALL the gyro events EACH frame of the app, rather than just reading one, then that would APPEAR to solve this issue... whew! Interesting!\n\nA: If the iPhone uses a gyroscope based on tiny parts inside vibrating (sensing changes in vibration under acceleration), it's possible that all the extra vibration in an airplane in flight swamps out the detectable signal with noise.  To test this theory on the ground you'd put your phone in a \"mechanically noisy\" environment with similar characteristics.  A vibration table might work, or it might be too strictly periodic (too close to sinusoidal, not broadband enough) to be a good simulation.  Maybe hold it against the side of a power drill while trying to drill through a heavy board?  Attach it to a bike frame and ride over gravel?\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibrating_structure_gyroscope\nhttp://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iPhone-4-Gyroscope-Teardown/3156\n", "Q: How can I remotely control my iMac user desktop from a Windows computer? I know the IP address of my iMac and I have been able to ssh into the computer successfully, but I want to be able to control the desktop remotely from my Windows machine as well.  How do I enable my iMac to do this?  Is there a special program I need to use on my Windows 7 machine to do control the desktop remotely?\n\nA: You can use VNC to remotely control your Mac. There's instructions around here to turn on the built-in OS X VNC server (it's pretty straightforward), and a Windows VNC viewer (I linked to a Google search because I don't know a particular good viewer for Windows because I don't use VNC on Windows). \n\nA: Your best option is to use LogMeIn. It allows you to set different resolutions, you can perform Mac gestures, and it uses the least bandwidth of any remote control app I have ever used (about 10-15Kbps for a 1280x720 screen). It is cross platform too.\nYou create a LogMeIn account and you can either use the Windows client or the web-based client. \n\nA: Look into TeamViewer. It has a mode to do just just that.\n", "Q: Should the MacBook Air have the same amount of charge as its stated capacity when 'Full Charged'? The following is an extract from System Information (under power):\n Charge Information:\n  Charge Remaining (mAh):   6517\n  Fully Charged:    Yes\n  Charging: No\n  Full Charge Capacity (mAh):   6690\n\nIs this simply an example of the charger not topping up the battery to conserve cycles, poorly calibrated battery or an issue with my machine's battery? \n\nA: \"Fully charged\" does not mean exactly 100%, but somewhere between 95% (or even less) and 100%. Obviously it is better for battery life if the battery is not immediately loaded after a small percentage of charge was consumed, if your MacBook is connected to the charger. So you do not have an issue with your battery.\n", "Q: My macbook suddenly thinks its display is 800x600 I have not found anyone else online who had this problem, which is troubling.\nHere is all I know:\nI closed my macbook (running Leopard, a few years old).\nI opened my macbook.\nThe display had changed completely.\nWhat I mean by that is that the resolution severely decreased, and all of the icons on my screen grew significantly in size, even though they all fit on the screen. I am certainly not in \"zoom mode\" (ctrl+scroll). I checked \"About This Mac\" and under resolution, I found that it says, \"800x600.\" What? My resolution is much above that. I have no idea what prompted this. I restarted the computer, but it did not help. This is very worrying.\nDoes anybody know what happened, or how to fix it?\nThanks\n\nA: Simple solution. Head into system preferences and click on the display icon on the second row. Click on the display bar at the top (on the left of colour) and scroll through your different display options (I recommend 1280 X 800 but you can have whatever you want.

Right click on the Trash icon (far right of the dock) and choose Empty Trash :)\nTo view your hard drive, open a new Finder window. Then in the menu, click Go → Home to see your user directory. Or choose Computer to see your whole hard drive.\n\nA: Diskwave is a really great tool to see what's taking up space on your laptop.\nhttp://diskwave.barthe.ph/\n\nA: Use this command\nfor i in /Volumes/*; do sudo rm -rf \"$i\"/.Trashes/*; done\n\nFinder sometimes gets stuck if e.g. a huge number of small files need to be deleted. Deleting them from Terminal is the faster way in these cases (but slightly dangerous in case of typos). If you want to reduce the risk (and just want to remove your own files)\ncd; rm -rf ~/.Trashes\n\njust cleans out your own trash.\n\nA: Just double clicking on the hard drive should open it in finder window displaying everything on drive. The app Daisy Disk is very nice in that it will show you graphically what is taking up space on your drive.

As I got a new computer recently, I've been trying to get back the stuff that I need for work. However, a few applications (Hotspot Shield is one of them) that requires an installer to install it doesn't seem to work. It gets stuck midway through installation, saying \"Waiting for other installations to complete...\"\nI've enabled Gatekeeper to allow any applications, but it's still stuck.\nWhy is this and is there a workaround?\nEdit: Here's the output in console: \n1/9/12 5:08:07.575 PM coreservicesd[33]: Application App:\"Installer\" [ 0x0/0x338338]  @ 0x0x7f9b686baff0 tried to be brought forward, but isn't in fPermittedFrontASNs ( ( ASN:0x0-0x33c33c:) ), so denying.\n\n\nA: \"fPermittedFrontASNs\" points to the new Gatekeeper Function Apple introduced in 10.8 and which changes the way background processes behave and are able to launch child processes that interact with the user interface.\nThe Gatekeeper-Rule \"Allow Applications downloaded from: Anywhere\" still has some restrictions, as an example at this Apple Support Page points out:\n\n\"Anywhere – Allow applications to run regardless of their source on\n  the Internet; Gatekeeper is effectively turned off.

Specific apps that are experiencing this problem are Coda 2 by Panic, PDFpenPro by Smile Software, and Firefox.\n\nPanic and Smile Software are identified developers if I'm not mistaken. And Transmit by Panic opens fine without these warnings.\nAny idea why this is the case?\n\nA: Solved the problem! The quarantine metadata was not clearing correctly for some reason. I fixed this by doing:\nsudo xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Coda\\ 2.app\n\nBig thanks to Thomas Reed in the Apple discussion forums - Link to answer.\n\nA: If other applications keep showing the dialogs, you could also try disabling the quarantine warnings completely with defaults write com.apple.LaunchServices LSQuarantine -bool false. It also disables the warnings shown by Gatekeeper even if it was enabled in System Preferences.\n\nA: The first time you open the file, right click on it and select open.

My question regards a business with about 2 dozen Macs currently running 10.6.8 in Germany. The licenses would need to be floating licenses, i.e., licensed per seat, not per user.\nSimilar issues have been discussed here and here, but the answers are not applicable to the German market.\n\nA: Unless you cut a special deal with Apple, you will buy one single license for each Mac and you can circulate those machines sequentially to any number of employees. The last time I checked, you would need to purchase 100 OS licenses to get a floating license agreement with Apple.\nThere are two simple ways to get expert advice on the licensing terms of the Mac App store:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ask Apple - since you are in a country with Apple Retail presence you can call any of the stores and speak with a member of the Business team for advice, consultation and assistance. Next would be going to your online store and asking for pre-sales assistance. There is typically a toll free number with assistance in your native language(s) wherever Apple has an online store.\n\n*Read the license for the software. In your case, Mountain Lion would come with a license if you purchased it in bulk from Apple directly so I presume you would know in that case what to do. Otherwise, the App Store terms/conditions take first precedence and secondly the Mountain Lion terms also apply.\nThe Mountain Lion terms appear to be unified for all regions here:\nhttp://images.apple.com/legal/sla/docs/OSX108.pdf\nYou can find the App Store terms at http://www.apple.com/legal/itunes/ww/ as well as from the App Store when you select your Account Information in the footer between the Privacy Policy and FAQ.\nFor you, the direct link is:\nhttp://www.apple.com/legal/itunes/de/terms.html\nMost countries can substitute their two letter abbreviation for de above to get a localized and correct license for Mac App Store licenses for accounts based worldwide.\n", "Q: Homebrew install from a file I want to save my favourite application in a textfile and then install all of them using homebrew later. \nHow can I do this ? \n\nA: This will be a synthesis of three things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Making a homebrew formula that will dump the Applications you care about into the homebrew location. This will require some ruby knowledge and a short read of the homebrew wiki.\n\n*Making a script to copy/shove/move the files from the homebrew location to /Applications or ~/Applications or an alternate destination with administrator permissions\n\n*Learning enough about git to grab the tools. You likely won't be able to merge your \"formula\" with the homebrew repository since it's against their policy to re-distribute software you don't possess the permission (rights) for software code publication.\n\n\nIf you want to do this as a learning exercise, have a great time learning. There are far better tools to package OS X binaries like Package Maker, JAMF's Composer, or Iceberg.\nIf you were uncertain if homebrew was your best option, I'd start with Iceberg and a tutorial like this to handle the permissions.\n", "Q: Screen-saver resizes my windows I have an iMac(27\" from 2010) and while running Lion I tried to HiDPI modes that gives me 1280x720 and larger text. I did change back to 2560x1440 long before upgrading my system to Mountain Lion.\nIf I use the screen saver, or switch to the \"select user to login\" main screen, and then back to my user account, my windows are resized to fit inside a rectangle that looks like 1280x720. This behavior happened in Lion too and the upgrade didn't change that.\nAny idea on how I can get rid of this behavior? I haven't found any .plist file to delete that seemed relevant.\n\nA: I changed the resolution to 1024x768, logged out, rebooted, logged in. Changed to 2560x1440 and logged out and rebooted. That seemed to have fixed it.\nEDIT: No, it didn't fix anything.\n\nA: A few suggestions in terms of plist files worth trying to move to the desktop and rebooting for before I suggest a ML re-install.\n~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.windowserver.XXXXXXXX.plist (just search 'windowserver' in the Preferences folder)\n~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.preference.displays2.XXXXXXXXX.plist (again, just search for 'display' in the Preferences folder)\n~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.systempreferences.plist\n\nupdate more property list files to try to help:\n~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.screensaver.XXXXXXXXX.plist (search 'screensaver' in Preferences)\n~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.screensaver.plist\nAlso, search the name of your screen saver in Preferences to see if that particular screen saver is remembering your last screen size.  \n\nLastly, try resetting your PRAM (Command-Option-P-R) after boot chime.\nAs a very last measure I would try re-installing Mountain Lion. Good luck!\n\nA: So this happened with Lion and you had hoped it would go away with Mt Lion? I've been there too, different problem, but these soft upgrades don't always resolve them. (my issue was emptying the trash took hours and ran my CPU at 145% for the entire time, no one at apple knew what to do, eek!)\nHere's how i solved my bug. Backed up all my files, and did a clean install of OSX. When you upgrade to Lion or Mt Lion the installer creates a small backup partition on your harddrive which you can access by rebooting your computer and holding down the alt key. Keep holding the alt key until your greeted by a screen with your HD and the restore partition, select the restore and make sure you wipe the harddrive. \nThat may take a few hours, but if it's not a hardware issue it's stands a great chance to solve your issue. Good luck!\n", "Q: How can I transfer pictures from a Macbook Pro to an iPad I don't own?

(There is no iCloud account in common between the devices)\nWhat is the best way to send iPhoto images to an iPad?\n\nA: Not perfect for so many images, but the simplest known solution would be the cross copy tool. I created this Open Source project to target the ongoing hassle of inter-device file transfer:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download and install the App called cross copy (or open http://www.cross-copy.net if you prefer the web app)\n\n*Enter the same code word on both devices (the more unique the merrier security)\n\n*start uploading files --- they will instantly appear on the other side\n\n\nTo be honest, the App should (and could) be extended to make multi file upload possible -- otherwise transfering a whole collection of images is much to cumbersome.\n", "Q: (Un)mount internal HDD at will I recently installed an SSD and made it my boot disk, and installed a 1TB HDD on a Caddy, where the DVD-ROM used to be. The one drawback is that having a second drive actually lowers the battery life quite a bit, so hence my question:\nI know I can unmount the drive (eject it) so that it doesn't spin when needed, but, is there a way to re-mount it without having to reboot the Mac? I don't mind if it's a terminal command.\nThanks in advance :)\n\nA: I'm assuming that you're talking about ejecting the drive using the the Finder. If so, then simply unmounting the disk, as opposed to ejecting it, should allow it to remain in the list of attached disks so that you can re-mount it later. For example, using\ndiskutil unmountDisk <device or name>\nin the Terminal can be used to unmount the disk, but still leave it in the available drives list which can be seen by using\ndiskutil list\nwhich can also be used to discover the <device or name> you require. Then to re-mount the disk you can use\ndiskutil mountDisk <device or name>\nNote that all the above can also be done using the built-in Disk Utility application, just use the Mount/Unmount button as opposed to Eject.\n", "Q: Can the Safari 6 omnibar search be changed from google.com to google.co.uk?

It is currently connected through the miniDisplay Port to a second VGA monitor (using the miniDisplay Port to VGA adapter).\nThis morning I woke up the MBP that I had left under Sleep and was surprise to see this.

What could have caused such a problem?\n\nA: I would think that the graphics driver power management somehow failed. If you used a less sophisticated Operating System you would see this way more often. (Especially on Linux I saw patterns like that all the time the driver crashed or before the framebuffer got initialised). If your computer would have been manufactured earlier there was some problem with nvidia chips, however your computer should not be affected.\n\nA: This happened to me once with my macbook pro early 2011 too, and no more since then.

Using Pages ’09, I would like to vertically align a block of text at the bottom of a page, in Text Edition mode.\nThe idea is to have a series of paragraphs that should behave as a block, and always be at the bottom of a page, and be pushed to the next page whenever the content above does not leave enough free room.\nThe behavior would be just like tab stops, but for vertical alignment; a “bottom align” tab stop, so to speak.\n\nA: The only way I can think of is to use footnotes.\nThey do exhibit the asked for behavior, and you can delete the automatically-inserted number/sign in the footnote itself.\nThe limitations, though, are threefold:\n\n\n*\n\n*You have to use end of page footnotes, and since this setting is document-wide, you can't use any other footnote style.\n\n*This fake footnote will increment the footnotes count.\n\n*Most annoying: the insertion point that is bound to the content can't be deleted. It is good that you can define at which exact point you want your bottom block to be pushed to the next page. However, you will have to make the insertion point invisible, and there is no pretty way of doing it. I guess the “least bad” way to do it is to make the text color 100% transparent, and put the insertion point at the end of a paragraph, so that its spacing does not impact the text around.\n\n", "Q: How to export all projects from Aperture?

In my ~/Library/Autosave Information/ folder on 10.7, I have some fairly routine-looking files—a few unsaved scratch documents in applications that use Autosave, and accompanying plists for those apps. I also have 3 folders with names like 64FE2D0E-7447-4086-B7CA-8D59ED769875.genstore.noindex.

According to the Finder's timestamps, they were created back in June, and haven't been modified or accessed since.\nI'd like to free up that space on my drive if possible, but I don't want to go deleting these files without understanding what they are. The names and access times suggest they might be temporary storage for saved state data (although I'm not sure why it would be so big) that didn't get cleaned up. Running lsof doesn't list any process accessing those files.\nDoes anyone know what these files are? Do you have similar ones on your system? Can they safely be deleted?\n\nA: Delete them, they are just caches for an app or an installer.\nA lock file indicates that a process was using them while it was forcibly quit or crashed. Normally, when system processes modify files, they create a lock file for it so that no other process can access it. These files are deleted when the process exits or stops modifying the said file.\nThe presence of the lock files indicates that their process has not accessed them since they were created. That means you have probably not used the app involved. \nSource: https://superuser.com/questions/313878/what-is-a-lockfile\n", "Q: How do I resize the iOS simulator?

(you might want to read the wikipedia article about mac adresses as it explains a lot more and might be available in your native language)\n\nA: Your DHCP server is giving out the IP address you manually assigned to your mac computer to another computer.\nIf you manually assigned the same IP to your windows computer the same thing could happen, but it depends on how the DHCP server is configured.\nThe only way to solve this issue is to put in a \"reservation\" on the DHCP server for your computers and the IP you like.  As is pointed out this is done by matching the IP to your network adapter mac address.\nYou cannot resolve this on your computers, you have to have access to the DHCP server and the DHCP scope to resolve this. If you don't you will have to send a request to your IT department or whoever has access to the DHCP server.\nOnce the reservation is in place on the DHCP server you can still assign the address manually to both your mac and windows computers but it just means that nobody else will be able to get the same address and you will not get the conflict.\n", "Q: How can I find out whether my MacBook is supported by Lion? Lion requires MacBook Late 2008 Aluminium or Early 2009 to install/upgrade. How can I find out whether my MacBook is capable of running Lion if I forgot when I bought it?\n\nA: About This Mac > More Info... will give you a model # and serial #. With those, Apple can tell you whether your machine is compatible. Or you can look in the table on this iMac page on Wikipedia to identify your machine.  Or compare the physical requirements for Lion to what you find in About This Mac.\n\nA: When you look at Apple Menu > About This Mac > More info, these are the specs you need to meet as a minimum:\nIntel Core 2 Duo, Core i3, Core i5, Core i7, or Xeon processor\n2GB of RAM\nMac OS X 10.6.6 or later with the Mac App Store installed\nAt least 4GB of additional disk space to accommodate the download, but more is obviously recommended.\nNote that you will need at least 10.6.6 simply because that is the release that the Mac App Store was included with. Lion requires the App Store to install from, and thus the 10.6.6 requirement to install. 10.6.x is available from Amazon.\nSecond note. The processor cannot be a Core Duo. It must be at least a Core 2 Duo.\nHope this helps\n\nA: From http://www.tuaw.com/2012/02/16/mountain-lion-drops-support-for-several-older-mac-models/\n\nThis means the following Macs which are supported under OS X Lion will\n  not be able to run Mountain Lion (model identifiers in parentheses):\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Late 2006 iMacs (iMac5,1, iMac5,2, iMac6,1) \n  \n*All plastic MacBooks that pre-date the aluminum unibody redesign (MacBook2,1, MacBook3,1,\n  \n*MacBook4,1) MacBook Pros released prior to June 2007 (MacBookPro2,1,\n  \n*MacBookPro2,2) The original MacBook Air (MacBookAir1,1) The Mid-2007\n  \n*Mac mini (Macmini2,1) \n  \n*The original Mac Pro and its 8-core 2007 refresh(MacPro1,1, MacPro2,1) \n  \n*Late 2006 and Early 2008 Xserves (Xserve1,1, Xserve2,1)\n  \n  \n  Update: It slipped my mind that there were two pre-unibody plastic\n  MacBooks introduced between the aluminum MacBook and the plastic\n  unibody redesign, both of them with the model identifier MacBook5,2.\n  Those MacBooks, which still feature the legacy pre-unibody case design\n  and were manufactured in early- to mid-2009, are supported in Mountain\n  Lion because they feature an NVIDIA GeForce 9400M graphics card\n  instead of the integrated Intel GPUs in their predecessors.\n\n", "Q: Sandbox admin privileges I just downloaded the iAntivirus app from the Mac App Store. I wanted it to scan my whole hard drive for viruses, so it presented me with an Open dialog box pointing at the root of the hard drive (so that the computer can get access outside of its sandbox). I clicked ok, and the app started.\nWhat I found odd was that I was never presented with a login box. The program was given access to files in the System folder, Library folder, etc. that only I could edit by typing in an admin username and password. Is this a security issue with sandboxing or is that the way it's supposed to work?\n\nA: The App can have read/write access to a location if it gets your permission using an entitlement as part of the App Sandbox, in other words this is how its suppose to work. The App is code-signed and trusted, its asking your permission, in theory all should be good.\nAs noted in the Mac Technology overview:\n\nApp Sandbox\nIntroduced in OS X v10.7, App Sandbox provides a last line of defense against stolen, corrupted, or deleted user data if malicious code exploits your app. App Sandbox also minimizes the damage from coding errors. Its strategy is twofold:\nApp Sandbox enables you to describe how your app interacts with the system. The system then grants your app only the access it needs to get its job done, and no more.\nApp Sandbox allows the user to transparently grant your app additional access by using Open and Save dialogs, drag and drop, and other familiar user interactions.\n\nSpecifically a developer can implement the following entitlement as noted here in Enabling App Sandbox, this is exactly what you described in your question, so this is probably the entitlement that the A/V program developer had utilized to obtain just read and write access. \n\ncom.apple.security.files.user-selected.read-write\nRead/write access to files the user has selected using an Open or Save dialog\n\nNote that  this is not the same as true administrator user, since the program would not be granted the execute privilege.\n\nA: You're not seeing it correctly. Sandboxing doesn't bypass file permissions. If you don't have write access to a file then having the file-write entitlement won't give you write access to the file. Likewise the NSOpen/NSSave dialogs can't access anything they can't access with sandboxing off.\n", "Q: Launching a new instance of something instead opening existing one? Is it possible to have app launcher(Alfred or Spotlight)  to launch a new instance of an app(Finder, Terminal) instead of taking me to existing instance?\nI know this question: How to make clicking on icon in dock == open new instance addressed an issue for the Dock, but is there a way to achieve the same with app launchers?\n\nA: Windows of applications aren't normally called instances on OS X. You can open new instances with open -n, but there's no way to do that from the UI. Applications with multiple instances also have multiple Dock icons.\n\nIf you actually meant that, you could add an action for it in Alfred:\n\nThere's no standard way to open a new window with open or AppleScript though.

This can cause unexpected behavior.\nThere is no easy way to change the name of an App's prefs plist. Simply changing the name of the App will not do it.\n", "Q: iTunes automatically stops/starts music whenever I start/stop Skype call Couldn't find any similar questions.\nSo I like that my iTunes music automatically pauses when I accept a Skype call, but usually during a Skype call I turn up the volume. Then when my Skype call ends, my music comes back, but blasted in my ears. Is there a setting I should know of to prevent this?\nI am on a Mac Air running Mountain Lion. \n\nA: iTunes has a separate volume control that seems to run independently of the master volume control. It's in the top-left corner, press ⌘↑ or ⌘↓ in iTunes to adjust.\nYours may be too low relative to the master volume.\nSkype too has a separate volume control. In the Skype app press ⌥⌘↑ and ⌥⌘↓ to adjust call output volume only.\n", "Q: Are there external drive enclosures yet with a Thunderbolt interface? I'd like to put some spare disks in enclosures and use the Thunderbolt interface. Does such a thing exist yet? I can't find any. Are there technical issues or licensing restrictions that have stopped this?

It have a 500GB HDD plus 4GB SSD which, as I could check, it uses as a cache for read operations. It uses some kind of black magic to determine the most used data and let it easily accessible through the SSD storage.\nI wonder if I can enable FileVault 2 to encrypt this drive and if it will kill these feature of the hybrid drive.\nI know that FileVault always lead to a performance penalty, but my wonder is if the drive will become unable to determine the portion of data that can be SSD-boosted due to the fact that it will become encrypted.\n\nA: FileVault 2 encrypts the filesystem at a block level.   Despite the data being encrypted the cache in your disk should still be able to work out that particular blocks are being accessed more often and cache them in the SSD.\n", "Q: Internet is slow on an iPad bought in New Zealand, but used in USA I am travelling in the States at the moment. Upon arrival I immediately bought a local MicroSIM card from Simple Mobile. However, the connection speed at times is intolerably slow even when I am in the San Francisco city center. A google page can take 3-4 minutes to open. Simple Mobile uses a different technology called Edge (denoted as E on my iPad instead of the 3g that I am used to). I am not familiar with this.\nI went a t-mobie outlet and asked them for advice. I was told that it is possible that my iPad is locked to New Zealand and using it on a US SIM and plan would mean slow connection, so switching to a t-mobile sim is probably not going to help much. Is this true? Or is it just Simple Mobile's problem? I thought I was pretty familiar with iOS devices. I have heard of unlocking phones, but iPads. Really?\n\nA: EDGE is a technology that predates 3G. It is advertised as being capable of \"peak bit rates\" of 1 Mega*bit*, which is equivalent to about 128 Kilobytes per second, but in practice will be far less.\nAnecdotally, cellular data reliability and speed in the Bay Area is rather miserable due to the vast amount of usage, and also the overall lack of towers within the bay area.\nEven more amusingly in this scenario, iOS devices do not work with T-Mobile's 3G. Either the T-Mobile store rep was poorly educated, otherwise they were making a bold-faced lie to you, since they would be unable to provide a better solution, as they would only be able to provide EDGE capability to any iOS device as well.\nAccording to this CNet article, Simple Mobile uses T-Mobile anyway:\n\nEnter Simple Mobile, an MVNO (Mobile Virtual Network Operator) that I confess I have not heard of until this month. This relatively young carrier alternative (it started business in 2009) offers even cheaper monthly rates, aimed primarily at those who have unlocked GSM phones. This MVNO runs on T-Mobile's network, meaning it uses T-Mobile's existing infrastructure for its service. Simple Mobile offers no phones of its own and relies on its customers to come up with their own hardware.\n\nSo using T-Mobile instead offers no better quality of service. Since you appear to have a GSM iPad, it would appear that your only chance of improved service would be using AT&T, or a smaller carrier that leverages AT&T's network.\n\nA: Nonsense. If the Internet is working at all, the lock-status is irrelevant. They're trying to sell you a new one. EDGE is slow, it is not 3G.\nSwitch to a 3G provider.\n", "Q: Is there a way to save money by disabling SMS and routing to IM? I.e., could I configure a client such as AIM, Jabber, Skype, etc. on my phone and completely switch off SMS altogether? \nWould the sending party be alerted that their SMS won't go through?\n\nA: I cancelled my SMS plan and use iMessage with people who have iPhones and Google Voice with people who don't. Both are free.\nI can still receive SMS messages, but I get charged for them (but it's exceedingly rare that I get one). My wife opted to block all SMS messages. If someone sends one to her they do not get any notification that it is not received.\n", "Q: Is it possible to remove cell borders from Numbers? I imported an Excel spreadsheet that contained a few cells with black lines as their border.  Is it possible to remove these outlines through Numbers (iOS)?\nI have tried copying and pasting, the Format > Cells > Border Style, and deleting the contents, but the black border always remains (and actually spreads if I copy and paste the contents elsewhere).\n\nA: It's not iOS but this is how they've done it on OSX:\nUnder the \"Table\" tab, uncheck \"Grid Lines\"\n\nYou might also set \"Table Outline\" to \"None\" and play with the 3 buttons to the right to add/remove grid lines from the headers.\n\nA: I know this is an old thread but just had this problem and was looking everywhere for an answer including here and ended up figuring it out on my own.\nIf you tap the paint brush then cell and border style the last one at the bottom says set default border when you hit that it removes the borders that are in place.\nThis threw me for a long time because of the wording I thought it was to set the selected cell as the default not to revert to default as in no border \nHope this helps someone else.\n\nA: The only thing you can do is to copy a cell without borders over the one that has. If you type the info in first at least you don't have to remember it.\n\nA: Make a copy of the Excel sheet so you can start over if needed. In the menu bar, View > Show Format Bar (it may already be shown). Highlight the cells in question. Look for these popdowns:\n\nMake sure the border box is set to \"none\". If this doesn't work, let us know if you are getting warnings when opening the file in Numbers.\n\nA: Tap on the cell or table who's border you are aiming to remove. With the cell selected, tap on the paintbrush icon on the toolbar. Select the table menu and then table options at the bottom of the table window. Slide the Table Border on/off button to off. Viola! You've done it.\n\nA: By far the best answer was posted by Stephan Côte back on Dec 22, 2015.  Like Stephan it took me a while using trial and error method as the meaning of the term \"Set Default Border\" was not intuitively obvious.\nJust be aware that this is how to remove a border of a specific cell or a range of cells.  If you want to remove all of the outlines in a table then you should use some of the options using the table option.  If this is the case try using the methods outlined in some of the other posts.\nHere's Spephan's post repeated below.  Remember though, you must select the particular cell or range of cells that you want to remove the \"border\" from before proceeding.\n\"If you tap the paint brush then cell and border style the last one at the bottom says set default border when you hit that it removes the borders that are in place.\"\n\"This threw me for a long time because of the wording I thought it was to set the selected cell as the default not to revert to default as in no border.\"\n\nA: Tap on the table, tap paint brush, tap Table, tap Table Options, Grid Options, switch off 'Horizontal Lines and Vertical Lines'\n\nA: Right click the cell and click on Reapply Table Style.\n", "Q: Is it possible to do conditional formatting in Numbers for iOS? Is it possible to do conditional formatting in Numbers for iOS?  I'd just like to change the text or background colour depending on the cell's contents.\n\nA: iOS Numbers does not support conditional formatting, and it is removed from the document upon import.\nAccording to http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4648 the following changes are made on iOS (my emphasis):\n\n3D charts are converted to 2D charts. Chart data is retained and\n  editable.\nConditional formatting is removed from imported spreadsheets. Cell\n  content is retained.\nTable Categories are removed. Tables remain organized and category\n  names are retained as static text.\nFilters are removed.\n\n\nA: The most recent version of numbers on Mac supports conditional formating rules. \nThe current version of iOS numbers does support conditional formating, but only shows UI for simple rules (like turning a number red when it's negative)\nTo access these, select some cells, then tap the format button (paintbrush), tap format, and then the more info/(i) button next to one of the options. \nFrom there you can chose some simple preset options. \nIf you want anything more complex, use numbers for Mac.\nhttp://help.apple.com/numbers/mac/3.5/#/tan93f5de5c3\n\nA: Yes it is possible.

I'm running Snow Leopard on a Late 2009 unibody MacBook.\nAt the moment I was trying to do some late spring cleaning, and clearing up some HDD space. Now here's the weird part:\nMy User's folder shows that it occupies 179 GB of space. However when I go into the folder and add up the usage of all sub-folders and files within it, it comes to somewhere about 75GB. \nI'm just very curious as to where the other 104 GB resides. \nAny help would be appreciated! \nThanks!\n\nA: Might I suggest using one of the myriad apps available at your disposal to hunt down and find the rogue files that plague you? An excellent option that I found (and free to display the content, though not to delete from within the app) would be the DaisyDisk app. It'll show you exactly what's using up your space in a relatively intuitive/futuristic display.\nFrom there, it's a little matter of simply deleting the files in question.\n", "Q: Apple TV can't always be detected by Mac & iPhone I have both a Mac and iPhone: the AirPlay icon to stream video and music to AppleTV randomly appears and disappears on both of them. \nI think it is a network issue, but I don't know how to solve it, since it might work perfectly one day and the next no device can find the AppleTV.\n\nA: I had the exact same problem. My Mac, iPhone, or iPad wouldn't connect because the icon disappears at random intervals.\nYou can try plugging in an Ethernet cable, however this doesn't seem to permanently fix the problem.\nWhat I did was get a new router that supports dual band (2.4 GHz and 5 GHz). The iPhone uses 2.4 GHz and my Mac and AppleTV use 5 GHz. There was less traffic that way (because of splitting the bands over different devices) through the router and the AppleTV is always detected. This forced the AirPlay option to always appear on my devices. \nYou can check my question and other possible answers here AirPlay option disappeared?\n\nA: After some time I can say that AirPlay regularly works on all my devices. Rarely the rebooting is needed, usually it is avaulable. I don't know why, probably software updates to iOS 6.1 or latest version of Lyon. Or probably, because I've restarted my modem few times.\n", "Q: In terminal, running top, info extends past the view of the window I assume this occurs in more terminal functions than just top.

Any clue as to what to do?\nI have force closed the app, powered off, checked the contact number, all to no avail.  WiFi is active. Have gone thru all steps listed as possible fixes except deleting and reinstalling.  I can't find iMessage in the App store so I don't want to delete because I don't know how to reinstall.\n\nA: Turn iMessage off, hard reset your iDevice and then turn iMessage back on again and it will start working again! I've had this issue on more than one device, most recently after updating to iOS 6.\n\nA: you may have gotten help by now on this issue, but I had it just happen to me on my IPAD ( 4th edition). I called apple, and the tech walked me through a few things, but what really worked, was going to Settings/general/ scroll down to Reset and hit it then hit Reset all settings.  You will then need to sign into your WIFI connection again, so go to settings/WIFI/ and pick your wifi connection and enter your password.   Then when you are connected, go back to messages, choose one of your imessages and see if you can send.  This worked for me.\nGood luck.\n\nA: In my experience, this will occur if the receiver has changed settings for one reason or another, and is no longer \"signed in\" to iMessage on the particular device that they used to be signed in on. Like if they restored their phone and neglected to set up iMessage with the same sign in that you had addressed previously.\n", "Q: How can I save my PowerPoint 2003 presentation (.ppt file) in Windows so that it can be viewed (including animations) on PowerPoint for Mac? I have created a Microsoft PowerPoint 2003 presentation (a .ppt file) using Windows XP.  My colleague has a Mac computer and PowerPoint for Mac.  I would like to share my presentation -- including animations -- with my colleague.  Is there a way that I can save my .ppt file to a form that PowerPoint for Mac can open, and retaining all animations?\n\nA: Your file should be viewable on the Mac without issues, though there are some things you need to avoid. Motion path animations isn't a feature that exists on the Mac version, but it will play those animations in files created on windows. You just won't be able to edit that animation on the Mac.\nYou should also avoid embedding linked content and anything windows specific, such as WMV video. If you need to link to content, it may work if you put the file in the same directory before embedding, and then send both files to the recipient. \nThere is a lot of platform compatibility links, such as http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/powerpoint-help/cross-platform-powerpoint-compatibility-HA010287268.aspx and http://www.pptfaq.com/FAQ00281_PC_to_Mac_and_Back.htm\n", "Q: Execute a folder action on a schedule I am completely new to Automator.

As I've now got a few different Macs in the household, it's become painfully apparent just how much hassle it can be making sure that everything is sync'd properly across multiple systems. Music and other downloaded files as well as documents and photos are easy enough, but when it comes to making sure that installed apps are sync'd, I'm not so sure that it's that easy.\nIt may be, and I may just be paranoid, but I'd like a second opinion:\nIs there anything special about the \"Applications\" folder that apps have their install path defaulted to, or can apps be installed into a folder (say a Google Drive folder) and sync'd across multiple systems?\n\nA: From some experimentation here (not official documentation, so interpret accordingly), it appears that\n\n\n*\n\n*You can run most applications successfully from any folder, but\n\n*Yes, there are some special properties of the /Applications folder.\nI include the caveat \"most\" in point #1 because any application could be written to contain a script that (unwisely) had a hard path coded in it to /Applications/App name.app/Contents/whatever, in which case it would break if run from somewhere other than the /Applications folder. Bad design, but certainly someone could write that way. From experimenting, I did not come across any applications that I use that didn't work when from from various folders in my ~ directory, but others report that such applications exist, and include MAMP.\nHowever, I have found that Applications downloaded and run from various points in ~ do not show up in Launchpad. In contrast, as soon as an app is placed in /Applications, it shows up in Launchpad, and remains there correctly pointing to its current location even if you subsequently move it back to a location in your home directory. I have not been able to determine whether Applications need to be in an officially supported /Applications or ~/Applications directory to properly register Services with the operating system.\nSo my tentative answer here is yes, you can run applications from outside ~/Applications, but there is at least a little that is special about that particular folder.\n\nA: If a bundled application is moved somewhere else, another version is copied to the default location when OS X is upgraded.\nI don't know if it was something specific to my installation, but Activity Monitor crashed on launch on 10.6 if it was moved out of /Applications/Utilities/.\ndefaults -app only works with applications in /Applications/ and ~/Applications/.\n", "Q: How can I remove the Reading List column in Safari?

All My Files is often painfully slow, long beach ball spins when I open a new finder window.\nThe thing is I actually like it...  and I'm wondering if perhaps it's because of all my GIT and SVN repos (many of which have 100's of thousands of small files.

Felt most proper one.\n\nsudo port -v install apache2 solved the problem :/\nstill unbelievable, that same operation from root user was hanging..\n\nA: You need to run macport port command as root best using port as shown in all the examples in the Macports guide This is so that all the processes are set up as the correct user and the files are saved no changeable by other users.\ne.g.\nsudo /opt/local/bin/port -v install apache2\n\nA: Found this answer at http://theengguy.blogspot.com/2012/05/macports-install-gettext-hangs-on-later.html\n\nIf you are having issues with the installation of gettext and other packages hanging on macports, its most probably due to JAVA_HOME not being set. Set it and it should work:\n# export JAVA_HOME=/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework\n# /opt/local/bin/port install gettext\n\n\nYou probably have JAVA_HOME set in your user's environment, but not in root's.

Also, the keys changes don't affect the slider position, or vice versa.\nI've done some searching and testing and the only working solution I've found is to reboot. Not a great solution. I've tried switching output devices (no change) and restarting coreaudio (no change).

I plan on buying parallels.  Someone mentioned that even though i plan on using parallels (so i don't need to reboot to run windows) that I should still do a bootcamp partition and then call up that partition from parallels.\nDoes this make sense?  I don't understand the benefit of why I would do this versus just using parallels by itself (without bootcamp partition)\n\nA: I don't thinks so. I've been using VMWare (same way of working as Parallels) for years now without a partition and I've never suffered any issues.  \nWhen using virtualisation software without a partition, the software creates a dynamic partition which will grow depending on your needs. So basically, it's the same. Only the dynamic partition is a virtual one.\nSo, in my opinion, there is no need to waste a predefined partition on your Macintosh HD. Just let the software do it's job and go with the dynamic partition. \n", "Q: sandbox for testing application I have developed an application and I want to test it in a fresh environment (e.g. as if this is a clean OSX, no custom /usr/local, a fresh ~/Library, etc.).

She has thousands, so it is not feasible to burn them all to CD then rip them all again (in addition to the quality degradation), and I can't buy them all again.\nThanks,\nTim\n\nA: It's obvious Apple has a build in procedure to block this kind of actions.

How can I setup the WiFi so that the iOS device doesn't think there's an internet connection through it?\nI've tried setting the DHCP Gateway to 0.0.0.0 but this just seems to confuse the iPad - the spinning circle next to the Wifi network never disappears even though it has an IP address from the DHCP server.\nUpdate:\nI was able to set the DHCP Gateway to 0 and the Router entry now appears as blank, but the spinning circle still doesn't disappear.\nUpdate:\nSetting the DHCP Gateway to 0 or 0.0.0.0 works fine for Windows, Android and Windows Mobile so I'm beginning to think this is an iOS bug. I've posted a question on the Apple iOS Dev forum here.\n\nA: This appears to be fixed in iOS7 - I set the DHCP Gateway to 0.0.0.0 and the iPad connects with a tickbox rather than leaving the spinning circle.\n\nA: You should define a STATIC address for the WiFi/LAN.

At times it states sent as text message and sometimes it doesn't.  When it doesn't does that mean the message has been sent out?\n\nA: When the bubble is blue, the message is send as an iMessage. If it turn green, it is send as a regular SMS.\nThe iMessages have a build in delivery report and is will tell you tings like 'delivered' or 'read' when the message gets delivered/read.  \nHowever, a regular SMS doesn't provide these options, so you'll have to install some 3th party software to get this kind of feedback. So you have to trust your provider to make sure your message gets delivered.\nIf you have jailbroken your device, there is an SMS Delivery Report repository in Cydia.\nIf you don't like your iMessages to be sent as a regular text, you can simply turn this feature off in the Settings < Messages < Send As SMS\n\n\nA: When the iPhone doesn’t show the “Sent as Text Message,” and the bubble is blue in colour, the message was sent as iMessage.

I just upgraded to Mountain Lion, and now it looks like I need to reinstall the SVN client binary.  I realize I can do this via Homebrew, but isn't this also included in an Apple package in the Mac App Store?\nI heard it was removed from the XCode package...\n\nA: Once you have installed XCode, you can install SVN and other command-line utilities from the Downloads pane in XCode Preferences.\n\n\nA: Xcode actually has SVN bundled in its .app directory. Its available at /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/svn (If you put Xcode.app in your Applications folder). You can add this path to your PATH, then access svn directly again. \nIf you need other Xcode command line tools (like gcc without installing Xcode), you can actually install them without installing Xcode first by going to Downloads for Apple Developers, and download and install the Xcode Command Line Tools.\n", "Q: \"Play on\" UPNP/DLNA device from OSX I have a TV and an AV-receiver which are DLNA-capable and which are attached to my home network together with a Windows 7 desktop and a MBP running OSX Lion. I can access audio from both computers using a DLNA-server software on either computer (built in DLNA-server on Windows, PS3Media Server on OSX). So far this setup works fine and i can browse through my audio on the receiver.\nHowever the TV and the receiver also act as UPNP/DLNA media renderer. For example I can use my phone to display photos on the TV (e.g. using the Twonky app on Android). On Windows, I can use Windows Media Player to play audio on either device without having to touch any remote control. I select the track/playlist I want to listen to, right click select \"Play on\" (maybe not the exact wording as my Windows is German) and select one of the two devices (e.g. the AVR for audio). Now I'm looking for the same for OSX. Either an application/media player which can use a media renderer as output device or an app which redirects all audio output to such a device. Does anybody know such software?\n\nA: Yes, you need to find UPnP Controller for Mac.\nFor example http://oss.linn.co.uk/trac/wiki/Kinsky is one of freeware. You can drag files to your UPnP device to play. Create playlist. Start streaming from UPnP server serources etc.\nHope this helps!\n\nA: The closest I have found is www.skifta.com - you can use your Android phone to start videos from your Mac/PC to be displayed in your UPnP device. Which is almost OK for my needs. You just need to install thing in your Mac and Application in your phone. So phone acts like remote control between your computer and Media center.\n\nA: Try SofaPlay.  There is a free version to see if it will work for you.  The paid version allows unlimited video streaming instead of 2min for the free version.\n\nA: It might be late but I guess AirFoil for Mac does what you want: http://www.rogueamoeba.com/airfoil/mac/\nIt basically asks you to select the software from which you want to redirect the output, and the device on which you to connect.\nHope it helps.\n\nA: This can be achieved with VLC.\nUse Homebrew to install it:\nbrew cask install vlc\n\nthen go to File -> Convert / Stream... (or press cmd+shift+S) to open the Streaming window. Then select you file and click Stream button.\n\nlater clicking the Setup Streaming... button, select UDP as the streaming type and add the IP address where your DLNA device is running. Most of the time, it should be running in port 1900, otherwise check your server settings.\n\nFinally clicking Apply, then Stream will stream the file to your device.\nAlso (UPnP related answer, but not exactly with DLNA protocol), you could stream with VLC to devices using the Google Cast protocol (like a Chromecast). When you open a video, go to Playback->Renderer->Your device\n\nGoogle Chrome has some streaming capabilities as well. Go to Settings button (⋮) -> Cast...\n\nthen you could choose if you want to share your browser's tab or your entire screen's desktop.\n\n", "Q: Can I change my music location for itunes to external hard drive on my mac book pro? I have itunes setup with my music in the Music folder on my mac book pro.  I am now realizing that i am going to run out of space soon so i would like to change this to point to an external hard drive. \nFirst question is what is the best way of doing this?\nSecond question is does this cause a full resync or does it realize that i just moved from one place to another without a required wipe and download?\n\nA: Apple has a support document for this, there isn't very much to add to it...\n", "Q: How can I get Itunes on Mac to see all of my music?

Move the songs you added manually from Finder to the Desktop (for example).\nCheck in iTunes settings that it's set to let iTunes manage the Music Library.\nOpen iTunes and drag and drop the song folder on iTunes (either the window or the icon in the Dock).\niTunes will then copy them and add them to its library.\nYou can now delete the songs you have on your Desktop.\n", "Q: My macbook pro trackpad's right side doesn't go down when pressed When I click the right side of the trackpad it doesn't press down. It's stuck, but the left of the button works perfectly. What's the issue here and how do I fix this?\n\nA: This might sound crazy, but I was having the same issues. I could not figure out what the problem was and it was getting really frustrating. One day I lifted the front and noticed that the battery cover was not flush. So I plugged in the power cord and removed the battery, and I was amazed that the battery was swollen, and in turn not letting the trackpad press down. It was bizzare. \nAfter removing the battery, the trackpad worked perfectly. I don't know if that is your case, but I will be ordering a new battery. A quick search in the Apple Tech website, and it seems this is a common issue with the MacBook Pro batteries. Hope this helps.\n\nA: Is your machine in warranty? If so, your absolute best option is to book a Genius Bar appointment and pop into an Apple authorised repair centre (such as an Apple Store), where they could possibly adjust the sensitivity of the pad on the spot. That's probably the best route even if it's not in warranty, as there wouldn't usually be a cost for such a repair.\nIf you're determined to do it yourself, you'd need a set of appropriate tools for your machine which you can usually find with a Google search. Be warned though that it's very easy to make the problem worse if you don't know what you're doing, as it typically involves removing other parts from the machine to gain access.\n\nA: A good \"WD-40\" style method to fix this is to hold your Mac and shake it around a little. It's surprising how well it works.\n", "Q: Can Chrome v.21 be used without freezing my Mac? Chrome throws many errors, and after a few minutes my Mac freezes.

If and only if my MBP is plugged in to both AC and an external DVI monitor, it will hibernate instead of sleeping. If it is not plugged in to the monitor, it will sleep like normal.\nI have a 15\" MBP, 2.2 Ghz, running OS 10.8.2, with a USB mouse attached, as well as a USB HD and FW Time Machine disk, connected to the monitor via an Apple Thunderbolt-DVI adapter into a DVI cable, with both displays running. It doesn't matter which way the machine sleeps, they all yield the same problem. The console has no weird messages. And disabling sleep is NOT a viable option.\nWhat is causing this abnormal behavior and how can I prevent it (without disable hibernation entirely)?\n\nI followed the instructions to completely disable hibernate, and have run into an even worse  issue. When put to sleep attached to the DVI monitor, the machine will completely shut down. What will let my machine sleep normally?\n\nA: First, try disabling hibernation (safe sleep) entirely:\nsudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0\nThen, to remove any trace of other previous hibernations, run:\nrm /private/var/vm/sleepimage to free ~4 GB (in my iMac's case)\nShould you ever want to turn Safe Sleep back on, run\nsudo pmset -a hibernatemode 3\nIf you want to manage all of this with a simple System Preferences pane and it's worth four dollars for you, there's always SmartSleep.\n\nA: Well, it's hard to be sure since you haven't given the full specs of your setup \nI am guessing the problem is because your MBP has 2 GPUs (\"graphics cards\") (a discrete one and an integrated one) and there's some issue with the discrete one going to sleep that is causing the OS to give up on it. \nObviously the first option is to disable sleep, but not really a solution.\nNext, check the Console (All Message) and look for any messages that happen when you put the computer to sleep.  I expect you will find some sort of error message that may help us figure out exactly what the problem is.  \nIf the console messages don't help, then I recommend you install gfxCardStatus and see if it makes a difference whether you are using the integrated or the discrete GPUs. If it's only a problem with one then you can stick with the other, or complain to Apple that the GPU is broken and see if they will fix/swap the hardware.\n\nA: Okay first of all, check if you have Hibernation set up on Hot Corners.\nHave you tried going into:\n1.System Preferences\n2.Energy Saver\n3.Power Adapter Tab.\n4.See if the Put the hard disk to sleep when possible is checked if so - uncheck it.\nTry it and let me know if it works.\n", "Q: mdfind query on kMDItemFSTypeCode can't find some type codes I just upgraded to a new MacBook with Lion, and having discovered that some of my old apps can't come with, I'm scouring my files for certain types that will need to be converted to future-proof formats. A lot of these files go back to System 7 and some never had filename extensions (d'oh), so I figured the best way to find them would be to search by the old-style creator/type codes.\nI've been using the mdfind command with success for most type codes, but I've discovered that its results aren't always consistent. Here's an example of what's going wrong when I try to find 3DMF files.\nFirst I run mdls to verify the type code:\n$ mdls garage.3DMF\n\nkMDItemContentCreationDate     = 2002-06-24 02:05:20 +0000\n...\nkMDItemFSCreatorCode           = \"OP40\"\n...\nkMDItemFSTypeCode              = \"3DMF\"\nkMDItemKind                    = \"3dmf\"\n...\n\n\"Ah, so it's '3DMF',\" I think. So now I run mdfind on the same directory to verify it's working:\nmdfind -onlyin . \"kMDItemFSTypeCode == '3DMF'\"\n\nBut nothing is returned! In fact, nothing comes back when I run it over the entire drive, even though I have 3DMF files scattered all over.\nRunning a general query (mdfind 3DMF) seems to do the job, but it's overkill and returns a lot of false positives. Is there something obvious I'm doing wrong here?\n\nA: You have to translate the type code string into an actual type code (a number).\nFor your '3DMF', that number is 860114246. Thus, this will work:\nmdfind kMDItemFSTypeCode == 860114246\n\n", "Q: Can you make iTunes forget a device?

Up until recently, it was reliably connecting my husband's Mac Pro (wired), my Mac Mini, our iPad, and a couple of video game consoles (all wireless) to the Internet. The problem started when we bought a network storage drive (wired), mainly to back up my husband's computer. After we got it set up with Time Machine, the router started requiring daily hard resets. After checking around online, I tried updating the router's firmware and eventually got it to accept the latest version. The need to reset to router has decreased since then, but we're still need to do it from time to time. The bigger issue is that our connection speed on the iPad is ridiculously inconsistent. I've been getting anywhere from around 25Mpbs - where it should be - to well under 512k. \nNEW UPDATE: I've been experimenting with position of the router and it's antennae with limited success. Connections speeds on the iPad remain high in the basement, low on the second floor, and super variable one the first floor. (I realize that the basement is not an ideal place for the router, but I don't have a better option and it worked previously.) I've been on the first floor doing nothing and had SpeedTest record speeds around 25Mbps, around 13Mbps, and under 1Mbps in the space of half an hour.\nSo now the question is, why is my router performing so poorly when it was fine just a few weeks ago? How can I get it back to providing reasonable speeds for my entire house?\n\nA: When you added the NAS to the LAN did you move the router?  It's possible that even a very minor shift in the position of the router or the antenna could impact the shape of the signal zone.\nYou might try pairing up with your husband where one of you is in by the router and the other in key use-areas and recording signal strength based on the location, orientation and position of the router and router antennas. (don't know if this model has external antenna, if not rotating the router itself).\nThere are tools that can give you more detailed report on the signal strength, for instance you might want to download and install Kismac on your MacBook.  Kismac and similar tools can also give you some insight into what other networks might be interfering with your own.  If you see strong signals on the same channel that you are using you might consider moving your network to another channel.\n", "Q: Can these 10 steps for creating a podcast episode be automated? This is my first time trying to put together a recording of something which will become a podcast, and it seems like I have 10 \"post processing\" steps which I am currently doing manually.\nIt's entirely possible (in fact, it's likely) that I'm doing this in a way which is much harder than it has to be, but I don't know how to automate and/or simplify it. I'm hoping others who know more about this process might chime in and tell me how to make it simpler.\nI'm starting with an AIFF file which has to be edited (cutting off time at the beginning and ending). This strikes me as the only step which can't be automated.\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit AIFF in Fission to just contain the recording\n\n*Export as AIFF\n\n*Open Intro (a pre-recording mp4), Outro (same), and new recording (AIFF) in QuickTime7\n\n*Create new document in QuickTime7, and then Copy/Paste: 1) the Intro, 2) the new recording, and 3) the Outro.\n\n*Export AIFF from QuickTime7\n\n*Open AIFF in Levelator\n\n*Import leveled AIFF in iTunes\n\n*Export leveled AIFF to MP3 (iTunes) at a certain bitrate\n\n*List item\n\n*Add tags to MP3 (iTunes) checking to make sure I'm using same tags I used in previous episodes in all required fields except for the episode title which is different.\nIt seems like steps 2-10 should be something I can automate, even the tagging, except for the episode title, which I can manually add before I upload it to the server.\nSo how can I automate this, or otherwise make it easier / less error-prone?\n\nA: For a good summary about how other people do it see How we do our home work which documents how the Home Work podcast gets recorded and post-processed:\n\n\n*\n\n*QuickTime for audio recording\n\n*GarageBand for audio editing\n\n*Levelator \n\n*Sound Studio to adjust the sample rate, mix down to mono and add metadata\n\n\nDepending on your setup and your quality requirements you can at least combine #1 and #2 by recording directly in GarageBand and also add intro/outro parts.\n\nA: You could use sox to merge files\nsox intro.aif podcast.aif outro.aif output.aif\n\nlame or ffmpeg to convert them to mp3\nlame input.aif -m mono -V 2 output.mp3\nffmpeg -i input.aif -c 1 -aq 2 output.mp3\n\nand mid3v2 to add ID3 tags\nsudo easy_install pip\nsudo pip install mutagen\nmid3v2 --track 1 --song 'Podcast #1: Title' --album Podcast output.mp3\n\n", "Q: Are there any cons to buying a used iPhone 4S unlocked by a Gevey sim? In comparison to a factory unlocked iPhone, are there any cons to buying a used iPhone 4S unlocked by a Gevey sim?\n\nA: The big downside is that the phone isn't really unlocked.\nApple could patch the exploit that allows it to work in a firmware update. Also, you may have to re-unlock it every time you power off your phone or lose signal for more than a couple of seconds. Some people also report poor signal and battery performance with it.

When I open the lid, there is a black screen, but the fans are still running. My only option is to force reboot by holding down the power button. When It finishes rebooting, only half of the installed RAM is recognized - System Information shows that Bank 1 is empty when there is actually a stick of RAM installed. I have tried swapping out the RAM, booting from other disks, reinstalling, and searching for evidence in the log files, but the problem persists. The Apple Genius Bar didn't even know what was wrong with my computer. I am at a loss - what could be the problem?\n\nA: If you've tried reinstalling and resetting PRAM / SMC etc and it's still occurring on a clean install then that rules out a software issue. If you've tried another ram stick that rules out faulty ram. \nSorry to tell you, but it sounds like a motherboard issue, which means $$$. That's the only other thing I realistically think could be causing the ram fault.\n", "Q: What to ask when buying a used iPhone 4 I'm in the process of procuring a used iPhone 4. What are things I should ask and know about prior to closing the deal?\nSomeone mentioned to me that I should ask:\n- If it's still under warranty\n- If it's new, replaced (for $200), or refurbished\nWhat else?\n\nA: Make sure at the least you know all of the above.\nThere are no hard and fast rules about buying second hand products, but mostly common sense and getting the greatest idea possible about what you're buying before committing.\nIf its from a friend or someone you know, you're immediately in a better position as its easy to see the phone and hopefully you can trust them.\nIf it at any point however seems too good to be true, it probably is.\nThe price on the site for a new iPhone 4 is currently £429 for 8GB so the question to ask is why are they selling it for half of that. It may be because they just have no need of it and aren't looking for lots of money and want a quick sale, or they may have got water damage, been unable to charge it, and are trying to get rid of it for as much as possible. (I had a water damaged 3GS and if someone had offered me £200 for it I would have laughed at them!)\nI would ask for a serial number so you can use the support section of Apple's website to check about warranty, etc.\nPerhaps a picture of all surfaces to show any scuffs or marks.\nAnd ask if it is locked to a network. Its very easy to unlock if you are techno-minded but you can be charged to do it at a lot of places. (This is not a huge issue for the most part.)\nOther than that it's mostly common sense, if you want to go as far as ask for a video showing it working fine, then that could work. ButI would say, if it doesn't feel right at any point, just don't bother, save for a little longe,r and buy a newer one from a reputable source. Not to say this person isn't completely honest at all. But it's better to be safe and wait a little than get a broken phone and be down £200. I hope that helped, maybe at least to confirm what you might have thought.\nAlso, it's important to know if the phone is GSM or CDMA (which will affect what plans you can buy), and which carrier it's locked to -- if any. This is especially important with iOS6, which can only be factory unlocked.\n", "Q: Can you auto subscribe to a podcast directly from an iphone? Normally I subscribe to podcasts from my Mac and it downloads the latest ones automatically.  I was told that I can now just download podcasts from my iphone directly.  I didn't see any ability to subscribe to podcasts directly from the iphone.  Is that possible so when i wake up in the morning i automatically have the latest episodes downloaded?\n\nA: I don't know if you can subscribe to podcasts within Apple's own Podcasts app. You can, however, subscribe to any podcast with the excellent Downcast app.\nWith Downcast you can set it to check for podcasts at a certain area. For example, when you get home, it will check for and download your podcasts.\n\nA: \nApple's free Podcasts app can indeed subscribe to podcasts (and it interfaces with the Music app's database, so the podcasts show up there as well). However because iOS apps are restricted from running schedule tasks in the background, you can't have it update every morning.\nDowncast and Instacast are the two most popular 3rd party apps, both will subscribe and download podcasts, but have the same restrictions—no scheduled background checks for new episodes, but Downcast does support location-based triggers to check for and download new episodes.\n\nA: it looks like with the updated podcast app (1.1) you can autodownload podcasts when you are in WIKI area\n", "Q: How to use Cocoa Emacs as editor for Mutt I'm taking yet another run at Emacs.  I've installed Cocoa Emacs, and so far so good.  Now I'd like to use Cocoa Emacs as my  editor for Mutt.  With MacVim,  it's trivial to use Macvim, i just put:\nset editor=\"vim -o -f\"      # editor to use when composing messages\nin my .muttrc, and everything works.  When I want to compose a mail, I type m in Mutt and a new Macvim window opens on top, when I quit, I'm in the Mutt mailing screen (where I can put in cc, attachments, and type y to send).\nWhen I've found anything about using emacs with Mutt it's always been a very complicated explanaition.\nSurely there is a simple way to get emacs to do this? \nThanks,\nJohn V.\n\nA: With Emacsclient, keeping Emacs running all the time\nEmacs uses a slightly different setup than e.g. vim. The editor itself can remain active all the time (because you may have it open for other things as well) and you use a utility called emacsclient to connect to it (pass a file to edit) if you need it.\nAdd the following line to your config file (.emacs):\n(server-start)  ; Starts server for (among others) emacsclient\n\nOr, if you don't wish to keep the server for emacsclient running at all times, you may issue the command M-x server-start to emacs when you're ready to run. Issuing that command is probably the right thing to do when you're already running emacs, unless you want to reload .emacs.\nAll you have to do now is to make sure that MUTT uses emacsclient as its editor. You can do this by adding the following line to your config file (.muttrc):\nset editor=\"emacsclient\"\n\nRecent versions of mutt (at least 1.4.1) require the following format:\nset editor=\"emacsclient %s\"\n\nSource: Emacs and MUTT\nStarting Emacs every time\nset editor=\"emacs %s\"\n\n", "Q: How can I recover my MS Office 2011 product key? I want to use Migration Assistant to transfer my data from a Macbook Pro to a Macbook Air.

I had the game \"Plants vs Zombies\" purchased on the Apple App Store (for Mac) when the computer was using Lion.  Now I made a new partition and installed Mountain Lion on the new partition.\nAnd when I use the App Store to try and install the game on Mountain Lion, it says it is \"Installed\", and using the \"search\" at the top right part of the screen, it actually can find \"Plants vs Zombies\" and even won't list that it is on \"Mac HD\" (some apps will show \"Mac HD\" to tell it is not on this new partition of Mountain Lion, which is call \"Mac HD 2\".)  So it can let me run it... but I think it may be less clean that way.\nSo is there a way to install it on Mountain Lion?  I think it is more robust if the app is installed on Mountain Lion instead of relying on an old partition.  (what if the old partition is to be deleted a year from now?).  If I Optionclick the \"Installed\" word on the App Store, it will not do anything.\n(I also don't want to just \"copy\" the app from the old partition to the new partition, as it is some what a brute-force copy and may not be too robust that way).\n\nA: I've run into this before, and there really isn't a perfectly clean way to do it.

How do I fix this?\nIf the disk in question is your Mac OS X startup disk and your computer stops starting up at the blue/gray screen, restart with Cmd-S held down, and enter the following commands:\nmount -uw /\nchown root /\nchmod 1775 /\nexit\n\n\nA: You should be able to do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot up while holding the \"Option\" key (or command + R for lion and mountain lion users\n\n*Since this is a Lion (or later) system, one of your boot options is \"Recovery\" - pick that\n\n*Once the recovery partition boots up, go to the menus and select \"Disk Utility\"\n\n*Find your Macintosh HD drive in the list on the left, select it\n\n*Go to the First Aid tab\n\n*Select \"Repair Disk Permissions\"\n\n\nThis will take a little bit, based on the size of the disk, but you'll be up and working. After the permissions are repairs, it's a good practice on HFS+ (your filesystem) to choose \"Repair Disk\" also.\n", "Q: \"DefaultKeyBinding\" Hex code for ML's \"⌘ ⌘\" Start Dictation command? I have a set customized keyboard bindings located in a plist file at ~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.Dict which works with Hex keys like..\n\"\\UF729\" = \"moveToBeginningOfLine:\"; /* Home */\nor for \"Non-Printable Key Codes\", like so..\nBacktab ( ⇧tab)   \\U0019\nI'd like to add a new keyboard shortcut for the start dictation commands in Mountain lion, aka, ⌘⌘.\nIs there such a code?  Or is NSresponder making them up on the fly, other private magic, etc.?\n\nA: Changing the actions of double-presses of modifier keys is probably impossible. There isn't even a code point for the fn key in CORPCHAR.TXT.\nBut if you're looking to add a different shortcut for toggling speech, you should be looking for method names instead of shortcut strings.\nI tried using strings to find method names for starting dictation. startDictation: and startSpeechCaptureForDictation: seemed promising, but neither worked in DefaultKeyBinding.dict.\nEven if you were able to change the shortcut in DefaultKeyBinding.dict, it wouldn't work in applications that don't support the customizable keybindings.\nWhat's wrong with just changing it in System Preferences?\n\nIf you want to use a shortcut that isn't allowed, you might be able to change CustomizedDictationHotKey in ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.speech.recognition.AppleSpeechRecognition.prefs.plist.\n", "Q: Restore from Time Machine after installing Bootcamp Can I setup Time Machine to backup my Mac and then install Bootcamp?\nThen after installing Bootcamp, can I go back to that restore point so Bootcamp will be gone?\n\nA: No, Bootcamp will create a fysical partition on your Macintosh HD. If you restore your Mac  with TimeMachine, the software will only detect your Mac-partition and restore it's data. It will leave your Bootcamp partition in tact.\nIf you want to get rid of the Bootcamp partition, just run the Bootcamp assistant again and it will allow you to delete the Windows partition with one mouseclick. \n\nA: If something goes wrong, simply start Boot Camp Assistant again. You can use it to delete the Windows partition, during which process the Boot Camp Assistant will also (and automatically) merge the deleted partition with the Mac partition. It will do so without you losing any data from the Mac partition (but you will lose everything on the Windows partition, of course).\nIn other words, after you use the Boot Camp Assistant to delete the Windows partition, the partitioning scheme on the drive should be identical to how it was before you used Boot Camp and installed Windows in the first place.\n", "Q: Is it possible to have more than one active windows on Lion? I am in a situation where I really need to have multiple windows to be active simultaneously. I know it is against the optimization principle of most operating systems, but is it possible?\nHere is my story: I will be presenting a network project this weekend at somewhere far from my university. We have a working demo that shows a synchronized car racing game. Ideally, to present our demo I need at least two Macs: I can make our demo run on all machines and show the effect of synchronization. However, I have only one Mac - my laptop. So I came up with a solution: to run multiple instances of our demo software on my laptop. I tested it and it worked fine. Although it's networking on the same machine, it is still networking. But the problem is: Lion would only give me one active window at a time. I can switch between windows of couse, but only the currently active window would update, other windows just remain static. To show a synchronized game, I need multiple windows to be active - I want the multiple demo windows to update simultaneously, as if they were on different machines.\nTo re-state my question: I want to place, say four windows on my screen and I want all of them to be active windows. Is that possible at all on Lion?\n\nA: Although it doesn't work with all of the applications, you could use the flag -n for the Terminal's open command.\n\n-n  Open a new instance of the application(s) even if one is already running.\n\n", "Q: How to hide preview of text contents from Messages.app notifications in Mountain lion?  In Mountain Lion's Notification Centre, I don't like having a notification pop up with the contents of an iMessage text I just got, but I do want to have notifications about it happening.\nIs there a way to make it just show a notification without the content, similar to the iOS setting to not \"Show preview\" that hides the text content from the iOS notification center?\n\nA: If you go to Notification center in your Settings on mac, and then click Messages and then you have an option of \"Show Message preview\" you can turn it off and I think it will only show the name who it came from but wont show the actual message. If that was your question.  \n\nA: This is not possible with the currently available notification options and configuration of Notification Centre.  The three options you have are\n\n\n*\n\n*No notifications\n\n*Banner\n\n*Banners that stay until clicked\n\n\nYou have no control over the content of the message, its just shows what is sent by the notifying application.\nSo looking at iMessages, there is no way to change or limit the notifications that are sent by default to the Notification Centre.\nSo the only solution I can come up with is to turn off iMessage notifications completely in Notification Centre\nThen using iMessage's built in ability to run Applescripts when events are triggered, then send your own notifications without the offending content (more private IMHO for work machines) to Notification Centre by using third party scripts.\nOf course, those notifications would have your own defined content and would also have to come from an application that is enabled in Notification Centre.\nThis thread might give you a start on how to create a notification that can be called from Applescript.\n\nA: This should now be possible as of macOS High Sierra 10.13.4. In:\n\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences -> Notifications -> Messages \n\n\nYou can now uncheck an option for 'Show message preview'\nHope that helps!\n\nA: There is an option to \"show preview\" that can be ticked off in the settings of the Messages app: Go to Settings> Notification> Messaging. \nStated another way:\n1) Go to Settings = Click on the GEAR icon (System Preferences)\n2) The top-most section of System Preferences on My Mac is labeled \"Personal\" at the far right is \"Notifications\" (a black square with a red dot in the center)\n3) Click that square and the dialogue window will show a list on the left which should include \"Messages\" with a sub title \"Badges and Sounds\"\n4) Click that item in the list on the left and you will notice on the right side, toward the top it has three options (the default is Banners).  Click the item to the left of Banners (should be None).\nNow you can press CMD+Q on your keyboard to close System Prefs and the alerts will stop popping up in the upper right of your screen (you may want to test it)\nThis was an issue for me because I was allowing one of my staff to use my Macbook for some training and all my personal iMessages kept popping up in front of her -  NOT COOL.  This ended that problem\n", "Q: Can I install the preinstalled Mac OS X Mountain Lion on other Macs? I just ordered a Mac that will be shipped with Mountain Lion. Is it possible to install Mountain Lion on my other Macs? Or do I have to buy an upgrade in the App Store?\n\nA: No. The preinstalled copy of Mountain Lion is not licensed to be installed on additional machines.\nFrom the Software License Agreement (2.A.):\n\nPreinstalled and Single-Copy Apple Software License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, unless you obtained the Apple Software from the Mac App Store or under a volume license, maintenance or other written agreement from Apple, you are granted a limited, non-exclusive license to install, use and run one (1) copy of the Apple Software on a single Apple-branded computer at any one time. For example, these single-copy license terms apply to you if you obtained the Apple Software \n  ￼￼￼preinstalled on Apple-branded hardware.\n\n(emphasis added)\nYou will have to buy an upgrade in the App Store for your other Macs, however for non-commercial use you can install a single App Store purchase on multiple machines, given all the computers are in your control.\n", "Q: Can a keyboard shortcut force TextEdit windows to close and discard all changes? Is there any way I could configure TextEdit to close the window (through keyboard shortcut) without asking me if I want to save an unsaved file?\nCan be another script/program configure globally when triggered with a certain shortcut or just a script for TextEdit. \nThe reason for doing it is that I have a lot of temporary notes in TextEdit's window and I want to close them as fast as possible. \n\nA: tell application \"TextEdit\" to close (windows where name of its document is \"Untitled\") saving no would close the \"Untitled\" document without saving it, tell application \"TextEdit\" to close every document saving no would do the same for all open documents.\nYou could close the current window with tell application (path to frontmost application as text) to close window 1 saving no. It would close all tabs in some applications that use tabs though.\nIt's easier to just press ⌘W⌫ in my opinion. You can disable the animation for showing the sheets with defaults write -g NSWindowResizeTime -float 0.001.\n\nA: If you hit cmd+option+q to quit the app (or hold down Option while quitting from the main menu), it will give you the option to discard changes in all unsaved windows at once, rather than having to tell it to discard changes in each window individually.  This will work with all Apple apps, not just TextEdit.\n\nA: Solution 1:\nOpen Script Editor and run the following:\ntell application \"TextEdit\" to close windows saving no\nSolution 2:\nIf the documents still reopen on next launch, they are most likely saved in iCloud/TextEdit. In order to prevent them from being re-opened:\n\n\n*Quit TextEdit\n\n*Archive all the files in the iCloud/TextEdit folder (and/or delete the unwanted Untitled documents).\n\n*Delete all but the Archive.zip\n\n*Empty Trash\n\n*Reopen TextEdit (it should have a clean state).\n\n*Unzip the Archive.zip to restore the deleted files.\n\nIf your TextEdit session is just Untitled Documents, it might be sufficient to just delete all of them and empty the trash.\n", "Q: How to troubleshoot web errors on the Apple developer forum? I have an AppleID and paid $99 dollars to enroll in the iOS Developer program. I tried creating new thread in iOS Developer Forum but end up in blank white screen. I couldn't see anything on the screen. \nHas anyone a suggestion on what the requirements (or how to troubleshoot) the developer forum web page when you run into issues?\n\nA: Usually things like that are caused by browser extensions or an odd interaction between a specific browser version and the code on the site.\nHave you looked over the basic support page for the Developer Forums?\nhttps://developer.apple.com/support/resources/developer-forums.html\nIt has a \"contact us\" form if you can't solve this by ensuring an up to date (and unmodified) version of Safari isn't rendering the web site properly for you.\n", "Q: On my MacBook Pro, how can I open a picture in Photoshop that is in my iPhoto library? I have imported a bunch of photos from my iPhone into iPhoto. I notice that it saves my full photo library as a single file (12 GB in my case) and when I open iPhoto it works fine.\nI now want to open a particular picture in Photoshop (CS 5) on my Mac and I cannot figure out how to choose a specific photo (given my whole library is just a single file).\nIs there some special way to do this? It seems like everyone who uses Photoshop and iPhoto would have this issue.\n\nA: You can set Photoshop (or any image editor) as an external editor in iPhoto. (Preferences -> General -> Edit Photo: Choose from the Drop Down Menu.) This way, when you double click a pic to edit in iPhoto it will open automatically in Photoshop or your Image Editor, and when you save it it's sent back to iPhoto automatically. \nThis is the only way that edits made in another application will be displayed in iPhoto.\n\nA: In the open file dialog, the images from iPhoto are available from the media selector in the Finder window as the screenshot shows.\n\n\nA: You can also directly drag the image thumbnail graphic from iPhoto to the Photoshop icon. Generally, I would like to encourage you to try dragging stuff around — it amazing to discover what actually works!\n\nA: I don't have a Mac with a recent OS in front of me, but what you have described is my workflow at home -- I import to iPhoto (mostly so I can share casual images quickly) and then open images I want to work with in Photoshop from inside iPhoto.\nIf I'm remembering correctly there is a preference in iPhoto to set an external editor and then if you right click on a photo in iPhoto there is an option to open the image in an external editor. Again if I remember correctly, the preferences can even tell iPhoto to send Photoshop the RAW image if that is what you imported.\n", "Q: Sync my Music from Windows with the correct Added Date?

The app should support offline editing of documents, spreadsheets and sync them back to Google Docs.\n\nA: You can go to www.docs.google.com and upgrade your account to a Google Drive account (I believe you can also do this from www.drive.google.com). Google has an iOS app for their Drive service (just search the app store for “google drive”. You get 5gb of free space for uploaded stuff, and docs created in google docs/drive do not count towards the 5gb.

I travel a lot, so often rely on WiFi for calling. On the iPhone, I use MagicJack to get completely free calls over WiFi/VoIP to US numbers. I'm looking for a similar app to enable me to call UK numbers for free on the iPhone. Does anyone know of one?\nNote:\n\n\n*\n\n*I'm talking only about apps that allow completely free calling to regular chargeable numbers - primarily landlines but ideally also mobiles - the Apple app stores are full of apps that allow \"cheap\" calling.\n\n*Suspicious apps that require credit card numbers upfront, etc., aren't as interesting.\n\n\nA: Skype provides a free iPhone app and allows free calls to UK freephone numbers 0800 etc. As for a service that allows totally free calls to chargeable UK numbers (either on iPhone or otherwise) for an indefinite period I can't say I have ever heard of one.\n\nA: Vonage app will do this, as long as your registered number is in the UK. During the registration you enter your number into the vonage app, it then send you a text to verify you have access to that number. Once you are registered all calls to your local country (if vonage as presence there) are free. \n\nA: Phone calls are cheap enough nowadays.\nThere is currently no app that will give you indefinite free calls to regions such as the UK. You already benefited greatly from such a US/Canada app, don't be greedy. 2 cents or 1 cent per minute being offered by the popular apps to call UK is not going to kill you, and if you cant find one that wont give everything away for free then dont make calls then, simple :)\n\nA: Get yourself the Yuilop app. It's free and exactly the app you are looking for.\n\nA: To be honest any VoIP system, be it Skype, AIM, etc. will allow you to contact anyone else with that system for free via an internet connection.\n\nA: I have been using voip for quite sometime now, but i think voiphub.net is the cheapest and  they charge per second. they can also offer you free calls depending on your destination and subscription.\n\nA: I think you should use Vtok or Google Voice since you can make free calls in any wifi area and you are still allowed to text!\n", "Q: Is it possible to enable kerberos on OS X 10.9 without joining the Active Directory domain? I would like to be able to take advantage of Kerberos without having to join my machine to the domain.\nWhy? Because this is a personal machine and we are not allowed to join them the corporate domain (nor we can).\n\nA: Here is my partial success so far.

However, no matter which one I select, the From: header is still set to my main Gmail address — so the email recipient still sees my main address.\nIs there a way to make this work as expected, without adding the secondary email address as a separate account?\nNote: I’ve added the secondary email address via the Gmail web interface → Settings → Accounts → Send mail as.\n\nA: In Mail 9 (el capitan) this is done by adding the new address as an \"Alias\" in the Preferences.\nMail > Preference > Accounts tab > Account information tab. Above the \"Email address\" Field you will see \"Alias\". Click, and click \"edit Alias\". Click the plus (+) icon on the bottom left, and add the email address and name.\nOf course the address must be properly set up and authorised as an extra account in the Gmail interface itself first.\nGmail > Settings > Accounts and Import > Send mail as.

As a former Windows and Linux user, I've been challenged several times to have hardware devices not share some particular IRQ line.\nIf I understand correctly, IRQ lines are part of the hardware architecture (x86 for example), and Operating Systems (such as OS X) provide some means to configure peripherals and inspect current usage of interrupt lines.\nThis can be found at /proc/interrupts on Linux systems and on Device Manager on Windows systems.\nWhere can I see that information on an OS X? Is it never needed?\n\nA: Mac OS X configures the IRQs completely automatically (much like Plug&Play), and does not expose these to the user.\n", "Q: What potential dangers arise from a mass iOS UDID leak? Can anyone enlighten us with what a hacker could use one (or a list of) UDID for?\nThe leak reported September 4 of 1 million UDID's by AntiSec makes me worry. But should I?  \nWhat is the worst case scenario with a hacker who has a million UDID's?\n\nA: As bmike notes, UDID on it's own isn't particularly damaging. However if the attackers are able to compromise other databases where UDID is used, the combination could yield quite a bit of identifying personal information, as this article from May, 2012 lays out: De-anonymizing Apple UDIDs with OpenFeint.\nAs with the recent highly-publicized Mat Honan hack, one security breach on it's own may not be overly troublesome, but the damage can grow exponential if the attackers can breach another service you use.\n\nA: Now that more \"truth\" has come out, this leak was from a third party company, Blue Toad and by all reputable accounts, the leak did not in fact contain the either volume of UDID or the additional personal data that would strike anyone as \"concerning.\" The leak was of data collected according to the existing policy by Apple and the app store and is not at all unique as hundreds of companies will have that volume and type of data due to the past use of UDID to identify customers.\nThe leaked document itself is mostly harmless from a technical standpoint, but quite shocking if you expected to be private and now have some details exposed publicly.\nIt contains one line with the following types of information for each device that is purported to be listed:\nUDID, APNS token, device name, device type\nUnless you are a programmer and run a service that could push a message through Apple's push notification service (APNS), then you can't really take any action whatsoever based on the leaked file.\nIf you do have records of transactions that list a UDID or a device name / type and wanted to confirm another piece of information, this file could be used to link two pieces of information together if you already had that information. \nThe real security ramifications are that this \"leak\" is from a spreadsheet file that supposedly contains 12 million entries - not the million that were leaked. The best information we have (if you believe the words of the release text which has some mild profanity if you care about that sort of thing) is that the real data that was stolen also had very personal information like zip codes, telephone numbers, addresses and full names of people associated with the UDID and APNS tokens.\nThat sort of information in a the hands of a skilled person (government employee, hacker, or simply an engineer with a grudge against you) is something that could do damage to most of us in terms of violating our privacy. Nothing in this release would seem to compromise the security of your using the device - but it does make things that would normally be seen as anonymous less so if the FBI is regularly carrying around lists of millions of subscriber information that would let them tie logs of application use to a specific device or a specific person.\nThe worst case event with the data leaked today would be someone who has already registered with Apple to send push notifications could perhaps attempt to send unsolicited messages to the million devices (assuming the APNS tokens are still valid) or otherwise correlate a device name with an UDID if they had access to sensitive logs or a database from a developer or another entity. This leak doesn't allow remote access in the way that knowing a password and user ID would.\n", "Q: Upgrading a Mac from Leopard to Lion I've two Macs: one MacBook Pro Core 2 Duo with 10.5.8 (Leopard) and the other MacBook Pro Core 2 Duo with 10.6.8 (Snow Leopard).\nHow can I upgrade the Leopard Mac to Mountain Lion while leaving the Snow Leopard Mac as it is for now.\n\nA: Most of what you need is in this Ars Technica article.\nEssentially:\n\n\n*\n\n*Purchase and download Mountain Lion on your 10.6 Snow Leopard Mac. \n\n*Follow the instructions from the article (or elsewhere here on Ask Different) to make the bootable disk.\n\n*Put the disk into your Leopard Mac and upgrade!

If I close the lid for less than a minute and reopen it, it doesn't go to sleep while the lid is closed. The screen is still displayed immediately after reopening. Also, a few seconds after I open the machine, it will go to sleep on it's own. I have had the software checked and that doesn't seem to be the problem. What could be causing this and how do I get it fixed? It is still under warranty.\n\nA: If there is a process that is preventing sleep (rather than a bug in the sleep implementation), you can use \"pmset -g\" in a terminal window to list the process that is doing that. This is covered over on superuser.\nHere is an an example on my system. First, with nothing preventing sleep:\n$ pmset -g assertions | egrep '(PreventUserIdleSystemSleep|PreventUserIdleDisplaySleep)'\n     PreventUserIdleDisplaySleep             0\n     PreventUserIdleSystemSleep              0\n$\n\nThen I start music in iTunes:\n$ pmset -g assertions | egrep '(PreventUserIdleSystemSleep|PreventUserIdleDisplaySleep)'\n     PreventUserIdleDisplaySleep             0\n     PreventUserIdleSystemSleep              1\n    pid 264: [0x0000012c00000108] PreventUserIdleSystemSleep named: \"com.apple.audio.'AppleHDAEngineOutput:1B,0,1,2:0'.noidlesleep\" \n    pid 95390: [0x0000012c0001749e] PreventUserIdleSystemSleep named: \"Nameless (via IOPMAssertionCreate)\" \n\n\nA: How long does it take to get to sleep on its own if you leave it?\nI'd suggest looking at the log entries in the Console.app to see what's happening when it tries to go to sleep.\nA few things that I've encountered that can make a Mac slow to sleep:\n\n\n*\n\n*Nearly full hard disk (can make it slow to write out the hibernation data)\n\n*Misbehving drivers (like, oh, I don't know, VMWare's virtual networking) that don't go to sleep quickly.\n\n\nAside from looking at the console for hints and checking your free disk space, this is the sort of thing where doing an SMC reset might actually be applicable.\n\nA: Your problem same me.

You should see a link to Buy a serial number below the serial text-box, as in the picture below:\n\nGo ahead and click that link. I didn't buy it online using this method back in the days, and I know not exactly where it takes you, but I'm guessing it should take to to some site where you can purchase a serial number with your credit card. \nIn case this link is useless for some reason (perhaps it is takes you to some website telling you to buy it on the MAS), I suggest calling Apple directly, or driving by an Apple Retail Store someday (or a retail store selling Apple Products) as they occasionally are left with spare boxed copies of software (I have seen a few iWork boxes still on my local Office Max).\nGood Luck!\n\nA: You can always try LibreOffice Impress for free from the LibreOffice suite. It can open and save to the PowerPoint format, as well as the OpenDocument format. It can also export presentations to SWF for playback on a machine with Flash installed. \nOne caveat is that you will need to enable (or install, if it isn't already present) the Java Runtime Environment for your Mac.\n", "Q: Mountain Lion - Cycle though windows not working on Terminal Since updating to Mountain Lion, the keyboard shortcut for cycling through windows is not working for me in Terminal (and is driving me nuts!).\nIs there any known fix for this issue? The keyboard shortcut shows up on the Window menu as expected, but doesn't work.\nI am, of couse, pressing CMD-`, and is not cycling. Selecting the option from the Window menu does cycle through the windows, though.\nUpdate: Although not resolved in Mountain Lion, this got fixed in Mavericks. It was weird: it works properly on Lion and Mavericks, but breaks on Mountain Lion.\n\nA: Check the Keyboard Shortcuts tab of the Keyboard System Preference-- make sure that Move focus to next window is set to your liking (in the Keyboard & Text item) and that there are no conflicts with any other shortcut settings.  Barring that, a complete re-install of ML has fixed other quirks that cropped up when I upgraded.\n\nA: I've been using MoLion for months and have never experienced this issue (and I would have). I tested this again just now with several terminal windows open, and no issue. \nYou are pressing cmd - ` , right?\n\nA: Are you getting 'cycle through windows' confused with 'cycle through tabs'?\nCycle Through Windows shortcut is CMD-` where Cycle Through Tabs is CMD-}\n", "Q: Can Applescript be used to automate a screen recording session on OS X? I need to accomplish the following tasks from a script:\n\n\n*\n\n*Initiate a screen recording (with system audio).\n\n*After a set delay, stop the recording.\n\n*Save out to a file.\n\n*Close the recording.\n\n\nI've tried a few different approaches here and ran into roadblocks. One thing I've tried for example was a QuickTime script found here.\ntell application \"QuickTime Player\"\n    set newScreenRecording to new screen recording\n    tell newScreenRecording\n        start\n        delay 10\n        stop\n    end tell\n    set newDoc to last item of (documents whose name contains \"Untitled\")\n    set f to \"\" & (path to desktop) & \"quicktimeFile\"\n    export newDoc in f using settings preset \"Quicktime Movie\"\nend tell\n\nThis script doesn't error, but it doesn't save anything either. \nIn the past I've used iShowU HD, but I've ran into significant performance issues there which have caused me to go back to the drawing board. \nI'm willing to pay for a third-party application provided that it meets my requirements, so feel free to suggest anything that could get the job done.\nRunning OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion. \n\nA: Try this script:\ntell application \"QuickTime Player\"\n    set newScreenRecording to new screen recording\n    tell newScreenRecording\n        start\n        delay 3\n        stop\n    end tell\n    tell last item of documents\n        close\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nIt will make a new recording for 3 seconds (edit the delay 3 line to change the length), which gets automatically saved in the Movies directory of your Home directory, then closes the recording window.\nIf you want to automatically export to a different format, you can do that by adding the line export in (\"\" & (path to desktop) & \"quicktimeFile.m4v\") using settings preset \"480p\" before the close line. The presets you can choose from are defined in the File > Export dialog:\n\nCheck the actual dialog for further details on the presets (note that they are \"up to\" the resolution listed - it will fit into the horizontal pixels available, so \"480p\" gives you 640x400 for a 16:10 recording). As far as I know, you can't make custom presets.\nIf you want to capture your system sounds, and not mic/line-in audio, check out this question: Can I get system sound along with QuickTime Player screen recording?\nFor the curious, there are a couple notes about why the original script doesn't work and QuickTime Player's AppleScript peculiarities:\n\n\n*\n\n*The set newDoc […] line tries to grab the most recent document with the string \"Untitled\" to account for the newScreenRecording reference becoming invalid once the recording is stopped (which is probably a poor design decision, but oh well). However QuickTime Player under Lion (and possibly Snow Leopard) auto-saves screen recordings as \"Screen Recording\", \"Screen Recording 2\", etc., so it was finding no documents. Having it grab just the most recent document solves this, and future proofs it to a degree.\n\n*The export line references a preset that no longer exists (or has been renamed). Unfortunately neither QuickTime nor AppleScript gives any errors about this, it simply fails silently (more poor design).\n\n*The AppleScript dictionary for QuickTime Player lists a save action, but I couldn't get it working—I suspect the functionality was killed, but the dictionary entry wasn't removed. You'll note that there's no Save functionality in the GUI, only export (and auto-save). So if you want to change the save location without exporting a new file, you'll have to get the file location, then move it through the Finder.\n\nA: I recently wrote a script which does not depend on the version of QuickTime at all.\nIt just simulates actual user actions to save/export the movie.\nIt takes as input the directory you want the movie file to be exported to, and the number of seconds you want to recording to go on for.\nCheck out the script (and the associated blog post) at http://www.neerajkumar.net/blog/2013/02/16/script-to-record-screen-on-mac-osx-and-save-on-disk/\n\nA: Not using applescript but still useful; I found a solution that works really well. You're able to record with ffmpeg using an input device called avfoundation.\nDetails\nMore options\nffmpeg options\nHere is an example command: ffmpeg -f avfoundation -pix_fmt yuyv422 -i \"1:1\" -t 10 -vf crop=1280:720:1:65 -r 30 output.mkv\n\n\n*\n\n*You may or may not get asked to specify -pix_fmt when this option is not included; it might be worth trying other formats to see if you get better performance.\n\n*As explained in the details link, -i selects both video and audio input. If you want to capture audio playing on your computer, you'll need something like iShowU Audio Capture. To get that to work, you'll need to press option+F11, select iShowU Audio Capture as an input device and as an output device. You'll notice that once you select it as an output device that you can no longer hear the audio yourself through your speakers or headphones. A quick fix is opening Audio MIDI Setup, create a Multi-Output Device and adding iShowU Audio Capture and your normal output device. Select this new Multi-Output device in your sound outputs and there ya go, you can now hear the audio and have it captured. Unfortunately you aren't able to control the audio levels now...if someone knows a solution to this please let me know.\n\n*-t is the time in seconds to record.\n\n*-vf is very useful for cropping and offsetting. The current setting is cropped to 1280 width 720 height, offsetting 1 pixel to the left and 65 pixels from the top. You'll need to use a third party tool to get exact pixel measurements of your screen.\n\n*-r is framerate\n\n", "Q: What version of Ruby ships with OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion)?

You'd think A) I'd know this by now, and B) that it's readily available info, but apparently neither is the case. \nWhat I'm looking for is where the config files (colors, etc.) that ship with Terminal are kept on the system. It'd be really handy to point to these in a /dotfiles/setup.sh file. \nAm I being oblivious? I've checked the package contents of Terminal.app, but nothing is there of note.

What does AirPlay over WAN do? I have an AirPort Express 802.11n. This was the last generation to hook directly into the outlet.\n\nA: I believe it refers to accepting airplay connections from computers connected to the wired ethernet port on the AirPort Express. The port's primary purpose when the AirPortExpress was first released was to connect to a cable or DSL modem. Apple and many other home router makers refer to this as the WAN connection. However, I think it only supports AirPlay when the AirPort Express is being used to bridge wired devices onto a WiFi network.\nI base this on my interpretation of this review of the AirPort Express on Small Net Builder:\n\nSince the Music screen is unique to the Express, I grabbed a copy of it. The screenshot below shows that the controls are pretty simple. The Enable AirPlay over WAN feature really works, since that's where the iTunes server I used for a quick test sat. Administration from the WAN worked just fine, too.\n\n\nA: If the AirPort Express is being used to extend your network and plugged into another router via the WAN port, you will be able to use AirPlay from devices connected to your other router.\n\nA: It allows the use of AirPlay from outside your private network. WAN= Wide Area Network.\n", "Q: iTunes help switching songs from one user to another I'm sharing a computer with my sister and she has her iTunes completely disorganized. I created my own user account on the computer, and am wondering how I can move the music from the iTunes to my user account. I go to file, library, export library and save the file but that's not working.\n\nA: Go to Home > Music and copy the \"iTunes\" folder to an external drive.\nIf you don't have an external drive big enough, you can move it to Macintosh HD > Users > (Your User Name) > Public > Dropbox. (You can copy it directly to your music file from another user, as those folders are only editable when you are in your account).\nLogin to your user, and move the \"iTunes\" folder from wherever it is to Home > Music. Open iTunes: your sister's library should be loaded.\nPSS: I by no means am advocating the copy of copyrighted content with this post. I imply your music is legally downloaded, and you are moving the library with the intent of organizing it and not duplicating it in any way. Don't do illegal stuff! \n\nA: I would copy the files over using external media (hard drive, flash drive, etc.).\n", "Q: What simple text editors exist that do not convert files as TextEdit does? Is there a simple text editor like Notepad (or Notepad++) on Windows for OS X? TextEdit cannot open all types of files and TextWrangler is not \"simple\", for my opinion TextWrangler is meant to work with projects not simply single files. \nI want to open any types of files and see their source/binary code. Then I want to be able to save the file without any auto converting (as TextEdit does).\n\nA: Textmate 2\nSublime Text 2\nSubethaedit\nsmultron\n\nA: I think the closest equivalent would be NovoEdit.  I find NovoEdit to be an extremely simple, yet helpful text editor when it comes to handling any kind of file.  This reminds me of Windows' Notepad.  And although I agree with @CajunLuke on the fact that TextEdit is able to open anything by forcing it to, I see myself using NovoEdit far more often than TextEdit simply because of its speed and ease-of-use.\n", "Q: Migrating Local Folders from Thunderbird to Mail.app I am moving from Thunderbird to Mac mail on my iMac running OSX. If I uninstall Thunderbird will the local folders I created in Thunderbird remain on my computer for importing later?  I don't want to bring all of them over now, but would like to have the option of doing so at a later date.  I don't want to uninstall Tbird and then have the local folders disappear.\n\nA: All your Thunderbird data, including the local mail data is stored in the Profile folder, located either at ~/Library/Thunderbird/Profiles/<Profile name>/, or \"~/Library/Application Support/Thunderbird/Profiles/<Profile name>/.\nDeleting the Thunderbird app won't delete any of the data there, unless you use a 3rd party uninstalled app like AppZapper. You can of course make a manual backup of those folders for added safety.\n", "Q: Why does GarageBand have the older window control buttons? This isn't a huge deal, but it is kind of bugging me since I actually like the smaller ones that were introduced in Lion better than the bigger ones. In all other apps, the \"traffic light\" window controls look like:\n\nBut, in GarageBand, it looks like the old ones in Snow Leopard and older:\n\nDoes anyone know why it is like this? Did Apple purposely design them to be like this when they made GarageBand? I mean, it's not a big deal once again, but it kinda bugs me since I'm used to the smaller, more refined window controls.\n\nA: Garageband probably draws its own window. I'll try to explain:\nYou see, when creating an app, you can use a stock window which the OS provides, and automatically comes with all the functionality of a window, or you can \"draw\" your own custom window, in which case you need to code everything yourself, and provide the button images. \nGarageband's window is different from the \"stock windows\": it has that wooden left and right borders, which require the buttons to be pushed to the right. That means they probably draw their own window, which allows this level of customization. The garageband app has bitmaps for the buttons and draws them itself, instead of \"asking the OS to do it\".\nOther apps simply call for the \"stock window\". If the OS changes this \"template\", all the windows that rely on it automatically change.\nOther apps might use custom windows too, but embed bitmaps for different visual versions of OSes. Nevertheless, this is a lot of work for minor details and not all developers do it.\nI guess this will be addressed in a future version of Garageband. It's not a big deal as you say, so perhaps not soon, but yeah, I would also prefer the app to be more consistent to the OS. \nHope it helps!\n", "Q: Mountain Lion: Problem With Permissions I recently tried compiling Textmate 2 now that it's open sourced. Followed all the directions hereand downloaded all the dependencies. Now, when I tried to build (using ./configure && ninja) I received the following error: \nmake: *** [/Users/~/build/TextMate/Frameworks/SoftwareUpdate/fixtures/secret.pem] Error 1\n\n[6/1169] Copy ‘\"Frameworks/OakFoundation/src/NSString Additions.h\"’…ninja: ERROR: mkdir(/Users/~/build/TextMate/include/OakFoundation): Permission denied\n\nninja: build stopped: .\n\nNow, I figured that maybe Mountain Lion messed with permissions, so I gave it the ol' sudo try.

I tried just checking my bash profile and I get a permission denied error on that too! I've ran \"repair permissions\" in disk utility for posterity and getting the same error. Anyone run into similar issues?\n\nA: Looking at the first error message from make it seems as if the paths got configured wrongly by configure. So just rerun it and make sure to specify any required paths in full (without ~). \n\nA: When you're installing unix applications on MacOSX the installer needs to to be run as root.\nTry typing\n./configure && sudo ninja\n\nor just\nsudo ninja\n\ngiven that you've already run configure.\nAll going well you should be prompted for your password (it won't print asterisks, just type the passowrd and press return.)\nIf this doesn't work it's probably because you don't have root enabled.

The ISP is technically my university, so the device is set in \"bridge\" mode to avoid double NAT errors. When I check the network diagram when firing up AirPort Utility, however, I can see other AirPorts that my classmates are using in their rooms.  I want to know if it is possible to hide my AirPort from them so they cannot see mine like I can see theirs.  People get bored and nosey at the university.  \nTechnically I cannot access their devices because they are password protected and so is my device but I would like to be safer if I can.  \n\nA: Someone can downvote, edit or comment if I'm wrong on this, but I don't believe this is possible.\nNormally, you can only see the AirPort from inside the private network, and by default it doesn't advertise or allow configuration on the outside interface (i.e. the internet). Because you're using bridge mode, though, there's no distinction between the networks. To prevent it from advertising its existence, you'd have to disable Bonjour entirely on it. The utility doesn't have an option for this, as far as I can see.\n", "Q: Does -tef in the extension stand for anything in documents saved to iCloud in ML? When you save a new iWork document under Mountain Lion you are given the default extension of .pages-tef or .numbers-tef. These files appear to be directories and a different format than your standard .pages or .numbers file (I haven't had the chance to create a new Keynote preso yet).\nDoes 'tef' stand for anything? Are these just 'iCloud compatible' files and they've been dubbed '-tef' as the extension? Apple isn't one to name things without a specific intent and nothing specific comes to mind.\n\nA: This seems to be the iCloud version of the iWork file format. A good article about it (albeit still without explanation of the acronym) can be found on Mac Observer.\n", "Q: Read-only on Mac and PC I need to give out a USB pen drive with my music on it to a load of editors, but I want the drive to be read-only on both Mac and PC so that no one can inadvertently delete the originals.\nIs that possible? I was thinking formatting it on a PC as NTFS read-only and then Macs will only be able to read from it, is that the best way?\n\nA: Assuming you have not already bought a suite of USB drives for this task, there are USB drives with hardware write-protect switches. It doesn't prevent anyone from flipping the switch back, but it sounds like you're not concerned about malicious intent, just making sure the editor(s) don't do something foolish.\nThis question has also been asked and answered on Super User. The accepted answer suggests that you should just set the contents of the drive Read Only. You could do this on one master drive, and then use something like Carbon Copy Cloner or Super Duper to replicate the data with the read only bits intact to multiple other devices.\n", "Q: Search for one letter only In Apple apps with a search feature, how do I only search for one letter?\nLet's say I'm reading a math paper, but forgot what the variable \"s\" meant. In Windows/Linux apps I could just include spaces in my search (\" s \") and it found all instances of the lone letter \"s\". This does not work with my Apple apps and a search for \" s \" returns all occurrences of the letter \"s\", ignoring whether the \"s\" is part of a word or not.\nThanks!\nPs. the specific program I'm using is \"Preview\".\n\nA: You quote your search string (put the quotes in the query)\n\" s \"\n\nto force Preview to match the exact query\n", "Q: What software can add a Windows-like taskbar to the Mac OS? What's the best Windows-like taskbar for a Mac?\n\nA: Dock is the alternative for taskbar. Once you have Dock visible all the time (default), all the windows will use the remaining spaces.\nI assume you are new to mac. I suggest to go through Dock 101 article from Apple. You can also refer Switch 101 - On Windows, I used to...\nWelcome to Apple userland :)\n\nA: There is now one. Check out iTaskbar :)\nI'm affiliated to the product, but at the moment it's the only product in the category. To create a taskbar on OS X is not as trivial as on other operating systems. ;)\n\nWe hope it will be helpful to all those people who, just like us, need a taskbar to work efficiently.\n\nA: Philip, I would recommend you follow jm666 setup as per answer (above).\nIf you definitely need something that approximates a Windows-like taskbar, I would go with something like Hyperdock :\nhttp://www.techerator.com/2012/02/make-your-mac-more-like-windows-7-with-hyperdock/\n\nTo come down firmly on one side of the Windows vs. OS X debate is\n  somewhat missing the point. There are always going to be things that\n  one OS does better than the other. Utilities like HyperDock give you\n  the best of both worlds, and what I like best about this app is that\n  it works seamlessly, without the flaky unpredictability that I\n  associate with Windows UI enhancements that I have tried in the past.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nA: I developed uBar, which is a taskbar for OS X. It is very well maintained and while it is a Windows-style taskbar it follows the OS X aesthetic which is important. Feel free to check it out, I hope you'll enjoy it.\n\n\nA: Philip, believe me, it is much better spending some time to learn (and settle in) with OS X style of work than looking some Windows taskbar solution.\nAssuming that you have a new OS X notebook, you probably have multitouch trackpad too, so try the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System preferences (via the Apple icon in the menubar)\n\n*In the General set the following:\n\n\n\nLater you will set direct opposites, (automatic scroll bars, jump on the clicked spot) but for the switchers the above is good for a start.\nNext, go to Dock and set like:\n\nThe minimize-windows-into-application icon will partially simulate the Windows taskbar, so you will get:\n\nwhere you can clearly see than the \"doc\" file is minimized into the app-icon and the untitled is opened.\nThird: setup full trackpad gestures - click every checkbox on Trackpad preferences. Take some time to learn 3-finger and 4-finger gestures, especially \"swipe 4 finger up/down\" and move drag with \"3-fingers\" (instead of click & drag). This is very not-windows-like, but later will thanks to settle in with this.\n\nAfter a while you will learn to use it automatically, and will find than you don't need a Taskbar. (Because of \"Mission control\", \"Application windows\" and \"Show desktop\" swipes,)\nFour: Setup hot corners in the \"System preferences -> Mission Control\". Click \"Hot corners...\". My setup is:\n\nIn the \"Mission control\" uncheck \"Show dashboard as space\" - left-bottom corner will show to you the Dashboard when needed.\nThe hot corners will help when you don't want use \"swipes\". The bottom two corners (around the dock) are for the \"applications\" (Launch Pad & Dashboard), the upper two corners are for \"windows\" (Current app-windows and Mission control)\nThe above is my 2cents - maybe someone will suggest better setup - from my experience the above helps my \"switchers friends\" greatly.\nEDIT after 1.5 years.\nBecause of commnents I want clarify some things. At time of the question, was not here really usable software what behaves exactly as windows taskbar.\nTherefore I tried answer with a setup, what should help switchers as much is possible.\nIt is not easy to have windows-like taskbar - here are several points:\n1.) The taskbar's notification area (commonly referred as systray). In the OS X the top menubar is the place where are placed the notification icons like, date, battery and so on. Moving them to some taskbar like sw is probably not easy.\n2.) Taskbar's start-menu. With the above hot-corners setup, the \"bottom left\" corner is the \"Lanuchpad\", from where the user can launch any installed application. (Can group applications into categories and/or pages.) It is similar (only similar - not the same) as windows start menu.\n3.) Some actions, (what are in the windowsish start menu) in the OS X are in the apple menu, like: shutdown, sleep, logout.\n4.) Taskbar's quick-launch area. The whole Dock is like (again, only like - not the same) as the windows-taskbar's quick-launch area, from where you can launch frequently used applications. Similarly as in the taskbar, with the right click on the application icon you can see (and switch) to different instaces of running application or can open recently used files)\nSoo, if for someone the above sounds as \"opinion\", sorry for this, but it is not true. I tried (again, only tried) to suggest a solution (with a setup) what should help switchers. A half year later as i wrote my original answer @Krav added the iTaskbar. Feel free to use it. :)\n", "Q: Mail freezes with initial migration after upgrading to Mountain Lion I recently upgraded Mac os 10.5.6 to the new 10.8.1 (Mountain Lion).

I purchased a MacBook Air from someone 4 months ago and everything was working perfectly. There is no user name or password needed to log in and I've never had problems using it.\nNow I would like to reinstall OS X but I can't do it because it's asking for a firmware password when booting with Option ⌥ held down. It's 4 months now and I've lost the seller's phone number to ask for password.\nI've tried to reset NVRM but those keys are disabled. I can't boot from external HD when I turn on the system. What is the reset procedure?\n\nA: To reset the firmware password it looks like you have to take it in for service at your  nearest Apple Support location as noted in the following Apple Support Article MacBook Air (Late 2010) and later, MacBook Pro (Early 2011) and later, iMac (Mid 2011) and later, Mac mini (Mid 2011): Recovering a lost firmware password\n\nSymptoms\nLearn what to do if you no longer remember the firmware password that you've set or if you see a password dialog when you try to select a startup volume on a MacBook Air (Late 2010) and later, MacBook Pro (Early 2011) and later, iMac (Mid 2011) and later, or Mac mini (Mid 2011) computer.\nResolution\nOnly Apple retail stores or Apple Authorized Service Providers can unlock these computers protected by a firmware password.\nIf you cannot remember the firmware password for your Mac, schedule a service appointment with either an Apple Retail Store or an Apple Authorized Service Provider.  If you plan to visit an Apple Retail store, please make a reservation at the Genius Bar using http://www.apple.com/retail/geniusbar/ (available in some countries only).\n\nAs a side note you will need the original proof of purchase.\n\nA: The only way to reset the open firmware password is to take the Air to an Apple store or other authorised Mac reseller. \nsee: How do Apple engineers reset EFI password on new MacBooks?\n\nA: Don't reset it. If you have admin access to the computer's OS X install, just change the startup volume to an external USB with the full OS X installer on it. Mavericks is free from the App Store and you just need to download the installer, mount it or show package contents, copy the .dmg file to desktop, burn it to a USB stick in Disk Utility. It's a simple process. Then start disk.app and change to the USB, then reinstall OS X.\nAfter you reinstall, open Terminal and write a shell command to use the Unix setregproptool (it's inside the firmware password utility.app contents located in the installer image and also on the recovery partition) and remove the password by calling the remove password command. The program will ask for the previous password over and over until you get it right, without any delay. So, you can easily brute force it. Most likely its a 4-digit pin, 6-digit pin, or 4-8 character password. If it was locked from iOS, (app or online) it's 4-digits. If it was locked from a computer or non-Apple mobile device, it's a 6-digit pin, and if it was locked manually, it is a password. I believe it's 12 characters max, but don't quote me on it. Should only take a couple of days at most.\n\nA: If you are ALREADY LOGGED IN AS ADMINISTRATOR FROM WITHIN OSX (meaning, that the computer boots to OSX normally, but you get a firmware lock dialogue when trying any EFI startup hotkeys, which is usually always the case in the Airs I've unlocked for folks) you can spotlight \"Startup Disk\" or navigate to it from Settings.app and you can CHANGE THE STARTUP DISK FROM WITHIN OSX. I apologize if I was not clear or concise enough with my previous post; hopefully this clarifies the instructions.\nYou will have to trust me on this one, I've done it before many, many times.

So, technically, I have two Lion licenses.\nFrom the license contract on the App Store, I read that it (or Mountain Lion at least) is not transferable. I guess that means I can't transfer my license away from my Apple ID.\nBut I think it makes no sense I have two licenses and the person who bought my old MacBook Pro would have to buy a new (3rd) one to install it and maintain it. Is there any fairer solution? Would that be illegal?\nOf course I could just install it using my account or whatever, but I already did that and now he wants to re-install it for whatever reason, and that's basically where all problems started.\n\nA: The licenses you bought on the Mac App Store are non-transferable, as you already found out. The license for the preinstalled copy CAN be transfered, but only as part of a transfer with the original hardware it was installed on.\nTherefor the only thing you can do when selling your old computer is delivering it with the original software it came with. Anything else would be a violation of the license agreement, and can be considered as software piracy.\n", "Q: Does personal hotspot always use cellular data? If I have my iPhone connected to a wifi connection, then put it on personal hotspot, is the device I'm connecting to my iPhone with using cellular data bandwidth, or the wifi bandwidth? \nYou'd think it's a silly thing. But I'm JUST out of range of a wifi signal with my laptop, so my plan is to put my phone in a window not too far from my desk, and use it almost as an extender.\n\nA: Personal Hotspot mode detaches the device from any network and is intended to make all data flow to and from the cellular account. If you pulled the SIM card your plan just might work as a stunt to connect two laptops in the absence of another router, but it certainly won't extend an existing wireless network in the manner you describe. \n\nA: MyWi lets you share a wifi connection over wifi. But it would require jailbreaking\n\nA: It's not a silly thing.  I just noticed that someone was connected to my iphone's hotspot while it's connected to my WIFI.  I verified my iPad to see if it was the one connected to the hotspot and it wasn't.  I guess someone close by \"figured out\" my hotspot's password. ALWAYS turn off your hotspot while not in use!\n", "Q: Is Mac OS X in a VirtualBox VM suitable for iOS development? I have finally successfully managed to install Mac OS X in a virtual machine on my Windows 7 laptop using VirtualBox and a tutorial from Lifehacker.\nPerformance is very slow, with Mountain Lion reporting that it is seeing just 4MB video memory (I didn't manage to load the Intel HD3000 driver). Youtube is essentially unplayable, with even the audio potion stuttering. That said, the interface and general UI is pretty acceptable.\nEven with such slow performance, does it make sense to download and develop with Xcode? I am allocating 3GB of RAM. What would performance be like under those conditions?\n\nA: If this is a hobby and you are not planning on releasing any apps to the app store, and you can tolerate the slow performance and don't care about running on real devices, then don't worry about it. However, if you are creating a business the it is essential to run on real hardware. Any low end Mac (MacBook Air 11\", is my current favorite) will blow away any virtual machine.\nI have a fairly simple app that runs fine on my iPad and iPod Touch, but has all sorts of graphic anomalies in the simulator.\n\nA: Virtualbox on Windows is definitely not suitable for this, as Windows itself is quite resource-hungry, Virtualbox lacks many configuration options and even if you can get it to work it's going to be quite unreliable, not to mention that you can't pass through USB devices.\nWhat you can do (and I have done it with much success) is use a lightweight Linux installation as a base for QEMU which is a Virtualbox alternative, with much more configuration options, including the ability to emulate the Apple SMC and its \"OSK\" string (you won't need shady \"hackintosh\" kexts) and it has reliable USB pass through (I successfully restored iOS devices and installed apps on them).\nIn the end, with my solution I am able to successfully run Yosemite with 3,5GB of RAM (out of the 4GBs of my computer, and by tweaking the host system I could probably push it even more to 3,7GB), using the two cores of my CPU, with reliable USB pass through and no tweaking required (the emulated hardware is close enough to a real Mac that the OS boots directly without any kernel command line parameters or extra kexts). An SSD is a must have though, a hard drive will be bloody slow (that's also true for a real Mac). Graphics are still slow (and it's even worse in Yosemite) but besides the login screen which takes a good 5 seconds to render due to its transparency, everything else is pretty usable, and it's enough for occasional (hobby) iOS development until you get enough experience to make profitable apps in which case it's still better to buy a real Mac as this setup may break at any update.\nI posted a detailed guide on my blog about how to create a Yosemite VM, feel free to check it out if you're interested.\n\nA: Somewhere, VirtualBox warns you in the manual here that you will NOT have graphics acceleration. There are no accelerated drivers for Mac OS X, so you are essentially running in \"safe mode\" for graphics, using VESA drivers. Apple  had a public driver API at one point, but there's got to be some reason that VirtualBox developers haven't released a graphics driver for OS X yet.\nRead the manual page linked, it also documents other issues you will have with OS X guests. \nThe result is not virtualization, but closer to paraemulation with CPU virtualization. Your graphics system is fully emulated, mostly by Mac OS X itself due to the lack of accelerated graphics drivers.\nMac OS X virtualization in VirtualBox is not intended for serious desktop use. It is intended for server virtualization.\n\nA: Essentially, you're running 2 virtual boxes if you use the iOS emulator and take this approach. 1 for OSX and 1 (essentially) for the emulator. This can get very cpu and ram intensive but it's doable. Best bet, give it a shot. \nIf you don't like, just remove the vm image.\n", "Q: Is there an iPhone app that acts as a radio signal strength sensor? I would like to find an iPhone app that is able to show the GSM or WiFi signal strength. Does it exist?\n\nA: Apple does not provide any public APIs for interacting with any of the device radios, and would not approve any app that did so with a private API. \n", "Q: Are there leftover files when I uninstall an iPhone app? If I remove an app then will the preferences/caches/logs be deleted as wel?\n\nA: No, no files are leftover when deleting an app. iOS apps (and now  OS X  apps too), are Sandboxed. This means that each App has its own space in disk, with its own directories, which act as the home for the app and its data.\nDeleting an app from the iPhone deletes this sandbox, deleting all data associated with the app.\n\n", "Q: How to prevent calendar alerts from becoming Drafts (???) in Mail.app? I don't know the rhyme or reason to it yet, but random calendar event notifications in Lion turn into drafts in my Mail.app drafts folder. I usually find these when I wake the machine up after it's been idle for some time.\nWhy would an alert become a draft in Mail.app at all? It makes no sense.\nThe calendar items are from a shared Google calendar. The draft is marked \"no recipients\", and just has the basic info from the calendar entry. The subject is like this:\n\"Alert - Piano lesson\"\nand the body is like this:\n\"September 5, 2012 1:45 PM : Piano lesson\"\nMy wife enters those in HER gmail account calendar but I subscribe to it.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Calendar invitations are delivered via email, so perhaps Mail app is preparing things for you to \"accept, tentative, or decline\" the invitations as part of the routine processing of a mail message that gets diverted from the inbox and places in another application (Calendar in this case, or iCal for those on Lion and earlier).\nYou could also just configure Calendar to not retrieve CalDAV events from Mail in the first place and let mail handle things in the inbox rather than having the system try to process things for you.\n\nCalendar -> Preferences -> Advanced \n\nDeselect the box next to Automatically retrieve CalDAV invitations from Mail\n", "Q: How do you switch dictionaries used for the \"Tap with three fingers\" lookup?

I recently bought a caddy to replace my optical drive with so I can fit a secondary drive in the laptop.\nI have a 256 SSD in the main and a brand new 128 SSD to go in the caddy. Ideally I would like to have a Boot Camp install, but really don't want to go playing with the 256 SSD in the main drive with Mac OS X on, for more than one reason - but mainly as I do not have the space on there for the required partition.\nIs there anyway to get a Boot Camp setup where the Windows install is on its own disk?\n\nA: As always, feeling a bit silly answering my own question. But this was quite easy.\nSo I had two SSD's, one had Mac OS X installed on and was running fine. Because I was putting my second SSD in place of the super drive, but I needed the super drive to install windows-I first removed my Mac OS X SSD and put my to-be-Windows on in it's place.\nSo my machine had one blank SSD in.

However my problem still has not been solved. I have iMessage on. I am using iMessage via my Apple ID. Now where it says \"receive at:\", it shows my email, and it won't even let me remove the email. Plus it doesn't even have an option that shows my phone number. I have an iPhone 4S. I have tried opening iMessage without an Apple ID, however it says \"Verifying\" for hours and hours.\n\nA: The only tried and true manner I've found to resolve this is to force Apple's activation servers to see the phone as a new device. The push notification servers have clearly \"hung on\" to what it thinks is the correct iMessage information despite your efforts to correct this.\nTo accomplish this, you'll need to be really careful about keeping a good backup since you will have to erase your phone and set it up as new. I recommend making an iCloud backup, then making a local backup to iTunes. If you are really paranoid, back up your PC/Mac at this point and have two copies of the iTunes backup. I would turn odd iMessage and power down the phone and then make a backup once it starts with no iMessage on the phone just in case the iMessage settings could get restored after you perform this erase operation.\nNow you will need to be sure your phone receives SMS messages. Your carrier should double check that your account has SMS enabled. At this point, you may want to be sure you are not jailbroken or other thing that could get messed up if it's not stored in your normal backup procedure.\n\n\n*\n\n*From the settings app, go to General, and then Reset and finally Erase All Content and Settings\n\n*When the device gets past all the red warning messages, it will trash it's internal APNS tokens (Apple Push Notification Service) and get ready to be set up as a new device or from a backup.\n\n*Do not enter your Apple ID when the device restores. You should skip everything and not enter any data into the phone. Don't set up email, iCloud or anything else.\n\n*Do test sending a SMS and receiving a SMS.\n\n*Then go to iMessage and enable it - not with an Apple ID, but with your phone number.\n\n*At this point you can test the iMessage and ensure it works.\n\n\nOnce you have verified things are fine, you can now choose to start setting up the phone and not restore your backup. This might be the best option if you don't have lots of third party apps that have extensive data. If you do want to restore your backup, you can connect it to iTunes ensuring you don't initiate a new backup to cover the old one or use iCloud to restore your cloud backup.\nHopefully this will clear the iMessage settings and restore things to the way you hope it will work.\n\nA: Settings>Messages>send and receive. Apple ID is on the top click it then log out. Then turn you iMessages on and select your phone number. Don't log back into your Apple ID until you know it worked.

I have enable both the Web and Mail services in the Server application, and have checked the box for WebMail under the Mail service.\nHowever when I try to browse to https://localhost/webmail, https://127.0.0.1/webmail, or https://myservername/webmail I get the message \"Webmail is turned off. You can turn it on by using the Server app on the server.\"\nHow can I get webmail to work?\n\nA: According to Macgasm...\n\nThere are still the same options, excluding the option for webmail, which has been removed. With the increase in use of iOS based devices, like the iPod touch, iPhone and iPad, all of which have the built-in Mail.app client, it’s possible that the use of web-based mail clients is rapidly decreasing. For me at least, the use of the web interfaces for my myriad of mail accounts is almost entirely non-existent. I cannot remember the last time that I logged into a web-based mail client to check my email. It only seems like a natural progression of the OS to remove a little-used feature. So, it’s not too surprising that Apple has removed any web-based mail client in OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion Server, likely preferring that users access mail services either via Mail.app on their iOS device or via Mail.app on their Mac.\n\nScreenshot from Lion Server:\n\nScreenshot from Mountain Lion Server:\n\n\nA: There is no webmail anymore.  It has been removed.\n", "Q: Exclude files from \"central metadata store\" I'm fairly familiar with the mdfind utility. I find it's very useful when I can't find a file or when I need to find a file with certain contents. The problem is that I need to exclude some files from mdfind searches. I don't want to exclude the files from a single search (I know you can do this with mdfind -onlyin /path/to/directory/to/exclude) but from all searches. The mdfind man page says this:\n\nThe mdfind command consults the central metadata store and returns a list of files that match the given metadata query. \n\nSo I guess I have to exclude/delete the files from the \"central metadata store\" in order to exclude them from mdfind searches. I'm wondering how I would do this.\n\nA: The command mdfind uses the Spotlight backing store.   If you go to the Spotlight pane of System Preferences and select the Privacy tab you can exclude files or folders from being indexed.   \nIt is also possible to modify the exclusions list at the Exclusions array of /.Spotlight-V100/VolumeConfiguration.plist but this does not appear to be officially supported.   Current exclusions can be read using the command: \nsudo defaults read /.Spotlight-V100/VolumeConfiguration.plist Exclusions\n\nNew entries to the Exclusions array can be added using the command:\nsudo defaults write /.Spotlight-V100/VolumeConfiguration.plist Exclusions -array-add 'path/to/exclude'\n\nwhere /path/to/exclude is a path relative to filesystem root.\nThese entries appear in the System Preferences privacy list but do not appear to actually affect the search results even after running sudo launchctl stop com.apple.metadata.mds && sudo launchctl start com.apple.metadata.mds:\n\nA: Credit goes to @Lri:\nAn alternate way to remove files from the Spotlight index is to place them in a folder beginning with a period or add \".noindex\" to the end of a folder's name.\n", "Q: Why is parallels giving me the error \"there is no disk in the drive\"?

Once I tried to use it my iPod wouldn't connect unless I tilted it towards me, and sometimes it would would say that it wasn't supported. I just would like to know if there is anything I can do to fix this problem?\n\nA: I was going to suggest a phone restore and then wondered as to how you could do that if the phone would not turn on or charge. The last fix in the attached link below describes connecting the phone with the USB sync cable to your Mac and then entering DFU mode which you may not have tried.\n\nA: Assuming you have the correct insert for your iPod in the iHome, all the issues just sounds like a bad connection between the iPod and the dock connector on the iHome, but to what extent this is a bad connection depends on how much time you are willing to spend looking at the issue.\nIf you don't have the correct insert, find one and try again otherwise...\nThis could be one of two things in the main:\n\n\n*\n\n*There is/are faulty (intermittent) connections in the dock connector on the iHome that are re-made when pressure is applied to the connector.  This primarily can only be resolved by repairing/replacing the dock connector on the iHome\n\n*The pins on the dock connector on the iHome or tarnished or faulty in that they no longer make a full electrical connection to the pins inside the iDevice. Pressure on the iDevice remakes this connection.\n\n\nThe not supported message is usually a message shown when a single pin in the dock connector does not get a signal.

We are going to install an SSD to replace the standard HD that it shipped with, however, it looks like Apple don't ship with the OS on DVD any more. They have informed him there is a backup of the OS on another partition of the drive that his MBP shipped with.\nMy question is, bearing in mind this MBP hasn't been used yet - there is nothing to back up, we just want to install his fresh OS on the new SSD drive, what is the best way to go about this?\n\nA: Macs that shipped with Lion or newer come with a recovery feature which is part of the EFI firmware, so that if the hard drive fails, or you install a new hard drive without OS X, the computer can start recovery directly from the internet over a broadband connection. \nTo start Recovery, hold down the Command + R keys while booting. The interface is pretty straightforward after that and you should be able to figure it out.\nApple also has as support article on OS X Recovery, and one on which models can support internet recovery through a firmware update.\n\nA: In addition to internet recovery mentioned by Alain, you can also install the recovery software to an external USB drive from a running Mac OS X installation with a Recovery HD partition.\nTo do this, you can download an assistant from this support page: http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1433\n\nA: There are two recovery methods.\nThe first is a local feature located on a hidden partition on the HDD shipped with the Macbook.\n\nThe second, as mentioned by Alain King is in the firmware of the Mac and does not require the hidden partition to be present to work. It's the Internet Recovery feature and can download the OS to a new, blank drive.\nIf you're just swapping the existing HDD for an SDD, my suggestion would be to follow Gerry's advice. Install to a USB drive, replace the HDD with the new SDD, boot from the external drive with the Recovery Assistant and install to the SSD. It would be faster than the Internet Recovery.\nAnother option (to make use of the HDD) would be to install both drives in lieu of an optical drive.

I was checking my directory and found out that the Folder Backup in Library > Application Support > Mobile Sync > Backup, is taking 13GB of my Harddisk ... What is this and why is taking so much space .. Can I delete it ?\n\nA: It's the folder where iTunes saves the backUps of your iDevice. And it takes so much space because each time you sync a device, previous backUps are not deleted. \nDeleting the folder will, then, mean losing those backUps. Doing this regularly is advised for saving HD space. Just make sure to make a new backUp afterwards, and that you won't need those backUps.\nYou can do that through iTunes too, by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Opening iTunes / Preferences / Devices.\n\n*A list with all the Devices will be show. Select the one's backUps you want to delete and click Delete Backup. \n\n\nNote that all of the backUps of that iDevice will be deleted.\n\n\nA: I assume that you are referring to ~/Library/Application Support/Mobile Sync/Backup.   This is the location where backups of iOS devices created by iTunes reside.   Each sub-folder represents a different iOS device.   If you delete this folder you will be unable to restore your iOS devices to their backed up state from iTunes.   if you wish to see a list of backups stored by iTunes, open iTunes, go to the iTunes menu > preferences.   Find the Devices tab in preferences and select it and you should see a list of device backups.\n", "Q: Safari 6 refreshes when I go back I have this annoying problem with Safari 6, each time I go back or forward (both the toolbar buttons or two singer swipe) the tab refreshes. Here is a quick video to illustrate the problem: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3257155/safari-refresh.mov\nNormally I wouldn't really mind, it kinda grown on me over time (I'm not really sure this started when I updated to Safari 6 or to Mountain Lion - there was about a week between the updates), but my client found a bug in the web app I build (some buttons stop responding when he goes back - he is still on Lion) and I can't reproduce the problem because my Safari refreshed every time.\nSo my question is, what is the normal behavior for Safari? And how/if can I make Safari not refresh?\nUPDATE\nTurns out the problem was that Safari doesn't (by default) fire the onLoad even when on the \"back action\". I couldn't reproduce the bug on my machine because apparently the 1password extension causes the onLoad event even when you go back.\n\nA: Turns out the problem was that Safari doesn't (by default) fire the onLoad even when the \"back action\" is performed (using the back button or the two finger swipe) but I couldn't reproduce the bug on my machine because apparently the 1password extension causes the onLoad event even when you go back.\n\nFurther explications at Render's request:\nSo let's assume this code on all pages:\n$(document).ready(function () {\n    alert('test');\n}\n\nAnd this sequence of actions:\n\n*\n\n*open page-1.html\n\n*open page-2.html\n\n*Go back\n\n*Go forward\n\nSafari won't show the alert after step 3 and 4, so I the onLoad event is not fired and the page .js continues the execution from where it left off when you navigated away from the page.\nAlso in the current version 6.0.3, having 1password extension (3.9.14) seems to have no effect over this behavior.\nHope that helps. This shouldn't matter in most cases, it's only when you write bad code (like it did) it will bit you in the arse :)\n\nA: While visually it looks like the page is refreshing, if the original response had the appropriate cache headers, it will be served from the cache and no request is made to the server until the cache is stale.\nWhile testing this I did ran into a problem where Safari's Web Inspector does not seem to properly indicate wether a page was loaded from the cache, but while monitoring my server logs it appeared that Safari is respecting the cache headers being sent back after all.\nWhen a server sent headers which disallow caching with the response, or the cache has expired in the meanwhile, Safari just like any other browser will make a new request when revisiting a page from the history.\nAlso note that you can completely disable caching from the Develop menu (if enabled). Make sure you did not enable this option.\n\n", "Q: How can I sync multiple Google calendars in iCal? I'm using iCal on Lion to sync with my Google Calendars. I set up iCal to use Google's CalDAV server and it successfully syncs my primary calendar, but not my others. How can I get it to sync the other calendars I have as well?\n\nA: Create a new google account for each calendar. \nOr ask your favorite search engine and find the answer quite at the top of the list. For example, this one http://www.ehow.com/how_8251009_sync-multiple-google-calendars-ical.html.\nAdded 2012-09-07:\nIt seems to be even much easier. Under Settings->Account enter the credentials to access the primary calendar on google. Then select the pane \"Delegation\". There you will find your other calendars, select \"Show\" and violà, they will appear in iCal (at least under Mountain Lion).\n\n\nA: Since late 2012, you can add additional calendars to your main CalDAV account by going to https://www.google.com/calendar/syncselect. After you have done this, you can uncheck the delegate calendars in the iCal settings.\n\nA: I found the only usable way was to use BusySync which allows you to use all of the calendars associated with your Google account in a sane manner.\nNothing I tried before this gave me access to anything other than my primary calendar.\n", "Q: How can I access iCloud documents/files from an iOS device? I completed a Numbers document on my Mac, saved to iCloud and now tried to open/read it on my iPhone 4S.\nI can see it listed in Settings → Manage Storage, but how do I retrieve it?\n\nA: You can do so from the Numbers app on iOS.

If so: how do I increase the heap space available to Netbeans?\nOr is it specific to the app, as launched from Netbeans?

Is there any Mac OS software that supports properly Windows Terminal Server RemoteApp?  By Properly I mean with an experience comparable to Windows Remote Desktop, that is, the Remote App Window is resizeable, etc, as if it was just another application.\nMost tools (RDC for Mac, CoRD) seem to simply open a desktop for the application, but it does not have a truly windowed behavior.\n\nA: Not even the official Microsoft RDP Client for OS X supports this; in fact that product still cannot do Terminal Services Gateway connections that were introduced with Windows Server 2008\nBut the answer to your question is, yes there is at least one client that promotes full RemoteFX implemetation in their OS X client (and incidentally also TSG), and that's iTap Mobile RDP.  It is a commercial program however there is a trial version available from that page.  Update: it looks like iTap don't fully support RemoteApp\nThe only other client I can find is one by Thinomenon.  Their free client supports all versions of the RDP protocol up to 7 (RemoteApp requires 6.1 or greater)\nEnjoy latest RDP features, including application publishing (RemoteApp or RAIL), even if your platform is not supported by Microsoft.\n\nProduct Features:\n - RDP 4.0, 5.0, 5.1, 5.2, 6.0, 6.1 and 7 -compatible,\n - Copy and Paste via clipboard,\n - Encryption for communication security,\n - Local audio.\n\n\nA: Another RDP client for Mac is Ericom Blaze.

If anyone can explain to me what's going to happen with my calendar events I would really appreciate it.\n\nA: Time Zone support allows you to view and set events in a time zone other than the one in which you are currently located.   The time in which you are viewing events can be set in the time-zone support preference.   \nEvents created whilst time-zone support is off default to the native time-zone of the calendar which was set when it was created and turning time-zone support off lets the iPhone automatically shift the times of appointments to the local time.\nA good explanation from apple of the time-zone support can be found here and here.\nAs for the design rationale, I believe that the confusing naming originates from the development of the feature in iCal.   When the feature was built into iCal iCal displayed events in the time-zone of the computer clock which was set manually.   Enabling time-zone support permitted \"power users\" to set the iCal time-zone independently of the computer clock.  \nIf you want your events to act in the way you describe you must disable time-zone support and remember to enter the event times in the local time of the location in which you set it.   Alternatively you must enable time-zone support, change to Eastern Time, enter the time of the event and alert in Eastern time, then disable time-zone support.\nOne thing to note is that time zone support can be simultaniously enabled on your computer and disabled on your phone.   If your calendars are synced with iCal this allows you to use the computer to enter the event into the calendar and have it behave as you expect on your phone without mucking around in the settings all the time. \n", "Q: Move Large, Frequent files closer to center of HDD Is there a native/third-party utility (or native trick) to move large, frequently-used files closer to the center of the disk?\nI was under the impression that the OS tried to automatically optimize frequently used files to be closer on the center of the disk, but I don't know how \"frequent\" is \"frequent enough\" and would like to force an entire project directory to be moved closer on disk.\nThe reason: I'm using Logic Pro for several projects, but on one particular project, I keep tapping out the Disk Activity (as evidenced by \"System Overload\" messages from Logic and spikes in the Disk Activity view of Activity Monitor).\nI've seen some users of Logic and Final Cut have performance improvements after a defrag (using iDefrag), but was wondering if there were any other options other than a forced defrag.\nSuggestion: Could copying the entire project directory to an external drive, rewriting it to the local disk as a single I/O operation, and then waiting for the file system to index/optimize it help? Or would that reset the access \"frequency\" and actually hurt?\n\nSpecs of machine in question:\n\n\n*\n\n*OS X 10.7.4\n\n*500GB Serial ATA Drive @ 7200\n\n*2.66 GHz i7 MacBook Pro\n\n*8 GB 1067 MHz DDR3\n\n\nA: There’s not much difference between moving the files to the centre of the HD or towards the periphery. The centre you see in visual representations is just that, a rectangular visual representation of your circular. Physically, the file may be anywhere on the disk.\nDeleting and rewriting the file won’t help much, as the space on your disk is already fragmented. Though I have not confirmed it, OS X defragments files below 20 MB automatically. Audio and Video files tend to be large than 20 MB, and are highly fragmented.\nAssuming you are talking about defragmenting the disk, I highly recommend iDefrag. I use it every 6 months, and using the computer after the defrag is like switching from an old 56k modem to Google’s fibre optics. \n", "Q: Two External Drives on iMac Can I use the Keyboard USB Port for a second External Drive on my iMac? I've seen warnings to not use the keyboard port for external drives, but no explanation. How do I use 2 external drives, if not using keyboard port?\n\nA: Some USB drives (typically the smaller, more portable sizes that use 2.5\" hard drives) draw their power over USB (called bus-powered). Others (typically the larger 3.5\" ones) have an external power adapter.\nIf you have one with an external adapter, you should be fine plugging it in to whichever USB port you want. Bus-powered ones plugged into a USB hub (like that in your keyboard) with other devices may not have enough power to start up, or they may start up, but the connection will occasionally drop (you'll see the drive disappear from your desktop). However it's safe to at least try plugging it in to your keyboard and see if it works. If the drive doesn't show up, try directly connecting it to a port on the back of your iMac.\nIdeally you'll plug both hard drives in to the USB ports on the back of your iMac (every iMac since 2006 has at least 3, sometimes 4), which ensures maximum power and bandwidth. If you're short on ports, you can also get a standalone USB hub, which you could plug your lower-powered devices into, in order to free up ports for your drives.\n\nA: You may be able to, but it's probably not a good idea. Some keyboards with USB hubs (including older Apple keyboards) have hubs that only support USB 1.1 - any drive plugged in there will be very slow. Also, having the drive connected to a user-interface item (the keyboard) will make it easier to accidentally disconnect.\nAll iMacs I've ever used have had far more USB ports than I could possibly use. Are you sure there's not an extra unused port on the back? Can either of your drives be connected via FireWire or Thunderbolt instead of USB?\n", "Q: Installing OS X Lion on an iMac I have a new iMac where I need to install OS X Lion. The HDD is erased, but the newer iMacs don't come with bootable CDs. \nBut I do have a MacBook Pro OS X lion CD. My question is whether can I install OS X using this CD rather than downloading the whole thing? \n\nA: The OS X install disks that used to ship with new Macs were specific to those machines, and can't be used on different models. You're going to have to use Lion Recovery to re-download and install Lion, or go to an Apple Store, they can reinstall it for you if your internet connection isn't sufficient.\nIt's also likely that the install DVD for your MacBook Pro is for Snow Leopard, any machine that shipped with Lion didn't come with install media, just a recovery partition.\n", "Q: What program(s) can I use to open an .xlsx spreadsheet for editing on my Mac I can double-click the file and a browser preview opens that looks like excel.... but it is basically just a browser preview feature and it is read-only.\nThe file came from a Windows machine.\n\nA: If you have opened it in Excel but you are unable to select or change it, the sheet may be protected.   If the sheet has been protected using the Tools > Protection > Protect Sheet option then a lock symbol will appear next to the sheet name in Excel 2011.\nSheet protection can be removed by using the Tools > Protection > Unprotect Sheet command.\n\nA: This response makes a couple of assumptions:\n\n\n*\n\n*You just want to be able to open the document and do basic editing\n\n*The document is essentially local to your computer\n\n*You want a free / open source solution\n\n\nYou should be able to use Apache OpenOffice CALC to edit files in the Microsoft Excel file format of .xlsx as per the OpenOffice website:\n\nSince version 3.0, Calc has been able to read .xlsx files created with\n  Microsoft Office 2007 or Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac OS X\n\nYou may download OpenOffice from this site: http://www.openoffice.org/download/\nAlternatively, you can always use the MAC version of Microsoft Office 2011 available for purchase here: http://www.microsoft.com/mac/buy\n", "Q: Lowest volume is still too loud—how can I make it even lower?

(Shure SE 535s, in case you’re wondering.)\nThe problem in my case is that the Mac’s headphone output has a certain element of noise to it: for most head- and earphones, this simply isn’t an issue, but for mine, lowering the volume to an acceptable point means leaving me free to hear the background static that much more clearly.\nThe solution for me is hardware rather than software: a little attenuator that plugs in between the headphone jack and my earpieces. I then turn the volume on the Mac up to 12/16, and use the attenuator to lower the volume to an agreeable level. That combination gives me both fine-grained analog volume control and a conspicuous absence of static. (Shure’s model is the EA650, and sells for a pinch over $16 at the time of writing; there may be others that work just as well.)\n\nA: I just had the same problem with iTunes music being too loud on even the lowest volume setting.\nThe solution turned out to be that iTunes has a separate volume control.  Turning that down reduced the music volume enough that I could turn up the system sound volume a couple of ticks.\nThis has the added benefit that system sounds are now audible over the music.\n\nA: RobMathers already covered many ways. For terminal geeks, here is another way:\nYou can use the command line to set exact levels:\n$ osascript -e \"set Volume 0\"    # for mute\n$ osascript -e \"set Volume 7\"    # for maximum volume\n\nJust checked on my Mountain-Lion-running MacBook: the maximum is 7, not 10 as it was in Leopard. So, when you want the volume level to be 50%, use this:\n$ osascript -e \"set Volume 3.5\"    # for 50% volume\n\nand (of course) you can use\n$ osascript -e \"set Volume 0.1\"    # for a really LOW volume… ;)\n\nEDIT (june 4, 2014)\nI'm surprised with the comments, about the fractional size precison. So, here are some technical details.\n\n\n*\n\n*audio properties e.g. volume control, are (roughly) managed \"at system level\". (because this is not a programmer refenece skipping the differences between \"Audio Hardware Services\" and \"Audio Hardware Abstraction Layer\")\n\n*the system using an floating point value between 0 and 1. So, for any sound-device (e.g. internal apple speaker, or USB attached speaker) is possible define 0.000001 or 0.999999 or like. The precision is as for 32 bit floating point. (reference: https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/qa/qa1016/_index.html)\n\n*each physical device has different audio properties, whats mean volume 0.5 for internal apple speaker will produce different \"decibels\" as for example \"usb\" attached  speaker.\n\n\nFor the applescript\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple script currently converting the entered applescipt decimal value (now between 0 and 7) to system-level value between 0 and 1.\n\n*The importat thing is than the 0-7 decimal values are deprecated now, and can disappear in future OS X releases. (click here for the reference - search for set volume)\n\n*the prefered applescrip method for setting the volume now is:\n\n\n\n\nosascript -e \"set volume output volume VALUE\"\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The VALUE is an integer between 0(mute) and 100(max volume), what is converted to 100 linear system-level volume-value as: 0(mute), 0.01, 0.02 .... 0.99, 1.0 (max).\n\n*is possible to show the current volume by applescript to, e.g.:\n\n\n\n\nosascript -e \"get volume settings\"\n\nwhat prints something like:\noutput volume:10, input volume:92, alert volume:100, output muted:false\n\nSo, in the future (when the possibility to set the volume level with decimal values will be removed) will be possible only 101 exact volume levels - as integers between 0 and 100 (inclusive). Of course, this is for the applescript, programmers at system level of course can use any 32bit floating number between 0.0 and 1.0.\nIf someone want to know, the SHIFT+OPTION+VOLUME sets the next \"output volume\" (integer) levels: 0 1 3 5 6 8 9 11 13 14 15 17 19 20 22 24 25 26 28 30 31 33 34 36 37 39 40 43 44 45 47 48 50 52 53 55 56 57 60 61 63 64 65 67 68 70 71 74 76 77 79 80 82 83 85 87 88 90 91 93 95 97 98 100, what clearly shows: it using the floating point levels what are rounded to integer with applescript. (therefore mostly skips by 2 but sometimes only by 1)\n\nA: As well as the ways covered in the other answers, there is another simple way to get a volume lower than one box full or one-quarter box full.\n\n\n*\n\n*Lower the volume to one box full:\n\n\n*Lower the volume to muted by pressing Volume Down (not Mute):\n\n\n*Press Mute to un-mute:\n\nThis gives you a very quiet volume that is between mute and one box full.\nThis zero-box-full volume is even quieter than one-quarter box full, the minimum volume you can set with robmathers’s Shift-Option method. However, if sound is playing while you set the volume using this method, the sound is muted for the moment between steps 2 and 3, which can be a little annoying.\n\nA: Very late to the party, but it doesn't seem that anything much changed in these 9 years that the question was posted.\nHere's another way I discovered, that no one mentioned yet, which allows to use a very precise slider and doesn't require messing with a terminal.\n\n*\n\n*Fire up spotlight search with cmd+space\n\n*Search for and launch Audio MIDI Setup application\n\n*Choose a device on the left, e.g. \"Built-in Output\"\n\n*On the right side, find \"Master Stream\" section.\n\n*Drag the master slider to adjust the value (0.001 is the lowest that I was able to set)\n\nInterestingly, the lowest values, based on the suggestions in this thread are:\n\n*\n\n*Using just the Volume Down button: 0.063\n\n*Shift + Option + Volume Down: 0.016\n\n*osascript -e \"set Volume 0.1\": 0.014\n\n*osascript -e \"set Volume 0.003\": 0.001 (seems that setting to 0.002 and 0.001 also works, although it shows as 0 in the MIDI settings and I'm not sure that there's a difference).\n\nAt least on my machine, the 0.001 value in the MIDI app is noticeably quieter than the lowest setting of Shift + Option + Volume Down\n\nA: When you hold SHIFT+ALTwhile pressing Volume UP/DOWN, you can change the volume in 1/4 increments.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro w/ retina display connected to Dell U3011 monitor via HDMI - periodic error message about audio I have my retina MacBook Pro running a Dell U3011 monitor via the HDMI port. Periodically, the monitor shows an error message:\n\nUnsupported audio format\n  Please set the audio output on your audio player to Pulse-code modulation (PCM) if available.\n\nPeople have suggested to use some other method of connecting the monitor to the Thunderbolt ports as a solution and this would work but in my case, I want to run this monitor from the HDMI port. Anyone have any suggestions?\n\nA: Go to the Utilities folder in the Applications folder and open the Audio MIDI Setup application. Select the HDMI Audio Device connected to the Dell U3011 monitor. Configure the audio format to \"44100.0 Hz\" and \"2ch - 16bit Integer\". As far as my minimal testing shows, this should fix the issue. \n\nA: Try opening up the Sound panel in System Preferences, and making sure something other than HDMI is selected for the output. If that doesn't fix it, try changing the \"Line Out Source\" in the monitor's Audio Settings. See the details in the manual here.\nIf possible, you may want to try using Displayport for this monitor, as you're limited to 1920×1200 connecting it via HDMI.

The default configuration in /var/pgsql/postgresql.conf says that listen_addresses defaults to localhost, but it doesn't let me connect over port 5432.  Connecting (as root, using sudo) over a Unix domain socket works fine, but I need to enable network connections.\nI tried uncommenting the listen_addresses = 'localhost' line (to make it explicit), and restarting the Postgres process (with sudo serveradmin stop postgres, sudo serveradmin start postgres), but that didn't help.\n\nA: The Postgres process started by \"serveradmin\" has command-line arguments added by /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.postgresql.postgres.plist.  The default includes -c listen_addresses=, which turns off TCP/IP.\nChanging it to listen_addresses=localhost, and restarting Postgres, solved the problem.  (I suppose I could probably also remove the -c argument entirely.)\n(One comment I found somewhere suggested that in 10.8 Server, the file you need to edit is /Library/Server/PostgreSQL/Config/org.postgresql.postgres.plist, but I haven't upgraded to 10.8 yet so I can't confirm this.)\n", "Q: Colorful make compilation output When I used Ubuntu, I remember that the output of make/gcc/g++ had nice colors, which were particularly helpful when needing to quickly identify errors (they were red).\nIs there a way to enable colors for make et. al. on OS X as well?\n\nA: make on OS X does not appear to support color out-of-the-box, and recompiling is painful.\nHowever, I found this make wrapper which does the job.\n", "Q: AirPlay via AppleTV stutters on retina MacBook Pro but not iPhone 4 I recently got a retina Macbook Pro and I am loving it except for one thing. When I go to System Preferences > Sound > Output and select AirPlay while playing audio, the sound will often just stop or stutter for a period of time from less than a second to 6 or 7 seconds. The music is not just pausing because I can see on iTunes, Spotify, or YouTube that the audio continues to play. Yet on my iPhone 4 when using AirPlay, it never stutters or pauses.\nWhat gives?\nI tried switching the wireless channel on my router without luck.\n\nA: I saw the chatter over on the official Apple forums last week and there has been some success on Retina MBP owners with the workaround here (and listed below)\nGo to System Preferences -> Energy Saver -> Uncheck 'Automatic Graphics Switching'\nThis will of course switch 100% to the Nvidia chipset which will be a larger battery drain.\nThe issue, according to those users, is that the integrated graphics on the Retina MBP is the root cause and more than likely to be as a result of immature drivers from Intel since they also report that there is no issue under Bootcamp.\n", "Q: PostgreSQL on Mountain Lion Server Autostart PostgreSQL now comes with Server on 10.8+.

I can also remove the NTFS drive of interest from this exclude list - thereby including it into the backup list.\nThe problem is that the settings aren't sticky. When I reenter the Time Machine preferences, the external NTFS drive is again seen on the exclude list. And the actual files themselves aren't backed up either.\nSo, how can I backup the data on my external NTFS drive via Time Machine?\n\nA: The only way you could would be to hack the OS to recognize and handle the NTFS filesystem. If the content of the files were small, you could automate copying them using rsync or another tool to an HFS + extended volume (boot or otherwise), but this just isn't something Time Machine has the code to handle.\n", "Q: How to use machine name of iOS devices on network?

Is there a way to go back to the default one?\nThe grey one\n\nThe default one\n\n\nA: Nope, you can’t. When FileVault is enabled, the disk needs to be decrypted on every boot. As the computer can’t access files on the disk, It generates a simple login screen so that you can enter your password and decrypt the disk. This UI is hardcoded into the firmware of your computer, and can’t be changed.\nSource: https://discussions.apple.com/message/15823532#15823532\n\nWhen your Mac first starts up, EFI-boot takes over to decide what to do. It either\n\n*\n\n*continues to bring up the system to the typical OSX login screen, which is managed by OSX's system preferences, or\n\n\n*it starts a special EFI pre-boot where it displays the FV2 unlock screen with the icons of designated OSX accounts approved to unlock the disk. Once you log on, the EFI unlock sequence carries forth your credentials, performing a single signon.\n\n\nA: I'm afraid it's not common knowledge how to change this (yet). This is the default behaviour when enabling FileVault, and this login background cannot be altered using a standard control that Apple built.\n\nA: That's worked great for me:\n\nOS X 10.8.2 included one important change to Apple’s fdesetup FileVault 2 management tool. fdesetup now has the authrestart verb, which allows a FileVault 2-encrypted Mac to restart and bypass the FileVault 2 pre-boot login screen. Instead, the Mac reboots as a unlocked system and goes straight to the regular login window.\nWhen you run sudo fdesetup authrestart, it asks for a password or recovery key. The password must be an account that has been enabled for FileVault 2 (i.e. an account that shows up at the FV2 pre-boot login screen.) After that, it puts an unlock key in system memory and reboots. On reboot, the reboot process automatically clears the unlock key from memory.\n\nSource\n\nA: You can customise your login screen as shown in this post.\n", "Q: What programs exist to find and delete \"orphan files\" left after deleting an Application?

I just migrated from Wndows and imported all my pictures from my external hard drive into iPhoto. I have around 100GB of photos. I wanted to see if this is going to scale or if there is a way I should organize this (multiple libraries) to deal with the large amount of pics and videos? I basically have a few questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*How well does iPhoto scale with large libraries?\n\n*What is the recommended action to take when an iPhoto library is getting very large: split the library, upgrade to a different app, etc.?\n\n\nA: The weight of data (in gigs) doesn't really matter with iPhoto. That's just file storage. If you have a large HD with plenty of free space (30%+ and never less than 10%), it really doesn't matter.\niPhoto used to be rated for 250,000 items in the library, but in the most recent update it has the same format as Aperture, and that is effectively unlimited. \nAs to how well iPhoto scales: pretty well. I have a 40k plus library that opens in a couple of seconds. I've worked on Libraries in excess of 100k items and while longer to launch (one was almost a minute) it worked fine once open.\nYou can easily have multiple libraries:\nHold down Option while launching iPhoto, and from the resulting menu select Create Library. Bear in mind that only one can be opened/ searched/ accessed at a time. Again, unless you're getting very large indeed, I would avoid them.\nUpgrading to Aperture is simple. Install it. Open the Library. Done.\n\nA: Depending on how new/fast/powerful your Mac is, you may find it better to split libraries. At home I use iPhoto on a 4 year old Mac Mini (with 3GB of RAM) to store my photos. My library was 50GB, and was terribly slow to open or do anything. \nI split the library (into 1 library per year) using iPhoto Library Manager, USD20, and it really speeded things up. \n", "Q: How can I add a custom context menu item on a text selection in the Terminal?

I work for a software company that is just starting to develop for the iPhone and we have a few clients that each want their own app developing and adding to the Market to sell.\nMy question... is it possible to create 'sub accounts' for each client so that they have access to information for their app and payments will go straight to them?\n\nA: We set up separate iTunes Connect accounts for the clients so that the client gets all of the info they need and also the money from Apple where applicable.\nYou would also need to set up Apple developer Accounts for each client (You get them to pay for their developer accounts) They can then add you to that dev account and you will be able to manage the provisioning, certificates and other things on their behalf but using your developer access account.\nApple documents this thoroughly here:\n\n\n*\n\n*iTunes Connect Developer Guide\n", "Q: In Keynote, is there any way to assign shortcut keys to select specific fonts? I'm writing a series of lectures where I use a different font to indicate code.  Is there any way to assign new shortcut keys/key combinations to select the two fonts I want?\n\nA: Not by default, but according to Apple's Keynote shortcut page you can use:\n\nCopy paragraph style   Option-Command-C\nPaste paragraph style  Option-Command-V\n\nBetter than nothing, I hope.\n\nA: I didn't find any way to modify the style of the selection, but you could use UI scripting to select a font from the format bar.\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"Keynote\"\n    tell pop up button 1 of window 1\n        click\n        click menu item \"Menlo\" of menu 1\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nYou could assign shortcuts to the scripts with FastScripts or by creating Automator services.\n\nA: I don't know any easy-simple way, but (as usual) Automator and scripting can provide some help.\nThe basic idea is:\n\n\n*\n\n*You write the text with the Keynote's default font.\n\n*Select the text.\n\n*Press a hotkey - this will run the Automator script and replace the font for the selected text.\n\n\nso, to make this work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start Automator.\n\n*Select the type \"Service\".\n\n*At the top change \"text\" to \"rich text\" and set the checkbox \"Output replaces…\".\n\n*From the Library in the left side drag into the right side the following actions.

It should be in the \"Text\" group.\n\n*Select the checkbox and add a shortcut. (see screenshot)\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*And you're done!\n\n\nA bit complicated to set up, but it works and when you have lots of text, it can speed up the formatting a bit.\n(Somebody will likely suggest much simpler solution using AppleScript directly with Keynote.)\nWhen you've finished the work and don't need the service anymore, you can remove the \"SetMyFont.workflow\" from the ~/Library/Services, or uncheck that checkbox in the Keyboard preference pane.\n", "Q: Install OS X Lion on a Mac mini I borrowed a Core 2 Duo Mac mini.

My sister dropped her iPhone into water and made the fatal mistake of turning it on just a few hours later, thinking it was already dry. I put it into a bag with rice for days. She had taken a lot pictures within the last few weeks but neither connected it to her PC nor is she using iCloud/Photostream, so we wanted to save the pictures somehow.\nThe problem is, the phone only turned on when connected to a power socket - and only in the inital setup mode (\"connect to itunes\"). And even then it would restart after about half a minute.\nAssuming the battery got fried, I ordered a new one from iFixit (the phone's out of warranty since a long time) and replaced it; of course I also cleaned the logic board in the process. Though I couldn't see any corrosion despite the water indicators being pink. The only difference now is that when connected to a PC, the Apple logo appears, but the phone reboots infinitely after several seconds. \niTunes recognized it when entering DFU mode, but shows no additional data besides \"iPhone\" (capacity, iOS version, serial number).\nGetting the phone to work again is secondary, we just want to save the pictures. Is there any way to get my data including all the pictures from iPhone?\n\nA: Yes - programs like PhoneView can often read files from a device that iTunes insists must be restored. The iTunes function is to sync and clearly the OS is now in a state where it can't run itself or be updated, so the \"correct\" thing for iTunes is to ask for a restore.\nI wouldn't say that you are guaranteed to get the photos back, but it's good you have the computer where the device normally syncs as that will have the encryption keys to unlock the storage if the device has data protection enabled.\nYou could also seek a quote from the usual data recovery services like:\n- http://www.drivesaversdatarecovery.com\n- http://www.krollontrack.com\nYou should expect to spend hundreds of dollars if you send the device in for recovery and you may have to pay if they recover anything - even one partial file - so be sure you understand what is being quoted before agreeing to a recovery attempt.\n\nA: Do you have a backup of the phone on your computer? If there's no backup, the photos are not in iCloud nor synced with another device/computer, & the photos have been deleted from your phone, you would appear to be out of options. \n\nA: I can't be sure if this will be any better than the methods you've tried, but you could see if something like 'Phone Disk' (see https://www.macroplant.com/phonedisk/) would work for you. Unfortunately this one seems to have been discontinued now, but the company has a more recent product that apparently does the same thing. Basically it mounts your iPhone as a disk, so you can see what's on it.\n\nA: If you are a windows 8 user and you have already authorised your computer, then definitely you can see the images on phone by Photos app in windows 8. \n\n\n*\n\n*It syncs all the images\n\n*You can also try logging to iCloud.com and try your luck there.\n\n*You can try making a new backup via iTunes to your phone and check whether you got your photos or not.\n\n\nA: Theoretically, it is possible. You would probably have to reach out to a professional recovery company to see if recovery is even achievable at this point. There are a few companies you could try reaching out to which offer such services for further information. Note that such services, if able to recover the data, can cost hundreds of dollars so it will be up to you to determine whether the data warrants an attempt.\nhttp://www.drivesaversdatarecovery.com/devices-supported/apple-iphone-data-recovery/\nhttp://flashfixers.com/iphone-data-recovery/\n", "Q: Can I change compression settings on built-in archive utility? I have a bunch of files I want to compress to stick in my dropbox account (as a single archive file.) When I select all the files in Finder and right click, I get the choice to \"compress\", which does create an archive.zip file. But the file isn't any smaller than all of the individual files put together.\nIs there any way to change the compression settings on the archive utility?\n\nA: If you launch Archive Utility directly from /System/Library/CoreServices/, you can create gzip-compressed .cpgz archives, which can have a higher compression rate than zip compression. However if you're compressing already compressed files (like most music and video files), you likely won't get much space savings, if any.\nIf you want to try however, open up Archive Utility, open the preferences, then change the Use archive format: setting to compressed archive, and create a new archive from the file menu (⌘K). This setting only affects archives created when you open the Archive Utility app. Ones created with the Compress option in the Finder's context menu will still be zip archives.\n", "Q: Are there non-English books in the iBookstore? All I'm seeing in the iBookstore are titles in English.\nAre there any non-English (specifically Russian) public-domain books in the iBookstore?\n\nA: I did searches for Tolstoy, Pushkin, and Dostoyevski and found at least one Russian language book under each one.

I don't know about 10.6, but /Library/WebServer/Documents/ is owned by root and has 751 permissions on 10.8 as well.\nI don't have any postrgesql folder by default on 10.8, but 10.7 might have had one.\nFiles are normally meant to put be to ~/Sites/ and accessed from http://localhost/~username/. The URLs can be made shorter by adding virtual hosts.\nYou could change the owner back to yourself with sudo chown -R $USER /Library/WebServer/Documents/.\n", "Q: How can I get all of my Gmail contacts into my Mac Contacts? I was able to import all of my Gmail contacts into my iPhone but my Mac doesn't include them.  How can I get all of my Gmail contacts into my Mac contacts app?\n\nA: On Lion/Mountain Lion, go to the Preferences on your Contact app, choose Accounts and then On My Mac, and there should be a checkbox Synchronize with Google, you will just need to provide your Gmail credentials.\nJust as a precaution, make a backup of your contacts first. Just need to go to Gmail, select Contacts, then the More button, Export to download all your contacts to your hard drive.\n\nA: There is an easier way to do this. Pull up your contacts in Gmail, select the \"more\" botton, click the export contacts option, it will give you the option to export them as vCards. Export as vCards to the desktop. Pull up mac contacts, click import and select the file you dropped on the desktop. You are done. \n", "Q: Custom mail check interval in Mail App on OS X? I've already disabled \"IDLE Command\" so it won't push emails as soon as they arrive in my IMAP (Google Apps).

Therefore being able to cntrl+cmd+\"+\" and cntrl+cmd+- to write super- and subscript is a productivity boon. However, to return to the regular font baseline I need to use the mouse and menubar. Is there a keyboard shortcut that lets me return to using the regular font baseline?\nPs. You can copy some regular text before entering sub/superscript mode and then paste it afterwards to return to regular baseline, however that is a slight hassle.\n\nA: Pressing ⌃⌘+ or ⌃⌘- again seems to remove superscript or subscript in Keynote '09.\nOther applications like TextEdit raise or lower the text multiple times though.\nYou could give custom shortcuts to nested menu items on 10.7, but it stopped working on 10.8.\n\nAnother option would be to create ~/Library/KeyBindings/ and save a property list like this as DefaultKeyBinding.dict, but it doesn't seem to work in iWork applications.\n{\n    \"^@=\" = unscript:;\n}\n\nYou could also assing a shortcut to a script like this:\ntry\n    tell application \"System Events\" to tell (process 1 where it is frontmost)\n        click menu item \"Use Default\" of menu 1 of menu item \"Baseline\" of menu 1 of menu item \"Font\" of menu \"Format\" of menu bar 1\n    end tell\nend try\n\n", "Q: What is the best way to export iphoto library to a certain folder structure? I have done a lot of processing to my iphoto library (organizing events, etc) and I want to export my iphoto library to a external hard drive but I want others to see the files so i don't want to just store the iphoto library package.\nIs there any ability to export in certain patterns like\nPhotos / [Year] / [EventName] /\n\nor something similar to this?\n\nA: Yes. Couple of possibilities\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have the latest version of iPhoto 11 there's a limited option in the Export dialogue. (File -> Export. Note the 'Subfolder Format' option in the Export dialogue. Remember you actually have to have an Event selected for the option to appear)\n\n*For earlier versions, or more granularity, Apps like iPhoto2Disk or PhoShare will help you export to a Folder tree matching your Events.\n\nA: I've actually had this very same issue, and I didn't want to pay for any solutions - so I created a quick free Applescript that does the work for you.\nOpen the App, point it to your iPhoto Library, tell it where to save the photos, and go get a cup of coffee.

What does this mean, and how can I correct the issue?\n\nA: Google generally does not track \"computers\" sending automated queries; it track automated queries by the IP address from which they originate. If you are using a VPN to connect to an external internet site, your traffic will appear to the site as if it originates from the outward connection point owned by your VPN. If another user of the VPN were to generate automated queries that were passed along by the VPN, their traffic would also appear to come from the same outward connection point, and thus have the same IP address as you.\nI would suggest you take the issue up with your VPN provider; you are paying for the use of an IP address from them, but the behavior of other customers on the network has caused the reputation of that address to be tainted.\n\nA: Report it to Google and they will investigate it: http://support.google.com/websearch/bin/request.py?&contact_type=ban\n", "Q: Minimal Apple TV Setup For an exhibition I need a minimal Apple TV setup that enables me to connect an iPad to an Apple TV via Air Play. \n→ Ideally I don't want to bring an extra router or computer. Is it possible to connect the iPad to the Apple TV directly without having both joined to a wifi network? \nIf this is not the case, what would be an easy to setup solution for this? (Is it e.g. a separate Airport Express to create the network?)\n\nA: I just called Apple to make sure. The answer is unfortunately as expected: \n\n\n*\n\n*No, Apple TV and iPad cannot connect directly without being part of the same network. \n\n*And yes, the best way to create this kind of network would be an Airport Express.\n\n\nWell.\n", "Q: How to map touchpad to screen? Touchpad shape is more or less like to the screen shape. Isn't there a way to map each position on touchpad to the position of mouse on the screen, so you simply tap at any point on the touchpad and got the mouse in the correspondent position on the screen?\n\nA: VoiceOver's Trackpad Commander does this, although I doubt you can use it without having VoiceOver on. Here is Apple's tutorial on Trackpad Commander.\n\nA: Though there's most likely a programmatic solution to this, there's no baked-in functionality in the system. Though the trackpad does have the same general ratio of the display, it's not an exact 1-to-1 relationship. To test this, drag your finger from one side of the trackpad to the other.\nDepending on tracking speed as well as how quickly you dragged your finger, your cursor may or may not make the full trip from one side of the screen to the next.\n", "Q: Sound on OS X doesn't work after Soundflower install Because of missing native equalizer on OS-X (Snow Leopard) I had to use third party app Soundflower in combination with AU Lab. Everything was going right, but once I restarted OS X, the sound stopped working. When I changed the volume by the keys on Macbook I hear the system sound, but in iTunes, Vimeo, some videos on YouTube, Quicktime, etc., I hear nothing.\nI tried to remove Soundflower and AU Lab and reboot, but without any change.\nDoes anybody know how to fix this problem?\n\nA: If you follow this guide, you should be OK. You mentioned in the comments that you've already run the uninstall script, so perhaps you will be able to follow the guide to success. Before doing that, I would check the following:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Find the 'Audio MIDI Setup' utility (Applications / Audio MIDI Setup), and check all the master volume levels on your output devices.\n\n*If you are still passing audio through anything other than regular system audio, check all the levels and knobs and such to make sure that nothing else is turned down to 0.\n\n\nNB: A common problem people have with Soundflower is the master volume being set to 0 by default.\nIf none of that is the issue, and you follow the guide, you could try my setup, which is like this:\n• Go find AU Lab 2.3, and \n• Update your Soundflower to 1.6.7 with this fix, available on Github. It has worked for me on Mavericks 10.9.4, it prevents an obnoxious clicking sound as well, and it gives you master faders for Soundflower outputs in the Soundflowerbed dropdown. \nNB: If you are not on Mavericks you may not need the updated versions of everything.\n\nA: The only way I've found to fix this is to add new user accout and use it instead of the old one.\n", "Q: How to transfer numbers docs from lion on 2006 iMac to mountain lion on another computer (MBA) My iMac has OSX lion and cannot be upgraded further. How can I transfer iWork documents to my new MBA using mountain lion?\n\nA: Wouldn't this be the same as sharing any other document?\nIn Numbers, hold down the command (⌘) key and click the proxy icon in the title bar. Clicking the name of the folder that appears in the list immediately under the file name will reveal your document in the Finder.\nThen, using the Finder, you could transfer the document using File Sharing, a USB drive, as an attachment to an e-mail.\n\nA: If both Macs are on the same network, you can use either AirDrop (which I personally dislike due to its interface and quirks) or Messages - enable the Bonjour account on both, then you can drag and drop files back and forth.\nYou can also enable File Sharing in the Sharing section of System Preferences, which is a bit more complicated but offers much more flexibility.\n", "Q: How to set read-only dmg background picture in Mountain Lion? Until MacOS 10.7, I used to put a png file in a read/write dmg, then I set it as its background picture, then I hided it and converted the dmg to a read-only one. Everything just worked.\nNow, in MacOS 10.8, if I do the exact same thing, when I open the read-only dmg it opens the read/write one too. It looks like it \"knows\" the original background picture is on the read/write dmg. Even if the read-only one has the same image in its contents.\nHow can this be prevented?\n\nA: You're right. The original disk image is opened when opening a newly converted read-only image.  However, I found that if you delete the original read-write disk image, Finder (actually, DiskImageMounter) has no problem mounting the read-only image without its original.  DiskImageMounter itself is not really responsible for the behavior you are talking about; if you look at your read-only image's .DS_Store file in TextEdit, you'll see (amidst very obscure symbols) your original image's name and file path in many places.  This is just built-in behavior of Mountain Lion, I suppose.  Unfortunately, there are no workarounds except for deleting the original image (and emptying the Trash) because Disk Utility is ultimately responsible for the creation of the DS_Store file, and the image created is read-only.  \n\nA: So, I FINALLY figured it out...\nInstead of deleting the rw disk image, it is enough to rename it.\n", "Q: Is Mac OS X's Compress a \"standard\" zip? When I submit my research papers to an online review system, I prefer to upload all files (manuscript, figures, etc) by a single zip file, so that the review system can unzip the file. Otherwise, I have to upload many files one by one; time-consuming.\nHowever, if I create a zip file using the Mac OS X's native Compress functionality, the review system tells it may be a corrupt file. Every time I try, it does same.\nInstead if I use zip command in Terminal to create a zip file, it is fine.\nWhat kind of zip technology does Compress use? Anything non-standard? Do you see any potential reasons for the fails?\n\nA: As its man page states,\n\nThe compress utility reduces the size of files using adaptive Lempel-Ziv coding.\n\nIn contrast, the zip command (also present in Mac OS X, at least in Mountain Lion) uses a different algorithm. If a publisher is expecting a zip-compressed file, a file compressed with compress is something different, and will not work for this.\n", "Q: cpio's file on disk is not older; skipping — how to suppress this warning? I create shadow copies of a directory containing 50K+ images (I don't remove them from the card until they're in three other places). Every time I add images to the master, I update the shadow copies using cpio (find . | cpio -pdmv destination).\nOn Leopard, the above command gives me a list of all the (new) images being added to the shadow copies while silently ignoring the images that haven't changed.\nAfter upgrate to ML, cpio now insists on advising me about every file that it didn't copy, i.e. cpio: ./some-file: File on disk is not older; skipping. In my case I get fifty thousand of these spurious (and obvious) messages, drowning out the files I'm interested in seeing. Removing the -v doesn't help and neither does --quiet.\nI could redirect stderr; however, I do want to know if any real errors occurred like destination full.\n\nA: One workaround of course is to filter the output of cpio using grep; however, this is a chunk of extra typing. What I really want is the Leopard behavior.\ncd master-directory\n(\n    find . | cpio -pdmv /first/shadow/destination\n    find . | cpio -pdmv /second/shadow/destination\n) 2>&1 | grep -v -e'skipping' -e'^[:space:]*$'\n\n", "Q: Connecting Dell U3011 to retina MacBook Pro via mini DisplayPort I am trying to hook up my Dell u3011 to my retina MacBook Pro using a mini DisplayPort to DisplayPort connector, and finding myself a bit perplexed as to why it doesn't work. Basically the top resolution that Mac OS X allows on the external display is either 1080p or 1280x1024(scaled!), while monitor's native resolution is 2560x1600. I Googled around and people recommend using SwitchResX tool, to fix the issue, but I am curious if there is a way to force the correct resolution with native tools(cli or some obscure settings?).\nNote: I am using OS X Mountain Lion. The miniDisplayPort to DisplayPort connector is from Monoprice.\n\nA: Try resetting the PRAM and see if it detects the proper screen resolutions. If that still doesn't work, you could try cscreen (a command line tool to set a resolution) or SwitchResX.\n\nA: I found this blogger's page that says your cable connection works for at least one person. I would be looking at your U3011's firmware version and seeing if it is the latest, also keeping an eye out for any Apple updates for your machine. A Genius Bar appointment might help but without the monitor next to you it may not be fruitful. Can you try another retina MacBook Pro to see if it is just an issue with your machine?\nIf all else fails an active adapter like the Apple Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI Adapter would probably solve the problem - unfortunately this costs money but maybe less than it would cost you to change to a different monitor. These were absolute rubbish in the early days and caused me to return a Mac mini since it couldn't drive my Samsung 305T 30\" monitor. But after seeing  this knowledge base article about firmware 1.03 I got it swapped for the later version and it has been solid ever since.\n\nA: Did you try holding down the option key while clicking \"Scaled\" in the resolution control panel?\nApple Knowledgebase article\n", "Q: USB Optical Mouse not working with Mac Mini I have a Mac Mini. I also have a cheap optical mouse.\nThe two do not seem to be able to co-exist.\nI've tested the mouse on a Windows PC. I've tested the USB ports of the Mac with the keyboard and another, similar mouse (but one which is rather terrible ergonomically).\nCan anyone suggest things I could try to reolve this?\nI've turned the Mac on and off several times but it's done nothing. Occasionally a mouse pointer will appear for a couple of seconds under the Apple logo in the top left of the screen, but it won't move and clicking has no effect.\n\nA: Best way to see if they recognize each other:  Go to System Information.  You can do this a couple ways, but the quickest is to hold Option and click on the Apple icon at the top right. You will see \"System Information\" where \"About This Mac\" used to be. \nOn the System Information screen, along the left you will see these categories: Hardware, Network, and Software.  At the bottom of the Hardware portion, you will see the USB section.  Click here, and you will see your mouse if it is recognized by the computer.  It will be listed under one of the USB Hi-Speed Bus's.  \nYou've already taken the other troubleshooting steps, so I'm guessing that it won't be there.  If that's the case, then the mouse doesn't work with your Mac, unfortunately.  I have only seen this on one other mouse, and it was a cheap Logitech.\nI hope this at least confirms something for you, even though it may not be the news you wanted.  Might have to get a new cheap mouse, but at least they aren't too terribly expensive these days.\n\nA: Yes, you are right, a cheap / older usb optical mouse that works fine on a PC will probably not work on a Mac Mini.\nI've seen this with 3 mice on two different Mac Minis.\nYou could maybe figure out why if you have plenty of time.\nBut life is short and mice are cheap so get a new one on Ebay for under a fiver and it will no doubt work that's what I did.\n\nA: Use a different port! If not check the settings of the mouse in the Mac. Also this is a wireless mouse or wired mouse? Try bootin into Mac w/o mouse and once it's fully up after login connect and try again or plug it in before starting. \n", "Q: Sharing users between Mountain Lion and Snow Leopard -- will this break user preferences? I have ML and SL installed as dual boot OSes and want to share a user's home directory (on an external drive).  I wonder, however, if I rather should use different users for each OS as ML might write content to the user preferences which SL might confuse.\n\nA: I strongly suspect that sharing a single home directory across different OS Xs will cause you problems. For example, after upgrading from Lion to Mountain Lion both Calendar.app and Mail.app had to upgrade my local data (i.e. calendars and mail boxes respectively). My hunch would be that the upgraded data would no longer be accessible from the older OSs. \n\nA: I tried this before reading this question. Specifically, I have two drives, SSDs sitting on PCI cards, each running its own OS. \nI had set up iTunes music collection to be on a standard drive, but to open when running either OS.

If they're both using the same Apple ID for iMessage, they may have trouble sending to each other. Changing the iMessage Apple ID will not mess up anything else (like the Store, iCloud, etc).\nTo check it, go to Settings > Messages > Send & Receive\nA button at the top of that screen will show you which Apple ID is being used for iMessage. If they're the same on both phones, you'll need to sign out on the one you wish to change. To do this, tap the \"Apple ID: \" button and then choose Sign Out.\n\nThen you'll be able to sign in to iMessage with a different Apple ID, existing or new. I hope this helps!\n\nA: Sometimes this occurs because the device might not contain iMessage, eg. iPhone 3GS \n", "Q: Git stopped working after installing both Github osx client and RailsInstaller Perhaps it was due to some conflict but now when typing git I get a blank line, it doesn't say command not found, just goes to the next line\nIf I press return, it exits, and does nothing\nHow do I reinstall / remove everything and start from scratch? \nI'm a new mac user, so please don't assume I know anything obvious \n\nA: I didn't find a way to uninstall the git version that railsinstaller (allegedly) installed\n(I could have just removed any file that starts with git in /usr/bin but it doesn't seem right)\nWhat I did was just change the system path, which I thought should be trivial\nwell, apparently there are quite a few places, here are a few from that answer (not in order)\n/etc/profile\n~/.bash_profile\n~/.bash_login\n~/.profile   \n~/.MacOSX/environment.plist\n/etc/paths\n/etc/paths.d/\n\nEventually, what helped was to change /etc/paths (had to learn a bit vim to do so)\nI moved /usr/local/git/bin to be the first entry, above /usr/bin and that was about it\n", "Q: Create a zip file using an Automator Service I am trying to create a service in Automator in Mac OS X Mountain Lion.

I have two Mac book Pros (10.7) at home, and no current back up plan at all. Since I expect the older one to start having problems shortly, I decided I should get my act together and set something up. \nI would like to use Time Machine, as I have heard that it works really well. I do not want to have to hook up an external drive to my laptops on a regular basis to perform backups (more than likely it just would not happen). I want to have it fully automated, kind of a set it and forget it. I currently have a Ubuntu Server running with plenty of space that I could use to backup to, but Time Machine does not seem to allow this. \nCan I use Time Machine to backup to a Ubuntu File Server? I figure once I have that setup I can find an online back up solution to back up that box.\n\nA: This answer explains things for a Windows-based server, but it should work fine for Ubuntu.\n\n\n*\n\n*In Terminal, type the following command:\ndefaults write com.apple.systempreferences TMShowUnsupportedNetworkVolumes 1\n\n*Now, as long as you have a connection to your computer’s shared drive, you should be able to see it in Time Machine.\n\n*To connect to that shared drive: Finder > Go > Connect to Server.\n\n*Type in the IP address or host name of the server. You may be prompted to log in.\n\n*Configure Time Machine to use the drive, and try creating a backup.\n\n*Time Machine will try to create a “sparse bundle” on the drive, and will fail. \n\n*Open Console and check system.log. You will see the name of the file Time Machine was trying to create. The name of the file will be something like .MacBook Pro_00254bd7abe8.sparsebundle\n\n*You will need to create a sparse bundle with this name and put it on the hard drive manually before the backups will work. To do this, open Disk Utility.\n\n*Click New Image > Set image format as “sparse bundle disk image” > Set partition map to “no partition map” > Set the size as the maximum size you are willing to allot to Time Machine. Don’t modify anything else.\n\n*Though the file on the hard drive will need to begin with a period, you will not be able to do this right away through Disk Utility, so just call it whatever you want right now.\n\n*You can rename the file so that it has a period before its name from Terminal on OS X or Ubuntu. Your final name should be like .MacBook Pro_00254bd7abe8.sparsebundle.\n\n*If everything is done right, you should now be able to use Time Machine with an Ubuntu Server.\nNote: This answer was copied from MacRumors and has been formatted for AskDifferent.

(PC seeing external hard drive from the Mac over the Internet.)\nMy external is formatted exFAT. Neither the Mac nor the PC have issues using it. When I connect it to the PC, the Mac can read/write on the external HDD over the Internet. However, when I connect it to the Mac, the PC can identify it (through Network) but the access is denied. The message is\n\n\\192.168.xx.xx\\HDD is not accessible. You might not have permission to use this network resource. The parameter is incorrect.\n\nAt the first time to try, it asked me to log in to the Mac, which worked, and has never shown up again. I can see the hard drive in question in the folder as \"share\", but double-clicking does not let me in, instead I get the above error message. One weird thing is the Property window for the hard drive (gotten from the right-click menu on the PC) shows it is NTFS, which is wrong.\nI've also tried mapping the drive to a drive letter. I tried to map it from the PC by assigning Z: drive with \\192.168.xx.xx\\HDD, then Z: drive is shown as a network drive with right capacity size (XXX GB free of 931 GB). But again, when I click it, it fails to get in. \"Z:\\ is not accessible, The parameter is incorrect.\"\nI have no problem accessing the Mac's user directory from the PC, so I also tried to map the drive to a folder in the user directory of the Mac (\\Users\\myuserID\\) by running ln -s \\Volumes\\HDD HDD on the command line, but this trick doesn't work for me.\nI don't think Sharepoint is necessary, since my Mac is on Mountain Lion. The PC is running Windows 7.\nSo, now, I don't know what to do. Any suggestion?\n\nA: You may get better help on the Windows side of this problem from Super User.\nAs for the Mac side, mounting the drive in a folder in your user directory should work and is a good idea. However, you used the wrong command. ln -s makes a symbolic link, like a Shortcut on Windows or an Alias on the Mac. You can mount the drive temporarily using the diskutil mount command. There is a way to do it permanently, but I don't know how to do it offhand; you should ask a new question about that.\n", "Q: Run Xcode 4.3 on Mac OS X Lion Recently, my friend gave me a pendrive which consists Mac OS X Lion installer, but she forget where she downloaded this installer last time.\nHow do I know whether this installer is genuine i.e. officially downloaded from Apple App Store?\nIf this is not a genuine installer, can I still use it to run and install Xcode 4.3?\nCan I still use Xcode to submit app if my Mac OS platform is not officially downloaded from Apple App Store? Does it have any problems or limitations?\n\nA: The answer to this question is the answer every single time this situation arises. Do not, under any circumstances ever use materials, especially binary ones (software, installers, etc.), conveniently provided to you from someone.\nIn the best case, everything goes normally.\nIn the worst case, you've installed materials that have nefarious contents baked into the entirety of the OS, and every single thing you do is at risk of being stolen.\nThere's also the middle ground where your friend promises it's clean, and for all they know it is, but even they're not aware of the danger lurking in wherever they got the installer from.\nIf you have any question of validity about something, that is an immediate situation where you should never proceed with installing or running it. Find the source, verify the source, acquire it legitimately and proceed from there.\n\nA: Firstly my advice, purchase the update to Mountain Lion (you can go from Snow Leopard 10.6.8 to 10.8), it's cheap, really cheap.\nThe only way to determine if the installer is genuine is to run a checksum of the contents, or download it as new which will require a purchase.\nOff course it's impossible to know what revision of the installer you have, so this answer may be factually wrong but the process is valid.\nIf you have the installer for OS x 10.7.0 then this command\n/sbin/md5 \"/Applications/Install Mac OS X Lion.app/Contents/SharedSupport/InstallESD.dmg\"\n\nwill return a checksum of b5d3753c62bfb69866e94dca9336a44a; note this does assume that the installer is the /Applications directory and not somewhere else.\nCan you use it to install and then install Xcode? Literally yes you can, but as the comment's say, if you don't own it, it's illegal for you to use there are however no technical restrictions on installation that will stop you, only your own moral compass.\nYou may however find that installing Lion updates from the Mac App Store will not work.\nThis all leaves you in a position where your Mac is less secure, cannot install essential security updates, and that is even assuming the Lion installer provided is not already compromised in some way.\nIf you have multiple machines in your house, then yes you can purchase once and run the installer on both machines.  This is explicitly allowed in the Mac App Store terms and conditions:\n(i) to download, install, use, and run for personal, non-commercial use, one (1) copy of the Apple Software directly on each Apple-branded computer running OS X Mountain Lion, OS X Lion or OS X Snow Leopard (“Mac computer”) that you own or control.\n\n", "Q: make a certain file type hidden I am trying to find a way to make my mac see .dSYM files as hidden. I know I could do:\nchflags hidden / -name *.dSYM\n\nbut the next time I create a .dSYM file it wont be hidden. There must be a way to tell finder to hide a certain file type (all currently on my machine, plus all that I will create in the future).\nI am assuming that just because it is hidden, it wont affect my ability to use the .dSYM files when I am running cgdb in terminal? Or do the have to be not hidden for cgdb to be able to find them?\n(I am on Mountain Lion)\n\nA: AFAIK there isn't a direct way to do this. There are several alternatives though:\n\n\n*\n\n*Folder Actions: Create a folder action (which gets triggered upon each change in a folder) to run the chflags command if needed. As Folder Actions only apply to to one folder this needs an Action for every folder you create .dSYM files in\n\n*launchd: Use WatchPaths to run a script whenever one of the listed paths is modified\n\n*Hazel: Hazel is kind of like Folder Actions on steroids and allows you to create actions based on various rules\n\n\nPS: cgdb isn't affected, chflags only makes files invisible on Finder level (and in Open/Save dialogs).\n", "Q: Booting from SSD in optibay (MacBook Pro mid-2010) I'm considering putting in an SSD for extra space and faster boot times and such in my MacBook Pro Mid-2010.\nDue to losing the sudden motion sensor if I move the existing mechanical HD to the optibay, I'm considering just putting the new SSD there and booting from it.\nIs that possible to do? How does bootcamp handle it? And is the hibernation issue still here in Mountain Lion?\n\nA: I went through a lot of the same questions you were asking and had to search high and low to find my answers.\nFirst of all, this is my setup:\nMacBook Pro Mid 2009\n\nOptibay: SSD\nHD Bay: Original Mechanical HD\n8GB RAM\n\nOS X Boot Disk: SSD\nWindows Boot Disk: Original Mechanical HD\n\nSSD: Mac OS X \nOriginal Mechanical HD: Windows 7 Partition / Mac OS Extended (Journaled) \n\nOk, so here is the reasons for the described setup.  I, like you, put the SSD in the Optibay because of the motion sensor issue.  The Optibay doesn't have a motion sensor and the Original Mechanical HD isn't motion sensor equipped. So I put the SSD in the Optibay and boot into OS X. \nThe next issue I faced was the fact that Mac's can freeze when trying to do hibernate with an SSD in the Optibay. So I disabled Hibernate.  This had a few nice perks, such as faster sleep and resume and the gaining back of 8 GB of SSD space that was wasted by the Hibernate RAM Image that Hibernate will make before your machine runs out of battery.  Now obviously, this means that if I was working on something important and my battery dies, then I will have lost it forever.  So this is a risk you will have to be willing to take but it is up to you. Personally I only do really important work while the charger is plugged in because of the fact that I am doing that work for 8 hours straight. \nUpdate\nNow some searching on the issue recently showed me that as of 10.8.1, this issue of freezing when waking from sleep had been fixed. I have not tested this personally on my machine because of the fact that I am used to having hibernation disabled.  I don't like or need hibernation personally and I like the extra space I get from disabling it.  Now the article says that it has been fixed but it does not state anything about Optibays, it only states its fixed for the SSDs in the Original HD Bay.  I would recommend testing it out though, leaving Hibernation turned on, sleeping your machine while NOT doing any important work, and seeing if it wakes, doing it multiple times, just to be sure.  If it does freeze or cause issues, then I would recommend disabling Hibernation.\nEnd Update\nYou can disable Hibernation with the following command:\n# Check Current Hibernation Status\n\n$ sudo pmset -g | grep hibernatemode\nhibernatemode   3\n# 3 is the default mode, we want to change this to 0 to disable disk writes.\n\n# Disable Hibernation\n$ sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0\n\n# Now we can remove the old sleep image\n$ sudo rm /var/vm/sleepimage\n\nNow as for Windows, since I had Windows Installed on a 50 GB partition of the Original Mechanical HD, I just left it there. Installing Windows is a pain the butt and I didn't want to do it again. Also, I am rarely ever on Windows, I only use it to play some games and to do some Windows Development on every once in a while. Also, by keeping it there, you keep windows from having any possible issues with booting from the Optibay (though when I had the Original Mechanical HD in the Optibay as a test, it booted just fine). \nSince I use the SSD for pure Apple Stuff, I took the original Mac OS X partition that was on my Original Mechanical HD and just reformatted it to extra space for my Mac.  I download and store all my heavy giant waste of space extra files on that partition so I don't take up space on my precious and fast SSD in the Optibay. You could also partition it in a format that both Mac OS X and Windows 7 can access, such as ExFAT, so that they both play nice with the space and you have extra storage that both can share. Very convenient.\nNow after you get all your pieces in place, be sure to go to System Preferences > Start Up Disk and set your SSD as the startup disk.  If you don't, it might delay your boot time because it thinks it has to look for the disk in the Original HD Bay. \nAnother tip that you will see all over the place is to enabling TRIM on your SSD. You only need to do that though if your SSD DOES NOT already do it for you. My SSD did not require me to enable TRIM, so I didn't.  Enabling it when you don't have to can sometimes slow down performance slightly but it will not hurt anything. Just check your manufacturers website or do a google search on your drive to see if its necessary. \nAnother thing you see all over the place is people recommending software for doing a copy over to your new SSD. Copying over your SSD is usually no problem, but issues can occur sometimes, especially if you copy over your windows partition as well.  I, like many others, will recommend just doing a clean install and copying your data over and reinstalling your programs.  Now obviously this could be a huge pain in the butt but it is completely worth it.  It will usually allow you to take stock of whats on your drive, and help you trim the fat from your file system and reorganize yourself. I have done both, complete copy and clean install and copy and can say that my machine seemed slightly snappier with the clean install. My boot time dropped by a second or 2 as well.  \nDoing all of this and taking the precautions with Hibernation, my computer has never been faster.  It boots in 6 seconds!\nI highly recommend an Optibay if you can, it can make all the difference. I hope that this long answer helps you out and answers your questions about storing your SSD in your Optibay.  Personally it was the best choice for my computer and my needs.\n\nA: The Startup Disk pane in System Preferences lets you choose which disk to boot from by default:\n\nThis panel shows every disk or partition with a valid install of OS X (or Boot Camped Windows). Just select which one you want as your default and you're ready to go.\nYou can also choose a specific one at boot up by holding down the Option key until you see the large disk icons that allow you to choose a specific disk/partition.\n\nA: Only problem with this is that the Optibay can't support SATA III 6GB/s (even on Macbook Pro 2011 which has a port that supports SATA III). One can only install a SATA II SSD in the Optibay. This appears to be an Optibay problem. Otherwise, one will get laggs, beachballs and such even if your operating system is on the HD bay! \nPutting a SATA III SSD (unless its backward compatible) in Optibay will freeze your Mac! \n", "Q: How to retrieve deleted photos (duplicate) from iphone?

I didn't want to modify half my system on half a dozen devel and production machines by installing RVM, rbenv, Homebrew or anything else. I also want to show how I found the problem since this can occur with any Ruby installer.\nSome things I noted by trial and error:\n\n\n*\n\n*Compiling OpenSSL and Ruby using --with-openssl-dir=/usr or ..=/opt/local did not help. \n\n*After recompiling Ruby 1.9 using /opt/local as openssl-dir, other than in numerous other posts on the web, I could run SSL based connects from the command line fine.

Not on virgin new apps.\n\n*This occured only when using the pg Postgres gem which contains native extensions.\n\n\nLooking at the PG gem's bundle:\n$ otool -L /opt/local/lib/ruby1.9/gems/1.9.1/gems/pg-0.14.1/lib/pg_ext.bundle \n/opt/local/lib/ruby1.9/gems/1.9.1/gems/pg-0.14.1/lib/pg_ext.bundle:\n/opt/local/lib/libruby.1.9.1.dylib (compatibility version 1.9.1, current version 1.9.1)\n/usr/lib/libpq.5.dylib (compatibility version 5.0.0, current version 5.3.0)\n/usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 159.1.0)\n/usr/lib/libobjc.A.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 228.0.0)\n\nThe PG gem does not link against MacPorts's libpq!

OSX's libpq (of course!) links against OS X's libssl and libcrypto. Bingo!\nSolution: RTFM! PG's README-OS_X says:\n\nIf you need a custom installation of PostgreSQL, you should ensure that you either compile it against the same version of OpenSSL as the OpenSSL extension of the Ruby you'll be using, or compile it without SSL support.

Apparently, it automatically compiles against the OS X built-in Postgres (9.0) libraries, which are of course compiled against OS X builtin OpenSSL.\nOnce I found this to be the reason, the fix was trivial. No need to install RVM, rbenv, Homebrew or anything else. Just recompile the PG gem ...\n", "Q: Boot time on Mountain Lion I have my MacPro Quad and upgraded to Mountain Lion.\nI have cloned the system hard disk to bootable external HD.

The principle behind this is that jobs should linger around just\nin case they are needed again in the near future. This not only reduces the latency\nof responses, but it encourages developers to amortize the cost of program invoca-\ntion.\n\nYou could keep the program or script running for 10 seconds and watch for changes every second:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nstart=$(date +%s)\nprev=\n\nuntil (( $(date +%s) >= $start + 10 )); do\n    new=$(stat -f %m ~/Desktop/)\n    [[ $prev != $new ]] && say a\n    prev=$new\n    sleep 1\ndone\n\nOr the same in Ruby:\n#!/usr/bin/env ruby\n\nstart = Time.now\nprev = nil\n\nuntil Time.now >= start + 10\n  current = File.mtime(\"#{ENV['HOME']}/Desktop/\")\n  `say a` if current != prev\n  prev = current\n  sleep 1\nend\n\nBut is there some way to bypass or decrease the time limit? It also applies to folder actions.\n\nA: You could keep your script running in a loop checking for modified files instead of quitting when it is done.  Have it sleep for a few seconds after checking for the modified files.  If it finds modified files, continue with the script.  If not, sleep again.\nThen have launchd start your script every x minutes just in case the previous run dies.  Code the beginning of your script to check if another instance is already running and if so, quit itself. \n\nA: There is no way to bypass or decrease the time limit.\nApple's documentation regarding Creating Launchd Jobs states the following:\n\nImportant If your daemon shuts down too quickly after being launched, launchd may think it has crashed. Daemons that continue this\n  behavior may be suspended and not launched again when future requests\n  arrive. To avoid this behavior, do not shut down for at least 10\n  seconds after launch.\n\nYour program or script needs to keep running for at least 10 seconds. Consider implementing a loop to check for file modification dates in the last ten seconds, sleeping for ten seconds, and repeating.\nAlternatively, you can watch specific files using the kqueue or FSEvents APIs. This StackOverflow question may be helpful, File-level filesystem change notification in Mac OS X.\n\nA: If you need start a script more often than every 10 seconds, it can be expensive in term of \"forking\" (read: allocating memory, starting new processes etc).\nTherefore, in this case is the best to write your own \"daemon\" (program, what runs in the background)\nI recommend you use an \"more capable\" language as BASH (my favorite is \"perl\", but ruby is OK too) because a good daemon handles timeouts, alarms and so on - things what is too hard implement in pure bash. (Of course, the daemon can run your bash scripts too - if needed). The basics are:\n\n\n*\n\n*script what is running endless and waiting for some event. The event can be some network input, or simple timer or anything like. When the event arrives (e.g. the wait state ended) the script will do what you want and the cycle repeats.\n\n\nIn the perl world already exists modules what tuns your script as \"daemon\" process, for example Proc::Daemon. I'm not experienced with ruby, but this article can help you.\nYou can start your daemon process via Launchd at the system startup, or from automator app when you logging in, or from the Terminal manually.\n", "Q: How often do my Mac contacts sync with Gmail? I set up my Contacts in OS X Mountain Lion to sync with Gmail. I just went to Gmail and made some contact changes. How can I determine when this will sync?\n\nA: Assuming you've synced your contacts via Address Book then, if you want a deterministic way of syncing in addition to the periodic sync, you can invoke a sync manually from the menu bar app.\n\nOSX is a bit unpleasant in that it will only add this menu item if you set up iCloud, however, you can add this menu to your menu bar without iCloud :) To do so, you need to open a file called Sync.menu located in System/Library/CoreServices/Menu Extras on your install volume (usually Macintosh HD).\nYou should only need to open this file once and then the menu item will remain on your menu bar until you remove it and should persist through logins and reboots.\nIf you want a quick terminal command to do the above then fire up Terminal and enter the following:\nopen /System/Library/CoreServices/Menu\\ Extras/Sync.menu\n\n", "Q: How do I associate the right Contact Card under Users & Groups to my own profile?

However, when I click on the \"Open\" button next to \"Contacts Card\", it thinks that this user profile is associated to the contact card of another member of the family. How do I change that to my own Contact Card?\nThe consequences of this wrong profile is that whenever I install a new software and I get asked for my name, it keeps putting the name of the family member by default. I also had to go back into my Mail, Contacts & Calendars settings where the full name field was filled out with the family member's name although the accounts were set up correctly.\n\nA: I ran across this issue when restoring a backup to a new phone. \nIt was showing another family member's contact as My Card under Contacts.\niCloud wasn't even signed in.\nI had to go into Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars.

Regardless of the setting for \"My Card\" on the device, apps still pulled info from the \"My Card\" of the original shared AppleID.\nWe could not get the \"My Card\" setting to stick across the board.  The contacts app would show the correct \"My Card\", but apps would pull data from another card.  Also, from time to time, the \"My Card\" setting in Contacts would switch back to the original card.  We had to use the iCloud.Com web interface to make the \"My Card\" setting stick across the board.\n\nA: Go to setting...mail,contac,calendars....

Imagine your iPad or iPhone doing that - would be very annoying. \nIs this a bug or can this \"feature\" be turned off?\n\nA: While from my experience this bug seems to be resolved since OS X Mountain Lion, it might be that your Launch Pad database already was corrupted when upgrading, and upgrading does not necessarily repair it.\nYou could try rebuilding your database and see if that resolves your problem, but please note that this will remove your current ordering and grouping of apps in Launchpad completely.\nTo remove/rebuild the database, you can execute this command from the Terminal:\nrm ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Dock/*.db; killall Dock\n\n", "Q: Profile Mountain Lion's startup Recently my Mac mini became quite slow without a real apparent cause.

Is it possible to configure OSX Mountain Lion to go from suspand-toRAM to suspend-to-disk after certain amount of minutes? \nThe default sleep mode seems to be suspend-to-RAM until the battery is almost empty. This makes it troublesome for traveling with the laptop as the battery is guaranteed to go to empty after closing the lid and putting your computer to the bag for a day or two.\n\nA: According to the pmset man page, \n\nhibernatemode = 3 (binary 0011) by default on supported portables. The\n       system will store a copy of memory to persistent storage (the disk), and\n       will power memory during sleep. The system will wake from memory, unless\n       a power loss forces it to restore from disk image.\n\nBut then also\n\nstandby causes kernel power management to automatically hibernate a\n       machine after it has slept for a specified time period. This saves power\n       while asleep. This setting defaults to ON for supported hardware. The\n       setting standby will be visible in pmset -g if the feature is supported\n       on this machine.\nstandby only works if hibernation is turned on to hibernatemode 3 or 25.\n\n(which it is by default on supported portables)\n\nstandbydelay specifies the delay, in seconds, before writing the hibernation image to disk and powering off memory for Standby.\n\nOn my machine, with settings that I believe are default, when I type pmset -g |grep standbydelay I get the result of 4200, meaning that after 70 minutes of sleep, the machine cuts power to the memory and restores from the memory image saved to the hard drive.\nIf your settings do not look like this, the pmset command just might be your new friend.\n", "Q: Xcode commit view: keyboard shortcut for jumping to the next change? When I commit my code from Xcode (File -> Source Control -> Commit), is there a command (that can be assigned a shortcut presumably) to jump to the next change in the commit view?

Otherwise there is some mouse work to do, which is not very productive.\n\nA: I'm unsure of the version that this feature became available, but you can jump to the next and last change of the currently viewed file (Navigate -> Jump to Next/Previous Change). The shortcut is ^ \\ for next and ^ | for previous.\nThis can be used on Standard and Assistant editor, but NOT Source Control Editor.\nI can confirm that this feature is available in Xcode 10.1 and Xcode 10.2\n", "Q: How do you prevent CodeRunner from prefixing its console output with [00m[00m[00m[00m[00m? There seems to be a connection between CodeRunner's console output and your actual terminal prompt script, that is, if such prompt code is sourced from e.g. ~/.bash_profile (which CodeRunner reads by default).\nI have a pretty fancy (read: great) terminal prompt (screenshot|code) that seems to mess up CodeRunner's console output, leading to garbled [00m[00m[00m[00m[00m characters at the start everytime I run some code, even though it's error-free and regardless of language).

(I've tried contacting the developer about this but I'm receiving no answer.)\n\nA: The culprit probably is line 88 in your prompt.sh:\ntrap 'echo -ne \"\\033[00m\"' DEBUG\n\nThis will output an ANSI escape code to reset the colors and style before the output of every command.\nFrom examining your bash script, this line seems to be unnecessary, because you are resetting the formatting at the end of your prompt here on line 76:\nPS1=\"$status_style\"'$fill \\t\\n'\"$BY\\$(__name_and_server)$Y\\w$G\\$(__git_prompt)$RESET$ \"\n\nI suggest you just remove line 88 and try it like that.\nSomewhat unrelated to this problem, but I also suggest editing line 73 to the following:\nlocal RESET=\"\\[\\033[0m\\]\"\n\nThis way you are truly resetting the ANSI styling, whereas before you were setting it to white.\n", "Q: Why does finder report my applications are in the trash when I use Open With?

You turn on/off what imap folders you see on your devices in there.\nAnother way to view the imap folders is to not use Apple's Mail app, and use \"mail.google.com\" in Safari.  This has way more options, and one of them, clicking on the 3 bars icon above the first mail, will show you all your folder/labels.\n\nA: I found that my gmail 'sent label' was not appearing in my ipad mail.  From there, it was just a matter of going to gmail desktop/web client (where you get access to settings) and in the Settings->Labels, make sure the 'Show in IMAP' is checked for your Sent Label (and any others you want to appear through the IMAP interface for that matter).

We have a newer mac mini with 10.6.8 server that I want to transfer over to.  Can you tell me the steps/document to help me accomplish this?  I see the apple doc for xfer to Lion, but not 10.6.8\n\nA: Using Migration Assistant in 10.6 you should be able to do this fairly easily.\nCheck out the following KB article from Apple : http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4413\n\nA: If you can afford the downtime, you will retain the most information and likely accomplish the fastest copy by performing a \"Restore\" of the current server's drive onto the MacMini server's drive (this should work just fine being that both machines are currently running the same OS version). This can be accomplished by using the Disk Utility restore function.\nPerforming a restore (block copy) of the data from one drive to another will require you to boot from another disk (the 10.6 server DVD?) to perform the copy. However, this will retain all permissions, settings, trusted bindings, license, and other requirements from your previous install.\nNote: restoring via Disk Utility may require you to choose to erase the MacMini server's startup disk for it to be able to perform a block copy (which is the fastest restore option).\nTo restore the iMac drive onto the MacMini:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot the iMac up from the Mac OS X Server DVD.\n\n*Boot the MacMini up into FireWire Target Disk Mode, and connect it to the iMac via FireWire\n\n*Open the \"Disk Utility\" program from the \"Utilities\" menu\n\n*Select your iMac's internal drive, and then click the \"Restore\" tab\n\n*Confirm that your iMac boot drive (\"Server HD\"?) is specified as the source\n\n*Confirm that your MacMini boot drive is specified as the target (drag it from the source list on the left into the \"Target\" field)\n\n*Verify that the \"Erase destination\" check box is enabled, and click \"Restore\"\n\n\nThis process should replicate the exact configuration that your iMac server used onto the MacMini. You will want to make sure not to connect both devices to the network at the same time if you were using a static IP address (likely with OD) on the old server.\nIf this is not feasible, using the Mac OS X Server migration assistant that is available during the initial Setup Assistant phase would be recommended.\nIf you cannot afford to have the current server shut down, it is possible to replicate all of the data that you want to transfer by hand (while booted), but it is a much more involved process.\n", "Q: How to troubleshoot NIS binding problems on OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion?

In older versions of Safari and Chrome you can filter http requests to only show xhr requests for example. This seems to have been removed in the Safari 6 developer tools.\nAm I missing something, an undocumented hot key?\n\nA: In the Instruments panel (the icon of the stopwatch), click Network Requests on the left. You should then see the timeline on the left, and a list of requests underneath. Click the Type column heading to sort the requests by type and then all the XHR requests will be grouped together.\nAlternatively, in Safari's Develop menu, you can select \"Use WebKit Web Inspector\" to switch back to the old inspector.\n\n\nA: The Safari filtering of XHR in Safari 6 and 7 is different to any of the other browser tools that I know of.\nYou need to go to the Resources pane and in the navigation sidebar on the left you will see folders that group resources.\nTo get to Resources from the Safari menu, choose Develop > Show Page Resources or ⌥⌘A or select the Resources icon from the toolbar when in Web Inspector.\nIf the page has any XHR responses you will see an XHRs folder there with the XHRs listed below it. Other resource folders include Stylesheets, Scripts, Images and so on.\nYou can navigate these 'folders' (they are logical, not real) via the navigation sidebar, or the navigation bar.\nSelecting an XHR from either the navigation sidebar or navigation bar, shows the response in the main content browser, and other details in the details sidebar.\nI'm using terms from the Safari Web Inspector Guide\n", "Q: Does Cinema Display daisy chain work in Windows via Bootcamp? \nPossible Duplicate:\nDual Thunderbolt displays with a Mac running Windows under Boot Camp? \n\nI am wondering if I can have use two Cinema Displays in Windows using daisy chain.\n\nA: Assuming that you intend to use two Apple Thunderbolt Displays daisy-chained to a Thunderbolt-equipped computer (whether Mac or not) while the computer is booted into Windows, yes, it should work, assuming whatever drivers are needed are installed and the graphics card has enough power to push two displays' worth of pixels.\ntl;dr: If one Thunderbolt monitor works, two identical monitors should work just fine, assuming your graphics card can handle both of them at once.\n", "Q: How can I access my iCloud files on my Mac? When I save a file that I've written in TextEdit, it saves to iCloud by default. If I close the file, and close TextEdit, the only way for me to find that file is by searching it in Spotlight and opening it. I can't find a folder on my computer that contains those files. When I right click the file that shows up in Spotlight there is no option to open enclosing folder. I tried going on icloud.com and logging into my account but I couldn't just get a simple list of the files I had saved on the cloud. \nWhere are my iCloud files? And how I can I remove them from iCloud?\nI've been looking online for about an hour at this point for an answer to this question and am stunned that I haven't found one/anyone else with the same problem. I'm sure I must be missing something very obvious. \n\nA: The iCloud files are cached on your Mac, so you can access them even when you have no internet connection. They are stored in ~/Library/Mobile Documents/.\nTo make it even more accessible, you can add the folder in your sidebar.\nThere you'll see that each application has it's own folder with it's own documents. Files can be added or removed in this window.\nTo make sure you're working in your iCloud, you can try and delete a file.

So iCal has \"Work\" and \"Home\" as two of its default event types associated with the colors green and blue respectively.\nHow do I add a third event type, say \"School\", and set its color to be something other than blue or green, say red?\n\nA: You can add one on iCloud or on your Mac. Just navigate to 'File' and create a 'New Calendar'. \n\nAnd there, you'll be able to create a new calendar, and with 'Get Info' (right-click), you can choose your color.\n\n\n", "Q: How do I use two different desktops on two different monitors with Lion? So I want to use two different desktops on my two different monitors in Mac OS X Lion. The only options I can find are extended desktop and mirror desktop.\nIs there any way to use two desktops simultaneously and pin one to each monitor? Either a native OS X functionality or (cheap) third-party solution?\nThe reasons for desiring this are essentially so I can have the two monitors functioning completely independently of each other. I would like two menu bars (the program SecondBar achieves this to a limited extent) and two docks (I haven't found a good program to do this). I would also like the ability to, for instance, play a game on one monitor while have the other free for browsing and typesetting.\n(I have considered using a VM program like Parallels or VMware to create a second instance of OS X and pin the VM to my second monitor, but I would like something a little less memory intensive if at all possible.)\n\nA: You wouldn't need two VMs running, merely one running while you use the host OS X would accomplish what you want.  It would be easier to give a suggestion based on a more detailed explanation of what you wish to do or accomplish.\nIf you want something to not disappear when changing spaces try using the \"assign to all\" option.\nFrom comments below, option for multiple docks\ndockit\ndockshelf\n\nA: In the same vein as FaultyJuggler's VM idea, have one Mac hooked up to two monitors and use VNC or similar to view the screen of a second Mac on your network full-screen on one of your monitors. \n\nA: You could use two physical Macs, each hooked up to a single monitor, with something like Synergy allowing you to move your mouse and keyboard between the monitors so you only need one mouse and one keyboard.\n", "Q: The Kindle app on my iPhone 4s isn't downloading books I've been using the Kindle reader app on my iPhone and it was working as advertised for a while. However, yesterday for no apparent reason it has stopped being able to download books. I bought a book, went to my list of books in the Kindle app, and tapped the \"download\" control. The message reads \"Downloading 0.0%\" and just stays there. I tried downloading another recent purchase. Same deal. I tried restarting the Kindle app, and then the iPhone, but that didn't help. I tried going onto the Amazon and \"sending\" the books to my iPhone with no result. I made sure the iPhone is connected to my home wi-fi network.\nHas anyone else seen this problem? Know of a solution?\n\nA: You say it suddenly started working again?\nMy best guess is that it was caused by GoDaddy's DNS servers going down.  This has caused generally odd behavior across the internet as many sites and URLs were 'forgotten' temporarily.  Many sites became unreachable.  \nThere's a chance the Kindle downloading mechanism relied on an address that was affected.\n\nA: Restarted the iPhone again and now it's working.\nNo idea why it wasn't working before.\n", "Q: Zooming UI note-taking app I'm looking for an iPhone app with which users can use the zoom in and out to write down characters in all kinds of scales.\nTo be more specific, if the user zooms in, the whole canvas would become larger to the user, making it possible to write relatively small characters.\n\nA: Prezi.com has an iPad app, not quite what your looking for but I imagine it is the closest that exists at the moment, you could always use any drawing program (adobe has a few) and I imagine it would have zoom capabilities.\n\nA: check out iLA ... here is a free iBook on it:\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/book/individual-learning-tool/id597180343?mt=11\nQuite a killer app when it comes to take and share notes ...\nRTF, images, links and even notes on notes ... dead simple sharing \nHas it all for me ..\nAh yes, iPhone and iPad app ... zoom in the note by long press on the note ..\n", "Q: What's the easiest way to get contact info from gmail into Mac's Address Book?

I had apps such as Starbuck's app running on it without a problem. I just didn't get the latest incompatible updates.\nI tried upgrading to iOS 4.2 a few days ago. Before the upgrade process, it backed everything up to iTunes. It performed the upgrade and then asked if I want to set up the phone as a brand new one or restore from a previous backup. I chose the latter option.\nAfter the upgrade was complete, I had a lot of the data on there (e.g. notes, pictures, email account, music, etc.) but all my 3rd party apps were gone. Now when I try to install some apps such as Starbuck's it won't let me even download them.\nIs there any way I can get these apps back onto my iPhone? I don't mind downgrading back to 4.0 (if that's even possible).\n\nUPDATE: The phone was not set up to synchronize applications via iTunes. I was thinking that the applications were going to be transferred to the computer as part of the backup process.\n\nA: There's no way to download previous versions of apps from the App Store. The only way to install previous versions of apps is by having the IPA file. Syncing with iTunes would have backed up the IPA file.

I have this awesome MacBook Pro with 8 GB of RAM. When I open up Activity Monitor it would seem that I have plenty of RAM available, but my computer seems to prefer to use virtual memory for many things. Why is this? Is there a way to change it? Would it be wise to?\nAlso,I seem to have 7 GB of pageins and no pageouts. Is that normal? That's a lot of data.\n\nA: You seem to misunderstand virtual memory. Virtual memory is simply a mechanism that the OS uses to make it look like each program has its own, extremely large (4GB on 32-bit, 16 EB on 64-bit) address space. It also provides a way for the OS to use paging, all while making it look like (to applications) only real RAM is being used. In short, it's only an abstraction, and the \"Virtual Memory\" stats in Activity Monitor are meaningless (for 99% of use cases). You should not be worried at all about whatever number appears there, because it has nothing to do with whether \"real\" RAM is being used or not.\nAbout your paging stats : you gave no details on how you use your system, so it's hard to know whether something's wrong or not, but I wouldn't be alarmed by a value of 7 GB. Also note that the reported values are Page ins/outs since boot, so if you keep your laptop on all the time like me, it's no wonder that the number accumulates after a while.\n", "Q: How to quickly turn on/off active corners?

If you create a new account, make sure it has non- administrator status! Do this by going to System Preferences -> Accounts, and clicking the + button at the bottom left corner. Alternatively, you can just have them log in as a Guest, which you enable from the same pane, and after which anything they've worked on will be deleted from your machine. In both cases, you don't have to mess with your account or any of its settings, and things are just as you left them once your friend is finished with whatever they need to use your machine for.\n", "Q: Invert scrolling on Windows Bootcamp It just irritates me a little bit that when I scroll in Windows, I have to scroll normally, but on Mac OS X, I have to change back to the other scrolling (Inverted), I prefer the Mac OS X way, is there a way to have this setting on Windows using Bootcamp settings or such?\n\nA: WIndows BootCamp reverse scrolling\nhttp://tsentas.net/windows-bootcamp-reverse-scrolling/\n\nA: I've recently switched from Parallels to Bootcamp for doing 3ds Max work. This issue drove me bananas! I finally found this fantastic utility, called Trackpad++. It not only solved the 'natural scrolling' issue, but also brought back things like three-finger drag, and other gestures. It really is the perfect solution (and no, I don't know the developer):\nhttp://trackpad.forbootcamp.org/\n\nA: From user3669959's linked answer:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Mouse settings in the Control Panel\n\n*Click on the Hardware tab, \"HID-compliant device\", Properties\n\n*Click on the Details tab\n\n*Choose Device Instance Path in the Property drop down menu\n\n*Note the VID value\n\n*Run regedit\n\n*Edit HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Enum\\HID\\VID_???\\VID_???\\Device Parameters, where the ??? is the VID value we just found\n\n*Edit FlipFlopWheel\n\n*Change the value from 0 to 1\n\n*Close all programs\n\n*Reboot\n\n\nThis worked for me on a Windows 7 64 bit PC, using the Boot Camp 5.1.5769 AppleWirelessTrackpad64.exe driver.\nReferences:\nhttp://tsentas.net/windows-bootcamp-reverse-scrolling/\n\nA: And to invert horizontal scrolling, use a very similar Powershell script (remember to run Powershell as administrator):\nGet-ItemProperty HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Enum\\HID\\*\\*\\Device` Parameters FlipFlopWheel -EA 0 | ForEach-Object { Set-ItemProperty $_.PSPath FlipFlopHScroll 1 }\n\n(note FlipFlopHScroll instead of FlipFlopWheel)\n(Per this link)\n\nA: I've written a small c# app to change the registry settings for all devices.

I then took the mac to the Apple Store, where they changed the bad hard drive out.\nWhen I got back, I tried to restore from the backup. At first I tried on bootup, but that didn't seem to do anything (did encrypted backup hurt me here?) then I loaded the mac back, added my account, updated some software, and tried to recover. I went into \"Enter Time Machine\" selected my Users folder, and clicked Recover. It did some calcs, said there was a huge amount of data to copy, and looked like it was chugging through - 1 hour progress bars and whatnot. But, i don't see any data on my hard drive. \nI should be restoring like to like (10.7.4 => 10.7.4). I can see all the files on the drive, should I just do a file copy? Is there something i'm missing?

This will restore the current date and time.\n\n\nA: Thecafremo's suggestion did not work the next time I got this bug. I realized that it had to do something with the time, some sort of time-drift in my network, so I turned off the WIFI and connected to the internet through 3G -- and it worked!\nSome sort of security -validation is based on the time and with heavily-network-reliable devices such as iPad, you seem to get this kind of odd bugs -- not really sure whether some other way exist to solve this, what about without 3G card?\n", "Q: Is moving without shutting down good for MBP My friends told me,while I am moving to other places, I can just close my rMBP without shutting down the computer.\nIs it a right concept?\nWill it damage hardwares?\n\nA: That's perfectly safe to do, it's best to wait until the hard drive spins down and the sleep light activates before moving it. On a MacBook with an SSD (like the Retina or Air), you don't even need to wait for that, since there's no spinning hard drive.\n", "Q: Is there a web viewer for photos stored on iCloud? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I view my iCloud Photo Stream online? \n\nI am new to iCloud. When I open iCloud.com and login with my Apple ID, I couldn't find my photos there. Is it possible to view photos on iCloud.com itself? \n\nA: Not at the moment. To view your Photo Stream you need to access it on an Apple device (Mac, iOS or Apple TV) that's signed in with your iCloud ID. iCloud.com doesn't offer any functionality to view the Photo Stream, and it seems unlikely to any time soon.\n\nA: You can also use iPhoto to see this PhotoStream.\nYou can activate it in the left sidebar or in the your Mac preferences under 'iCloud'.  \nThat's how I see my photos in the iCloud on my Mac. Unfortunately, it's limited to the last 30 days, so not all your iCloud photos will appear in this list. But it's rather easy to create different albums from your PhotoStream to you Mac!\n", "Q: How can I disable CPU throttling on Late 2006 MacBook with no battery? The problem I am experiencing is that if the battery is not present, the CPU is automatically throttled.  I have done some searching and have found that this is apparently by design, \"in case the power supply cannot supply enough power, so the machine won't shut off.\"\nNow, here is the problem.  I can't put the battery back in, because it started swelling up like crazy.  I can't really justify the cost of a new battery for a machine this old and I can't really afford a new computer, so I'm stuck with this machine.  It still works, but throttled back, a lot of things like flash video players are almost useless at the reduced CPU usage.\nI don't really care if the machine shuts off if the supply can't keep up with power requirements.  My understanding is that this really should only happen if the supply is mismatched, i.e. from an adapter designed for a smaller machine, but even if its not it is just as intolerable to have to reload netflix every 30 seconds when it loses sync than an occasional power loss would be.  Besides, it is already losing power every time I need to move it somewhere.\nSo, what's the solution?  There has to be some way to override the throttling, right?\nBy the way, I have already tried sudo pmset -a dps 0 but that just gives me a usage message.\n\nA: Throttling on MacBooks is set in the firmware and, to my knowledge, is not changeable by the end-user. Unfortunately, in this case, your options are 1) replace the battery 2) get a new machine 3) don't use CPU-intensive tasks.\nWhile not an Apple-acceptable solution, check eBay for new batteries. My 2008 unibody MacBook Pro's battery recently began swelling and reached unusable size. I replaced it for around $30-40 on eBay with a perfectly compatible third party battery. Just double check voltages and other numbers on the batteries to make sure you're getting a matching part.\n", "Q: Can I save iCloud documents to the Documents folder as well as to iCloud? Basically, I want to be able to save a copy of my iCloud documents that I made in Pages (on both mac and iOS) to my documents folder, where all my pre-iCloud documents are still stored. \nto note: I still want to be able to save a pages document to iCloud, but I would like to have a way of getting to them from the documents folder.\n I hope that makes sense :)\n Thanks!\n\nA: You can save a document to as many places as you like by using \"Save As\". There is nothing special about iCloud on that level, it's just another \"place\" you can select in the Open/Save dialog.\n", "Q: How can I stop my iPod connecting to my computer when I plug it in? Seems like a strange question, but here is the situation: when I arrive at work, I want to recharge my iPod. The easiest way to do that is via the USB connection on my computer.\nBut if I plug it in, I have the minor irritation that the iPod goes straight to the Do not disconnect screen (interrupting playback). I then have to go to the Safely Remove Hardware and Eject Media option in Windows (Windows 7) to get what I really want: the iPod just charging as if plugged in to the mains.\nIs there a simple way to prevent this? I don't have (or want) iTunes installed.\n\nA: Sorry but it isn't possible from just a configuration change.  Neither the iPod nor Windows have options to not mount it.\nI had the same requirement and ended up making my own USB cable that only passed the power but not the data connections.  If you look around online, you can find the same thing for sale for only a few dollars \n\nA: Without installing iTunes, and configuring it not to sync automatically, the only options are power cable related:\n\n\n*\n\n*purchase a charge only cable such as Logic3 USB Charger Cable for iPod\n\n*purchase a powered USB hub and don't connect it to anything, just use it to charge the iPod (which is basically a cheap USB charger)\n\n*purchase a stand alone iDevice charger\n\n", "Q: Sticky note widgets each have their cursor blinking as if active all together Using a new MBP Retina at work with Mountain Lion.

It's SO annoying. I'm on a Macbook Pro (Early 2008) with OS X Mavericks and my dashboard has about 9 sticky notes that appear to be active with the blinking cursor, but it's not just limited to them. Other widgets such as the Dictionary and translator, and others I have downloaded that have the ability to write something, also blink.

Since I upgraded to Mountain Lion from Lion I see the CalendarAgent process occupying a large amount of 1 CPU on my late-2008 MacBook Pro. To fix this (as suggested by a Google result) I tried removing all online calendar accounts then re-adding them. This seemed to work for a while, but now the problem has returned (perhaps due to me either deleting some iCloud calendars or adding an additional Google calendar delegate). I don't really want to have to remove all my calendar accounts each time I add or remove a single calendar, so can anyone point me to the root cause of the problem?\nIn case it's useful, the call graph from the process is pasted here.\nUPDATE: I removed one of the delegates from one of my Google calendar accounts, and that prevented this problem occurring. This isn't really a solution though, as I now can't access that calendar.\n\nA: I am still looking for a solid answer. \nIn the meantime, I have the following script running in AppleScript Editor.  This script looks for the CalendarAgent every 15 seconds and kills the process.   \nThis renders calendar syncing unusable, but at least I can use my Mac again.  I will let this run until I find a permanent solution.  \nThe script is:\nrepeat\n  set app_name to \"Finder\"\n  do shell script \"killall -9 CalendarAgent\"\n  delay 15\nend repeat\n\n\nA: Using Google delegates definitely caused the high-CPU problem with me.  \nThe simple solution is to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Uncheck the delegation w/in Calendar's Account info window (as indicated by the UPDATE above)\n\n*Change your Google calendar sharing by selecting the desired calendar(s) within the Google Sync Settings page: https://www.google.com/calendar/syncselect\nMaking this change eliminated the high-CPU problem, without needing to resort to the kill-the-CalendarAgent approach.  \n\nA: May have to kill and rebuild Calendar db:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable the Calendar service from your account in System Preferences → Internet Accounts\n\n*Remove the preferences/database files for Calendar:\nrm -r ~/Library/Calendars/ ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iCal.plist\n\n\n*Re-enable the service.\nSource: http://robert.accettura.com/blog/2012/08/19/how-to-stop-calendaragent-from-eating-cpu/\n", "Q: How to install rpm tool on Mac OS X 10.8?

As for making the date ordinal, I don’t think it’s possible or would require heavy plist modifications or may depend on your localisation settings.\n\nA: In the current version of Pages your only option is to insert a table, then use spreadsheet formats to insert a day.\nCreate a table with a single cell, enter =today() in the cell, then use the formatting panel to choose a date format, remove table/cell borders and so on.\nIf you're not happy with the formatting options available, see Forumas & Functions Help in Numbers to find additional options.\n\nA: I want to boost @bjbk's response, since this question is the first web search result.\nThe \"Automatically update on open\" feature was removed from Apple Pages at some point, and the workaround is to follow @bjbk's advice in this question.\nConfirmed on Pages 11.1.\n", "Q: How to create a binary plist file from the command line on OS X? I am looking for a solution to create a binary plist file from the command line on OS X?\nI want to create the ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist and setup the PATH there.\nI know that this plist file has to be in the binary format and I know how to write to it using the defaults write command. Still, I do need to create the file before doing this, and creating an empty file does not work. \nNote: I need a command line solution.\n\nA: You could also create an XML or old-style property list and convert it with plutil:\nplutil -convert binary1 test.plist\n\nIt modifies files in place by default. You can specify a different output file with -o or print to stdout with -o -.\n\nA: At least as early as Mac High Sierra (10.13.4), defaults write (e.g., whether of the form defaults write com.example.test '{a = (b, 2);}' or defaults write com.example.testb \"a\" '(b, 2)') is creating binary plist files for me in ~/Library/Preferences/ even when the file hasn't yet been created.\nAnd it can be created at a particular path by swapping a domain with the desired file path, e.g.,\ndefaults write \"/users/brett/Desktop/com.example.testc\"  \"a\" '(b, 2)'\n\nThe XML syntax also works:\ndefaults write \"/users/brett/Desktop/com.example.testc\" '<dict><key>a</key><array><string>b</string><string>2</string></array></dict>'\n\n(Supplying JSON does not work (despite plist being able to convert it to JSON).)\nOne can also use defaults import to create a new binary plist file, whether defaults import <domain> - which lets you (via stdin) use either of the syntaxes above (or defaults import <domain> pathToExistingPlist, assuming the referenced plist is itself a binary file).\nFinally, one can use defaults export on an existing file, assuming it is expressed as XML or the ASCII property list (or another binary plist).\ndefaults export com.example.test1 /path/for/com.example.testcopy.plist\nThe latter is similar to the behavior of the plutil command in the answer by @user495470 except that it will only copy in place if you specify a path in the second argument which leads to the same file as that referenced in the first (domain).\nWith the exception of the latter export syntax (which creates an empty <dict> upon finding a non-dict type at root), for any of the above, errors are given when trying anything but a dict at root.\n\nA: This piece of bash solved my problem:    \nif [ ! -f '~/.MacOSX/environment.plist' ]; then\n  mkdir -p '~/.MacOSX'\n  defaults write ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist TEST_VAR 1\nfi\n\nStill, I have to warn others that OS X 10.8 seems not to be loading the file.\n", "Q: How to change PATH environment variable to OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion that will be visible to GUI applications?

Guess what, no change.\n\n\nIt seems that PATH is always PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin for GUI apps.\n\nA: With Mountain Lion /etc/launchd.conf is where you should set the GUI applications Path. Remember it's not a script file; it only supports launchctl commands so you should write something like:\nsetenv PATH /new/path:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin\n\nNote also that it doesn't support shell environment variable substitutions (like $PATH) so you'll have to set every path that you want to include. It's a good idea to keep the original paths that you've mentioned (/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin).\nYou'll have to reboot after changing (or creating) the file for the changes to take effect.\n\nA: It works if you call the GUI app from Terminal:\nPATH=/this/is/kind/of/crazy:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin /Applications/Automator.app/Contents/MacOS/Automator \n\n\nNot really nice or comfortable but it does the job if needed.\n\nA: I cooked up another solution, inspired by patrix one here, that hopefully is a little less painful. Open Automator, select an application as target, and choose Execute Shell script (or whatever it is called, in German it is \"Shell-Skript ausführen\" as can be seen above) as action. In the script, just type\nlaunchctl setenv FOO1 bar1\n[...]\nlaunchctl setenv FOOn barn\nopen -a YourApplicationHere\n\nThen save the whole thing wherever you want, and if you need to run YourApplicationHere, open the created \"automator application\" instead.\nI tested this with Terminal as YourApplicationHere, and saw with launchctl export that FOO was indeed set to bar. I hope it works for others as well.\nFinally, if you use this solution for your environment variables, instead of typing the launchctl stuff in the shell script, you may just call /Users/Shared/conflaunchd.sh (which you have to make up first, together with the file describing the variables).\n\nA: Supposedly, launchctl provides PATH to GUI Apps.

(I used shutdown -h +1 instead of shutdown -h now just to be over-cautious and give it an extra minute to tidy up or whatever before shutting down.)\n\nA: Assuming you have already set a destination for your TM, you could open a shell in Terminal (or ssh in), sudo su into super-user mode, then run tmutil startbackup --block;shutdown -h now;exit which tells TM to begin a backup immediately, turn off the Mac, and exit the shell.  man tmutil for more info.\nYou could also then add this as a launchctl item or even cron it to schedule.\n\nA: You could setup a crontab to use tmutil through the command line to do a backup and then shutdown. since shutdown requires sudo privs, you have to set your crontab up as sudo.\nsudo crontab -e\n\nEnter your password and then that brings you to edit the contab file\nshutdown -h now\n\nShutdown does exactly that but with the -h flag, it halts the system (shutdown).\nFor the shutdown to work, this would have to be setup as an crontab under sudo\ntmutil startbackup\n\nStarts the timemachine backup.  \nPutting it all together:\n00 20 ** ** ** tmutil startbackup --block && shutdown -h +5\n\nWould do the backup at 10:00pm every day and then shutdown\n", "Q: Does iOS 6 turn-by-turn navigation work with satellite images?

So a question that I've always been curious about are devices that contain two cameras (one for video chat, etc., and one for everything else). Of course, it wouldn't be such a big deal on devices with low-resolution displays, but because of the advent of the iPhone 4 and new iPad (/iPad 3rd Generation), those crummy VGA quality cameras really detract away from an ideal experience.\nUsing this article at PC Magazine, we can see that it could possibly be the price difference...\n\n...The new camera is three times more costly than the earlier model...\n\nBecause looking at the teardown photo from iFixit really doesn't make it appear to be a physical size issue (not downplaying the cramped quarters of the real estate inside an iPad, but the VGA and HD cameras appear to be roughly the same size).\nSo at this point in the game, why not use the same higher quality camera for both sides of the iPad?\n\nA: It's pretty much impossible to answer this without inside information, but it's likely some combination of size, cost and part availability constraints.\n\n\n*\n\n*Size: it's hard to tell from the iFixit photos the depth of the components, but that's almost certainly the limiting factor. That's often cited as one reason the iPod Touch doesn't have a better camera (it's simply too thin). The iPad is obviously thicker, but it's still fairly limited in depth (which seems to be the most significant dimension of the camera modules).\n\n*Cost: I'd put less stock in this one, but iSuppli's estimates put the iPad 3's cameras at around $12, and the iPad 2's around $4. If we assume most of that difference is in the upgraded back camera, we can make a rough guess that it would cost about $8 more to put in a better front camera. Apple makes ~30% margins, which is about $150 on the 16 GB WiFi iPad 3. So an extra $8 would eat 5% of their margin (less on the more expensive models). I'd say that's unlikely to stop Apple from doing it if they felt it was a good idea, but enough that they wouldn't just stick it in there on a whim either.\n\n*Parts availability: Apple ships huge quantities of iPads (17 million last quarter alone, more than 84 million to date), and new models have been supply-constrained (i.e. they can't make enough to satisfy all orders) for months after launch. Requiring twice as many of a part could have detrimental effects on production (and therefore sales and profits).\n\n\nI don't think any single factor is the reason why, but if I had to put money on it, I'd say it's mostly component size and availability.\nOne final thought: the front camera is mostly used for FaceTime and the odd self-portrait. FaceTime quality is mostly a function of the quality of your internet connection—adding a better camera wouldn't necessarily make an appreciable difference, based on my experience with FaceTime.\n", "Q: Is / always the path of the system drive? I need to know which drive is the System drive. \nIs it safe to assume that / is always the system drive ? Or in some situation (for example booting from a FW drive) / is not the drive were the system is. thanks. \n\nA: The basic answer is yes, although it depends a bit on exactly what you mean by \"system drive\". A few versions ago, Apple introduced what they call \"Boot≠Root\"; I can't find much documentation on it, but the basic idea is that OS X can load the booter file from one volume, then use a different volume as the operating system root.\nFor instance, when your startup volume is encrypted with FileVault 2, it actually loads the booter from a different volume (the hidden \"Recovery HD\" volume); the booter decrypts the startup volume, and then loads the operating system from the encrypted volume.\nThe rule is that / will always refer to the volume you are running the operating system from, just not necessarily the one that the boot process started from. This applies whether you're starting from an internal disk, FireWire disk, USB disk, NetBoot disk image, disk image,... whatever.\n", "Q: How to delete Bingo Bash data game from iPad I downloaded Bingo Bash, which links to their server. Whenever I delete it and re-install it back, it will come back to the level that I was last playing. \nHow can I totally remove all the game data and play it from the start? And I also mistakenly connected with my Facebook account. Now when I play with my iPad, the same level also happens in my Facebook account - I'd like to disconnect this, and start the game from scratch.\n\nA: Apple doesn't implement a user method to delete data stored in iCloud or Game Center.\nYou need to ask the developer to make that code in the app itself. I'm fairly certain a program that can write data can also clear it - but it's really up to them to implement that call to Apple's API in GameKit and CloudKit respectively.\nSee:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I delete data for one game in the iPad Game Center?\n", "Q: How do I know what changes a programe wants to make? We've all gotten the popup dialog box that says \"[Some App] wants to make changes, type your password to allow this\", but is there a way to get more information about what those changes are?  It's always from an app I \"trust\", but I'd still like to know more about what it's doing that it needs my password for.  Seems an aweful lot like Windows Vista's uber-useful security popups.\n\nA: You can use sudo opensnoop -n ProcessName to see what files have been opened by a process, but only after they've been accessed of course. You could also use fseventer to display modified files in a tree view.\nThe dialogs are shown by installers because they need root permissions to modify /Applications/ or other folders that aren't owned by the user. You can press ⌘I to see what files would be copied by an installer.\n", "Q: Does iPhoto copy all photos from Photo Stream, or just make references? When using Photo Stream on the iPhone, you have access to the last 1,000 photos taken, or the last 30 days of photos (source). That same rule applies to all iOS devices, and beyond the 30-day window, no photos are actually saved to your device unless you specifically select and save them to your Camera Roll.\nWhat about with a desktop or notebook system (e.g., iMac, MacBook Pro, etc.)? Are the photos only temporarily accessible through iCloud when you see them in iPhoto, or are they actually stored on your computer?\n\nA: Unlike your iOS device(s) that have a smaller more finite amount of memory, your desktop/notebook systems are more than capable of storing the photos, as they're found in your Photo Stream, they're also automatically imported to your iPhoto Library (same source as the question above):\n\nBut since your Mac has more storage than your iOS device, it\n  automatically imports every picture from your Photo Stream into your\n  photo library so you can edit, delete, and share the ones you want.\n\nTake note, however, that there is a difference between your Photo Stream collection and your iPhoto Library. Attempting to interact with any photo being viewed while Photo Stream is selected will prompt you to view the copy in your Library.\n", "Q: Clean up iTunes excess Over the past years, I have removed plenty of songs from my iTunes library, but not deleted the files, and now my Music/iTunes folder is double the size of what iTunes reports as my library size. I don't care about any of the songs I have removed from my library. Is there any way to delete all of them? Thanks in advance!\n\nA: There's a handy AppleScript that will identify files in your iTunes folder that aren't in the iTunes library: Music Folder Files Not Added.\nDownload the file, open the .dmg and add the script file to ~/Library/iTunes/Scripts (you may need to create that folder if it's not there already). Then it should appear under the script menu in iTunes (a scroll icon between the Window and Help menus).\n", "Q: What's the difference between launchd and folder actions? Could someone please briefly explain to me the difference between launchd and folder actions?\nDo folder actions use launchd?\nIs one more efficient than the other?\nIs one more powerful than the other?\nIs one used more over the other?\nWhat is the difference between launch and launchctl?\nThanks!\n\nA: Launchd and Folder Actions are two vastly different concepts.\nFolder Actions\nFolder Actions allow you to attach actions in the form of Apple Scripts folders which get triggered if the content of the folder changes. Typical use cases are e.g.\n\n*\n\n*a folder to auto-upload photos to a website\n\n*removal of file attributes (e.g. the \"downloaded\" attribute)\n\n*triggering import into Evernote\n\n*etc.\n\nlaunchd\nlaunchd is a system-wide feature to run and control system-level background tasks. These can be either running all the time or get triggered by specific events (e.g. a connection request coming in over IP, a changing folder, a specific point in time etc.). OS X makes heavy use of this concept for all kind of things, have a look at the names in /Library/LaunchAgents and /Library/LaunchDaemons to get an idea of functionality depending on launchd.\nBecause launchd is a system service running in the background all the time it can't be accessed by the user directly. To send commands to launchd, the launchctl command is used.\nAnswers to specific questions\n\n*\n\n*Do folder actions use launchd?\n\nMost probably not. You can use launchd to do everything folder actions can do but at least on a level visibile to the user these are two different concepts\n\n*\n\n*Is one more efficient than the other?\n\nNo difference here, both get triggered by OS X upon special conditions.\n\n*\n\n*Is one more powerful than the other?\n\nlaunchd is definitively more powerful.\n\n*\n\n*Is one used more over the other?\n\nIn a newly installed system there already is a great number of active launchd scripts but no folder actions. Because the later must be explicitely activated and configured by the user, it's probably a safe guess that launchd is used more often.\n", "Q: Cannot share clipboard when using Microsoft Remote Desktop Connection to Windows7 I use Remote Desktop Connection on my 10.6.2 to connect to Windows XP and Windows7. I can share clipboard between mac and Windows XP but Windows7.\nAny idea how to make it work for Windows 7?\nIt seems to me that it work sometimes. Not sure when and why.\n\nA: Batch this, and use it in a CMD file, \nMake a program Group / Desktop link to the batch for Citrix PS users, \nor even better, use VBS to do the task and Link it to the Desktop:\n%SystemRoot%\\system32\\Taskkill.exe /im rdpclip.exe /f /t\n%SystemRoot%\\system32\\rdpclip.exe\n\nA: You should try to make sure the process rdpclip.exe is running in your Windows 7 box.\nIf it is, try killing it and restarting it.\nThis process transfers the clipboard contents over RDP.\n\nA: Something I found on the Windows forums is to enable all of the drives as local resources (check the box labeled \"Drives\") when you connect to the remote machine.\nThis allows me to copy and paste now.\n\nA: Open task manager on the remote desktop . In the Process tab , you will find process rdpclip.exe . Right click and select \"end process\" . Search for executable rdpclip.exe in your system and run it . This solved the copy/paste problem for me .\n\nA: I had the same problem in my Mac and as I noticed in RDP connected windows os appeared \"attached drive\" in section \"Devices and drives\". So that was the only thing for me to copy files from OSX to WIN through RDP client.\nYou have to edit desired connection and under the tab redirection you have to specify folder to redirect. soon after you start modified remote connection you will see new folder under the device and drivers in This PC\n\nA: Be sure to use CTRL + V to paste in Windows, not ⌘ + V.\n", "Q: Mid 2009 MacBook won't recognize [any] hard drive My MacBook had been acting fine. I applied the latest update to Mountain Lion and closed the lid. When I opened the lid, it wouldn't wake from sleep (dark screen with whirring fan for ~5mins). I held the power button and it rebooted to a dark grey screen. I reset the pram using Cmd+Option+P and it booted to the grey screen with flashing question mark. So I rebooted with the install disk for lion (I didn't make one for 10.8). Disk Utility doesn't see my root partition, it does however see the Mac OSX Base System 1.4 GB partition (I'm not sure if this is actually on my HDD or if it is a virtual file system created by the install disk). In any case, I swapped out to my OEM hard disk and rebooted. Disk utility still only sees the Mac OSX Base System. diskutil list reports the same. I can't reboot to recovery via Cmd+R or via holding the Option key. I also don't hear the hard drive spin up. At this point I'm thinking that I have a bad motherboard. \nIs there any way to confirm that the motherboard is indeed bad? \n\nA: It was the logic board. I'm using the hard drive now as an external drive with out problem.\n\nA: My iMac 27\" 1TB HDD died, and we phoned around for a replacement HDD.  We were offered on many occasions to take the machine in to them to repair ... for $600 !!\nWell we bought a new 1TB HDD as per recomendation, as utilized the power of Google and YouTube.  \nWe taught ourselves how to replace the HDD, and did. However, with an unfomatted HDD the iMac could not \"see\" the new HDD.\nWhat we found was to load a full OS X onto an external HDD by using our MacBook.\nOnce that wasdone, we then plugged into the iMac and found that the iMac could now \"see\" the new internal HDD.\nWe formatted the internal HDD using the Guid Partition Table.\nUse the following AWESOME link to continue your journey to replace the OS on your Mac.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-nz/HT202796\n", "Q: Fixing MBP battery which has been sitting I have a new battery that has only 3 or 4 cycles on it, that I got as a replacement a year ago. The battery and the machine it's in, a late 2008 MBP, has been sitting for the last year unused. I tried to boot it up today and it appears the battery is toast. OS X reports it as \"Replace Now\". I tried to charge it for a few hours but the machine shut off as soon as I unplugged it. Is there a way I resurrect this battery?\n\nA: According to http://www.apple.com/batteries/notebooks.html:\n\nIf you don’t plan on using your notebook for more than six months, Apple recommends that you store the battery with a 50% charge. If you store a battery when it’s fully discharged, it could fall into a deep discharge state, which renders it incapable of holding any charge. Conversely, if you store it fully charged for an extended period of time, the battery may experience some loss of battery capacity, meaning it will have a shorter life.\n\nSo you are most probably out of luck.\n", "Q: Finder takes long time to load some folders When opening some folders, the Finder takes a long time (30-60 seconds) to load all the files in it. Specifically, these folders typically contain 10-50 PHP files (which are text files), each about 10 kb.\nI also notice that sometimes, after the files are listed, their icons are still loading and the \"Kind\" column is also still loading. (I've got the \"Name\", \"Date Modified\", \"Size\", and \"Kind\" columns showing; \"Calculate all sizes\" is enabled\" while \"Show icon preview\" is disabled.)\nIn addition, when opening a directory such as this and viewing Activity Monitor, I see that coreservicesd is at 70% CPU and Finder is at 30% CPU. After all the files have loaded, both services are still at these CPU levels for about 60 seconds afterward.\nAnyone know how I can fix this? I already did \"Repair disk permissions\" and \"Repair Disk\", along with a ton of miscellaneous Onyx tasks, but the problem still remains.\n\nA: There are many things you can try to fix this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Trashing com.apple.finder.plist, com.apple.systemuiserver.plist and com.apple.loginwindow.plist (they will be recreated when you launch Finder) in ~/Library/Preferences and Force Quit Finder\n\n*Turning off Calculate All Sizes in Finder\n\n*Turning off Show View Options in Finder\n\n\nAnother thing you can try, is to create a new (test)account and see if the problem still exists there. Chances are good you'll solve your issue with this.\nWorst case scenario, you can move your account to a new one to solve this issue.\n\nA: I had the same problem, but none of the fixes above helped.  This finally did:\nhttp://blog.hsoi.com/2014/02/25/my-slow-mac-mavericks-coreservicesd-iconservicesagent-and-how-fs_usage-saved-me/\nSome issue with an application (in my case Xcode) and icons.  \nTry this command in Terminal, which reports realtime filesystem activity from the IconServicesAgent:\nsudo fs_usage -f pathname -w com.apple.IconServicesAgent | grep open\n\nI got endless output like:\n/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents 0.000009 com.apple.IconSe.429515:32:08.066965 open F=4 (R_____)\n/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Info.plist 0.000010 com.apple.IconSe.429515:32:08.067690 open F=4 (R_____)\n/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Library/Spotlight 0.000003com.apple.IconSe.429515:32:08.092972 open F=5 (R_____)\n\nI moved Xcode to the trash, and reinstalled from the AppStore.

I figured it out. Okay, so first thing I did was create a new account, as suggested by another answer. The problem did not occur in there, so clearly the problem was limited to my account. I then went into Safe Mode into my account. The problem did not occur as well. So clearly something was loaded in normal mode but not in safe mode that was causing the problem.\nWhile in safe mode, I then cleared the caches (in Terminal, using sudo mv /Library/Caches ~/Temp/ and the same for ~/Library/Caches). Problem solved! I've had other problems as well in Finder so perhaps this will fix this as well. I'm curious as to why using Onyx to clear the User caches didn't clear these as well, but anyway, from what I've read online it seems like getting rid of these two folders is safe. Also, Time Machine never backs up ~/Library/Caches (but it does back up /Library/Caches), so that's reassuring.\nIn addition, while this post was made in 2003, it still applied to my situation and this was what convinced me to clear my Caches folders.\n\nA: I tried @Gary 's answer, it didn't work for me.\nMy problem was only concerning Shared folders\nAfter a lot of reading and searching, didn't try all solutions, but when i went into the settings-> sharing it was also taking a lot of time to load the settings.\nSo i disabled everything one by one, afp and smb and windows, and then turned off the sharing service alltogether\nThese folders went fast again,\nThen i reenabled it, and the problem didn't reoccur.\nHope this helps somebody else.\n\nA: Starting up in Safe Mode solved it for me!\nI had severe load on coreserviced and finder.\nVarious applications crashed during this. \nOpening folders in finder took ages. Killing coreserviced and finder did not solve it. As soon as I opened folder in finder the load was back again and the CPU burning and the fan screaming ;-)...\nNothing written on this page solved it - Only restart in safe mode!!!\nWhy?\nEver since I administered UNIX systems a filesystem check (fsck) once in a while was always necessary.\nAnd this is what happens on a mac during the progress bar in save mode startup.\nAfter failsave mode startup finished, I restarted normally. \nThen there was some high load for a minute or two for mds and others (icons..) to rebuild their caches.\nBut from then on all was cool - load about 3% tops and only the apps I worked with caused load.\nNow I can enjoy opening folders swiftly again! lol \n\nA: What I have is not a solution, but a way to speed up the process of loading a folder\nIn Finder, choose Go > Go to Folder or type Shift+Cmd+G and then start to type the Path to the Folder you want to open in Finder. (e.g. /Volumes/Server1/MyFolder/Images/) While you are typing, Finder updates the folder as well and displays the content. This requires of course, that you know your paths relatively well, but you can use Tab for autocompletion.\nIn our company, we have the problem that shared folders on the cloud server are very slow when Finder tries to load them (with both AFP and SMB). The same folders are loaded instantly with Windows over SMB, even when Windows is running on a virtual machine on the Mac. Therefore neither a hardware nor a server fault.\nI've tried to purge the Finder caches but without success. Strangely (and this tells volumes about the improvement of the services from Apple's side), as long as we were running some computers on Lion or some other wildcat, those were much less affected than those on the more recent OS.\n\nA: My problem was solved by starting up in Safe Mode (Safe Boot)\nI opened all the folders that were slow in finder. The first 2 or 3 of them were still slow. Then they started to open really fast. Did nothing more. Restarted my machine & then everything was great.\nStarting up in Safe Mode\nTo start up into Safe Mode (to Safe Boot), follow these steps.\nBe sure your Mac is shut down.\nPress the power button.\nImmediately after you hear the startup tone, hold the Shift key. \nThe Shift key should be held as soon as possible after the startup tone, but not before the tone.\nRelease the Shift key when you see the gray Apple logo and the progress indicator (looks like a spinning gear).\nAfter the logo appears, you should see a progress bar during startup. This indicates that your computer is performing a directory check as part of Safe Mode.\nTo leave Safe Mode, restart your computer without holding any keys during startup.\nBest wishes\n\nA: I had exactly the same issue and this helped. In my case it was an OpenOffice installation causing the problem. I removed OpenOffice and the problem disappeared.

You will then have the option to turn on or off several services like email, contacts, calendars, and notes. in fact you can turn on nothing but notes should you desire.\nit wil also be a good idea to visit Settings > Notes on your iOS devices and choose the account you wish to be your default note creation account to avoid any future confusion.\nIf you are setting up notes on an OS X computer and need help try using this online guide that apple provides. it covers how to set up mail and other services on a number of different systems.\nhttp://www.apple.com/support/macosx/mailassistant/\n\nA: You can switch accounts in the Settings < Notes\n \nMaybe you've selected the wrong account (with no Notes).\n", "Q: Downloading a previously purchased app to iTunes on another computer I've purchased and downloaded an app to a computer that I do not sync with my iPhone on a daily basis. I would like to download the same app to a computer that I do sync usually and then sync it.\nIs it possible, if no - is there any workaround?\nI've purchased the app on a Mac and I wan't to do the sync it from Windows (both computers have the newest version of iTunes).\n\nA: It is possible, there are a few steps required.\nThe other computer must be authorised to access that Apple ID.\nOn the iTunes store page on the right hand side, there is a Purchased option, click on this and all previous apps, movies, music, etc purchased will be shown. You can then download it from there.\nApple has a help page about this that can be viewed at http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2519.

During setup, I was asked to create folders for both the PhotoStream and my uploads. I've done all that, but the issue is that I can't see my photos. The folder is even empty. On my iPhone however, all photos are listed in the Photostream.\nHow can I view my photos on my Windows PC?\n\nA: Basically, you need to reset the iCloud settings. There are different ways to do so. \n\n\n*\n\n*Try to close the iCloud control panel and then quit all Apple and iCloud processes by using the task manager. If you reopen the iCloud control panel, chances are good your photos will start syncing.\n\n*Otherwise try to uncheck en re-check the PhotoStream option in your control panel (don't forget to hit the 'Apply' button).\n\n*A last solutions is to uninstall and re-install the iCloud control panel, which will reset the iCloud settings as well. \n\n\nA: I've found iCloud Photo syncing for Windows to be incredibly unreliable.\nAfter multiple re-installs of the iCloud Control Panel, and eventually moving to a new PC, it never syncs photos reliably. The best it can do is show the oldest several photos that's still in my iCloud Photo Stream when I happened to install it. They never go away and the folder is never updated again...\n\nA: *\n\n*Sign out of the iCloud Control Panel\n\n*Uninstall iCloud\n\n*Delete all iCloud folders from your computer. (I used Everything to find all folders matching \"icloud\")\n\n*Run CCleaner and \"Scan Registry for Issues\" to purge registry entries left behind by iCloud\n\n*Download iCloud Control Panel\n\n*Re-install iCloud Control Panel\n\n*Reboot the computer\n\n*Start iCloud and sign in again\n\n*Ensure that iCloud photos are enabled\n\n\nIf that doesn't work give up and https://www.icloud.com/#photos and download your photos from their webpage or use Dropbox or some other photo syncing method.

First day when I launched my Mac mini (OS X Lion) and started to use Safari - at some point it asked me (during the login procedure to the Gmail account) if I want to auto configure mail/calendar/contacts for this gmail account.\nI think that I clicked \"no\".\nI am curious about this feature and I would like to use it (detection of Gmail by Safari? I don't know what to call it) but I am not able to get it back to work.\n\nA: This feature basically adds an account to your system (in this case a Gmail Account). It is the equivalent of opening System Preferences > Mail, Contacts & Calendars and adding said account there. \n\n(On the screenshot I have only one account added: iCloud, but you can add as many as you want, from whichever services listed. Also note, I'm using Mountain Lion, which added support for more sites like Twitter and Vimeo). \nSafari offers to auto add your accounts whenever you sign in for the first time, as I'm guessing many users don't know this preference pane is available. \nBasically what adding an account will do is allow you to sync your information to the apps on your Mac. In this case, your Gmail emails would be downloaded automatically by Mail, your Google Calendar would be synced to iCal and you will be able to use Google Talk with iChat, if so you choose. \nIf you click \"no\" on the dialog box, it wont re-appear (as to not annoy users every time they want to log in) but there is nothing special about the dialog itself, it just saves you opening System Preferences and adding the accounts yourself.\nHope it helps!\n", "Q: Can't find my Automator service action in the Keyboard Shortcuts list I've made a very simple Automator service (moves some selected files into a new folder). It works fine via the Services -> menu. \nSo now I'd like to add a keyboard shortcut to launch this action from Finder, but I'm unable to. According to every person on the internet, I can go into System Preferences -> Keyboard Shortcuts, select 'Services' on left panel, then scroll to bottom of right hand list and my service will be listed in the 'General' section. But it's not listed; I only see three items relating to unarchiving.\nI've searched the web for people with this same issue but can't find any advice.\n\nA: If it receives files or folders as input, it should be in the files and folders section and not the general section.\nWas the service saved to ~/Library/Services/?\n", "Q: Can Safari copy both the URL and page title during a drag-and-drop? I frequently want to paste a URL and page title into a document or email message. When I drag and drop a URL from Safari and other browsers (by dragging the URL icon) I see the page title being dragged with the cursor. However, when I drop it in Terminal or in a Gmail message in plain text, I get the URL only and when I drop it in Textedit or in a Gmail message with rich text, I see the title only (with the link). Can I get both?\n\nA: Byword seems to do that by default:\n\nIt's not really drag and drop, but you could also assign a shortcut to a script like this:\ntell application \"Safari\" to tell document 1\n    set the clipboard to \"[\" & name & \"](\" & URL & \")\"\nend tell\n\n\nA: If you paste into an OS X app that accepts rich text input (i.e. not a web app like gmail), you'll get the title as text with the URL as the link to that text—try it in TextEdit. If you need the title and URL as plaintext, you could use an AppleScript like this one that will copy the URL and title of the active Safari tab to the clipboard (you may want to change the formatting to your liking).\n", "Q: Desktop wallpapers disappear when switch from dual displays to single I started bringing my 2011 MacBook Air to work and hook it up to an external monitor for dual display setup. But when I unplug the display, the desktop wallpapers on the built-in LCD disappears and just show a solid light gray desktop. I have to log out and log back in to get the desktop wallpapers to show again. Is there a way to fix this?\nMany apps also still behave as they were on the external monitor. Do I have to use \"gather windows\" every time I disconnect the external monitor?\n\nA: I also observed the problem after upgrading my MacBook Air (2011) to Mountain Lion.  Not only unplugging the external display triggers the gray background, but also connecting to a display.\nFor the gray background problem, I use a quick-and-dirty fix: restart the Dock.\nInvoke the following command in the terminal:\n$ killall Dock\nThe Dock will be restarted after it is killed, and the wallpaper will appear again.\n\nA: After some exprimenting, it seems that disconnecting the external display first while the macbook is still open fixes the issue. The problem only arise if I close the lid before unplugging the external display.\n\nA: Another workaround is to open Terminal and type \"killall Dock\" at the prompt.\n", "Q: How can I lock Mail/Contact/Calendars in an iPad? All members of my family use the iPad primarily for browsing the Web or playing games.  It is basically a living room computer. But I use it also for my e-mail. \nI know The iPad can be locked with a passcode as a whole (which I don't really need, because anyone who makes it to my living room is welcome to use it), but I would like to lock only the Mail app.  Is there any way to do that?\n\nA: Without jailbreaking, I believe your options are the use of apps that provide this kind of lock functionality built-in, unless Apple decide to implement some kind of multiple user support in future iOS versions for devices like the iPad. \nI've previously come across Secure Gmail or Secure Webmail (there may well be others) which provide passcode protection schemes when starting and, judging by the screenshots, appear to be frontends to the relevant webmail pages (as opposed to a native application like the Apple Mail app). I've not used either, but they may be of use to you.\n\nA: This is only possible if you've jailbroken your iPad. And these days, it's still very easy to do so.\nIf you've jailbroken your iPad, you have some solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Lockdown Pro - BigBoss repo - $2.99\n\n*FolderLock - BigBoss repo - $1.59\n\n*Locktopus - BigBoss repo - $2.00\n\n\nMy favorite is Locktopus, because it's the app you can customize most.\nThe Daily Buggle wrote an excellent post about this topic (and how to use those apps) and they prefer Locktopus too :)\n\nA: One of the best password/passcode protected e-mail apps is CloudMagic.  It works on non-jailbroken iOS devices, has received great reviews and I have used it for years.   :)\n", "Q: Target iMac does not wake up with the main iMac I have two 27\" iMac connected via a Thunderbolt cable. I press Command+F2, the target computer joyfully becomes a second screen for the primary iMac. Joy of joys!\nI come back in the morning, or after lunch, and I press a key on my computer. The display lights up, everything is where it should be.\nUnfortunately, the display computer stays off. I haven't found a way to bring it back on, other than pressing the power button, waiting for it a little (this disables target mode),  then pressing Command+F2 again. This, of course, re-enables target mode.\nAny idea what I could be doing differently and better, for a wholesome dual-27\" experience?\n\nA: You can bring it back on by going to System Preferences / Displays and choose Detect Displays. It can take a couple of minutes to get it back, though.\nApple suggests a SMC reset when a computer that supports target display mode does not switch into or out of the target display mode as expected.\nTo do so, just:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shutdown the computer which is not functioning as expected.\n\n*Unplug the computer's power cord.\n\n*Wait fifteen seconds.\n\n*Attach the computer's power cord.\n\n*Wait five seconds, then press the power button to turn on the computer.\n\n", "Q: Can't unmount the disk during Mac OS X install My MacBook started to get really slow recently. Now it can’t start up properly anymore. All I see is the Apple logo and then it shuts down. I've tried rebooting multiple times, but I've seen the same result over and over again.  \nSo, I tried to reinstall my OS, but for some reason I get the error I cannot unmount my disk. And the partition seems to be locked, so I can't reinstall the OS over the internet.  \nDo I have a damaged disk?\n\nA: You cannot unmount the disk you're working on, obviously.\nTry to boot from a different media type other then your HD (USB-drive, DVD,...) and then try again.\n(Mountain) Lion allows you to create a bootable USB-drive or DVD. If you do so, you'll be able to unmount (and format) your internal Macintosh HD. \n\nA: I had this problem, and I resolved it by completely reformatting the drive. You will need to back up your computer first. To back up your computer, start your Mac in target disk mode (hold down Command-T on boot) then connect it to another Mac using Firewire. The broken Mac should appear as an external Hard drive on the second Mac, and you will be able to copy files from it to an external drive. You can then try using Disk Utility, or possibly a command line utility to reformat the drive. (If Disk Utility still can't unmount the drive, I would recommend using a command line utility, as they are usually more powerful, and can cope with problems that Disk Utility can't cope with. Google how to format a drive using command line on a Mac) \n", "Q: Force iOS simulator to use WiFi network I have two networks, a WiFi and a cable LAN.\nI want use them together, but I want to force the iOS Simulator to use only WiFi, because, the LAN is under proxy, protected, with a lot of limitations.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: The iOS Simulator does not get its own internet connection, it uses the computer's. Therefore, if you want it to use the Wi-Fi network instead of the LAN, just make sure you're connected through Wi-Fi.\nIn System Preferences / Network you can rearrange the order in which the computer gains Internet connection. Just place Wi-Fi on top of the list. On Lion it's done by clicking the gear thingy, and select Set Service Order from the pop-up list.\n\n", "Q: Where is the config (application properties) file for TimeMachine settings and the path excludes?

At the end of the automation I would like to trigger another workflow. The issue is that the previous workflows images are taken as input to the new workflow. How can I run multiple workflows without using the output of the previous workflow as the input for the current. Thanks\n\nA: At the bottom of every Automator action is an Options button.

Check that box on the first action of your second workflow and it won't use the first workflow's output.\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to get Safari of Mountain Lion running on Lion? I noticed the difference in Safari 6.0 in Lion and Mountain Lion. In Lion it is Safari v 6.0 (7536.25) where as in Mountain Lion it is 8536.25.. The way safari works is also a bit different, for instance the tab view. I liked it when I used it, but I want the same in my Lion as well.. Can I copy the Safari.app from my office laptop running Mountain Lion and put it in my 13\" MBP running Lion? Would this work?\n\nA: Unfortunately, no - Safari uses quite a few system-level frameworks that are vastly different between those OSes.\n", "Q: Is it possible to edit the path and view the folder path in the Finder? I'm not sure what it is called on the Mac, but when I open my Downloads folder (or any other folder), I'm referring to this file explorer window that shows me my file structure.\nI know there are options, like I can view my files and folders in panes, or in a detail view, etc.\nBut what I hate is that I can't modify the current path location easily, nor can I cut and paste the current folder path.\nThis really drives me nuts, I wish it could be more like Windows's file explorer as it is so easy and intuitive to use.\nIs there a hidden option for these 2 issues that I am missing?\n\nA: Try FinderPath\n\n\nA Finder addition that displays a small address bar in Finder windows.\n\n\nA: You can drag the icon at the top center of the window to a Terminal window and get the path.\nSelecting and copying a folder or document in a Finder window also saves the path so that when you paste it in a Terminal window you get the path.\nCommand-click the top center icon also allows you to navigate up in the path.\n\nA: Finder does not have a bar like in the explorer on Windows, but there are some things you can do to achieve similar results.\nTo have the current path always visible, open a window and go to View > Show Path Bar. This will add a bar to the bottom of your windows which shows the path of the selected file, the same as if you were in search view. You can also Command-Click on the icon at the top of the window to view the path as a menu. As noted by @lhf, copying a file will also copy its path. You can also drag a file from the window or path bar to most places where a file or path is expected, such as open or save dialogs.\nTo go to a folder based on its path, press Command+Shift+G. This will pop up a box where you can type in a path, and either the current or a new window will open at that path.

Using Command+Shift﻿﻿+G﻿﻿  is the only way to do that I could think of.\n\n\nA: Not an answer to the question per se, but I've used and beta tested (unpaid) Path Finder in the past, it provides a more intensive/technical Finder than the OS X Finder.\nSome of the features that I prefer, among many:\n\n\n*\n\n*Tabbed Finder\n\n*Path dropdowns (like Windows 7 Explorer)\n\n*Dual panes\n\n*Easy access to metadata\n\n", "Q: How do System Preferences remain unlocked? To make certain modifications to system preferences, you first need to unlock the preference pane. Some of these changes are done on a system level and the command-line equivalent would need to be invoked as the root user (via setuid).

Is it safe to have Xcode download documentation in Mountain Lion or will it still quit on its own if all windows are closed?\n\nA: According to OS X Daily, you can disable auto-terminate in Lion and Mountain Lion with the following terminal command:\ndefaults write -g NSDisableAutomaticTermination -bool yes\n\nThis sets the NSDisableAutomaticTermination flag in the defaults database that OS X consults to get various settings.\nNote that this will disable automatic termination for all applications, not just Xcode.\n\nA: OS X 10.8.1 no longer automatically terminates Xcode 4.4.1 while Xcode is downloading documentation with no windows open. It looks like \"they fixed the glitch\" of Xcode not properly communicating its \"working\" status to OS X. Have not tried on Lion, but I would guess that Xcode 4.4.1 no longer is auto-terminated there too when  downloading documentation.\n", "Q: iPod Classic Album Shuffle Playlist [Apologies for the long question. It's not as complicated as it looks.]\nPreable\nI have a 160GB iPod Classic which I manage with the latest iTunes via Windows XP. I have ~10000 music tracks and many podcasts on the iPod. I previously created a smart playlist which included all tracks with a play-count of 0. I would then set the iPod to shuffle Songs and select this playlist. If I returned to it later, songs which I had listened too would not be on the playlist as it would update on the iPod, even without syncing back to iTunes. This worked well and I have now listened to all ~10000 tracks.\nAlbum Shuffle\nI would now like to listen to my music differently: rather than listening to all music tracks in a completely random order, I would now like to listen to complete albums, with the tracks in order. I know that I use shuffle \"Album\" for this.\nThe Potential Problem\nHowever, it is likely that I will not always be able to listen to a complete album before I have to stop listening, or would rather listen to a podcast after a while, for example. This would mean that over time I would always end up listening to the first tracks of an album more than the later tracks, as each time I used shuffle \"Album\" I'd get a new album and would start listening from the beginning of that album again.\nThe Proposed Solution\nTo work around this, I've tried the following: I created another smart playlist which contains tracks which have a play-count of less than 2. This, at present, obviously contains only tracks with a play-count of 1, which is most of my music. I set shuffle to \"Album\" and then select this playlist. As I listen to tracks, their play-count increases to 2, so they fall off the list in future. When I return to the playlist the next day, for example, and the iPod selects a track/album, I presume it will then play only from the first track of that album in the playlist?\nExample\nFor example, if I have listened to the first 5 tracks of an album and then stop, these 5 tracks will be removed from the smart playlist as their play-count will be 2. When I return to the playlist with shuffle \"Album\", should the iPod select one of the remaining tracks (or the album itself; I don't know how it \"selects\"), will it start playing track 6 of that album onwards?\n\nA: It will work as you expect. However, a work around for first-track-will-be-played-most when using album shuffle is to have one or more intermediate playlists that take random samples from the library, e.g., \nLibrary 10 000 tracks\nPlaylist A selects 1 000 tracks from Library by random\nNow if you play from A shuffled by album the first-track-effect will disappear. Add intermediate playlist at will (e.g., if you want all tracks played less than 5 times or so)\n", "Q: Who else besides Apple typically offers Iphone preorders? The iphone 5 is going to be my first iphone.\nSince I've never purchased one before, I'm wondering, who else besides Apple offers preorders in the United States?  Does anyone offer them on the same date that Apple does?\nI only ask because I'd prefer to avoid having to go to the Apple store when it comes out.  I like Apple but the thought of waiting in line for hours annoys me.\nWhich retailers, if any, typically offer preorders?  Which ones officially offer pre-orders?\n\nA: The carriers pre-sell and also have pre-order queues from years past. It's not been something that other retailers have offered as the quantities sent through distribution channels is largely taken by large corporate buyers looking for as many devices as possible so until production catches up with demand, your best bet might be to pre-order directly from Apple and have home delivery scheduled if you don't want to try your luck with the waiting in line game. (You can always go wait in line if you care, knowing your phone has been pre-ordered but the reverse hasn't been true once the initial allocation of pre-orders sells out.)\n", "Q: Is the 9-pin \"Lightning\" connector faster than the 30-pin? The 9-pin \"Lightning\" connector used with the iPhone 5 and 2012 iPods offers many advantages over the old 30-pin connector, including a smaller size and reversibility. However, does it offer faster data transfers? Was this update only for aesthetics? Or does the 9-pin actually offer something more?\n\nA: The lightning cable in terms of USB speed is not any faster than the cable it replaces according to the Apple Store product description for the Lightning to USB Cable\n\nThis USB 2.0 cable connects your iPhone or iPod with Lightning connector to your computer's USB port for syncing and charging or to the Apple USB Power Adapter for convenient charging from a wall outlet.\n\nIt is still only rated to be a USB 2.0 cable, so that implies all the currently just released devices with the new Lightning connector are still USB 2.0. \nSo as far as USB connectivity and transfers go  it can only go as fast as USB 2.0 allows, which should make it an equal with the old 30-pins usb interface. \nThe all digital aspect might be a plus for some users / uses, eg outputting to digital audio devices directly, but even that is unclear, it not really clear what all you can do with the new interface.\n\nAlthough one point taken from the Media event slides is \"Adaptive interface\", not sure what that means exactly, but it may mean that hardware & software developers may be able to program how the pins can be used to interact with devices and accessories. If that is true that could be a huge long term benefit from this major re-factoring of the interface connector for iOS devices. \n", "Q: Is the 20 cm Lightning to 30-pin adapter functionally different than the shorter all in one part? Are the two male Lightning to female 30-pin adapters that Apple is selling functionally equivalent (other than the fact that one has a 20 cm cable between the endpoints)?\n Part MD823ZM/A\n Part MD824ZM/A\n\nA: Yes - they are equivalent in all measurable aspects other than length. Sometimes we find out things that don't make the public specifications about Apple products, but these two items don't seem to fall into that category.\n", "Q: Impossible to sort iBooks PDFs in Bookshelf view? I can drag and drop all day long, but it won't let me so much as touch the data source. Whether I'm dragging cover art around on the Bookshelf or moving rows in the List view's table, there is a major piece of missing functionality.\nTitles and art will duplicate, leaving some PDFs apparently gone, but as soon as I leave the app (or even just change the view), it reloads and gives me the random-sort that I really don't want.\nList view works for finding sometimg to read, minus the completely ineffective reordering action, but it has absolutely no influence on Bookshelf view, which is the one I want.\nI did somehow manage to get one -- ONE of 41 PDFs -- to move.

PDFs are conveniently stored on a separate bookshelf.\n\nHelpful.\n\nA: Problem seems to have been insufficient RAM, since only iBooks was receiving a memory warning and dumping nonvital objects, or something which would have similar behavior.\nIt'd be nice if it iOS was a little louder about this sort of situation. Oh well.\nBelated Edit: Closing some other apps in the background is what fixed it. Yeah.\n", "Q: Lost Time Machine Password - Unable to Format Disk I lost my password to my Time Machine backup.

All in all, this has proven to be a boon to me over the years, and made my experiences with the iOS family of devices a generally positive one.\nHowever, I've noticed a consistent problem that still has yet to be addressed on any of them, and it seems like it wouldn't really be much of an issue for Apple to fix: Though it works without a problem (and very quickly) to adapt to the changes from a dark to a light room, none of my newer iOS devices will dim when moving back to a dark room; regardless of how much time I give them. The only fix to this particular issue being to shut off the screen, then turn it back on, which instantly sets it to its auto-dimmed state.\nI won't accept that I've somehow managed to accrue a collection of the only iOS devices that have faulty ambient light sensors, and I know that it's not a fault of all of Apple's devices with the sensors (because my iMac, MacBook Air, and MacBook Pro will auto-brighten and dim all day long as the sun shines and then gets covered by clouds, only to emerge triumphant a few minutes later).\nSo what gives? Is there a fix that I'm missing? Is this a \"feature\"? If not, why hasn't Apple bothered to fix it?\nFor the record, this has been on every increment of iOS since 4, (unfortunately) including iOS 6 on the devices I use for development.\n\nA: I have noticed that Auto-Brightness works much better on my iPhone then it does my iPad 2, but here are a few things you can check...\nGo to settings > Brightness & Wallpaper \nSlide the brightness slider to the left... Doesn't really matter where as long as it isn't all the way to the right (max brightness) mine is about in the middle, make sure the toggle for Auto-Brightness is set to on.\nYou can test it by:\nPress the \"Home\" button and then lock your iPhone by pressing the \"Sleep/Wake\" button. Move into an area with bright ambient light and use your hand to cover the top third of your iPhone screen. Press the \"Home\" button and move the slider to unlock your phone. The screen should appear dimmed. Remove your hand from the top third of the display. If auto-brightness is working properly, your screen will get brighter.\nYou can read more about it here: http://techtips.salon.com/iphone-auto-brightness-works-3626.html\n\nA: In his review of iOS 6, Anandtech spoke about the auto-brightness. While he does not give you a complete answer to problem, he does explain that the brightness curve is not a logarithmic curve.\nYou can read it on this page after the second image and before Data Isolation. That may give you some more insight but he does say it does not work well on the new iPad.\n", "Q: What can be done to fix a 2011 iMac that will not boot past the white screen? I have now tried opening the iMac and removing the cables to the SSD, it still gets stuck on the white screen. I tried again, removing the cables to the HDD as well and the same thing occurs.\nNo idea what to do from here.\n\nI've done quite a bit of troubleshooting and this problem sounds like mine except that I have an iMac, not a MacBook.\n\nWhile using Windows 7 (via Bootcamp) I shutdown my 27 inch 2011 iMac. After it was shutdown I pressed the power button to turn it back on, it proceeded to play the startup sound and then froze on a white screen. There is no cursor or anything else on the screen.\nI tried unplugging all cables, including the power, reconnecting only the power and attempting to turn it back on with the same result.\nIt does not respond to any key combinations. Holding Alt while it boots does not bring up the disk selector. Holding T does not put it into Target Disk mode. Holding Cmd-Opt-R-P does not have any affect. Holding Shift does not put it into safe mode. Holding Cmd-V does not bring up verbose boot.\nI made a copy of the OS X Recovery Disk onto a USB but am unable to use it as the Mac won't boot from it (and won't bring up disk selector to select it).\nIt was working fine minutes before I shut it down and then suddenly refuses to boot and I am at a loss as to what to do. Sadly, there are no Apple Stores or Genius Bars in my country, so feel free to point to any and all self-help resources I might use. \n\nA: Here is what you know from your excellent details:\n\n\n*\n\n*The keyboard isn't working since all of the shortcuts get handled from the firmware in the Mac.\n\n*The Mac can't find any bootable OS X due to corruption or hardware failure\n\n\nWhy the keyboard isn't working isn't yet clear. I would disconnect everything including the power and then remove both RAM sticks - noting which was on the top and which was on the bottom.\nNext, plug the Mac in and power it up with nothing connected. You should get three beeps indicating the POST (power on self test) detected no RAM. If you have severe hardware problems, it won't know the RAM is missing and you'll know you need to get inside to fix it.\nAssuming this works, power it off after waiting to see if it boots in 5 minutes time (really wait that long for the Apple logo to show up). While you are waiting listen carefully for rhythmic noised from the hard drive. It shouldn't keep seeking past the first 45 seconds and if so - you will know the controller or the drive is faulty. It should spin quietly after a few minutes or be reading the drive if it's corrupt and the hardware / OS is trying to fix things.\nNext - power it off by the button and put the \"top\" piece of RAM in the \"bottom\" slot and repeat. Lastly - if you get to the white screen at this point, try another keyboard (command-s or shift held down are the best options here for troubleshooting) to see if you can isolate the failure further.\nI tried to make some assumptions about what is wrong and you can edit the question or ask another with the step that fails referring to this question if you want to isolate things further before attempting a repair.\n\nA: Along with the link you mentioned in your edit, this is also your exact problem. Go down to the OP's solution to find that he opened up his iMac to fix this.  If you've configured your startup disk as Macintosh HD, the only way to boot to your USB key would be to remove the connection to the hard drive by opening up your iMac.  You might want to ask a repair shop to do this for you, or send it in to Apple somehow. If you decide to do this yourself, here's the iFixit guide. Good luck!\n\nA: You should try and hold down alt on boot, then select which hard drive you will be booting from it is possible there is none configured for startup.\nThen once it has booted set your default hard disk in startup disk under system preferences.\n\nA: I ran into the same problem, iMAC would not boot past the white screen, and I had lost my recovery disks. so I went to Apple website and bought more recovery disks, and when it booted up into recovery mode, it was not showing a target disk to install the op system because it was corrupt, so I then opened up the disk utility and erased the hard drive and then went back to the installer and it then showed the boot target. so I then continued to re-install the op system! Note: it will only bring up the installer and disk utility with the recovery disks. Good To Go\n", "Q: Launchctl:Dubious permissions on file: Problem Installing Jenkins I'm trying to install Jenkins on 10.6.8 and part of this requires that modify the plist launch daemon.  org.jenkins-ci.plist   which is owned by root.  I was using admin and I gave admin permission to write this file. I used this permission to make the admin the jenkins user and set the home directory to be the admin user directory.  However now I cannot run the launch daemon.\nlaunchctl: Dubious permissions on file (skipping)\n\nNow I realize this is due to a security issue with having given myself this permission.  The plist now has my admin user as the user for jenkins.  Should I now just remove the write privileges and all is good (admin can now be the jenkins user) or not?\nUpdate: I did sudo chown root org.jenkins-ci.plist and it still feels things are dubious.\n\nA: If you're in /Library/LaunchDaemons, which I assume you are for a system daemon, and want the files to go back to default:\nsudo chown root:wheel org.jenkins-ci.plist\nsudo chmod 644 org.jenkins-ci.plist\n\nThe plist will register on reboot, or you can load it like this:\nsudo launchctl load org.jenkins-ci.plist\n\nYou can check the status like this:\nsudo launchctl list <<Job Name>>\n\nNote that jobname is not the same as file name. Inside the plist you'll see a Label. That's the name:\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>DataScrub</string>\n\nIn my example the name is DataScrub, so would be:\nsudo launchctl list DataScrub\n\n", "Q: OS X Finder customize default folder display There are several ways to display folders in the OS X finder:\n\n\n*\n\n*Folders as icons you can arrange\n\n*List of items you can expand (collapsable triangles)\n\n*Graphical \"flip\" display\n\n*A column mode where you can arrow left and right\n\n\nThe default view is \"Folders as icons you can arrange\". I however really, really like the \"column mode where you can arrow left and right\". Is there a way to set the default finder display kind?\n\nA: You can do it on a per folder basis. From the folders you care about - I would imagine this is just your users and root harddrive on your desktop. That'll cover most cases.\nOpen them, and hit either command-J, or View -> Show View Options.\nIf you're in Column mode, you'll see a check box to then alway show the folder in that mode.\nIf you always start finder from a couple of pre-defined places, eg. your desktop double-clicking your drive, this ought to cover your most frequent usage.\n\nA: There doesn't seem to be any default view mode at least on Mountain Lion. The view mode used for folders that don't have a view mode saved in a .DS_Store file is changed when you open a new window or close the last Finder window. It corresponds to the FXPreferredViewStyle key, but the key is not always updated immediately.\nThe always open in option should be called something like \"remember view mode for this folder\". If it's checked, the previously used view mode is saved in a .DS_Store file, which overrides FXPreferredViewStyle the next time the folder is opened.\n\nYou can make Finder forget the folder-specific view options by running sudo find / -name .DS_Store -delete; killall Finder. It also resets the positions of windows and icons, Spotlight comments, and sorting modes.\nJust don't select those always open in checkboxes again after that.\n", "Q: Add Chrome to dock with parameters via Automator with chrome icon I need to have started Chrome without the build in Flash\nvia console you add the Parameters\n--disable-internal-flash \nwhich works fine, now i would like to have a Dock Icon which passes this parameter along\nI have an Automator.app which encapsules the start up, but how du i get it somehow automatically to the dock.\n\nA: This worked for me: defaults write com.apple.dock persistent-apps -array-add \"<dict><key>tile-data</key><dict><key>file-data</key><dict><key>_CFURLString</key><string>/Applications/Chess.app/</string><key>_CFURLStringType</key><integer>0</integer></dict></dict></dict>\"; killall Dock.\nQuestions about adding applications with command line arguments to the Dock:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I force command-line arguments to a program shortcut in the dock?\n\n*How do I pass command line arguments to Dock items?\n\n*How to set launch options for programs on OS X\n", "Q: Why doesn’t the fourth generation iPod touch have a wireless window? I was watching the keynote today and noticed that the fifth generation iPod touch has a wireless window. This was also on the 3rd and previous generations, and also on the cellular iPad. \nBut why doesn’t the fourth generation iPod touch have a wireless window, but fifth generation does?\n\nA: As I'm not part of the engineering team I can't tell you why they've resited it, but in the iPod Touch 4 they'd moved the antenna toward the front of the display, rather than toward the back as they had with the previous generations. I'd imagine they've tried it in both locations but due to the way they've slimmed it and moved other components around they probably found that it was a better trade off to have the window back in place.\nStep 19 shows how it'd been moved for the iPod Touch 4. I imagine as soon as iFixit has the new one we'll see some more information about why the window is back in relation to the other components.\n", "Q: Color profile switches with random application launch My color profile seems to be switching when I launch random application. It seems to be doing it every time I open Illustrator or VirtualBox. If I go into the color Profile setting it's on the same setting all the time.\nThe switch is between the normal \"white\" profile to a much cooler \"blueish\" profile. I'm on an early 2011 15\" MBP with 16 gig ram and 10.8.1.\nAny idea what's going on?\n\nA: Yep, seeing the same thing on an early 2011 MacBook Pro as well. It seems to happen when the display switches to the GeForce GT chip from the Intel integrated graphics.\nIt doesn't seem to be random -- I can get it to switch the colour palette back and forth by using gfxCardStatus, which switches the graphics modes. Integrated = goes to normal palette, GeForce = blueish. \nSeems like Apple has buggered up the colour profile for the GeForce chip.\nEdit: For what it's worth, logging out and back in seems to help.\n", "Q: Core Audio Driver not working I have been using Virtual DJ on my machine.  The setup is where I want audio to play over the headphones and use a USB sound card to play audio into my headphones so I can listen to music before I play it for everybody.\n\nHowever, the last time I tried, I got an error message saying \"Error in the sound driver of Core Audio.  Your sound card is probably not connected, or the settings are incorrect\".\n\nIf I use the headphone by themselves, the USB sound card by itself, or my speakers by themselves, they all work individually.\nHow do I go about figuring out what's wrong here?\n\nA: When the USB sound card is plugged to the Mac, do you see it in System Profiler (from Apple Menu -> About this Mac -> More Info... -> System Report) as a USB device ?\nIf so, can you then see the audio device in System Preferences -> Sound -> Output ?\nIf not, would other USB devices work on the same USB port ?\n\nA: I figured it out!\nUnder Utilities, there is a MIDI setup.  This had stored a profile for my Virtual DJ pro software.\nI deleted that profile, restarted my software, and the error went away.\nApparently, there was an invalid configuration saved that was causing the issue.  I wish I had saved screenshots of the profile so that we can actually see what the error was.\n\nA: i figured out how to end this problem. I closed VDJ, then opened application/utilities/audio midi setup. then delete the VDJ advanced setup. then re-open VDJ and it worked like a charm again.\n", "Q: Is the Lightning 8-pin connector magnetic in attachment? After listening to MacBreak Weekly #316: The iPhone 5 it was mentioned, but not confirmed, that the new Lighting 8-pin adapter may be magnetic in attachment similar to the MagSafe adapters for MacBooks.\nI can't really find evidence either way to determine if this is true or false, so can anyone else provide any proof either way?\n\nA: In the external buttons and connectors section of Apple's official spec sheet for the iPhone 5 no mention is made that the lightning connector is magnetic.\nGiven how proud, and rightly so, Apple is of the MagSafe connector, I'd bet dollars to doughnuts they would mention that the new connector is MagSafe if that was indeed the case.\nSecondly, looking at 2D representations of the new connector, it does not have any of the characteristics of the MagSafe connector at all. It uses the traditional male/female plug/socket concept humans find so comforting.\nOnce I get my new iPhone 5, I'll let you know.\n\nA: No it's not. It was just a supposition from some rumors. \n\nA: Whether magnetic enough to bond with the phone like a magsafe does with your computer, it seems to be magnetic enough to stick to the MOS \"Magnetic Organization System\" cable collector without using its separate magnet clips:\n\nMaybe there's some slight usability-aiding magnetic part in it, without which an otherwise identical rip-off copy would turn out to suck much more than an original, but which Apple doesn't boast about as their priorities were making a slim, future-safe cable, not a cable that homes in on nearby phones?\n", "Q: How should I go about restarting a custom Apache install? I'm working on a server that was configured by a former employee and I need to restart Apache.  Unfortunately, it's not the default install and it's in a different place and apachectl doesn't exist and launchctl doesn't even seem to know that this apache is installed or running.  I don't want to break anything and was wondering if there was a graceful way of restarting this custom Apache instance in order to update the configuration files to account for new SSL settings.\n\nA: Assuming you know where Apache is installed, you should be able to gracefully restart it like this:\n\nkill -USR1 `cat <apache_dir>/logs/httpd.pid`\n\n(Untested, but based on the Apache docs).\n", "Q: How to view high-res images in iPad 3 without downsampling? I'm Korean and I like reading web comics on the web. Korean web comics (or as called here \"webtoons\") tend to have large images, and something like 500x12000 JPEG images are not uncommon. But as you know, Safari on iOS downsamples JPEG images larger than 2 MP (or 5 MP in iOS 6) and even 5 MP is not enough in this situation.\nI tried several alternative ways to view large images in my iPad with no luck.\n\n\n*\n\n*\"Save Image\" in Safari and view it in Photos app\n\n*Use other browsers (Chrome, Opera Mini, Terra, Mercury, Puffin, etc.)\n\n*Use other apps (GoodReader, Evernote)\n\n*Download the image in PC, share it using Dropbox, view it in iPad using Dropbox app: the worst quality ever\n\n\nI haven't tried the iPhoto for iOS yet since I don't want to pay for something that I'm uncertain whether it can solve my problem or not.\nThe image I've tried to view on iPad is this one, which is about 7.6 MP. Although the dimensions of the image are huge, the size of the image is only about 3.9 MB. I don't understand why this image should be downsampled to be viewed on the new iPad, considering its computing power.\nI wish to know whether iPhoto can help or there is any way to view large images in my iPad at all. Thanks in advance for any help you are able to provide.\n\nA: There are a handful of workarounds for saving images without being downsampled, use what works for you:\n\n\n*\n\n*Tap and hold the image to save it to Photos app as high resolution, despite being downsampled in Safari\n\n*Save the image to iPhoto\n\n*When publishing images, use PNG or progressive JPG\n\n*Email images to the iPad\n\n\nThis is a well documented quirk in Safari on the retina iPad, it could be a bug or just a way to make the web browsing experience more fluid given current limitations of hardware.

In the comments of this article about Mountain Lion bugs, many users are expressing the same issue that you are having, and having to logout and back in again to fix this.  \nAnother thing you might try (if you haven't already) is to back up and re-install Mountain Lion.  \nupdate Everyone on this thread has the same exact issue. Yes, it is a bug, and yes, the only workaround is to killall Dock. I suggest using an AppleScript with Login Items, launchd, or Lingon (old, free, unsupported version here, and $3 newer, supported version here) to run killall Dock as soon as you log in so that the Dock just restarts itself immediately.  Meanwhile, submit this bug to Apple.\n\nA: Not much you can do about it, looks like a a driver or hardware bug with your specific video card.\nReport it to Apple and wait/hope for them to fix the

There is also a thread on Apple's community forums confirming that suspicion.\nIt looks like the graphics chip is not functioning as intended. They suggested looking into getting it replaced. I know this is not an immediate solution, but I hope it narrows down the issue further.\n\nA: I'm inclined to agree with @Melwan; however, I know how Apple Techs work and they're going to push you to attempt a clean install before diagnosing your hardware. So go ahead and do a clean install (Back up your files of course) then boot your mac holding down the alt key, you should see your HD show up and a restore partition show up. Select the restore partition and make sure you wipe the harddrive and do a clean install. This may help if something that handles your graphics installed wrong. It's worth a shot, especially if you don't have AppleCare any longer.\n", "Q: Looking for iOS music player which includes all id3 information I have open-ended tags stored in the Grouping field of my (iTunes) mp3 collection. I also have information written in the Comments field. A lot of my music is also BPM'd. How can I search by/sort by/access these fields in iOS? The Music app and the 3rd party apps I've looked at so far don't provide this.\n\nA: Music Stats provides some of what you're looking for, I think. It doesn't show all ID3 tags, but it does provide a few of them.\n", "Q: email addresses still showing up A couple of people have changed their email addresses these past few months. Even though I updated my address book (adding the new email, deleting the old one), when I type their name it continues to pop up the old email address as well as the new one, and I have to choose which one I want. Both aren't in the contacts, the old one was deleted. Why is it still popping up and how do I get it to stop?\nI'm using an iPad.\n\nA: GO to  MAIL and open it.\nIn the bar up top click on \"WINDOW\" and you'll see in the drop down menu \"PREVIOUS RECIPIENTS\"  click on that and a list of emails opens up that your system uses as it's preferred email address.  That means you get to type one or two letters and \"it\" fills in the rest of the wording for you.\nYou have to erase these every time you enter in a new address for someone.\nOtherwise  your system keeps putting in old addresses when you try to email someone even though you put in the correct email address into contacts and may even have erased the old addresses.  \n\nA: I cannot find any reference to a \"purge recent addresses\" in iOS so you might need to just erase all Mail accounts and see if that clears the cache of recent addresses. In fact, I can't even find confirmation that this is something that is even programmed.\nHave you tried deleting all contacts from the phone to be sure it's not a problem with the contact database and not simply a mail issue?\nAssuming you have a good backup of your contacts (or they are stored safely in the cloud while you are troubleshooting this) - these are your two options for clearing things further with respect to Mail and the data it contains:\n\n\n*\n\n*wiping the device and setting it up new\n\n*deleting all Mail accounts and then setting them up again (password, servers, etc...)\n\n\n\nThe first is a pain, but should work splendidly. The second is not guaranteed to work, but much easier to do and less setup to get all of your data and apps restored and configured again.\nI would recommend a good backup before deleting anything and knowing all your passwords before deleting a Mail account (screen captures of each mail settings page is a nice way to document the settings before deleting things). Also - it would be good to log into webmail to be sure that all the messages are still on the server. This shouldn't be an issue with IMAP/Exchange - but POP mail is notorious for deleting messages so you may not want to try this if you're not sure all your email is on the mail server.\nSurely a total erase and setting up the phone new would clear this list, but I would start with deleting mail first and then perhaps deleting mail and all contacts to see if the cache of previous recipients gets cleaned out.\nHopefully someone else has a better solution since this isn't something I have tested as I've never had a situation where \n", "Q: can't sync Calendar events from Mac to iPhone Mac running OS X 10.8.1, and iPhone 4 running 5.1.1. Since upgrading to OS X 10.8.1 from 10.7.4, I can't sync Calendar events from the Mac to the iPhone. The opposite direction works just fine. I am using iTunes for the sync via USB, all calendars are checked in iTunes to be synced.\nAny idea what may be going wrong?\n\nA: Ok, after looking at some error entries in system.log I found a link to this Apple KB article: Mac OS X: Resetting the SyncServices folder, which solved my problem. It is important not only to reset the sync services, but also to enable them after that as shown at the end of the KB article.\n", "Q: App Store \"An Unknown Error Has Occurred\", Apple Support fix was only temporary. How fix permanently? When opening an application installed from the App Store (TextWrangler) I am prompted to sign in. After entering the correct Apple ID and password I get an error, An unknown error has occurred. This only happens with one app, other apps installed are OK.\nThis error also occurs when I sign in to the App Store. So its not just affecting a single application.\nThis also seems to be affecting my iCloud login. It prompts for a password then just seems to hang.\nI spoke with Apple Support yesterday. They had me delete all Caches from /Libary/Caches, ~/Library/Caches, and a few cookies then restart my iMac. This fixed the issue yesterday. Today I start my Mac and get the same error again. I called Apple Support and got the runaround, I was told to use ExpressLane which doesn't really seem to have a solution.\nHow can I permanently fix this error?\nPrevious attempt to identify/triage the error\nSearching online turns up similar suggestions to clear caches and cookies, but also some more extreme suggestions involving network settings that I am hesitant to try.\nLogs after starting TextWrangler and being prompted to login:\n9/19/12 10:01:30.611 AM com.apple.backupd[889]: Couldn't find en0.\n9/19/12 10:01:30.638 AM com.apple.backupd[889]: Backup completed successfully.\n9/19/12 10:01:58.592 AM RockMelt[306]: Cannot find function pointer CMPluginInFactory for factory 3487BB5A-3E66-11D5-A64E-003065B300BC in CFBundle/CFPlugIn 0x796aa090 </Users/jon/Library/Contextual Menu Items/Google Notifier Quick Add CM Plugin.plugin> (not loaded)\n9/19/12 10:01:59.885 AM RockMelt Helper[931]: Internals of CFAllocator not known; out-of-memory failures via CFAllocator will not result in termination. http://crbug.com/45650\n9/19/12 10:02:00.615 AM RockMelt Helper[931]: CGSLookupServerRootPort: Failed to look up the port for \"com.apple.windowserver.active\" (1100)\n9/19/12 10:02:07.797 AM WindowServer[89]: CGXDisableUpdate: UI updates were forcibly disabled by application \"RockMelt\" for over 1.00 seconds.

Another forum post describing similar issues suggested deleting /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/NetworkInterfaces.plist. I backed that file up, deleted it, and restarted. I can now log in and out of AppStore, access all of my AppStore purchased apps, and it 'sticks' across shutdowns and restarts.\nProcess is pretty simple, I'll spell it out for future reference:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal\n\n*cd /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration\n\n*cp NetworkInterfaces.plist ~/NetworkInterfaces.plist.bak - Make a hasty backup in your home directory\n\n*sudo rm NetworkInterfaces.plist delete the original\n\n*Restart your Mac\n\n*Open AppStore and try to sign in. It should work.\n\n\nApparently this works because the MAC address is used as part of the receipt/authorization process.\n\nA: What worked for me was to go to Store>Sign Out\nOnce I was signed out, I was able to sign back in and purchase/install apps correctly. Not sure why this happened, but it fixed it for me.\n\nA: As an Apple/Mac repair person, I was baffled by the \"An error has occurred couldn't communicate with helper app\" dialog when trying to use the App store to do a software app. I read through these thread and tried deleting App Store and Network prefs with no success. Also reinstalled OS with no luck.\nHere's what worked: Do a Safe Boot (hold shift key while booting), then go to App store and try downloading/installing updates. It worked and the problem disappeared when the Mac rebooted.\n\nA: Same thing happened to me, and this was how I have fixed it:\nhttp://yasar.senturk.name.tr/blog/2012/09/26/hackintosh-app-store-an-unknown-error-has-occurred-fix/\n1- Edit /Extra/org.chameleon.Boot.plist and add following lines:\n<key>EthernetBuiltIn</key>\n<string>Yes</string>\n\n2- Go to System Preferences, and then Network. Remove all network adapters.\n3- Delete /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/NetworkInterfaces.plist and reboot computer.\n4- Go to System Preferences, and then Network. Click on + button, select “Ethernet” from “Interface” combo box, then click OK.\n5- Reboot computer.\n6- Go to System Preferences, and then Network. Click on + button, select “WiFi” from “Interface” combo box, then click OK.\n"]
