Remember this is not a gnome or some other session. I have created my own application for this session, which are simple.\nCase 1\nChrome Browser\nContents of custom.desktop file\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Internet Kiosk\nComment=This is an internet kiosk\nExec=google-chrome --kiosk\nTryExec=\nIcon=\nType=Application\n\nIssue\nChrome browser starts in kiosk mode but does not capture complete screen area. Some area is left at the bottom and right side of the screen.\n\nCase 2\nCustom pyGTK app (Quickly)\nContents of custom.desktop file\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Custom Kiosk\nComment=This is a custom kiosk\nExec=~/MyCustomPyGTKApp\nTryExec=\nIcon=\nType=Application\n\nIssue\nMy custom pyGTK app has window.fullScreen() in the code. That means it should open in full screen without the window chrome (and it does under the normal session). But that too, leaves lots of space around it.\nNeed Help\nCan anyone tell me whats going on here. I think its some issue with borders as pointed out at http://www.instructables.com/id/Setting-Up-Ubuntu-as-a-Kiosk-Web-Appliance/?ALLSTEPS in Step 8\n\nIf by chance, Google Chromium is not stretched to the edges with the --kiosk switch enabled there is a simple fix.  To stretch Chromium simply log in as your regular user and edit chromeKiosk.sh to not have the --kiosk switch.  Then log in as the restricted user, click the wrench and choose options.  Then on the Personal Stuff tab select Hide system title bar and use compact borders.  Close the options screen and stretch Chromium to fit the monitor.  Then go back into the options window and set it to Use system title bar and borders.  After this is done, log out of your restricted user (might need to just reboot) and log into your regular user.  Edit chromeKiosk.sh back to include the --kiosk switch again and Chromium should be full screen next time you log into the restricted user.\n\nIf I were to use a custom pyGTK or a gtkmm app, how should I get around this issue. window.fullScreen() should occupy the complete screen area. This has to be done programmatically or in some other way that can scale. I have to deploy this on large number of machines located at different geographical areas. Doing it manually on every machine is not possible.\n\nA: This is a tricky one, I had a similar problem, when trying to have only a ncurses based interface on a time tracker pc, the problem for me was that when no window manager is present, normal X Window applications behave oddly. \nHere's my proposal:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install ratpoison window manager sudo apt-get install ratpoison\n\n\n*Unbind keyboards that shows a menu or allows you to execute terminals or commands, putting this in $HOME/.ratpoisonrc the home being the user that will run the kiosk mode  \nunbind c\nunbind C-c\nunbind exclam\nunbind C-exclam\nunbind period\n\n\n*Instead of calling directly to google-chrome, put a script like instructables' link you mentioned\n\n\n\n[Desktop Entry]\nEncoding=UTF-8\nName=Kiosk Mode\nComment=Chromium Kiosk Mode\nExec=/usr/share/xsessions/chromeKiosk.sh\nType=Application\n\n\n\n*\n\n*On the script put this (remember to make it executable)\n\n\n\n#!/bin/bash\nratpoison &\nxscreensaver -nosplash &\nwhile true; do chromium-browser --kiosk http://google.com; sleep 5s; done\n\nWorked for me, with Ubuntu 12.04 and chromium. \n\nA: case1 \nYou need to tell chromium what your screen resolution is by rewriting its preferences file (bottom and right values). The link you posted includes that part.\n#!/bin/bash\n\nprefs=~/.config/chromium/Default/Preferences\n\ncat $prefs |\\\nperl -pe \"s/\\\"bottom.*/\\\"bottom\\\": $(xrandr | grep \\* | cut -d' ' -f4 | cut -d'x' -f2),/\" \\\n> $prefs\n\ncat $prefs |\\\nperl -pe \"s/\\\"right.*/\\\"right\\\": $(xrandr | grep \\* | cut -d' ' -f4 | cut -d'x' -f1),/\" \\\n> $prefs\n\nchromium-browser\n\n(tested in Ubuntu 12.04)\ncase2\nI would say you have to somehow tell your pyGTK app what the bottom and right values are, respectively what the screen resolution is. Then the fullscreen command should make your app cover all of the screen i.e. not leave any borders.\nEdit: it looks like the window.fullscreen() method should in general make it really fullscreen. So no need to define the resolution first.\nMore info here, but I'm sure you already know this:\nhttp://www.pygtk.org/docs/pygtk/class-gtkwindow.html#method-gtkwindow--fullscreen\n\nA: Case 1\nin my case this helped me out:\n\nsudo nano sudo ~/.config/chrium/Default/Preferences\n\nI changed the values according my screen resolution\n\n\"window_placement\": {\n          \"bottom\": 1024,\n          \"left\": 0,\n          \"maximized\": true,\n          \"right\": 1280,\n          \"top\": 0,\n          \"work_area_bottom\": 1024,\n          \"work_area_left\": 0,\n          \"work_area_right\": 1280,\n          \"work_area_top\": 0\n       }\n\n", "Q: Taking screenshots in Lubuntu (11.10) \nPossible Duplicate:\nPrint Screen key doesn't work if a drop-down menu is active \n\nAs you know, by pushing PrintScreen button on the keyboard, a screen-shot of desktop will be saved on your home folder, but why it doesn't work when I open a menu?\nFor example, when I open LXDE menu and then pressing PrintScreen, nothing happen. Neither when menus such as File, Edit, View and etc. are open.\n\nA: Use Shutter, it's something like Snipping tool on Win7. \nsudo apt-get update\n\nsudo apt-get install shutter\n\nAs you open it you have New - Selection / Desktop / Active window...\n\nA: This is because pressing PrintScreen usually makes the menu go away. You can work around this by setting a delay before you take the screenshot. For instance, if you have imagemagick installed you can do the following on a terminal:\nsleep 10; import -window root <filename>.png\n\n\nA: The quick way to take a screenshot on Lubuntu is simply hitting the PrtSc button. It saves your file to your home folder. \nThe software mentioned below, Kgrab, and Ksnapshot, bothe were installed from the Lubuntu Software Center.  Meanwhile, mtPaint was available by default under the Graphics menu.\n\nHowever, certain actions can't be captured using the PrtSc button. Sometimes a time delay is required in order to begin a specific function. I use Kgrab\n\n\n\nor Ksnapshot\n\nAs you can see both have the options to choose full screen, wndows, etc.., and both have time delay.\nYou can use mtPaint. It comes default on Lubuntu. In the menu, there's a timedelayed screenshot option.  Not as easy as the above, but it will do the job.\n", "Q: Keyboard and mouse is not working properly I am having some weired problem regarding mouse and keyboard. I am using a laptor with a external mouse. When i scroll my mouse it worked in reverse way. And when i am typing with my keyboard it stop working for few moment.

Go to all settings and see carefully all and their tabs. I think it was a choice in \"universal access\" tabs same as \"stop mouse when i use keyboard\". I unchecked this before, but I forgot where it was. excuse me.\n", "Q: Failed Attempt to Dual-Boot Ubuntu 12.04 with Windows 7 This is my second time installing Ubuntu, and I haven't got much luck yet. (My first ruined Windows' MBR.)\nIt's been nearly a week since trying to install and reinstall Ubuntu so I can dual-boot it with my existing Windows 7 installation. I followed the steps about installing the OS from linuxbsdos.com, partitioning my lone HDD into 3, inserting the EasyBCD entry of Ubuntu to the MBR and all. Yet I still have my problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*When I load my Ubuntu entry (which is Grub2), all I get is the Grub4DOS command line. I'm not a computer technician and I have bleak info about command lines so it's hard for me to boot it from there.\n\n*When I load my Ubuntu entry (which is Grub Legacy or Wubi or any other entry than Grub2), all I get is a blinking cursor and that's where it ends. I need to restart my machine all over again.\nI'm starting my fifth(?) reinstallation of Ubuntu and I hope it's fine. But then, I'm not even sure, judging that all my previous installations failed.\nI have an Acer Aspire 4755G laptop, with an Intel i7-2670QM 2nd-gen processor, 4GB DDR3 RAM, 750GB HDD. I used a 64-bit version of Precise and my Win7 is also 64-bit. \nCan someone help me here?\n\nA: Paul, first of all, as an Ubuntu user and lover, I'm sorry for your failed attempts and frustration.\nBut, honestly.... that tutorial you followed is horrible, and doomed to failure. The approach it chooses is extremely complex and fragile.\nIf you're starting over for the 5th time, how about trying from scratch the default, sane, easy way? I assume you're trying the \"real\" Ubuntu, not the Wubi one, correct?\nFirst, clear that mess in Window's boot list, so that Windows boot list is the default one, using the MBR as it wants, with no Grub4DOS or anything, booting straight to Windows. Use the Windows install/recovery DVD for that. Done? Ok, So let's begin:\n1 - Boot from the Ubuntu Live CD (or USB key)\n2 - Install it normally. I assume you know about partitioning. If not, just ask. Or use the \"Install Along Windows\" option for auto-partitioning\n3 - Grub2 (the boot manager) goes to /dev/sda, the MBR of your boot drive, where it belongs. Do NOT install it in a partition (like /dev/sda1)\n4 - Reboot. You now will have both Windows and Ubuntu in grub2's boot menu. Choose either, and be happy ;)\n5 - If any Windows (or even other Linux) future install messes with grub, follow these instructions to restore grub\n", "Q: Ubuntu installed accidently on windows I'm new here and would very much appreciate your help\nI was making a bootable USB to rescue a crashed Ubuntu notebook.\nI was doing this on my Sony VIo laptop, now I can't access my Sony files, when I boot the Sony up it boots in Ubuntu\nI think I have overwritten the windows boot sector with Ubuntu\nI need to either undo the process or if this is not possible then at least recover my kids childhood memory photos\nAny help to resolve this issue would be very much appreciated\nP.s I have since removed the hardrive from the Sony and tried to read it on a windows machine as an external drive, windows can see the drive but with no data!\n\nA: since you're on Windows, you can try to recover the files by using a file recovery application such as Recuva from Piriform.\nI very much doubt that the files are totally gone though if you were only trying to make a bootable USB and you would have been offered the choice of whether to wipe your hard drive by the Ubuntu installer.\nTry booting a Live Linux CD such as Ubuntu which you already have. If you're not seeing files on your Sony hard drive don't panic, give Recuva a chance to recover all your files.\nLast resort is running your Sony recovery discs but at the expense of losing your precious files. Google some more and never forget to make back-ups. It's the golden rule of computing - make a backup-up of a back-up of a back-up.\nCheers!\n\nA: You may be able to mount the Windows partition from within Ubuntu if it hasn't been overwitten. This has no bearing on the MBR and can be done as follows:\nBoot the USB drive and select \"Try Ubuntu\". Open the icon to the Home folder at the left, and in the left pane of the windows which opens, select what you presume to be your Windows partiton. If it indeed is the Windows partition, it will contain (but not be limited to) these folders:\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows\n\n*Program Files\n\n\nand also either users or Documents and settings. Gi onto Users if it exists; if not, Documents and settings\nEnter the account under which the pictures were stored, and navigate to the correct directory. (This depends on where you put them). Now, mount your old Ubuntu partition in a new window(Ctrl+N), not called File System, but something like ### GB Filesystem, and enter the home directory. Then, go into your username, and copy from the old window to the new window via drag-and-drop, or Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V. You may also copy them onto a different flash drive, or use the CD burning tools to make a CD. Again, create backups regularly!\n", "Q: How to autostart or remotestart something and stop it another way in 12.04? I want to autostart the software motion with motion -s either at start up of my Ubuntu 12.04 and/or via ssh from a different PC. All this is no problem.\nMy question is, how do I correctly stop it locally or from remote when the terminal where motion has been started has already been closed? And how to correctly close this terminal once motion -s has been started?\n\nA: You should start the command from an instance of byobu.  With byobu, you can leave or join the session from the local or remote system to start or stop the process.  Also, if you connect via SSH and use byobu to run the command, the command will not be terminated when you disconnect since the byobu session will remain active on the local system.\nFor more on how to use byobu, check out the community docs here:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Byobu\n", "Q: Squid logs retention I have Ubuntu Server 12.04 LTS installed.

When I boot, the boot screen says Connecting to network, later it is changed to something like Did not connect, trying for another 60s. \nHowever, the network does not connect at the boot. But I can then log in without a network connection, and if I start a network manager service manually from the terminal with sudo service network-manager start, the network is connected without any problems.\nPlease, does anybody know where the problem could be? I don't want to wait more than two minutes every computer restart.\nI am new to Ubuntu (and also to upstart) so I am a bit lost. There is no /var/log/messages, in dmesg I found this record, though it may not be related:\ninit: network-interface (eth1) pre-start process (492) terminated with status 1\n\ninit: network-interface (eth1) post-stop process (548) terminated with status 1\n\n\nA: This is because your BIOS settings is enabled with Network boot option.\nEverytime it boots, it checks to see if there is a TFTP server sitting on the other side is giving image for network booting. This is not your case.\nSince you already have a Ubuntu running locally, please go to BIOS during boot and disable the network boot option. Then your problem is resolved.\nConcluding in a single line, just \"Disable network boot option in BIOS settings\".\n", "Q: How to figure if country repository is not updated I recently noticed that version of the Thunderbird is not same on my laptop and on my iMac. Thunderbird verson on my iMac was 13.x while on my laptop it was 15.x. It looked suspicious and I changed repository location on my iMac to point to the main repository instead of Maltese mirror. It turned out that 422 packages should be updated!\nIs there a way to make sure that mirror is updated?\n\nA: I don't think there is one; however, you can check this page to check when a given repository was last updated.\n", "Q: Is it possible to obtain a public share link with the original name of the file? I don't want to have public link for downloading and sharing which obfuscates the file name and file type like for example: http://ubuntuone.com/3y88jj4O7noyEngvCnxG88 (sample link, won't work). \nInstead, is it possible to obtain a link which shows the file name and file extension? \nExample: http://ubuntuone.com/name-of-my-file.mp3\nSo, how do I find the option that lets me share public links with the original name of the file?\n\nA: While Ubuntu One itself doesn't provide this service, there is a 3rd party site, called u1.to which can.\n", "Q: New install preserving home directory I have 32bit 11.10 installed on an LVM disk taking up all 500 GB, and I would like to install 64bit 12.04 on top, preserving the data in my home directory.\nI used to do that pre-LVM by just not formatting the partition mounted as /home, installing over / and /usr and formatting /tmp, But now it don't recognize the partition table. \nI've never had much luck with upgrade and so I just install afresh when I want a new version.\nSurely I can do what I want, can't I?\n\nA: You need to make a new install with formatting all partitions except home partition.\n", "Q: Will Xorg 1.13 land in ubuntu 12.10? I am asking this because there may be some Optimus Nvidia updates before next year April ubuntu release and i read somewhere its connected with 1.13 features? Or i am maybe wrong.\n\nA: Given that Quantal ships with Xorg 1.13 RC5 it is likely that it will ship the final X 1.13 version.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://packages.ubuntu.com/quantal/xserver-xorg-core - 2:1.12.99.905-0ubuntu3\n\n\nEven if it does not ship the final 1.13 (which is very unlikely), you won't have to worry about missing PRIME features as these are already merged with rc5.\nYou may also be interested in the tracker for hybrid graphic technologies like Optimus: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/desktop-q-hybrid-graphics\n\nA: This is the xorg package landing in 12.10 as of now.\nThe naming convention they use (1:7.7+1ubuntu3) appears to be different from the one you are using but maybe you can look though the change logs for the features you are waiting for.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Can I try latest Nautilus (3.5.4 now) in Lubuntu 12.04? http://www.iloveubuntu.net/redesigned-nautilus-landed-ubuntu-1210\nIs it only for Quantal?\n\nA: You can download the source files from Launchpad and compile it yourself.\nNautilus 3.5.4 requires gtk+3.5.5 but Ubuntu 12.04 still has 3.4.2, so you might have to wait a bit to try it, until 3.5.5 rolls out.\nAs you might know, nautilus 3.5.4 is not much different from the current version, so you're not missing much.\n", "Q: Can I make Nautilus look better in Lubuntu 12.04? I mean that PCManFM and Thunar follow my theme:\n\n\nNautilus does not:\n\nI have to add that I do not want to change my present theme. And I guess that is the problem, as it does not have a gtk3 folder included. \n\nA: *\n\n*Go to Preferences → Customize Look and Feel from the menu\n\n\n*Change the theme to Lubuntu-default in widget tab. It will make nautilus to look good and compatible with other Lubuntu apps\nResponse to latest updates of requirements by OP\nIf you don't want to change your theme, I fear it is not possible to workaround this. Because, nautilus version 3.0 or greater requires gtk-3 themes, which your currently active theme surely is not supporting.\nIf you really want to have nautilus to be compatible with the installed theme, I would suggest you to contact theme developer for a request to implement gtk-3 theme in this one. If you are good with css and javascript and feel interested, I think you may yourself try to implement the theme in gtk-3. See this themeing guide for help.\n\nA: Nautilus is gtk3. Thunar is gtk2. I don't know about the third. Ensure that the theme you use has a gtk-3.0 folder if you want Nautilus to be styled as well.\nYour theme may be in ~/.themes or in /usr/share/themes (which is where they're located in Ubuntu 12.04.)\nThe Ambiance theme, for example, is here: /usr/share/themes/Ambiance. Within are the following:\n\n[03:04 PM] /usr/share/themes/Ambiance $ ls\ngtk-2.0 gtk-3.0  index.theme  metacity-1 unity\n\nThe presence of the gtk-3.0 folder ensures that apps based on gtk3 will be styled correctly.\nEdit: I suspect that most software from GNOME will be gtk3. Other things like Chrome, Firefox, LibreOffice still are gtk2.\nAnyway, as the other answer also suggested:\nNautilus is gtk3: use a gtk3 theme if you want a gtk3 program to be themed.\n(In order to use a theme that does not have gtk3 support: a not very recommendable workaround is to copy the gtk3 folder from a theme that has it into the folder of the one that does not. In fact, in Lubuntu, one can extract and copy themes in home/username/.themes in order to install them, a location which does not require root privilege. But some applications like Synaptic Manager require a theme in usr/share/themes: see this question.)\n", "Q: How to check if a cdrom is in the tray remotely (via ssh)?

It did not automatically mount anywhere (which I'm thinking might just be a result of it being a headless server not running X, nautilus, or any of the other nice user friendly things).\nThere are two CD drives connected via SCSI:\naustin@austinvpn:/proc/scsi$ cat /proc/scsi/scsi\nAttached devices:\nHost: scsi0 Channel: 00 Id: 00 Lun: 00\n  Vendor: ATA      Model: WDC WD400EB-75CP Rev: 06.0\n  Type:   Direct-Access                    ANSI  SCSI revision: 05\nHost: scsi1 Channel: 00 Id: 00 Lun: 00\n  Vendor: Lite-On  Model: LTN486S 48x Max  Rev: YDS6\n  Type:   CD-ROM                           ANSI  SCSI revision: 05\nHost: scsi1 Channel: 00 Id: 01 Lun: 00\n  Vendor: SAMSUNG  Model: CD-R/RW SW-248F  Rev: R602\n  Type:   CD-ROM                           ANSI  SCSI revision: 05\n\nHowever when I try mounting either of these devices (and every other device that could possibly be the cd-drive), it says no medium found:\naustin@austinvpn:/proc/scsi$ sudo mount -t iso9660 /dev/scd1 /cdrom\nmount: no medium found on /dev/sr1\naustin@austinvpn:/proc/scsi$ sudo mount -t iso9660 /dev/scd0 /cdrom\nmount: no medium found on /dev/sr0\naustin@austinvpn:/proc/scsi$ sudo mount -t iso9660 /dev/cdrom /cdrom\nmount: no medium found on /dev/sr1\naustin@austinvpn:/proc/scsi$ sudo mount -t iso9660 /dev/cdrom1 /cdrom\nmount: no medium found on /dev/sr0\naustin@austinvpn:/proc/scsi$ sudo mount -t iso9660 /dev/cdrw /cdrom\nmount: no medium found on /dev/sr1\n\nHere are the contents of my /dev folder:\naustin@austinvpn:/proc/scsi$ ls /dev\nagpgart          loop6               ram6      tty10  tty38  tty8\naustinvpn        loop7               ram7      tty11  tty39  tty9\nblock            lp0                 ram8      tty12  tty4   ttyS0\nbsg              mapper              ram9      tty13  tty40  ttyS1\nbtrfs-control    mcelog              random    tty14  tty41  ttyS2\nbus              mem                 rfkill    tty15  tty42  ttyS3\ncdrom            net                 root      tty16  tty43  urandom\ncdrom1           network_latency     rtc       tty17  tty44  usbmon0\ncdrw             network_throughput  rtc0      tty18  tty45  usbmon1\nchar             null                scd0      tty19  tty46  usbmon2\nconsole          oldmem              scd1      tty2   tty47  usbmon3\ncore             parport0            sda       tty20  tty48  usbmon4\ncpu_dma_latency  pktcdvd             sda1      tty21  tty49  vcs\ndisk             port                sda2      tty22  tty5   vcs1\ndri              ppp                 sda5      tty23  tty50  vcs2\necryptfs         psaux               sg0       tty24  tty51  vcs3\nfb0              ptmx                sg1       tty25  tty52  vcs4\nfd               pts                 sg2       tty26  tty53  vcs5\nfull             ram0                shm       tty27  tty54  vcs6\nfuse             ram1                snapshot  tty28  tty55  vcs7\nhpet             ram10               snd       tty29  tty56  vcsa\ninput            ram11               sndstat   tty3   tty57  vcsa1\nkmsg             ram12               sr0       tty30  tty58  vcsa2\nlog              ram13               sr1       tty31  tty59  vcsa3\nloop0            ram14               stderr    tty32  tty6   vcsa4\nloop1            ram15               stdin     tty33  tty60  vcsa5\nloop2            ram2                stdout    tty34  tty61  vcsa6\nloop3            ram3                tty       tty35  tty62  vcsa7\nloop4            ram4                tty0      tty36  tty63  vga_arbiter\nloop5            ram5                tty1      tty37  tty7   zero\n\nAnd here is my fstab file:\naustin@austinvpn:/proc/scsi$ cat /etc/fstab\n# /etc/fstab: static file system information.\n#\n# Use 'blkid -o value -s UUID' to print the universally unique identifier\n# for a device; this may be used with UUID= as a more robust way to name\n# devices that works even if disks are added and removed.

I am using Ubuntu 12.04.\nAfter spending an hour or two working out how to find the Network icon, I find that when I reboot the machine, I have to go through the whole procedure again. \n\n\n*\n\n*The network menu is not there - so first I have to find the terminal. This has no particular location that I can find but usually I have to type terminal in the dash.\n\n*Then I have to type nm-applet in terminal\n\n*The network manager icon then appears, but works only if the terminal window remains open. Shut down the terminal window and the network disappears.\n\n\nThis is a pain - plus I have to type my password in every time, which is another waste of time, thought this has always been a problem.\nCan anyone tell me how to make the web automatically connect at startup without any intervention from me? \n\nA: Try installing network-manager-gnome and reboot. This should fix the issue.\nor\nYou can add the nm-applet to your startup (Open dash-> Startup Applications).\n\nA: This is strange, because that is not the common / default behavior on all Ubuntu systems I know, where the network manager applet starts automatically and automatically connects to any wireless networks known / present without asking for passwords it already knows.\nMy question is this: are you using a vanilla Ubuntu 12.04, or a variant (like Lubuntu, Xubuntu or Kubuntu)? Did you do any major configuration changes to your system? Do you login as the administrator user (the one which was set up during installation)? Maybe you have been updating an older system? Something is wrong here. Are you using a laptop? What make?\nIn any case, a half-fix for you is to put nm-applet in the startup applications. Press the Win key, type startup and select the \"startup applications\" icon. Then add nm-applet such that it is automatically started.\nAnother half-solution is that when you start the nm-applet from your terminal, do it like that:\nnm-applet &\n\nNow you can close your terminal without closing the nm-applet.\nHowever, that is not a real solution, because as I said, nm-applet should be started by default.\nOne way that I would test the problem would be to log in without any user-specific configurations, which normally reside in your home directory. Here is how I would do it, but proceed with caution and back up your data.\nAssume that your username is \"gandalf\".\nsudo -i # become root\nmv /home/gandalf /home/gandalf_backup\nmkdir /home/gandalf\nchown -R gandalf:gandalf /home/gandalf\n\nLog out, log in as gandalf again. You should have a virgin home directory now, with no configurations. If you still have the problem with nm-applet not starting, there is something wrong with the system (or, for example, your user rights). If the problem is now gone, then your user configuration files are at fault.\nTo restore your home directory, do\nsudo -i\nmv /home/gandalf /home/gandalf_virgin\nmv /home/gandalf_backup /home/gandalf\n\n", "Q: Bluetooth fix for Ubuntu 12.04, lenovo G580 Bluetooth not working, it shows turned on but manager indicated Bluetooth disabled.

I use Lubuntu 12.04 and a gtk2 theme, Elegant Arch. \nWith such a theme, gtk2 applications like Thunar will be themed, while others like Nautilus, would be not (see this question ant the images there).\nBecause I wanted to theme gtk3 applications like Nautilus, Audacious etc., I have copied the \"gtk-3\" folder from the main folder of a gtk3 theme into the main folder of my Elegant arch theme, which is in home/username/themes. Using the gtk3 folder from this full flat theme I got a pretty similar look in gtk2 and gtk 3 apps.\nLubuntu Desktop Center, Ubuntu Desktop Center, Network Options and other such apps are now themed (before they were not). Even Update Manager is.\n\nBut why is Synaptic Manager not themed?\n\n\nA: The application you are opening is one that needs root  privileges. You could also link the files to use them:\nsudo ln -s ~/.themes /root/.themes\nsudo ln -s ~/.icons /root/.icons\nsudo ln -s ~/.fonts /root/.fonts\n\n\nA: I'm using LXAppearance to change themes on i3wm. You have to open LXAppearance as root and apply a theme to change the theme of applications that run as root.\nThis will change that ugly Raleigh theme that the Synaptic Package Manager is using.\n\nA: It looks like Synaptic Manager is a gtk2 application. So, all this has nothing to do with theming gtk3 apps.\nBut in order to use a theme for Synaptic, that theme has to be put in /usr/share/themes.\nI figured where to put the theme by the fact that the lubuntu-default theme, which has gtk2+3 support and had themed Synaptic, was in /usr/share/themes, while Elegant Arch theme was in ~/.themes. Also, Synaptic uses gtk2: when I put Elegant Arch theme (with the gtk3 folder of the full flat theme inside) into /usr/share/themes, Synaptic takes the theming of Elegant Arch. \n", "Q: Change permission from -rwxrwxr-x to drwxrwxr-x I have a php file which is trying to read and write xml files on my Ubuntu server, however the problem is that it does not have permission to do this (permission denied error).\nI have tried the following chown www-data read_write.php with no luck\nWhat is the proper way to change permission for this file?\nmore info\n-rwxrwxr-x 1 www-data www-data 14092 Sep  6 12:33 read_write.php\n\nA: The script must be allowed to write in the directory in which it tries to create the files. So for example, if the script tries to write a file into the directory /var/srv/www/script_output/, do\nchown www-data:www-data /var/srv/www/script_output/\nchmod 771 /var/srv/www/script_output\n\nMake sure that you do not give permissions for writing in the directory that the script resides in (otherwise, an attacker hijacking the script would be able to overwrite the script itself). Also, files in that directory should not be permitted to be run (as PHP or whatever).\nBy the way, the d in drwxrwxr-x only means that the given node is a directory.\n", "Q: Deploying non-linux ISO on MAAS Server I have installed MAAS server on Ubuntu 12.04.\nNow I want to know that whether it is possible to \ndeploy non-linux ISO images on MAAS server.\nAs Ubuntu Images are working; we can make it useful for \nnon-tux people.\n\nA: Probably you want non-linux virtual machines on top of OpenStack.\nRemember MAAS handles the hardware and is a Ubuntu solution.

However, after running sudo ./install I still get: \nPreparing installation files ...\nInstalling ...\n./install: 1: eval: /tmp/mathworks_4880/sys/java/jre/glnxa64/jre/bin/java: Permission denied\nFinished\n\nHow is this possible? :)\n\nA: i had the same problem with Matlab 2014a, i tried to change permissions of the\n    sys/java/jre/glnxa64/jre/bin/java\n\nbut it wouldn't i still don't know the reason why, so i took the whole sys/java/jre/glnxa64/jre directory and copied it to my Desktop where i changed the permissions to\n    chmod 777 /home/$USER/Desktop/jre/bin/java\n\nand i started the installation with\n    sudo bash ./install -javadir '/home/$USER/Desktop/jre'\n\nand it worked perfectly\n\nA: Even at your 64bit system, the installation might as well work out coz i have just successfully installed Matlab2012a in mine... here's what i did.. :\n1.in the /matlab-install-files/sys/java/jre/glnx86/jre/bin/java ,i did\n sudo chmod +x ./java\n\n2.within the installation directory:\n sudo chmod +x ./install\n\n3.finally, install by:\n ./install \n\nor\n sudo ./install\n\n\nA: Installing Matlab (which is 32-bit) on 64-bit Ubuntu causes this problem.\nYou can try this command and proceed like normal again.\nln -s YOURMATLABFOLDER/sys/java/jre/glnx86 YOURMATLABFOLDER/sys/java/jre/glnxa64\n\n\nA: I did the following on my 64-bit Ubuntu and it worked.\nchmod +x <MATLAB_DIRECTORY>/sys/java/jre/glnx86/jre/bin/java\n\n<MATLAB_DIRECTORY> is the directory where you have all the MATLAB installation files in.\nThen, in the install script (<MATLAB_DIRECTORY>/install), change line 441 from\nJRE_LOC=\n\nto\nJRE_LOC=\"<MATLAB_DIRECTORY>/sys/java/jre/glnx86/jre/\"\n\nAnd then run ./install in the <MATLAB_DIRECTORY>\n\nA: I tried every solution in here and couldn't install 32-Bit Matlab on 64-bit Linux.\nThen I tried this:\n\nIn order to install 32-bit MATLAB on a 64-bit Linux machine, it is\n  necessary to use the -glnx86 flag:\n./install -glnx86\nThe -glnx86 flag is required for starting MATLAB. If you are running a\n  license manager, it is required for all license manager scripts as\n  well (lmstart, lmdown, lmstat, etc...).\nSome users have problems loading the JRE when running in this\n  configuration. Creating a symlink in $MATLAB/sys/java/jre named\n  'glnxa64' pointing to 'glnx86' should resolve this issue. You can do\n  this with the following command:\nln -s $MATLAB/sys/java/jre/glnx86 $MATLAB/sys/java/jre/glnxa64\n(where $MATLAB is the MATLAB installation folder) `\n\n\nA: I've found the answer, no matter how weird it is. The problem was 64bit OS. When I tried with 32bit, Matlab installation worked and every other app I had previously trouble installing. So now I stick to 32bit.\n\nA: You may try this for the 64 bit version if doing chmod on java file doesn't work:\n-Make a tmp directory in your home directory\n-now run install using \"./install -tmpdir <path to the above made tmp directory>\"\n\n\nA: In many cases, the file system on which the install disk is mounted, is such that the file's permission cannot be changed to +x. In such cases, open the install script, go to somewhere around line which does echo Installing.... and eval $java_cmd. Just put a read between these two lines. Then, in another tab, go to /tmp/mathworks_<some-4-digit-random-number>/sys/java/jre/glnxa64/jre/bin/ and do chmod +x java. Then in the previous tab, press enter.\n\nA: I assumed the appropriate symbolic link is, instead, something like \nln -s MATLABLOCATION/sys/java/jre/glnxa64 MATLABLOCATION/sys/java/jre/glnx86\nIf you want to link the missing x86 JRE folder with the existant x64 of your install location.\n\nA: There's also a file called install_unix which you have to apply the chmod +x trick to. Can't remember which folder it's in, but it'll be clear straight away as it's not in a subfolder.\nAlso, when you're selecting which components to install, there's a reason the licence manager is automatically not selected. Please leave it unselected - it'll just cause trouble.\nMake sure the installation folder is correct, as this can't really be changed otherwise. I had to move it for administrative reasons, but eventually gave up trying and just reinstalled (though that might have cost my University some money).\nAnother thing that might help is to take the option to install scripts (something like that) so that there's a file you run to actually start MATLAB. You can make do without this option, but then every time you start you'll have to directly access a critical program file, which might be a little bit dangerous. Don't worry about the folder where these scripts are installed, as you can make copies and wherever they are, when run they'll link to the MATLAB root folder.\nOnce you've installed, it might help to change the startup directory by right clicking in the directory bar and selecting preferences. The startup directory should be where you want to keep MATLAB-related files you made yourself, like scripts and functions & maybe results from running them/other data. It might be really dangerous to use the MATLAB root folder for this sort of thing.\nIt's not necessary to alter the install_info file as the installation options are determined using a dialog box interface.\nYou might like to install a desktop shortcut to access MATLAB without opening a terminal. For this, the terminal needs to be operated in bash mode. I got the shortcut installed, but I don't think I understand how so I'll leave you to work that out/look it up.\n\nA: Extract the ISO files instead of Mount and then make the following files executable after ensuring they've got the read-write permission:\n\n\n*\n\n*install\n\n*/home/amb/I/sys/java/jre/glnxa64/jre/bin (all files inside it)\n\n*bin/glnxa64/install_unix\nthen execute ./install\n", "Q: The noip2 (no-ip.com) package was deleted from the repository, now what?

The reason is that when I drag a file out of Nautilus into my text editor, I almost always close it after reading some snippet for about 3 seconds. But when I press Ctrl+W to close my file, Nautilus wants to be the application in focus, so it takes the keystroke and closes the Nautilus window. \nIt would actually be better for Nautilus to release focus to the drop target when a file is dragged out--or even better, never take focus at all, just be visible but not a focusable window. But this seems like it would be difficult to accomplish, so I'd be happy with a way to turn off Ctrl+W. Does anyone know of a way?\n\nA: No, you can't do that. Keystrokes will go to whichever window has focus. The easiest thing to do is simply click once on the text editor after drag & dropping your file to it. That will give the window focus.\n\nA: You can disable the CTRL + W shortcut in Nautilus by adding the following line to ~/.config/nautilus/accels and then rebooting:\n(gtk_accel_path \"<Actions>/ShellActions/Close\" \"\")\n\nThis sets the keyboard shortcut (accelerator) for the close action to nothing instead of the default of \"<Primary>w\".\n", "Q: Is it possible to have Windows 7 installer files and Ubuntu installer files on the same bootable USB drive?

Try right clicking on the file and add the execution permission to the file, but generally you can get everything from a PPA or Apt-Get.\n", "Q: KVM guest disk performance My KVM guest does max. 200MB/s although the host does easily > 700MB/s (Raid 0 with 4 SSDs).\nConfiguration: File-based storage (raw), cache none.\nHost 24 cores, 96GB ram, Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS and virt-manager.\nI suspect the CPU to be the bottleneck (one core goes up during hdparm).\nAnyone experienced the same or has an explanation ?\nEdit: one more info: guest is the same as host (Ubuntu 12).

I/O is complex and isn't direct as many think. It functions as a writeback system and is heavily dependent on how much ram you have, the width of your memory buses, and how swappiness is tuned among a host of other tunables. There's no silver bullet or \"flat rate\" solution, it usually isn't the obvious symptom. Things like linux-perf and systemtap can help diagnose where the bottleneck is and identify the root cause. Good luck.\n\nA: I started using write-back as cache mode and then at least peaks reach the 700mb/s.\nAs write-back is not as safe as cache mode none I enabled filesystem (ext3) barriers in the Linux VMs as safety measure.\nOn Windows however the guest blue-screens which is not that important yet.\n", "Q: 12.04 disabling wireless via dbus does not work I am using a proprietary rt3652sta driver for my wireless card.

It worked fine, dual booted with Windows 7 and all.  I tried installing several applications and got errors.  After searching for a little while for a fix, I found that someone else had solved the problem by uninstalling the 32-bit version and installing 64-bit Ubuntu.\nApparently there is no wubi.exe installer for the 64-bit version, so I used LinuxLive to put the iso file onto a USB drive.  I changed my the boot order in BIOS to check the USB first.  It did, and I got into the Ubuntu installer just fine.\nEverything was working fine, but then I got an error that GRUB could not be installed. I chose \"install manually later\" or something like that.  Immediately, the installer said it was done and ready for a reboot.  At this point, my USB is still in the computer.  The computer reboots...and it's back at the installer for the USB.  I look up what's going on here, and someone says in a thread they solved it by selecting \"Try Ubuntu\" then installing it via a shortcut on the desktop.  I assumed that Ubuntu simply hadn't installed and it would be safe to try again, so I did.  It finished installing, this time I chose a different partition that wasn't being used.  The thread also said to reinstall grub to the mounted drive, so I did that.\nNext I took out my USB and rebooted.  I get stuck on the GRUB GNU loader, v.1.99 or something I believe it says at the top.  I can't do anything, and it doesn't detect Windows 7 OR Ubuntu.  When I check partitions, I have two 43 GB partitions that both have the same files in them (I'm assuming those are the two Ubuntu installations), and can only run Ubuntu off of my USB-- and can't run Windows 7 at all, however from within Ubuntu the windows 7 filesystem and files can still be seen.\nI have no idea what to do now.  I used Ubuntu in the past (9.xx) and never had these sorts of problems!  Please help.  And sorry for the wall of text.\n\nA: To be clear lets recap what you did.\n\n\n*\n\n*You installed Ubuntu via WUBI\n\n*You installed Ubuntu in separate partition twice.\n\n*The second thing installed GRUB2 and interfered with WUBI install\nand now you have a unbootable system\n\n\nWe will try to uninstall all the Ubuntu installations and keep Windows. Then we will install Ubuntu again properly.\nFirst, undo GRUB and fix MBR so that Windows can boot again.\n\n\n*\n\n*Follow the first part of How to remove Ubuntu and put Windows back on? to remove GRUB and put fixMBR. in particular, boot from Windows 7 rescue CD and open the Command Prompt and type:  \nbootrec /fixmbr\nbootrec /fixboot\nbootrec /rebuildBcd\n\n*Take the CD out and reboot.\nThis should boot your Windows 7.\nSecond, Uninstall WUBI installation of Ubuntu. At this point WUBI installation is not bootable and there may not be an easy way to recover any data files you put in there. by uninstalling Ubuntu via WUBI, we will recover the lost disk space.\nWhile in Windows 7, go to \"Control Panel > Programs and Features\" and scroll down to Ubuntu and uninstall. If all goes well, Wubi Ubuntu will be gone forever.\nThird, Delete all the previous Ubuntu partitions.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from the Ubuntu live USB and choose \"Try Ubuntu.\"\n\n*Search for the program Gparted and run it. Delete all the ext4 and\nswap partitions. Do not create any new partitions, Ubuntu\ninstallation will find the unused space and create them again. make\nsure you are not deleting any ntfs (Windows) partitions. Click\n\"Apply.\" Exit Gparted.\n\n\nFourth, Install Ubuntu\n\n\n*\n\n*Now click \"Install Ubuntu\" icon while running Ubuntu from the Live\nUSB. It should recognize the presence of Windows 7 and offer to install Ubuntu in the unused space. If not abort installation and ask a question here again.\n\n\nI hope this works for you, but I can't guarantee success.

Look for the language version of mp4 which you would prefer. There are blocks like:\n\"HTTP_MP4_EQ_1\":{\"quality\":\"MD - 400p\",\"width\":720,\"height\":406,\"mediaType\":\"mp4\",\"mimeType\":\"video/mp4\",\"bitrate\":1500,\"url\":\"http://artestras.vo.llnwd.net/v2/am/HBBTV/053366-002-A_EQ_2_VF-STF_01749068_MP4-1500_AMM-HBBTV.mp4\",\"videoFormat\":\"HBBTV\",\"versionProg\":\"1\",\"versionCode\":\"VF-STF\",\"versionLibelle\":\"VF\",\"versionShortLibelle\":\"VF\",\"VQU\":\"EQ\"},\n\nThey are all written on one line, so copy-pasting to a text editor helps.

Looking at /etc/X11/xorg.conf, I found that two things needed to be changed:\nOption         \"Composite\" \"Disable\"\n\nto\nOption         \"Composite\" \"Disable\"\n\nand\nOption         \"TwinView\" \"0\"\n\nto\nOption         \"TwinView\" \"1\"\n\nApparently, switching to Xinerama disables composite, but switching back from it doesn't re-enable it. Also, TwinView was for some reason marked as disabled, though I did see two monitors. I hope this helps anyone else who runs into this problem.\n", "Q: Dual Screen with 12.04 ATI randr extension is not present Here's my problem\nI have two screens.

You have interference from same or close channels. If you are able to,you need to change the frequency of your access point (computer).\nYou are currently at 2.427 GHz. That equals channel 4. Here is a reference link to the channel allocations. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WLAN_channels\nTry moving to the highest channel authorized for your country and see if you get improvement. Then, if necessary, move down the list until you do get improvement. If you are in an apartment, you may have much interference and may never get a full specification performing connection but hopefully you can get a connection that won't disconnect.\nWorst case, you may have to get off 2.4 Ghz or go to a cable connection.\nGood luck.\n", "Q: Hard time installing Ubuntu I have a MSI GT780DXR that currently is booting windows 7. I've been trying to dual boot windows 7 and ubuntu for some time now.\nHere's specs that I think would make a difference\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows 7\n\n*500GB*2 RAID 0 hard drives. (Hardware RAID I'm not sure if it's a dedicated RAID card though) 7200RPM\n\n*Nvidia GT570M\n\n\nBackground:\nI tried to install 12.04 (64 bit) a few times but the Desktop live cd and pendrive boots with a black screen. I've tried wubi but it boots to a black screen as well. I then tried the alternative 12.04 (64 bit) and went through the installation all the way til partitioning. I let Ubuntu notice the raid setup and I setup my swap, /, and home drives, I used my free space to create the three partitions. I tried to resize the windows drive and it told me I couldn't and to be happy with my current setup. When I finally got past I got an error on installing GRUB 2 and decided to skip it and continued on to finish installation. When I tried to boot up I got an invalid partition table error. Windows recovery disc, and a GPARTED live cd couldn't find any hard drives. I ended up following advice and typed this into the recovery command prompt.\n\n\n*\n\n*bootrec /fixmbr\n\n*bootrec /fixboot\n\n*bootrec /rebuildBcd\n\n\nIt worked and here I am now. The question is, how would I be able to dual boot windows 7 and Ubuntu 12.04 with this information?\nThanks,\n\nA: I don't know for sure why GRUB failed to install on your hard-drive, but it may happen in some cases if there's not enough space between the MBR and the first partition. GRUB2 usually requires a little bit more than 30KiB but sometimes it needs more. This is especially true in RAID installations.\nAssuming Windows resides on the first partition at the beginning of the disk, I suggest you move your Windows partition about 64K to the right and I believe that GRUB will be able to install on your MBR. \nFrom the information above I'm unable to tell what is the reason for your partition table being corrupted, but it could be related.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Suddenly my display turns grey!

The key merely modifies the scancodes of other keys, so pressing Fn+Right would emulate an End key, even though it may not physically exist, but they are indistinguishable by the OS. This behaviour is controlled exclusively by the keyboard electronics and can therefore not be altered without messing with the circuitry or microcontroller.\nyou could assign the f1 key as a shortcut to the required control that FN+F1 usually gives you, but you would lose your help key as a result\nAs far as the special keys are concerned, you would have to confirm what type of keyboard, the OS is seeing yours as.  It may be an international with extended keys so that the OS sees the extra keys. What model of viao are you using?\n", "Q: How to fix: Ubuntu 12.04 reboots after loading with elilo I have an HP p6-2120 with\n CPU: AMD A6-3620 APU with Radeon Graphics\n  RAM: 6GB\n  BIOS: HO2_710.ROM v7.10 [AMI v7.10 4/19/2012]\n  Disk: SATA1 (/dev/sda) - 1 TB (windows)\n  Disk: SATA2 (/dev/sdb) - 1 TB partitioned using \"parted -a optimal /dev/sdb\" as follows:\n..    1049KB 201MB FAT32 boot flag set\n..    201MB 60GB ext2 (/)\n..    68GB 78GB linux-swap(v1) (swap)\n..    78GB 790GB ext4 (/home)\n..    - rest is \"free\" space reserved for other purposes (eventually)\n\n  ubuntu: 12.04.1 LTS [specifically: Release 12.04 (precise) 64-bit]\n  kernel: linux 3.2.0-29-generic \n\nI created a bootable EFI USB from the ISO (64-bit) which I downloaded. I can run and install from the USB without any problems.\nThe BIOS is an EFI bios that appears to be capable of booting in either EFI or Legacy mode. \nInitially, I did the \"standard\" install with NOTHING on disk2, and let the installer configure everything. The net result of this was that when I started the computer and forced it into \"boot\" menu mode, it DOES NOT recognize SATA2 as an EFI drive, and when I attempt to \"legacy\" boot from it, I get the message \"ERROR: No Boot Disk has been detected.\" The \"standard\" install created one large partition that consumed the entire disk.\n\nAt that point, I manually partitioned the disk (using sudo parted -a optimal /dev/sdb) as described above. I selected the \"other\" install, and changed the /dev/sdb1 to \"bios_grub\", /dev/sdb2 as \"/\" (ext4), /dev/sdb3 as swap, and /dev/sdb4 as \"/home\". [Note: fearing that possibly elilo did not recognize ext4, I switched /dev/sdb2 to ext2 and re-insalled]\n\nThe net result was that the install appeared to trash the /dev/sdb1 partition so that it was NOT readable by anything.\n\nI re-formated /dev/sdb1 as FAT32 and set the boot flag. I repeated the install ignoring the messages about no bios_grub partition.\n\nAfter several attempts to get GRUB2 to work, I switched to elilo. I downloaded the most recent version and copied it (elilo-3.14-ia64.efi) to /dev/sdb1/efi/boot/bootx64.efi. (The BIOS boot loader did not recognize it either as elilo-3.14.ia64.efi or as elilo.efi. Based on the advice in one of the web-pages I found, I renamed it to bootx64.efi. This worked.)\n\nIn that same directory (/efi/boot), I copied the file pointed to the link in /dev/sdb2/vmlinuz to /efi/boot/vmlinuz, and the file pointed to the link in /dev/sdb2/initrd.img to /efi/boot/initrd.img. I created an elilo.conf file as follows:\ntimeout=5000\nprompt\ndefault=linux-boot\nimage=vmlinuz\n  label=linux-boot\n  read-only\n  initrd=initrd.img\n  root=/dev/sdb2\n\nThe /efi/boot directory contains 4 files:\nbootx64.efi\nelilo.conf\nvmlinuz\ninitrd.img\n\nWhen I power-cycle the computer and force the boot menu, drive2 shows up as an EFI bootable drive. When I select it, I get the elilo prompt. Pressing , it appears to load the kernal (I have tried it with verbose=5, and there is a long string of messages with the final one a command line to load the kernel and a series of several dots that fly by) then the screen goes blank, and it reboots the computer. [Note: I have also tried substituting the UUID as found in the /etc/fstab of the installed system for the root directory. This had no effect.]\n\nThis is a brief synopsis of several nights of fiddling with this. I would deeply appreciate any help you can give.\n\nA: I have been asking everyone I know what the problem may be\n\nA friend - a sys admin - pointed out that even though I have been booting the install from an EFI disk, the ubuntu installer does not appear to have detected that and wants to install as a Legacy style device.\n\nHe suggested re-initializing the disk to MBR (rather than GPT), and trying the install that way.\n\nI reinitialized /dev/sdb as an MBR disk\nI booted the install disk with and EFI loader and did a standard install (keep windows, install Ubuntu, nothing special). It installed and worked fine!\n\nConclusion: Even if you have an EFI system, if the Ubuntu installer wants to install in Legacy mode, oblige it!\n", "Q: Using Ubuntu-x-swat PPA solved my problem. Can I be sure the commands I ran are safe? \nPossible Duplicate:\nCan I trust in X/SWAT PPA? \n\nAre these commands safe?\nI was getting logged out by Ubuntu, and these commands saved me:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\n\nA: It depends what you mean by safe, but in general, there is no problem with this.  You have added an extra source of packages (a PPA) where packages and updates which have not (yet) been released to the general public are hosted.  In this case, the package are related to the graphical environment and your graphics card.  (I also used this PPA to try solve some problems with my graphics card.)\nThe key here is that this is a fairly well-known/trusted PPA.  In theory, someone could host a PPA and put malicious code in it, but he would usually be called out pretty quickly for it on a public forum like this.\nThere is also some slight risk, in that there is a higher risk of bugs in code that is still in a PPA, rather than released in the mainstream package repositories, because it might not have been tested as thoroughly yet, and less users will have been using it to discover other bugs or problems with it.\n", "Q: Can I buy any USB microphone and have it work with Ubuntu?

eclipse.\nIt will reset your Eclipse setting, once start switch the workspace to your workspace and import your project/s again\n\nA: Try to execute this command in a terminal. Then start eclipse.\nThe command:\nrm -r ~/.eclipse\n\n\nA: I think you are facing the same problem as me. It turned out that the default workspace had some problem. If I delete the default workspace (/home/<name>/workspace) and then start eclipse then everything works fine. Therefore I changed the default workspace to somewhere else and it worked like a charm.\nIn eclipse, go to\nFile > switch workspaces and create another workspace somewhere... Window > Preferences > General > Startup and Shutdown > Workspace then in the Recent workspaces window, remove your default workspace and apply your newly created workspace\nHope this helps\n", "Q: Can't install packages using apt-get install or Software Center I installed recently in my personal computer 12.04.\nWhen a try to install some software (Dropbox or Chromium per example) from the Ubuntu software Center or when I try to install some package using the terminal (sudo apt-get install guake for example), I find an issue.

When running in Gnome Fallback mode (Gnome Classic) in Ubuntu 12.04, I added the Main Menu to the bottom panel, but I have a problem with the customization of its colors. It is like the old Gnome 2 menu that combined Applications and Places into one.\nBy default with the Ambiance theme, the menu's background is white when it should match the background of the panel itself. When using the Applications/Places menu that is enabled by default, it has the proper background matching the panel as it should.\nIs it possible to customize the Main Menu's background color in Gnome Fallback or is the setting not there?\n\nA: Hold Alt + Super/Win key, and right click on the Gnome panel. Then choose Properties from the menu, to customize the colour!\n", "Q: How to share wired Internet through ad-hoc Wi-Fi connection via a laptop? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to share a wired internet connection via Wifi? \n\nIs there a way I can share my wired Internet connection through my ad-hoc Wi-Fi connection, like I could do in Windows with Connectify?\nI am using Ubuntu Studio 12.04.\n\nA: There are many ways...\n\n\n*\n\n*Network Manger Method (See the second answer)\n\n*IP Table Method (See the first answer)\n\n*FireStarter Method (Using a firewall to redirect Internet)\n\n\nA: Yes, you can.

If I do this sort of command say:\ncp file1 file2\n\nThe shell creates a child process and that child process will call cp, which in turn call exec system call of operating system. \nAre there any command to visualize this process from my terminal? \n\nA: strace will show system calls made by a process. It won't give you an instruction-by-instruction view of what happens, but it will give the calls into the kernel performed.\n\nA: Just like strace traces the system calls, you can use ltrace to trace library calls. \n", "Q: running Unity 2d in Xubuntu 12.04 I'm trying to run Unity 2d in xubuntu, I installed the packages but when I try to run it I get \n\n[FATAL] Settings schema 'com.canonical.Unity' is not installed\n\nHow can I get it to run? I'd like to install as little stuff as possible.\n\nA: I think unfortunately you will have to install more dependencies, and the one you are missing is gnome-session, without which unity 2d can't run, and you get the error message you received. This is actually detailed at Launchpad; installing unity 2d manually from Synaptic does not automatically pull in the correct dependencies. \nRunning an apt-cache rdepends unity-2d proves this:\nunity-2d\nReverse Depends:\n  unity-2d-dbg\n  unity-2d-common\n  libunity9\n  unity-2d-dbg\n  unity-2d-common\n  ubuntu-desktop\n  libunity9\n  gnome-session\n |gnome-session\n\nIf you don't want absolutely everything that gnome-session includes, you could try installing it with the --no-install-recommends flag and this will install just the essential elements needed for unity-2d.\nRun in terminal\nsudo apt-get install gnome-session --no-install-recommends\n\nIt should not be necessary to install the ubuntu-desktop package as well, but keep that in mind if all else fails.\nUsing unity-2d should now be possible and it should be a login option at the Xubuntu screen and if you have any visual defects in it is also worth installing the following, according to this Launchpad report.\nsudo apt-get install light-themes ubuntu-mono ubuntu-wallpapers-precise gnome-themes-standard\n\nAs the two bug reports at Launchpad have proven, you do need to install a fair amount of things to run unity-2d on Xubuntu.\n\nA: Check out your dependencies, when I saw this in the past I used dpkg to list them and it turns out some of the dependencies were wrong and somehow unity-2d-places and unity-2d-spread were not installed.\n\nA: I think you should install ubuntu-desktop package if you want to be sure to have all packages for unity:\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\n\n", "Q: Problem accessing second hard disk with Squeezebox server I have recently re-purposed my old desktop PC as a 'server' running Ubuntu LTS 12.04. I want to use the machine as my primary squeezebox server in place of my HTPC MacMini (to reduce the strain on the MacMini). I managed to install squeezebox server without to much difficulty and added Music folder of my 'Home' folder to the library - all good and it worked fine.\nI then realised that the disk was almost completely full and decided to install a second drive in the machine and move the music to that so that the primary drive could be used for other things. I installed a 1.5TB drive in the machine and formatted it as one partition with ext4 using Ubuntu's 'Disk Utility' app. \nI then moved all my music to a 'Music' folder on the new drive using nautilus. The problem is that I cannot add the new drive/folder in the LMS web settings.\nThe old music folder was located at: /home//Music (This can be found fine by clicking browse in LMS web settings)\nWhen I go to the settings page at 'Basic Settings','Media Folders' and click browse, I cannot find the new drive - it is not showing up.\nThe new drive is located at: /media/mediadisk\nI can access the new drive without any problems using nautilus, or by navigating through the terminal, but if I use the 'browse' feature from within LMS web settings the folder cannot be found.

It makes things more fun too, because of the Pythonic approach.\n\nA: Consider using an outside MySQL, like xeround\nConsider using XML, it can be a poor mans dB.\nIf you REALLY need mysql.  Then you can make mysql-server a dependency for your app.  But that's not a good idea... It will require you setting up mysql on install of your app.  That can get tricky.\nA trick for setting up the database once you install mysql, is to go to phpmyadmin, and \"export\" your db.  Choose sql export.  Then open the file it downloads.  It will be a massive sql command.  Copy-paste than into your program, and once you get the needed info from the user (mysql username/password), you can execute that export, and then their database will look identical to the one you created on your local machine.\nThough again, I typically recommend against using mysql-server on local machines unless its REALLY needed.\n\nA: @triunenature suggested using an external (hosted) database like Xeround. I should note that this would introduce very high latency, but it could be acceptable if the application does not query the database intensively, or if perhaps you can do things in an asynchronous manner with some sort of local cache to hold the data until needed by the application. Certainly it would get around the pain of embedding the database with the application. Just in case this is a relevant scenario, I wanted to mention that Xeround has shut down, but there are several alternatives, both for MySQL (ClearDB) and other popular databases - since you are considering other options - such as Postgres (Heroku Postgres), Redis (Redis Cloud), and MongoDB (Mongolab).\n", "Q: How to correctly set permisions for all subfolders and files I am following the guide to install TinyOS on Ubuntu 12.04\nI have done up to step 3, But I am not sure if I have done the step 3 correctly.

I'm obviously missing something basic. good tutorial anywhere?\n\nA: locate /9.jpg\n\nNote the / - without it you'll just find every file ending in 9.jpg. Technically though, it searches for file paths with it as a substring on all of the drives, which includes 9.jpg.png, so this works better with files that have file extensions - a file named log using /log will show you every file in /var/log/.\n\nA: The search in nautilus (the file manager thingy) is, by design, limited to a simple wildcard-like option. If you need something more sophisticated, you can either go for the GUI or the command line.\nGUI: install the package gnome-search-tool, either through the software center or by typing \n sudo apt-get install gnome-search-tool\n\nRun it (it is called \"search for files\"). Leave the main entry empty, and add a search option called \"Name matches regular expression\". In the new text field, type ^9.jpg (the ^ at the beginning matches the beginning of a string in a regular expression).\n\nAs for command line, the find utility will give you the precise answer:\n find . -name '9.jpg'\n\nConsider this: files \"999.jpg\" and \"9.jpg\" in the directory t/:\n$ ls t\n99.jpg  9.jpg\n$ find . -name '9.jpg'\n./t/9.jpg\n$ find . -name '*9.jpg'\n./t/99.jpg\n./t/9.jpg\n$\n\nI hope that this is clear.\n\nA: \nHow do you search for an EXACT file name WITHOUT wildcards?\n\nTo search an exact file without wildcard use find command.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal by Pressing Ctrl+Alt+T\n\n*Type the command and hit Enter\nfind / -name 9.jpg\n\nIf you want to search in your home folder only, use ~/ instead of / and so on.

When your computer checks the associated dns server for its own name the server no longer has it. Some DHCP servers may avoid problems by writing the assignments they have made to their disk or flash memory so nothing is lost when they restart.\n\nThe server may ordinarily take your computername from your systems DHCP request, make it computername.local and store that in its records, making it available in its associated DNS server simultaneously. Usually hostname -fqdn requests the full domain name over your network from your DNS server and if it has the record it will return that name. The .local suffix makes it look like a valid fully qualified domain name (though it isn't really a valid global domain name). This is why you may not have to specify a domain name manually in /etc/hosts or /etc/hostname files.\n\nThe DHCP server restarting may cause further problems as IP addresses may be assigned to multiple computers simultaneously, causing some not to be able to communicate. The address is assigned once before the server restarts, and again after it does.\nIf your DHCP server forgets its assignments the safe thing to do is to reconnect each computer it serves when it restarts. When I lost mine I simply disconnected and reconnected to my wifi access point. On a wired network you can use ifdown and ifup or simply disconnect and reconnect the network cable.\nWhen reconnecting my system automatically uses dhclient to get a new address--my computer and the server now agree on who I am, and the message no longer appears.\nIf you wait long enough the DHCP lease will timeout and your system will ask for and get a new lease from the server--clearing up the problem. This will probably be hours or days later (for my server it is one day).\nIf you have defined a static IP name and address and if the DNS reverse look-up records are correct the problem shouldn't happen.\n\nA: I ran into this error this morning, and it turned out that the hostname was misspelled in /etc/hostname.  Correcting this so it agreed with the hostname spelling in /etc/hosts cleared up the problem.  The hostname -b -F /etc/hostname command that runs at boot time apparently cannot complete unless /etc/hostname and /etc/hosts agree.\n\nA: Editing of /etc/hosts did the trick. The file /etc/hostname was correct with containing only server.exmaple.com\nBut the hosts was not correct\n127.0.0.1 localhost\n127.0.0.1 server\n\nI changed it to this:\n127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain  localhost\n192.168.xxx.xxx  server.example.com   server\n\nthen I ran hostname -f (short for hostname --fqdn) and got the following.\nserver.example.com\n\n\nA: Solution:\n(These types of problems don't have good solutions.

I am new to Linux. I have tried tried many Linux distro but none of them work on motherboard with Intel 82845g/gl graphics card. The only version that worked out of the box was Ubuntu 8.04.4 LTS. None of the latest release works on my dreaded PC. \nHow can I install i810 driver in 12.04?\nUbuntu developers please support old computers. What should I do with this old PC?\n\nA: Unfortunately, the hardware you use falls into the category of \"abandoned by the vendor\". i8xx chips have been causing xserver lockups for years, with Intel unable or unwilling to provide fixes. There is a good overview of the predicament in the i8xx unsupported wiki. I wish there had been a solution, but it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever bother fixing it. As far as I know, none of the modern desktop distos will work with Intel's i810. You could try using it as a server with no X, or get a supported PCI graphics card.\nThere seems to be a vicious pattern with some of Intel's hardware. First, it works reasonably well, then, as the Linux kernel evolves, and regressions creep in, things start breaking, and Intel guys either completely ignore the problems, or disable the features that caused them (like hardware acceleration).\n\nA: All last versions of Xubuntu works as fast as the famous WindowsXP does this.

I also dont mind to have just ubuntu on my system.\nPlease any one can provide step by step procedure for that.\n\nA: So what you have to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run Ubuntu from LiveCD (make sure in the BIOS boot order, the CD drive comes before the hard drive)\n\n*If your LiveCD doesn't come with Gparted preinstalled, try to install it by entering sudo apt-get install gparted into a terminal. If that fails, use fdisk. Here are tutuorials:\n\n*With what ever tool runs from your LiveCD, partition your hard drive to have a Linux ext3/4 partition, a windows ntfs partition and a linux swap partition. Here is a tutorial for Gparted and fdisk\n\n*Shutdown, insert Windows 7 install DVD and  install Windows 7 with it (make sure Windows 7 uses the NTFS partition and does not override the others)\n\n*Install Ubuntu from LiveCD and this time make sure (in the extended install options) that the mountpoint for / is your Linux partition.\n\n*You're done.

I have NOT enabled hibernation as I don't use it but wonder if that has an influence or not.\nAny ideas? Is the missing icon-policy the problem? Will it help if I enable hibernation?

If I use Nautilus to open the .deb file, it runs it in either gdebi or Ubuntu Software Center (I've experimented with both). \nOddly, no matter what I've done I can't seem to get Firefox to believe that debs should not be opened by gedit. See below from my mimeapps.list. Also, there are no references to my .deb files in /usr/share/applications/defaults.list\n\n\n\n\nA: I had this behaviour with Firefox too. It was opening PDFs, .DOCs, .DOCXs, etc with Gedit. Very annoying. Didn't matter than the Applications list in Firefox specified LibreOffice, Evince, etc., as the preferred application UNLESS I clicked on the 'Show All Downloads' link at the bottom of the downloads menu (in the firefox taskbar).\nTo fix this, I opened .local/share/applications/mimeapps.list and removed the association of application/octet-stream with gedit.desktop. Doing that restored the normal/expected behaviour.\nThis clearly highlights a bug in Firefox, which is that it sometimes uses its applications list, but not always (as of version 35.0.1 on Ubuntu 12.04).\n\nA: Firefox also has its own application list. Check Preferences->Applications, then find the Debian files. It probably says \"Always ask\" next to it if you haven't changed anything. If you click on \"Always ask\" you can select \"Use other\" and pick the Ubuntu software center or Synaptic or whatever you'd like it to be (though unfortunately you will have to use the file finder to actually get to the application file, which can be a slight annoyance). The Ubuntu Software Center is in /usr/bin/software-center and gdebi can be found in /usr/bin/gdebi-gtk. \n\nA: There are default programs xdg-open and gnome-open which automatically select appropriate tool for a file. \nI managed to find out that its enough to change association for unknown type and everything works fine. \nSolution \nThis is everything you need BEGIN\nsed 's#.*octet-stream.*#application/octet-stream=gnome-open.desktop#' ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list -i\n\nEND\nI have got to this conclusion by using find, ubuntu-tweak- inotifywatch\n\nA: This occurs because some packages break your mime-type-application bindings.\nI got the same and removed the list file in my home directory but that will only last until you update the software again that is causing this.\nTo fix the issue, you need to set the apps for the mime-type accordingly.\nThe settings in /usr/share/applications/defaults.list should be correct.\nYou will notice that these \".desktop\" files are located in /usr/share/applications/; you can use any in there and even create your own, with root privileges.\n\nA: To add to SMeznaric's top post: I checked the Firefox preferences and both deb entries were already ubuntu software center. A workaround was to change the default option to 'save file', since at least this works. Clicking them in the downloads folder in Thunar works as normal and you have a copy in a logical place (rather than /tmp/mozilla-firefox0)\n\nA: I had this problem, along with Firefox's Preferences->Applications window being totally blank.\nDid the following:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge firefox\nsudo apt-get install firefox\n\nIt fixed both issues (for now, I'll check back in if it recurs) and all of my settings and plugins are still intact.\n", "Q: Is it possible to use 12.04 live CD to repartition hard drive? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to I remove windows but keep Ubuntu? \n\nI have a dual boot system Vista and Ubuntu. I upgraded to 12.04 and ran out of hard drive partition space for Ubuntu.\nI a willing to blow away the Vista partition and the Acer recovery partition to make more space for Ubuntu since I never use the Vista and don't care about the recovery to Vista.\nCan I use the 12.04 live CD to repartition the hard drive and save my current 12.04 installation?\n\nA: That depends on the Filesystem you installed your linux on. Try to boot gparted and check if it shows you the possibility to resize this partition after you removed the VISTA / Recovery Partition. \nBut be careful. It is always possible that sth. bad happens. So make backup before you start. Make sure your batteries are loaded and the lappy is switched to a plug.\nA Backup is possible with many tools. But this also depends on your filesystem you chose. And you will need an USB drive with the same size (or half the size - depending on your tool)\n\nA: Without touching the existing Ubuntu installation, you can make room by adding a new partition, say /backup, using the space that you earn by deleting Vista and Recovery partitions. You can do it within your existing Ubuntu. \nYou can then move your some of your old data on to this new partition and make more available space in your root partition or to home area, if you have separate /home partition.\n\nA: Yes, definitely.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into 12.04 LiveCD and run GParted.\n\n*If you really don't need the Vista partition, you can just delete it to gain unallocated space. Then format that unallocated space into ext4 (default filesystem for Ubuntu installation) or whichever filesystem you have on the Ubuntu partition you want to resize.\n\n*You can then select your Ubuntu partition from the GParted window and click on the Resize button (looks like a right arrow key) and drag the partition's right border to increase your Ubuntu partition.\n\n*Click on Apply (the check mark).\nWarning: Resizing partitions may result to lost data.\nFor more information, check the following tutorials on resizing partitions with GParted:\nHow to Resize Partition?\nHow to Resize a Partition using Gparted on Linux?\n", "Q: Is it possible to monitor notifications? I would like to programmatically monitor the notifications that get displayed in Ubuntu (in order to perform different actions based on the content of the notifications). I do not see a feature that offers this sort of ability documented anywhere in notify-osd. Can anyone recommend a method for accomplishing this?\n\nA: In theory at least, you can find all notifications in the file\n$HOME/.cache/notify-osd.log\n\nHowever, I no longer find that file in 12.04.\nThere is an applet called \"recent notifications\", and you can install it by adding a PPA repository:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:jconti/recent-notifications\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install indicator-notifications\n\nMaybe that will help.\n", "Q: Do all my files, Office, and Outlook transition when I install Ubuntu? When I install Ubuntu, do I keep access to all my Windows Vista files (Word, Excel, etc.) and documents (photos, etc.), and do I keep all my Outlook data (history, address list, etc)?\n\nA: It depends on how you install Ubuntu. If you format your hard drive and then install Ubuntu, nothing will remain of your Windows installation. \nHowever, if you install Ubuntu alongside Windows, then you will be able to access all of your files (such as photos and videos) from Ubuntu.\nThis doesn't necessarily mean that you'll be able to open all of your documents, however! LibreOffice (or OpenOffice, depending on which one you prefer) can open most (if not all) files made with Microsoft Office. One should still always test out opening their documents in LibreOffice before completely deleting Windows and Office, just to be safe.\nAs to Outlook, the answer is that, though it is not done automatically, it is possible to import your settings and mail from Outlook, into Ubuntu's mail client, named Thunderbird. For instructions on how to do so, read the article mentionned in the following paragraph.\nI highly recommend that you read this WikiHow article for detailed steps that will help to get you up and running with Ubuntu. It explains in a very detailed fashion how to make the jump from Windows to Ubuntu. It deals with Office and Outlook alternatives and how to set them up, and also mentions a ton of other software you may end up finding useful.\n\nA: If you choose to install Ubuntu alongside Windows, then you can access your files on the Windows partition from Ubuntu, but you will not be able to read the files stored on the Linux partitions from Windows (at least not without installing drivers). However, you may set up an NTFS partition for sharing files between the operating systems, as this avoids messing up the Windows system files and preventing it from booting (never happened to me, but I read it was better to do this).\nCreating a partition for sharing data between Ubuntu and Windows\nWhat I did, in first place, was to back-up my personal files (My Documents, Pictures, etc) on an external hard drive.\nThen, I used the Ubuntu installation wizard to install it alongside Windows, and let it do the partitioning. Then, from Windows, I used EaseUS Partition Master to create an additional NTFS partition for storing data (I labelled it Data). I shrank the Windows one to make space for it. Then, I logged into Windows, went to my personal folder, and right-clicked My Documents. On the dialog, in the Location tab, I chose a folder on the newly created partition (I chose E:\\Users\\MyUserName\\Documents, where E is the drive letter for the Data partition). Then, Windows moved all the files to the new location. I did this with the other folders, such as Pictures, Videos, Music, Downloads, etc. They could be then accessed from the start menu or the personal folder as if nothing had changed.\nReboot, and from Ubuntu, follow this tutorial (link) to automatically mount your data partition on start-up. Reboot. A hard-drive icon should appear on the Launcher, indicating that the partition is mounted (mine shows a tooltip saying \"Data\" when hovering it).\nFrom Ubuntu, I opened my home folder with Nautilus (the default file manager) and deleted the Documents, Pictures, Videos, Music and Downloads folders (they were empty).\nThen, from the terminal, I created symbolic links to the folders on the data partition:\nln -s -T /media/Data/Users/MyUserName/Documents/ ~/Documents\n\nAnd similarly for the other folders. Now they appear as if they were in the home folder, but they are actually stored on another partition.\nImporting Outlook contacts and mails\nUbuntu 12.04 comes with Thunderbird installed, so if you want to keep your contacts and mails, you will have to export them from Windows and then import them with the Thunderbird wizard in Ubuntu (Tools > Import...).\nBoot Windows, open Outlook and export the contacts and mails, and save the files (.csv for the contacts) somewhere in the Data partition (for example in E:\\Documents\\Outlook_export\\ , where E is the drive letter for the Data partition). Then reboot and select Ubuntu, and import those files from Thunderbird, from ~/Documents/Outlook_export/ .\nHope this helps :)\n", "Q: mount.ntfs takes 90% of CPU I installed Ubuntu 12.04 on my Samsung NC10 laptop with 2 GB RAM using WUBI.\nWhen I try to install something or to do something with files, the mount.ntfs takes 90% of CPU. Also I have an issue that Ubuntu uses all 2GB of RAM (1GB immediately after start and usage increases).\nWhat can I do with this issue?\n\nA: I have the same problem, just did the same. Apparently even though on the ubuntu website Wubi is quite promoted as \"click and play\" - it's quite problematic. Some of the problems are due to the ntfs-3g driver which is, well, buggy. They have a commercial version of the driver (you know, $$) which works better. \nTo sum up, you'd need to install Ubuntu on a separate drive, with no ntfs partitions on it.\n", "Q: Depends libntfs10 error while installing testdisk I want to install testdisk to ubuntu 10.04 LTS but i'm getting an error.

Is there something else that whould make it better?\n\nA: Wubi is an Ubuntu installer for Windows that lets you install and uninstall Ubuntu from a Windows desktop. Wubi adds an entry to the Windows boot menu which allows you to run Linux. Ubuntu is installed within a file in the Windows file system (a loopmounted partition), this file is seen by Ubuntu as a real hard disk. That way the hard drive does not have to be repartitioned before the Ubuntu installation. The resulting Ubuntu installation is a \"real\" Linux system, not just a virtual machine. Wubi makes it easy for Linux newbies to play around with Ubuntu.\nBut if you have less than 5 GB space then you can defragment disk for more space optimization ..increase access speed by rearranging files stored on a disk to occupy contiguous storage locations\nthis is my personal opinion  \n", "Q: How do I install Ubuntu with LILO?

The following is a slightly modified extract from an excellent article named A Brief History of the 'rm' and 'rmdir' commands.\n\n\nA new version of rm, dated January 20, 1973, included these options:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*rm -f: don't ask before removing read-only files\n  \n*rm -r: recursively remove subdirectories\n  \n  \n  The way the rm -r option was implemented at that time, when rm encountered a directory among the files it was removing, it would cd (then called chdir) to that directory and start another instance of rm -r * to remove its contents.\nA version which did the recursion within a single rm process appeared in the Seventh Edition of Unix in 1979.\n\n\nMore about the history of rm can be found by following the link above.\n", "Q: Pastie is broken for Ubuntu 11.04 I had pastie working for the longest time on Ubuntu 11.04, working great, I love the little bugger :) I still have it working on my laptop (same system).\nRecently I ran upgrade on all packages in my Ubuntu 11 system.

By looking through the code I found that Pastie uses a clipboard history file in XML, the code for this is in the main Pastie file and protector.py.\nRunning a find in my home directory I found that Pastie stores this history file in ~/.local/share/pastie, it's called clipboard_history.\nBasically something that was copied in the past had a character that Python didn't like or wasn't escaped right by the software code. So it was choking on that line of XML in the history file.\nSo just go to that directory and erase the file completely and restart pastie, works like a charm.

That is because while the echo command is run as sudo, the >> for append tries to open the file target as a non-sudo user.  That is where the permission issue is.\nHowever, please read my multi-part answer, which gives you a separate solution that can be considered more 'safe' than the others I provide:\n1:\nUse a separate file in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ which contains the deb instruction you're saying now.  You'd still need to use sudo, though, to edit / create the file.\n\n2:\nA solution would be to do sudo su -c \"echo 'deb http://www.duinsoft.nl/pkg debs all' >> /etc/apt/sources.list\", which tells the system to run that as superuser, which you get access to by using 'sudo' in front of the 'su' command.\nPLEASE NOTE that the su command used outside of the command I stated here is dangerous, so you should only use this method if you absolutely need it. Therefore, consider using Solution #3 here instead.\n\nSafest Solution (#3):  Use echo | sudo tee AND a separate .list\nYou can achieve the same as the above, however, without ever dropping to a superuser prompt though.  With this command:\necho 'deb http://www.duinsoft.nl/pkg debs all' | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nHowever, let's also take into account #1 above, and instead use a new file for it:\nsudo touch /etc/apt/sources.list.d/duinsoft.list\necho 'deb http://www.duinsoft.nl/pkg debs all' | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/duinsoft.list\n\nThis way, we leave the main sources.list alone, but the sources will be added via an included file that specifically handles this repository.  (This is how PPAs get added, by the way!)\n\nA: What this command does is appending deb http://www.duinsoft.nl/pkg debs all to /etc/apt/sources.list. Let's do it in an other method! Just open that file and append it manually!\nsudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nThen add deb http://www.duinsoft.nl/pkg debs all to end of it and press Ctrl+O and then Enter to save the changes and finally Ctrl+X to quit nano.\nYou can jump to the next command now...\n\nA: What happens with the command is that echo is run as root, but not >>. Try the following instead:\necho 'deb http://www.duinsoft.nl/pkg debs all' | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nalternatively, you could do it in two steps:\nsudo -i\n\necho 'deb http://www.duinsoft.nl/pkg debs all' >> /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nexit\n\n\nA: Create a script myscript.sh containing\n#!/bin/bash\necho 'deb http://www.duinsoft.nl/pkg debs all' >> /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nexecute it with (you have to give execute permission to it first e.g. chmod u+x myscript.sh)\nsudo ./myscript.sh\n\n", "Q: How can I disable USB autosuspend for a specific device? This is related to the issue discussed in Wireless mouse temporarily freezes (sleeps) on battery power.\nSummary: the mouse freezes when operating on battery since it is autosuspended after a certain time and needs more time to wake up.\nDisabling USB autosuspend for the mouse's receiver in PowerTOP is a temporary solution, but it does not survive a reboot.\nHow can I permanently disable the USB autosuspend for only one specific device?\nA solution that does not involve installing additional packages is preferred (after all, I want to disable something), but it is not required. Removing PowerTOP (which seems to be a solution for some) is not what I want - I like PowerTOP...\nAnd installing laptop-mode-tools to disable USB autosuspend altogether is not what I want, either, thus the new question.\nAlso: Will this affect the battery of my notebook? The Logitech unifying receiver for the mouse stays connected all the time, so if that prevents the autosuspend from happening for all devices that would probably be bad.\n\nA: In /etc/laptop-mode/conf.d/usb-autosuspend.conf you will find:\n# Enable USB autosuspend feature?\n# Set to 0 to disable\nCONTROL_USB_AUTOSUSPEND=\"auto\"\n\nYou should change it to CONTROL_USB_AUTOSUSPEND=\"0\".\nThis will automatically make any USB device have the value \"on\" in /sys/bus/usb/devices/\"DEVICE ID\"/power/control. This will make the value of the autosuspend files inactive:\n$ cat /sys/bus/usb/devices/\"DEVICE ID\"/power/autosuspend\n2\n$ cat /sys/bus/usb/devices/\"DEVICE ID\"/power/autosuspend_delay_ms\n2000\n\n\nA: The power options for a USB device are in /sys/bus/usb/devices/n-n/power. Unfortunately, what n-n is for a given device takes some sleuthing to find out, so I think this will prove a stumbling block when it comes to having a script that automatically does\necho -1 > /sys/bus/usb/devices/3-2/power/autosuspend\n\nto turn off autosuspend on that device. The magic n-n does actually appear in the output of\nudevadm info --export-db\n\nso I think udev will be your friend here; some kind of udev script keyed on a parameter that identifies your mouse, then runs a script that echos -1 into the relevant file.\n\nA: I created my own udev rule:\nACTION==\"add\", ATTR{idVendor}==\"0cf3\", ATTR{idProduct}==\"3004\", RUN=\"/bin/sh -c 'echo 0 >/sys/\\$devpath/authorized'\"\n\n\nA: Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial Xerus)\nsudo apt install tlp\nsudo lsusb\n\nFind the USB device's input id - it should look like 1234:5678.\nEdit the file sudo vi /etc/default/tlp and add your device's input ID to USB_BLACKLIST by adding the following line with your device's input id like so:\nUSB_BLACKLIST=\"1234:5678\"\n\nUbuntu 14.04 (Trusty Tahr)\nAs mentioned here at hecticgeek.com, the trick consists of two parts:\nUsing lsusb to ascertain the device IDs of the USB devices you wish to disable autosuspend for.\nAnd then adding them to AUTOSUSPEND_USBID_BLACKLIST in the /etc/laptop-mode/conf.d/runtime-pm.conf (usb-autosuspend.conf until Ubuntu 14.04) configuration file (details are well documented in there as well).\n\nA: In Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial Xerus), I found a solution in /etc/laptop-mode/conf.d/runtime-pm.conf:\n# Auto-Suspend timeout in seconds\n# Number of seconds after which the USB devices should suspend\nAUTOSUSPEND_TIMEOUT=1800\n\nIt was originally set for 2 for me. 30 minutes is far more reasonable.\nAfter the change, do:\nsudo service laptop-mode restart\n\nI am still not sure how to fully disable it, but this is fine for me now.\n\nA: I had a similar problem with PCs on an Avocent KVM, where laptop-mode-tools was not installed (and didn't want to solve it that way in any case). In my case, autosuspending the KVM made the keyboard and mouse behave erratically (after a few seconds idle, they'd suspend and lose input data for a while until enough clicks and shakes woke them up).\nWhen I ran PowerTOP and toggled USB autosuspend off for the Avocent, PowerTOP told me the command to disable it from the command line was:\necho 'on' > '/sys/bus/usb/devices/3-10/power/control'\n\nThe '3-10' bit will be different on different systems. I'm not sure how to determine that other than running PowerTOP, but there's probably some way.\nInstead, I used a udev rule to match the product id of my device:\ntrent+14.04:/etc/udev/rules.d$ cat 10-usb-avocent-kvm-pm.rules\nACTION==\"add\", SUBSYSTEM==\"usb\", ATTRS{idVendor}==\"0624\", ATTR{idProduct}==\"0013\", ATTR{product}==\"SC Secure KVM\", TEST==\"power/control\", ATTR{power/control}:=\"on\"\n\nTo get the proper udev information I ran:\nudevadm info -a --path /sys/bus/usb/devices/N-N\n\n", "Q: How to get rid of the background gradient of the inline GtkToolbar?

On my HDD I have an Ubuntu 11.04 installation with a separate /home partition that uses encryption. My data currently lives there.\nI just got a new SSD and installed Ubuntu 12.04 on it. What I'm trying to do is use the Ubuntu 12.04 install as the system drive, but store all my data on the Ubuntu 11.04 /home partition. In the new 12.04 install, I did include a /home folder for storing system configuration and programs, but I would like to be able to mount the /home partition from the 11.04 install to store all my data. \nI am able to mount the encrypted /home partition from 11.04 but it isn't a very seamless process, as you need to be root to edit access it once it's mounted in /media. Is there any way to mount/automount and \"login\" to the /home data partition and basically use the partition seamlessly in the 12.04 install?\n\nA: Its not really a problem of whether you can do it, it is a problem of how far you are willing to compromise your encryption.\nFrom any system you can mount any encrypted partition, as you have found. But to do this you must have credentials (the password or key to decrypt it). If you want a system to be able to automatically mount something that is encrypted then you must give it the keys to that encryption, and in this case the most straightforward solutions (and probably the only solutions, were you to opt for automount) would be to store your password in plain-text and have it accessed as a part of boot. The reason for this is that when you login your system must be able to read some home/ for you somewhere before you can manually provide credentials unless they are stored somewhere vulnerable outside the encrypted partition.\nIn any case, this point is moot. Sharing /home between two major versions is a bad idea -- your dotfiles are not going to be interpreted the same way between two major releases and some setting is either going to get corrupted or just not work at all the way you expect (or not work at all).\nI suggest that instead of sharing /home itself, you might want to have a third partition that contains things like documents/, videos/, pictures/, bin/, and whatever other application data you actually use yourself, and leave the dotfiles, settings, browser history, etc. separated. An easyish way to accomplish this is to just replace the default user data directories with symlinks that point to your mount location. So, for example:\nsda1  -> mounted at / for 11.04\nsda2  -> mounted at / 12.04\nsda3  -> encrypted, mounted at /home/you/mnt/ under both\n\nsda3 will contain your user data, so when you mount it you will get\n/home/you/mnt/documents\n/home/you/mnt/pictures\n/home/you/mnt/videos\n/home/you/mnt/music\n/home/you/mnt/bin\n# ...etc\n\nYour original directories will be replaced by symlinks of the form:\n/home/you/documents -> /home/you/mnt/documents\n/home/you/pictures  -> /home/you/mnt/pictures\n# ...etc.\n\nMounting sda3 will always require providing extra credentials the first time you access anything within it, but this only has to occur the first time when it is mounted. Placing the mount location in /etc/auto.master explicitly under each system should cause a LUKS password prompt the first time you access data -- but the right way to do this might require some research (I've only done this on RHEL and Gentoo, and have no idea what the differences may be in Ubuntu).\nIn any case, the effect you are trying to achieve is certainly a reasonable goal, but shortcutting by directly sharing an encrypted home directory between major versions is far less secure and ultimately a lot more trouble than its worth.\n", "Q: How to configure a Minimal Ubuntu installation?

I thought that maybe it would get some extra life out of the computer, but it was so slow that I removed the WUBI and gave up.  If I make a partition and install a regular version of Ubuntu to that partition will this give me the result I'm looking for, or is a slow computer just a slow computer!  I'm sure it is obvious, but I'm new to linux and not exactly a computer export.\n\nA: A slow PC is a slow PC but certain problems can make it slower.  Bad RAM will cause read-write errors and lost blocks that will slow down the PC.  A failing hard disk will cause a slow PC as it tries repeatedly to read bad blocks.  A clogged or otherwise faulty fan can cause overheating, which will cause the computer to run good when first booted but slower as the CPU heats ups, then an eventual crash as it overheats and quits working completely.\nWubi uses Windows file-systems so any problems with the Windows system will affect Ubuntu-Wubi as well.  The best test would be to run Ubuntu from a LiveCD or LiveUSB, if it runs faster than Windows it will run even faster from it's own partition. (A LiveUSB will give you a better idea as it will read faster than a CD)  Keep in mind that a LiveCD or LiveUSB will still be slower than a full install but will run regardless of a corrupted Windows filesystem or bad hard drive.\nYou can download Ubuntu here. The directions for making a LiveUSB using Windows is here, to burn a CD using Windows here\n\nYou can also use your LiveCD/USB to check you computer to see if you have any problems with your RAM or hard drive. \nTo Check the Memory:\nBoot   inot the LiveCD/USB and then press the F6 when you see the first purple screen. On the menu that pops up select English. You will then be presented with another menu, select Test Memory and then do at least the first test(I belive it takes about 10-15 minutes).  This should alert you to any RAM issues.\nTo check the hard disk boot into the LiveCD and select Try Ubuntu, after boot press your Windows key and type disk utility in the window that pops up.  Open the program by clicking on the icon. In the upper right of the window will be a indicator that will tell you if the disk is healthy(on the screenshot it is under my mouse pointer:\n\nYou can run tests to check the disk by clicking the Smart Data button..(if the disk is shown as healthy you should be OK but if you want to check anyway)....\n\nIn the above screenshot, you would click on the Run Self Test This will cause the hard disk to run it's self diagnostics and will show you the results....the test is long, if I remember right it took most of an hour.\n\nThe short answer to your question would be that if you don't have any underlaying computer problems, a full install of Ubuntu will likely run better and faster than XP and will give you some extra life out of your computer(My old XP computer ran MUCH better on Ubuntu than XP).  However, if you have underlaying computer issues(most of which can be checked with the instructions above), no OS will give you satisfactory results.\nSorry for the long answer, I kept it as brief as I could and still give you needed information.  Good Luck and welcome to Ubuntu, the water is fine... \n", "Q: Start command doesn't return for upstart script in Ubuntu? I have written an upstart script called 'ts.conf' for a daemon and put it in /etc/init. When I try to start it with \n\nstart ts\n\nI expect a confirmation message and I also expect to get the prompt back, but the terminal hangs. When I hit ctrl-c I get the prompt back. If I start again a message says \n\nstart: Job is already running: ts \n\nThe server is, however, not running, and I can find the mono process using 'ps -ef'.\nThe script 'ts.conf' is located in /etc/init and looks like this:\nstart on runlevel [2345]\nstop on runlevel [016]\nrespawn\nexpect fork\nscript\n  cd /home/ubuntu/Terraria\n  /usr/bin/mono /home/ubuntu/Terraria/TerrariaServer.exe -worldpath /home/ubuntu/Terraria -world world1.wld \nend script\n\nThe server starts fine if I run the command manually from the command prompt. Can anybody see what is wrong with my upstart script, or understand why nothing seems to happen? \n\nPlease not that the text above is WRONG when it says that I can find the process with ps -ef. I CAN NOT find the process using ps.\n\nA: You likely have multiple problems here:\n1) expect fork. Script section keeps waiting for a fork to happen and hangs waiting for it.\n2) Server not coming up. Upstart script section is run as root, and lacks all of the environment. You say it works if you paste it on command line, that is because you are not root and you have environment.\nIf mono is expected to fork for real, then fixing 2 fixes also 1.

Or is there any other mediaplayer which can cope better?\nSystem is Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.\n\nA: I think the best thing to do is to use mplayer or smplayer (assuming you have the restricted extras installed as Damien mentioned.) \nYou can use mplayer direct from the terminal, but for it to work you must use the -playlist option so it knows to check the local .ram file for the url and connect to it.\nmplayer -playlist /location/of/ram.file\n\nThen the cache will fill (it takes a few moments) and the output will be:\nAO: [pulse] 16000Hz 1ch s16le (2 bytes per sample)\nVideo: no video\nStarting playback...\nA:  28.6 (28.5) of 1550.0 (25:50.0)  0.3% 19% \n\nIf you want to use a gui, smplayer would be the best option. Just load it up and open the .ram file and it will play automatically without any problems in the current version as in the screenshot below.\n\n\nA: .ram files are small text files containing a link to a audio stream. When clicked a web browser downloads the .ram  and launches the user's media player.The player reads the files and the stream starts playing. \n.ram files are part of the  Realaudio proprietary audio format.\nYou can  install RealPlayer, however, RealPlayer has been criticized in the past for containing adware and spyware and also has premium versions .\nAn alternative may be mplayer as it should play real player codecs.\nwhich brings us to SMPlayer which is  a complete front-end for MPlayer and should play your .ram \nBefore installing SMplayer be sure to have ubuntu-restricted-extras  activated\n", "Q: Firefox starts in small window Ever since the installation of 12.4, Firefox only starts in a small window.

Or will there be missing drivers and/or any other problems?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: The short answer is Yes.  Once you install Ubuntu on the external USB drive, it will be like running it from an internal drive, providing you don't install any proprietary drivers.  And since its has a USB connection, you can use it on any computer that can boot from USB. Also keep in mind that it might be a little slow.\n\nA: But you may experience problems while installing drivers. It will work best until and unless you don't install drivers.

I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 with python 2.7.3 and PyGObject and I'd like to develop plugins for Gedit in python. I found a simple looking tutorial for this sort of thing here.\nAccording to the tutorial, I need the Gedit module to interact with the plugin interface:\nfrom gi.repository import GObject, Gedit\n\nI keep getting an import error when trying to import the Gedit module. So, my question is: what package do I need to install to get this module?\nI've tried: gedit-dev , gedit-plugins\nEdit: Here is the full traceback for the above statement:\nERROR:root:Could not find any typelib for Gedit\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nImportError: cannot import name Gedit\n\n\nA: I get the same error as you if I run the plugin code directly without Gedit.\nAs it is described in the manual you linked, you need to make a .plugin file for your plugin code.\nPlace your plugin code and the .plugin file into  ~/.local/share/gedit/plugins. \nRestart Gedit.\nOpen Gedit > Edit > Preferences > Plugins and look for your plugin.\nSet the checkmark for your plugin.\nYour plugin shoud run now using the Gedit code.\nTo check for errors in your plugin, start gedit from a console.  \n\nA: To answer your question, the typelib you need for developing gedit plugins is contained in the gedit package itself.\n$ apt-file search Gedit-3.0.typelib\ngedit: /usr/lib/gedit/girepository-1.0/Gedit-3.0.typelib\n\nBut when using python either interactively or from a script, from gi.repository import Gedit searches /usr/lib/girepository-1.0/ rather than /usr/lib/gedit/girepository-1.0. That is the cause of the import error.\nYou'll need to create the appropriate .plugin and .py files in ~/.local/share/gedit/plugins and run your code by selecting the plugin in the gedit preferences dialog.\n\nA: An import error for Gedit may indicate that GtkSource-3.0.typelib is missing or not installed correctly.\nTypical symptoms are in addition that you can't load several plugins (not only the one you develop yourself), and that you get warnings when starting gedit from the command line (seen on Ubuntu 13.10 Saucy). You can fix this by installing the missing package:\nsudo apt-get install gir1.2-gtksource-3.0\n\nSee also: Warnings while launching gedit from the Ubuntu terminal\nAlso note that the plugins for GEdit v3 use python3 instead of version 2.7.x of Python.\n", "Q: How to go back to previous line of a script in terminal? I am trying to write a script but I'm stuck here.

I mean there was a mistype, I did in touch august $i+$2. Ipressed ENTER key, so I went for new line. How can I get back to previous line?\n\nA: After you pressed Enter and got an error message, you can just go back in history:\nJust press the ↑ key in your keyboard to fix the typo. If you press ↑ key the terminal will show you this line:\nfor i in {1..100..4}; do echo \"august\"; touch august $i+$2; mkdir;\n\nCorrect the mistyped stuff around touch august $i+$2 and add a  done at the end of the command. \nThen hit the Enter key. This should solve your problem.\n\nA: bash's command-line editor doesn't support this, either do as anwar suggests or keep everything on one line separated by semicolons or put it into a script file.\nOn a side note, zsh has features that help with this. The zsh line editor (zle) is a more fully featured editor and supports moving within a multi-line command. When the command becomes too long to handle in zle it has a builtin feature, edit-command-line, which opens up the command-line in your favorite editor. It's usually not bound, try with:\nbindkey \"^[e\" edit-command-line\n\nAlt-e should now activate it, save and quit to go back to the command-line.\n\nA: as explained here, in bash you have Commands for Manipulating the History as stated in it's manual. One of them is edit-and-execute-command.\nThis will open your editor with your commands already typed in a temporary file and you can correct previous lines easily. You can achieve this in emacs mode by C-xC-e, and vi mode by pressing v in normal mode.\n\nedit-and-execute-command (C-xC-e)\nInvoke an editor on the current command line, and execute the result as shell commands.  Bash attempts to invoke $VISUAL, $EDITOR,\n  and emacs as the editor, in that order.\n\n\nA: This is what worked for me.\nCTRL + C from the current command.  Then press the ↑. Now you can edit whichever line you want by moving around with the arrow buttons - ← ↑ → or ↓.\nGood Luck...\n", "Q: How to setup Ubuntu as a backup server for my Windows computer? I took my old computer (AMD 5600+, 2GB RAM, 880gt, 250GB SATA, etc) and decided to jump and try Ubuntu for the first time.  I have very very  little knowledge (Red Hat when I was younger) with Linux in general.\nMy main desktop is Windows 7 and my plan is to use the Ubuntu computer as a file server sort of speak.  I want to be able to setup back up schedules from my Windows PC to the Ubuntu PC (plan on leaving this on 24/7 to double as a Seedbox)\nHow do I go on to doing this?\n\nA: You want to install and configure Samba. I will assume you are using Ubuntu Server 12.04. If you have a desktop installed there may be all kinds of GUI configuration tools you can use but let's keep this simple.\nThis should install Samba if you don't already have it:\nsudo apt-get install samba\n\nNow you should have the file /etc/samba/smb.conf so edit this and add these lines to the end:\n[backup]\npath = /home/username/backup\nbrowsable =yes\nwritable = yes\nguest ok = yes\nread only = no\n\nNow read the new configuration by running this command:\nsudo service smbd reload\n\nFinally, make sure /home/username/backup exists and is readable and writeable by everyone:\nmkdir /home/username/backup\nchmod a+rwx /home/username/backup\n\nYou should now have a working share. If the IP address of your server is 192.168.0.2 you could visit \\\\192.168.0.2\\backup from Explorer and see the directory and read and write files.\nNote that there is no security here. Anyone on your LAN can access your files. But this should get you started.\n\nA: I have never tried anything like that but maybe you can download samba from the Ubuntu Software Center in Ubuntu of course and configure it to share a folder, in which the backup would be located. Then download a backup software for Windows 7 and set it to backup on the folder you shared on Ubuntu.\nI'm not sure if this is what you were asking for or even if it will work but you could give it a try I guess.\n", "Q: 12.04 home encrypted and I have written down encryption passphrase. How to reset login password? I set up a friend with 12.04 and he forgot his password. I encrypted his home directory and I have written down the encryption passphrase during the first boot. If he changed his password after I wrote down the encryption passphrase during the first boot is this original encryption passphrase of any use? What should I do to reset or recover his password and keep everything accessible and functionally intact with the encrypted home directory?\n\nA: The passphrase for encrypting the drive is not affected by the user password, it is merely encrypted by the user password. If you change his password, the new encryption should be applied to the passphrase, meaning that the passphrase will still be the same, but the encrypted version of the passphrase will be different. The drive is not re-encrypted by changing your password, only when you change your passphrase.\nFor assistance with changing his password, look here\n", "Q: How to a deb package without Quickly?

Users are listed in /etc/passwd while groups are listed in /etc/group. For your user, you can use the id command. You can then set the umask-like options to set file permissions.\nHere is an example of using them in /etc/fstab:\nUUID=<xxxxx> /media/win ntfs rw,auto,nls=utf8,umask=077,gid=46,uid=1000    0   0\n\nAnd here the same as a mount command:\nsudo mount -U <xxxx> -t ntfs -o rw,auto,nls=utf8,umask=077,gid=46,uuid=100 /media/win\n\nFile systems that don't have gid and uid as an option, usually can have their rights set in the normal way after you mounted the partitionm i.e. recursively for all files with chmod go-rwx -R /media/mountpoint (or what ever other mountpoint suits your fancy).\n", "Q: udev rule group ownership not working I have added a udev rule for my Arduino, but the symlink gets the ownership \"root root\" instead of \"root dialout\".\n$ cat /etc/udev/rules.d/47-Arduino.rules \nSUBSYSTEM==\"usb\", ATTR{idVendor}==\"2341\", ATTR{idProduct}==\"0001\", MODE=\"0666\", SYMLINK+=\"arduino\", GROUP=\"dialout\"\n\n$ ls -la /dev/ar*\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 15 sep  8 11:02 /dev/arduino -> bus/usb/003/007\n\n$ ls -la /dev/bus/usb/003/007 \ncrw-rw-r-- 1 root dialout 189, 262 sep  8 11:12 /dev/bus/usb/003/007\n\nMy user is a member of the group \"dialout\" but I still get permission denied error when I'm trying to communicate with the device.\nThere are no problems when I'm using the \"default\" device \"/etc/ttyACM3\".\n$ ls -la /dev/ttyACM3 \ncrw-rw---- 1 root dialout 166, 3 sep  8 11:12 /dev/ttyACM3\n\nI have tried to restart both the udev service and reboot my computer. How can I fix this?\n\nA: I'm not sure there is a way to set the user and group for a symlink with udev. I don't see one either. I'm also doubting whether one should be needed. \nI signed on to tty6 and as root, created a symbolic link/tmp/tty6 to /dev/tty6. After I did its user and group were both root, but /dev/tty6 was owned by me.\nI was able to use\necho hi >/dev/tty6\n\nbut also\n    echo hi >/tmp/tty6\nThe reason is that the necessary permission is carried by the final inode pointed to, not the symbolic link.\nIf I'm right, there is another reason for the problem you are having, although I guess it could be that the program you are using does, incorrectly, look at the permissions on the symbolic link.\nIf that's the case, as a circumvention, perhaps you could create your own link and use that instead of one udev sets. \nln -s /dev/arduino ~/arduino\n\nshould produce a symbolic link to the target of /dev/arduino but with your user and group.\nAs a test, as root, you might also change the group yourself on the udev created symbolic link and see if it helps when going through /dev/arduino.\n", "Q: Keyboard is not working properly I installed 12.04 and it was working perfectly, but since yesterday I encountered a problem.\nWhen I press left Ctrl key, it doesn't respond but when I press Fn key, it works as a Ctrl key and loses its own functioning.\nSame with the Delete key it works as a Pause Break key and Pause Break key is working as a Delete key.\nNumLock key is working as a PrtScr key.\nAfter updating my OS, the problem is still happening.

The man page is man 5 init.\nThere are setuid and setgid items to set the user and group under which the upstart job is run.\n\nAssuming your script execs another script, I suppose you can add the su userid command to it to change the effective uid and gid to that of its argument. I'm uncertain whether its safe to run su in the sysvinit script itself without it changing these for subsequent /etc/init.d/ scripts, but perhaps that's OK, too.\n", "Q: Free non-monospaced font with clearly distinguishable 0 (zero) character I'm using gLabels to create some small pieces of paper to give away to people - Just two lines of about 15-20 characters each. One of the important parts of the design is that there are no \"o\" (\"oh\") characters, but there are \"0\" (\"zero\") characters in an all-lowercase URL. Therefore I need a non-monospaced (and very legible in print) font where \"0\" cannot be confused with \"o\" even without reference.\nThe closest thing I've found so far is Andale Mono  and Inconsolata , but they are both monospace, and as such not very easy to read in print.\nAlternatively, to find a font myself, is there some way to preview all fonts in the Ubuntu repositories without installing them?\n\nA: It will take some work sorting through different fonts, but Google Fonts are free and can be easily downloaded to your computer.

I want to make Cairo dock(with opengl) execute in the start-up only on Gnome-Classic but not on other DEs like cinnamon, unity or gnome.How to do that?\n\nA: *\n\n*First create a script which will run cairo-dock based on $DESKTOP-SESSION environment variable. We are going to create the script in ~/.config/autostart directory and naming it cairo.sh\n\n\n*\n\n*Press Ctrl+H to let nautilus show hidden file. Then Go to your home directory → .config →  autostart directory.\n\n*Right Click on the empty space in nautilus. Select Create new document → Empty Document. Name this file cairo.sh.\n\n*Double click on the newly created file to open it in gedit text editor (or any other editors of your choice) and paste these lines in it.\nif [ \"$DESKTOP_SESSION\" = \"gnome-classic\" ]; then\n    cairo-dock\nfi\n\n\n*Then close the file. Right Click on it, Select Properties. \n\n*On the Properties windows, in Permissions tab, Check Allow executing file as a program.\n\n\n*Then create another file in the same directory, i.e ~/.config/autostart with name cairo. (Don't first name it with .desktop extensions for avoiding later hussle opening it)\nIn that file, copy these lines and paste there, changing the appropriate information like inputting the name of the user in place of \"name of user\". It is an .desktop file which will be called on startup\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nExec=/home/<name of user>/.config/autostart/cairo.sh\nHidden=false\nNoDisplay=false\nX-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true\nName[en]=Cairo\n\nSave the file and exit gedit.\n\n*Then rename the file adding extension .desktop. To rename, Select the file and Press F2. \n\n*After renaming it, Again make the file executable. To do so, Select the file → Select Properties. And in the new window, in Permissions tab, select the checkbox saying Allow the file to run as a program.\n\n*Logout and Login to gnome-classic session. Cairo-dock will be started automatically.\nIf you want to run Cairo on another desktop environment as well, such as ubuntu, you just need to repeat this process, making another set of commands just for that desktop session.  First you would make another cairo.sh, naming it slightly different, such as cairo2.sh.  Then you would open it with nautilus and copy the following lines:\n        if [ \"$DESKTOP_SESSION\" = \"ubuntu\" ]; then\n            cairo-dock\n        fi\n\nThen you would save the file and make it executable as before.\nNext, you would once again create a .desktop command, also naming it slightly different, such as cairo2.  When copying the command lines, copy the following:\n    [Desktop Entry]\n    Type=Application\n    Exec=/home/<name of user>/.config/autostart/cairo2.sh\n    Hidden=false\n    NoDisplay=false\n    X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true\n    Name[en]=Cairo\n\nDon't forget to input the user name in place of \"name of user\" and to make sure the name of the file on the Exec= line is the same as your .sh command for ubuntu, in this case cairo2.sh.\nAfter this just follow the steps as before and when you log in to the appropriate desktop environment, cairo dock should open atuomatically.\n\nA: Have a look at the files in /usr/share/xsessions/. \nThere you'll find ubuntu.desktop, ubuntu-2d.desktop (if you're not on 12.10 already) and gnome-fallback.desktop (maybe also gnome-classic.desktop. I have gnome-shell installed maybe that's where this is from). \nOpen one of those and you'll see they all have an Exec=gnome-session --session=... line. For gnome-fallback open /usr/share/gnome-session/sessions/gnome-fallback.session.\nNow you can\n\n\n*\n\n*change in /usr/share/gnome-session/sessions/gnome-fallback.session the line \nRequiredComponents=gnome-panel;gnome-settings-daemon;\nto\nRequiredComponents=gnome-panel;gnome-settings-daemon;cairo-dock; (check the executable name!)\n\n*change in /usr/share/xsessions/gnome-fallback.desktop the Exec= line, for example\nExec=/home/<yourname>/<yourexecbashscript>\nor also copy your current autostart folder .config/autostart/ to a new place \nExec=gnome-session --session=gnome-fallback -a <Newplaceofautostartfolder>\n\n*create a all new session. copy and rename both gnome-fallback.session and gnome-fallback.session to their new to their respective places under a new name and adjust your new session like in 1.\nThe first two of those work but have the disadvantage that they may or may not be overwritten on update (you will have to check, I'm not sure).\nIn 2. Also if you copy your autostart folder only one of those will be updated depending on which session you are logged into.\nSo I recommend doing it as shown in 3.

I have Xfce and in Thunar file association are changing randomly, to wine applications\nlike jpeg and png to Internet Explorer and mp3 to Windows Media Player.

I can confirm that it works safely on Xfce and will on any other desktop environment, as the locations that wine installs the items to are standard locations for those types of files as delineated at freedesktop.org.\nThe commands below are from the Wine FAQ and do safely remove all open-with entries from the context menu, but they do not remove any wine entries from the applications menu, which I think is just what you want. If you need to see what they will remove, place echo before the rm command, and it will list the changes. You should run each command individually and not copy and paste the whole block, in case you make a mistake.\nrm -f ~/.local/share/mime/packages/x-wine*\nrm -f ~/.local/share/applications/wine-extension*\nrm -f ~/.local/share/icons/hicolor/*/*/application-x-wine-extension*\nrm -f ~/.local/share/mime/application/x-wine-extension* \n\nIt should also be said that when you install a wine program, further new entries will be created, so these commands will need to be run again. The only way to permanently stop the creation of these items is to disable winemenubuilder, but that also affects application menu items and not just the open with menu, so you might not want to do that. See the wine FAQ for more details on that.\nIf you want to run the commands above after installing a new wine program, it would be best to put them in a script, make it executable (chmod u+x) and bind it to a shortcut key.

I want to convert the audio track of a MKV file to HE-AAC (AAC+/AACplus). The audio track is AC3.  But there seems no GUI for HE-AAC encoding? I only found out there is a Command Line Tool (CLI) from Nero, but I don't know if this can do HE-AAC. \nAny help? Any recommendation for a GUI that can convert AC3 to HE-AAC? Also should be able to handle surround sound (5.1/6-channels).\n\nA: Nero AAC Encoder usage\nneroAacEnc does support HE-AAC and HE-AAC v2 via -he and -hev2 parameters. \nThis encoder is (still?) considered to be the best encoder quality wise. Nero offers it free of charge but doesn't give support for it. One problem you will encounter with large files like 5.1 WAV is the file size limitation. It is not due to this encoder being crippleware, but how to handle large numbers in a program. To workaround this you need to pipe the input with another program to the encoder and use the -ignorelength parameter. If you input format is already WAV the following should work:\ncat $myfile | neroAacEnc -q 0.5 -he -ignorelength -if - -of $myencodedfile\n\nYou can also use avconv (formerly known as ffmpeg, now forked and with the CLI tool being renamed) to do the conversion to WAV.\navconv -i $myfile -f wav - | neroAacEnc -q 0.3 -he -ignorelength -if - -of $myencodedfile\n\nNote that the resulting file is a MP4 with a AAC stream in a MP4 container, not a raw AAC stream. You can extract the raw stream with MP4Box from the gpac package if you want to.\nNero AAC quality setting\nThe quality setting depends on the profile you use. With LC-AAC you can go up to -q 1.0. HE-ACC is limited to -q 0.5, I think, and HE-AAC v2 even lower. This is due the techniques behind those profiles that are centered around low bitrates.  Using -q 0.5 will result in a file larger than common AC3 6ch audio from a DVD, using -q 0.3 will cut the file size in half.\nAdvice for codec and quality choice on multichannel audio\nThe situation is (still?) really messy, which is why there exist no easy to use GUI like Handbrake. The most efficient codec is HE-AAC v2 but it is not well supported in Ubuntu, due to licensing/patent issues in some countries. Vorbis is good too, but less efficient. Multichannel mapping should be fixed in the latest LTS release (12.04, it wasn't in 10.04). Leaving out MP3, AC3 comes in third place. FLAC is 4th on efficiency and the most supported lossless format. DTS is a complete looser and should be also left out, like MP3. Convert to FLAC if you can.\nSo if you have AC3 encoded audio, you probably leave it at that if the device and container format supports it. The chart for supported media formats on Android might be helpful.\nAppendix: neroAacEnc help file\nUsage:\nneroAacEnc [options] -if <input-file> -of <output-file>\nWhere:\n<input-file>  : Path to source file to encode.\n                The file must be in Microsoft WAV format and contain PCM data.\n                Specify - to encode from stdin.\n                Note that multiple input files can be specified, they will be\n                encoded together into a single output file with chapter marks\n                indicating source file divisions.\n<output-file> : Path to output file to encode to, in MP4 format.\n\n  ==== Available options: ====  \n\nQuality/bitrate control:\n-q <number>   : Enables \"target quality\" mode.\n                <number> is a floating-point number in 0...1 range.\n-br <number>  : Specifies \"target bitrate\" mode.\n                <number> is target bitrate in bits per second.\n-cbr <number> : Specifies \"target bitrate (streaming)\" mode.\n                <number> is target bitrate in bits per second.\n                When neither of above quality/bitrate options is used,\n                the encoder defaults to equivalent of -q 0.5\n\nMultipass encoding:\n-2pass        : Enables two-pass encoding mode.\n                Note that two-pass more requires a physical file as input,\n                rather than stdin.\n-2passperiod  : Overrides two-pass encoding bitrate averaging period, \n  <number>    : in milliseconds.\n              : Specify zero to use least restrictive value possible (default).\n\nAdvanced features / troubleshooting:\n-lc           : Forces use of LC AAC profile (HE features disabled).\n-he           : Forces use of HE AAC profile (HEv2 features disabled).\n-hev2         : Forces use of HEv2 AAC profile\n                Note that the above switches (-lc, -he, -hev2) should not be\n                used; optimal AAC profile is automatically determined from\n                quality/bitrate settings when no override is specified.\n-ignorelength : Ignores length signaled by WAV headers of input file.\n                Useful for certain frontends using stdin.\n\n\nA: The command line will always be the best option for this job I'm afraid.

Playing under metacity today was bliss. Much higher framerates and just a fluidity that you'd expect from a native game. I'm not sure I can go back.\nSwitching to metacity is no hardship but I wonder if there's anything else in the WM landscape that I should try out.

I tried playing a WMV file in VLC and it told me something along the lines of Unable to play WMV3 files.  Unfortunately there is no way for you to fix this.  When I try to open the same file in MPlayer, it tells me an Internal data stream error occurred.  I finally got it to start playing in KPlayer, but it is really sketchy; it's black and white and there's a few random blue lines down the middle of the video.\nSo is there any support for WMV3 files?\nP.S. the same WMV file plays fine on my PC.\nA different WMV file plays on Ubuntu fine.\n\nA: vlc doesnt use any external codecs as its self contained and comes with all codecs, it should play wmv fine as it does here on all my machines.\nVLC can be installed from the Ubuntu Software Center \n : VLC \n\n\nA: If you have installed The Restricted Extras package sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras and you have tried to play the WMV video with VLC with no luck (I am assuming you did both of this already) then you have a problem with the file itself. You can do the following to check if the file is actually BAD and try to recover the parts that are OK:\nOn the same folder where the file execute the following in the terminal:\nffmpeg -i YourVideoFile.wmv -vcodec copy -acodec copy NewVideoFile.wmv\nor the new version:\navconv -i YourVideoFile.wmv -vcodec copy -acodec copy NewVideoFile.wmv\nIf it starts throwing errors you know it was corrupt. The new file created will be better and you can play it but the corrupt or missing parts will be gone.\nNormally if VLC can't read the file is because of 2 things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Streaming format - Which means you need to be connected to the internet or the progression of the video got lost in several parts somehow.\n\n*Corrupt file - Which VLC would offer a way to fix it temporarily so you can view it.\nIf you already have the Restricted Packages which give you many compatible formats to encode/decode and also VLC which uses it's own native codecs and has the best way to solve video problems then most probably the problem is the WMV file. You can test another WMV to make sure.\n\nA: Do you have the ubuntu-restricted-extras package installed? That might help you. Restricted Extras Package This will install some proprietary codecs also you can also add this ppa and install other W32 or W64 codecs Medibuntu this I hope helps.\nHere is a link That might help Here is another Link Here\n\nA: I'm assuming that SMplayer can play your WMV files but totem and VLC can not. so here's the solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*look for libavcodec extra in synaptic package manager and mark it for remove. it shows you a list of to be removed softwares and packages. press ok and do apply then log out. \n\n*log back in and remove ubuntu-restricted-extras in software center. log out again.\n\n*log back in again and install ubuntu-restricted-extras again.\nyou will be able to play WMV files.\ntested on my ubuntu 14.04LTS.\n\n\nA: You could also move on from WMV files altogether.\nsudo apt-get install libav-tools\n\nThen just use:\navconv -v quiet -i input-filename.wmv ouput-filename.mkv\n\n\nA: If, as others have suggested, you have installed all the codecs and have ascertained that the file is not corrupt, the only unfortunate possibility left is that the file has some kind of DRM (Digital Rights Management) that makes it impossible to play on a Linux based system. As you note, it will play in Windows (presumably under Windows Media Player) as that is able to handle DRM. Also, as you note, other WMV files play fine on Ubuntu, so that may point to this particular file having some kind of DRM that limits the playing of the file.\nThis unfortunately may be the answer if installing, reinstalling the codecs and trying various media players fails to play the file properly.\n", "Q: How can I use Ruby with Quickly?

I have an Intel 3000HD graphics card.\nIs there something like the device manager in Windows, or another way to know if a device is driverless or if the device might have a better driver?\n\nA: In a nutshell:\nSince you have Intel graphics, then you have the driver you need already.\nAs for other components, Ubuntu will inform you if there are missing drivers for certain components, such as your wireless devices. If you are unsure, you can run jockey-gtk and it will run a check for you.\nIf you need to see the details of what you have installed, there are two options:\nGUI (Graphical interface):\nInstall the hardinfo application:\n\nThis gives you a detailed readout of everything on your system, including driver information for your devices.\nIt won't tell you if there are newer drivers available, but that's not really a problem because on Linux the drivers usually come with the Kernel, so you don't really need to \"upgrade\" your drivers (except for certain drivers that are not included because they are proprietary).\n\nCLI (Command-Line-Interface):\nYou can run sudo lshw to get a detailed readout of your system on the commandline:\n\nMy recommendation is that you pipe the output to a file though as it can be rather hefty. So, run:\ntouch sysinfo.txt\nsudo lshw > sysinfo.txt\n\nYou can then view this file at your leisure:\ngedit sysinfo.txt\n\nor\nnano sysinfo.txt\n\nAs izx mentioned in the comments, any device marked as UNCLAIMED has no driver.\n\nFor your touchpad, you just need to change the settings.

This is useful for some applications that doesn't allow the font size etc. to be changed. It would also be useful to e.g. scale up Virtualbox on hi-res screens.\nThe compiz zoom plugin zooms the entire desktop, so that's not what I need. The shelf plugin does what I want, but only scales windows down.\nThanks for any help!\n\nA: There's another plug-in if you open the compiz configuration manager (ccsm) called \"Enhanced zoom Desktop\". There you can define the key binding for the zoom, and keys to zoom only an area or a window.\nIn case you don't have that option, or even the ccsm, you will have to install the packages that includes the extra plug ins. I do it trough synaptic in every new Ubuntu installation. Just search \"compiz\" and install all the available packages (except the KDE related ones).\nWish it helps, good luck!\n\nA: The \"Freely Transformable Windows\" plugin will make windows bigger, as well as smaller, and is installed as part of the compiz-plugins package.\nHowever, there's an important caveat: input doesn't work correctly, and can't be made to do so. X.org doesn't support input redirection (as hengestone points out), so the default in the Freely Transformable Windows plugin is to disable input.

I'm thinking about getting an iPod Shuffle 4th gen., but if it doesn't work well with Ubuntu 12.04/Rhythmbox it's a no-go. \nDoes anyone have any experiences with this combination?\nThank you in advance.\n\nA: I had issues initially getting both my shuffle 2nd generation and later my 4th generation to work under 12.04 with Rhythmbox.  I wish I could tell you exactly what steps worked for me but from the sequence of things I tried I really can't pinpoint pit.  I can offer some things to try that worked for me though.\nFirst, go into Rhythmbox Preferences -> Plugins and disable the iPod and MTP support.  Close Rhythmbox and attach your iPod shuffle.  It should recognize and not prompt you to initialize it.  If it still does, try re-enabling the plugins and then connecting your iPod.  Or, maybe even try a combination of doing this while disconnecting and reconnecting the iPod.  Eventually Rhythmbox will be able to access the iPod.  Those plugins just have strange behavior.\nNext, add a couple songs to your music folder and sync the iPod.  Eject it.  Close Rhythmbox and try to play the iPod through headphones.  If the 2nd generation just blinks the orange light or the 4th generation tells you sync with iTunes, then connect it again.  Open up Rhythmbox, don't add more songs, just sync it again.  Disconnect it.  Try to play it through headphones.  Rinse, lather, repeat.  If at this point things are still not playing, try fiddling with the plugins again, disabling and re-enabling them and disconnecting and reconnecting the iPod while between disabling and re-enabling the plugins.\nSeriously, I did this for both my 2nd generation and 4th generation iPod shuffles and eventually they actually played.  From there on out I had no problems adding music and syncing it ever again with Rhythmbox.\nNote, not once did I have to connect either device to the actual iTunes Windows software.\nFurther note, iPod Shuffle 4th generation sometimes shows the voiceover .wav files in the list of iPod contents in Rhythmbox.  I deleted these a couple times in Rhythmbox without knowing what they were but the iPod seemed to keep putting them back -- it won't hurt if you do delete them in Rhythmbox.  Eventually once the iPod starting playing these no longer showed up in the list of music on the device in Rhythmbox.\nI know this all sounds a bit crazy but it really works.\n\nA: I had only problems with iPod Shuffle and Ubuntu, doesn't matter which player i was using. i products are useles without iTunes. You can make it work without it, but you will have troubles often.\n\nA: The player will works, but you will lose the rating of the songs if you go back to the iTunes. You should install some codec to play the music.\nThis is my rhythmbox picture:\n\nNote: You can't open your iTunes playlist on Rhythmbox\n", "Q: Has anyone tried the Lenovo USB 3.0 Dock on Ubuntu?

No response from any keyboard commands or from any clicking and I eventually have to force it off. \nI can log in recovery mode just fine without any issue so I've updated Ubuntu in recovery mode but I still have the same issue.\n\nA: Not exactly a solution but try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Log into your desktop and wait until the hard drive stop reading. The way you describe it seems like unity is not loading properly.\n\n*After this, switch and  log into a tty. You can do this pressing Ctrl+Alt+F6 and log into the terminal.\n\n*Change the variable DISPLAY so the next commands will affect the graphic environment:\nexport DISPLAY=:0.0\n\n*Execute this:\ncompiz --replace &\n\n*This should make compiz try to restart. You should return to the GUI (Ctrl+Alt+F7 or Ctrl+Alt+right arrow) and see if it loads the desktop. Any error message would show up in the tty6 you executed the command.\n\n*If this doesn't work, try to reset unity to defaults, in the same tty6:\nunity --reset\n\n*And repeat the process, try to reload compiz/unity again and see if it works. As a last advice if this is not working you could install an alternative desktop manager like gnome-shell or xfce:\nsudo apt-get install gnome-shell\nor\nsudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop\n\nThat way you'll have at least an usable desktop to surf the web and search the answer.

If you download the ghostscript source, they're all there.\nIs there any benefit to using the TrueType versions instead? Will the display improve? Will it affect printing?\n\nA: Many people would argue that Postscript fonts are actually superior to TrueType. In fact, in a professional setting, Postscript and OpenType are used more frequently than TT. Advocates of TT argue that TT allows for better hinting (note that PS fonts can also have hinting), even though in many cases the popular fonts do not take full advantage of TT capabilities. PostScript fonts used to look jagged on vintage Windows machines without Adobe Type Manager, but that is the past.\nBottom line is, you will not notice much difference between the free TT and PS fonts, at least not in the price range you are paying.\nSee also:\n\n\n*\n\n*Purple Fusion Graphics: Font Wars: PostScript vs. TrueType vs. OpenType\n\n*TrueType & PostScript Type 1: What's the Difference?\n\nA: Truetype is implemented differently and therefore can have more information (more positions recorded for the vectors) and therefore is not losslessly derivable from the Postscript/OpenType versions, though the reverse is not true. The benefit of TrueType is portability across systems.\nThat said, this is the format, rather than actual implementation. So it depends on a given font, if the typographers have made use of certain features of the format, or not.

I recently installed 12.04 LTS and it works fine, but I have a problem. \nI live in the university dorms and in order to use Internet, I have to put proxy settings which require authentication. I had a problem with downloading from the store but I read the solution you wrote here still sometimes it works.

Is there any possible way of doing that in Ubuntu 12.04?\n\nA: If you set the proxy settings, then open Firefox. Go to Edit menu → Preferences → Advanced → Network tab → Settings and in the window where the proxy settings are, you can add IP ranges for internal networks that you do not want the proxy for. \nSo for example if you are on a 192.168.x.y network, you could try adding in the small window there \"192.168.0.0\" => then all these addresses will not use the proxy settings. \nHope that helps.\n\nA: To solve the problem in general (instead of only for Firefox), you should apt-get install dconf-tools, then run dconf-editor.

What would happen when I got a malware in my windows file system, or everywhere else.\nIs it affect on the Ubuntu OS? Can I get a virus or any malware as I use Ubuntu, and it may affect on the Windows OS?\nFor example, if I got a spyware on the Window OS, when I will use the Ubuntu, is it will continue spy on me?\n\nA: tl;dr Don't worry.\nThe virus would have to be written to affect Wubi. Linux viruses themselves are rare, bt one that affects wubi hasn't been heard of. Of course, a virus affecting the MBR or boot.ini on the Windows host can cause trouble since it can cause the computer to be unable to call WUBI or GRUB which takes over after Wubi. So, you are not at risk, but you can be susceptible to MBR viruses, which aren't that common nowadays.\nNote; Of course it can copy the virtual disks used by wubi but that would be prohibitive both for the attacker, and the average internet connection. You have a very high chance of unwittingly interrupting such evil data transfer. Other spyware is run as a Windows program and set to be autostarted by Windows, so it will not affect Ubuntu as only a small portion of Windows is loaded(just ntldr, which isn't enough to autostart these programs), so it won't affect Ubuntu. However, if one gets your passwords from Windows, and you use the same passwords everywhere, you can be attacked even on online services you only use on Ubuntu. This happens even without Wubi.\nNow, about keyloggers:\nTo effectively keylogger your machine, one must either install(physically) a small device, or use an MBR keylogger. Even this may be thwarted due to the effect of GRUB, and how it loads Linux. Therefore, you should only worry heavily about \"evil-maid\" attacks, involving an adversary physically sticking pieces of hardware onto your computer. MBR attacks for keylogging are uncommon and not a high risk since they will likely be unable to transmit logs without the help of the host OS.\n", "Q: Why does DVD playback still not work after installing libdvdcss2?

I have here a company notebook, and because the HDD is full encrypted, I cannot install an extra partition for another system that I would like to use in my free time. And I really need another system, because this crap Windows here with that much of anti-virus, anti-spyware, anti-whatever on it is so slow and annoying.\nWhat can I do? I could use an external USB HDD with another system. Because I would like to handle big files and so on, I don't want to use a USB stick. A USB 2.5 HDD + Ubuntu is what I think the best option.\nHere are my questions: \n\n\n*\n\n*Do I have to note something? \n\n*Does Ubuntu run well on an external HDD? \n\n*Do I have big performance problems (because of the USB HDD)? \n\n*Should I buy a very fast HDD for much money or it is not that important? \n\n\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: Yes, Ubuntu will run reasonably well on an external drive, as long as you use a reasonably fast interface.  I have actually survived for a few weeks on a 8GB USB 2.0 flash drive as my boot drive, and although it was slow, it was not that horrible.  Now, if you have the choice, you should absolutely go for either USB 3.0 or (e)SATA, as USB 2.0's performance, while rated at 480 Mb per second, is going to be a lot slower in real life.  You will experience some speed issues, but only during hard disk access.  Linux has pretty good file caching, and after the program loads/file opens you are going to have the same performance as you would otherwise.\n\nA: I've done it before on a 500gb wd passport. It was pretty lightweight stuff (web browsing mostly), with a reasonably modern DE (KDE 4.0 I think), with a 'full' install rather than a unetbootin style frugal install. I'd go with a lighter DE if I could, or better yet, throw together a 'bespoke' install with just what I'd need. \nAs long as you arn't throwing massively disk intensive things (well more so than usual - videos should be fine.. actually, anything a reasonable, non poweruser would do is fine), it'll probably handle things sufficiently. \nI wouldn't go with a flashdrive for this since they do wear out (eventually). If you do, there's pretty fast USB 3.0 flash drives worth considering. I'd just go for a reasonably priced, modern, USB HDD myself - maybe usb 3.0 if you have it on your system. If your laptop has esata/esatap, it would be the best, no compromise option for running a hard drive off of - it'll give you the same speed as an internal drive, but external.\n", "Q: Strange display language in gnome shell \nPossible Duplicate:\nGnome-classic language turned into Chinese, how do I change it back to English? \n\nI logged in gnome-shell, and found that the display language is set to some strange Asian language (I think) without my prompt. \nI tried to change the locale settings but found that the default language is English (how?) despite of that strange language.\nHere's a snapshot, See the strange word instead of \"Activity\":\n\nI'm on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.\nOutput of locale:\nLANG=zh_CN.UTF-8\nLANGUAGE=zh_CN:en_US:en\nLC_CTYPE=\"zh_CN.UTF-8\"\nLC_NUMERIC=en_US.UTF-8\nLC_TIME=en_US.UTF-8\nLC_COLLATE=\"zh_CN.UTF-8\"\nLC_MONETARY=en_US.UTF-8\nLC_MESSAGES=\"zh_CN.UTF-8\"\nLC_PAPER=en_US.UTF-8\nLC_NAME=en_US.UTF-8\nLC_ADDRESS=en_US.UTF-8\nLC_TELEPHONE=en_US.UTF-8\nLC_MEASUREMENT=en_US.UTF-8\nLC_IDENTIFICATION=en_US.UTF-8\nLC_ALL=\n\nOutput of locale -a:\nC\nC.UTF-8\nde_CH.utf8\nen_AG\nen_AG.utf8\nen_AU.utf8\nen_BW.utf8\nen_CA.utf8\nen_DK.utf8\nen_GB.utf8\nen_IE.utf8\nen_IN\nen_IN.utf8\nen_NG\nen_NG.utf8\nen_NZ.utf8\nen_PH.utf8\nen_SG.utf8\nen_US.utf8\nen_ZA.utf8\nen_ZM\nen_ZM.utf8\nen_ZW.utf8\nPOSIX\nzh_CN.utf8\nzh_SG.utf8\n\nSolved:\nThis answer did it.\n\nA: Solution #1\nIn Ubuntu, this command will show the language-related packages you have installed:\ndpkg -l language-pack*|grep ^ii | awk '{print $2}'\n\nPurge any packages (using the ubuntu software center or synaptic or otherwise) that are not english (-en-) and reboot.\nSolution #2\nTry this:\nsudo update-locale LANG=en_US.UTF-8 LANGUAGE=en_US:en LC_CTYPE=\"en_US.UTF-8\" LC_NUMERIC=en_US.UTF-8 LC_TIME=en_US.UTF-8 LC_COLLATE=\"en_US.UTF-8\" LC_MONETARY=en_US.UTF-8 LC_MESSAGES=\"en_US.UTF-8\" LC_PAPER=en_US.UTF-8 LC_NAME=en_US.UTF-8 LC_ADDRESS=en_US.UTF-8 LC_TELEPHONE=en_US.UTF-8 LC_MEASUREMENT=en_US.UTF-8 LC_IDENTIFICATION=en_US.UTF-8 LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure locales\n\n..and reboot.\n", "Q: Microphone not capturing sound on 12.04 Lenovo G580 In both Skype and the Sound Recorder application, I am not capturing any audio from my built-in microphone.

That might be because in gstreamer-properties I have changed the settings from custom to PulseAudio, and in pavucontrol under the Input tab the mic seems to be displayed as work for about 3 seconds, but I can still record sound or use Skype.\nSo I don't know why it looks like it doesn't work, but it does.

So I wanted to ask here what are the benefits of having it in the home folder instead of the default one.\n\nA: Keeping web folders in user's home directory is good for 2 reasons mainly:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have a web server with multiple users, keeping www folder in user's home directory will help you organizing, you can -as a administrator- easily know which user has what in her web folder.\n\n*Second issue, well, actually the main issue is, security. By default Apache runs by a single user: www-data. However, if you have multiple web sites -owned by different users, let's say customers- running on a single server, and if you make www-data user own those web folders, users won't be able to make any modification in those folder via ssh, ftp, etc. Hence, to overcome this issue, you need to run apache with another user account for each user's web directory (apache-mpm-itk, suPHP and some other software helps you do this). In this case, keeping web folders of each user in user's home directory is the best. Because a user can do modifications on her own web directory connecting via ssh, ftp or any other method.\n\n\nA: Honestly all I can think of is for a multi-customer server.

Sadly there haven't found any good tools for performing these functions on vanilla Ubuntu install but there are lots of Ubuntu dirivatives that offer the functionality you describe. You may want to checkout Untangle, or my personal favorite pfSense (FreeBSD based has many advanced features). They are both great solutions but I recommend pfSense because it has some more advanced networking features that require a support license to use in Untangle. Both install and function very well inside Virtualbox for testing so that might be a good place to start. \nIf you really want to go through with this the hard way, I would strongly recommend this book http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/0137081332 .

Next, when I tried to remove the package, the root user couldn't access dpkg, so I deferred the uninstall. Third was the worst: I restarted. By restarting Ubuntu 12.04, the OS was stuck booting forever just as you describe.\nFortunately, I had a copy of Finnix 103: http://www.finnix.org/. After a bit of analysis on the hard drive partition, I realized that bash, dash and sh have been deleted from the /bin directory. So, I copied them over from the Finnix installation:\n# mount <ubuntu_partition> /mnt/linux\n# cp /bin/bash /mnt/linux/bin/bash\n# cp /bin/dash /mnt/linux/bin/dash\n# cp /bin/sh /mnt/linux/bin/sh\n\nAt this point, I could use dpkg again while using chroot on my Ubuntu partition. I noticed again, however, that apt-get was insisting to remove dash again upon each command. So, I reinstalled dash:\n# apt-get install dash\n\nFinally, I restarted my computer and booted up into Ubuntu 12.04 just fine. I inspected the package history and these were my results:\n\nAll events at 5:28 PM were when I blindly executed the recommended TeamViewer 7 installation commands to get into an online meeting:\n$ sudo dpkg -i teamviewer_linux.deb\n$ sudo apt-get -f install\n\nAt this point, I didn't want any more of TeamViewer. So to clean up further, I purged teamviewer7:i386 using dpkg:\n$ sudo dpkg --purge teamviewer7:i386\n$ sudo apt-get remove teamviewer7:i386 \n\nIn conclusion, the TeamViewer 7 i386 version for Linux removes /bin/dash which is the root of all the symptoms from the terminal failure, to the dpkg failure to the boot failure.\n", "Q: What Linux program reads Atrac3+?

In some Bios versions, there you can choose the order of \"hard drives\" which include USB drives as well.\nThis solution solved this problem on a number of computers where I tried to boot from a USB.\n", "Q: Why can't mythtv backend see my HDHomeRun tuner? Ran a fresh install of Mythbuntu 12.04.1 32bit.  Went through the backend setup and was able to see my HDHomeRun Prime (HDHR3) device, scan, and detect channels.  Cannot get to live TV on frontend. Backend log seems to indicate it's not detecting my tuner, even though I configured it in the setup.\nSep 8 15:03:33 Dimension-8300 mythbackend[1668]: E TVRecEvent dtvmultiplex.cpp:325 (ParseTuningParams) DTVMux: ParseTuningParams -- Unknown tuner type = 0x2000\nSep 8 15:03:33 Dimension-8300 mythbackend[1668]: E TVRecEvent dtvchannel.cpp:308 (SetChannelByString) DTVChan(192.168.1.12-0): SetChannelByString(3_1): Failed to initialize multiplex options\nSep 8 15:03:33 Dimension-8300 mythbackend[1668]: E TVRecEvent tv_rec.cpp:3681 (TuningFrequency) TVRec(1): Failed to set channel to 3_1. Reverting to kState_None\n\n\nA: The most common reasons for MythTV tuning issues are:\n\n\n*\n\n*You didn't go though all the steps in mythtv-setup (specifically\nsteps 2, 3, and 4). These 3 steps define the tuner, data, and then\nconnect the tuner to the data. All 3 of these steps are required.\n\n*You set your tuner to use multiplexing (number of recordings > 1)\nand it doesn't support multiplexing. This is done in step 2 of\nMythTV setup (in the Advanced settings section I believe).\n\nA: I had exactly the same error messages that you have listed.  In addition, the listing display wouldn't show many HDHR-Prime cable channels, and displayed them with program-ID numbers instead of FIOS human readable channel numbers.\nBased on this post, I did the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*deleted all channels\n\n*on Tuner-to-source panel, fetched channels for my HDHR Prime (has cablecard from Verizon FIOS)\n\n*on Tuner-to-source panel, scanned channels for my old over-the-air HDHR\n\n*on Tuner-to-source panel, fetched channels for my old over-the-air HDRR\n\n\nNow the listing displays FIOS channels with the human-readable channel numbers, all listings are populated, and I can view live TV and record off of the HDHR-Prime.  The old over-the-air tuner works fine as well.  Interestingly, most of the over-the-air channels are slightly higher quality video than FIOS.  \nThis was the smoothest Mythbuntu upgrade that I've done, and the new audio setup/testing features in mythfrontend are great. I now have 5.1 audio working for the first time.\n", "Q: Can't replace MDM Display Manager with LightDM! I installed MDM, and found it's incompatible with my VGA hardware.

The guys at the computing centre recieved it before me, erased the hard disk, and installed all their crappy software (Novel, outlook, and the like).\nI tried to install Ubuntu with dual boot, but because they apparently did whatever it is they did wrong, and the installer does not recognize the existing windows installation and only suggests to install Ubuntu as a sole OS. None of the advices here or here helped. My final decision is to indeed let Ubuntu erase all existing windows stuff (and then use windows occasionally through VirtualBox).\nHowever, when I try to do that it tells me that the partitioning looks like GPT but doesn't have the correct signatures, or something like this. It asks whether this is indeed a GPT HD, and I don't know what to tell it.\nWhat I ask is: should I simply use gparted from the CD to repartition the HD? If so, what would be the recommended partitioning (I have 750GB), and the recommended filesystem (ext3? ext4?).\nUpdate: here's a screen shot\n\nThanks in advance for any advice.\n\nA: Yes, indeed. Boot from the live cd, run gparted, select Device -> Create Partition Table... on the disk you want to install Ubuntu (I assume the laptop has one harddisk anyways). It will notify you that all data on that harddisk will be inaccessible after this process, if you are OK with this, confirm and continue.\nI would suggest doing partitioning on this step, as well. Prepare your partitions, then while installing select the partitions you already configured.\n\nA: A complete description (size, type, ..) of the required and optional partitions for Ubuntu installation, is available here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DiskSpace\n\nA: *\n\n*Boot your system using live-cd and install gparted if not already installed. \n\n*sudo -i\n\n*gparted\n\n*resize sda3 to your needs.\n\n*create extended partition\n\n*create a new partition within the extended partition\n\n*now start ubuntu installer\n\n\nI hope it helps.\n\nA: If you're feeling a bit anxious about using the command line than the GParted live CD\nis a good option.

Well I did fixed my overheating problem on my Lenovo T500 with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. At the same time I did install Thinkfan. But since I have a solution for overheating now, I would like to know if there is any really good reason to keep it? \nMy fan speed without it was cca 3000 RPM. When it installed droped to 2500RPM in idle time. Thinkpad have very quiet fans, so I don't really hear the noise when is on 3000RPM (no difference between 2000 or 3000 RPM). Is it better for processor to have more air or more air brings just more dust?\nSilly question but I would REALLY want to know the reason of keeping thinkfan.\n\nA: It depends on the requirement of you.   \nUsually slowing fan speed slows down CPU. If you are a heavy user who needs more CPU power, then I suggest you to remove thinkfan. On the other hand, If you can't see any radical difference in performance, You might want to keep it.\n\nA: The purpose of thinkfan is not only to slow the fans down. It was created to give you control over the fans. In my case with a T430 I was in the position that I wanted a more silent notebook in case it was cool and a faster fan in times of serious load.\nThe default controls of the T430 do not spin up the fan to the maximum level which leads to throttling. With thinkfan I was able to use the maximum level before temperatures that cause throttling are reached.\nSo, with a bit of tweaking both silent running as well as higher performance can be achieved.\n", "Q: Hard disk raid data lost after restart I have Ubuntu 12.04 and two disks working via raid.

To do that, open .bashrc file, which is in your home directory:\ngedit ~/.bashrc\n\nAdd the following line to the end of that file:\nalias matlab=\"/usr/local/MATLAB/R2012a/bin/matlab\"\n\nFinally, reopen your terminal, or type source ~/.bashrc and execute this command.\nSource: How do I create shortcuts, aliases, or links to MATLAB?\n\nA: I've just installed Matlab 2012b on Ubuntu 12.10 and followed up by installing the matlab-support package in the Ubuntu Software Centre:\nsudo apt-get install matlab-support\n\n(As per this answer in a related question: https://askubuntu.com/a/140078/16835)\n", "Q: How can I capture video from my Camcorder via USB streaming in Ubuntu? I have a laptop with 12.04 LTS. I want to import video stored in my camcoder. The camcoder has magnetic tape. How can I import the video using USB streaming, as my laptop does not contains any FireWire port & there is only USB cable provided with camcoder?\n\nA: Try Kino or MPlayer.\nKeep in mind that USB isn't fast enough to keep up with the video.  I had over 40 tapes, that I tried doing that with, I end up buying a Sony VRD-MC5.  I'm sure Sony have newer model now.  I was very happy with the job it did.\n\nA: For the case of the USB cable, you may encounter certain issues when trying to gather the data from the camcorder itself, such as that certain software (like kdenlive, can't say for kino or mplayer) won't gather any USB inputs. In addition, the USB Cable is mostly used for having the functionality of USB Web camera in certain models.\nYou may wish to run a test on this device\n\n\nOf which is well known that it runs fine in Windows based systems.\nAnother good choice to grab video from an analog device is to bridge/bypass your video in a VHS or another device featuring a RF output and using the proper TV Tuner device. In my case I have tested this by using the Hauppauge HVR-850 USB HDTV Adapter and the procedure mentioned in the answer to this question: Record from VHS tapes, more specifically this: https://askubuntu.com/a/156496/9598 (it is too long, so I won't reproduce it here).\nHave a look at that procedure and see if your Camcorder is recognized during the process, specifically in the step 1 (as a video device in the list of /dev/video?). If so, the same process can be used for your Camcorder.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Uninstalling/deleting Calligra I am installed Calligra on Ubuntu 12.04, but I do not like it and now I want to uninstall it. I am installed unstable release with project-neon. I am tried to delete folder in /opt but I can not permanetly delete it. How to uninstall/delete Calligra and Project Neon?\n\nA: Try using one of the software package managers Synaptic or Ubuntu Software Center. Open, for example, Ubuntu Software Manager, search for Calligra and press the remove button.\n\nA: Just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command below.\nsudo apt-get purge calligra\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nDepending on how you installed Project Neon, you would:\nsudo ppa-purge ppa:neon/ppa/ \n\nsudo apt-get purge project-neon-kdeplasma-addons project-neon-session\n\nOr\nsudo apt-get purge project-neon-kdepim project-neon-common\n\nOr as Beni Bogosel said you can use synaptic.\n", "Q: Ubuntu-Fedora dual-boot: Set up swap partitions for simultaneous hibernation? I want to install another Linux distribution (Fedora) besides Ubuntu 12.04 on my laptop. As I like to hibernate my system and as I want to use this feature on both installed Linux distributions, how many swap partitions do I need? And if I need multiple swap partitions, how do I configure them?\nEdit/Clarification: I want to be able to hibernate both operating systems simultaneously. I assume that I need a separate swap partition for each installation (correct?), so how do I assign a specific swap partition to each of the installations, avoiding that one of my installations uses the wrong swap partition? Is it enough to list only the assigned swap partition in an installation's /etc/fstab? Or what else do I have to do?\n\nA: You can't use shared swap AND hibernate.  They need separate swap partitions.  \nIf you decide to use shared swap and find that one is trying to resume from a non-hibernating swap (the issue I think is probably at hand) you may be able to edit the kernel boot parameters to include \"noresume\" to keep it from trying to restore from swap.  \nYes, putting the correct swap partition in /etc/fstab should be enough.  \nNote that this is untested, but it should work.  If it doesn't, let me know and I'll delete it.  If it does, then great.  \n\nA: Nope, you don't need multiple partitions. But you won't be able to hibernate both of them simultaneously (assuming Fedora also uses swap space to dump the contents while hibernating).\nSo, if you hibernate Ubuntu and run Fedora, you shouldn't hibernate Fedora, and vice-versa.\n", "Q: booting into 12.04 results in a purple sceen for just a second.

I had tried this with a cheaper device from Amazon (on two... no, three? versions of Linux), with no useful response.

Since you can't change the setting without having a working serial port, the only way to do it is to exit the Arduino UI and edit the preferences.txt file (in Unix, it's in ~/.arduino/preferences.txt). Look for Serial.debug_rate and change it to 9600. Restart the Arduino UI and try uploading a simple sketch (eg. 'blink') and see if it's fix the problem.\nI'm not sure why this would happen - I've used 14400 and never had a problem. I guess it's just one of those weird problems that never seems to have a repeatable reason?\n\nA: I was having the same error. As far as I can tell, this is a permissions problem. The problem no longer occurred when I ran the Arduino IDE with root permissions. That is, I ran it as:\n    sudo ./arduino\n\nI know this is a bad solution, but for now it works. I tried adding read/write access to the serial device file as mentioned in https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/arduino, but this had no effect, and still caused the error if I tried running it without root permission. I'm still looking for a better solution.\nEDIT : \nThis problem has been fixed by following the answer given in https://askubuntu.com/a/58122/206687. In short, if you add yourself to the dialout group, the problem should get fixed.\n    sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER\n\nJust logout and log back in again after running this command, and you should be able to access the serial port without any problems.\n\nA: Try to install the 1.0.5 version of the Arduino IDE.\n\nA: I found an easier way without using terminal. In the Arduino IDE, go to File-> Preferences and at the bottom of the popup, they give you a link for the 'preferences.txt' file. Click that and it'll open the text. MAKE SURE AT THIS POINT TO CLOSE YOUR ARDUINO IDE. Make the change to '9600' Serial debug rate and save and exit. Open up your IDE and it should work now. \n", "Q: How to do a Port Proxy? As some software doesn't listen to IPv6 port, we often do a port proxy to solve the problem.\nFor example, the remote desktop in Win2003, we just run\nnetsh interface portproxy add v6tov4 listenport=3389 connectaddress=127.0.0.1 connectport=3389\nand then everything goes well.\nNow I'd like to visit the Deluge WebUI (127.0.0.1:8112) by IPv6, how to do this in ubuntu???\n\nA: You can use xinetd for that.\nIn this example I'll show how to redirect incoming connections to IPv6 address 2001:db8::1 port 1234 to IPv4 address 192.0.2.1 port 1234.

Say I used some thumbdrive on a public Windows computer and I copy some data to my Ubuntu computer with it. I cannot be completely sure that the Windows computer was clean, and it might have put something onto my thumbdrive. Is there a way to erase everything on a USB-Stick, even MBR viruses and that kind of off-filesystem stuff?\n\nA: Open terminal\nDo\nlsblk\n\nSomething similar appears on your screen:\n\nSuppose your USB drive is sdb with 4 GB memory\nThen do\ndd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb bs=2M count=2048\n\nIn this way you overwrite your entire pendrive with zeros. Everything including any possible viruses and malware will get deleted.\nHere /dev/sdb portion is extremely important and you need to be extra cautious.\nFor example, if you put a in place of b in /dev/sdb then your entire hard disk will get written by zeros instead.\nHere I gave count=2048 as my pendrive size is 4GB and since block size created here is 2MB, so  2 MB x 2048 = 4096 MB = 4GB. Replace 2048 with your suitable value.\nAlso if you want you can change the block size to whatever you want.\nnow do \nfdisk -l\n\nThe output is something like this\n\nHere you confirm your current pendrive memory size.\nNext you have to create partition table. We will do that with parted tool.\nIn terminal type the following:\nparted\nselect /dev/sdb\n\nLabel it as GPT type parition table\nmklabel gpt\n\nMake default unit size from MB to GB\nunit gb\n\nFinally create the partition table:\nmkpart /dev/sdb 0GB 3.7GB\n\nHere I did 3.7GB because actual free space of my pendrive is 3.7 GB. Do replace it with your own value.\nNext view the final result\nprint\n\nThe whole thing will be similar to the following:\n\nPress q and put enter to come out of parted prompt.\nNow it is time to create a file system. We will be crating the universal file system fat32. \nAlo we will be using mkfs command to do it.\nType the following in terminal\nmkfs.vfat /dev/sdb1\n\nNow you have a brand new pendrive free from all viruses and malware\n\nA: sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdX bs=1k count=2048 \n\nThe script given above only erases the partition table and not the whole disk which is what the OP was requesting.\nTo erase everything off the disk and setting all bits to zero\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdX bs=4M iflag=nocache oflag=direct\n\nExplaination of the extra options: \nRemoving \"count=2048\" removes limitation to 2048 bytes so dd can perform on entire disk.\nbs=4Mb - bs is block size and so this will do the erase in 4Mb blocks, which is quicker than 1k.\niflag and oflag will try to disable buffering, which is not needed for a constant stream.\nThen follow the instructions as outlined above to partition and format the disk.\nTo find the disk letter, open a terminal and run:\nsudo tail -f /var/log/messages\n\nThen plug in the flash drive and the disk letter will be revealed!\nSubstitute the disk letter for X in /dev/sdX\nThis will blank all data on the disk!\n\nA: If you want something utterly and irrecoverably gone, shred is a pretty good option.\nshred -f -n 5 /dev/sdX\n\nwhere sdx is your thumbdrive should probably do the trick - it overwrites the whole drive 5 times (change n to a suitable number) with random data.\nYou can find the path to the thumbdrive with fdisk -l.\n\nA: You can use good old Linux tool dd to do this. \nTo do so:  \n\n\n*\n\n*First open a terminal with pressing Ctrl+Alt+T. \n\n*Then type sudo blkid in the terminal.\n\n*Very carefully and closely examine the output. \n[sudo] password for anwar: \n/dev/sda1: UUID=\"63c6fb01-aac4-4d38-b29e-5a5780a98d12\" TYPE=\"ext4\" \n/dev/sda2: LABEL=\"Main\" UUID=\"A80C1BD70C1B9F7E\" TYPE=\"ntfs\" \n/dev/sda5: LABEL=\"Work\" UUID=\"01CCB271A80A07E0\" TYPE=\"ntfs\" \n/dev/sda6: LABEL=\"Edubuntu\" UUID=\"364126ac-01c9-4dd2-ab19-eecc733a9640\" TYPE=\"ext4\" \n/dev/sda7: LABEL=\"Windows\" UUID=\"5A8C72C98C729EE7\" TYPE=\"ntfs\" \n/dev/sda8: UUID=\"312d4cd9-21a9-4c0d-aa34-26230e70fa89\" TYPE=\"swap\"  \n/dev/sdb1: UUID=\"E87F-1D12\" TYPE=\"vfat\" \n\nLook at the last line with /dev/sdb1. That is the USB drive which is formatted with Fat (vfat) file system. Note that, the USB drive has only one partition which is named /dev/sdb1. If it had other partitions, they would have been named as /dev/sdb2 ... and so on. The USB drive itself is named /dev/sdb, Note that, it doesn't have a 1, 2 or any number after sdb\n\n*Then execute this command to replace all of the data in the USB drive with  0.\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdX bs=1k count=2048 \n\nI intentionally haven't given the original /dev/sdb in the command, so that new users do not accidentally mess up their system. Replace the USB drive name found in step 4 in the above command.\nThis should give you a clean USB. You need to create at least one partition to use the USB after this operation.\nCreating partition on the empty disk\nTo create a new partition on it, You can use parted program. I'm giving an example of creating a partition in a complete raw disk. Our USB disk is 2GB (~2048) in size. We assume, it's device name is /dev/sdb. You can check your device name with the command sudo lsblk (you have to guess the correct device by looking at size and etc).\n\n\n*\n\n*First we need to eject the USB after the last command and re-insert it.\n\n*Then we need to create a partition table on the disk. We are going to create a partition table of type msdos, sometimes known as Master boot record.\nsudo parted /dev/sdb mklabel msdos\n\n\n*Then you are adding an empty \"primary\" partition, which will hold a Fat file system later.\nsudo parted -a none /dev/sdb mkpart  primary fat32 0 2048\n\nWe specified the start point (from 0 MB) to the end point (2048 MB), though actually the disk may not have full 2048 MB space, but don't worry, parted will adjust it automatically. Note we are creating a single, primary partition on the whole disk. But you can create multiple partition on it. (Though it is not recommended, because Windows will only recognize the first partition). \nThis newly created partition will have the id /dev/sdb1\n\n*Then finally create a Fat filesystem on the /dev/sdb1 partition by doing formatting.\n mkfs.vfat -n \"Disk\" /dev/sdb1\n\nWe are creating a fat filesystem on /dev/sdb1 partition with the name \"Disk\".\nThat's it. You have now a new clean USB disk with a fat partition. \nNote, you can also use the Disk-Utility program to create partition and Format it with Fat. \nUsing Disk-utility\n\n\n*\n\n*Press Super key and Type \"Disk utility\" in it.  \n \n\n*In the Disk utility window, Select the USB drive in the \"Peripheral devices\" section.\n\n\n*You may need to unmount the drive first.\n\n\n*Then click on the \"format drive\" button\n\n\n*Select partition table type from the new window. Select \"Master boot record\".\n\n\n*After you created the new partition table. The disk utility window will look like this\n\nClick on \"Create new partition\" button.\n\n*Select \"Partition type\" and optionally type a name for the partition.\n \n\n*The partition will be created within 4-5 seconds and you will have a clean USB disk afterwards.\n\nUsing Gparted\n\n\n*\n\n*First you need to install gparted, if you haven't done so yet. You can install it by clicking this link : gparted  or using this command in a terminal\nsudo apt-get install gparted\n\n\n*Then open gparted by typing \"gparted\" in the dash. To open dash, press Super key which also known as \"Windows\" key.\n\n\n*Then select the USB device from the drop down menu in right. It should be like /dev/sdb, /dev/sdc etc. Please take special care for not to select /dev/sda, because it is the device your OS is installed. You should only select it, if you know what are you doing.\n\n\n*After selecting the USB device, (which is in my system, /dev/sdb) , see whether any of it's partition is mounted. You can see a key icon in the mounted partition entry and the mount point of that partition. \n\nUnmount any partition mounted partition on that device. To unmount, select the partition → Right click → Select unmount from the menu. \n\n\n*Then going to gparted menu → Devices → select Create partition table to overwrite and create a new partition table on the selected device.\n\n\n*A new window will be shown Warning you to the action going to be done. The default partition type is \"msdos\" and I strong suggest you not to change it, if you do not know. Also check another time that, you indeed selected the right device. Then Click Apply button. \n\nAfter clicking Apply button, the device will be absolutely empty. No partition and no data. \n\n\n*Then  select the unallocated space → Right Click → Select new to create a new partition. \n\nIn the create new partition dialog box, select Create as \"primary\", File system as \"fat32\" and click on the Add button. Optionally, you can also give a name to this partition.\n\n\n*After you click Add button, gparted will show you a preview of the device if you apply the changes. There will be a light green tick mark icon in the toolbar. You need to click that icon to apply change. There is also an Undo button, you can use it, if something goes wrong at any step. \n\nAfter applying the changes, gparted will show you a message saying \"All operations have been completed successfully\".\n\nNow you are done with it. \nUsing new Disk-utility (12.10)\nUbuntu 12.10 is now equipped with a new Disk utility. It uses new udisks2 program as backend. \n\n\n*\n\n*First open the new Disk-Utility by typing \"Disks\" in the Dash. Bring the dash by pressing Super key\n\n\n*After opening the Disks (former disk-utility) program. Do these\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the externel disk\n\n*Unmount the disk if it is already mounted.\n\n\n*Then select the partition and delete it by pressing the \"Stop\" play icon. \n\nRepeat this step if you have more than one partition on the disk until all partition has been deleted.\n\n*After all partition has been deleted, the disk will now only contain Free space. You can now create a partition by clicking the small + icon.\n\n\n*Select the type as \"FAT\", give a label and push the \"Create\" button to create a partition. \n\n\n*Your disk is now containing a partition. You can mount the partition by pressing the \"Play\" icon. You can directly browse the location of the mounted drive by clicking the link with label \"In use, Yes\" \n\nYou're done. \n\nA: You can format the drive to ensure all data on it is nuked.

Both Chromium and Firefox have the problem, however files played directly on the machine with Rhythmbox sound just fine.\nI'm running 12.04 LTS on a C2D T9300.\nMost of the audio problems others ask about seem to be hardware related, so the following information might be relevant.\n  sudo lshw -c multimedia\n   *-multimedia     \n   description: Audio device\n   product: 82801H (ICH8 Family) HD Audio Controller\n   vendor: Intel Corporation\n   physical id: 1b\n   bus info: pci@0000:00:1b.0\n   version: 03\n   width: 64 bits\n   clock: 33MHz\n   capabilities: pm msi pciexpress bus_master cap_list\n   configuration: driver=snd_hda_intel latency=0\n   resources: irq:48 memory:f8400000-f8403fff\n\n\nA: Your issue sounds more like a bandwidth problem. If the streaming audio comes from an external broadcast you are limited by both your bandwidth and the broadcaster's bandwidth.\nThis usually occurs when you are attempting to gather a high bitrate broadcast. Have you tested the behaviour of your sound system when gathering information from a different place?\nBuffering must also be considered, unfortunately the buffering itself can't be software controlled if the case is as of an internet radio-station and in certain cases you can allow the buffering by pausing the playback as mentioned in this Support answer by Google, related to \"Buffering and Playback problems\"\nDo you mind providing any further information about the stream that is causing your issue in order to run a test? after which this answer may be edited to include the results of the testing.\nGood luck!\n\nA: I had this exact issue, try this, when your streaming video go to system settings\n(the gear with the wrench/screwdriver on it) click on the rightmost tab (\"simultaneous\noutput\") and toggle the check box (it should be checked in the end) this is a temporary fix, of course.

I have a dual boot System with an Ubuntu-Filesystem a Windows Filesystem and another FAT Filesystem on my harddrive. My Thunderbird configuration is on that FAT partition.\nI tried different tools, but they are mounting the filesystem as root, so thunderbird cannot read and write on it. Sorry for my bad english and thanks for your answers.\n\nA: Let us name your data partition as FAT for simplicity, and it's device name as /dev/sda11. Of course the actual partition Label and device name could be different.\nYou can check your device name and it's Label (If you set label, otherwise you will be given UUID of the device) with this command. Don't worry, if you see different UUID value for your system. Just open a terminal by Pressing Ctrl+Alt+T shortcut and type \nsudo blkid | grep vfat\n\nFor my system, the output is like this,\n/dev/sda11: LABEL=\"FAT\" UUID=\"28D3-995A\" TYPE=\"vfat\" \n\nYou can see, I've only one FAT partition whose Label is FAT and It's device name is /dev/sda11. The most important bit of information is this device name.  After you have known the device name of your Fat partition, proceed as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal by Pressing Ctrl+Alt+T shortcut.\n\n*Type The below command \ngksu gedit /etc/fstab\n\nand hit Enter. This step will open /etc/fstab file in your gedit text editor. If you are using Kubuntu, replace \"gedit\" with kwrite. For Xubuntu and Lubuntu, use leafpad instead of gedit. \n\n*At the end of this file, Add the below line \n/dev/sda11  /media/Fat   vfat   defaults,rw,users,uid=1000,gid=1000  0    0\n\nMy user id is 1000 and group id is 1000, so I added uid=1000 and gid=1000. Check what is your user id and group id and use them as the value of uid and gid.\nTo Find your user id, type id -i your-user-name and to find your group id, type id -g your-user-name.\nAfter adding the line,  save the file by Pressing Ctrl + S keyboard shortcut. Then exit the Text editor by Pressing Alt+F4. You can also use close \nDon't simply paste the line, replace /dev/sda11 with the actual device name of your FAT partition you found by executing sudo blkid | grep vfat command early in the answer\n\n*Then Again return to the terminal and type the below command \nsudo mkdir /media/Fat\n\nand hit Enter.\n\n*Restart your PC and see if your fat partition is correctly mounted. \n\nA: Check out this link below \nhttp://www.howtogeek.com/60817/how-to-auto-mount-partitions-at-linux-startup-the-easy-way/\nthere are multiple options which you can use.\nhope this helps\n\nA: Heres a guide for confusing fstab via command line for auto mount on boot. (Screenshots included)\nhttp://ubuntuserverhelp.com/mounting-with-fstab/\n\nA: To mount an NTFS partition at boot you need to modify the /etc/fstab file.\nUse Disk Utility or the sudo blkid command to find out what is the name of the partition (sda?) then add a line to the fstab file.\nCreate a folder in the /media or /mnt folder (/media/Data in the following example) and add the corresponding line.\nThis is an example line for an NTFS partition:\n/dev/sda4 /media/Data ntfs auto,rw,users,exec,nls=utf8,fmask=0022,umask=000,uid=1000,gid=1000 0 0\n\nTo modify the fstab you could press Alt+F2 and type gksudo gedit /etc/fstab. Save and reboot to test it worked.\n", "Q: Does Ubuntu support Core Parking? Core parking is a new feature that introduced in Windows 7 to get better Battery performance .\nDepending on the resource use of the operating system it may park one or multiple cores of a multi-core cpu to reduce the computer’s power consumption and thermal emissions. Once operations require more processing power, the parked cores are activated again to assist in the tasks\nSo my question is that is there any way i can do it on Ubuntu 12.04 \" Core Parking \" ?\n\nA: For the time being, I do not have a clear answer for this, however it is obvious that the linux Kernel is using some energy saving mechanisms.\nHowever, doing some quick research around, I quickly realised that the most recent Linux kernels make use of a feature called ACPI which is an acronym for Advanced Configuration and Power Interface. \nWhat the ACPI is doing:\n\nthe Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) specification\n  provides an open standard for device configuration and power\n  management by the operating system.\n\nvia Wikipedia.\nBasically the ACPI allows for control of different CPU states, to allow for better power management.\nDifferent ACPI CPU-states:\nCPU C-States (power management)\n\nBasically, there is probably nothing that you have to worry about\n  concerning the CPU \"C states\". These are automatically controlled by\n  the kernel+ACPI system taking into consideration current system load.\n  (CAVEAT: check out the note about AMD Athlon and Duron processors\n  below). The ACPI code in the newer (2.6+) kernels automatically puts\n  your CPU to sleep when there is idle time (note: this does not change\n  the CPU frequency. That is controlled by \"P states\" - see below).\nThe only thing to realize is that your system is completely\n  \"conscious\" when the CPU is momentarily halted - you won't notice much\n  of a difference. However, the power savings can be considerable. Just\n  think of it as having your CPU taking thousands of \"micro-naps\"\n  whenever it is idle.\n\nCPU-T States (throttling)\n\nThese are very much like \"C states\" (the same HLT instruction is\n  used), however the difference is that throttling is \"forced by you\"\n  (like every 4th cycle is forced to be a sleep cycle, as opposed to the\n  \"C states\" above which are automatically determined by the system\n  load). Note that the frequency has NOT been changed... see the \"P\n  states\" below.\n\nCPU-P States (performance)\n\nMany processors these days (especially laptops) can have the clock\n  frequency actually slowed \"on the fly\". This adds up to huge power\n  savings. Intel calls this \"SpeedStep\" and AMD calls it \"Cool'n'Quiet\"\n  or \"PowerNow\". More generically these states are called \"P states\".\n  You will almost certainly have to go into the BIOS and enable this\n  feature for your CPU FIRST!\n\n** Some consumption benchmarks:**\n\nWhat are the power savings from the above CPU states? The following\n  data is extracted from the AMD website. Consider an AMD 64\n  3400+/2200MHz with 1 MB of L2 cache. By the way, while I'm here, let\n  me complain about the AMD naming convention. The number 3400+ doesn't\n  mean jack squat. This is just AMD's way of saying that this processor\n  \"looks like\" an Intel Pentium-4 running at 3400MHz. I guess this is\n  their way of not losing marketshare. Here are the P and T state power\n  consumption values (the C state is the same HLT instruction as the T\n  state):\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Performance State 0 (Fully Active) (2200MHz): 89 Watts \n\n*Performance State 1 (2000MHz): 70 Watts \n\n*Performance State 2 (800MHz): 35 Watts\n\n*Throttled (HLT instruction): 2.2 Watts\n\n\nSome references for further reading\n\n\n*\n\n*Red Hat power management guide ( I know you asked about Ubuntu, but this is still a good read)\n\n*http://www.spencerstirling.com/computergeek/powersaving.html\n\n*This article talks about APM mostly (an older version of ACPI) but it makes a reference to ACPI too.\n\n*Very technical information can be found here.\n\n*The PowerTop software, which seems to be cool.\n\n*The Gentoo Power management guide. Still a good read.\n\n*An introductory Linux Journal Article.\n\n*And the Wikipedia article.\nEDITS\n[EDIT #1]: Googling around, I found some other posts in some forums too (OpenSuse forum seems to be relevant to what you seek) and found out that this is not that much of an issue for Linux as it is for windows and especially in gaming. I also dug up some information in two mails (first one and second one [follow-up]) in the RedHat mailing lists that seems to be related. I am currently researching the information in it.\n[EDIT #2]: I have researched the issue a bit, and I am getting more and more certain that there is not a core parking mechanism in Linux, unless there is one the ACPI that I am unaware of. Some interesting findings are some pieces of software that allow for direct manipulation of the cpu and the processes run on it, like cpuset, numactl and last but not least, CPUfreq. Will continue with my research.\n\nA: There's an article here mentioning that core parking relates to setting cores to advance c-states to save power. c-states are set with the halt instruction. As NlightNFotis mentions this is done using linux's support for ACPI.\nYou may be able to get some more information about the states into which your cores are put by linux with the powertop (sudo apt-get install powertop) open source program written by Intel. If your hardware supports various c-states it should be able to tell you what percentage of time your cores are put into these reduced-power states by Ubuntu Linux. See below. The higher number the c-state the more power that is saved.\nIt provides much more information as well.\nAlso, like Windows, when there is work to do Linux can adjust the frequency at which the cores run depending upon the amount of demand, desire to save power, etc.\nMy laptop doesn't support c-states, though it can be suspended. A little Acer we have with an Atom processor does support them, as you can see below.\n\n", "Q: How to decrease sensitivity of the Launcher?

But yes, at this moment, this bluetooth adapter has problems in the way how the firmware loads. The kernel supports it and now it can even be recognized with new kernels (starting from 3.5.0.17). But the firmware doesn't load and you can't use it.\nFor new kernels as a temporary workaround you can do the following.\nYou run VirtualBox with Windows (Windows 7 is preferred) and then you share the device\nwith the guest machine. Check if it works. And if it works you just shutdown the guest, quit from VirtualBox and you would be able to use BT normally in Linux.\nWith Ubuntu 12.10, hopefully, it will start to at least recognize this adapter. You can \ncheck the bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/863051\nand mark it as \"affects me\".\nWith the last dist-upgrade this adapter started to recognized but is not working yet (i.e useless).\nFor now the only option is to wait. \nMore technical details here: http://marc.info/?l=linux-bluetooth&m=134704995714896&w=2\nHere you can mark the bug as \"affects me\" so it get more attention https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1065400\n", "Q: Why does Ubuntu, sometimes, fails to load?

The tip that solved my issue came from the troubleshooting section of the Ubuntu Cron Howto:\n\nWhen adding a new entry to a blank crontab, forgetting to add a\n  newline at the end is a common source for the job not running. If the\n  last line in the crontab does not end with a newline, no errors will\n  be reported at edit or runtime, but that line will never run. See man\n  crontab for more information. This has already been suggested as a\n  bug.\n\n\nA: I don't have any clue about your script issue, but if your need is to have some realtime charts about the sensors' temperature available through a web server you can give a try to psensor-server.\nIt is available in the standard ubuntu repositories, so you can install it easily with 'sudo apt-get install psensor-server', run 'psensor-server', and finally open the URL 'http://hostname:3131'.

This inverts the vertical and horizontal two-finger scrolling, and works fine in Terminal, Chrome, Document Viewer, etc.\nHowever, it doesn't work in Nautilus and some applications such as the Update Manager, as they keep the usual mapping. I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 x64\nWhy does this mapping work for some applications but not for others? I know there is software I can download to do the same, but this method seemed \"cleaner\".\nThanks\n\nA: I found out how to solve the problem: Read this if you're having the same issue.\nAt least it worked for me, since my trackpad is a Synaptics. This changes the direction from the driver level, which is before the X mapping.

To install nmap, type sudo apt-get install nmap on the terminal prompt. \nAfter you have downloaded and installed it, to perform a basic port scan type in the terminal prompt nmap -sS 127.0.0.1. This should perform a SYN Stealth Scan on your computer. \nSimilarly with other software.\nNOTE 1: While it is possible to manually download and use the pieces of software required to complete your task, doing so can be tedious. I suggest downloading and using Backtrack Linux, and Ubuntu based and modified distribution, suited for penetration testing and hacking. By suited, I mean that a clean install of that distribution includes a great load of tools that are ready to be used for hacking purposes.\nNOTE 2: While I assume that by hacking you either imply that you want to learn, or perform a penetration test, you have to know that an attempt to hack a computer system that neither belongs to you, nor you are authorised to do so, is illegal, and can lead to great trouble, including, but not limited to going to Jail, and being sued for damages *I, personally, do not endorse or promote illegal activites.* \nNOTE 3: *If you are looking for a testbed to test your knowledge, and/or learn more about hacking, consider using a virtual lab.* A virtual lab comprises of several virtual machines running concurrently on the same machine, or the same network, configured for a special purposed. Software to create a virtual lab includes the open source and free VirtualBox and the more advanced one (but still open source) QEMU. By setting a virtual lab, you ensure that all machines belong to you (so you are free to do whatever you like to them), and you are also minimizing possible damage to both your physical computer and others.\n", "Q: On a Win 7 machine, can I have BOTH 32 and 64 bit Ubuntu boots? I have a machine that is Win 7 Enterprise. I installed an Ubuntu 64-bit on a dual boot. However, it turns out that I have software requiring 32-but Ubuntu. Can I install another instance of Ubuntu as 32-bit and three boots?\nAlso, how can I change my Ubuntu to be the primary boot rather than Windows?\n\nA: You can run 32-bit applications on 64-bit Ubuntu. You may simply need to install the ia32-libs-multiarch package, or if you require some libraries not in that package, simply installing the library by appending :i386 to the package name may allow you to install the 32-bit version alongside the 64-bit version. Note that not all packages support multi-arch yet.\n\nA: Though you haven't explicitly said about Wubi install, I guess you are asking about Wubi installation of Ubuntu.\nThe short answer to your question is, Yes, If your CPU can support 64bit computing. In recent days, almost all CPU support 64bit OS. So, your chance is very high.\nIf your CPU support 64bit OS, then of course you can install another instance of 32bit Ubuntu inside your Windows. All you have to do is, Install the second instance of Ubuntu on a separate partition than the one, where you installed 64bit Ubuntu. That means, if you installed 64bit Ubuntu of D: drive, You can't install another instance of Ubuntu on the drive D:, so choose another partition for it.\nAfter you installed 32bit Ubuntu, you should have three entries in Windows Boot Manager. The First one is \"Windows\" and the second and third one will be labeled \"ubuntu\". The first \"ubuntu\" entry is the 64bit Ubuntu (which you installed first) and the second one (the third entry) is 32bit Ubuntu , you installed later.\nTo make an Ubuntu entry as Default boot:\n\n*\n\n*Boot to the Windows\n\n\n*Right Click on the Computer icon, either in the start menu or in the Desktop and select Properties.\n\n\n*In the Properties Window, in the left blue side bar, there will be four link. Select the link saying \"Advanced System Settings\".\n\n\n*In the new window, Select \"Advanced\" tab and in the \"Startup and Recovery\" section, click on the \"Settings\" button.\n\n\n*Under \"System startup\" select an Ubuntu entry from the dropdown menu. Close all the windows.\nReference\n\nA: You can install multiple Ubuntu using wubi.More on it is answered in this question.\nTo make Ubuntu to make your primary boot(by primary boot,I am assuming that you don't want Wubi),you have to install ubuntu on a different partition.For that you can see Ubuntu Community Page.\n\nA: The short answer, yes you can.\nBut you need to use manual partition option, to create separate partition for each OS.  As far as Ubuntu, you can use the same swap for both the installs.\nI would recommend the use of either VirtualBox or VMware.  VirtualBox is free, and can be installed for both Ubuntu and Windows.  With virtual machine you wouldn't have to reboot  your computer. \n", "Q: how to enable bluetooth and change brightness in sony vaio VPCEH26EN?

The problem was that it updated the kernel from 3.2.0-48 to 3.5.0-34. I was able to boot using the new kernel by adding rootdelay=90 kernel option, but the system was unstable. So I uninstalled that kernel image and installed the linux-image-generic package, which in Ubuntu 12.04 is 3.2.0-48.\nIn the grub menu try selecting previous Linux versions if you can, and select the oldest kernel version, which might be 3.2.0-48. If you boot up successfully, open up a terminal and type in sudo apt-get remove --purge linux-image-3.5.0-34-generic this will also update grub.\nIf the above doesn't work, boot from a live CD or USB and install boot-repair. Once install, run boot-repair and select advanced options. Go over to the GRUB Options tab and check Purge kernels then reinstall last kernel. \nIf none of those work, then your probably have file system issues, and might need to risk fsck.ext3 -f /dev/(root partition) from a live CD, preferably alternate install.\n", "Q: Ubuntu crashes at login screen \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhat should I do when Ubuntu freezes? \n\nI'm completely new to Linux and wanted to give it a try.\nI installed Ubuntu using the windows installer.\nAfter rebooting the PC it automatically boots into Ubuntu and get the first time run screen and then the login screen.

I just don't understand the how-to pages for installing Ubuntu from USB drive.\nIs there any program that can make USB drive from previously downloaded Ubuntu ISO images?\nSomething like that would be pretty handy.\n\nA: unetbootin  is probably the best and the easiest way to make a bootable USB irrespective of the OS you are using to create the USB as it is crossplatform.\nIt has a very easy interface and options to choose between distributions straightaway from the menu and to select the desired iso image.\nAlso,creating a bootable USB using Unetbootin will give you a very very simple and easy interface when you boot your machine using the USB.\nI would suggest to use this software straightaway without doubt...\n\nA: Universal USB Installer – Easy as 1 2 3 from http://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/ works well.

Hard disks, external hard disks and all removable media are supported.\nSARDU\n\nA: Unetbootin and linuxliveusb are best for making usb drive bootable.\n\nA: The default Ubuntu way to burn a CD, assuming you already have Ubuntu running, is to start up the Startup Disk Creator and follow the prompts.\n\nA: Terminal: dd bs=4M if=/path/to/archlinux.iso of=/dev/sdx status=progress && sync\nUI: Use a tool called etcher https://etcher.io/\n\nA: There are many different bootable USB drive software out there. Here are the few choices that you have\n\n\n*\n\n*You can use unetbootin, which is a great tool that works on multiple OSes.\nThis is my personal favorite.\n\n*You can use Rufus, which is a great tool if you are using Windows. It presents a great interface and is fast.\n\n*If you already have a copy of Ubuntu running, you can use Startup Disk Creator to help you. It is already pre-installed.\n\n*You can use terminal. This command will work fine \ndd bs=1M if=/path/to/ubuntu.iso of=/dev/drive status=progress && sync Don't forget to point this to where your iso file is and use the drive that you want to copy it to. \n\n\nGood luck!\n", "Q: How to burn ubuntu to a cd and make it bootable I need help with burning Ubuntu to a CD and being able to boot it into a PC, and an old iBook. I have already downloaded the ISO file, and have burned it to a CD.\nHowever when I try to load it, it doesn't work. \nI would also need help when it boots up. I would like to perform the procedure on a PC too.\n\nA: If you are using Ubuntu -\nIf you are using Ubuntu itself to create the bootable CD/DVD, use k3b  instead of brasero .\nAfter you install and start K3b select the option Burn Image as seen below in the image-\n\nAfter that click on the Open File Dialog option as seen below and then select the iso image by browsing to it.\n\nIf you are using Windows -\nIf you are using Windows to create the bootable CD/DVD i suggest using InfraRecorder  instead of Nero.\n\nA: I believe this link is the official step by step tutorial which teaches you how to burn an ISO on to a DVD to make it bootable.  \n\nA: Instead of burning the .iso to disc as a file, you need to tell your burning software to burn it as an image instead.\n\nA: Burn it using the slowest speed setting possible.  Also, make sure to \"Burn\" it.  If you just copy the iso file, it will not be bootable.\nIf that does not work, we may need to check the MD5 checksum to make sure the iso file is good.\n\nA: the simplest possible way to burn a iso in Linux according to me , is to use cdrecord. \nJust the following command in the shell:\ncdrecord youisofile.iso\n\n", "Q: Can't install Ubuntu12.04.1 LTS; is the Graphics card responsible for that? Specs: Intel Core i7 Win7 32-bit nVidia GeForce GTX 560 23 inch monitor\nI have an Ubuntu DVD. It boots fine, but when I select any of the options (like \"Install Ubuntu\") I get a blinking cursor which blinks forever.\nThe DVD also works fine on other PCs, even having lesser specs like Pentium D.\nDVD name: ubuntu-12.04.1-dvd-amd64.iso\nIs it the problem of my nVidia Graphics card?\n\nA: One solution that comes straight to mind is that you are using a 64bit DVD but have a 32bit W7 installed. The W7 installation won't make a difference but maybe your processor is 32bit.\nDownload the 32bit DVD and try installing again.\nI don't think the GFX card will be causing the problem, nVidia and Intel are usually the best options for Ubuntu.\nGood luck!\n\nA: The problem is unlikely to be your nVidia card - they are quite well supported and its unlikely that a problem with it would manifest itself in this exact way anyway. \nI've had problems with Live CDs before, and I would recommend firstly trying the CD again if you haven't already. \nIf it still doesn't work, consider using a live USB instead. I've found them more reliable personally. The Ubuntu website has great instructions for creating them, and you will also find that the installation goes much more quickly if it does end up working.\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows\nIf you don't have a USB stick, or really don't want to use one, try burning a different CD. Sometimes CDs don't burn properly and errors can result, so getting a different one and trying again might help. \nWhilst there's a chance that the problem is with Ubuntu, and we will of course help you if they are, it's probably a good idea to eliminate these disk-related possibilities first as they are much more likely to be the cause.\n\nA: Solved!\nYes the graphics card was the problem!\nI just answered a similar question here.\n", "Q: How can I replace Rhythmbox with Banshee?

I even got to upgrade to u + 1 (Ubuntu 12.10 Quantal Quetzal), but my effort was, again, fruitless. \nI desperately need some help, because, as is, this process is draining my computer's battery so fast, that makes Linux usage a disappointing experience.\nIt is noteworthy, that I do not have any such issues when I use windows, which results in twice as much battery life.\n\nA: \n\"kworker\" is a placeholder process for kernel worker threads, which\n  perform most of the actual processing for the kernel, especially in\n  cases where there are interrupts, timers, I/O, etc. These typically\n  correspond to the vast majority of any allocated \"system\" time to\n  running processes. It is not something that can be safely removed from\n  the system in any way, and is completely unrelated to nepomuk or KDE\n  (except in that these programs may make system calls, which may\n  require the kernel to do something).\n\nI found this on a Ask Ubuntu question found here. Apparently the dude's solution at that question was I solved the problem by installing phc-intel packages from link\nSome interesting information regarding what kworker is and its usage can be found here. Unfortunately, the solution there seems to be a future kernel upgrade.\nFrom the same question:\n\nI've found many reports of something that \"fixed\" this for one or\n  another user. Most \"fixes\" seem to be related to updates of the kernel\n  of various sorts. Where the update can be tracked to a specific issue,\n  it seems to often be some driver or kernel service that has been\n  patched to not misbehave: I have the impression that there are a very\n  large number of things in the kernel that can cause a behaviour which\n  is observed as excessive kworker usage.\nIf you find the system unusable due to excessive kworker activity, I\n  would recommend trying to do fewer things. If you think you're not\n  doing anything, try shutting down long-running services or timers (RSS\n  readers, mail readers, file indexers, activity trackers, etc.). If\n  this doesn't work, try restarting. If your system allows you to enable\n  or disable hardware in a preboot environment, try turning off hardware\n  you aren't using. If it happens on every restart before you do\n  anything, you could try uninstalling things, but at this point you'll\n  want to be running syscall profiling tools to track down specific\n  applications that seem to be causing this overload.\n\n", "Q: Dual-boot: Can't select Windows at boot I have a computer with 2 operating systems dual booted: One is Windows 7 and the other is Ubuntu.

So I am fairly new to it.\nI have deleted some files from my home folder. But now the problems have started. The system volume automatically reduces to zero. Further, as soon as I restarted my system, my panel settings we restored to default.\nWhen I right click in my home folder, it gives an option of 'restore missing files' but I am not able to restore them.\nPlease guide me how to restore them.\nThanks\nNarendra\n\nA: Your home folder contains literally every file and setting which you, as a standard user, are able to edit, and which your programs (including the Unity desktop environment and/or panels) are able to edit and save their configurations in. It's basically a sealed box, which you and your programs can only get out of if you know your password (which is one of the reasons Ubuntu is so secure - a virus would need it too). This means it contains all settings related to your desktop, and it explains why your panel settings restore to default if you delete it.\nIn general, don't touch (or delete!) any hidden files in that folder (files starting with a full stop - or period if you're American). Pressing CTRL+h toggles visibility of hidden files.\nAs for restoring them... if you moved them to the wastebasket, they are easily restored by opening the wastebasket, selecting the files you deleted, and clicking the \"Restore Selected Items\" button. It will probably ask you if you wish to overwrite the newly created files which replaced them, you do.\nIf you permanently deleted them, then you permanently deleted them. It would be easier just to change the settings back yourself than to try to recover them.\n\nAlso, can you please clarify what you meant by system volume reducing to zero?\nAlso, the \"Restore missing files\" option you mentioned only restores from a backup. If you did not make one, you cannot restore it.\n", "Q: Where can I find information about ubuntu compatible or certified hardware/PC models? I am buying a new desktop PC in early 2013, anyway this question should apply to someone intending to buy a new laptop/ultrabook as well.\nThis machine is not meant for gaming, and if I ocasionally do it, I can survive with minimum graphics. However I may need some heavy multimedia edition or multitasking at times, so basically  my greatest priority is a good processor, after that perhaps average graphic card (if onboards are not enough, I am still not informed enough about that), at least 4GB of RAM with possibility of expansion.\nI know there are some PC models specially designed to ship with Ubuntu, which is the OS I use the most these days. However, most people around me use Windows and some software with unsupported versions for Linux and not having a Windows license becomes a bit problematic.\nGiven that, I would like to find information about which PC models or even manufacters currently on the market have the best compatibility with Ubuntu, I am still undecided between building my own desktop or buying a pre-made model, so I would like to find information both for certified models and certified hardware or even Ubuntu partners that may work closely with Canonical.\nWhere to find this information in order to make sure that I will have a good experience with Ubuntu on my new PC in the years to come?\n\nA: See the Ubuntu Certification website at:\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/certification/\nSpecifically, for desktops and laptops/netbooks, go directly to:\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/certification/desktop/\n\nA: The best way to tell if hardware is working in Ubuntu is to check the official page:\nUbuntu Desktop certified hardware\n\n\nMy thoughts about how much of a \"guarantee\" this database of hardware gives you in practice:\n\n\n*\n\n*Some manufacturers (OEMs) silently use other hardware components with similar specifications. \"300 Mbps Wireless LAN\" in the specifications is subject to change on their side and they're free to supply Canonical a Linux-compatible one and another (cheaper) one to you.\nHere's a nice example of that: LP Question \"Feedback on the Dell Inspiron 1545\" in Ubuntu Certification Programme where Dell silently changed the Bluetooth module with a totally different one, breaking the certification programme.\n\n*Some components are being used in a specific geographic area, while others are being used in another. One example: I've seen the HP Probook 6550b in a completely different configuration in Holland than the possible configurations listed on the Ubuntu site. The HP business supplier I had contact with wasn't even able to tell me which components were installed for the one he was shipping. Moreover, I once got two different WLAN cards (I believe one Broadcom and one Realtek) in a single batch of the exact same HP configuration code!\n\n*Preconfigured-only models (usually the consumer grade line of products) are usually subject to the above two items even more than the configurable business-line of models.\n\n*The database is useful if you can identify the configuration options from this list in the configuration with your supplier. For example, if the Ubuntu certification list lists the Broadcom WLAN option with a note, but the Intel one with a straight stamp and you see two options in the configuration process: \"802.11n Wireless LAN\" and \"Intel Advanced N WLAN adapter\", then you'll know what to choose.\n\n*For more general hardware support like ACPI handling, power control (battery status) and USB, which are not likely to be different across the specific configurations, this database is quite useful.\n\n\nMy conclusion: OEMs take (too much) freedom in their choice for components and there's no way to tell the exact configuration in terms of vendor/product id's of the components you'll get after ordering. Take this Certification list not too serious, but it will give you a rough idea.\n\nA: I would also suggest that you first look for minimum hardware requirements of your Ubuntu version here. Also Ubuntu website has a list of certified devices as mentioned in izx's answer.Make sure you confirm the specifications of the device from hardware provider's home page.\n\nA: You can check here for desktop and laptop compatibility that has been tested by Canonical: http://www.ubuntu.com/certification/desktop/\nor just buy one of the great machines from System76: http://www.system76.com\nThen again, I'm running a five-year-old HP EliteBook 6930p, and it runs like a champ.\n\nA: My experience with Ubuntu (since 8.04) is that if you don't have brand new components in your computer it will work. For example my laptop an Asus 1201n brand new when I installed 10.04 it had a problem with the wireless network, it was a easy fix after you Googled your hardware and a year later with a fresh 11.04 everything worked just fine. \nBut this is just my experience, I think you should find a computer you want and then Google it to see how good it's supported. But don't forget what gertvdijk said, you should know the exact model of the components in your computer, like CPU, graphics, network card, etc. \nThis question can't be answered with a good fact since the support is constantly extended and any list of hardware support will always be a step behind. \nAs I said, look around, find a computer you want and then look around to see how well the support for that computer and the components in it are. \ngood luck!\n", "Q: How to set acpi=off for installation? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I disable ACPI when booting? \n\nI'm trying to install Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 64bit from a USB created in Windows using the recommended software from pendrivelinux.

I can see them in the network list, they can see each other in the list, however they are not able to see me. Why is this so? I need this function to be able to operate because we use file sharing functions.\n\nA: In order for file sharing to work in Ubuntu, you need to share something first. The easy way to do that is right click a folder you want shared, select 'Sharing Options' and mark the 'Share this folder' box. You should then see a massage requesting the permission to install the sharing service (aka Samba), proceed as requested, and, hopefully, before long, you'll be able \"to operate\" just fine.\n\nA: mikewhatever is correct in that you should make sure Samba is installed.

I don't seem to have gapless playback on Rhythmbox or Clementine either, if those media players are supposed to have it.\nI'm not sure what other info to provide. This is just annoying to me. Thanks for any help.\nEdit: this is in Ubuntu 12.04\n\nA: Based on my on research, I think the problem is that I am using MP3, which is compressed. A small gap is added at the beginning and end of each MP3 track, so it is apparently impossible to get true gapless playback. \nSee the wikipedia page on gapless playback. I have the same problem while using Music on Console, which also supports \"gapless playback\".\nUnfortunately, I don't have a solution, either.\n\nA: It's not your hard disk. The problem is the software. Rhythmbox and Banshee both cannot do gapless playback even though they claim to. You might want to try another player like Audacious or Aqualung.\nGapless playback has been an issue on Linux ever since. Users have been asking for this to be default in a fresh Ubuntu install, but nothing happens. Developers simply don't like classical music or audiobooks. They only listen to chart crap and other popular music. And that's why gapless playback is rare on Linux. Because nerds don't have music taste.\n\nA: The fact that Banshee does not properly playback MP3 files \"gaplessly\" probably has nothing to do with the music files themselves. Although MP3s are a form of compressed audio (just like M4As, WMAs, etc.), they can still be encoded to play gaplessly.\n\"Encoder delay\" is the term for the number of silent samples added at the beginning of an audio file when it is encoded, and \"encoder padding\" is the term for the number of silent samples added at the end of an encoded audio file. If track 1 of the CD you just ripped onto your computer as an MP3 was encoded without padding and track 2 was encoded without delay, then the two tracks are able to be played gaplessly. Whether or not they are encoded in such a way depends on the encoder. For example, Windows Media Player encodes CBR (constant bit rate) MP3s without delay or padding, and so they can be played back gaplessly in iTunes (source: my 14:59 CD, by Sugar Ray, in which the last two tracks are meant to segue gaplessly). See this wiki section for some information about repairing badly delayed and/or padded MP3 files, as it will give you some insight about how audio files are encoded and decoded with regard to gapless playback.\nSo if your files are encoded to play gaplessly, they are encoded to play gaplessly. End of story. Putting them onto a different partition, or even  onto a network drive, has absolutely no effect on whether or not the track can be played back gaplessly.\nNow, whether or not the tracks actually are played back gaplessly has to do with how the music player buffers the audio samples and sends them to the audio interface (in Linux distributions, the most common audio interface is PulseAudio). If the music player is programmed poorly (which I'd say 99% of them are, unfortunately), it may not begin to read, decode and play the next track until the current track finishes, in which case there are many possible causes of delay, from thread context switching to bring the music player's thread into the foreground, to reading the first few frames of the audio file from the disk (which takes on the order of up to ten milliseconds for an HDD), to decoding those frames, to sending them down to the audio interface, to the audio interface sending them down to the sound library (usually ALSA, in Linux distributions), to the library sending them down to the kernel via a system call...you get the idea. So it is up to the music player to be reading the frames of the next track before the current one ends so it can send them down to the audio interface in a gapless fashion.\nIn my experience, I have searched and searched for music players that actually play music files gaplessly (one of my favorite albums is Abbey Road, and the medley on side/disc 2 is destroyed when it's not gapless...), and sadly, most of the ones that report gapless playback (including RhythmBox and Banshee on Linux, Google Music, Samsung Music Player and countless others on Android, and various different ones for Windows) don't. The only two I've found that truly implement gapless playback correctly are iTunes on Windows, Mac, iPods, iPhones, etc. and GoneMAD Music Player on Android. If your music files do not play gaplessly in at least iTunes, then they were not encoded correctly, and you'll want to encode new ones from CDs or FLAC files you may have.\nSo, unfortunately, I do not know of any music players in Linux that actually do gapless playback. Maybe one of these days I'll look into the code of Banshee and see if there isn't anything I can do to help make it truly gapless...\nAnyway, I hope this explanation helps a bit. If anyone else knows of some good music players that do gapless playback correctly, please comment.\n", "Q: fglrx installation without success - gl_conf issue I followed the steps of this guide.

This is probably the default if you're logged in as the original user you created when you installed, but may not be if you're logged in as a user you created later.\nSo to fix it, either:\n\n\n*\n\n*Log in as the original user you created when you installed Ubuntu, or\n\n*Add your current user to the \"cdrom\" group.\n\n\nTo add a user to the \"cdrom\" group, log in as a user with sudo permission (such as the original user you created when you installed), open up a terminal, and run the command:\nsudo usermod -a -G cdrom <username>\n\nwhere <username> is the user you want to add to the \"cdrom\" group.  Then verify that the user in in the \"cdrom\" group:\ngroups <username>\n\nIt should show \"cdrom\" in the list of groups.\nLog out and back in as <username> (this is important, or the desktop environment won't pick up the new group membership), insert a blank CD, and you should be set.\n\nA: Have you inserted CD or DVD in the drive? Note, the option won't appear in the right click menu if you haven't done it yet. See this link for help.\nBurning CD/DVD with Brasero:\n\n*\n\n*Press Super key to bring dash and type \"Brasero\" and open it.\n\n\n*Click \"Data project\"\n\n\n*Click the + toolbar icon button to add files.\n\n\n*Click on the bottom right \"Burn\" button to start burning.\nThat's it. You have burned a CD or DVD with Brasero. Though you might also want to use k3b, because it has higher reputation in Linux ecosystem than Brasero.\n\nA: Maximize or widen the window of CD/DVD Creator and you will see a button labelled Write To Disc.

What is to be done? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to Repair Grub while dual booting ( win7 / ubuntu 11.10) \n\nI had installed Lubuntu on a PC with Windows XP and used dual boot for some time with no problems.\nSince I had almost abandoned Windows (kept it for printing...) I decided to resize its ntfs partition and add the free space to my Ubuntu space.\nTried that with a gparted stick and a live cd but would not work due to an issue related to the ntfs partition: gparted signaled with a red exclamation point that there was a problem with that partition. I read that a checkdisk might solve it but in the end used EaseUS in Windows to shrink (resize) the ntfs partition and create a new one (ext3) from the space left.\nAll seemed ok with that procedure: but resizing the partition and moving the data might have affected the grub file: or whatever the following message means, which I get when trying to start my pc:\nerror: file not found\ngrub rescue>\n\nBooting from a live cd I see, beside the shrinked windows partition and my old linux one, the newly created partition, containing a directory called lost+found that I cannot open.\nCan I fix the grub file and recover both my XP and Lubuntu installations?\n\nA: Short answer is yes. Use the LiveCD for that. Here is one description on how to repair lost grub.\nAnother way of doing it is this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into LiveCD (\"try out Ubuntu\"). Open a terminal and type\nsudo -i\n\nNow you are root.\n\n*Mount the system already installed on the hard drive. We pretend that the hard drive of your computer is /dev/sda, and that your Ubuntu is installed on the partition /dev/sda3 (that is, /dev/sda3 would normally get mounted to /). You can find that out by typing fdisk -l.\nmkdir -p /mnt\nmount /dev/sda3 /mnt\nmount -t proc none /proc /mnt/proc\nmount -o bind /dev /mnt/dev\n\n\n*Now you will chroot into the system that is installed on your hard drive and run update-grub to restore your grub settings.\nchroot /mnt /bin/bash\nupdate-grub\n\n", "Q: How linux kernel (used in Ubuntu) manages concurrent access to the data? I want to know how linux kernel used in Ubuntu manages concurrent access to shared data?\n\nA: Sir, I think you have a misconception about what locking is, and what mutex is for. Also, you have a misconception about what Ubuntu is. \nLet's start with the latter: Ubuntu is a Linux-based distribution. Any and all low level system architecture components are done by the Linux kernel. Ubuntu is just a way of putting different software pieces together, configuring, installing and updating them in a robust, uniform and user-friendly fashion. Your question, thus, refers to Linux, and not Ubuntu.\nMutexes are used to make sure that common resources (such as memory) are not by mistake accessed and modified at the same time. Since processes in general do not share such resources as memory (neither in Windows nor in Linux), the problem arises when one uses threads, and not processes. This is done using mutexes, you are right in that; here you will find some more informations about that. Linux uses POSIX threads. However, whether you -- as a programmer -- use mutexes or something else (like spinlocks or critical section), that depends on you, not on the system (see here), be that Windows or Linux.\nAs for processes, one needs file locking, but that is a different story. And yes, processes are implemented differently in Windows and in Linux (most importantly, in scheduling; see this presentation to shed some light on that).\n\nA: Before version 2.6, Linux was a nonpreemptive kernel. Now, it is fully preemptive, so a task can be preempted when it is running in the kernel.\nThe Linux kernel provides spinlocks and semaphores for locking in the kernel. On SMP machines the fundamental locking mechanism is a spinlock, and the kernel is designed so that the spinlock is held only for short durations. \nThis is not appropriate for single-processor machines. In single-processor machines, the kernel disables kernel preemption; and rather than releasing the spinlock, it eneables kernel preemption.\n", "Q: How to remove the Wine Windows Program Loader from dashboard launcher in ubuntu 12.04 \nPossible Duplicate:\nChange Icon of Wine Application in Unity Launcher \n\nUnlock from Launcher option is not appearing when i right click on the \"Wine Windows Program Loader\" in the dashboard, while it is appearing for all the other icons in the launcher\n\nA: What I can suggest is a workaround:\nFirst install dconf-tools package:\n$ sudo apt-get install dconf-tools\n\nRun dconf-editor using launcher or terminal.

Both are already configured to work well together.\n\n*System Configuration : There is a different configuration of the system so as to \"not-limit\" you audio/video processing.\n\n\nA: What Is Ubuntu Studio\nUbuntu Studio is an officially recognized flavour of Ubuntu aimed at dedicated multimedia production workstations. Based on the solid standard edition of Ubuntu, it comes with a suite of the best open source applications aimed at both multimedia enthusiasts as well as trained professionals. \nUbuntu Studio is completely free to use, modify and redistribute. Your only limitation is your imagination.\nTo better understand how Ubuntu Studio differs from the basic edition of Ubuntu, we will compare the two.\nUbuntu Studio vs. Ubuntu\nSome differences are immediately more evident between Ubuntu Studio and plain, vanilla Ubuntu. These would include a different theme and background, as well as a different battery of installed applications. But Ubuntu Studio is more than just Ubuntu with a slicker theme and extra packages installed. There are several subtle and pervasive differences.\nObvious Differences\nTheme and Artwork - Gone is the familiar brown and orange! Remember, we're creative human beings. Probably the most obvious difference is the new creative theme.\nMulti-Media Applications - Ubuntu Studio is chock-full of pre-installed audio, video and graphical applications including JACK, Ardour, GIMP and Kino.\nSubtle, Powerful Differences\nReal Time Kernel - Ubuntu Studio uses the Ingo Molnar PREEMPT patched real-time kernel (for more information about the real-time kernel, take a look at the RTWiki FAQ). This helps to reduce the amount of latency, which is extremely beneficial for audio work. The low levels of latency that can be achieved in Linux with the real-time kernel can also surpass those available under Windows and Mac.\nSystem Configuration - The Ubuntu Studio team has already configured the Ubuntu Studio system to help maximize the real-time kernel. The user is included in the audio group and the limits.conf file is specifically configured.\nJACK Sound System - Along with the ubiquitous Pulse Audio sound server, the powerful JACK sound server is also included in Ubuntu Studio. Both are already configured to work well together.\nsource\n", "Q: how to stop configuring network services My computer upon start up taking about 5 minute during boot time configuring network and allowing 60 seconds to complete its task. how to stop these services. it starting this services every time upon start up. could me help me on above issue.\n\nA: This is a know bug .

The system automatically detected this and set the resolution and I was able to use both this and the laptop's monitors independently.\nAfter installing Ubuntu on the hard drive alongside with Windows 7, I cannot get this to work anymore.\nThe system will let me mirror the monitors but when attempting to set the external monitor up as secondary, I am met with an error message that translates to something like \"The chosen display configuration could not be used - the virtual size does not correspond to the available sizes: Requested=(2304, 1024), minimum=(320, 200), maximum=(1280, 1280)\" followed by another error message that says something like \"GDBus.Error:org.gtk.GDBus.UnmappedGError.Quark._gnome_2drr_2derror_2dquark.Code3: requested virtuel size does not correspond to the available size: Requested=(2304, 1024), minimum=(320, 200), maximum=(1280, 1280)\".\nI have read something somewhere regarding returning to the native driver.

This will remove GRUB and the config files.\nsudo apt-get purge grub grub-pc grub-common\n\n*Install GRUB again.\nsudo apt-get install grub-common grub-pc\n\n\n*Reinstall the grub packages. \n\n\n\nHere is what will happen:\n\n\n*\n\n*You will be given the opportunity to add extra kernel options to the\nkernel line. If you don't know, you probably don't need them ; TAB to highlight \"OK\" and press ENTER.\n\n*Read the installation notes. TAB to \"OK\" to continue.\n\n*When presented with the device option, use the UP/DN keys to select\nthe correct drive (sdX).\n\n*Make sure the installation drive /dev/sdX has an asterisk (*) (or a red spot like in the image below) next to  it. \nIf it doesn't, highlight it by Up Arrow or Down Arrow and press\nthe Space Bar to select it (= Just highlighting it with the up/down arrows is not enough to select it, you have to add that asterisk/dot - depending on the type of terminal - by pressing Space Bar.)\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Do not select a partition ( example: [ ] /dev/sda5 , etc).\n\n*TAB to \"OK\" and press ENTER.

I work on both machines on those files.\nNow I would like to have a physical copy of those files on the laptop, so I can work off site. When the laptop gets back on the network I want it to synchronize the files back to the \"fileserver\". \nWhile in the network I want both machines to recognize changes in that folder by themself and synchronize them as needed. This setup should delete files that are deleted on either side and synchronize changes.\nI tried incron but failed to set it up so that the folder in question is synchronized recursively - seems that incron is unable to do that. I on the other side don't know what subfolders will be created and don't want to reconfigure the system every time I change something. \nI tried Dropbox of course, thats basically the effect I want to achieve - but it's limited in file size and online. The file synchronization even in a local network somehow never works without Dropbox being online. \nIs there any way to achieve some \"cloud like\" environment without much configuration? \n\nA: I can think of three options. \nZeroth, is Ubuntu One. It is similar to Dropbox but has more free space and better integration with Ubuntu. For example, you can sync any folder, as long as you have the same folders in each computer. (Ubuntu One is no longer available).\nFirst, is Unision. It is a local network solution and involves more manual intervention. You can run Unision \"server\" at the server end and \"clients\" on the laptops. When you are on your \"homebase\" network you will have to run Unison on the laptop to sync the files at login and before shutdown of each laptop. Unison is available on the Software Center.\nSecond, rsync / grsync. Rsync is a command line tool for synchronizing files and directories in \"Unix-like\" systems. The best way to use it is to write a script and set it to run automatically at login and before shutdown on the laptops. Grsync is a GUI for rsync that makes choosing various options a bit easier.\nHope this helps\n\nA: There is a number of tools that rely on rsync (Unison does at least partly). Unison is robust, feature rich and well tested. It has a gtk-GUI. Also it spawned a few scientific papers and is based on solid research - so very reliable. Bugfixes are still released but no major changes.\nConduit (see this article for info) could just be the easy-to-use solution. It is only good if it its not too many PCs we're talking about.. Unfortunately it seems stagnant and is not developed further but I had good results.\nAlso NFS shares cache data you recently used offline but they are a hassle to configure.\nEveryone who cares for privacy and integrity and mentions Dropbox should drop dead and use Spider Oak instead. Syncany looks very promising as far as cloud storage goes.\n", "Q: Unable to upgrade 11.04 to 11.10 I have Ubuntu 11.04 installed in my laptop and tried to upgrade it by opening the update manager and  and making the necessary settings in settings - updates - release upgrade - normal releases and then hitting the check button.

I have Ubuntu 12.04 installed on an SDHC card (only one ext2 partition, no swap).  When I suspend using pm-suspend, my root filesystem is mounted read-only.  I am currently \"fixing\" this with the following file:\n/etc/pm/sleep.d/99_make_disk_rw:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nmount -o remount,rw /\n\nBut the disk is marked as needing an fsck on reboot.  How can I prevent the filesystem from being mounted read-only or whatever is going wrong here.\nUpdate: It looks like it is getting mounted read-only because an error occurred.  I have changed the mount options for / in /etc/fstab to noatime,nodiratime,errors=continue and it no longer mounts the SDHC card as read-only after it resumes.  So the problem is happening when it suspends, not when it resumes as I had thought.\nI checked /sys/bus/usb/devices/1-4/power/persist and it is set to 1.

There was an ext2 bug that was causing this problem but I thought it was fixed, or at least patched.\nThe file system is being flagged as inconsistent because of the metadata buffers, hence the mounting as R/O and the need for a disk check.

Now just clicking the video file will make it play using your custom parameters, but will leave unaffected any other video file that vlc plays. \nThis is the quickest way to associate your launcher with the filetype, but to do it manually you would edit ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list and add the name of your launcher. As an example, you would add video/mp4=vlcmp4.desktop to the [Default Applications] section and the [Added Associations list] section should have video/mp4=vlc.desktop;vlcmp4.desktop;.\nMore information on .desktop files and launchers is here at the Ubuntu help pages.\n", "Q: automount USB drive in VirtualBox via udev in ubuntu 12.04 How do you automount usb drives directly to VirtualBox in ubuntu 12.04\n\nA: I managed to solve this myself.\nThis is only for USB Storage (which I needed)\nRemember to create a usb filter on your Vbox machine that takes all USB devices and makes it available.\nCreate an udev rule file in /etc/udev/rules.d\nI called mine 80-automnt.rules\nContents:\nDRIVERS==\"usb-storage\", RUN+=\"/etc/udev/vboxusb.sh %p\"\n\nCreate the /etc/udev/vboxusb.sh file.\nContents:\n#!/bin/bash\nvendorid=`/sbin/udevadm info --query=all --path=$1 | sed 's/E: -*//g' | grep \"ID_VENDOR_ID\" | awk -F\"=\" '{print $2}'`\nmodelid=`/sbin/udevadm info --query=all --path=$1 | sed 's/E: -*//g' | grep \"ID_MODEL_ID\" | awk -F\"=\" '{print $2}'`\n\nset `/usr/bin/lsusb -d $vendorid:$modelid | sed 's/:.*//g'`\nwhile [ ! -z \"$1\" ]; do\n  case $1 in\n    Bus) shift\n    busdevice=\"$1\"\n    ;;\n    Device) shift\n    busdevice=${busdevice}\"/$1\"\n    ;;\n  esac\n  shift\ndone\nif [ ! -z \"$busdevice\" ]; then\n  address=$(VBoxManage list usbhost | grep \"Address:\" | grep $busdevice | sed -e 's/Address://' -e 's/^[ \\t]*//')\n  if [ ! -z \"$address\" ]; then\n    su - YOURVBOXUSER -c \"VBoxManage controlvm YOURVBOXNAME usbattach $address\"\n  fi\nfi\n\n\nA: As I understood, there are two versions of Virtualbox.

For output streams it is set by\n           default to the number of input audio channels. For input streams\n           this option only makes sense for audio grabbing devices and raw\n           demuxers and is mapped to the corresponding demuxer options.\n\nSo you basic command line would be:\navconv -i <input file> -ac 2 <output file>.wav\n\nYou may also play with downmixing settings for the AC3 decoder, ie, the options where you can configure how the 6 channels from 5.1 will be merged (downmixed) into the 2 of stereo. Check for -dmix_mode and the -*mixlev* family of options under the Audio Encoders / ac3 section of the manual\n\nA: I don't know if avconv supports Dolby Pro Logic II, but ffmpeg does.

But ideally you should fix this. I think the issue is this that your Apache and libapache2-php5-mod have been installed via ubuntu packages while you have compiled php from source. When you installed libapache2-php5-mod via apt-get install, it would have taken the relevant php package from the repo as a dependency, as seen in packages.ubuntu.com/hardy/libapache2-mod-php5 You will need to uninstall Apache, and then install apache from source instead of using the ubuntu repos to do what you wish to do.\nI recommend you not to install PHP from source, but to use the PPA approach from above.\n", "Q: Picture but no sound when connecting to a TV I get a good image of the desktop on the TV, but no sound, I'm using a VGA and audio cables to connect a Samsung Netbook to a samsung TV - do I need to do something on the netbook?\nAndy Murray is in the US open final and we have no sound - please help!\n\nA: You may need to open Sound Settings and tell it to use the headphones or lineout (depending on which you used).

This filter is simply selected, so it's details are automatically determined by VirtualBox and proprietary: it has FJ DocuPrint P205b values.  The VirtualBox Devices > USB menu has the USB printer device checked, which I take to mean that it is passed through from the host to the guest.  The VirtualBox task bar shows it is aware of the USB device when the cursor hovers over the USB icon.\n\n\nThe problem is that often print jobs will sit in the print queue and nothing comes out of the printer.  The printer status for the first item in the queue will be Printing even though nothing happens.  Then upon rebooting Windows, the print jobs get printed, seemingly simultaneous to the rebooting process; that is as Windows reloads.\nOne way to avoid this problem is to boot Windows with the printer cable attached, and then submit the print jobs. In this scenario, the print jobs get printed in a timely manner.  Perhaps VirtualBox has a problem with USB being plug-n-play and hot pluggable.  Windows standing alone does not have this problem.  I know this because I have installed and used this printer driver on several Windows-only as well as Grub dual-boot systems many times.  This problem has only been seen inside VirtualBox, and as I said my VirtualBox is on Ubuntu.\nIt's not convenient to have the printer plugged in when Windows boots because: One, this is a laptop, and Two, I may boot Windows for a purpose other than printing and not anticipate needing to print.  \nAre there any recommendable fixes for this problem?\nEdit When there are jobs stuck in the print queue, go to the VirtualBox menu to select Devices > USB Devices and cycle the state of the USB device that is the Fuji Xerox DocuPrint P205b. That is to say: uncheck and then check the device. This will cause the queued print jobs to complete, sometimes.  I have had very limited success with this workaround.\n\nA: On the VirtualBox menu select Devices > USB Devices and cycle the state of the USB device that is the Fuji Xerox DocuPrint P205b.

My headset broke recently and now only left side of it works. In some songs, there are parts that are only played through the right side and since my right side doesn't work, I can't hear them. I want to set the sound so it only plays on the left side.

How can I do this?\n\nA: I found the solution at ubuntuforums.org, here's the link:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1384860&p=8689164\nBasically you switch from pulseaudio to alsa, and you enable something called crosstalk, that allows you to hear both channels without 'super imposing' them.\n\nA: Taken from https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-control-center/+bug/942780\n\nThe mono profile is usually thrown away as most hardware does not\n  support opening it in one-channel mode only.\nYou can configure pulseaudio to do what you suggest by modifying\n  /usr/share/pulseaudio/alsa-mixer/profile-sets/default.conf and\n  /usr/share/pulseaudio/alsa-mixer/profile-sets/extra-hdmi.conf\nIn both files, go to the [Mapping analog-mono] section and change\n  channel-map = mono to channel-map = mono,mono\nThis will take effect the next time pulseaudio is restarted (e g by\n  rebooting).\nThe major question is however, whether we should do this by default,\n  and if we risk regressing other hardware by doing so.\n\n-- David Henningsson (diwic)\n", "Q: File share not able to be seen except by creator I have a Samba file share that I can see from a windows machine.  The problem is when I create files or folders, only the creator machine can see them.  I can create Windows files but cannot see them in Ubuntu.  I can create files on Ubuntu but cannot see them in Windows.  I am thinking it is some permissions in the smb.conf file but am having issues figuring it out.  \nMy main goal is to use this as a media server so the windows boxes, tv and dvd players should be able to connect and see the files without passwords.  Also I'd like to upload content from any machine and have it accessible to any machine on the network.  \n\nA: This sounds like an issue with your smb.conf file.

Also, check out the SMART tools to detect when something is going wrong.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Smartmontools\n\nA: I would recommend switching to SSD's if you are not using them. In conditions where the laptops are moving around, SSDs will be less prone to failure. Small SSDs will usually be in the sub $100 range.\nIf your environment is very dusty, you should also have some sort of dust filter on your enclosure, although this can be kind of hard to do using laptops.

So, if there is some problem with my computer, be it hardware or software, what are the major log files and where are they located?\nAlso, is there a generic location where log files of the other packages might be located?\n\nA: To view system and application logs, you can use the \"Log File Viewer\" application.  Hit F2 to open your dash, then type log and select the Log File Viewer application.\nMore information:\nhttp://www.howtogeek.com/117878/how-to-view-write-to-system-log-files-on-ubuntu/\n\nA: In the screenshot below most of the important logs from /var/log are shown. In that location there are often other folders from other applications such as samba or apache2 if you have it installed. \nTo watch a log in real time you can use gnome-system-log or, for example, use\n tail -f /var/log/kern.log\n\nAll logs can be analysed more easily either with the filter option in gnome-system-log or by using grep to search for a particular term. For example, if I wanted to find references to my SiS hardware, I could enter:\ngrep -i SiS /var/log/kern.log\n\nMost of the logs in the screenshot are self-explanatory, however, here's a few quick notes:\n\n\n*\n\n*auth.log deals with all privileged actions such as when you use sudo in the terminal or run gui programs such as synaptic.\n\n*kern.log records all kernel activity and can be useful for diagnosing errors with hardware.\n\n*dpkg.log is a very detailed account of packages installed\n\n*syslog contains both information from the kernel and OS information \n\n*xorg.log contains information on the (largely automatic) setup of your display \n\n*udev is particularly useful as it contains some details about the setup of hardware that could be useful to record for the future.\n\n*history.log (as seen in the screenshot) is from /var/log/apt and contains the history of your updates and installations.\n\n\n\n\nA: All log files are located in /var/log directory. In that directory, there are specific files for each type of logs. For example, system logs, such as kernel activities are logged in syslog file.\nSome of the most common log files in that directory is :\n\n*\n\n*In directory apt there is a file history.log which saves all the package installation and removal information even the initial system build as Live CD. You can open this file to see this very interesting file.\n\n\n*In directory dist-upgrade there is a file apt.log which logs the information during distribution upgrades\n\n\n*In directory installer the log files which are created during installation can be found.\n\n\n*There is an apport.log file which saves information about crashes in your system and reporting them.\n\n\n*The file auth.log includes information about the authentication activities such as when you authenticate as root user via sudo.\n\n\n*The file dpkg.log saves the low level details of package installation and removal related with dpkg. You might be aware that the apt system depends on dpkg for package installation and removal.\n\n\n*boot.log includes information of each booting.\n\n\n*kern.log saves kernel information such as warnings, errors etc.\n\n\n*alternatives.log includes the history of all the alternatives set by various packages and their removal via update-alternatives command.\n\n\n*Another important log file is Xorg.log which include information about the graphics driver, its failures, warnings etc.\nSome other types of Log files may be there depending on your installed packages. For example, My system also includes a log files epoptes.log which will only be there if you install epoptes package.\nChanges after systemd\nWith the advent of systemd, logging is mostly handled by journalctl utility and store the logs in binary format in /var/lib/systemd/catalog/database file. This file enumerates all logs including kernel, boot and application logs and provides required logs via journalctl utility.\nHere is a good article on journalctl on how you can use it to fetch required log info.\nhttps://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-journalctl-to-view-and-manipulate-systemd-logs#setting-the-system-time\n", "Q: How to access mounted file systems as a guest user? In Ubuntu 11.04 I could mount a file system in /media/foo and run chown guest:guest /media/foo/bar -R and have full access in the guest account. After the upgrade to 12.04 I changed my routine to reflect the new guest usernames (chown guest[id]:guest[id] /media/foo/bar -R) but I still can't access it as a guest user, as I don't have access privileges to /media as guest:\n\nls: cannot open directory /media: Permission denied\n\n(Very interestingly this does work if I su into the guest account as root). I understand this is meant as a security measure but I don't see how it is done. ls -l / reports \ndrwxr-xr-x  11 root root  4096 Sep  9 22:28 media\n\nThus my two questions: How does this restriction work and how can I access a mounted file system as a guest user, ideally without allowing access to all of the other mounted file systems?\n\nA: Access to /media is restricted by the AppArmor profile /etc/apparmor.d/lightdm-guest-session. There are two exceptions (lines 31 and 32):\n owner /media/ r,\n owner /media/** rmwlixk,  # we want access to USB sticks and the like\n\nThat allows access if /media/foo is owned by guest[id], which is the first alternative to solve my problem. The downside is that the guest account can create arbitrary directories and files in the root of /media/foo. I decided to explicitly poke a hole for /media/foo/bar and added the lines:\n owner /media/foo/bar rw,\n\nA description of the syntax can be found here: http://doc.opensuse.org/documentation/html/openSUSE/opensuse-security/cha.apparmor.profiles.html\nTo the best of my knowledge this only allows the guest session to access /media/foo/bar and only if guest[id] is the owner of bar. Note that guest[id] still cannot access /media/foo itself. Thus ls /media/foo will fail, but ls /media/foo/bar works.\nLastly reload the profile for the changes to take effect:\n sudo apparmor_parser -r /etc/apparmor.d/lightdm-guest-session\n\n", "Q: Automatically Enable Secondary Display When Connected At my desk, I generally have a laptop plugged into an external monitor (cloned display) with the lid of the laptop closed.\nRight now each time plug in the secondary display, I have to open the display properties, enable the display, select that it should be a clone, apply then confirm it worked.\nAny way to automate that?

I had this problem when connecting to an Ubuntu system which has no screen (used to have a Dell 24\" screen, but it was needed elsewhere).  I'm not bright enough to know why this works, but here is a series of command which works for me - no file editing required.\nNote: that when you reboot, you need to run them again.  I suggest a shell script.\ngtf 1920 1200 60 -x\nxrandr --newmode \"1920x1200_60.00\"  193.16  1920 2048 2256 2592  1200 1201 1204 1242  -HSync +Vsync\nxrandr --addmode VGA1 1920x1200_60.00\nxrandr --output VGA1 --mode 1920x1200_60.00\n\n\nA: Try installing arandr to setup your xrandr config with a GUI. This allows you to see all the supported options for each screen, select and apply (seeing the result) and keep the one that best fits your needs\nsudo apt install arandr\n\nThen setup you your displays' resolution, orientation and position and finally save the config.\nYou can see its output is a shell script (.sh) usually on ~/.screenlayout.\n\nA: I added the above lines (got slightly different output from the gtf command) to the .xprofile file in my home directory.

It's from a couple of years ago. When testing this I wasn't able to set the Virtual line past the maximum screen size given by xrandr -q, however. With my driver and hardware that value was an already quite large 8192x8192, however.\nYou could experiment by adding this as /etc/X11/xorg.conf, for example:\n\nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier \"My Screen\"\n    Subsection \"Display\"\n        Virtual 2048 2048\n    EndSubSection\nEndSection\nYou will probably not see a /etc/X11/xorg.conf as today's video drivers will attempt to determine reasonable defaults for everything and modern distributions leave that file out. It will be used if present, however. \nIf you do already have an /etc/X11/xorg.conf file you can try adding the above Virtual line to the Display subsection of its Screen section\nI suggest you test this with a command line editor since there's some chance it will mess up your ability to sign on with the Ubuntu GUI and you may need to do Alt-Ctrl-F1, sign on, and edit (or remove) the file using command line tools. Any errors should in /var/log/Xorg.0.log or /var/log/Xorg.1.log. \nIn fact, you could and should test this by logging into an additional userid on your system (without logging out of your usual userid) and checking from the new session, that way you can use Alt-Ctrl-F7 to go back to your working GUI if there's trouble. In the case that you are using an additional user id to log in without logging out of the first the appropriate log will be /var/log/Xorg.1.log. Don't log out of the working session or boot until you have a working xorg.conf or have again removed it.\n\nUse a Different Graphics Driver\nAnother article I read resolved this problem by switching drivers, but I see from your question that the Additional Drivers program doesn't give you any alternatives. (I assume that's what you mean above when you mention the \"Hardware Drivers dialog\". Unless you change drivers with the Additional Drivers program you will use a driver the kernel deems appropriate for your video card or the video logic on your motherboard.\nFor the OP, from what you described in your comments above it appears that your system should be using the radeon driver, but isn't. I use the radeon driver and commonly set my horizontal resolution to 1920 (max for the driver/card seems to be 8192). The vesa and fb drivers are very basic drivers for old hardware--old enough that monitors of that era didn't have very large displays.\n\nUpgrade Ubuntu\nIf you are running a computer newer than the Ubuntu version you have installed and, in particular, its Linux kernel it's completely possible that the kernel won't recognize your graphics adapter. If that's the case you need to upgrade your Ubuntu software which contains support for your equipment.\nSince he can't get fglrx to run, this unfortunately  is the case for ysap. Because of the newness of this equipment relative to the release ysap is running, there is no support for [1002.9802] in the Lucid (or Maverick either) Linux kernel. First support for this equipment appeared in the Natty 2.6.38 kernel. To check for support for a particular device in kernel modules you can go to /lib/modules/kernel-version/module.alias file and search for the adapter's value. For that equipment:\ngrep v00001002d00009802 /lib/modules/2.6.38-10-generic/modules.alias\n\nTo check Natty's kernel support. It replies:\nalias pci:v00001002d00009802sv*sd*bc*sc*i* radeon\n\nAs a test, you can try to boot a live CD on the system and try to set the resolution you desire in that environment (click on Try Ubuntu, rather than Install).\nGetting appropriate driver support can also enable modern graphics facilities like direct rendering and OpenGL support, greatly improving performance and aesthetics.\nFor a personal computer you may also be able to use an upgraded kernel if a compatible one is available for your version of Ubuntu. For a production computer it may be necessary to upgrade Ubuntu to a newer version, when available, for the sake of reliability and robustness.\n\nA: I have found this article useful to me to set up/ configure hdmi resolution using a vga-hdmi converter.\nI have been doing the script as simple as:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nxrandr --newmode \"1920x1080_60.00\"  172.80  1920 2040 2248 2576  1080 1081 1084$\nxrandr --addmode VGA-1 1920x1080_60.00\nxrandr --output VGA-1 --mode 1920x1080_60.00\n\nIt is put in /usr/local/bin/script_name.\nThen, I add it in \"session and start\"\nIt works as soon as I log in my account.\nQuestion: how can I run this script as system_wide and do not need to add script on every single account in system?\n\nA: #!/bin/bash\n\n\n#xrandr -q\n\n#cvt 1440 900  (Resolution you want,without x)\n\n# 1440x900 59.89 Hz (CVT 1.30MA) hsync: 55.93 kHz; pclk: 106.50 MHz\nModeline \"1440x900_60.00\"  106.50  1440 1528 1672 1904  900 903 909 934 -hsync +vsync\n\n\n\n\n#xrandr --newmode \"1440x900_60.00\"  106.50  1440 1528 1672 1904  900 903 909 934 -hsync +vsync     (copy from \"1440x900---------------------------- +vsync)\n\n#xrandr --addmove DP-1(your display name) 1440x900_60.00\n\nThen check you display setting ,and the resolution you added they will be appear in your setting.....Thanks\n", "Q: Problem resuming after suspend So, the computer suspends just fine. When I try to wake it up, the screen flickers a bit, and then there's a black screen with all kinds of awful colored lines all over it.

The only way to fix it seems to be doing a hard power off.\nMy graphics card is Nvidia, but that's all I really know about it.\nMy computer is a HP Pavillion dv9000.\n\nA: You should install the nVidia drivers. A program or section of software center (depending on Ubuntu version) is available for your use. Within that utility, select and activate the nvidia driver(current is optimal but past versions can be selected if the current is broken for your setup). Authenticate if prompted to, and reboot when finished.\n\nDid you try to install the nVidia drivers by opening a program called Additional Drivers and activating a driver? It's OK if you're unsure, but it is something that is only done by manual user request and can cause changes that can cause the issue you are having. \n\n\nA: Try experimenting the arguments of pm-suspend, for example, to get the command line options, run as root\n# pm-suspend --help\nThen try, for example, \n# pm-suspend --quirk-radeon-off\nIf some quirk works for you, then all you have to do is to edit /usr/sbin/pm-suspend and set the variable PM_CMDLINE to PM_CMDLINE=\"--quirk-radeon-off $@\" or whatever option works for you.\n", "Q: auto-remove of files from U1 account as soon removed from U1 folder I have some personal photos and I doesn't like to disclose it to anyone. But I need a copy of each of them in U1. So, I put all of them in the U1 folder and they were uploaded to my U1 account. Then I removed all of them from the folder. Because, someone may see them when they open the U1 folder. I believed that copies of these photos reside in the U1 account. So, I logged in to U1 website via browser to view them. But I couldn't see any of them there(account was synced with my folder!). But i have a backup copy of these. So, I didn't lose them. Now, I need a copy in U1 account of these photos. But it should not be removed from the U1 account as soon as i removed from the U1 folder. So, can you help me to solve the problem?\n\nA: Ubuntu One (U1) is a file and folder synchronization service. It is designed to keep the files in our computers in sync with the files in the cloud. It is not designed to be a file storage and backup system. So if you delete the files from your local folder they will be deleted from the U1 server and any other computers you have U1 signed on with the same account.\nTo do what you want, remove the computer (Remove Device) from Ubuntu One's account. You can do this by going to the Ubuntu One web page, signing in, and going to the \"My Account.\"\nThen Ubuntu One will not sync files from this computer. You can still upload the photos and other files in Ubuntu One using the web interface. \nHowever, if you have other computers, phones etc. associated with this Ubuntu One account, the photos and files will be downloaded in those devices.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Assigning middle button to left scroll, Logitech M505 I have a Logitech m505 mouse, which works fine with my ubuntu 12.04.  However, the middle button is so hard to press down that in windows I had assigned it to left scroll with the logitech driver.  So if I was to open a link in a new tab, I'd pull the scroll button to the left.  (I should also note that the mouse I have has a middle button that scrolls up and down, can be pressed down, and also can be \"pulled\" to left and right).\nCan I do this with xbindkeys, for instance?  I think I know all the info that I need about the mouse: numbers of buttons, device name, etc.\nI'd appreciate if you could help.\n\nA: I figured out how to do this.\nFirst use xev to find out the \"button numbers\".  Type xev in the terminal, and click on the buttons of your mouse in the newly opened white window.  Many lines appear in the terminal, such as these:\nButtonPress event, serial 36, synthetic NO, window 0x3c00001,\nroot 0x15d, subw 0x3c00002, time 10181966, (30,51), root:(1208,104),\nstate 0x10, button 1, same_screen YES\n\nThe \"button 1\" is the number, in my case, for left-click.\nI wanted to switch left scroll with middle button, which were 6 and 2 respectively.\nThe next step is to learn the id of the input device:\nxinput list\n\nMine had such an entry for the Logitech mouse:\nLogitech Unifying Device. Wireless PID:101d id=10   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n\nThen, I type the following to map button 2 to 6, and vice versa, for the input device with id 10:\nxinput set-button-map 10 1 6 3 4 5 2 7\n\nThis is only going to be temporary, and be gone when you reboot.\nTo make it permanent, you could edit the xorg.conf file, but doing so caused problems for me, and the system did not boot. Instead, I created an entry in startup applications, writing the last xinput command as the command.\nThis has one drawback -- the id has to stay the same. However, I do not know when and why it changes, as mine seem to stay the same. If I was to guess, I'd say that plugging the usb receiver in another usb port could change the id.  I am not sure.\n", "Q: Initial download (pre installation) happening at dial-up speed. Only 2+ hours to go! I am new to ubuntu and attempting to download it to my desktop (wired) PC so I can create a CD so I can install it on my laptop PC (which is basically nonfunctional). Although I have a fast Internet connection, this download is moving at 72kbps or so. I've tried turning off the firewall, resetting the modem and router, rebooting the computer, and nothing works. \nWhat else should I try, or is this really going to take nearly 3 hours?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: It is not at dialup speeds. It is at least 8 times faster. Dial-up is in (kilo)bits per second, but the number you are getting is in (kilo)bytes per second. It will indeed take 3 hours but if your connection is DSL or low-end cable, it is using a good amount of your bandwidth efficiently.\nWhy is this?\nYou are getting bits(b) and bytes (B) confused. There are 8 bits in one byte. Therefore, a 1Mbps connection should ideally get 125Kbps, but the speed will be anywhere from 50-100 KBps. On dial-up, it would take over 24 hours.\n700MB at ~70KBps\n≈700000KB at 70KBps\n≈10000Sec\n≈3 hours\n\n", "Q: What are the F6 options during installation? What is the meaning of different options in the F6 context menu of Ubuntu installation dvd ? \ni.e.\nacpi=off\nnoapic\nnolapic\nedd=on\nnodmraid\nnomodeset\nFree Software only\n\nHow do they affect the installation?\n\nA: acpi=off or noacpi\nDisables the \"Advanced Configuration and Power Interface\" or ACPI which is used for power management in general (Fan speeds, sleep states...). In some cases like running the installer from a Live USB or booting a laptop it is needed for compatibility with the motherboard and how it handles/mishandles ACPI. Just in case you are wondering, the difference between acpi=off and noacpi is that acpi=... can accept more values. For example acpit=force,irq.\nnoapic\nDisables the \"Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controllers\" which is used to resolve hardware conflicts for interrupts. The effects of using a combination between noacpi and noapic depends on the hardware. In some cases, disabling both will solve booting problems, in others it will create problems. Suggestions are that you try one at a time.\nnolapic\nDisables the \"Local Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controler\" which applies to newer CPUs and they are handled. nolapic is commonly used when you are using old hardware. Many times even withnoapic`.\nedd=on\nEnables the \"Enhanced Disk Drive\" service which is used by VERY old motherboards to provide support for hard drives, specially ones that go beyond the 32GB barrier, which by todays standards is like the size of a normal flash drive. Anyway, if you have an old motherboard and a HDD bigger than 32GB, then use edd=on.\nnodmraid\nDisables the \"Device Mapper RAID\" which is used for everything related to RAIDs. Not recommended if you want to use RAIDs.\nnomodeset\nDisables the video from using modesets which are used for example for better resolutions and graphics. If you are using an old video card, old monitor or both, then activate this mode.\nFree Software Only\nSimple eliminates all options to install restricted drivers, codecs or in general any proprietary software. This is all for legal purposes and/or if you want to have a 100% free software environment, but note that you will not be able to listen to MP3 songs, use your Nvidia or Ati card to full potential or watch H264 or Flash videos. You will need to install them afterwards when you finish with the Ubuntu install process.\nFor more information here are 2 good links about the Kernel parameters:\nYou can see all Kernel parameters here: http://fxr.watson.org/fxr/source/Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt?v=linux-2.6\nUbuntu used parameters are here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootOptions#Common_Kernel_Options\n\nA: acpi=off: Disables ACPI which is used for power management and actually turning off power after the shutdown. This may help with compatibility with motherboards which misuse ACPI.\nnoapic: Disables Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller. This is used to resolve hardware conflicts for interrupts, but may itself cause a conflict. Use of this option may disable some hardware that enters a conflict without an APIC.\nnolapic is very similar, but disables a different (newer) kind of APIC called a LAPIC(Local Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller)\nedd=on enables the EDD probe(Enhanced Disk Drive), used by motherboards to provide more functionality to disk drives\nnodmraid disables dmraid which is used for RAID purposes but may cause empty disks to appear even if they are fully partitioned, possibly with the wrong size.\nnomodeset keeps the video driver from performing modesets which are used to bring the graphics card to an enhanced state, but due to incompatibility, may cause display issues.\nFree Software Only is used for legal purposes and will not load restricted drivers or codecs. Use if your jurisdiction disallows the use of restricted software without a license and you do not have one, or if you do not prefer to use closed-source or restricted components or code on your system. Certain codecs or hardware may be unusable.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootOptions#Common_Kernel_Options has a few other options.\n\nA: Option nodmraid only disables the drivers for \"FakeRaid\" (i.e. Nvidia or intel raid firmware on some SATA controllers). Setting this option may be required if some partitions show up in /dev/mapper/ like nvidia[somehash]. This may also cause some real partitions (/dev/sda1) to disappear if the dmraid driver decides those devices are used in a dm-raid.\nSo when you are going to use some real hardware raid controller or linux software raid (mdadm) then it is a good idea to disable dmraid.\n\nA: Newer versions of the \"Other options\" menu also include Expert mode, which is explained in the InstallMethods wiki:\n\nThis causes the installer to ask questions about virtually everything it does. It's supposed to be powerful rather than friendly, so the developers don't pay a lot of attention to UI warts in this mode; however, it should at least work to the point where you can complete an installation. If you like, you can try playing around with non-default answers to the questions it asks, and make sure its responses are appropriate.\n\n", "Q: Eclipse Juno, need root access everytime I change the configuration I am trying to install eclipse Juno on 12.04.

In other words, there isn't a physical button for Ubuntu just yet.  \nHope this helps!\n\nA: You don't have to install it just run it:\n\ntar -xvf eclipse-jee-juno-SR1-linux-gtk.tar.gz\ncd eclip\nchmod +x eclipse\n./eclipse\n\n\nA: I have installed Eclipse in following manner:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove current installation:\nsudo apt-get purge eclipse*\n\n\n*Install eclipse again with CDT\nsudo apt-get install eclipse eclipse-CDT\n\nAfter that remove, .eclipse folder from your home directory and run Eclipse and check your C/C++ project.\n\nA: Download the archive from the official website, unzip it in /opt/eclipse/ (or your preferred directory), and run the installer.\n\nA: Generally, these contains source files and as far as I know you'll have to manually install them using the commands.\n\n\n\n\nUbuntu software center can install only packaged files(i.e \".deb\").\nUbuntu software center can't install the source files that you have mentioned.\n\n\n\n\n", "Q: Running Windows 7 64bit on Raid 0 Can I install ubuntu 12.04 alternate from the CD (Full Complete Install) without tearing down my present Raid Configuration?\n\nA: That depends on your raid controller supporting Linux.\nMine does. It's a \"FakeRAID\" solution; one that offloads most of the work to the CPU. It's supported by a project called dmraid. To allow installation on it, all I had to do was boot to the live CD, opt for the \"Try Ubuntu\" option, sudo apt-get install dmraid and then run the installer.\nYou're asking about the alternate CD. I've honestly no idea how to approach things that way with regards to FakeRAID and I don't even know if your controller is FakeRAID because you haven't included any information. If it's some sort of on-motherboard solution it probably is.

I don't have the password and it won't let me update anything. I have downloaded 12.04 in order to re-install it and it tells me it isn't suitable for my processor.\nThe machine is a Dell latitude D505. I tried downloading the i386 version and on booting with the disc, I get:\nThis kernel requires features not present on CPU. pae. Unable to boot. \n\nAll I'm trying to do is to let software updater do it's stuff but as it asks for a password, I can't proceed. I've tried changing password in root shell but that doesn't work. \nAny ideas?\nNothing seems to be working with this problem, so maybe I'll just wait for the next official release and try again.\n\nA: Ubuntu doesn't have a root password by default. Actions that require root privileges are generally done via sudo which requires the password for your own account.\nIf you don't have the password for your user account, you can set one by rebooting in single user mode, which will give you a root shell. You can then type\npasswd yourname\n\nwhere yourname is your user account name. Then reboot in normal mode and you should be able to use the password you just set.\nInstructions for booting in single user mode can be found here.  (This isn't as big a security hole as it seems, since it requires physical access to the system; the bad guys can't get a single user shell remotely.)\nAnd as ObsessiveFOSS's answer says, you need an iso image that's appropriate for your CPU architecture, most commonly either \"i386\" or \"amd64\". Once you have an installation disk that's compatible with your architecture, you can install from scratch (wiping out everything you now have on the system), and you'll be able to set a password. If you do this, you won't need to boot into single user mode.

Is there some way to directly put the program in the background, without having to type bg?\nClarification: I want to put the program in the background when it is already running, without suspending it.\n\nA: I do not think it is possible to move a running program to background(while the process is still in running state).\nHowever there is an application called GNU-Screen,using which you can run any number of console-based applications--interactive command shells, curses-based applications, text editors, etc.--within a single terminal.\nHere is a nice tutorial on GNU-Screen.\nNote that it does not do exactly what you asked,but serves the purpose anyway.\nExample:\nHere is the implementation of what you asked using GNU-Screen.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Run screen\nYou will get details about the software.Press return.  \n\n*Now,you will see your normal terminal.However it is a window of screen.Type any command say vlc.

I know the normal way(sudo insmod, sudo rmmod), but we're not allowed to use sudo in school.\n\nA: First off, what module do you want to insert and why? Normally there is no need to manually remove / insert modules. By the way, creating a module is a different story, insmod and rmmod are for loading / unloading a particular module (created by someone else).\nOnce you got your reasons straight, and are sure that there is no other way... then go to your system administrator and ask politely. Explain clearly your reasons, and you have a chance to succeed. No joke: unless you want to go against all rules (and some laws, probably) and hack the machine belonging to your school, you will not acquire privileges granting you such a low level operation.\n\nA: Perhaps an easier way forward is to do the kernel development inside a virtual machine; I use virt-manager + kvm-qemu, but there are other options such as VirtualBox. This allow can then allow you to do all the development in a safe virtualized environment and maybe allowed by your system administrator.\n", "Q: Difference between 12.04 and 12.04.1 and boot problems I recently did a fresh install of Ubuntu 12.04 two days ago.  Or at least I thought it was 12.04, but actually 12.04.1.  Now I'm having errors popping up from the grub loader. Error: no video mode activated which was apparently resolved in this bug# 699802.  However these workarounds are for 11.xx and not working for me.  I never had these errors before with 12.04 and now I'm getting them.  What's the difference between 12.04 and 12.04.1?  \nOff the bat I notice that the kernels are different \n12.04   uses 3.2.0-26-generic-pae\n12.04.1 uses 3.2.0-29-generic\nafter an immediate sudo apt-get update upgrade\n12.04.1 uses 3.2.0-30-generic \nI have two other computers running 12.04 (not 12.04.1) and they're working fine.  The computer that I'm currently was working fine (with 12.04) previously too. \nShould I roll back my kernel to 3.2.0-26?\n\nA: Ubuntu 12.04.1 is just Ubuntu 12.04 but with all upgrades and fixed that have appeared between the official release and the time the new version popped out, all applied to it. So you can get to 12.04.1 in 2 ways (Same applies to any new version like 12.04.2, 12.04.3 and so on):\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the updated 12.04 (12.04.1) from the Ubuntu website and install it (Will be mentioned as the latest version)\n\n*Install the 12.04 that was released on April and do a massive upgrade from that version till today. That should get you to 12.04.1 or any other newer version.\nIn relation with your problem, you will need to include more information (Recommend another question for it that does not mix with this one since you are asking the difference between 12.04.1 and 12.04). Information like hardware type, dmesg output and most of the /var/log files that give any indications of a problem.\n", "Q: How to switch between Google Chrome beta and stable on Ubuntu?

So recently I have installed Ubuntu as an OS in addition to my Windows because it looked good and I have used it in the past and I liked it. Before I installed Ubuntu, they (the website) have given me a help list that shows that I will have the option of having Windows aside to Ubuntu (dual install), while I work with the Ubuntu OS. They told me that if I either put it in a CD or USB drive, I'll be okay.\nSo there I was, installing Ubuntu, saving the Ubuntu file on my USB drive first, then afterwards clicking it and therefore proceeded to install.\nThe problem is once I installed Ubuntu, it directed me to the 'login' page without giving me an option for dual-installing (you know, the language portion and so on). Now I tried both to suspend and shut off, and it seems like I cannot access my Windows files/account anymore and it really is unfortunate. \nNow I am FREAKING out, because this is a shared computer that my family uses (it's like a main computer in the house) and everyone's files are on this.

Sometimes I'd like to switch between windows using Alt-Tab or similar shortcut without the popup (showing window thumbnails). Is it possible in 12.04? Thanks.\n\nA: A quick look at the CompizConfig Settings Manager (CCSM) suggests this is not possible for the default Unity switcher. I don't see any settings there related to time-out, so I'm afraid the simple answer is \"no\", unless someone can tell you about hidden settings somewhere.\nWhat you could do is switch to an alternative switcher. In CCSM you can disable the Unity switcher and replace it with e.g. the Static Application Switcher. That one allows you to set the Popup Window Delay which enables you to hide the window list for the first X seconds. I've left it at the default value of 0.2, which is high enough for the popup not to show up if I know where the window I want is, but low enough to show the popup if I don't know where to find that window.\nJust keep in mind that this alternative switcher doesn't look as pretty as the default switcher. However, it does offer a wealth of other functions (for example, this one allows you to click the window you want to switch to). Also remember that CCSM can be a dangerous programme and might break Compiz if you select the wrong window.\nIf you want I could upload a screenshot, just let me know :)\n", "Q: How to clean and add options to the Open With list of apps After installing several PPAs (Wine, PoL) and opening several files with other apps (Like changing from Totem to VLC) I discovered that the Open With option had 2 problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*Many items on the list are duplicated (As seen on the image for \"A Wine Program\")\n\n*Sometimes the app I want to use to open is not shown there (For example, Virtualbox or VLC)\nSo how can I edit this list to clean the duplicates and add missing apps from the list.\n\n\nA: It should be enough to edit the folder under\n ~/.local/share/applications\n\nYou may find numinous listings for wine there and can edit it.

Everything upgraded without error. However, there is an odd issue with grub and the new kernel (3.2.0-30-generic). After grub boots, the system says \"Starting up...\" and switches to a text-based full-screen progress bar (with 4 dots) for 20 seconds, then it drops to a BusyBox shell. No matter how long I wait, I can simply type \"exit\" and the boot process switches back to the text-based full-screen boot progress bar and ultimately boots successfully. No errors at all.\n\nMy kernel in 10.04 (2.6.32.22), which I still have, will boot without triggering the BusyBox prompt. I have already tried running update-initramfs and my LVM volume UUID's match what's in /etc/fstab.\nIs there a log I could check to see why the new kernel thinks it needs to enter the BusyBox shell, since the initramfs shell doesn't offer any clues and it boots fine after exiting the shell?\n\nA: I finally found my answer not long after posting. This Ubuntu bug report suggested to remove the \"quiet\" and \"splash\" options from the boot arguments. I did and the error was made known:\n\nApparently the new kernel detects degraded software RAID volumes and will display a prompt with a 20 second timeout behind the splash screen. It's unfortunate it cannot be seen normally, and it looks like the problem has been reported (and fixed) in a past release. Also, the prompt did not accept my input. The default \"N\" response also didn't happen, since the RAID volumes actually do start (degraded).\nIf anyone is wondering, I was previously using software RAID with this system, but switched to a hardware RAID later and never went through the unnecessary risk of removing the software RAID from a working system.\nHopefully this info will help anyone else with a similar invisible boot problem.\n", "Q: How do I try the Ubuntu LiveCD inside Windows?

The current Ubuntu installation is far too customized to my needs to lose it to a boot manager issue! Any help is much appreciated!\n\nA: The GRUB needs to reside in front of all partitions on the device, therefore you should run\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda\n\nwhereas using /dev/sda3 would install it only to the third partition. See the guide Recovering Ubuntu After Installing Windows you referred to:\n\nFrom here, find only the drive name, ignore the partition number, that is, for partitions labeled \"root\", \"data2\", \"fat\", \"home\" and \"swap\" it's all still just sda. This is due to the fact that GRUB is installed in the MBR of the drive, and not on a partition.\n\n\nA: You might have to run \nsudo grub-install /dev/sda\n\ninstead. It will find your /boot/ folder on any of the partitions.\nIf this does not work, you can try the following (assuming you do not have a separate boot partition, as it should show from your commands):\nBoot into the live cd and open a terminal.\nsudo mount /dev/sda3 /mnt\n\nThis will mount your ubuntu install to /mnt\nThen run this command\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda --root-directory=/mnt/boot/\n\nThis will tell grub that it should install grub to sda, and that it should not look for /boot/, as this is located on sda3.\n", "Q: Source code for Layout Based Switcher in KDE?

In fact, this is already the case for ls as default this is aliased as ls --color=auto\nCreate a file called '~/.bash_aliases' and enter the following line\nalias ls='ls | more'\n\nNow when you type ls in your terminal, it will instead execute ls | more.\nIn this case it does has an issue with parameters. ls /some/directory will not work anymore because the parameters are applied to more instead of ls (ls | more /some/directory will be executed)\n", "Q: Swap front panel audio channels only Does anyone knows how to swap the channels of the front panel audio only. I found some solutions to swap left-right in general. But my problem is, that the output from the backward jack is correct and the front panel audio is reversed.\n\nA: To me this strongly suggests an incorrectly wired jack or the pin header connector. I would not expect this to be software related.\nRegardless of the cause, the fix is pretty simple if you're happy opening up the computer. There should be a 4-pin female connector coming off the headphone jack, connected to the motherboard (or the sound card - if sound isn't onboard). Occasionally — when the manufacturer is a sadist — these connectors will be individual.\nAnyway, the game is simple: reverse the connector(s). They need to plug into the same pins, just the other way around.\n\nVery occasionally these cables are part of a bigger-than-4-pin block. These carry other things (like USB, microphone, etc). In this case it's not suitable to reverse the block and it's likely that won't be possible. You're left with two choices:\n\n\n*\n\n*Rewire the block: Most of these blocks are just compression jibs. Just poking them out from the connector side should work. Reverse the headphone wires.\n\n*Resolder the jack: Possibly the hardest route. Swap the left and right terminals.\nBoth these options could invalidate your warranty if something goes wrong.\n\nIf when you look at things this 4-pin thing I'm warbling on about doesn't exist at all or is part of something else I haven't described, get the motherboard make/model and get a manual for it.\nEvery motherboard I've ever owned (and I'm in double figures) has had details about how the audio is wired in. Just note that this has nothing to do with the \"PC Speaker\" header; that's just for beeps and squeaks.\n\nOh and if it's a new computer (bought from somewhere who have real, on-site people) you could take it back in and have them sort the connector. If it's a box company, you'll be without a computer for weeks so I'd just do it myself.\n", "Q: Can I safely reinstall PCManFM in Lubuntu desktop? I seem to have some problems with pcmanfm (openbox took over my desktop) and I would like to reinstall in Synaptic but it says it wants to remove (reinstall eventually) lubuntu-core, lubuntu-default settings and lubuntu-desktop. Is that safe?\nAfter installing lxde and lxde-core, uninstalling pcmanfm involves removing them too.\n\nA: As you said you want to remove and eventually reinstall (if I correctly understand your question) I would say, it is okay to do so. \nAlso note, lubuntu-desktop, lubuntu-core are metapackge which actually doesn't install anything (those packages are used to pull other packages) and lubuntu-default-settings is used to set the default settings of Lubuntu, such as default background, theme, icon-theme, keyboard shortcuts and others.\nYou said, when you wanted to remove pcmanfm, synaptic said, it will also remove lubuntu-desktop, lubuntu-core, lubuntu-default-settings, lxde and lxde-core. This is normal since package pcmanfm is a dependency (you may say required package) for those packages and when you tried to remove it, there is no reason to keep those packages. (Because those packages wouldn't install without pcmanfm). \nIf you really wanted to reinstall pcmanfm and you have another DE such as Xfce or KDE or Unity (GNOME), I recommend you to switch to that DE and run this command in a terminal to remove and reinstall the packages.\nsudo apt-get --purge remove pcmanfm\n\nThis will remove pcmanfm, those other five packages with all of their configuration files. Now use this command to reinstall everything\nsudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop lubuntu-default-settings lxde\n\nNote that this command did not explicitly say to install pcmanfm but that package will be installed as a dependency package of lubuntu-core which will itself be installed as a dependency of lubuntu-desktop. \nIf you don't have other DE installed, just switch to one of the virtual console by pressing Ctrl+Alt+F1 and execute the commands.  To return to the graphical session, press Ctrl+Alt+F7  .\nThis should help you to reinstall pcmanfm.\n", "Q: What method do I use to manage an app-specific background process? I am developing an application with different behavior depending on the arguments :  \n\n\n*\n\n*\"-config\" starts a Gtk window to change options, start and close the daemon.  \n\n*\"-daemon\" starts a background process that does something every X minutes.\n\n\nI already know how to use fork/system/exec etc...  \nBut I would like to know the main logic of such application to :  \n\n\n*\n\n*restart or refresh the daemon when configuration change.  \n\n*keep only one instance of the daemon.  \n\n\nI have read that killing the daemon to restart it is not a clean way to do.\nHow other applications do ? (ubuntuone, weather forecast, rss feed working with notification area)\nThanks for your help.\nPS : I don't want to create a system-wide daemon, just a user application with a background process.\n\nA: Consider offloading notification onto the system!\nThe general way things to communicate with a daemon in modern GNU/Linux desktop is D-Bus. To grossly simplify what it does: D-Bus allows you to call functions from a daemon \"service\" process. You could easily just have a refreshConfig() function that reloads configuration from file on call.\nThat said, the specific thing you're trying to do has a solution more germane to Ubuntu and GTK+. With GSettings, you create a configuration schema that defines key/value pairs you're interested in storing. After doing so, you can put a line something like this in your daemon...\nmySettings->connect(\"changed::setting\", onSettingChanged);\n\nAnd GObject will wake up your daemon and call onSettingChanged() when any configuration changes. That function can call a new instance of itself and exit(0) if you wish. Although I can't think of a code logic reason why you'd need to do that.\nHere is an excellent guide for using GSettings with Python. It should be easily translatable to C++.\n\nA: You are touching here on an ocean of information. The problem is called inter-process communication (IPC) and there are tons of materials on that, depending on your programming language, need for complexity etc. It ranges from communicating over files (presence or absence of a lock file is a simple variant of this), through named pipes to Sys V IPC including semaphores and shared memory.\nIn your case, I would look into named pipes.\n", "Q: How to ensure that all new users have the same profile settings as the current user? How to ensure that all new users have the same profile settings as the current user?  I am using  Ubuntu 12.04.\n\nA: Yeah use /etc/skel/. Anything you shove in there will be copied out to a new user profile when you create them.\nThe most meaningful way to use this in practice (for deep customisation) is to create a user, customise their account to how you want all the others to look and then copy things in that profile out to /etc/skel/.\nOne note: a lot of applications will create home directories on their first run. Because of that it's important you only run the things you want to customise under your template user account. Otherwise you'll end up contaminating things that don't need to be there.\nSecond note: You may need to update the template over time as default applications change. It's not a long process so as long as you spend 10 minutes testing a new profile each release upgrade, you should be fine.\n", "Q: Remove Wine's Notepad from \"Open With\" options A few facts: I use Wine. Wine ships its own version of Notepad. For some files, this copy of Notepad has somehow become associated. There is no possibility of me ever actually wanting to open anything in Notepad.\nI figure I could try and find out what Notepad is associated with and re-associate that with my editor of choice but that seems deeply tedious. Is there any global way to stop Notepad existing as a method for opening files?\n\nA: Removing the associations from ~/.local/share/* will work temporarily, until you install something new and winemenubuilder runs again.\nInstead, you may also wish to prevent wine from creating file associations in the first place.\n\nA: *\n\n*wine-notepad creates a local mime association for text/plain and some other types in the file ~/.local/share/applications/mimeinfo.cache; this effectively allows it as an alternative to anything gedit (or your default GUI editor) would otherwise open\n\n*To disable, open ~/.local/share/applications/mimeinfo.cache in a text editor and delete the lines with the MIME types text/plain and text/html\n\n*Also move/delete wine-extension-txt.desktop and wine-extension-htm.desktop from ~/.local/share/applications/\n\n*Most text or text-like files should default back to your GUI editor\n\n", "Q: search through all lenses Currently I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 with some additional lenses. \nIs it possible to search though all lenses at the same time? \nFor example when I type \"Tom\" it looks for all calendar events (through Calendar events lenses), all Empathy contacts and all music titles contains this string.\nPlease advice me, how to do that?\n\nA: It is possible, but there would need to be an extra bit of code to bind together the background services which search in various pots of data and the lens front end you'd like these delivered to.\nThis would be an 'all in one' lens. And you can learn about making them here: http://developer.ubuntu.com/resources/technologies/lenses-and-scopes/\nThe alternative method is to hack the existing lens definitions so they all appear in the home menu when you search there.

It will ask you for a username and password and open a new session with that user. It's tunnelled under ssh, quite fast and very secure. But it's not as near as easy to configure (read convenient) as TeamViewer: You will need to install the server, install a client on the computers where you are going to connect from, and open port 22 on your router.

I currently have a .sh file and have no idea where to put it.\n\nA: Just save this file as 'Mark as executable', make itself executable and drop it to ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts\nIt will be shown at your right-click menu, under the submenu Scripts\nYou may want to remove the gksudo from there if you are planning to mark as executable only files that you own (under your home directory), otherwise, every time that you run the script through the right click menu, it will ask you for password...\nBUT the script you have up there is not going to work for files which contain spaces to their filename.

What's the solution for that? The Amazon Kindle Reader is only for Windows and Mac, für Linux there's only a MP3 downloader from amazon, but only for older systems and 32-Bit.\nIs there something similar to iTunes for ubuntu?\n\nA: There is the Ubuntu One music store, which is included by default on Ubuntu, and is accessible from the Rhythmbox player, from the Music Lens in the Dash, and from the Ubuntu One website.\nAmazon no longer supports Linux exactly, particularly if you live in the US.\n\nA: With Amazon Kindle Cloud Reader it is possible to read your Kindle ebooks with Chromium or Firefox.

The only way I can access anything is through a root shell at startup.\nHow can I set the keyring from the command prompt?\n\nA: After much trial and error I found that the old feisty package pam-keyring still contains the pam-keyring-tool which you can use to unlock keyrings from the command line.

I'm still interested in casually booting a \"desktop\" version of Ubuntu (so will prefer to avoid permanent changes), and would like to avoid installing a separate Ubuntu-server version.\nMy use-case is the following -\n\n\n*\n\n*Application is single-thread and console-mode only.\n\n*Test-box has 12GB of memory.\n\n*I ssh into the test-box.\n\n\nSeems I can skip at least Unity, X-server and their dependents.\n\nA: Booting into single-user mode will keep most of the services (including X) off, and bringing up the network and sshd services should be enough to make it usable for your purposes.\n\nA: As long as other things aren't actively doing any work, there should be no interference problems. If you don't log in to an X session, and only log in via SSH, then there shouldn't really be any actual work happening, in general. You could telinit to the console-only runlevel, or simply reboot into the \"recovery mode\" selection from the boot prompt, to have fewer processes running.\nThough, it doesn't really matter if other things are running, so long as nothing is consuming all the CPU resources, or hitting the disk constantly, which may cause your program to stall in IOWait.\n\nA: As long as you can trust yourself to not mess things up while logged in as root, the best way to get a minimal system with networking and SSH is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into recovery mode from Grub (hold Shift down when booting to get the menu)\n\n\n*Enable networking (which will also remount your partitions in normal read/write mode)\n\n\n*Drop to a root shell (aka single-user mode):\n\n\n*Do a service ssh start to enable SSH and you're good to go!\n\nNote: you can always give your benchmark program realtime CPU and I/O priority using nice and ionice; e.g. maxing out both would be:\nnice --20 ionice -c 1 /path/to/program\n\n\n", "Q: How do I configure rsyslog to send logs from a specific program to a remote syslog server?

So, name your file starting with leading zero's, i.e. 00-my-file.conf. It's better to create a new file so that updates and so on doesn't overwrite your local config.\nExample:\nif $programname == 'programname' and $msg contains 'a text string' and $syslogseverity <= '6' then /var/log/custom/bind.log\n\nOr if you just want to discard certain entries:\nif $programname == 'programname' then ~\n\nIn your case: (UDP)\nif $programname == 'programname' then @remote.syslog.server\n& ~\n\nOr (TCP)\nif $programname == 'programname' then @@remote.syslog.server\n& ~\n\nThe & ~ means to stop processing matching (previous line only!) entries further.\nSome more general info:\nAlso, always make sure filters are on the same line:\n# Example: Log mail server control messages to mail-queue.log\nif $hostname == 'titus'\\\nand $programname == 'smtp.queue.'\\\nand $syslogseverity <= '6' then /var/log/titus/mail-queue.log\n& ~\n\nUsefull filters:\n$hostname\n$programname\n$msg\n$syslogseverity\n\nOperators:\n== (equals)\ncontains\nand\nor\n\nMore info: http://wiki.rsyslog.com/index.php/Configuration_Samples\n\nA: We can also try this.

A non-zero number means that something has gone wrong usually and the value itself might have a meaning (check documentation of your program returning those).

So a file on the desktop named foo\n  will have a custom icon loaded if the image in the .thumbnails dir\n  is foo.gif\n\nHowever, one of the leading xfce developers, Nick Schermer, has commented that\n\nNon md5hash files in the .thumbnails directory is a bad idea.\n    The prefix-only check if a bit flawed as well, it can be improved with a dot-check (so foo2.png is not matched).\n\nSo the method as described in the patch has not really been validated by the developers, and because it would involve a lot of time compiling thunar and its dependencies (as noted here), and then a lot of risk in installing them to your system, I would advise against trying it. You could experiment of course in a virtualised environment (virtualbox) or on a computer set aside for development, but not on a stable system.\nIt is usually fine to compile programs and apply patches, as I have discussed in many examples on this site, but on this occasion it is better to wait until a solution is available that has been validated by the developers.\nFor now the question is 'solved', but I will continue to update it and indeed research the issue to see how it could be accomplished in the manner that it is done in Nautilus.\n\nA: For desktop folders, the solution I discovered by accident is as follows:\nFind the icon you want your folder to have. It must be a .png file. Change the extension to .jpg. Change the file name to 'folder'. (So the png file should be named 'folder.jpg'.\nI am using Linux Mint Xfce 18.1.\n\nA: Custom folder icons can be configured via thumbler with Thunar 1.8.2 or above.\nYou can add a custom thumbnailer specialized for folder.\nCheck the section\"Customized Thumbnailer for folders\" in the Thunar Wiki for details.\nFor more details, check the related bug\n", "Q: I recreated my root partition using fdisk (resized it), but now the filesystem is corrupt I was under the impression that i could resize my root partition, recreate it using fdisk but only larger. And then reboot, and do an online filesystem resize with resize2fs. however, that doesn´t seem to be the case. Now i can´t mount my partition that is running ext4.\nAny suggestions on how i should proceed on recovering the partition?\n\nA: No, you cannot do it on a live filesystem. I cross my fingers that using fdisk on a live partition did not completely damage it. Always perform such operations from the system booted from LiveCD / rescue CD / other partition. Partition may not be writeable during that operation.\nDo not jump to my instructions immediately; maybe someone will come up with a better plan. I include these instructions just in case no one else responds.\nStart the system using LiveCD and go to rescue mode. Resize the partition as planned using resize2fs. Try to mount the resized partition and see whether it works. If you have anything valuable (i.e., other than OS / software), back it up immediately. If everything went OK, try to reboot.\n", "Q: Dragon Age: Origins with PlayOnLinux have low fps I successfully installed Dragon Age: Origins with PlayOnLinux on my Ubuntu 12.04 but the game is too slow, frame per second(fps) is too low.

Everything is working great, except I cannot figure out how to change the default wallpaper.  Which configuration file(s) do I need to edit?\n\nA: For Ubuntu 12.04 :\nHere's how you can change the default wallpaper. For example, we'll set it to the included Wild Wheat (/usr/share/backgrounds/WildWheat_by_Brian_Burt.jpg):\n\n\n*\n\n*Within the LiveCD chroot, open the following file with nano as, \nnano /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/10_gsettings-desktop-schemas.gschema.override\n\n\n*Change the below line to the path for your file:\npicture-uri='file:///usr/share/backgrounds/warty-final-ubuntu.png'\n\n\n*For our example, that becomes:\npicture-uri='file:///usr/share/backgrounds/WildWheat_by_Brian_Burt.jpg`\n\n\n*Finally, compile the modified schemas with:\nglib-compile-schemas /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas\n\nFor Ubuntu 14.04 :\nSay you want to make /usr/share/backgrounds/Reflections_by_Trenton_Fox.jpg as your default wallpaper. \n\n\n*\n\n*Within the LiveCD chroot, open the following file with nano as,\nnano /usr/share/gnome-background-properties/ubuntu-wallpapers.xml\n\n\n*Change the following line:\n<filename>/usr/share/backgrounds/warty-final-ubuntu.png</filename>\n\n\n*To (in our case):\n<filename>/usr/share/backgrounds/Reflections_by_Trenton_Fox.jpg</filename>\n\n\n*Also edit the <stringvalue> in the following file,\nnano /var/lib/gconf/debian.defaults/%gconf-tree.xml\n\n\n*Change the line,\n<stringvalue>/usr/share/backgrounds/warty-final-ubuntu.png</stringvalue>\n\n\n*To (in our case):\n<stringvalue>/usr/share/backgrounds/Reflections_by_Trenton_Fox.jpg</stringvalue>\n\nSource\n", "Q: Unable to Launch ubuntu software centre \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I fix “malformed line” errors in sources.list?

Kindly Reply ASAP ....\n\nA: You should leave the \"localhost\" text on the 127.0.0.1 line - various things depend on that existing.  Instead, you probably wanted to add your hostname to that line:\n127.0.0.1     localhost node1\n\nYour question also says \"127.0.01\" without the third \".\" - hopefully that's a typo in the question and not in your /etc/hosts file.\nNOTE: hostnames should always be lowercase, case is ignored but that doesn't mean it won't cause problems.\n\nA: Before juju will connect to the nodes, you must reboot them AFTER doing the juju bootstrap. This will cause them to install new software, including the keys necessary to enable communications.\n\nA: The reason for that is key has been alternate from the one exists in the .ssh/known_hosts file. \nIf you are certain the system has not been compromised, you can simply remove the host key in the known_hosts file and accept the new one again.\n", "Q: \\t string with sed I'm using sed to replace the string \"\\UPo\" by the string \"\\textit{Old (User's preferences)}\".\nThe command I'm using is:\nfind /home/rom/Desktop/nodeRemoval/report -name \\*.tex -exec sed -i \"s/\\\\UPo/\\\\textit{Old (User's preferences)}/g\" {} \\;\n\nI want to escape the backslashes as they are part of the string. But instead of a backslash it gives me a tab!\nThe output is: \\[TAB]extit{Old (User's preferences)}\nWhat's wrong?\nThanks in advance,\nRom\n\nA: Since your expression is in double quotes, the string gets evaluated by bash (which replaces \\\\ with \\). In fact, the regex passed on to sed looks like that:\ns/\\UPo/\\textit{Old (User's preferences)}/g\n\nEither escape each backslash twice:\nsed -i \"s/\\\\\\\\UPo/\\\\\\\\textit{Old (User's preferences)}/g\"\n\nor, better, use single quotes. Anything in single quotes will not get evaluated by bash, but beware: a single quote may not appear between single quotes, so you need to finish the single quote, escape single quote, start single quote again:\nsed -i \"s/\\\\UPo/\\\\textit{Old (User'\\''s preferences)}/g\"\n\nThis is all a bit silly, which is why we have Perl.\n", "Q: What is the Broadcast Account? Under the notification envelope, there is something called \"Set up Broadcast Account...\". I've looked all over and can't find anything about it. What is it and what is it for? Thanks\n\nA: According to http://www.linuceum.com/Desktop/SocialMedia.php:\n\nBroadcast accounts are things like Twitter, Facebook or Google Buzz, which allow\n  you to send updates and share things with a number of friends or\n  followers over the internet. They allow you to keep up with\n  whatever your friends are doing. Unlike email, broadcasting is more\n  like a mail shot out to a group of people at the same time. It's not\n  just text that can be shared, but files, images and video (if your\n  connection's bandwidth allows)!\nLinux has a number of tools to handle broadcast messages, but the\n  default for Ubuntu is Gwibber. Gwibber allows you to define all your\n  social media accounts in one place, then to broadcast out across all\n  of them at the same time. As an example, the next section will show\n  you how to configure Gwibber with a Google Buzz account (-but the\n  priciple is the same for the likes of Flickr, Facebook, Twitter, etc).\n\n", "Q: Existing partitons not recognized during installation I've got a Windows 8 (final version, no preview) installed in my pc. Now I wanted to install Ubuntu like I've done a thousand times before. Strange thing is, gparted (started from live USB-Stick) sees my system disk as completely unallocated although it has one huge ntfs partition with Windows 8 on it. So I booted into Windows again and used the disk management tool to shrink that partition and create a new one in the free space. I formated that one to fat32. I still got the same behavior in gparted. Does anyone have an idea? My harddisk is a Samsung 830 Series SSD and the mainboard has UEFI.\nEDIT\nTried a 12.10 beta1 stick now. It tells me that the volume contains GPT signatures and maybe was corrupted by a program that doesn't understand. With this new information I found this but am not really sure what to do.\n\nA: I found the solution here. The basic part is:\nOK, then, it looks like you've got a new MBR with residual GPT data, which is confusing GParted. You'll have to wipe the GPT data. Here's how:\n\nBoot your PartedMagic or System Rescue CD emergency disc.\nFor safety, back up your MBR by typing \"dd if=/dev/sda of=sda-backup.mbr bs=512 count=1\" and then copying the resulting file (sda-backup.mbr) to a USB flash drive, network share, or some other medium. Be sure to get the if= and of= parameters right, though!\nLaunch gdisk by typing \"gdisk /dev/sda\". When asked whether to use the MBR or GPT data, either will work.\nType \"x\" to enter the experts' menu. The command prompt should change.\nType \"z\" to \"zap\" (destroy) the GPT data. Tell it to proceed, but answer \"N\" to the question about blanking the MBR.\n\nThat's it. Windows should boot as it did before and you should now be able to continue your installation of Ubuntu; its installer should now see the same partitions as Windows.\n\n", "Q: Installing Creative NX Webcam I want to install my Creative NX webcam on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.

of two events:\n\n\n*\n\n*The known bug in kernel used by Ubuntu installer mini-cd, which effectively wiped down the superblock on raid members (actually excluding one, /dev/sde. I guess it is because of one problem of Ubuntu 12.04 with racing condition during boot that prevents some disks to be visible to mdadm - see this link). \n\n*Another bug in kernel used by Ubuntu 12.04 kernel (which may affect others), which effectively reset superblocks on raid members after upgrade. \n\n\nThe solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Recover the raid members proper order from syslog taken from system when it was healthy (or be prepared to permute the order in the following step as long as the raid is restored)\n\n*Issue mdadm -C /dev/md5 -e 1.2 -l 5 -n 5 /dev/sd{b,f,c,e,d}6 --assume-clean --uuid=a3945c40:73237cd6:3d61998e:8f773d03 and mdadm -C /dev/md6 -e 1.2 -l 6 -n 5 /dev/sd{b,f,c,e,d}5 --assume-clean --uuid=2a8fd2df:3ad53552:e8b80ecf:a46d93a2 as root from Ubuntu 10.04 (not newer) live CD. (Of course names of member devices, UUIDs, number of raid devices etc. will be different in your setup.) \n\n*If contents of raids is valid - then we are done. No need to use the obsolete 10.04 any longer.\n\n\nFor further info see this Server Fault question: What parameters to mdadm, to re-create md device with payload starting at 0x22000 position on backing storage?\n", "Q: Reinstalling 12.04 and preserving encrypted /home. Possible? My /home directory is about 200 GB and encrypted. I need to reinstall Ubuntu 12.04 (fresh install) to fix some problems and and concerned that I might lose access or have to format /home during the installation. Is it easy and possible to reinstall without losing /home? \nWhat should I keep in mind in order to preserve the directory and be able to decrypt it after re-installation?\n\nA: If your /homeis on a separate partition, then when you install make sure that you don't format that partition.\nI'm not sure if the installer will try to mess with the partition, so the safest thing would be to make a copy of /home (from the Live CD using either dd or cp -a) and then restoring that copy after the reinstall. You'll also need to make sure that your user information in /etc/passwd is the same before and after the reinstall.\n", "Q: Command like inotify - or another solution? Is it possible to recursively scan changed files from more than 3 weeks ago with inotify, or is inotify only for starting cron jobs? What other command can I try for checking for changed files that are more than 3 weeks old?\n\nA: I think you may be looking for find. Inotify is more of an event mechanism for live updates, whereas find enables you to search for files based on criteria such as -cmin, -ctime, etc. \n\nA: As \"Jo-Erlend Schinstad\" said... you can use find\nExample:\nfind . -mtime +5 | xargs ls -l\n\n. -> current directory (recursive search is by default)\n-mtime +5 -> find all files which are older than 5 days (this is for creation time, not last change time!)\n| xargs ls -l -> only for listing file detail (you can remove this)\n", "Q: Getting MTP to work with a Galaxy tab 2 7.0?

Rebooting the PC after following the steps solved the problem.\n\nA: If you would consider alternative techniques, you can use ftp for file transfer.   \nYou should start an ftp server from your Android device with Software Data Cable. You can find it at Software Data Cable app on Google Play Store. Once downloaded, start the app, on the upper left, tap Sync PC, and get the ip adress show in the middle of screen.   \nThen go to Nautilus and click File > Connect to server, then enter the ip adress. Then the contents of your tablet will show up. I have a Galaxy Tab 8.9, and I had problems with mtp too. It's microsoft stuff and it always will be buggy on Linux.\n*edit: The sync pc button may be somewhere else in a phone screen, I have tried it only with a tablet.\n\nA: I tried out Airdroid last night and it worked fantastically well with my wife's Google Nexus tablet.\nThe difference is that airdroid is an app on your device that exposes the devices filesystem for local web access.\n", "Q: Music store - Is it safe to edit tags of music purchased on Ubuntu One?

A java app should only include the minimum number of jars it requires, no more, no less.\nWhen you have specific, individual apps that do require that the classpath be set, then usually the command-line option is preferred: java -cp path1:path2:....  Desktop icons can have their command altered to include these options, or shell scripts can be modified to include these options.\nThat being said (and since there are always exceptions to the rule), then depending on the version of java (this requres java 6 or later), you can specify that a whole directory of jars be added to the classpath by adding a \"*\" at the end of a directory; e.g, the following:\n /dir1/foo.jar:/dir2/dir3:/dir5/dir6/*:etc...\n\nMeans:\n\n\n*\n\n*/dir1/foo.jar - (the single jar) will be added to the classpath;\n\n*/dir2/dir3 - all un-jar'd classes in this directory will be added to the classpath (must be in proper package structure; e.g, com.my.Foo.class must be in /dir2/dir3/com/my/Foo.class)\n\n*/dir5/dir6/* - all jars in this directory (i.e., /dir5/dir6/*.jar) will be added to the classpath. Note that this \"*\" isn't a wildcard (you can't use f*.jar or even *.jar); it's a special character indicating \"add all jars\"\n\n\nIn general, if you have to add a whole directory of jars to the application's classpath, the app was not bundled correctly.  Rather, the app should have a manifest containing the list of jars it depends on.  Or at the very least, only one jar should be added to your classpath, and that jar can have in its manifest the whole list of jars in some subdirectory.\n\nA: open terminal and type\n\nsudo nano ~/.bashrc\n\nadd all the exports you need like ...\n\nexport JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/java/jdk1.6.0_06(your path)\nexport ANT_HOME=/opt/ant/apache-ant-1.9.4\n\nfinally restart terminal for changes to take effect\n", "Q: How to recover from deleting menubar?

Xbox burner isn't recognizing an ISO file to use from the game at all.  Also when I put the game in vlc opens it but has errors on the audio and video files but shows the Xbox splash screen.  Does anyone know how to make Xbox burner work correctly?  Or give me step by step instructions on what I need to set this up correctly?\n\nA: It is discouraged, difficult, unnecessary, and illegal in some locations.\nFrom here:\n\nThe Xbox has a specific function: Non-booting or non-reading from CDs and DVD-Rs as a method of game copy protection. Also, the Xbox is said to use a different DVD file system (instead of UDF). It has been theorized that the discs have a second partition that is read from the outside in (opposite current standards thus making the second partition unreadable in PC DVD drives) which give the tracks the appearance that the disc was spun backwards during manufacture. The Xbox 360 copy protection functions by requesting the DVD drive compute the angular distance between specific data sectors on the disc. A duplicated DVD will return different values than a pressed original would.\n\nThis is meant to keep users from copying disks. It is, in a nutshell, made so that you can't use CD-R's and need disks that were manufactured to have special layouts of sectors upon the physical surface. This is done as such copies are not generally legal. Also, the fact that a proprietary filesystem is used means that discs cannot be read using normal drives and filesystem utilities.\n\nLegal disclaimer: This is not meant to be legal advice. The author of this answer and Stack Exchange, Inc will not be responsible for any damages, incidental, or consequential, that may arise due to the use of these guidelines. These guidelines are based on US laws and regulations. Laws and regulations in your area may differ so check with a lawyer or local authorities.\n\n\nA: The thing is, you need a special DVD drive to backup your games. I believe these drives are called 0800 drives and are something along the lines of an official Xbox360 DVD drive. You usually need Windows for the whole back-up process, but there are softwares that are compatible with Ubuntu Linux as well. www.GameBackupSystem.com is one of them.\nI would look into GameBackupSystem a bit more, looks like a decent product.\n\nA: Or you can have the xbox modded and it will play backups, copying games however (which is what you are doing when you load his games onto a computer) requires ripping programs you can get from xbox modding forums. Be wary though, if you don't know what you are doing you can brick his xbox, best thing is to hire someone to mod it for you. Also the law states one copy per owned media to protect against selling backups. It's not illegal to make one copy.

I'm using umask 077 .\"Other\" and \"group\" do not have any rights, but the user  can't execute files/directories.\nWhy does umask 077 not allow the owner to execute files/directories?\n\nA: When you use a umask of 077 only the user has read, write and execute permissions. The user definitely will be able to open ('execute') directories (see more on why directories have to be executable in my answer here). However, files must always be made executable by entering chmod u+x myfile; they are never automatically executable. Some more useful information on umask is given in this answer:\n\n\n*\n\n*What is \"umask\" and how does it work?\nThe likely possibility for your problems is that you have perhaps entered the value slightly incorrectly, which has resulted in a different umask, or that the value has not been permanently set. If you enter umask 077 in the terminal it will only hold good for that session of the terminal; to make it permanent for your user simply add umask 077 to your ~/.profile. The system default setting for umask is in /etc/login.defs; it used to be in /etc/profile. See also the manpage for pam_umask, which is a pam module that handles the assignment of umask.\nThe following examples are from a successful setting of umask 077:\n1) For folder creation: mkdir doc checked with stat doc gave the correct permissions and an 'executable' folder:\nFile: `doc'\n  Size: 4096        Blocks: 8          IO Block: 4096   directory\nDevice: 801h/2049d  Inode: 6425268     Links: 2\nAccess: (0700/drwx------)  Uid: ( 1000/    mike)   Gid: ( 1000/    mike)\nAccess: 2012-09-12 11:33:01.236675420 +0100\nModify: 2012-09-12 11:33:01.236675420 +0100\nChange: 2012-09-12 11:33:01.236675420 +0100\n Birth: -\n\n2) For file creation: touch new checked with stat new gave the correct permissions; the file is only made executable when you use chmod +x:\nFile: `new'\n  Size: 0           Blocks: 0          IO Block: 4096   regular empty file\nDevice: 801h/2049d  Inode: 6303902     Links: 1\nAccess: (0600/-rw-------)  Uid: ( 1000/    mike)   Gid: ( 1000/    mike)\nAccess: 2012-09-12 11:34:58.272676270 +0100\nModify: 2012-09-12 11:34:58.272676270 +0100\nChange: 2012-09-12 11:34:58.272676270 +0100\n\nA umask of 077 will give the permissions shown, but if you still have problems with permissions after setting umask 077 properly (as discussed further above) we can look into it further.\n\nA: The umask value will be used to appropriately modify the default fmask for file permissions (base permission 0666) and dmask for directory/folder permissions (base permission 0777).\nThe effective fmask and dmask values will be calculated by deducting the umask value (Octal calculations).\nSo a umask 0022 would result in fmask to get a value 0644 (i.e. 0666 - 0022) while dmask would be 0755 (i.e. 0777 - 0022).\nThe umask 0077 prevent files from being created with any access not only to the world (indicated by the ultimate octal digit) but also your group members (indicated by the penultimate octal digit).\nReference:\n\n*\n\n*umask\n", "Q: Menu Bar Time Disappeared Hello can anyone help me, my time on the menu bar has disappeared, one day I noticed it was gone, in system settings I do not have a time and date option either.\nI am running Ubuntu 12.04, please help\n\nA: I just had this problem while I was also dealing with another bug to do with my keyboard layout changing spontaneously, and the fix for that also brought back my time and date display.\nTry the following command:\n\nsudo restart lightdm\n\nSeemed to work for me, anyway.

My other Ubuntu 12.04 install has the application switcher that I like, but I'm not sure how to choose between them on this install (which was set up by my university department). Thanks if anyone can help me with this.\n\nA: I think you will have to install the Compiz Settings Manager (aka ccsm) and play with the settings of the Unity / other switcher plugins. Unfortunately, ccsm can be dangerous and can make Compiz crash or disable all the plugins, so do that if you know what you are doing or are ready to deal such bugs. \n", "Q: How to access files in Windows partition from Ubuntu live USB? I run Ubuntu from a USB (run the whole OS from it, persistent) and want to access files such as my pictures or documents from Windows 7, is it possible to do so? How?\n\nA: You need to mount the partition that contains you files.\nRun this on Terminal:\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nIt should be something like\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sda1   *        2048      206847      102400    7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n/dev/sda2          206848   209717247   104755200    7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n\nTo locate which partition has your files, probably the one Windows 7 is installed in, then perform the following command:\nsudo mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sdaX /~/choose-a-folder-name-you-want\n\nWhere X is the number of the partition you want to mount, like /dev/sda1 or /dev/sda2.\nIt should mount the disk with full access, so you can copy and paste files to those folders. More about mount.\nRemember, it will mount your whole Windows 7 partition to a folder, so be carefull not to delete anything important.\n\nA: Scenario B\nA live boot with access to a Windows drive on a another machine.\nFast Solution\nYou'll need your live-boot user UID and GID\n~ $ id\nCreate a local mount directory\n~ $ mkdir ~/<mount-dir>\n'mount' the windows drive.\n~ $ sudo mount -t cifs -o user=<win-user-acct>,rw,uid=<uid-number>,gid=<gid-number> //<IP-of-Win-Machine>/C$ ~/<mount-dir>\nExample\n~ $ sudo mount -t cifs -o user=winUserName,rw,uid=999,gid=999 //192.168.1.77/C$ ~/winbox01\nNOTE\n'cifs-utils' should be installed by default, but to check,\n~ $ sudo apt search cifs-utils\n[ If not installed, use the following ]\nsudo apt update && sudo install cifs-utils\nOther Difficulties\nThe 'mount -o[ptions]' list must NOT contain white space.\nThe following options list will fail,\n\"-o user=winUserName[SPACE],rw,uid= ... \"\nWired NIC Connection Issues\n~ $ ip link   OR   ip address\nWith NIC device name,\n~ $ sudo ip link set <NIC-dev-name> up\nWireless NIC Connection Issues\n~ $ nmcli\n[ to get device name of wireless NIC ]\n~ $ nmcli d wifi list\n[ to get SSID to connect to ]\n~ $ nmcli d wifi connect <WiFiSSID> password <WiFiPassword> iface <WifiInterface>\n[ to connect NIC to Wireless network ]   \nMisc\nCertain punctuation within \"<WiFiPassword>\" must be escaped,\nYes:  \\!,\\$,\\&\nNo:    @, #\nTo mount the Windows C$ share [ which is the entire drive ], your <win-User-Acct> will need to belong to the Windows machine's local 'Administrators' group.

Currently my terminal prompt looks like:\nblankman-MacBook-Pro:~ $\n\nMy .bash_profile has:\nexport PS1=\"\\[\\033[36m\\]\\h:\\W \\[\\033[33m\\]\\$(parse_git_branch)\\[\\033[00m\\]\\$(git config user.initials)$\\[\\033[00m\\] \"\nexport SUDO_PS1='\\[\\e[0;31m\\]\\u\\[\\e[m\\] \\[\\e[1;34m\\]\\w\\[\\e[m\\] \\[\\e[0;31m\\]\\$ \\[\\e[0m\\]'\n\nDoes this make sense?\n\nA: That PS1 variable is for customizing the display of the shell \"prompt\". The prompt is the text that appears when the terminal first opens, or at the end of every command (you can repeat the terminal prompt any number of times by repeatedly pressing enter at the terminal with no command).\nThe PS1 variable appears to be looking at your git user id and branch to determine your prompt. This can be useful if you're within a git branch because it'll tell you which branch you're on.\nIf you didn't do this, then probably some program did. If you are having a particular problem with your terminal prompt or want to change it to something else, you can. But asking \"does this make sense\" is not really answerable: all we can do is ask more questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Where did it come from? A program you installed? A script someone wrote? You?\n\n*Do you use git? If not, you may not need this customization.\n\n*Do you dislike the current prompt and want to change it to something else, or are you satisfied with it as it is?\n\n\nIt's all a matter of preference; there is no \"correct\" or \"incorrect\" terminal prompt. You could have it display :-) if you wanted to. It'd be perfectly valid.\n", "Q: How to create/edit/remove a group in Empathy In 12.04 with Empathy 3.4.2.3 I can't seem to find the options for adding, removing or even editing a group.

There you can add new groups and edit existing ones.\n", "Q: Restoring NVIDIA drivers from \"older version of Ubuntu\" to new version on disk? Both 12.04 on Sony Vaio I selected one of the alternative NVIDIA drivers on my Sony Vaio from the Additional Drivers application. That ruined my installation and all I get is the login prompt at bootup.\nHowever I can go in at bootup by selecting \"Older Ubuntu Versions\" and selecting whatever was there before. This older version has the correct drivers (NVIDIA accelerated graphics driver 173) which I'm using right now.\nIs there file in the \"new\" (broken) system where I can replace the NVIDIA driver entry from the \"old\" system I'm using (which works fine) without having to reinstall UBUNTU from scratch? Or can I reinstall UBUNTU without losing all my files and settings? or what are my alternatives?\n\nA: You can probably just remove the nvidia-current package which broke your system and then install the nvidia-173 package:\nsudo apt-get remove nvidia-current\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-173\n\n", "Q: Recover from losing personal PGP The computer I was using which is the one I used to sign the Ubuntu code of conduct got a hardware problem and I lost it. If I want to continue my work on launchpad, how can I proceed to recover, recreate or reset the whole process so that I can relate my PC again to launchpad with the PGP?\n\nA: Launchpad Recovery\nYourAccount/ImportingYourPGPKey\nRenewing your key\nYou may have set your key to expire. You can update your key's expiration date and republish it.\nStep 1: Open Passwords and Encryption Keys.\nStep 2: Select the My Personal Keys tab, select your key and open the property window by pressing Space Bar or double clicking with your pointer. Select the Details tab of the property window.\nStep 3: Set a new expiration date or choose never. Close the property window\nStep 4: With you key still selected, select Remote > Sync and Publish Keys from the menu. Choose the Sync button. \nreview the source https://help.launchpad.net/YourAccount/ImportingYourPGPKey \n\nA: Launchpad allows you to continue working with more than one PGP key associated with your account. All is not necessarily lost just because you lost one of your PGP keys; as long as you are using one of your authorized PGP keys, you can continue to sign stuff.\nIn Launchpad, under your account settings, go to \"Change your OpenPGP keys\" page, and use the Import Key functionality to import another key. And this time, don't lose it.\nIf you have data encrypted with your original PGP key that can only be decrypted using that key, then you are out of luck for obtaining that information. But you won't lose your Ubuntu Code of Conduct signature by adding more PGP keys to your Launchpad profile.\n", "Q: Difference between PGP and GPG What are the main differences between PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) and GPG (GNU Privacy Guard) in relationship with security in Ubuntu and Launchpad?\n\nA: “PGP” stands for “Pretty Good Privacy.” It was developed by Phil Zimmermann. At first it was written as copyrighted freeware under the Gnu Public License. Later, PGP was upgraded and made into a propriety program. The rights for this program are traded around. The reason for this upgrade was legal defense costs and royalty issues related to the export laws of the USA. Now the PGP program is owned by PGP Corporation.\nOnly the command line version is not owned by PGP Corporation which is also not for sale.  PGP uses the RSA algorithm and the IDEA encryption algorithm. The PGP is considered to have Windows interface which is more polished\n“GPG” stands for “Gnu Privacy Guard.” GPG is a re-write or upgrade of PGP. It does not use the IDEA encryption algorithm. This is to make it completely free. It uses the NIST AES, Advanced Encryption Standard. All the algorithm data is stored and documented publicly by OpenPGP Alliance. The main reason for this change is that AES costs less than IDEA and is considered more secure. Moreover, it is royalty free because it is not patented.  GPG is more compatible than the original PGP with OpenPGP. GPG is also based on a command line. Windows frontends are also available for GPG other than the command line.\n\nA: PGP can refer to two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Pretty Good Privacy software originally written by Phil Zimmermann, and now owned by Symantec.\n\n*The formats for keys, encrypted messages and message signatures defined by that software.  These have now been formalised as the OpenPGP standard.\n\n\nThe GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) software is an independent implementation of the OpenPGP standards, so you can use it to exchange encrypted messages with people using other OpenPGP implementations (e.g. Symantec's PGP).\nDue to its popularity on Linux systems, it is also fairly common for people to incorrectly use the term \"GPG\" to refer to the whole OpenPGP cryptography system (e.g. \n\"GPG keys\" or \"GPG signatures\").  It is usually pretty clear what they mean from the context though.\n\nA: Gnu Privacy Guard and Pretty Good Privacy -- also referred to as GPG and PGP, respectively -- are data encryption and decryption solutions used for transferring and storing information securely. GPG and PGP are nearly identical, with the major difference between them being how they are licensed to the public.\nRead more: The Difference Between GPG and PGP | eHow.com http://www.ehow.com/info_12225332_difference-between-gpg-pgp.html#ixzz26DXDNpJy\n", "Q: Every command fails with \"command not found\" after changing .bash_profile? I was updating my .bash_profile, and unfortunetly I made a few updates and now I am getting:\nenv: bash: No such file or directory\nenv: bash: No such file or directory\nenv: bash: No such file or directory\nenv: bash: No such file or directory\nenv: bash: No such file or directory\n-bash: tar: command not found\n-bash: grep: command not found\n-bash: cat: command not found\n-bash: find: command not found\n-bash: dirname: command not found\n-bash: /preexec.sh.lib: No such file or directory\n-bash: preexec_install: command not found\n-bash: sed: command not found\n-bash: git: command not found\n\nMy bash_profile actually pulls in other .sh files (sources them) so I am not exactly sure which modification may have caused this.\nNow if I even try and to a list of files, I get:\n>ls\n-bash: ls: command not found\n-bash: sed: command not found\n-bash: git: command not found\n\nAny tips on how to trace the source of the error, and how to be able to use the terminal for basic things like listing files etc?\n\nA: It looks to me that at one point or another you are overwriting the default PATH environment variable. The type of errors you have, indicates that PATH does not contain /bin, where the above commands (including bash) reside.\nFor example, if you do\nPATH=/home/user/bin\n\ninstead of\nPATH=\"$PATH\":/home/user/bin\n\n\nA: After I couldn't re-run . ~/.bash_profile or any usual commands like whoami, grep, etc.\nI figured a way to just re-export the required paths:\nexport PATH=/usr/local/jdk/bin:/usr/kerberos/sbin:/usr/kerberos/bin:/usr/local/sbin:usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/opt/cpanel/composer/bin:/usr/local/easy/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/root/bin\n\nThis should work in most systems, although some of these paths are not present in all Linux packages. It worked for me.\n\nA: I think I may have found the answer to the problem if not for you then for others who have a similar problem. My answer to this is that I do not have a .bash_profile.\nSo I was searching all over the web and I found the solution. Which is basically open the terminal, type touch ~/.bash_profile and press Enter. That fixed my problems. Hope it does the same for you\n\nA: One way to begin debugging your bash script would be to start a subshell with the -x option:\n$ bash --login -x\n\nThis will show you every command, and its arguments, which is executed when starting that shell.\nThe --login option is specified because .bash_profile is read by login shells.  Further information on debugging bash scripts can be found here: http://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/sect_02_03.html.\nUltimately, I think that January's suggestion will work for you, but that link is worth a read for future problems.\n\nA: I have the same problem like you. I can't use many popular command (ls, vi/vim, ..) and can't edit /root/.bashrc when I log in with su into root. \nFinally. I found the solution for this problem. Just login root with command:\nsu -m\n\nAfter that, you can use \nvim /root/.bashrc\n\nto edit PATH.\nGoodluck!\n\nA: I had the same problem. You may have missed a $ while exporting PATH. You should open the .bash_profile in TextEdit. If you can't find the file in the directory, press Command + Shift + > to show hidden files.\nThen make correction to the PATH and then save.\nIn the directory on Terminal, type: source .bash_profile.\nThis should resolve the issue.\n\nA: I may have found the problem. It worked for me, and it might work for you...\nI was defaulting with my editor to Windows (LF/CR) saves. Since I use both systems, it seemed logical. When I needed to mess with my .bash_profile, I realized after commenting out and tryig things that nothing worked. I changed my saves to OS X format (CR only) and voilà! No more \"command not found\" in the terminal!\nIt may just be that easy!\n\nA: I had exactly the same problem:\nIf I put in lxterminal: \nset | grep \"jerom/bash\"\nPATH=/usr/lib/lightdm/lightdm:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/home/jerom/bash/\n\nif I entered exactly the same command in tty2 I got:\nset | grep \"jerom/bash\"\nPATH=/usr/lib/lightdm/lightdm:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/home/jerom/bash\\r\n\n\\r means DOS end of line, so I opened file ~/.bashrc and change the ends of lines in Krusader to unix style. And its working already!!! :-)\nThe DOS EOLs make spourious problems also in bash scripts.\n\nA: I got the same problem just now after I changed the .bash_profile.\nAnd I want to change it back but now I can't, because I lost all the commands, especially the nano command and the vim command, so I can't open the .bash_profile with command. And the .bash_profile is a hidden file I can't open it with the Finder.\nSo I need to find a way to open the .bash_profile file.\nAfter I tried many ways I found that I can use Atom, because Atom can read all files in a project folder, include the hidden files.\nSo just open Atom, and select the File -> Open, choose <yourusername> folder, and then, all hidden files is showing on the Atom's tree view, include the .bash_profile!!\nAfter I removed the last modification and reopen the Terminal, all commands came back! :)\n", "Q: Why does every directory have a size 4096 bytes (4 K)? As the subject says; I want to know why is every directory having a size equals to 4K even if they contain files with sizes greater than 4K.\nPlease have a look at the following:- \n$ ls -lh\ntotal 2.0M\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 ankit ankit 4.0K Sep 11 07:28 Desktop\n\n$ ls -lrh Desktop/\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 ankit ankit 9.1M Aug 4 11:15 sophosthreatsaurusaz.pdf\n-rw------- 1 ankit ankit 107K Dec 27 2010 KP 3 0.pdf\ndrwxrwsr-x 9 ankit ankit 4.0K Sep 10 19:26 eclipse\n\nPS: I am aware of du -sh command line utility.\nEdit: I am assuming directory as a container for files.\n\nA: \nIf a file contains any data at all (even a single byte), it will occupy one block on the disk (which is typically 4k these days). One block cannot be shared between files. This means that the space of that whole block will not be available for other files, so it is considered \"used\".   \n\nSource\n\nA: *\n\n*Without getting too technical, think of a directory entry as simply a \"link\" to a list of the files the directory \"contains.\"\n\n*Then, as with everything, ls shows you the size of that link, not the total space occupied by the contents of the directory.\n\n*The minimum size a file or directory entry/link must occupy is one block, which is usually 4096 bytes/4K on most ext3/4 filesystems.\n\n\nA: To understand this, you'd better have some basic knowledge of the following (file system):\n\n\n*\n\n*inode (contains file attributes, metadata of file, pointer structure)\n\n*file (can be considered a table with 2 columns, filename and its inode, inode points to the raw data blocks on the block device)\n\n*directory (just a special file, container for other filenames. It contains an array of filenames and inode numbers for each filename. Also it describes the relationship between parent and children.)\n\n*symbolic link VS hard link\n\n*dentry (directory entries)\n\n*...\n\n\nOn typical ext4 file system (what most people use), the default inode size is 256 bytes, block size is 4096 bytes.\nA directory is just a special file which contains an array of filenames and inode numbers. When the directory was created, the file system allocated 1 inode to the directory with a \"filename\" (dir name in fact). The inode points to a single data block (minimum overhead), which is 4096 bytes. That's why you see 4096 / 4.0K when using ls.\nYou can get the details by using tune2fs & dumpe2fs.\nExample\nroot@ubuntu:~# tune2fs -l /dev/ubuntu/root \ntune2fs 1.42 (29-Nov-2011)\nFilesystem volume name:   <none>\nLast mounted on:          /\nFilesystem UUID:          2fca4cbb-22f1-4328-ab13-cacedb360930\nFilesystem magic number:  0xEF53\nFilesystem revision #:    1 (dynamic)\nFilesystem features:      has_journal ext_attr resize_inode dir_index filetype needs_recovery extent flex_bg sparse_super large_file huge_file uninit_bg dir_nlink extra_isize\nFilesystem flags:         signed_directory_hash \nDefault mount options:    user_xattr acl\nFilesystem state:         clean\nErrors behavior:          Continue\nFilesystem OS type:       Linux\nInode count:              967680\nBlock count:              3931136\nReserved block count:     0\nFree blocks:              2537341\nFree inodes:              517736\nFirst block:              0\nBlock size:               4096\nFragment size:            4096\nReserved GDT blocks:      416\nBlocks per group:         32768\nFragments per group:      32768\nInodes per group:         8064\nInode blocks per group:   504\nRAID stride:              35637\nFlex block group size:    16\nFilesystem created:       Thu Mar 15 14:31:04 2012\nLast mount time:          Sat Oct 20 20:28:04 2012\nLast write time:          Sat Oct 20 20:23:32 2012\nMount count:              1\nMaximum mount count:      -1\nLast checked:             Sat Oct 20 20:22:57 2012\nCheck interval:           0 (<none>)\nLifetime writes:          54 GB\nReserved blocks uid:      0 (user root)\nReserved blocks gid:      0 (group root)\nFirst inode:              11\nInode size:           256\nRequired extra isize:     28\nDesired extra isize:      28\nJournal inode:            8\nFirst orphan inode:       272350\nDefault directory hash:   half_md4\nDirectory Hash Seed:      d582ad79-75a0-4964-9a48-33ddba04df5c\nJournal backup:           inode blocks\n\n", "Q: Audio stopped working suddenly in 12.04 My audio is no longer working in Xubuntu 12.04 after working fine for about a year.

Is it possible that the repeater is somehow causing a problem with the connection, by having two hardware devices for the same network? \nAny additional help would be greatly appreciated\nUpdate : \nChanged the wireless setup to WPA ( used to be WEP ). This seems unlikely to be the root of the problem but at least WPA is more secure. After this change, and disabling ipv6, I feel that the system is closer to working. Now, network manager will start on startup even if the machine is not plugged in to a wired connection. Wireless seems to start and I can see several of the networks available in my area. Also, it will try to connect to the network about 3 times ( prompting for a password each time ). After the third time, it gives up and disables wireless. \nSome guesses then, are:\n-- signal strength is too low. this is unlikely as the problem persists even with the repeater very near the adapter\n-- confusion relating to the repeater : two sources with different mac addresses? perhaps it is alternately trying to connect to the main router and the repeater or something, and getting confused ?\n-- configuration or driver problems ?\n-- device is just plain broken ?\nSome interesting behavior that may help get to the root of the problem. If I start up the computer with both the wireless adapter and a wired connection to the repeater, I am able to get internet connectivity, even after disconnecting the wired connection. However, this wired connection seems to be necessary to initiate a working wireless connection, as the machine cannot connect until the wired connection is first established. \nIf I reboot the machine, connectivity is lost. If I reboot the repeater, connectivity is also lost. \nUpdate : cross posted to ubuntu forums, but no new information there yet. I'm going to try stepping through the installation process from the beginning again. ( I had some more updates but they were lost due to unreliable internet connectivity, basically, re-installing from scratch failed due to compile errors and none of several fixes that I found worked )\nYou would think that this would be a good sign, but there is no wireless connectivity:\nwlan0     IEEE 802.11bg  ESSID:\"[[REDACTED]]\"  Nickname:\"<WIFI@REALTEK>\"\n          Mode:Managed  Frequency:2.437 GHz  Access Point: 48:5B:39:E7:25:5E   \n          Bit Rate:54 Mb/s   Sensitivity:0/0  \n          Retry:off   RTS thr:off   Fragment thr:off\n          Power Management:off\n          Link Quality=100/100  Signal level=100/100  Noise level=0/100\n          Rx invalid nwid:0  Rx invalid crypt:0  Rx invalid frag:0\n          Tx excessive retries:0  Invalid misc:0   Missed beacon:0\n\nUpdate : I don't know why, but if I boot without the wired connection and then run\nsudo service network-manager restart\n\nonce the computer starts up, I seem to get a wireless connection.

I removed Network manager and Wicd as i don't like them and would also like to learn a bit more about how to set up a network connection myself.\nSoo i started searching the web and came across many threads talking about how to reconfigure file /etc/network/interfaces. From my past experiences i connected to the router by typing 192.168.1.1 into browser adress bar and logged into my router settings panel, where i checked how two things are set:\n\n\n*\n\n*router IP adress: 192.168.1.1\n\n*subnet mask: 255.255.255.0 (type C)\n\n\nI looked even further into the problem and figured out that i can calculate my network IP by doing a logic \"bitwise and\" operation between router IP adress and subnet mask above.\n\n\n*\n\n*network IP: 192.168.1.0\nThis was perfectly clear to me so i decided to write my own /etc/network/interfaces file where i first wanted to set my static adress withouth configuring WPA2 encryption. My file now looked like this:\nauto wlan0\niface wlan0 inet static\n    address 192.168.1.10      #this is an IP i want for my machine \n    gateway 192.168.1.1       #this is an IP of my router\n    netmask 255.255.255.0     #netmask i got from my router\n    network 192.168.1.0       #i calculated this as described above\n    broadcast 192.168.1.12    #???\n\nOnly thing i don't understand at the moment is a broadcast adress which i just set and i don't even know what it does. I would need some explaination on this one.\nFor setting the WPA2 i followed this guide and my file /etc/network/interfaces got a bit larger:\nauto wlan0\niface wlan0 inet static\n    address 192.168.1.10      #this is an IP i want for my machine \n    gateway 192.168.1.1       #this is an IP of my router\n    netmask 255.255.255.0     #netmask i got from my router\n    network 192.168.1.0       #i calculated this as described above\n    broadcast 192.168.1.12    #???\n    wpa-driver wext\n    wpa-ssid lausi\n    wpa-ap-scan 2\n    wpa-proto RSN\n    wpa-pairwise CCMP\n    wpa-group CCMP\n    wpa-key-mgmt WPA-PSK\n    wpa-psk 8952a447c860d13847ba1cabd15314ba9caf2fb207f19598f90c43fcd43c0d97\n\nWell this looked OK so i saved my file /etc/network/interfaces and restarted my network using comand /etc/init.d/networking restart. Although i got some error messages my Skype client worked, BUT i couldn't browse the web using my Chrome browser. Every addres like \"www.google.com\" ended up in a blank page with a warning that stating that the page does not exist. \nThis was weird, but i remembered that in Windows i allways had to specify my perferred DNS server which translates words like \"www.google.com\" into an IP adress like \"173.194.35.180\". You can check this by typing \"173.194.35.180\" into your browser addres bar and you will get the Google site. \nWell this problem could easily be solved by adding 1 last line into my /etc/network/interfaces and it might look weird to you but it is like this dns-nameservers 193.2.1.66. This line tells my Linux machine to look at address \"193.2.1.66\" where my internet provider keeps a database of translations from words like \"www.google.com\" to addresses like \"173.194.35.180\" and back. \nWell in my final state my file /etc/network/interfaces looked like below and it worked perfectly:\nauto wlan0\niface wlan0 inet static\n    address 192.168.1.10          #this is an IP i want for my machine \n    gateway 192.168.1.1           #this is an IP of my router\n    netmask 255.255.255.0         #netmask i got from my router\n    network 192.168.1.0           #i calculated this as described above\n    broadcast 192.168.1.12        #???\n    dns-nameservers 193.2.1.66    #DNS server of my internet provider\n    wpa-driver wext\n    wpa-ssid lausi\n    wpa-ap-scan 2\n    wpa-proto RSN\n    wpa-pairwise CCMP\n    wpa-group CCMP\n    wpa-key-mgmt WPA-PSK\n    wpa-psk 8952a447c860d13847ba1cabd15314ba9caf2fb207f19598f90c43fcd43c0d97\n\nBut still i don't know what is an broadcast IP address...\n\nA: Usually the broadcast address for an IPv4 network is at the very end of the network address space. In your case, a network 192.168.1.0 using subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 results in a broadcast address of 192.168.1.255. This is basic IPv4 networking matter (not OS specific). Without specifying a broadcast line in your interfaces file for an interface will make Ubuntu to guess it.\nSo, generally speaking, just remove your broadcast line there. Check the results by inspecting the output of ifconfig wlan0.\nI do recommend to read about some IPv4 basics and try to put them in practise in Ubuntu. It will help much of your understanding in future occasions.\n", "Q: How to ugrade pdfsam?

When I installed it I choose a small, partition, around 30GB. I am following these instructions: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MigrateWubi I see sda4 matches that size, but has mount point as '/host', am I okay to use this one? \nEDIT: Here is a screenshot of my partitions. http://i.imgur.com/ozPe0.png\nMy windows partition is actually not there, that is down as sdb1, so safely out of the way?\nI can confirm sda4 is the location of the 'virtual partition' and is an otherwise, unused 26GB partition. It's also where I would like to migrate to a full install to.\n\nA: When you installed Ubuntu using WUBI, you created a \"virtual partition\" inside a 30GB file called root.disk inside a ntfs partition /dev/sda4 that has the mount point /host. \nTrying to copy Ubuntu from the file inside /dev/sda4 it to the partition itself which may have unexpected results. As with all disk and partition manipulations make backups of all the data, particularly the Ubuntu home folder and generally everything else in the computer. If something goes wrong, you may have to start from scratch and reinstall Ubuntu.\nUbuntu should be installed in an ext4 formatted partition. Since currently /dev/sda4 is formatted ntfs, formatting it ext4 will result in loss of all the data including the root.disk file.\nOne solution may be to move the wubi installation to C:. This is not straight forward. See https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-users/2011-October/253085.html for details.\nMake sure that Ubuntu works after moving the WUBI files to another partition. If not, revert the changes.\nOnce wubi is moved to another partition, you should be able to format sda4 to ext4 and make the mount point \"/.\" \nIf things go south you may have to install Ubuntu in its own partition from scratch. I would suggest deleting sda4 and sda5 make that unallocated space. Ubuntu installation should find the space and create the two partitions. \nAlternately, select \"Something else\" as the type of install to format sda4 to ext4 and choose mount point \"/\" at the time of installation. \nKeeping the same username in the new install as in the previous WUBI install will prevent problems with permissions of backed up files when they are restored.\n", "Q: USB internet dongle not working \nPossible Duplicate:\nMicromax 3G mobile internet modem not being detected \n\nI am using Micromax USB dongle, it works well in Windows 7 and also worked well in Ubuntu 10.10.

I have 4 NTFS drives (c,d,e,f) on my laptop. I have OS installed on c drive and my data on other drives. Now, I have to switch to Ubuntu completely. So, I want to install Ubuntu on C drive. Is it possible not to touch other drives and access all data from Ubuntu?\nP.S.- I am very new to Linux/Ubuntu.Hence, I am sorry if my question sounds weird. \n\nA: Yes, it is possible. No, it is not very advisable.\nLinux can read NTFS, however NTFS does not support the Unix-like permissions. This results usually in all files on an NTFS drive having the same exact permissions determined on mount time. This can be deadly for configuration files in the home directory (because, for example, some of them must be unreadable for everyone except the user), and is not very convenient in general.\nNTFS with Linux is fine as a storage for large media files (music, videos), backups (with Dejadup), but not very suitable for development, and unsuitable for home directories.\n\nA: I'd suggest duel booting because I think many of your Windows specific files will become unusable , like the CHM/help files would require a Windows emulator to use (I believe). I recently used the Windows installer http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/windows-installer and it was as painless as drinking a beer.\nUse Windows to download and run it, and it asks you how much of which drive you want to use. I used 9GB of my C: drive, and after installing everything I want still have 6GB free.\nAfterwards, on reboot you get to choose which OS you want to use. I also went back into Windows and found where to set Ubuntu as the default OS, so it only launches Windows if I tell it to, like if I need to view a CHM file ;) \n", "Q: How do I instal Skype on iMac G5 Ubuntu 12.04.1?

Already tried reinstalling Eclipse and Java, starting Eclipse with -clean and starting new workspace and new .eclipse dir, but nothing helps.\n\nA: No idea why, but putting the line\n-Dcom.ibm.icu.util.TimeZone.DefaultTimeZoneType=ICU\n\nat the end of eclipse.ini seems to have solved the issue.\n\nA: Yes, Brüno's answer worked for me too! It also fixed a bug that this caused in the application I am developing. Since a recent package upgrade in which the cacao virtual machine was removed, timestamps in my database that were in daylight savings time were interpreted incorrectly (off by one hour). But reinstalling tzdata-java fixed that too.\n\nA: I had exactly the same problem today. First, a little googling brought me to your issue (didn't assumed to be due to OpenJDK). After a little more research, finally solved this strange behaviour: have a look at this ubuntu-bug.\nSo the quick solution is just to run sudo apt-get --reinstall install tzdata-java\n(reinstalling Time zone and daylight-saving time data for use by java runtimes)\nCheers\n\nA: I can confirm Brüno's suggestion works well. Thank you!\nThe following resolves the issue, adding this line to eclipse.ini:\n-Dcom.ibm.icu.util.TimeZone.DefaultTimeZoneType=ICU\n\nOr re-installing a missing package.\nsudo apt-get --reinstall install tzdata-java\n\nI have been dealing with missing and broken packages ever since Ubuntu's last upgrade!\n\nA: I would like to add, that I had the same issue; after the same update a java class was not being loaded by Eclipse. same bug posted by bruno for amd64\nBut I right away went to eclipse and checked for updates do not do this. After updating twice Eclipse now doesnt even load plugins (so no perspectives, start java projects, etc)\nThen I updated to oracle's jre; the problem persists.\nI am attemptedthis reinstall, plus removed ~/.eclipse/ and achieved a clean reinstall.\nThe problem stated in this question is not solved doing this, but with Bruno's answer it is now solved.\nOpenJDK Runtime Environment (IcedTea7 2.3.2) (7u7-2.3.2-1ubuntu0.12.04.1)\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 23.2-b09, mixed mode)\n\n", "Q: Pidgin will not open with upgrade to 12.04 Clicking on the icon does nothing.

After the installation completed wireless and Ethernet were both working well. But after restart wireless networks didn't show up while in the network manager both networking and wireless were enabled. Though sometimes after boot it did show the networks available but very rarely.\nSo I went through various posts regarding wireless issues in Ubuntu 12.04 and tried so many things but ended up in nothing satisfactory. I have Broadcom 4313 LAN network controller and brcmsmac driver. Then relying on some suggestions I tried to install bcm-wl driver but couldn't install due to some error in jockeyl.log file. Then i tried fresh installation of the same driver but still could resolve the startup issues with wireless.\nThen again I reinstalled Ubuntu inside windows using wubi installer. This time again same problem occurred after boot. But this time I successfully installed wl driver before disturbing file-system files of Ubuntu. But again the same issue.\nThis time I noticed some new things:\n\n\n*\n\n*If I inserted Ethernet/LAN cable before startup then wireless\nnetworks are available and of course LAN(wired) networks also work.\n\n*but if i don't plug in cable before startup and then plug it after startup then it didn't detect Ethernet network neither wireless. So I haven't noticed it before that LAN along with wifi also doesn't work after startup.\n\n\nBut if i suspend the session and make it sleep and again login then it worked. I tried it every time that WLAN worked perfectly. But still i m unable to resolve that startup problem. Each time i boot first I have to suspend it once then only networks are available.\nIt irritates me each time i reboot/boot my lappy. \nSo please help out of this problem. Any ideas/help regarding this issue would be highly appreciated.\nSome of the commands that i run gave following results:\n# lspci\n\n00:00.0 Host bridge: Intel Corporation Core Processor DRAM Controller (rev 12)\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Core Processor Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 12)\n00:16.0 Communication controller: Intel Corporation 5 Series/3400 Series Chipset HECI Controller (rev 06)\n00:1a.0 USB controller: Intel Corporation 5 Series/3400 Series Chipset USB2 Enhanced Host Controller (rev 06)\n00:1b.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation 5 Series/3400 Series Chipset High Definition Audio (rev 06)\n00:1c.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 5 Series/3400 Series Chipset PCI Express Root Port 1 (rev 06)\n00:1c.1 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 5 Series/3400 Series Chipset PCI Express Root Port 2 (rev 06)\n00:1c.5 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 5 Series/3400 Series Chipset PCI Express Root Port 6 (rev 06)\n00:1d.0 USB controller: Intel Corporation 5 Series/3400 Series Chipset USB2 Enhanced Host Controller (rev 06)\n00:1e.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 82801 Mobile PCI Bridge (rev a6)\n00:1f.0 ISA bridge: Intel Corporation Mobile 5 Series Chipset LPC Interface Controller (rev 06)\n00:1f.2 SATA controller: Intel Corporation 5 Series/3400 Series Chipset 6 port SATA AHCI Controller (rev 06)\n00:1f.3 SMBus: Intel Corporation 5 Series/3400 Series Chipset SMBus Controller (rev 06)\n00:1f.6 Signal processing controller: Intel Corporation 5 Series/3400 Series Chipset Thermal Subsystem (rev 06)\n03:00.0 Network controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM4313 802.11b/g/n Wireless LAN Controller (rev 01)\n04:00.0 Ethernet controller: Atheros Communications Inc.

At the Linux Foundation it is noted that \n\nThe FHS 3 specification is currently under development. \n\nThey aimed to release it by 1 July this year as this article describes, so the date you saw on wikipedia was merely this date they had earmarked. It hasn't actually been released yet at the time I am writing (12 September 2012). The changes haven't been decided fully, but there are some useful links in the link above (such as the fhs mailing-lists discussion and there is a discussion at lwn.net.\nMore details on the existing specifications are available at the Linux Foundation.\n\nFor more general information, two great questions on this site explain the filesystem hierarchy well:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to understand the Ubuntu file system layout?\n\n*https://askubuntu.com/questions/165677/which-book-should-i-buy-to-learn-file-system-in-ubuntu\n\nA: The mentioned version FHS 3.0 is still in Draft 01 state . As above in Mik's answer , they aimed for July release but not yet finalized. \nUbuntu will most probably inherit the Debian FHS standard as mentioned in The Ubuntu-Policy also locally available under /var/share/doc/ubuntu-policy/fhs provided you install ubuntu-policy package to see the implemented File System in Ubuntu.\nIf you are concerned with what does Ubuntu Implements of Standard FHS 2.3 and changes or makes exception to it , to integrate itself within it . \n\nThe following exceptions to the FHS apply:\nThe optional rules related to user specific configuration files for\n  applications are stored in the user's home directory are relaxed. It\n  is recommended that such files start with the '.' character (a \"dot\n  file\"), and if an application needs to create more than one dot file\n  then the preferred placement is in a subdirectory with a name starting\n  with a '.' character, (a \"dot directory\"). In this case it is\n  recommended the configuration files not start with the '.' character.\nThe requirement for amd64 to use /lib64 for 64 bit binaries is\n  removed.\nThe requirement that /usr/local/share/man be \"synonymous\" with\n  /usr/local/man is relaxed to a recommendation.\nThe requirement that windowmanagers with a single configuration file\n  call it system.*wmrc is removed, as is the restriction that the window\n  manager subdirectory be named identically to the window manager name\n  itself.\nThe requirement that boot manager configuration files live in /etc,\n  or at least are symlinked there, is relaxed to a recommendation.\n\n\nA: FHS 3.0 is actual version: The LSB workgroup is happy to announce the release of FHS 3.0.\nUbuntu is based on Debian, which follows it, but with exceptions, when it breaks other parts of Debian Policy.\n", "Q: How do I get rid of buzzing sound while watching Youtube?

[VAR=VALUE]...\n  To assign environment variables (e.g., CC, CFLAGS...), specify them as\n  VAR=VALUE.   \nSome influential environment variables:\nPKG_CONFIG  path to pkg-config utility\n    PKG_CONFIG_PATH  directories to add to pkg-config's search path\n    PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR  path overriding pkg-config's built-in search path\n    CC          C compiler command\n    CFLAGS      C compiler flags\n    LDFLAGS     linker flags, e.g. -L< lib dir > if you have libraries in a\n                nonstandard directory\n    LIBS        libraries to pass to the linker, e.g. -l\n    CPPFLAGS    (Objective) C/C++ preprocessor flags, e.g. -I< include dir > if\n                you have headers in a nonstandard directory\n    CPP         C preprocessor\n\nYou can override the default options by specifying locations of packages or libraries if they are in non-standard locations or have different names than configure expects as this article showed. For more on flags as used in the configure script itself, see this discussion here.\nOr if the program is not to be installed in the default location (the /usr/local hierarchy) you can specify, for example\n./configure --prefix=/my/custom/location \n\nThere are many more options that can be used, and the list of commands passed to ./configure can become very long, but it is all very specific to the program you are compiling; very often no special options are needed.\n", "Q: How do I get my Epiphany buttons back?

Is there a way to stream the live output of the soundcard from our 12.04.1 LTS amd64 desktop to a DLNA-compliant external device in our network? Selecting media content in shared directories using Rygel, miniDLNA, and uShare is always fine - but so far we completely failed to get a live audio stream to a client via DLNA.\nPulseaudio claims to have a DLNA/UPnP media server that together with Rygel is supposed to do just this. But we were unable to get it running.\nWe followed the steps outlined in live.gnome.org, this answer here, and also in another similar guide. \n\nIn 12.04 LTS we can select the local audio device, or our GST-Launch stream in the DLNA client but Rygel displays the following message and the client states it reached the end of the playlist:\n(rygel:7380): Rygel-WARNING **: rygel-http-request.vala:97: Invalid seek request\n\nThere was no way to listen to live audio streams on the client.\n\nOnly after a distribution upgrade to 14.04 LTS we were able to select a live stream on our DLNA renderers from settings nicely outlined in below answer. Still, we needed to select an established stream after we started rygel and were unable to push a new stream to our UPnP devices. Audio metadata were not transmitted.\n\nAre there any other alternatives for sending the audio of our soundcard as live stream to a DLNA client?\n\nA: Pavucontrol is the missing item in this jigsaw puzzle! I had also set up everything correctly and the external device(LG TV) was showing that the sound was being played but I did not hear any sound. Today I installed pavucontrol and when I opened it I found the option to channel sound through the DLNA server. The DLNA option is only shown when there is sound output from a player to pulseaudio.\n\n\nA: Pulseaudio-DLNA\nI created a little server which discovers all upnp renderers in your network and adds them as sinks to pulseaudio. So you can control every application via pavucontrol to play on your upnp devices.\nThat's the kind of comfort I always wanted when dealing with upnp devices under linux.\nThe application can be installed from source or DEB package downloadable from git, or after we had added the project's official ppa:qos/pulseaudio-dlna to our sources with:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install pulseaudio-dlna\n\nWe then run pulseaudio-dlna from the command line with following options:\npulseaudio-dlna [--host <host>] [--port <port>] [--encoder <encoder>] [--renderer-urls <urls>] [--debug]\npulseaudio-dlna [-h | --help | --version]\n\nSee also the pulseaudio-dlna \"About\" for more.\nWhen there was a DLNA renderer present we can then select it from the sound menu as an output sink:\n\n\nA: I'm sorry I can't help you with Rygel at all, but there may be an alternative which may work for you.\nThe principle is get a program to record the stream to an audiofile, then launch miniDLNA with a custom config which points to the directory that stream is in.\nExample: Say we're working in ~/stream/. Create ~/stream/minidlna.conf\nnetwork_interface=wlan0\nmedia_dir=/home/<user>/stream/\nfriendly_name=Live Audio Stream\ndb_dir=/home/<user>/stream/\nalbum_art_names=Cover.jpg/cover.jpg/AlbumArtSmall.jpg/albumartsmall.jpg/AlbumArt.jpg/albumart.jpg/Album.jpg/album.jpg/Folder.jpg/folder.jpg/Thumb.jpg/thumb.jpg\ninotify=no\nenable_tivo=no\nstrict_dlna=no\nnotify_interval=900\nserial=12345678\nmodel_number=1\n\nThen save the stream to an audiofile in that directory. Googling for \"FFmpeg record sound card audio\" yielded this command\nffmpeg -f alsa -i default -acodec flac ~/stream/OutputStream.flac\n\nbut I didn't have much luck with it. Another option is vlc is you have a GUI available and this doesn't work.\nThen boot up miniDLNA in another terminal window:\nminidlna -d -f ~/stream/minidlna.conf -P ~/stream/minidlna.pid\n\nIt should locate OutputStream.flac and then be accessible from your network device. \nHopefully if you haven't already got it solved that's given you a few ideas.\n\nA: One idea I had to stream \"what I hear\" to a DLNA renderer (like WDTV) was to server the stream with VLC as http stream with pulse://alsa_output.xxx.monitor as input and transcode it to MP3 or FLAC. Then I wanted to use some DLNA control point to let the renderer play taht stream. VLC does serve the transcoded stream correctly, but it does not allow to set the mime type, so the renderer refuses to play it.\nThe next idea was to write a http server in python that serves the stream instead. It gets the audio stream from pulse with parec, encodes it with flac (or lame or whatever you want) and sets the mime type correctly.\nIt works with the following (very simple) script:\n#!/usr/bin/python\n\nimport BaseHTTPServer\nimport SocketServer\nimport subprocess\n\nPORT = 8080\n# run \"pactl list short |grep monitor\" to see what monitors are available\n# you may add a null sink for streaming, so that what is streamed is not played back locally\n# add null sink with \"pactl load-module module-null-sink\"\nMONITOR = 'null.monitor'\nMIMETYPE = 'audio/flac'\nENCODER = 'flac - -c --channels 2 --bps 16 --sample-rate 44100 --endian little --sign signed'\nBUFFER = 65536\n\nclass Handler(BaseHTTPServer.BaseHTTPRequestHandler):\ndef do_HEAD(s):\n    print s.client_address, s.path, s.command\n    s.send_response(200)\n    s.send_header('content-type', MIMETYPE)\n    s.end_headers()\ndef do_GET(s):\n    s.do_HEAD()\n    pa = subprocess.Popen('parec -d {} | {}'.format(MONITOR, ENCODER), shell = True, bufsize = BUFFER, stdout = subprocess.PIPE)\n    while True:\n        data = pa.stdout.read(1024)\n        if len(data) == 0: break\n        s.wfile.write(data)\n    print 'stream closed'\n\n\nhttpd = SocketServer.TCPServer((\"\", PORT), Handler)\n\nprint \"listening on port\", PORT\n\ntry:\nhttpd.serve_forever()\nexcept KeyboardInterrupt:\npass\n\nhttpd.server_close()\n\nAdjust the parameters, run it, and point the DLNA renderer to your machine. It worked for me with a WDTV as renderer and an Android phone with BubbleUPnP as control point (You can type in the stream URL when adding a new item to the playlist manually). But it should work with any DLNA compliant devices.\n\nA: NOTE:  This solution works, but a newer and probably better solution has been proposed by Massimo.\nHere's an answer for Ubuntu 14.04 (also tested and working on 15.04), for completeness:\n\n\n*\n\n*install any needed packages:  sudo apt-get install rygel rygel-preferences rygel-gst-launch\n\n*create the file ~/.config/rygel.conf that contains the following:\n[GstLaunch]\nenabled=true\ntitle=@REALNAME@'s stream\nlaunch-items=myaudioflac;myaudiompeg\n\nmyaudioflac-title=FLAC audio on @HOSTNAME@\nmyaudioflac-mime=audio/flac\nmyaudioflac-launch=pulsesrc device=upnp.monitor ! flacenc quality=8\n\nmyaudiompeg-title=MPEG audio on @HOSTNAME@\nmyaudiompeg-mime=audio/mpeg\nmyaudiompeg-launch=pulsesrc device=upnp.monitor ! lamemp3enc target=quality quality=6\n\n[Playbin]\nenabled=true\ntitle=Audio/Video playback on @REALNAME@'s computer\n\n[general]\ninterface=\nupnp-enabled=true\n\n[MediaExport]\nuris=\n\n\n*Execute the following commands from the commandline (these could be put into a script if desired):\npactl load-module module-http-protocol-tcp\npactl load-module module-rygel-media-server \nrygel &\n\n\n*Run the paprefs command, and ensure that both DLNA options are enabled (checked) on the \"Network Server\" tab.\n\n*Play some audio on your computer.  Run the pavucontrol program, and on the \"Playback\" tab, change the output device to \"DLNA/UPnP Streaming\".\nAt this point, you should be able to play the MPEG and FLAC streams from a DLNA client (renderer / control point).\nNOTE: you may need to restart your computer (or restart pulse) in order for things to begin to work.\n\nA: The python script from Adam is just what I needed. Brilliant. Rygel with gst-launch doesn't work with one of my renderers, but this script works with both. In my case I'm taking an audio stream input from squeezelite (for squeezebox) and sending to a renderer.  The script also works in the original form to take input from a pulseaudio monitor if that's what is needed.\nKnowing little about any of this I managed to make some additions to the script that:\ni) allow it to be run from a shell script and be terminated with a SIGTERM/SIGKILL (the 'except' statement now includes 'systemexit')\nii) allows the script to be stopped and restarted and re-use the same port (as it was the restarted script tended to fail saying it could not open the port if the renderer still had it open) - (the allow_reuse_address = True statement)\niii) make a version that takes input from stdin and resamples it using sox to output in wav format (on port 8082) \nSo my version looks like:\n#!/usr/bin/python\n\nimport BaseHTTPServer\nimport SocketServer\nimport subprocess\n\nPORT = 8082\n\nMIMETYPE = 'audio/x-wav'\nBUFFER = 65536\n\nclass Handler(BaseHTTPServer.BaseHTTPRequestHandler):\n  def do_HEAD(s):\n    print s.client_address, s.path, s.command\n    s.send_response(200)\n    s.send_header('content-type', MIMETYPE)\n    s.end_headers()\n  def do_GET(s):\n    s.do_HEAD()\n    pa = subprocess.Popen('sox -t raw -r 96000 -b 24 -L -e signed -c 2 - -t wav -r 44100 -b 16 -L -e signed -c 2 - ', shell = True, bufsize = BUFFER, stdout = subprocess.PIPE)\n    while True:\n        data = pa.stdout.read(1024)\n        if len(data) == 0: break\n        s.wfile.write(data)\n    print 'stream closed'\n\nSocketServer.TCPServer.allow_reuse_address = True\nhttpd = SocketServer.TCPServer((\"\", PORT), Handler)\n\nprint \"listening on port\", PORT\n\ntry:\n httpd.serve_forever()\n\nexcept (KeyboardInterrupt, SystemExit):\n pass\n\nhttpd.server_close()\n\n\nA: Not sure if this is will be useful for you now, but I written a post about getting this to work on Ubuntu 12.10:\nhttp://dpc.ucore.info/blog/2012/11/07/dlna-streaming-in-ubuntu-12-dot-10/\n", "Q: Recovering an Ubuntu installation - Ubuntu eats itself after 'sudo apt-get install -f' Updater (I assume) put a no entry style alert icon on the panel which informed me that certain package dependencies were not up to snuff.  Upgrades were thereafter only partial.  The dialogue advised that I sudo apt-get install -f.  I did this hoping that app-get would fulfil dependencies and replace corrupted files and watched it systematically remove every component of linux, both the stuff I had installed and the core ubuntu packages.  I could only assume at this stage that this was in preparation for a fresh install but, of course, I know better now - if you find yourself with apt-get warning you that you are about to remove several hundred packages and asking you to type an involved confirmation string seek advice before proceeding.  I digress.  This was a 64 bit install of 12.04.  All that is left is grub pointing to a couple of windows recovery partitions on the hard drive.  Thankfully the Ext4 partition is reachable from a stick boot.\nEDIT:\nI've logged onto the machine with a 64 bit stick and can see the file structure left behind by apt-get after {ahem} fixing.  My first instinct was to run install from the stick but it seemed to want to do another install rather than a repair.  My question then: is there a way to recover the current installation so that if I reinstall the packages I had they will pick up the original settings?  I'm particularly worried about losing email from evolution - the rest I could probably lash back together.\nAs for the use of PPA I'm not sure what you're driving at.  I generally use Ubuntu Software Centre to install software, though I have used terminal scripts to add new repositories and software successfully following guidance on various websites.  The most recent change I made was a downgrade of Wine in an attempt to install and run excel2007 (a necessity, I think, as I have VBA work to do).  The installer had stalled and had to be killed.  I wonder if that corrupted whatever database holds a model of the package installation structure.\nI would also be interested to know how this disaster came about.  I see people in the know recommending the sudo apt-get install -f as a fairly innocuous cure in similar circumstances.\nThanks for your attention,\nTony Martin\np.s. Do please forgive the rant aspects of the original post.  It's hard to write rationally with a large hole in the pit of your stomach.\n\nA: This disaster tends to come about when a broken package (typically one with dependencies that cannot be installed due to their not existing or the user having set up a hold on a specific package version) is present or when the user has installed conflicting dependencies from a PPA. The -f flag tells apt-get to find any solution it can to remove all breakage from the system. In this case the 'solution' was to remove almost every package, so you must have had a really low level conflict somewhere. It looks at what dependency appears to not be installable and either installs or removes packages until it can install that dependency or until all packages that conflict are gone. I once had every piece of GUI software right down to X removed because of an improperly packaged version of Libreoffice.\nYou can see from this image that a bad wine package from a PPA could indeed kill the whole system:\n\nIf libc6 were to be replaced via a PPA with another version that would indeed cause APT to remove the whole system. Just about everything winds up depending on libc6 in the end, including the kernel I think. I'm not saying for sure this was it, just using this as an example to show how dependencies are interconnected.\nYou can use the LiveUSB to copy your files over before reinstalling or just reinstall with the advanced partitioning settings. I recommend just using the advanced settings to reinstall because it saves you copying any files off the disk, so long as you've not stored anything outside of /home and /srv.\nYou need to make sure that your ext4 filesystem is set to mount to '/' and that the box under 'Format' is not checked like it is in this image:\n\nAnything not stored in /srv or /home will be DELETED.\nIf you wish to use the same username you should move or rename your home folder before reinstalling so it can be recreated with fresh configs from /etc/skel. You can then copy configuration files and data from where you moved it to their proper places after the reinstall. This is necessary as some programs (Firefox for example) will not pick up the config files from your old install automatically even if they're already in the home folder the first time you log in. Some programs need to be run first, quit, and then have their configuration files copied over. \nI'm pretty sure for evolution you can just copy the .evolution file from your old home to the new one and have it work normally. You may need to run evolution once and close it before copying over like I mentioned above.\nAs per your comment on how to properly solve this issue, the manual for apt-get (the section about -f) suggests using dpkg --remove $PACKAGE to remove the package causing the problem manually. This should allow apt to run again as the package trying to pull in non-existent or un-installable dependency will be gone. \nThe problem that killed your machine is a fluke, it simply should not ever happen on a stable release of Ubuntu. The repository system is organized to prevent this from happening, but the addition of random PPA X throws a wrench into what is otherwise a perfect system. I suggest you examine closely the contents of your added PPAs and which software packages are installed (and upgraded to) from them. Several PPAs will upgrade important system packages in order to make the software they contain work. This is great until the newer dependency from the PPA conflicts with the older one in the repo. At this point APT will always install the newest one, and boom, your system will not upgrade any packages because the Ubuntu repo software is still in need of the older library version, which is not going to be installed.\nThe best of luck to you. Please comment if you have questions or if I can improve this answer.\n\nA: The addition of repos and wine downgrades may have caused issues. Perhaps once you reinstall, you could use Playonlinux to tun Word? It includes auto-setup and selects the right Wine version and settings automatically. It doesn't muck with APT too much, so it is safer. While it involves using a repository, this one works well and will not cause issues as long as the correct version of Ubuntu is selected. As for getting your settings back, you can mount your partition from the live CD and then in your home folder, press Ctrl+H and copy the .evolution folder to a flash drive. You can also copy other folders you may want, and then restore them on your new installation.\nI have tested PlayOnLinux with Office '07 and it works very well.

Pairing when I had a gui worked flawlessly.\nI've asked for help here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=12234695\nNo one has replied but a lot of details of my situation is available there.\nHow is one supposed to pair bluetooth devices from the command line?\n\nA: Pair a new device\nIn Bluez4 install the bluez  package to be able to pair a device from the command line with bluez-simple-agent (Bluez5 will provide the bluetoothctl command):\nbluez-simple-agent hci# xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx\n\nReplace # with the Bluetooth adapter number (e.g. hci0) and xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx with the MAC of our Bluetooth device.\n\n*\n\n*To get the number of our adapter we may issue:\n  hciconfig\n\n\n\n*The MAC of devices can be scanned for with the following command:\n  hcitool scan\n\nThe Bluetooth device should be in pairing mode of course. Enter the pin code when asked to pair the device.\n\nRemove a paired device\nIf we already had paired a device and need to remove it from the database (e.g. for re-pairing) we may do so with\nbluez-simple-agent hci# xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx remove\n\n\nNote for keyboards (or mice): Until the Bluetooth keyboard is paired we may need to enter the PIN using an additional wired keyboard. See with the manual of your keyboard how the pairing is done (some expect PIN in computer first, some in keyboard first. Some may have a fixed PIN).\nAfter pairing, we connect the keyboard with:\nsudo bluez-test-input connect xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx \n\nTo allow auto-connection after a reboot we can add the device to the trusted devices:\nsudo bluez-test-device trusted xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx yes\n\n\nA: After searching a lot I've found two solutions. One is bluetoothctl which is performs exactly what you are looking for. You can do almost anything from command line :) Because I'm lazy and my memory is still on HDD I need some applet as well, so I've installed bluedevil on my mate desktop :) it is working except scanning, but it is fine like this\n", "Q: How to change music output in moc, alsa I've been using moc for a while on a laptop and it is great, but then I wanted to plug in USB radio as an output, rhythmbox and other players detected new output device, but moc has output hardcoded in ~/.moc/config, where is stated:\n# Sound driver - OSS, ALSA, JACK, SNDIO (on OpenBSD) or null (only for\n# debugging).\n# You can enter more than one driver as a colon-separated list.

Some tutorial on devices and some additional help is needed.\nI suppose, I have to change something in alsa, but neither in moc nor in alsamixer, I do not know how to check, where is my usb device and what to change.\n\nA: I assume you are not using Jack audio server, but common Alsa:\nProblem should probably be this line, which tells MOC to use default Alsa device (which is probably the internal sound card):\nAlsaDevice              = default\n\nSolution #1:\nChange your Alsa default device every time you insert your USB audio stuff. That is nicely mentioned at Alsa FAQ page: http://alsa.opensrc.org/FAQ026\nThis can perhaps be scripted using udev (but that's another question I guess)\nSolution #2:\nCreate second config file for MOC with different setting of AlsaDevice variable and everytime you run MOC, setup which config to use with --config $FILE. But I am not sure how to set properly AlsaDevice setting in MOC\n", "Q: What package (helper app) does recoll need to index images?

The message on the screen is :\n\n\"Not all updates can be installed\".\n\nAnd then I click partial upgrade. Then the message on the screen is :\n\n\"Error authenticating some packages\".\n\nThen the upgrade fail. I try to upgrade many times but the two message always appear. I still can use 11.10 but always fail upgrade to 12.04. What should I do?\n\nA: It looks like there are some source of repository that makes troubles.\nMake sure to have updated your apt repositories: in the terminal type apt-get update.\nThen you can try typing in the terminal apt-get dist-upgrade.\nIf there is some problem with the packages authentication you will be prompted a confirmation message to which you should answer yes.\nSometimes it happens also to me, even with normal upgrades, not distribution upgrade, because likely in the updating process there were problems. Maybe it can be the same problem.\n\nA: Before an upgrade, you should install all updates.\nBut I advise against the upgrade! It makes things more complicated, because some packages are entirely different in new versions. Moreover, the risk of data loss is very high.\nYou can consider renewing the installation; it will keep your data and even personal settings. According the documentation:\n\nRenewing the Installation without formating the partitons (in contrast to upgrading), will also keep the personal data and configurations under /home but will renew all system settings under /etc as well as the default set of installed packages. \n\nBefore renewing the installation, be sure that the /home directory is on a seperate partition; if not follow the procedure to do so.\nMy experience:\nI upgraded 11.04 to 11.10 last year. Everything was OK, but the performance loss was sensible; for example, shutdown was taking more time (sometimes twice and sometimes four times more). Some days ago, I installed the new 12.04 without formatting the /home partition; I was surprised when I saw even my desktop backgraound was not changed.\nI just needed to reinstall my apps; but not my preferences and data for those apps. For example, when I reinstall Tomboy Notes all of my notes appeared automatically without any backup or doing anything.\n", "Q: How do I install Gyachi on PPC Ubuntu?

http://forums.opensuse.org/english/get-technical-help-here/wireless/478006-cant-get-wireless-working-12-2-a-3.html\nI wanted to confirm that I tried the instructions on this page and it worked. Unfortunately the firmware file /lib/firmware/rtlwifi/rtl8192cfwU_B.bin is NOT in Ubuntu 12.04 . It IS available in 12.10 (Quantal), which is beta right now. AFTER you patch compat-wireless and install it, just download the quantal version of linux-firmware.deb and do something like:\ndpkg-deb -x linux-firmware_1.94_all.deb\n\nin a tmp directory, which will extract lib/firmware/rtlwifi/ etc . Just take the bin file and throw it in /lib/firmware/rlwifi, then modprobe -rv rtl8192ce, to unload the module, then modprobe rtl8192ce, to reload. \ndmesg should have a line that says:\nrtl8192ce: Using firmware rtlwifi/rtl8192cfwU_B.bin\nI haven't tried quantal 12.10 yet, but I suspect it'll be fixed in that version. Until then, there is the manual patching of compat-wireless that the SuSE post suggests.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 disc mounting issues I recently upgraded to Ubuntu 12.04 from 10.04.  My laptop has two hard disks and when I mount the second disk, I no longer have any control over the file permissions (even in su mode).  So none of the software I have installed on that disk works anymore.  How do I fix this?\n\nA: Okay, from what I read there you have /dev/sdb4 which is mounted as your root filesystem. You also have /dev/sda2 which is your swap. Otherwise there seem to be no partitions on your hard disk. Which is most likely part of the issue. Please open a terminal, type \"sudo blkid\" and post the output here. If you don't know how to use a terminal, use google.\nPlease also use pastebin.com if you want to paste code here. The idea is, that you go there, paste your code, get a link, get back here and paste the link. Keeps everything clean and readable.\nCheers\n", "Q: How do I \"sync\" read/unread with Thunderbird and Hotmail After a fresh install of 12.04, I'm trying to use thunderbird for the first time, instead of a web browser (first of all, is it better and/or safer?). I noticed that, at least for hotmail, read emails aren't synchronized and remain unread in thunderbird if I read them in hotmail, and reciprocally.\nIs there a way to change that ?\n\nA: I should say that I am always quite surprise to see Ubuntu users complain about the fact that Thunderbird should supports closed standard... IMAP exists and is the solution. So if you want to be able to sync your mails status, you should just use another mail address.\n", "Q: Better than VirtualBox I installed Ubuntu with a VirtualBox on my mac. But the more I use Ubuntu, the more I install package, the more it becomes very slow to launch on my VirtualBox. By the way, it makes slow all the apps running on my mac. Is there any other virtual environment more efficient than VirtualBox ?\n\nA: Before going into detail about Virtualbox, VMware or any other virtualization technology there are a couple of things that need to be checked. When starting to use virtualization one must have the correct hardware or better yet, a more capable and optimized hardware to help with virtualization:\n\n\n*\n\n*CPU and Motherboard technologies like AMD's AMD-V and Intel's VT-X provide a huge leap in performance over hardware that does not have it, specially in the Input/Output.\n\n*Assuming that we have the CPU/Mobo cover, we then look into the amount of memory available. Virtualization requires in most cases that we assign real amounts of memory to a virtualized guest. The more memory assign to the guest, the less memory we have available for the host. So this memory sharing game can improve performance for the guest while lowering for the host or it can be enough to have both running perfectly.\n\n*After this, we then have hard disk performance. Is not the same to use a 5400RPM HDD than a 7200RPM HDD than a SSD. The amount of reads and writes the virtualization will do, plus the amount the host will be doing can make the HDD the bottleneck of the problem if the HDD is very slow.\n\n*Lastly in the hardware part we have the video and sound card. If the host has an Intel card that can only deliver OpenGL 1.x, we can't expect that the guest will offer OpenGL 4.x. The guest will work with whatever is available from the real graphics card (assuming the virtualization technology and OS allow direct access to the video card). Same goes for the sound.\nSo taking into consideration the CPU, Motherboard, RAM, HDD and Video/Audio we can play with it and have a virtualized hardware ready host.\nIf all requirements are met, then we can proceed to see what host OS to use. Some OSes are better at working with virtualization technology than others. Some are even better on specific hardware. The mileage depends on the hardware and OS involved.\nWith that in mind, in the software department, the guest OS also changes the game. Depending on the OS used in the guest, and the type of OS used in the host, it can have a positive or negative effect on overall performance.\nSo as you can see there are a lot of variables. Along with everything mentioned above, we also end with the question of: \n\n\n*\n\n*How will you use the virtualized environment? For what purpose or need?\n\n*What virtualization technology is better for me? Virtualbox, VMWare, Parallels (since you mention a MAC), KVM, QEMU, etc...\n\n*What version to use and what does each version offer?\n\n*Does it repair a bug that affected me?, does it increase or decrease performance?\n\n*Will I be using it with a network interface, creating a virtual LAN, accessing a remote PC or offering a remote connection?\n\n*What Host is better with a specific virtualization software and what Guest is better for it?\nSo here are many questions that one must ask before going into the virtualization world.\nMy suggestions and also to add to your question would be to add the type of hardware you have and what type of use you will be doing with Virtualbox.\n\nA: Any performance issues with virtualization are generally caused by either having insufficient host hardware, or having a very hardware-intensive host. The virtual environment is rarely an issue. This means that that the physical machine you are running Ubuntu on(your mac) does not have enough resources for a fast boot. You may want to upgrade that machine.\nHowever, certain settings can improve performance. Make sure that under the VM's options, AMD-V/VT-x is enabled, as well as nested paging. If they cause issues, disable nested paging first, then the AMD-V if the problem is not resolved. Also, make sure you have at least 768MB dedicated to Ubuntu. At least 1.5GB is recommended i you have enough RAM in your system. of course, a faster CPU will make booting and running faster. \nAnother note: Running memory tests in VirtualBox is useless. If there is indeed an issue with your memory, the host would probably crash, not the guest.\n", "Q: File transfer indicator applet?

For some reason, whenever I double-click a .xcf file in Nautilus or open it from the Dash, the file tries to load in Inkscape (with an error message) instead of in GIMP by default. I have both applications installed and I am using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.\nHow do I get these files to open in GIMP by default instead?\n\nA: Right click on the file go to properties, then \"open\" or \"open with\" (Haven't used GNOME in a while). Then choose GIMP as your standard and press ok.\n\nA: You can make a right click on that file, choose \"properties\" and then the tab \"open with\", there you can choose GIMP as standard application.\n", "Q: How do I enable SHMConfig? I don't know how to enable SHMConfig on Ubuntu 12.04 so that I can run synclient -m 100 correctly.\nI searched and solutions were with HAL daemon, but I don't have HAL, I think it was deprecated.  Thanks\n\nA: Enter this command, it will give you access to change files on Nautilus\nsudo nautilus\n\nEnter Password → File System → USR → share → X11 → xorg.conf.d →\n 50-synaptics.conf\nNow you should see this text and find the part that looks like this\nSection \"InputClass\"\n        Identifier \"touchpad catchall\"\n        Driver \"synaptics\"\n        MatchIsTouchpad \"on\"\n\nThis option is recommend on all Linux systems using evdev, but you want to add *Option \"SHMConfig\" \"on\" under MathIsTouchpad \"on\" so it looks like this:\nSection \"InputClass\"\n        Identifier \"touchpad catchall\"\n        Driver \"synaptics\"\n        MatchIsTouchpad \"on\"\n        Option \"SHMConfig\" \"on\"\n\nSave and exit and reboot.\nHope that helps.\n\nA: As mentioned in the synaptics(4) man page, the SHMConfig option can no longer be used to configure the driver:\nOption \"SHMConfig\" \"boolean\"\n      Switch  on/off shared memory for run-time debugging. This option\n      does not have an effect on run-time configuration anymore and is\n      only useful for hardware event debugging.\n\nThe preferred way to configure input devices now is through the XInput extension.  The xinput command line tool provides one such way to do this.  You can get a list of the input devices on the system with the following command:\nxinput list\n\nUsing the numeric ID of the touchpad, you can list its properties with:\nxinput list-props $device_id\n\nYou can then alter properties with a command like:\nxinput set-prop $device_id $property_id value\n\nI am not sure which property corresponds to synclient's -m option, but if it is still available to tweak you should see it here.\n", "Q: How to change low process priority? I have just set Ubuntu 12.04 64bit with Cinnamon desktop and 3.5.0-030500 kernel on my new laptop with IvyBridge i7.\nI decided to test its performance by running a single threaded CPU-hungry program that I often use for camera calibration. Unfortunately, it ended up running much slower than I have ever expected. After some investigation it turned out that the program priority is automatically changed from normal to low which makes the program even slower.\nI have also noticed that all user programs such as Skype and Firefox are set to low priority. I tried manually resetting the priority to normal or even very high using the renice command, which works temporary until the kernel scheduler (I guess) resets the priority to low.\nIs this a normal behaviour and how can I overcome the slow execution problem?\nP.S. I also tried with the 3.2 kernel, but the problem is still present.\n\nA: You can set the default nice value of a particular user or group in the /etc/security/limits.conf file.\n/etc/security/limits.conf\n\nIt uses this syntax: [username] [hard|soft] priority [nice value]\nFor you try to put your user in this file and set to the priority you wish.\n\nA: Here is a way to increase priority permanently for the Firefox in the Ubuntu.

When I move the slider off of zero, the status goes to \"Mute\".\nSo, does anyone know what's going on with my system?\n\nA: When you click on the speaker icon, it shows you the action and not status.

I need to create some space to that I can dual-boot with Windows. Looking at Gparted, it seems that to do that, I need to unmount my /dev/sda1 which contains my Ubuntu system. While searching online, it seems that people were doing it for removable media, but I'm working with one hard drive. Is it safe to unmount to create some space?\n\nA: You cannot unmount a partition while you are using it.  The way to do it is to boot from a live CD or USB drive, and run gparted from there.  Then you will usually be able to resize any partitions on your hard drive.  \nThe original Ubuntu disk will work, as will specialized utility disks like gparted magic, but all of them simply use gparted to do the work.\n\nA: You cannot unmount the file system that you are booted into currently. What you should do is to boot into Ubuntu live and launch gparted from there. Since it is live, none of your partitions will be mounted and you can resize any partition according to your whim.\n\nA: After booting from a LiveCD or LiveUSB, then run Gparted; to unmount the extended partition, FIRST turn off the swap partition (part of extended partition) by right clicking on swap and selecting \"swapoff\". This should unmount the extended partition at the same time. Was having this problem booting from a LiveUSB, couldn't unmount the extended partition; puzzled, then by accident discovered that unmounting the swap partition would unmount both.

So, it seems that your PAM setup is broken. You'll need to reinstall whatever package owns that file. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to determine which package that is (I'm running 12.04 and apparently that file isn't needed on my machine).\nHere's a suggestion about what you can do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into a chroot environment (follow steps 1-5 here) or into recovery mode. If you use a liveCD or USB, be sure that you use one for the same version that you have installed!\n\n*Try to see if dpkg knows about the file:\ndpkg --search /lib/security/pam_access.so\n\nIf it finds the package, you're all set. Just reinstall that package:\napt-get reinstall package-name\n\n\n*If step 2 fails, it's time to get the big guns out. You'll want to reinstall every PAM-related package on your system.\n\n\n*\n\n*Save the following Python script somewhere. It will list all your PAM packages that are currently installed.\n#!/usr/bin/env python\nimport apt\nimport re\n\nexp = re.compile('^(lib)?pam')\nprint ' '.join([i.name for i in apt.Cache() if i.is_installed and exp.search(i.name)])\n\n\n*Reinstall away:\napt-get reinstall $(python name_of_your_script.py)\n\n\n\n*If that isn't enough, you can get really heavy-handed, but think very carefully before doing this as it can easily have lots of unintended consequences. It could potentially install a bunch of unrelated stuff on your system. You should first check whether you can find another way of repairing PAM.\nIf you determine that you need to take this step, modify the script you created in step 3. Remove the following from the script: i.is_installed and. Make sure you remove exactly that and double-check that you didn't make a mistake.

In my case I use Logitech M510 mice on all of my machines, but rather than using the browse \"forward\" and \"back\" buttons (the buttons by the thumb) to browse the Internet, I prefer to use them for the middle mouse button.  When I spend an hour or more modelling in Blender my middle finger will get sore otherwise.  To make this change, I need to configure the X device itself using the \"xinput\" command.\nI first need to find the device we want to work with, in this case my Logitech M510 mouse.  This can be done by first listing all of the X devices using the xinput command as follows:\n$ xinput\n⎡ Virtual core pointer                          id=2    [master pointer  (3)]\n⎜   ↳ Virtual core XTEST pointer                id=4    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ Microsoft Natural® Ergonomic Keyboard 4000        id=11   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ Logitech Unifying Device.

We will get the existing button map as follows:\n$ xinput get-button-map 12 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24    \n\nThis is the current button map.  Think of this as an array of buttons and each of the values is the \"function\" of the button at that index.  Unfortunately I can't quite      recall how I came to this conclusion, but on my mouse I want to change the functions of the buttons, 8, 9, and 10 to behave like button 2.  I do this by changing the function numbers for those buttons and setting it back as the button map for the X device as follows:\n$ xinput set-button-map 12 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 2 2 2 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24\n\nTo make this a permanent solution, I add the above command to my .profile to be executed when I login.  However, the device ID could change from boot to boot depending on what devices are attached to the computer.  To avoid this grep and awk can be used to find the device ID and feed it to the xinput command as follows:\nMOUSE_ID=`xinput list | grep -i Logitech | awk -F= '{ print $2}' | awk '{print $1}'` `xinput set-button-map $MOUSE_ID 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 2 2 2 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23`\n\nThe above lines are added to the .profile file and the device will dynamically be located from the xinput list and remap the button functions as we desire them to be.  Note however, that Logitech in the above example is vague (as I only have 1 Logitech device), so from the output of the xinput command you may need to fill in something more specific for grep to match with.\n", "Q: kernel panic - not syncing : attempted to kill init! yes this problem might have been reported and solved for a lot of people on the Internet but i haven't found anyone who is running their Ubuntu 12.04 from a USB drive. i crashed my hard disk a long time ago and now am running Ubuntu from a USB drive since a few months. i have rebooted and booted a lot of times. i had to update the source file because i could not open software center, i have restarted after that as well.\nnow am facing this error :\n kernel panic - not syncing : attempted to kill init! \n\n' panic occurred, switching back to text console ' and a lot of other text and error before that. i recently ran a few softwares on wine but didn't work ( i think that might have to do something with the error ).\nPlease let me know what i can do. i have a few important documents on the drive but i can not copy them from the USB because well i don't know where on earth it stores it. i even tried searching the file names but it did not work.\nplease look at the photo for the errors.\n\n\nA: Into rescue mode,use the CD-ROM\nbash-3.2#fdisk -l\n\nbash-3.2#mkdir /mnt/sysimage\n    bash-3.2#mount /dev/sda1  /mnt/sysimage\n    bash-3.2#cd /mnt/sysimage\n    bash-3.2#ls\n\n\n    bash-3.2#grub\n    grub> root (hd0,0)\n    grub> setup (hd0)\n\nthen reboot\ninto  grub shell:\n    grub> root (hd0,0)\n\n    grub> kernel /vmlinuz-2.6.18-194.el5 ro root=/dev/sda2\n\n    grub> initrd /initrd-2.6.18-194.el5.img\n\n    grub> boot\n\n", "Q: I run `sudo apt-get remove python2.7`, can I restore my Ubuntu now? I wanted to remove and reinstall python2.7 interpreter on 12.04\nBut when I did sudo apt-get remove python2.7, The crazy terminal started to remove everything!!! Any idea how I can restore whatever I've removed? \n\nA: While reinstalling Ubuntu is probably the easiest way, it's worth pointing out that it's possible to recover without reinstalling everything.\nTo do this, manually download the python2.7 package (and its dependencies), and manually install them using dpkg (bypassing APT, which requires Python). Once that's installed, apt should work again, and so apt-get install ubuntu-desktop will restore your system. (If apt-get still doesn't work, you might also need to download and install any missing dependencies.)\nIn the future, if you need to reinstall a package, instead use\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall python2.7\n\nor\nsudo aptitude reinstall python2.7\n\nwhich reinstalls the package without having to remove the dependencies.\n\nA: If it's not too late for anyone, or if you have come across this problem lately, this is how I got it running:\nI followed Mechanical snail's advice and downloaded all the packages using Synaptic. I selected all the relevant packages, basically everything with \"python\", \"python2\", \"python3\", \"apt\", \"python-apt\", etc., that was already installed in my computer, tagged them for reinstallation, and when I hit apply, I made sure I downloaded them only.\nThen, under root, I went into the /var/cache/apt/archives folder and ran the following command to manually re-install everything I downloaded (you will see all the packages you downloaded with Synaptic in here):\ndpkg --unpack *.deb\n\nAnyway, I was getting this apt_pkg error whenever I would get an error message from a Python script in Aptana, and yesterday when I was trying to add a repo. Now at least I can add the repo with no problem, but I'm still getting the apt_pkg error whenever there is an error in my Python scripts...\nRunning the script outside of Aptana by calling python3.2 or python3 which points at 3.2 works (meaning I get the script's error without the apt_pkg error), but if I run it with python3.3 then the error is back.\n\nA: I also had the same problem.\nAnd I was able to fix it going to ctrl+alt+f1, logged in with my username and password\nthen:\n    sudo apt-get update\n    sudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop\n\nAnd it reinstalled most (if not all) the deleted files (along with unity and terminal)\n:D\n\nA: In a fit of senseless haste I removed python 2.7 and it removed a lot of packages that were dependent on it.

Packages like shutter, mysql-workbench, that were removed needed to be reinstalled. \nI checked the history in /var/log/apt and reinstalled all packages that were removed.\n\nA: Removing Python is not a good idea as much of Ubuntu depends on it. You may have seen a warning telling you which packages depend on python and thus will be removed with Python. When proceeding you end up with a quite stripped down OS.\nReinstalling Ubuntu would now be the easiest and safest way to get it back. Take care not to delete your HOME when you do so.\n\nA: you can recover using live CD using chroot\n\nA: You need to execute this: apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\nand then apt-get install gdm. When asked lightdm or gdm select gdm.\nboth as root or using sudo\n\nA: sudo apt-get purge python && sudo apt-get install python2.7 \n\nsudo apt-get install python-pip\nremoves and reinstalls python and pip, then you can install apps like flask, bottle and many others\n\neg sudo pip install flask try to install your apps with python\n\nA: During un-installation of Python, I abruptly closed the terminal. Hence Python was partially removed.\nI fixed it with the following commands\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop\nsudo apt-get install –-reinstall python-apt\nsudo apt-get install –-reinstall python2.7\n\n", "Q: How do I share storage while dual-booting Mac OS X and Ubuntu 12.04.1?

You might have to mount the partition, although I would expect Ubuntu to automatically mount it read only, so you just have to find the partition in the file browser and open it.\nOSX by default uses journaled HFS+ as it's file system. Ubuntus kernel has support for this file system built in. If you want read/write access to the OSX partition, you have to disable journaling in OSX.

two problems.  \nThe first is an ordering problem.  Reading the kernel.org manpage on udev, it mentions:\n\nAll rules files are ... processed in lexical order\n\nMeaning rules are processed in alphabetical order.  The first rule that triggers for a device creates the device file.  It looks like you've named your rule file jj-video.rules.  Looking at the output you provided of udevadm --debug test, it shows that this file is parsed LAST of all the rule files on your system.  \nTry renaming your file 00-jj-video.rules.  That should put it first in the udev rule list, and make it trigger before the other rules.\nThe second issue is with the rules themselves.  The rules read that you're trying to create /dev/webcam2 when the Logitech QuickCam Pro 3000 is plugged in and when the kernel puts it on /dev/video2.  From what you said, you don't want to match on the device name.

My desktop machine is running Ubuntu 12.04 (and will probably stay with it until the next LTS). I've got a new 120GB SSD on the way as my existing 420GB spinning disk.\nIf it makes any difference I'll be dual-booting with Windows 7 across both disks too.\nI've read some helpful answers here about /home setup and enabling TRIM, which I intend to follow. So most of my /home will be on the SSD, with only photos, videos and music on the spinning disk.\nThe question is, when I reinstall Ubuntu from CD or USB, whether I should encrypt the SSD?\nSpecifically:\n\n\n*\n\n*I'm reading that drive wear isn't much of an issue with modern SSDs as they last decades even if you spam them. Is this true?\n\n*How big a performance reduction will encrypting cause (I have an i7 Sandybridge, so I guess it can cope)?\n\n*Is it more important from a security point of view to encrypt an SSD? I think I read somewhere that it may be hard to reliably wipe data.\n\n\nBy all means answer even if you only know about one of those things.\n\nA: Answer to question #1\nAccording to this article the ssd's seem to have quite good reliability and operational times before they blow up. To quote it:\n\nLifespan: \n  The longevity of SSDs, or lack of, as the case may be, is\n  blown way out of proportion. Most will probably be surprised to hear\n  NAND memory actually has a higher MTBF (Mean Time Before Failure) than\n  DRAM. How often does your DRAM fail once you've passed the 3 month\n  mark with it? Most SSDs have a MTBF of about 1 million hours plus\n  (it's actually 1 million writes). Has anyone actually done the math on\n  that? It works out to be over 20 yrs of continuous use; 24/7. This\n  assumes adequate \"free\" space. A \"full\" drive (using more than 85% of\n  its usable space) has very few (in the number of storage locations),\n  blocks/pages/cells to work with in its normal day to day operations.\n  This forces the SSD to use and reuse the same cells over and over\n  again. The algorithm used for wear leveling goes to hell when the\n  drive doesn't have enough free space for moving data. The cells that\n  comprise the free space end up being used over and over, and will fail\n  much sooner than those on the rest of the drive.\nA lot (some say most) of the longevity of a drive actually has to do\n  with the amount of \"over provisioning\" on the drive. Over provisioning\n  is like spare parts for the drive (actually spare NAND). Artificial\n  numbers, but say you buy a 128GB SSD. That SSD may actually contain up\n  to 10% (12GB) of additional NAND that is not calculated into the drive\n  size stated by the manufacturer.\nNAND memory can/and does go bad, it's a fact of NAND life. The cells\n  of NAND are little electronic traps, that trap electrons with \"gate\"\n  technology (although not exactly the same), just like the gates of a\n  transistor that runs your CPU. These \"gates\" over time can leak, be\n  susceptible to leakage from adjacent cells, or just plain fail, among\n  other things that render their use as problematic.\nWhen an SSD's controller (firmware) determines that a cell is no\n  longer performing like it should, it will replace the data location\n  with one of the over provisioned blocks/pages, and no longer use the\n  \"defective\" location. Depending on the firmware's coding, this is\n  usually done on a \"page\" level (4 Kilobytes of space). It is basically\n  the same as when a magnetic HDD marks a sector of its spinning platter\n  as \"bad\"; although the HDD doesn't have the \"spare parts\" to replace\n  the bad sector.\n\n[EDIT]: According to this AskUbuntu Question too, Ubuntu has support for TRIM since version 10.10 Maverick Meerkat, so this should help the drive stay healthy and do a good job prolonging its lifespan.\nAnswer to question #2\nThe SandyBridge processors and later have built in processor\n    extensions for handling encryption faster. This feature is called\n    AES instruction set. From wikipedia:\nThe purpose of the instruction set is to improve the speed of\napplications performing encryption and decryption using the Advanced\nEncryption Standard (AES).\n\nAnd some instructions as an example:\n\n - AESENC -> Perform one round of an AES encryption flow\n - AESKEYGENASSIST -> Assist in AES key round generation\n\nAnswer to question #3\nYou have to understand that you do not encrypt the device itself, but the data it contains. The ssd is just another hard disk. Is the information contained encryption worthy? And more importantly, is it worth to have a performance hit everytime you want to do something? (be it negligible or not, it still will be there, and my guess is it will show when there are great amounts of data to be read or written)\n", "Q: Any good SQL shell programs? I want to practice SQL commands on Ubuntu. I would just like to play with different commands and keywords. Where can I find something that helps?\nI don't want to install any server. I need a small app; something less than 20MB. \n\nA: If you want to play around with a lightweight SQL RDBMS, SQLite (Ubuntu package) is the standard choice. You have multiple options to use SQLite:\nCommand-line\nYou can use the SQLite program directly from the command line by running\nsqlite3 /some/database/file.sqlite\n\nType commands and press Enter (remember the trailing semicolon).\nGUI\nAlternatively, you can install sqliteman, which provides a nice GUI browser for SQLite databases; you can also enter SQL code and execute it (displaying the results in the GUI):\n\nInstall via terminal:\nsudo apt-get install sqliteman\n\nOr:\n\n\n\nCaveat\nBe aware that SQLite takes some unusual design decisions for an RDBMS:\n\n\n*\n\n*No client-server architecture\n\n*Dynamically typed; SQLite does not enforce many constraints that other RDBMSs insist on. If you want to simulate MySQL-like typing, you have to explicitly add CHECK constraints.\n\n\nA: Give a try sqlline which is shell for issuing SQL to relational databases via JDBC.\nThere is a project demos page with short demo videos\n", "Q: which kernels can I safely purge?

And why?\n\nA: I assume you're using the generic-pae kernels; it's safe to remove the -server kernels, which you aren't using.\nYou must keep at least one kernel image (linux-image-2.6.38-16-generic-pae, etc.). It's recommended to keep at least 2, because if an update hoses the most recent kernel, you can still boot using the previous one.\nYou should also keep linux-image-generic-pae, which is a tiny meta-package that causes the latest kernel to be installed.\nYou should keep the corresponding headers for each kernel you keep; the headers are needed to build kernel modules for that kernel.\n", "Q: How to change menu hover text colour?

It was supposed to solve the problems she was having with windows, ie: she would constantly remove things, or try to fix problems herself. So I figured that Linux would solve those issues. However, what I didn't take into account was that she watches \" http://www.shepherdschapel.com/broadband.htm \" and when using Ubuntu, I can't seem to find a media player to make the files work. I am out of ideas. I tried kplayer, and it worked (sort of). The file that is downloaded from the site when you click the windows media player site one link is, .wax format. Which is an instruction file for windows media player. Is there anything I can do to make these videos work?\n\nA: I can't find any files in .wax format. The formats on offer from the site are .wmv and .rm as far as I can see. The videos play fine within firefox if you have vlc and the browser plugin installed as that can handle wmv streams. So install firefox and vlc and then see the note below about installing the plugin: \nNOTE: The vlc plugin for 12.04 is browser-plugin-vlc, but as you say you are running 10.04 you will need to install mozilla-plugin-vlc instead.\nAfter installing vlc and the appropriate plugin for your Ubuntu version check firefox > preferences to see if wmv files are associated properly; the screenshot below shows how they now should look (although it might be slightly different and state mozilla plugin in 10.04). If the windows media files are not associated with the plugin simply choose the plugin from the list and associate them.\nNow when you click on any video or audio .wmv streaming link from the site the media will start playing within the browser immediately; try single clicking this link or the most recent video link on the site when you read this answer.\n\n", "Q: How to enable arrow keys in Kubuntu application launcher 12.04?

That should bring up the BIOS. \n\n*Now you need to find out something like booting preferences (might be located in Boot tab or something like that). \n\n*Change the first preference to CD/DVD, this will enable you to boot from your repair/install CD/DVD.\n\n*Alternatively, you can select the first preference to be USB, in which case you can boot via LiveUSB and install Ubuntu again.\n\nA: Let me tell you how I fixed a similar issue I had. This should help you to fix yours too.\nI have dual booting Win7 and Ubuntu12.04 which was working perfectly fine. I accidently deleted the extended logical volume(partition 4) when in Windows and there is no boot now with grub rescue prompt after I shutdown Windows.\nConfiguration of my Single disk with 6 partitions:\npartition 1= primary partition;\npartition 2= primary partition = Win7;\npartition 3= logical drive in extended partition;\npartition 4= logical drive in extended partition;\npartition 5= primary partition = Unbuntu12.04;\npartition 6= primary partition = swap\nSo now the partition number that grub is searching for a bootfile is (hd0,msdos7) whereas the bootfile is actually located at (hd0,msdos6) due to the partition delete. \nYou can check this by the command \"set\" at grub rescue prompt. This shows me that the partition set to boot is (hd0,msdos7).\nTo show all partitions use \"ls\":\ngrub rescue>  ls\n(hd0,msdos7) (hd0,msdos6) (hd0,msdos5) (hd0,msdos2) (hd0,msdos1)  \nThen check for bootfile in each partition:\ngrub rescue>  ls (hd0,msdos7)/boot ... unknown filesystem\ngrub rescue>  ls (hd0,msdos5)/boot ... unknown filesystem\ngrub rescue>  ls (hd0,msdos6)/boot ... grub ... initrd.img-2.6.32-33-generic ... vmlinuz-2.6.32-33-generic....... \nSo now we know the actual bootfile is at (hd0,msdos6).\nNow set this bootlocation temporarily in bootloader and boot into the OS:\ngrub rescue>  set root=(hd0,msdos6)\ngrub rescue>  set prefix=(hd0,msdos6)/boot/grub\ngrub rescue>  insmod normal\ngrub rescue>  normal\nThis boots us directly into the OS. \nOnce I booted into Windows, I downloaded and used the free windows program AOMEI Partition Assistant Standard Edition 5.5 to restore the deleted volume. After that I restarted Windows all works fine like nothing happened.\nSomething funny with Windows7 here. Apparently diskpart thinks the primary partitions 5 and 6 are logical drives (diskpart>select disk 0     >list partition) whereas Disk Management shows the same partitions of Ubuntu as primary partitions.\n", "Q: How can I confirm that I'm using ecryptfs?

To make it easy for the user to start the program I started to generate a cfg-file. For this reason I installed libconf. Unfortunately on compiling with a example file of libconfig I get this message. \ngcc $(pkg-config --cflags --libs libconfig) example1.c -o example1 example.cfg\n\n\n\nexample1.c: In Function »main«: example1.c:43:13: Warning: Format »%s« expected argumenttyp »char *«, but argument 3   has typ »int« [-Wformat]\n\n.....\n\nAs I got told I installed sudo apt-get install libconfig8-dev and was hoping not setting up any PKG_CONFIG_PATH. It looks like it's not compiling correct.\n\nA: How did you obtain and install libconfig?\nIf you just installed the libconfig8 package, that is not enough. You also need to install the -dev package corresponding to it, in order to provide the development files (headers, static link library, and pkg-config data). I was able to find that for libconfig for precise on packages.ubuntu.com. So\nsudo apt-get install libconfig8-dev\nshould do the trick.\nAs you can see from here, the file list for this package contains the following file path:\n/usr/lib/pkgconfig/libconfig.pc\nThis is precisely the file that pkg-config needs to be able to pull out the CFLAGS and LDFLAGS corresponding to libconfig.\nThis directory is on the \"built-in' pkg-config search path out of the box on Ubuntu. For this reason, it is not necessary to set PKG_CONFIG_PATH. You would only ever set that environment variable if you need pkg-config to look in directories other than those which it searches by default. So if you compiled a program and installed it in /home/user/apps/blah and the file /home/user/apps/blah/lib/pkg-config/libblah.pc needed to be available to pkg-config, you would set:\nexport PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/home/user/apps/blah/lib/pkg-config/libblah.pc\nto make pkg-config find that installation of libblah.pc.\nHowever, since you are installing libconfig from Ubuntu itself, it will automatically \"plunk\" the .pc file in the correct search directory.\n", "Q: Monitor flickering while using Nvidia card I have an Nvidia GeForce GT 500 series card, and cannot install the video driver needed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Additional drivers doesn't find any\n\n*Downloading and installing the driver from the Nvidia website doesn't work\n\n*CTRL+ALT+F1 gives an error (\"no native mode, forcing panel scaling)\n\n*my monitor stays flickering\n\n\nA: Something similar has happened to me with the GTX 560TI but instead of flickering only it also included some puzzle effect where pieces of the monitor where not in order, so for example the top part was in the middle, the bottom part on top and so on. It took me a little while to get used to it while I worked on a solution. \nThis is what I did to solve it:\nI booted the PC as I normally would (No proprietary drivers installed yet) but it \"froze\" or at least that's what the video said to me before entering to the Desktop. Not even lightdm appeared. So I booted again but this time left SHIFT pressed so the GRUB Menu would show. I then proceeded to select Recovery Mode which continued booting correctly until the Recovery Menu appeared.\nIn the recovery menu I selected failsafeX.\nNow here is where it starts to get tricky. With the GT 220 and GT 440 I did not have any problems booting into the Desktop after selecting failsafeX but with the 560 the failsafeX gave me an error \"The system is running in low-graphics mode\" and stayed there forever. What I did in this case is that from there I went to the terminal (CTRL+ALT+F1) and typed (I had previously install aptitude but it works the same way with apt-get):\nsudo aptitude install nvidia-current - If you haven't install it yet\nsudo aptitude reinstall nvidia-current - If you have already installed it  \nFor other cases see this answer for details and follow the links there to help you along the way.\nIt downloaded and installed the drivers correctly. Same thing if you use apt-get:\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current\nRemember that in the case you get an error AFTER selecting failsafeX from the recovery mode, pressed CTRL+ALT+F1, typed your user/pass and do the nvidia-current package installation from there.\nAfter rebooting all problems should be solved. I have already tested the Additional Drivers and after finishing downloading the package it gave an error. I also went to software center and synaptic to try to install them, with the same result. The only way was either using failsafeX or the workaround about changing to the tty1 terminal and doing it via command line.\nI also need to add that I do not recommend downloading the Drivers from the Nvidia site since they:\n\n\n*\n\n*Might create additional problems with Ubuntu\n\n*Are not updated automatically\n\n*Are not tested thoroughly in Ubuntu\n\n\nAlways use the nvidia-current package or the nvidia-current-updates one. This are tested and approved already for the Ubuntu version you are using and will give less errors and incompatibility bugs.\n\nA: It could've been something as simple as refresh rate. See what your monitor supports and see if your software is using the correct rate.\n\nA: It is fixed using the Nvidia X server software.\n", "Q: How to composite videos and make animations in Ubuntu?

I have a .accdb file created with Microsoft Office 2010 and I want to know if it is possible to open it with some native Ubuntu application like LibreOffice or OpenOffice, I know LibreOffice has LibreOffice Base but I can't figure out how to open or if it's even possible to open a .accdb file.\nIs there any way I can open a .accdb file without Wine or VirtualBox?\n\nA: Yes, we can use the UCanAccess JDBC driver to connect to Access databases (.mdb and .accdb) in LibreOffice Base. Here's how I did it on a clean install of Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.\nImportant Note:  These instructions apply to UCanAccess version 3.0.5 and later (including version 4.x). Before proceeding, verify that you are using the latest version of UCanAccess, available here.\nOne-Time Setup\nFirst, I installed LibreOffice Base\nsudo apt-get install libreoffice-base\n\nThen I downloaded UCanAccess (bin.zip file) and unzipped it into the folder\n~/Downloads/JDBC/UCanAccess\n\n\nNote: When unzipping the distribution file be sure to specify \"Keep directory structure\" (or similar, depending on your unzip tool) so the folder structure appears as in the screenshot above.\nI launched LibreOffice (not Base, just LibreOffice itself)\n\nand chose Tools > Options\n\nOn the Advanced tab I clicked the \"Class Path...\" button\n\nand then added the following JAR file using the \"Add Archive...\" button:\n/home/gord/Downloads/JDBC/UCanAccess/loader/ucanload.jar\n\n\nNote that this is ucanload.jar in the loader/ subfolder, not \"ucanaccess-x.y.z.jar” in the UCanAccess home folder.\nImportant: You must close and re-open all LibreOffice (or OpenOffice.org) components for the new \"Class Path...” value to take effect. That includes any \"quick start” features or other related processes. (If you want to play it safe, simply restart your machine.)\nPer-Database Setup\nI launched LibreOffice Base, and in Step 1 of the wizard I chose \"Connect to an existing database (JDBC)\"\n\nThe Access file I wanted to manipulate was named \"uca301demo.accdb\" in my Documents folder, so in Step 2 the \"Datasource URL\" was …\njdbc:ucanaccess:///home/gord/Documents/uca301demo.accdb\n\n(note that Base supplies the jdbc: prefix for us, so all we need to enter is the remainder of the URL starting with ucanaccess: …)\n… and the \"JDBC driver class\" was\nnet.ucanaccess.jdbc.UcanloadDriver\n\n\nIn Step 3, I left the \"User name\" field empty and just clicked \"Next >>\".\nIn Step 4, I saved the LibreOffice Base database as \"accdbTest.odb\" in my Documents folder.\nWhen the wizard completed it opened my LibreOffice database and I could see the tables and saved queries in the .accdb file\n\nTroubleshooting\nIf you are using a distribution that installs LibreOffice Base by default (e.g., Linux Mint) then you may receive the error\n\nThe connection to the data source \"MyDatabase\" could not be established.\n'org.hsqldb.persist.HsqlProperties\norg.hsqldb.DatabaseURL.parseURL(java.lang.String, boolean, boolean)'\n\nThat is because LibreOffice has installed its own (rather old) copy of HSQLDB that conflicts with UCanAccess. To fix that, remove LibreOffice's copy of HSQLDB. For example, on Linux Mint that would be\nsudo apt remove libhsqldb1.8.0-java\n\nAlso, if LibreOffice Base won't work for whatever reason you can use DBeaver instead. Installing the (free) Community Edition is as easy as\nsudo snap install dbeaver-ce\n\n\nA: As mentioned here it says it supports Access files but if we look deeper they have only tested in LibreOffice up to Office 2007.\nSince you have an Office 2010 I would suggest trying out this link since other users by the look of this have already tried.\nAdditionally the compatibility shown here says how good LibreOffice Base is when relating to Microsoft Access 2010. At least up to version 3.6.\nThere is also a question on the Ask Libreoffice site about this that mentions this link where it is said that the 2007 format is different from the 2010 so it will not work correctly in LibreOffice 3.6 or below.\nMy only recommendation that does not include Wine or VirtualBox would be to use MS Office 2010 to save the Access file as a 2007 version (If possible) or a MDB format. At least while LibreOffice works on improving compatibility with 2010 in general.\n", "Q: How to Remove Cairo Dock from Start Up?

And also, should I prefer Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Lubuntu or Mythbuntu?\nNote: I want it to be as fast as possible.\nNote [2]: I will install ubuntu with wubi.\n\nA: I can not talk about MythBuntu, because I have no experience with it, but, as far as the other three go, they are essentially the same core operating system with a different graphical user interface.\nUbuntu is using Unity as it's core graphical user interface experience, Lubuntu is using LXDE and Kubuntu is using KDE (The K Desktop environment).\nThose three are very stable, and, performance-wise, the Lubuntu variant must be the most lightweight. \n[EDIT1]: If I were to pick the fastest of the three, I would pick Lubuntu.\n[EDIT2]: MythBuntu seems to be a home entertainment variant of Ubuntu. \nAlso keep in mind, that a strong pick, when it comes to performance too, is Xubuntu which is using XFCE as its graphical user interface. Speaking from experience, I find Xfce to be lighter than LXDE and more user friendly. \n\nA: By experience, the latest will always be more stable. This does not count when we are talking about a very old system, but assuming the user is up to date with the hardware, the more recent the version is, the more updated it is, the more stable it is.\nFor each new version, there are many fixes, updates and compatibility issues attended. So it is normal to assume the latest is always better (Again, assuming the user updates his/her hardware).\nSome improvements might be faster startups or cpu/memory usage, more hardware compatibility and file system enhancements, all of which add to the stable part.\nWhich is more recommended, depends on your needs and you hardware:\nUbuntu - Most tested and used. I personally recommend this one.\nKubuntu - More options, the interface looks similar in somes aspects to Windows (The type of menu and how/where options are.\nLubuntu/Xubuntu - For users with low hardware. Great speed and low cpu/memory usage.\nMythbuntu - If you like movies, tv series, music this is the one for you.\nThere are many others but again, this depend on how the user will use the system and the hardware they have.\nNote about Wubi install\nIf you are going to install it by Wubi then you will not achieve the fastest performance. There is an excellent question/answer HERE and HERE about why NOT to use Wubi if you want to avoid several odd problems and performance issues. If you still do then your Note1 will have issues with your Note2 and we don't want 2 notes angry at each other do we? ^^.\n\nA: If you want a stable and reliable os, you should use a LTS-version. The latest / current LTS-version is Ubuntu Precise Pangolin 12.04.\nIf your system should be fast, you could choose a lightweight desktop like LXDE, XFCE or another window-manager like fluxbox. \n", "Q: Java 1.7 update 07 and Google Chrome I've just updated Java from 1.6 to 1.7 via the Software Centre - removing the old Java 1.6 and selecting the new Java 1.7.\nFirefox works fine.\nBut when I use Google Chrome to access a Java test website it says the Plugin is out of date.

I'm attempting to install Ubuntu 12.04 on a fresh 1TB drive by booting from a LiveUSB. \nI've not been able to get past the initial menu screen, however, as the process stalls out shortly after selecting an option (both boot from drive and install to drive). I've tried multiple USB drives as well as CDs, modified the boot order, flashed BIOS, and even tried booting with only the flash drive and the keyboard connected with the same results. \nTypically what I observe is that the OS begins what I think is compiling, listing drivers and components before freezing on one. When the keyboard is plugged in, its the keyboard driver, before I flashed BIOS, it was a BIOS related item, now its an unknown entry. \nThe computer seems to be reading the drive (indicated by USB light flashing or CD drive reading) for roughly 10 minutes with no progress, followed by the drives going quiet. \nSome spec info:\nMotherboard: ASUS P5Q Pro,\nBIOS version 2102 (latest version),\nIntel chipset\nCPU: Intel Core 2 Duo E8400 Wolfdale 3.0GHz \nhelp would be appriciated!\n\nA: Most of the times (using the LiveUSB in this example) the following helps:\nAs you mentioned you managed to see the boot menu. After selecting your language press F6 and several options will appear:\n\nActivate the ACPI=OFF option ONLY and test it with only that option.\nIf it still fails then activate the NOAPIC option ONLY and test it with that one.\nIf it still fails activate both options and test it out. Lastly if it still fails and you have pray to the gods, crossed your fingers and called for Linus Torvalds then use the 2 options again but add NOLAPIC.\nNormally when I have your same problem, with the ACPI=OFF option is enough. Let me know how it went.\n", "Q: Is it safe to install the / partition on an SSD? I've just purchased a laptop Dell Inspiron 14z, with a HDD with 500G and a SSD with 32GB. \nI installed 12.04 on it, setting the partitioning table like this: /home and swap partitions in the HDD, / partition in the SSD. Two days after installing, I changed some configuration file in the / partition, and after rebooting, the BIOS wouldn't recognize the SSD anymore. \nThe LiveCD was seeing it, but only with a size of 1GB. Eventually I had to call the technical support and I had the SSD replaced. The thing is, the technician told me that, even though I was playing with the partitions, probably the SSD was faulty. However, now I doubt. Maybe Ubuntu was accessing too often to the SSD or something, so that it got overloaded and crashed. \nMy question is: is it safe to install the / partition in the SSD? Do I have to have especial care when installing? (I've read about setting a partition for /boot, and even to leave the first 500MB of the SSD untouched, due to the MBR configuration, but I am not really sure if that would help). Any tip will be more than welcome.\n\nA: Your SSD was likely defective if it failed almost right away after you bought it. Generally speaking you don't need to do much to use an SSD, putting / on it and /home on your hard drive is a common configuration.

I do not want to do it with .bash_profile because I want it to be configured locally in once place not on every server I ssh in to.\nHow do I do that?\n\nA: OK, the answer that I have and which works almost exactly as requested is actually surprisingly complex. You will use xmacro to record and play back key strokes.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install xmacro\nsudo apt-get install xmacro\n\n\n*Record a macro\nxmacrorec2 > test.macro\n\nNow press ESC (to record the \"abort\" key for recording), type whatever text you want to assign and press ESC  again to stop the recording. The recorded macro is now in the file test.macro; you can edit it with a text editor.\n\n*Test that macro works\ncat test.macro | xmacroplay -d 0 $DISPLAY\n\n\n*(optional, recommended) Create a script with the above commands. Save it as macro.sh:\n#!/bin/bash\n\ncat test.macro | xmacroplay -d 0 $DISPLAY > /dev/null 2>/dev/null\n\nMake it executable:\nchmod a+x macro.sh\n\n\n*A little problem remains. xmacro plays back the exact keystrokes, but if you define a shortcut, and run the script from the shortcut, the keys will be played before you release the shortcut key, as if you started typing without releasing the key. You need to prepend the following line to the test.macro file:\nKeyStrRelease F1\n\nwhich will simulate the release of the F1 key.\n\n*Using keyboard preferences (you can access them through settings or by typing `gnome-control-center keyboard), create a new shortcut under \"Custom shortcuts\" and assign to it F1.\nOK, but there is one more caveat: the F1 shortcut will now work in every application, not only the terminal. I don't know how to solve it; possibly, in the macro.sh one would have to test what window has the focus first and check whether the identifier of this window is terminal.\n", "Q: What CCTV Software is available?

Wubi is trying to download the Ubuntu image file and failing. \nSee this old discussion on HTTP Proxy for wubi. Also see Wubi \"could not retrieve the required disk image\".\nOne solution is to download the image manually and then tell wubi where to look for it.\nEven though you plan to put Ubuntu in its own partition, Wubi will use a virtual partiton , a big file called root.disk to install the operating system and all the user data. Because of this, compared with a regular installation, a Wubi installation faces some limitations. \n\n\n*\n\n*In the Wubi installation the filesystem is more vulnerable to hard\nreboots. Also, if the Windows drive is unmounted uncleanly (most\ncommonly because of a Windows crash), Ubuntu will not be able to\nmount the Windows drive and boot until Windows has successfully\nbooted and shut down. If the Windows system cannot be booted after\nthe crash, the user also cannot boot Ubuntu.\n\n*Performance related to hard-disk access is also slightly slower,\nmore so if the disk image file is fragmented, on a Wubi install\ncompared to a normal one.\nSee more at: What's the difference between Wubi and a regular \"alongside Windows\" installation?\nAlternate Suggestion:\nSince you have already created a partition for Ubuntu, it will be ideal to do a proper (not wubi) installation of Ubuntu in its own partition.

In default Ubuntu installation, all enabled repository has priority 500 except the backport repository, which has priority 100. So, if a software has higher versioned package in backport repository, that software will not be upgraded with sudo apt-get install x command. You need to explicitly tell apt to use that repository by using command like this: sudo apt-get install x/precise-backports. * \nBut, if two repo provide the same software with the same version, then Apt will install software from the repository which comes first in the sources.list file. \nI'm quoting from apt_preference manual page:\n\n   Several instances of the same version of a package may be available\n   when the sources.list(5) file contains references to more than one\n   source. In this case apt-get downloads the instance listed earliest in\n   the sources.list(5) file. The APT preferences file does not affect the\n   choice of instance, only the choice of version.\n\n\n\nA: It depends on which version is available where. To see which version will be installed, with the repositories in question added, you can run apt-cache policy x, to follow your example, and it will show you the installed version, and the candidate (which is the version which would be installed, if you install or upgrade).\n", "Q: Is there a wifi driver for AR5523 chipset, on linux kernel 3.2+?

Just add defaultos=macosx to your yaboot.conf located in /etc/yaboot.conf. You can do that by starting the terminal and authenticating as root by typing \"sudo su\" and then typing \"gedit /etc/yaboot.conf\" which will open a text editor where you can add that line after the lines you have, but before the \"image\" line break.

KDE Telepathy keeps getting in the way every time I try to use Empathy from the messaging menu. If I get a message, it opens in the KDE telepathy UI instead of in Empathy. This is rather frustrating as it causes a delay before it opens, and is not integrated with Empathy.\nHow can I stop this from happening? This still happens in 12.10 and I've had to remove the kde-telepathy packages. Is there a solution?\n\nA: I figured out how to do this (Ubuntu 12.10):\nEdit /usr/share/dbus-1/services/org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Client.KTp.TextUi.service to comment out (or remove) the link to ktp-text-ui and use Empathy instead.\nIn the end, the service file will look like this:\n[D-BUS Service]\nName=org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Client.KTp.TextUi\n# Exec=/usr/lib/kde4/libexec/ktp-text-ui\nExec=/usr/lib/empathy/empathy-chat\n\nAfter this, I figured I had to restart dbus, but doing a\nsudo service dbus restart\n\nis evidently a bad idea, since it locks up everything.\nSo I suppose you have to log out and log back in (or reboot, which is what I ended up having to do).\n\nA: There's a bug report on this issue here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ktp-text-ui/+bug/951104\nThere's a proposed solution on the last line, but I have to confess that I'm not entirely sure how to go about defining a preferred handler on dbus.\n(Since it's easy enough to remove the kde-telepathy packages without affecting the rest of KDE and I don't need two messaging clients, I just went with that option instead.)\n", "Q: Installing Matlab 2012a (32-bit) in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS java problem This is my first posting here, so please be gentle.

However, I would like to test only a specific package (unity) and its dependencies. \nHow would I go about doing this?\n\nA: Yes, this can be controlled by 'pinning' the release channel priorities. See this how to on how to configure APT to do this by setting pin-priorities on release channels.\nThe specific number set there is the key. High enough to receive updates when installed from the channel, yet low enough to get installed by default when not selecting the specific channel.\nThen use your package management to select the release channel like this:\n$ sudo apt-get install mypackage/precise-proposed\n\nThe how-to I just mentioned is using aptitude, but I recommend apt-get in recent Ubuntu versions as it has trouble handling multiarch dependencies, in my experience.\n", "Q: How to rename files with count?

Some help?\n\nA: rename is a command-line tool that lets you rename files, using a Perl command to transform the name. A Perl command that's commonly used in this circumstance is s/REGEXP/REPLACEMENT/.\nIf I interpret your question correctly, you want to add a leading 0 in the names that have fewer than 4 digits, so that all the names end up having 4 digits. This slightly complicated expression handles the general case where you have file names with 1, 2 or 3 digits: it aligns all of them to 4 digits. The e modifier at the end causes the replacement to be interpreted not as a string but as a Perl expression. This expression repeats the digit 0 as many times as necessary to pad the number to 4 digits.\nrename 's/(?=([0-9]+)\\.)/\"0\" x (4 - length($1))/e' *.png\n\nIf the files you want to rename all have three digits, there are simpler ways, such as\nrename 's/[0-9]+\\./0$&/' *[!0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9].png\n\nor\nrename 's/(?<=[^0-9])[0-9]{3}\\./0$&/' *.png\n\n\nA: As an alternative to the various Perl-based methods in other answers, you can do this particular example, and lots of other similar ones with plain bash:\nfor i in randomized_quad???.png; do   \n  mv $i randomized_quad0${i#randomized_quad}\ndone\n\nThis loops over the filenames with only three characters in the number region, and the variable expression in braces takes each filename, snips \"randomized_quad\" off the front (with the # operator), and adds \"randomized_quad0\" on the front.\nOther excitingly useful operators like this include:\n\n\n*\n\n*% - cut something off the end\n\n*/ - search and replace (/ for the first match, // for all matches)\n\n*: - for extracting substrings\n\n\nA more complete list with examples is here. Also, note that these use POSIX-style regular expressions, so . will match any character, not just a \".\" If you want to match a \".\", you should 'escape' it, with a backslash:\nTestVariable1=\"filename.png\"\nTestVariable2=\"filename0png\"\n\necho \"${TestVariable1%.png}\"\n> filename\n\necho \"${TestVariable2%.png}\"\n> filename\n\necho \"${TestVariable1%\\.png}\"\n> filename\n\necho \"${TestVariable2%\\.png}\"\n> filename0png\n\n\nA: rename 's/quad([0-9]{3})\\.png/quad0$1/' randomized_quad*\n\n\nA: With a recent version of bash you could write:\nfor f in randomized_quad*.png; do\n    if [[ $f =~ [1-9][0-9]* ]]; then\n        new=$(printf \"randomized_quad%04d.png\" ${BASH_REMATCH[0]})\n        [[ $f != $new ]] && mv -v $f $new\n    fi\ndone\n\n", "Q: Grooveshark apps on Ubuntu What applications are available for Grooveshark in Ubuntu, I'm in need of one that supports media keys.\nBeing generally \"pretty\" would be a plus too.\nWhat I really want is a plugin for Rhythmbox but that does not seem to be available.

Here's why:\nSetting 4 (octal representation) as a permission on either a user, group or other marks it as r-- (3-bit representation, but the same thing) and not r-x as required for directories to be able to list their contents.\nSo, you probably wanted to set mode 755 on that directory to make it like this:\ndrwxr-xr-x\n\nIf your file manager reports it has not contents, you're probably not the owner of that directory (presuming your file manager is running as your own user account). So, try to fix this as root (for example using sudo to raise your privileges), like this:\nsudo chmod 755 /var/www/wordpress\n\nAnd you'll be able to access your file again, probably.\n", "Q: OpenOffice Calc doesn't show up in the alt-tab window switcher I just upgraded to ubuntu 12.04, and it's mostly working.

If I minimize other windows, then I can get to my Calc documents, but Alt-Tab just doesn't work.\nIt only seems to be a problem with Calc.  Writer and Impress both work fine.\nI do a lot of work in spreadsheets, so this is really messing up my flow.

My current kernel is 3.2.0-26 (my main computer) while on another of my Ubuntu computers, with which I didn't fiddle with unofficial updates, it's 3.2.0-30. Yet the Update manager on my main computer doesn't show available kernel updates. It shows other updates though.\nI suspect is due to the fact that in the past I installed multiple mainline kernel versions (not recommended versions), up to 3.5* series.\nWhat I'm after:\nEither: Fix automatic kernel updates.\nOr: Learn about a way to check for the latest official ubuntu kernel version and get it manually (I know how to install kernels from debs)\nWhat I have already tried:\nUninstalled unused kernels including \"the generic one without a number\" as per https://askubuntu.com/a/103875/29347 and then also https://ubuntugenius.wordpress.com/2011/01/08/ubuntu-cleanup-how-to-remove-all-unused-linux-kernel-headers-images-and-modules/\n\nA: In case you only want to update the default kernel you should be able to fix it with:\nsudo apt-get install linux-image-generic\n\nSince linux-image-generic always depends on the newest default kernel of your distribution, the kernel gets upgraded with the rest of the packages when you run apt-get upgrade.\nWhen you want to update a non default kernel you can do this by running this script:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nsudo apt-get update\nkernel_release=\"$(uname -r | cut --complement -d'.' -f3)\"\nkernel_release_versions=\"$(apt-cache search linux-image-${kernel_release})\"\nkernel_release_versions_generic=\"$(grep linux-image-\"${kernel_release_version}\".*-generic <<< \"$kernel_release_versions\")\"\nnewest_kernel_of_release=\"$(echo \"$kernel_release_versions_generic\" | tail -n1 | cut -d' ' -f1 )\"\n\nsudo apt-get install $newest_kernel_of_release\n\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nIf you also need the header files, additionally run the following:\nnewest_kernel_of_release_headers=${newest_kernel_of_release/image/headers}\n\nsudo apt-get install $newest_kernel_of_release_headers\n\n\nA: Your problem with automatic updates may be because of the mainline kernels or because you removed the \"generic\" package. \nYou can update to the latest kernel via apt-get as follows:\n\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install linux-image-`uname -r`\n\nIf you also need the headers (to compile kernel modules such as wireless drivers):\n\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-`uname -r`\n\n\nA: \"You should be able to use any of the listed mirrors by adding a line to your /etc/apt/sources.list like this:\ndeb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu raring-security main \n\"\nvia \nhttp://packages.ubuntu.com/raring/all/linux-headers-3.8.0-31/download\n", "Q: Is there any Ubuntu translation indicator?

When I start Firestarter, the firewall program asks for my password. How do I turn off my Firestarter password?  I want Firestarter to start on computer startup but it won't because it's password protected.\n\nA: Firestarter is a program for editing your firewall rules - the firewall is part of the linux kernel and will automatically start whether or not you run Firestarter.  \nSo, you don't need to do anything with passwords to have a firewall - it's already there.  In fact, you should keep your password enabled, since that way no one but you will be able to edit the firewall rules.  \n", "Q: Can't boot into Windows after installing Ubuntu with WUBI I installed Ubuntu with the Windows installer and when I turn on my computer, Ubuntu just starts and I can't get to Windows again.

I have a .ovpn file with my VPN config - it works fine when I do \nsudo openvpn --config ~jrg/Documents/vpn-config.ovpn \n\nin the terminal, but I'd like to use Network Manager. How can I do this?\n\nA: In Unity 14.04, all I had to do was go to edit connections, Click \"add\" by using the drop down list to select import a saved VPN configuration, and then select my \"filename.ovpn\" file, and voila. Done. \n\nA: I answered this with a way to use Network Manager as the OP asked, but there is a MUCH BETTER WAY!  All you have to do is download and install a program called gopenvpn which is available via Ubuntu Software Center.  Save your .ovpn files to /etc/openvpn as admin.  Open gopenvpn which should be listed under Applications > Internet and click on the .ovpn file to connect to by right-clicking on the gopenvpn icon you will see on your task bar.  Easy as pie which is the way anything on a computer should be :)\nAlso you can bypass usernames and password by making .txt files in /etc/openvpn using this format:\nusername\npassword\n\nThen in each of your .ovpn files (for example VPNBook .ovpn files), change the line that says this:\nauth-user-pass\n\nTo:\nauth-user-pass VPNBook.txt\n\nUse SED to make the replacement per line in all your .ovpn -files, etc\nroot@masi:/etc/openvpn# sed -i '/auth-user-pass/c\\auth-user-pass nordvpn.txt' *.ovpn\n\nLastly ensure security and do such that others do not see your username and password\nroot@masi:/etc/openvpn# chmod 700 nordvpn.txt\n\n\nA: Since this issue bit me quite a few times, I decided to also create a tool to automate the \"downgrading\" of the .ovpn file with embedded certs to a .ovpn file pointing to other .pem files.\nIt is available here : https://github.com/dolanor/ovpnsplit/\nIt is in go, so you need go installed or you can just use the binaries from here : https://github.com/dolanor/ovpnsplit/releases\nPut your .ovpn file where you want it (I put it in ~/.config/openvpn/ that I created), then launch the tool\n\novpnsplit ~/.config/openvpn/file.ovpn\n\nIt will create all the files that were embedded in file.ovpn into individual .pem files\nIn NetworkManager, select import vpn config and then choose your ~/.config/openvpn/file.ovpn. Normally, all the certificate files should point to the good one.\nBut another bug made that NetworkManager doesn't detect the key direction from the Advanced settings of TLS Auth. So you need to put it to the right direction also…\nAnd after that, you save and you should be good to go.\nThis tool will help with the use of the kylemanna/openvpn docker image which create all the certificates and the TLS Auth.\n\nA: My own experience of successful VPN connection establishing on Ubuntu 14.04.\nOur admin gave me 3 files to install them into openVPN for Windows 7: *.ovpn, *.crt, *.key\n\n\n*\n\n*Execute the following commands in your Ubuntu terminal:\nsudo apt-get install openvpn network-manager-openvpn network-manager-openvpn-gnome network-manager-vpnc\nsudo /etc/init.d/networking restart\n\n\n*Open \"Network Connections\" window (VPN Connections -> Configure VPN)\n\n*Press \"ADD\" button, click on drop-down menu and pick \"Import a saved VPN configuration\", press Create button.\n\n*In \"Select File to import\" choose your \"*.ovpn\" file.\n\n*In \"Editing ...your *.ovpn file name...\" window enter your username and password for vpn. Make sure that a *.crt file appeared in CA Certificate field.\n\n*Open \"IPv4 Settings\" panel and choose \"Automatic (VPN) addresses only\".\n\n*Open \"VPN\" panel again and click \"Advanced\" button.\n\n*Open \"TLS Authentication\" panel and make sure your \"*.key\" appeared in \"Key File\" field. Press Ok button.\n\n*Press \"Save\" button in \"Editing ...your *.ovpn file name...\" window.\n\n*Your VPN connection should appear in \"Network Connections\" window.\nThat's all, I hope it helps. Good luck!\n\nA: Since ubuntu 18.04, if you already have the opvn file you can import it. (sudo is not required)\nnmcli connection import type openvpn file [client].ovpn\n\nOnce done, go to search and find 'network', the new vpn connection will be there.\n\nA: I created a script here to automate fetching password & zip files from several vpn sites such as vpnbook.com, extracting the ca, cert, and key data from the ovpn files, and updating the opvn files so the certs should just import for you.  It could easily be modified for use with other providers.\n\nA: First, install the OpenVPN Network Manager plugin:\nsudo apt-get install network-manager-openvpn-gnome\n\nOpen Network Manager, click \"Add\" and from the opened window select \"Import a saved VPN configuration...\" under \"Choose a Connection Type\". Navigate to your .ovpn file (~jrg/Documents/vpn-config.ovpn). If it doesn't automatically find your certificates/keys (the paths of which are found in the .ovpn file), you can select them here, or make any other small changes.\n\nOne other thing that may save you some headache down the road is to click IPv4 Settings, then change the method to \"Automatic (VPN) Addresses Only\". When kept at the default, this will cause ALL internet traffic to go over the VPN, regardless of your .ovpn settings. Here you can also set the DNS server and search domains to use while connected.\n\n\nA: It's late to answer, but I found a solution (and it is a PAIN)...\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a folder in your home directory called .OpenVPN (with the dot in front of it so it is hidden) then open that folder and create one called FrootVPN (no dot needed).  This makes management of different VPN providers easier.\n\n*Copy/Paste froot.ovpn to the /home/YOU/.OpenVPN/FrootVPN folder.\n\n*Open the froot.ovpn file with a text editor.\n\n*Copy everything between the ca /ca tags.\n\n*Paste the contents to a new file and save it as ca.crt within the /home/YOU/.OpenVPN/FrootVPN folder.\n\n*Click on the Network Manager icon and go to VPN CONNECTIONS > CONFIGURE VPN...\n\n*Click on ADD and select OpenVPN.  Click CREATE.\n\n*Call it FrootVPN 1194 and use se-openvpn.frootvpn.com for the Gateway.  Type will be PASSWORD.  Enter your FrootVPN username and password.  On CA Certificate, click the folder icon and browse to the ca.crt file you created.\n\n*Click the Advanced button and change \"Use custom gateway port:\" to 1194.  Click OK.\n\n*Change the Method on both the IPv4 and IPv6 tabs to Automatic (VPN) addresses only.\n\n*Click SAVE.\n\n\nNow for the PAIN part: you will have to create 15 more FrootVPN connections since they use ports 1194-1209.  Repeat Steps 7-11 above for port 1195 then again for 1196 and so on until you finish with port 1209 making sure the name in Step 8 matches the port in Step 9.  I know... it sucks!\nNow you can connect to FrootVPN by clicking on the Network Manager icon and going to VPN Connections.  Work through the list of FrootVPN connections until you find one you can connect to.\nFrankly, I wish Network Manager supported .ovpn files directly.  We should be able to IMPORT the .ovpn file, Network Manager gets all the correct settings from the .ovpn file, does the correct range of gateway ports and other settings specified by the VPN provider, and saves it all as ONE connection.  The .crt files should not be needed if everything is in the .ovpn file.\n\nA: When you aren't given an user certificate, you must select the 'Password' type in the authentication drop down. Then in advanced, in 'TLS Authentication' add the TLS .key file and set the direction accordingly (1 or 0, that should be set in the .ovpn file).\n", "Q: How to mount an ISO (or NRG) image and rip it as if it were a physical CD?

Is there a way to make ripit ignore the first track?\n\nA: Try this:\nsudo mount -o loop ~/iso.iso /media/cdrom0\n\nThen try ripit --device /media/cdrom0\n\nA: You are mounting it correctly. You actually shouldn't need to \"rip\" the cd, and it will probably fail anyway, since it is a data CD. There should be .wav or .mp3 files on the cd. Just look for them after mounting. If they are .wav's you can use the following to easily convert them to mp3s.\nlame -V2 input.wav output.mp3\n\nMore info can be found with:\nlame --help\n\nIf it is a hybrid cd, as izx mentioned, then you can simply skip the first track with ripit, like this:\nripit --device /media/cdrom 2-\n\nThis will rip track 2+.\n", "Q: How to share my wireless connection to other wireless devices I am aware that I can share my wired internet connection to other devices wirelessly, but what I need now is a little more complex.

I then inserted an old Hard drive and made an 8gb swap partition to compensate. Swap memory is \"not avaliable\" which means I need to activate it. How do I do so?\n\nA: Best way to accomplish this permanently is adding a correct line in your /etc/fstab file pointing to the swap partition you created. Then run swapon -a.\nSuch a line in fstab should look similar to this:\nUUID=4139a640-c32e-4e88-b275-75c77722da7c none            swap    sw              0       0\n\nFind the UUID of your swap partition by running blkid and replace it accordingly.\nIt is also possible to activate it temporarily using swapon by pointing it to the partition directly (see manpage). After reboot it will not be activated again automatically.\n\nA: 1) Setup swap partition on your drive (You can as well setup Swap file on your current drive)... So: start Gparted and set a partition and make it as swap\n2) You can activate it manually by command:\nswapon PARTITION_NAME\n\nwhere PARTITION_NAME is something like /dev/sdb1 (according to your drives, check it out correctly)\nNow you should find mention of this swap in /proc/swaps\n3) You can activate it permanently by editing /etc/fstab\nAd line like this:\nPARTITION_NAME  swap  swap defaults 0 0\n\nwhere again  PARTITION_NAME is something like /dev/sdb1 (according to your drives, check it out correctly)\n", "Q: Slide pane in impress not on the left side I accidentally moved my slide pane in Impress from the left side and I don't know how to put it back. \n\nA: Just click and drag the pane from the title \"slides\" to its original position.\nI hope this will be useful for you, let me know it.\n\nA: For some reason when you just drag it back to the original position it doesn't do it but if you do the following it works.\n\n\n*\n\n*Drag it to the bottom right corner (over the task pane).\n\n*Release (dock) it there.\n\n*Drag it again to its original position\n\n\nAt least that's what happens on my computer.\nHope it helps.\n", "Q: I've got a blue exclamation in the title bar and it won't go away 12.04\nEvery time I boot my machine, theres a blue exclamation point on the top right, to the left of the standard indicators.

I've asked a question about what audio volume to use when recording:\n\n\n*\n\n*recording audio: What is the best volume setting?\nIn there, I learned that:\n\n\n*\n\n*I should avoid too high a volume, to prevent clipping\n\n*I should avoid too low a volume, to prevent loss of resolution\n\n\nThe question now is: What is too high a volume? What is too low? I am setting the volume via the GUI for sound config. It has an unamplified setting, a 100% setting, and volumes beyond 100%.\nAfter 100%, is there still resolution loss? How can I tell if there is clipping going on (given that my recording program is the non-GUI ffmpeg)?\n\nA: You can test audio record in Audacity to see if it clips. You generally should be able to hear the clipping if it is present. There is no standard volume that I know just set it at the highest possible level without the signal clipping, that's at least my standard for recording.\nTo use Audacity to test the audio level:\nTo use Audacity to test your Audio level you will open a new project. Then locate the two stereo meters then click the arrow next to the microphone and select start monitoring. If no level is shown and you are sure you have audio playing as if you were recording a video then move to the right in the UI and find the second microphone, and click the dropdown menu and select the device you are using, in common cases it simply is \"sysdefault.\"\nThen you should be able to see your level if you return to monitoring. Additionally you can simply record a few second clip and see if the sound file spikes to the top (Peak).\n\nA: The newer versions of FFmpeg have access to an audio filter called volumedetect which might be well worthwhile having a look at.\nThis will give you a number in decibels before clipping occurs (max_volume) and might be worth experimenting with, especially if you are used to using FFmpeg which I see you use for recording...\n\nA: Too high a volume while recording is what should be avoided at all cosst. Too low a volume is avoided by increasing the bit depth of the recording. So it becomes a question of the bit depth of your audio interface and your audio program.\nYou should use a program with internal 32-bit floating point audio like ardour. This will allow you to adjust levels in post more easily without losing anything.\nIn practice 24-bit audio on your interface is enough that you can record with plenty of headroom as they call it in the business. This means that you usually won't even worry about the low level being captured because with enough headroom it is there. However you may be concerned about the signal:noise ratio. In practice you should be aware of the dynamic range of the instrument or environment you are recording. Let's say a bass guitar has around 25db of dynamic range. You'd set your peak on the trim so that it peaks 5-10db below that.\nThe disadvantage of using higher bit depth is you have to dither your recording down to whatever level you want. For instance CDs have 16-bit audio. Typically if you decide to record at a lower bit depth you will need to use a mixing tool to compress the dynamic range on the fly. Sometimes people even set a hardwall limiter on each audio track just in case there are one or two sounds that go over 100% (a special form of compression). The disadvantage of a limiter or compression is they can distort the audio, so setting the trim correctly is a matter of experience. This is one of the reasons a band will do sound checks. \nWelcome to the wonderful world of audio engineering :)\n", "Q: Installing 2 copies of ubuntu 12.04 I am currently running a dual boot system with Ubuntu 12.04(64 bit) and Windows7.\nI am trying to install a toolkit which has conflict with some opencv libraries.

I messed up my bin/sh file, overwriting it with a database file in Virtualmin. After I  restarted, Ubuntu Server won't start properly anymore. The error I face is:\n\ninit:Failed to spawn plymouth main process:Unable to execute: No such file or directory.\n\nI have a live CD here but I don't really know how to use it to overwrite the corrupted bin/sh.\nCould someone help me resolve the situation.\n\nA: Thanks a lot sergey! :) Managed to work it out. Seems like I have already mounted it yesterday by blindly following a similar situation on a certain forum. Just wasn't sure on what to place after \"/dev\". Again, thanks a lot for your help. :D\nTo those who might encounter the same issue (and a complete newbie like me), here are the steps to take:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use a live cd/disk to boot in to the messed up OS/Computer. (Use unetbootin for live disk). Choose Try Ubuntu without Installing.\n\n*Open a terminal. Check the name of the partition(with the messed up sh) to be mounted by typing sudo fdisk -l. Note: l is a letter.\n\n*Mount the partition to any of the live cd's folder. For example sudo mount /dev/sda /media. Where sda is the name of the partition.\n\n*Then navigate to /media using cd.\n\ncd /bin\nsudo rm sh\nsudo ln -s bash sh\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall dash\n\n\nThese worked for me. :D\nAgain, thank Sergey.\n\nA: On my machine /bin/sh is a symlink to dash. All you need is to restore the symlink.\nWhile booted from the LiveCD, mount the root partition somewhere (say, /media/disk), then\ncd /media/disk/bin\nsudo rm ./sh\nsudo ln -s dash ./sh\n\nSomething like that.\nUpdate: Regarding \"mount the root partition somewhere\" - if you booted from a LiveCD and have a full GUI, the easiest would be to open the file browser, in the left pane there will be a few entries one of which correspond to the partition on the hard drive where your Ubuntu is installed (a.k.a \"root\" partition). Just clicking on the entry mounts the partition and displays its contents. You can tell it's a root partition if you see bin, boot, dev, etc, ..., var directories there.\nWhen you click on the entry in the file browser's left pane, what's happening behind the scenes is the filesystem is getting mounted as a subtree inside some directory, usually /media. You can check that using the file browser too.\nAfter you figured out where your partition is mounted at, you open terminal and re-create a symlink.\n", "Q: HDMI audio output problems with Radeon card No matter how much advice I follow, I still cannot get any audio to come out through my HDMI connection.

Did you try to run the program from regular terminal, outside of Eclipse?\nMy suspicion is that the Eclipse runs the program as if it was a non-interactive program, in a non-interactive setting, where the TERM variable is not needed. However, it might be that your program in fact uses a system call (something like system( \"clear\" )) that in fact requires the TERM variable in order to work.\nUnfortunately, I never use Eclipse, so I'm just guessing.\nEDIT: Yeah, that's the way it is: system( \"clear\" ) requires a terminal, but Eclipse does not provide terminal capabilities for your program.

The Windows 7 bootloader will be replaced by the new Windows 8 bootloader (without the option to boot into Ubuntu).

I want to write an Ubuntu application that helps me deal with a web-based API. I can write it in Python, but I want to know how to build it so that I can execute it as a command on the terminal itself. \n\nA: Put your Python program in a text file. The first line of that file should be\n #!/usr/bin/python\n\n print \"Hello world\"\n\n(I put the \"Hello world\" line just as an example of Python code). Save it as a text file, for example test.py. Make that file executable\n chmod a+x test.py\n\nPresto, you can now run it:\n ./test.py\n\nTo be able to access it from any directory and for every user, put it in /usr/local/bin, which is the default location for executables not installed with package managers:\nsudo cp test.py /usr/local/bin\n\nAlternatively, you can make a directory called \"bin\" in your home directory; it will be automatically appended to your PATH variable from through the $HOME/.profile file.\nmkdir $HOME/bin\nmv test.py $HOME/bin\n\nIn both of these two last cases to run your script in the terminal, you have to write only:\ntest.py\n\nThe extension \".py\" is here only for you to indicate that it is a Python script. You can call it \"susan\" and run it by typing\nsusan\n\nIt will work the same.\n\nA: Python is a scripting language, which means that you don't have to compile it before running. All you need is getting required version of Python interpreter installed.\nFor example, you have a python script named foo.py in your home directory, you can run that script with command\n$ ~/foo.py\n\nThe first line in the file should tell it's a python file.

(see comments for the reason for posting this).\n\nAssumption: You're using a 64-bit machine.\nGo to http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v3.4-precise/ and download the following files (or simply click on them):\n\n\n*\n\n*linux-headers-3.4.0-030400-generic_3.4.0-030400.201205210521_amd64.deb\n\n*linux-headers-3.4.0-030400_3.4.0-030400.201205210521_all.deb\n\n*linux-image-3.4.0-030400-generic_3.4.0-030400.201205210521_amd64.deb\nThen, just install them:\nsudo dpkg -i linux-headers-3.4.0-030400-generic_3.4.0-030400.201205210521_amd64.deb\nsudo dpkg -i linux-headers-3.4.0-030400_3.4.0-030400.201205210521_all.deb\nsudo dpkg -i linux-image-3.4.0-030400-generic_3.4.0-030400.201205210521_amd64.deb\n\nFor more information, go here: http://blog.hostonnet.com/how-to-install-linux-kernel-3-4-0-on-ubuntu-12-04-11-10.\n\nA: As you write, xhci_hcd is the kernel module (driver) for USB 3.0, and it appears to cause similar problems in other systems. Maybe you should file a bug report, because I do not see a question in what you have posted here.\n\nA: I just had this issue for the second day in a row without changing anything to my setup of USB devices where all of them have been working fine for months. I found that restarting USB helps in my case to get my devices back to being detected by the kernel. \nDetermine the addresses of your controllers:\nlspci | grep USB\n00:14.0 USB controller: Intel Corporation 8 Series/C220 Series Chipset Family USB xHCI (rev 05)\n00:1a.0 USB controller: Intel Corporation 8 Series/C220 Series Chipset Family USB EHCI #2 (rev 05)\n00:1d.0 USB controller: Intel Corporation 8 Series/C220 Series Chipset Family USB EHCI #1 (rev 05)\n\nIn this case they are 00:14.0, 00:1a.0 and 00:1d.0. Yours my be different.\nUnbind and rebind each controller through its address:\necho -n \"0000:00:14.0\" | sudo tee /sys/bus/pci/drivers/xhci_hcd/unbind\necho -n \"0000:00:14.0\" | sudo tee /sys/bus/pci/drivers/xhci_hcd/bind\n\nIn my case just doing it just for the xHCI controller was enough and all devices showed up again in lsusb. During my analysis I unplugged almost all USB devices and cycled power on the ones with an external power supply, which I recommend in such cases.\nObviously, since USB is not working and all your input devices are probably USB, you need some kind of remote access like SSH.\n", "Q: Why does Ubuntu gets stuck on the loading screen? I've been experiencing many problem lately since I fresh installed Ubuntu 12.04 LTS\non my SONY VAIO VPCEH with Windows 7 previously installed.  \nSometimes when I try to boot Ubuntu, it gets stuck at loading screen.\nThere seems to be some problem with driver (as far I can judge).  \nFollowing is the log generated, when I press Esc during the boot (before the\nproblem occurs):  \n...\n* Stopping System V initialization compatibility        [ok]\n* Starting System V runlevel compatibility              [ok]\n* Starting crash report submission daemon               [ok]\n* Starting automatic crash report generation            [ok]\n...\n...\n* Starting LightDM Display Manager                      [ok]\n\nNothing works after that, no Esc, etc, except restart.  \nAlso I've observed the following:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Inactivity of Hard-drive (Led doesn't glows).\n\n*Flashing, or blinking, of Caps-lock and Scroll-lock  \n\n\nOn restart, Ubuntu seem to load successfully. However, the loading\nscreen has somewhat basic graphics.  \nThis problem started after I installed Additional drivers:  \nNVIDIA accelerated graphics driver  \n\nAlso, most of the times Ubuntu loads without any problem. However, it\nis annoying to restart everytime it fails.  \nSo my question is:  \nWhy this happens and what is the solution?\n\nA: Apparently, the proprietary NVIDIA drivers are the cause of your problem. See the answer to this question.\nYou can remove these drivers (using the Additional Drivers panel), but then you are stuck with the open drivers (nouveau), which are limited.\nAlso, read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia\nFurthermore, there is a PPA supposedly distributing the newest version of the Nvidia drivers, but apparently some people run into problems with these drivers.\n\nA: Check out my answer here: 14.04 Freeze on Splash after Installing NVIDIA Drivers\nI had a similar problem after installing the nvidia drivers, but it happened to me every time I booted up, not just sporadically. These steps seem crazy, but they worked for me. All other solutions didn't work.\n\nA: I managed to fix the problem by simply removing all the proprietary drivers and left the default generic one.

I did install Ubuntu 11 on my systems but could not continue with Ubuntu OS as it was downloading updates of more than 120MB every day. This eats up my data plan. Now I need an up to 700MB OS that doesn't need any updates but should have networking, Office applications (PDF reader, Word, Excel, PPT) browser, chat client, audio & sound, web cam, and printer support. Can anybody help me on this? I be thankful to you.\n\nA: *\n\n*Start with a base server installation.\nReason:\nDuring installation it gives you the option to automatically download and apply ONLY security updates.  \n\n*Use this as your base template for installing each kiosk.\nReason:\nSee above.  \n\n*Next, configure a squid deb cache-ing proxy as described here.\nReason:\nThis would ensure that any updates for one PC get cached for all PCs.\n\nA: You can tell Ubuntu to either forget the updating completely, or just install the important security updates. Go to the Ubuntu software center, then to \"Edit\" -> \"Software sources\". \nTell Ubuntu to check only for important security updates (I definitely would do that!), and uncheck all the other boxes. Furthermore, select the \"Never\" option under \"Automatically check for updates\". You will then have to run the updates (if any) manually, for example at the end of the month if you see that you still have some transfer volume left.\n\nThat said, I assume that you have more than one computer in your café, and your main problem is not so much downloading the updates once, but the fact that each and every computer attempts to download all of the updates. \nEDIT: Here, as pointed out by akin1012, there is an easier way of making a local update cache using the squid proxy server. However, personally I prefer apt-mirror, because it is easier to ensure that all of the clients get the updates only from the mirror, and if the mirror breaks, then the clients will just stop downloading updates instead of suddenly trying to get them from the Internet.\nEDIT2: it is true that apt-mirror will download a large amount of data initially, so possibly that is not the best option. apt-cacher-ng has been suggested, but I have no experience with that.\nYou can do it with installing apt-mirror on one of the machines and pointing all of the other machines to this one. Naturally, you must carefully select what to mirror, otherwise it will try to mirror the whole Ubuntu repository, and not just the important updates (which is probably what you want).\nYou will find a detailed description of the process here, but beware: you only want to mirror these sources that you actually use!\nIn short, you need to do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install apt-mirror\n\n*Edit the configuration file (include only what you need)\n\n*Start the mirroring -- it will automatically download all relevant files\n\n*Install a local web server on the same machine and point it to the downloaded mirrors\n\n*Configure all remaining machines to use that mirror instead of the regular sources.\nThis is all rather complex, but may be worth it.\n\nA: Install Ubuntu and all the necessary updates and drivers in one Master system properly and disable updates completely after that. \nyou can use clonezilla (http://clonezilla.org/downloads.php) to clone the Hard Disk of the Master System(or just the required partition) and just replicate it in all the other systems.\n\nA: Since you are seeking stability over the latest feature tweaks, have you considered using only the LTS (Long Term Support) releases? They tend to be much more stable especially after the first year and thus get many fewer updates. And of course, set the Automatically Check for Updates to Never and Notify New Ubuntu Versions to For Long Term Support Versions, as shown in the earlier picture. I would have no problem installing a 10.04 LTS in a kiosk environment today, skipping updates and switching to 12.04 next year when it has matured a bit.\n", "Q: Any chance to upgrade 12.04 to 12.04 studio including the kernel As a newbie I am not sure how much this question holds a value, feel like to experience studio 12.04 but I do not want o disturb the partition of already installed 12.04 desktop version. \nI did synaptic update of list of studio's module available but I am not sure how much it covers the real ethnic studio version.

Thanks!!!! \n\nA: You can easily install everything, including the ubuntustudio real time kernel. You will find detailed instructions here. In essence, you would do the following:\nsudo apt-get install ubuntustudio-desktop ubuntustudio-audio ubuntustudio-video ubuntustudio-graphics linux-lowlatency\n\nDeinstalling it later on is likewise not hard.\n\nA: Ubuntu, XUbuntu, LUbuntu, KUbuntu, Ubuntu-Studio, EduBuntu... They all use the same kernel and is the same operating system with different systems and desktops on top. These desktops can be installed and used as you please by just selecting them when you log in. \nYou can simply install Ubuntu Studio from the software center. There's no partitioning or anything like that. You'll get both software from standard Ubuntu and the additions from Ubuntu Studio. In other words; Ubuntu is Ubuntu; you can have both Kubuntu and Xubuntu at the same time as well, for instance. \nYou do save quite a bit of downloads if you just install it from the software center, since you have much/most of the software installed already. \n", "Q: What is the release id while adding references to source list?

Also, what happens if I use an id of an older or newer Ubuntu?\nThanks.\n\nA: When adding external repositories to our sources we need to submit the exact Ubuntu release version to make sure that the packages are built to run on our system.

What controls this behavior and how easy is it to add new global actions that target a specific application (e.g. I want to be able to create a new conversation from anywhere).\n\nA: For HUD, the rule seems to be, you can do something with only those things that you can see.\nYou can ALWAYS see app-indicators, so all menu items related to these are always available.\nBut for other applications, the menu items are available only when you are 'in' that application.\n", "Q: TimesNewRoman in LibreOffice \nPossible Duplicate:\nLibreOffice missing certain Microsoft fonts \n\nI'm using ubuntu 12.04 32bit.

Valgrind's memcheck prints to stderr.  What I want to do is a modification to this:\nvalgrind --tool=memcheck ./a.out >output 2>grindout\n\nBut, I also want valgrind output to display on screen.  So program's output all goes to file.  Valgrind output is placed in grindout and displayed to screen.  How do I do so?\nthanks.\n\nA: You're looking for the tee command. Unfortunately there's some trickery regarding redirecting stderr and stdout. The following should work:\nvalgrind --tool=memcheck ./a.out 3>&1 2>&3 >output | tee grindout\n\nThis redirects standard output to output, moves standard error to a new file descriptor 3, which points to stdout. tee takes this stdout-ified stderr and prints it both to your screen and to gridnout.\n\nA: Use tee for this, but you need to play some tricks with the stdout / stderr. \nvalgrind --tool=memcheck ./a.out 2>&1 > output | tee grindout\n\nExplanation: 2>&1 sends stderr to stdout, and the regular stdout gets send to file output. The tee program passes on the stdin, but it also saves it to file grindout.\n\nA: I had this same issue. The problem was caused by buffering. You can read more about there here: http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/009\nThis is the solution that worked for me:\nstdbuf -o0 valgrind -v --tool=memcheck stdbuf -o0 ./a.out  2>&1 | stdbuf -o0 tee grindout\n\nthe 'stdbuf -o0' placed in front of each of the three programs that get executed causes them to turn off buffering.\nThe problem was never the the output wasn't being generated, nor was the problem that it wasn't going to the right place. The problem was that it wasn't getting there at the right time ( due to buffering )\n", "Q: How to get to the grub menu on lubuntu \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I get the GRUB menu to display? \n\nOn a lubuntu (lightweight ubuntu) how do you get to the grub menu?

This however is not the typical use case for a virtual machine, as we do have quite mature video playback software natively supported from Ubuntu.\n\nA: I am using 2DBench to have some numbers about 2D performance:\nhttp://www.tomshardware.de/download/Tom2D,1601-26150.html\nI have run the test three times:\n\n\n*\n\n*PAE/NX + VT/x + Nested Paging + 2D acceleration:\nBENCHMARK: DIRECT DRAWING TO VISIBLE DEVICE\n\nText: 9677 chars/sec  \nLine: 28425 lines/sec  \nPolygon: 5402 polygons/sec  \nRectangle: 3201 rects/sec  \nArc/Ellipse: 10900 ellipses/sec  \nBlitting: 4993 operations/sec  \nStretching: 257 operations/sec  \nSplines/Bézier: 11639 splines/sec  \nScore: 836  \n\n\n*PAE/NX + VT/x + Nested Paging without 2D acceleration\nBENCHMARK: DIRECT DRAWING TO VISIBLE DEVICE\n\nText: 8092 chars/sec\nLine: 18521 lines/sec\nPolygon: 7725 polygons/sec\nRectangle: 2911 rects/sec\nArc/Ellipse: 12267 ellipses/sec\nBlitting: 5599 operations/sec\nStretching: 225 operations/sec\nSplines/Bézier: 11910 splines/sec\nScore: 826\n\nWhat I have noticed is that my host cpu usage was smaller. So the vm was using my host gpu for some action to lower the cpu usage.\nSo basically it \"brings\" you more host performance because not every single 2D action is emulated through the CPU.\n", "Q: Problems with mounting .ISO files I'm using Precise, with GNOME. I've attempted to install some retro, \nmulti-cd games (KOTOR1) via .ISO images and WINE,  \nbut I can't get the ISO's to mount correctly. First I tried GMountISO, which showed a read-only warning but worked - until I went to unmount. When the installation program asked for CD 2 I couldn't unmount from the /cdrom folder because neither GMountISO or umount from terminal could detect the mount.  \nAfter a reboot, I changed to GISOMount (different somehow, I guess?), but when I attempt to mount the ISO I get an error window explaining the syntax of the mount command and, which is also what I get when I attempt to use mount from terminal. After checking /media from terminal on a lark I see the disc mounted there twice over, but umount won't recognize it, even when I specify the full path sudo umount /media/KOTOR_1.iso.

I have access to (but not root on) a compute server which is running a Linux distribution that is a few years old. I'd much prefer to use a current Debian-like flavor.\nThus, I'm wondering if it is possible to install Ubuntu (or stock Debian) in one of my directories, and use the Ubuntu programs and libraries in preference to what comes with the server.\nI would need to access arbitrary parts of the server's filesystem, not just the parts under the Ubuntu install.\nI log in by SSH, so there's no desktop environment needed. But, I would like to be able to use X programs.\n\nA: Without root access, I doubt it. You can chroot on a broken Linux installation (for example a non-working grub) to try to repair it, but you won't have access to anything \"physical\" without a mount --bind to host's /proc, /dev and /sys directories. And these kinds of mount require root access.\nA virtual machine should be your option if you are not root.\n", "Q: How do I prevent auto-completion in Terminal from escaping the $ sign In 10.04 Terminal I can enter the command:\n  cat $MYDIR/a\nthen hit tab and auto-completion expands it to:\n  cat /home/me/abc.txt\n(I have defined MYDIR in my .bashrc)\nIn 12.04 it auto completes to:\n  cat \\$MYDIR/abc.txt\nand gives a no such file error\nHow can I get the 10.04 behaviour in this respect?\n\nA: This one is complex. It is not really a bug, but an unintended consequence of a feature: see this discussion.\nBut yes, that is the behavior of bash 4.2, and many people have complained that it is a bug.

(Eg. Not the Access Points problem)\nAnd this laptop used to been online on the same network, same password, same encryption (WPA-PSK)\nWhat can be wrong ? Does it need a serious kick in the butt or removing some cached authorisation somewhere?\n\nA: There are several reasons for that, possible causes:\n\n\n*\n\n*your disk have hardware failure, like I/O errors...\n\n*You have multiple firewalls enabled, and it is better to have only one, maybe \"gufw\" is the best... and it needs to deny all with rules to allow out udp 53 and allow out tcp 25,53,80,110,143,843,993,5060,8080\n\n*Your OS is not with all modules inserted, type: lsmod > list1.txt\nThen create an USB installer with the \"startup disk creator\" using the ISO of your installation CD (a pen of 2 GB is enough) then boot from that USB PEN and choose \"try Ubuntu\" and type there: lsmod > list2.txt and copy this file to the same location the one above and open  both in text editor and see if there is missing modules in list1.txt...\nTo install missing modules use first modinfo \"name of the module\" after the description see if it needs dependencies and install those first if not, just copy the full path of the ko file and type sudo insmod \"paste path/file.ko\", after all modules inserted no need for reboot things should start working fine...\n\n*If you do not use proprietary driver, then might solve the problem due to the fact that the CPU is having trouble to process all the system in realtime, and that lack of CPU speed and Bridge speed causes wi-fi to disconnect, so try to install proprietary driver for your wireless card or disconnect every USB device that is not needed by your system to connect to the internet. If you do not find how to do this, go to \"software center\" and type \"additional drivers\" and if not installed, install it, then start it and activate all drivers available cause it will speed hings up and using less CPU...\n\n*This one is certainly your case, you are booting from an USB disk and using very fast speed which causes system resources to collapse, and has to shutdown one, and because the USB disk is the boot disk it chooses to disconnect the Wi-Fi! Solution is to connect the USB disk to an hub of less speed, like if was connected to USB3, use an USB2 hub which causes the USB disk to work at USB2 speed, if it was using USB2 then use an USB1.1 hub...\n\n*This is a long shot, and at far, your browser internet agent got corrupt or hacked by some intermediary that poses for an \"authority\" of contents provided by you, but this is a false authority, and just a cyberbulling occurence, cause there is no internet content that violates internet rules set by the internet authorities, and besides that you or anyone do not have nothing to do with the contents received, because everyone just enters the URL and the server decides which content to send, like, if two guys access the same URL at the same time, they get different pages content cause the server sends data according to lots of parameters and is configured to apply local country rules, like nudity can be considered ilegal in one country and not in other country. There is also the copyright issue but this also is not possible to violate, cause the copyright is not the act of making copies but the act of posing to be the author, that said, if one uploads copyrighted material without trying to own the copyright does not violate any internacional copyright rule. This two are the most common accusations by false \"authorities\" which makes your agent set your browser ID has an internet criminal act origin, causing every server in the world to disconnect that browser has soon it processes the browser agent, which sometimes takes several minutes... \n", "Q: How to prevent system to generate log file My Question is little bit surprising, but i need it.

So decide to reduce disk operation. How do i prevent system to generate log file or any other file which are used to keep history? I know LOG file is very important but i don't care it right now.

Any help appreciated.\nBTW USB 2.0 and 1.1 ports run well, card itself runs under win7 as charm.\nTom\n\nA: I had the same issue with my USB 3.0 card which uses Nec/Renesis controller. My card has two ports and when I connected storage enclosure (WD) to one port I had problems with recognizing it. \nWhat I found - I had to plug some other device into the second port to make the first port work. Apparently kernel driver for Nec chips cannot selectively enable/disable individual ports in my card. So I needed to use BOTH ports on that card to make it work correctly. \nI just plugged in webcam, but I think any other usb device will do the job. Ports are completely independent (they are seen as separate USB buses in \"lsusb -t\" output), so if one device is slow, it won't affect transfer speed of another port.\n", "Q: Can a version update (from 12.04 to 12.10) give driver problems?

And what about my data?\n\nA: I've been updating Ubuntu from 10.10 since 12.04. My experience with drivers is mixed.

Also most problems are solved during the first month or two of a final release. 12.10 is not yet final; it's likely there are still bugs. If you want to reduce chances of having upgrading problems, wait until the end of the year or end of January before upgrading.\n", "Q: Has anyone tried putting Ubuntu on the new macbook pro retina? Has anyone tried putting Ubuntu on the new macbook pro retina? If so, were there driver issues? I really want to do this seeing that I am starting my computer science curriculum very soon.\n\nA: I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 in Virtualbox 4.2.1 on the Macbook Pro Retina. For the most part it works fairly well after installing guest additions. \nIt freezes up at times for a minute or so then catches up with itself. (Sometimes I get a black screen for 30 seconds or so until I see Ubuntu again.)\nThe only other issue might be the fact that since OS X is scaling the resolution, everything in Ubuntu looks slightly blurry. It's not too problematic for general tasks, however it can definitely be an issue if you are a designer who wants pixel perfect accuracy.\n\nA: Short answer is Yes, it has been tried.\nThere are a couple of people who have 12.10 up and running, though with a few hinges (flaky wifi, broken brightness control, no graphic switching).

I am trying but linux does take some getting used to.\nI have installed ubuntu from live usb stick. Now I cannot boot my system without the usb being plugged in. There are answers whereby certain commands need to be run. For any command that I run with sudo (prefix) the terminal asks me for a password which I dont know. \nWhat do I do? How do I fix it such that the booting happens without usb being plugged in.\nSo far I have just been booting from USB. Please help a recent converted from Windows.\nThanks all\n\nA: First you should make sure that you've make a bootable USB and then install from the root. \nFollow the steps below:[Backup Important data before you try!]\n\n\n*\n\n*Plugin the USB and then click try Ubuntu\n\n*On the desktop click Install Ubuntu\n\n*Then select the necessary steps on creating or resizing your partitions for Ubuntu. I would recommend atleast 30 GB of space for Ubuntu.\n\n*Make sure that you have formatted the selected partition in \"ext4\" format since Linux doesn't support NTFS format.\n\n*Then Click Install\n\n*Verify that the installation is asking for Date, Time and then Username and Password.If not,you've done something wrong!\n\n\nA: The password that's being asked for is your authentication password: it's the one you set during the installation process when the installer asks for your details. Also the one you use to log into your Ubuntu desktop. :)\nNow, I'm a 2 month old Ubuntu convert myself and I don't come from a technical background, but it looks as though your Ubuntu bootloader (the program which is responsible for starting up your operating system) somehow got installed onto your flash drive instead of your HDD, as it should have been.\nThe topic that Anwar linked you to above sounds great to me. If that doesn't work, I guess you could try re-installing Ubuntu- and if you do, please go through the method described in the tutorial I'm linking you to; I used it myself, as did a friend and it worked wonders.\nUbuntu 12.04 installation tutorial\n", "Q: How do I create a new usergroup on a Mac partition? I want to do this because I'm trying to fix user permissions from Ubuntu on my Mac OS X partition and Ubuntu doesn't have the \"wheel\" group that I so desperately need!\nPlease don't trash me for this but I set my whole Mac OS X partition to give read and write access to everyone so I could access and modify everything on it from my dual-booting Ubuntu OS, and now everything is screwed...\nI don't have the original Mac OS X installation DVD and booting a Mac OS X 10.5.6 DVD gives me kernel panics... The OS installed on that Mac partition is 10.4.11.\nIs there any hope for me to ever fix it?\nI don't have money to buy utilities, and I can't use AppleJack either because my permissions are so messed up...\nNone of the posted answers are what I wanted to do. I wanted to add fields to a user that was on my Mac partition, not a user part of the Ubuntu groups. Is that possible?\n\nA: I'm not sure about what you're trying to accomplish here (big picture), but here's how to add groups.\n$ sudo addgroup mygroupname\n\nHowever, system groups like sudo, adm and wheel have a low number group id. Do this for your group wheel:\n$ sudo addgroup --system wheel\n\nYou should also be able to accomplish this using the GUI ('Users and Groups').\n\nA: OR you can use advance user settings graphical application.\nsudo apt-get install gnome-system-tools\n\n\n\nA: None of these are what I wanted to do.

Removed the extension, and the problem went away.\n\nA: I googled the issue further, and found that a lot of other people are experiencing similar issues, and that it might be a bug in Chrome v20+ across multiple  platforms. As with my experience, a lot of people are reporting that the issue is worst in gmail. You can read more about people's experiences with it here: http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=134799\nOne suggestion is the integrated flash plugin is not cooperating with chrome in some way, and some people have had success with the following command:\n google-chrome --disable-bundled-ppapi-flash\n\nWhen I tried this all I got was a separate chrome window opening and the message \"Created new window in existing browser session.\" Afterwards, typing \"about:plugins\" in the chrome search bar shows that the only flash player installed is shockwave flash v11.3.xxx, so I'm not sure if this did anything. However since then I have not experienced the issue. I do know that there have been issues in the past with chrome's flash plugin, especially if you have another flash player installed on your OS, so I wouldn't be surprised if this were the culprit.\n", "Q: virtualbox usb problem How can I use a usb stick in the virtual machine ?

If I click 'add' on the 'usb' tab of the settings, it says 'no device available'.\nThanks.\n\nA: seems you have the wrong command, the correct one is in the  VirtualBox Documentation \nsudo usermod -a -G vboxusers username\n(Where username is the user you want to add)\nThere you go, after you do that all you need to do is open Vbox and select Devices > USB > \"Whatever usb device you want to add\"\n", "Q: NTFS Corruption: Files created in Linux corrupted when Windows Boots I'm getting some file loss and corruption on my Win7/Ubuntu 12.04 dual boot setup.  I have a large shared NTFS partition.  I have my Windows Docs/Music/etc.  directories on that file and have the comparable directors in Linux setup as a sym. link.  I'm using ntfs-3g on the linux side of things to manage the ntfs partition.  The shared partition is on a logical partition along with my Linux /home / and /swap partitions.  The ntfs partition is mounted at boot time via fstab with the following options:\n ntfs-3g     users,nls=utf8,locale=en_US.UTF-8,exec,rw\n\nThe problem seems to be confined to newly created and recently edited files.  I have not see data loss or corruption when creating/editing files in Windows and then moving over to Ubuntu.  I've been using the sync command aggressively in Ubuntu to try to ensure everything is getting written to the HDD.  I do not use hibernate in Windows so I know it's not the usual missing files due to Hibernation problem.  I'm not seeing any mount related issues on dmesg.  Most recently I had a set of files related to a LaTeX document go bad.  Some of them show up in Ubuntu but I am unable to delete them.  In the GUI file browser they are given thumbnails associated with files I created on my last boot of Windows.  To be more specific: I created a few png files in Windows. The files corrupted by that Windows boot are associated with running PdfLatex on a file and are not image files.  However, two of the corrupted files show up with the thumbnail image of one of the previously mentioned png files.  The png files are not in the same directory as the latex files but they are both win the Document Folder tree.  \nI've had sucess with using NTFS for shared data in the past and am hoping there's some quirk here I'm missing and it's not just bad luck.  On one hand this appears to be some kind of Windows problem as data loss occurs when I boot to Windows after having worked in Ubuntu for a while. However, I'm assuming it's more on the Ubuntu end as it requires the special NTFS drivers.  \nEdit for more info: This is a Lenovo Thinkpad L430.  Purchased new in the last month.  So it's a fairly fresh install.  Many of the files on the shared partition were copied over from a previous NTFS formatted shared partition on another HDD. \nAs requested: here's a sample chkdsk log.  Some of the files its mentioning were files that got deleted off the partition while in Ubuntu.  Others were created/edited but not deleted.  \nChecking file system on D:\nVolume dismounted.

this problem by avoiding it and using a FAT32 partition as opposed to NTFS.  I've had zero problems with FAT32.  I don't know that this is necessarily an answer to a problem as much as its a work around, but if you find yourself in  \n\nA: Ubuntu is not responsible for the ntfs drivers. Ntfs in linux has always been buggy for me - works for a little while, but corruption does eventually occur. Ntfs is not open source, and the implementation on linux is merely a best attempt at making it work. I now mount ntfs as read only, and if I need large file support for a shared drive between the two, I use exFAT. exFAT works flawlessly on both, and requires no extra setup on Ubuntu or Windows to use.\n", "Q: Does LibreOffice have an \"Outline View\" similar to Microsoft 2010? I need to know where to find and how to use something similar to the outline view like in Microsoft Word?\n\nA: There is a 3rd-party extension for LibreOffice (and OpenOffice) called Organon.\nFrom the ReadMe on Gitub:\n\nOrganon allows to split up large texts into parts, allows tagging and opening parts of the project in new tabs.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Parts are shown in a treeview. Entries can be moved by drag and drop.\n  \n*Every entry can be tagged.\n  \n*Tags are freely configurable, can be renamed, created and deleted. Organon's Organizer is a fast way of showing and editing all tags at once.\n  \n*Tabs can be opened based on these tags. They also might freely be chosen from the folders and files of the project and they might be sorted by date and/or time.\n  \n\nMore information is available at the link, above. The author also has a blog/roadmap available with a commenting facility (there is also an issue tracker at Github).\n\nA: LibreOffice Writer does not have any feature that is exactly like the outline view in MS Office 2010 (only Impress has that), but you can still use the Navigator, which is much more useful in my opinion.\nTo open it, just go to View>Navigator in the menu or press F5.\nWhen you first open the Navigator it will be a floating Window.\n\nIf you drag the window to one side of the LibreOffice parent window, it will offer to dock the floating Navigator window.\n\nTo make it float again if it's docked, hold ctrl and double click on the Navigator (in any non-button area), and it will pop out again.\n\nA: No outline view yet in LibreOffice Writer, but many interested users - take a look at Bug 68167 ! On the other hand, LibreOffice Impress does have a basic but usable outline view.\n\nA: Recent changes have improved the situation. LibreOffice Impress has an outline view. When utilizing LibreOffice Writer, you can use the Navigator to go to the section that you want:\n\nIn order to make the outline of a document:\n\n*\n\n*You can start by typing your first outline paragraph, style it as a \"Heading 1\" (or press ctrl+1 if you don’t want to leave the keyboard).\n\n\n*When you hit Enter, the next paragraph reverts to Text Body, which is not what you expect when creating your outline. Pres ctrl+1 to style this new paragraph at level 1.\n\n\n*You can use ctrl+N (N can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5...) to set the outline level of your paragraph. Technically, that assigns a style \"Heading N\" to the item.\n\n\n*Pressing Tab and Shift+Tab allow level changes when outline items are styled as \"Heading N\".\nTo quickly scroll to an outline item for further edit: double-click on its entry in the Navigator.\nRelated features were added to Navigator in Writer 7.0:\n\n*\n\n*Heading objects in Navigator have own context menu items like Go To or Delete.\n\n*Headings in Navigator have Promote/Demote level and Promote/Demote chapter context menu items.\n\n*An Outline tracking for Headings was added for Navigator. It can be in three states: Default, Focus, Off. \"Try clicking with your mouse in several places in your big text document with many headings. You'll see that Headings in Navigator will be selected automatically according to text cursor position.\"\n\n*This is a Screenshot of Navigator showing some new features:\n\nIn Writer 7.1, a new outline folding mode was added:\n\n*\n\n*[...] \"you'll see a button with an arrow near any selected heading in your document. Click on it to fold all text from the current heading to next heading. Right click on it to fold all text from current heading to next the same level heading with all its subheadings\".\n\n\n*There's a video about it.\n\n*The official help can be seen.\n\n\n", "Q: Unable to create EFI partition on Macbook Air 3,1 A couple of months ago, I was able to install Ubuntu on my wife's Macbook Air. At the time it was still running Lion when I wiped it. About a week later, we wiped Ubuntu and installed Mountain Lion.

However this time I was not able to because I can't seem to create an EFI partition any more.\nI run the live USB disk, using this method this method to get it running. Use gparted to create a gpt partition table and create a 200 MB Fat 32 partition, giving it the boot option. When I then go through the install process, the option for making this particular partition an EFI partition doesn't show.\nI'm not sure what I'm doing wrong as I'm fairly certain this is what I did last time.

I read a new offer from ubutuone music store. That is, when you buy a new music track from ubuntuone music store, you will get 20GB cloud space. My doubt is related with 20GB of disk space.  Will the 20GB space be available for free after the expiration of 6-months valid music track, unless i am renewing the music store?\n\nA: No, you would need to get enough referrals to get the 20GB for free, or pay for more storage, or renew your streaming plan. The 20GB you get with the music streaming is included in that plan, and not a free-for-forever addition to your account separate from the streaming, when you purchase the plan.\n\nA: This promotion seems a bit misleading... but looks like after the 6 months both the music streaming service and the storage expire. \nYou can read more on their FAQ:\nWhat is the free Music Streaming promotion?\nWhat happens when my free six month Music Streaming subscription expires?\n\nA: I just purchased one single track and I have 6 months of 20mb cloud storage and mobile streaming access.

During installation of Ubuntu, I chose to encrypt my home folder.  I just don't like the fact that I can't put my computer to sleep or hibernate.  I decided I could try something else.  \nNow I don't have a lot of experience with bootloaders, but I was thinking of using TrueCrypt to encrypt both partitions by encrypting Windows then installing Ubuntu on a pre-encrypted partition.

Updates will not be downloaded during installation, but other than that, Ubuntu usually installs just fine.\nAfter installing, when you boot into your newly installed Ubuntu system, you can update your system. You will likely be prompted automatically to do so. If not, open the Update Manager (type the first few letters of Update Manager into the dash and you'll be able to click the icon for it).\nEven if you were connected to the Internet and installed updates while installing Ubuntu initially, there still might be other (typically less critically important) updates to install afterwards. So updating your system after installing it is a good idea, whether or not you are connected to the Internet when you install.\n\n*Since you're able to connect to the Internet after selecting Try Ubuntu, you can install Ubuntu while \"trying\" it.\nThere should be an Install Ubuntu icon on the desktop after you select Try Ubuntu. It should also appear in the Unity launcher (on the left side of the screen). If for some reason it doesn't appear in either place, you can open the dash (click the home button at the top of the launcher, or press the Super/Windows key) and search for it.\nThis is probably your better option, as you'll have all the (albeit modest) benefits associated with being connected to the Internet while installing Ubuntu.\n\nA: Дойдите до крестика, запустите нормальную сессию, запустите терминал и напишите:\nubuntu-bug ubiquity\nэто собирёт логи и я посмотрю что происходит.\n\nTranslation(not machine translated):\nContinue in ubiquity until you get a red cross for missing network, then initiate a try ubuntu session, launch Terminal, and execute:\nubuntu-bug ubiquity\n\nThis will read the logs and then you can give me the details so I can see what is happening.\n", "Q: Problems with run from USB installation creation and lack of option to run from USB I wanted to use and try Ubuntu from a USB flash drive so I used the Universal USB installer from PenDriveLinux. I selected ubuntu-12.04.1-alternate-amd64.iso since I have a 64bit processor on an HP 2760p. I saw no other 64bit choices.  \nWhen I booted from the USB drive, the only alternatives pertaining to running the OS were \"Install\" and \"Rescue ...\".  There was no alternative to \"Try\" the OS from the USB drive.  I was afraid to choose install for fear it would ruin my Windows installation.  What should I do?\nPrior to this there were other problems.  If I downloaded an ISO version of Linux and tried to select it from its download directory, the USB installer would not display any \"ISO\" versions in that directory  even though the OPEN window indicated it was filtering for those files.\nAs much as I loved an installation of Linux I got to play with some years back, I'm ready to give up and stick to Windows despite all of its problems.  It makes the basics, like installation, easy for anyone.  Can't install it, can't use it.  I'm an engineer and I can't get Linux or the USB Universal Installer to work as directed.  \nI'd love to dual-boot Windows and Linux however I understand the boot loader can get corrupted and needs to be reinstalled.  That would not be a problem if it can be easily done from a CD or especially from a small, handy USB stick.  Well if I can't trust the most trusted Pen Drive installer to work properly ie. can't filter or display files properly, how can I trust a boot-loader repair program.  I'd really love to use Linux.  \nAny advice?\n\nA: At first I suggest preparing your USB with the Linux Live USB Creator. I've done this last week and have had your missing try-option after booting from USB. The process of preparing your USB-drive properly is seperated into easy and comprehensive steps. All you need is an ubuntu image (e.g. the one have downloaded already) and an USB-drive.\nAlso the bootloader (i.e. grub 2 for ubuntu 12.04) operates very well IMO. It should detect your Windows installation automatically and add it to boot menu. Just get yourself familiar with some manuals and tutorials and you'll soon get enough confidence to press the all-mighty Install-button ;-)\n\nA: *\n\n*You can use yumi instead of universal USB installer it is better than it you can download it from HERE\n\n*If you want to have a dual boot of Ubuntu distributions with windows without the fear of getting boot loader corrupted you can use wubi.exe which installs it like other windows programs and you can easily uninstall ubuntu like other windows programmes.\n\n\nYou can find a complete tutorial about it HERE\n", "Q: Why Wifi no longer works 12.04.1?

Quoting your log: Failed to request firmware!\nIf it worked before, something may have caused the packages linux-firmware and linux-firmware-nonfree to be removed, or even the whole multiverse section of the Ubuntu repository might be purged.\nSo, try installing these packages again (and reboot afterwards - or reload kernel module):\n$ sudo apt-get install linux-firmware linux-firmware-nonfree\n\nIf that doesn't help, try also instructions in this Debian forum post in which the same issue is being resolved by moving around the location of the firmware file.\n", "Q: HPToucHSMART 610 - no sound from my PS3 - Ubuntu 12.04 As my hard drive crashed in my touchsmart 610 - I reinstalled my system on a linux external HDD - but since then when I plug in my PS3 via HDMI to the touchsmart I have no sound. The image from the PS3 is however working in HD perfectly fine\nAs I have tried mutliple things already. I am starting to be annoyed by this. The sound works perfectly on the computer itself (music, movies etc) but only not from the PS3.

I have an iMac G4 onto which I am trying to install Ubuntu 12.4.1. But every time I download the image, I get a message warning that the image might be damaged. Is this a problem with the image or with OSX? If it's a problem with the image, is there an image out there that isn't damaged that will run on an iMac G4 PowerPC?\n\nA: Try one of the Ubuntu mirrors for example:\nhttp://linuxfreedom.com/ubuntu-releases/12.04.1/\nThere's good list of Ubuntu mirrors here:\nhttps://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+cdmirrors\nYou'll notice there's also a file available in the download directory called MD5SUMS.  You should check your downloaded file against the MS5sum for that iso in the MD5sum file.  To get the MD5sum of the downloaded file simply type\nmd5sum filename.iso\n\nreplacing the filename with the correct name of the file you downloaded.\nUsing a torrent instead of a direct download is a good way of getting one of the distribution files if you are having corruption problems downloading it normally.\n", "Q: How can I swap the Z and Y keys on the keyboard? Most of the time I use the US qwerty layout but from time to time I also have to use the German layout which is qwertz and it is very annoying.\nHow can I swap the Y and Z keys on the German layout?\n\nThe solution was at this link:\nCustom Keyboard Layout in Ubuntu (or just Linux :) kindly provided by gertvdijk in his answer.\nNB: In recent versions of Ubuntu you have to issue sudo dpkg-reconfigure xkb-data for the changes to take effect. See this answer.\n\nA: I can now select German (qwerty) in the Unity desktop in 14.04:\n\nThis gives me exactly what I want.\nIt is also possible to switch to this particular layout in the terminal:\nsetxkbmap -layout de -variant qwerty\n\nThere is absolutely no need to mess with the system's keyboard layout files!\n\nA: It’s very simple. You should edit the German layout file; so open it through a Terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T):\nsudo gedit /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/de\nIn the opened file, you can see “z” on the 27th line:\n    key <AD06>  { [         z,          Z,    leftarrow,          yen ] };\n\nand “y” on the 38th line:\n    key <AB01>  { [         y,          Y,       guillemotright,    U203A   ] };\n\nAll you need to do is to switch y’s and z’s. Then save the file and close it.\nLog out one time and log in back again to see the result.\n\nA: To switch the z and y keys in your X (graphical) session, execute the following command in a terminal in the session:\na=52;b=29;c=xmodmap;d=\"$c -e '\";$c -pke | sed -nr \"s/^(keycode *)$b(.*)/$d\\1$a\\2'/p;t;s/^(keycode *)$a(.*)/$d\\1$b\\2'/p\" | sh\n\nA: This how-to should do the trick for system-wide keyboard remap of single keys: FAQ: How to disable/remap a keyboard key in Linux?\nAnd this how-to is about creating your own custom keymaps: Custom Keyboard Layout in Ubuntu (or just Linux :)\nIt won't allow you to change it quicky using a shortcut. You'll need some scripting to do so, I guess.\n\nHowever, from the first revision of your question I assumed you wanted to change layouts. You've revised your question, but here is how to change layouts:\nFrom the tags I assume you're running Kubuntu (KDE) 12.04 changing layouts pretty straightforward:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open 'System Settings'\n\n*Open 'Input Devices'\n\n*Select 'Keyboard' on the left vertical tab.\n\n*Select 'Layouts' on the horizontal tab.\n\n*Tick the checkbox 'Configure layouts'.\n\n*Add your preferred keyboard layouts by clickin the 'Add' button and filling in the fields in the dialog. Selecting an English (US) layout will result in 'qwerty'. -- Optionally configure a shortcut key to change layouts quickly.\n\n*Click apply.\n\n\n\nThis should cover keyboard layout and behaviour in your user session. For system wide settings including text console, see this question.\n", "Q: After update, get \"error: file not found.\" followed by \"grub rescue> _\" I just installed quite a lot of 12.10 updates, was prompted to reboot, and then found that I couldn't boot.\n\nA: I had the exact same issue - normal.mod not found, ls of the boot partition would produce a blank line. After a week of troubleshooting to get the system to boot properly here are the steps I went through.\n\n\n*\n\n*Got a copy of SuperGrub and created a boot cd.  I could now get logged back on to my system.  Got a copy of BootRepair and had not luck getting the system to boot directly from the hard disk and had to keep using the CD.  BootRepair did act a little strange since the Grub location and Grub options were grayed out.  It did report a successful install.\n\n*Hard drive was originally set up:\nsda1 ext4 root with boot\nsda2 linux swap\nsda3 ext4 used as a spare drive (holds VMs for Virtual box).\n\n*Used a copy of Ubuntu 10.10 live cd.  Ran gparted  to shrink the sda1 partition and created sda4 ext4 boot partition at the front of the drive and set mount point to /boot after deleting the boot directory from /.   BootRepair now has options available. Installed on boot partition and can now boot from hard drive.\n\n*Being curious I decided to investigate further.  The boot repair log had a peculiar entry for my sda1 ext4 partition, it was reported as DOS and had a short 8 character UUID instead of the UUID reported by blkid.  grub-probe reported the file system as vfat.  \n\n*After many other trials I cleared the first 440 bytes of sda1 partition record.  Grub-probe now reports file system as ext2.  Ran update-grub and the correct UUID for the sda1 partition appears.\nThe issue seems to be two-fold:\n1. It seem to affect installations where the partition record has references to msdos.\n2. grub-probe does not try to resolve mismatch issues between fs type and contents in the partition record.\n\nA: Use Boot Repair to fix your bootloader.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot Ubuntu from a LiveCD or Live USB\n\n*Connect to the internet\n\n*Open a terminal, and add the Boot Repair PPA\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair && sudo apt-get update\n\n*Install Boot Repair\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && boot-repair\n\n*Launch and use, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair#Using_Boot-Repair for more details\n\nA: *\n\n*Type ls to get a list of partitions\n\n*Enter set prefix=(hd0,msdos6)/boot/grub [you will almost certainly have to enter a different drive/partition in the brackets, you may just have to try all of those listed by ls until you find the one that works.\n\n*Type insmod normal\n\n*Type normal and you will get your boot prompt back!\n\n\nSee also: The helpful place where I found this. I doubt this will work for everyone encountering this error, but I've put it here in the hope it helps someone.\nOnce you've loaded Ubuntu, run sudo grub-install /dev/sda and sudo update-grub as soon as possible. This means you won't have to do that tedious process above every time you boot your machine.\n\nA: Another thing to check is the boot order in your BIOS. I apparently had installed grub installed on all my disks (perhaps after following 8128's answer), but this broke when updating my Linux distro (Debian). Changing the first boot disk as my Linux OS fixed it.\n\nA: I ran across this error upgrading to Kubuntu 13.10.   I had a memory stick plugged into the USB port during the dist-upgrade.  After rebooting I went straight to Grub Rescue.  Unplugging the USB drive and rebooting fixed the problem. \n\nA: In my case, I had downgraded to  GRUBv1 and after the upgrade to 12.10 grub2 couldn't find his files (*.mod, etc...), although the grub.cfg was there.\nI found a more comprehensive manual on grub rescue:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/Troubleshooting#grub_rescue.3E-1\nSee also the command list at the begining of the page.\nThx flute flute.\n", "Q: Is there any way to synchronize flash audio and video? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I fix Flash issues? \n\nI've tried to search, but nothing works.\nMy Flash audio is always out of sync.

For example, /home/foo/Documents bind mounted to /media/Documents (mount point of /dev/VG/Documents), etc.\nIf I set up deja-dup to just back up my home folder, am I guaranteed that everything from my LVMs will be backed up properly? So let's say I take away my LVMs for some reason and choose to restore an earlier backup. My home folder will contain everything from the LVMs? All my docs, music, vids etc. My intuition tells me everything will be fine but it doesn't hurt to ask the the experts ;). Hope I have made myself clear. Thanks\n\nA: Yes.  The bind mount is immaterial, and as long as your backup tool is not configured to only backup the one filesystem and not descend into any mount points ( like the --one-file-system option to tar ) then the subdirectories in those mount points will be backed up.\n", "Q: How will 12.10 disk encryption affect performance? As the title suggests. Massive performance degradation?\nAnd what technology does it use?\n\nA: Depends on your hardware of course. Most important performance enhancement is using a CPU with AES-NI capabilities, provided by most of the recent Core i5/i7 processors and a kernel supporting it (most recent versions do). It's similar to video acceleration, but then for AES calculations.\nDo a grep aes /proc/cpuinfo to see if your CPU is capable. If so, it will then be able to en/decrypt hundreds of megabytes a second without too much load; more than enough for most systems or a root filesystem. Provided your encryption software uses this (kernel interface). Using dm-crypt (Luks) does this for sure. This Arch Wiki article claims you should be able to do roughly 570 MB/s on a first-generation i7 CPU.\nI haven't done real benchmarking, but I find almost no slowdown in doing a read-only benchmark using 'palimpsest' (Gnome Disk Utility) on my Intel 310 series 80GB SSD using dm-crypt (full disk) encryption enabled. A steady ~ 250 MB/s sequential reading all the way on an LVM LV (on top of dm-crypt).\nSee this Phoronix article for serious benchmarks of AES-NI and dm-crypt. An excerpt from that article:\n\nWhile the Ubuntu home directory encryption feature with eCryptfs may\n  not be beneficial at this point with Intel AES-NI, full-disk\n  encryption with Intel AES-NI using dmcrypt is noticeably better.\n  Several of the benchmarks produced dramatically better results with\n  AES-NI while at the same time delivering lower CPU usage. AES-NI\n  appears to be a huge win if planning to encrypt your entire disk using\n  this feature found in Ubuntu's alternate installer.\n\nThis is a bit outdated now, and eCryptfs might not be suffering these slowdowns anymore.\n", "Q: Application to view and print calendar events in a list (using .ics files) I use the Lightning extension in Mozilla Thunderbird for my calendars. I'd like to be able to view and print my calendar events in a list format like\nDATE  Event\nDATE  Event\nDATE  Event\n\nand so on. Is there any way to make Lighting do this? Or are there any other applications that could do this?\n\nA: The latest Thunderbird (31) in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS does include a list print format but it's not exactly as you want it.\nIt includes all details of an event, including the description. You can find the option under Print > Layout > List.\n", "Q: I can't connect to wifi network after spoofing my mac address I'm trying to connect to my own network but spoof my mac address: I can spoof my mac address fine, but when I try to connect to my wifi network, it won't let me connect.\nAnd no my network doesn't have any sort of mac filtering.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: I had the same problem, try to deactivate network-manager and activate it again.

Terminal output:\nname@name:~$ sudo apt-get install fglrx-updates\n[sudo] password for name: \nReading package lists... Done\nBuilding dependency tree       \nReading state information... Done\nSome packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have\nrequested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable\ndistribution that some required packages have not yet been created\nor been moved out of Incoming.\nThe following information may help resolve the situation:\n\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\n fglrx-updates : Depends: lib32gcc1 but it is not going to be installed\n                 Depends: libc6-i386 but it is not going to be installed\nE: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.\n\nPlease give a simple answer as I may not understand very complex ones.\n\nA: Your answer\nIf you have not installed lib32gcc1 & libc6-i386, to fix the dependencies problem you should use sudo gdebi fglrx*.deb instead of sudo apt-get install fglrx-updates.\nThe GDebi is a tool that install .deb packages and solve automatically the independencies problems.\nIt is only one way of many to solve this.

Now I want to repartition my hard-drive and I'm not really sure on how to do it. \nI found some programs and tools to handle the partitions but not any info on whether it's possible to merge the two seperated partitions again. Is there a way?\n\nA: GParted is a great program to create, resize and delete partitions. You cannot edit the partition that your system is running from so it is probably best to run it from a live cd or usb.\nYou can't really merge partitions but you can copy all the data from the first to the second, delete the first and then expand the second to fill the disk. \nWindows and Ubuntu need to be on separate partitions and they have different file systems, Ubuntu uses ext4 while Windows uses NTFS, Ubuntu can read both but Windows can only read NTFS.\n", "Q: What is the correct way to completely remove an application? I've searched the net for such information and found different command lines, like these ones:\nsudo apt-get remove application\nsudo apt-get remove application*\n\nsudo apt-get remove --purge application\nsudo apt-get remove --purge application*\n\nsudo apt-get purge application\nsudo apt-get purge application*\n\nSo, what is the correct way? Is it necessary to use that \"*\"?\nAfter that, I also found these commands:\nsudo updatedb\nsudo locate application\nsudo rm -rf (file/folder name)\n\n\nA: *\n\n*apt-get remove packagename\nwill remove the binaries, but not the configuration or data files of the package packagename. It will also leave dependencies installed with it on installation time untouched.\n\n*apt-get purge packagename or apt-get remove --purge packagename\nwill remove about everything regarding the package packagename, but not the dependencies installed with it on installation. Both commands are equivalent.\nParticularly useful when you want to 'start all over' with an application because you messed up the configuration. However, it does not remove configuration or data files residing in users home directories, usually in hidden folders there. There is no easy way to get those removed as well.\n\n*apt-get autoremove\nremoves orphaned packages, i.e. installed packages that used to be installed as an dependency, but aren't any longer. Use this after removing a package which had installed dependencies you're no longer interested in.\n\n*aptitude remove packagename or aptitude purge packagename (likewise)\nwill also attempt to remove other packages which were required by packagename on but are not required by any remaining packages. Note that aptitude only remembers dependency information for packages that it has installed. \nAnd many more exist. Lower-level dpkg-commands can be used (advanced), or GUI tools like Muon, Synaptic, Software Center, etc. There's no single 'correct way' of removing applications or performing other tasks interacting with your package management.\nThe list you found are just examples. Make sure you understand the meanings and try out what it wants to do before accepting the action (you need to press Y before it actually performs the actions as proposed).\nThe asterisk version in the question is probably wrong; apt-get accepts a regular expression and not a glob pattern as the shell. So what happens with\nsudo apt-get remove application*\n\nis the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*The shell tries to expand application* looking at the files in the current directory. If (as is normally the case) it finds nothing, it returns the glob pattern unaltered (supposing bash with default behavior here --- zsh will error out).\n\n*apt-get will remove the packages whose name contains a string that satisfies the regular expression application*, that is, applicatio followed by an arbitrary number of n: applicatio, application, applicationn, libapplicatio, etc.\n\n*To see how this can be dangerous, try (without root for double safety) apt-get -s remove \"wine*\" (-s will simulate the thing instead of doing it) --- it will say is going to remove all packages that has \"win\" in their name and the dependant, almost the entire system...\nProbably, the command that was meant is really\n sudo apt-get remove \"^application.*\"\n\n(note the quotes and the dot) which will remove all packages whose name starts with application.\nThese commands,\nsudo updatedb                  # <-- updates the locate database (index). harmless\nsudo locate application        # <-- locates the file 'application'. harmless\nsudo rm -rf (file/folder name) # <-- removes files/dirs recursively. dangerous.\n\nare completely outside the scope of the package management. Do not remove files belonging to packages without using the package manager! It will get confused and is the wrong way to do things.\nIf you don't know to which package a file belongs, try this:\ndpkg -S /path/to/file\n\n\nA: You can safely use sudo apt-get remove --purge application or sudo apt-get remove applications 99% of the time. When you use the purge flag, it simply removes all config files too. Which may or may not be what you want, depending on if you want to reinstall said application. The application* will match all applications that start with application, which are usually plugins, additional features, etc of the main application you are removing. i.e. \nsudo apt-get remove gedit*\n\nwould remove gedit, gedit-plugins and gedit-common. Typically it is not necessary to do this, because most plugins/associated programs are dependent on the main application, and will automatically be removed (or marked for removal) when you uninstall the main application. \nYour last command is just to remove leftovers from applications that are known to have messy uninstallers, and it is just removing any remnants of the application.\n\nA: I found this command in internet.\ndpkg --purge --force-depends application\n\nhttp://www.debian-administration.org/article/Reinstalling_packages_to_fix_problems.\n\nA: I got some error messages removing a package, the only way I found that worked was this:\nmv /var/lib/dpkg/info/package.* /tmp/\ndpkg --remove --force-remove-reinstreq package\n\nI found that although using only\ndpkg --remove --force-remove-reinstreq package\n\ndoes not remove the package it shows me the correct path to the file to move with:\nmv /var/lib/dpkg/info/package.* /tmp/\n\nSubstitute package with your application name. Use sudo in Ubuntu, become root in Debian.\n\nA: You can use this command:\nsudo apt-get purge --auto-remove packagename\n\nIt will purge required packages along with dependencies that are installed with those packages. The --auto-remove option (being an alias of autoremove) works similar to sudo apt-get autoremove. By using this command we can run a single command:\nsudo apt-get purge --auto-remove packagename\n\nInstead of:\nsudo apt-get purge packagename\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\n\nA: I just wanted to clarify one thing that seems to be a source of confusion on here.\nThe dpkg utility does not know about or track packages dependencies in relation to one another, which was a big reason that apt was developed I believe. You can read about it in section 8.6 on this page The Debian GNU/Linux FAQ - The Debian package management tools\n\n\n*\n\n*With apt: If I wanted to purge package A, and it has a dependency\ncalled package B, and package B had no other dependent packages, then\npackage A and B will be purged. If package B DID have other dependent\npackages, then only package A will be purged.\n\n*With dpkg: What dependency? You just told me to purge the damn\npackage so that's what I did! Poor planning on your part does not\nconstitute an emergency on my part.\nWith that said, here are two one-liners which can be used for each purge methods:\ndpkg --list |grep \"^rc\" | cut -d \" \" -f 3 | xargs sudo dpkg --dry-run --purge\n\napt-get autoremove -y; apt-get --dry-run purge -y $(dpkg --list |grep '^rc' |awk '{print $2}')\n\nRemove the --dry-run to perform the actual purge operation instead of reporting what actions it would have taken.\n\nA: For Ubuntu 12.04 and maybe higher, the correct method is:\nsudo apt-get --purge autoremove packagename\n\nAs detailed here.\nDo not use packagename* as that can delete unintended packages and cause more problems than it solves.  Or if you must, at least run it with a -s, --simulate, --dry-run flag first to see exactly what it will do without doing it.\n\nA: It depends on the application you want to remove. Always be sure to check its dependencies before issuing the yes command. When you remove something by command line, it will sometimes show a handful of libraries that are no longer needed. These can be removed with apt-get autoremove. \nBeware that by using commands such as sudo apt-get remove --purge applicationname may remove some dependencies that are needed by other applications and, as such, might break your system. \nIf you want to do it in the safer way, you can always remove it using just the software center or apt-get remove applicationname. If the dependencies aren't needed anymore, issue apt-get autoremove later. \n\nA: To remove everything regarding the package package name like data and configuration, but not the dependencies installed with it on installation use:\napt-get remove --purge packagename\n\n", "Q: I need to know how to open lshw, also known as Hardware Lister \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow can I find my hardware details? \n\nIf you can't explain this to me then please direct me then please direct me to another hardware listing program.\n\nA: Open the dash. Then, search for Terminal. Open it. (It may be called Terminal Emulator).\nWait for a pronpt that looks like user@computer:~$. Then, type:\nsudo lshw\n\nand press Enter. \nYou will be prompted for your password. Give it(the space will remain blank, not even ******), and press Enter. If the password is correct, the command will return results after a delay that can sometimes take a few minutes. You know it's finished when you see the user@computer:~$ prompt again.\n", "Q: Are world-writable folders safe? Is it safe to chmod a directory 777, or is it a security risk?\nOne of my scripts requires that in order to run in multi-user situations, and I'm wondering if it's okay.\n\nA: While it is generally considered to be a bad practice, because any user can remove or modify any other users data, it is not such a great risk in itself; or, better said, it all depends on the context. On a machine with a limited number of trusted users this is not really a problem, as long as the script is not world accessible (like a web cgi) or runs as root.\nHowever, there are many ways such a need can be avoided, and if you post some details (why must the script use 777?), we can consider a better solution. One semi-solution is to set the +t bit; that way, any user can write in the directory, but only that user can then remove or modify the created files.\n", "Q: Display wakes up unexpectedly without activity on Ubuntu 12.04 When I use lock screen with ubuntu 12.04, all applications are hidden and a simple window asks me to enter my password to unlock the screen. After a while of inactivity, the screen goes black. However, only a few seconds after, it goes back to that window again as though the mouse had been moved, though that is not the case. Is this a known bug, and if so, how to get around it, and if not, then what I am doing wrong ?\nThanks\n\nA: Check to see if you have wol (Wake On Lan) turned on in your bios. If there is any activity at all, it will wake the system up from hibernation. This may be the issue.\nI hope this helps.\n\nA: Well in some cases the motherboard bios could be to new for the kernel to realize it's there, others could be that development never happened for it and the kernel doesn't know how to handle it when it wakes up. In any case WOL is used to keep a machine alive for things of this nature - db transactions or some client server activity. I personally don't like wol but there are cases where it is necessary.\nAs for a fix I think if you turn WOL off that would fix your problem as to why it causes it. I am not sure. I am sorry if that is not a complete answer, I will try and research it for you as best I can.\n", "Q: Destroyed /usr/local partition I've got three partitions at installation of Ubuntu 12.04, whose mount points are:\n/  \n/usr/local   \n/home  \n\nBut I needed a partition so I merged /usr/local by copying all its contents into a folder named local2. Then I dismounted and formatted partition of /usr/local, and then I moved the folder local2 to /usr/local. \nUbuntu seems to work fine, but when I turn on PC, Ubuntu start screen says (more or less):\n/usr/local partition not found. Press S to skip or M to mount it manually.\n\nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: Edit /etc/fstab (as root) -- remove the line that refers to /usr/local.\n\nA: Open the terminal and type:\ngksudo gedit /etc/fstab\n\nLook for the line that points to /usr/local. You probably have that partition set to auto-mount if you specified \"defaults\" as an option. When partitions are auto-mounted on boot, Ubuntu will check and try to mount it on boot, but since you formatted the said partition, it's UUID have changed and therefore Ubuntu cannot find it on boot. \nYou just need to edit the UUID of the /usr/local partition. You can check the UUID by running: \nsudo blkid\n\nOnce you have the UUID, just copy it and replace the UUID on the line that points to /usr/local.\n", "Q: Bootable USB Stick Failing To Load After creating a bootable USB stick on my windows computer, I turned off a seperate computer, a laptop that I owned and plugged the USB stick into the computer.

It should remember the profile the next time you plug in (or connect for Bluetooth).\n\nFor a command-line way of doing this, try\nBLUEZCARD=`pactl list cards short | egrep -o bluez.*[[:space:]]`\npactl set-card-profile $BLUEZCARD a2dp\n\nAs can be found in this answer (by @izx).\n", "Q: Mac Bootable CD not loading I''m trying to install (dualboot) Ubuntu on my Macbook with installed Mac OS X Mountain Lion with Intel processors, and am running into some issues.

I want to document the list of supported GVFS protocols in Ubuntu 12.04 (e.g. AFC, AFP, and WebDAV), but I don't know how to list them, besides running locate gvfs, and I wonder if someone has already documented them.\nHow can I obtain a list of installed GVFS protocols, and how can I obtain definitive descriptions/specifications of these protocols in general?\n\nA: Introduction\nI can give you an answer for 12.04, although this may not be a totally definitive list of protocols. Before we start discussing the protocols, here is a quick summary of the nature of gvfs from /usr/share/doc/gvfs/gvfs-libs/README:\n\nGvfs is a userspace virtual filesystem designed to work with the i/o\n  abstractions of gio (a library availible in glib >= 2.15.1). It\n  installs several modules that are automatically used by applications\n  using the APIs of libgio. There is also fuse support that allows\n  applications not using gio to access the gvfs filesystems.\nThe gvfs model differs from e.g. gnome-vfs in that filesystems must\n  be mounted before they are used. There is a central daemon (gvfsd)\n  that handles coordinting mounts, and then each mount is (typically)\n  in its own daemon process (although mounts can share daemon process).\n\n\nProtocols\nA lot of the supported protocols are listed in the gvfs-backends package and the tools you can use with those protocols are listed in the gvfs-bin package, which if you have them installed are available by right clicking the package in Synaptic and clicking on installed files to show the list.\nComparing the gvfs-backends package description and the list of installed files in Synaptic comes up with the following list. \narchive://        archive files support\nafp://            Apple file protocol support\nafc://            access mobile devices such as iphone and ipod Touch\ncdda://           audio cds support\ncifs://           communicate with cifs servers\ndav:// (webdav://) handles remote filesystems\nfile:///          access a local file, for example,  \nftp://            access and use ftp server\ngphoto2://        PTP camera and MTP media player support\nhttp://           open http resources\nhttps://          connect securely with https\nobexftp://        bluetooth support \nsmb://            communicate with samba servers\nssh://            connect securely to server\nsftp://           send files securely via sftp \nusb://            mount a usb device directly, for example,  \n\nThis is just a bare list; to do something with these protocols you can use the gvfs tools on the command line such as gvfs-open or gvfs-mount. The tools are listed in the gvfs-bin package at Ubuntu packages and in Synaptic if installed.  Basic examples from the command-line are:\ngvfs-open file:///home/mike/\ngvfs-open http://www.askubuntu.com\n\nThe first example will open you home folder in your default file browser; the second will open askubuntu in your browser.\nFor examples to do with remote filesystems, see this article.\nAs this answer was not supposed to go into detail on how to use the protocols, I won't go into great detail here, as there are other gvfs articles on this site.\n", "Q: How do I install Ubuntu on an Asus EeePc t91mt \nPossible Duplicate:\nMy computer boots to a black screen, what options do I have to fix it? \n\nI have tried Ubuntu 12.04.1 in an Asus EeePc t91mt; In live Cd mode it works fine (touch screen, wifi, bluetooth,..), but when I installed it and restarted the screen stay black and nothing happen(it could be the video card driver). \nBut i do not understand why in the liveCd mode it works and it does not work when I install it.

I'm installing a new printer and I'm given 4 connection options.\n\n\n*\n\n*AppSocket/JetDirect network printer via DNS-SD\n\n*LPD network printer via DNS-SD\n\n*IPP network printer via DNS-SD\n\n*AppSocket/HP JetDirect\n\n\nWhich one should I choose?\nIt's a Samsung CLP-320 if it makes a difference.\n\nA: http://www.cups.org/doc/network.html -- see Choosing a Network Protocol (Backend).\nBoth the LPD and JetDirect/AppSocket protocols can be used over the Internet today, however neither of these protocols provides authentication services, access control, and all of the document management and formatting (including printer-specific commands) must be handled by the machine sending the document. If you don't know what kind of printer is on the receiving end you may not be able to successfully print your document!\nThis was back in 2005 so things might have changed\n\nA: @waspinator's answer of the question goes a long way already (I upvoted it). But here are some additional details...\nThe main advantage of IPP over JetDirect/AppSocket are these:\n\n\n*\n\n*AppSocket is a \"fire and forget\" protocol. IPP(S) can give a very detailed backchannel info about the current state of job processing (which page is currently printed), and more (like query about past, completed or cancelled jobs).\n\n*AppSocket is a very simple protocol, so everybody could reverse engineer it after HP introduced it (quite long ago) and even though it never was an official standard; it's also quite reliable and robust (with all this empty set of 'features' it supports) -- which is why it was widely used and supported by virtually every network printer out there.\n\n*IPP is standardized by the ISTO Printer Working Group (PWG), which is a representation of practically every single printer manufacturer around the world. HP themselves even have embraced IPP quite closely, having more than 350 of their newest printer models self-certified to be consistent with the new 'IPP Everywhere' Standard.\n\n*With IPP(S) you have much better options related to security: authentication/authorization, encryption of transferred data, access control, etc.\n\n*With IPP you have a specified set of names and values for print job options. Duplex printing is either one of 'sides=two-sided-long-edge' or '...=two-sided-short-edge', whereas before, you could have up to ten or more ways to specify a duplex printout (because every vendor was free to use his own naming scheme). The same holds true for many other print parameters.\n\n*IPP(S) allow you query an IPP-enabled printer (and more than 90% of devices sold in the last 10 years can talk IPP -- because AirPrint can only work because of it; and more than half of these can directly consume PDF too) about its specific capabilities: Can it do color? Which paper sizes does it support? Does it do duplex prints? Can it staple, punch, fold? Which IPP versions does it support? Which Page Description Language (PDL -- PostScript, PDF, PCL, JPEG, etc) can I send to it? Etc.pp. ...\n\n*With the latest evolution of the IPP Standard, aptly called 'IPP Everywhere', finally driverless printing starts to work. CUPS can do it! Whenever it encounters an IPP Everywhere printer, it does not need any driver and/or device specific PPD prepared or pre-installed by the administrator any longer: it knows it can send one of the standard page description formats (either of JPEG, PWG-Raster, URF-Raster or PDF which don't require a proprietary driver to generate), it can query the device about its specific capabilities and it will auto-create a PPD reflecting these capabilities so even non-IPP-enabled applications can still print the traditional way (these 'legacy' apps don't talk IPP yet and are used to look for PPDs -- apps like LibreOffice or Firefox or what-not do).\nIPP is the future, and the future is already here. (AppSocket is the past, but it is not yet completely gone. Most IPP printers still talk AppSocket too....)\n\nIn the specific case of your printer, though: some vendors/models have buggy IPP implementations, and they may not work well, while AppSocket printing to the same model may work flawlessly. Just test it with IPP, and keep using it if it works fine. If not, revert to AppSocket (or USB).\n\nA: Since that printer is USB the answer is none of them, as they are all for network printers. When you plug the printer in on USB it should be detected automatically by the printer setup tool.\n", "Q: How to run a bash script in terminal but hide the terminal on startup?

I am trying to install the newest version of Ubuntu for power pc, and after trying to burn the ISO onto the dvd, it says it could not verify the ISO. What should I do?\n\nA: There might have been a connection problem while downloading ISO, or while saving downloaded content to disk the operating system you are using may made a mistake, it happens from time to time. You can try re-downloading the ISO.\nAlso, before burning ISO to media check if md5sum of ISO is correct. Hashes are here.\n\nA: First, check to make sure the ISO you downloaded isn't corrupted. In the Mac OS X command line, you can run the, MD5 command to get the checksum for the disk image:\nmd5 /path/to/image/ubuntu-12.04.2-server-amd64.iso\n\nYou can then compare the result of the command against the expected result that is listed here: http://releases.ubuntu.com/12.04.2/MD5SUMS\nIf your image is correct, and you're still having problems, it's probably because ubuntu has been making disk images lately using a new hybridized file format that doesn't place nice with the Mac OS X operating system. Some users have found command line operations that will allow them to rebuild the ISO for Mac OS X, but I have yet find a bulletproof method.

What's an efficient slice size?\n\nA: According to the Wikipedia article,\n\nIt is, however, possible to circumvent this limitation by using the multi-extent (fragmentation) feature of ISO 9660 Level 3 and create ISO 9660 filesystems and single files up to 8 TB. With this, files larger than 4 GB can be split up into multiple extents (sequential series of sectors), each not exceeding the 4 GB limit. For example, the free software such as InfraRecorder and mkisofs as well as Roxio Toast are able to create ISO 9660 filesystems that use multi-extent files to store files larger than 4 GB on appropriate media such as recordable DVDs.\n\nSo a slice can be as large as a DVD (about 4.3 GB binary for a single-layer disc).\nLimited file size\nIf, for whatever reason, you need to limit the file size to no more than max_file_size and the disk holds disk_size, make your slice size the largest disk_size / s less than max_file_size, where s is an integer. That way, you can fit s slices on the disk exactly (ignoring round-off error), wasting no space. For disk_size ≈ 4.3 GB and max_file_size = 1 GB, you could then make each slice 880 MB, fitting 5 slices per disc.\n", "Q: \"apt-get -f install\" fails with \"/usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)\" \nPossible Duplicate:\nFixing Broken Packages \n\nI started out trying to install CVS:\n$ sudo apt-get install cvs\nReading package lists...

In Unity, I'd press ctrl+w to close the current tab, and alt+F4 to close the current window (e.g. in gedit and Firefox).\nNow, in Gnome Shell, ctrl+w is closing the current window instead, and alt+F4 does nothing. I've checked the menu of Firefox, and it says File > Close Tab is ctrl+w as expected. Selecting this item works also.\nWhen I right click my menubar, the minimise/maximise popup menu appears.

While doing this I got “permission denied” from SIOCSIFFLAGS.\nMy question is how can I get to the root of Ubuntu to get total control of my machine?\n\nA: When you run a shell command to perform a task that requires system administrator permission, you need to put sudo in front of it. sudo stands for “do as super user”. You will be prompted for your password (if you run several commands in quick succession, you will only get a password prompt the first time), and you must be authorized to run command as administrator (which is the case for the initial user created during an Ubuntu installation).\nsudo ifconfig eth0 hwaddr 01:23:45:67:89:ab\n\nSee the Ubuntu wiki for more information.\nIf adding sudo isn't enough, edit your question to be more precise. Copy-paste the command(s) that you ran and the error messages.\n", "Q: I Can't access  the root folder I do not have access to my root folder: Ubuntu says I do not have the necessary permissions to access it. I also cannot access lost + found, which gives me the same error message\nIs there anyone here that can provide answers to these questions?\n\nA: There are two different folders called the \"root\" folder: / (the root of the filesystem, which is really the only folder that should ever be called the \"root folder\"), and /root (the root user's home directory). During the normal course of operation (i.e., except while performing administrative tasks), users cannot create new files in / or /root.\nYou should not change the ownership or permissions of either directory (changing them for / in particular could break things very badly, perhaps even beyond creating security problems depending on what assumptions your applications and services make about the ownership and permissions of /).\nIf you have the gksu package installed, you can run gksudo nautilus to open a root-owned file browser window. If you do this, please be extra careful to only use it for tasks where you must be root, and to close it when you're done (so you don't later confuse it with an ordinary Nautilus window).\nIf you don't have gksu installed and don't want to install it, sudo -i nautilus or sudo -H nautilus are reasonably safe. (In contrast, if you were to use plain sudo nautilus, you might have to fix some things in your home directory to get Nautilus to work properly again when you're not running it as root.)\nHowever, usually you don't need to do that either. You rarely have to manually edit the top-level contents of / or the contents of /root. I recommend providng more information--or asking a new question--to explain exactly what you're trying to accomplish. The particular task you need to do will determine how you should proceed.\nFinally, a note on lost+found. This stores files recovered in filesystem repair operations. Since such files could be from anywhere in the filesystem, it's necessary to require root permissions to access them (or any information on the system could potentially be accessed by someone who is not an administrator). If you think there may be files there that you wish to reclaim, you can check by running\nsudo ls /lost+found\n\nin a Terminal window (Ctrl+Alt+T).\nIf there are files there that you want, then you can copy them out (and if their ownership and permissions don't give you the necessary access, change them). You can do that as root from the Terminal with cp, chmod and chown (run as root with sudo), or with a root-owned Nautilus window as described above.\nIf you need to change ownership and permissions for files, then:\n\n\n*\n\n*make sure not to do so for more files than necessary--for example, some people accidentally change ownership or permissions for large parts of the system and then have to reinstall, and\n\n*I recommend this guide for understanding the ownership/permissions system in Ubuntu (which also applies to most other Unix-like OSes). Wikipedia may help too.\n\n\nA: You need to do the following:\nEdit /etc/ssh/sshd_config using sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config\nLook for the line that says:\n#PermitRootLogin yes\n\nMake sure it looks like the below line:\nPermitRootLogin yes\n\nNo hashes (i.e., #) and the yes is there.\n\nA: Yes, this is normal to Ubuntu and every Linux distributions. You can't access to the root folder because that folder is owned by root and it's user folder.\nBut, you can access that folder if you really want by using sudo -i command in the terminal. Be warned that, if you mess anything, it is your responsibility.\nAlso using nautilus by Pressing Super+F2 key and typing gksu nautilus\nChanging permissions of root folder.\nAssuming you want to change the permission of root user's home folder, which is /root folder, I would say, it is very bad idea to do so. Because, if you change the permission of root's home and you delete or modified some crucial file there, This may result in totally un-usable system. You may need to install Ubuntu from scratch.\nBut, if you really want it, the command is chmod:\nsudo chmod -R 777 /root\n\nwill let you gain access to the /root folder.

That's part 2 of a question asked earlier (to be able to give credit to the answers individually).\nWhen I type into the Dash applications show up with their title (also when hovering over the launcher), how can I find the associated desktop file. When I look into the usual suspect locations (/usr/share/applications and ~/.local/share/applications) with Nautilus I see the titles, but not the file names (not even in properties which sucks). When I look from the command line I see the file names but not the titles (a switch would be nice).\nHow can I get a listing (a custom column?) that shows them next to each other?\n\nA: Command line\ngrep ^Name=  /usr/share/applications/* | sed 's/:Name=/   /'\n\ngrep searches in all file in /usr/share/applications/ for a line starting with Name=. \nFor each line it finds it prints filename:line, for example\n/usr/share/applications/yelp.desktop:Name=Help\n\nTo make it look a bit better we use sed 's/:Name=/   /' to replace :Name= with   (three spaces)\nQuick hack for the list view in Nautilus:\nInstall the package python-nautilus, create the folder ~/.local/share/nautilus-python/extensions and save the following code as ~/.local/share/nautilus-python/extensions/filename-column.py:\nimport os\nimport urllib\n\nfrom gi.repository import Nautilus, GObject\n\nclass FilenameColumn(GObject.GObject, Nautilus.ColumnProvider, Nautilus.InfoProvider):\n    def __init__(self):\n        pass\n\n    def get_columns(self):\n        return Nautilus.Column(name=\"NautilusPython::fd_filename_column\",\n                               attribute=\"fd_filename\",\n                               label=\"file name\",\n                               description=\"file name\"),\n\n    def update_file_info(self, file):\n        filename = file.get_name()        \n        file.add_string_attribute('fd_filename', filename)\n\nRun nautilus -q; nautilus& at the command line to restart Nautilus.

Though using single or single display desktop (multi-display desktop, one workspace for each display) will maintain normal FPS during video playback or rendering.\nBecause you mentioned both ATI and Nvidia having this issue, I'm going to assume it might be something specific with Xubuntu and running any dual display desktop.

There appears something like a scar (damaged or dead pixels) on my LCD screen, where Ubuntu launcher positions. The scar exactly fitting Ubuntu launcher edges and icons.

The Good news appears to be that unlike plasma screen and phosphor screen burn-in, persistence is generally reversible.\nIt's caused by the the liquid crystals that are in a turned on state for very long periods of time not \"relaxing\" completely back to the non-activated state.  There's two main approaches to reversing the problem:\nSolution 1\nTurn the screen off and do not use it for an extended period of time.  This may vary from a few days to a few weeks, depending on the nature of the liquid crystals and how bad the problem is.\nSolution 2\nSet up a screen saver that is one white image that covers the entire screen.  Set the screen saver to activate in a short amount of time, say one or two minutes.  Set the screen to turn off after about 15 minutes of inactivity.  This way, when the computer is idle it will display the white screen for less than 15 minutes, then go blank.  After a period of this you should see the problem lessen and eventually go away.  When the problem is fixed you can go back to a normal screen saver, or simply do as I do and set the screen to turn off after a reasonable amount of time.\nThe last solution (2) is one that seems to be suggested a lot, however I believe that the first solution is most likely to reverse the problem completely and in the shortest possible time.\n\nA: Use the tool \"lcdscrub\": http://toastycode.com/lcdscrub/\nIt also can be found in the packages xscreensaver-data-extra\n", "Q: Iomega Home Media Network Hard Drive 1TB Cloud Edition failed, data recovery?

This behavior is excruciatingly annoying because I often move a window (usually text editors) partially outside the current screen so I can view another window below it (usually a browser). Every time I Alt + Tab back to the text editor, I'm getting an unnecessary virtual screen switch, and Unity is rearranging the windows behind my back.\nFor instance, here is a browser and text editor on Virtual Screen 1 (top left), note that the text editor is partially outside the current screen:\n\nThen I Alt-Tab to the browser (or clicked on it):\n\nNext, I Alt + Tab again to get back to the text editor, but Alt-Tab switched me to Virtual Screen 4 (bottom right) because a larger percentage of the text editor window is on virtual screen 4 than in virtual screen 1; and the browser is no longer in the screen. Also note that the text editor window moves from being on the bottom-right to the top-left, which is very disorienting as I can no longer keep track of where any of my windows are since they all keep moving around by themselves..\n\nHow do I disable this behavior? I don't want to have any virtual screen switch when Alt + Tab , especially since Alt + Tab does not list windows that is completely not in the current virtual screen anyway.\n\nA: I believe the solution you want is to tell the compiz place plugin to ignore the window in question.  You can edit the compiz plugin settings with gconf-editor, however you will need to install it first.\nPersonally I prefer to leave compiz and it's plugins alone and run with the defaults - I've spent too much time fixing a broken system.\nAnother solution that seems to suggest itself is to disable the place plugin completely, however this may prove to be even more annoying since all of the automatic window placment we take for granted will be missing.  New windows will always open at 0,0 for example, probably being put under the launcher and top panel.\nIf I want a windowed application to be on the screen at the same time as another application it's a fairly simple matter to resize the windows and place them appropriately.

You could (for example) run whatever you wanted to run via ssh, but as a script.\nAnother option would be to setup a reverse SSH tunnel via that script system.\nSo you could create a script to run on the landscape managed host which ssh'ed back to your home machine or some other publicly accessible IP:-\nssh -R2222:localhost:22 username@homeserver.example.com\n\nYou'd need an ssh key to already be generated without a pass-phrase on the remote machine and place the public part on 'homeserver' in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys as a pre-requisite to doing this.\nOnce that ssh tunnel is setup, you should be able to (on homeserver.example.com):-\nssh -P 2222 username@localhost \n\nThis will redirect ssh (on port 2222) from homeserver.example.com to port 22 on the remote host. \n\nA: You currently cannot use Landscape as a remote console proxy, but it is one of the most-requested features, so it is in active consideration.

See the manpage for tree for all options.\n\nA: You can do this on command line, using the -R switch (recursive) and then piping the output to a file thus:\nls -R > filename1\n\nthis will make a file called filename1 in the current directory, containing a full directory listing of the current directory and all of the sub-directories under it.\nYou can list directories other than the current one by specifying the full path eg:\nls -R /var > filename2\n\nwill list everything in and under /var and put the results in a file in the current directory called filename2.  This works on directories owned by another user including root as long as you have read access for the directories.\nYou can also list directories you don't have access to such as /root with the use of the sudo command.  eg:\nsudo ls -R /root > filename3\n\nWould list everything in /root, putting the results in a file called filename3 in the current directory.  Since most Ubuntu systems have nothing in this directory filename3 will not contain anything, but it would work if it did.\n\nA: Also:\ngvfs-tree /path/to/folder/\n\nwill give you the same as tree using other characters for the lines.\ntree -a\n\nto display hidden files too\ntree -i\n\nto not display lines\n\nA: Just use the find command with the directory name.

Is it necessary? What if I delete it?\n\nA: It's a BIOS and hardware limitation, not an operating system one.  You can only have four primary partitions on any physical hard drive.\nThe solution is to delete one of the primary partitions and make an extended partition in its place.  You can then have as many logical partitions inside the extended partition as you want.\nYou can do all of this with a good partition editor such as Gparted.  Don't forget to backup the data on the partition before you delete it - it won't be there after you hit the delete button!\n\nA: In Windows, if you make 4th partition using Disk Management, it is automatically selected to be Logical Partition (Extended Partition). But you cannot convert a partition from Primary to Logical, neither you can choose which type of partition you want to create.\nIf you want to select the partition type by yourself, you can refer to this article: http://www.partition-magic-windows7.com/res/create-partition-windows7.html.

First of all is the GRUB essential to have Ubuntu? \nIf yes, where can I learn it's commands?  It makes me dead when it stops booting Linux and displays dangerous prompts.\nAnd is there any good Graphical UI for grub?\n\nA: \nis the GRUB essential to have Ubuntu?\n\nGRUB is the boot loader (and Ubuntu loader) program which loads Ubuntu from the disk to the Memory to be run. So, yes, Such a program is essential to have Ubuntu and it is Grub by default. But there are other bootloader too, such as LILO (LInux LOader) and recent BURG.\nGrub is only essential to boot Ubuntu, not for Ubuntu users to learn. But You might want to know some of the basics of Grub for odd situations.\nTo learn Grub, You can use the Grub manual here : manpage for the grub command  \nI recommend you to read the GNU info pages, those are very extensive and helpful. To view it, write info grub in a terminal.\nThere is a graphical front-end for Grub, called Grub-customizer. It is on a PPA. To install it, execute these commands one by one in a terminal:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:danielrichter2007/grub-customizer\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install grub-customizer\n\nYou may be asking this question for knowledge about repairing grub. To simplify your task, there is a boot-repair program which is very handy.\nTo install it, Use these commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair && sudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair\n\nAlso take a look at this page for a general introduction to boot repair: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair\n\nA: \nGRUB 2 is the default boot loader and manager for Ubuntu since version\n  9.10 (Karmic Koala). As the computer starts, GRUB 2 either presents a menu and awaits user input or automatically transfers control to an\n  operating system kernel. GRUB 2 is a descendant of GRUB (GRand Unified\n  Bootloader). It has been completely rewritten to provide the user\n  significantly increased flexibility and performance. GRUB 2 is Free\n  Software.\nIn this guide, GRUB 2 is version 1.98 or later. GRUB legacy (version\n  0.97) will be referred to as GRUB. To determine your version, use grub-install -v. Grub version 1.99 became the default on Ubuntu 11.04\n  (Natty Narwhal) and introduced some major changes in the Grub file\n  contents. This guide covers the use of Grub 1.98, the Grub release\n  found in Ubuntu 10.04 LTS (Lucid Lynx). and Grub 1.99, packaged with\n  Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (Precise Pangolin). Content reflecting other versions\n  of Grub 2 will be noted in the appropriate entry.1\n\nOther resources:\nGNU GRUB Manual 0.97\nGRUB - COMMAND LIST\nGRUB bootloader - Full tutorial \n1Source:Grub2\n", "Q: Password protect individual apps Can I give certain applications their own rights, e.g. passwords, different from root password?\nThe reason I want to do this is, apps like compiz, settings manager, that don't need root access. This creates a problem when I show others Ubuntu or let them use it. They may think playing something like this is fine, as it looks like it just changes some effect but the reality is it could break Ubuntu if misused.\nI would like others to just use my profile but apps like this make it a risk.\nSo is this possible?\n\nA: You can prevent users from editing application configuration files, if you transfer their ownership to another user, e. g.\nsudo chown -R root:lusername ~lusername/.config/compiz-1\nsudo chmod -R go-w,g+rX ~lusername/.config/compiz-1\n\n\nA: In general it's possible, but not in the way you want to go about it.\nSee, when you run an app, it runs under your user id.  So you can certainly set it up so that compiz runs under a different user, but then it wouldn't be running within your user's session and thus couldn't manage your users windows which would defeat the purpose of having compiz.\nYou can certainly create different users and make those users \"own\" specific applications and make it so only that user could run them.  But it would require a huge amount of effort to do that with the built in Ubuntu apps and most of them need to run within your users session to work properly which means they won't work if they are running under a separate id.\nThe best way to solve your particular problem is to set up a separate user id with no admin rights just for your demonstration purposes.  Then the worst they can do is break that particular users profile.  You can also copy profiles so if it gets hosed you can just delete it and copy your template profile back in.\n\nA: Not very quick for a casual demo but I think the best you can do is to create new users for them (or maybe only 1 other user for all) and configure limited sudo rights with visudo. See sudoers\nObs: changing the user or rights on specifics aplications will probably create a lot of problems for you and won't protect them against root and if you want to allow installation, your users need root rights (sudo).\n", "Q: Hiding the Launcher sidebar of Ubuntu Unity with CompizConfig I am using CompizConfig to hide the Launcher at the side of Ubuntu Unity's home screen. So I followed a tutorial, I went to Ubuntu Unity plugin, and I set the Hide Launcher to autohide, but it still appearing and I can't get rid of it. Anybody has an idea of how to fix this ?\n\nA: This apparently got broken in Unity when they removed the launcher dodge feature.  The correct way to set the launcher to auto-hide is to open system settings, select \"appearance\", then open the \"behaviour\" tab, then turn the autohide feature on.  You don't need CompizConfig and in fact it's possible to break Unity with it.\nTo reveal the launcher you will need to push the pointer against the left side of the screen.  This is speed and time dependent but you can adjust the sensitivity of the reveal a little bit.\n", "Q: Unable to compile ndiswrapper module I installed ubuntu 12.04 LTS server on an old PC.\nThis PC has a wireless card (Netgear wg311v3).\nThis computer now has no access to Internet so whatever I do I transfer it from another PC.\nI tried to install a driver for Windows with the help of ndiswrapper but with no success.\nWhat I did is that I downloaded the source file of ndiswrapper from here and tried to compile it as instructed from here.\nSo I run the command make (from within the directory /usr/src/ndiswrapeer-1.57) and the output is this:\nmake -C utils\nmake[1]:Entering directory '/usr/src/ndiswrapper-1.57/utils'\nmake[1]:Nothing to be done for 'all'\n…\nMakefile:36: *** Cannot find kernel version in /lib/modules/3.2.0-29-generic-pae/build, is it configured?. Stop.\nmake: *** [driver] Error 2\n\nDoes anyone know why it throws error?\n\nA: This message usually indicates that you're missing the kernel headers. When you compile a third-party kernel module, you need some source files from the kernel and a few additional files that depend on the kernel compile-time configuration and are generated when the kernel is compiled. These files are called “kernel headers”, and most Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, ship them in a separate package. You need the right kernel header package for your kernel version; given the error message, that would be linux-headers-3.2.0-29-generic-pae .\nNote that there is already an ndiswrapper package in Ubuntu, you probably don't need to compile it manually. It comes in several pieces: \nndiswrapper-dkms  (module sources, packaged for automatic compilation on your system),\nndiswrapper-utils  (user-space utilities),\nndisgtk  (optional: a GUI frontend),\nndiswrapper-common  (dependency of other packages). Make sure you get all the dependencies.\n", "Q: How to reset Shotwell to its original state Is there a way to give shotwell a factory reset without deleting any of the original photos. \nI made a big mess of importing the wrong library followed by the right library and now have 30,000 photos a lot of which are duplicate and rather than sifting through them all I would have thought it easier to start again. \nReinstalling shotwell does not work. Emptying the photos to the trash deletes the original file. Anything else I can do? Thanks\nI am using 12.04.\n\nA: The best thing to do is to rename the .shotwell folder in your home folder, as that contains all the thumbnails and library information. Simply rename the current .shotwell to .shotwell.backup and then load up shotwell. It will regenerate a new .shotwell folder and you will be able to start again, and you will also still have the old dot folder if there is anything in there that you want. (Make sure you click the option to enable hidden files in your file browser). \nThe reason why uninstalling a program and then installing it again sometimes doesn't clear up any problems properly is because the dot files of that program in your home folder are not removed. Therefore the new installation will still be using those files; purging a program only removes configuration files in the system folders.\nNote: From Shotwell 0.13 (the default version in Ubuntu 12.10), the photo database file is in ~/.local/share/shotwell/data and the actual photo thumbnails are in ~/.cache/shotwell.\n\nA: And to make sure that Shotwell exports from the right folder only, set your desired folder in '>Edit>Preferences>Library Location' BEFORE you rename or delete the .shotwell folder.\nShotwell starts exporting media as soon as it's launched so there's no time to select your location but upon restarting, it remembers the last set one.\n", "Q: How can I add a bookmark in my nautilus folder explorer In Ubuntu 11 I just dragged the folder there.

And this is the visual approach. CTRL+D does work but...\nI normally drag the folder into the explorer menu on the left.\nHowever this was not possible specifically with the root folder.\nSo I had to find the solution to the problem above, which was very simple once I found it.\nNavigate to ROOT and then use the middle button (with plus symbol, above 100%) in this picture to create the bookmark, this would add the current folder to the left-hand folder explorer.\n\n\nA: It's very easy just press Ctrl + B and then edit the directory!\n\nA: What you can do is to edit bookmarks by pressing Ctrl+B and change the url of a bookmark that already exists (and if you want you can change the name too). Then the new one that you wrote will appear and the one that you \"replace\" will be created by ubuntu again. I think that this is an error too but you can fix your problem\n\nA: Once you add your first bookmark using Ctrl+D, bookmarks will appear on the Nautilus tab and you will be able to use drag and drop.

The same happens on two different pairs of monitors: at the office and at home.\nHow can I fix this?\nUbuntu 12.04 x64 Desktop with default Unity GUI.\n\nA: I had the same issue ever since I bought two external monitors for my System76 laptop. A System76 representative in the Ubuntu Forums said the laptop supports dual external screens, but not all three at the same time (third being the laptop's display). I finally resolved the issue by forcing Xorg to \"ignore\" the laptop screen.\nYou'll need to create an xorg.conf file using these instructions: https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/How_to_create_xorg.conf. Move it to /etc/X11/xorg.conf. Open a terminal, run xrandr and look at what your device names are. Mine were LVSD1, HDMI1 and VGA1. In xorg.conf, make the following changes:\nIn Section \"Device\", add an option line for each output device from xrandr. Mine are:\nOption \"Monitor-LVDS1\" \"MonitorLaptop\"\nOption \"Monitor-HDMI1\" \"MonitorHDMI\"\nOption \"Monitor-VGA1\" \"MonitorVGA\"\n\nThe left side is \"Monitor-\" then the name from xrandr. The right side is what we refer to it as in xorg.conf.\nNext, make sure you have 3 monitor sections. Configure them like this:\nSection \"Monitor\"\n    Identifier      \"MonitorLaptop\"\n    Option          \"Ignore\" \"true\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Monitor\"\n    Identifier      \"MonitorHDMI\"\n    Option          \"Enable\" \"true\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Monitor\"\n    Identifier      \"MonitorVGA\"\n    Option          \"Enable\" \"true\"\nEndSection\n\nAnd two screen sections like this:\nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier \"Screen0\"\n    Device     \"Card0\"\n    Monitor    \"MonitorHDMI\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier \"Screen1\"\n    Device     \"Card0\"\n    Monitor    \"MonitorVGA\"\nEndSection\n\nAnd finally, in the ServerLayout section, you should have two Screen settings:\nScreen         \"Screen0\"\nScreen         \"Screen1\" RightOf \"Screen0\"\n\nReboot and cross your fingers :D\nNote that this configuration will also disable your laptop screen even if no other monitors are plugged in, so in that situation you'll need to boot into recovery mode (hold right shift while booting), rename your xorg.conf to something else and reboot again.\n", "Q: Grub Customizer doesn't change image background I use  the latest version of Grub Customizer (3.0.2) and Ubuntu 12.04.

There will be a window like below while installation and there'll be plenty of other options in your case and I guess you'll be able to choose to remove Windows and install Ubuntu.\n\nIf not, you'll have to manually select the partition containing Windows and install Ubuntu on it.\n\nA: You can\n\n\n*\n\n*install Ubuntu alongside Windows,\n\n*boot Ubuntu,\n\n*mount the Windows partitions in Ubuntu and\n\n*remove everything that you don't want to keep, e. g. everything but the Users directory.\n\n", "Q: Can't boot Windows 7 after installling 12.04 on HP 6735s laptop I installed 12.04 through a USB drive and when it's done I can't load Windows 7 (Loader)(on/dev/sda1) in GRUB. When I select that, it displays a black screen and then returns to GRUB but I'm still able to boot into 12.04.\nHelp me to solve this, I installed boot-repair, I checked and reinstalled Grub in the main option tab and checked place boot flag on sda1 Windows7 in other options tab , rebooted and it wasn't working.\nThis is the boot info summary: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1206875/.\nI also tried\nsudo grub-install \"(hd0)\"\nsudo update-grub\n\nin the terminal and it gave me \nfound Windows 7 (loader) on /dev/sda1 \n\nand rebooted but I still wasn't able to boot into Windows 7. This is my boot info summary after I typed those two commands: http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/1206955/\nPlease help me, I'm at wits end.\n\nA: You've installed grub2 into the MBR of /dev/sda1 - the Windows boot partition according to the first bootinfo summary.  It's not necessary to do this, and I'm not too sure what it will do to Windows.  I'm also not sure how to repair it - you might try one of the Windows support sites and see what they say.\nIf you resized the Windows boot partition during the install it's a very good idea to run chkdsk and defrag on the NTFS partition before you proceed.  This ensures that the resize operation is done quickly and with the least chance of corrupting the Windows install.\nAt this point you should back up all the data on the Windows partition because if it's not possible to repair it, you will need to re-install.  (and if you resized the partition, it should be backed up anyway - resizing is a risky operation at the best of times).\n/dev/sda4 appears to contain the Windows recovery partition.  Under no circumstances modify this partition if you don't have the installation disks.  Consult the system manual on re-installing Windows from this partition.\nIf you run the Windows installer after installing Ubuntu, it will overwrite the grub bootloader with the Windows MBR (Master Boot Record). What you need to do is boot the LiveCD and chroot into the Ubuntu system, then re-install grub2\nFrom looking at the bootinfo it appears that the Ubuntu / partition is /dev/sda6\nFor the purposes of these instructions I'm going to write /dev/sdX from now, to prevent new users blindly typing these commands.  You will need to replace /dev/sdX with your Linux partition.\nFirstly, boot the LiveCD and in a terminal window mount the Ubuntu root partition:\n sudo mount /dev/sdaX /mnt\n\nNext, export the LiveCD filesystem to the root filesystem on the drive:\n sudo mount ‐‐bind /dev /mnt/dev\n sudo mount ‐‐bind /proc /mnt/proc\n sudo mount ‐‐bind /sys /mnt/sys\n\nNow change the root filesystem to the hard disk:\n sudo chroot /mnt\n\nNow re-install grub2 to /dev/sda\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda\n\nAt this point you could reboot and it should allow you to boot into Ubuntu, however if Windows was installed after Ubuntu then it won't know about the Windows OS yet.  To fix this run update-grub:\nsudo update-grub\n\nand it will find all OS's on your system and add them to the grub menu.  You can now reboot:\nsudo reboot\n\n", "Q: MLDonkey 3.1.0 does not work in ubuntu 12.04 When I run mlnet, it gives:\nAttention!\nThis core is running with glibc 2.15 but it was compiled with glibc 2.13.\nThis can lead to unexpected behaviour.

You can compile and install the package again to solve this problem.\nsudo apt install debian-keyring dpkg-dev\nsudo apt-get build-dep mldonkey-server\napt-get source --compile mldonkey-server\nsudo dpkg -i mldonkey-<Tab>.deb\n\nThe first line is needed to check package signatures and uncompress source packages. The second line installs compilers and headers to compile mldonkey. The third line downloads the source and creates the package.

I've gone through both proprietary Nvidia driver options for my card (GeForce 9800GT) as well as the open source drivers in 12.04 to no avail.\nI can't figure out what could have caused this change in both versions of Ubuntu and Grub simultaneously. Windows 7 is unaffected so I think that safely rules out hardware failure.\nEDIT\nOk, so I couldn't boot an graphical live disks, I tried ubuntu 12.04 i386 and x64 as well as 12.10 beta x64 and all of them would flash the initial logo, go to a blank screen with a flashing cursor in the upper left and then my display would die. \nI managed to boot 12.04 server and get into recovery. I reinstalled grub and went into recovery mode for my 12.04 build. If I boot in safe graphics mode I can get 1280x768, but as soon as I reboot it's broken again. \nI've tried reinstalling the nvidia drivers and that leaves me with a system stuck at max 640x480. None of these changes have had any impact on the 11.10 build, which is still stuck at 640x480\nGiven that I can push a somewhat higher resolution in 12.04, and full resolution in windows 7 I'm pretty convinced it's not an issue of my monitor failing. It must be something to do with the graphics drivers. I can't figure out what could be the issue though. I'm especially perplexed that I can't boot any live images\n\nA: This fixed it for me. The issue was with ubuntu not liking the EDID information it got from my monitor. Apparently windows just ignores that stuff, which is why it worked there.\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1628678\n", "Q: How can I update Unity to 5.16?

After some time I rebooted the machine. To my dismay the machine would no longer start (Powers on but but no bios start up screen, I can hear initial hard drive spin which soon dies). \nThis is a new machine (less than 2 months) and I have had no previous indications of defects before this incident. In other words, I am convinced the Ubuntu install had something to do with the failure of the machine. \nHas anyone else had this problem with this model machine? Is this known to happen with precise or other versions of Ubuntu?\n\nA: There is no solution to this problem for a Samsung 700Z. Basically don't install Ubuntu on this machine. If you do you risk the install hanging and leaving your machine in a broken state. You will have to open your machine to remove the DVD and battery (voiding you warranty) or sending it in for repair. IMHO Ubuntu should have a \"install at your own risk\" warning clearly posted somewhere on their site.  \n", "Q: How to find existing files in other OS through Ubuntu in a dual-boot system? I installed Ubuntu alongside of Windows Vista to try it out. I can't get the wireless to work. Firmware missing error.\nSecondly, how do I find my files that exists in Vista through Ubuntu?\n\nA: You're asking two completely independent questions here.\n\nAbout the 'Firmware missing error.':\n\n\n*\n\n*Get your pc connected to the internet using a wired connection, then\n\n*enable universe and multiverse repositories in 'Software Sources', then\n\n*install linux-firmware and linux-firmware-nonfree packages and finally\n\n*reboot.\n\n\nThat will probably provide the kernel module the firmware it is looking for.\n\nAbout accessing files on a Windows (NTFS) partition, see the Ubuntu Community Wiki article MountingWindowsPartitions. That will work if you installed Ubuntu on a separate partition. In case you're in a Wubi installation, just navigate to the /host directory.\n\nA: I am doing the same as you. What I did is connect the laptop to an Ethernet cable and then go to drivers and update. This should resolve that problem. As for the other one I'm not actually sure you can do that since it's partitioned. Maybe just use a usb stick drive and transfer the files.\n\nA: You can connect the computer via ethernet  as user86977 said, and then search for a program called Additional Drivers. Then, open  and activate the driver you need. \nAs for the second part, open the File Manager by opening Home Folder on the launcher dock to the left, then at the left side of the window, there will be a drive icon that says something like [###]GB File System or the name of the drive. If it is Vista, it will contain some folders:\n\n\n*\n\n*Program Files\n\n*Users\n\n*WINDOWS\n\n\nas well as some more. Your files will be found somewhere in Users>[your user name]>My Documents or something else nearby. You can then drag and drop to your Home folder.\nBold text refers to names of programs or other text you should look for.\n\nA: For the first question: open the Dash and search for Additional Drivers. In that window, you can search for your wireless driver.\nFor the second one, you can mount the Vista's NTFS partition as other users said above, or you can create a new FAT32 partition using GParted or, if you have, any partitioning tool for Windows. Then, you could put whatever you want on that partition, and access it from Windows or Linux.\nThe FAT32 partition method is what I use, I preffer it because then I have all my files more organized.\nI hope you can solve it soon and tell us! \n", "Q: Default App for opening videos is SMPlayer, then why videos are being opened in Movie Player? I prefer smplayer over the movie-player to view videos on my 12.04.1. So I have set the default application for opening the videos as 'smplayer' under \"Default Applications>>Video\" . \nBut the change in the settings doesn't seem to help as searching for the video from unity plays it in Movie Player (previous default for video files).\nIs there any step that I am missing?\n\nA: I believe Ubuntu 12.04 currently does not follow the global defaults set under System Settings->Details->Default applications.\nWhat you can do is go to that video's location in the File Manager, right click, then select Properties, go to the Open with tab, select the application you want (in your case that would be SMPlayer), the click Set as default.\nNote that you will have to do this for every extension, if you do this for a .flv file, all .flv files will open in SMPlayer, same for .mp4, .wmv, and others.\n\nA: An easier solution would be to replace the bindings in the /etc/gnome/defaults.list for all the lines that start with \"video\". \nThe lines are of the form video/format = application.desktop. To open a 3gpp video with  vlc, the line:\nvideo/3gpp = totem.desktop --> video/3gpp=vlc.desktop.\n\n", "Q: Bind9 problems with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS I am having a problem with installing bind9 on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.

My LAMP is setup to work as user:www-data and all files and folders are created with that permissions.\nI have setup for crontab as user@ubuntu. \nSo i do crontab -e and use this command:  \n*/5 * * * * php /var/www/public/voto_m/artisan top >/dev/null 2>&1\n\nBasically that command just creates cache file in specified place (no problems with that), but that cache file is created with user:user permissions not user:www-data permissions.\nHow can i make that it will by default create file with user:www-data permissions?\nI can't go and chown each time file is recreated.\nThanks.\n\nA: To run a crontab as user www-data you can use the following command:\ncrontab -u www-data -e\n\nThen you write a line, for example to run a php file every 15 minutes:\n*/15  *  *  *  * php -f /path_to_cron/cron.php\n\nWhen saving it, you will be asked by the editor:\nFile Name to Write: /tmp/crontab.HMpG7V \n\nSave it there, no worries. crontab -e opens a file in /tmp instead of the actual crontab so that it can check your new crontab for errors and prevent you from overwriting your actual crontab with those errors. If there are no errors, then your actual crontab will be updated. If crontab -e just wrote straight to your actual crontab, then you would risk blowing away your entire crontab.\nTo verify that your cronjob runs, you can check the cron logs. typically in /var/log/cron.log or executing the following command:\ncrontab -u www-data -l\n\n\nA: You can also run crontab with the -u argument to edit a crontab for a specific user:\nsudo crontab -u www-data -e\n\n\nA: You can write your entry into the system crontab /etc/crontab, which takes an additional argument specifying the user to run as (usually root, but can be www-data).\nYour line would become:\n*/5 * * * * www-data php /var/www/public/voto_m/artisan top >/dev/null 2>&1\n\nOr you can edit the crontab of user www-data with su:\nsudo su -c \"crontab -e\" www-data -s /bin/bash\n\n\nA: I would like to add another approach. As other people mentioned, Ubuntu (16.04 here) and www-data crontab seems to be unreliable (maybe it's a security thing?).\nAnyway, in our company we like to have all cronjobs on a server easily accessible, so you don't miss anything. At the same time we don't want to run everything (anything really!) as root.\nTherefore we run \nsudo crontab -e \n\nAs you normally do, and then we specify the command as\n* * * * * /bin/su - www-data -s /bin/bash -c '/path/to/command'\n\nThis will execute /path/to/command as www-data while keeping the cronjob in root cronjobs file (and that will always run correctly). It has the nice benefit of being able to write the logfiles as root (for max security) using pipes. \nNote that we are passing our prefered shell, this could also be /bin/sh for a simpler shell (we just like full bash capabilities). Www-data doesn't have a shell specified so you will get errors without it. Normally cron runs jobs with /bin/sh only. \n\nA: Important: www-data user doesn't have permission to execute.\nSo: you need to su and add -s to run the command as www-data user with the shell.\nExample for Laravel\n    * * * * * su www-data -s /bin/bash -c \"/path_your_project/artisan schedule:run\"\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04.1 dual boot - boots directly to Windows 7 I wanted to install Ubuntu on my computer as second OS.

As I said I'm very new so please take it slow :)\n\nA: First of all, you can see the permission of /var/www has,  by this command ls -l /var/www.

By default, when you installed for first time, ownership status is www-data www-data. The thing that you should do, add your username belongs to www-data group by this command:\nsudo adduser yourusername www-data\n\nAfter that, you should change the ownership to your username:\nsudo chown yourusername:www-data -R /var/www\n\nIt will result in:\ndrwxr--r--  7 yourusername www-data  4096 Jun 21 10:53 CodeIgniter\ndrwxr--r-- 11 yourusername www-data  4096 Oct  2 19:49 eAdministration\n\nThen, you should change permission to 755 (rwxr-xr-x) for directories, 644 (rw-r--r--) for files, and I do not recommend to change permission to 777 (rwxrwxrwx). As suggestion from temoto to make easier to be understand, you can do this:\nsudo find /var/www -type d -print0 | sudo xargs -0 chmod u=rwX,go=rX\nsudo find /var/www -type d -print0 | sudo xargs -0 chmod u=rw,go=r\n\nOR\nsudo find /var/www -type d -print0 | sudo xargs -0 chmod 0755\nsudo find /var/www -type f -print0 | sudo xargs -0 chmod 0644\n\nTo ensure that setting has been running well, you can try php code in /var/www.\n\nA: First of all, had you install a server as lampp? Is you did, the files sould be at some place as /opt/lampp/htdocs. \nAssuming that the htdocs directory is on /var/www, you could change the permissions like this (in a Terminal, open it by searching Terminal on the Dash): \nsudo chmod -R 777 /var/www\nsudo chown -R **yourusername** /var/www\n\nYou must change yourusername with the username you entered in the installing process.\nI hope it works

Now Ubuntu One is messing with my time stamps, and I no longer know when I last worked on the file.  Ubuntu One also seem to mess up time stamps on the original source host.\nThis really is a show stopper, and we are just about to implement Ubuntu One across the many users in the organization.\n\nA: According to FAQ of Ubuntu One, you can't, because Ubuntu One does not sync metadata about files.\n", "Q: CPU Frequency is off I'm working on overclocking my rig right now, but I need to know the cpu frequency from within Ubuntu. I've figured out that I have to run a stress test while preforming the following commands to get a \"accurate\" reading, but they still only record stock speed. I've tried sudo cat /proc/cpuinfo but that shows my CPU cores running at 800MHz. I've looked in System Information but both report my cores running at 2900.00MHz, when the BIOS reports my poor overclocking skills coming in at roughly 3100.00MHz.\nAfter a reboot and overclocking my CPU another 200MHz, both tools now report 3200.0MHz when my BIOS says its just above 3400.00MHz. The tools don't report the stock speed, but I doubt \nthey're reporting the real speed, they're about 200MHz low.\nWhat am I doing wrong, why are these tools only reporting my stock settings?\n\nA: Incidentally, you can see the available CPU frequencies using:\ncat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_available_frequencies\n\n..the maximum frequencies using:\ncat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/cpuinfo_max_freq\n\nand the current CPU frequencies using:\ncat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/cpuinfo_cur_freq\n\n\nA: Try i7z http://code.google.com/p/i7z/ if you are using an Intel i3, i5, or i7 CPU.  It shows the actual current CPU frequency, even if you have overclocked it using the BIOS. \nAs you mention in your question, to see the overclocked speed you'll have to run a job that pushes at least one core, or you'll only see a much lower idle frequency in i7z. \n\nA: Looking under BIOS settings, I disabled all CPU \"extras\", and I was rewarded with the right frequency. I then enabled everything one by one until I found the culprit - AMD PowerNow feature. Disabling it fixed my frequency issue.\n", "Q: How do I install Ubuntu on a Sony Vaio SVT1311?

I recently found out about the appAPTonCD and became hugely excited!  It could take the packages of my choice in my precise desktop and pack them all in one cd, like my \"essentials\" installation media. I installed this app and placed my favorite packages into a cd.  \nNext, I wanted to insert the cd on my laptop running Ubuntu quantal daily build. I navigated to the APTonCd page on the software center, and to my dismay, I realized that it was incompatible with quantal. \nWhy can some apps, like this one, be incompatible in quantal? Thanks.\n\nA: You're going across releases, so there may be specific builds for that release and the app will need to be downloaded again.  You're also trying to migrate the apps to a development release, so some apps may not be available yet, either waiting for QA and approval, or waiting for patches to make them compatible.\nThere are other ways of doing this, that might ensure that you get the correct versions and that the dependencies are met correctly.  I have this one in my notes:\n\nTo make a file with all installed applications on the system:\nOn working system:\ndpgk --get-selections | grep -v deinstall > ubuntu-files\n\nTo then install the packages listed in this file:\n### Make sure the system is fully updated\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\n### Install the dselect tool (probably depracated)\nsudo apt-get install dselect\n### Give the package list to dpkg so it knows what to install\nsudo dpkg --set-selections < ubuntu-files\n### Use dselect to initiate installation (option 'I' will do it)\nsudo dselect\n\nNB: There might be a better way to do this, for example calling dpkg directly\ninstead of installing and using dselect.\nNB: Although all packages are listed only those that do not exist on the system \nwill be installed by dpkg\nNB: cross version installation not really recommended - may install obsoleted \npackages (Open Office) and unwanted themes and dependancies (eg as in upgrade\nfrom 10.04 to 11.04 with Unity\n\nAgain, as noted, cross version installation may not be ideal, but at least this way the packages will be installed fully from the correct repository.  You can still use the .deb files and restore them to /var/cache/apt/archives so that they don't have to be downloaded again, however if a newer release is required or is available it will still have to be downloaded obviously.\n", "Q: Error message using telnet I am installing postfix.

After hours of trial and error and web searches I can't get my ssh service to accept my private key!\nHere is my sshd_config.\nI generated my public and private keys using Putty in Windows then used a ssh connection to paste my key from putty directly into my authorized_keys2 file located in */etc/ssh/publickeys/authorized_keys2*\nThe authorized_keys2 file looks something like: ssh-rsa  AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAA... with no email or anything at the end of it. I just pasted it straight from PuttyGen without using a key comment.\nI feel like it's not working because of some nuance I am not understanding or some unusual setting or incompatibility. I've restarted the ssh service (and the machine) to no avail.\nWhat are some common pitfalls I might have gotten myself into? Is there a simpler way to generate ssh keys that putty can use in windows?\n\nA: I solved it. My problem was that I needed to convert the public key to OpenSSH's format. This required the use of the following command: ssh-keygen -i -f puttygen_key > openssh_key which converted my putty generated key into an openssh key which I then simply renamed to authorized_keys and boom it works.\n\nA: The above is not working for me, i copied the pub..key into my .ssh/authorized_keys  Then went to putty and still not allowed excess.

Anyone help please, ?\nThe second public key is stored on USB and as been copied to  .ssh/authorized_keys and thats me for tonight. Any help would be great people.\n\nA: You must write the content of your name_of_key.pub into your ~/.ssh/known_hosts file and that's it the workaround is similar to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install openSSH (done as you point)\n\n*Generate an rsa in the client machine to share.\n\n*Copy the content of the name_of_key.pub into the ~/.ssh/known_hosts in the server.\n\n*Enjoy fully authorized communication with the server from the client machine.\n\n\nMore on creating sshkeys with PuTTYgen here and there (note that you just need to change the step when you copy the text to the server, now the server is linux!)\nYou also can use google's Secure Shell, here you can find how to share a key-pair using it.\n", "Q: Sound Not working on reboot I have a Alienware m17xR4 and when I reboot from Windows 7 into 12.04 I have no sound.

I'm not sure whether it is the Pen drive or the Dongle..? \nCan anyone give me a good advice how to solve this problem?\n\nA: I suggest you add a volume name (label) to the partition or partitions on the USB pendrive.  This way, when you hover over the icon on the launcher it will display the volume name so you know which is the correct device.\nYou can add or change the volume name using Disk Utility.  Select the correct drive in Disk Utility, then click on the unmount button.  Next click the 'edit filesystem label' button and change the name to something meaningful to you.  You can now mount the device again with the mount button and it will appear in the launcher with the correct label when you hover over it.\n\nThis is Disk Utility with the pendrive selected in the left frame.  To the right of this you can unmount the device and then change the label, then remount it again.  The pendrive in this example now has the label \"white8\" and its mount point is /media/white8\n\nNow when you hover the mouse pointer over the device in the launcher it shows the label name so that you can recognise it.\n", "Q: Will the Driver Support for Intel HD Graphics be Improved in 12.10? I recently installed Ubuntu 12.04 on a HP Pavilion dv4 laptop. This is a core i7 machine with Intel HD graphics and also a separate nVidia VGA card. I had a lot of issues getting Ubuntu 12.04 working on this system. First there were issues booting up the live CD for installation. I worked around that by using the 'nomodeset' option. Then I continued to have similar issues after installation has completed. So I had to permanently add the nomodeset option to my GRUB boot configuration. At the moment I have a working installation but there are many issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu GUI is a bit flaky at times. The mouse pointer goes on and off when hovering over certain icons. Certain things doesn't get rendered properly on the screen.\n\n*I can't access any of the tty consoles. Hitting Ctrl+Alt+F[1-6] gives me a blank screen. And once that happens I can't even come back to the UI by hitting Ctrl+Alt+F7. I've realized that tty consoles are actually working. I just can't see the text. If I enter a command like 'sudo reboot' into the empty screen the machine reboots.\n\n*Can't get external displays (monitors, projectors etc) working. But I think this is probably because the VGA out is wired to the nVidia card which is not being used by Linux.\n\n*colord program crashes every now and then triggering a popup message.\nSo my main question is, will the support for Intel HD graphics be improved in the next release? Or will I have to keep using the nomodeset option in the new release too? Also I  appreciate if anybody can shed some light on any of the issues listed above.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Yes. Not sure about the specific bugs you hit, but it will be improved.\nThe Linux kernel and X.org drivers will receive quite some updates in the upcoming release. Try out some backports for the current release from the X Updates PPA (only X and graphics) or xorg-edgers PPA (bleeding edge, new 3.5 kernel, may break everything).\nAlso if you update 12.04 completely (aka 12.04.1 at this moment), support should also be better than at the time of the 12.04 release.\nI suggest the Phoronix article category \"Display Drivers\" for further readings.\n", "Q: Is it possible to create a shortcut/symbolic link to a folder in unity launcher? \nPossible Duplicate:\nIn Unity, how do I make desktop shortcuts (a la Windows, OSX)?\nHow can you access a folder you want quickly? \n\nI want to create a shortcut for a folder on unity.

Add a .desktop at the end of the file.\n\n*Copy the file to your desired location. Note, if you delete the file later, the launcher will not work. I assume you copied it in ~/.local/share/applications folder.\n\n*Then select the file and drag and drop it in the Unity launcher.\nThat's it.

When they start up, they end up with the GUI's \"HUD\" overlapping the game which is really annoying and well kills the option to play the game. This has also happened in a few of my Linux programs as well. While I wrote its a problem with Unity, it really isn't limited to this though. I've done full screen mode on Unity and had the Unity side bar and top menu overlap, I've used Gnome and had the same issue happen, Gnome menu is in the top, Cinnamon had the same issue.\nSometimes if I Alt-Tab out of it and back into the program it MIGHT remove the HUD but that doesn't always work, and lets face it, full screen mode that is killed by the GUI just isn't something that can really be ignored.\nAny suggestions or help would be highly welcomed.\nMy laptop http://www.cnet.com/laptops/asus-g53jw-a1-15/4507-3121_7-34210244.html\nedit\nSeems so far to be an issue with Unity and Gnome being in 3D mode, and possibly an issue with my NVidia card and XServe (I think that was it...). Going to Unity/Gnome 2d modes seem to help with this for the moment...\n\nA: I take it you're using the HUD to start the game, and it's not closing properly and is overlaying the full-screen game?\nTry a different method of start the game if possible, such as pinning it to the launcher and starting it that way. Perhaps this answered question may be helpful:\nHow does one create a custom application launcher for Wine installed apps?\nYou might also try running the game in a VM instead of Wine.  Oracle's VirtualBox is great and the free version is in the repositories, though you might want to get the PUEL (personal use evaluation license) version from Oracle for the USB 2.0 support and great full screen mode (looks like a Windows machine, no borders, no menus).\n", "Q: Cannot Install Ubuntu 12.04: \"Installation Type\" screen has no options I am new to Ubuntu.\nI am trying to install Ubuntu 12.04 LTS from USB key (in a dual-boot with Windows 7) and I have exactly the same problem with the blank \"Installation Type\" described here:\nUbuntu 12.04 Install Problems.. Installation Type screen. No options\nI have followed the instructions in one of the comments, and giving the command\nsudo apt-get remove dmraid\n\nseems to solve the problem allowing me to see the partition.\nHOWEVER, I have not proceeded from here since I do not understand whether having removed this \"dmraid\" will give me problems afterwards, e.g. damaging my data or Ubuntu and/or Windows installation.\nIs \"dmraid\" something essential? Do I need to reinstall \"dmraid\" afterwards? \nI would be really grateful if you could help me, I am very excited to try Ubuntu, but so far I have only had frustrations with the installation (I have also tried the Ubuntu Windows installer, getting exactly the same issue) and it took me some time to find the solution in the comments above.\n\nA: One possible root cause is that your computer uses Intel Smart Response Technology / Intel Rapid Storage Technology (ISRT / IRST), a kind of RAID. It is somehow unusual or different compared to older versions of RAID, and dmraid doesn't understand it. Looking around, I see a few approaches that people have taken..\n(1) The approach I recommend is to install mdadm, which is (according to Intel) the modern replacement of dmraid. When mdadm is available -- even if dmraid is also installed -- the ubuntu installation will use mdadm to correctly understand what the partitions are. At least it worked for me. I posted details at another question.\n(2) Another approach that many people have recommended is to turn off RAID altogether. This often involves changes in an Intel program that you run in Windows, and in BIOS. But the disc can still be left with RAID-type markings, and you have to run some commands to erase them before the disc is finally recognized as non-RAID (explanation of this part). For instructions in this method see here and here. Turning off ISRT / IRST would presumably reduce performance somewhat. On the other hand, it seems from those pages that it is possible to resurrect RAID (at least in windows) to improve the performance after installing ubuntu. But I don't know, it seems to me that this approach leaves ubuntu ignorant of RAID while windows is using it, so I doubt ubuntu will be able to access files created in windows. I could be wrong.\n(3) Finally, the approach you mention is to delete dmraid. I'm not sure exactly what happens here. Clearly it has worked for many people, although one can find old reports from people who had a bit more hassle than just that. One could also find a long time later that dmraid has reinstalled itself (as the dependency of something else), and I don't know whether that could cause problems. The most obvious problem, as before, is that it seems dangerous if windows is using ISRT but ubuntu knows nothing about RAID, yet you want ubuntu to be able to access the files created by windows. I could be wrong...\n\nA: What I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*In the ubuntu search app I searched for \"partition\"\n\n*Opened \"GParted\"\n\n*\"Device\" --> \"Create Partition\"\n\n*Choose the device \"sda\" or \"sdb\" if you have two disks non-raid on your system\n\n*Choose \"gpt\" in the form that opens and that's it.\nrepeat 4-5 for those disks you want to use for your linux installation\n\n\nat this point the table will not be empty and you can continue as you wish\n", "Q: How can I troubleshoot flash player/hardware conflict? OBJECTIVE: \nHave a web browser on my Ubuntu install that can play youtube and hulu videos.  Also would like to understand problem so that I can fix it again if I change software.  Workarounds welcome, technical understanding and solution preferable.\nSYMPTOMS: \nFlash does not run - cannot make the right-click menu appear, an empty box is where video should be, changes to black box when hovering over other links.  The \"The Adobe Flash plugin has crashed\" message does not appear with its sad lego face.\ncannot activate proprietary graphics driver - causes system to reboot to a prompt.\nSOLUTIONS TRIED: \nReplaced OS (tried slackware 13.37, fedora 17, linuxmint 13 maya, gentoo, lubuntu, and even winXP.  lubuntu confirmed to work, don't remember how much tweaking, if any, this required. Slack, fedora, mint, and gentoo all failed to run flash just like ubuntu)\nmany reinstalls of flash player via different methods, including cleaning up old installs first, also tried gnash and lightspark.\nreplaced graphics card (replaced HIS IceQ Radeon HD 4670 AGP with older GeForce 5700 LE no change in problem)\nflash does successfully work on winXP installation with Catalyst AGP hotfix driver applied, however I consider windows wholly unacceptable for web browsing due to lack of security.  Lubuntu install also works, however I do not want to be tied down to just using Lubuntu on this computer.\nSYSINFO: \nHave latest versions of Ubuntu, Firefox, and Flash on fresh Ubuntu install.  Using Gigabyte 7s748 motherboard with Athlon XP 2800+ and 3 GB of RAM with Radeon HD 4670 AGP card, also a Dell soundblaster live series sound card (due to malfunction of onboard sound on motherboard)  Wired internet connection, Maxtor 6Y120L3 HDD, Sony DVD RW AW-Q170A, Dell M993s monitor.\nNOTES: \nI do not know if the graphics driver issue and the flash troubles are linked.  Substitution of older graphics card having same flash troubles seems to suggest they aren't.  My troubleshooting method is rather reductionist, consisting mainly of \"replace things until you find out what was causing the error by process of elimination\" only it seems that this must be a conflict which arises when software decides how to configure itself on my hardware.  That is, I know the hardware can run Flash, and I know that on other systems the same software can too, but somehow the combination fails.  Consequently I feel out of my depth.  I will keep trying things off and on, but I have spent probably about 30 man-hours in the last 4 months working on this problem with no joy other than the lubuntu workaround.  Any help will be appreciated, I will be checking back and posting updates.  Any pertinent questions regarding me or my computer will be answered, outputs from config files can be accessed and posted (IDK which ones or what parts to post).\n\nA: ALRIGHTY THEN my issue is fully resolved and I'll walk us through it.  The graphics card driver is moot, unimportant, and otherwise not related.  I have no need to tinker with it at this time.\nBased on the report on the linked thread that Flash 11.2 does not work with Athlon XP 1600+, I will venture to say that it does not work with my Athlon XP 2800+.  So I downloaded Flash 10.3, and it worked.  Not satisfied to stop there, I tried Flash 11.1 and it also works.  To summarize:\nIF YOU HAVE AN ATHLON XP CPU USE FLASH 11.1!\nI confirmed that it worked on youtube and hulu and that fullscreening caused no additional problems (a while back fullscreening would make vids play choppily).  I'm new here so I don't know if I can retroactively change the topic flags to reflect the fact that it is the CPU we are concerned with, and not drivers at all - but I'll try.

Drive is faster when it is not sharing connections with kbd mouse bluetooth etc.\n\nA: It seems like the drive has mounted as a USB 1.0 device.  Is it plugged into a USB 3.0 port?\nI've seen problems with USB 3.0 that when you unmount them from the launcher they will re-mount again after several seconds.  If you then try to use the device it may run very slowly.  After investigation I found that it was because the device was remounting as a USB 1.0 device.  I can't seem to find the bug report at the moment.\nIf this is the case, remount the drive again after removing it completely from the system - physically unplug it and try again.\nIf you are using a USB 3.0 port try a USB 2.0 port.  Try different USB 2.0 ports if the problem persists.\nIt's still going to take a little while to move 80Gb, but not 11 days!\n", "Q: How do I install g77?

Hardware's been working great with 10.10 for about 2 years.\nBackground: (optional - feel free to skip to question)\nI was trying to get my component video output to generate 720p, messing around with the nvidia drivers, and now the entire display system is hosed.

I had no luck whatsoever with the 295 drivers on my GeForce 6150. You could try updating to the latest drivers though...\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current\n\nIf that doesn't work, try the updated drivers:\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current-updates\n\nIf it still doesn't work, remove both the nvidia driver modules and update the generic nouveau driver:\nsudo apt-get remove nvidia-current nvidia-current-updates\nsudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-nouveau\n\nI've found the nouveau driver pretty good, and certainly a lot more solid and reliable than the nvidia drivers on this card, as well as reasonably fast. I haven't been game to try the latest nvidia driver available now - 305 or something I think - Why fix it when it's not broken?.  Maybe when I have some spare time...\nIf you manage to get the Nividia drivers working, you might be able to set the resolutions you want using the Nvidia settings tool:\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-settings\nThis tool takes over from the generic display settings in Ubuntu, and knows more about the card capabilities.\nI note that some of the older drivers have been put back into the repository.

Add a line like this:\n@daily df -h | mail -s ...\n\nSave and close.\nThis will make it run with the other daily tasks. If you need a report on a specific time of the day or error logging to a specific address, please read about the cron syntax (a lot of this is on the Internet - here's one random website). For example:\nMAILTO=myerroraddress@domain.tld\n# at 5 a.m every day:\n0 5 * * * mycommand\n\nIn case you can't send out mail on that machine directly, read this or the answer by @hakermania on how to do that (many more ways exist).\n\nA: You can use this script to check the disk usage\n#!/bin/bash\n\nlimit=85\nemail=you@domain.com\nhost=`hostname`\nout=`df -k | grep \"^/dev\" | awk '{ if($5 > $limit) print \"\\nDisk space is critial on \" $1,$5,$6 \"\\n\"}'`\nusr/bin/mail -s \"Disk Space Alert on $host: $out\" $email\n\nUse cron to make the script run automatically.

I was finally able to make it work by following the instructions found here:\nhttp://linuxwireless.org/en/users/Drivers/b43#supported\nHowever, each time I log on to the computer I have to go to the terminal and type\nsudo modprobe b43\nto make the wireless work. Is there somehow I can avoid this?\nI have used Ubuntu for many years but always relied on other people to help me with the technical stuff. The terminal is alien to me so I literally follow online forum instructions without knowing what I'm doing. Also, I tried many many things before I managed to make it work. So I'm worried I may have installed something that now conflicts with whatever the sudo modprobe b43 does.\nThank you\n\nA: Add b43 in a line to the /etc/modules file. It will load the module at boot time.\nAlternatively, You can add b43 in /etc/initramfs-tools/modules and then use sudo update-initramfs -u to load the module automatically.\n", "Q: How To Capture Video How to capture an online video stream and edit (convert into other formats, make a clip, etc.) it in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS?\n\nA: You can install some Firefox or Chrome plugin for doing that, such as Video Download Helper. \nOr, for Youtube an other popular websites, you can use KeepVid, wich works on the browser.\nFor the second question, I suggest you to create a new one. I hope it works to you!\n\nA: To convert videos into different format, handbrake is a handy tool.\n\nA: I found \"All video downloader\" from the ubuntu software center(12.04 lts Precise Pangolin) a good program which has the following PROS:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can download from a host of sites such as youtube, DM, Vimeo, etc.\n\n*Easy to use with a good UI.\n\n*Has  batch mode where you can copy-paste many video URLS  and will download one at a time.\n\n*Supports down load in many formats (FLV, MP4, MP4-HD,  etc) but always first downloads in flv first and then converts it to whatever format you had selected.\n\n\nCONS :\n\n\n*\n\n*A bit slower( compared to the ones I have in windows), if you want to download in any format other than FLV.\n\n\nA: Try ClipGrab. ClipGrab is a free downloader and converter for YouTube, Vimeo, Dailymotion and many other online video sites.\n\nA: Try Keepvid downloader which is free and safe to use. I used to get loads of videos from web via this tool. Though it sometimes may not handle some clips which depend on the situations.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 fails to recognise my blu-ray drive This blu-ray drive was working fine in Windows (before Windows became corrupted and I used the opportunity to move to Linux).

If not, try it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on the Dash\n\n*Search for Additional and click Additional Drivers\n\n*Wait a bit, and you'll see a list with all the compatible drivers for your computer. You can install your graphics card drivers (I usually install the post-release drivers) and all your other devices.\n\n*Check if your drive name appears at that list, select the entry for it and click Activate. After a while, you'll have to restart your computer.\n\n\nIf you have installed the drivers yet, or there are no avaliable drivers for it, maybe the device isn't compatible with ubuntu's kernel.\nI hope it works to you!\n", "Q: Missing /lib/libc.so.6 Software that I'm installing requires /lib/libc.so.6, but it's not in place:\n$> ls -l /lib/libc*\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root      14 2011-10-09 06:02 /lib/libcap.so.2 -> libcap.so.2.20\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   18832 2011-02-16 03:42 /lib/libcap.so.2.20\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1620736 2012-05-23 07:19 /lib/libcrypto.so.0.9.8\n\nlibc and libc6-dev are installed.

And this account would be used via SSH for file sharing on the network. How do I get started?\n\nA: File transfer (and sharing) over SSH is done using the sftp protocol usually.\nAnd you can set up OpenSSH to chroot to the user's directory while forcing sftp (no command line allowed) like explained in this how-to.\n\nA: Just create a normal user, and set it's home dir to the desired folder:\nuseradd -d /share username\n\nIf you explicitly do not add this user to sudoer's list, or any special groups, then it will be limited by default. For security purposes you might want even to chroot that user.\n", "Q: How to check battery status when acpi is off? I got acpi turned off with the kernel parameter acpi=off. But now I cannot see my battery state in any way. Is there a way to check battery state when acpi is still off?\n\nA: You can't. ACPI provides the Power Interface to your OS.\nIf you disable that you will lose a lot more power related functionality like suspend. There may be other interfaces to hardware controllers for batteries without relying on ACPI, but I don't know of them.\nI recommend not to disable ACPI but try to solve your problem. On a laptop (I assume you are) you really can't work normally without ACPI support.

I wondered if it was possible to use the Ubuntu font in the terminal. I know how to change the font, but using anything except a monospace font doesn't really work very well. Is there a way to use a non-monospace font where it looks ok?\n\nA: Is it possible? Yes.\n(However, not for Konsole - it prevents you to select non-monospaced fonts.)\nDoes it work well? No. Output formatting is relying on a monospaced font to make it look as designed (tabular output for example).\n", "Q: How can I uninstall Nvidia proprietary drivers? OK, so I know that other people asked exactly the same... but I just moved from Nouveau to Nvidia using this tutorial, and the new drivers are really, really, really slow.

Please help me out.\n\nA: I have a Lenovo v570 and I had the same problem. Perhaps what worked for me will work for you.\nTry this: sudo rmmod -f acer-wmi\nOnce that's done your wifi should just kick on, if that is the cause of the problem. If that does work, you can make that permanent by creating a blacklist for it:\nsudo touch /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-custom.conf\nThen use nano or vi/vim to open the file /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-custom.conf and write this line to that file: blacklist acer-wmi.

Installing the proprietary fglrx driver via the OS interface caused errors and problems. \nSo I opted for a manual installation. I downloaded the correct driver for 64 bit from AMD: amd-driver-installer-12.6-legacy-x86.x86_64.zip . This is the latest version to support the HD3200. \nI enabled the restricted repositories and created the installation package. The manual installation worked without error messages, testing with fglrxinfo and fgl_glxgears works, everything is fast now. \nMy problem, however, is that after the first reboot, the whole screen is shifted about an inch to the left, so that I  cannot see what is at the left margin of the screen. I could probably correct this via my monitor settings, but then I would have to change it back everytime I booted to Windows.\nFor the xorg.conf configuration I just used the recommendation I found on a Ubuntu helpsite: \nsudo amdconfig --initial -f\n\nI then changed my graphics card name in the Device Section.\nStill the same screen problem.\nThe \"monitor\" section in the original xorg.conf file reads like this:\nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier \"aticonfig-Screen[0]-0\"\n    Device     \"aticonfig-Device[0]-0\"\n    Monitor    \"aticonfig-Monitor[0]-0\"\n    DefaultDepth     24\n    SubSection \"Display\"\n        Viewport   0 0\n        Depth     24\n    EndSubSection\n\nSomewhere I found an info where someone recommended these settings for the same monitor I have: HP LP2065 with 1600 x 1200.

I really would like to use the proprietary driver without having to adjust the monitor itself. Maybe I just need the correct xorg.conf settings...?\nAny ideas?\n\nA: I have a similar issue with my Radeon HD 6670 and using any of the regular,post-upgrade or from-amd.com drivers; well, actually, only the regular provided ones seem to work well enough (and I needed to wipe all old attempts properly before I reinstalled these ones for it to work, so I was just on vesa display module not even the open-source default \"radeon\" one).\nI figured out the reason was that it uses a low refresh rate, 60Hz, and the monitor image is at least an inch, maybe two, inside the edges of my 19\" monitor. When I start up amdcccle software (the Catalyst Control Center) I can fix it once logged in on Ubuntu 12.04 (\"precise\") when I click Apply button to set it to 85Hz (VGA CRT monitor, old style), and it shifts back out to fill the whole display.\nBut as soon as I reboot it the settings are forgotten and it jumps back to 60Hz. (edit: I just found it might be cos its on VGA, so no EDID: see link) I might try my own Q if Im still stuck in a day or two. If your problem is similar (check refresh rates via the monitor's on-screen-display menu in Windows then check them in Linux), then at least that determines a possible cause. You may have luck trying to set it in xorg.conf (mine doesnt help): in the Section \"Monitor\" bit if you have one, I use this line:\nOption   \"TargetRefresh\" \"85\"\n\nWhere 85 is the rate that I know works (and would be your Windows rate if it doesnt match the broken Linux refresh rate).\nOr with amdcccle program instead? My xorg.conf tries to tell it 85Hz but doesn't seem to be using that - though without an xorg.conf it doesn't work at all (I also have an in-board much older AMD gfx chip but I've disabled in bios, was Very broken with fglrx but ok with radeon driver when I didnt disable it).\n", "Q: Hard Drive not detected in ubuntu 12.04?

The installation initially works fine, and I am able to load Ubuntu several times after selecting it from the boot menu.  However, when I boot into Windows 7 it seems to corrupt the Ubuntu boot process, because after running Windows 7, Ubuntu won't boot on the machine.  It is still listed as an option in the boot menu, but when it is selected, the machine does one of the following: \n\n\n*\n\n*hangs at the load-screen and says that Ubuntu is preparing to run for the first time (although it isn't the first time the OS has been loaded)\n\n*hangs with a black screen and does nothing\nI have uninstalled Ubuntu and then reinstalled it (using Wubi) three times.  Each time Ubuntu initially boots okay (including rebooting the laptop into Ubuntu several times.)  However, whenever I switch over and boot into Windows 7 it breaks the Ubuntu installation.  Windows 7 continues to boot and work fine without issues.\nI have successfully installed Ubuntu using Wubi onto a different Windows 7 machine before without problems...it seems that there is something different about this laptop configuration. I am not sure how to debug the issue. I see no error messages during the Ubuntu boot process when it hangs and am not sure how to debug this.\nUpdated Info:\nI made some progress on this issue, but am now stuck with a broken bootloader.  I was able to get the Ubuntu installer to install version 12.04 on the system, but at the moment the boot process is not working and right at boot it hangs and says: “BOOTMGR is missing”  The most recent boot debug info I have is: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1218834.\nHere is what I did:\n1)  Turned off Intel rapid start technology in the Windows control panel on the taskbar, but leave RAID 0 setup with the Intel tech in the BIOS.  After reading into this a bit, I believe the setup on this system is fakeRAID/ software RAID/sataRAID where BIOS makes the 2 SATA drives look like RAID to the OS.  According to Intel, linux should support this (http://download.intel.com/design/intarch/PAPERS/326024.pdf) and the preferred mechanism is mdadm in linux rather than the dmraid approach which is now only in bug-support mode by the Intel people.  I want to keep this feature active to maintain a good performance of Windows 7 while also setting up a dual-boot environment.\n2)  Inside windows, using their disk management tool, I shrunk the windows partition by 30 GB to free up space for Ubuntu.\n3)  I (temporarily) disabled the Intel Rapid Start feature using the taskbar controls inside Windows 7.  I did not disable the feature in the BIOS and left the BIOS configured with sataRAID active.\n4)  It was possible to boot the computer into Ubuntu 12.04 using a LiveCD installed on a USB stick.\n5)  Next, confirm that the partitions looked the same from within Ubuntu as they did when I looked at them inside Windows 7 from the disk manager tool.\n6)  Install Gparted package and use it to configure the partitions in prep for Linux install.  Created 1 extended partition subdivided into three logical partitions (swap, root, and home)\n7)  Ran the Ubuntu installer, used the manual partition control rather than the automatic option for installing Windows 7 and Ubuntu side-by-side.\n8)  When the machine rebooted, it went straight into Windows 7 without any sort of grub2 menu.\n9)  Boot into Ubuntu from liveCD USB stick, install boot-repair and use it to try and fix the boot loader process.\n10) The boot process now starts up Ubuntu 12.04 okay, but there was no option to load Windows 7.\n11) Install boot repair and try to force it to load Windows 7 first (although, admittedly, not to clear on how best to try this.  I tried to get it to refresh the MBRs.)\n12) On reboot the computer says “BOOTMGR is missing” and hangs…no grub2 menu\nNow I’m not sure how to proceed.  I think the partitions are setup okay and I actually have Ubuntu 12.04 installed okay and Windows 7 installed okay, too, but how do I get a grub2 menu setup that will allow me to select between the two OSes?\n--Final update on Oct 25:\nSo, after a lot of pain investigating this, I gave up and installed Linux onto an external USB hard drive, thus keeping the RAID setup across the internal HDD and SSD independent of the Linux installation.  From inside Windows it was possible to configure the boot menu to give an option to boot linux off the external USB drive.\nThis RAID hardware configuration doesn't seem to be supported by the wubi installer, standard Ubuntu ISO installer/Live CD, or the alternative Ubuntu ISO installer.\nA few notes on what partly worked and didn't work:\nAfter booting into Ubuntu using the Live CD, it is possible to use 'dmraid -ay' to activate the RAID0 partitions, and it is possible to use gparted to partition them.  If the installer is then subsequently run, it is able to see the partitions and proceed with installation, however, it is unable to install the boot loader at the end, and I was not able to resolve that.  Also, fundamentally, it seemed like the dual-boot setup was unstable.\nApparently mdadm is actually preferable to dmraid for managing RAID arrays.  However, when I tried to uninstall dmraid and install mdadm, mdadm was not able to see these RAID arrays, whereas dmraid had been successful.  When I tried to get mdadm to recognize the RAID setup, it says that it doesn't support RAID0 on 1 device.  Perhaps there is something unusual about how the Intel fakeRAID is setup in this setup.\nAnyway, after wrecking the boot loader (tried using boot repair program in Ubuntu) and reinstalling Windows multiple times, this should work well enough.  (The Windows setup is my primary OS, and Linux is secondary so I don't want to take the performance penalty of disabling the fakeRAID setup.)The windows installer needs me to manually provide the HD controller drivers for it to work right, too, so I think this is a fairly new type of configuration.  Maybe a future version of the Ubuntu installer will be able to work with this kind of system.  For now running off an external drive will work okay.\nSome potentially useful links:\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installing_with_Fake_RAID#Load_dmraid\nhttp://blog.neolocus.com/2012/04/ubuntu-12-04-lts-and-soft-raid-with-mdadm/\n\nA: You must completely shutdown Windows before booting the Wubi Ubuntu.

I'm new in Ubuntu, I'm running Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS x64, and I have some songs in Arabic. Rhythmbox plays them alright but it doesn't show the album artist or the song titles in Arabic Characters.\nI tried to change the regional format to Arabic but it didnt help. In a similar situation in Windows, the solution is to change the non-unicode language to Arabic. I dont know if the solution here is the same, and if it is how to do it.\nI am liking Ubuntu very much and its a pity that I have this problem, it would be perfect for me if it can be fixed.

It resulted in ID3v1 (or 1.1) tags in windows-1256 being converted v2.3 tags in utf-8. The following caveats apply:\n\n\n*\n\n*If your tags are not Windows-1256 (for example, they're instead ISO-8859-6 or not arabic at all), the command will irrecoverably mangle them, without warning\n\n*I only tested it with one file, that had no album info, so might not work for all cases\n\n*It may or may not convert other tags, such as track number, year, genre, etc.\n\n*I don't have Windows, so no clue whether the resulting files work there\n\n\nIf it works, put the command in a file, call it \"retag.sh\", replace foo.mp3 with \"$1\" (including the quotes). Then make a copy of all relevant mp3s cp -a Music/mp3 Music/retagged-mp3 and replace with abandon: find Music/retagged-mp3 -type f -print0|xargs -0 retag.sh. Once verified that they show ok and play ok and none were lost in conversion, replace the original mp3s with retagged ones.\n(*) I tried lltag and id3v2 for reading the tags on command line, but that didn't work. puddletag, exfalso and easytag wouldn't show the tags at all, and tagtool would show them assuming ISO-8859-1 encoding.\n", "Q: How to produce MathType equations in a MS Word document under Ubuntu?

Sometimes they offer newer version of packages than there are in the normal repositories. But mostly you will use a ppa for packages that aren't in the normal repositories at all. E.g. I can't find the grub-customizer in the normal repositories. I guess thats why someone recommended that ppa to you. Important is that you have to do the add-apt-repository only once. After that the packages from that ppa are available and updated the same way as the other ones.\nEDIT\nIf you add a ppa a file is added to the folder /etc/apt/sources.list.d/. If you want to remove a ppa just delete that file (with sudo rm) and run sudo apt-get update. The packages you have installed using this ppa are not removed if you remove a ppa.\n\nA: PPA stands for Personal Package Archive. When you install a PPA to your system with the way you described above you actually tell your system to monitor a personal archive that has nothing to do with the official ubuntu sources. These PPAs can be created at the website https://launchpad.net\nPPAs are recommended many times because they may contain the latest available software for a program while this latest version isn't on the software sources. Take for example the Gimp PPA at launchpad. It contains the single window version while it isn't still available through the official sources.\nBe careful! Anybody can upload PPAs and they are completely untested! You have to be careful while you are installing PPAs because they don't necessarily contain tested software as the official sources do and may harm your computer.

How can I do this?\nPS: I have the windows 7 64 bit ready in my dvd!\n\nA: You can install Windows as you should always do, but be sure of selecting the C:\\ partition while installing (it should be tagged on the installer's partition editor with something as MASTER and should be NTFS) and formatting it for installing Windows there, but don't touch Ubuntu's partitions (swap or ext2/3/4).\nAfter installing it, you should download SuperGrub2 disk. Burn it on a CD as you'd do with a linux distribution, and boot from it. Select Detect any operating system and select the entry where Ubuntu appears.\nIt will boot Ubuntu for you, because the GRUB was erased when you installed the new Windows 7. But with this you can boot to ubuntu! So, after booting ubuntu with SuperGrub, run a Terminal and enter this command:\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda\n\n(Changing /dev/sda for the place where you want to install grub, should be the MBR). Then, restart and, without booting from the SuperGrub CD that you won't need anymore, you'll see GRUB again, and it should have the Ubuntu entry and the Windows 7 entry.\nI hope it works to you, and tell us soon!\n\nA: If you want to replace the old Windows 7 32-bit with a new Windows 7 64-bit installation, follow this procedure:\n0.

But than, encryption also doesn't make sense anymore.\nAm I right about that thoughts? Or do you still see a way to access the /home-folder of the backup user so that encryption still makes sense?\nThanks for your help in advance!\n\nA: One attack scenario that may be relevant: an account with access to sudo is compromised and subsequently used to (i) modify PAM (authentication) library, or (ii) any of the binaries backup-user-account uses, or (iii) maybe even directly observe a running process to gain knowledge of the encryption key.\nWithout sudo, I think the only remaining attack vectors are physical proximity (as you mentioned), a compromised user account + local root exploit, or a remote root exploit. If your system is sufficiently powerful, you could set up a number of virtual machines (for example Xen or KVM) for different functions, like router, web server and file server.\nIf this system is local (at your premises), you could improve the backup scheme with an external hard drive (unplug when not backing up or recovering), or two (rotate).\n", "Q: Upgraded to 12.04 now Wi-Fi doesn't work My laptop's Wi-Fi stopped working when I upgraded to Ubuntu 12.04 (wired works).

After some time I get this error.\nchecking for X... no configure: error: X development files not found.\nWine will be built without X support, which probably isn't what you\nwant. You will need to install development packages of Xlib/Xfree86 at\nthe very least. Use the --without-x option if you really want this.\n\nConfigure failed, aborting install.\n\nThe installation won't finish. Can I fix this and make Wine install ?\n\nA: I had the same problem. Do this:\nsudo apt install libx11-dev:i386\n\n\nA: Most people should either install Wine through Ubuntu's official repositories, or using the Wine project's official Wine PPA.\nHowever, if you want to build and install Wine from source, you should be able to do so.\n\n\n*\n\n*This may make sense if you want to install a later version of Wine than is provided for your Ubuntu release. However, as BuZZ-dEE has pointed out, although there is no wine1.4 package for Ubuntu 10.04 in the official PPA, the wine1.3 package actually provides version 1.4. (This is indicated by the complete version number--1.4-0ubuntu1~ppa1~lucid1--and can be verified by looking in the file called VERSION in the wine1.3_1.4.orig.tar.gz file linked here.)\nTherefore, Buzz-dEE's answer is god advice; I recommend you just use that package, unless you have specific needs that require your to compile from source. (Or you want to use the unstable 1.5 version, which is not provided for Lucid.)\nHowever, if for any reason you wish to build from source, please read on.\nYou will need the development packages that provide header files for the libraries it uses. That's the cause of the error message you're getting.\nTo resolve this particular error, you'll need the package called libx11-dev.\n-dev packages provide header files. libx11-dev is not the only such package you'll need, to compile Wine from source. I recommend taking a look at the build dependencies for the development version of Wine in Ubuntu. (Scroll down to where it says \"Build dependencies.\") That should give you a good idea of which -dev packages you'll need to install, for Wine to be able to compile.\nIf you use 64bit version of Ubuntu, this error message may appear if you're trying to compile 32bit wine, so you'll need some 32bit libraries to do it: libx11-dev:i386 and libfreetype6-dev:i386\n\nA: If you have the source repositories enabled, you would have more luck if you use:\nsudo apt-get build-dep wine\n\nIt installs all the dependencies of Wine. If you only need to solve the X error:\nsudo apt-get install xorg-dev libx11-dev\n\n", "Q: Which browser (if any) will be able to play video and audio at VKontakte (vk.com) in Ubuntu without a flash plugin? I'm primarily concerned about this question for Ubuntu on Toshiba AC100 (ARM), because a Flash plugin for browsers is not available as a working package for Ubuntu on AC100, but it is a general question which would apply to any Ubuntu system where one doesn't want to use the prorietary Flash plugin and the format.\nAt http://vk.com (VKontakte -- a popular Facebook clone from Russia), video and audio are usually played by means of Flash. What if one doesn't want to mess with the proprietary Adobe's flash plugin, is it possible to play video and audio at VKontakte?\n(As we know, in the case of YouTube, video playback can be done by means of HTML5 as an alternative to Flash. And indeed, I could play video from YouTube in Firefox in Ubuntu 12.04 for AC100.)\nIs the situation for VKontakte worse than for YouTube?\nI have found the following answers about HTML5 and VKontakte (in Russian) from 2010 -- http://otvety.google.ru/otvety/thread?tid=405ffaec80c737f7 and http://habrahabr.ru/company/vkontakte/blog/93599/ -- saying that VKontakte encodes the video with H.264, and because of this, HTML5 playback will work only in Google Chrome and Safari (important for iOS), but not in Firefox and Opera which don't support H.264.\nI've also found the following statemnent concerning H.264 support in browsers -- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H264#Controversies :\n\"In January 2011, Google announced that they were pulling support for H.264 from their Chrome browser and supporting both Theora and WebM/VP8 to use only open formats.[16] However, as of September 2012, Google has not followed through with this announcement and still supports H.264 in their Chrome browser through FFMPEG. No official statement was released on the matter.\nOn 18 March 2012 Mozilla announced that it will support H.264 in Firefox on mobile devices due to prevalence of H.264-encoded video and the increased power-efficiency of using dedicated H.264 decoder hardware common on such devices.\"\nSo, the situation is not clear: is Chromium expected to abandon the support for H.264, and has Firefox not yet implemented it? Is it possible to play video at VKontakte in one of the browsers in Ubuntu on AC100 now?\n(And what about audio at VKontakte?)\n(I've also posted this question to https://answers.launchpad.net/ac100/+question/208747 .)\n\nA: I've tested this: \nin Chromium, under each video at vk.com, there is a notice saying that Flash Player is needed, or one can load the HTML5 player (the 2nd option is a clickable link). If one clicks the \"HTML5 player\" link, the video is played rather well.\nSimilarly for audio at vk.com in Chromium (some tracks are played badly, others quite well). \nIn Firefox, there is no such \"HTML5 player\" option in the notice under a video. \nHence conclusion: videos from vk.com can't be played in Firefox in Ubuntu 12.04 on ARM, but they can in Chromium.\n", "Q: Listening radio with Mplayer in terminal I found out that listening to radio in terminal using \"mplayer url\" is much better than any software around, but after a while, terminal prints out a message saying low on cache.\nHow can I increase the cache in the terminal? Is it possible to free the used cache periodically while listening to the radio?\n\nA: You can set mplayer's cache with -cache argument on command line as well as specifying the initial cache fill before playback with '-cache-min'.\nTry:\n$ mplayer -cache 8192 -cache-min 80 <url>\n\np.s. 8192 should be enough, however, you can increase that number according to your needs. Note that the initial cache fill without the '-cache-min' option is only 20%.\n\nA: To listen Internet-Radio from a terminal I would recommend pyradio\nAs far as I know it uses mplayer and vlc in the background but has a really nice command-line interface.\n", "Q: Install Ubuntu on a new partition? I have install Ubuntu with WUBI, but it uses a virtual disk how can I make it so Ubuntu uses a new partition instead of the virtual disk on my C: drive?\nI have been googling for a few hours now, and I can't seem to find the solution I am looking for.\n\nA: The normal Ubuntu download that is not Wubi installs in a new partition.  Like just about every other Linux distribution, such as Red Hat, Debian, etc, it will look for any other operating system, like Windows, and create a dual boot configuration for all of them.\nBut be aware that once you install any of them, you can't simply erase it because the boot configuration file is on the last one installed.  If you delete it, Windows will not boot unless you restore its boot loader using either the original Windows boot disk, or a 3rd-party utility.\n\nA: You can install Ubuntu on separate partition without wiping the Windows boot loader. I have written a tutorial about it in details with snapshots on my blog.\n", "Q: How do I check if my laptop fan is working properly? I have an old Dell studio 1558 laptop (2 years) with Ubuntu 12.04. Its always make some noise, some time the fan make a terrible noise - and I must quickly shutdown it by press the power button 5 seconds. When the terrible noise the laptop take really long to shutdown with the normal way (or event terminal with shutdown -h now).  \nI just install new Windows 8 for testing, with Windows 8 there is no noise with the fan. But I can make sure because I just use Windows for a few minute.  \nSo is there any way (some command or program) that I can check if my fan is working properly? Does the fan need driver or something?\nThanks for all of you!\n\nA: Update to the latest BIOS, if it is a software problem it will fix, because BIOS of a laptop is the driver along with all power supply for fan, But\nas it seems to me that it is making some noise after some time of starting the pc, the problem may be with the hardware you must get it fixed with Dell service center, i.e.\nthere might be any part which get loose as it get heated, and Ubuntu is known for its heating If you run ubuntu it will consume more power than other OSes and produce more heat and less battery efficiency.\n\nA: Windows 8 has different power management settings, so you would need to run it for more than a few minutes to determine if the same thing happens there.  \nTerrible fan noises are pretty much guaranteed to be a hardware issue.  You can try cleaning your laptop fan and heatsink, either with compressed air (safer but less effective) or by taking apart the laptop and cleaning the fan & heatsink directly (riskier). My Dell laptop was making terrible noises, and the process of cleaning the fan fixed it - either from being clean or from things getting re-aligned.  \nOf course, disassembling the hardware will void any warranty and might cause more problems than it fixes, or you may not be comfortable doing that.  \n", "Q: How can I install a nightly build?

I appreciate any help.\n\nA: During installation you're asked to set a password. If you didn't set it yourself, ask the guy who installed it or to get it reset for you. There's no backdoor or default password with privileges to reset it.\nHowever more advanced tricks are available to reset it of course. Here's a guide for example: \"How to reset your password in Ubuntu\". It does require some 'techie' skills.\n\nA: Generally ubuntu will be the both username and password . if its not then ubuntu will be  username and then give a enter as assuming  blank password . \n\nA: There is no default password for Ubuntu or any sane operating system.\nDuring the installation a username and password is specified.\nHaving a default username/password would be a bad idea from a security perspective.\nImagine if all Visa cards had a \"default\" PIN.

The partition is not formatted but converted into a swap area.Because of this I cannot boot into my windows.Is there any way that restore the partition back to its normal state?\nI found this while doing some research.But I guess that works only when the drive is formatted and when one has to recover the lost data.  Thank you.\n\nA: Could you please tell which Windows partition has been selected as swap area?\nI think there generally are two partitions made default by Windows 7 in most cases, one of which is bootloader. Did you select that one or the C drive one as your swap area? Did you delete the old bootloader parition?\nIn any case, when you boot into Ubuntu next time, see that you off the swap first (How to do that is there in the question you linked). Otherwise it will start writing data, which I don't think would turn out good. \nIf you just selected C drive, I think swapoff and update-grub should reset your Windows system.  \nsudo swapoff -a\n\nsudo update-grub\n\nFor more details on how to turn off swap, look here: Deleting Unused Swaps Partions\n", "Q: \"Unable to mount location.

I have installed (not live CD) Ubuntu on a USB stick, and now having dual boot with Windows. How can I use this USB on another machine, as the latter does not have grub.\nHow to make the USB standalone bootable without grub, working on any machine?\n\nA: You need to have grub installed on the USB stick or the hard disk of the host machine. In your case as you want it bootable on any machine, you need it installed on the USB stick and boot the USB using BIOS option.\nOBS: there is no problem on your machine to have GRUB on your HD (to dual boot with windows) and on the stick. If you boot from your HD, you'll have your usual options and GRUB on the stick will not be used. when you boot from the USB, GRUB on the stick will be used and you will have the options you defined there (probably only booting the Ubuntu on the stick as if you use it on many machines, you don't know what will be on these machines)\nInstalling GRUB2 on the USB stick:\nOpen a terminal and type:\nsudo su\nfdisk -l #to see the device for your USB stick\n# Replace all /dev/sdx with your USB device from line above\nmkdir /mnt/USB && mount /dev/sdx /mnt/USB #DON'T FORGET TO REPLACE\ngrub-install --force --no-floppy --root-directory=/mnt/USB /dev/sdx #REPLACE\n\n", "Q: My account can't start GUI, but Guest account can Trying to get the nvidia drivers to output 720p component (as they did in my 10.10 system), I've hosed my Mythbuntu 12.04 config in some way.

When I launch as guest, no log file is generated at all...\n\nA: This is probably a bug, but the workarounds for this sort of problem are generic, and applying the workaround will help in reporting the bug initially. (So while most bug questions are closed as off-topic, I'm answering this one with a workaround. Also, I suppose it's possible that this could happen as the result of some misconfiguration, rather than bug.)\nHow to Get a Successful GUI Login as \"Fred Hamilton\"\nPress Ctrl+Alt+F1 to open a text-based virtual console. Log in with Fred Hamilton's username and password. But take note:\n\n\n*\n\n*The username will not actually be Fred Hamilton. It will be the short name. (You may recall having put in both a short username and a full name, when you installed Ubuntu.) If you don't remember what this is, it's probably fred. But some users make their initials (for example, mine is ek), or something entirely different.\nIf you don't know what this is, you can log in as Guest, and try to see what subfolders exist inside the /home folder. These subfolders are the folders for each human, non-guest user (so there's probably just one--the one for Fred Hamilton).\n\n*Unlike when logging in graphically, nothing will change on the screen as you type in your password. You won't see any placeholder characters like *. This is by design. Just type in your password and press Enter.\nNow you can run commands. Make sure you're connected to the Internet (you can connect in a simultaneous guest session if necessary, switching to the GUI with Alt+F7 and back to the first virtual console with Ctrl+Alt+F1). Run this command, by typing it in and pressing Enter.\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install gdm\n\nThis will install gdm, an alternative to lightdm. LightDM and GDM are two different display managers. A display manager is the part of the GUI that provides the graphical login screen. Since the LightDM login screen is not working, installing GDM and configuring it to be used instead of LightDM should eliminate the problem.\nPlease note:\n\n\n*\n\n*You'll be prompted for your password. As you enter it, you won't see anything change (as before).\n\n*As the final installation step, the gdm package will be configured and you'll get to choose whether you want to use LightDM or GDM as your display manager. Choose GDM. You can use the arrow keys and the Enter key to make this selection, when the menu comes up asking you which you want to use.\n\n\n*\n\n*Strictly speaking, you don't have to choose gdm, as you'll be manually switching to it anyway. But LightDM (which is currently broken and causing this problem) will continue giving you the bad login screen, unless you select GDM. You can always reconfigure this later, with sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm or sudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm.\n\n\n\nThen stop lightdm and start gdm:\nsudo stop lightdm\nsudo start gdm\n\nNow switch back to the GUI (Alt+F7) and log in as Fred Hamilton.\nHow to Report This As a Bug\nFirst, read the official bug reporting instructions for Ubuntu carefully. (The answers here are also a helpful resource.)\nThen report this bug against the lightdm package in Ubuntu, by pressing Alt+F2 and running the command ubuntu-bug lightdm.\nHere are a couple of specific considerations, when writing your bug report:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure to describe the problem in detail. In particular, developers should not have to come here, to fully understand and appreciate the bug you're reporting.\n\n*Make sure that an Xorg.0.log file created from a LightDM session (not from the current GDM session) is attached. Xorg.0.log and Xorg.0.log.old will usually be attached automatically, and Xorg.0.log.old will likely be the correct file. If you're at all unsure, you can also attach the Xorg.0.log file you currently have, if you made a copy of it before logging in again. (Just make sure to give it a description that makes clear what the difference is between it and the Xorg.0.log file automatically attached.)\nIn case somehow this is not a bug, you might also want to paste the contents of the appropriate Xorg.0.log file at http://paste.ubuntu.com and edit your question here (or post a comment) to provide a link to it.\nThis question might be considered a duplicate of this older question. (Thanks to aking1012 for finding that.) If so, and this is closed as a duplicate of that question, this answer can probably be merged, and then I can edit accordingly.\n\nA: Mate, hit \n\nCtrl + Alt + F1\n\nrun this in terminal:\n\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm\n\nChoose lightdm or gdm, see if things come back to normal.\nExactly that happened to me once when I tried to customize lightdm with lightdm-webkit, but the steps I told you worked for me.\n", "Q: Unable to detect second display via HDMI with NVIDIA X Server Settings?

I managed to get down to the last step, and finished the installation process. After it prompted me to remove what I used to install Ubuntu, I did so, removing my SanDisk 8GB flash drive, and allowed the system to reboot.\nLike usual, the desktop booted with the HP image, with the options at the bottom(Boot Menu, System Recovery, etc). However,  when it should have started up with Ubuntu(like I'm certain it should have done), I received the following error:\nInput signal out of range\nChange settings to 1600 x 900\nFrom the time I installed the operating system, back in late August, till now, I've been trying to figure out how I would go about fixing this issue. My mom is also starting to get frustrated with my not having resolved the issue, as its the only desktop that has a printer installed.\nIs there any possible way to resolve this?\nTo summarize the problem:\n-Successful boot\n-Screen brings up error\n-Screen goes to standby\n-Nothing else possible until desktop is rebooted, which will initiate the above three steps\nA few notes:\n-I did not back up my computer before I installed Ubuntu. I didn't have anything to write to, and basically just forgot to.\n-I don't have a Recovery Disk.\n-I don't have the Windows 7 disk that is supposed to come with the computer.\n-It has been narrowed down by a friend on Skype that the problem lies with the display, and that the vga= boot command does have something to do with fixing the problem\nThank you in advance for resolving this problem. I greatly appreciate it.\n\nA: It appears from your comments, you have several problems \nFirst lets try and resolve your original signal out of range issue. \nIf you are able to log in from the terminal with username and password IE the screen you are seeing.\nYou can try fixing the frequency out of range issue,that is currently  hiding grub, by running:\nsudo nano  /etc/default/grub \nPress enter \nIf prompted for password,add it, and press enter again\nUsing the arrow keys for up and down \nfind the line #GRUB_GFXMODE=640x480 \nand change to GRUB_GFXMODE=640x480 \nwhen finished making the changes hold down Ctrl button and press x \nYou should be asked if you wish to save,if so choose y \nNow run:\nsudo update-grub press enter\nreboot your machine and hopefully you will at least see ubuntu and windows in your grub menu \nIf you still dont see grub, but the frequency out range no longer exists,then do as ObsessiveFOSS suggested and hold down shift during the next boot.This should bring  grub out of hiding  \nOption 2\nIf not able to log in,its probably best to boot the live cd again and use the boot repair tool.\nYou can find detailed instructions here https://askubuntu.com/a/139142/71679 \nWhilst using boot repair its also possible to fix the out of range issue, as suggested above, with a simple tick of a box.\nTo do this \nClick Advanced options\nGo to the GRUB options tab\nTick the out-of-range option\nApply\nReboot  \nAgain if the frequency error message is gone but grub is not showing try holding the shift key \n\nA: Same problem happened to me in my HP Pavillion, if anyone is interested. The thing was that Ubuntu did not install the proprietary drivers for the graphics card. To fix all at once I did the following:\nPress the \"down arrow\" once during the Out of range message and hit enter to go to recovery mode.\nSelect the first option, resume normal boot to get to safe mode. (Running failsafe graphic mode did not work for me)\nAfter booting you need to do two things:\n1)Open a terminal window to fix the grub issue as stated in the previous post by damien.\n2) Fix the graphic card driver:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current\n\nThis solved every problem for me.

Is it possible to run Ubuntu 12.04 or 12.10 on a Google Nexus Tablet? Would it be able to run Unity and/or Gnome Shell? or would it have to run a lighter desktop environment?\n\nA: It definitely is possible - here is a video taken by a Canonical employee showing Ubuntu (what appears to be either 12.04 or 12.10) running on a Nexus7. We just don't know how they did it. The accompanying blog post is here\nMark Shuttleworths blog post announcing the name for Ubuntu 13.04 (Raring Ringtail) has the following note at the bottom:\n\nSo bring along a Nexus 7 if you’re coming to Copenhagen, because it makes a rumpty reference for our rootin’ tootin’ radionic razoring. The raving Rick and his merry (wo)men will lead us to a much leaner, sharper, more mobile world. We’ll make something… wonderful, and call it the Raring Ringtail. See you there soon.\n\nSo in short, it's been done. How to do it though... well, we don't know that.\n\nA: That's an interesting question :)\nA quick google search finds a thread on xda-developers:\n\nYea, both devices would run Ubuntu fine, but you would need a\n  mouse/keyboard for any sort of functionality.\n\nI would imagine making Ubuntu to run on a tablet would be an exciting weekend project but don't expect the end result to be really useful. \nHere's even an article titled How to Install Ubuntu on Android, which should provide general directions.\n\n\nA: Actually, it's pretty easy if you are already rooted. You can find instructions on LinuxOnAndroid's website.\nOnce you've got your Nexus rooted download the Complete Linux Installer application.\nI installed Lubuntu on my aging Samsung Captivate (AT&T's version of the first-generation Galaxy S), and it does work. I installed TeXlive on it and was able to edit and compile a couple of tex files, and preview them using evince or epdfview. It's pretty amazing actually.\nOf course, for me it was just a fun project to try out, but I guess that, with a keyboard, a Nexus 7 could actually be useful as a Linux tablet. You do need enough storage capacity of course, because you are installing a desktop Linux distro after all.\n\nA: Here is how you do it! Fresh off the press:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Nexus7/Installation\nand here's a guide for reporting bugs:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://chrismwayne.com/?p=94\n", "Q: cant connect to internet directly on ubuntu I have dual booted machine windows 7 with ubuntu 12.04.\nI dont have direct internet access in ubuntu on wired network although direct connection works in windows7.\nI have to connect through a proxy on ubuntu, which works fine.\nThis is not a ubuntu version related problem as i have been getting it from ubuntu 11.04.\nI want to know what difference is there in ubuntu and windows 7 which creates such results and how to fix it?\nEDIT\nIn ubuntu i get the error on direct connection(google-chrome-stable) -\nThe server at www.example.com can't be found, because the DNS lookup failed. \n\nA: The resolv.conf in Ubuntu was probably changed for proxy use and was not changed back for normal use for some reason. Deleting the old resolv.conf may help. You can make a backup copy of the file and delete the original with this single command:\nsudo mv /etc/resolv.conf /etc/backup.resolv.conf\n\nA new resolv.conf will be generated as and when needed. \nSteps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into Ubuntu\n\n*disconnect from the Internet via proxy, if connected.\n\n*Open a terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T and enter the command:\nsudo mv /etc/resolv.conf /etc/backup.resolv.conf\n\n*Connect to the Internet with the Direct connection settings.\nTo add a permanent dns entry to resolv.conf see: How do I add a DNS server via resolv.conf?\nHope this helps\n\nA: Found the problem to be resolv.conf was not getting updated bu network settings \nso i manually added google public dns and it works perfectly.\n", "Q: Generate a proper 404 page for blocked sites via /etc/hosts instead of redirect to localhost I have blocked some websites by editing /etc/hosts and adding several newline-entries in the following manner:\n0.0.0.0 www.domain.com\nAnd it works. The only thing is: when a website is visited which is blocked, the browser is redirected to my http://localhost, resulting in a directory listing or website-presentation that is running within my localhost root-environment. \nIt's not a very big problem, but I prefer a standard error that mentions the website cannot be visited (for instance by a 404 page). Is this possible?\n\nA: I assume you're running a local web server?  It seems like you are, so I will assume that.  Also, I'm hoping you're using Apache, although other web servers probably have the same capabilities, but I don't have experience with any others.\nIf you are blocking a large number of sites, this might become too much trouble, but you could probably create a virtual domain with a start page for your 404 page.  If you know PHP, you could probably customize it with the name of the site that's been blocked for a more informative message.\nThe hosts file would stay the same, and the additions would be made to Apache's configuration file in /etc/apache2/sites-enabled.  Initially, there is only the document root, defined, I think, as /var/www; you can not only change this, but you can add any number of additional directories with associated names and aliases.\nMy idea is to add one for a new directory that would contain your 404 page.  Decide on a directory and a \"site name\", and add a new entry to the file.  For example:\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n    <Directory /var/www/my404>\n        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews\n        AllowOverride All\n        Order allow,deny\n        allow from all\n    </Directory>\n    DocumentRoot /var/www/my404/\n    ServerName my404.loc\n    ServerAlias www.domain.com\n</VirtualHost>\n\nYou can add an entry to your hosts file with localhost   my404.loc, and then you will be able to access the page locally for testing by entering http://my404.loc.  Hopefully, you can also access it by www.domain.com if you have that entry in your hosts file.  You should be able to keep adding more \"ServerAlias\" entries as you add more to the hosts file.\nI hope this is clear to you, and maybe even helpful.  If you think it's helpful, but it isn't clear, feel free to ask more.\nNo guarantees, as I've never actually tried this whole thing. :)\n", "Q: How about a separate partition for home? \nPossible Duplicate:\npost installation /home partition \n\nUsing 12.04. I heard but never tried with  /home as a separate partition. What my question is just assume that i have already /home and I'm trying to have a fresh install. So at the installation process what steps I've to take.\nbecause my doubts are here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Are we have to select /home also in installation?  Or will it do automatically?\n\n*What about all the configuration files in home?  Will they load automatically or we have to manually? If so how?\n\n\nA: This may be a little dated but still applies. Follow the tutorial from Physocats\n\"Create a separate home partition in Ubuntu\". If you have issues, there is a text-only (command-line-driven) guide for this process here \nRequirements:\nYou must use a live CD for this process, for two reasons:\n1.In order to resize your existing / partition, it needs to be unmounted. The only way to unmount it is for it not to be in use, which means you can't boot to your regular Ubuntu installation while resizing it... which means you need a live CD. By default, the Ubuntu live CD does not automatically mount internal partitions and drives, but if you happen to notice the drive appear on the desktop, right-click it to unmount it before starting this process.\n2 If you screw up your installation by accident, you can use the live CD to restore your old settings and, in the worst situation, at least recover your important files.\n\nA: During an install, you need to manually partition your drives. Choose the main partition, format it, and mount it as / and then select the partition for your /home, format it and mount it as /home.\nAll of the config files will be put there after the partitioning is done.\nIf you have already installed the OS, copy all of the files from /home to the desired partition, and (remember to back everything up) delete them if disk space is short on / Then edit /etc/fstab, and add at the bottom\n/dev/<new_partition> /home <filesystem_type> <mounting_options> <dump(probably zero)> <pass(probably 1)>\n\nand whenever you boot, /home will seamlessly be the new partition. You can mount it manually the first time to not have to reboot.\nedit: if you are not sure, the filesystem type you probably want is ext4.\n", "Q: How to backup specific application? using 12.04. \nis it possible to have backup of particular application ?\ni mean I don't want all applications and I just want one single application as a backup along with its configurations or settings what I made . \nso from what areas I've to collect the backup?\n\nA: It heavily depends on the application.\nIf you have installed the application from the Software Center, then I guess you will not have a problem re-downloading and re-installing it through there, you just want to keep your settings. If this really the case, then you have to look under your home folder.\nThe first place to look is under ~/.config/Application_Name and under ~/.Application_Name.\nUsually, if you backup these folders you will successfully save the configurations of your applications. But, unless you are more specific about your application, I cannot search and see myself.\n", "Q: How to partition this USB drive for installation with an easy walk through? \n\n\nI am not a computer literate and need to know how to partition my USB drive without messing up my laptop.\nI already have the boot order set up properly and the USB drive already has the ISO image downloaded onto it. \nI am ready for install but just do not know how to partition. I am installing Ubuntu 12.04 LTS onto a USB. Can someone help me? I need an easy walk through please.\nWhat I need to know is from the screen shots above do I use the swap drive and if so how do i partition that drive to be my drive? I am stuck up to this part on the installation process.\nYes please make a list of the steps for me.\n\nA: First when you run the installer click Try Ubuntu. That will run Ubuntu without installing. Then plug your pendrive and type following commands : \nsudo umount /dev/sdb1\n\nThis will \"un-mount\" the drive. Then type : \nsudo mkfs.ext4 -n <nameOfYouDrive> -I /dev/sdb1\n\nThis will create a ext4 partition. And replace the \"nameOfYourDrive\" with the name you want to give (in single quotes but not with '<>')\nThen you can restart your computer and proceed with the installation. But what I would prefer is to install ubuntu 12.04LTS on another drive ie. /dev/sda2. This will not mess up your windows and your laptop!\n\nA: The downside with using Unetbootin is that the ubuntu on the USB will always revert to it's default settings and any changes or tools added will not be saved. This is not ideal if you wanted to use the USB as a rescue repair tool for Windows. Universal USB Installer works better. Here is a good \"How To\" from start to finish. http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/14912/create-a-persistent-bootable-ubuntu-usb-flash-drive/\n\nA: But installing Ubuntu in a usb is very very slow !!! \nBut the easy way is with 2 usb, put the .iso file in one USB and use the other as the target of installation. \nFollow the normal installation procedure, and only change the target to the other usb, the installation helps you with the partitioning.\n\nA: If you want to install Ubuntu onto a USB stick I think you're approaching this the wrong way. I'm assuming you already have a Windows installation you don't want to touch. Do the following.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the Ubuntu ISO you want to run, and the program unetbootin from sourceforge\n\n*With the help of unetbootin, place your ISO onto the USB stick. When asked, choose an amount of space you want to use for \"persistence\" (things you change/download while running Ubuntu from the USB). This can be all of the free space on the USB if you want.\n\n*When unetbootin is done, you now have a bootable USB stick that you can run Ubuntu from without having to install it on your computer. Changes you make while running Ubuntu from this USB should be saved on the USB, since you specified space for this in point two.\n\n\nIf I misunderstood you or if you have any questions, comment on this answer and I'll modify it.\n", "Q: How to un-install the Mac OSX Lion Theme I have had the Mac OSX Lion theme theme installed for a month or two now, and am ready to either try a new theme, or go back to the default Unity theme.\nHow can I completely remove this theme?\n\nA: This theme seems to have multiple components to it, but here are the basics:\nFirst, go to System Settings>Appearance, and choose Ambiance as the theme (this will reset the theme).\n\nNext for the Apple Logo (if you installed this) to return to the default logo, you need to reinstall Unity.\nTo do this, run: sudo apt-get install --reinstall unity unity-common in a terminal.\nYou can disable Cairo-Dock in your start up applications, or simply uninstall it if you choose.\nFinally, you can remove the theme's files from ~/.themes and ~/.icons.\n\nA: From the link, I gather that you've installed the theme by adding the repository and installed it like any regular program from Software Center /apt-get , so removing it should be just like how you would uninstall any other program.\n\n\n*\n\n*wget -O ubuntu-logo.zip http://dl.dropbox.com/u/53319850/NoobsLab.com/ubuntu-logo.zip\n&& sudo unzip ubuntu-logo.zip -d /usr/share/unity/5/\n\n*sudo apt-get remove mac-os-lion-icons-v2\n\n*sudo apt-get remove mac-os-lion-theme-v2\n\n*cd /usr/share/icons/mac-cursors && ./uninstall-mac-cursors.sh\nThese commands should undo what installing the theme effectively did, (all the extra packages gotten for the theme should be removed). As for CompizConfig Settings Manager and Gnome Tweak Tool, they are handy even if you don't want the theme, so it's okay to have them on your system, just undo any changes that you might have done.\nAbout resetting all themes and reverting back to the original, take a look at How to reset all themes?\n", "Q: Should I install 12.04 or 10.10 on a laptop with 512MB of RAM?

It servers all needs:\n\n\n*\n\n*Transmission\n\n*Mount external HDDs on boot - your very own NAS\n\n*Samba File Server to access files from any of your devices\n\n\nA: System requirements\n\n\n*\n\n*While the minimum memory requirement for 32bit is 384 MB, a minimum of 512 MB is needed for the 64bit installation. On systems with only the bare minimum amount of memory, it is also strongly recommended to use the \"Install Ubuntu\" option as it uses less memory than the full live session.\n\n*The Ubuntu 12.04 installation image does not include support for old computers that do not support PAE. If your computer is affected, you can either first install Ubuntu 10.04 or 11.10 and upgrade to 12.04 or you can use the Lubuntu or Xubuntu images. The non-PAE version of the Linux kernel will be dropped completely following the 12.04 release.\n\n\nReference: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PrecisePangolin/ReleaseNotes/UbuntuDesktop#System_Requirements\n\nA: I think your main consideration is your RAM. 512 MB is very borderline. As is, I would say install 10.04 because the GNOME 2 desktop environment will be less resource hungry than the Unity desktop environment of 12.04. Similarly, as @VendettaDroid suggested check out Lubuntu or Xubuntu for additional lightweight, Ubuntu compatible options.\nAside from that, maybe check your laptop specs to see if you could increase you RAM? This could actually become a necessity depending upon how heavily it will be used as a file server. \n", "Q: Unable create a custom keyboard shortcut in 12.04 I'm using 12.04 64bit on a Dell Latitude E6410.

I've been having a lot of problems regarding networking on my Ubuntu laptop. From Windows, everything works fine. When I wire directly into the modem, it works fine, but when I am on my wireless network (and I've tried wiring into the network as well), I've been having problems with web form, and sometimes site logins.

It said \"Can not upload file - Too large for php post_max_size directive\". I only wrote a sentence! Any idea why it does that?\n\nA: Your problem could be many things.\nTry using ping from the command line with these options: \nping google.com\n\nYou should get the responses back normally. Then try this:\nping -s 1300 -M do google.com\n\nwhich will determine if you are getting packet loss. That will detect whether you've got a networking problem with the MTU settings. I had that once and it produced a variety of effects.\nIf your Ubuntu is set up to use an MTU (max transmission unit) packet size of 1500 but your ISP's gateway is only allowing 1000, then you'll get packet loss and problems like you describe. \nIt's made worse if you have a firewall on your router that is blocking the ICMP packets that should notify you of the error (happens a lot because some sysops think ICMP packets are evil).\nYou can also try resetting the router to its factory defaults.\n\nA: I am not sure this will work or not .

Both i386 and i686 refer 32 bit version. uname will return x86_64 in case if it is a 64 bit version.\n$ uname -a\nLinux devav2 3.2.0-30-generic-pae #48-Ubuntu SMP Fri Aug 24 17:14:09 UTC 2012 i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Linux(-s) - OS/Kernel name\n\n*devav2(-n) - hostname\n\n*3.2.0-30-generic-pae (-r) - kernel release\n\n*48-Ubuntu SMP Fri Aug 24 17:14:09 UTC 2012 (-v) - Kernel version with time and SMP stands for symmetric multiprocessing, which means you have multiprocessor support  \n\n*i686(-m) - Machine hardware name\n\n*i686(-p) - processor type\n\n*i386(-i) - hardware platform\n\n*GNU/LINUX(-o) - Operating System name\n\n\nBelow is grabbed from uname --help page which might help you to understand more about it.\n -a, --all                print all information, in the following order,\n                             except omit -p and -i if unknown:\n  -s, --kernel-name        print the kernel name\n  -n, --nodename           print the network node hostname\n  -r, --kernel-release     print the kernel release\n  -v, --kernel-version     print the kernel version\n  -m, --machine            print the machine hardware name\n  -p, --processor          print the processor type or \"unknown\"\n  -i, --hardware-platform  print the hardware platform or \"unknown\"\n  -o, --operating-system   print the operating system\n\n\nA: If all you want is the architecture you could always try the command called arch.  It is very terse.  It is not POSIX.\n\nA: For debian Linux derived systems, one possible command is dpkg-architecture -q DEB_BUILD_ARCH.\nOn 64bits systems, it returns :\n$ dpkg-architecture -q DEB_BUILD_ARCH\namd64\n\nOn 32bits systems, it returns :\n$ dpkg-architecture -q DEB_BUILD_ARCH\ni386\n\n\nA: The command is uname -m.\nOpen a terminal try using uname -m command. This should show you the OS architecture.\nIf it gives any output like ix86, where x is 3,4,5 or 6, Your OS is 32bit.\nYou can also see the Ubuntu architecture by Opening \"System monitor\" and going in the System tab.\n\nDifference between hardware platform and Processor type:\nThere is a difference between the hardware platform (which is given by -i switch) to the CPU type (given by -p switch).   \nThe hardware platform tells us which architecture the kernel is built for (may be optimized though for later versions). It can be a i386. \nHowever the Processor type refers to the actual processor type of your machine such as i686 (P4 and later builds). \nThanks to Schotty of this this page. Here is an answer from Unix stackexchange site on the same topic, though I didn't find the language enough clear (completely my fault).\n\nA: use syscap from Formake project https://sourceforge.net/projects/formake\nsyscap allows to probe many system properties and test dependencies. It is a portable shell script.\n", "Q: How to recover disk and files after 10.04 boot failure? I have a 1TB HDD with four Windows XP partitions and a 120GB HDD with 10.04. While working in Ubuntu, due to delay and failure to shutdown, I switched off the system.\nNext it failed to boot in Ubuntu and stopped at initramfs. After that, I tried to repair from the booting stage. By mistake instead of hdd no I used partition no.

I am unable to access the files.\nI would like to revive the disk and recover files. Would appreciate any help.\n\nA: I would start by finding your installer/live disk and mounting the drive. After mounting the drive run \nsudo update-grub\n\nto fix the bootloader.\n\nA: Boot from an Ubuntu live cd and install boot-repair\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && boot-repair\n\nUsing the boot-repait software you can restore your grub and login\n", "Q: Alternatives for 'egrep -o \"success|error|fail\"  | sort | uniq -c' I sometime need to check some logs and I do this with this command:\negrep -o \"success|error|fail\" <filename> | sort | uniq -c\n\nSample input:\ntest error on line 10\ntest connect success\ntest insert success\ntest started at 00:00\ntest delete  fail\n\nSample output:\n1 error\n1 fail\n2 success\n\nI would like to know if someone knows a way to do this with a shorter command?\nBefore you ask why I would like to do this with an different command... No special reason, I'm just curious :)\n\nA: No, I think that you are as good as it gets. Naturally, you could do it with one perl script, \nperl -nle  's/.*(error|fail|success).*/$1/ && $a{$_}++ ; END {  print \"$_ $a{$_}\" for keys %a } ' test.txt\n\n...but it is more complex and less intuitive.\n\nA: Here is the awk way of doing it\nawk 'BEGIN{RS=\" \"}/success/{s++}/fail/{f++}/error/{e++}END{print \"Success:\"s\" Failed:\"f\" Error:\"e}' abc\n\nBut all these one liners will be bit lengthier than our good old grep\n\nA: Not much shorter, but since you don't really need the regular expression, there's fgrep (grep -F).\nfgrep 'success\nerror\nfail' \"$filename\" | sort | uniq -c\n\nanother way to write the same thing in bash:\nfgrep $'success\\nerror\\nfail' \"$filename\" | sort | uniq -c\n\n\nA: You could write a simple bash script and then call the script, like:\n#!/bin/bash\negrep -o \"success|error|fail\" \"$1\" | sort | uniq -c\n\nand save it as (for example) myscript.sh. Then do a chmod +x myscript.sh and you can call it like myscript.sh <filename>.\n\nA: Your command, while short and sweet, is a rather circuitous way to count occurrences of a term.  I'd probably take the blunt, direct approach and use grep's -c flag (which does exactly that) inside of a shell loop:\nfor i in success test fail; do echo `grep -c $i <filename>` $i; done\n\nNot as short, not as exciting, potentially faster for large logfiles (no sort).  I'd say it's a wash.\n\nA: This could be a dummy answer but I think, in this case, sort is quite useless; maybe you can omit it. Nevertheless here we are using three different commands for three different actions.\nWe can short it if some of them con be reached with some option of grep, but I don't see which... :)\n", "Q: How to uninstall windows xp using ubuntu 12.04 if they are in same partition? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to convert Wubi install into regular install? \n\nSo I have installed Ubuntu 12.04.1 using windows installer and they are both installed in same location.

First of all, I'm aware a similar question for GNOME is asked here: \"Switch off laptop backlight when locking screen\".\nObjective\nI would like to turn off my screen on locking the session for power saving reasons.\nActual problem\nLocking the screen on Kubuntu (KDE) inevitably triggers the screensaver as far as I can see. There's no screensaver option other than 'Blank screen' together with its background colour set to black that comes just close to my goal. It blanks the screen, but doesn't turn off the screen. Screen's backlight will still be on and not saving any power.\nCurrent workaround\nA workaround via a script + shortcut key is possible, however, it's just a workaround since it doesn't trigger on all ways to lock the session. Therefore, I think it should be possible to have it done more elegantly, for example by providing this option in KDE's configuration dialog of the screensaver.\nThe workaround I am now using is the following. A script that locks the screen and turns off the screen:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nqdbus org.freedesktop.ScreenSaver /ScreenSaver Lock\nxset dpms force standby\n\nand let it run with a shortcut key via a custom menu entry. It works.\nHere's why I consider it to be a workaround rather than a solution. It doesn't work for other ways to trigger the locking of the session.\nMy actual question(s)\nDo I need to touching/patching KDE's source?\n\n\n*\n\n*If not what are my options?\n\n*If so,\n\n\n*\n\n*could someone point me to where I can get started?\n\n*what do you think is the recommended place in the GUI for configuration?\n\n\n\nI'm using Kubuntu 12.04 and willing to upgrade to KDE 4.9 or waiting for the 12.10 release.\n\nA: As of KDE 5, most of the solutions here no longer work. \nHere's what I found that works though (as of 2016-09-28), create a text document and in it copy and paste the following code: \n#!/bin/sh\nsleep 0.5\nloginctl lock-session\nxset dpms force off\n\nand then save it as \"KDE5lockscreenanddpms.sh\" The name doesn't matter, just make sure you have the .sh at the end of it. Then navigate to where you saved with your file manager, right click on it and open up properties>permissions> and make it executable. \nNow you can click on it and it will run the script which will lock your screen and then after .5 seconds will turn your monitor(s) off. \nHere are some posts with the info about these commands. \nKDE.org- loginctl lock-session\nLinux-apps.com - sleep 0.5\nxset dpms force off\n\nA: One possible solution is switch to xscreensaver. The man page actually come with instruction.\nFollowing is outline\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable KDE screen saver\n\n\n*\n\n*K menu -> Computer -> System Settings -> Display and Monitor -> Screen Saver\n\n*Uncheck Start automatically after\n\n\n*Install xscreensaver\nsudo apt-get install xscreensaver\n\n*Create ~/.kde/Autostart/xscreensaver.desktop\nAdd following lines into it\n[Desktop Entry]\nExec=xscreensaver\nName=XScreenSaver\nType=Application\nX-KDE-StartupNotify=false\n\n\n*Replace KDE lock screen\ncd /usr/lib/kde4/libexec\nsudo mv kscreenlocker kscreenlocker.original\nsudo vim kscreenlocker\n\nAdd following lines into kscreenlocker\n#!/bin/sh\nxscreensaver-command -lock\n\n\n*Use xscreensaver-demo to configure dpms (no sudo)\nConfigure DPMS in Advance tab.

Right!\nThis solution is based on the accepted anwser and its KDE5 actualized copy.\nSo skim them - if you haven't done already - first. But the command needed is different now, and I have been inpired by a good topic on KDE screen turn-off shortcut.\nCombining multiple info sources, bit dbus viewer trying and instrospect calls and tada - you should paste this command to the screen lock noticification:\n/bin/sleep 1 && /bin/dbus-send --session --dest=org.kde.kglobalaccel  /component/org_kde_powerdevil org.kde.kglobalaccel.Component.invokeShortcut string:'Turn Off Screen'\nSome reasonin behind the command:\n\n*\n\n*The command starts with a 1 sec sleep delay because: the key unpress event of screen lock shortcut can immediately turn the screen back on\n\n*The qdbus command is deprecated, and not installed on many distros now, but dbus-send is pretty basic and ubiquitous\n\nAlso, this should be moved to Super User, or Unix & Linux.\nUbuntu is not the most relevant distro for KDE. but this applies to all KDE distros.\n\nA: More than 10 years after I posted my question... \nKDE 5.27 gained the feature to turn off the screen on the lock screen by pressing Esc. \nPlasma 5.27 announcement\n\nSave power with one keystroke: While on the lock screen, hit the Esc key to turn off the screen and save some power.\n\n\nA: On Kubuntu 14.04, simply go System Setting - Power Mgmt. - turn off Dim Screen and Screen Energy Saving under Energy Saving tab.\nCheers!\n\nA: System Settings / Personal / Light Locker (in the new Whisker menu)\n\nA: Kde5 and XScreenSaver(5.34) :\nclick on tab complex Advance , then activate energy management by ticking it and set the minutes in power-off to your like (or use even quick power-off).\n", "Q: How to change Video Settings in Ubuntu 12.04 I Have a ATI Radeon X600 Card (RV348) and Samsung SyncMaster 550v\nI Install Ubuntu 12.04 with a Plasma Monitor I can´t see the desktop \nI can't see the GRUB options; I would like to change the Video configuration but xorg.conf don't exist \n\nA: I can't tell if you have one monitor working or not from the question.

The webcam is using uvcvideo module but I do not want to blacklist it since it is also being used by an external webcam I have.\nIs there any way of disabling the device itself without touching the modules list?\nThis is how the webcams are listed by lsusb. The first one is an integrated one (It is identified by some apps as BisonCam NB Pro), the second one is the external Logitech C525:\nBus 002 Device 004: ID 5986:0361 Acer, Inc \nBus 003 Device 002: ID 046d:0826 Logitech, Inc. \n\nI have already checked BIOS - there is no way of disabling the webcam from there. Besides I would love to learn how to disable the device by ID anyway.\nThanks!\n\nA: @surjack: 1-6 depends on your port mapping. If you type lsusb -t you will get it and then compare it with the output of lsusb.\nFor me i get the following outputs:\nlsusb\nBus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub\nBus 004 Device 002: ID 5986:0525 Acer, Inc \nBus 004 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub\nBus 003 Device 012: ID 413c:2107 Dell Computer Corp. \n\nand\nlsusb -t\n/:  Bus 04.Port 1: Dev 1, Class=root_hub, Driver=xhci_hcd/4p, 5000M\n    |__ Port 1: Dev 2, If 0, Class=Video, Driver=uvcvideo, 5000M\n    |__ Port 1: Dev 2, If 1, Class=Video, Driver=uvcvideo, 5000M\n/:  Bus 03.Port 1: Dev 1, Class=root_hub, Driver=xhci_hcd/4p, 480M\n    |__ Port 3: Dev 9, If 0, Class=Vendor Specific Class, Driver=hdm_usb, 480M\n    |__ Port 4: Dev 10, If 0, Class=Hub, Driver=hub/4p, 480M\n        |__ Port 3: Dev 11, If 0, Class=Human Interface Device, Driver=usbhid, 1.5M\n        |__ Port 4: Dev 12, If 0, Class=Human Interface Device, Driver=usbhid, 1.5M\n/:  Bus 01.Port 1: Dev 1, Class=root_hub, Driver=ehci-pci/2p, 480M\n    |__ Port 1: Dev 2, If 0, Class=Hub, Driver=hub/6p, 480M\n        |__ Port 3: Dev 4, If 0, Class=Wireless, Driver=btusb, 12M\n        |__ Port 3: Dev 4, If 1, Class=Wireless, Driver=btusb, 12M\n\nNow just find the right Bus which is 04 in my case because the Acer, Inc is the camera. The port mapping shows the camera is located at Bus 04.Port 1. This means instead of using 1-6 I have to use 4-1.\nI am not a Linux/Ubuntu expert but this gives me the impression that you have to use Bus-Port and simply use the numbers.\nIf you want to be 100% sure use the cat command as described:\ncat /sys/bus/usb/devices/<Bus>-<Port>/id{Vendor,Product} \n\nand compare it with lsusb.\nIn my case:\ncat /sys/bus/usb/devices/4-1/id{Vendor,Product}\n5986\n0525\n\nwhich is identically to the lsusb output: 5986:0525.\nNow you found your internal webcam.\nBut unfortunately lysdexia is right and the echo command does not work because Permission denied.\nIs there another solution available?\n\nA: It's quite simple. The hard work is working out what the path to the USB device is. We need to start by finding which device we want to disable. We can do this with lsusb:\nBus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub\nBus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub\nBus 001 Device 002: ID 0402:5602 ALi Corp. M5602 Video Camera Controller\nBus 001 Device 003: ID 045e:0723 Microsoft Corp. LifeCam VX-7000 (UVC-compliant)\n\nChange 1-6 to your device ports to be disabled. The port often isn't logical (it's physical) but you can get a port mapping with lsusb -t. Once you think you have it, you can test it with:\ncat /sys/bus/usb/devices/1-6/id{Vendor,Product} \n\nThis gives me 0402 and 5602, vendor and product IDs for the right device (as listed in lsusb).\nNow we've found it, turning it off is simple:\necho \"0\" > /sys/bus/usb/devices/1-6/bConfigurationValue\n\nAfter making sure it works as desired, make it load every startup (for example, in /etc/rc.local.)\n\nA: If you want to enable only the external one when it's attached, but have the internal one enabled if the external one isn't attached, here's a script for that. It's based on Wildneuro's answer, but can figure out the device path for you given the ID.\nI use it because some apps I depend on don't seem to offer a way to easily pick your preferred camera. You can easily customize with your own camera IDs (from lsusb).\nCode here: https://gist.github.com/shimon/12cd1080fb8669549aadc2b5408922bc\n", "Q: Can I get an image containing both Ubuntu Desktop and Ubuntu Server? I am a professor teaching operating systems.\nThe students find it convenient to use a GUI in Ubuntu.\nHowever, after installing Ubuntu Server, they have to install Ubuntu Desktop.\nThis requires tremendous downloads and becomes difficult when the whole class wants to do it. If they install the desktop version first, then they need downloads for additional packages.\nIs there any DVD image of Ubuntu 12.04 that allows server installation as well the Ubuntu desktop? From where can I download the same?\n\nA: Just an educated guess here since I'm not experienced with this sort of thing...but a possible solution could be to make your own ISO image which has the packages for both Ubuntu Desktop and Ubuntu Server included.\nYou could do this by using a program like RemasterSys to create an ISO from your hard drive after you installed all the packages you want your students to use, and then they can install Ubuntu using that. This way, only you need to download and install the packages once, and it also has the benefit that you can include or remove other packages as you see fit.\nSee How can I make a live CD/DVD from my harddisk installation? for more information on how to create such a disk image.\n\nA: Simply creating a custom image based on Ubuntu Server with additional applications, including the desktop library components, will meet ALL your requirements.  This is not both, but rather a \"mash-up\" of just what you need.  The components would all be there after initial install.\nI recently did this type of install to test out the HP MicroServer, but I loaded Ubuntu Server, and then added the desktop components as a command-line download.\nNote: I would need to do some research to provide full details (if you require that), for creating the image.\n\nAnother alternative.\nYou could achieve the same result by creating a local cache server for Ubuntu updates, which would not require multiple downloads from the Internet (per student).  \nThis would then allow unlimited alternative setups, all based on command-line recipes ..\n", "Q: How to debug lag using Bluetooth connected mouse and A2DP headset? I own a Logitech M555b mouse for use with my HP Elitebook 8570w laptop running Kubuntu 12.04. Works fine right after connecting using the KDE Bluetooth control module.\nHowever, after some time (seemingly random), it starts to lag. Movements are being delayed for roughly 500ms for a short period of time. Usually it recovers after some time too, but it can take minutes. All actions are being delayed: movements, click, scrolls. Additionally, the movements can be choppy during these times.\nA workaround that always works for the same short period of time is to disconnect an re-connect the mouse. This can be done using the same KDE Bluetooth control module.\nWhat did I try already?\n\n\n*\n\n*Running this at boot time:\necho on > `readlink -f /sys/class/bluetooth/hci0`/../../../power/level\n\nTo disable any power saving features on the Bluetooth hci0 device.\n\n*Check the mouse's batteries (it's just a week old, other new batteries: same result)\n\n*Checking logs and kernel messages about Bluetooth-related entries: none aside the expected messages on connect time.\n\n*I'm running kernel 3.5.0-13-generic as provided in the xorg-edgers PPA. Booting the regular 3.2 Precise kernel results in the same behaviour.\n\n\nSome other information that may help:\n\n\n*\n\n*It happens when no other Bluetooth connections are active on the machine.\n\n*Similar symptoms also occur on my Bluetooth stereo (A2DP) headset, but then it's audio lagging and skipping. Swapping Bluetooth profiles as described here then helps. Conclusion: it's not the mouse that's faulty.\n\n*The headset always worked fine using my now dead Thinkpad T61p with built-in Bluetooth.\n\n*The bluetooth module in my laptop is connected via USB and shows up as\n0a5c:21e1 Broadcom Corp. \n\n\n*Turning the built-in Bluetooth adapter off and using another one works fine, without lag.\n0a5c:2046 Broadcom Corp. Bluetooth Device\n\nI'm mobile and several people around me are using Bluetooth at work (A2DP mostly). It also occurs at home, where my neighbours are probably using Bluetooth as well. It could just be radio interference, but I think Bluetooth connections should just hop to another channel. And, moreover, it just works properly instantly when re-connecting.\nTherefore I think it's a software driver issue and I'd like to debug it. Is there any way to get more verbose logging on the Bluetooth(-hid) modules?\n\nA: You could try using the hcidump utility from the package bluez-hcidump to monitor your bluetooth devices and gain in-depth information:\nsudo apt-get install bluez-hcidump\n\nIn the package description, it is noted that:\n\nThe hcidump utility allows the monitoring of Bluetooth activity.\n   It provides a disassembly of the Bluetooth traffic and can display\n   packets from higher level protocols such as RFCOMM, SDP and BNEP.\n\nYou can use the utility to log the output from your device to screen or file; where hciX is your own bluetooth device (hci0 is the default and used if you don't specify anything with -i), you can run:\nsudo hcidump -x -i hciX\n\nYou can save the dump to file by appending to the command -w ~/output, and if you specifically want to know about the audio data you can use the -A switch and thereby extract SCO audio data, although in this case you must always specify an output file:\nsudo hcidump -x -A -i hciX -w ~/output\n\nYou can view a saved dump file by using \nsudo hcidump -r ~/output\n\nThere are a lot more specific options that you might want to investigate; you can filter by packet type if you want, as by default all packets are dumped. Please see man hcidump or the Ubuntu manpages online for more information.\nThe only other option is to install wireshark and see if it can detect your devices; if it can, it will be able to analyse usb and bluetooth traffic, as noted here, but hcidump should give better results. \n\nA: I've had some luck using USB tracing to solve strange audio problems. Sometimes you can determine something from the content, or the timing of packets. In my case it was an occasional change in the packet length corresponding to noise I was hearing.\nHere's a page from Wireshark that provides some information.\nYou can get a trace simply by doing the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo modprobe usmon\n\n*cd /sys/kernel/debug/usb/usbmon\n\n*sudo cat 0u | tee ~/myusbtrace > /dev/null\n\n*run your test\n\n*kill the process from step 3\n\n\nHere is information from the linux project about this, including how to  narrow down what you are tracing.\nThe second column appears to contain the time, so you should keep a careful watch on how it increments. If it starts smooth and later gets jumpy the problem may be in the bluetooth section. \nIf the trace shows irregular packets when there is a problem that could be either USB or bluetooth, but the direction of the irregular packets may indicate whether it is the kernel or driver rather than something on the other side of the USB bus.\n", "Q: What is the equivalent of the \"tracert\" DOS command? tracert is a command in MS-DOS command prompt to trace the route to an IP Address.\nIs there any command in the Gnome Terminal equivalent to this?\n\nA: As an alternative to traceroute, you might use mtr, it's like traceroute on steroids.\nFrom the package description:\nmtr combines the functionality of the 'traceroute' and 'ping' programs in a single network diagnostic tool.\nAs mtr starts, it investigates the network connection between the host mtr runs on and a user-specified destination host. After it determines the address of each network hop between the machines, it sends a sequence ICMP ECHO requests to each one to determine the quality of the link to each machine.

Hence, if you are a Ubuntu lover, you may consider learning it instead of traceroute or mtr.\nmtr, in the other hand is widely used by collocation providers because additional features \nthat may be very useful while tracking problems, while traceroute has a very suggestive name that is easy to remember. \n\nA: Install the traceroute package via terminal by running:\nsudo apt-get install traceroute\n\nAfter that, type this in the terminal:\ntraceroute [ip/web-site domain]\n\nFor example:\ntraceroute 8.8.8.8\n\nyou can also use web-sites as well:\ntraceroute www.sitename.com\n\n\nA: traceroute, traceroute6, tracepath perform this task. They are executable programs installed in Unix systems (somewhere in /usr/bin/, or /bin/, or /usr/sbin/, or /sbin/ -- the last two are not in the PATH for a normal user, only for root). They are independent of any terminal package.\n\nA: I believe this has changed. You no longer type the traceroute command line with the \"ip/website url\" configuration. Instead you will need to type:\ntraceroute <websiteinquestion.com (org, net, gov, whatever)>\n\nI don't know why this has been simplified but after attempting to find a solution as to why Hulu.com was freezing up on me it was suggested to try a traceroute command.

I can't use 'Additional Drivers' since I'm not connected to a network nor have the driver.\nSo what can I do? I'm new so if someone can explain in detail I would be grateful.\n\nA: Your question is quite similar to \"How can I install and download drivers without internet?\", but only regarding a different networking device.\nHowever, I think this is not going to solve your problem, since your device should be supported out of the box by the ath9k driver included in Ubuntu.

I have a LAN of IPv6 enabled hosts. I would like to setup a ubuntu as DNSv6 server for the local LAN addresses (there is no internet/tunneling stuff).\nI could manually edit the etc/hosts file for each host, but I think a local DNSv6 server would be more efficent. Any suggestion?\nEDIT: I found that dnsmasq solves brilliantly my problem; however since by default is running with a lot o paramenters including -no-resolv (this is probabily because the host IPv4 configuration), I need to stop and restart it manually. Can this be avoided?\n\nA: First: you don't need to run a separate DNS server on IPv6. Your DNS server doesn't even have to listen to requests over IPv6 to answer with AAAA records. So you can even use DNS and make IPv6 connections while doing all DNS resolving over IPv4. It's not more or less efficient.\nOf course, actually doing everything including resolving over IPv6 is much cooler :-)\nMaking BIND listen to queries on IPv6 is easy (and other DNS servers will be similar):\noptions {\n    listen-on-v6 {\n        any;\n    };\n};\n\nThen you will have to let your clients know that they can do DNS resolving over IPv6. Usually you do this with DHCPv6, but you can also include the information in the Router Advertisements. What your client will use depends on the operating system they run.\nDHCPv6 can be used in two ways: stateful and stateless. The stateless setup gives all clients extra information like DNS resolvers etc. without actually doing all the difficult work like assigning addresses and maintaining a leases database. An example configuration for the dibbler DHCPv6 server (again, other DHCP servers will be similar):\niface eth0 {\n    stateless\n    option dns-server 2001:db8:0:1::53\n    option domain example.com, test1.example.com\n}\n\nThen you need to let your clients know that there is a stateless DHCPv6 server available on the network. We also include the DNS information for clients that want it this way instead of through DHCPv6 (yes, it's annoying there are two ways to set the same settings, but that's the way it is). I use RAdvD here:\ninterface eth0 {\n    AdvSendAdvert on;\n    AdvDefaultPreference high;\n    AdvManagedFlag off;\n    AdvOtherConfigFlag on;\n    prefix 2001:db8:0:1::/64 {};\n    RDNSS 2001:db8:0:1::53 {};\n    DNSSL example.com test1.example.com {};\n};\n\nNow the RA tells the client the DNS settings (if it can understand them here) and it tells the client that there is a stateless DHCPv6 server present (managed off, other-config on) and the DHCPv6 server provides the DNS settings as well (for clients that expect them here). The DNS server listens to both IPv4 and IPv6 and can answer all requests via either protocol. The answers (A and/or AAAA records) tell the client what they can use to connect. Most clients will prefer IPv6 (the AAAA answer) when they can.\nPS: Replace 2001:db8:0:1::53 with the real IPv6 address of your DNS server of course.\n", "Q: How can I change the standard files in nautilus? I don't like the standard files in Nautilus (the ordering by data types - Images, Music, Videos, Documents etc.), how can I change this or can I change this ordering without getting problems with several software or Ubuntu one?\n\nA: You might use xdg-user-dirs to set up user directories.\nhttp://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/xdg-user-dirs\nYour directories are stored in ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs\nxdg-user-dirs man page is readable at http://www.unix.com/man-page/OpenSolaris/1/xdg-user-dir/\n", "Q: Nautilus and file command in 11.04 don't show metadata for WebM files The file-name extension .webm is used for media files using the WebM multimedia format, which consists of the WebM container (a subset of the Matroska container) and audio and video streams with independet enconding and quality settings.\nDescription of the issue:\nFor files in the WebM format, the program file says that files are raw data, instead of determining and displaying the real file-format, which is WebM. Besides, Nautilus doesn't display the technical metadata of files in this format.\nWhy is the file program not displaying the file format for WebM files?\n\nA: The short answer is: yes, it is supported. At least on Ubuntu 12.04, when I download a WebM video, I get\nuser@machine:~$ wget http://www.808.dk/pics/video/gizmo.webm\n(...output truncated...)\nSaving to: `gizmo.webm'\n(...output truncated...)\nuser@machine:~$ file gizmo.webm \ngizmo.webm: WebM\nuser@machine:~$\n\nIt might be that your files are not correctly encoded and do not contain the magic numbers at the beginning of the file that allow to determine the file type. Maybe you could give us links to files that are not correctly identified by the file utility, or otherwise state how you created them.\nEDIT: The Ubuntu version of the OP is 11.04 and apparently does not contain an up to date magic file recognizing WebM as a valid file format, possibly due to the fact that at time of 11.04 release the WebM was barely a year old. The magic file from 12.04 correctly recognizes the format.\n\nA: Just for your consideration: Parts of this answer comes from: Is there an application that will render the popular web video formats? which links to: Reduce avi size without losing too much quality \n\nThe FileInfo.com webpage related to \"Video Formats\" provides an\n  extensive and really comprehensive list of video formats, its\n  available software which can be used to play each one and the\n  \"popularity\".\nYou may also wish to take a look to the \"Digital Container format\" and\n  the table of \"Comparison of container formats\".\n\nBased on that information, we find that: \n\n[The Webm file format is a] Compressed video file created using the\n  WebM format, an open, high-quality video standard; stores video\n  compressed using VP8 technology and audio compressed using Ogg Vorbis\n  compression; commonly used for delivering online videos using the\n  HTML5  tag.\nThe WEBM container format is based on the Matroska container, which\n  stores Matroska video in .MKV files. Most major Web browsers will\n  support WebM as part of HTML5 video delivery. WebM is an alternative\n  to the patented h.264 and MPEG4 standards, and is suitable for\n  commercial and non-commercial applications.\nNOTE: Google acquired ON2, the original developer of VP8 technology.\n  VP8 is now an open and free technology.\n\nNevertheless, the information that seems to be lacking in such file format may be related  to the metadata/tags, which is well known that the file format doesn't give any support for such elements, thus the information won't appear. See the table of \"Comparison of container formats\" for information related to \"metadata/tags\" in the proper column.\nSo, we can say that Ubuntu isn't giving such \"deteriorating\" image for a per-file-format related issue. Maybe the file format itself is giving a less complex set of information on its own, which isn't Ubuntu blame (nor any other OS).\nGood luck!\n\nA: If you want to extract info from multimedia formats like WebM, Matroska and others you have a variety of tools to choose from.\nMediaInfo\nMediaInfo is a project dedicated to providing a tool that displays the most relevant technical and tag meta data for video and audio files in a unified way for the plethora of formats out there.

Remember that these\n# private subnets will also need\n# to know to route the OpenVPN client\n# address pool (10.8.0.0/255.255.255.0)\n# back to the OpenVPN server.\npush \"route 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0\"\n;push \"route 192.168.20.0 255.255.255.0\"\n\nBut still no luck, I still get a 10.8.0.x address...\nI've also read I may have to add routes to the router itself, but haven't tried that.\nAny help appreciated, thanks!\n\nA: This is an option: http://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/documentation/miscellaneous/76-ethernet-bridging.html . \nAnother option is to route Lan clients to your VPN clients and viceversa, VPN clients should route your Lan network through your VPN server; and your Lan clients should route your VPN network through your VPN server.\n\nAdd this to your Lan clients (replace 192.168.1.254 with your LAN server IP address)\n\nroute add -net 10.8.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 192.168.1.254\n\nYour VPN clients should get the route automatically with the line from your config\n\npush \"route 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0\"\n\n", "Q: Difference between gnome-screensaver-command -a and gnome-screensaver-command -l I was trying to figure out difference between \ngnome-screensaver-command -a\n\nand \ngnome-screensaver-command -l\n\nAccording to the gnome-screensaver-command man page...\n-l, --lock                 Tells the running screensaver process to lock the screen immediately\n-a, --activate             Turn the screensaver on (blank the screen)\n\nFor me in both the cases it generated the login screen.Can some one outline the difference in the two things??\n\nA: I think that depends on the gnome-screensaver settings. \n\n\n*\n\n*If you set your gnome screensaver not to lock the screen, than the -a option will not lock the screen. \n\n*If you set your gnome screensaver to lock the screen, then -a will lock it; this is the default setting in Ubuntu as far as I remember. \n\n*Option -l, however, will always lock it.\n\n\nA: The help is accurate.

add these. My housemate told me to create an OCN connection but I'm not sure if that's a name of a type of network or just the Japanese company... but after looking at her computer we found it to be a PPPoE connection. After some googling I learned that to create a PPPoE connection I would need to create a DSL connection and that I could add a password & username to it. I also changed the \"Wired\" connection to not connect automatically.\nI get the same problem if I hook up to the modem directly.\nI've tried changing the DSL MTU to 500, 1500, 1492 and 1482 but it didn't make a difference.\nAlso for some reason Ubuntu doesn't always pick up the connection, I sometimes have to restart for it to connect. \n\nA: Here are a couple of things to try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check your network card settings. Neither of your eth interfaces are showing IPv4 addresses. Make sure you have IPv4 turned on (you may need to re-establish your connection with your router to renew the IP). If that doesn't work, try turning off IPv6 support and see if that makes a difference. Do this by right clicking the networking icon by your clock (when on an Ethernet connection, it's a pair of arrows, one pointing up, the other down) and selecting \"Edit Connections...\". In the \"IPv4 Settings\" tab, make sure it's set to \"Automatic (DHCP)\". If you want to turn off IPv6, go to its tab and set it to \"Ignore\".\n\n*Check to see if you can connect to the sites using other methods. What does ping respond with for the sites you can't connect to? How about a traceroute (you may have to install traceroute to use it, FYI)? Their responses might help you troubleshoot the issue. If they can't get to the URL's servers, then it might be a DNS issue (however, if they can get to the URL's servers, but are then dropped, it might just mean those commands are blocked).\n\n*Bypass the router. If your router and your modem are two different machines, try hooking up your computer directly to your modem and seeing if that changes anything.\n\n*Restart your modem and router. Sometimes, they just suck.\n\n*Restart your computer. Sometimes, they just suck.\n\n*Try a different computer. If you have one, does another computer work where this one fails? If not, then it might be something with your specific computer.\n\n*Clear your computer's cache, cookies, etc. Sometimes, bad sessions cookies, cache, etc. can interfere with connecting to a site (I had this issue with Google a while back). Clear them out and start fresh and see what you get.\n\n*Disconnect any VPN connections. Point-to-Point protocol is often used for VPN (the PPP interface), and VPNs can interfere with connecting to sites. Make sure you aren't connected by right clicking your network icon by your clock, finding the \"VPN Connections\" entry and making sure no listing are checked (if you don't have a \"VPN Connections\" menu item, then you don't have one set up). If there are any checked, then you're connected to it, disconnect from it.\nRemember: Not everything you do will result in a simple \"work or fail,\" any change in the reaction of the server to your request will tell us something. So, if you do any of the above and get a new message, don't forget to update your question.\n\nA: I have seen this behaviour twice in practice for which I have found the following solutions.\n\n\n*\n\n*Some computer in the local network was successfully attempting a man-in-the-middle attack. It was ARP-spoofing the gateway, thus redirecting all traffic to go through this machine, modifying requests and other nasty stuff. The machine was running Windows and found to be infected with some nasty malware. As soon as this machine was disconnected from the network physically, symptoms vanished.\n\n*An MTU problem on your or another gateway. In IPv4 gateways are responsible for fragmenting and re-assembling IP packets on the network if the frame size of the networks it's routing traffic for isn't the same. For DSL connections using PPPoE/PPPoA the MTU size is usually smaller than the 1500 bytes at the LAN side. Also routers in between fail and you need to enable TCP MSS Clamping on your router. I always needed to set this on the connection of my previous ISP, but it was resolving more than just SSL-related issues. Check if your modem/router has such an option. Consider this to be a workaround.\n\n*I was in a network probably running a transparent proxy to also pass SSL traffic, but failing at TLSv1 for some reason. The same request worked when using a VPN connection. scaryTry running curl with the option --sslv3. If that solves it, then it stinks.\n\n\nGeneral stuff to try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check if you're running the latest firmware on your modem/router. If not, try upgrading.\n\n*Capture the traffic using tcpdump or Whireshark and get it analysed (post it here for example).\n  # 1. start the dump\n$ sudo tcpdump -w httpstrafficdump.pcap -i eth0 -s 0 port 443\n  # 2. open a new terminal window and do your HTTPS request there (curl/browser)\n  # 3. end tcpdump (Ctrl+C)\n  # 4. open the file in wireshark\n$ wireshark httpstrafficdump.pcap\n\nIf you're getting Reassembling errors or Previous segment lost repeatedly, this is a clear sign about packet loss caused by a wrong MTU size.However, HTTPS traffic is encrypted and hard to analyse from network traffic by itself.\nEdit:\nFrom your tcpdump the root of your SSL problem is clear: TCP Previous segment lost. General networking troubleshooting should apply here, but it may be outside the scope of your local network and a problem with your ISP.\n\nA: This is an old question, but for those getting here via Google, this will help.  The issue is fragmentation on SSL is bad, and breaks the protocol. If you are using PPPOE, the normal MTU in your router/DSL/Cable modem is 1492.  That is too high, and will cause fragmentation. 1476 is the magic number that will work with the most sites.  Some sites use different SSL implementations so 1480 may work, or even 1488.  For the MOST compatibility, the MTU on the WAN side of your network device (router, modem, etc) should be 1476.\n\nA: Hi everybody this IS marcovaleriof from Italy, recently we had a problem similar to yours: all our Linux machine could'n Connect anymore to any https website while Android or Windows Device had no issue. \nThe trouble was an mtu disalignement between our DSL router which had a 1492 mtu length and the default Linux mtu which IS 1500.\nAs a matter of facts issuing this command as root\nifconfig wlan0 mtu 1492 up\n\n(in English this set The mtu value of the net interface - wlan0 in My case - to 1492 length) has get rid of the problem, thank you!\nHope this could help someone. \n\nA: Thanks for all your help , the problem is finally fixed!\nI was trying to limit the MTU to see if it would help and ended up using pppoeconf to set up the PPPoE connection since it limits the MTU for me.

I added to following line to the \"~/.bash_aliases\" file:\nalias svngrep='grep -R $1 ./* --exclude-dir \".svn\"'\n\nbut it's not working.\nIt outputs (in my translation to English):\nsvngrep test\ngrep: test: File or directory not found\n\nBut with the full \"grep\" line it works just fine.\nAny idea what's wrong with my alias?\n\nA: $1 does not work in an alias. You need to define a function for that, for example in your .bashrc file.\nfunction svngrep { grep -R --exclude-dir=\".svn\" \"$@\" . ; }\n\nThis should do the trick! However, make sure that your old alias is not around before trying it out from the command line:\nunalias svngrep\nfunction svngrep { grep -R --exclude-dir=\".svn\" \"$@\" . ; }\nsvngrep \"teststring\"\n\nQuoting bash manual:\n\nThere  is  no  mechanism  for  using  arguments  in the replacement text.  If arguments are needed, a shell function should be used (...) For almost every purpose, aliases are superseded by shell functions.\n\n\nA: You don't need a bash function (you may use it though, matter of taste), just remove the $1 ./* from your example and call it this way:\nalias svngrep='grep -R --exclude-dir \".svn\"'\nsvngrep phrase .\n\nor here's an example I've been using for months:\nalias rg='rgrep --exclude-dir=.svn --exclude=*.pyc'\nrg phrase .\n\nOf course, you can substitute . with any directory.

I had issues with WiFi so I removed Network Manager. \nI booted Windows OS (dual booting Windows 7 and 12.04) to download  wicd 1.7.2.4. Extracted it and  installed. However, wcid worked properly with Wired Connection but could not connect to WiFi. So, I re-installed Network Manager which works properly now, and wicd connects to WiFi too. \nAs soon as I disconnect from Network Manager, wicd connects only to wired. At this point, I wanted to remove wicd but apt-get returns no wicd installed, can't see it in Synaptic or Software Center, but only in Applications list under Dash home. \nOf course wcid icon shows connections, and  resulting connected, so my system shows both applets for wicd and network manager in the top panel. When running dpkg commands, wicd is not listed as installed package. \nAny suggestion how to remove wicd? Consider that I started with Ubuntu just few months ago so my knowledge base is limited.\n\nA: have you installed it from source? you can't use synaptic or software center to remove wicd then.\nBy the way, you should look for a startup script, to remove wicd from startup. Then you will not need to uninstall, it won't get started if you remove it. Check /etc/rc5.d and /etc/xdg/autostart for entries. (I assume you boot to gui)\n\nA: Since I also had problems with Wicd + NetworkManager, it had to be decided which one will disappear from the OS, as it seems both interfaces do a sloppy job when it comes to deal with dependencies and side effects.\nFirst I decided to remove Wicd, and that should match your question (then I tried Wicd without NM, but that's another story...).\nNormally, if installed from a package (apt-get), the line\nsudo apt-get purge wicd\n\nshould be enough. If not, and installed from the source, there is a uninstall.sh in wicd-dir/ source code dir that should fix the uninstallation. If not... \n\n\n*\n\n*the theory wants that editing\n/etc/default/wicd\nand set START_DAEMON=no would be enough of a job to just stop the process and family from starting. But it's not enough. So... when a program is tied to several places that don't rely on a single config file, I remove it completely:  (it's also linked to my own gnome configuration, and yours may vary)\n\n\n*ensure the init program does not run\n\n\nThat's basically in /etc/rcX.d. All the S20wicd can be renamed K00wicd automatically, thanks to a script like rcconf.\nAnd now remove the crumbs...\n\n\n*move the desktop autostart stuff\n\n\nSomething like\nmv /etc/xdg/autostart/wicd-tray.desktop /etc/xdg/wicd-tray.desktop.donotstart\n\n\n\n*dbus\n\n\nSimilar to the above \nmv /etc/dbus-1/system.d/wicd.conf /etc/dbus-1/wicd.conf.donotstart\n\nAnd reboot, wicd should be quieter.\nAgain depending on your settings, the files could be somewhere else in /etc.\nDo a find /etc -iname \"*wicd*\" to find where they're likely to sit.\n", "Q: I screwed up my icons with MyUnity I wanted MyUnity specifically for the ability to have more than 4 virtual desktops, that is really all that I absolutely needed it for.

They use a swap file by default.\nOriginal Answer\nBoot windows and delete the 100GB partition (L:) and try again. Ubuntu needs to create at least two partitions, \"/\" in ext4 format and \"swap\" in it's own format in place of (L:) during installation. It will find the unused space and do what is needed.\nYou can also choose \"Something else\" during installation and manually create these partitions.

I doesn't like to disclose them to anyone. Whenever i lke to view them, I mount them using CryptKeeper. I need to include these photos in Shotwell photo manager at the time of mounting. So, I mounted them using CryptKeeper. Then I imported them to Shotwell. I made a new event and etc to organize and view those photos. After that I unmounted them using CryptKeeper because someone may see it. Now I don't want any single trail on Shotwell beacuse of the same problem. But there is a new button 'MissingFiles' appeared and when i clicked on it, all the photo thumbnail which i unmounted showed there. I dont't want right'click on them and select 'remove from library'; beacuse when i want to view them next time on Shotwell, I need to import, organize, etc at that time. So, the only option here is to disable the unavailability of that MisssingFiles button.\n\nA: With Shotwell you could use an alternative library for your 'secret' pictures, which would also leave the default .shotwell folder in your home folder intact. You would only need to remove shotwell.log in ~/.cache/shotwell to eliminate evidence that this different library had been opened. It is safe to remove this log file as it is generated automatically whenever shotwell is run. This log file is all I have in .cache after using Shotwell, just one file and no other thumbnail database (even with display hidden files on).\nUsing cryptkeeper, I wish to store the secret shotwell library in my encrypted folder, so I mount my encrypted folder (called secret) and point shotwell towards that folder when I launch it:\nshotwell -d /home/mike/misc/secret\n\nNow I import my pictures from my encrypted folder and the library will stay in my encrypted folder. This is the standard command that lets you select an alternative library location for shotwell, while retaining the default one unaltered. Each time you load up your encrypted folder and run the shotwell command your library will be ready to use. Now if you do it this way everytime, there will be no missing file warnings.\nNow when you unmount your cryptkeeper folder you can run shotwell again as normal and it will load your default library (just see my note above about removing the shotwell log if you want to cover your tracks).\nNOTE: for Shotwell 0.13 and above, you will have to launch the program with a bash wrapper script when using it with cryptkeeper or truecrypt, as the .cache thumbnail folder needs also to be kept private. So, something like this should launch Shotwell- point the cache and shotwell to your encrypted folder or volume:\n#!/bin/bash\nexport XDG_CACHE_HOME=/media/truecrypt6/shotwell\nshotwell -d /media/truecrypt6/shotwell\n\n", "Q: Copy LAMP in another computer I've LAMP installed in my laptop.

However, the \"Path\" is not quoted, because it seems that it is quoted by the program reading the file. I tried it from the start menu and using gtk-launch in the command-line, both ended up working in this format but did not work when the Path was quoted too:\n❯ gtk-launch \"Torchlight II\"\ngtk-launch: error launching application: Failed to change to directory “\"/home/janek/.steam/steam/steampps/common/Torchlight II\"” (No such file or directory)\n\n\nA: What worked for me is replacing spaces with a single underscore (that's 1 underscore for multiple consecutive spaces) in the [Desktop Entry]'s Icon value.\nNo need to remove the spaces from the file directory.\nAlso do not enclose the Icon value in quotes.\n\n\n", "Q: How do I re-enable shadow in Lubuntu 11.10? Does anybody know how to re-enable shadow effects in Lubuntu 11.10??\nIt was enabled at first (without any extra tool), but somehow I managed to disable it. Unfortunately I can't remember how!\n\nA: Lubuntu doesn't have shadow effects by default. If you look at the Lubuntu website screenshots, none of them have shadow effects. Sorry.\nIf you do want shadows, you have a few options. The lightest weight option is to install xcompmgr. Here is the \"how-to.\"\nFirst, let's install xcompmgr. In the terminal, type: \nsudo apt-get install xcompmgr\n\nHowever, installing xcompmgr is useless unless you set it to autostart at login. This part is a bit trickier. The simple method is to create a .desktop file and place it in the directory ~/.config/autostart. Hint: if you don't know how to show hidden files, simply press \"[CONTROL]+h\".\nCopy-paste the following into the desktop file:\n[Desktop Entry]\nEncoding=UTF-8\nType=Application\nName=xcompmgr\nName[en_US]=xcompmgr\nExec=xcompmgr -c -C -t-5 -l-5 -r4.2 -o.55 &\nStartupNotify=true\n\nWhen you're finished, your autostart directory should look similar to this:\n\nYou might have other items or less items in this directory, but you should at least see the xcompmgr file.\nOne final note about shadows.

I use SpiderOak for online backup and file synchronisation (a la Dropbox.) I'm running it on my headless server via the SpiderOak --headless command.\nAt the moment, I have to start this manually inside a screen session to keep it running. This means I have to remember to start my backup software each time I restart the server (not ideal.)\nHow can I start SpiderOak automatically with the rest of the system processes? (For extra points, how can I monitor it to make sure it stays alive?)\nI've tried adding a spideroak.conf file to the Upstart services in /etc/init as shown below, but it fails to start because SpiderOak needs to run as my normal user account (not root.)\nroot@helios:~/.SpiderOak# cat /etc/init/spideroak.conf\ndescription \"The SpiderOak automatic cloud backup service.\"\n\n# Start when system starts.\nstart on runlevel [2345]\nstop on runlevel [!2345]\n\nexec SpiderOak --headless\n\n\nA: This is what I use in order to get SpiderOak to automatically start after a reboot on my headless server (Ubuntu 12.04).  I use cron with the following entry:\n@reboot /sbin/start-stop-daemon -b -x /usr/bin/SpiderOak -S -- --headless\n\nchecking the syslog I can confirm it starts up and using top I can confirm its running after reboot.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: How to print standard error in red How can i print the standard error in red into the console instead of using the same color of the standard output?\nIs it possible using Gnome Terminal ?\n\nA: I  use stderred and have found it a good solution. As its readme notes:\n\nStderred hooks on write() and a family of stream functions (fwrite, fprintf, error...) from libc in order to colorize all stderr output that goes to terminal thus making it distinguishable from stdout. Basically it wraps text that goes to file with descriptor \"2\" with proper ANSI escape codes making text red.\nIt's implemented as a shared library and doesn't require recompilation of existing binaries thanks to preload/insert feature of dynamic linkers.\nIt's supported on Linux (with LD_PRELOAD), FreeBSD (also LD_PRELOAD) and OSX (with DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES).\n\nIt is straightforward to compile, but you do need to build it from source by following the instructions from its Github site:\nsudo apt-get install build-essential git cmake \n\nThen\ngit clone git://github.com/sickill/stderred.git\ncd stderred\n\nThen\nmake\n\nThe most important part of it is to add the appropriate line to your .bashrc; you must link to the libstderred.so file in the build directory; you must use the absolute path where the build directory is (/home/mike/src/stderred/build). I add the following to my .bashrc:\nexport LD_PRELOAD=\"/home/mike/src/stderred/build/libstderred.so${LD_PRELOAD:+:$LD_PRELOAD}\"\n\nObviously, when you don't want to use it anymore, remove the above line from your .bashrc and restart the terminal.\nThe results, tested on non-existent files (it obviously will not work when sudo is used, as the user's .bashrc will not be read when the different environment is set):\n(By the way it doesn't turn my duke@nukem prompt red as that was red already)\n\n\nA: In general yes, since Gnome Terminal is an ANSI terminal and supports the standard ANSI escape codes.\nHere is an example. Type this in your terminal:\necho -e \"\\e[01;31mREDRUM\\e[0m\"\n\nThe -e option allows to interpret backslash codes, so that \\e becomes \"Esc\" (hex code 0x1B). Alternatively, to enter escape directly, press ctrl-V Esc:\necho  \"^[[01;31mREDRUM^[[0m\"\n\nEscape and [ both form together the code that is recognized by the terminal. After that sequence, you need to insert a colon (;) separated list of attributes, terminated by m. See here for all the codes. Examples include attribute 0 (reset all attributes, as you might notice above that is the sequence that terminates my example) and a bunch of style (underlined, bright, bold etc.) as well as a few color attributes.\nThe answer above tells you how to use color when you write your own program.\nHowever, if I understand your question correctly, you would like to have a visual separation for stderr and stdout of any programs you are running. This is not straightforward without parsing their output through a filter. Here is an example (found here) how to do it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Define a function (you can put it in your .bashrc file):\ncolor() { \"$@\" 2>&1>&3|sed 's,.*,\\x1B[31m&\\x1B[0m,'>&2; } 3>&1\n\n\n*Start programs like this:\ncolor program\n\nThe stderr from the programs will get colored red.\n", "Q: YouTube videos on Khan Academy do not play I just finished installing Ubuntu.

Simply using | or > will only grab STDOUT, and not STDERR. To grab both, you need to do something like:\npsql -d ... 2>1 | less\nThis will redirect STDERR into STDOUT, and then both should appear in less when you are trying to page through the output.\n\nA: I think dobey and green7 have the better answers for your particular problem, but, for completeness:\nI may get an error or message I didn't expect and not want to run the command again, or don't want to take the time. Therefore whenever I install a new operating system I start the gnome-terminal, go to Edit->Preferences->Scrolling Tab, and click the unlimited scrolling checkbox.\nWhen using a kernel virtual console you can scroll back with Shift-PageUp.\nWhen using less|more, or not using either, I sometimes find it easier to understand messages if I widen the terminal screen to be big enough horizontally to hold most of the message to eliminate line folding.\n", "Q: Xubuntu - Download Error with Wubi 09-17 13:01 DEBUG  CommonBackend: Could not find any ISO or CD, \ndownloading one now 09-17 13:01 DEBUG  TaskList: New task get_metalink\n09-17 13:01 DEBUG  TaskList: ### Running get_metalink...\n09-17 13:01 DEBUG  downloader: downloading\nhttp://cdimage.ubuntu.com/xubuntu/releases/12.04/release/xubuntu-12.04-desktop-amd64.metalink \nC:\\ubuntu\\install\n09-17 13:01 ERROR  CommonBackend: Cannot download metalink file\nhttp://cdimage.ubuntu.com/xubuntu/releases/12.04/release/xubuntu-12.04-desktop-amd64.metalink\nerr=[Errno 14] HTTP Error 404: Not Found 09-17 13:01 DEBUG \ndownloader: downloading\nhttp://cdimage.ubuntu.com/xubuntu/daily-live/current/precise-desktop-amd64.metalink\nC:\\ubuntu\\install\n09-17 13:01 ERROR  CommonBackend: Cannot download metalink file2\nhttp://cdimage.ubuntu.com/xubuntu/daily-live/current/precise-desktop-amd64.metalink\nerr=[Errno 14] HTTP Error 404: Not Found\n09-17 13:01 DEBUG  TaskList:\nFinished get_metalink\n09-17 13:01 ERROR  TaskList: Cannot download the metalink and therefore the ISO Traceback (most recent call last): \nFile \"\\lib\\wubi\\backends\\common\\tasklist.py\", line 197, in call\nFile \"\\lib\\wubi\\backends\\common\\backend.py\", line 595, in get_iso\nFile \"\\lib\\wubi\\backends\\common\\backend.py\", line 406, in download_iso\nException: Cannot download the metalink and therefore the ISO 09-17\n13:01 DEBUG  TaskList: # Cancelling tasklist 09-17 13:01 DEBUG\nTaskList: # Finished tasklist 09-17 13:01 ERROR  root: Cannot download\nthe metalink and therefore the ISO Traceback (most recent call last): \nFile \"\\lib\\wubi\\application.py\", line 58, in run   File\n\"\\lib\\wubi\\application.py\", line 132, in select_task   File\n\"\\lib\\wubi\\application.py\", line 158, in run_installer   File\n\"\\lib\\wubi\\backends\\common\\tasklist.py\", line 197, in call   File\n\"\\lib\\wubi\\backends\\common\\backend.py\", line 595, in get_iso   File\n\"\\lib\\wubi\\backends\\common\\backend.py\", line 406, in download_iso\nException: Cannot download the metalink and therefore the ISO\nYes Im Connected to the Internet.

Once I got an error in Wubi and later, after a retry, it just went away. However, it seems that Xubuntu in Wubi might have a NASTY bug; if it does not work the 2nd time just report it.\n\nA: It looks like Xubuntu have bumped themselves to 12.04.1 but Wubi is unaware of it. It wouldn't have worked before anyway because Wubi 12.04.1 would have downloaded the Xubuntu 12.04 ISO and then failed (another bug e.g. it's happening on lubuntu here).\nHowever... I don't think Wubi is top of the Xubuntu developers list of priorities, since they've requested that Wubi will no longer support Xubuntu from release 12.10.\nSo... what you can do is - download the Xubuntu 12.04.1 ISO yourself, then run the latest version of Wubi.exe with it in the same folder (and disconnected from the net).\n", "Q: How can I solve my XAMPP issue? I have this type of error when starting XAMPP:\nStarting XAMPP for Linux 1.7.7...\nXAMPP: Another web server daemon is already running.\nXAMPP: Starting MySQL...\nXAMPP: Couldn't start MySQL!\nXAMPP: Another FTP daemon is already running.\nXAMPP for Linux started.\n\nHow can be it solved?? Can any one help me please?\n\nA: XAMPP is a package of several programs like a webserver (Apache), a database server (MySQL) and others. With many of these programs, you can only run one instance at the same time. So if you for example have a webserver running, you cannot start another webserver until you stopped the first one. The same goes for the MySQL server, the FTP server and others. (Technically, you can start several webservers etc. if each of them uses a different port, but I assume you'd want to stick with the standard ports for the beginning).\nThe error messages you provided indicate that when you try to start XAMPP, there already is a webserver, a MySQL server and a FTP server running. So XAMPP can't start an additional webserver, MySQL server or FTP server. So you need to figure out if those servers are actually there, where they came from and if you want to use them or the XAMPP versions.\nThe first test is to point a webbrowser (Firefox, Chrome, Opera, ...) to your local computer without trying to start XAMPP and to check if anything answers. So point your webbrowser to http://localhost. If a website appears, maybe the default \"It works!\" page from Apache, there is already a webserver running and XAMPP can't start an additional one. You can do similar tests with MySQL, the FTP server and the other components of XAMPP. \nIf there is actually a webserver running before you try to start XAMPP, you need to find out where it came from. I see two possibilites: XAMPP is already running, maybe it's tarted automatically at boot time, or the \"standard\" packages of Apache, MySQL etc. are installed and running. There are several ways to check that, one is to temporarely change a detail in the HTML files that one webserver is supposed to deliver. If you for example add a word, say \"TEST\", to the HTML that XAMPPs Apache is supposed to deliver, you can see whether that change appears in the browser or not. You can go on from there.\n", "Q: Trying to run 32bit windows game in wine on 64bit 12.04 I am trying to run Icewind dale2 from GOG.com in wine on ubuntu 12.04 64bit.

I installed Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (Precise Pangolin), 64 bit. Nowhere was I asked to set password for root.\nI just installed AccuRev SCM software. It was installed under the /root folder by default. Now I try do something on that folder. I tried with su to switch to root, but I don't know its password. \nShould I always use sudo or get the default root password, if any?\nHow do I create a launcher for software installed inside the /root directory?\n\nA: By default, the root account is accessed by sudo.\nFor a complete discussion in the topic, and information for how to set a root password, see: RootSudo - Community Ubuntu Documentation\nWith that said, it is extremely unlikely you need to set a root password, I advise you use \nsudo -i\n\nOr for graphical applications, use gksu\ngksu nautilus \n\n\nA: Password for root is not set in Ubuntu which means the root login is disabled by default.\nThe user account created during Ubuntu installation is associated with all sudo capabilities. You could use sudo for commands that require root privileges in Ubuntu terminal. \nHowever you can enable the root account and set a password for it. To do so use:\nsudo passwd root\n\nFirstly you will be asked for your current user password and after this you will be asked for the new password twice (new and retype password) as your new root password.\nFor more information see RootSudo - Community Ubuntu Documentation.\n\nA: By default the Ubuntu installer does not set up a root password and therefore you don't get the ability to log in as root.  Instead you are given the ability to perform tasks with superuser privileges using sudo.\nI've answered a similar question before.\nWhile you can create a password for the root account allowing you to log in as root with su, there are some distinct benefits to using sudo.\nUsing sudo\nSudo is an alternative to giving people a root password in order to perform superuser duties.  In a default Ubuntu install the person who installed the OS is given \"sudo\" permission by default.\nAnybody with \"sudo\" permission may perform something \"as a superuser\" by pre-pending sudo to their command.  For instance, to run apt-get dist-upgrade as a superuser, you could use:\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nBy default, sudo will ask you for your own account password when performing this.  This helps security.  This is remembered for a few minutes so if you have a few tasks to do with sudo it will only ask you for your password on the first.\nYou will see the above usage of sudo pretty much anywhere you read a tutorial about Ubuntu on the web.  It's an alternative to doing this.\nsu\napt-get dist-upgrade\nexit\n\nBenefits\nWith sudo, you choose in advance which users have sudo access. There is no need for them to remember a root password, as they use their own password.  If you have multiple users, you can revoke one's superuser access just by removing their sudo permission, without needing to change the root password and notify everyone of a new password.  You can even choose which commands a user is allowed to perform using sudo and which commands are forbidden for that user.  And lastly, if there is a security breach it can in some cases leave a better audit trail showing which user account was compromised.\nNot having a root password makes brute force attacks on the root account impossible: this is relevant if you allow login over SSH.  Instead, an attacker would need to know a local account name.\nSudo makes it easier to perform a single command with superuser privileges.  With su, you permanently drop to a superuser shell which must be exited using exit or logout.  This can lead to people staying in the superuser shell for longer than necessary just because it's more convenient than logging out and in again later.\nGetting a root shell\nWith sudo, you still have the option of opening a permanent (interactive) superuser shell with the command:\nsudo su\n\n... and this can still be done without any root password, because sudo gives superuser privileges to the su command.\nAnd similarly, instead of su - for a login shell you can use sudo su - or even sudo -i.\nHowever when doing so you just need to be aware that you are acting as a superuser for every command.  It's a good security principle not to stay as a superuser for longer than necessary, just to lessen the possibility of accidentally causing some damage to the system (without it, you can only damage files your user owns).\nJust to clarify, you can, if you choose, give the root user a password allowing logins as root, if you specifically want to do things this way instead.  I just wanted to let you know about the Ubuntu convention of preferring sudo instead and let you know that there is an alternative.\n\nA: While we are at it, If you are trying to log in via ssh into the root account and its giving you back the \"Permission Denied\" look, even after you having updated the root password multiple times over, remember that apart from updating the root password as others have mentioned, you also have to enable the root ssh login in the ssh server config.\nsudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n\nset \nPermitRootLogin yes\n\ndo the restart dance\nservice ssh restart\n\nBamm!!!

I have set up a working pbuilder toolchain for building Debian packages in i386 and amd64 varieties for Ubuntu. I am using reprepro to manage my own private apt repository and dupload to upload .changes, .dsc, .deb, .orig.tar.gz and .debian.tar.gz files into it. All of this is well documented and it works.\nBut I am failing to upload the i386 version of one package together with the amd64 version of the same package. Reprepro complains with the following message:\nFile \"pool/main/p/package/package_1.0.dsc\" is already registered with different checksums!\n\nThe source of the generated i368 and amd64 binary packages are exactly the same and have not been modified by me. How can it be that there is a different checksum?\nI investigated and discovered that the checksum difference of the .dsc file is because it contains a differing checksum of the file package_1.0.debian.tar.gz.\nFurther investigations showed that the package_1.0.debian.tar.gz file has indeed different checksums every time dpkg-buildpackage is invoked by the debian build toolchain. The reason is that it changes the modification time of the /debian subdirectory of a Debian package. The tar program unfortunately includes the modification time into the resulting archive, leading to different checksums every time the toolchain is run.\nSo, my question is: How can I prevent dpkg-buildpackage from modifying the modification date of the /debian directory when building a Debian package?\nIf I could do that, the checksum of the files package_1.0.debian.tar.gz and package_1.0.dsc would stay constant, and I could painlessly upload to reprepro.\n\nA: I'm not in exactly the same situation as you, but hopefully my answer can point to what you need.\nRather than using pbuilder I'm currently using multiple chroots for building packages on amd64 and i386. I generate the .dsc outside of the chroots using debuild -S, then copy the appropriate files to the chroots. Not the best way of doing it I realise.\nInside the first chroot I run dpkg-buildpackage -b to build the binary packages. In the second chroot I run dpkg-buildpackage -B, to only build the architecture dependent packages - i.e. those that aren't duplicated.\nWhen I use reprepro to push the packages to my repo, the .debs from the first chroot (i386) with target \"all\" are copied to all architectures as well as the i386 debs being copied to i386. When I push the packages from the second chroot (amd64), the remaining architecture dependent debs or amd64 are copied across.\n\nA: You could try overriding tar command and adding --mtime=some_fixed_time argument to it.\n\nA: Afaict you can't really.\nThe debian packaging system uses the \"debian\" directory both as a place to store package metadata long term and as a place to store various build artifacts temporarily during the build process. There has been a bunch of work on making the building of Binary packages reproducible, but I haven't heard of any similar efforts for source packages.\nThe proper solution to your errors is to only build the source package and the arch all binary packages once.

Someone who knows how to setup kmail correctly? Nor automatic or hand procedure works.\n\nA: This is not an error of KMail, but from the remote SMTP server it is talking to.\nThe server (MTA) is complaining about your request. Probably you are trying to send mail and using an SMTP server which does not allow relaying in your current configuration.\nSome general solutions to this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Configure SMTP authentication according to the manual of your hosting or freemail provider. Try to find some information like \"mail client configuration settings\". If it's about a corporate mail server: ask your system administrator for SMTP settings for use in your mail client. Use this information to configure your account in KMail.If authenticated to the SMTP server you may have the privileges to get mail relayed out.\n\n*Configure KMail to use your ISP's SMTP relay server. Most ISPs are running one, for example listening to the name smtp.ispname.tld.However, when using another ISPs connection you cannot use the same server, but you'll have to reconfigure it according to use the one of the other ISP. Therefore, the option above is recommended for mobile PCs and should work throughout all networks.\n\n*Try to use Thunderbird's initial configuration wizard. It's quite good at guessing the right configuration options.

I know that using a boot-able partition over 123 GB is not good but what is the max root size allowable? is there a limit?\n\nA: Depends on the filesystem used for /.\nProvided your 'initramfs' can use that filesystem (modules available at boot time), it all depends on which you chose.\n\n\n*\n\n*Ext3: max 16 TiB\n\n*Ext4: max 1 EiB\n\n*XFS: max 16 EiB\n\n**fs: you get the point\n\nA: It depends on the filesystem. The maximum size of a volume of a particular filesystem is given in the Limits section of the appropriate Wikipedia page.\n\nA: In mentioning 123 GB, I think you are referring to the 28 bit limitation on the LBA (Logical Block Address) that can pass over standard IDE equipment. Please see http://www.48bitlba.com/overview.htm It's several years old.\nIt mentions that the next following limit is at 2 TiB, because stored LBA's can only hold 32 bits in basic and extended partitions.\nTo get around the first limit you should be careful about the hardware you install. Presumably current large disks have 48 bit LBA support and I assume current motherboards will support them. Refer to ATA-6.\nTo get beyond the 2TiB limit you should format your disk with GPT rather than the old-fashioned MBR based primary and extended partitions. That allows addressing disk space to 2^73 bytes without changing the current disk sector size.\nBeyond that pick your file system for maximum size, but with an eye toward the features and performance you need for your application(s).\n", "Q: Open Web Browser in Background To open a web browser, I currently use xdg-open inside a python app. However the web browser steals focus.

Since the mount output is regular and delimited by spaces, the above outputs the first and third column, omitting \"on\" and the remainder of the line.\n\nA: Why not use the Gio interface?

Any experiences/advice out there?  Thanks.\n\nA: If you think 12.04 runs too slow, I suggest you run a flavor of Ubuntu more suited to slower computers. My personal favorite is Linux Mint XFCE, it's based on Ubuntu so you'll feel right at home even though it looks slightly different. It comes with a bunch of neat stuff included that are not included in Ubuntu by default, such as Java, non-free codecs and Flash.\nIf you really don't want to move outside the Ubuntu family, there's also Xubuntu. Basically, I suggest you should try running a distro that has XFCE as a desktop environment, which both of the previously mentioned do.\n", "Q: How do I encrypt a dual boot system? I have a dual-boot laptop with four partitions - Windows, swap, Ubuntu (OS) andUbuntu /home. I need to do full disk encryption on it. Ubuntu is running 12.04, Windows is Windows 7 Home Premium.\n\nA: I don't see how to avoid to handle Windows and Ubuntu separately using software.\n\n\n*\n\n*TrueCrypt for Windows installation. For example this \"How To Use TrueCrypt To Encrypt The Whole Windows System\".\n\n*Install Ubuntu using the alternate installer image. I recommend you to use LVM as it makes it possible to have all partitions (then LVs) in one dm-crypt container. It requires a /boot partition but LVM saves you from more. See this article how to do that: \"How to install Ubuntu 11.04 on an encrypted LVM file system\" (while a bit old, still relevant for 12.04).\n\n\nAlternatively, get yourself an expensive Self Encrypting Hard Drive unlocked by your BIOS at boot time, if supported. This way, no configuration is required by your OS and all processing (encrypting/decrypting) is done by the hard drive instead of your CPU.\n", "Q: Terminal insert A B C D on shift+arrows. Solution? I'm new to Ubuntu and I don't know how I did it, but now when I try to select a text with Shift+[left/right]arrow keys, it inserts me \"D C\"(letters). I look up on Google for an hour and I haven't found anything really to help me. \nI have installed Ubuntu with WUBI and I'm speaking about Ctrl+Alt+T terminal.\n\nA: I've found a workaround to copy text from gnome-terminal. It is via screen.  Credit goes to this answer\n\n\n*\n\n*Type screen in the terminal\n\n*Press Ctrl-A-[ to Enter the copy mode\n\n*Move your cursor to the desired start location.\n\n*Hit Enter to start copying.\n\n*Press and hold → or ← key to select text\n\n*Hit Enter again to stop copying.\n\n*Then move your cursor the the location you want to paste.\n\n*Press Ctrl-A-] to paste the text.\nFor a more complete screen tutorial, see this page.\n\nA: OK, here is some historical background. Terminal comes from times from before the ubiquity of the ctrlC and ctrlD shortcuts. In fact, ctrl-C has already had a meaning for a very long time: in a terminal, it is used to interrupt the current foreground process in a terminal. And Ctrl-D is for sending EOF (end of file). \nSee for your self; start a program that would take a lot of time and produce a lot of output, such as find /, and press Ctrl-C to interrupt it. Start a program that expect some input, such as cat > testfile.txt, type some text, and then press Enter (for newline) and Ctrl-D such that the program thinks \"end of file, fine\" and exits.\nMoreover, copy and paste could (and can) be achieved in X in a much simpler way. The moment that you have selected any text with your mouse – just selected, no keys pressed – it has been copied to the X clipboard. Whenever you now press the right mouse button, without any keyboard shortcut, the text will get pasted. No need for shortcuts at all. This works not only in terminal, but also in other programs – try it!\nHowever, you cannot use this method to copy anything other than simple text; to copy graphics, files etc. you need ctrl-c and ctrl-v.\nNonetheless, to achieve some compatibility with the modern dogma, you can use CtrlShiftC and CtrlShiftV in a terminal.\n\nA: I'm pretty sure this is default behaviour; it happens on my terminal, too.  But you can select text with the mouse and then paste it by center-clicking.  This means clicking both the left and right buttons at once!  \nIf you want to select all the text you can do so under Edit --> Select All.  And if you're new to the terminal you can learn more about certain programs with the man command.  For example, man script should give information about a session-recording program that may be interesting to you.\n", "Q: System hangs on video playing Whenever I start playing a video on my ubunt10.10 on players like vlc or totem the whole system hangs abruptly and mouse and keyboard are become unresponsive but audio still plays.\nCan any one please help me..\nThanks...\n\nA: This problem usually occurs when the hard disk drive is having a failure, necessarily physical.\nSomehow the drive is experiencing an issue when trying to get the buffering from the video in the hdd, this can be caused by delays in the hdd and/or bad sectors allocating data. \nFor a test: If the problem is happening exclusively in a single file, please make an exact copy of the file, then try to run the new file, if the problem persist in the new copy then you are experiencing a problem with your codecs (try installing/updating (removing/reinstalling) restricted extras). If you are absolutely sure that there is no problems with the codecs try using a lighter video player (dragon player and gnome player come to my mind).\nIf your problem is happening with whatever video you choose from your hard disk drive, then you may be experiencing a major problem with the delays on your hard disk drive. Then I will recommend the usage of a tool like HDD Regenerator in order to check the HDD performance and determine if there are sectors failing/delaying and they can be recovered.\nWARNING! The usage of tools like HDD Regenerator will result in the loss of data if you run the process directly in the HDD without backing up/cloning your partitions/disks. Make sure you do a complete BACKUP/CLONING before running this tool.\nHDD Regenerator will erase everything in your hard disk drive in order to do the needed changes so you can redo from start again.\nBased on your comments to this answer I can change parts of this in order to provide further support.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Boot Menu Start up OS selection issue After installing 12.04 and restarting the laptop, I kept getting a blank screen.

Buffers / cache can be freed on a moment's notice, so they don't really count as \"not available\" memory in the System Monitor, but they also are not, strictly speaking, free memory.\nFrom the point of view of the user, \"available\" memory is more important. Linux will max out the buffers / cache to speed up the system, but that does not mean that your mem is full and that system slows down due to lack of available memory.\n\nA: Have a look on the second line of the free output in your screenshot.\nThis is labeled \"-/+ buffers/cache:\"\nWhere you find the equivalent values.\nFor more information see e.g. http://www.redhat.com/advice/tips/meminfo.html\n\nBuffers: Memory in buffer cache. mostly useless as metric nowadays\nCached: Memory in the pagecache (diskcache) minus SwapCache\nSwapCache: Memory that once was swapped out, is swapped back in but still also is in the swapfile (if memory is needed it doesn't need to be swapped out AGAIN because it is already in the swapfile. This saves I/O)\n\n", "Q: Installing a .cer file I have a cert.cer certificate file for my Mozilla Firefox. I don't have any clue how to go about installing it for my system.

I read somewhere that if you want to format it with a 32kb cluster size, this is the command:\nmkdosfs /dev/sdx -s 64 -F 32 -I\nBut, what if I want to format it with a 64kb cluster size? How can I do it? Can someone explain the proper usage of mkdosfs /dev/sdx -s XX in plain words (I'm not a native english speaker)?\n\nA: I believe the command is:\nsudo mkdosfs /dev/sdXX -s 128 -F 32 \n\nSince you want 64KB clusters, and the -s means sectors per cluster so, you need 128 sectors, because 128*512 byes = 64KB, making a cluster. \nIf you want the whole disk to contain a single partition, you would use -I option.

I am planning to buy an external hard-drive to backup my critical data. I was wondering if I could get it from Ubuntu shop :- \nAny ideas which external hard-drives are compatible with ubuntu. \n\nA: All external disk drives should work but there are a few factors to consider:\n\n\n*\n\n*Bus type. If it's USB2 I'd bet years of my life on it working. USB3 drives are a bit more hit and miss but only because some chipsets have dodgy drivers (something time tends to fix). USB3 also requires you to have a USB3 port. Firewire should work.\n\n*Filesystem. Most big drives will come preformatted to ntfs (for use in Windows). That's fine and you can carry on using it like that if you wish but it'll probably perform better if you format it to something native to Linux, like ext4. This can be done with Disk Utility.\n\n*Fancy features might not work. Things like one-touch-backup require software installed to work and undoubtedly this software isn't written for Ubuntu. Don't buy things based on their fancy features: buy dumb external disks and you'll be happy with your purchase.\n\nA: All hard disks are compatible with... In other words what i mean there is no relation between the physical content of the hard disk with the OS. What really affects is the File system that you use and as you know Ubuntu uses ext FS which is really great in dealing with hard drives so as a conclusion buy whatever you want. For me i advice yo to but a Western Digital Hard disk\n", "Q: Ubuntu partition won't display on screen I installed ggobi on my MacBook Pro, and it wasn't working right.

Go back to the docs and verify that your DHCP server config is setup correctly according to your environment e.g. maas owns the network or using an existing dhcp server. It's also helpful for only one interface on your maas clients to acknowledge PXE boot.\nIf you have that all sorted see: http://www.networkingblog.in/ios-dhcp-pxe-and-ip-helper-address-5363\n\"Kumar April 13, 2010 at 6:53 am\nI think your PXE clients are using MTFTP which uses Multicast. Again this traffic wont be forward using helper-address as its not a broadcast. ITs a multicast. YOu will need to enable multicast forwarding on your router to forward this multicast TFTP traffic to the PXE server which holds the bootfile. It works in the adjacent vlan, as the clients are on the same LAN as the PXE server. Can you put a sniffer such as ethereal and filter multicast packets and see what Multicast packet on port 69 is used (TFTP). THen you can enable PIM routing to forward multicast traffic from this vlan to the PXE server vlan.\nHere is a guide to multicast routing.\nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/sw/iosswrel/ps1835/products_configuration_guide_chapter09186a00800ca794.html#wp1000948\nHere is a link to ethereal – download.\"\nHas PXE boot ever worked on your network before?\n", "Q: What version was installed? x64 or i686? What's the difference exactly? Okay, so heres my problem.\nI recently started migrating several services to individual VMs on my box, using VirtualBox 4.1.\nI created a new VirtualBox VM with guest type \"Ubuntu (64 Bit)\". I've already done this before and it worked like a charm.\nI then installed Ubuntu server (12.04) from the exact same dvd image. All the time I thought that it should have installed x64.\nI already put a few hours work into the new VM, migrating the webserver and mail system etc.\nToday I tried installing a x64 piece of software and it suddenly told me that it needed x64 and I had only i686.\nI checked uname -a and this is what it gave me:\nLinux hostname 3.2.0-29-generic-pae #46-Ubuntu SMP Fri Jul 27 17:25:43 UTC 2012 i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux\nAny guesses what went wrong?

There is a box \"Choose your flavour\" to change from 64-bit to 32-bit on the official download page.\n\nTo be able to install a 64-bit OS we have to tell Virtual Box to emulate a 64-bit capable machine (which would be possible even on a 32-bit host OS when the CPU supports this). Of course we would then be able to install 32-bit Ubuntu on that 64-bit virtual machine (like in real life, and that is what you probably did) but we would not be able to install 64-bit Ubuntu on a 32-bit virtual machine.\n\nA: To answer the difference between i686 and x64:\nx64 specifies the architecture (64bit) while i686 specifies the processor generation. The \"older\" among us might remember the 80486 CPU by Intel, which was followed by the 80586 CPU which Intel called \"Pentium\" on the consumer market.\ni686 specifies that this software will not run on 486 and 386 CPUs but only on Pentiums successors (and compatible, like AMD), most probably because it was compiled to use cpu flags these older processors lack.

I thought lightdm was the session manager, not a user?\nDoes anybody know what could be causing this? \nThere is no user: \"lightdm\" on the server and the problem only comes from one of the 7 internal desktops connected to the server (its IP address is in the local network).\n\nA: lightdm is a session manager and a user, lightdm runs as the lightdm user which has root privileges.\nFrom /etc/passwd:\nlightdm:x:104:112:Light Display Manager:/var/lib/lightdm:/bin/false\nI'm curious what you mean by \"trying to login\" though, can you explain more?\n", "Q: PlayOnLinux Equivalent for windows Like the PlayOnLinux do we have a similar application in windows that allows us to run a Ubuntu application on Windows OS.\nOr is there any simulator to run the ubuntu terminal in Windows(for learning purpose).\n\nA: Why not simply use a virtual machine with a Linux Operating System? \nYou can use VirtualBox by Oracle, or VMware player. They are both free, and allow you to create a Virtual Machine, which essentially is a virtual computer inside your computer, acting like a normal program, and running anything a physical computer with the same operating system can run (with the exception of games).\n[EDIT #1]: I found some interesting tutorials on how to install Ubuntu inside VirtualBox here. It should help you to get started if you decide to follow this route.\n\nA: You can also try Cygwin.\n\nCygwin is:\na collection of tools which provide a Linux look and feel environment for Windows.\nCygwin is not:\na way to run native Linux apps on Windows.\nYou must rebuild your\napplication from source if you want it to run on Windows. a way to\nmagically make native Windows apps aware of UNIX® functionality like\nsignals, ptys, etc.\n\n\nA: Yes. You can install virtual box on your system. What is virtual box?\nHow to install it:\n\n\n*\n\n*download virtual box (windows version).\n\n*install it.\nThen you can load your Ubuntu OS in that and learn.Visit this for extra information.\n", "Q: Windows browsers in ubuntu for web developent I regularly do front end development(html,css,js) and need to test websites for ie7, ie8, ie9, firefox, chrome, safari, opera in windows.I would like to move to ubuntu, but am concerned that testing websites might get very difficult.Do I have any options besides having windows as virtual machine ?\n\nA: For a complete answer:\nFirefox, Chrome (or its FOSS counterpart Chromium) and Opera have native Ubuntu (or more generaly Linux) versions. They handle the same as the Windows version. In other words, you can get a version of these browsers that will run under Ubuntu without any problem.\nFor both Safari and IE, you have two choices (well 3): the first option would be to run IE and Safari for Windows using Wine & Winetricks. Wine emulates the win32 API, so that applications built for Windows can run on linux. The second option would be to run a virtual machine. That virtual machine could run a minimal version of windows so that you could use IE/Safari for Windows on there. You might even want to create an OSX VM to run Safari for Mac.\n\nA: Install the IE browsers under wine. You can use winetricks to do that.\n\nA: To my knowledge, Chrome and Firefox run natively on Ubuntu, which is what most users use.\nFirefox even comes preinstalled on Ubuntu, and you can easily install chrome by typing the following on a terminal:\nsudo apt-get install chromium-browser\n\n\nA: Not only that you can Firefox and a plugin that changes the user agent of the browser. So you can have Firefox open a page like IE, Chrome, or others.\nAlgo you have Firebug to debug html, css, etc.\nSo in Ubuntu you can have all browsers running native, and IExplorer under Wine or a Virtual machine.\nAlso Firefox has those excellent plugins for web development.\n", "Q: Will GNOME 3.6 be backported to 12.04 Is there any chance that GNOME 3.6 or some of its components be backported to Ubuntu 12.04? Or should I upgrade to 12.10 to get GNOME 3.6?\n\nA: Ubuntu 12.04 is a Long Term Support version of Ubuntu and it is supported with maintenance and security updates for 5 years. Ubuntu uses Unity as its Desktop User interface and will be supported as scheduled with updates that mostly are bugfixing and not things that may drastically alter the user experience or break the system. \nOn the other hand Gnome 3.6 (I think you refer to Gnome Shell) is maintained by the Gnome Community and the only way to stay up-to date is to use the external, unofficial repositories. The PPA's that are available for gnome will eventually back-port the 3.6, but that may break your system if you don't know what you are up to. \nThere are many changes in the Gnome libraries that are not fully compatible with 12.04 and it is better to upgrade to 12.10 when it is ready. This version will sync its GTK3 libraries with the upstream Gnome 3 and it will be more comfortable to you to have Gnome 3.6.\nAlso, there is a Ubuntu 12.10 Gnome Remix (Gnomubuntu) that will be designed to meet the needs of people who want Gnome Shell 3.x instead of Unity. \n", "Q: Is there a way to get a list of my favourite programs so I don't have to 'store' them in in my vertical dock??

The latter is not being developed anymore.\nFrom System Imager's website:\n\nSystem Imager is a tool that images your running system and allows you to make a image of your running machine and install it on another. System Imager is based on the work of Remastersys.\n\nIt has been released under the GNU GPLv2 and the source code is available from the developers in Sourceforge.net\n\nA: Distroshare Ubuntu Imager is a new script that I developed: https://github.com/Distroshare/distroshare-ubuntu-imager .  It is based on this guide: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MakeALiveCD/DVD/BootableFlashFromHarddiskInstall, but includes some bug fixes and extras.\nSystem Imager turned into Black Lab Image Creator, which is no longer free.

So this might be very silly question for users, but I am quite new to Ubuntu and want to know this. Do .deb installed apps get updates?\nFor example: I have Opera installed with using .deb will it get updates like software that are installed using PPA?\nI would gladly accept your answers if you will explain this as well:\n\nAs you can see .deb installed Skype added it's self to software source so will it or will it not get updates?\nThank you for your time.\n\nA: Some deb-files installs the package source too, so you can get updates.\nFor example, if you download the Dropbox Ubuntu Debian file and install it, you get dropbox.list in /etc/apt/sources.list.d.\nThen you can see, that the source is activated with cat dropbox.list, because there is no # in front of the line.:\ndeb http://linux.dropbox.com/ubuntu precise main\n\n\nA: The answer depends on the situation. \nIf your installed .deb file has repository enabled or get enabled while installing, installed .deb packages will be updated. But, if your installed .deb file has no online repository, from which it can get updates, that package won't be updated. The reason is clear, the package manager doesn't know anyway to update the package, because it doesn't know any online repository providing this same package.\nIf you have synaptic package manager installed, You can see those packages who do not have any repository enabled, or installed with .deb files without enabling a repository. Open synaptic package manager, Click status section and see under Installed (local or obsolete) section. \n\nGoogle-chrome and dropbox enable a repository while installing from .deb files, so you will get update for these packages.\nNote: The same rule is true for packages which you installed via apt-get but later disabled the repository and no other repository provide those packages. In that case, you won't receive updates for these too.\n", "Q: no sound after suspend/resume I have no audio on lubuntu 12.04 after resuming from suspend. I tried sudo alsa force-reload to no avail. Sound works after reboot. Please help.\n\nA: For some systems it is necessary to kill the pulseaudio process and prevent it from re-loading before restarting ALSA. If the following procedure works, it can be automated.\n\n\n*\n\n*Set up Pulseaudio so it does not respawn automatically:\nmkdir ~/.pulse\necho \"autospawn = no\" >> ~/.pulse/client.conf\n\n\n*Suspend your computer and wake him up\n\n*Restart ALSA:\nsudo alsa force-reload\n\n\n*Start pulseaudio:\npulseaudio --start\n\nTo revert the changes, delete the file ~/.pulse/client.conf\n\nA: After consulting some posts, what I've done to get mine to work again:\n\n\n*\n\n*Set pulseaudio not to respawn by creating config file at home\ndirectory:\nmkdir ~/.pulse\necho \"autospawn = no\" >> ~/.pulse/client.conf\n\n\n*Create a file (50alsa) to automate after system suspend.\nsudo gedit /etc/pm/sleep.d/50alsa\n\n\n*Add the following to the file.

I then noticed that it didn't appear to be including any of the repos in that directory.  Only stuff in /etc/apt/sources.list seem to be noticed by apt-get.  All the files in the directory end in .list and contain something like: \n virtualbox.list\n\n      deb http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian oneiric contrib\n\n pj-assis-ppa-oneiric.list\n\n      deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/pj-assis/ppa/ubuntu oneiric main\n      deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/pj-assis/ppa/ubuntu oneiric main\n\nDo I need to put some sort of include statement in /etc/apt/sources.list?\nI'm using kubuntu 11.10.\n\nA: So the problem seemed to be that I had a package installed from one of the normal apt repos and I wanted it to update with a version from one of the new repos. Apparently this is not possible. I had to uninstall the packages in question and then install with all of the normal repos commented out. I'm still not sure why when you do an apt-get update, that none of these new repos have their urls displayed. \n\nA: The names of files in /etc/sources.list.d must end in .list, if they are to be included as software sources.\nAs the man page of sources.list says:\n\nDESCRIPTION\n   The package resource list is used to locate archives of the package\n   distribution system in use on the system. At this time, this manual\n   page documents only the packaging system used by the Debian GNU/Linux\n   system. This control file is /etc/apt/sources.list.\n\n   The source list is designed to support any number of active sources and\n   a variety of source media. The file lists one source per line, with the\n   most preferred source listed first. The format of each line is: type\n   uri args The first item, type determines the format for args.  uri is a\n   Universal Resource Identifier (URI), which is a superset of the more\n   specific and well-known Universal Resource Locator, or URL. The rest of\n   the line can be marked as a comment by using a #.\n\nSOURCES.LIST.D\n   The /etc/apt/sources.list.d directory provides a way to add\n   sources.list entries in separate files. The format is the same as for\n   the regular sources.list file. File names need to end with .list and\n   may only contain letters (a-z and A-Z), digits (0-9), underscore (_),\n   hyphen (-) and period (.) characters. Otherwise APT will print a notice\n   that it has ignored a file if the file doesn't match a pattern in the\n   Dir::Ignore-Files-Silently configuration list - in this case it will be\n   silently ignored.\n\n\nTaking an example from this page, suppose you wanted to install chef (from opscode), what you'd do is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create and open a file named opscode.list:\n\n\n\n    sudo vim /etc/apt/sources.list.d/opscode.list\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Add the required line and save the file:\n\n\n\n    deb http://apt.opscode.com/ oneiric main\n\nThe above steps can be combined to make a single command:\nsudo /bin/sh -c 'echo \"deb http://apt.opscode.com/ onereic main\" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/opscode.list'\n\nNote: The command contains onereic because the codename of the Ubuntu you're using is Onereic. Had you been using Precise (12.04), you'd have writter precise.\n", "Q: How to change launcher icon Is there a way to customize a Lucid Lynx Launcher icon for various programs? There does not seem to be a way to do this using Create Launcher or Launcher properties. The application is not actually \"installed\" on the PC, the executable has just been copied. All I've been able to do so far is to add the command /home/t32/bin/pc_linux/t32marm -c /home/t32/config_usb.t32 to a generic Launcher icon using Create Launcher.\n\nA: Launcher icons are stored in /usr/share/applications. Go to your terminal and type: sudo nautilus /usr/share/applications, then right click the application you want, select Properties and click the icon on the properties window. Now you can set it to any icon you want.   \n*edits\n*here is an example .desktop file.\n[Desktop Entry]   \nName=Give me a name!    \nComment=Explain me here!    \nIcon=/home/t32/t32.png   \nExec=/home/t32/bin/pc_linux/t32marm -c /home/t32/config_usb.t32   \nTerminal=false   \nType=Application   \nCategories=This is important, select a category that is present  \nStartupNotify=true   \n\n*use one of the following as category: Accessibility, Customization, Education, Games, \nInternet, Office, System, Accessories, Developer, Graphics, Media, Other. Exec is the command to run, Icon is an absolute path to where the icon lives. Usually you wouldn't need to alter anything else. You may keep this as a scratch and reuse.\n*copy this to a whatever-you-name.desktop file, edit as needed and put the file in the /usr/share/applications directory. If paths are true, it will pop up in the gnome menu. I don't know if lucid had Unity or gnome3, but if it has, when you search it by the name you gave it, it will be visible in the unity lens, gnome activities thing. If you have gnome2, it would be grouped under the corresponding category in the applications menu. \n*And this kind of launcher are so cute that they are valid in GNOME, KDE and (probably) all others. \n\nA: Launcher shortcuts are *.desktop text files. They can be in:\n\n\n*\n\n*$HOME/.local/share/applications\n\n*/usr/local/share/applications\n\n*/usr/share/applications\n\n\nLook in the latter directory for examples.\nThe .desktop files have a line defining the icon: Icon=icon_file_base_name. You can set a full path to your icon file, or use only the basename without extension, if you put the icon file into the right place.\nThat place can be under $HOME/.icons/ or $XDG_DATA_DIRS/icons. They should be .svg or .png files. If .png, there should be at least a 48x48 pixels version, though there may be other sizes.\nFor a simple example, try to put a 48x48 .png file called example.png into /usr/local/share/icons/hicolor/48x48/apps/ and also do\ncp /usr/share/icons/hicolor/index.theme /usr/local/share/icons/hicolor/\n\nThis way, you don't need the full path in the .desktop file. Just Icon=example. And it is available to all users on the machine.\nSee the specification for all the details.\n", "Q: How to execute a executable with sudo? I have an executable file but don't know what type or format it is.

If this is the case, why don't you post the code of the shell executable using http://paste.ubuntu.com.\n\nA: Had the same problem. In my case the executable was stored on a different drive which was why chmod+x was not working. \nI copied the executable to a Linux directory (like Desktop), set the permissions using chmod+x, ran the executable using \"./\" and it worked :)\n\nA: The problem is that unless the filesystem of the device is like ext3 or ext4, (and probably it is FAT32 for you), the filesystem does not store much metadata about files, including the executable bit.\nWhen you do chmod +x yourfile, then ls -la yourfile, you will notice the executable bit has not in fact been set. \nThe solution here is to cp yourfile ~/yourfile; chmod +x ~/yourfile; ~/yourfile, because the filesystem on which your Linux is installed has executable permissions.\nLearn more about the *nx permissions model.\n", "Q: Pinging/connecting to server.domain.local never works, but server does when the search domain is specified This is a bit of a weird one.

At work we often need to install Ubuntu Server and several extra packages while offline. To make this faster, I'm creating a custom Ubuntu Server install via preseeding (following this documentation: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallCDCustomization). Installing extra packages was easy and works well.\nIn addition to adding a few packages, I would like to add another repository to the default set. This is where it seems to get tricky. Remember that, at install time, these computers are offline. However, I need to add an online repository to the list along with adding its key. Adding the repo to the list is easy with\nd-i   apt-setup/local0/repository string <repo url>\n\nBut the key NEEDS TO BE ADDED OFFLINE. So I downloaded the key and added it to the ISO (I made a new \"keys\" directory), thinking that I should be able to access it like the isolinux/txt.cfg file (specifically, the \"append file=/cdrom/preseed...\" bit) but I can't seem to be able to access /cdrom from the preseed file. The simplest test is a late_command:\nd-i   preseed/late_command string df > /target/home/df.txt; ls -Rl /cdrom > /target/home/cdrom.txt; ls -Rl /target/media/cdrom > /target/home/target_cdrom.txt[/CODE]\n\nThe server install tells me the above command exits with error code -1, and the only file out of those three that contains anything is the df, which looks like this:\nFilesystem             1K-blocks     Used   Available   Use%   Mounted on\nnone                      205182      180      204992     0%   /run\ndevtmpfs                 1020212        8     1020204     0%   /dev\n/dev/sr0                 1408470  1408470           0   100%   /cdrom\n/dev/mapper/ubuntu-root 18540428  3541660    14068568    20%   /target\n/dev/sda1                 233191    24991      195759    11%   /target/boot\n/dev/mapper/ubuntu-root 18540428  3541660    14068568    20%   /dev/.static/dev\ndevtmpfs                 1020212        8     1020204     0%   /target/dev\n/dev/sr0                 1408470  1408470           0   100%   /target/media/cdrom\n\nSo obviously both /cdrom and /target/media/cdrom exist. Why can't I read them from the preseed file? Is the ISO actually mounted there as in isolinux/txt.cfg? Is there any other way to add this key without needing to download it like the following?\nd-i   apt-setup/local0/key string <remote repo key url>\n\nThank you for your help.\n\nA: It seems that when you install from iso-file (in virtual machine), cdrom contents are not visible in preseed, just as you described above. Only when you actually write the iso to usb stick (make the iso hybrid first) and install from that, it works as it should. Don't know why, but I think the answer is hidden in debian-installer somewhere.\nEDIT: I should mention also that you have to install to a real computer from that usb stick, because if you try to install to virtual machine, installation process will break for some unknown reason.

Ubuntu one remote uses sudo -S -p '' halt for shutdown and does not work to the end.\nleaveing monitor on with message\n\nwill now halt\n[22225.11163] halted\n\nWhat is the difference between sudo -S -p \" halt  and sudo shutdown now?\n\nA: There is a good answer at the Unix SE site about the shutdown vs halt issue: What is the difference between Halt and Shutdown commands?\nAs for the sudo -S -p '' part, this will remove the message about asking the password in the terminal (You still have enter your password though)\nFor example running sudo <some_command> will give this output before running this command:\n\n[sudo] password for : \n\nBut running sudo -S -p '' <some_command> will hide that message.\nIn fact, the message that you put in the quotes, is replacing the previous message.\nGo ahead and try the following, and see the difference:\n sudo -S -p 'Hey, I am a custom message.' ls\n\n\nA: The -S and -p switches for sudo have no importance in this case. Here is what they do, respectively.\n\nThe -S switch causes sudo to read the password from STDIN. This allows, for example, a password to be piped to sudo through echo or cat.\nThe -p switch allows you to override the default password prompt and use a custom one, or none at all.\n\n\nThe important difference is in the two commands being issued by sudo.\n\nThe halt command, if invoked without the -p switch, simply halts the OS and stops all CPUs. Once the system is cleanly halted, the user may safely hit the Power button on his computer manually.\nThe poweroff, shutdown -h now, and halt -p commands all do the same thing as halt alone, while additionally sending an ACPI command to signal the power supply unit to disconnect the main power. This prevents you from having to physically push the Power button on your computer.\n\n\nA: halt is not shutdown, they are different commands. The former does not turn the power off, unless -p option is used\nFrom the manual (man halt): \"-p, --poweroff : Instructs the halt command to instead behave as poweroff.\"\nAnd, in your case, -p was not used in the haltcommand, hence your computer was not powered off.\nDo not confuse this -p with the one from sudo, it's a different parameter for a different command. From man sudo: \n\n\n*\n\n*-S The -S (stdin) option causes sudo to read the password from the standard input instead of the terminal device.  The password must be followed by a newline character.\n\n*-p prompt The -p (prompt) option allows you to override the default password prompt and use a custom one.\nIn your case, prompt is empty (no message displayed for sudo when asking password), and -S makes sudo accept root password vi stdin (so password may be supplied using pipes and redirection from other commands instead of being typed)\n\nA: There are no difference between halt command and shutdown in terms of the user intention. The thin difference is that in halt you have to conveniently push the power button to shutdown the system whereas in shutdown command it will automatically instruct the Advanced Configuration Power Interface (ACPI) to sent a signal to the power unit to turn off the system.\n", "Q: Difference between sudo rm -rf and rm -vf? Recently I have seen one issue with a cache problem. The problem comes with broken hash and that could be fixed with \nsudo rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*\n\nand \nsudo rm /var/lib/apt/lists/* -vf\n\nBut I am not understanding the difference between these two. Can somebody explain the difference? \n\nA: -rf:\n\n\n*\n\n*The -r argument stands for \"recursive.\" It will remove what you ask, as well as all files and directories underneath it.\n\n*The -f argument stands for \"force.\" It will ignore nonexistent files and never prompt.\n\n\n-vf:\n\n\n*\n\n*The -f again stands for \"force.\"\n\n*The -v argument stands for \"verbose.\" It will print all items it deletes.\n\n\nThe biggest difference is this: -rf will remove all files and directories under the location you asked for, and print nothing. -vf will NOT remove non-empty directories and print everything it does delete.\nNote that this information comes from the man page:\n$ man rm\n\n\nA: from the man Page:\n\n-r, -R, --recursive\n\nremove directories and their contents recursively i.e. Folders inside them will be removed also.\n\n-v, --verbose\n\nexplain what is being done or show what is happening.\nFor the -f \n\n-f, --force           ignore nonexistent files, never prompt\n\nYou will not be promoted whether to remove the file or not.

What all can I do?\n\nA: The best way to secure any computer that way is just to unplug it.\nSecurity threats have been around and will continue to exist, and that's something you have to understand.\nHowever there are a few tips, costumization that you can do to have a more secure box.\nA lot of these security measures are present in a wiki here: Ubuntu Security\nHere you will find an introduction to the most famous forms of attack and how to prevent them, including:\nIntroduction to AppArmor\nHost-based Intrusion Detection Systems (HIDS)\nNetwork Intrusion Detection Systems (Snort)\nViruses\nSSH and VNC\nFirewall\netc.\nLuckly, there are a few good resources where you can learn more:\nSecurity\nMy favorite site for security\nInstallingSecurityTools\nThe Big Ol' Ubuntu Security Resource\nLocking Down Ubuntu\nBasic info\nBecause there are so many measures one can take reading for those sites is a good place to start. I can resume some of the basic measures:\n\n*\n\n*Change SSH port or disable (if you don't need it)\n\n*Set up a firewall (Firestarter - begginers, Iptables - advanced users)\n\n*Disable Flash/Java\n\n*Secure your home - sudo chmod 0700 /home/your-user-name\n\n*Download security update packages\n\n*Use strong passwords\n\n*Limit root access, use sudo instead\n\n*Do not install software or add repositories from untrusted sources\n\n*Deny all cookies and add trusted sites, allowing only for session.\n\n*Kernel and compiler hardening\n\nAlso there's an Ubuntu version called Ubuntu Server that you should try.\n", "Q: Installed Ubuntu on partition of HD with Vista but doesn't boot After trying Ubuntu from Live CD, I've decided to install it.\nI partitioned the HD where my Vista installation is by shrinking it on Vista, and I've left the space empty without formatting it; then I've used the live CD to install Ubuntu (12.04), which seemed to complete fine.\nAt boot no GRUB requester happens and Vista boots regularly, whereas from its disk management tool the empty space I had left (16 GB) has been occupied by the Ubuntu partition and by the swap' one.\nWith that there are 4 primary partitions, albeit there was also one more I forgot to unmount before installing (a virtual CD).\nThe results with bootinfoscript are the following:\n                 Boot Info

This will reinstall GRUB in the MBR of the adequate disk(s).\nThen reboot.\nHope this helps\n", "Q: Change gtk-2 scrollbar to something like overlay scrollbar (in appearance) When there are scroll wheels on mice and scrollbar functions on thouchpads, a low contrast wide scrollbar doesn’t make sense. So I wanted to change gtk-2.0 scrollbar to something like overlay one – orange narrow slider with white background.\nI couldn’t find anything about this topic here, so I decided to write something about it.\n\nA: The solution is in /usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-2.0/gtkrc – for example, for Ambiance theme. You can edit this file through Terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T):\nsudo gedit /usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-2.0/gtkrc\n\nIt contains anything about everything, so be careful.\nIf you don’t mind about the procedure, you can download my file and replace the gtkrc with it, by the command:\nsudo cp \"~/Downloads/gtkrc\" /usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-2.0/gtkrc\n\nand whithin the quotation marks put your path for the downloaded file.\n\nThe procedure\n•   Under the block style \"default\" you can find some lines starting with GtkScrollbar. GtkScrollbar::slider-width is clear to define slider width, so put the value \"3\" for it.\n•   To remove scrollbars steppers we add two more lines:\nGtkScrollbar::has-forward-stepper = 0\nGtkScrollbar::has-backward-stepper = 0\nand change the GtkRange::stepper-size to \"1\".\n•   Now, we go to change the colors! Under the block style \"scrollbar\", put the same orange color for three bg colors:\nbg[NORMAL] = @selected_bg_color\nbg[PRELIGHT] = @selected_bg_color\nbg[ACTIVE] = @selected_bg_color\nOf course you can use different numbers on your choice. For example, if you want the slider to get darker when you hold it by mouse, use smaller values for ACTIVE mode.\n•   At last, in the same block under the block engine \"murrine\", I applied some modifications to make the slider look like overlay:\nroundness = 0\ncontrast = 0.0\ntrough_shades = {1.3, 1.2}\nglowstyle = 3\n\nHere is the result (it will be a bit better now, because I’ve edited gtkrc after making these screenshots):\n\n", "Q: WiFi slow sometimes, reboot helps, how do I debug it? Ubuntu 12.04.1 with all updates installed. Laptop Lenovo Thinkpad X230 with Intel Corporation Centrino Advanced-N 6205.\nWiFi sometimes becomes extremely slow. Often this occurs when I wake the system from suspend and connect to a different network. I find no obvious clues in system logs. /etc/init.d/network-manager restart doesn't help, but a reboot does. How can I go on with debugging this issue? In specific, which parts of the system should I try to restart (without a complete reboot)? \nI know of problems with Intel WiFi (see for example this question and the instructions here), but if that was the problem, I would expect the WiFi to be slow at all times, and not just sometimes. Also, I have a gut feeling that it might be a DNS issue (for example, getting a page from a known server is faster than accessing a new server), but I don't know how to tackle it.\nUpdate: despite numerous updates in the meanwhile, I still observe this behavior. It happens always when I access my WiFi router at home after returning from work; when I reboot my laptop, the connection speed is good again.\nEDIT: I have found the problem! While at work, I use a Cisco-compatible VPN client to connect to intranet (without it, I only have Internet access); package vpnc. The problem appears if and only if I turn on VPN at work, put the computer to sleep, and wake it at home. The vpnc client does not run any longer, but apparently some configuration still lingers (I will dive into that over the next weeks). When at home and I run another vpn connection, and then disconnect with vpnc-disconnect, my problem disappears. The 11n_disable option has no influence on this behavior.\nI thank both contributors with an upvote, but -- sorry -- not with the bounty. However, the bounty is still to have for the person who will either explain to me what is happening or give me a guide how to debug the vpnc problem.\n\nA: The problem is most likely with the driver. Others have experienced problems with the iwlwifi driver when its 802.11n mode is enabled.  To disable this mode, create a file named something like /etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi-disable11n.conf with contents\noptions iwlwifi 11n_disable=1\n\nand then reboot.\nWireless drivers sometimes don't implement power management very well. You could try adding power_save=0 to that line to see if it helps.\noptions iwlwifi 11n_disable=1 power_save=0\n\n\nA: In modinfo iwlwifi, power_save is set to disabled by default. As well, the parameter is boolean (Y or N) and not an integer (0 or 1).\nThe module will likely remove correctly with:\n    sudo modprobe -r iwlwifi && sudo modprobe iwlwifi 11n_disable=1\n\n\nA: This was a while ago but the last time I used a Cisco VPN client like that. I would have bad routes. \nSleeping the laptop while connected, then not reconnecting when it woke up left me with a bad route. This could be happening to you. \nI would start by checking your static route table. Then if you still have a route to your VPN network deleting it manually.\nSee this link for examples of removing routes. \nLike I said it's been a while for me, but I would always get a stale route. That stale route would make things run REALLY slowly on first connect (at the IP level not the client level). Basically it seemed like the network was running slow for no good reason.\nIf removing the route works, your can try adding the route removal script to either network manager (for starting new connections to \"HOME\") or to your wake from sleep scripts (vpnc should re-add the route when you connect which you would have to do after sleep anyway). \n", "Q: How do I partition my images for OpenStack? I'm following the Ubuntu OpenStack Beginners Guide at:\nhttp://docs.openstack.org/essex/openstack-compute/starter/content/Base_OS-d1e542.html\nI have used Ubuntu for some years, but always just accepted the standard partition set-up. I'm now following the instructions which say use Ubuntu Server, and now I am not sure how to set-up the partitions in the format asked for:\n\nWe will also be running nova-volume on this server and it is ideal to\n  have a dedicated partition for the use of nova-volume. So, ensure that\n  you choose manual partitioning scheme while installing Ubuntu Server\n  and create a dedicated partition with adequate amount of space for\n  this purpose. We have referred to this partition in the rest of the\n  chapter as /dev/sda6. You can substitute the correct device name of\n  this dedicated partition based on your local setup while following the\n  instructions. Also ensure that the partition type is set as Linux LVM\n  (8e) using fdisk either during install or immediately after\n  installation is over. If you also plan to use a dedicated partition as\n  Swift backend, create another partition for this purpose and follow\n  the instructions in \"Swift Installation\" section below.\n\nWould anyone be able to advice?\nAlso, I am assuming I am OK to use VirtualBox Images.\nFinally, on the network configuration instructions:\nhttp://docs.openstack.org/essex/openstack-compute/starter/content/Network_Configuration-d1e591.html\nDo I actually use the settings below, I do I have to adjust for my settings?\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\naddress 10.10.10.2\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\nbroadcast 10.10.10.255\ngateway 10.10.10.1\ndns-nameservers 10.10.8.3\n\nauto eth1\niface eth1 inet static\naddress 192.168.3.1\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\nnetwork 192.168.3.0\nbroadcast 192.168.3.255\n\n\nA: It really depends on what you need. The LV 'nova-volumes' is used for volumes that can be attached to virtual machines. Like the Amazon EBS, if you plan to use only virtual machines without the need of adding/removing volumes you can keep it small (about 50-100 gb) else you need to increase the size.\nOther storage paths are /var/lib/nova/instances for instances disk and /var/lib/glance/images for server images and snapshots.\nAbout the network configuration it seems correct, depends if you have multiple machines to work with or all in one.\n", "Q: How to open .fodt files in LibreOffice by default?

I have in mind programs that work like the apps that come installed on blu-ray players — BBC iPlayer, Hulu and/or YouTube.\nI know XMBC can but it's too fiddly and resource-hungry, I just want \"net TV\" apps and not a full media center. Boxee was great for this; it was a media center but it had an interface for the apps and didn't just stick them in some strange menu as XBMC does.\n\nA: I don't know if this will fit your exact needs, but I use Miro to stay up to date with all my podcasts and rss feeds that I like to watch.  We all know Netflix doesn't work on Linux so it doesn't support that, but Amazon Prime is similar to Netflix and doesn't have ads like Hulu which is the only reason I don't like Hulu.  If you pay for something you shouldn't have ads, but back on topic.\nMiro is probably the best application for searching new shows and staying up to date.  It does have a bunch of channels like youtube, hulu, pbs, and you can add more if you like.\n\n\n\nHope this helps.\n\nA: As miro has been suggested as a good general application (and minitube could alternatively be used for youtube videos), a particularly useful program for UK users like Mark is in the Ubuntu repositories and is called get-iplayer. \nNote: anyone in the world can listen to all the radio output from the bbc via the bbc site, but currently tv is limited to UK users, but as Mark is in the UK I thought this answer might be useful. With get-iplayer you can stream content to vlc or record it to disk. More information is available here at the linuxcentre.\n(If someone can confirm whether the radio (not tv) using get-iplayer works outside the UK I would be interested.)\nsudo apt-get install get-iplayer\n\nThen run the command get_iplayer in terminal to get the tv lists and get_iplayer --help for a list of options.\nIf you want to get the radio lists instead enter get_iplayer --type radio. \nWhen you update the tv lists with get_iplayer (without any options), you will be presented with a large amount of numbered items, but you can search it, for example, like this:  \nget_iplayer search gardening\n\nAn example of a way to stream tv to vlc (you choose the stream number from the list generated by get-iplayer):\nget_iplayer --stream 895 --modes=flashvhigh --player=\"vlc - \" \n\nA way to record a program (you have to choose the number of the program after you run get_iplayer to generate the list):\nget_iplayer 288 --modes=flashvhigh --get\n\nIt is supposed to be possible to view live bbc tv channels through get_iplayer, but I have always had errors and returned to using the website. Get_iplayer is a very useful program nevertheless. \n\n\nA: Directly from this link are 2 good options:\n\nTv Maxe \nTo install it, open Terminal (Ctrl + Alt + T) and paste this code:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:venerix/blug\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install tv-maxe\n\n\nSopCast Player \nTo install it, open Terminal (Ctrl + Alt + T) and paste this code:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ferramroberto/sopcast\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install sopcast-player\n\n\nNote: Both TV maxe and SopCast Player use P2P (peer-to-peer networking) to stream their content. Though these services are not illegal per se, watching paid TV channels or any licensed ones might get you in trouble depending on your country's jurisdiction. Please keep this mind before trying any of these options out.\nSee here and here for more information on this topic.\n\nI was actually trying myself to find a nice application I was using on Ubuntu 12.10 just a few weeks ago.

Totally vanilla installation afaik.\nI'm noticing that sudo caches the password until I issue sudo -k to clear it.\nThis is unexpected behavior in my mind.  I've run xfce4 before and don't recall credential caching being on, nor have I experienced it in the many previous ubuntu installs I've had over the years.\nIs this a new feature of Ubuntu?  Is this something that's the result of the minimal install?  Is this an xfce default that's been added recently?\n\nA: It actually caches the right to elevate, but not your password, and has done so for quite a while. However, it does so for only fifteen minutes, by default. This is by design:\nFrom  http://linux.die.net/man/8/sudo:\n\nOnce a user has been authenticated, a time stamp is updated and the user may then use sudo without a password for a short period of time (5 minutes unless overridden in sudoers). \n\nand as a note of security from man sudoers:\n\nsudo will check the ownership of its time stamp directory (/var/db/sudo by default) and ignore the directory's contents if it is not owned by root or if it is writable by a user other than root. On systems that allow non-root users to give away files via chown(2), if the time stamp directory is located in a directory writable by anyone (e.g., /tmp), it is possible for a user to create the time stamp directory before sudo is run. However, because sudo checks the ownership and mode of the directory and its contents, the only damage that can be done is to \"hide\" files by putting them in the time stamp dir. This is unlikely to happen since once the time stamp dir is owned by root and inaccessible by any other user, the user placing files there would be unable to get them back out. To get around this issue you can use a directory that is not world-writable for the time stamps (/var/adm/sudo for instance) or create /var/db/sudo with the appropriate owner (root) and permissions (0700) in the system startup files. \n\nand from the same page:\n\nSince time stamp files live in the file system, they can outlive a user's login session. As a result, a user may be able to login, run a command with sudo after authenticating, logout, login again, and run sudo without authenticating so long as the time stamp file's modification time is within 5 minutes (or whatever the timeout is set to in sudoers). When the tty_tickets option is enabled in sudoers, the time stamp has per-tty granularity but still may outlive the user's session. On Linux systems where the devpts filesystem is used, Solaris systems with the devices filesystem, as well as other systems that utilize a devfs filesystem that monotonically increase the inode number of devices as they are created (such as Mac OS X), sudo is able to determine when a tty-based time stamp file is stale and will ignore it. Administrators should not rely on this feature as it is not universally available. \n\nAs seen here, this behavior has persisted for a long time.\nIf you want to change this, use visudo to set the timestamp_timeout option.\n", "Q: Taking 10 minutes to boot up! Just added 2 pci-e to ide cards in my computer so I can use 2 old ide hard drives.  Everything works fine, except the OS booting time has gone from about 10 seconds to about 10 minutes...\nI'f I remove both cards, it takes about 10 seconds to boot up, if I add either 1 of the cards back in, it still takes 10 seconds to boot up, but as soon as I have both cards in, it takes about 10 minutes.\nWhy would this be happening?\n\nA: It appears that there is an IRQ conflict. Both cards are set to the same \"channel\", and thus are conflicting. You must find a jumper or dip switch setting for IRQ and set it to something that no other device in your computer uses. You need not worry about plug-and-play devices as they will auto-resolve their conflict. As to changing the IRQ settings, this depends on your hardware.\nHowever, since you wish to add two disks, you only need one such card. You simply need an IDE cable with three connectors: one for the card, and two for disks. These are quite common.\n\nCARD-------DRIVE 1(MASTER)-----------------------------DRIVE 2(SLAVE)\n\nMake sure one of the drives is a master, and the other is a slave, or both use the Cable Select (CS) feature, as per their jumper settings. The order of master-slave on the cable doesn't matter if you aren't booting from wither of the drives, but if you are using CS, both drives must be in CS mode, and then they will automatically detect master/slave by their positions on the cable. \n\nA: Maybe you could check dmesg for errors or other clues?  In terminal:\ndmesg | more\n\nMaybe pastebin it look for stuff related to the cards you added.\n", "Q: What does the program cclive do?

I run a guest ubuntu 12.04 on a host ubuntu 12.04, with VirtualBox, and the guest is much, much slower than the host (ALT+TAB takes 4-5 secs). I had a look around and I found contradicting opinions on VirtualBox versus VMware (free); so I thought to keep the former. \nBoth systems are updated, I installed the additions on the guest and I evenly split memory and video memory (64MB) between guest and host. I am running a Toshiba m200 laptop with 4GB ram and shared video memory. The host bios does not include a configuration option for machine virtualization. I have 2 cpus and I can't give them both to the virtual machine.\nIs there anything I overlooked that could solve my problem?\nFeel free to ask for more info, and thank you for any help.\nEDIT\nIdling with the system monitor open the (single) guest cpu never gets below 55% and could rise to 80 - 90% just by moving the mouse around. Opening Firefox will cause the system monitor to show cpu usage 100% in the guest, while the host shows that both cpus are evenly working around 60%.\nMy cpu is Intel® Core™2 Duo CPU T5450 @ 1.66GHz × 2.\nIf this is not a configuration problem, does it mean my machine is too weak for virtualization?\n\nA: A virtual guest with that low of resources will run slowly. For best performance you actually give your host a bit more resources than the guest.  Also you will not be able to give both cpu's to your virtual machine since your host machine needs something to run everything.\nThink of it this way. Your host machine has to run its' own system plus the container for the guest. The guest gets into a resource fight with the host machine. Try giving the guest less and see how it runs. \nFor best performance you will want a 64 bit machine with more than 4gb of memory.\n\nA: I have experienced the same problem \nHost: Ubuntu 14.10 (64-bit),\nGuest: Windows 7 (64-bit)\nEven with the virtualization turned on in host BIOS the CPU load was constantly around 40-50% in guest idle state\nWhat helped me was installing Guest Addition with Direct 3D support (you need to do that in safe mode) and turning on the host I/O Cache of the SATA controller\nSo my current settings are:\nSystem\nBase memory: 4096 Mb (8192 Mb total host memory)\nProcessor: 6 CPUs (of host 6 CPUs)\nPAE/NX: Enabled\nVT-x/AMD-V: Enabled\nNested Paging: Enabled\nDisplay\nVideo memory: 128 Mb\n3D Acceleration: Enabled\n2D Acceleration: Enabled\nWorks like a charm! Virtual Box Version: 4.3.18_Ubuntu r96516\n\nA: In addition to the previous answers for optimal VirtualBox settings, there is a great blog post by Nam Huy on how to get 3D acceleration to work for an Ubuntu guest. This is especially useful for Ubuntu 13.04, as there is no option to install Unity 2D anymore, leaving a fresh installation without any real workload on 80-100% CPU load due to software rendering, making it practically useless for me.\nThe basic idea is to install guest additions, load \"vboxvideo\" into etc/modules, reboot, and then activate 3D acceleration in the VirtualBox Display settings. Note that enabling 3D acceleration has to be the very last step after configuring everything else in the guest.\nFor me, this brought a massive performance boost, in fullscreen mode I can't even tell the difference between my native OS and the Ubuntu guest.\n\nA: I don't know much about Player, but Vbox defaults are not good for Ubuntu releases that prefer a real GPU.\n\n\n*\n\n*On spinning HDDs, pre-allocate the entire virtual disk. On SSDs, it\ndoesn't matter. VDI / qcow2 sparse allocations do reduce performance, but the reductions involved appear to be less than 10% since 2015. Weigh the performance vs convenience.  \n\n*Allocate only the storage you need. Keep large files elsewhere, outside the vStorage.\n\n*Never allocate more CPUs or RAM than you should. 1 vCPU is probably enough.\n\n*Leave 1GB of RAM for the HostOS. Do not over commit RAM.\n\n*Use the VirtIO drivers for Storage and Networking. Modern Linux guests support this. For Windows guests, use the SATA (storage) and Intel PRO/1000 (network) drivers. It is possible to use virtio drivers under Windows, it is just a little harder.\n\n*Enable ACPI and AHCI for all guests from 2003, WinXP and later.\n\n*Desktop VMs should get all 128MB of display vRAM\n\n*Server VMs should stay with 9MB of vRAM; don't waste it.\n\n*Avoid 2D and 3D accel settings, until you have everything else working the way you like. I'm serious.  Ubuntu does bad things when this is enabled. It can bring a Core i7 to the ground.\n\n\nFor more details: http://blog.jdpfu.com/2012/09/14/solution-for-slow-ubuntu-in-virtualbox\n\nA: Although the initial answer is very detailed I feel the straight to the point answer is honestly that the system/laptop is too slow and underpowered not much can be done unless there is a config issue or bug in your Virtualbox version.  You can try to optimize but the host RAM and 2 CPU cores at 1.66Ghz are just not going to cut it.  With that CPU utilization it is very likely due to swapping and not having enough RAM. \nIn short you could try another window manager which is more lightweight and also consider trying other OS's to see if there is maybe a configuration issue with your Virtualbox and update to the latest version.\n", "Q: How do I know if I am running Wubi or a proper dual-boot? I tried to setup a \"proper\" Windows/Ubuntu dual-boot system, by installing Ubuntu from a USB key. However, I simply could not get the laptop to boot off the USB despite the fact that I made the appropriate changes to the boot device order in the BIOS.\nSo I then turned to Wubi, and (to cut a long story short) it seems I now have a proper dual-boot setup, because I don't need to launch Ubuntu from windows. When I start the laptop, I get that screen that asks me whether I want to run Windows or Ubuntu.\nHowever, I'm still not sure if this is a proper dual-boot setup, because when I run windows, it seems that my C: and D: drives are still the same size. If it was a proper dual boot I'd expect separate partitions to have been created for Ubuntu which would have removed some space from the C: and D: drive sizes displayed in Windows.\nIs there some way that I can confirm whether I'm running a proper dual-boot, and if not, is there some process for converting a Wubi installation to a proper dual-boot?\n\nA: Both Wubi and \"dual boot\" allows you to choose Windows or Ubuntu when you start the computer. However, Wubi uses a virtual partition in a big file inside Windows partition to store the Ubuntu installation and all the user data.\nIn windows\nBoot into Windows and look for the file c:\\ubuntu\\disks\\root.disk (or it may be in D:). If you find it, you have installed using Wubi.\nAlternately in Ubuntu\nOpen a terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T and enter: \nsudo losetup /dev/loop0 \n\nand if that says /host/ubuntu/disks/root.disk you know it's Wubi. (Thanks @bcbc)\nThere is a script to move Wubi installation to its own partition and thus make it a true dual boot.

(Do I need to add 'discard' to the fstab?)\nOr do I need to do a clean install of 12.04 to get TRIM functionality on those drives.\n\nA: No, it does not, the only way right now (At least up to 12.10) is to actually add the discard option to your /etc/fstab file like mentioned here: How to enable TRIM?\nAfter rebooting it should be enabled. I tested the only SSD I have right not, an Intel 520 120GB and in 12.04 it does not activate automatically. This also includes the Beta 1 of 12.10. And with this in mind, I might just add that I am thinking that on 12.10 Final, it will be the same, so a manual approach is the only way right now.\nThe good thing is, after upgrading a kernel in any version of Ubuntu, the discard option stays there. So at least I don't have to turn it on every time I update a kernel.\nThe real question would be: Why trim is not enabled by default?\nAnd I guess it would actually depend on several factors including:\n\n\n*\n\n*What file system to use? (Not all file systems support TRIM)\n\n*What SSD to use? (Some are not good with TRIM. Some don't need TRIM)\n\n*Will RAID be used? (There are several RAID issues when using TRIM)\n\n*What performance impact will have? (Negative, Positive. This varies depending on SSD and file system in use)\n\n\nSo I guess with all of this doubts, the option for one to test it out ourselves is left with the manual approach and to see if there is an actual benefit. I can say that the benefit in an Intel 520 with and without Trim is very little, at least in my case.\n\nA: No, upgrading a kernel does not turn it on automatically - it's still off by default for the kernel shipped with 12.04.\nPlease refer to the manpage of mount:\n\ndiscard/nodiscard\n  Controls whether ext4 should issue discard/TRIM commands to  the\n  underlying  block  device when blocks are freed.  This is useful\n  for SSD devices and sparse/thinly-provisioned LUNs,  but  it  is |\n  off by default until sufficient testing has been done.           | <--\n\n\n", "Q: Can't see YouTube videos in either Firefox or Chromium \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I fix Flash issues? \n\nDont' know why or if it is related, after upgrading Ubuntu 10.04 kernel ( I guess from 2.6.32-38 to -42) I can's see youtube videos.

I get it with Chromium on Ubuntu 12.04.\n\nA: Found an answer, for anyone with a similar problem. Here it is:\nSince this is an old computer, you may have the wrong CPU for version 11 of Flash. Use\ncat /proc/cpuinfo | grep sse2\nand if nothing is printed, that's your problem.\nSee the following for more information on what to do (parts 4, 5, and 6): http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linuxquestions-org-member-success-stories-23/getting-flash-plug-in-to-work-with-older-cpus-4175420481/\n"]
