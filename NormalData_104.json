If your not comfortable with that point look for a motherboard that runs a more standart BIOS.\n\nA: You can test compatibility before installing. Download the install image from ubuntu.com and burn it to a CD or USB (there are instructions on the download page).\nThe simply boot up from this CD or USB stick, and Ubuntu will run from it without touching your hard drive. You can check that everything seems to be working ok, and if you're satisfied click \"install\" to get the ball rolling.\nYour Nvidia card will need proprietary drivers that you can't test when running from the live session, but will be available once you install. In the meantime your system will use a lower-specced open source driver called nouveau to drive the graphics card.\n", "Q: Is there an Akonadi-enabled message notifier in Kubuntu (which does not require KMail running)? IMHO one of the cool things about KDE's groupware cache Akonadi is that it synchronises and indexes your mail even if there is no e-mail software running. I always thought that one of the prime motivations for this is a message notifier that does not require a running mail application. But there is no such thing!\nOr am I simply too stupid to find the settings? Things I am aware of:\n\n\n*\n\n*KMail's native notifications, which only work with KMail running.\n\n*Plasmoids of IMHO somewhat poor quality, which do not work with Akonadi and do not integrate as nicely into KDE's notification system.\n\n*A set of plasmoids dubbed Lion Mail developed by Sebastian KrÃ¼ger  would do the job. However, I found neither packages nor source on the web and even KDE PIM developers apparently don't have a clue about its status, so I assume it is dead.\n\n\nSo: Is there a mail notifier which only requires Akonadi and integrates nicely into the Plasma workspace? Please, I'm desperate! :)\n\nA: I now at least figured out how to find and install LionMail under Kubuntu 11.10. I'm not perfectly happy with it since it does not integrate into the message indicator framework, but it works very well together with Akonadi.\n\n\n*\n\n*Prerequisites: For compiling you need at least these packages (I hope I did not forget some):\nsudo apt-get install cmake kdelibs5-dev kdepimlibs5-dev libakonadi-dev libqtwebkit-dev\n\n\n*Source code: There is a (somewhat outdated) source tarball. Alternatively, get the latest source code from the git repository:\ngit clone git://anongit.kde.org/plasma-lionmail\n\n\n*Installation: Change into the source directory, build and install the widget\ncd plasma-lionmail\ncmake . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nIf you only want to install the widget for yourself, use ~/.local instead of /usr as a prefix. You do not need to sudo the installation in this case.\n\n*Add widgets: Unlock your panel and add the widget 'E-mail notifier'. Viola!\nI will still leave the question open if somebody comes up with a better widget or solution (if anyone is still interested).\n", "Q: xubuntu has cursor issues the newly installed xubuntu on my laptop on has synaptics touchpad installed. I face a strange problem that being my cursor automatically shifts to a random position while typing. Ne idea what could be the reason\n\nA: You probably can fix this by disabling the touchpad while typing.\nYou have two options. \nGraphical\nThis will include some additional gnome libs ;)\nsudo apt-get install tpconfig\n\nIn tpconfig you will find options to enable/disable tap mouse clicks and to disable touchpad while typing.\nCommand line\nIn the XFCE options, add this command to autostart\nsyndaemon -t -k -i 2 -d\n\n\nSee man syndaemon for a full set of options.\n\nA: This could be because part of your wrist/hand is over (but not touching) the touchpad.  This happens on my laptop all the time.  I usually disable it and use a mouse.\nCheck your laptop / netbook manual if there is a key combination to disable the touchpad.\nWorked for me both in Windows XP and Xubuntu.\n", "Q: I can't change the keybinding theme from emacs to default in gnome tweak tool I am using Ubuntu 11.10 Gnome Shell.

However, if you can live with the ugly error message spamming the console, you can work around it:\nAt the time the error is thrown, the _on_activate_uri has been executed, thus everything you might want to do there (print, in your example) should have happened. It certainly works that way for me.\nBasically, by choosing the URI scheme for the model resources wisely, we can emulate either HIDE_DASH or the default fallback (use installed application suitable for the uri scheme) behaviour.\nIn my case, and in your example, we want HIDE_DASH behaviour. When the error is thrown, apparently unity tries to deal with the situation by opening the URI with a suitable application. Thus, to make it behave as in HIDE_DASH, we just have to make sure to give our model resources URIs with a scheme that no installed application can handle. In my case, that would make the URIs start with \"pidgin-lens://\". \nIf your URIs begin with \"http://\", the browser will be opened after _on_activate_uri has run, so that behaviour (NOT_HANDELED/GOTO_DASH_URI) is easily emulated, too.\nSHOW_DASH probably can't be emulated.\n\nA: Seems to be a bug either in the Unity gir file, or in python-gobject. Anyway as a workaround this seems to work:\nret = Unity.ActivationResponse(handled=Unity.HandledType.HIDE_DASH,goto_uri='')\n\n", "Q: Slow dvd burning/reading speeds I have a problem on which I'm struggling since i started using linux a year ago on my desktop, but still haven't found a solution for it.

I recently discovered /etc/environment, which seems a more standard way to setup simple environment variables than scripts, but I was wondering if there was a way to back-reference environment variables in the /etc/environment file.\nThat is, I have this:\nJAVA_HOME=\"/tools/java\"\nGRAILS_HOME=\"/tools/grails\"\nGROOVY_HOME=\"/tools/groovy\"\nGRADLE_HOME=\"/tools/gradle\"\nPATH=\"/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games\"\n\nIf I try to add $JAVA_HOME/bin to the PATH definition, however, I get $JAVA_HOME/bin, and not the interpolated variable. To remedy this, I'm creating environment.sh in profile.d to add the /bin entries to the path, but this seems sloppy and disorganized.\nIs there a way to backreference the environment variables in /etc/environment?\n\nA: The Ubuntu documentation makes this seem impossible.  BUT, there is an answer.\nANSWER: Create persistent, system wide environment variables in /etc/.bashrc \nJAVA_HOME=\"/tools/java\"\n...\nPATH=\"$JAVA_HOME:$PATH\"  \n\nDetails:\nHere are some more details from the Environment Variables documentation.\nThe official recommendation is to use /etc/environment, as you have tried.  The problem is this file is not a script file.  In other words, you cannot use variables in variable declarations.  \nThe documentation continues with 2 other \"Not Recommended\" files\n/etc/profile and /etc/bash.bashrc.  \n/etc/profile \"does little more than invoke the /etc/bash.bashrc file\".  So instead choose  \n/etc/bash.bashrc because \"Ubuntu is configured by default to execute this file whenever a user enters a shell or the desktop environment.\"\n\nA: The /etc/environment file is read by the pam_env PAM module. It only supports simple key-value pairs, with no substitution on the right-hand side.\nIf you want to build the value with substitutions or other shell expansions, you need to go through a shell. /etc/profile (or a file in /etc/profile.d) is the right place for these. This is the traditional place (/etc/environment is a relatively recent innovation, in the history of unix systems), and there's certainly nothing sloppy about using it. The main benefit of /etc/environment is that it allows environment variables to be set even with login methods that do not involve a shell or for users who use a non-Bourne shell, but these are not common in practice.\n", "Q: Cisco VPN stopped working I'm using the Cisco VPN Anyconnect client to connect my home computer to work.

It seems like my users privileges has been degraded.\nDoes any one have an solution to how I disable auto log-in and regain my privileges?\n\nA: You don't have your full capabilities or the ability to access your encrypted files when you're automatically logged in, so try logging out and back in, and see if that gives you these abilities. If that lets you disable automatic login, then that's the fast way.\nIf that doesn't work, then boot from an Ubuntu live CD/DVD or USB flash drive, open a Nautilus (i.e., file browser) window, and click on the volume for the Ubuntu system installed on  your hard drive (it's listed near the top of the left pane of any file browser window) to mount it. Then quit this original Nautilus window and press Alt+F2 and run gksu nautilus (this opens a file browser window as root, with unlimited abilities). In the file browser window created by doing that, find the volume you just mounted (you might have to manually browse to it inside /media), and inside it, go into the etc directory. Inside that, go into the lightdm directory. Make a backup copy of the file lightdm.conf and then edit the original file to remove the line that begins autologin-user=.

I have achieved varying levels of success and I did manage to get four monitors working temporarily but the system constantly froze and X would restart every 5 minutes or so.\nI have since had a chat with the chaps over on #radeon on irc.freenode.net and they have assured me that my config is correct (which would seem to be correct as it worked under previous versions). They suspect a bug in Gnome or X is causing the problems.\nAnyway, long story short. If I was in your position I would not expect even two identical cards to work by simply plugging them in and it all magically works. Expect to have to put a bit of work in getting your X configuration perfect manually. It is quite possible that there is a configuration out there that will work out of the box but until you have seen someone do it, plug the cards in and boot up with all four monitors on, be prepared for a bit of a hard time...\n\nA: For what i know the only one brand that produce that kind of VGA is Matrox http://www.matrox.com/en/ the main difference is that their products are simply focused on CAD and multi-monitor support from years to now, but this is a really professional solution.\nRegarding the consumer market ATI has a better support than Nvidia to multi monitor with it's own Eyeifinity technology.\n\nA: I have done this, and I believe as long as they're both by the same vendor they should work. For me I used an old 8 series Nvidia card with a newer 400 series card... Through the Nvidia Settings it recognized  both cards, However, I had to run a separate X server on each card but was able to have a desktop on all 4 screens. \n", "Q: How do I shutdown Oracle automatically every Friday at 10pm? You install oracle database but need to shutdown at night every Friday at 10pm so that you can make backups. How would you achieve this automatically using the crontab utility? Assume that the script that shutdown and backups the database in called backup.sh and located in /opt/scripts\n\nA: Back up /etc/crontab and then edit it to add this line:\n0 22 * * 5 root /opt/scripts/backup.sh\n(This assumes the script has execute permissions. If not, then put sh  in front of the command.)\nIf the script is to be run by some user other than root, replace root with the appropriate username.\nBy the way, I highly recommend man 5 crontab, which documents the full format for crontabs. (Also available online.)\n\nA: Open your crontab with crontab -e. If it's your first time, you'll be presented with a list of editors to choose from.\nNow add this line to your crontab file\n0 22 * * 5 sh /opt/scripts/backup.sh\n\nsave and close.\n", "Q: Was OMAP3 support dropped for 12.04?

I want to edit files on computer A (e.g.) and computer A should update the file on my server, afterwards the server should update the files on computer B and C. (The same goes for editing files on computer B, afterwards the server has to update the files on A and C.)\nI don't want to have a restriction of disk space, as I already have my own server, so things like Dropbox won't work for me.\nHow am I able to set-up a network like this? It is about music, movies, pictures, documents...\n\nA: KDE's OwnCloud software should work nicely for you.\nHere's an article on how to set it up: http://www.webupd8.org/2011/10/owncloud-2-your-personal-cloud-server.html\n\nA: WMRKameleon, here is my recommendation.\nTo set a chain of network is not in my knowledge, but for the set-up procedure of the cloud-type software, maybe I can help.\n\nFirst of all, you can freely use the OwnCloud. You need to install the LAMP server, because this app require the PHP, Apache and MySQL to work on.\nhttp://owncloud.org/\nThe best thing is, you can integrate your nautilus file manager with the OwnCloud directly without accessing the web-based version. Meaning, just like you do the FTP through a webserver directly from the nautilus without depending on the FileZilla FTP client or FireFTP. Just like using the Ubuntu-One with nautilus integration on the Ubuntu (hope you already used the Ubuntu-One, and you know what am I talking about the direct nautilus integration and so on...). Oh, the integration that I'm talking about called as WebDAV....\nIf you can set up chained-network (cloud) of computer using the LAMP (or any other ways), just use this. If don't, put this in the single computer can be done easily.\n\nSparkleshare is another opensource option. It doesn't need LAMP, but does require git. Like git, it's not so great for large binary files that change often, but it's awesome for maintaining change history on large text files.\nhttp://sparkleshare.org/\nHope this helped... \n\nA: I've never personally used it, but it sounds like SparkleShare is what you're after. You can set up your own server, or use a free one. SparkleShare is a cloud storage solution based on git.\n\nA: Quite a simple solution would be to download the Opera web browser and use Opera Unite. It can make setting up file sharing servers very easy. I don't know about the change a file on B and it will up update on A (the server) and therefore C, but you can upload files to the server remotely so you could do it like that manually. \n\nA: I have 2 more pretty tricky answers to the question and require you go do some research. \nFirst : \nOnly 1 server is hosting the files, and run as the NFS host, then the rest of the servers mount the NFS to the NFS host. \nSecond : \nIf all servers must also have the files, then setup Heartbeat+NFS to clusterize all 3 servers.\nThose answers are from my friend on the Facebook. Actually, we don't need to setup a cloud-networked computer to do a fileserver if the resources on the single PC are good enough to support its standalone-operational-cycle. \nIf we are trying to run a cloud-based company, then we will need multiple of PCs connected to each other to balance the resource usage (called as loadbalancer). 1 PC will control the resouce of the MySQL usage, the other will control the HTTP request (you can use the LiteSpeed or Apache or Nginx) and the other one will control something else. That's the definition of the cloud itself. \nIf we are using to store our files (assume that we are going to store a lot of files), increase the diskspace up to 1TB or 5TB or use the CPU with mutilple hard disk bay, or just buy the NAS storage. \n", "Q: Dell Inspiron 9400 SD card reader not working I'm new in Linux, just installed Ubuntu 11.10 in a Dell Inspiron 9400, everything works fine with the exception of the SD card reader, everytime I insert a card the computer doesn't do anything, its like the SD card reader is not there.\nI did a lspci and it shows the next drivers\n03:01.0 FireWire (IEEE 1394): Ricoh Co Ltd R5C832 IEEE 1394       Controller \n03:01.1 SD Host controller: Ricoh Co Ltd R5C822       SD/SDIO/MMC/MS/MSPro Host Adapter (rev 19)\n03:01.2 System peripheral:    Ricoh Co Ltd R5C592 Memory Stick Bus    Host Adapter (rev 0a)\n03:01.3    System peripheral: Ricoh Co Ltd xD-Picture Card Controller    (rev 05)\nEverytime I insert a memory card, dmesg shows the next\nd status 0x600b00\n[ 2687.227351] end_request: I/O error, dev mmcblk0, sector 64\n[ 2687.229436] mmcblk0: error -110 sending read/write command, response 0x0, card status 0x600b00\n[ 2687.229440] end_request: I/O error, dev mmcblk0, sector 65\n[ 2687.230512] mmcblk0: error -110 sending read/write command, response 0x0, card status 0x600b00\n[ 2687.230515] end_request: I/O error, dev mmcblk0, sector 66\n[ 2687.231588] mmcblk0: error -110 sending read/write command, response 0x0, card status 0x600b00\n[ 2687.231592] end_request: I/O error, dev mmcblk0, sector 67\n[ 2687.232674] mmcblk0: error -110 sending read/write command, response 0x0, card status 0x600b00\n[ 2687.232678] end_request: I/O error, dev mmcblk0, sector 68\n[ 2687.234763] mmcblk0: error -110 sending read/write command, response 0x0, card status 0x600b00\n[ 2687.234766] end_request: I/O error, dev mmcblk0, sector 69\n[ 2687.236864] mmcblk0: error -110 sending read/write command, response 0x0, card status 0x600b00\n[ 2687.236868] end_request: I/O error, dev mmcblk0, sector 70\n[ 2687.238942] mmcblk0: error -110 sending read/write command, response 0x0, card status 0x600b00\n[ 2687.238946] end_request: I/O error, dev mmcblk0, sector 71\n[ 2687.238949] Buffer I/O error on device mmcblk0, logical block 8\n[ 2687.241028] mmcblk0: retrying using single block read\n[ 2687.243104] mmcblk0: error -110 sending read/write command, response 0x0, card status 0x600b00\n[ 2687.243108] end_request: I/O error, dev mmcblk0, sector 64\n[ 2687.245212] mmcblk0: error -110 sending read/write command, response 0x0, card status 0x600b00\n[ 2687.245215] end_request: I/O error, dev mmcblk0, sector 65\n[ 2687.247298] mmcblk0: error -110 sending read/write command, response 0x0, card status 0x600b00\n[ 2687.247302] end_request: I/O error, dev mmcblk0, sector 66\n[ 2687.248389] mmcblk0: error -110 sending read/write command, response 0x0, card status 0x600b00\n[ 2687.248393] end_request: I/O error, dev mmcblk0, sector 67\n[ 2687.250476] mmcblk0: error -110 sending read/write command, response 0x0, card status 0x600b00\n[ 2687.250480] end_request: I/O error, dev mmcblk0, sector 68\n[ 2687.252617] mmcblk0: error -110 sending read/write command, response 0x0, card status 0x600b00\n[ 2687.252621] end_request: I/O error, dev mmcblk0, sector 69\n[ 2687.254737] mmcblk0: error -110 sending read/write command, response 0x0, card status 0x600b00\n\nand more of the same but with different sector number\nI'm using Kernel 3.0.0-12-generic\nBy the way, when I was installing it and Ubuntu asks about installation (If I want to install it along with windows or delete something or change the partitions of the HDD) if I go to the window to change the partition of the disc, Linux detects the SD Card (if there's one inserted course).\nAny help with this it would be appreciated\n-sorry for my English\nThank you\n\nA: I paste here the answer I found on UbuntuForums that worked perfectly for me.

Additionally, you can manually install new themes such as those from gnome-look.org by extracting the theme folders into /usr/share/icons/ or ~/.icons. (Source for manual installation)\nThen, to actually use these themes, you'll need the GNOME Tweak Tool (click this link to install: GNOME Tweak Tool , or use sudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool in a terminal).\nNext, you'll want to open the GNOME Tweak Tool (you can search for it in both Unity and GNOME Shell as \"Advanced Settings\"), then go to Theme > Cursor theme. Use the drop-down menu to select the cursor you want.\nIf you're running Unity, you may then have to run compiz --replace in a terminal or Alt+F2 prompt to make the changes take effect.\n(Source)\n\nA: It is possible to change the cursor to one that has been downloaded outside of the Software Centre - the method is similar to how it was done since Lucid. After downloading the mouse theme, extract the tar.gz file somewhere you can find it later. Next, you'll need superuser access to your filesystem - open a terminal (Ctrl + Alt + T) then enter \n\ngksu nautilus\n\nand press enter. Enter your password in the window that pops up. You now have root access to your filesystem so be careful. Navigate to /usr/share/icons/ Keep this location open, but open up another window or tab and go to the directory where you extracted your mouse theme. Copy the theme folder into /usr/share/icons/ after which you'll be able to see your new theme show up in the Gnome Tweak tool. But we aren't quite finished yet - open the terminal and enter \n\ngksu gedit /usr/share/icons/default/index.theme\n\nand change the name after \"Inherits=\" to the name of your new theme. This makes it the default cursor theme for the entire system and it will be the cursor seen in the login screen.\nSo, although not ideal and not as simple as it once was (think pre-Lucid), it still is possible to install cursor themes in Oneiric.\nEdit: You'll likely need to reboot (or logout) to see the changes.\n\nA: You can use Gnome Tweak Tool (sudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool) to change the mouse theme in Ubuntu 11.10\n", "Q: Keeping installed packages across dist upgrade Ever since ubuntu provides 'upgrade' installation path (since 10.04 if I'm not mistaken), I took it and hoping that my installed packaged will be kept intact or automatically upgraded.

I am trying to find the actual package name for the appearance app in ubuntu 11.10, went through synaptic and cant \n\nA: Appearance is one of the the control panels in the GNOME Control Center. In Ubuntu 11.10, the specific command to bring up Appearance is gnome-control-center background. (This is what gets run when you search for Appearance in the Unity dash and click on the result.) The package that provides GNOME Control Center executable has the same name as that executable: gnome-control-center\nIn earlier versions of Ubuntu, there was a specific executable that got run to bring up the Appearance control panel: gnome-appearance-properties (But this was still provided by the gnome-control-center package.)\nIn case you're interested, to find out this information, I opened a Terminal window (Ctrl+Alt+T) and created a file called 1 containing information about all the running processes on my system:\n\nps ax > 1\nThen I opened the Unity dash and searched for Appearance, and clicked on the one search result. The Appearance control panel came up. I returned to the open Terminal window and created a new file called 2 containing information about the running processes on the system now:\nps ax > 2\nThen I compared their contents:\ndiff 1 2\nThat gave me this text, in which there were only a few unpaired entries, of which the one that was most obviously correct was gnome-control-center background. (Then, if you're not sure that's the right one, you can check your answer by running that command to see if it brings up the Appearance window.)\nThen I went to the online Ubuntu package information database, and under \"Search the contents of packages\", made sure \"Oneiric\" was selected as the release and searched for gnome-control-center. That revealed that this executable is provided by the package of the same name.\nThat's somewhat technical (and there's other ways to do it, like by looking in .desktop files to find the command), so please feel free to continue posting questions about this sort of thing. But if you feel up to it, you might be able to figure out the answers to these kinds of questions when you have them in the future...and when other users ask them.\n", "Q: Unity Interface Missing \nPossible Duplicate:\nUnity doesn't load, no Launcher, no Dash appears \n\nI currently have Gnome Shell, Unity, and Unity 2D (or Ubuntu and Ubuntu 2D, as they are now called) on Ubuntu 11.10.

From there Grub decides on your choice to boot Windows or Ubuntu.\nIf you want to boot Ubuntu from a virtual machine then you need a bootmanager (Grub) the same way you need it on a real system.\nTo achieve this you either need to install Grub in your Ubuntu partition or you need to create a small boot partition for Grub that could easily be added to your Virtual Machine. Read here, and in the GNU Grub manual for further details.\n\nWarning: Both methods could break your dual boot setup or could make your Windows or Ubuntu system unbootable if you made something wrong.\n\n\nThe safe way:\nA much safer way to have access for your host and guest data would be installing Ubuntu on it's own 10-15 GB VDI and just mounting your host /home in the guest OS for data acess. By doing so you will also be able to load host or guest kernel modules without breaking the host Ubuntu installation.\n\nA: I found a perfectly working workaround. sda7 is the partition where I installed linux, 5,6,7 are the native partition I want to virtualize, and \"ceztko\" is my home :P\n\n\n*\n\n*from the native linux, reinstall the grub to the native linux partition:\nsudo grub-install --force /dev/sda7\n\n*copy the partition boot sector to your home:\n# dd if=/dev/sda7 of=/home/ceztko/virtualbox-native.mbr bs=512 count=1\n\n*copy virtualbox-native.mbr to your windows installation\n\n*Reboot to Windows and from Administrator prompt:\nVBoxManage internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename C:\\users\\ceztko\\ubuntu.vmdk -rawdisk \\\\.\\PhysicalDrive0 -partitions 5,6,7 -mbr c:\\users\\ceztko\\Dropbox\\resources\\virtualbox-native.mbr\n\n*Run VirtualBox and assign the new virtual drive to the virtual machine.\n\n*Enjoy!\n\n\nThis may be a bug in Virtualbox. But better I guess is a bug in grub, confused by the non-accessible Windows partitions when installed as mbr in the boot disk. Â \n\nA: I had a similar issue and solved it a little bit different, i.e., without booting into the native Linux.\nIf you specified the -partitions parameter for the .vmdk rawdisk, an image of the MBR and some subsequent sectors will be also created, which you can overwrite directly within the virtual Linux without affecting the original physical sectors. Check the vmdk file for reference. In my case the flat image covered the first 32kb.\nIn order to boot into the virtual Linux for the first time, you could use e.g., the SuperGrubDisk ISO image. After a successful boot, fix the MBR from the local installation under the virtual environment as usual.\nNote that if you want to install grub on your virtual MBR it may be the case that the MBR is not large enough to fit the whole grub image. You notice this only if you attempt to boot the system. In this case you can enlarge the flat image representing the first sectors of your harddisk. You need to adapt the .vmdk file accordingly.\n\nA: The complete solution:\nThe normal place of an OS loader, Grub is one, is \"on the PBR\", inside the partition. And that's the safest place against its destruction, instead of exposing it on the MBR.\nAnd that makes Linux boot the conventional way, by loading the PBR and executing it. GAG is a nice program to multi-boot and/or to boot logical partitions. It's best to get it on a CD like SystemRescueCd together with a host of tools. Burn the CD or use the ISO file and boot it, then select GAG then configure it, done.\nIf you don't suspend/resume 6 months long as Linux allows, Tux'll greet you everyday. Thanks for the tip that GAG will rewrite that virtual MBR.\nAnd if you can contact GAG's author, tell him:\n\n\n*\n\n*My eternal thanks\n\n*That he should start configuration with a fully populated Main Screen and let delete, reorder and modify the icons. That makes an already usable configuration right away instead of having to do a lot of manipulations to get started.\n\n", "Q: ATI/AMD proprietary FGLRX graphics install fails, how can I resolve the problem?

However, the excerpts you have selected don't actually show any changed lines. (Those would be preceded with - or + characters, depending on whether they're being removed or added.)\n@@ -15,4 +22,6 @@ means that 4 lines starting with line 15 in the old file are are changed (or not changed, but shown as context), and correspond to 6 lines starting with line 22 in the new file. (The simplest and overwhelmingly most common way for this to occur is that the number of lines added in the new file exceeds the number of lines removed in the new file by 7, such that what started on line 15 in the old file starts on line 22 in the new file, prior to application of the changes about to be specified.)\nSince this is a context diff, it provides some lines for context that don't specify changes. This is useful to allow people editing the files (developers/maintainers, when it's source code, as in this case) to know what's going on by skimming the diff. But it has the other useful purpose of making it possible, in many cases, to apply a diff created against one version of a file against another version of the same file, provided that it doesn't change the exact same lines that were already changed (i.e., that were changed after the diff was created but before it is being applied).\nThe following lines are presumably present, as context, in the diff, because there was a change shortly before them (so they are context provided after a change):\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    myparams = {\"server\":\"mpilgrim\", \\\nWhereas these lines are presumably present, as context, in the diff, because there is going to be a change shortly after them (so they are context provided before a change):\n                     \"pwd\":\"secret\" \\\n                     }\nThese lines are presumably not sufficiently close to any change specified in the diff to be included as context:\n                    \"database\":\"master\", \\\n                    \"uid\":\"sa\", \\\nThat's why they seem as though they are missing in the diff. They're not really missing, because a diff is not supposed to show you the entire file. The take home message of all this is that their absence is not because the diff is specifying that they be removed. It is certainly not specifying that--if it were, it would have to include them (with - signs before them to indicate their removal).\n(I say presumably above not because there is any strong likelihood that this isn't what is going on, but because while the diff utility will create diffs with specified numbers of before and after context lines, you could, if you wanted, manually create or modify a diff so that it had more or fewer context lines in some places than in others, and it would still be a valid diff, provided that, where necessary, the numbers in @@ lines where changed to match.)\nFor more information about diff (the diff, patch, diff3, and sdiff utilities, and also the diff/patch format), see the GNU diff documentation.

Is there any hope for this feature to be implemented in the near future.\nThis would actually make me pay for U1.\n\nA: You can use the application FolderSync Lite and a UbuntuOne account to sync one or more folders between a Ubuntu machine and your Android device.\nThe application allows syncing either way, or two-way, and does work for entire folders.\nThe application also supports many other cloud services, like Dropbox and Box.net.\n\nA: You can setup Dropbox at http://www.dropbox.com.

As the title suggests, I can't figure out a way to share a folder outside my home folder using Ubuntu One. When browsing to my work partition using Nautilus, every folder has the \"Share\" option grayed out.\n\nA: You could try using a mount --bind command. Something like\nmount --bind /path/to/folder /home/username/folder_to_sync\n\nThis should make the contents of /path/to/folder available in both places.\nUbuntu-one doesn't support symlinks, but it might support binding mounts. If it does work, you can add a line to /etc/fstab\n/path/to/folder /home/username/folder_to_sync    none    bind    0    0\n\nThat way it will always mount on boot.\n\nA: I just did a test, created a new folder /new and gave it permissions 777.

Everything is okay except the scroll bar, especially in Firefox. It's very, very tiny, especially in long pages! \nAlso, I don't know why there is a very small gap between scroll bar and border of screen so I can't click on scroll bar without seeing it .\nScreenshot: \n\n\nA: One can tweak the scrollbars of Firefox assuming that the overlay scrollbars aren't being used.\nUnfortunately,if I understand correctly, scrollbars (in Firefox) are \"anonymous content\". That means one can't tweak them using userChrome.css or userContent.css.\nTo tweak scrollbars, I use the Stylish extension for Firefox.\nAfter you've installed it, you'll be able to style your scrollbars:\nHere's my very simplistic version:\n@namespace xul url(http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul);   \n/*scrollbars*/\nscrollbar { -moz-appearance: none !important; background: #777 !important}\nscrollbar[orient=\"vertical\"] { width: 7px !important}\nscrollbar[orient=\"horizontal\"] { height: 7px !important}\nscrollbar thumb {\n-moz-appearance: none !important; \n-moz-border-radius: 4px !important;\nbackground: maroon !important;\nmin-width: 8px !important;\nmax-width: 8px !important;\nborder: 1px !important;\n}\n\nIf you go over to the forum for that extension and look around, you'll find more parameters to tweak.\nAs already pointed out, the length of the vertical scrollbar is usually a function of the length of the web page. There maybe a way to set a minimum length but I haven't looked for that.\n\nA: I think the problem is not with the scrollbar, but rather with with the web page itself. Regardless, I was hoping that you might be able to change the min size of the scroll bar by using a custom userChrome.css file, but apparently not.

I have been creating a custom live CD of Ubuntu 11.10 using remastersys, everything goes well except that the live session asks for a login. the login is automatically set as \"custom\" and the password is blank. this is fine, but I would rather it went direct to the desktop in a live session as you would expect from other distro live cds.\nI have asked on the remastersys forums, the question has gotten a lot of views, but no answer as of yet, I am wondering has anyone here remastered a distro and come across the login problem, and if so, how did you fix it?\n\nA: Try configuring your login manager on the system to be remastered. Enable autologin there and I believe it will be the same in LiveCD. My root account password saves on remastered LiveCD and on installation of this remaster, so login manager's settings mostly save.\nThis is just a guess, though.\nAnd you could also look at the new version of remastersys here, they added some options for grub customization and plymouth theme, so I believe you can enable autologin with that version aswell.   \nIf anyone posts any good response, please ignore this one, since these are just guesses.\n\nA: for solving this problem i was making Live-Cds the last three weeks day n night \nand i tried every tip and configuration-option in remastersys :-p !\nBut now i think i found the \"problem\" and my last 2 Live-Cd making with remastersys\nhas no login-prompt anymore and starts with auto-login!\nFirst let me tell you that you have to use the DISTRO-MODE and NOT the BACKUP-MODE!\nIn Backup-Mode of Remastersys always your last user and password is saved!\nAnd it really helps if you had a clean system-Install with Auto-login choosen first and NO encryption of your homefolder! \nIt doesn t matter if you have make password-prompt later on- but if you make your live-cd make Auto-Login ON again!\nAnd now comes the \"Trick\": In the Gdm-Login-Manager-Preferences you can choose timebased Auto-Login under the normal Auto-Login option!

I am a bit confused about these two terms. Are there differences between them?\n\nA: The terms free software and open source software do mean different things, though the categories of software they refer to are almost exactly the same.\nWhat is free software?\nFree software is defined in terms of freedom (not price), and is not the same thing as freeware. The idea is that there are certain freedoms on the part of users that free software respects (but which non-free software, also called proprietary software, does not respect). This includes the freedom to use and study the software, as well as to distribute and improve it.\nThe Free Software Foundation is an advocacy and activist organization for free software, funds and otherwise supports the GNU project (which develops a significant fraction of the software that goes into GNU/Linux distributions such as Ubuntu) and is the organizational author of many of the most popular free software licenses including the GNU General Public License. The FSF defines free software as software that respects the four freedoms, which I quote here [linkifications mine]:\n(0) The freedom to run the program, for any purpose (freedom 0).\n(1) The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.\n(2) The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor (freedom 2).\n(3) The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.\nAnother useful and important source about what does and does not constitute free software is the Debian Free Software Guidelines (from the Debian project, the GNU/Linux distribution from which Ubuntu is derived, see also this article).\nOne need not subscribe to any particular ideology to use and advocate for free software. But the ideological basis of free software is the idea that these freedoms are inherently good (or at least good for important political reasons external to technical questions of software quality and profitability), that people have the obligation to respect these freedoms, and that software should be judged in significant part by whether or not it respects these freedoms. Not all users of free software are adamant about these freedoms, and some believe in their importance but only to a limited extent, but many users are dedicated to them, and comprise the free software movement.\nWhat is Open Source?\nSome proponents of free software thought it was good for other reasons -- specifically, the idea that, because of the way freedom facilitates collaboration, free software has an advantage over proprietary software and often tends to be technically superior. Some thought that freedom is inherently important but not as important as developing technically good software, or that freedom is as important or more important than developing technically good software but that it was important to advocate for the adoption of free software on other grounds in order to be effective.\nThus, the open source movement was born. One of the ideas that went into this movement is the notion that advocacy targeted at businesses should emphasize the technical merits and profitability of open (free) development models, rather than talking about ethical or political issues. The Open Source Initiative was formed as an advocacy organization for the open source movement and to identify and formally approve licenses as open source. The OSI's Open Source Definition is based directly on the Debian Free Software Guidelines, which should be no surprise, as the actual category of software that is considered free is almost exactly the same as the actual category of software that is considered open source.\nThe old Open Source Initiative FAQ expresses both the substantial similarities and differing viewpoints between free software and open source ideologies:\n\nThe Open Source Initiative is a marketing program for free software. It's a pitch for \"free software\" on solid pragmatic grounds rather than ideological tub-thumping. The winning substance has not changed, the losing attitude and symbolism have.\n\nHow do the ideologies of free software and open source compare/contrast in practice?\nWhile the ideologies behind free software and open source software are different--or are at least stated quite differently -- identifying specifically how the terms differ as they are practically used in communities is a bit more complicated. Since they refer to almost exactly the same category of software, people tend to choose whichever term they think is best, whether that be for reasons of clarity, ideology, social approval, habit, or other reasons. Furthermore, while free software and open source ideologies are distinct, there are also viewpoints that seem to bridge the two, or at least to blur where one ends and the other begins. For example, in his foreword to the paperback compendium edition of Eric S. Raymond's The Cathedral and the Bazaar (ISBN 0-596-00108-8), Bob Young wrote:\n\nFreedom is not an abstract concept in business.\nThe success of any industry is almost directly related to the degree of freedom the suppliers and the customers of that industry enjoy. Just compare the innovation in the U.S. telephone business since AT&T lost its monopoly control over American consumers with the previously slow pace of innovation when those customers had no freedom to choose.\n\nThis arguably does not make direct reference to ethical and political issues. But consider one of the somewhat similar considerations cited by Peruvian Congressman Edgar Villanueva in explaining his push for the the state to use free rather than proprietary software (English translation by Graham Seaman, also hosted here, with original here):\n\nIn respect of the jobs generated by proprietary software in countries like ours, these mainly concern technical tasks of little aggregate value; at the local level, the technicians who provide support for proprietary software produced by transnational companies do not have the possibility of fixing bugs, not necessarily for lack of technical capability or of talent, but because they do not have access to the source code to fix it. With free software one creates more technically qualified employment and a framework of free competence where success is only tied to the ability to offer good technical support and quality of service, one stimulates the market, and one increases the shared fund of knowledge, opening up alternatives to generate services of greater total value and a higher quality level, to the benefit of all involved: producers, service organizations, and consumers.\n\nSince the practical consequences of adopting free software include political and moral ramifications (in this case, Villanueva argues, the intellectual and economic empowerment of the Peruvian people), there is some overlap in free software and open source thinking (as well as almost complete overlap in software recommendations).\nOne of the initial, explicit goals of the open source movement was de-emphasizing explicitly pro-liberty advocacy, as articulated early in this article:\n\nThe implication of this label is that we intend to convince the corporate world to adopt our way for economic, self-interested, non-ideological reasons.\n\nBut another original motivating reason for adopting an alternative term was the idea that the term open source was less confusing than the term free software, since the English word \"free\" can also mean \"gratis,\" i.e., \"having a price of zero\". See this foundational essay. That attracted some people who were themselves more drawn to free software for ethical or political reasons than out of the belief that it was a better development model or business model, but who agreed that the term \"free software\" was lacking and ought to be replaced. While this term has proven confusing, the term \"open source\" has proven confusing as well, and Richard Stallman (founder of the Free Software Foundation) has argued that the term \"open source\" is inherently more confusing and less adequately descriptive.\nWhat term should I use?\nAs I (start to) write this, there are five answers already posted to this question. Two of them (this and this) are basically correct in their characterizations of open source, and one of them is basically correct in its characterization of free software and another one almost correct. (Please note that these answers may have been edited, so this should not be taken as judgment of them in their present state.) While I admit that the sampling here is hardly conclusive, I would suggest that each of us should use whichever term s/he prefers for reasons other than clarity, since both terms are surrounded by substantial confusion.\nFor situations where it is desirable to refer simultaneously to the (already overlapping) concepts of free software and open source software, there exist the synonymous terms F/OSS (Free / Open Source Software), FOSS (Free [and] Open Source Software) and FLOSS (Free / Libre / Open Source Software). See this article on those terms, as well as this article on the more general topic of alternative terms for free software.\nIs there free software that is not open source?\nProbably not. Going by the Free Software Definition and the Open Source Definition, freedom 0 probably requires OSD criteria 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10; freedom 1 requires OSD criterion 2 (and possibly 7); freedom 2 probably requires OSD criteria 1, 7, 8, and 9; and freedom 3 probably requires OSD criteria 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, and 10.\nIs there open source software that is not free?\nGoing by the definitions, yes, because with the exception of the requirement to provide source code, the Open Source Definition concerns itself only with what a license may require. In contrast, as per the Free Software Definition, for software to be free it must actually be possible to exercise the four freedoms.\nPractically speaking, the vast majority of open source software is also free software. However, the phenomenon of tivoization renders some open-source software non-free, at least in practice. When software is designed to run on a particular device, and that device is designed to prevent modified versions from actually working, users are not able to exercise freedom 1.\nThe relatively recent issue of devices running open source software that is in practice not free has reignited disagreement between proponents of open source and free software concepts. The open source movement touts FOSS's technical merits. But what about when software's functionality is not actually under the control of its user? Richard Stallman writes [ellipsis mine]:\n\nUnder pressure from the movie and record companies, software for individuals to use is increasingly designed specifically to restrict them. This malicious feature....is the antithesis in spirit of the freedom that free software aims to provide. And not just in spirit: since the goal of DRM is to trample your freedom, DRM developers try to make it hard, impossible, or even illegal for you to change the software that implements the DRM.\nYet some open source supporters have proposed âopen source DRMâ software. Their idea is that, by publishing the source code of programs designed to restrict your access to encrypted media and by allowing others to change it, they will produce more powerful and reliable software for restricting users like you. The software would then be delivered to you in devices that do not allow you to change it.\nThis software might be open source and use the open source development model, but it won't be free software since it won't respect the freedom of the users that actually run it.\n\nThere are divergent ideas about precisely what freedoms software must respect in practice in order to be free. But disputes over whether or not tivoization makes software non-free are still disputes about freedom. For example, Linus Torvalds thinks tivoization (a term he dislikes) of Linux should not be prohibited, but this is out of the belief that it does not actually prevent people from freely using the software (on another device).\nHow do free software and open source apply to Ubuntu?\nMost of the software in Ubuntu is free software and open source software. A fraction of the software in Ubuntu is neither. (None is one but not the other.) The Ubuntu project aims to produce a system that is as free as possible while still fully usable by as many users as possible.\nWhen you install Ubuntu, you are given the option to install non-free software to perform functionality like playing MP3 files. In Ubuntu, Additional Drivers suggests and facilitates installation of non-free drivers for some devices like video and network cards. Non-free software (like Adobe Flash and Skype) is also available in the multiverse and partner repositories. Furthermore, depending on one's definition of \"includes,\" Ubuntu might be considered to include non-free software in that the Software Center provides the ability to install proprietary payware.\nWhile these and other factors render Ubuntu (and most other highly popular GNU/Linux distributions) not completely free, and arguably there are distributions that are more thoroughly free, Ubuntu and its community have brought free software--and support for it--to thousands (if not millions) of people who would otherwise likely never have used it, and has contributed positively to the spread of free software around the world, and to people's ability to use free software in their own language. The Ubuntu philosophy is stated in terms of freedom and in terms of users' capabilities:\n\nWe believe that every computer user:\n\n*\n\n*Should have the freedom to download, run, copy, distribute, study, share, change and improve their software for any purpose, without paying licensing fees.\n\n*Should be able to use their software in the language of their choice.\n\n*Should be able to use all software regardless of disability.\n\nOur philosophy is reflected in the software we produce, the way we distribute it and our licensing terms, too - Ubuntu Licence Policy.\nInstall Ubuntu and you can rest assured that all our software meets these ideals. Plus, we are continually working to ensure that every piece of software you could possibly need is available under a licence that gives you those freedoms.\n\nIt then goes on to discuss and praise both the free software and open source movements and to say:\n\nAlthough some people regard âfreeâ and âopen source' as competing movements with different ends, we do not. Ubuntu proudly includes members who identify with both.\n\nWhether you consider your goals to be aligned with free software, with open source, with both, or even with neither, you are encouraged to use Ubuntu if it serves your needs. And so long as you are willing to practice humanity toward others by following the code of conduct, you are encouraged to participate in the Ubuntu community!\n\nA: There is no authority which can define the meaning of a word. It is defined by how it is used, and therefore the meaning of a word can change over time or a word can mean different things to different groups of people at the same time. \nThat said: wikipedia, the Free Software Foundation, The Debian Project, The Ubuntu Project, GNU all agree on one thing: \"free software\" is about freedom, not cost. Free Software can cost money, or not. \nThere is not that much agreement on the term \"Open source software\". While some say that just means that the source code is made available (some sentences on wikipedia) and GNU. Others would argue that free software and open source software are about the same ideas, e.g. opensource.org. However, the right to distribute the modified software is not necessarily seen a part of the \"open source software\" (wikipedia but contrary to this, again the Open source definition). \nTo put some of the examples from other answers into those categories: skype: neither; Fedora: free software and open source software; Google Chrome: neither (as far as I know), but Chromium is free software and open source software; \nConclusion:\nMany groups have devoted their time and effort into confusing people about these terms. Especially the Free Software Foundation, which seems to use the term \"open source software\" purposefully differently than the Open Source Initiative. And the Open Source Initiative, which introduced and heavily promoted a new term (open source software) to essentially mean the same as the already established term \"free software\".\nYou can also read more here.\n\nA: I'd say that an illustration of the difference, which shows that Shuttleworth is more open source than free software, can be found in the following quote (in response to cooperation with proprietary companies):\n\nIf your way of seeing the world IS genuinely more productive,\n  effective, efficient, insightful and usable, then you should be\n  confident that you will win in the long term\n\n(slashdot interview)\nI think a free software opinion might indeed not be so confident that things will become free in the long term, and not consider it so relevant anyway when it comes to cooperation. You can compare it to thinking that slavery is bound to disappear because it is not efficient: people work better when they are free, with more innovation and no risk of revolt. It's true, but you can also be opposed to slavery as a more abstract principle.\n\nA: The term Free Software and Open-source Software comes from two movements :-\n\n*\n\n*Free software movement and\n\n*Open-source movement\nDefinition:-\n\n*\n\n*The Free Software Definition\n\n*The Open Source Definition\nThere is two articles find on GNU related to this which are:\n\n*\n\n*http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html (Newer & Better)\n\nThe two terms describe almost the same category of software, but they stand for views based on fundamentally different values. Open source is a development methodology; free software is a social movement. For the free software movement, free software is an ethical imperative, essential respect for the users' freedom. By contrast, the philosophy of open source considers issues in terms of how to make software âbetterââin a practical sense only. It says that nonfree software is an inferior solution to the practical problem at hand.\n\n\n\n*https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-for-freedom.html (Older & superseded)\n\nThe fundamental difference between the two movements is in their values, their ways of looking at the world. For the Open Source movement, the issue of whether software should be open source is a practical question, not an ethical one. As one person put it, âOpen source is a development methodology; free software is a social movement.â For the Open Source movement, non-free software is a suboptimal solution. For the Free Software movement, non-free software is a social problem and free software is the solution.\n\nOn OSI FAQ:- What is \"free software\" and is it the same as \"open source\"?\n\nThe FSF uses a shorter, four-point definition of software freedom when evaluating licenses, while the OSI uses a longer, ten-point definition. The two definitions lead to the same result in practice, but use superficially different language to get there.\n\nI am here attaching the details on:\nHow Free Software and Open Source Relate as Categories of Programs\n\n       /----------------------------------------------\\\n      / |                                            | \\\n     /  |                                            |  \\\n    /   |                                            |   \\\n        |                                            |\n        |       Source license is GNU *GPL, Apache,  |\n        |        original BSD, modified BSD,         |\nfree    |        X11, expat, Python, MPL, etc.,      |\n        |        and executable is not tivoized      |   open source\n        |                                            | \n        |                                            |\n    \\   |                                            |\n     \\  |                                            |\n      \\ |                                            |   /\n       \\----------------------------------------------  /\n        |     tivoized (tyrant) devices          | O | /\n        ----------------------------------------------/\n\nRemarkable (quoted) Notes:-\n\n*\n\n*Among all programs that are open source, only a minuscule fraction are not free.

The Amarok 1.4 series scrobbled the songs I played via ipod (and also had great ipod song transfer functionality). I've not been able to scrobble songs played via my ipod then synced to a media player since my upgrade to 11.10 (and the subsequent total loss of Amarok 1.4). \nI see various media players (clementine, banshee) have requests in for this feature but I'd like to believe that something, somewhere has ipod scrobbling in Ubuntu! Was the 1.4 series of Amarok the only thing that had it? Good music management is one of the main reasons I've used Linux (besides stability, clean interfaces, ease of development, etc). The lack of ipod scrobbling to last.fm makes me a very sad panda.\n\nA: No need to look far, good old Rhythmbox does it! And Banshee now does it too! See: Does Banshee support Last.FM iPod scrobbling?\n\nA: I find the songbird support for last.fm to be more than adequate.

I've Googled and the best I could find was someone getting the card to 'work' on Linux. Nothing specific about Ubuntu and this card.\nSpecifically, I want to be able to use the full 1900x1200 resolution and watch 1080p movies.\nIf yes, was it very complicated to get working?\nOr has someone used this card with an older version of Ubuntu?\nNote: I do not have the card yet, I am debating buying it, but would like to know beforehand because there is a restocking fee if I have to return it.\n\nA: I have the exact same graphics card, and I have had good luck with it so far. It works out of the box with the built in radeon driver. That driver supports the card surprisingly well. 2D & 3D acceleration works to some extent (including smooth performance in Compiz and Gnome Shell), but you'll have less luck doing 3D games or the like. On the bright side, Minecraft doesn't work very well with the free driver :b\nSo, to gain those other things (including making Minecraft work very, very well) you can install the properietary fglrx driver. This is available right away from the Additional Drivers tool. Just open System Settings and Additional Drivers will be listed in the Hardware section.\n\nThe fglrx driver does good 3D acceleration and all the bits in between. It definitely meets the two requirements you listed, as far as I have noticed (though, to be honest, I don't think I have played a full-length 1080p video thus far; just little things).\nUnfortunately, the fglrx driver isn't quite perfect. It has a bug that breaks Gnome Shell, so that's why I'm currently using the built in driver. If you don't care about Gnome Shell, that bug won't be a problem.\nIt's pretty unusual that video playback in Ubuntu will use the video processing hardware built in to the GPU, so any claims of \"1080p video playback!\" are probably not so clear-cut. The video hardware in the Radeon HD 6800 series can be accessed through VA API, which is still somewhat new. We're still waiting for VA API support to land in GStreamer (the standard media framework in Ubuntu, used by the default Movie Player), but you might have luck if you install the VLC Media Player, which reportedly does VA API right now!\n\nA: As I know Ubuntu can download, if the videocard manufacteur made, the software for graphic or whatever. But in general you don't need any driver to watch hd videos and set the resolution. I have an acer with ubuntu and i don't have any video driver and it works fine everything, even better that worked in w7.\n", "Q: Remove wacom from my system I purged the \"xserver-xorg-input-wacom\" package, yet the Wacom entries still appear in gnome-control-panel and my system menus.\nHow can I get rid of them?\n\nA: You should be able to remove wacom entries from the interface by renaming or deleting the /usr/share/applications/gnome-wacom-panel.desktop file.\nTo rename, run the following, then logout/login. \ncd /usr/share/applications\n\nsudo mv gnome-wacom-panel.desktop gnome-wacom-panel.desktop-renamed\n\n", "Q: Having trouble setting up Synergy (via Quicksynergy) Synergy is an app that allows two or more computers to share a keyboard and mouse.

I installed gnome-shell from a 3rd party repository a while ago, but now it's in the official repository.  How do I switch it and all it's dependencies to the official repository?  I tried removing the other PPA and apt-get clean && apt-get update && apt-get upgrade, but it doesn't seem to detect any change.  What do I do?\n\nA: If you removed the other PPA from your sources and still don't get any update, that probably means that the version in the PPA is newer than the one in the official repository (even if you remove the PPA, the packages remain installed).\nTo make sure about that, you can use the apt-cache policy <package_name> command. In my case, it shows that the version available from the official repositories is 3.2.1-0ubuntu1. In your case it should show that that version is available, but you have installed a different one.\nIf you really want to have the same version as in the official repositories, you can downgrade the package. However, I wouldn't recommend that since my understanding is that the PPA version isn't causing any problem. Anyway, to downgrade the package, run the following command:\n$ sudo apt-get install gnome-shell=3.2.1-0ubuntu1\n\nNote: Some other packages might be installed/removed during the downgrade process if dependencies have changed for the two different versions of the package.\n\nA: Use ppa-purge (not installed by default) to disable the PPA, that will automatically revert your packages to the official versions.\n\nA: You can't switch packages to a different repository.

After using the laptop for several days without rebooting, I start to get into awful swapping problems (combined with very poor responsiveness during IO operations, swapping 10mb could mean that the desktop is unresponsivel for 5s, but 200mb at once will mean that it is completely unresponsive for several minutes straight while it grinds the disk).\nWith all interface-apps shut down, the system monitor is reporting that over half of my 4GB is being used on something. What exactly, though? System Monitor, when showing 'All Processes', does not list enough to add up to 2GB.\nUsing the top command shows similar numbers - not a lot of processes using RAM, but the statistics show half used. \nMy concern is what is actually using the memory up that I don't see?\n\nA: The process list of the system monitor is not very detailed on my opinion. You should better use the command \ntop\n\nin a terminal to monitor your ressources - system monitor consumes much CPU power with default settings.\nStrange, however, is, that your ubuntu uses the swap memory in this situation... on my computer it fills the memory until there is nearly no space left and then uses the swap memory. However, it is long ago that that happened as I have 16 GB memory installed. So if the numbers in top are similar (much free RAM, but using swap), first try to disable swap (comment it out in /etc/fstab), hopefully performance increases then. With 4 GB system memory ubuntu should work without swap for standard applications.

I've tried:\nsudo apt-get purge libreoffice* && sudo apt-get install libreoffice-writer\n\nbut it still shows up blank.\n\nA: It seems like the launcher icons are tied to a *.desktop file and it seems like there are *.desktop files in /usr/share/applications and in ~/.local/share/applications.

I want to set up regular backups, and deja-dup seems like a nice tool.  However, I want to put my backups on an extension USB drive that I have, not on a remote network location.  Naturally, this drive is not always connected.  If I configure deja-dup to backup to a directory on this drive (e.g. /media/extention/backup), what would happen?  Will it prompt me to connect the drive when it is missing (the desired behavior), or just fail silently?  Is there some way to tweak it to do so?\nI can roll my own cron-based backup script that checks if this drive is mounted, but I would really prefer to use an existing, integrated tool.\n\nA: Deja Dup will wait for you to connect your external drive. So, when your external USB drive is not connected, Deja Dup will show a Notification saying that \"Backup will continue when <external USB drive's partition name> gets connected.\"\nSo, when you do connect your external drive, Deja Dup will start backup automatically. Otherwise, it will wait in the background till the drive is connected.\n\nA: The only downside to this is it will nag you constantly until you connect the USB drive.  I set this up on my daughters laptop as a manual step.  \nI configured dejay dup as desired (daily) but left 'automatic backups' OFF.  I then made a script file to run deja-dup --backup and pointed a launcher to it.  She now runs the launcher after connecting the USB drive.  The first backup is long/intense but subsequent backups are short/quick.\n", "Q: Remove partition for failed installation I tried installing ubuntu alongside windows 7\nhttps://askubuntu.com/questions/77499/installing-ubuntu-alongside-windows\nand I failed so I decided to go with wubi again. after installing it, I noticed a separate hard disk. I investigated and found out that this hard disk is actually for the failed installation. \nI don't know where to find it inside the windows system. can anyone please teach me how to remove the 'failed' hard disk. \nhere's a screenshot\n\nthe left side is the current filesystem. the right side on the other hand is the 'failed' harddisk. i verified that it is the failed one because the wubi installation will provide a 'host' folder for the current partition it is currently installed.\nI tried looking for the 'failed' one using the windows' command-line but i don't know where to look for the 'failed' disk.\n(I used the cmd coz I don't want root.disk to mysteriously disappear again.)\nsee http://ubuntu-with-wubi.blogspot.com/2011/01/mystery-of-disappearing-rootdisk.html\n\nA: Boot Windows and go to the Disk Management: click Start, type Disk Manage..., and select 'Create and format hard disk partitions'. There you'll see the 28GB Healthy Primary partition (with no filesystem shown - so it won't show NTFS). \nTo see what this looks like, check the highlighted partitions in the following picture:\n\nJust right click on the partition and select \"Delete Volume\". There'll probably also be a smaller one created for Swap. Then you might want to create a new NTFS partition in that space, or merge it back to an existing partition. Since the Ubuntu installer likely created an extended partition you'll have to delete that as well if you want to merge.\nBefore deleting: make double sure that you are not booting with the grub bootloader or your computer will not boot. It doesn't seem likely given your description, but you should check. Running the bootinfoscript is one way to tell. Another way is to check which menu you see when you boot.\nIf you're booting with Grub the first menu you see will look like this:\n\nIf you're booting with the windows boot loader (and you have Wubi installed), the first menu you see will be the windows boot manager:\n\nTo reinstall the Windows boot loader (Windows 7/Vista):\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot Windows and create a Windows repair CD\n\n*Boot from the CD to a repair command prompt and run:\nbootrec.exe /fixboot\n\n*Make sure your computer boots straight into Windows (or the Windows boot manager)\nHowever, since you wanted a normal dual boot, why don't you download and run the bootinfoscript and post the result to http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/ and then post the link back on your other question. That might be easily fixable. It might even already show up at the bottom of the Wubi grub menu.\n\nA: To remove a wubi installation from Windows, open the control panel and select add/remove applications. Ubuntu will appear in the list of apps to uninstall. \nWhen you use Wubi, it is very important that you always shutdown the system properly. Failing to do so might make the root filesystem inaccessible. This means both Windows and Ubuntu must always be properly shutdown. \nPlease refer to this page for more details: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WubiGuide\n", "Q: Minimal Ubuntu remastering I was trying to remaster an Ubuntu Mini Remix using the tool called \"Customizer\". My goal is to create a version with a GUI capable of networking too. I don't like all the Tomboy Notes, Evolution and Unity stuff that Natty come with.\nhttp://www.ubuntu-mini-remix.org/\nhttp://u-customizer.sourceforge.net/\nThe packages I installed are just xorg and gnome-desktop-environment.\napt-get --no-install-recommends xorg gnome-desktop-environment\n\nWell it worked quite well. I just want to ask if there are any minimum packages other that the two mentioned above? The lubuntu-desktop is great too but I want gnome more cos it has a wider community (imo).\nPlease don't refer me to LFS. I'm still too noob for that.\n\nA: For a truly minimal installation, I'd advise avoiding any package that has either 'desktop' or 'environment' in its name. The basic blocks of a minimal installation are: a window manager, a file browser, for example, openbox and pcmanfm, and the programs you need. Another thing to keep in mind is that --no-install-recommends is a tricky option. Don't be surprised if something doesn't work because of missing recommended packages. Networking doesn't require GUI tools, but if you need a network manager, try wicd.\nFor more ideas, check out the links below:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/LowMemorySystems\nhttp://psychocats.net/ubuntu/minimal\n\nA: I recommend you to remaster by beginning with KDE 3.5 and the reason is, KDE 3.5 use less dependecies rather than gnome but it is okay to begin with LXDE because it is very light and fast.... \n", "Q: Why is Ubuntu One slow to sync in 11.10, either backup or any sub-folder contents? I have been trying to sync my documents folder of 1.4GB, it still hasn't worked and it has been syncing for a month. The top level syncs, files and folders in the Document folders, but contents of sub-folders just hang. (Gave up and stopped syncing this folder)\nHowever,I have tried using the backup facility in 11.10, to backup to Ubuntu One.... I upgraded my HDD space in Ubuntu One. It has been going now for 24hours-ish and only backed up what looks like a couple of percent. \n(By the way what an excellent idea to backup to Ubuntu One, if only we could get it to actually work! :-o)\nThe odd thing is I can sync to drop box within hours, rather than months.\nThis is bad, and has been an issue since Ubuntu One's release. I have reported this problem and there were promises in later releases this would be fixed, but it hasn't.\nCanonical cannot help either... I posted on several blogs, a lot of people have the same problem but no fixes.\nSo do I use dropbox or another service, until it is sorted, as Ubuntu does not seem to see this as an issue, I think a fix will be a long time in coming. \n(However,I love the potential of Ubuntu One and the integration with the OS)\nYes my internet speeds are fine, etc... :-) No firewall (sudo ufw status: STATUS: INACTIVE), No Proxy, etc\nNB:\nI have raised this as a separate question to others posted here, because my question relates to Ubuntu 11.10, though I have commented elsewhere for help. Plus my question also relates to deja-dup backup to Ubuntu One.\nThanks\n\nA: I contacted Ubuntu One, and they were very helpful.\nThey suggested I tried the following:\nPress Alt-F2, type \"gnome-terminal\", press \"Enter\" and run:\nu1sdtool -q\nsudo rm -rf ~/.local/share/ubuntuone\nu1sdtool -c\nLet that go for at least 30 minutes.\nFiles have started to transfer, seems to be going ok.... will monitor\n....still slow to sync sub folders and files\n", "Q: How to open a remote file (ssh) with my local Emacs? I use ssh to connect to a remote machine where a file is.\nOnce the connection is established, if I run emacs the_file in the terminal, instead of launching my local Emacs, it opens an editor inside the terminal which is very modest...\nDoes anyone know how to open this file in a normal emacs session?\n\nA: You could use tramp. Simply start your local emacs, open file (ctrl+x+f) and type the full address like this: /the.server.name:/the/path/to/the/file. So assuming the server is at example.com and the file at /home/me/test.txt, the address to type would be /example.com:/home/me/test.txt. This will open the file in the local emacs instance.\n(Note that this does not require an additional manual ssh connection.)\nOf course there is also the second option to use sshfs to mount the remote directory on a local address and open the local version. \n", "Q: How to select which account is logged in at system startup, or none?

I'm thinking about option \"require password to log in\" or something similar when you found the right setting....\nWhen I'm on Kubuntu, I found this :\n\nI really hope that you can find something similar to this, or change your machine to Kubuntu, it is pretty nice and just like windows. Hope that I'm helping you my friend.\n\nA: Can you go System => Administration => Login Screen, Unlock the window, then change the user for automatic login there?\nOr is the option not there?\nThe program that is launched is 'gdmsetup' which should be there if you have GDM installed.

How do I assign custom icons to folders, as well as the default folders Desktop, Downloads, Music, etc.?

In advance of being in a position to properly calibrate my dual monitor set-up under Ubuntu, I really need to move from using Nvidia's Twinview to something else as Twinview is seen as one single large Monitor. From a colour calibration point of view this is not too useful as each monitor needs to be calibrated separately.\nDoes anyone have any good tips, experience or recommendations as to the best way to go about setting up dual monitors that will allow me to calibrate both my monitors independently using Xinerama or another solution?\nThe gfx card I have is an Nvidia FX580 if that helps.\n\nA: You can have separately calibrated monitors, but only using Xinerama. Unfortunately, NVidia and Xinerama somehow seem to mess-up with the RandR X extension and you loose the ability to activate desktop effects. It is unfortunate for me, because I do benefit from some subtle effects, like window shadows and a few animations here and there. Note that this will most probably break Unity, which uses Compiz!\nTo activate Xinerama, you only need to use the NVidia X Server Settings program that comes bundled with the NVidia driver. On openSUSE that I use, it's called nvidia-settings. If you don't have it already installed, I guess it will be a quick search and install from the repositories.\nCome to think of it, to have enabled TwinView, you must have used the NVidia program, so you must have it anyway!\nIn the NVidia program, go to \"X Server Display Configuration\" and check \"Enable Xinerama\", then make sure the monitors are placed appropriately and select each one and for Configuration select \"Separate X screen\". Then click on \"Save to X Configuration File\" and give it a filename.\nNext, you need to make X use this configuration file each time it starts. On openSUSE I have created a symbolic link called xorg.conf in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/ pointing to the configuration file in my home directory. You can just copy the file to that location, but you must name it xorg.conf. If in Ubuntu the location is different, you will want to research a bit.\nNext thing, you logout, which should restart the X Server with the new configuration. Log back in, you should have your dual-monitor setup working, sans desktop effects...\nNext thing in the list is monitor calibration and profiling. I have a Spyder2 device and used Argyll CMS to do this. If you don't know it, Argyll is a great package that can accurately calibrate your monitors and produce very high quality profiles. The bad thing is, it does have a rather steep learning curve. There is a utility GUI that does ease things up a bit, called dispcalGUI, check it out.\nI've done this whole saga and do have a properly calibrated / profiled dual-head setup which does look nice, albeit without desktop effects. I use Gnome 2, so I don't have a real problem using my system, your mileage may vary if you use one of the newer environments.\nIn case you end up with an unusable setup, just reboot into single-user mode (append \"single\" - no quotes - to the kernel command line in the initial boot loader menu) and remove the above symbolic link (or rename the file to something other than xorg.conf), then reboot again. You should be fine.\n\nA: The best alternative to TwinView to calibrate both monitors is using the open source Nouveau driver. ( go to the additional driver, and remove the nvidia driver installed, Nouveau will replace automatically after a restart ). Nouveau is compatible with a newer Xrandr. This compatibility will allow you to calibrate and set color management for both screens. With Nouveau, the graphic frontend as colord ( gnome color manager ) or DispCalGUI works also perfectly. \nWarning : the Nouveau driver is weaker about performances. Another workaround if Nvidia driver ( performances ) is a 'must have' ( I think for 3D Blender artist, or gamers ) is to set a screen for being the 'master' working one ( with nvidia driver and twinview the profile apply to both screens ) and tweak the color manually with the physical button on the second 'slave' screen to match the best. ( the second screen will be not used for precision color work , of course ). I use this solution as I need 3D/openGL performances.\n\nA: I found that several users have the problem with the nVidia graphic card. While Googling and looking into the archive, several ubuntu-masters reported that they are happy using the disper and the disper indicator.... works well in Natty + Unity\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:disper-dev/ppa\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:nmellegard/disper-indicator-ppa\n\nsudo apt-get update\n\nsudo apt-get install disper disper-indicator\n\nYou should be able to get this indicator :\n\nThe usage instruction is simple (I think). Go into the terminal, type disper -e and you should have both of the monitor running well with extended view (which means that you can move the cursor of the mouse on the edge, and it will popped out on the other screen).\nI also found one more guide, obviously from this AkUbuntu Stack Exchange portal too and it is good for you to see it...\nHow to automatically switch monitors with my laptop dock\nIt is a pretty long reading to the whole post. I also use the extended view mode, connect my netbook the the LCD monitor but I have no problem since I'm not using the nVidia. Just plug and play~\n", "Q: Why can't Skype hear me? Since I upgraded to Ubuntu 11.10, Skype can't seem to hear me any more. It's not that it transmits poor quality sound, it's just silence. I've tried the echo123 service many times, and there's nothing.\nI've checked that my microphone settings are correct: Sound Recorder works fine, and Skype running in a VM [Virtualmachine] sort of works (it can hear me, but the sound stutters - probably a VM issue).\nI've checked the Skype audio settings: all options are set to \"Pulse Audio\", as always, and I've tried with both auto-adjusting enabled and disabled, but no joy.\nI've also tried using Alsa-mixer to ensure the microphone is not muted, but all seems well.

consistently I have a pair of Trust USB speakers.  As these are external, I sought to use them with 11.10.  They are recognized by 'aplay -l' and Pulseaudio- I have selected them, but, have to reset the volume, every time I log on.  Also, I can receive only feedback and sound from apps and programs- like Kaffeine or Firefox- on this boosted volume- I cannot get System Sounds, like logon or logoff.  I have tried the gnome-alsamixer install that used to work, to no effect.  Is their an app that I should be trying or is this feat impossible?\n\n*\n\n*I have tried to delete all the files in .pulse  and rebooting or just deletion of the entire .purge directory, as Michael K suggested- neither works as the directory is automatically rewritten on reboot.\n\n[I have found that any other soundcards (of those tried- many) will zero out all the options for a USB system.  DO NOT USE A SECOND SOUNDCARD DURING THIS SETUP]\nIdeas?\n\nI executed the command:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\nsudo apt-get install linux-sound-base alsa-base alsa-utils gdm ubuntu-desktop linux-image-`uname -r` libasound2\nsudo apt-get -y --reinstall install linux-sound-base alsa-base alsa-utils gdm ubuntu-desktop  linux-image-`uname -r` libasound2\nkillall pulseaudio\nrm -r ~/.pulse*\nsudo usermod -aG 'cat /etc/group | grep -e '^pulse:' -e '^audio:' -e '^pulse-access:' -e '^pulse-rt:' -e '^video:' | awk -F: '{print $1}' | tr '\\n' ',' | sed 's:,$::g'` `whoami`\n\n[this command should be taken from their helppage, not mine, for certainty]\nto totally reset and rejig my system (from https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshootingProcedure).  This reloads all the defaults and then scans for audio devices.\nIn a terminal, type alsamixer\nThis should load a GUI, allowing you to scan all channels.\nPress F6 and look at the channel (s) available.  If USB Audio is set to channel 0 (usually in brackets), then this will interfere with any inbuilt soundcards- even if they are disabled.  As such, this USB must be set to another channel, say 1.\nHowever these speakers can be tested, now, by selecting them, but, they will disappear on reboot\nNow execute the command\nfind /lib/modules/`uname -r` | grep snd\n\nthis should give you a massive list of possible sound systems- look for\nsnd-usb-audio *or somesuch, depending on your speakers*\n\nYour inbuilt card is shown, too.\nEven if you have disabled or do not have an inbuilt soundcard, Linux will set up a virtual, 'ghost' card, if necessary.  This is always set to card 0.\nNow type\nsudo gedit /etc/module.d/alsa-base.conf\nand, at the bottom of the file, add the line\n   option snd-usb-audio = 1\n\nThis should set your soundcard to channel 1 and not conflict with the default settings.  Reboot.\nNow type\ncat /proc/asound/cards\n\nYou will get something like\nCybermedia USB device\n 1 [Audio          ]: USB-Audio - USB Audio\n                      C-Media INC.

Monkeying with this option is recommended, as it is disabled by default (set to 'yes', if you have USB speakers).  This allows the use of the Sound Preference sliders to be permanent.  This appears to be a known bug.  Leave the editor.\n\nPAV SETTINGS             I found this advisable.\n=============\nI mistakenly thought that while the speakers are USB, I must include the inbuilt soundcard, as a sound source.  Now I have working USB speakers but the volume sliders in Sound Preferences are reset, every time I log on.\nAfter an overnight reboot, to allow the ALSA to catch up, I attain a new sound card\n> aplay -l\ncard 0: SB [HDA ATI SB], device 0: ALC662 rev1 Analog [ALC662 rev1 Analog]\n  Subdevices: 1/USB card 0 is my inbu1\n  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0\ncard 0: SB [HDA ATI SB], device 1: ALC662 rev1 Digital [ALC662 rev1 Digital]\n  Subdevices: 1/1\n  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0\ncard 1: Audio [USB Audio], device 0: USB Audio [USB Audio]\n  Subdevices: 1/1\n  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0\n\nOpen the Dash (top left of screen and a circular icon) and type\n\npav\n\nSelect the PulseAudio Volume Controller and run it.\nand go to the Configuration tab.\nYOU MUST SET YOUR INBUILT/INTERNAL CARD AS INPUT ONLY- via this tab.  Now reboot immediately.\nUSB card 0 is my inbuilt card.  It is far easier to deal with a real card than a virtual one (Ubuntu needs some sort of soundcard and will create a 'ghost', virtual one if your mo'bo  and PCIs are bereft of one.\nTo set the System Volume, it is vital to use the PAV and not System Preferences. Select this option, from the  Dash and set your volume/amplification; click on the sliders to hear the set level.\nUsing the Volume sliders in System Preferences > Sound or the Sound icon is a base level method and will totally zero any changes to PAV.  Do not use them.\n\nFYI  Adobe Flash 10 does not work with 64-bit v 11.10- it may be necessary to install the v 11, if your Firefox Flash goes away [playing video, but, no sound or such] or does not work, at all.\n\nA: I had a similar issue with my laptop where the default sound device was actually the headphone jack.\nIf you use alsamixer to make everything the way it should be, then use the command alsactl store it will store those preferences. Then I put as a startup command alsactl restore and every time I logged in it was reset to my original settings. Hope this helps!\n\nA: I had this issue with my plantronics usb headset at work, I don't want the sound to ever come out of the monitor or the computers built in speakers. I simply went to sound settings applet and in the hardware tab changed the profile for all the other devices to off. Now I can plug and unplug them as much as i like as they are the only device that will be used. I am using 11.10.\nYou might also want to lock your screen instead of logging off and suspend instead of shutting down to avoid this.\n\nA: An easy way to get your USB speakers to be the default speakers is to disable the on-board audio through the BIOS. \n\nA: Maybe an answer? - to see whether in the audio mixer options something like \"jack sense\" is activated\nWhat desktop environment are you in?\nI cannot provide more details on the options in Unity.\nThere are some supplementary options related to \"jack sense\" at least in the xfce mixer that I used both in Lubuntu and Xubuntu and you may install that in any ubuntu desktop i think.\n(here I do not have my Ubuntu pc available: I'll re-eedit soon enough with images too)\n\nA: Basic and simple: install Veromix. Start it and select the USB sound device you want to use as the default device. That's all!\n", "Q: Interacting with a linux input kernel driver from userspace I'm developing a linux kernel driver for a multitouch device. Right now I have already touch being injected to the linux kernel subsystem and it is working. The problem is that I also need to interact with the device to change settings an so on.\nWhile the kernel is grabbing the device I can't grab it in user space, so I need to find a way to interact with the kernel driver.\nMy first driver test had some extra operations that I can't find on the current model i'm using. It had open, close, read, write operatins that I could perform from user space.\nHow can I do such things with input drivers? Is there any official way?\nThanks in advance,\nWith my best regards,\nNuno Santos\n\nA: You need to implement character device injected into the kernel standard input subsystem. Please check this book. The read(), write(), ioctl(), etc. are typical char drivers operations, any char driver has at least open() and close().\n Anyway, what subsystem of kernel did you use in your last driver version? Most useful way for any kernel development is to read related documents in Documentation/ of kernel sources directory and read the kernels drivers code of area related with your tasks.\n\nA: You can combine your input device driver with a character driver and then you get a device file which you can write your configuration data to and read the configuration from. Interaction between two seperated drivers in kernel space should as well be not complicated.\nI guess you already know this book, it might answer your question in detail:\nLinux Device Drivers, 3rd edition\n", "Q: Why doesn't .mkv files play properly with ubuntu-restricted-extra?

Seems like I can only purchase a new license, if I don't want to dual-boot, which is quite not convenient.\n\nA: Since Matlab for Linux exists, the number of users who have experience with Matlab on wine is probably very limited.\nIf you cannot get a license that is valid on Linux, running Windows 7 (or any Windows) and Matlab with VirtualBox or KVM is certainly an option. The biggest issue is that a significant amount of RAM will be wasted for Windows. \n\nA: I don't think you need a new licence. \nAt least in my case I have a licence that let's me download and install on any OS (Windows, linux or mac).\nAnd it let's me have up to 4 simultaneous installations. So I have one running on a windows machine and one on a mac.\n\nA: You can obtain a linux version of matlab via the \"less official\" sources and then use your windows license, I'm fairly sure this will work.

Symptoms on each (btw. it used to work with 11.04 on both):\n\n\n*\n\n*laptop Dell Inspiron 1525 (HDMI, Intel GMX 3100):\n\n\n*\n\n*after HDMI cable is plugged in, screen is corrupted (no panel, no icons), system is unresponsive, TV set receives some signal, but only blue screen and some regular ticks can be heard. Unplugging the cable system recovers. No logs were checked.\n\n\n*Thinkpad W510 (DisplayPort, NVidia). Simple \"Screens\" utility does not recognizes TV set, but this is something to do with the differences between Nvidia driver API and the one expected from the utility, as far I could spot on the net. However, using Nvidia-settings, TV is recognized, but cannot be enabled and used. Beside that, touch pad freezes after HDMI2DisplayPort connector is plugged in the laptop (not immediately, but after few seconds - probably after some handshake with the TV set crashes).\nIt is strange that no such bug reports can be found on the net. So, I guess it is something wrong on our laptops only, but would appreciate some hints (i.e. any known changes recently related to HDMI, Display Port, X-Windows, kernel... wherever I should take a look and fix the issue).\n\nA: The cause of the problem for Thinkpad W510 is the fact that laptop is usually used in combination with additional monitor, twinview configuration. Such a configuration is set-up and written in xorg.conf via nvidia-setings tool.

Most eBooks sold today are encumbered with DRM. Therefore, I need a workflow to buy and read DRM eBooks either using only the device or using Ubuntu. \nThe three popular types of DRM in use today are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Adobe Digital Editions(ADE) used with the ePub format on multiple devices with books from several stores. This software requires Windows, Mac or Android. Sony Reader and B&N Nook Apps appear to be variants of ADE.\n\n*Apple iTunes. This software requires Windows or Mac (or an iDevice).\n\n*Amazon Kindle. This requires, a Kindle, Kindle software (such as on Androids) or Kindle Cloud (through web browser).\n\n\nThis leaves me with two option\n\n\n*\n\n*an Android device with a DRM app (Kindle or ADE)\n\n*a Kindle\n\n\nBoth can directly communicate with a store and handle the DRM themselves, a computer is not required. To my knowledge there is no Android device with an eInk display.\nOther devices are not an option because although the support ePubs with ADE DRM, it appears that a computer with the ADE software or some variant thereof is required (according Google eBooks, B&N, Sony) While many readers have Wifi or 3G, no manufacturer states that you can buy DRM books without going through a computer with the ADE software.\nThis brings me to the conclusion that Amazon's kindle is the only eInk device that will work for me. Can you name an alternative?\n\nA: \n\nI want to purchase an eBook reader device and eBooks.\n\n\nPurchasing an eBook (or eReader) is just like buying a computer.  You first have to identify the software ('books') that you are going to want, and which 'platform(s)' supports them.\nFor eBook purchases: Amazon is the market leader (in terms of selection, market value, or market share).  Barns and Noble (Nook), Sony, etc., are other alternatives ..\nFor free eBooks: The Internet has myriad sources for (quite literally) millions of titles.  Most are in .epub and .pdf format, but plenty are available in the format of your choice.\n\n\nI don't use Windows, Mac OS or Wine.\n\n\nYou don't need any of these.  The suppliers want you on their website.  For example, Amazon.com actively encourages you to send your purchases directly to your device.  This can be done a any time, by 'syncing' your device.  Anyone can do this, without any technical expertise ..\nMost suppliers support (or allow) downloading the file to your PC.  The device can simply be connected via USB, allowing easy management of all content.\n\n\nMost eBooks sold today are encumbered with DRM.\n\n\nYES, that is true.  And these eBooks are NOT intended to be used on multiple platforms (eg. Nook and Kindle).  Sadly, this is about protecting their market share and NOT the authorship ..\n\n\nTherefore, I need a workflow to buy and read DRM eBooks either using only the device or using Ubuntu.\n\n\nYou ONLY need Calibre and a browser.\nsudo apt-get install calibre\n\nCalibre will manage your (ever-growing) collections of books, convert between nearly ALL possible formats, has a built-in eBook reader, and will connect and manage most devices.\nIt will NOT convert the format of DRM eBooks - but unless you have multiple brands of eReader under one roof, and want to freely share, this should not be an issue ..\nI have some 15,000 titles (mostly free), and use Calibre on Ubuntu 11.10 to manage my Kindle 3.  I previously used various earlier versions, and on Ubuntu 10.04 LTS.\nNote: You have NOT stated what version of Ubuntu you are using, and an older OS (or newer device) may require some additional care & feeding.\nfor example: (I used this, about a year ago)\nUsing Calibre with a Kindle 3 on Ubuntu 10.04\nhttp://www.peppertop.com/blog/?p=1054\nUPDATE 20-Aug-2012\nStill using Calibre (now v0.8.64), now under Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.\nNo longer using Kindle 3, gave it to a friend.  Now I have two Kindle 4 (non-touch), one for home use the other for work/traveling.\nBasically, no issues to report ..\n\nA: I am the owner of a Kindle and, until a couple of weeks ago, of a Sony Reader. As you explain, and not everyone understood, you can manage both devices with Calibre, but you CAN NOT manage DRM epubs on the Sony unless you use their software (=> Windows). You have to register in Adobe or something like that (actually, I never cared to do it) and it's not possible in Linux.\nSo your choice is reduced to the Kindle, honestly. First of all, a Kindle is actually a modified Android (it gets recognized as such if you visit certain websites). In addition, I can't think of any Android device with e-ink display. \nMy advice would be to go for the Kindle. It's a great device for reading, buying from their shop is ridiculously easy and you won't have any problems finding free books for it elsewhere (if you can't find them in .mobi, which is rare, you can convert them with calibre). \nI actually bought the Sony in the first place because I was concerned about the EPUB issue, but found out that is almost never an issue. \n\nA: A lot of time has passed since this question was asked, but I think that it's worth adding that as of today, both Barnes and Noble's Nooks and Kobo's ereaders allow you to purchase content without going through your computer, not just the Amazon Kindles. I've used both Kobos and Nooks, and can manage with Ubuntu without any major complaints.\nIn addition, DRM-unencumbered books can be copied to these devices via USB from Ubuntu as if you were transferring files to any mass storage device.\nIt appears possible, but complicated, to install the Kobo Desktop via WINE, but the OP didn't appear interested in this.\n\nA: Maybe it's just me, but I find it difficult to tell what you're asking here.\nKindle-formatted books cannot be read on any other device without breaking the DRM. (Edit: This does not apply to devices that have Kindle apps available to them, such as Android phones/tablets, iPads, and even desktop browsers through Amazon's Cloud Reader. I am referring only to dedicated e-ink eReaders.) And Kindles can't read many other formats (only Amazon's proprietary format and PDF).  However, you can get data onto and off of Kindles in Ubuntu.\nIf you're looking for as much flexibility/portability as possible, you should buy your books in ePub format whenever possible. This format is supported by the widest number of devices (except for maybe PDF or plain text), and is an open standard, although it is frequently protected by DRM.\nBooksellers who offer books in the ePub format include Kobo Books and Google eBooks. These can be purchased, downloaded to your PC, and transferred to any device that reads ePub-formatted books.\neReaders that can read the ePub format include the Kobo, the Sony Reader, and the Barnes & Noble Nook, but there are many more. Shop around to see which one suits you best.\nIn order to get eBooks onto your eReader, you won't necessarily even need to use your PC. Some, like the Kindle and Nook, can be used to purchase eBooks right from the device. Others will require you to upload the eBook to the eReader from your PC. There is a terrific native Linux application for eBook management called Calibre, available in the Ubuntu Software Center, which supports many different eReaders.\nIn short, regarding your final question (\"Is it correct that the Kindle reader the only eInk device that would give Ubuntu users access to commercial ebooks?\"), the answer is no.\n\nA: Not totally sure what you are after but for what it's worth you can download a \"Kindle Cloud Reader\" App for Chrome and Firefox. I have done this (I do not own a Kindle) and have registered with Amazon and bought and downloaded books to read in this way.\n\nA: The basic problem for DRM ebooks is that you cannot link a sony ereader to ADE using Ubuntu platform!Until Adobe come up with a linux[?]/Ubuntu based ADE: it is a no go area the only option is to use microsoft for ADE.\nWifi is a solution but you need to be able to access such services and where I live it is non existent ! best Peter\n", "Q: Why isn't Firefox 8.0 available as an update in the Update Manager? So recently I've read that Firefox 8.0 is out, thought of updating, opened the Update Manager, refreshed the sources, but there was no uodate.

Since this was discovered before I could complete my acceptance testing for 8.0, I decided to wait for 8.0.1. Mozilla should be releasing 8.0.1 fairly soon and we will release shortly after them.\n\nNormally Firefox is kept up to date via the update manager (a delay like this is unusual):\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I install the latest stable version of Firefox?\n\nA: actually, you can get the update through the separate repository... add this line into your terminal.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:mozillateam/firefox-next\n\nThen, run the update for the list\nsudo apt-get update\n\nThen, install // upgrade the firefox installation using this command..\nsudo apt-get install firefox\n\nTadaaa, Firefox 8.0 is ready on your machine~\n\nUsually, the Ubuntu main repo didn't update as fast as lightning for the firefox version, you need the external repository from the launchpad.

On my Thinkpad I need to execute something like this in the terminal:\nxinput set-int-prop \"TPPS/2 IBM TrackPoint\" \"Evdev Middle Button Emulation\" 8 1\n\nso that my the 2 buttons on my touchpad emulate the middle mouse click. Now I need this line to be executed each time I start GNOMe or X or whatever, so that it \"just works\".\nI tried ~/.xsession or ~/.bashrc but to no avail. Should I put it in GNOME start scripts or in /etc/X somewhere?\nI'm using Ubuntu 11.10.\n\nA: I'm using Enlightenment DM, but that's relevant to other DMs/desktops. I start my session using xsession so I initially put xinput commands in ~/.xsession which didn't change all settings I wanted to change. Only some of them. I was expecting either all or no changes, so I added a 10-interation loop to my .xsession with 1 second intervals, running xinput commands each time and checking if the settings were applied. To my surprise, all settings were applied after the first iteration.\nThis means that it's your DM that does something to override your xinput settings and since the command that launches your DM (E17 in my case) is the last one in your .xsession file, this file is no place for this.\nI've added the following lines in my ~/.profile and this has solved the problem:\n# don't run unless we're being invoked from an xwindows session\nif [[ -n ${DISPLAY} ]]; then\n\n  # set your devices names here\n  pointer1=\"IBM TrackPoint\"\n  pointer2=\"Lite-On Technology Corp.

If I launch LibreOffice Files (ODS, ODT, ODP) with a double click in their home folders they launch with the appropriate application (Calc, Writer, Impress) however the application windows do not display the usual Close, Minimize, Restore buttons in the left hand corner. There is just a blank space where they should be. In the Unity launcher on the left there is not the expected white arrow next to the launcher icon and the open app is not seen by the ALT+TAB keystroke when you have multiple windows open. For example: if you have an app open in this way and say Firefox, if you minimize Firefox you are only left with the desktop and you have no way to locate the open LibreOffice app. Clicking the app's icon in the launcher simply opens another instance. A messy workaround is to click [Firefox] to a restored window and the LibreOffice app can be seen behind it allowing a mouse click to bring it forward. \nIf I open the LibreOffice app from the launcher and then Open a file from its menu, it all behaves as expected. I don't find this as convenient; anyone know how to fix the bad behaviour?\n\nA: This was not happening on my system until I tried to maximize the document window by using the mouse to slam the window against the top panel. Not knowing my own strength I ended up with the top of the window stuck under the top panel. I had to close the window using the file menu. Since then I got the same behaviour as you whenever I opened the document by a double click on the document file.\nI found that the answer was to open and close the document a few times using the Launcher to load the program and then use the program's File Menu>Recent Documents to open the document. The first time I tried this the maximized document showed the same behavior as you described. It was only after repeating this a few times that the document's window behaviour went back to normal.\nIt is also useful to know that a double click on a window's top panel will maximize the window and that a double click on the desktop's top panel will minimize a window. In case it happens again.\nI have tried to repeat this experiment but I have been unable to.\nRegards.\n", "Q: Can't install libglib2.0-dev Since Handbrake can't be installed in Oneiric, I decided to try and build it from source instead.

It's like a cross between a terminal/shell and a GUI file manager, with pop-up command suggestion and other handy features. It handles ctrl-C and ctrl-V as copy and paste.\nI don't think such projects they tend to be very widely used because anytime they change something, tools adapted to traditional terminals get less convenient to use. For example, without traditional ctrl-C, the main way of stopping a runaway program disappears, so the author would have to add in some other way to accomplish that. It's a big project to re-work an entire operating environment without losing any functionality, and hard to convince a potential audience that your way of doing it is the one to switch to and learn.\n\nA: actually, the Gnome-terminal do the coloring part.

So in this scenario:\nI create tar.gz file. with very important files.\nBefore I power down computer, electricity goes out.\nis it safe to files written in tar file will not get corrupted?\nis it ok to check just tar file for integrity and not individual files?\nHow can I check tar.gz file integrity?\n\nA: Yes, this is definitely possible.\nBecause hard disks are exceptionally slow compared to the rest of your computer, there is virtually always a delay between when a piece of software is told a write to a file is finished and that file actually gets physically written to the hard disk. This keeps slow disks from making it difficult to keep using the computer. But until this write finishes, the data may only exist in your computer's RAM.\nThere are mechanisms applications can use to ensure data has been written out to disk, but there is a significant performance cost to using them, so a low-level application like tar will not use them and rely on a higher-level tool to ensure data integrity.\nSince tar is not doing this for you, you can ensure that any pending writes have been flushed out to disk using the sync command. Once that command returns, you can be sure that any disk writes that happened before running sync have been successfully written to the hard disk.\nAdditionally, if you cleanly shut down your system, one of the last things that happens is that any pending writes are synced out. So in the case of power loss, data may not have been written out to the disk, but in the case of a clean shut down, everything should be.\n\nA: To check integrity of tar.gz files: Check tar.gz.\nI guess that if the tar.gz file is ok, files inside it are ok aswell.\n", "Q: Is there a window-picker-applet replacement for 11.10? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I use the GNOME Panel in Unity? \n\nI was very used to the window-picker-applet in previous Ubuntu releases and I don't think I will get used to the new unity dock.  \nIs there a window-picker-applet replacement in 11.10 that shows the open windows icons on the panel?\nEDIT: I was looking for som way to only have the top panel and nothing else but I have given up and now I am trying to get used with the unity launcher.

The game in question was recently re-released for higher resolution and ability to run under Windows. Does it mean it's no longer compatible with DOS?\nNB If it helps, the game is Raptor - Call of the Shadows 2010 Edition.\n\nA: The format of EXE files for Windows is different then for DOS - Windows applications contain a small DOS stub which says \"This program can not be run in DOS\" and exits; Windows loader uses a different entry point.\nIf that message is what you see when trying to run the executable in DOSBox, then it means the executable has the new format (not surprisingly in 2010), so DOS (and DOSBox) can't load it.

In the past 3 days our wifi drops out in that we can \"see\" the SSID from the Router but neither of the laptops nor the iTouch can access the internet. On all 3 days the drop out has occurred when my neighbour's father parks his Toyota Prius (hybrid with many batteries) across the road. We can access the internet when connected via ethernet cable.\nTo check the theory our wifi dropped out when he arrived and worked again THE MINUTE he left! \nI've spoken to the neighbours and they (in their own words) are a non-tech family in that they have an iPad and BT Router only and no other technical gadget they use.\nYesterday I checked to see if the problem was caused by the Prius being charged but it was not. \nAs I say because we are in a small community it is relatively easy to ascertain if anything untoward is going on and the only \"change\" that coincides with the wifi drop out is this car arriving.\nHas anyone heard of this issue? I have \"googled\" this but to no avail.\nAny ideas and help will be gratefully received. \n\nA: interesting issue!  \nI would take a closer look at your wireless signal strength.  If it is particular week, any \"metallic\" object could have interference.\nMore likely is clashing wireless channels - for the UK, most routers default to wireless channel 1.

I just installed a 2 port serial adapter in my Ubuntu 10.10 system, then I tried following this tutorial that I used on my old system to connect to a cisco router (my old system had an onboard serial adapter, and the tutorial worked just fine). I can't get my system to connect to the cisco router, so I'm wondering if the card even works in Ubuntu.\nHow can I tell if the card actually works with Ubuntu?\n#dmesg | grep tty\n[    0.000000] console [tty0] enabled\n[    0.358667] serial8250: ttyS0 at I/O 0x3f8 (irq = 4) is a 16550A\n[    0.358994] 00:0c: ttyS0 at I/O 0x3f8 (irq = 4) is a 16550A\n[    0.359128] ttyS1: detected caps 00000700 should be 00000100\n[    0.359132] 0000:03:00.0: ttyS1 at MMIO 0xfeafd000 (irq = 16) is a 16C950/954\n[    0.359191] ttyS2: detected caps 00000700 should be 00000100\n[    0.359195] 0000:03:00.0: ttyS2 at MMIO 0xfeafd200 (irq = 16) is a 16C950/954\n\n\nA: The way you've got Ubuntu setup is correct, the serial port at /dev/ttyUSB0 is the right serial port. You can test the port by piping some data into it and if it doesn't return an error, then it's working as a serial port:\nls > /dev/ttyUSB0\n\nNow to get it working you may have to find out what the right settings are. Or you may have to switch on serial port communication on your cisco router (it's not always switched on).\nIf you want you can use ttywatch to do some serial port debugging. But it might be beyond your scope.\n\nA: The easiest way to test a serial port is to loop back Tx to Rx. This is easy if you have a loopback plug.  If not connect pin 2 to pin 3 (db9 or db25). \nThen open the port with a terminal program like picocomm.   If the port is working you should see the characters you type.  If not, the port is not working.  You may have to configure picocomm to ignore RTS/CTS signalling.  \nI find an RS-232 inline signal tester (a small block with LEDs for each signal) helpful. It will help find if you have your signal lines crossed.  At slow speeds you can see the data passing on the Tx and Rx lines.   If the lines are crossed you may need a null modem cable.  \nI believe that it important to use the cable that came with the router.  If I am not mistaken it connects pins in the opposite order to what you get with a CAT-5 cable.\n\nA: With the same setup, I found that I had to tweak the setserial baud_base to get correct baud rates.\nE.g.:\nsetserial /dev/ttyS1 baud_base 115200\nsetserial /dev/ttyS2 baud_base 115200\n\nYou can paste that in /etc/rc.local for example.\nWith another serial card, the baud base was 921600.\nCheck the serial status of your serial lines with setserial -gav /dev/ttyS*\n\nA: Is the card connected via PCI? If so, just run lspci in terminal and see if it shows up. \n", "Q: How can I switch users from within XFCE? I am using xubuntu 11.10.

There is no need to create a launcher plugin, or install additional gnomeware. \n(1) Install light-locker (in my case from the Debian 8/Jessie stable repository). \n(2) Replace /usr/local/bin/gdmflexiserver with:\n#!/bin/bash\nlight-locker-command -l\n# [End]\n\n(3) reboot (full shutdown and restart, needed once only, to get the panel to activate the 'switch user' option - you may have smarter ways to get this done).\nEach time I hit the 'switch user' menu option, there is a slight pause on a black screen before the login appears, which is not there when I use dm-tool, but it's good to know my session is fully locked.\nThanks to pomidorabelisima at https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xfswitch-plugin/+bug/1320560 (duplicate bug report) for the heads-up.\n\nA: \nIn a terminal:\nsudo apt-get install xfswitch-plugin\n\nDuring installation it will ask you to switch window manager - do not choose GDM, but stick with lightdm.

Is it possible to change the language of a particular application so that when opened it shows in Spanish for example while the rest are in English?\nI have Spanish and English installed in Ubuntu and am using English as the default one but I would like a way to change the language for a particular application without having to change the whole language of the system.\n\nA: You can change the LANG environment variable in a terminal. After that, all the applications that you launch with the new environment will follow that new locale. For example:\ngedit # Will use default locale (English in your case)\nexport LANG=es_ES\ngedit # Will use Spanish (provided it's installed)\n\nIf you don't get the Spanish translations for the application, then:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use locale -a | grep es command to verify that Spanish is already available.\n\n*Try to set LANG to the full string returned by locale -a, that is, es_ES.utf8 instead of just es.\n\n*Use the locale command to verify the values of your locale environment variables. Depending on your configuration it might happen that LANG is being shadowed by LC_ALL or LANGUAGE environment variables. To fix that, you could set LC_ALL or LANGUAGE directly.\n\n\nMore information about locale environment variables can be found in the Ubuntu documentation and in the gettext manual.\n\nA: In one line:\nLANGUAGE=es_ES gedit\n\n(please notice I am using Linux Manjaro, in this case the variable is called LANGUAGE)\n\nA: I have normally Swedish as the session language, but want the terminal in English. I achieve it with this file:\n$ cat ~/bin/gnome-terminal\n#!/bin/sh\nexport LANGUAGE=en_US\nexec /usr/bin/gnome-terminal $@\n\nThe file is chmod'ed with +x. With this method gnome-terminal is displayed in English irrespective of how start it - via graphical icon or via command line.\n\nA: In my case, neither LC_ALL or LANG environmental commands worked (in Lubuntu) by setting the specific language encoding such as \nLC_ALL=el_GR.UTF-8 vlc\nexport LANG=el_GR.UTF-8 \n\nbut I was able to set the language for the applications that I would like to run by using export and the generic name of the language. I had not installed it using locale-gen greek or anything similar with intention - I installed only el_gr* and similar versions.\nNontheless, the following worked for me - I run that command and then the desired application. Its language interface changed from the default one to the specified one: \nexport LANG=greek\n\nand then you may return to default language of Linux system by writing:\n export LANG=c\n\n\nA: If we're talking about a terminal application, you could set up an alias. I use GB English as my default language but our git repo server only runs on US English. So i added this alias:\nalias git=\"env LC_ALL=\\\"en_US.UTF-8\\\" git\"\n\nYou could add it to your .bashrc or your .aliases list if you use that.\n\nA: In my case,\nsudo apt-get install language-pack-en-base\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure locales\n\nLANGUAGE=en_US:en\ngedit\n\n", "Q: How is Ubuntu tracking progress towards 200 million users? Given that ubuntu has a very public goal of reaching 200 million users, how will we know when this goal has been reached?\nIs a public and transparent method for counting Ubuntu users being used?\nIs there a user count published and updated regularly? If so, where is it?\nWe know that goals should be measurable and achievable. Leaving aside the question of whether 200 million is achievable, is this goal measurable?\n\nA: No, there is no way to count users of Ubuntu. There are sources from which you can extrapolate more or less realistic estimates, though. For instance, the number of users of Ubuntu One will be known to Canonical, and I'm sure their services are able to identify clients, like any other. They're also opening a lot of shops in China that will sell computers with Ubuntu preinstalled. That's another reliable number. Then you have the software center, where you need to have an account in order to either purchase software or rate existing software. All of these are reliable numbers for a minimum number of users. \nThe real number can never be known, since Ubuntu is free software and doesn't come from one source. For instance, when I download a new CD image or updates, I do that from the University of Oslo. I don't think it's very important to know the exact number of users, though there is a prize for user # 200.000.000: he or she gets a lot of free software! :)\nHardly anyone knows the real number of users of their services, though. Skype, for instance, is said to have 5-600 million users or something, and about 100 million active users. I haven't used Skype in about ten years, but I'm sure I'm being counted as a user anyway. In other words, such numbers are never entirely reliable. They do portray the situation in their own way, however, and as long as you understand the nature of these numbers, they do tell a story. \n\nA: it should be possible to count the number of downloads for the latest LTS version and that would be a good estimate of active users. However, the Ubuntu brass need to order all mirrors to report such stats back to them as it is a fairly decentralized operation. but it is surely possible.\n", "Q: How do you get the very first boot messages smaller?

AbiWord, LyX Document Processor, and Zoho Webservice Word Processor (Ordered from best and pretties, to leasts in my opinion) But I personly use one called \"FocusWriter\". I really like it cause its very very simple, you can set a background image to be behind your typing, and when started it automatically starts in fullscreen.  Its not available in the Software Center, but can easily be installed by following the tutorial a the bottom of this article about FocusWriter.  FocusWriter on OMG Ubuntu!!\nThere only 2 stand alone spreadsheet apps I find in the Software Center are Gnumeric and Zoho Webservice Spreadsheet. I haven't touched a spreadsheet since I was in middle school, which was a good LONG time before I came to using Linux.

You can eckrypt a directory using gpg and peoples public gpg-keys and then publish the directory thru UbuntuOne to each of the participants. \nA convenient tool for Nautilus to do this comes with seahorse-plugins (just right-click in the file dialog). \nRight know there is a problem with the package seahorse-plugins (11.10), but there is a PPA ppa:mdeslaur/testing with a funktioning package.\nA directory encrypted using gpg can function as a key escrow, its possible to store this directory in public, store it in a third part deposit, distribute it on a public network, and only those that the directory where encrypted for can read. \n\nA: Create a new user on a server accessible with ssh (openssh-server installed) and encrypted home directory. You can then add all peoples ssh-keys letting each user use the command ssh-copy from their client using a \"public\" known password. When this is done change the password. All users that copied their public ssh-keys can still login with their password for the ssh-key not knowing your secret password for the account. If you want to retire one of the users just remove the public-key from ~/.ssh/authorized_keys.\nYou can also manually add users public keys to ~/.ssh/autorized_keys\n\nA: For the key escrow aspect of your question, see KeyEscrow.net, which is designed specifically for eCryptfs key escrow.\n", "Q: Can I make Epiphany identify itself as another browser?

It compiled the driver for my kernel, removed the old default module, but then it fails to install the new 8168 module.  It claims that it can't be found.\nCan this driver be installed manually?  Is there a way to fix autorun.sh so it can install properly?\n\nA: Assuming your r8168 was compiled correctly, do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create dependency list of kernel modules:\nsudo depmod -a\n\n\n*Add this line to /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf:\n blacklist r8169\n\n\n*Edit /etc/initramfs-tools/modules and add line:\nr8168\n\n\n*Update existing initramfs:\nsudo update-initramfs -v -u -k `uname -r`\n\nNote that in command 4, those are not quotation marks, but grave accents. That is the key to the left of the one key on the alpha part of the keyboard.\nReboot. You should come up running r8168. To verify, run\nsudo lspci -v\n\n\nA: There are nice guides helping you:\nhttp://www.jamesonwilliams.com/hardy-r8168\nhttp://www.twm-kd.com/linux/realtek-rtl81688111e-and-ubuntu-linux/\nBut stay away from kernels newer than 3.0 ;-)\n\nA: For your special problem: have you checked, if the src directory of your compilation contains a r8168.ko file? If not, the compilation failed, and I suggest you to do some adjustments as suggested here:\nhttp://code.google.com/p/r8168/issues/detail?id=6\nIf the r8168.ko file has been built correctly, you just have to copy it to the /lib/modules/uname -r/kernel/drivers/net/ directory, where uname -r stands for the kernel which you compiled the module for. After that, a simple \"depmod -a\" and \"modprobe r8168\" should start the module immediately. To get it started at start-up, you have to add it to the /etc/modules file. Blacklisting r8169 in the /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist file might be necessary, but I am not sure about that.\n\nA: download official driver from the following URL:\nhttps://www.realtek.com/en/component/zoo/category/network-interface-controllers-10-100-1000m-gigabit-ethernet-pci-express-software\nextract it and run autorun.sh file by sudo\nfinally reboot your system\nIt worked awesome for me on Fedora 35 (Linux fedora 5.16.9-200.fc35.x86_64)\n", "Q: What is the Policy for Updating grub-pc in LTS?

At what extent? \nWhat about a system freeze? \n\nA: Whether or not your home folder is encrypted shouldn't affect your data loss one way or another. However, having an encrypted home directory makes it a lot harder to recover data from a Live CD. If you lose the password that you got after installing Ubuntu that allows you to unencrypt the directory, then your chances of getting data out of the folder are slim to none. So, therefore, it is good to always backup frequently.

I have never used more than two operating system in a laptop/desktop. I want to install windows8 and my questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*How many OS can be installed in a laptop/desktop?\n\n*Can I use three operating system(Ubuntu 11.10, windows7 and windows8) simultaneously?\n\n*What about performance after installing multiple OS?\n\n\nA: If you want to use the OSes in parallel, you might consider installing only one OS directly (e.g., Ubuntu/Linux) and then run the other OSes inside a virtual machine such as VirtualBox or VMware Workstation.\nVirtual Machines allow you to run multiple OSes in parallel without the need of partitioning the disk accordingly. They even allow you to share folders between virtual machines (e.g., have a Linux directory available in your virtual Windows installation). They suffer from lower performance, though. So if you want to use Windows for gaming, it might be worthwile having a native Windows installation and running Linux inside a virtual machine instead.\n\nA: *\n\n*The limiting factor is probably the available disk space or the number of partitions you can create.\n\n*You can have three and more OSs installed, though I am not sure that W8 is a good candidate at the moment. It might not play nicely with other bootloaders, like Grub or EasyBCD.\n\n*Performance is unrelated to the number of OSs installed.\n\nA: Use VirtualBox , it's free and you can run many popular OSes including *BSD, UNIX, IBM OS, Mac OS X, and Windows.\n\nA: Performance is unrelated to the number of OSs installed. But leave some disk space so that whichever OS you are using at a particular moment will not became slow due to low space.\n", "Q: Chromium disappears from the launcher when minimised I am using Ubuntu 11.10. When I minimise the Chromium browser window, the icon does not appear in the launcher. Instead it simply disappears. It had a video running, so I could still hear the audio from it.

I have the same problem with eclipse and it works. alt-tab does not work so they are not equivalent....\nIf someone has a better real solution it would be much appreciated.\n", "Q: Installing NetCDF I would like to write a fortran program which uses NetCDF. \nIn order to do so, I have to have the netcdf-module somewhere on my harddisc, and tell my compiler where to find it.\nIn Synaptic, the following packages are installed:\nnetcdf-bin\nnco\nnetcdf-doc\nlibnetcdf-dev\nlibnetcdf6\n\nlibnetcdf-dev, especially, promises \"everything needed for developing in C, C++,\nFortran 77, and Fortran 90\"; however, I cannot find the libraries anywhere on my system, and accordingly, I cannot develop anything.\nWhere might the libraries be? They are neither in /usr/share, nor in /usr/lib.\nAnd how, in general, can I found out where a package installs its files on my machine?\n\nA: If you open Synaptic and focus on any installed package then click \"Properties\" button, you can see dialog with \"Installed Files\" tab.  \nSo netcdf libraries are in /usr/lib/ and include files in /usr/include if you installed libnetcdf-dev through packaging system\n\nA: In addition to using system tools, nc-config and nf-config can help you find those details. This may be helpful if netcdf was compiled by you or someone else in your organization.\nI believe nf-config only started shipping sometime after netcdf 4.2 was released, because the fortran lib was split into a different package then. So, if you fail to find the relevant fortran information with nc-config, check if nf-config exists somewhere and use it instead.\nFrom netcdf 4.2 release notes:\n\nBeginning with version 4.2, the three [c, c++, fortran] libraries are being released as separate packages.\n\nFinally, here's a sample output of nc-config --all:\nThis netCDF 4.2.1.1 has been built with the following features: \n\n  --cc        -> gcc\n  --cflags    ->  -I/usr/local/include -I/share/ed/local/spike/include\n  --libs      -> -L/usr/local/lib -lnetcdf\n\n  --has-c++   -> no\n  --cxx       -> \n  --has-c++4  -> yes\n  --cxx4      -> g++\n\n  --fc        -> gfortran\n  --fflags    -> -g -O2 -I/usr/local/include\n  --flibs     -> -L/usr/local/lib -lnetcdff -lnetcdf -lnetcdf\n  --has-f90   -> yes\n\n  --has-dap   -> yes\n  --has-nc2   -> yes\n  --has-nc4   -> yes\n  --has-hdf5  -> yes\n  --has-hdf4  -> no\n  --has-pnetcdf-> no\n  --has-szlib -> \n\n  --prefix    -> /usr/local\n  --includedir-> /usr/local/include\n  --version   -> netCDF 4.2.1.1\n\nThe left column has the options that can be sent to nc-config instead of --all to produce more specific output. \n", "Q: How do I sync music with Banshee and my iOS 5 device?

Thus, in addition to using NFS, our file server (Ubuntu server) also runs Samba.\nAnd since we use Ubuntu mostly, we like to take advantage of its advantages over Windows, such as being able to use the characters \\:*?\"<>| in a file name. The problem, of course, is that Windows doesn't accept those characters in file names, and so Samba has to translate the file name into something more acceptable. The way it does this, however, I find to be obnoxious.\nThe file name Episode 182 - Exorcist 2: The Heretic.mp4 for instance turns into E4Q82R~Y.MP4. This is a terrible \"correction\". Is there a way to make Samba's mangling a little more friendly to humans? Is possible to \"correct\" it to something like Episode 182 - Exorcist 2_ The Heretic.mp4 instead, where the illegal characters are simply substituted?\n\nA: In this link you can see the mangling options. I think first you should disable the option:\nmangled names\n\nAfter that I guess the names should look better...\nTo replace the colon e.g. use this line:\nmangled map =(: _)\n\nYou can add more replace rules like this:\nmangled map =(: _) (foo bar)\n\n(also replaces any occurence of foo by bar)\n\nA: mangled map is now deprecated and will no longer work in new versions of Samba.\nYou can use vfs_catia to solve the problem. Add the following lines to smb.conf:\nvfs objects = catia\ncatia:mappings = 0x003a:0x2236,0x003f:0x0294,0x002a:0x2217,0x003c:0x276e,0x003e:0x276f,0x0022:0x02ba,0x007c:0x2223,0x005c:0x29f9\n\nMapping is specified with 0x prefixed hexedecimal character codes separated by a colon. The provided mapping will remap illegal characters to unicode lookalikes that are unlikely to be used in any language. \n: ? * < > \" | \\\nâ¶ Ê â â® â¯ Êº â£ â§¹\nThe code can be put under [global] or in an individual [share] section. Placing it in [global] may impact performance.\nNote that any character you map to cannot be used in filenames on the server or they will be inaccessible.\nExample: A windows client accessing a file named fileâ®name.txt on the server will request file<name.txt from the server due to the mapping, which will result in a file not found error.\n\nA: Newer POSIX clients (at least Linux and macOS) donât need manually character mapping, and can instead mutually cooperate with the server so filenames with NTFS reserved characters work just fine. Per Samba docs, and the man pages:\nOn the server (see man vfs_fruit):\nvfs objects = catia fruit\nfruit:encoding = native\n\nOn the client, it may be necessary to mount with the mapposix* option (see man mount.cifs).\n\n*It seems like mapchars should be the correct option, but with testing, mapposix is what works.\n", "Q: How to access dev server in Ubuntu VirtualBox guest on Windows 7 host? I'm running a Google App Engine dev server on Ubuntu 11.10 Desktop in a VirtualBox VM, on a Windows 7 host. According to this question I have the following setup:\n\n\n*\n\n*The VM networking is set to use Host-only network adapter.\n\n*Internet connection sharing (ICS) is enabled in Windows.\n\n*For ICS, the Windows VirtualBox network port and the Ubuntu wired connection have fixed IPs.\n\n*The Ubuntu VM can access the Internet.\n\n*I can ping the guest from the host.\n\n*On the host, if I put the guest IP address in Chrome's address bar, it says it can not connect.\n\n\nWhat do I need to do from here to access the GAE dev server that is running on Localhost:8080?\n\nA: I would suggest that you put the networking to bridged, that will put your Ubuntu machine in LAN with your host Win7 machine. If you have enabled DHCP on your router (which is by default) that would give your Ubuntu machine an IP.\nThen you could either use VRDP to access your machine or you could install openssh-server:\nsudo apt-get install openssh-server\n\nThen you could access your machine through putty, or from other place if you set your router to forward port 22 to your Ubuntu machine.\nYou could also install the NXServer on Ubuntu machine and NXclient for graphical access. You can download the client/server from NoMachine website.\n\nA: Would setting the network settings on the VM to NAT also be an option, then you would get an IP from your DHCP server on the network you are working on?\n", "Q: Asking about deleted partition at boot I have Ubuntu installed through Wubi. I also had another partition on my computer to try out the dev preview of Windows 8 aptly named Windows_8. After I was done playing, I deleted the Windows 8 partition and added the extra space back to my Win7/Wubi partition. Now every time I boot into Ubuntu, it tells me that it can't mount the partition and asks me if I want to recover or skip it. Is there a way to get Ubuntu to forget about this partition so I can skip this extra step in my boot?\n\nA: You should find the corresponding line in your\n/etc/fstab\n\nfile and comment it out. However, be very careful when editing this file as you can easily break the boot process of your system with a corrupted fstab.\n", "Q: open link from chrome to firefox? I've got two browsers open, chrome and firefox, and would like to have a shortcut to be able to open a link I have in chrome as a new tab in my firefox window.

Is this doable?\n\nA: Have you considered just dragging the link? I use both browsers at the same time (each on it's own screen). I find myself mostly using Chrome for gmail etc.. and will get links via email. I just click and drag from Chrome to the Firefox tab bar and the page will open in a new tab. It works in the other direction too (Firefox to Chrome). One needn't limit this to email... basically any link on any page will work via this method.\n\nA: (time warp :)\nI just tried \"External Application Launcher\" https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/external-application-laun/bifmfjgpgndemajpeeoiopbeilbaifdo\nand it worked fine.\nGoogle Chrome Version 109.0.5414.119\nopenSUSE Leap 15.4\nHTH\n\nA: Might this link be of any handy?\nhttp://npopson.com/archives/1022\nI believe it's pretty much up for google'ing or somehow changing the chrome's protocols (although there's no in-browser alternative for about:config as in firefox)\n\nA: Opera has a feature to open the current page in another browser.

It is too low a resolution.  I have 'emblem' set as the overlay icon for Compiz's scale and this seems to be an acceptable resolution for this context.  However, the icon that is got by the launcher is different to the one that scale gets and is a lower resolution.  The Unity window switcher also gets an icon that it is too low a resolution.\n\nI have scoured all my directories for any .png with the letter 'j' (in the hope of finding 'java.png' or 'jvm.png' or something) in it and replaced all appropriate ones with a high resolution alternative, which has red rays emanating from the mug in the icon (the FÃ¦nzaâmy current icon themeâvariant).  As you can see, the icons above still all have orange rays and are not the right resolution.  I cannot find any reference now to a .png file with 'j' in it that looks like these icons.\nI would like to know where these icons are coming from and whether it is possible to replace them with higher resolution versions.  All my other icons are pretty.\n\nA: I had this annoying low-res icons with applications and managed to solve it by explicitly specifying the higher resolution icon to be used.\nI launched 'Main Menu', looked for the problematic application, clicked properties and then on the icon. I chose a new higher resolution icon for it. Remove it from launcher and add it again and it should now have the high resolution icon.\nThere is no one place where application icons are being placed. It can be /usr/share/pixmap,  /usr/share/icons or installed application directory.\nYou can always download from the internet high resolution icon, save it to some directory and reference it.\n", "Q: Firmware missing .can't connect to the internet ? please help am using a macbook air (late 2008) dual-booted mac osx and ubuntu 11.10 \ni cant connect to the internet as it says firmware missing \ni did the \"dmesg | grep -i firm\" command and this was the result :-\n[    0.209432] [Firmware Bug]: ACPI: BIOS _OSI(Linux) query ignored <br>\n[    2.377469] Broadcom 43xx driver loaded [ Features: PNL, Firmware-ID: FW13 ] <br>\n[    2.598274] b43-phy0 ERROR: Firmware file \"b43/n0initvals11.fw\" not found <br> \n[    2.598278] b43-phy0 ERROR: Firmware file \"b43-open/ucode11.fw\" not found <br>\n[    2.598282] b43-phy0 ERROR: You must go to http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Drivers/b43#devicefirmware and download the correct firmware for this driver version.

Or simply when I run the wubi installer, can I indicate that install on virtual box?\nThe problem is that I don't have nero on my machine so I can't burn the ubuntu iso file on dvd or cd(I am using windows 7).\n\nA: No need to use wubi: VirtualBox can install an OS direct from a .iso file, no CD required.\nJust create a blank VM, and the first time you boot it VirtualBox will ask you where your install disk is. Just give it to .iso file, and you're done! :)\nI'm not sure what the second part of your question means, but yes, you can run all normal programs, as long as your machine is powerful enough.\n\nA: You can simply select the iso file as image for a \"virtual cd drive\" in virtual box and boot the virtual machine from this virtual CD.

(System: 11.10 running Unity 3D)\nWhen update-apt-xapi is running, CPU usage stays at 100% (for about a couple of minutes). Is that normal?\nI understand that the command runs update-apt-xapian-index to update the index of software packages.\nMy question is this: is such high CPU usage for a couple of minutes acceptable? (I have a Dell Inspiron 1545 laptop and the processor is \"IntelÂ® Coreâ¢2 Duo CPU T6400 @ 2.00GHz Ã 2 \")\nIf it could be harmful, what precaution can a non-technically proficient user take?\n\nA: Listing some alternatives to the package removal solution.\n\n\n*\n\n*You can make /etc/cron.weekly/apt-xapian-index-update non-executable:\nchmod a-x /etc/cron.weekly/apt-xapian-index-update\n\n*Alternatively, edit that script to pass the parameter --update to the update-apt-xapian-index command, so that it will update the index rather than rebuilding it. (For example, on 13.04, replace the parts $CMD --quiet with $CMD --update --quiet) (Source)\nNote that removing the package (or preventing its execution) will not break the system, but it will slow down searches in Synaptic and APT. See also: \"What kind of harm there is from removing (purging) package apt-xapian-index?\"\n\nA: Agreed that having your CPU usage at 100% for several minutes will not cause any harm.\nYou can always use:\nacpi -tf\n\nto check the systems temperature, if you are concerned.\nAlso, instead of killing the process you may want to try adjusting the priority of the process.\nFirst find the process id:\npgrep update-apt-xapian-index\n\nThen set the priority (-20 is highest and 19 is lowest):\nrenice 19 -p PID\n\nThat would set the update process to the lowest priority. It would take longer to finish, but would make the system usable while it is running. \n\nA: I have run across an article which gives the code for making update-apt-xapi play nice, and reduce CPU usage. Read it here.\nI haven't tested it personally yet, but I'm about to -- and the comment thread gives evidence of positive results.\nUpdate - the article linked provides some lines to add/modify in the cron file to reduce CPU during update. As it turned out, those lines were already present in my case, so no help for me there. Might make a difference for others.\n\nA: It is completely harmless. If it were to go on and on and on, you could run:\nsudo killall update-apt-xapian-index\nto save your CPU from frying :D, which is only likely to be a risk when your system has bad cooling.\nTo answer your \"sub-question\", it is not really \"acceptable\", so much as it is not what is ideal, but it is \"acceptable\" in the sense that it does not stay going for long enough to cause damage :).\nPro-tip:\nWhen this program is running, stop doing what ever it is you are doing on the computer at the time unless it is critical/important, and if you have the cpu-frequency indicator, set it to performance for the moment, and let the application run through its paces. This way, it will finish faster, and your system will be smoother to use when it's over (because of less of a lock on the resources).\n\nA: Could only be solved satisfactory with:\napt-get purge apt-xapian-index\n\nThis removed the faulty program from the system and I trust my laptop will not start to use 100% CPU and simultaneously trash hard drives again.\n", "Q: After upgrade, the system does not start I have installed Ubuntu 10.10 in my system.\nMy system consist of : Pentium III, / M.B.: CUSL2 Asus / 512 MB RAM.\nWhen I upgraded online through Terminal Commands, it was\nupgraded to Ubuntu 11.04.

Since 2 days ago I can't edit any connections using network manager, because the \"edit\" button is greyed out. I tried doing a normal restart of the service to no avail. \nAny suggestions?\n\nA: For NetworkManager to manage an interface, that interface must not be configured under /etc/network/interfaces.

I want to add the Apache user (www-data) to the audio group. I've read the man page for useradd, but I'm not having any luck. I'm running xubuntu 11.10. Here's what I'm doing:\n$ sudo useradd -G audio www-data\nuseradd: user 'www-data' already exists\n\nIf I leave out the -G option, bash, prints the help info for useradd:\n$ sudo useradd  audio www-data\nUsage: useradd [options] LOGIN\nOptions: -b, --base-dir BASE_DIR       base directory for the home directory...\n\nIt's not clear to me from the man page what options I should use to make this work.\n\nA: On Ubuntu, since logging in as root is not enabled, users in the sudo group can elevate privileges for certain restricted commands.

Otherwise, the user will be removed from any groups, not in the list.\n\n*The -G switch takes a (comma-separated) list of additional groups to assign the user to.\nIn general (for the GUI, or for already running processes, etc.), the user will need to log out and log back in to see their new group added.

If you run grep <groupname> /etc/group, you should see your username in the output.\nIn Linux, every process is assigned to a user and groups, and any child processes inherit the user and groups of the parent process. So, for this change to take effect and propogate, you need to log out and log in again (at which point /etc/group is read and used). On Wayland, I've found that a full reboot is necessary.\nIf you run the command groups, you can see if the current process has the expected groups or not.\n", "Q: Customize Ubuntu Server to load a minimal desktop only when needed I would like to have an install with:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu Desktop with no additional applications or games\n\n*Graphical interface only when I manually run 'startx' \n\n\nI am using Ubuntu server and would like a GUI, but do not want all of the additional desktop applications and games. (I'm using it with CLI mode.)\n\nA: I did exactly this myself using:\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop --no-install-recommends\n\nKeep in mind that this will give you the bare minimum for a graphical desktop and will probably enable lightdm at startup.

Probably you should just remove the lightdm package.\n\nA: See the Server GUI documentation for how to do this. Before installing a GUI on an Ubuntu Server system, please take note of the good reasons given there for not to install or run GUI's on production servers.\nOn any Ubuntu system with a display manager installed (which provides graphical login), you can disable graphical login (requiring a user to run startx to start X11) using these instructions. However, since GDM is replaced with LightDM in Oneiric (though you can still install and use GDM if you want), you should run sudo service lightdm start instead of sudo service gdm start if you're on Ubuntu 11.10 (or later, as more releases come out).\n", "Q: Is there a note taking app that can synchronise across computers?

I did notice a problem of not being able to click the leftmost area of the scrollbar when the dock extension was activated - like the dock was stealing the mouse pointer from the other applications - but still, no dock.\nSo, I found this answer and followed it to the letter, and it did get rid of the scheme parsing error, but I'm still getting alot of Gtk-CRITICAL errors when I run the tweak tool - I get 20 times the same error:\n(gnome-tweak-tool:3158): Gtk-CRITICAL **: gtk_widget_get_preferred_height_for_width: assertion 'width >= 0' failed\nAlso, now I can't enable the extensions in the tweak tool(before I edited the files in gtweak I could set them to on - they just didn't work) and I get an orange warning triangle next to them.\nSo, does anyone know how to solve this?\n\nA: Update gnome-tweak-tool either from git-master or from the ppa:ricotz/testing PPA.\nIt has just been changed to fix compatibility with gnome-shell master.\n", "Q: Adding custom applications to GNOME 3 launcher Looking for a utility that allows me insert an item into the list of applications that GNOME knows about. \nFor example:\nI have downloaded Eclipse EE (I have some very special plugins that I need to work with, and those plugins don't \"like\" the version available in the default repository). I'm using GNOME 3, on Ubuntu 11.10. So I want to execute Eclipse w/o opening a terminal and running it. \nIt must be something very simple.\n\nA: You can use Main Menu for this.

You can create custom launchers for whatever is in your home folder, by either manually creating and editing a custom .desktop file, or by using Alacarte, the old Gnome menu editor.\nThe custom launcher is just a text file, named, for example, EclipseEE.desktop, with the following content:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Eclipse EE\nExec=/home/mrPeterson/path_to_executable\nStartupNotify=true\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nIcon=/optional/path/to/icon.png\n\n\nA: I like Jorge's simple gnome-desktop-item-edit solution.

Where can we find out what the expected changes for the next version of Ubuntu are?\n\nA: One way to keep track of news of new features is to read one of many well-known blogs or news sites that are Ubuntu-specific during each release's development cycle. Examples include OMG! Ubuntu and Web Upd8.\nIf you don't mind wading through mounds of technical stuff, there are blueprints for Ubuntu at Launchpad that could offer some clues as to what will come in the next release.\nLastly, there is the Ubuntu Contributors Channel on YouTube, which keeps a large collection of video recordings from the Ubuntu Developer Summits, as well as interviews with some of the developers.\n", "Q: Firefox: open downloaded files with system default application When I download a file with firefox, it always asks me with what program I want to open it with, even when that type of file is recognized by the system, and I can double click on it in Nautilus and have it open properly.\nThis is an example with a deb file, which opens with Ubuntu Software center (as it should) when I double click on it in Nautilus.\n\nI do not want to look for the required program in /usr/bin or whatever in the Firefox dialog, I want Firefox to recognize my system preferences. What I resort to doing now is choose \"Download\", open Nautilus and double click on the file...\nWhy can't Firefox recognize my system settings, and how do I get it to?\nThanks!\n\nA: Use /usr/bin/xdg-open (it's part of xdg-utils package) to open all the files.\n\nA: I can provide some perspective on why Firefox isn't more tightly integrated into Ubuntu. Applications like Firefox and OpenOffice/Libreoffice are designed to work on a wide variety of operating environments including various Linux distributions, Desktop environments, Windows OS, Apple OS and many others. All of those environments are moving targets. For example Gnome has gone to GTK 3.0 but not every application in the latest Ubuntu release has upgraded from GTK 2.0 and of course let's not forget Unity has entered the fray. To that end Firefox and their ilk loosely couple with operating environments so that development can focus on the core features of the application. Being all things to all people or for applications in this case all environments can be destructive to core goals. Clearly tight integration is conceivable and desirable from an individual user's perspective. It's a matter of priorities and complexity. The desirability of regular concurrent releases for all environments is also a factor.\n\nA: There are different settings involved here:\n\n\n*\n\n*What program Firefox proposes when downloading a file (as in the image posted in the question)\n\n*What program Firefox uses when accessing an online file\n\n*What program opens a file already downloaded when clicked in the Firefox downloads list.\n\nFor the first two options, the \"Applications\" settings under Preferences/Options (about:preferences as address) should do the trick (if it doesn't it is a bug and it should be reported as such).\nExample for a deb file:\n\nIf the setting is to save, the file will be saved in Downloads or a selected location; if the setting is to open with an application, the file will be first saved anyway in a temporary location and then opened. If no program appears selected upon download try the above setting; if that doesn't work, try the below solution.\n\nFor the third case\n(on how to make Firefox downloads list open a file in a desired application):\nSome newly installed applications take over the \"default\" status in FF's about:preferences instead of the per-filetype normal application set at system level (e.g. Palemoon takes over as default instead of gwenview for jpeg files, Inskape or File Roller takes over instead of Okular for pdf file.). \n\"Always ask\" is the choice that should be used in this case and then trying to create a per-user file ~/.local/share/applications/mimeinfo.cache with the lines:\n[MIME Cache]\napplication/pdf=okularApplication_pdf.desktop\n\nThe disadvantage of the above is that it is a per-file-type setting. To have a solution for all files (as said in this answer), run: \ncd .local/share/applications/\nln -s mimeapps.list defaults.list\n\nIn case this stops working: see that the undesired application is not again selected under about:preferences: be sure \"Always ask\" is selected there. Setting manually a different program (even the default for your file-type at system level, but which is not marked as \"default\" in the list for your file under about:preferences) might not work.\nTested in Firefox 60.0 in Kubuntu 18.04.\n\nSomething is not right with the Firefox settings. \"Always ask\" and \"Save file\" do not make sense for files already downloaded, therefore settings under about:preferences shouldn't affect the Downloads list. But they do. And they do in an inconsistent manner: only selecting the application marked as default is followed, switching to another application is not. To reverse that one might need to select \"Always ask\" and then follow the steps mentioned above.\n\nA: You should go to Edit â¸ Preferences â¸ Applications and decide what Firefox should do with every kind of files available. You can choose it to open with a certain application or to ask what to do. \nThat's the easiest, one click-way of doing it. Or you can use the dialog that appears (an that you have showed here), choose an application to open it and enable Do this automatically for files like this from now on. Next time you open one of these files it won't ask you again.\nBut I recommend the first solution.\n", "Q: Is it possible to get a mouse button (not recognized by xev) working? I am using Microsoft Explorer Touch Mouse and I am trying to get two buttons recognized. Mouse, of course, comes with a custom software for Windows and Macosx to customize the buttons, but not for Linux.\nUnfortunately, xev just ignores those two button presses. \nIs it possible at all to get them recognized? If it is, where do I start?\n\nA: I'm really no expert on this, but I think there's a way to listen to the low level signals/events you get. \nI would unplug/plug the device to figure out where its device is created in the filesystem /dev/input and try to find a tool that \"listens\" to this device.

Since I am new to Ubuntu, and as the GUI makes finding and installing applications a snap (at least for me), I was checking if there's a remote desktop feature for Ubuntu Server and I found out this...\n[1] Is the following true?\nUbuntu Desktop = Ubuntu Server + GUI + pre-installed apps meant mostly for desktop use\n\n[2] If the above is true, (a) I can instead ask my web hosting provider to provide me with a dedicated server with Ubuntu desktop version installed, right? (b) Will I be on the losing end by installing Ubuntu desktop for a server? I mean, will it use up much more RAM for processes? And will it be slower compared to Ubuntu Server - - i.e., will the website/application hosted on it load slower etc?\n[2] Suppose that I've a Ubuntu Server-installed dedicated server provided by a web hosting provider. And all I have is access to terminal, how do I enable remote desktop? like this?\nsudo aptitude install ubuntu-desktop\n\nWhat next? How do I proceed with enabling remote desktop on the server? and then how do I connect from my desktop? I have only found GUI-based HOW TOs, and no credible terminal-based solutions. So, please don't take this for a duplicate.\n[4] Would enabling remote desktop as mentioned above cause any security issues, really?\n[5] I was told that KDE's GUI is faster and better performant when compared to Gnome and Unity. Is that true? (Which means, I should use this command for [3]: sudo aptitude install xubuntu-desktop --or-- sudo aptitude install kubuntu-desktop)\nExtremely sorry if this is not the way (putting a lot of questions into one - - I thought they're related, so...)\n\nA: You should not need a GUI installed on the server (just the \"skeleton\" files installed with the package xserver-common), nor remote desktop, in order to use graphical package management tools. You can instead use ssh -X to connect to the server and run the application:\nssh -c blowfish -C -X username@hostname\nYou can leave off the -c blowfish and or -C, but if you do, your connection will likely be noticeably slower when running graphical programs. But if you were on a LAN with the machine, then I'd recommend leaving out -C and keeping -c blowfish.\n(-c blowfish makes ssh use the blowfish cipher, which is as secure as the 128-bit AES cipher which is otherwise the default, but which tends to be computationally faster, decreasing latency. -C enables compression, if it's available, which increases speed on slow connections--including just about any connection over the Internet--by making it so that there is less data that needs to be transferred. However, -C is not usually helpful on very fast connections such as when the client and server are on the same local area network, because in that case the increased latency caused by performing the computational operations of data compression and decompression can more than cancel out the benefit of transferring a smaller volume of data. See the descriptions of the -c and -C options on the ssh(1) manpage, and Ciphers in the ssh_config(5) manpage, for more details about how to use those flags. And in general, if you are curious about how a command works, you can look at its manual page by issuing the command man command-name or online.)\nThen you can install whatever graphical package management utility you want:\nsudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install software-center\nOr: sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install synaptic\nOr: sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install update-manager\n(You can, of course, install more than one--after running sudo apt-get update, run a command like sudo apt-get install update-manager synaptic.)\nThen run whichever utility you want to use, by typing its name (they all have the same executable names as package names...though that is not true for all software in Ubuntu) and pressing enter.\nSince you're logged in with ssh -X, programs that you run on the remote server will display their windows and other graphical user interface element on the local (client) machine.\nThis will likely work out of the box when connecting from another Unix-like system. However, if the client is Windows, then you'll need to use an SSH client that supports X11 forwarding, and you'll need to have an X11 installed and running on the client machine. You can achieve this pretty easily with Cygwin (see the Cygwin/X User's Guide).\nIt is possible (and quite easy) to install GUI's on an Ubuntu Server system, though it is considered inadvisable to do so for a production system. You can do this yourself (assuming you have administrative rights on the system, and if you don't, then you cannot perform any package management at all!). See the Server GUI documentation. But please take note of the (good) reasons, explained on that page, for why you probably should not do this.\n\nA: 1- I think not: Ubuntu Server is optimized for server usage ServerFAQ.\n2- To enable \"remote desktop\", you should first choose what technology you will use to connect to server (SSH, VNC, NX, etc). If you use SSH, you just have to install openssh-server on server, and configure it to your needs.\n4- It depends how you configure it. For example, with SSH you can configure server to only accept connections from certain IP addresses, or only allow connections from machines with certain RSA keys... But generally, if you use a strong password, \n5- XFCE is faster in my experience, KDE i dont know.\nNote: Maybe SSH it's not the best tool to do what you want, especially if you want to \"see a desktop\" :)\n", "Q: Has anyone gotten Edimax 7811 to work under 11.10? I recently upgraded to Ubuntu 11.10. Afterwards I needed to have wireless capability on the same machine. The Edimax 7811 is listed as Linux compatible, but it did not work with Ubuntu 11.10.

I have a big problem with Unity in terms of speed (I don't remember having this sort of problems with Gnome 2.x), my pc became slow when switching between the menus (in the same application).\nUsing the global menu or the normal menu for applications that haven't been ported yet. I have a Asus 1215N netbook.\nI think the problem comes from the theme because this doesn't happens with Gnome3 Fallback or Gnome-Shell, but it happens with Unity-2D.\nHow can I solve this problem ?\n\nA: Yes, it is an understood problem. No, you can't fix it, unless you're a programmer.\nTo explain the technical details, application menus in Unity are broadcasted over D-Bus, and depending on the menu complexity and toolkit implementation, this can result in noticeable lag.

I loved how the appearance app was the go-to place for 80% of everything pertaining to how your desktop looked. it had a built in theme installer, and had a visual way to see an example of how controls, window borders, and icons all would look before even selecting them. I know that right now is a transitional period with Ubuntu/Gnome communities. But I really hate how its very awkward to really change themes. \nWith the old app, it basically was extremely self explanatory how themes worked and I was a very \"Windows\" focused user that didn't much more than create folder, drag and drop, etc. And it may sound stupid, but the way the old app made it \"stupid simple\" to change themes and mix control themes with window themes, is what kept dragging me away from Windows. Cause I didn't know anything about the real Freedom of Linux, except that it let me make my desktop look how I wanted it to. Now that's gone, what is there to really pull the kind of new user that I used to be??\nThis isn't a huge things for me, as I've learned how to install themes with the \"sudo ./install\" that most theme packages utilize. But I really think its a big issue for attracting new users. Any light that can be shed on this would be very appreciated.\n\nA: No, the 10.10 interface is gone, and unless the GNOME devs add more functionality to the new one, you can't get it back in 11.10. (Also, the new functionality would have to come in 12.04/Precise or later.)\nYour best bet at this point is a third-party alternative, if one exists. (I haven't looked.)\n", "Q: Can I run the same instance on two machines, without connecting from remote? Just wondering if I can run the same Ubuntu instance on two machines, without connecting from remote. I have 2 laptop with both the latest version, same programs but I cannot remotely access to share or server outside the local network, one laptop always with me and a desktop. I don't want to work from a remote session anyway, I'd like work on different machines like as if were only one.\n\nA: If you mean \"connecting from remote\" as a remote desktop solution, then yes, that is not necessary. You do need to synchronize them somehow, and we have solutions for that. For instance, Ubuntu One can be used to synchronize files between computers. There is also something called OneConf that can be used to synchronize application settings, etc. \n", "Q: multiple printer entries shown for HP Officejet 4500 in CUPS system-config-printer 1.2.0 I upgraded from 8.04 to 10.04 in September. When I access System > Administration > Printing, I see multiple printers although I only have one connected i.e. I see:\n\n\n*\n\n*Officejet_4500_G510a-f (green check mark on left corner)\n\n*Officejet_4500_G510a-f2\n\n*Officejet_4500_G510a-fax\n\n*Officejet_4500_G510a-fax2\n\n*Officejet_4500_G510a-fax3\n\n*PDF\n\n\nShould I delete what seem to be duplicates e.g. the f2, fax2 and fax3? \n\nA: I was able to delete the duplicates without causing any problems. Also, by deleting all the printers and then re-installing the printer driver via Server -> New -> Printer, I was able to stop the printer from printing an extra blank page at the end of print jobs. When re-installing the driver, when you get to the \"Select Device\" step, make sure you select the printer and not the fax software. In my case, the printer was below the fax, which you would select if re-installing the driver for the fax function.\n", "Q: How to delete files used by kernel? I have a very peculiar situation. I installed a piece of software by building it from source. I used \"make install\" from the folder that I downloaded it into (on my desktop). Later on, after not using it for a while, I decided I don't need the folder on my desktop and shift-deleted it. Most files in that folder were deleted, but some of them cannot. It says I have no permissions to do it.\nWhat I am assuming is that those files are used by the kernel, because the software was built from source. Is this correct, and if so, how can I delete them? Can I boot in another kernel or do something like Windows's safe mode?\n\nA: sudo rm -rf ~/Desktop/<path_to_folder>\n\nThe reason you cannot remove that folder is that during compiling and installation some files where created with administrator privileges (probably using sudo), you wont be able to remove those with your account.\nIts not that the files are being used at the moment, you simply don't have any rights to delete them.\nUse the command above to delete the files under that folder, it will grant you privileges to remove it.\n\nA: When you do \"make install\", the program files are copied to system. Those files you can't delete probably belong to root. To delete them, hit Alt+F2 and execute:\ngksu nautilus ~/Desktop\n\nThis will open a Nautilus window, from where you can delete the folder you need. Please note that this Nautilus window has root access to files, so when you delete what you need close it :)\n", "Q: Which is the best version of Ubuntu for Aspire 4736z?

You switch to it by clicking on the button next to the password field when logging in. It's called Ubuntu 2D. \n", "Q: Can I use an Outlook Anywhere account? My company uses Outlook Anywhere with Exchange 2010.

You should not have any problems.\n\nA: The latest gnome spin of ubuntu comes with exchange web services support. Mail contacts and calendars. This is the only reliable way of achieving this without using imap or pop. \nYour organisation needs to hsve the web services exposed.\n", "Q: iTunes Alternatives for Ubuntu I have started using Ubuntu very recently.

Thanks! \n\nA: Rhythmbox or banshee both are very good and they support ipods and iphones.\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcuts aren't working in GNOME Shell It seems that this problem is specific to Ubuntu and not Gnome 3 itself, that's why I'm not posting it on SuperUser but here.\nI installed at least 3 instances of Ubuntu Oneiric Ocelot (11.10) on different hardware lately, all intended to work with gnome-shell (Gnome 3) as default Desktop environment.\nOn two of these system the default shortcut of Alt+F2 did not work from the beginning. I had to configure it over the System Settings > Keyboard > Shortcuts under System > Show the command prompt to make it work. But on the system where it worked, the shortcut in this window was not visibly configured.\nAlso I wanted to configure Win+e to open my Home folder with Nautilus and Win+w to open a gnome-terminal. I configured this on the Launchers menu, it then showed Mod4+W and Mod4+E now accordingly. Note that the W and E are upper case, don't know if this is relevant.\nThe shortcut to open a terminal works in most of the cases, although in some rare cases I can't get it to open the terminal, no matter how often I press the button. This is clearly not the meaning of a global hotkey.\nEven worse: The shortcut to open my Home folder almost never works. If I'm in a textbox in Firefox for example, I see the cursor blinking up when pressing, but nothing happens. If the Desktop is on focus, for pressing Win+e I get a little textbox in the lower right showing an e as if selecting a file in Nautilus by simply typing while in focus. But the problem exists also outside of textboxes. In most of the cases it helps to hammer it multiple times but then most of the times multiple instances of Nautilus open up. This is clearly not useful.\nWhat is it with the global hotkeys? Those things did always make problems for me, already in lower versions of Ubuntu and in Gnome 2. Now it seems to be out of control completely. What components are responsible for handling this? What can I do to make this work smoothly all the time and on all installations?\n\nA: This is an Ubuntu-specific bug. A workaround is to run this command from the terminal to get your keyboard shortcuts working again:\nmv ~/.gconf/apps/metacity/global_keybindings ~/.gconf/apps/metacity/global_keybindings-old\n\n", "Q: How to get suspend when idle if no user logged in (lightdm) I can't figure out how to get Ubuntu 11.10 to suspend when idle from a lightdm login screen.

The one feature of Gnone Shell that I would love in Unity is the 'Dynamic Workspaces'. Is there a way to emulate this functionality within Unity?\nI know it can be changed via CCSM, but that method is slow and defeats the purpose of dynamic workspaces.\n\nA: No, that's currently not possible. I think everyone agrees that is a very nice feature of Gnome Shell, so I wouldn't be surprised if we get a similar feature in Unity. \n", "Q: Display is wrong at startup until I click on \"display\" then it's fine? -dual montors Unity 2D My display is wrong after it reboots. I then go to \"displays\" and without touching anything else it fixes itself. I then close out the \"display\" function and the resolutions are correct and the monitors are not mirroring each other.\nI am using Ubuntu 11.10 in Unity 2D mode. I have dual monitors setup.\nHow can I fix this so I don't have to open up the \"displays\" every-time I reboot?\n\nA: I have had this problem and solved it by editing the monitors.xml file in your .config folder (Ubuntu 11.10 dual monitor set up instructions)\nThese are the steps you should try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open up a terminal (ctrl+alt+t)\n\n*Go to your config folder (cd ~/.config)\n\n*Open up your file for editing (gedit monitors.xml)\n\n*Ensure that <primary>yes</primary> is on the correct output/monitor (and <primary>no</primary> is on the other)\n\n*Ensure that <clone>no</clone> is included on the third line\n\n\nThis may not affect the log in screen though as LightDM has its own monitor settings (annoyingly). Hopefully this works for you\n\nA: I solved the problem by using the graphical interface \"Display\" in the Ubuntu Settings (I simply changed a random parameter to let it save the shown configuration and then everything started to work again properly).\nPs. The answer provided by captain_G unfortunately doesn't work.\nIt seems that the monitor.xml file is mainly ignored (even though I change something everything come back to the previous situation at startup).\nHowever, after the changes made through the graphical interface, my monitor.xml file contains the following configuration:\n<monitors version=\"1\">\n  <configuration>\n      <clone>no</clone>\n      <output name=\"eDP-1\">\n          <vendor>BOE</vendor>\n          <product>0x06a9</product>\n          <serial>0x00000000</serial>\n          <width>1920</width>\n          <height>1080</height>\n          <rate>60</rate>\n          <x>0</x>\n          <y>0</y>\n          <rotation>normal</rotation>\n          <reflect_x>no</reflect_x>\n          <reflect_y>no</reflect_y>\n          <primary>yes</primary>\n      </output>\n      <output name=\"HDMI-1\">\n      </output>\n      <output name=\"DP-1\">\n      </output>\n      <output name=\"HDMI-2\">\n      </output>\n  </configuration>\n  <configuration>\n      <clone>yes</clone>\n      <output name=\"eDP-1\">\n          <vendor>BOE</vendor>\n          <product>0x06a9</product>\n          <serial>0x00000000</serial>\n          <width>1920</width>\n          <height>1080</height>\n          <rate>120</rate>\n          <x>0</x>\n          <y>0</y>\n          <rotation>normal</rotation>\n          <reflect_x>no</reflect_x>\n          <reflect_y>no</reflect_y>\n          <primary>yes</primary>\n      </output>\n      <output name=\"HDMI-1\">\n          <vendor>PHL</vendor>\n          <product>0xc0c5</product>\n          <serial>0x00000626</serial>\n          <width>1920</width>\n          <height>1080</height>\n          <rate>60</rate>\n          <x>1920</x>\n          <y>0</y>\n          <rotation>normal</rotation>\n          <reflect_x>no</reflect_x>\n          <reflect_y>no</reflect_y>\n          <primary>no</primary>\n      </output>\n      <output name=\"DP-1\">\n      </output>\n      <output name=\"HDMI-2\">\n      </output>\n  </configuration>\n</monitors>\n\n", "Q: Why hasn't Mozilla's Firefox Beta PPA updated yet?

While it is extremely unlikely that you could recover your Windows system, it may be possible for you to recover some important documents that it contained. You can follow these instructions for doing so, starting with shutting down the system immediately (sudo shutdown -P now) if you have not done so already.\nYou'll need a live CD/DVD or live USB flash drive for this, but you should not attempt to create it on the current Ubuntu system, because (1) the longer you run the Ubuntu Server system, even if you are not doing much with it, the greater the risk of irreversible data loss from the contents of the old Windows partition, and (2) if you were to download a large file (like the Ubuntu desktop CD .iso image) on the system, that would be very likely to overwrite data that had belonged to files that were stored on the Windows system, very possibly including the important documents you wish to recover.\nIf those instructions don't enable you to recover your lost files, then you'll have to decide whether or not it's worth it to hire a data recovery specialist, which could cost thousands of dollars. You should probably not hire someone who is not a specialist for this purpose if these methods are not successful, because only a specialist is likely to be able to recover data not recoverable by those methods.\nAs for getting Windows back, you will need to reinstall it to achieve this. If your computer came with Windows but did not come with installation media (like a CD, DVD, or USB flash drive) then it is usually possible to order a Windows installation CD/DVD from your computer's manufacturer at relatively low cost (certainly much less than it would cost to buy another copy of Windows providing a new and separate license).\n", "Q: Can't get whole picture on the screen of a new monitor I have a 24inch, VM2453mh-LED, Viewsonic monitor using a Radeon 6570HD video card. Both are new. Viewsonic says the optimum size is 1920x1080. At this size the picture is beautiful, but it overlaps the screen vertically and horizontally. I am using Ubuntu 11.10, the Gnome 3 version, not Unity. On the Overview screen, the vertical icons are nearly off screen. Only the right edge shows. I opened the monitor's control menus to see if I could adjust it, but both the H/V Position and Horizontal Size are grayed out.\nI tried a 1600x1200 setting, and the picture was in bounds, but the quality was less, and it was stretched horizontally. The two monitor menu options were grayed out just like with the 1920x1080 setting.\nCan someone tell me how to resolve this problem?\n\nA: I think you can adjust this by using the AMD Radeon Catalyst Control Center application. In looking for solutions to a different problem I read a fair amount about \"overscan\" and \"underscan\" and by adjusting the \"scaling options\" you may be able to resolve the issue at 1920x1080.

Apart from having the security tools...\nBecause if there isn't I don't see why you couldn't use backtrack 5 as a main OS...\n\nA: Currently Backtrack Linux is a derivative of Ubuntu, and besides a bit of rebranding, it is just like an Ubuntu system with all the tools installed. Since it supports installing to a hard disk, you certainly can run it as your main operating system. Alternatively you could install an Ubuntu system and install whatever tools you want (all of them, if you want all of them). Furthermore, you could even customize an Ubuntu live CD or DVD (or live USB flash drive) yourself to include the tools included with Backtrack.\n\nA: There is no reason why you can't use Backtrack as your main is, especially if you do a lot of security work and would use the tools. Something like ubuntu is more convinent, however, because of its strong user community. Backtrack does not have a strong community because conventianally it is not used as a main OS.\n\nA: I not agree that backtrack dont have a strong community, people there are very helpfull and help you with whatever it is.. It is of course not that good community as here, but its groing, and you can use most of the information here in backtrack, since it is Almost the same. After what i can understand it is \"an extension\" of ubuntu.. Correct me if i wrong. (the url: backtrack-linux.org )\n\nA: Quoting this backtrack faq\n\nWhy cant I just add the Backtrack repositories to my Ubuntu install or the Ubuntu repositories to my Backtrack install ?\nWe highly recommend against this action because Backtrack tools are built with many custom features, libraries and kernel. We have no way of knowing how they will perform on a non Backtrack distribution, plus you will very quickly break your install.\nAlso if you chose to add the ubuntu repositories to your Backtrack install, you will most certainly break your entire Backtrack install very quickly.\nWe do a lot of testing to ensure that all packages in our repo will work together without causing problems.\n\nI think, Backtrack gone through some very critical changes, so Ubuntu + security tools may not be equal a Backtrack.

For Ubuntu 18.04 and later the USB flash drive should be 4GB or larger.\n\n*\n\n*Open Rufus and select your USB stick in the Device dropdown menu.\n\n\n\n*Click the CD-ROM icon next to the FreeDOS dropdown menu, then find your downloaded Ubuntu ISO and click Open and then Start.\n\n\n\n*Click Yes when it asks to download Syslinux software.\n\n\n\n*Click OK to write in ISO Image mode.\n\n\n\n*Confirm that your USB stick is selected and then click OK to continue. It is very important to verify that the device that you are installing the Ubuntu live USB to is indeed your flash drive, so that you don't overwrite any of your system or personal files which may make your operating system unbootable.\n\n\n\n*When it is finished, just restart your computer and start using Ubuntu, or you can install Ubuntu.\n\nIn order to enable your computer to boot from the USB flash drive, you must enter your BIOS/UEFI setup utility by pressing one of these keys: Delete, F2 or F10 as soon as the motherboard splash screen appears when the computer is booting. In the BIOS/UEFI menu, you need to change the boot order so that the USB flash drive, which is usually called USB-HDD in newer computers, is the first entry in the boot sequence, and then save your new settings and exit the setup utility.\nMac\n\n*\n\n*You will need:\n\n*\n\n*A 4GB or larger USB stick/flash drive\n\n*An Apple computer or laptop running macOS\n\n*An Ubuntu ISO file. See Get Ubuntu for download links\n\n\n\n*To ensure maximum compatibility with Apple hardware, first blank and reformat the USB stick using Apple's \"Disk Utility\", but this step can be skipped if you intend to use the USB stick with only generic PC hardware.\n\n*\n\n*Launch Disk Utility from Applications -> Utilities or Spotlight search.\n\n\n*Insert your USB stick and observe the new device added to Disk Utility.\n\n\n*Select the USB stick device (you may need to enable the option View -> Show All Devices) and select Erase from the toolbar (or right-click menu).\n\n\n*Set the format to MS-DOS (FAT) and the scheme to GUID Partition Map.\n\n\n*Check you've chosen the correct device and click Erase.\n\nWarning: Disk Utility needs to be used with caution as selecting the wrong device or partition can result in data loss.\n\n\n*Install and run Etcher\nTo write the ISO file to the USB stick, use a free and open source application called Etcher. After downloading this and clicking to mount the package, Etcher can either be run in place or dragged into your Applications folder.\nBy default, recent versions of macOS block the running of applications from unidentified developers. To side-step this issue, enable App Store and identified developers in the Security & Privacy pane of System Preferences. If you are still warned against running the application, click Open Anyway in the same pane.\n\n\n\n*Etcher configuration\nEtcher will configure and write to your USB device in three stages, each of which needs to be selected in turn:\n\n*\n\n*Select image will open a file requester from which should navigate to and select the ISO file downloaded previously. By default, the ISO file will be in your Downloads folder.\n\n\n*Select drive, replaced by the name of your USB device if one is already attached, lets you select your target device. You will be warned if the storage space is too small for your selected ISO.\n\n\n*Flash! will activate when both the image and the drive have been selected. As with Disk Utility, Etcher needs low-level access to your storage hardware and will ask for your password after selection.\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \n\n\n\n\n\n*Write to device\nAfter entering your password, Etcher will start writing the ISO file to your USB device.\nThe Flash stage of the process will show progress, writing speed and an estimated duration until completion. This will be followed by a validation stage that will ensure the contents of the USB device are identical to the source image.\nWhen everything has finished, Etcher will declare the process a success.\nCongratulations! You now have Ubuntu on a USB stick, bootable and ready to go.\n\nWarning: After the write process has completed, macOS may inform you that 'The disk you inserted was not readable by this computer'. Don't select Initialize. Instead, select Eject and remove the USB device.\n\n\n*Boot your Mac\nIf you want to use your USB stick with an Apple Mac, you will need to restart or power-on the Mac with the USB stick inserted while the Option/alt â¥ key is pressed.\nThis will launch Apple's 'Startup Manager' which shows bootable devices connected to the machine. Your USB stick should appear as gold/yellow and labelled 'EFI Boot'. Selecting this will lead you to the standard Ubuntu boot menu.\n\nSource: Create a bootable USB stick on macOS\n\nA: You should try downloading an ISO image from http://www.ubuntu.com/download. This page describes how to burn the downloaded ISO to a disk after you obtained it.\n\nA: It's no longer possible to request a CD with the \"Ship-it\" service.

I can't find brightness settings that work from battery mode in the Ubuntu 11.10 screen settings.\nThere are some settings from Ubuntu 11.04 in gconf, 90% for AC and 60% for battery, but it doesn't work.\nHow can I have my display brightness dim automatically when on battery power?\n\nA: I tried a lot of things to no avail to get gnome-control-center in 11.10 to handle this like gnome-power-manager used to. \nI decideded to create a script and install it into pm-utils. \n#!/bin/sh\n\nON_AC=##\nON_BATT=##\n\nif [\"$1\" = \"true\"]; then\n\n    echo $ON_BATT > /sys/class/backlight/<device directory>/brightness\n\nfi\n\nif [\"$1\" = \"false\"]; then\n\n    echo $ON_AC > /sys/class/backlight/<device directory>/brightness\n\nfi\n\nexit 0\n\nI kept it simple because (hopefully) it is a temporary solution. You must manually set your desired values in the two variables above. Use the slider in the \"Screen\" settings gui to set your desired brightness, then use cat /sys/class/backlight/<device directory>/brightness to retrieve the corresponding numerical value. Substitue the name of your device's directory for <device directory>. Do it once for AC brightness and once for battery brightness. Plug the name of your device directory and the brightness values into the script.\nSave the script to a file in your home directory or wherever. I called it backlight. Make it executable with chmod a+x backlight and install it to pm-utils with sudo install backlight /usr/lib/pm-utils/power.d/\nI'm not sure how it works resuming from suspend/hibernate because I don't use it, but it works well when booting with or without ac, as well as when hotplugging the charger.\n\nA: To set your brightness to dim automatically on battery power go to your System Settings (search in your dash or go to your power/settings cog), then select Screen. It will give you a slider to turn battery dimming on and off.\nAs for changing brightness manually, if you don't have function keys to do so you may map key combinations to do so by going to System Settings > Keyboard > Shortcuts tab, and assigning brightness a new value.\n\nA: Open your Terminal and type xgamma -gamma followed by a value. Normal brightness is 1, so you can set 1.2 or 1.3 if you want to make it brighter, or .5 or 0.75 if you want to make it dimmer.\n\nA: The answer above by @Joey did not worked for me, probably things have changed in 13.10 but it gave me a hint that such script might work, so i searched and found a solution in archlinux wiki Archlinux wiki\nYou can put following in that backlight script, make it executable and put it in /usr/lib/pm-utils/power.d/. and plus change the paths and brightness values according to your settings. i have dual graphics system, and acpi_video0 i think is my amd graphics card settings, if you have intel graphics, you can change acpi_video0 to intel_backlight, or first navigate to that directory and check what do you have, intel_backlight or acpi_video0 or something else. then you can check your brightness values in actual brightness file and maximum brightness file. and finally make sure that you have right permissions for that file. \n#!/bin/bash\n\ncase $1 in\n    true)\n        echo 12 > /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness\n    ;;\n    false)\n        echo 100 > /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness\n    ;;\nesac\n\n\nA: You don't say you've tried the obvious, so just in case ...\nDoes you machine have Fn keys to do that?

To enable it you can add these lines in /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf\n#\n# VNC Server configuration\n#\n# enabled = True if VNC connections should be allowed\n# port = TCP/IP port to listen for connections on\n#\n[VNCServer]\nenabled=true\nport=5901\nwidth=1024\nheight=768\ndepth=8\n\nIt will support only tightvncserver (vnc4server will not work) and it will only enable you to connect to a new session through vnc but when the vncviwer is closed the session is destroyed.\nOn Ubuntu 9.04, I was able to launch a session, disconnect, and then reconnect to it but was not able to do it with this solution.\n", "Q: Accessing my files from Windows I recently installed Ubuntu alongside Windows. I have seen several guides giving me the same advice as to how to mount my harddrive with my Windows files in it in Ubuntu but it doesn't ever show my drive when I click the home folder. Is there anything I can do?\n\nA: I guess you have NTFS file system on your windows partition. If not, please do not try to use the ntfs-3g driver!\nHere is a pointer to an excellent document on the configuration of fstab config file:\nFSTAB configuration\nfstab is a config file in which partitions are named which should be mounted at boot time. In Linux, partitions are mounted into a folder, thus you have to create a line similar to this for your windows partition:\n/dev/hda2 /media/windows ntfs-3g defaults,locale=en_US.utf8 0 0\n\nThis line makes Linux mount the device /dev/hda2 (replace this with the device of your windows partition) to the folter /media/windows (replace this by the folder where you wish your windows files to appear). I suggest to keep it in /media/... and then create a nautilus bookmark for simple access.\nLast point: Warning! Be careful when editing your /etc/fstab file. A corrupt line in there could make your ubuntu unbootable!\n", "Q: Sound unavailable every other session On my desktop running Oneiric, sometimes there's no sound at all, but it would work normally at other times. My setup is built ground-up from minimal Ubuntu, but since sounds work fine, at times, I don't think it is a backend dependency issue. When it works, it will play anything from regular audio files and movies to YouTube Flash players.\nFor the record, I installed LXDE with the alsa-base and alsa-utils packages which are the only audio-related dependencies for the lubuntu-desktop.\nFor a while, I also used persistent Oneiric live USB, and do not recall any sound issues.\nIt's one thing to not play sound entirely, but playing sound only under some very unclear circumstances is something else. Please help me diagnose it.\n\nA: Maybe you have problems with alsa-mixer configuration.\nFirst thing I would do on your place is go to terminal and type \"alsa-mixer\".\nThis will bring you to audio settings and you can explore it and something might be wrong there.\nIt has a built in help so you it shouldn't be hard to do things you want.\nIf it works at least sometimes then hardware-side is ok.\nMy guess is that some software just changes audio settings to its' needs and breaks stuff.\nWould be useful if you could provide circumstances when it works or not.\nYou can always reinstall alsa to check if some dependencies are missing.\nP.S.: I myself use similar system, but I installed lxde(not lubuntu-desktop) over minimal installation, so I should have even less stuff installed.\n\nA: first sorry about my english \nI have the same problem, and I found this thread about that.\nIn a \"muted\" session I have changed pulse audio configuration as explained there, and killed the process pulseaudio, and I hear again the sound.\nI still need to check if it will work after restarts.\nI hope this help you.\n\nA: I've had the same problem with XUbuntu 11.10 after removing pulseaudio.\nIf you have more than one sound card, ALSA does not always automatically default to the same card.\nI had onboard audio, a Sound Blaster PCI card and the integrated audio in a Nvidia Geforce 210 card (a lot of NVidia video cards have an audio controller so that they can output audio thru the HDMI port).\nSo, sometimes audio would output thru the Sound Blaster, everything was OK. Other times, it seemed to be mute. After some googling, I came up with instructions on how to make ALSA always use my preferred sound card:\nhttp://alsa.opensrc.org/FAQ026\n", "Q: Keyboard stopped working on persistant live-USB My keyboard has recently stopped working on my 11.10 persistant live USB. It works at the login screen, but when I log in, any time I hit a key I just hear the error \"pop\" sound. This happens in all of my sessions (unity, gnome shell, and gnome classic). Also tried the on screen keyboard (on-board), which didnt work either. Neither does the computers hardware power button, except when you hold it for 5 seconds.\nI doubt this has anything to do with it, but it the interest of complete information I'll tell you that just before the error started happening I installed \"Mediaplayer GNOME Shell extension\"\nhttps://github.com/eonpatapon/gnome-shell-extensions-mediaplayer\nAs soon as I refreshed gnome with \"alt-f2 > r > enter\" the keyboard stopped working.

I just wondering why Ubuntu is not developing the Ubuntu One client for Fedora even the closed source one. It will help to broaden the Ubuntu Cloud and revenue generating Ubuntu Music store by introducing the same to Fedora and other Linux distribution. Looking forward to see this happen in near future. \n\nA: Here's a Yum repo with updated UbuntuOne RPMs for Fedora\nhttp://www.maxiberta.com.ar/blog/ubuntuone-packages-fedora\n\nYum Setup\nDownload and install the .repo file into /etc/yum.repos.d/:\nwget http://www.maxiberta.com.ar/repo/fedora-ubuntuone.repo\nsudo mv fedora-ubuntuone.repo /etc/yum.repos.d/ \n\nInstall the ubuntuone-client package and all of its dependencies:\nsudo yum install ubuntuone-client \n\nUbuntuOne Client Setup\nConnect to UbuntuOne services and authenticate:\nu1sdtool --connect \n\nA popup window will appear where you can register a new user or use an existing account.\nThe Gnome Keyring will ask you to enter you passphrase in order to securely store your UbuntuOne credentials\nThe UbuntuOne Sync Daemon will run automatically every time you log in.\nThat's all! Your ~/\"Ubuntu One\" directory is now synchronized with your UbuntuOne cloud storage\n\nA: The UbuntuOne client is free software released under the GPLv3. \nI don't think that ubuntu developers will do integration work for fedora or other linux distributions, because in principle, the client can already be used. Everything else is packaging and making sure libraries are compatible. This is genuinely a fedora developer task.  See here for example for someone trying to use an older version of the client on fedora 11 (the link is from 2009). \n\nA: The closed source one? There is no closed source Ubuntu One, as far as I'm aware. The one we use in Ubuntu will run perfectly on Fedora, and any other distro, as is. Indeed, I think it should be automatically usable on any free operating system. It just needs to be packaged, and that's Fedoras job, just as packaging SPICE for Ubuntu (which is a very nice software in Fedora), is Ubuntus job.\n\nA: There may be third-party solutions for various distributions. However, your favorite distribution's solution may not be maintained well. I think interested people should push Ubuntu One developers.\nYou may help by supporting my bug report.\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntuone-client/+bug/951992\n\nA: http://www.abouthack.com/articles/linux/running-ubuntu-one-on-fedora.html\nThis article displays how to use ubuntu one on fedora.

Team, \nI'm considering installing wine - but still hesitant for security reasons. As far as I found out, malicious code could reach ~/.wine and all my personal data with my user-priviledges - but not farther than that.\nSo - would it be any safer to create a second user account on my machine and install wine there? That way, the second user would only have reading rights to my files. Is there a way to install wine totally confined to that user - so that I can't execute .exe files from my original account?\nPS - I'm running Ubuntu 11.10 64bit if that matters.\n\nA: Some ideas:\nYou can just change the owner of the wine executable to the second user and then give execute permission only to that user.\nAnother way would be to move the wine executable to some other place which is not in path of your user account and add it to the path of the other users account.\nThird way is, to remove the link in nautilus to execute .exe with wine. But this does not prevent .exe files from ever being executed with this user account.\nFourth way would be to create a .wine directory in your home folder before installing wine and then remove privileges for your user name, such that wine could never access it with your user account.\n", "Q: Which DropBox installer do I have to download for use on Lubuntu?

Delete the partitions for the other Ubuntu install and run update-grub.\nSo if you want to keep your old linux installation and get rid of the one you installed later, just boot into your old linux installation and start gparted or disk-utility (which ever you like). From there delete sda4, sda5, sda6, sda7 and sda8 i.e all the partitions you created for new installation of Ubuntu. Now open terminal and run sudo update-grub.

However, merging them will most likely only work, if they are stored physically behind each other on the disk.\n\n*invoke update-grub to make grub refresh its menu.\nBut be careful, your computer seems to boot from sda1.

I tried a VNC, FreeNX XRDP, remote X but none of them fulfils my requirements which are\n\n\n*\n\n*I can start working locally then go home and connect to the same desktop with all my applications runnung\n\n\n*\n\n*vnc : yes, NX : no, remote X : no\n\n\n*If I connect remotely I dont want my local computer show what am I doing\n\n\n*\n\n*vnc : no, NX : yes, remote X : yes\n\n\n*When connecting remotely I want the remote desktop to be resized to the same as my local\n\n\n*\n\n*vnc : no, NX : yes, remote X : yes\n\n\n*perform well\n\n\n*\n\n*vnc : no, NX : yes, remote X : no\n\n\n\nIs there any tool that has a yes for each feature? As it is shown NX does almost everything but the first requirement\n\nA: You can use the Shadow function of NX. This gives the ability to view display 0 of the remote machine. You don't mention how NX isn't fulfilling the first requirement so I'm guessing you didn't know how to desktop share.\nExample from http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=835326:\n\n/usr/NX/etc/server.cfg:\nEnableFullDesktopSharing = \"1\"\nEnableAdministratorDesktopSharing = \"1\"\nEnableDesktopSharingAuthorization = \"0\"\nEnableSystemDesktopSharingAuthorization = \"0\"\n\nWith this 4 changes look like this it worked to connect with the nx\nclient. In nxclient I choose \"shadow\" in configure-general-desktop.\n\n\nA: I suggest you set up an NX session, and then use that both remotely and locally.\nObviously, using NX to use a local session on a local machine isn't what you might call elegant, but if it let's you work how you want, then it's a win!\nYou could do the same trick with a VNC server that sets up an additional X server - so that it doesn't have to show on screen - but you'd still have the performance problems.\n\nA: You need an X session sharing over SSH. Google for it. You will have to connect even locally over SSH to get the first requirement, though. \n\nA: You can connect to your console with NX. However, that will use VNC as a backend, which probably means it won't resize properly if you have other resolutions on your other computers. \nOne possibility is to login to your NX session on the local machine. That way, you can resume the session from another machine without any difficulty. You would then create a session type for it so you would log directly into your NX client from the login screen, just as you would switch between Unity and Unity 2D, for instance. \nOf course, as a local desktop, it isn't an optimal solution for everything, but it does work. \n\nA: Try yuuguu.com.  They offer an excellent service for web conferencing and screen sharing. \n", "Q: How Can I Set the Unhide Speed of the Gnome-Classic Panel? I have installed gnome-session-fallback.

So I do:\nxmodmap -e 'keycode 66 = Control_L'\nxmodmap -e 'clear lock'\nxmodmap -e 'add Control = Control_L'\n\nWhere keycode 66 is my caps lock key.\nThe trouble is that I can't get this key to act as a control key on the other machine I connect to with synergy. \nThe strange thing is that if I plug a keyboard into the machine, and run xev, the control key there is keycode 37. When I then hit my modified control key (keycode 66 on the master) it's registering as keycode 37 on the remote machine. So according to xev, it should be picking it up as a control keypress. \nAnyone have any hints on if Synergy is doing something overly helpful for me? \n\nA: So it seems synergy and xmodmap don't play nice.

I googled around but I haven't found any solution... If there isn't such a hotkey, is it possible to suggest Nautilus' developers to implement this in future versions? I really like the \"Places\" feature, but in some occasions Tree View is more suitable to my needs.\n\nA: Try this if instead of places you prefer a tree view of your folders placed on the left panel, use this command\ngsettings set org.gnome.nautilus.window-state side-pane-view \"tree\"\n\nTo revert it back\ngsettings set org.gnome.nautilus.window-state side-pane-view \"places\"\n\nThere is no shortcut that I know of but you can create a small scrip that does that for you and bind it to a kb shortcut, if you are interested drop a comment, I'll make one for you.\n\nA: You could use a script to toggle between the commands. Here's a python script.\nCopy the following into a file\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nfrom subprocess import Popen, PIPE\n\nsetting = Popen(['gsettings', 'get', 'org.gnome.nautilus.window-state', 'side-pane-view'], stdout=PIPE).communicate()[0].rstrip()\n\nif setting == \"'places'\":\n    Popen(['gsettings', 'set', 'org.gnome.nautilus.window-state', 'side-pane-view', '\"tree\"'])\nelif setting == \"'tree'\":\n    Popen(['gsettings', 'set', 'org.gnome.nautilus.window-state', 'side-pane-view', '\"places\"'])\n\nSave it as ~/.pane-toggle.py.

I have a bunch of packages in my PPA and a reasonable knowledge on how to build Debian/Ubuntu packages, so far so good. My issue is that I don't really have an idea how to properly maintain them for different versions of Ubuntu and how to handle Ubuntu upgrades. Right now I am doing all of these things manually, which for most part simply means updating the version number in debian/changelog and reuploading them, which sounds easy enough, however when having to do that for a dozen packages, across numerous versions of Ubuntu, things can get a little tiresome and error prone.\nWhen there are small changes needed to be done to the debian/control files, debian/rules or the source things get of course even more complicated. While I can maintain those changes in git-buildpackage fine, getting constant merge conflicts in the debian/control file, due to backports having different version number then the current package, kind of throws me of the rails and makes things even more complicated.\nSo essentially: What are some best practices for building and maintaining Ubuntu packages, so that it's easy to make them available across multiple version of Ubuntu? \n\nA: Good question , as am learning packages myself and want to maintain a package for a good software project .. have you looked at the following page :\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/PackagingGuide/Complete\n", "Q: dpkg-deb: error: subprocess paste was killed by signal (Broken pipe) The Software upto date Option automatically download the upgarde for GIMP.\nbut While installing its giving me the error. how to upgrade the same \n\nReading package lists...

I don't necessarily care WHEN jsmith is logged in; I just want to cap his total time at 120 minutes during the 24 hour period 0000-2400. \nI looked at the question, \"How do I restrict my kids' computing time\" but again that focuses on WHEN the account can actually log in, not how LONG the account is allowed to remain logged in.\nThe solution needs to \"remember\" previous logins even after the user has logged out; for example if jsmith logs in for an hour in the morning, then logs out, jsmith should not be allowed to remain logged in for more than an hour in the afternoon or evening, for a total of 2 hours usage per 24-hour period. What is the easiest way to accomplish this in Ubuntu 11.04?\n\nA: If you open a terminal and type w, then you can see who are logged on and when they logged on. If they logged in more than an hour ago, then you suspend the account and log off the user.

Then you should be able to manually set your nameserver without it getting overwritten.\n", "Q: Transmission not downloading I'm using the Transmission which was shipped in 11.10.\nAll the configurations in Ubuntu 11.10 are the same as they are in my Mac OS.\nIn Ubuntu, Transmission is not downloading at all: 0 peers at all times.\nWhen booting into Mac OS, all seeds turned out to be fine (high speeds, lots of seeders).\n\nA: In the Transmission menu go to Edit â Preferences â Network. \nCheck if your port (usually 51414 by default) is open, if not go forward by units (51415,51416..) until you find an opened one, this should work.\nBe sure to disable your firewall for transmission (if you have set one).\n\nA: As I previously recommended Ktorrent I feel I should report on that.\nLately I was not satisfied with Ktorrent anymore (although I would prefer it to Transmission any day) because it seemed still rather heavy and even speed seemed too low (or maybe other settings need adjusting ? - I only adjusted the upload speed and nothing else). \nSo, I tried qBittorrent and I recommend it, for the speed and also because it is lighter than Ktorrent. (Or at least gives that impression. Looking at the task manager, they are not very different, but I find qBittorrent more responsive and better adjusted - it looks like utorrent - while Ktorrent, while being a decent program has odd features like that you cannot close the program from the taskbar icon, it has tabs that seem useless and that you cannot close - well, in fact there's a close button to the right, it took me one month to see it, and so on.) \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:hydr0g3n/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install qbittorrent\n\nThen, I tried Flush, which is lighter, while still having a lot of features and looking basically the same. It surely deserves a try.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:konishchevdmitry/flush\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install flush\n\nWhen having issues with a torrent client it is advisable to use multiple ones to test them. \nConsidering the clients with more features and settings, Deluge is one of the most used, reliable and with a lot of support (I mean wiki, faqs etc).\nAnother one that is very interesting is Tixati (here).  It has A LOT  of features for advanced users. (Don't worry, colors are customizable too :-)) \n\nA: Here are some possible answers for your question: \nFrom the transmission forums : https://forum.transmissionbt.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=7326\nFrom ubuntuforums : http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-819812.html\n\nA: You can also instal Deluge Bit torrent client. I think it is in the software centrum.  You can also find it here: \nhttp://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=deluge&searchon=names&suite=all&section=all\nDeluge is very similar with Utorrent.  If this is not working too for you there must be an onthe reason why.\n\nA: I have this problem sometimes too, it usually has to do with the port being used. I suggest going to edit -> preferences -> network and selecting chose a random port when opened. Then just restart it. \n", "Q: df -h shows incorrect free space Here is my df-h output.

Everytime I boot up, the brightness is always at zero, and I always have to set it back to my preferred setting (at maximum). How can I ensure that my brightness preference will persist after reboot?\n\nA: In the file /etc/rc.local add before line exit 0:\necho 5 > /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness\n\nWhere 5 is the brightness level from 0 to 10\n\nA: Basically you need to run\necho X > /sys/class/backlight/acpi_videoY/brightness\n\nduring the boot process after the graphics drivers have loaded with appropriate X and Y. The other answers and comments explain how to find X and Y.\n\nWhile the /etc/rc.local suggestion works, the most consistent way of doing this, in my opinion is the following:\nCreate a file, say customsetbootbrightness.conf, in /etc/init (avoid collisions with existing filenames in that directory) as root with the following contents:\ndescription \"Sets brightness after graphics device is loaded\"\n\nstart on graphics-device-added\ntask\nexec echo X > /sys/class/backlight/acpi_videoY/brightness\n\nThis way, the behaviour of the system will the same as systems without this particular quirk (of brightness being 0 at startup). In the /etc/rc.local method, there is usually a small period when the brightness remains 0.\n\nAlso, this should remove the necessity (in some systems) of having to sleep 2 before echo... - not checked though. (See http://xchamitha.blogspot.co.uk/2013/07/set-screen-brightness-when-booting.html or http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-2061712.html for example)\n\nA: You should probably check first:\nls /sys/class/backlight/ | grep 'acpi_video'\n\nSo you will get list of all possible displays and then you can experiment to find which is the display you want to modify.

(that which is in the top right of the bar), for example if I connect a usb wireless card, the network manager detects my internal wireless card and the external but it's going to automatically connect to the same networks on the two cards and I just want to disconnect from an order not to have conflicts between them, but gnome shell allows me to disable the wireless adapter, but does not work because I've tried and I am still connected. I do not understand because the shell no longer has the button that said ''off''. Is there any way to revive the ''off'' button in gnome shell or does only Unity retain that button?\noriginal\nhoy me encontrÃ© con un problema con la interfaz grÃ¡fica gnome shell y me gustarÃ­a que me ayuden a resolverlo, la duda es: Â¿como puedo desconectarme de una red inalÃ¡mbrica usando el clÃ¡sico menÃº de redes? (aquel que se encuentra en la parte superior a la derecha de la barra), por ejemplo si conecto una tarjeta inalÃ¡mbrica usb, el network manager detectarÃ¡ mi tarjeta inalÃ¡mbrica interna y tambiÃ©n el externo pero Ã©ste automÃ¡ticamente me va a conectar a la misma red con las dos tarjetas y lo que quiero es desconectarme de una para asÃ­ no tener conflictos entre ambas, el gnome shell me permite desactivar el adaptador inalÃ¡mbrico pero no sirve porque ya lo he probado y sigue conectado, lo que no entiendo porque el gnome shell ya no trae ese botÃ³n que decÃ­a ''desconectar'' .\nÂ¿Hay alguna manera de reactivar ese botÃ³n ''desconectar'' en gnome shell o solo unity mantiene ese boton?\n\nA: Yo probÃ© el mismo montaje, pero dejÃ© usar la tarjeta WLAN USB porque ahora mi tarjeta interna estÃ¡ perfectamente configurada y usando ambas me deja la conecciÃ³n mÃ¡s lenta. Te pregunto Â¿porque quieres ambas tarjetas enchufadas sin estar conectado con ambas? Si quieres conectarte a una red con una y otra red con la segunda tarjeta, deberÃ­a funcionar. Si quieres estar conectado a una red con sÃ³lo una tarjeta, mejor desenchufar la otra. Si quieres simplemente tener ambas enchufadas pero usar sÃ³lo una tarjeta a la vez, es posible desactivar la otra con el interruptor grÃ¡fico en el menÃº de conecciones internet del Gnome Shell. Ese interruptor sirve para \"desconectar\". Luego lo puedes activar con el mismo interruptor y conectarte a la misma red o a otra.\nNow in English. I've tried pretty much the same thing, but I stopped using my USB WLAN card because I've got the internal WLAN card nicely configured, and using both makes my connection slow. I have to ask, why do you want both WLAN cards connected to your computer without using both simultaneously? If you connect to one network with one card and another network with your 2nd WLAN card, it should work fine. If you want both WLAN cards connected to your computer yet only want to use one at a time, the one you don't wish to use, you can simply use the \"switch\" in the network applet in Gnome Shell. That switch can be set to \"off\" (the exact word from your Babelfish translation), but it won't say \"disconnect\". Afterwards you can re-enable the WLAN card and connect to the same network or a different one by setting that switch back to \"on\".\n", "Q: HDMI out on Asus 1215N (Optimus/Ion2) not detected I'm having trouble with my netbook. Ubuntu works fine otherwise except it won't recognize my HDMI port. I've tried Ironhide and Bumblebee project, and these do enable hardware acceleration, but not the HDMI output. If I search the net all the answers deal with audio over HDMI, but I'd be happy to get even video at 1080p.\nAs a sidenote, the VGA output works but it's not acceptable since my home TV doesn't support HD resolutions over VGA. This is why it must be HDMI.\nIdeas, suggestions, logs/configs you need?\n\nA: It is because the HDMI output is connected to the NVIDIA card, and Bumblebee can't handle those type of connection (because of virtualgl if I'm right), which is why you can't either use Flash into a browser with the nvidia, because the npviewer.bin plugin is not launched with optirun.\nI'm having the same problem with the HDMI (I also have an Asus 1215N), it is the only reason why I keep using Windows instead of Ubuntu (or another distribution).\nYou just have to wait for a solution, and I don't think Bumblebee/Ironhide is one for this problem..\nPS : If I remember right, some people report that a earlier version of Bumblebee made it work when booting Ubuntu, showing the Ubuntu SplasScreen and then dissapear with when entering into the Login part.\nSorry for that :S\nJust one question, nothing to do with you question, Is Ubuntu fast for you? and if Yes, which version of Ubuntu and wath Desktop (gnome3, unity-3d, unity-2d..).\n\nA: I have a Asus U30 (with Optimus) and HDMI works fine. I think it won't detect HDMI, but you can try Jupiter applet (click in applet -> Video Displays -> Enable Both).\nBTW, in my system, i can only connect HDMI after setting both displays (if i connect HDMI and then enable both displays, i got a kernel panic :)).\nHope it helps.\n", "Q: How to re-install Software Center? I've had a problem with Software Center for a few weeks, where it has just refused to delete a removed PPA from its \"All Software\" and \"Installed Software\" drop-down menus. I've tried many suggested solutions, none have worked, so I've finally decided to re-install Software Center if its possible. How do you do this and is it risky to your computer (i.e. will re-installing it cause all sorts of issues)?\n\nA: You can reinstall the Software Center with a fresh start to all its systemwide configuration files by issuing this command in the Terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T):\nsudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get --purge --reinstall install software-center software-properties-common software-properties-gtk\n\n(You can copy that whole thing to the clipboard, paste it into the Terminal, and press enter. If you enter it manually--which I recommend against--then please take note to only press enter at the end; there is no line break in the middle, it's just too long to be displayed on one line.)\nThat command is written so that it also completely reinstalls the packages that provide the Software Sources window, which is at least as likely to be responsible for any problems relating to disabling a PPA as is the Software Center itself.\n", "Q: xmodmap is not working properly on resume Since upgrading to 11.10, xmodmap seems to be working nowhere near as well.

This was not always the case -- it just started happening to me some day, so my best guess is that it was due to some sort of software update.\nNevertheless, it is extremely irritating. I found this thread, which suggests that you can add a script /etc/acpi/resume.d/50-xmodmap.sh that runs on wakeup to invoke xmodmap.\nThough someone else suggested that this bug may not get fixed and that you may be forced to use the GUI. Because my desired remapping is pretty simple (I just want to remap Caps Lock to Control), that's what I did. This was actually tricky to find, as I had to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find the Keyboard GUI app\n\n*Choose the Layouts tab\n\n*Click the Options button\n\n*Expand the \"Ctrl key position\" header because the desired option was not under \"Caps Lock key behavior\"\n\n*Check the \"Make Caps Lock an additional Ctrl\" box\n\n\nAdmittedly, if you're a long-time .Xmodmap user, this is pretty annoying, but it's better than running xmodmap manually every time you log in.\n\nA: You need to change the name of your xmodmap file to ~/.Xmodmap\nThat's the name of the file which Ubuntu looks for which gets processed by xmodmap each time you start an X session.\n\nA: It seems xmodmap support is being phased out:\n\nxmodmap support has been dropped in GNOME3 which deprecate that bug report, closing it\n\n(from Bug #289781 on xserver-xorg-input-evdev)\nThe graphical configuration Tweak tool might offer the settings you need.

Then you can hover over the tray icon and use the mouse-wheel to change backgrounds.\nShould work in Unity. Not sure if it works in Gnome 3\n", "Q: How to specifiy prompt location in terminal? I am using GNOME 3.2 and my problem is that while working on terminal my prompt is usually at the bottom of screen. As GNOME notifications keep popping up on new mail, chat or song change, it becomes hard to work at the lowest line of terminal.\nIs there any way I can set prompt location few lines above the last line in the Terminal, so that I don't have to run clear every time?\n\nA: Rather than attempt to prevent some number of lines near the bottom of the Terminal window from being used, you might want to instead simply resize the Terminal window to whatever best serves your needs. You can put your mouse pointer over the lower-right corner of the Terminal window (or, really, over anywhere on the lower edge) until the mouse pointer changes to a different icon representing resizing. Then click and hold, and drag the border upwards until the window is however small you want it.\nTo make it so that all Terminals will be of a custom height (and, if you like, width) when you start them, go to Edit > Profile Preferences in Terminal. A window with the title Editing Profile \"Default\" will come up (or it will give a different profile name, if you're using a named custom profile). In the General tab (which should already be showing), check the box labeled Use custom default terminal size. Then you can decrease the number of rows from 24 to whatever you like.\nIf your Terminal window is maximized, so that it takes up the whole screen and cannot be resized, then you should restore it to normal size (using the buttons on the window decorator, i.e., on the bar at the top of the window). Then you can either move it to a different location on the screen so that it is more convenient, or resize it as described above.\n\nA: I use text editors a lot so want my terminal to be full screen height but I also don't want the prompt at the bottom.\nI recently figured out an approach using the terminal's support for a character that goes \"up\" and bash's support to run a command before printing the primary prompt. I hope it works for other people. You'd put the following in your .bash_profile (merging with other code you have setting the prompt (PS1) ).\nfunction proml {\nlocal UP=\"\\033[F\"\nlocal CL=\"\\033[0J\"\nPS1=\"\\$ \"\nexport PROMPT_COMMAND_SPACE=\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$UP$UP$UP$UP$UP$UP$UP$UP$UP$UP$UP$CL\"\nPROMPT_COMMAND=\"echo -ne \\\"$PROMPT_COMMAND_SPACE\\\"\"\n}\nproml\n\nPut N newlines (\\n) and N $UP variables to get N blank lines at the bottom.\nAnd then keep this stuff in your .bashrc or .bash_profile.\n\nA: You could try using guake, at least as a work-around.  It has an option, \"Main Window Height\" which allows you to vertically adjust how much screen is utilized.  This way you can prevent the prompt from ever being under your notifications.

I created a partition for Ubuntu so I could dual-boot Windows Vista with it. However, Windows is no longer necessary and I want Ubuntu to take up the entire hard drive. I was wondering how to safely resize the Ubuntu (11.10) partition and take Windows out all together, without having to reinstall Ubuntu and lose all of the files. \n\nA: First, you should be aware that whenever doing dynamic partition resizing, there is a small chance of data loss. So you should make sure that all your documents and any other important files (e.g., music, videos, ebooks) are backed up first. And of course, you should make sure to copy/move any documents and other important files out of your Windows partition, too, as they will be lost when you remove that partition.\nIt is not safe to edit a physical disk's partition table from within an operating system that is running from a partition on that same physical disk. So rather than removing the Windows partition while booted into the installed Ubuntu system, you should boot from the Ubuntu live CD. Select Try Ubuntu rather than Install Ubuntu.\nThen run the GParted Partition Editor (search for gparted in the dash and click the search result to run it). Remove your Windows partition (its partition type is NTFS). Then expand your Ubuntu partition to fill up the remaining space on the drive. If there is an extended partition (which is a kind of container for other partitions, to allow you to have more than four partitions on a disk with a traditional \"msdos\" partition table) and the Windows partition was outside of it, then you may need to expand the extended partition in order to expand the Ubuntu partition within it.\nApply your changes in GParted and reboot the system. You're unable to boot back into the Ubuntu system installed on the hard drive, then reinstall the GRUB2 boot loader to the Master Boot Record by using any of the techniques detailed here.\n", "Q: How to pin Eclipse to the Unity launcher? How can I pin eclipse indigo 3.7 I have 'installed' at /opt/ to the taskbar?\nI have tried launching eclipse and right-clicking to choose the 'keep in launcher' option. But when I click that icon, after closing eclipse, it doesn't start eclipse.\nI have already looked at How do I add Eclipse Indigo to the launcher? but no answer worked for me. (Mod note: The answers from this thread are now merged into this one)\n\nA: For Ubuntu 11.10, 12.04, 12.10\nIf the applications folder does not exist inside ~/.local/share/ create it\nmkdir ~/.local/share/applications\n\nCheck if your installation left you with a workable .desktop file for Eclipse and copy it if exists\ncp /usr/share/applications/eclipse.desktop ~/.local/share/applications/\n\n\nIf the file does not exist create a .desktop file for Eclipse in your ~/.local/share/applications/ folder using gnome-desktop-item-edit, ie:\ngnome-desktop-item-edit --create-new ~/.local/share/applications/\n\nOn the name set it to Eclipse, on the command enter the path to the binary file of Eclipse, insert a comment if you want and click the icon to select the icon that you desire for Eclipse.\nPress ok when you are finished.\n\nAfter copying the file or creating your own open that folder location\nnautilus ~/.local/share/applications/\n\nLocate the file you just created and drag it to the launcher\n\n\nA: If you have donwloaded Eclipse from the website instead of install it from repositories you can lock the launcher doesn't work.\nYou can solve this by writting the file with extension .desktop, in our case eclipse.desktop.\n [Desktop Entry]\n Name=Eclipse\n Comment=Eclipse\n Exec=/path/eclipse\n Icon=/path/icon.xpm\n Terminal=false\n Type=Application\n\nWhere /path is where you've installed eclipse. After you have saved it, you have to give execution permission:\n$ chmod +x eclipse.desktop\n\nThen you execute it with Nautilus and by clicking (right click) over the laucher you can lock to the launcher. And you can launch the app correctly.\n\nA: For 11.10 and newer\nFirst, create a .desktop file to eclipse:\ngedit ~/.local/share/applications/opt_eclipse.desktop\n\nThen, paste this inside (dont forget to edit Exec  and Icon values):\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nName=Eclipse\nComment=Eclipse Integrated Development Environment\nIcon=** something like /opt/eclipse/icon.xpm **\nExec= ** something like /opt/eclipse/eclipse **\nTerminal=false\nCategories=Development;IDE;Java;\nStartupWMClass=Eclipse\n\nAfter that, open that folder with nautilus:\nnautilus ~/.local/share/applications\n\nIf you want to use this launcher outside dash/launcher (ex: as a desktop launcher) you need to add execution permission by right clicking the file and choosing Properties -> Permissions -> Allow execution, \nor, via the command-line:\nchmod +x ~/.local/share/applications/opt_eclipse.desktop\n\nFinally drop opt_eclipse.desktop to launcher.\n\nA: I think this is a cleaner version:\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nName=Eclipse\nComment=Eclipse Integrated Development Environment\nIcon=eclipse\nExec=eclipse\nTerminal=false\nCategories=Development;IDE;Java;\n\nYou should add this to /usr/local/share/applications/eclipse.desktop and symlink eclipse on /usr/bin. \nYou might want to change the icon path if your theme doesn't have a eclipse button (ex. ambiance/radiance).\nIf I'm not mistaken this is the file that comes with galileo from the repos (wich I removed), and I've been using it with Helios and now Indigo.\n\nA: 18.04\nClick Show Applications, find Eclipse in the list, right click & Add to Favourites.\n\nA: 11.04\nIf user21580's answer doesn't work (great suggestion, but I think it didn't work for me when I installed Indigo), you can try adding an eclipse.desktop file to ~/.local/share/applications/, with these contents:\n#!/usr/bin/env xdg-open\n\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nType=Application\nTerminal=false\nStartupNotify=true\nIcon=<path-to-eclipse-install>/icon.xpm\nName=Eclipse Indigo 3.7\n#Exec=env UBUNTU_MENUPROXY=0 <path-to-eclipse-install>/eclipse\nExec=env <path-to-eclipse-install>/eclipse\n\nIf you experience bugs, you can try the Exec line which is commented out instead of the current one.\nReferences: \n\n\n*\n\n*How can I edit/create new launcher items in Unity by hand?\n\nA: Let me show you how to create a custom launcher and pin it to the Launcher.\n1) First, install gnome-panel:\nsudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends gnome-panel\n\n2) To create a new desktop shortcut run the following command either in the terminal or using Alt-F2:\ngnome-desktop-item-edit --create-new ~/Desktop\n\nA window will pop up, submit your shortcut details and click OK:\n\nYour shortcut will now appear on your desktop.\nThen drag your new shortcut from Desktop to your Launcher.\nThat's it!\n\nA: For 12.04\nI prefer to install from repository.  This just works for me and I document the Graphical way to do it here.\nIf you must install the portable version(getting the tar.gz from the eclipse website) here's the best way I've found to get portable working and locked to the Launcher.\nDownload the eclipse portable and extract to your Desktop.  In a terminal:\nsudo apt-get install eclipse-platform\nsudo mv Desktop/eclipse /opt/eclipse\n/opt/eclipse/eclipse\n\nRight click the icon in the launcher bar and pin to bar.  I can verify that it's portable and not the platform because I have LOADS of plug-ins installed which don't appear when launched this way.\nYou may find that creating a .desktop file works, but that you run into mysterious behaviour if you have more than one portable instance installed.\n\nA: Try\nExec=/bin/bash /home/USERNAME/eclipse/eclipse\n\nor make /home/USERNAME/eclipse/eclipse executable \nsudo chmod u+x /home/USERNAME/eclipse/eclipse\n\nand use:\nExec=/home/USERNAME/eclipse/eclipse\n\n\nA: Make sure if you're using the 32bit version on a 64bit machine, you install the 32bit libraries (ia32libs-multiarch i think is the package in Precise).\nAlternatively, if you're trying to run 64bit Eclipse on a 32bit machine, you need to download the 32bit version instead.\n\nA: I have tested it for Eclipse MARs(not the installation one)-but the one which is tar.gz package on Ubuntu Desktop 14.0.4\ngedit /usr/share/applications/eclipse.desktop\n\ncontents for this:\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nName=Eclipse\nComment=Eclipse Integrated Development Environment\nIcon=** something like /opt/eclipse/icon.xpm **\nExec= ** something like /opt/eclipse/eclipse **\nTerminal=false\nCategories=Development;IDE;Java;\nStartupWMClass=Eclipse\n\nThen in the finder search for Eclipse when the menu comes up - just drag it to the launcher\nand then it will start working. Very simple steps and nothing complicated to get it up and running.\n\nA: If not using a *.deb file, your software is not included in menus or the launcher.\nThe easy way:\nJust start Eclipse from /opt and look for an icon appear in Unity launcher (the sidebar). Right click and check \"Keep in launcher\".\n\nA: Atem18 is correct. Do this if you want your launchers to be available system wide.   This is how I automated creating launchers. This assumes you have already installed gnome-panel.\n\n\n*\n\n*open terminal\n\n*mkdir ~/bin or right click on your home file browser and make folder bin.\n\n*source .profile or logout and login\n\n*gedit in terminal or from dash\n#!/bin/sh \nsudo gnome-desktop-item-edit /usr/share/applications/ --create-new\n\nDon't use the hyphens/bullets and no need to indent.\n\n*Give it a name with no spaces save to your new bin directory and then make executable (chmod a+x launcher-script) or right click goto properties> Permissions and click the execute box.\n\n*now in terminal: sudo gnome-desktop-item-edit /usr/share/applications/ --create-new\n\n*You should have the Create Launcher gui open.\nType = Application in Terminal THIS ONLY APPLIES THIS TIME. Most of the time it will be Application after this.\n\n*You can name what you wish. NO-SPACES-ALLOWED I called mine Create-Launcher\n\n*In the command field put the path to the script from step 3: /home/mike/bin/launcher-script Use your user name and the actual file name you created.\n\n*Click the spring to add an icon. I made on on the Gimp but there are lots of icons you could use that are very generic and already installed. Click the spring and it will take you to some.\n\n*Once you're finished click ok. Now you can navigate your file browser down to /usr/share/applications and you will find your new launcher. Simply drag it to your launcher bar and you are ready to go. This process puts your launchers in a place where all users can access them. Most of what I have found puts thing on the desktop which might be fine for some but not for me. I hope you find this helpful.\nNow you can easily create your eclipse launcher and any others too.\nAfter thought, every time you create a new launcher you will have to enter your password. This is necessary to make the new launcher accessible to all users. It will belong to root and the group will be root this way. That is the way the rest of the system comes configured. If you cd to /usr/share/applications, type ls -l and, verify for yourself. Ubuntu should have supplied their os with an application already installed for creating launchers. There are other things I disagree with like the screensaver and no short cut to the desktop. I have only been on 11.10 for a couple days. I am going to give it the college try. If I still don't like it in a month I will fix it then.\n\nA: For Ubuntu 11.10\nDownload gnome-panel from the Ubuntu Software Center if not already installed.\nRun the Gnome \"Create Launcher\" from the terminal like so:\ngnome-desktop-item-edit --create-new ~/.local/share/applications/\n\nA dialog box will appear.\n\n\n*\n\n*For Name: you'll probably want to name it \"Eclipse\".  \n\n*For Command: browse to where the Eclipse executable is located.  \n\n*For Comment: something like \"Eclipse IDE\" should do.  \n\n*For the icon, click the springboard icon, then navigate to the folder where the executable is located and select icon.xpm.  \n\n*Click Okay.  You've now made the launcher icon.  All that's left is to put it in the launcher bar.\n\n*Open the folder ~/.local/share/applications/ .  You may need to hit ctrl-h to show the hidden .local folder.  \n\n*Drag the Eclipse launcher icon you just made onto the launcher.\n\n\nDone!\n\nA: In the exec line put the executable (eclipse) directly. Don't try to add special characters to space, i.e., if your eclipse is in the /home/username/My Dev Programs/Eclipse/eclipse put the entire line with the spaces on the exec line. Here is a my eclipse.desktop file:\n#!/usr/bin/env xdg-open\n\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nType=Application\nTerminal=false\nIcon=/home/marcos/Imagens/Icons/Eclipse Icon 128.png\nName=Eclipse\nExec=/home/marcos/Dev Software/eclipse/eclipse\nComment=Eclipse IDE\nName=Eclipse\nComment=Eclipse IDE\n\n\nA: Use this:\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=4.2\nName=Eclipse\nComment=Java IDE\nExec=/home/USERNAME/eclipse/eclipse\nType=Application\nIcon=/home/USERNAME/eclipse/icon.png\nTerminal=false\nNoDisplay=false\nCategories=Development;IDE\n\nIt works for me.\n", "Q: Nvidia Graphics Card and 4 monitors Hi I am using a Nvidia Quadro NVs 420 on a HP desktop.

I just installed the Gnome Tweak Tool in order to change my icon theme to Faenza, but it seems to have installed some other program named Caribou, which I think is an onscreen keyboard program, with it. This is absolutely useless for me, and frankly, I hate the fact that it was installed silently and without my permission. When I go to uninstall it, it says that it's part of gnome-shell and requires the un-installation of that as well. What do I do?\n\nA: You can uninstall Caribou (which provides an on-screen keyboard), or (as JoZ3 has suggested) you can keep it installed but prevent it from starting up automatically (i.e., \"disable\" it). The latter may be preferable in that you can still run the program should you find you have use for it (without reinstalling it).\nTo uninstall Caribou, you can find the package called caribou in the Software Center and remove it. Make sure to heed any warnings about other packages that would have to be removed along with it...though for caribou, this is unlikely to be a problem. If there are packages that the Software Center indicates will be removed automatically when you remove Caribou, and you're not sure whether or not going through with removing Caribou would cause problems, then please post the list of packages here. In case this puts it in a more convenient form, you should be aware that you can get this information in the Terminal by running apt-get -s remove caribou. (The absence of a leading sudo is intentional.)\nTo disable Caribou from starting up automatically when you log in, for all users, remove the entry for caribou.desktop in the file /etc/xdg/autostart. Since that file is owned by root, you must edit it as root. One way to do that is to press Alt+F2 and run the command:\ngksu gedit /etc/xdg/autostart\n(This is from this forum thread, found by JoZ3.)\nYou might want to back up the file first, before editing it, in case you make a mistake. To do that, open a Terminal window with Ctrl+Alt+T and run the command:\nsudo cp /etc/xdg/autostart /etc/xdg/autostart.old\n\nA: You can't uninstall, but you can disable check the link how to disable caribou in ubuntu 11.10\n\nA: In Ubuntu 12.04 you can do this:\napplications>system tools>preferences>applications at start\nIn the opening window uncheck caribou and close it. You can also uninstall it there if you want.\n\nA: On Ubuntu 18.04, the accepted answer is not applicable because /etc/xdg/autostart is a directory with nothing in it that sounds like caribou.\nHowever, there is a gnome shell extension in the Ubuntu Store called \"Block Caribou\" with good reviews.\n", "Q: Login slow after changing settings - how to reset.

This is a rather delicate command and should be used only when truly necessary.\nIf you were using dconf-editor then there is an option to reset to default. Again, use this with caution, because what dconf-editorconsiders default settings may not necessarily be Ubuntu's default settings.\nIf you were editing a particular application's settings, you can remove it along with all its config files using the command:\nsudo apt-get --purge remove NAME-OF-APP\n\nOverall, you're best bet is to simply remember exactly what you were tweaking, and reverse only those changes. \n", "Q: How do I sync apps from two computers I have a computer with Ubuntu 11.10 at School and now my Laptop I typically use only at home that I just installed Ubuntu 11.10 on to it.

The destination or source first?\n\nA: For copy folder via terminal, you can use:\ncp -a /source/. /dest/\n\nThe -a option is an improved recursive option. It preserves all file attributes and also preserves symlinks.\nThe . at the end of the source path is a specific cp syntax that allows copying all files and folders, including hidden ones.\nAn alternative is rsync:\nrsync -r source/ destination\n\n\nA: If you want to copy directory please use below command:  \nsudo cp -R Source_Folder Destination_Folder\n\nThis command can also be used to copy files, by just removing the \"-R\" which is used to copy the recursive structure of internal folders (if there are any in the Source_Folder path that we mentioned.)  \nOne more example:\nsudo cp -R /var/www/* /home/test_user/\n\nPlease feel free to leave a comment in case of any issue.\n\nA: The -a flag is probably what you are looking for:\ncp -a /path/from /path/to\n\nThe -a flag turns on recursive behaviour (which can also be done with the -R flag), and will also attempt to preserve metadata such as file ownership, permissions, timestamps, links, etc.\nYou should only need to use sudo if you are copying to a location not owned by the current user, if the current user doesn't have read permissions for the files being copied, or if you want to preserve ownership on files not owned by the current user.\n\nA: I think the better way is to use gksu nautilus command and you can copy whatever you want with common GUI as usual. \n", "Q: Start a tmuxinator session in gnome-terminal on login I'd like to start a tmuxinator session when I login (Gnome on Ubuntu Lucid).

Tried to boot windows XP and disk says its corrupt.  \n\nA: Uninstalling Ubuntu is a complex process. But you can simply remove it from your system without any harm in following case. Try this, but be cautious.\nRead my blog entry at WordPress for advanced options. Also given below, but still you can refer the other.\nLogin to your Windows XP. Windows's boot loader is named as Master Boot Record or MBR. While installing Ubuntu after Windows, this MBR will be replaced by Linux Grub. When you remove Ubuntu, Windows has no boot loaders and boot will failure. So what you need to do is to restore MBR. Well, it is not so complicated process with EasyBCD software. You can download it from here. Download and install this software into your machine.\nNow open your device manager. From there you need to open disk management window. Wait for few seconds since it requires some time to display disk information. Now you can see your disk's partitions. NTFS refers to Windows and Ext refers to Linux. Simply select on Linux partition and right click on it. Now choose delete partition. Be sure you are selecting and deleting linux partition only. Now your Ubuntu is away from your system. Things are not so ready yet. You need to change this volume into Windows' drive to use it in Windows. Again right click on it and select New simple volume. Follow on screen dialogues and create the new partition.\nNow open EasyBCD software. You can see an option BootLoader and choose Install Windows XP boot loader to MBR under MBR options. You are done with. Now close everything and reboot your system. \nYou can refer EasyBCD's working in this site\n", "Q: What's the difference between cat /etc/group and cat /etc/group- \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhat's the difference between the âgroupâ and âgroup-â file? \n\nI just changed a group name and noticed that\ncat /etc/group\n\nIncludes the updated group name, but\ncat /etc/group-\n\nincludes the old group name.

Gnome 3 doesn't yet support the X-Ayatana-Desktop-Shortcuts tag in .desktop files (though I'm planning to write a gnome-shell-extension over the weekend to rectify this). I'll update this answer with the relevant link on Monday. You'll have your quicklist functionality then.\nAlthough I must say it's a feature which should already have been released to the community by canonical, since it's such a simple extension.

When I was using Maverick, it was possible to switch the input method from a UIM indicator applet. Now that I have upgraded to Oneiric, I can't seem to switch the input method even when I open uim-im-switcher-gtk. This is necessary for me because I need to be able to switch back and forth between English and Tibetan and the keyboard shortcuts don't seem to work until after I've changed the input method from the panel first. Is there some way to get a UIM indicator on the Unity panel? This is a major regression for me and makes it impossible to do certain kinds of work in Ubuntu.\n\nA: There is an indicator in oneiric, but it is part of the \"application-indicator\", and pulls settings from gnome-settings-daemon.\nSo, to enable it, add the input method via System Settings->Keyboard Layout, which is the gnome-settings-daemon config tool for this purpose.  You'll get an indicator in the Unity launcher (but not the greeter) with a dropdown of configured input methods.  Also, in that settings module, there is an \"Options\" button that brings you to a number of settings, including the keybinding for changing layout.\nI just checked there there is a Tibetan layout available, and that it works.  At least, it looks like it works to someone who can't read Tibetan.  ;-)\n\nA: So I figured out how to get UIM in the Unity panel for anyone who wants to do it. First, if you haven't already, install dconf editor. Open it and go to desktop > gnome > unity > panel. In the systray-whitelist \"Value\" field, add a new item 'uim-toolbar-gtk-systray' between apostrophes. My systray-whitelist looks like this: ['JavaEmbeddedFrame', 'Wine', 'scp-dbus-service', 'Update-notifier', 'uim-toolbar-gtk-systray']. Now restart Unity by logging out and logging back in. Enter the command: uim-toolbar-gtk-systray. You should also add this same command to your Startup Applications.\nIn my dark panel, the UIM menu looks like rubbish. For some reason it's all squished into one small area and the background is light. But at least it works.\n\nA: In Natty, Ubuntu switched over to using \"indicators\" and got rid of the systray.  You would have to go into the dconf-editor (as James states) to add things to the whitelist.  Now, in Oneiric, there is a package called sni-qt that turns all systray icons into indicator icons, for use with unity.  It is installed by default on a fresh install, but apparently not in an upgrade.\nIf you have UIM (or any other systray app) installed but can't see the icon, installing the sni-qt package and logging out/in again will generally give you the icon in the unity panel.\n", "Q: Need to reconfigure absolute position of dual monitors after reboot, how do I fix that? I have two monitors, one is DELL P2411H 24â and the other is BenQ FP91G+ 19\". All the times when I restart the PC I have to reconfigure the absolute position. How can I fix that? \n\nA: I fixed this by editing the monitors.xml file in your .config folder. You can see a more detailed description with example here...Ubuntu 11.10 dual monitor set up instructions\nBut briefly you can try this:\n\n*\n\n*Open up a terminal (ctrl+alt+t)\n\n*Go to your config folder (cd ~/.config)\n\n*Open up your file for editing (gedit monitors.xml)\n\n*Your 2 monitors will be listed here, find the monitor on the left, it will have the values of <x>0<x> and <y>0<y>.\n\n*These values are measured in pixels, position the other monitor in relation to this using the x and y values. The current values you see here will be values that represent the incorrect set up when you log in - you can use them as a reference point.\n\nThis will hopefully fix it for you too.\n\nA: I have a solution that works in my case:\n\n\n*\n\n*I configure with ATI driver application\n\n\n\n*boot\n\n*and configure it again but with Screen display default application and of course click on button to keep the new setting\n\n\nIt is only after doing it twice, with AMD app. and default app. that my settings stay.\nNote that I add the pictures of icon because I m not sure of the name of the application in english, most of the time a good picture is better than a good explication.\nAND you better check the content of your ~/.config/monitors.xml file after that to avoid to get several configurations saved in this file.\n\nA: See instructions for how to configure lightdm to run a script before the login screen appears and/or desktop session starts here and here.\nOne improvement that you could do over the previously mentioned instructions is to change the script so that the xrandr command is executed only when your external monitor is connected (in case you have an external monitor attached to a laptop). Mine looks something like this:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nxrandr -q | grep \"HDMI1 connected\" && xrandr --output LVDS1 --auto --pos 1920x0 --output HDMI1 --auto --pos 0x0 --primary\n\nThe command after the && is executed only if the HDMI cable is plugged in.\n\nA: xrandr does the trick perfeclty !\n\nsudo apt-get install xrandr\nxrandr\n\nHow to change monitor position/navigation?\n", "Q: How to remove a user from a group? I added a user account to the admin group and discovered I added wrong user. So I now have to remove the account from the admin group. \nHow can I remove an account from a group without deleting the user?\n\nA: You can do this:\nsudo gpasswd -d username group\n\nSee: http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/focal/en/man1/gpasswd.1.html\n\n-d, --delete user\nRemove the user from the named group.\n\n\nA: The easiest and safest way:\nsudo -H gedit /etc/group\n\nand delete it manually.\n\nA: Portablejim's answer is accurate but dangerous -- if you typo something, your system may be unusable, especially if you alter the admin group improperly.  If you must edit the groups file, use the vipw -g or vigr commands, which verify the syntax before saving.  Even then, there are better ways.\nFrom a commandline, the one you probably want to use is the following (as root):\ndeluser <username> <groupname>\n\nThis will remove the specified user from the specified group. You must relogin to see the effect. It will not delete the user, or the group, just the membership.  There are also ways of doing it with the usermod command, but it's harder to use as you need to replace the entire list of groups for a user in order to remove a single group.  The gpasswd command is also capable of doing this (as sagarchalise points out), but is mostly deprecated. As always, see the man pages for more details.\n\nA: See zanfur's answer.\nEdit the /etc/group file as root (i.e. gksudo gedit /etc/group) and remove the username from the line that starts with 'admin'\ni.e.\n...\nadmin:x:120:adminuser,adminuser2,userthatshouldnotbeadmin\n...\n\nbecomes\n...\nadmin:x:120:adminuser,adminuser2\n...\n\nBe warned, typos within the file could break your system.\n", "Q: 525 m nvidia grapic card is not work in Linux \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow well do laptops with Nvidia Optimus work? \n\ni have dell dell inspiron 15r and company give the windows 7 64 bit os. i have 1GB 525m nvidia  graphic card which work in windows very well but when i install the ubuntu 10.10 then graphic card is not work.\nubuntu 10.10 give that message that i have nvidia graphic card  which not active you want to active. when i say ok then its download driver from the net and then install it when restart computer then graphic terminal is not working other terminal is work well. i have not idea why that happen plz help me ?\n\nA: I recommend to download and install the driver from nvidia directly.

As fa as I know the root users can read and modify everything. My question is how can I protect this data. I don't want to give access to the root users to this folder/file.\n\nA: In a Linux (or any Unix) system the root user has the ultimate power to do anything.  There is no way to limit the root users ability to view, modify and execute any file or folder. This is more or less the point of the root user.\nIf you want to protect this folder/file the only thing I can suggest is encrypt it.\nTruecrypt is one option.

I partitioned my HD so that I have 8GB swap.\nWhen streaming online or opening several tabs in Chromium I soon have 4GB Memory in the cache. And I think this makes my Notebook slow. When streaming a video, after a few minutes it really slows down and stumbles/jerks.\nWhat could the problem be? How can I solve this?\nP.S: initially I had 4GB and recently upgraded to 6GB, but I did not experience a significant change.\nP.P.S: free -g in the terminal prints this:\n               total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\nMem:             5          2          3          0          0          0\n-/+ buffers/cache:          1          4\nSwap:            8          0          8\n\n\nA: Caching data is RAM is supposed to make things faster, not slower - fetching things repeatedly from disk when you have unused memory is just silly. If you're spilling into swap space though, that will hit performance. You can easily tell if you're using any swap by running System Monitor. If the swap-space graph isn't climbing at the time the problem starts, then the problem isn't memory related.\nCertainly, when you stream video it will get cached in memory, but it takes quite a lot of video to fill 6Gb! I'd expect it to take more than just a few minutes to download that much data, and much more to cause a problem!\nAre you sure something else isn't the problem? Say, cooling perhaps? Many notebooks have processors that are overspeced compared to the cooling system. This is good - it gives high peak performance, good for bursty traffic, while keeping the bulk down - but it can't keep up the performance for long before it is forced to dial back the clock rate or melt. Video can be fairly processor intensive, so you never know?\nAnyway, you should be able to see from the memory usage whether it's swapping or not. If it is, then that's a software problem, and those can be fixed. :)\n\nA: I've the same problem, it seems the cache is never released...\nOne example was when I checked out a repository and end up with a cache of 4GB\nExample:\n$ free -m\n             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\nMem:          7949       7425        523          0        112       4433\n-/+ buffers/cache:       2879       5069\nSwap:         7627          2       7625\n\nWhat I did was to run the code bellow (the comments are just so you know what is going on), you may create a script so you can run it when you need it:\n# To free pagecache:\n#         echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches\n# To free dentries and inodes:\n#         echo 2 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches\n# To free pagecache, dentries and inodes:\n#         echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches\nsudo sync && sudo sysctl -w vm.drop_caches=3\n\nAfter I ran the code above:\n$ free -m\n             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\nMem:          7949       2820       5129          0          2        407\n-/+ buffers/cache:       2409       5539\nSwap:         7627          2       7625\n\n\nA: My suggestion would be to run any process explorer (System Monitor for example) and check what is the process consuming so much memory. post it here and we'll see if you can turn it off.\nps. ok, I get it now. I bet its 'plugin container' that grows with time due to the way it uses memory. I guess its because its a port from Gill Bates system;).

As I posted earlier, Gnome 3 does not currently have any ability to assign actions/functions to mouse buttons. But there is a way to make it work using xdotool and xbindkeys. Thanks to AlphaLux (see comment below) I was able to replace my earlier easystroke solution with xbindkeys.\nThereâs also a program called easystroke that employs mouse gestures for executing shortcuts. The only reason I know this is because someone smarter than myself described the solution on the Ubuntu Forums. So, to âstinkeyeâ of the magical land of âWoop Woopâ, I bequeath a laurel . . . and hearty handshake for answering this question about keyboard and mouse shortcuts in Gnome 3. Though I am including two solutions below, I recommend the xbindkeys solution.\nFirst, descriptions of what  xdotool, xbindkeys and easystroke do:\n\nxdotool\n\nThis tool is invisible. You will not directly use it. But it will give you the ability to compose a commandline instruction for telling your computer that a button or group of buttons have been pressed. There is more to it than that, but for our purposes thatâs all that matters.\n\nxbindkeys\n\nThis tool allows you to use bind keyboard and mouse keys to shell commands.\n\neasystroke\n\nThis tool allows you to use âmouse gesturesâ to submit commands to your computer. Mouse gestures are akin to the âtouch gesturesâ that are an important part of newer touch interface computer systems like Appleâs iOS and even OSX via their ever-growing touchpads as well as Android, Windows Phone 7, etc. etc. The instructions below will be using this program to merely press a mouse button. I wonât be talking about gestures today.\nMaking a Mouse Button Make Things Happen with xbindkeys\nAs described above my only motivation for this functionality is to summon the Gnome Shell Overview. The directions below will describe how to do that. Feel free to substitute your own functionality as you see fit. Hopefully the instructions will be written in a clear enough way as to make that easy to do.\n\n*\n\n*AssignKeyboard Input to the Desired Functionality\n\nSystem Settings > Keyboard > Shortcuts\nIn my case I set Show the activities overview to the Menu key, because I use the Super/Windows key for Third- and Fourth-level switching.\n\n\n*Install xdotool and xbindkeys\n\nYouâll have to figure out the best/easiest way to do this for your flavor of Linux. If you are running Ubuntu you can install them via the Software Center or:\nsudo apt-get install xbindkeys xdotool\n\n\n\n*Determine Mouse Button Identity with xev\n\nOpen a terminal and enter this command\nxev\n\nXev will create a small, empty window. Hover your mouse over this window and click the various buttons on your mouse. After you click xev will tell you the identity of that button. Now that you know their identities we can use xbindkeys to associate them with shell commands.\n\n\n*Configure xbindkeys\n\nOpen a terminal and enter this command:\ngedit ~/.xbindkeysrc\n\nand press Enter. This will open the xbindkeys configuration file in Gedit. It should be a blank file. Add the following to the document and save.\n# Gnome Shell Mouse Button 8 to Overview\n\"xdotool key Menu\"\nrelease + b:8\n\nThe above configuration sets the mouse button 8 to activate the Gnome Shell Overview. The first line is a comment to help you remember what this setting does. The second line defines the shell command to be enacted within double quotes. The third line defines the button action, in this case upon the release of the mouse button 8 the command will be executed.\n\n\n*Set xbindkeys to autostart on login\n\nFrom the Gnome Shell Overview > Applications list, look for âStartup Applicationsâ and start it. After the application window appears click the Addbutton. You can title the entry whatever you want, but âxbindkeysâ is nice and concise. Most importantly though, enter the following into the Command input:\nxbindkeys &\n\nOnce correctly entered, click OK and then Close. Now xbindkeys will automatically start upon logging in.\nMaking a Mouse Button Make Things Happen with easystroke\n\n*\n\n*Install xdotool and easystroke\n\nYouâll have to figure out the best/easiest way to do this for your flavor of Linux. If you are running Ubuntu you can install them via the Software Center or:\nsudo apt-get install easystroke xdotool\n\n\n\n*Easystroke Preferences\n\nStart Easystroke. Go to the Preferences tab. Under the Behavior section, click the Gesture Button button. Move your cursor to the empty gray space in the resulting window and click the mouse button that you would like to associate to activating the Gnome Shell Activities Overlay (or whatever you are trying to do at the click of a mouse button). Once you click you should see a change in the settings at the bottom of the small window. In my case I have a Logitech laser mouse and I am using âButton 8â. Also under the Appearance section check the option âAutostart Easystrokeâ.\n\n\n*Create New Easystroke Action\n\nGo to the Actions tab. Click the Add Action button. Name the action âOverlay via Mouseâ. The Type should be âCommandâ and the Detailswill be:\nxdotool key Menu\n\n\n\n*Associate Mouse Button to Easystroke Action\n\nIn Easystroke highlight your new âActionâ by clicking on it. Click the Record Stroke button. Move your cursor to the small resulting window and click the desired mouse button. Click the Yes button to confirm your mouse button input. Click the Hide button when you are finished.\nAgain, unless you specifically want to use mouse gestures, I think xbindkeys is a better, more responsive solution than easystroke. You should be able to test this fancy new functionality immediately. If not, try logging out and logging back in. Enjoy.\n", "Q: Where can I find the Ubuntu wiki theme?

I'm particularly concerned with performance and the integrity of the results.\n\nA: Of all the ones you have listed Octave is the most syntax compatible.  In fact, apart from some of the expensive Matlab toolboxes, Octave should run 98% (a number I just made up) of your code.  I use Matlab at work and Octave at home.  \nOctave will not run (natively) some of the inbuilt GUIs like inputdlg etc, if you install Qtoctave (an IDE for Octave, sudo apt-get install qtoctave) you can use xmlwidget and a wrapper to get that functionality (I can post code if you are interested).  \nAs far as performance is concerned, Octave is not as fast (google for benchmarks).  However, you can get all modern versions of Matlab running on Linux (if you have a licence) and they are included on the install disk by default now, and performance of Linux version of Matlab is as good and often better on Linux when compared to Windows.\nIf you want performance and you wan't to use free software best to look at scipy.  But the syntax is less compatible.  You will need to rewrite you code.  Spyder is an ide that uses python and scipy, scilab is a mash of octave and maxima and a few others.  Not sure about performance of freemat but I don't think it is as developed as Octave.\nGood luck.\nA few benchmarks\nspeed\nhttp://www.osc.edu/research/cse/projects/octave_python.pdf\nhttp://www.wseas.us/e-library/conferences/2010/Corfu/COMPUTERS/COMPUTERS2-56.pdf\nRemember benchmarks are subjective.  There are many variables.  The only true way to know is to test them all on your rig using your processing code.\n\nA: Well you're in for a treat I have used all the programming languages/software you mentioned. FreeMat and Spyder I do not have too much experience with, but I have some. The others I am experienced in.\nGNU Octave by far beets the competition. Its syntax has an extreme compatibility with that of MATLAB. The only differences, I'm aware of at least, aside from the odd toolbox, which you can attempt to replace by the packages here is that GNU Octave can define functions from the command line.\nI don't know if you're aware of QtOctave. QtOctave is a frontend (GUI) for the GNU Octave programming language. QtOctave comes with an editor too.\nScilab is an adequate replacement for MATLAB too. It has some differences in terms of syntax but nothing you can't get your head around if you search the documentation that comes with it.\nFreeMat is the worst, in my opinion at least, of software that's syntax is heavily based on MATLAB. My evidence for this is three part: firstly, in the software centre it receive the lowest star rating of the four software in question. Second, it isn't frequently updated, the latest version in the software centre, was last updated in 2008. Third as a result of my second piece of evidence its functions are somewhat lagging. The plus side, however, is that its syntax is highly compatible with MATLAB's.\nI have used Spyder, but only briefly I'm afraid. It seems top-quality. The problem with it is that it has only limited compatibility with MATLAB, syntax wise. It requires you to learn some of the Python programming language, that is, if you plan to do well at it.\nI would also recommend SageMath as it includes GNU Octave, (if its already installed on your system) Scilab, (if you already have it installed) NumPy, [NumPy and the rest mentioned unless otherwise specified come with Sage and therefore no installation is necessary] Scipy, Matplotlib, maxima, Fortran among many others. SageMath may be downloaded by going to the website http://www.sagemath.org/download-linux.html and selecting a suitable mirror, based on where you are and then installing the relevant .tar.lzma file. After this copy and paste the following commands into terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T):\ncd ~/Downloads\nsudo mv sage-linux-xbit-ubuntu_y-z-Linux.tar.lzma /home/username\ncd ~\ntar --lzma -xvf sage-linux-xbit-ubuntu_y-z-Linux.tar.lzma\ncd ~/sage-linux-xbit-ubuntu_y-z-Linux\nmake\nsudo ln -s /home/username/sage-linux-xbit-ubuntu_y-z-Linux/sage /usr/local/bin/sage\n\nWhere 'x' refers to the bits of your OS; 'y' refers to the version of Ubuntu the sage is designed for (e.g. 10.04_lts; 12.04_lts (the _lts is required in 'y'), etc.); 'z' refers to the architecture of your OS. (i386, amd64, etc.)\n\nA: Just for clarification: Why do you want an alternative for Matlab? The answer of prasadkumar013 suggests you can't use Matlab on Ubuntu, but you can (at least I am running it on Ubuntu ;) ). There is a community documentation on the page https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MATLAB. \nIn case you want a free alternative go with octave, most of the matlab code will work directly in octave. Try to work in the terminal though, the qtoctave GUI was not so user friendly in my opinion.\n\nA: Most similar to MATLAB = Octave, (link to gui  )\nAn awesome up-and-coming high-level computation language = julia\nBut my favorite and IMHO most useful all around language, PYTHON (scipy, sage, cython...)\n\nA: This is nice paper. \nIt has brief explanation and various tests done.\nBTW I don't use MATLAB or anything like that.\n\nA: http://pdl.perl.org/\nPDL (\"Perl Data Language\") gives standard Perl the ability to compactly store and speedily manipulate the large N-dimensional data arrays which are the bread and butter of scientific computing.\n\nA: Have you already tried Sage (www.sagemath.org)? It's a container for different mathematics software and it can do symbolic and numerical calculations. The latter ones are done using numpy and scipy.\nIt has a very active community and it's an open source project written in python.\nSince you're interested in performances, here there are some benchmarks (at the end of the page also comparisons with Matlab).\n\nA: My college uses MATLAB on their Windows PCs. But for using MATLAB on Ubuntu I had been left with two choices\n\n\n*\n\n*Install MATLAB over wine or any virtualization software\n\n*Find a Linux Equivallent\n\n\nAs virtualization is very heavy on my laptop, I searched for an alternative. After many software trials, I finally settled for OCTAVE. It can run most of the standard MATLAB codes. Instead of GNU Octave, it is better to go for qt Octave. While the former is terminal based, the later is GUI based.\nMy choice is to go for qt Octave\nsudo apt-get install qtoctave\n\nA: I have not done a real comparison but in my experience purely form a performance perspective octave is better than MATLAB.\nYou should note that \"it is all relative\" different toolboxes have different performances. \nIf you have limited RAM on your machine I would say anything would work better than MATLAB. \n", "Q: How can I upload to Google Music via a proxy?

I was told that the SCSI mode page commands that provide serial numbers are an optional feature.  Is this true?\nGrub2 most definitely fails to function on disks that do not provide serial numbers.  See LP: #604335 for details.  The key issue is that while the /usr/bin/grub-install script does not look at /dev/disk/by-id/* files, the code that running \"sudo dpkg-reconfigure grub-pc\" executes looks for only disks that provide serial numbers by using the contents of /dev/disk/by-id/* as the source of information.\nOne of the critical aspects of this is that VMware Fusion /dev/sda emulated disks fail to provide serial numbers (comment #44 in LP: #604335 above) so they fail with grub-pc.\nHow many non-virtual disks do not implement serial numbers and therefore cannot be used with grub2 correctly?\n\nA: I just noticed that in Ubuntu 11.10 Oneiric the grub-pc version 1.99-12ubuntu5 running inside VMware Fusion 4.1.1 (536016) most definitely does not have SCSI serial numbers for /dev/sda etc. virtual drives yet has working \"dpkg-reconfigure grub-pc\".\nLook in /dev/disk/by-id/ and none of the symlinks are to sda, that confirms there are no SCSI serial numbers.\nSomething was likely updated in the script(s) that the grub-pc package contains to be able to cope with having no /dev/disk/by-id/ symlinks.  I will go take a look at what it is that was done.  I also have to check to see what is up with 10.04 LTS if anything since this affects KVM guests with virtio /dev/vda disks too.  Later versions of Ubuntu past 10.04 support using <serial>foo</serial> in libvirt xml and that works to create /dev/disk/by-id/ symlinks provided you have a new enough udev to create /sys/block/vda/serial \n", "Q: How to grep whole manual?

We use the Python ctypes library to call C functions from the X library directly.

The modifiers are 1=Shift, 2=Lock (Caps Lock), 4=Control, 8=Mod1, 16=Mod2, 32=Mod3, 64=Mod4, 128=Mod5. Run xmodmap -pm to see what Mod1 through Mod5 correspond to. For example, to turn off all modifiers, call X11.XkbLockModifiers(display, c_uint(0x0100), c_uint(255), c_uint(0)). To turn on Num Lock which is on Mod2 and at the same time turn off Caps Lock, call X11.XkbLockModifiers(display, c_uint(0x0100), c_uint(2 | 16), c_uint(16)).\n\nHere's a C version if you want to make a small binary instead of invoking Python.

I'm running Ubuntu 11.10 using the gnome-fallback mode with compiz.\nMy keyboard is the Apple metal add-on USB keyboard. My .Xmodmap file is set to swap the Alt and Command keys.\nI built the key map into a .Xmodmap file, and it works successfully for the X session. (I can do Grid commands with ctrl-alt-number pad commands using the Command key as the Alt key.)\nBut none of the applications running under X recognize the new key mapping. (Command-F doesn't open the File menu but option-F does. Command-right-click doesn't open the panel menu, but option-right-click does.)\nHow do I get my apps to pick up the new mod mapping?\n\nA: Ubuntu uses xkb up to allowing different keyboard layout per window. Those are activated per window and here probably is the reason of xmodmap being ignored.\nFirst play with existing options (just open keyboard preferences and click Options on your keyboard layout). There are some key swapping options there (I don't have mac so I don't know whether there is an option to swap alt and command, but it is fairly likely).\nIf not, /usr/share/X11/xkb directory may be of interest but here I don't feel able to explain how to add new keyboard options.\n", "Q: Acer Timeline X 3830TG Battery life i'm running ubuntu 11.10 and i'm interested in getting more life out of my battery,\nI see a lot of people adding extra lines to their /etc/default/grub file after \"quiet splash\".\nFor instance one user suggested\nchange GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT to be:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=âquiet splash pcie_aspm=force acpi_osi=Linux i915.i915_enable_rc6=1â³\nThis was for his Acer Aspire Timelinex AS4830tg-6450,\nThe hardware of the 4830TG differ only by the processor, his is the intel core i5-2430M 2.3Ghz while mine is the intel core i5-2410M 2.3Ghz\nAre these changes model/hardware specific.\nWhat changes should i make to get the same results (he noticed a big increase in battery life)\nanything else i can do?\nThank you\n\nA: Well the power regression and overheating bug affected most Intel processors including the Core 2 Duo, i3, i5 (sandy bridge).

When I am using \"aptitude search\", usually some results will be too long to be held in the console window. So are there any ways to display each result in multiple lines, so that I can see the full sentence? Thank you.\nSnapshot:\n\n\nA: The simpler thing you can do, without using an option for the display format, is to change the display width.\naptitude uses as display width that of the terminal, or a fixed width of 80 if cannot determine the terminal width (i.e. when you pipe the result to another command). \nYou can change that with the -w option, for example:\naptitude -w 200 search pattern\n\nUnfortunately, the field containing the package name expands considerably, and don't seem to be controllable through the format option (-F).\nAlso, could be useful to pipe the result to less -S: the -S option makes less to not wrap line longer than the terminal width.

I tried the net for an answer and had no luck.\nThanks for any help on this issue.\n\nA: I'm having the same problems. The problem only happens when more than 3.8 GB of data is being burned. It has become a real pain to reinstall cdrtools constantly, and there are an increasing number of tricks needed to make burning programs work. Big, big fail on the Debian/Ubuntu front...\nThe problem is with cdrkit ( wodim /genisoimage ) which doesn't handle large volumes of data very well. This is a problem dating back years and stemming from the replacement of cdrtools with the dysfunctional (and unmainained) cdrkit.\nThis is one of my biggest gripes with Debian/Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Can I specify a port for certain IP address in SSH's config?

I know I can just add -p2222 or add an alias in ~/.bash_aliases, but is there a way to force a certain port when I ssh a specified IP? \n\nA: You could add the host to your ssh configuration file. Run man ssh_config from a terminal for some nice reading.\nIn short place\nHost <hostname>\nPort 2222\n\nin your ~/.ssh/config\n\nA: Sure, you can put these settings in ~/.ssh/config.\nHost 192.168.1.45\nPort 2222\n\nYou can take this opportunity to give the machine a nickname, and set other options, in particular the remote user name. For example, the following declaration makes ssh foo equivalent to ssh -p 2222 matt@192.168.1.45 (Host foo means that the following options apply when you run ssh foo, and the HostName directive makes foo a nickname for 192.168.1.45 with all the other options):\nHost foo\nHostName 192.168.1.45\nPort 2222\nUser matt\n\n\nA: For any ec2 instance IP, automatically picks useranme and key file.\nHost *.*.*.* \n     IdentityFile ~/.ssh/key.pem\n     Port 22\n     CheckHostIP no\n     PasswordAuthentication no\n     User ec2-user\n     UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null\n     StrictHostKeyChecking no\n", "Q: How can I remove the Suspend and Hibernate options from the power menu?

Anyway, I enabled this extension using the AddOn Compatibility Reporter. And, actually, I cannot watch Silverlight streams in an acceptable way: the video gets stuck, the HD keeps buffering (I guess), so I have to close the window.\nDoes anybody know if there is a way to fix this or a suitable alternative?\nI'm looking for something which is fully supported and mantained.\n\nA: \nTo those that wish to install Moonlight on any Firefox version greater than v4 and like me could not get the Official Firefox Compatibility checker to allow installation...then you can do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the plugin according to your architecture - 32bit or 64bit\n\n*Save the .xpi file into an empty folder.\n\n*Change the file extension to zip if necessary\n\n*Right-click the .xpi file and choose Extract\n\n*In the extracted files, open the file install.rdf into your favourite text editor\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*find the area in the file shown - change the maxVersion from *4.0.** to *99.0.** and save (N.B. picture shows 9 - this value needs to higher than your Firefox version)\n\n*Delete the folder META-INF\n\n*Highlight all the files - Right click and choose Compress - save the compressed file in Zip format\n\n\n*Rename the file to have a .xpi extension rather than a .zip file extension\n\n*In firefox you can use the Firefox Addon wrench symbol to install the modified addon - you will be warned about its authenticity which you can ignore.  This warning appears because you deleted the authenticity checks folder META-INF previously.\n\nFinally - when Firefox version changes, Firefox will automatically disable the add-on.  Use the official Compatibility Reporter to re-enable this modified add-on \n\nA few possible reasons why you have playback issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*The stream you are using doesnt have smooth streaming capability \n\n*the bitrate is too high for you broadband\n\n*you are using an underpowered CPU or are RAM starved\n\n*you graphics card is underpowered\n\n*You are using open-source drivers which (depending on the graphics card) sometimes can be much slower in terms of frame-rate than their proprietary cousins (ATI/NVIDIA).  \n\n*Compiz issues - sometimes switching to Gnome-Classic (no effects) works better for me.\n\n\n\nIf you have trouble with a \"play\" button on-screen during playback and/or \"autoplay\" in general; goto about:config and set \"media.autoplay.enabled\" to \"false\".\n\nFinal note - from wikipedia, moonlight development has stopped.  The developers have been laid off from Novell and the company that has taken over has stopped (for some unknown reason) the nightly builds.  Looks like this technology is in dire straights :( \n\nA: I presume you have installed Moonlight from the official website (as it is not packaged in Oneiric's official repositories). The default download is the Moonlight 4 Preview, since the latest stable release (Moonlight 2.4.1) does not support much of the Silverlight content currently on the web. But Moonlight 4 is not finished and does not currently support Firefox 8.\nUnfortunately, as of the time of this writing, the download server for the Moonlight 4 nightly builds (which are even less stable, but which contain the latest features) is currently down. My guess is that current nightly builds would not support Firefox 8 either, though.\nSince the latest versions of the Chromium browser are supported, for now I recommend using Chromium when you need to view/play Silverlight content. You can get Chromium by installing the package called chromium-browser (you can do this in the Software Center or by running the command sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install chromium-browser in the Terminal). Then, in Chromium, you can download the Moonlight plugin here. Unfortunately the Moonlight website does not properly detect your architecture in Chromium, so it will always suggest the 32-bit version of the plugin; if you have the 64-bit version of Ubuntu, then you should click the radio button for the 64-bit version of the plugin.\n\n(If you're not sure if you have the 32-bit or 64-bit version of Ubuntu, press Ctrl+Alt+T to open a Terminal window, type/paste in uname -m and press Enter. If you see x86_64 then you have the 64-bit version of Ubuntu. If you see i386, i586, i686, or ia32, then you are running the 32-bit version of Ubuntu.)\nWhen you click on the download link (which says Linux/i586 or Linux/x86_64), you will be warned that installing plugins for Chromium could harm your computer. Since you're downloading a reasonably stable version of the plugin and you're getting it from Novell's official download site, you can go ahead and click Continue to proceed in downloading and installing the plugin.\n\nThen the plugin should download and automatically install, and immediately start working; you should not even need to restart Chromium. However, if you had a previous version of the plugin installed, you might need to restart Chromium. And if you had pages that were trying to display Silverlight content already open, you will probably have to reload those pages to enable the content to display.\nOnce you've installed Moonlight, you might want to configure it. To do that, right-click on any Silverlight content (on any page) and click Moonlight Settings. This brings up the Novell Moonlight Configuration window.\n\nSome Silverlight content requires that the Microsoft Media Pack be installed. You can install this from the Playback tab of the Novell Moonlight Configuration window.\nLike Firefox and other browsers, Chromium has a private browsing mode called Incognito. If you use this mode, you should be aware that 3rd-party extensions (including Moonlight) are disabled by default, because their behavior with respect to your privacy cannot be ascertained.\n\nIf you decide you want to enable Moonlight in Incognito mode, you can do so the Extensions tab of the Chromium preferences. Click the karat triangle to the left of the entry for Moonlight and then check the box labeled Allow in Incognito.\n\nPlease note that Moonlight will only be disabled by default for Incognito mode. For normal browsing, it will be enabled by default.\nSince many users prefer to use Firefox and newer versions of Firefox are now widely adopted, hopefully Moonlight will support them soon. Until then, you can work around the problem by using Chromium to view sites with Silverlight content, as described above.\n\nA: You have 2 main choices:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can skip the check for compatibility editing the configuration as shown in this tutorial.\n\n*You can install this plugin that allows the installation of a plugins that otherwise are not compatible.\n\nA: Eliah's post regarding installing Moonlight in the Chromium browser worked for me. I am using Linux Mint 13 (Maya) which is based on Ubuntu.\nI also managed to install Moonlight in Firefox using the plugin as the previous commentator suggested. I also installed the codecs it comes with. Moonlight seems to load correctly but there is no sound. Let me know if there is a way to fix this.\nChromium is a good short term fix but not a good solution. It takes my CPU to the limit, overheating my old laptop. Unfortunately, according to Wikipedia, \"In December 2011 Miguel de Icaza announced that work on Moonlight had stopped with no future plans.\"\nSo our only hope is that HTML5 will eventually solve the problems with the plugins.\nThanks for your help!\n", "Q: Thunderbird 8 changed default skin/theme - any way to change it back?

All you need is a free Ubuntu One account (of course, if you want to purchase any songs on the store you'll need a credit card).\nThe range of music available will depend on where in the world you're located.

This TV has many connections including VGA (First reason I bought it), HDMI (Second reason but did not have a HDMI cable at that time) and DVI.\nI have had this TV for little over a month now, actually I had it to celebrate the release of Ubuntu 11.10 and started using it exactly on that date (I know too much fan there but hey, I like geek stuff). I started using it with the VGA cable. After 2 weeks I bought an Nvidia GT440 card. The previous 9500GT which was using the VGA connection was working correctly with no problems whatsoever. \nI installed the GT440 and the first problem that I encountered using this latest card is mentioned here: Black screen on latest Nvidia/Ati Cards when starting LightDM/Ubuntu. The solution to this problem was to actually disconnect then connect again the VGA cable. This would result in the screen showing me the lightdm screen for my login. If I did not disconnect then connect the cable I could be there forever thinking that there is no video signal. The black screen problem was solved in a later update for 12.04 and already solved using the default 12.10. So using 12.04 and updating or using 12.10 solved the black screen with HDMI problem.\nI got tired of looking for answers that did not work and for solutions that made me literally have to install Ubuntu again. I just went and bought an HDMI cable and changed the VGA one for that one. It worked and I did not have to disconnect/connect the cable but now I have this problem when using any resolution. My normal resolution is 1920x1080 (This TV is 1080HD) so in VGA I could use this resolution with no problem, but on HDMI am getting the borders cut out. Here is a pic:\n\nAs you can see from the image, the Launcher icons only show less than 50% of their width. Forget about the top and bottom parts, I can access them with the mouse but I can not visualize them in the screen. It is like it's outside of the TVs view. Basically there is like 20 to 30 pixels gone from all sides.\nI searched around and came to running xrand --verbose to see what it could detect from the TV. I got this:\ncyrex@cyrex:~$ xrandr --verbose\nxrandr: Failed to get size of gamma for output default\nScreen 0: minimum 320 x 175, current 1920 x 1080, maximum 1920 x 1080\ndefault connected

There is a flickering effect at this resolution using HDMI but not VGA which I imagine is related to the borders cut off issue am asking here.\n\nA: Executive summary: xrandr --output HDMI-0 --set underscan on did the trick for me.\nNone of the answers here worked for my configuration. I have a Panasonic TH-42PX80U and an ATI Radeon HD5770 graphics card. (Yeah, it's an old rig.)\nThe proprietary AMD fglrx driver did not have this problem, but it also cannot run Broken Age. This problem is particularly annoying for that game, since some of the text winds up off the screen.\nI tried every setting in the television's menu, and every option for its \"format\" (wide, full, zoom, etc.). Nothing helped.\nRunning xrandr --verbose showed that my HDMI output is named \"HDMI-0\" and that it supports the underscan setting. After running either one of these, I can finally see the whole image:\nxrandr --output HDMI-0 --set underscan on\n\nor\nxrandr --output HDMI-0 --set underscan auto\n\n\nA: I had exactly the same problem today. I am using a Samsung LCD. The problem was super easy to fix, I just found the remote for the TV, went into options and on Picture Options, I set it to fit to screen. I know you are not using a Samsung but I am pretty sure your TV will have similar options.\n\nA: The following solves the problem on lower resolutions than 1920x1080 or on other TVs (My father has a Sony TV where this problem is also solved) because the problem lies in the TVs themselves. Some TVs that are used for Computers offer 1920x1080 for VGA only but not for HDMI. Others need configuration in the TV monitor and lastly in some rare cases some have incompatible resolutions between the video card (what the video card can do) and the TV (What the TV resolution can show). The following solutions try to fix problems like black borders, space left in the sides or top and bottom and graphic corruption when using 1920 on a TV and letters look weird:\nNVIDIA WAY\n\n*\n\n*Go to Nvidia-Settings and there will be an option that will have more features if a HDMI cable is connected. In the next pic the option is DFP-1 (CNDLCD) but this name changes depending on what device the PC is connected to:\n\n\n\n\n*Uncheck Force Full GPU Scaling\nWhat this will do for resolutions LOWER than 1920x1080 (At least in my case) is solve the flickering problem and fix the borders cut by the monitor.\n\n\n*Save to Xorg.conf file the changes made after changing to a resolution acceptable to your eyes.\n\nTV WAY\n\n*\n\n*If your TV has OSD Menu and this menu has options for scanning the screen resolution or auto adjusting to it, disable them. Specifically the option about SCAN.\n\n\n*If you have an option for AV Mode disable it.\n\n\n*Basically disable any option that needs to scan and scale the resolution. Test one by one. In the case of my father's TV this did it. In my case, the Nvidia solved it for lower resolutions.\nNOTE (Comment made by User James - https://askubuntu.com/users/39762/james): For some Samsung LCD TVs. Using the TV Remote Control go to Options -> Picture Options and set the Picture Option to \"Fit to Screen\".\nVIDEO QUALITY\nIf you happen to have a 1080p TV and have lower quality on 1920x1080 like the following 2 images then it is recommended that you actually lower the resolution to 1680x1050 to still have enough space for everything but avoid the lower quality that appears on the highest resolution (I have tested and this affects 16:9 and 16:10 resolutions with 50 or 60 refresh rate in the max resolution. It depends in some part with the TV and if it supports 16:9, 16:10 or both. The other part responsible is the driver.):\nThe following image is from a 1680x1050 resolution:\n\nThe following image is from a 1920x1080 resolution:\n\nAs you can see from both images, 1920 cuts the sides and the text looks blurry and something that came from a over compress JPG file. In the case of 1680, the quality is excellent and everything can be read without going blind.\nIn VGA or HDMI my text looks blurry (While browsing with Firefox/Chrome, Using Nautilus, etc..)\nOne reason might be that the FXAA option was activated, this is only available on later Nvidia drivers and cards that support the Antialiasing FXAA feature:\n\nDo NOT activate this feature if the result is a blurry text that appears to stay blurry for a couple of seconds every time an window is moved or changed, making vision tough when trying to read anything. Just deactivate the feature and logout or reboot.\nMANUALLY ADJUSTING THE RESOLUTION\nIf you happen to have one of the newest Nvidia Drivers, then some of the above points will not work. For this cases, Open the nvidia-settings app and go to X Server Display Configuration. Click on Advanced... and change the following options to a resolution slightly lower than the one you are using:\n\n*\n\n*Video Port In\n\n*Video Port Out\n\n*Panning\n\n\nNote that the TV I am using does not support 1680x1040. Instead I selected 1920x1080 ad then edited the 3 mentioned options to a slightly lower resolution so I could \"move\" the X/Y coordinates to see the Launcher Icons and Top Pane. In the Video Port Out option,\nThe 2 values after the resolution are the X and Y coordinates. They will normally appear like 1680x1040+0+0 but after you edit the values and Save the changes you will see the Launcher and Top panel appear. In my case I put 48 for X and 30 for Y. This made the panel and Launcher correctly show in TV (Viewport).\n\nA: I was having similar issue with my Sony TV.  I'm using it as extended 2nd monitor via HDMI - feed goes through my Onkyo amplifier first.\nAnyways, I confirmed that my 'wide mode' on the TV was set to Full only (not Wide Zoom or H Stretch or anything else) but I still had a few pixels off the edge of the screen like in your screenshot.  I also turned off the 'Auto Wide feature' - still no change.\nI then noticed an option under the 'Screen' menu of the TV called 'Display Area'.  I changed the setting from 'Normal' (which was set by default) to 'Full Pixel' and this immediately fixed my issue.\n\nA: I had some similar issues today, but it turned out it was the settings on the TV that had to be tuned. If you haven't already, try adjusting the monitor settings (ie. size).\n\nA: Check your monitor settings. On my monitor I have a setting called \"HDMI Mode\". It has two options \"PC Mode\" and \"Video Mode\". If I set it to PC mode, it's perfect. If I set it to \"Video mode\", I have the same situation you describe.\n\nA: If you have an ATI video card, the solution might in the Ubuntu Forums. The only way I was able to fix a similar problem was from the command line, after installing the AMD proprietary drivers.\nsudo aticonfig --set-pcs-val=MCIL,DigitalHDTVDefaultUnderscan,0\n\nIt's a strange solution, but it works for me.\n\nA: I had a similar problem after installing Ubuntu 12.04 on my Dell Optiflex, hooked up to an LG 32\" HD-ready TV. The native setting for the TV is 1360 x 768, but I was only able to get it running correctly on 1024 x 768.\nAfter trying all sorts of suggestions from the OS side, I read the post from l3dx above and checked my TV's configuration. The solution was to go into the TV's Picture > Screen settings and manually set the XGA setting to 1360 x 768. \nI then set the Display resolution in Ubuntu to the same, and it works great.\n\nA: It's just underscan, on your control panel there should be a setting, it's a bit hard to handle unless you've got an nvidia adapter\n\nA: On my Panasonic VIERA I found the \"16:9 overscan\" option; and turned that to \"Off\".\nNow the text is readable; and the sides of the screen are no longer cut off. :]\n\nA: I had the same problem on a 40 inch Micromax Full HD TV\nTo solve it, I set the panorama aspect ratio on the TV remote.\n\nA: I've a Sony Bravia 32inch TV, and I'd encountered a similar issue. \nI did the following to fix it (every operation was performed from the TV remote).\n1.) Go to Options, and select Screen.\n2.) There, depending on your present screen settings, you can you either (or both) Horizontal Shift or Vertical Shift. You can also play around with the Wide option.\n", "Q: charm proof issues a \"relation server has no hooks\" warning When I run charm proof <path_to_charm_folder> I get the following warning.\n\nW: relation server has no hooks\n\nWhat does this mean and how do I get rid of it?\n\nA: It is just a warning about a nonexistent relation defined in your metadata.yaml file. \nDoes not mean there is something wrong with your Charm and can be ignored.

What is a Juju Charm? What is a Juju Charm? What is it used for?\n\nA: From juju package description:\n\nJuju is a next generation service orchestration framework. It has been\n  likened to APT for the cloud. With Juju, different authors are able to\n  create service formulas, called charms, independently, and make those\n  services coordinate their communication and configuration through a\n  simple protocol.\n\nSo, a charm tells juju how to manage a service. Examples of a service may be \"mysql database\" or \"wordpress\". After a service is deployed, juju can define relations between them (\"worpress needs mysql\") and expose some services to the outside world.\nIt's a set of scripts that can be written in any language that fire off hooks based on certain things. So the \"install hook\" is the first thing that will be run on an instance when juju installs on it, and we can do hooks to other services. \nThe charm usually includes all the intelligence needed to scale the service horizontally. So, for example, the charm for clustered MySQL would know how to add machines to the cluster, preserving the relationships with all the services depending on that service. This lets you build out, and scale up and down, the service you want, especially on the cloud.\nJuju can also be used together with Orchestra for physical deployments. So, for example, if you have a charm for Hadoop, you can use that to install Hadoop across a few thousand servers with Orchestra.\nYou can get some more info from Juju user tutorial\n\nA: Juju is a service orchestration tool for the cloud. Billed as \"DevOps Distilled\", it's a tool designed to help allow for consistent and reliable deployments of services to a cloud provider. Commonly likened to as \"apt-get for the cloud\" Juju achieves this goal by using charms which are essentially the building blocks, the containers of all the instructions on how to not only deploy, install, and configure a service but how that service relates to other services in the cloud.\nThere are plenty of questions and documentation on how to get started with Juju, so I won't repeat them here.\nYou can install the Juju client on a number of platforms, it's not limited to any one edition of Ubuntu. So you can install juju on your Ubuntu desktop, Mac OSX, and other platforms with support for more platforms coming soon.\nThere are no e-books or the like on Juju currently. The best place for help is the website, the docs, IRC, or here on Ask Ubuntu\n", "Q: What tools are necessary to create a juju charm? What methods and tools supplied by Ubuntu are necessary to create a juju charm?\n\nA: The Charm Tools PPA includes the charms-tools package, which is useful for creating and testing charms. \ncharm create <ubuntu-package-name> will create a basic charm with filled metadata for you. Use this if you want to build a charm out of something that is already packaged in Ubuntu. \ncharm create whatever will just create a blank charm for you to edit if you want to create a charm for something else, for example one that pulls from the latest upstream source or for something that is not available as a package in Ubuntu.\nAnd lastly you'll want charm proof to test to see if your charm is correct.\n", "Q: Upgrade process interrupted; can't boot and need to recover protected data I was using Ubuntu 11.04 and upgrading to 11.10.

As I have made them protected when opened with a LiveCD, there is an error saying \"You do not have the permission to access them.\"\nSo I need to delete the administrator status through the terminal window. I can access my terminal window and run the sudo commands.                                                                                                       \nSo help me to delete the administrator status through the commands in the terminal window, please.\n\nA: While in the liveCD, run the command gksu nautilus. This should work as it opens nautilus as root. Alternatively, you can try to copy or move your files using the sudo cpor sudo mv respectively.\nAlthough I thoroughly recommend to copy your data elsewhere, I'm also pretty sure that (if you have /home on a separate partition) you can reinstall Ubuntu without formatting /home.\n\nA: The error you just mentioned made me struggle for long, and solution is simple. Check this question:\nLightdm : Checking battery state - No login screen\nEDIT\nI will quote it for you:\nThis was not the problem. After reading the log in /var/logs/lightdm I found the problem is .Xauthority was in /var/lib/lightdm/ was owned by root. Deleting it and rebooting the machine did it!

Use sudo netstat -r to see if you have a default route. If there is no default route, use this command to set the default route:\nsudo route add default gw <ip address of the gateway>\n\n/etc/resolv.conf doesn't have anything to do with routing, its for DNS. Now check if your internet is working using ping 8.8.8.8. If the ping is working, you can add the DNS servers to /etc/resolv.conf and your net will be fully functional.\n\nA: What did you use for a static IP? If you picked an IP already in use you might be able to ping other machines, but the gateway might be colliding with what you have set. Each IP address must be unique within the network.\nYou can check your IP address using: ifconfig eth0\nDo you actually need a static IP address? Do you have a DHCP server?\n", "Q: Unable to mount VirtualBox Guest Additions as a guest (Win7 host) I keep getting this error dialog with an Unable to mount error E_FAIL ( 0x80004005 ) when I try to mount Guest Additions:\n\nI tried the Force Unmount, but that just closes the dialog with no action taken.

Before that each time the update manager poped up to tell me there are updates and I tell it to install them it will ask me for a password. But since recently it does not do that anymore. When I click install it just downloads them and installs them.\nIs this a bug or intended behaviour?\nI use Oneiric with latest updates if that helps\n\nA: Why does update-manager no longer prompt for the user's password?\n As of Ubuntu 11.10, update-manager no longer prompts for the user's password to apply updates. This was decided to improve usability and to make it easier for users to apply security updates and therefore increase system security. The rationale is as follows:\nLike in previous releases, by default only people in the admin group are allowed access to perform security updates.\nOnly updates for already installed software can be applied without a password. Installing additional software still requires people to enter their password. The password prompt had become an irritant for some people such that they would just press 'Cancel' instead of installing the updates. The password prompt decreased system security for those users.\nPeople that did dutifully apply updates became conditioned to enter their privileged password perhaps daily. When the user is prompted for the password, it should mean something and the frequency of update-manager updates meant that some people no longer thought about why they were entering their password. For these users, the password prompt had the potential to reduce security. \nSource\n", "Q: How to start jenkins? I installed jenkins via sudo apt-get install jenkins. However, it doesn't start up.

Oneiric is giving me a really bad performance at the moment and and I want I go back to a faster Ubuntu version. Would 10.04 give me a good performance??\n\nA: I would say before you migrate to another version check why it is giving you bad perfomance. Is it your machine is too old? is there a long list of services/applications running on background? Once you establish that it will be easy to take a route. Here is my suggestion based on assumptions:\n\n\n*\n\n*If it happens that your machine is old and cannot handle Unity 3D well then try 2D version or switch to classic gnome (I suggest 10.10).\n\n*If background programs/services are culprit think of disabling it and run them on demand\nI would wait until you put computer specs and services running so that I can give even more solid answer!\n\nA: its not about Ubuntu, its about the fancy stuffs that are now being shipped with Ubuntu. Then kernel per-se is pretty fast enough.\nIf you have used the custom version of Ubuntu, Ubuntu Ultimate UE, you can notice how worse it performs compared to the standard installation.\nSo, ya 10.04 would perform better than 11.10 since many fancy things like 3D graphics won't be burning your CPU cycle.\nI personally think that Canonical has been declining in performance of Ubuntu steadily, 8.10 was better than 9.10, which was better than 10.10 which again was better than 11.10. But this is only a personal opinion. I have no data to back up my claim.\nYou can get a feel of what I said at this page which is comparing 8.10 and 9.04.\n\nA: The fastest Ubuntu edition is always the server version, but if you want a GUI take a look at Lubuntu.\nLubuntu is a light weight version of Ubuntu. It's made to be a faster than Ubuntu. You can download it here. \n", "Q: Why am I still using an older kernel version after upgrading? Why is the kernel still at version 2.x after upgrading from Ubuntu 11.04 to 11.10? I read that 11.10 has 3.x.\n\nA: Yes 11.10 have version 3.

This article says you can have increased performance in Linux with zRam (virtual swap compressed in RAM).\nI have 4 GB of RAM , 2.93 GHz (Dual Core) & I use virtualization a lot (VMWare). Would it be helpful to my computer's performance to install zRam? I'm using Ubuntu 11.10 as my host and a VMWare workstation for virtualization .\n\nA: I'm using it on Oneiric and have not found any problem yet. You should give it a try, and see if the performance is better. Virtualization is one of their use cases. But bear in mind that to give that \"extra memory\" effect, pages are compressed, which requires cpu power.\nTo see if it is running, use service zramswap status\n", "Q: Bash history handling with multiple terminals I use mainly Terminator, and it's usually opened with 3 split terminal windows. I also use Gnome terminal for various reasons.\nI'm wondering how is bash history handled in this case as I sometimes miss previously issued commands when I run history\nFor example, my prompt shows current bash history line (\\!) and if I launch Terminator with 3 split terminal windows I get same history line (let's say 100) on all terminals. Which history will be saved?  \nAlso launching Gnome Terminal after using Terminator I get line 100 at startup regardless all commands issued before in Terminator\n\nA: After multiple readings of man bash, I use separate history files for each shell. I did a mkdir -m 0700  ~/.history then added  \n[[ -d ~/.history ]] || mkdir --mode=0700 ~/.history\n[[ -d ~/.history ]] && chmod 0700 ~/.history\nHISTFILE=~/.history/history.$(date +%y%b%d-%H%M%S).$$\n# close any old history file by zeroing HISTFILESIZE  \nHISTFILESIZE=0  \n# then set HISTFILESIZE to a large value\nHISTFILESIZE=4096  \nHISTSIZE=4096  \n\nto my ~/.bashrc. Every now and then, I remember to du -sk .history and clean it out. It's nice to have every command I've typed preserved for me.\nI just used the above to see what I'd been doing, of late:\ncut -f1 \"-d \" .history/* | sort | uniq -c |sort -n -r |less\nor\ncut -f1-2 \"-d \" .history/* | sort | uniq -c |sort -n -r |less\n(to include the 1st argument e.g. sudo mount in the sort chain).\n\nA: If you want a more complete solution that persists your bash history locally, stores additional context (cwd, runtime, exit code, etc) and syncs it to your other computers, see hishtory. I got frustrated with shell histories misbehaving, and this is my solution to the problem.\n\nA: The bash session that is saved is the one for the terminal that is closed the latest. If you want to save the commands for every session, you could use the trick explained here.\n\nexport PROMPT_COMMAND='history -a'\n\nTo quote the manpage: âIf set, the value is executed as a command prior to issuing each primary prompt.â\nSo every time my command has finished, it appends the unwritten history item to ~/.bash_history before displaying the prompt (only $PS1) again.\nSo after putting that line in /etc/bash.bashrc I donât have to find myself reinventing wheels or lose valuable seconds re-typing stuff just because I was lazy with my terminals.\n\nAnyway, you'll need to take into account that commands from different sessions will be mixed in your history file so it won't be so straightforward to read it later.\nSee also:\n\n*\n\n*https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/1288/preserve-bash-history-in-multiple-terminal-windows\n\nA: History from all shell sessions is less useful than I hoped!\nI enthusiastically set PROMPT_COMMAND='history -a; history -r' in the hopes that my history usage would be much better!\nWow, was I disappointed.\nEssentially, doing this makes up/dn arrow useless.  Because now each history session is littered with commands from other sessions.  And for me this loses the best feature of history.\nWhat I really wanted\nOccasionally, I wanted to essentially transfer my history from one terminal session to another session so I could easily recall commands from that session.  And I can do this very selectively.\nWhat I did\nI set up a series of simple history manipulation aliases & I ignore these commands in the history:\nalias ha=\"history -a\"\nalias hb=\"history -a; history -r\"\nalias hr=\"history -r\"\nalias hl=\"history | tail -20\"\nHISTIGNORE=\"ha:hb:hr:hl\"\n\nI think of hb as history blend...the others are self-explanatory.\nNow when I want to copy my history from session A to session B, I can do this:\n\n*\n\n*A: ha - append session A history to history file\n\n*B: hb - append session B history to history file and then read the file\n\nThis essentially preserves the history order for session B and adds session A history deeper in the list.\nSuper useful for me.  Maybe helps you too!\n\nA: See also \"keeping persistent history in bash\" for another alternative. It rigs your prompt to send all commands ever typed into any terminal into a \"persistent history\" file (alongside what's usually done for the regular .history). \n\nA: To show history from all terminals:\nAdd export PROMPT_COMMAND='history -a; history -r' to your .bashrc file.\nSource: http://northernmost.org/blog/flush-bash_history-after-each-command\n\n", "Q: How to save installer file while downloading from ubuntu software center? Can anyone tell me (if this is possible) how can I save the installer file of a software which I download via Ubuntu software center...\nI'm new to Ubuntu so give me answer that is understood by me.\n\nA: Ubuntu uses deb archives and when you download to install from Software Center all the packages are cached on /var/cache/apt/archives. Basically what you need to do is to copy it somewhere else or in an external backup drive. So in your folder navigate to /var/cache/apt/archive. You can do this doing Ctrl+L and typing the location and just copy all the *.deb packages to somewhere else.\nOther than that if you are cozy with command line you can just do:\ncp -r /var/cache/apt/archives /your/destination\n\nYour destination should be writable, i.e you should be able to make folder and files on the location where you copy the debs.\nIf you want to install softwares on another Ubuntu you can just do sudo cp -r /you/destination/*.deb /var/cache/apt/archives.\n\nA: Downloaded packages are automatically saved in /var/cache/apt/archives\n\nA: If you want to install those app you should type this command for it:\nsudo cp -r /you/destination/*.deb /var/cache/apt/archives. \n\nBut I'm wondering if this command will install all of the applications in that folder?\n\nA: Try to download APTonCD.

Was just wondering if there is any solid data available as to how many people are using ubuntu. I was also interested in the attrition rate with ubuntu users, etc.\n\nA: I think in most markets we're still around the 1-2% mark. People don't tend to like that stat. They want it to be 10% and try to swing sales stats around like they mean something, but I've made several logical arguments for ~1% on my blog.\nNeither Canonical or Ubuntu counts its users. Downloads are not centralised by design so there's no way to count downloads. Because there aren't licenses there aren't sales to count and even if there were, we're dealing with free software. Downloads don't translate into installs or users. It could try a phone-home counter to do that but to but that would frankly be suicide (omgprivacy!), and there are still derivative users (Kubuntu, Lubuntu, Xubuntu, etc) who wouldn't be counted with an Ubuntu-only solution.\nSo while it's impossible to get exact numbers on these things, we can get some number from clients of various services. These give us a relative number (like 1%).\n\n\n*\n\n*Web browsers give out their OS when they visit a site. There are problems with this data but if you look at the stats for the right website, most of the biases pale away. Here's a maintained collection of statistics from browsers.\n\n*Steam publishes hardware survey data which includes \"OS Version\". This is obviously geared to gaming so only really represents the percentage of Linux users in amongst Steam users.\n\n\nA: According to the Ubuntu homepage at http://www.ubuntu.com/ there are at at least 20 million users that use Ubuntu every day. Las year Ubuntu estimated that there were around 12 million people that they \"know\" of. So its great to see such a big increase!\n\nA: It is obviously not possible to provide solid data, since everyone can distribute Ubuntu for free (e.g. via a CD). Canonical (as one distributor) has therefore no way to know the exact number. (As a note: even companies like Microsoft might only know the number of legal owers of their software, but never the number of users). \nWhat you can get are indicators of the number. You can estimate the percentage of Ubuntu users which are online with the default software configuration and multiply that by the number of registered website accesses that identify Ubuntu users, and multiply this by the percentage of those Ubuntu users who might have visited those websites. \nSimilar ways are applied in most estimates that you can read on somewhere on the internet. Often unique IP addresses are counted on security update repositories, but since I run an ubuntu server on strato, where all updates are always coming from strato servers, Canonical would never be able to include that server in any statistic. Also, since that server never browses on any websites, estimates from statcounter or similar will never track that installation. So again: no way to get to a solid number. Only estimates (and plenty of them)...\n(I am very confident to say however, that we will have 200 million users in the next 4 years :-)\n\nA: 40M desktop users in 2015 according to ubuntu.com\nhttps://insights.ubuntu.com/about/ (archive) said 40M on desktop on 2015 Q3\nI could not find the methodology.\nMark was a bit too optimistic about the 200M in 2015, but we'll get there eventually.\n\nA: The figures for Ubuntu users worldwide in 2020 vary depending on the sources some of which are more up-to-date than others.

Without a doubt, there are over a billion people on the planet benefiting from the services, security, and availability of Ubuntu today.\n\n\nA: There's a website, called, \"The Linux Counter,\" where you can register as a Linux user and also register the information about your system.\nWhen I am posting this answer 39,506 machines registered for ubuntu distro. \nNo mailing lists or anything, it seems, if you choose to register. Once you register, you get a cool little Linux logo, showing you as a registered Linux user, with your registered user number.\nFrom the website, you can see a breakdown by country, state and city, as to how many registered Linux users there are in each place. Also, you can see how long Linux boxes have been up without a reboot. \nThese are my details :\nRegistered Linux User #501089\nRegistered Ubuntu User #30648\n\nThere is another site which allows to register Ubuntu users separately. I am 30648th Ubuntu user. Currently the ubuntu counter website is offline. \n", "Q: Where are the LXDE sound preferences? I'm confused,how can I change the sound output in LXDE? There's not even a single option anywhere unlike other environments.\nI've tried doing anything with alsamixerbut still nothing, the output device is the HDMI audio of a Radeon HD card.\nEdit: As it Turns out i was able to change the ouput device, but i had to use Gnome for that and its Gnome Sound applet, that is log out and log in once in Gnome change the device, log out and log back in LXDE.\nNow the question becomes Why can't i do this in LXDE?\n\nA: xfce4-mixer\nLubuntu shares many components with XFCE.  My suggestion would be to use the XFCE4-Mixer.  This still gives you a lightweight solution compatible with the lxde ethos.\n\nto install\nsudo apt-get install xfce4-mixer gstreamer0.10-alsa\n\nThis installs the following limited number of xfce packages -\nexo-utils libgarcon-1-0 libgarcon-common libwnck-common libwnck22 libxres1\n  xfce4-mixer xfce4-panel\n\nto run\ntype xfce4-mixer in a lxterminal\nIn Options Auto-Mute Mode\nIt should be set as Disabled.\n\npavucontrol\nSlightly more heavyweight - you could install pulseaudio and thus use the pulseaudio packages such as pavucontrol \n\nto install\nsudo apt-get install pulseaudio pavucontrol\n\nThis installs the following pulseaudio packages:\ngstreamer0.10-pulseaudio libasound2-plugins libspeexdsp1\n  pulseaudio-esound-compat pulseaudio-module-x11 pulseaudio-utils rtkit\n\nto run\ntype pavucontrol in a lxterminal\n\nA: First of all, try lspci and lsusb to check if the device you need is seen by the system.\nSecondly in alsamixer try pressing F6, which will let you choose the sound card (I really don't know if this is needed tbh).\nAnd another tip for alsamixer: it doesn't show all parameters when u start it, some are hidden on the right so you just have to go to the right to see them all, I believe there is an output chooser. And also in alsa see if you are viewing the needed items (F5 will show all parameters available).\nHope this helps.\n\nA: I am using Ubuntu 12.04 64bits and I recently installed XFCE-4 Desktop.\nWhen I first logged in xfce-4 I noticed there was no sound at all (Rythmbox, games, etc).\nAnd I found no icon anywhere to adjust the sound.\nThis is how I did to fix the problem :\n1) Go to the applications menu > Sound & Video > Mixer.\n2) In the Sound Card option menu, select Playback: Built-in Audio Analog Stereo (PulseAudio Mixer).\n3) The playback window may be empty. Click on \"Select Controls...\" , enable/check Master then close.\n4) Unmute the sound icon just under the volume bar.\nI guess you need to check whether you are using PulseAudio or Alsa drivers. This should not change the fact you need to uncheck mute icon in your \"Playback: Audio stereo\" in Mixer. \nI hope this can help :-)\nPS : I am a newbie in linux stuff, so please correct me if I said something wrong.\n\nA: This is what i did to fix the no audio issue in my ASUS laptop:\nsudo apt-get install xfce4-mixer gstreamer0.10-alsa\n\nThis installs the following limited number of xfce packages:\nexo-utils libgarcon-1-0 libgarcon-common libwnck-common libwnck22 libxres1 xfce4-mixer xfce4-panel\n\nTo run, type xfce4-mixer in a lxterminal.\nIn Options: \nAuto-Mute Mode : Disabled (changed enabled to disabled)\n\nA: Lubuntu recently switched from the LXDE desktop environment to LXQt. So while not literally answering this LXDE question, in the spirit of it here's an answer for Lubuntu â¥18.10:\nÂ \nYou can use pavucontrol-qt, a Qt based implementation of the pavucontrol PulseAudio mixer mentioned in the other answer here. This fits nicely into the Qt-based desktop environment LXQt of the recent Lubuntu versions.\npavucontrol-qt is the default mixer application that can be opened via the volume adjustment panel widget (though you can also configure a different one there). For some reason, it was not installed on my system (maybe because I always install Ubuntu first and then Lubuntu packages on top?). Anyway, you can install it with:\nsudo apt install pavucontrol-qt\n\nIn the application, you can choose the sound output device under \"Output Devices â Port\".\n", "Q: Lost access to the unity interface how to fix?  o.k, this is embarrassing:\nI have installed Compiz Config Settings Manager and tried to fix it so that the transition time between changing tabs (using alt+tab) will be short.  by accident I un-pressed V from something else, and it asked me about a conflict - I pressed the \"x\" button to close the window and as a result I stopped seeing the unity interface.

I would like to clarify some details of the derivation earned from the sale of application money. If I understood correctly, at the end of each quarter you will send us email to report the amount of earned us money. After that we will send you requisites on which you will send money by bank transfer. Am I right?\n\nA: To clarify - Canonical will send a report within 30 days after the end of each quarter. Canonical will also send payment within 30 days after the end of each quarter (usually simultaneously - unless payment questions arise).\nThe TOS (click through agreement) states that Canonical will send a report, the developer will return a invoice, and Canonical will pay that invoice. This is the procedure, however Canonical has streamlined the process to what is stated above (send report, send payment immediately thereafter).\nIf a payment or report issue arises, you can reply to the report sender or contact me directly for resolution.\n\nA: Citet from the Commercial Software FAQ:\n\nPayment\nHow do I get paid for the sales of my application?\n  Currently, we pay all publishers on a quarterly basis. \n  Following publishing of your application weâll contact you for confirmation of\n  your invoice details. Weâll then pay you electronically, via bank\n  transfer for PayPal, each quarter. In the future weâll introduce\n  monthly automated payment. \nHow will I receive my money?\nYouâll receive an invoice and your payments on a quarterly basis. \n  We pay the publisher either by electronic bank transfer or through\n  PayPal. For Paypal payments weâll pay the registered address thatâs\n  associated with your account in the Developer Portal.\n\nSo it seems to me that you will give the payment details directly following the publishing of the software. It does not seem like you give the details after each quarter report.\nIf you need more and official information, you might want to ask Canonical directly. \n", "Q: Broadcom BCM4312 Not Working I have a HP MINI 210-1010NR and just installed Ubuntu 11.04 and I can't get my wireless to work.

A\n  reference clock source that relays UTC (Coordinated Universal Time)\n  time and has little or no delay is known as a stratum-0 device.\n  Stratum-0 servers cannot be used on the network, instead, they are\n  directly connected to computers which then operate as primary time\n  servers.\nA primary server that receives a time signal from a stratum 0 device\n  either through the GPS network or national time and frequency\n  transmission is known as a stratum-1 device. On a network a stratum 1\n  time server supplies the time to other devices on the network which\n  are known as stratum-2 devices. These also can be used as a time\n  source and equipment that connects to a stratum-2 device to receive it\n  become stratum-3 and so on.\nNTP can handle up to 16 different stratum levels, although the lower\n  down the hierarchy you go the less accurate the devices become.\n\n\nHere is a Q&A that describes how to set it up:\nHow do I set Ubuntu to use the primary time server time.nist.gov?\nThe settings are in /etc/ntp.conf and there is only a few changes that need to be made.  \nFirst is to comment out the lines that specify the pools.\nThen add this line instead:\n\n", "Q: Difference between commands What is the difference between the following?\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nand\ndpkg --get-selections | grep -v deinstall > ubuntu-files\n\nplus\nsudo dpkg --set-selections < ./ubuntu-files\nsudo apt-get -y update\nsudo apt-get -u dselect-upgrade\n\n\nA: The 1st part is just a normal update/upgrade.\nThe last part is about saving your package list and restoring them into a new system.\nLet's say you have a crashed system and can get to a commandprompt.\npkg --get-selections|grep -v deinstall>ubuntu-files makes a file list of all installed packages (when using apt-get!).

I know I can enter any character I need using the character-map applet, but that means grabbing the mouse/opening the \"run\" dialog, switching to another window, selecting the character, copying... you get the idea.

In my specific case I'm using a laptop with the Italian keyboard layout, but I suspect a general solution exists.\n\nA: Looks like I should have done my homework.\nPlenty of informationon the ubuntu wiki. In my specific case probably the quickest way is Unicode composition since combinations with the acute accent are kind of difficult, the acute accent being an alt-gr combination itself in the italian keyboard layout.\nUpdate: the simplest answer I found is to just turn on Caps Lock. When caps lock is on every accented character you enter is automagically uppercased.\n\nA: A lot of accented characters can be written using the \"compose key\".

There are many keys there that you will probably never use in Linux, so just replace one of them.\nWhen you have it set, you can press the compose key and other keys (in order) and it will combine them.  For example, Compose â ' â A = Ã and Compose â ` â a = Ã .  There are tables for which combinations result in which characters online.

Number of existing partitions - 5 C drive - label\n  windows - 160GB - has windows 7 installed D drive - label linux -\n  160GB - does not have any data E drive - label backup - 100GB - has\n  some data F drive - label entertainment - 100GB  - has some data G\n  drive - label work - 90GB  - has some data All of the above are in\n  NTFS format.\n\n\n\n*In the screen that follows, an image is shown with 2 parts and each part is shown to have size equal to 80GB. There is a horizontal slider in the middle of these two images, with which I can resize the partitions. The right side partition is labeled Linux.\nThere is also an option to do 'advanced partitions'.\n\n*On clicking advanced partitions on the above screen, a new screen is shown in which the partitions existing in my computer are shown - but the labels are different. I see that there are two partitions with size = 160GB each (as expected), and so I assumed that the first 160GB would be my existing C drive and the second on would be the partition which I had labeled as linux (drive D). So I selected the linux partition and clicked on proceed/ install now, and then this error was shown -\n\"No root file system defined\".. and I cannot proceed after this.\nPlease let me know two things here:\n\n\n*\n\n*During the screen in point number 3 above, the image with slider was shown. Which partition (drive c: or d: or anyother) is being referred to here? Which one am I actually resizing - is it the existing c: drive which has windows 7 installed already, that is getting shrunk and then ubuntu getting installed in the remaining space?\n\n*What does \"\"No root file system defined\" error mean? How do I select the proper partition and continue with the installation? \nP.S.:\nI had already partitioned my drives as mentioned above, and the D drive with 160GB was specifically left free for installing ubuntu. I would like to Select D drive during setup and install ubuntu here, while still keeping the already installed windows7 in C drive.\nThanks!\n\nA: To anyone who stumbles acorss this question...this was my solution.\nsudo apt-get remove dmraid\n\n\nA: Make sure that the partition file system you wish to install Linux, Ubuntu or Backtrack on it is ext4, ext3 or ext2, and not FAT32 or NTFS. \nThen mount / on it:\n\n\n*\n\n*During the installation process press \"change\" on the partition you wish to use\n\n*Make sure \"do not use this partition\" scroll is not chosen, scroll to ext4, ext3 or ext2\n\n*On the \"mount\" field write /\n\n*Click ok, then next a message will appear saying something like \"swap area was not defined, do you wish to continue or choose a swap area?\", click \"ok\" and continue or click \"go back\" and choose another partition and click change, on the file system scroll choose \"swap\" and click \"ok\" and next\nThis will solve both \"no root file system is defined\" and the \"swap area\" message, if you still get the swap area message then on step 4 mount /swap to the partition\n\nA: You must create a swap partition and space for the filesystem (ext4) partition with the  '/' sign as the root filesystem.\n\nA: To answer your first question, the partition proposed to be split on the first screen was your windows partition.  Since you already have created a partition for Ubuntu, you don't want to do that.\nYou say that you selected the partition on the advanced screen, but simply clicking on it does nothing; you need to click on the edit button and assign the partition a filesystem type ( use ext4 ) and mount point.\nThe error is because you did not assign any filesystem to be mounted in the root directory ( / ) and therefore, there is nowhere to install to.\n\nA: If you find yourself having a empty partition list during the installation, you might have a problem with the dmraid module which is loaded if your system has an RAID controller (build in). \nI had this issue during the installation and after pressing Ctrl+Alt+F1 to switch to the console, ran this command:\nsudo apt-get remove dmraid\n\nswitched back (Ctrl+Alt+F7), I could continue the installation and had my partitions listed. \n\nA: Ubuntu, or any Linux distro for that matter, requires at least two partitions to run. One is called swap and is used as swap space for virtual memory. It is not mounted any where. The other partition is used for root file system and is mounted to / i.e root of the file system tree. If you are not familiar with the linux filesystem and dont know what mounting means in context of linux then plz read this. It will help you understand these concepts.\nNow about the error that you see. It is because you are not defining any partition for the root file system. As you have said that you are a new user, I would recommend that you just simply delete the partition that you have reserved for Linux (using windows) and then while installing Ubuntu select to use all available free space for Linux.\n\nA: continuing from @binW's answer, \nIf you are ready for some adventure, which might become a nightmare if proper caution is not followed.\n\n\n\nYou need to define the mount point specifically as / for it to function as root file system.\n\nSwap you can keep, but literature tell you to keep it!! FYI, I don't have a swap.\nImage source\n\nA: Maybe you have a problem with the ISO you downloaded.

If you use -execdir instead of -exec, the specified command is run from the subdirectory containing the matched file. So, instead of passing the whole path to rename, it only passes ./filename. That makes it much easier to write the replace command.\nfind /the/path -type f \\\n               -name '*_one.txt' \\\n               -execdir rename 's/\\.\\/(.+)_one\\.txt$/$1_two.txt/' {} \\;\n\nIn detail:\n\n\n*\n\n*-type f means only look for files, not directories\n\n*-name '*_one.txt' means means only match filenames that end in _one.txt\n\n*In this answer, I'm using the rename command instead of mv. rename uses a Perl regular expression to rename each file.\n\n*The backslashes after -type and -name are the bash line-continuation character. I use them to make this example more readable, but they are not needed in practice.\n\n*However, the backslash at the end of the -execdir line is required. It is there to esacpe the semicolon, which terminates the command run by -execdir. Fun!\n\n\nExplanation of the regex:\n\n\n*\n\n*s/ start of the regex\n\n*\\.\\/ match the leading ./ that -execdir passes in. Use \\ to escape the . and / metacharacters\n\n*(.+) match the start of the filename. The parentheses capture the match for later use\n\n*_one\\.txt match \"_one.txt\", escape the dot metacharacter\n\n*$ anchor the match at the end of the string\n\n*/ marks the end of the \"match\" part of the regex, and the start of the \"replace\" part\n\n*$1 references the existing filename, because we captured it with parentheses. If you use multiple sets of parentheses in the \"match\" part, you can refer to them here using $2, $3, etc.\n\n*_two.txt the new file name will end in \"_two.txt\". No need to escape the dot metacharacter here in the \"replace\" section\n\n*/ end of the regex\n\n\nBefore\ntree --charset=ascii\n\n|-- a_one.txt\n|-- b_one.txt\n|-- Not_this.txt\n`-- dir1\n    `-- c_one.txt\n\nAfter\ntree --charset=ascii\n\n|-- a_two.txt\n|-- b_two.txt\n|-- Not_this.txt\n`-- dir1\n    `-- c_two.txt\n\n\nHint: rename's -n option is useful. It does a dry run and shows you what names it will change, but does not make any changes.\n\nA: find . -name '*.txt' -print0 | xargs -0 -n1 bash -c 'mv \"$0\" \"${0/oldname/newname}\"'\nObviously, that rename pattern is just a simple example, but beware that as is it will edit the whole path, not just the filename.\n\nA: You could explore the plethora of choices available:\n`$ apt-cache search rename | grep -i rename` \n\n", "Q: Why did Apache stop working after adding two sites?

Apache will look for this in the URL line, so for mercurial  you'd have to go to\nhttp://mercurial.server/....\nAnd for redmine you have to go to\nhttp://myservername/...\nSince you want them both to live in the same hostname, you probably just need one VirtualHost tag to define the DocumentRoot and desired ServerName, and then the aliases and such that you want under that host.

Grub places some files in the /boot directory, which usually is on the same partition as /.  It also embeds its core image to the Master Boot Record of the drive, and the following several sectors that are not part of any partition, so in that sense, it is not installed to any partition, but rather to the whole disk.\nYou can check the output of df to see what partitions you have mounted where.

It seems that the X Window System started, but Unity did not start?\nHow can I debug this?\n\nA: Solved it.\nIn my case, I was running the proprietary ATI drivers (fglrx) for my ATI/Radeon graphics card. At some point during the upgrade, Ubuntu installed the open source ati/radeon drivers. However, these two drivers cannot exist alongside one another  See bug 285603.\nFrom what I can tell, the proprietary ATI drivers cause problems with Xorg especially if they exist alongside the opensource ATI drivers.\nThis is a common problem, and the steps are pretty well documented.\nTo fix this, I uninstalled the proprietary ATI drivers (fglrx) using these instructions. I had to use the section called \"Problem: Need to fully remove -fglrx and reinstall -ati from scratch\".\nThen, I installed the open-source ATI drivers instead. The open-source drivers are called 'ati' or 'radeon'. I followed these instructions:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/RadeonDriver\nIf anyone really wants the proprietary fglrx  driver, you should still consider replacing the proprietary drivers with the Radeon drivers first, so that you can make your system stable first.

They're just referenced to in a text file inside the package.\nYou might want to give this a try:\nhttp://www.webupd8.org/2011/12/portable-software-center-create-custom.html\nYou'll still have to install python-glade2 first though.\n\nA: I know...old post (and I wrote a lot, in hopes a reader cares why), but \"greyed out install and remove buttons\" / no reviews / no screen caps wasn't just driving me nuts; it's been annoying a lot of people. There are numerous irrelevant answers and altruistic guesses out there, even advice to give up on Ubuntu Software Center (USC) despite comments that Synaptic can be a good way to screw up your system...because the real issue is that you need USC not to care about the network state (especially when it's clearly wrong).\nThe most common fix appears to be Patches/Update USC/etc, and monitoring for errors by starting USC from a terminal (I had none), but for me and many others it looks like it's Network Connections. It didn't help that I answered the installer's \"which interface is your primary\" question thinking it was temporary, which turned out to be permanent (forcing me to edit /etc/network/interfaces), but I installed \"Wicd network manager\" because Network Connections was broken anyway. After this, USC always thought I was offline (so? I should be able to remove stuff, or install downloads). While you can always use the \"File\" menu in USC, it's counterintuitive for it to work when the same buttons are all disabled.\nSkip the following paragraph if you never got a network connection of any sort. \nWith one, you can do a simple sanity check: If you are using another network manager (like Wicd or have edited /etc/network/interfaces) see if Network Connections needs a kick. Right-click its panel icon (an \"up\"/\"down\" arrow side-by-side. Google for how to put it there if it's missing). With USC open, try choosing \"auto\" for whatever interface is working just fine, and viola!--USC immediately enables the \"install\" and \"remove\" buttons. If this breaks your connection, you can use \"dhclient\", restart networking, use the menus, or maybe just restart (I'm not writing a network setup answer, so restarting should put you back where you were).\nRegardless of online or offline, once I knew it was Network Connections, I found a post from Doctoa that says to run this in a terminal:\nsudo stop network-manager\nFrom https://askubuntu.com/users/68386/doctoa at \nUBUNTU's Network Connection Manger can't detect Huawei ETS2051 Modem device!\nIn case this isn't a fix, remember that the \"File\" menu in USC still works despite what Network Connections thinks.\n\nA: I encountered the same problem. Restarting the network manager helped me.\nsudo stop network manager\nsudo start network manager\n\nor simply you can try\nsudo restart network-manager\n\nI use a dongle to connect to the internet. For this I use gnome-ppp. Gnome-ppp do not signals the network manager that the system is connected with the internet. This creates a problem in system application like Software center. So restarting the network manager will surely help you in this case.\n", "Q: Should the root folder (/root) be empty? I have been moving files around to prepare for a remaster. I put some files into root, which I though might help an issue I was having with auto login in live mode.\nanyway, putting files into root changed nothing, thing is I cant remember if root was empty or not when i started so, should the root folder be empty, and if not, what should be in there?\nthanks\n\nA: /root is simply the homedir for the root user.\nBy default, all that should be in there are some dotfiles, like .bashrc and .profile.\n\nA: The folder /root is just the home folder for root. You can think of it being at /home/root for the purposes of working out what should go inside there (i.e. just like a normal user). There will be less 'dotfiles' than other users home folders, since root does not normally use lots of apps that write config files. If root uses firefox (BEWARE: It is dangerous to do so) then the folder /root/.firefox/ will be created. \nThe reason for it being at / instead of /home/ is that it works when stuff fails. The filesystem root (/) should be local, in order to mount other partitions and network shares (e.g. /home on another partition or server).  So when mounting fails and you are left without /home the root user can log in and fix the problems up.\nSo not having anything it will result in settings being reset and the 'dotfiles' being created when you login as root (i.e. as soon as you do anything in bash .bash_history will be created). Not having the folder around at all can cause some problems on logon, and/or mean / is littered with root's files (e.g. .bash_history) as the home folder is (temporarily) set to /.\n", "Q: How to make NFS mounts available while offline?

Is there a GUI settings manager for Mutter? Something where I can adjust the window shadow size, or the hot corners, or opacity, etc...\n\nA: Mutter is lean and mean by design, and is for sure way less configurable than Compiz. That's a choice made by the GNOME designers, who place simplicity and maintainability above configurability.\n\n\n*\n\n*If deep customization is your thing, the best answer is probably \"don't use Metacity/Mutter\". Compiz is one of your possible alternatives, but there is a bajillion of more customizable X window managers that could do the job for you. Try some of them! From what you say, maybe you could start with Enlightenment and Openbox. And Compiz, yes.\n\n*If for some other reason you really want mutter, the grand total of settings you can adjust is 5, managed through the GConf infrastructure (soon migrated to DConf) and declared in a XML schema located at /usr/share/gconf/schemas/mutter.schemas.

I've seen some people complaining about how unstable CompizConfig Settings Manager (\"CCSM\") is and how it can break people's desktops if they're not careful.\nWhat are some of the known problems with CCSM? I'd like to decide whether or not it's worth the risk for me.\n\nA: You can also have other plugins conflicting with the unity one, like commands and such.\nWe need to activate them still for the fallback session (like Alt+F2). So unity by default conflicts with other plugins that are enabled.\nHowever, touching such a plugin in ccsm enables special artifacts like \"do you want to remove the unity plugin?\" and people don't read and say yes.\nEven worse:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unity is depending on LargeDestkop:\n\n*Wall and Cube are providing LargeDesktop, each one conflicting with each other.\n\n\nWhat happens is that, if you enable Cube, ccsm will disable Wall. Then compiz thinks it's smart right know to check for dependency and will tell \"oh, I can't have unity\" and disable it. Then, it will enable Cube without reenabling unity which has now its \"LargeDesktop\" requirement matched.\nIn addition to this, compizconfig has a fragile configuration management, which can, in some unknown cases right now, remove a plugin from the current profile (probably due to a conflict check at start or on upgrade) without any warningâ¦\n\nA: I am an experienced Linux user, I've contributed to kernel and work on the Canonical OEM team; I only mention these facts to show my context, which is -- the other day, I did a fresh install of 11.10 on my laptop, and wanted to customize something (turning on focus-follows-mouse). I poked around in gnome-control-center for about 30 minutes before giving up and discovering the only way to do this was using ccsm.\nAfter installing ccsm, I configured ffm, and then -- accidentally! -- my mouse cursor passed over the preferences button and the touchpad on my laptop registered a click.\nBoom!\nUnity session dead.\nLuckily I still had an irc window open and I could beg for help from my colleagues who told me how to recover (rm ~/.compiz-1). This is the same problem some people keep having:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unity 3D doesn't work anymore, just shows a menu on the top\n\n*Unity doesn't load, no Launcher, no Dash appears\n\n*Desktop disappeared after messing with ccsm\nI know that people are going to google for how to configure things and land up here and they're going to see lots of mentions of ccsm; or worse yet from another unreliable source. The horse is out of the barn already, and we can't go back. The determined users are going to find it anyway, and anyone that tenacious deserves to know how to get what they want (and if you break it you get to keep both pieces!)\nBut my point is that from now on, we can try and do better for our users.\n\n\n*\n\n*ccsm is dangerous; even if you know not to touch the bad thing, you might accidentally touch it anyway like I did.\n\n*ccsm has no future; the future plans for Unity are to migrate all the useful configurability bits out of ccsm into safer, supported tools. These tools should start to appear in 12.04.\n\n*the attitude of \"recovering from your mistakes is a positive learning experience\" is niche. Most normal people just want to use their computers without having them randomly break in mysterious, non-recoverable ways; most normal people do not share our culture of taking things apart to see how they work.\n\n\nAgain -- I know that people are going to find the dangerous stuff no matter what. But what we can do here is change our culture and give opinionated help, steering people away from the bad stuff and towards the good stuff.\nIt's easy to convey facts; it's much harder to convey wisdom.\nHere, we should be aiming higher than merely giving the facts of what is possible; we should be sharing the wisdom of what is recommended.\n", "Q: How can I install Photoshop CS5? I copied all of the files like in this tutorial, but I have no luck launching PS. I also tried running the installer with WINE, but needed AIR and it wouldn't connect to the adobe servers.\nAlso, I (think I) removed all of the libraries I installed with winetricks (except for the VC++ ones) and deleted the files I copied from my Windows machine. This is all perfectly safe, right?\n\nA: Install it through Playonlinux but not as effective as in Windows. Open your terminal and type: sudo apt-get install playonlinux and ENTER. Open Playonlinux from you 'Dash Home' and look for Photoshop cs5 or other version you are willing to install to your system and follow instruction on screen.After that go back to your 'Dash Home', click on Photoshop to run it. \nI think Playonlinux has even a patch should in case the program did not run perfectly. It does it better than the others.\n\nA: Photoshop 5 through CS2 and CS4 install and work pretty well on wine. Photoshop CS3 has some issues but most things work.\nHere are some tips you'll need to run Photoshop successfully:\n1). You shouldn't have to copy Photoshop from Windows; just install it under Wine by running its Setup.exe. (To run a .exe under wine, you have to doubleclick it, right click and choose \"Run with Wine\", or run it from the commandline using the 'wine' command, depending on how your Linux distribution integrates Wine.)\n2).Never use a cracked version of Photoshop (this isn't a moralizing thing: the cracks themselves don't work reliably in Wine).\n3).Never run Wine as root.\n4).Use a recent version of Wine (1.1.6 or later).\n5).When installing Photoshop CS2 trial, be sure to enter your name and organization. If you don't, Photoshop's installer gives a confusing error dialog.\n6).Before installing Photoshop CS or CS2, do wget http://kegel.com/wine/winetricks; sh winetricks corefonts vcrun6\n if the above line produces the error *cabextract: command not found* type in `sudo apt-get install cabextract` (Ubuntu/Debian), run, and run the above line again.\n\n7).Before installing Photoshop CS3, do wget http://kegel.com/wine/winetricks; sh winetricks gecko gdiplus (or follow these instructions).\nWhen installing Photoshop CS4, follow these instructions.\nThe Clone tool uses the ALT key in a way that conflicts with many window managers. Here's how to fix that:\nUbuntu or Fedora: Go to System â Preferences â Windows, and under Movement Key, pick \"Super\" instead of \"Alt\".\nIf you have a keyboard with the AltGr key (not many US keyboards have this): duplicating Marquee selections with AltGr+Arrows didn't work, you have to use Ctrl+Alt+Arrows instead\ncompiz plugins might also steal important keystrokes (Ctrl+Arrows, Shift+Arrows, Shift+Ctrl+Arrows, Ctrl+Alt+Arrows) used by Photoshop for moving, cuting und duplicating Marquee selections. For instance, see RotateCube. You might need to disable Compiz or those plugins to use Photoshop properly.\nSome UI elements might use a too-small font. In CS2, you can fix this with Edit / Preferences / General, and change UI Font Size from Small to Medium\n", "Q: How to configure clicking a launcher icon minimizes all related apps Lets say I have 4 terminals opened. If I click the terminal launcher icon it maximizes all terminal windows. If I click again it shows all of them in a windows lists fashion so I can click a specific window from the list to go to it. But how can I click again to minimize/hide them all.\n\nA: Essentially you can't. There is (was) an open bug about this, but the Unity developers/designers marked it as won't fix, despite over 100 people marking it as \"affects me\".

I saw there are similar questions, but I don't think they answer exactly my questions.\nDid anyone managed to get 3D acceleration work under VMWare workstation 8? I have VMware 8.01 installed on Ubuntu 11.10. The guest I am trying is also Ubuntu 11.10.\nI manually installed vmware-tools and it went well, except the X-config part was skipped as it said the distribution driver is used. The guest runs well but it seems fall back to 2D mode.\nDoes any one has any idea how to enable 3D acceleration under VMWare workstaion with Linux guest?\n\nA: VMWare workstation 8 currently does not support 3D acceleration.\n\nA: According to VMware Workstation 8 documentation (Configuring Virtual Machine Hardware Settings Â» Configuring Display Settings) 3D acceleration is only available for Windows XP, Windows Vista, and Windows 7 guests.\n\nA: I'm really sorry about the ambiguous answers that you get from these threads. I figured that you have 3D acceleration checked. It still goes back into fall-back mode, even if you update the kernel.\nInstall the kernel headers, then install VMware Tools. And restart Gnome 3 in terminal, If it still goes into fall-back mode. \nThis method does work in virtual box with the extensions in the same order above. I just think that it is strange that VMware is supposed to be more powerful than virtural box, but it will not run Gnome 3. I see some instabilities in VMware. There is definitely some 3D graphics issues. When running Mac OS 10.7.3, launch pad flickers when sliding the pages to apps, so does the dock a bit. Gnome 3 seems very sensitive to 3D lag. Hopefully Gnome 3.4 is not so demanding for graphical resources.\n\nA: 3D acceleration for Linux guests is only available beginning with VMware Workstation 9.\n\nA: It does. Go to your vhost settings and find the display entry. There is a checkbox to enable 3d acceleration\n", "Q: Safety of installing Ubuntu alongside Windows Is it really safe to choose the \"Install Ubuntu alongside Windows\" option from the Ubuntu installation program?\nI never used that option, instead I used other tools such as partition magic or windows 7's disk tool to resize my partitions.\nSince I'm going to install Ubuntu across a lot windows (XP, Vista and 7) machines.\nIt would not be nice to damage those Windows partitions.\nWhat is your experience?\nCan I use this feature without concerns?\n\nA: Having done this several times, I have never encountered any problems with installing Ubuntu alongside Windows.  It has always worked for me exactly as advertised.  However, I would still never do it without making sure I had backups of all my important data and documents.\nAs for creating new partitions and resizing them, it seems to work extremely well in the Ubuntu installation process, but if you need to move a Windows partition, I would highly recommend doing it with Windows tools; Windows doesn't generally like to be moved.\n\nA: I also just installed Ubuntu from Windows 7 platform; it is quite smooth and you can choose which boot partition you want when you restart either Windows 7 or Ubuntu. Enyoy it!\n\nA: It SHOULD work, but sometimes it has some glitches.  I manually partitioned the hard disk myself, and then let ubuntu CD to install along with windows without paying too much attention to the process.  Of course, I went back and forth for several iterations.  To the end, I was surprised by the numerous number of unused swap partitions.  It turns out the installer automatically re-partitioned my partition, left the swap partition untouched and recreated swap partition with in the linux partition I meant for the root partition.  I went 3 iterations and ended up with 4 swap partitions (one created by me and 3 by installer).  If you are doing the partitioning yourself, you better choice the 3rd option during the installation, telling the installer exactly what partition is for what.  Give too much freedom to the installer can be harmful for the health of your computer. :)\n", "Q: Is there a better way to run ubuntu from usb disk I have an old laptop with a broken hard drive controller and am running the previous ubuntu from a usb.

I think the problem may lie in my graphics, but I'm willing to do anything to fix it.\nIf it helps at all, when I ran the diagnostics my PC failed the \"graphics/display\" category.\n\nA: If you computer hardware diagnostics is failing on the graphics card as you say it is not related to software, Ubuntu or drivers, your hardware is defect.\nKnowing this it is normal that you might have crashes like that: your computer hangs because something really bad happened due to the hardware fault.\nYou should take your computer to a repair shop or if you can do it yourself and its possible you should replace the defect hardware.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you are using an external graphics you should test it with a\ndifferent card (same chipset if possible so you dont need to install\n/ remove drivers), reason for that is that it can be just the card\nbut your motherboard can be the cause instead.\n\n*If you are using an internal graphics card (built-in) you should try\nto replace the RAM you have (since the card uses shared memory with\nRAM) and if that did not help your motherboard needs to be replaced.\n\n", "Q: How can I change the icon of an application in the Unity launcher?

I was using the 2.6 kernels with no problems, but when I updated to the 3.0 kernel, my bootup failed. I can manually boot with ctrl+alt+f1 > startx and my login, but admittedly, i googled this and have no idea what I'm really doing. I have been trying to figure out how to go back to the old version, and eventually figured out the grub menu--i booted from all three 2.6 (.8, .10, and .11) editions of the previous version of ubuntu but they all had the same error as the 3.0 kernal.\nI can get logged in manually once the boot fails, but when i get to my desktop, wireless is not responsive and will not connect, and portable hard drives do not mount and/or are unresponsive.\nthe previous version worked perfectly.\nI use an asus netbook. it's an eee pc. i don't have two OSs on it. i had to go to another computer to get to the forum...\nIf the solution is simple, i just don't know what it is. \n\nA: There is no major difference between \"2.6 kernels\" and 3.0. It's just a number. Talking about 2.6 is not a good idea, since that implies every major version of Linux since 2003. For instance, the difference between 2.6.38 and 2.6.39 is just as significant as the difference between 2.6.39 and 3.0. Actually, Linux 3.0 would have been called 2.6.40 if only Linus Torvalds could count that high. It makes more sense to talk about \"Linux .39\" than \"Linux 2.6\", because the latter means nothing. You can read more about that here: http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2388926,00.asp\nNow, onto your question. You say that you can't boot, but if you can press ctrl+alt+f1 and run startx, then you have already booted the operating system. The fact that your desktop appears when you run startx, tells me that the problem is most likely your display manager. Ubuntu has switched from GDM to LightDM. You may want to replace it. In order to do that, you first install GDM, then open a terminal (or a console in your case) and run sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm. Reboot.

My question is what version of perl language will be in this distribution.\nAnd my second version where can this information be found.\n\nA: I assume you meant 12.04 LTS. 11.04 is not a LTS, the previous LTS is 10.04.\nAccording to http://packages.ubuntu.com/precise/perl, Ubuntu 12.04 will have Perl 5.14.2. On the same site you'll find other packages. Do note that packages are directly copied from Debian until 29th December 2011 according to the Release Schedule for 12.04.\n", "Q: Is it possible to downgrade 11.10 kernel version to 2.6? Is it possible to downgrade the kernel (oneiric) to the version used by 10.10? \n\nA: Seeing that your mean reason is overheating, I'd suggest installing Precise Pangolin A1.\nIt is the current development version, but seeing it's for an LTS version it will mainly see bug fixes and ironing out the flaws.

If I install compiz fusion via terminal, will it be the 0.8 version, or the latest one, which is 0.9.6? \n\nA: It is the old 0.8 series. At the moment it is 0.8.6 as pointed out by Takkat.\n\nA: Jason, knowing the real reason you want to do this, from your previous questions, let me first give you a warning before answering. Compiz 0.8.x is not maintained any more (beyond simple bug fixes). As I have said over and over and over... Compiz-fusion is dead, and the project is now called Compiz.\nThat said, if you install 10.10, you will be getting Compiz 0.8.6 (it is installed by default, you don't have to install Compiz from the terminal on any version of Ubuntu since 7.10!). However, while some of the plugins you are so excited about may work, many of them will cause Compiz to become unstable, crash, and God knows what else (I'm speaking from experience, not just from guessing - I used to run just about every plugin I could find).\nAgain let me reiterate some things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Compiz fusion is dead and it is now Compiz.\n\n*Compiz 0.8.6 is not maintained, and 0.9.x plugins will not work with it (and vice versa).\n\n*You do not have to use Unity in 11.10 or 11.04. You can install another desktop environment like XFCE or GNOME Classic.\n\n*Installing unsupported plugins is not recommended for someone with little Linux experience in general - you might (pretty much will) break things you can't fix.\n\n*No one is taking your choice away, but I would rather warn you harshly than let you jump off a bridge.\n\n\nThat said - if you want to go ahead, you can install 10.10. Just remember that half of what you wanted to do according to your other questions might end up breaking the system if you don't know what you are doing.\n", "Q: $TERM set to \"dumb\" causes problems with suspend I've just upgraded from 11.04 to 11.10. So far I love it, everything seems just so much snappier.\nNow I just have one minor issue.

However somehow when the 00clear command is executed $TERM is set to \"dumb\".\nTwo questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*What is the correct value for $TERM when running 00clear script?\n\n*Where can I set it up?\n\n\nI've looked for solutions on the web, however I could only find information on how to configure $TERM in a regular terminal (and this one is set properly).\n\nA: You could put your TERM setting in a tiny script fragment in /etc/profile.d/setTERM:  \n# Set TERM to something reasonable  \nTERM=<whatever>  \nexport TERM  \n\nfor <whatever>, reading man clear should have led you to man terminfo, which shows you how to pick a terminal type.  \nSet TERM to one of the filenames in /usr/share/terminfo/*/*, so clear will be able to look up a sequence of characters to output to \"clear the screen\".  \nIt is worrying if /usr/share/terminfo is empty.\nMy system shows:  \nwalt@wombat:~(0)$ dpkg -S /usr/share/terminfo  \nncurses-term, ncurses-bin: /usr/share/terminfo  \nwalt@wombat:~(0)$ apt-cache search ncurses-term\\|ncurses-bin  \nncurses-bin - terminal-related programs and man pages  \nncurses-term - additional terminal type definitions  \n\nI think that one or both of these packages are needed for clear to be happy.\n", "Q: Gnome Shell running applications in Unity?

If I create a gradient between two similar colours in Inkscape and export it to a png it looks something like this:\n\nIf you look closely you can see rings.\nIf I create a gradient in GIMP, there's the option to use dithering to prevent such rings or lines.\nHow do I convert my svg to a png using dithering for gradients?\n\nA: Try Gimp \"Spread\" filter (Filter > Noise > Spread) with 40px value for your sample\nI found it in a comment in Inkscape bug tracker and it produces great results IMHO\n\nA: \nWell, I don't know how you expect dither to work, but usually you dither hires signal to lores, while you seem to expect to dither lores, which can't work of course. \n\nYeah, no.\nDithering in gradients is not done for reasons of resolution, but for reasons of bit-rate. You get banding effects because InkScape's export to PNG incorrectly rounds down the (floating-point) RGB values of the interpolated gradient to 8-bit values (256 steps).\nThis results in a very annoying and noticeable type of banding noise (as opposed to aliasing noise which would be the case if we were talking about resolution). Applying dither is a form of noise-shaping, which doesn't reduce the noise but spreads it out in spatial domain so it doesn't correlate into noticeable shapes any more (I'll spare you the signal theory).\nYour \"solution\" of applying the spread noise filter in GIMP really is no better than someone encountering jagged edges in line-art, asking directly about the anti-aliasing option, and telling them to apply a Gaussian blur!\nConsider: A photo, reduced to 4 colours with no dither, and a spread noise filter applied afterwards. A photo reduced to 4 colours with dither. Which one looks better?\nHow do you \"hide\" jagged edges -> blur.\nHow do you solve jagged edges -> anti aliasing when rendering.\nHow do you \"hide\" banding in gradients -> spread noise, etc (there's better tricks but you always end up throwing away fidelity).\nHow do you SOLVE banding in gradients -> apply dithering during render!\nSo yeah, I can actually understand the attitude, when asking how to solve a problem, being told to sort of brush it under the carpet. That's not a solution for a serious graphics designer. \nI'm currently wrestling with the same problem. The question also was perfectly clear, I know because I arrived at this page looking for the same answer. What I'm trying to do is applying a slight layer of noise with a filter or extension in InkScape, which is hopefully applied before rendering, bumping the rounding error around a bit, resulting in a not-optimal but better-than-nothing poor man's noise-shaper. But at least it'll preserve the detail that doesn't require dither :)\n\nA: Please don't consider this as answer. I'm writing it as answer as writing comment is limiting\nThis seems to be known problem with Inkscape. Quick googling showed to me:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Patching source (0.48.0), then compiling Inkscape  \n\n*Applying some filter (by editing /usr/share/inkscape/filters/filters.svg) like posted here or here, which is BTW useless on your sample  \n\n*Additionally search the web for resolving Inkscape gradient banding problem  \n\n*Try other tool if possible  \nI'll just add that last step is my suggestion and while you could try Xara or sK1 it seems to me that only commercial tools (CorelDraw, Illustrator...) offer flawless features, which has to be indeed considered when doing serious work, as you won't like things like this happen after rendering\nCheers\n", "Q: gnome 3 fallback switch missing I just upgraded to Ubuntu 11.10 and installed Gnome-shell, but the Fallback switch in settings is missing.

When I try to install the package bindfs in 11.10 it complains that it can't find the package fuse. How can I install bindfs?\n\nA: This is a known packaging 11.10 bug for the bindfs package that remains unresolved.\nWorkaround 1. Dummy fuse package\nNote that this requires a bit of fiddling, and the link below is in German. However, it does not suffer from the drawbacks of the second workaround. (Thanks to bmhm for this solution. If you can translate the link, feel free to edit this answer and include the translation here.)\n\n[This workaround] will not interfere with any other packages. A quick and clean solution is to install a virtual package \"fuse\", which depends on fuse-utils.\nCheck my blog on how to create such a package:\n  http://blog.bmarwell.de/2012/01/10/ubuntu-bindfs-mit-abhangigkeit-von-fuse-installieren/\n  (the first grey box contains the control file content)\n\nWorkaround 2. Alternate version of bindfs\nYou will need to find and install a version of bindfs that does not depend on fuse. For example, a .deb from a trusted source. However, it will not automatically upgrade should a new version come along. Two packages that seem trustworthy have been added to the comment of the original bug:\n\n\n*\n\n*32-bit version\n\n*64-bit versions\n\n\nDownload the one that matches your system and double-click it. It will open in Software Centre. Install it. bindfs will now work. (It will also appear greyed out in Update Manager from this point forward. A small price to pay IMHO :) )\nChoosing a workaround\nWorkaround 1 requires more work, but will be upgraded if a solution is ever made. Workaround 2 requires less work, but will not be upgraded. If you pick workaround 2, you could subscribe to the bug on Launchpad, and you will be notified if it is closed.\nThis issue appears to be resolved in 12.04 LTS (tested in Beta 1). I'm not sure how either workaround will fare when upgrading to 12.04. Be prepared to purge and reinstall bindfs.\n", "Q: Middle mouse click emulation on trackpad, how can I set it?

Apache is restarting successfully. Apache just isn't sure where you want serve from, so it's choosing your localhost by default. To prevent this message from appearing, clarify that you want to serve from localhost by adding the following line into your /etc/apache2/apache2.conf file:\nServerName localhost\n\n", "Q: Install ubuntu on pendrive and use remaining disk space to store files, instead of persistence file Is there any way where I can install Ubuntu on my pendrive / USB stick, and then have my files, settings, etc. saved across reboots?\nI want the files to be easily accessible from other computers, so they should be directly on the pendrive partition, not inside a persistence file. That way, I can use my computer to copy files to /home/ubuntu/Desktop and then be able to see them on my desktop when I boot from the pendrive. This is how Puppy Linux works if you install it on an ext2/3/4 filesystem.\nIf it's not possible, then can I create another partition on my pendrive an use it for /home/ubuntu in my live system?\n\nA: You can build a flash drive using persistent partitions not limited to the 4GB of FAT32 files.\nPartition an 8GB or larger drive first half FAT32, second half ext2, label the ext2 partition casper-rw, (you can make a third partition named home-rw if you want a seperate home).\nInstall to the first partition using usb-creator, (Startup Disk Creator), or UNetbootin, allowing minimum persistence space. when done delete the casper-rw file located in root.\nTo make a folder easily accessable from other computers, create a folder in filesystem/cdrom. You will see this folder in the flash drive root when plugged into a running Linux or Windows computer.\nYou can not access the casper-rw file where /home/ubuntu/Desktop is located from a Windows machine, (easily).\n", "Q: Unable to add 100hz output with xrandr My TV supports 100/120hz output.

You can change from grouped to ungrouped icons by right clicking on the example toolbar and selecting \"ungroup.\"  This change will make the menu a little more unruly, but the change will also remove the smiley button that has alt-s hot-keyed to open smileys up.

Unfortunately, it seems that the problem is with 11.10 itself, as Firefox, Chromium, and various other programs crash for no reason, flash crashes and I still get chucked out of Ubuntu. Is there any way I can make this more stable, or should I just give in and go to 10.04? \nIn fact, Chromium just crashed while I was typing this up. What can I do?\nUPDATE\nHardware: HP Pavilion with a Snapper MoBo, Running BIOS 3.08, with a 2.66GHz Celeron (32-bit), 2GB SDRAM with a GeForce 5200 GFX Card\nGPU is running the latest driver, according to the additional drivers app.\nUPDATE #2\nMemtest returned a pass without errors, so it appears that the RAM is clean.\nUPDATE #3\nI thought I had it cracked - for a few days, everything worked fine, now just about every program is subject to random shut downs, the desktop vanishes a lot, the unity start menu thing disappears all the time when I'm using it and in Gnome, the desktop keeps crashing out - much as Windows explorer might do if it had some problems. I've decided to go back to 10.04 as there doesn't seem to be a way to get back to 11.04. Failing that, it's back to M$ - I don't like it, but at least it works.\n\nA: I think you need to do a fresh install of Ubuntu 11.10. Personally I have found 11.10 to be more stable than 11.04. However, 10.04 should be the most stable.\nHave you installed the restricted drivers for your graphics card?\n\nA: Do you dual boot? If so how stable is windows? \nIf you don't dual boot and you don't mind the hassle I would do a clean install of 10.04 or something. If that is unstable then you may have hardware problems. Checking out your ram is usually a good start\nIf 10.04 is stable then as suggested have you installed /not installed some drivers?\n\nA: My experience (as a IT consultant with almost 10 years of linux experience) with Ubuntu 11.10 is - sadly - the same. I have tried it this month (jan '12) and I had it showing strange behaviour within 1 hour. \nI advise the LTS releases of Ubuntu as they prove the most stable of all. In general, the non-LTS ubuntu releases are not for the faint hearted :)\nIn my case, I went back to Arch Linux. This distribution is for more experienced users but allowing to build your environment of choice (not limited to unity or gnome3) using the pacman package manager.\nChris\n", "Q: Why is this in my fstab /dev/mapper/cryptswap1?

So you might not be able at all to know if Fn is pressed, since no part of the OS or BIOS is able to see it. If this is not the case, then the BIOS might be able to see that this key was pressed. Some hardware manufacturers provide software that can be used to modify the behaviour of the Fn key this way (e.g. Toshibas Fnesse).\nSo: in general there is no way to know that Fn was pressed and the scancode and the keycode of key-combinations including Fn depends on the individual keyboard design.\n", "Q: Wacom Bamboo CTH-670 is not detected I've a Wacom Bamboo Create Pen Tablet (CTH-670) which is not detected by the system settings, ubuntu 11.10\nuname -r 3.0.0-13-generic-pae\n\nBus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub\nBus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub\nBus 003 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub\nBus 004 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub\nBus 003 Device 002: ID 046d:c512 Logitech, Inc.

Does cleaning /var/cache/apt/archives by apt-get clean affect installed applications?\nIs it that the .deb packages there are needed for applications to run properly?\n\nA: Not at all.\nWhen you install an application, apt downloads needed .deb file, and then extracts its data into your file system. The .deb file is, however, kept - so that, for example, in case you want to reinstall that application, the .deb file will have been already downloaded. That means you can safely clean that cache with apt-get clean and it will not do any harm to your system and neither for applications.\nThis way you can free some disk space.\n\nA: No, apt-get clean will not harm your system. The .deb packages in /var/cache/apt/archives are used by the system to install software. But once the software is installed, these .deb packages are no longer needed. You will need these .deb files only while re-installing the software. In case you do not need to re-install, remove these .deb files using apt-get clean.\n\nA: From the manpage of apt-get.\n\nclean clears out the local repository of retrieved package files.\n  It removes everything but the lock file from\n  /var/cache/apt/archives/ and /var/cache/apt/archives/partial/. When\n  APT is used as a dselect(1) method, clean is run automatically.\n  Those who do not use dselect will likely want to run apt-get clean\n  from time to time to free up disk space.\n\nNote the emphasized line. You should run apt-get clean from time to time.\nThe answer is no, it does no harm, not at all.\n", "Q: how to avoid manually updating grub I have dual boot system with Ubuntu 11.10 (installed first) and Fedora 16.

They will never be in sync.\nIf you want your dual boot to be more manageable, I would recommend re-installing\ngrub on Fedora to install to a \"partition\" (e.g. separate /boot partitions) and not the MBR, then from Ubuntu who is the primary bootloader (in MBR) will \"just boot Fedora\" and it's kernel config/grub will take care of itself.\nIf you're trying to use a Fedora kernel on Ubuntu, which is\nno different than installing a custom kernel from scratch, is highly discouraged.\nNow I haven't done this in a while so you might have some tinkering to do.\nTo accomplish grub move, from Fedora you have to run 'grub-install /dev/sdX' where X is the partition that contains /boot for the Fedora kernel. If this is co-resident with the Ubuntu /boot then you'll have to move it and create a new one.\nThen from Ubuntu, edit /etc/grub.d/40_custom and add something like this.\n# Boot Fedora's grub from partition\ntitle Fedora OS\nroot (hd0,2)\nkernel /boot/grub/core.img\n\nThat (hd0,2) assumes your Fedora /boot is on sda2, adjust that according to your installation.\nRun update-grub and it should \"just work\". Now that Ubuntu's grub simply has a pointer to Fedora's grub, whenever Fedora upgrades the kernel, it can do so without being thwarted by the Ubuntu, which maintains the grub menu list. Each OS will maintain it's own grub and they'll live happily ever after. You should never have to run update-grub again from Ubuntu to reflect kernel updates in Fedora.\n", "Q: Is Firefox 8 available for Ubuntu 11.10? \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhy isn't Firefox 8.0 available as an update in the Update Manager? \n\nIs Firefox 8 available for Ubuntu 11.10?\nDO I have to change the PPA or something to get Firefox 8 for Ubuntu 11.10?\nI still have Firefox 7 even though I updated (sudo aptitude update)\nThanks for answering my silly question.\n\nA: There is a custom repository for FF8, follow the instructions here for more info:\nhttp://www.ubuntugeek.com/how-to-install-firefox-8-on-ubuntu-using-ppa.html\n", "Q: Integrate program into clock panel it's been a while since I last used Ubuntu and it looks like that Ubuntu changed a lot.

I want to test wine with a current Ubuntu live image.\nI managed to install ubuntu-11.10-desktop-i386.iso on a USB stick. The resulting USB stick boots alright.\nUnfortunately, the live image does not include wine.\nI noticed that the root file system is an overlay one - the overlay is stored in RAM.\nThe problem is that the test system does not have that much RAM - i.e. modifying /etc/apt/sources.lst and apt-get install wine works on the live system - but a few packages eat all the available RAM and the system halts.\nPlus - I also need some space for installing the windows application (to test it).\nIs it possible to use a spare partition on the USB stick for the root-overlay?\nThen I would have enough space for the wine packages and the windows application - or am I missing something?\n\nA: You can use usb-creator-kde and a USB stick which is 2 GB or larger. The tool presents options to use some space for persistent storage on the USB stick.\nIn case the stick is smaller than 2 GB, the options are not available.\nThe persistent storage is configured as loopback-filesystem-file on the stick (4 GB max). This file is then use as overlay on the live system (instead of RAM).\nThis works quite well - apt-get install and wine work as expected and everything is written to the stick.\nOn my Ubuntu 11.04 system, the usb-creator was a bit picky. With a 16 GB stick it failed to write the boot sector. usb-creator-gtk did not report the problem - udb-creator-kde did report it. With another stick sudo usb-creator-kde started the GUI etc. - but the resulting stick did not boot. With usb-creator-kde inside a sudo su - the installation on the same stick worked and the live system booted.\nI looked into the initrd.lv of the resulting USB stick and noticed in scripts/casper that the live system checks if persistent is given as boot parameter and if it can find a ext2 filesystem labeled casper-rw - if so it uses that as overlay.\nThis mechanism is also documented at the Ubuntu-wiki. But I didn't manage to create a second partition on the stick that is recognized by the live system. I failed to create first the partition and instruct usb-creator to just use the first one. I also failed to let usb-creator create the live system and then use gparted to shrink it and create a second partition (as described at the Wiki) - the resulting stick would not boot anymore.\n", "Q: HTC Android device mounted as USB drive is read-only unless I'm root When I connect my HTC Incredible S to my Ubuntu 10.10 system as a USB drive, the device seems to mount OK, but is read-only unless I access it as root.

This is fine and I am already doing it, but in case my HDD fails, and I make a new Ubuntu install on a new disk, will Deja Dup be able to restore all my settings and stuff from the backed up files? If it can, then what other files/folders should I add in Deja Dup to back-up?  Currently I have set only the recommended /home folder. Is there a point in telling Deja Dup to back-up everything under \"/\" ?\n\n*Disk/partition cloning software. This would be something similar to Norton ghost. Is there software like this with a nice GUI that you could recommend for Ubuntu? And even better, it would be nice if Ubuntu's liveCD could recognize such a clone at install step.\nI am using 11.10.\n\nA: I have just restored a system, myself. I am a newbie to Ubuntu, but I have learned a lot and I am a fan of multi-partitions.\nBacking up /etc; well I don't know, but having a record of 'fstab' is essential and during the re-installation, remembering to only format the / partition is also important. As a result of having a mount point at /home/my-namefor my data partition, the most important thing that I discovered as a direct result of the re-install, was the need to immediately revert fstab. This required a reboot following the system installation, (just like \"Windows\"),as I was unable to invoke gedit from the command line straight away.\nThe benefit is avoiding the need to restore to /home/my-name. It is enough of a chore having to re-install all the previously installed programs.\nTo be doubly safe a monthly clone of the entire hard drive is good. 'dd' leaves you hanging in space without a clue as to what is going on. 'DDRESCUE' keeps you informed. I shall take a look at 'Clonezilla'. Backups with deja dup however, seem to restore data just fine.\n\nA: Professionally, we use Clonezilla to do full disk and partition clones. It can image the disk to an external USB, SFTP, or NFS shares. It compresses the image and in some cases is able to do partition resizing based upon disk size.\nhttp://clonezilla.org/\n\nA: I hope you have lots of free space, and that free space is\nhighly available. In a Debian system, you really only need to\nback up what's in /home and perhaps /etc. Then you can get\na list of all packages installed like so:\ndpkg --get-selections > installed-software\n\nand to restore:\ndpkg --set-selections < installed-software && dselect\n\nDeja-dup, or just using duplicity directly should suit\nyour needs and save you a ton of space compared to\nsaving binary copies of your HD.

Always.\nHowever on desktop machines, it is common to circumvent this. Ubuntu Desktop (with Gnome GUI) allows local users to mount smbfs/cifs network shares via Places -> Connect to Server -> Windows shares.\nThere are other options to allow user mounts.

I noticed that my file-exchange partition could not be mounted. Normally, during boot you can just skip the it then...\nHere however, this was not possible: The error was, that for some reason the name of the file exchange partition was the same as the /home partition (/dev/sda5).\nTherefore, I went into the fstab file and removed the entry for the file-exchange partition (which I did not edit manually, but with the program 'Storage Device Manager').\nNow, everything works fine.\n", "Q: How to run any program but prevent it from accessing the Internet I see a nice tutorial on the subject from 2009:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1188099\nBut wanted something that will (more likely) work on Ubuntu 11.10.\nThis is a flavor of an \"application firewall\" for allowing me to use Windows software in wine, while keeping them at bay from \"calling base\" for collecting the user's data (me).\n\nA: There is no reason to think that the method described in that thread will not work on the latest versions of Ubuntu. When some users had experienced problems, they were asked what version they were running in case there was a problem with newer versions, but no such problem was shown to be occurring.\nI recommend that you read the entire forum thread (it's five pages, which is longer than some threads but shorter than many) and try the technique as described. It should work. Before using it \"in production,\" you should of course test it with a program where there are no negative consequences associated with it accessing the Internet, in case either the method doesn't work or you have made a mistake.\nAs an alternative technique, you can create a virtual machine (for example, with VirtualBox) without Internet access (you could even make it have zero virtual network adapters) and run the program on that virtual machine. This may be preferable for programs whose behavior you don't fully trust, because then you have a greater degree of isolation between the program and your (host) Ubuntu system, and also because you can create a snapshot before running the program and revert the VM to that snapshot afterwards.\nOf course, if you don't trust a program to behave properly, you should strongly consider not running it at all. When a developer creates a program that disrespects its users' privacy, no matter what the reason is in the mind of the developer, this is an indication that the developer does not respect your privacy and any program the developer has authored (including that one) may disrespect your privacy in other ways. With free open source software, it is possible to vet the code to determine if this is the case (though practically speaking, it may be nontrivial to do so). But for proprietary software, this is not generally an option.\n", "Q: UbuntuOne doesn't sync on my computer File sync has stopped working on my computer.

But when I try to launch it from the LXDE menu, it will not start.\nContents of /usr/share/applications/gish.desktop:\n[Desktop Entry]\nCategories=Game;ActionGame;AdventureGame;ArcadeGame;\nExec=/opt/gish/gi.sh\nPath=/opt/gish\nIcon=x-gish\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nName=Gish\n\nI tried changing Terminal=false to Terminal=true to debug it, but then I just got a blank terminal, and the game didn't start.\nEdit:\nHere is some additional information, as requested by Eliah Kagan below:\n\n\n*\n\n*I tried editing /usr/share/applications/gish.desktop, as recommended, but it had no effect\n\n*However, ~/.xsession-errors contained the following error:\n[: 8: x86_64: unexpected operator\n./gish_32: error while loading shared libraries: libGL.so.1: wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS64\n\nI think there's a problem with the /opt/gish/gi.sh shell script. This is its contents:\ncd /opt/gish/\n\nMACHINE_TYPE=`uname -m`\nif [ ${MACHINE_TYPE} == 'x86_64' ]; then\n  ./gish_64\nelse\n  ./gish_32\nfi\n\nI'm not too familiar with Bash, so hopefully someone else can point out the error.\nI have a 64-bit machine. I think that when the script is run from the command line, it's properly launching the 64-bit version (/opt/gish/gish_64), but when it's run from the LXDE menu, it's launching the 32-bit version (/opt/gish/gish_32), which is causing the libGL.so.1 error. However, this may be related to my libGL.so.1 problems with 2 other games.\n\nA: General advice for this sort of problem\nTry changing Exec=/opt/gish/gi.sh to Exec=sh /opt/gish/gi.sh.\nIf that doesn't work, try changing the Path line so it specifies whatever directory you're in when you run the program in the Terminal. Assuming you're in your home directory, the line would become Path=/home/aberration where aberration is replaced by your username on your Ubuntu system (if different).\nIf that doesn't work either, then please open the file called .xsession-errors located in your home directory (in PCManFM you'll have to press Ctrl+H or click View > Show Hidden to make this and other files that start with . appear), select its entire contents, copy it to the clipboard, paste it at the Ubuntu Pastebin, and edit your question to include the URL for it. Make sure that you have attempted to run the game from the LXDE menus very shortly before opening .xsession-errors so that messages pertaining to the failure are likely to appear near the end of the file.\nAdvice specific to the error in .xsession_errors and the script's specific contents\nIt seems likely that your suspicion is correct; that is, that when the script is run from LXPanel, the test for whether or not your architecture is 64-bit is not working properly. I am not sure exactly what is going wrong. But since the script does not have a leading hashbang line (i.e., a line starting with #! followed immediately by the full path to the program that is to act as the script's interpreter), it is probably being run by a different shell when you run it from LXPanel than when you run it from bash in LXTerminal. When you run it from LXPanel, it is probably being run by the default shell (/bin/sh, which is a symbolic link to the dash shell), whereas when you run it from within bash in LXTerminal, it is being run by bash. The script uses some unusual syntax that I am not familiar with, which might reflect that my scripting knowledge is a bit rusty, but might be because I write scripts for sh/dash rather than bash.\nI recommend that you back up the script (sudo cp /opt/gish/gi.sh /opt/gish/gi.sh.old) and then try editing it by adding the line #!/bin/bash to the very top, to make it run with bash. Then see if it runs properly.\nIf it does, then I recommend submitting a bug report to the creators of gi.sh. (I am guessing this is not an Ubuntu package, since it is installed in /opt, so you'll have to check if the project has its own bug reporting guidelines first.) While the fix detailed above is appropriate for Ubuntu, a fix likely to work properly on a wider variety of Unix-like systems (Linux-based and otherwise) would be to use #!/usr/bin/env bash rather than #!/bin/bash since env is in /usr/bin significantly more often than bash is in /bin. (The authors should also be aware that bash is not present on all Unix-like systems, so if Gish is intended to run on systems that are likely not to have bash and it doesn't otherwise require bash, they might want to edit the script.) And either way, a script that requires bash should not be suffixed .sh, but should instead be suffixed .bash (or not at all).\nIf that change does not make the script run properly, then it's still worth checking to see if the problem was that the 32-bit version of Gish was running instead of the 64-bit version. So you can make a new .desktop file with the contents:\n[Desktop Entry]\nCategories=Game;ActionGame;AdventureGame;ArcadeGame;\nExec=/opt/gish/gish_64\nPath=/opt/gish\nIcon=x-gish\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nName=Gish\n\nRunning from that .desktop file--assuming it works--should confirm that the problem is that the wrong executable is being run (and should also work around the problem for you, so you can run Gish from LXPanel).\n", "Q: How to make AMAROK \"see\" my ipod 6Gen classic?

Thought I'd update this question instead of delete so it helps anyone on an x64 Debian-based distro.\n", "Q: How to prevent a Gtk.SourceView from grabbing the URI of a file I'm making a text editor using GTK3 in Vala. I need to drag a file and, when I drop it into the application window, the application opens that file. I'm using a Gtk.Notebook that contains the Gtk.SourceView's. It works when I drop a file into an empty Gtk.Notebook, but when there is at least one Gtk.SourceView appended on it, the SourceView grabs the URI of the file, shows it and the window can't handle the opening of the file.\nIn this case, what can I do to prevent a Gtk.SourceView from grabbing the URI of a file when I drop a file into a Gtk.SourceView.\nPS: I tried to use the drag_dest_unset() inside the SourceView derived class. It worked, the SourceView didn't grab the URI and the window could open the file, but the application showed a message like this, in runtime:\nGtk-WARNING **: Can't set a target list on a widget until you've called gtk_drag_dest_set() to make the widget into a drag destination\n\n\nA: To make the Gtk.SourceView stop grabbing the uri, I used the following code snippet:\npublic class MySourceView: Gtk.SourceView {\n    public MySourceView() {\n        Gtk.TargetEntry[] targets;\n        targets = new Gtk.TargetEntry[1];\n        targets[0].target = \"text/uri-list\";\n        targets[0].flags = 0;\n        targets[0].info = 0;\n\n        Gtk.drag_dest_set(this, Gtk.DestDefaults.ALL, targets, Gdk.DragAction.COPY);\n        this.drag_data_received.connect(this.drag_data_received_cb);\n    }\n\n    private void drag_data_received_cb(Gtk.Widget sender,\n                    Gdk.DragContext drag_context,\n                    int x, int y,\n                    Gtk.SelectionData data,\n                    uint info, uint time) {\n        print(\"Drag data received!\\n\");\n        // Do something\n\n        Gtk.drag_finish (drag_context, true, false, time);\n    }\n}\n\nThis way, the uri of the file that I drop in the source view is not pasted in it and I can open the file in another tab.\n\nA: This sounds like you're trying to drag the file into the SourceView widget with the idea that it will open a new tab instead of opening that file in that source view widget.\nWhat you need to do is not disable the drag event, you need to redirect it. The event will come into the sourceview widget and then you connect to it and pass it to your code (in your window?) which deals with opening a new tab.\nDoes this make sense? do you need code samples?\n", "Q: Remove app shortcuts from Unity? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow can I remove un-installed Wine programs from the Unity dash menu? \n\nSorry if this has already been asked. I installed a couple of apps with Wine, which I un- and then re-installed, but they still appear in the Unity dash. How can I remove them?\n\nA: Use alacarte to edit the menus or delete the relevant .desktop files from ~/.local/share/applications.\n", "Q: Send raw data to USB parallel port after upgrading to 11.10 I have a laser cutter connected via a generic USB to parallel adapter.  The laser cutter speaks HPGL, as it happens, but since this is a laser cutter and not a plotter, I usually want to generate the HPGL myself, since I care about the ordering, speed, and direction of cuts and so on.\nIn previous versions of Ubuntu, I was able to print to the cutter by copying an HPGL file directly to the corresponding USB \"lp\" device.  For example:\ncp foo.plt /dev/usblp1\n\nWell, I just upgraded to Ubuntu 11.10 oneiric, and I can't find any \"lp\" devices in /dev anymore.  D'oh!\nWhat's the preferred way to send raw data to a parallel port in Ubuntu?  I've tried System Settings > Printing > + Add, hoping that I might be able to associate my device with some kind of \"raw printer\" driver and print to it with a command like\nlp -d LaserCutter foo.plt\n\nBut my USB to parallel adapter doesn't seem to show up in the list.  What I do see are my HP Color LaserJet, two USB-to-serial adapters, \"Enter URI\", and \"Network Printer\".\nMeanwhile, over in /dev, I do see /dev/ttyUSB0 and /dev/ttyUSB1 devices for the 2 USB-to-serial adapters.  I don't see anything obvious corresponding to the HP printer (which was /dev/usblp0 prior to the upgrade), except for generic USB stuff.  For example, sudo find /dev | grep lp produces no output.  I do seem to be able to print to the HP printer just fine, though.  The printer setup GUI gives it a device URI starting with \"hp:\" which isn't much help for the parallel adapter.\nThe CUPS administrator's guide makes it sound like I might need to feed it a device URI of the form parallel:/dev/SOMETHING, but of course if I had a /dev/SOMETHING I'd probably just go on writing to it directly.\nHere's what dmesg says after I disconnect and reconnect the device from the USB port:\n[  924.722906] usb 1-1.1.4: USB disconnect, device number 7\n[  959.993002] usb 1-1.1.4: new full speed USB device number 8 using ehci_hcd\n\nAnd here's how it shows up in lsusb -v:\nBus 001 Device 008: ID 1a86:7584 QinHeng Electronics CH340S\nDevice Descriptor:\n  bLength                18\n  bDescriptorType         1\n  bcdUSB               1.10\n  bDeviceClass            0 (Defined at Interface level)\n  bDeviceSubClass         0 \n  bDeviceProtocol         0 \n  bMaxPacketSize0         8\n  idVendor           0x1a86 QinHeng Electronics\n  idProduct          0x7584 CH340S\n  bcdDevice            2.52\n  iManufacturer           0 \n  iProduct                2 USB2.0-Print \n  iSerial                 0 \n  bNumConfigurations      1\n  Configuration Descriptor:\n    bLength                 9\n    bDescriptorType         2\n    wTotalLength           32\n    bNumInterfaces          1\n    bConfigurationValue     1\n    iConfiguration          0 \n    bmAttributes         0x80\n      (Bus Powered)\n    MaxPower               96mA\n    Interface Descriptor:\n      bLength                 9\n      bDescriptorType         4\n      bInterfaceNumber        0\n      bAlternateSetting       0\n      bNumEndpoints           2\n      bInterfaceClass         7 Printer\n      bInterfaceSubClass      1 Printer\n      bInterfaceProtocol      2 Bidirectional\n      iInterface              0 \n      Endpoint Descriptor:\n        bLength                 7\n        bDescriptorType         5\n        bEndpointAddress     0x82  EP 2 IN\n        bmAttributes            2\n          Transfer Type            Bulk\n          Synch Type               None\n          Usage Type               Data\n        wMaxPacketSize     0x0020  1x 32 bytes\n        bInterval               0\n      Endpoint Descriptor:\n        bLength                 7\n        bDescriptorType         5\n        bEndpointAddress     0x02  EP 2 OUT\n        bmAttributes            2\n          Transfer Type            Bulk\n          Synch Type               None\n          Usage Type               Data\n        wMaxPacketSize     0x0020  1x 32 bytes\n        bInterval               0\nDevice Status:     0x0000\n  (Bus Powered)\n\n\nA: The /dev/usb/lpX device files you are looking for are provided by the usblp driver.  It seems in Ubuntu 11.10 though, that this driver has been blacklisted.  See the /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-cups-usblp.conf file:\n# cups talks to the raw USB devices, so we need to blacklist usblp to avoid\n# grabbing them\nblacklist usblp\n\nIf you want to send data directly to the device still, you can temporarily load the driver with modprobe usblp (the blacklist only prevents the driver from being automatically loaded).  Once you are done, you can unload it with modprobe -r usblp.\n", "Q: How can I use my usb hdd as a live installer without formatting it all?

I have a lot of data in other partitions that I want to keep, so I cannot just plug in the usb creator because it seems to want to format the whole thing... \nWhat can I do?\n\nA: Try using the Disk Utility or GParted to format the unpartioned space then use unetbootin to install live ubuntu to that partition.  Make sure you select the right one!\n\nA: use Gparted or the integrated utility Palimpsest which comes with the latests versions of Ubuntu http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palimpsest_Disk_Utility\n", "Q: disable password prompt on user switch? I've got 11.10 on a desktop machine with two users. Both users have \"Password\" set to \"Not asked on login\" in Users Settings. At startup, either user can log in without a password.

That is ignored in the Gnome 3 / Unity era.\nDoes anyone know a way to disable the password prompt when switching between users in Oneiric?\n\nA: Only this worked out for me: \ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.lockdown disable-lock-screen 'true'\n\nThis disables screen lock on user switch and hibernation wakeup.\nPS: gsettings has to be configured for every user seperately.\n\nA: Run this command:\nsudo visudo\n\nThen, at the end add this line:\nuser   ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/su\n\nThis will disable the password check for the \"su\" command for the specified user.\ncheers\n", "Q: Problem connecting the second external monitor I had a similar problem while using Ubuntu 10.04.

I cannot mirror the screen as well as it is disabled.\nAny idea how to fix this problem ?

If I come back to the computer it will start playing again. \nI tried making the computer not lock in case that was the cause but it still stops playing when the screen saver comes on. \nBesides making the screen stay on is there another solution?\nThanks \n\nA: Are you on a laptop computer or on a desktop one? If you are using a desktop one, i remember having the same problem when i used the built-in speakers of my display... Every time the display would go on energy-saving mode (actually standby mode), the speakers would come off as well. As soon as I used separate speakers, the problem disappeared.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: I was having this same problem in Linux Mint Maya (based on Ubuntu 12.04): Banshee is playing, monitor powers off after some amount of idle time (though screen does not lock), Banshee finishes playing track and then stops. When I move the mouse and the monitor comes back on, Banshee starts up again.\nI wondered why Banshee was going to the end of the song and THEN stopping. So I figured maybe it had to do with new-track notifications. Sure enough, I disabled Banshee's \"Notification Area Icon\" extension (In Edit->Preferences->Extensions tab) and now Banshee keeps on playing just fine, new tracks and all, after the monitor goes off. I don't get pop-up notifications between songs anymore, but that's a small price to pay on my end.\nI'm going to go mention this in a related bug report; if it works for you, consider saying so there so that we might help the developers find the real source of this issue.\n\nA: I believe that this has something to do with your xscreensaver. I had the same problem and solved it by completely deactivating it (in xscreensaver-demo).\nYou can still let your screen get turned off after some time of inactivity by using gnome-screensaver and controlling it through the control panel afaik. Banshee isn't affected by this.\nEdit: it seems as if that wasn't fully it. I still seem to encounter this problem from time to time.\n", "Q: Partial upgrade error this is an issue I have googled a lot and I have tried a lot of fixes, but non of them really worked.\nAt some point (I can't remember when/how) my Update system sort of broke, and since then it is always complaining about \"Not all updates can be installed, run a Partial Upgrade\".\n\nIf I click on Partial Upgrade, I get the following result\n\nBut running apt-get install -f does not fix anything, and at the end I always get the following message\n\nFunny thing is that my apt-get system works perfect on Console.

I then learned that it has happening because I was syncing between windows and linux and the former has lower timestamp precision.\nI solved my problem adding the --modify-window=1 parameter to the rsync command which compares mod-times with reduced accuracy.\n", "Q: Can I have a list of opened windows instead expo effect?

The options available to Unity 2D are very basic - essentially just things like when the panel should hide, whether or not the super key works with it, and so on.

I used to use the two 24\" monitors in potrait mode (rotated)  with proprietary driver before. With the open source driver the rotation slows things even more. Is there any fix for it.  Are there any tweaks to make the open source driver work better with multiple monitors with some of them rotated.\n\nA: this is your main resource regarding the whole package of drivers that comes from AMD ATI http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Main_Page\nit's an \"unofficial\" resource but it's also linked in the official page of download where you get the proprietary driver, in the same page there are several others links that i suggest you to follow.\n", "Q: My Ubuntu 11.10 upgrade failed , And Ubuntu is not working now Please help me in recovering Ubuntu back.

On Knoppix-based distros, you get a nice Tux logo on the left of the screen during text boot. Is this possible to get on Ubuntu?\n\n\nA: This logo is a kernel compile option called \"CONFIG_LOGO\" - it is a boolean value - when it is set to true it displays the Logo on boot.\nThis logo appears through a framebuffer - that is how you get the graphical logo.\nThe Ubuntu kernels don't appear to use this compile option and hence it defaults to \"false\" which disables the logo.  The probable reason for this is that it would interfere with Plymouth - you'll need to compile your own kernel to do this...\nYou'll need to install a framebuffer package such as v86d and configure it correctly with your monitor resolution as per this ArchLinux wiki.\nYou'll also need to ensure when booting you do not use KMS - i.e. nomodeset or i915.modeset=0 type parameters.\n", "Q: How to re-enable function keys in byobu? I was using byobu on Ubuntu 11.10 Server and I needed to hit a function key in an app, so I hit F9 to bring up the config menu and switched the keybinding set from \"f-keys\" to \"screen-escape-keys\".  That worked, but now I can't re-enable all the f-keys.\nI found a program byobu-config that brings up the menu again, and I can switch back to screen keys from there.  This fixes things for new screen processes, but the effect on the current screen session is weird: it disables the Ctrl+a (screen) keys and restores F2-F8, but F9-F12 still don't do anything (they're just passed on to the foreground process).\nWhat's up with this?  Any ideas?  Thanks in advance.\n\nA: Note: This only works if you're using Byobu with tmux as the back-end. See other answers for Byobu with screen as the back-end.\n\nJust press Shift+F12 To toggle F-keys on and off.\nExample : Launch htop (within a Byobu pane of course) then enter Shift+F12, then if you press F3 you will search in htop processes, not switch to the left Byobu window/pane.\nRelated question with answer also for screen.\n\nA: We can attempt to debug your particular problem, however it would be much easier to just clean out your Byobu configuration and start clean:\nrm -rf ~/.byobu\n\nOn 11.04, you'll also need to remove the folder this symlink points to:\nrm -rf ~/.local/share/byobu\n\nAnd then start byobu.\n\nA: In case any of the key combinations from the other answers did not work, just try this equivalent command inside Byobu:\nbyobu-keybindings\n\n\nA: You can also toggle between the f-keys bindings and the screen-escape-keys bindings using:\nctrl-a-!\n\n\nA: Make your ~/.byobu/keybindings look like this:\n# source $BYOBU_PREFIX/share/byobu/keybindings/common\n. /usr/share/byobu/keybindings/f-keys.screen.disable\n\nand select screen as byobu's back-end via byobu-select-backend.

Is there an application that allows me to extract the audio from a MP4 or FLV video file and store it as an MP3 file for use in a portable media player?\n\nA: It is very easy to do with WinFF (install it), which is a GUI for ffmpeg. \n\n\n*\n\n*Click add. \n\n*Select a video file\n\n*In Convert to, select Audio\n\n*Select an audio codec\n\n*Click Convert. (Notice that the Convert button might sometimes disappear if the window is too small. Make the window larger if you don't see it)\n\n\nDone. Screenshot: \n\n\nA: you can do it using ffmpeg. Install ffmpeg using following command:\nsudo apt-get install ffmpeg libavcodec-unstripped-52\n\nThe package libavcodec-unstripped-52 is available in Multiverse repo, so you will need to enable it.\nAfter installing these packages, you can use a command like the one below to extract the audio as mp3:\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -f mp3 -ab 192000 -vn music.mp3\n\nThe -i option in the above command is simple: it is the path to the input file. The second option -f mp3 tells ffmpeg that the ouput is in mp3 format. The third option i.e -ab 192000 tells ffmpeg that we want the output to be encoded at 192Kbps and -vn tells ffmpeg that we dont want video. The last param is the name of the output file.\n\nA: Audacity can also open a flv file and export it as mp3, flac and other formats\n\n\n\nMy favorite way is to use gnome-terminal -e \"avconv -i %f %f.mp3\" in Thunar custom actions. Even better, to get a constant bitrate of 192 kbps:\navconv -i %f -c:a libmp3lame -ac 2 -b:a 190k %f.mp3\nIn fact the audio in a flv (and mp4) file is in aac format. To stay as close as possible to the quality of the original sound, consider using the aac in an m4a container. If the mp3 format is a must, consider the initial bitrate of the aac file when converting to mp3.

I have Opera set as my default browser but it is the same for Firefox. When opening a link in Liferea, the link opens in an external browser and the browser gets focus. I would like to open the links in background (so that the browser does not get focus).\nThe only solution is to set Focus prevention level to Normal in the Focus & Raise Behaviour tab of  General options in CCSM. But this messes things for other things. DO you have any other idea how to prevent new windows to have focus? \nI am using Unity on 11.10.\n\nA: I think this is a bug, so I reported it. This used to work with Gnome 2, it works with Gnome Shell and Gnome 3 fallback. I suspect compiz, but what do I know.\n\nA: Right-click on the window title bar of Liferea and choose \"Always on Top\".\nNow all your links will open in the background.\n\nA: Open CompizConfig  Settings manager(CCSM) from dash\nUnder General Options,\nset Auto-raise=Very high\nand Delay=500.\nAll new windows will open in the background!\n\nA: Alone the CCSM auto-raise wont work here in ubuntu 10.04 or 12.04.. so I had to create this script:\n#!/bin/bash\ndelay=0.5\nwhile true; do \n        windowId=`xdotool getwindowfocus`\n        xdotool getwindowname $windowId\n        xdotool windowactivate $windowId; \n        sleep $delay; \ndone\n\nBe advised that this simple script will work for all windows, not only your browsers. But it is overall good in a sense that you wont for ex. miss click on new opened windows...\nThis script depends on you setting the \"Focus prevention level\" high enough so that new opened windows wont get the focus. It works on Ubuntu 10.04 and 12.04 at least, but should work anywhere... if it fails for you, say so and we can think together!\nThis is an endless loop (break it with ctrl+c) that will \"activate\" the window that has focus (focus for keyboard input). So it will make the focused window \"jump\" to foreground each 0.5 seconds (you can lower or up the delay value to your needs/taste).\nSo all new opened applications and windows will still open in the foreground but will be promptly hidden by the window that has focus!\nJust to make it clear, they will not open in the background but this script will provide almost the same effect. \"Almost\" because if you are very unlucky you can still click on the new opened window before the focused one be put to foreground, what will make the new window be the focused one... Lowering the delay will help prevent that but consume more cpu, I think less than 0.1 is not good, but you must test to see what works better for you...\nPS.: your xdotool version must support these commands: getwindowfocus, getwindowname, windowactivate\n", "Q: Gnome Shell: Move windows to front on launch (No more \"... is ready to use\" notifications) I've been using Gnome Shell with Ubuntu for few days now and have experienced really annoying behaviour with new windows.\nSometimes when I use another window and press e.g. Alt+Ctrl +T to open new terminal window, the new window is not brought to the front.

I need to either Alt+Tab it or click the notification to see the new message.\nIs there any way to have new windows being always brought to front, and remove those annoying \"Window is ready\" notifications?\nEDIT: gconftool-2 --search-key focus_new_windows (as requested by severin):\n /schemas/apps/metacity/general/focus_new_windows = Schema (type: `string' list_type: '*invalid*' car_type: '*invalid*' cdr_type: '*invalid*' locale: `C')\n /apps/metacity/general/focus_new_windows = smart\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Go to System > Preferences > CompizConfig Settings Manager > General Options (under General) > Focus & Raise Behaviour,\n\n*Clear Focus Prevention Windows field.\n\n\nReferences: Compiz General Options, Compiz Window Matching.\n\nA: I dont think there is a setting to do this. I have been using gnome shell for a while now. You can install the \"advanced settings extension\" for gnome 3 which provides you with a few more settings. However, you cannot get the function you are looking for. I will search the net and come back to you.\n\nA: The long term solution is for this bug to be fixed by the developers.\nHere is a bug report that seems to be related:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-shell/+bug/1825710\nMaybe casting more votes will eventually help the solution..\n\nA: GNOME extension: \"Steal My Focus\"\nThere is an extension for Gnome 3 called \"steal my focus\" by  sstent.\nhttps://extensions.gnome.org/extension/234/steal-my-focus/\nIt solves the exact problem you're having.\n\nA: You can try setting focus_new_windows from smart to strict.\nYou can either use gconf-editor and go to /apps/metacity/general and change the value of focus_new_windows from smart to strict, like here:\nOr you can use the command line:\ngconftool-2 --set /apps/metacity/general/focus_new_windows --type string strict\n\nIf that still doesn't help, you can also change auto_raise_delay from 1000 to 0 in aforementioned gconf-editor (see screenshot).\nSee also here.\n\nA: On Ubuntu 20.04 without installing anything you can use these 2 commands in a Terminal as a workaround:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences auto-raise 'true'\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences focus-new-windows 'strict'\nNo need of extensions or additional Applications.\n\nA: This can now be done within Tweak Tool which is included with Gnome Shell.  You no longer need to use extensions or dconf-editor.\nUnder the \"Windows\" section, slide the switch over for \"Automatically Raise Windows\".\nThis setting will make windows popup in focus, and will also get rid of the \"application is ready\" notification.\n\nEDIT: This option is missing in Ubuntu 17.10 and will hopefully be back in 18.04.  As a temporary fix, you can try installing the following gnome extensions;\n\n\n*\n\n*Noannoyance\n\n*Focus my window\n\n*Steal my focus\n\n\nThe above extension are available here : https://extensions.gnome.org/\n\nA: *\n\n*use gconf-editor\n\n*go to /org/gnome/desktop/wm/preferences/focus-new-windows\n\n*set property: \"strict\"\n\n*apply changes\n\n\n\n\nA: GNOME extension: \"NoAnnoyance\"\nTry installing and activating this GNOME extension called NoAnnoyance by sindex:\n\n*\n\n*https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1236/noannoyance/\nThe GitHub repo seems more up-to-date than some of the answers listed here.\n\nA: You can modify this type of stuff with devilspie, which has a nice GUI frontend gdevilspie, which is in the repos.\n\nA: Create a custom shortcut under your keyboard settings\nand use command:\nxterm -e < terminalname >\nor:\nuxterm -e < terminalname >\n\nAlso if you get problems with \"failed to execute session\" you can always go a step further.\n\n\n< terminalname > -e xterm -e < terminalname >\n\nIn my case: \nxfce4-terminal -e xterm -e xfce4-terminal\n\nThis i kinda funny because in this way you use a native terminal to start the newer one.\nAnd since the older don't have the preference to start in background\nit will start the newer on top.\n\nClean and no need to install extensions.\n\nA: OK, I've had this issue for many months. After going through all answers, I found nothing satisfactory, but some good pointers. And here's the full answer that solved my problem for Ubuntu 18.04: https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-install-gnome-shell-extensions-on-ubuntu-18-04-bionic-beaver-linux.\nStep 1\nInstall Firefox Addon that makes it easy to install GNOME Shell extensions: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/gnome-shell-integration/.\nStep 2\nInstall the host connector that supports the addon:\nsudo apt install chrome-gnome-shell\n\nStep 3\nInstall this GNOME Shell extension: https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1236/noannoyance/. You can install it from the web page, thanks to the Firefox extension.\n\nA: For Ubuntu 20.04, the following has worked for me.\n\n*\n\n*Install the NoAnnoyance GNOME Shell Extension by entering in a terminal window\nsudo apt install gnome-shell-extension-no-annoyance\n\n\n*Then launch GNOME Tweaks by entering in the terminal\ngnome-tweaks\n\n\n*In Tweaks, make sure to enable Noannoyance under Extensions\n", "Q: How does one find out the command line corresponding to GUI app (eg, LibreOffice Writer)? How can I run LibreOffice Writer from the command line? Basically, what is its command and how do I get to know what's the command to run a particular application in general?\n\nA: Run libreoffice --writer to start LibreOffice Writer.\nIn this case, I guessed that it might be libreoffice or similar, so I entered libre in a terminal and pressed tab twice. libreoffice was one of the options, so I ran that. It started something from which one could choose to go to Writer, Calc, Impress, etc. Since you asked specifically about Writer, I looked at man libreoffice, which mentions -writer as one of the command line options. Running libreoffice -writer worked but resulted in\n$ libreoffice -writer\nWarning: -writer is deprecated.  Use --writer instead.\n\nAnd so I got to libreoffice --writer.\nIn general, one could try things like the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Guess and try names, based on the name of the application. Use Tab-completion for help. Read man pages for options.\n\n*Run the program (using a GUI menu or however else you run it), guess the process name, and check using ps aux | grep guessed_name.\n\n*If you know that the program belongs to installed package X, run dpkg -L X. It will list installed files from package X, look for /usr/bin, /bin, /sbin, etc in the output.\n\n*One can find out the process corresponding to a window as follows :\nRun xprop _NET_WM_PID, navigate to the target window (without clicking!), and click on it. This will print the PID corresponding to the window, for example\n_NET_WM_PID(CARDINAL) = 7394\n\nNow run ps -p 7394 (with 7394 replaced by the PID you got) to find out the process name for the given PID.\n\nA: To find a command, try using command auto-complete:\ntype 'libre', then press ['Tab'], giving you:\nlibreoffice\n\nthen add ' --help', finally giving you:\nlibreoffice --help\n\nThis will give you ALL the possible options you might need ..\n(snip)\nLibreOffice 3.4  340m1(Build:402)\n\nUsage: soffice [options] [documents...]\n\nOptions:\n--minimized    keep startup bitmap minimized.\n--invisible    no startup screen, no default document and no UI.\n--norestore    suppress restart/restore after fatal errors.\n--quickstart   starts the quickstart service\n--nologo       don't show startup screen.\n :\n--writer       create new text document.\n--calc         create new spreadsheet document.\n--draw         create new drawing.\n--impress      create new presentation.\n--base         create new database.\n:\n\n\nA: One very easy way which does not involve any guessing at all:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run alacarte (that's 'Main Menu' in the Gnome menu).\n\n*Follow these steps to find out an application's command name:\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the application.\n\n*Click Properties.\n\n*Find the command name for the application in the field Command, in this example it is file-roller.\n\n\nA: Usually all GUI applications have a launcher icon. Most of them are stored in /usr/share/applications. These .desktop files contain information about application name and their corresponding commands. \nA quick hacky way to list all applications and commands is to use awk command:\nawk '{FS = \"=\";if ($1==\"Name\") printf(\"%s => \",$2); if($1==\"Exec\") {printf(\"%s\\n\",$2);nextfile;}}' /usr/share/applications/*.desktop\n\n\nA: When I access Writer I go into my terminal and type:\n\nlowriter\n\nThis seems to work perfectly and can be repeated for Calc (localc); Draw (lodraw); Base (lobase); Impress (loimpress).  You get the point.  \nThe other wonderful terminal command I learned tonight is this:\n\nfirefox google.com\n\nthis will call up Firefox while taking you to the website of your choice or in this case Google.  The more that I play around with the Command Line Interface (CLI) the more that I fall in love with all of the capabilities.\n\nA: Honestly, this can easily be google'ed :p\nlibreoffice --writer\n\n\nA: On Ubuntu 12.10 and the new libreoffice 4.0, after manual installation, the command is:\nlibreoffice4.0 --writer\nall other commands, like previous answer, are given with the inclusion of 4.0 after libreoffice.\n\nA: If I have no idea where a program is, or what it is called, and only have the link from the \"start menu\", I will create a desktop shortcut with right click -> add to desktop. Then I will open the shortcut in a text editor and look for the line starting with \"Exec\". So, for LibreOffice Calc, I see:\nExec=libreoffice --calc %U\nThis corresponds to the bash command \"libreoffice --calc\". The percent-sign has to do with an extended implicit (?) option for exec, which I don't understand but which can be ignored since you're not using Exec.\n\nA: To start LibreOffice on an existing document, use xdg-open.  This not only works for LibreOffice documents but for any file or URL.  xdg-open will open the file using your preferred application.\nxdg-open file-or-url\n\nAs I usually work from the terminal, my ~/.bash_aliases has an alias o=xdg-open, so it reduces to this:\no aDocument.odt\no https://askubuntu.com\n\n", "Q: \"'/usr/share/app-install/desktop/software-center.menu': Not a directory\" error when trying to reinstall the software center I was having some problem with Software center.

I get an error where the monitor message says \"Out of Range\" (for installed Ubuntus while LIVE DVD =o.k.) and error \"battery state\"\nIn addition and probably related to this: the error message \"battery state\". \nThere are several threads on this site, related to this problem type. So far I did not find a really case-fitting solution and with an instruction easily to reproduce.\n\nA: I settled my problems with the long long procedure like listed here below. Hopeful that first time Linux users will appreciate to follow this excursion into the most powerful piece of an OS, the terminal window - instead of discarding LINUX forever after a first deception of this kind: \"out of range\". \nSee the same TRUE computing for all MS-Windows versions here: \nhttp://aha7.com/ppp-en/cbwd-dos4win-en.htm \n(Hence your instant re-activation of the now hidden and disguised \"terminal window\" inside all versions of MS-Window since 15 years.)\n(Text modified 1 day later by the original author, only layout etc., to make it easier to reproduce the command line examples)\nThe main remaining question after the procedure (described here below) is:\nI am a 10++ years LINUX user but not an expert. (Mainly Red Hat / Fedora.) \nIf the experts among the users of this site can add some additional information, this would be fine. \nIt would be of interest what really has happened. Possibly, the NVIDIA drivers just were not yet aware of a new hardware... \nPerhaps, in such cases, now a driver package should be installed or updated? \nI finally had to disable the most efficient of the NVIDIA drivers, perhaps due to their temporary problems. Will the existing new updated NVIDIA drivers now work properly? Atr perhaps installing them: Would I have to remove them instantly by the same procedure like - among othrs - described here below? \nNow to the facts: \nVERSION:\nUbuntu 11.10 - supplied with the periodical ct_Linux (Germany). \nHardware:\nThe problem apparently occurs for various hardware types. This specification of my hardware is only in order to have a sample case.\nNew, just bought, and so far no reason to suppose any hardware fault: \nMAINBOARD:     Gigybyte M68MZ-D3P\nCPU:     AMD Athlon II X2 250 3GHz  (take-over from reseller specification)\nCHIPSET: NVIDIA GeForce 7025nForce 620a \nGRAPHICS:  Onboard - 1x D-Sub port   (Connector: only VGA) \nRAM:   2x   2 GB \nHARD DISK: 750 GB, 13 partitions. \n- /dev/sda1 =51 GB - exr4 - UBUNTU 11.10 installed \n- /dev/sda2 =51 GB - ext4 - planned for Linux Fedora 16 (=Red Hat) \n- /dev/sda3 =101 GB - FAT32 - reserve - for MS-Win\n- the following ones for data, average size 50 GB - \nMONITOR 1:   new 24'' :  ASUS VH 242H -- data taken from reseller specification: \nLCD .- 23.6\" - 1920x1080 - 300cd - 5ms - 20000:1 - HDMI - DVI-D - VGA - HDCP \nMONITOR 2: (exactly the same boot problem...)\nold - 17\" - standard LCD - Manufacturer or product name: \"e-yama\" - \n(1) First: Test done with the LIVE version of UBUNTU 11.10: - 64b version -\nNo problem.

I am using the PC only as am OS + Tool provider; my software creates a layer for computing on exteral devices with generalized OS portability.)\n(3) Test of the installed version: \"out of range\"\nAfter installation, then during the first boot:\nThe integrated monitor software displays: \"out of range - Samsung\". \nThis is INSTANTLY after the BIOS message like \"starting OS\" or so. \nThere is no way to intervene, even not seconds, to interrupt for instructions or so. \nWaiting several minutes during the ongoing boot procedure : This does not result in any change - nothing happens.\n(4) Test of the installed version: With key \"Enter\"\nWhen switching the monitor OFF, \nthe key Enter results in some hard disk accesses. - Then switching the monitor to ON again: No effect - continuing monitor error messages.\nOne single time, for this kind of booting, I received instantly the message list in something like resolution 800/600 or lower, withPC halting after these 3 messages:  \n\"Starting bluetooth\"\n\"Pulsaudio... \"  \n\"checking battery state\" \n(5) Test on 17\" monitor \"e-yama\" of the installed version: \"out of range\"\nThe boot procedure also did not succeed.

Once, things seemed to go corrupt for no reason at all.  I fixed it the same way in all cases: Deleting the configuration and re-adding my accounts.\nFor Empathy on Oneiric, the files are in the following locations:\n\n\n*\n\n*~/.mission-control/ directory (accounts configuration is stored here)\n\n*~/.gconf/apps/empathy/ directory (this is where gconf-editor stores the empathy config)\n\n*~/.config/Empathy/ directory (contact groups are stored here)\n\n*/org/gnome/empathy/ dconf tree (app preferences are stored here)\n\n\nYou can reset the dconf tree to system defaults with the following command:\ndconf reset -f /org/gnome/empathy/\n\nResetting the dconf tree and deleting (or renaming) those directories will almost certainly allow Empathy to work correctly once again.  Once you have a functional app, you can add accounts one at a time, and see where the trouble lies.\n", "Q: Samsung ml1250 stopped working Printer stopped working (Samsung ml1250)!

Was hoping to solve this problem as it worries me that this continues to happen. \nif anyone can help me, or i need to provide more information on my system please provide step by step instructions on how to do this as I am still a beginner to the linux platform.\n\nA: This sounds like it might be a manifestation of the high power usage bug in the latest kernels.\nThere's a wiki page on it here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/PowerManagement\nYou might try installing and booting off the test kernels linked there to see if it fixes the issue. Ensure you get the correct ones for your Ubuntu version and architecture.\n\nA: It seems you have the power regression/overheating bug with the Linux Kernel \nthis bug's fix is in one of the comments in this link.\nHow to downgrade Kernel\n\nA: Go to the manufacturer of your computer/laptop model, check to see if there are updates for the BIOS for your model. (if you built it yourself you may need to go the motherboard's manufacturer site and check for BIOS updates. \nGet the latest update if it is available. More often than not, there will be an .exe file you can use that will flash/update your BIOS for you. They may have one that will do it from DOS and one that will do it from Windows. I used the one for Windows. Follow the instructions. If your computer does not restart for you after BIOS update, restart your computer. Check your BIOS to see if you now have the latest BIOS update for your computer.\nWhen I did this my computer had a senior moment at first. While using an alternative OS the fan would start then stop, start then stop, start then stop, then it worked normally even though I used Slax, Ubuntu (all version) and Slacko. Now I can use any OS I want to as long as I have the proper system requirements. No more overheating problems.\nWarning: Be careful. Do not flash the wrong BIOS update for you computer/motherboard or your computer will be rendered useless.\n", "Q: computer won't shutdown because of power management I am using Ubuntu 11.10 and when I run \"sudo shutdown 0\", the computer doesn't  shutdown. It gets stuck on \"Disabling Power Management\".\nAny idea of what's happening?\nThanks in advance.\nAlso, this seems to happen more when using battery instead of AC.\n\nA: man shutdown:\n   -P     Requests that the system  be  powered  off  after  it  has  been\n          brought down.\n    ...\n\n   -h     Requests  that  the system be either halted or powered off after\n          it has been brought down, with the choice as to which left up to\n          the system.\n\nSeeing that -P works for you. Now it's a question of why not? The usual cmd to shutdown is shutdown -h now. In old school init based systems there was a config file that tweaks shutdown when entered from this point. From my initial investigation it turns out upstart falls back to init.d scripts to handle this. With global configuration living in /etc/default/halt and the actual script is /etc/init.d/halt.\nIt looks like \"POWEROFF\" is the default action, so  if you just did halt or shutdown -h or telinit 0, it should also power off.\n[/etc/init.d/halt]\n    # If INIT_HALT=HALT don't poweroff.\n    poweroff=\"-p\"\n    if [ \"$INIT_HALT\" = \"HALT\" ]\n    then\n            poweroff=\"\"\n    fi\n\nSince INIT_HALT=POWEROFF (defined in /etc/default/halt), that poweroff='-p' stays set. To debug this it should be as simple as adding the vars populated at the end of the script like so.\n log_action_msg \"Will now halt:  $netdown $poweroff $hddown\"\n\nI wonder if your shutdown cmds are simply overriding the init configuration? In which case telinit 0should also shutdown the server and should become the first choice in performing this action.\n", "Q: How do I install osCommerce? Recently I've come across the osCommerce, an open-source e-commerce project, and I'd like to try it. Is it packaged in the repository (like Wordpress)? If not, how do I manually install and use it?\n\nA: you need a LAMP solution, so you have to install Apache, MySQL (server version) and the required PHP version and it's modules for your software.\nThe path where you have to \"install\" your files is called \"document root\" and is defined in the Apache configuration file, which is usually /var/www/. You can open the file /etc/apache2/apache2.conf and simply read (and change) the location of the DR.\nYou can basically consider the PHP as a big plugin for Apache, so probably for all the settings regarding the organization of the files on the disk and the general setup you have to refer to apache2.conf file. But to manage the PHP functionality you can modify the file php.ini that is usually located under the /etc/php tree but it can easily be moved elsewere according to your version of Ubuntu, but in general you can find a php.ini under /etc/.\nAlways make a backup of these files if you are not sure about what you are really doing.\nBy default the address of your local webserver is localhost or 127.0.0.1 if you want to use an IP, you can type it as the address and reach your document root. If you have created a dir under the DR called test (as in /var/www/test/), navigate to the content of this folder simply by going to http://localhost/test/ or http://127.0.0.1/test/ in your web browser. In a nutshell every web address is relative to the DR.\n\nA: osCommerce requires PHP and MySQL, in other words, a LAMP stack (Linux (operating system), Apache HTTP Server, MySQL (database software) and PHP). osCommerce need only to be copied to the document root, /var/www/.\nFurther, we need to create a database and user in MySQL for osCommerce to use.\nInstall LAMP and osCommerce\nsudo tasksel install lamp-server\n\nNow you need to download and \"install\" osCommerce (get the latest download URL @ osCommerce):\nwget http://www.oscommerce.com/get/8 #this is osCommerce 3.0.2 download as of 21/11/2011\nunzip oscommerce-3.0.2.zip\nsudo cp oscommerce-3.0.2/oscommerce/ /var/www/\n\nIn order to avoid permission issues, the above commands downloads to the current shell, unzips and copies osCommerce to /var/www/. Never unzip it directly or move the files to the document root if you don't know the necessary permissions required for a web application to function properly.\nosCommerce will now be accessible at http://ipaddress/osommerce/, where ipaddress is the IP address or the domain of your server. If you're installing osCommerce on the system you are currently on, you can replace ipaddress with localhost or 127.0.0.1.\nBrowsing to the osCommerce page will trigger the initial setup and ask for the details of MySQL database it will use and administrator user set up.\n\nCreate a MySQL database\nFirst, you should create a MySQL user for osCommerce to use. It's bad practise to use the root user/pass (setup during LAMP installation) for a web application.\nIn a shell on the machine with the MySQL on it, do:\nmysql -u root -p\n\nEnter the root password you previously specified. This gets you a prompt which has full access to your MySQL server.\nNow, pick a database name - it doesn't matter what it is really so long as it's unique on the MySQL server (to see existing ones, SHOW DATABASES;)\nCREATE DATABASE dbname;\n\nFor example, replacing dbname can be replaced with with oscommerce.\nNow you have to give a new user access to that database. Pick a username and password (the username can be oscommerce again, but make a secure password) - replace dbname with the database name (in this example, oscommerce):\nGRANT ALL ON dbname.* TO username IDENTIFIED BY 'password';\n\nDone. Now you have the details to put into your webform; the Database Server is just localhost or 127.0.0.1, assuming the webserver is the same machine as the MySQL server, the Username and Password are the ones just created, and the Database Name is whatever you replaced dbname with. Port can be left empty.\nReference\n\n\n*\n\n*MySQL database in tasksel LAMP stack for osCommerce\n", "Q: Konversations runs Akonadi migration on every startup Every time I start konversation, I get this screen:\n\nIt takes some 15 seconds â¦\nHow can I prevent it from coming up?

I have managed to get the printer working, but it doesn't recognise the scanner. \nI have installed the drivers from the Brother website, brscan2, etc., but it still doesn't work. How can I get the scanner working? \n\nA: According to Brother FAQ you may need to copy files from /usr/lib64/ to /usr/lib/.\n\nA: The first thing you need to do is to copy files from /usr/lib64/ to /usr/lib/. That's because you are using 64-bit system and the drivers are 32-bit (for exact instructions refer to the Brother FAQ). This step is just for the 64-bit Ubuntu.\nThen edit your /lib/udev/rules.d/50-udev-default.rules file. You need root access to do that:\nsudo gedit /lib/udev/rules.d/50-udev-default.rules\nSearch for # libusb device nodes section and add by the end of it this line:\nATTRS{idVendor}==\"04f9\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"01ce\", MODE=\"0666\", GROUP=\"scanner\", ENV{libsane_matched}=\"yes\"\nYou can find the idVendor and idProduct numbers by running lsusb command:\nBus 002 Device 004: ID 04f9:01ce Brother Industries, Ltd DCP-135C\nThere is also other way mentioned in the Brother FAQ it involves modification of other file /lib/udev/rules.d/40-libsane.rules and it's recommended for this versions of Ubuntu 9.10, 10.04, 10.10, 11.4, 11.10 (probably also 12.04). Both of these methods should work.\nYou should also add saned to the group which owns your scanner device:\nsudo adduser saned lp\n\nYour scanner is definitely in that group (I own one). If you wanted to use other scanner device then Ubuntu has documentation for it ScanningHowTo (look at Permission issues section).\nWhen you are done with all these steps you should restart the computer. The scanner should work in both Simple Scan and XSane programs.\n", "Q: Is it possible to do an apt-get installation and continue it later? Let's say I want to install something big... (kde for example) but I'm doing it in a place with a very poor internet conection, so I want to stop it, and doing it later. But I don't want to start all over again. Can it be done?\n\nA: Do apt-get install -d  STUFF which will download everything\nto the cache but won't act on it. \nLater when you have a better\nconnection you can just drop the -d and apt will download the\nrest if needed and begin installing from the cache: /var/cache/apt/archives/\n\nA: If you kill an apt-get while it's still in the stage of fetching packages then yes, it will resume fetching pretty much from where it left off - the archvies it has fetched so far will be kept in /var/cache/apt/archives.\nThis is the directory that gets cleaned up by apt-get clean, incidentally.\nIf you kill it after it's finished fetching and has started configuring/installing then you're in much deeper water and I wouldn't really want to try it ;)\n\nA: Or, start the installation with GNU Screen. Just run screen by itself, and it will open a new window with a shell inside it. If you run commands here, then press Ctrl-d (^d), the window will \"detach\" from your current terminal, but it will stay running in the background: run screen -x to get back to it.\nThis also works for long-running command such as apt-get install [all of KDE]: just start the apt-get install command inside a screen window and press ^d. Then later, simply re-attach using screen -x and see if it's done.\nScreen has much more options: ^a c will create new windows (use ^a 1 to go to the first one, ^a n to go to the one \"to the right\", etc). See http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/manual/ for the manual!\nEdit: Of course, the computer running screen windows cannot be restarted, or the windows will be lost.\n", "Q: Need help desperately to decrypt home folder Okay, long story:\nMy Windows crashed so I installed 11.10 on my HDD.

For example:\n\n\n*\n\n*Cleaning the logs\n\n*Temporary files\n\n*Package cache\n\n*Dependencies left over\n\n\nI am not referring to web browsers only.\nIn case I never do a cleanup, will I have a system like new without my hard drive being full of temporary files, packages, etc.?\nWill the performance degrade overtime if a cleanup is not done.\n\nA: Cleaning is not necessary, but for the meticulous among us it's highly recommended ;)\n\n\n*\n\n*apt cache can grow quite quickly, especially when a lot of new kernels are being installed\n\n*buggy applications can leave a file here and there, and make a mess in the filesystem. For example on my 10.10 system I have a few dozen ~/.recently-used.xbel.XXXXX and ~/.org.chromium.XXXX useless files. \n\n*Uninstalled applications often leave their config files in your home directory. \n\n*If there is a problem in your system, logs can grow huge - check the size of the /var/log and ~/.xsession-errors.\n\n*More often than not it is the user who leaves a lot of junk everywhere. Open up the Baobab disk space analyzer or any such to get an idea what has accumulated on your disk over time.\n\n*all the thumbnails get stored and are never cleared up even though you've deleted those pictures or will never use that photo CD again. \n\n*if there's a filesystem problem, your lost+found directory can grow too\n\n\nAn Ubuntu system does a good job of cleaning everything unnecessary, but from time to time the administrator has to weigh in...  \n\nA: File Cleaning / Space Saving / Privacy\nJust to give an idea, taking Windows as base. In windows you need to do a cleanup mostly every week if not every day (I use as an example the fact that I worked in over 30 cyber cafes which are in total more than 500+ PCs. The work the got from users made having to cleanup everyday a typical job.). In Ubuntu, this cleanup is actually not needed so often, but if you actually need to do it you have several command line tools like apt-get or aptitude that do a nice cleaning and GUI tools like ubuntu tweak that also do this. The cleanup for Ubuntu can be done every 6 to 12 months. Yes that is right, every so many months you can do it or in my case every 2 or 3 years.\nThis really depends on the amount of work you put the PC through. When I say work I mean, downloading files, moving files, creating files, deleting or copying files. All of this on a daily basis. Most Windows users know that the performance of any Windows degrades really fast if no optimizations are done. I have had cases where the user has gone a full year with no need to optimize anything and had other cases where the user had to literally format the PC after a month. It depends on the computer usage. The 1 year guy used the computer for word processing and internet only. The 1 month used it to download a lot of stuff, music, videos, games, deleted some, moved some, etc.. In all of this time, both did not do any optimizations.\nIn Ubuntu you do get a performance degradation, but from experience you need to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install many services that also create many files (LAMP Server, Mail Server, FTP Server, etc..). The performance will go down for about 5%. At least for a full year, that is all that will happen. You might see more performance lose but you need to wait a lot (Like a 3 to 5 year wait).  The immediate downside is the booting time and shutting time since you have services running that need to close client connections and such. Apart from that, there won't be a slowness as known in Windows.\n\n*Install many programs (Video Editors, Sound Editors, Games, etc..). Similar to the performance drop when installing services but not so much so. You can even install programs up to a point of using 99.99% of the hard drive space and Ubuntu will not create a performance drop. At least I tested this with Wine games and OpenGL games to see if they got hit with a performance drop using an HDD almost full.\nIf by performance and space wasted you are worry, then you can do the check every year or two since you will not be wasting a lot of space. Performance wise, Ubuntu (or any other distro for that matter) is not influence in performance by the amount of garbage left behind in the system that fills the HDD. That is a Windows problem not a Linux one where, if you get around 25% to 35% of the space left, the system starts slowing down (Shown more in Windows XP than in Vista or 7/8). Anyway, like I said before, having a 99.99% hard drive full of stuff will not slow you down. The only thing is you would need to clean your logs which are found in /var/log. This will increase overtime and the folder will hold many Megabytes or Gigabytes of information depending on the amount of time and the services installed. For a 6 month cycle, I get around 20MB in the log folder.\nIf you are really paranoid you have this command:\n(Only if you have aptitude installed)  \nsudo aptitude clean - Will erase downloaded packages from cache\nsudo aptitude autoclean - Will erase old downloaded packages from cache  \n(Use apt-get which already comes by default)  \nsudo apt-get clean - Will erase downloaded packages from cache\nsudo apt-get autoclean - Will erase old downloaded packages from cache\nFor GUI based  \nUbuntu Tweak\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:tualatrix/next  \nsudo apt-get update  \nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-tweak\n\nand then run ubuntu-tweak and there is an option called Janitor which is used for spring cleaning as seen in the picture:\n\nYou can also remove old compress log files from the system\nsudo rm -v /var/log/*.gz\n\nLastly there is a GUI Tool (Thank Uri in the comment for this. I forgot):\nBleachBit\n\nBleachBit is an advance cleaning utility for Ubuntu (Similar to CCleaner) and other distros that really, REALLY cleans the system. You can find it in the Software Center just by searching for bleach. What makes it different from the Ubuntu Tweak is that it searches for many common folders that many apps use to store cache/temp files. Apart from that improves a little bit the performance of browsers (since it cleans them out too) and libreoffice. There are a lot of more stuff BleachBit does but go to the site for more info. +1 Uri for the reminder.\nNote that this is usually done every so many months or years, not everyday or every week like in Windows. Linux and Ubuntu have a unique way of always been optimized for this type of \"problems\". And before you ask, Fragmentation in Ubuntu is a very hard thing to do. Fragmentation at the level we see in Windows takes many months, even years so a fragmentation of 2 months in Windows (And the slowness that comes with it) is roughly like 2 or 3 years in Linux (and even then is not slowed down like in Windows).\nFor a general check I have 2 1TB hard drives, one is 0.91% non-contiguous and the other is OMG!! 1.2% non-contiguous... after 2 years of everyday, constant use. So am guessing in 2050 I will eventually have to \"defragment\" the hard drive, unless I bought a new one or formatted the existing one ;).\nFor Energy Efficiency\nFor battery performance, it is known that the following tools do help:\nPowertop\nIt can save several minutes/hours of battery usage, increasing life of battery and performance of it.\nTo install: sudo apt-get install powertop\nTo run: sudo powertop\n\nJupiter\n(NOT available/needed since 13.04)\nRecommended reading Is there a power saving application similar to Jupiter?\nIt manages much better the battery usage and it gives longer battery time.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/jupiter  \nsudo apt-get update  \nsudo apt-get install jupiter\n\nTo run: Type jupiter in Dash or use the Jupiter Applet icon in the top panel.\n\nTLP\nIt is a good power management tool to monitor Watt usage:\nTo install: \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:linrunner/tlp  \nsudo apt-get update  \nsudo apt-get install tlp\n\nTo run: Just reboot, it will start as a service.\nThe only downside is that you need to tweak the configuration file in order to get the most out of your battery, but using tools like powerstat can let you know easily if you are optimizing it right or wrong.\n\nA: An apt-get clean to remove old package download archives once in a while doesn't go amiss, I'm not sure there's anything that does that automatically.\nLogs will be handled for you by logrotate.\n/tmp is cleaned out for you on every reboot.\n\nA: actually, it does need cleaning up, quite often in my opinion, the best app for that is bleach bit, its a little like the famous CCleaner on windows, Bleachbit is in the software centre\ncleans up your firefox cache, apt cache, empties trash etc etc, it should come peinstalled in ubuntu to be honest, if you have been running your system a while, you could potentally free up hundreds of MBs on first run of bleachbit\n\n\nA: hello  IMHO ubuntu does need that too with time pass you install/remove things  lets say you ll have some config files that you dont need anymore beside that some orphane packages of course some thumbs ...  , you can try bleachbit \n\nA: Ubuntu and other flavors of Linux don't really need cleaning up as you might do in Windows.  Over time, of course, you might accumulate things on your computer that you might not wish to keep - old documents, no-longer-used programs, etc. - but there is nothing really akin to the Windows registry that simply builds up clutter that slows your computer.  The old stuff you save won't slow down your computer: it will probably run as fast a year from now as it does today.\nI go through things from time to time to keep things neat and clean, because I like being organized, and that includes getting rid of old stuff.  However, unless I decide to change settings or remove startup programs or something like that, my neatness obsession doesn't affect my computer's performance.\n", "Q: How do I disable the orange resizing of windows when I put them up against the edge of the screen?

As an example 2.1 GHZ core2Duo can run 1.2GHZ 1.3GZ 1.6GZ ... 2.1GHZ. To save power ubuntu run your processor in slowest mode. So solution is scale your cpu's frequency manually. (Don't worry it is very very very much safe, it is not over-clocking)\nTo do this install a indicator\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:artfwo/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install indicator-cpufreq\n\nAfter installation, run it (Press Alt+F2, write indicator-cpufreq which will add an icon in your ubuntu's system tray). Select \"on-demand\" which means cpu will be run in highest frequency it is necessary. If your cpu performance is low then select Performance from indicator which will run your cpu in highest speed all the time. Or you can select any frequency which is listed(supported by your cpu) \n\nA: In addition to what shantanu said, the graphics processor may run in low-performance mode, when your computer runs on battery power.\nFor example, if you have AMD (ATi) GPU and propietary drivers, then you may have \"PowerPlay\" enabled. To disable it, go to Catalyst Control Center and you will find a \"PowerPlay\" page in the sidebar.

I hope I have made myself clear enough.\nEDIT: This issue probably pertains to Google Chrome browser only. As you can see in the comments, it's fine with Mozilla Firefox.\n\nA: Looks like many have got adjusted with it, the way it is. FWIW, I realized that the \"Recently Used\" feature in Gnome/Unity shows the most recently changed / downloaded files (not folders).\nSince I first download the image that I want add to my blog post, the image(s) is always shown among those \"Recently Used\". I didn't notice that at first.\nThe point is, I (and we) want the browser -- here we are talking about Chrome -- to use the same folder/directory as downloads and uploads location. That is, if I download a file, it should go to the \"XXX\" directory, and when I browse to upload a file, the browser should directly take me to that folder (XXX), instead of the default folders like Pictures, Downloads etc.\nWhat you should realize is that the \"Recently Used\" feature does the same thing, but in quite a different way.

At terminal type sudo apt-get remove --purge banshee, press ENTER key and do the same for the Firefox. Next type sudo apt-get autoremove ,to clear the system of any residing file.  \nTo remove the PPA from repository copy and paste the following into your terminal sudo ppa-purge ppa:ubuntu-mozilla-daily/ppa/firefox-aurora/ubuntu oneiric  && ppa:banshee-team/ppa/ubuntu oneiric.\nAs for the Firefox browser, you can download it from the official website if you are looking for the latest and follow instruction as prescribed on the site. Regarding Banshee, the truth is that Banshee will only allow you the repository for the stable release, though,you would be allowed to download the latest release for Ubuntu that will always return you back to the stable release. \n", "Q: How to remove session entries from LightDM? I recently added Cairo Dock to my GNOME Shell in 11.10. Cairo Dock is GREAT, but I'm left with one little problem that I'd like to fix: after installing Cairo Dock, LightDM includes two extraneous entries to non-working desktops.  (The entries to working desktops remain unaffected, so I guess I could just ignore the extraneous entries, but...)\nSo I'd like to remove/edit the extraneous entries in LightDM.  I've looked and looked for discussions on how to do so, but haven't had much luck.\nAny suggestions on how to go about editing the login menu in 11.10?\n\nA: The list of sessions is defined by the .desktop files in the folder /usr/share/xsessions\n\nLets remove GNOME Classic\nIn a terminal:\ncd /usr/share/xsessions\nsudo mv gnome-classic.desktop gnome-classic.desktop.backup\n\nThis renames the gnome-classic desktop file\nLogout - the new list of sessions will look like:\n\n\nA: Your package maintainers will be proud of you if you do it as follows:\nsudo mkdir /usr/share/xsessions/hidden\nsudo dpkg-divert --rename \\\n      --divert /usr/share/xsessions/hidden/gnome-classic.desktop \\\n      --add /usr/share/xsessions/gnome-classic.desktop\n\nWhat this does is to instruct the package manager to remember a new location for the file.  This has several advantages over the other answers:\n\n\n*\n\n*It guarantees a future package install/upgrade won't revert your change\n\n*It works with other display managers (lxdm for example lists .backup entries)\n\n*You can revert it easily if you change your mind with:\nsudo dpkg-divert --rename --remove /usr/share/xsessions/gnome-classic.desktop\n\nA: *\n\n*Open terminal with Ctrl-Alt-T\n\n*cd /usr/share/xsessions\n\n*ls will show you, for example:\n\nawesome.desktop  gnome-shell.desktop  ubuntu.desktop\ngnome.desktop    ubuntu-2d.desktop\n\n*Use sudo rm lubuntu.desktop (or whatever) to remove the ones you don't need any longer.\n\n*Logout and you should see the changes -- if not, reboot and you will see them.\n\n", "Q: Error 131:4 when running Photoshop CS5 with wine? I installed Photoshop CS5 following the instructions on WineHQ, but receive the 131:4 error with all of the CS5 programs. Is there a workaround for this?\n\nA: As it looks this is still a problem not resolved in Wine and from the look of the data provided by the last user test in Wine, in 1.5 it has other problems. Your only solution is to go back to the specific 1.3 version that had CS5 working (including the workaround to get it working) or wait for Wine to fix problems related to CS5.\nI suggest to file a bug report in Wine and upvote CS5 to help development.\n", "Q: How do I get an application to appear as a choice in update-alternatives? I separately installed the Firefox Beta and Alpha channels, and have desktop configuration files pointing to them in ~/.local/share/applications. However, stable Firefox is being used as my default browser by the system. (Firefox Beta used to be used until I messed with the \"Default Applications\" in System Settings, where it is not listed.)\nI tried running sudo update-alternatives --config x-www-browser to manually change it, but it's only recognizing Chromium and Firefox (stable) and showing them as a choice.\nWhat can I do to get custom desktop configuration files in ~/.local/share/applications to be seen as default alternatives? I think I may have to fiddle with the desktop config files, or with mimeinfo.cache or mimeapps.list?\nRunning Oneiric.\nHere is the content of the firefox-beta.desktop file I created:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Firefox Beta\nExec=firefox-beta -P Beta -no-remote\nIcon=firefox\nTerminal=false\nX-MultipleArgs=false\nType=Application\nStartupNotify=true\nStartupWMClass=Firefox\nCategories=GNOME;GTK;Network;WebBrowser;\nComment[en_US]=Firefox Beta Channel\nMimeType=text/html;text/xml;application/xhtml+xml;application/xml;application/vnd.mozilla.xul+xml;application/rss+xml;application/rdf+xml;image/gif;image/jpeg;image/png;x-scheme-handler/http;x-scheme-handler/https;x-scheme-handler/ftp;x-scheme-handler/chrome;video/webm;\nName[en_US]=Firefox Beta\n\n[NewWindow Shortcut Group]\nName=Open a New Window\nExec=firefox-beta -new-window about:blank\nTargetEnvironment=Unity\n\n\nA: You're looking for the this command:\nsudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/x-www-browser x-www-browser /path/to/firefox-beta 100\n\nThat adds /path/to/firefox-beta to the x-www-browser alternatives with a priority of 100 (auto-switching to it unless there's something else with a higher priority).  You can then use update-alternatives --config as usual.  To remove it, run the following:\nsudo update-alternatives --remove x-www-browser /path/to/firefox-beta\n\nThis removes that particular entry from the alternatives for x-www-browser.\n", "Q: MacBookPro 7,1 can only see one cpu On a MacBookPro 7,1 running ubuntu 11.10, System monitor only sees 1 core (instead of 2).\ncat /proc/cpuinfo | grep 'cpu cores'\n\nalso gives:\ncpu cores   : 1\n\nI followed this guide and added acpi_apic_instance=2 to the line with GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT, but that doesn't seem to change the situation.\nWhat can I do?\nI'm using rEFIt, installed under MacOS, and running in dual boot with MacOS.

Or is there a project I can join to participate in the dictionaries editing?\n\nA: Libreoffice is not developed by the Ubuntu development community.

You need to research how Hunspell creates dictionaries.\nRegards.\n\nA: The user dictionary is just for personal use. LibreOffice does not actually collect words for dictionaries, instead it just assembles existing ones.

First, this is not a duplicate of \nHow can I always show the close, minimise & maximise buttons into their own windows?\n- I would like to preserve global menus.\nIs there a way to only always show the  close, minimise and maximise buttons on every application?\nThe use case is as follows: I have a maximized application in the background, over it is a not-maximized application that has got focus. I want to close the maximized application. I move the pointer to upper left corner. The buttons do not show, since the background application does not have focus.

I've basically settled into Unity, but one constant that is kind of giving me agita is that in LibreOffice Calc (and Writer) ctrl-f does nothing. I can go to edit > find ... and the edit menu even suggests ctrl-f as a keyboard shortcut, but actually typing it doesn't do anything. ctrl-alt-f works fine. The only thing that doesn't work is ctrl-f. I had a really hard time getting settled with Unity (mostly trying to get my old Gnome-do and Compiz settings back) so I spent a lot of time monkeying with the Compiz Settings Manager. But I can't figure out where I would have unset/ overrode this. Plus, it isn't like ctrl-f does something unexpected. It just does nothing. \n\nA: You need to re-map the Ctrl-F keyboard action to 'Find & Replace'.\nNOTE: The dialog box (Tools >> Customize >> Keyboard) is hard to use, and I was unable to find the existing 'quick find' that is currently mapped to Ctrl-F.\nAfter several attempts, I was able to map:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shortcut keys: Ctrl-F - to - Category: 'Edit', Function: 'Find & Replace'\n\n*Shortcut keys: F3 - to - Category: 'Edit', Function: 'Repeat Search'\n\n*Shortcut keys: Ctrl-Shift-F - to - ( left blank )\n\n\n( This clearly needs work, by the LibreOffice maintainers. )\n\nA: Try this: go to View > Toolbars and check 'Find'. This adds a 'Find' dialog on the toolbar. When you click ctrl-f the cursor jumps to that toolbar, then enter the search term, and hit enter, or use the arrows to search up or down. \n\nA: Here I found a simple solution: after deleting $HOME/.libreoffice it worked again. Magic.\n\nA: I don't seem to have enough karma right now to comment after geoffrey's answer.\nHowever, this could help: first I detached (\"undocked\") the Find toolbar. This seem to prevent it from materializing docked but out of signt.\nThen, I noticed that pressing CTRL+F once make the toolbar appear, but not focus it; pressing it a second time does focus it.\nGranted, this is a bug and should be fixed; but in the meantime, this workaround proved quite useful.\n", "Q: Cannot move Screenlets in GNOME Shell I have searched around and can't seem to find an answer. I have installed the 0.1.4 version of Screenlets on Ubuntu 11.10 running GNOME Shell, and everything functions okay except that I cannot move them. I can't seem to find any documentation about this problem; any help is appreciated!\n\nA: This is fixed in screenlets revision 740 (see http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~screenlets-dev/screenlets/trunk/revision/740). If you install Screenlets from Dev PPA, you can move Screenlets by dragging them.\nTo enable Development versions PPA:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:screenlets-dev/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install screenlets\n\n\nA: I can't find a fix for this either but I did notice that you can adjust the X,Y position in the screenlets properties. It's not nearly as quick/easy, but it works. \nIf you restart GNOME Shell (Alt+F2, then enter \"r\" and hit ENTER) then you can move the screenlet as long as it's window property is not set to \"Lock\". For some reason, this only works if done right after restarting GNOME Shell, and once you click on anything else, the widgets all are locked in place again. \n\nA: In 12.04, installing from the ppa above did not help. It installs version 0.1.7, which sounds different from 740. \nSelecting or deselecting the Window>Widget option does not work either. \nUsing the X/Y position scrolling in the widget properties is the only option that allowed me to move either the clock or countdown widgets.\n", "Q: How do I Install MythTV on a Lenovo S12 with wireless?

My Microsoft Lifecam VX-2000 webcam works with Skype and Cheese, but the image is a little dark on Skype. I adjust it on Cheese but the changes don't reflect in Skype (I think this was expected anyway). Also during the installation of Ubuntu when it prompts if I wanna take a picture with my webcam the image was crystal clear, in Cheese and Skype the image is a little curly.\nHow I can adjust the image to make it look brighter and less curly, if possible?\n\nA: Use guvcview, which is a GTK+ interface for Linux USB Video Class (UVC) devices. It will allow you to make adjustments to the web camera.\nTo install this in Ubuntu via the terminal, type sudo apt-get install guvcview. Or you can install it via the Ubuntu Software Center or other dpkg-frontends.\n\nA: guvcview did not work for me. I could fix it with luvcview which has a setting called \"Exposure\". I had to decrease it, this reduced the framerate but improved the brightness as well.\nEdit: Now, I have found out that guvcview seems to be more or less only a new GUI over luvcview. I have checked guvcview again and noticed that there is a scroll bar on the right side. There, you can also access the \"Exposure\"-setting.\n", "Q: Will my Microsoft OS and programs still \"talk\" on the Internet when I am using a LiveCD? Will my Microsoft operating system and programs still \"talk\" on the Internet when I am using a LiveCD?\nFor example,\n\n\n*\n\n*will the Microsoft operating system still talk to gain updates?\n\n*will Office still check to see if it has a proper serial activation code?\n\n*is my OS system details and registration still communicating to Microsoft?\n\n\nA: No. When you are running an Ubuntu LiveCD session, you are (temporarily) running a completely different operating system. Your installed operating system and programs will not be able to run or connect to the Internet during this time.\n\nA: No, Windows and Ubuntu are completely separate things, whether you install it or run a live session. You can also install Ubuntu without removing Windows, and in that case, you'll just choose between Windows and Ubuntu at startup. When you run Ubuntu, it will be as if you don't have Windows installed and when you run Windows, it will be as if you don't have Ubuntu installed. Actually, Windows isn't even capable of knowing that you have installed Ubuntu at all. It will look to Windows as if the harddisk har shrunk in size. Ubuntu is able to read Windows' filesystems, though, so you can access Windows-files in Ubuntu, but not Ubuntu-files in Windows. One benefit of that, is that even if something happens to your Windows-install that makes it unusable, because of malware, or something like that, Ubuntu will still work as good as ever. That malware would also not be able to \"infect\" Ubuntu in any way. \nYou should also note that there is nothing in Ubuntu that requires permission, registration or anything like that -- including the installed office application; LibreOffice. It is also very compatible with MS Office. If you install Ubuntu, it will run much faster than the live session. \n", "Q: mythbuntu epg cron job not working I've got a problem with my EPG grabber script 'shepherd' for the Australian EPG.

These APIs rely on the glib event loop running to receive the replies from the keyring daemon.\nYour application does not appear to be running the event loop, and exits before the responses to your keyring daemon requests can be answered, which would explain the problems you've seen.\nThere are two ways you could fix this problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Modify your application to run the main loop so that it can receive the responses.\n\n*Use the synchronous versions of the APIs (i.e. gnome_keyring_store_password_sync and gnome_keyring_find_password_sync), so the library calls block waiting for responses instead.\n\n\nIf you are writing a graphical application you're probably already doing (1), so you're using the right API.  It might just be a case of modifying your test programs to also run the main loop.\nIf you are writing a command line script then blocking behaviour is probably not a big issue, so using the synchronous API will make your life a lot easier.\n", "Q: Dell Latitude E6520 overheating I'm a newcomer to Ubuntu 11.10.

That's not a problem--just type it in and press Enter. Your password is being received. The reason nothing is echoed back to you is for security--so that people looking at the screen (or at a log from the Terminal) don't know how many characters your password is.\nIf you enter your password and press Enter and it tells you that it's wrong, then make sure that Caps Lock was not on when you entered it. Make sure that you're putting in the password appropriate to the task--in the Terminal, when you are prompted for a password, this is almost always your user password, that is, the password you'd use to log in and/or unlock the screen. (If you ran a command in the Terminal that started with sudo, then it is definitely your user password.) Your user password is not necessarily the same as your keyring password. (Also, you might not have a keyring password, but you certainly have a user password.)\nIf you do not remember your password, you can reset it using this technique.\n", "Q: Where does Juju store a log of all commands run and their output for each unit? Sometimes when deploying a service (and more specifically a new unit) for a Juju charm, an error occurs and there seems to be no way of finding out exactly what it was.\nIs there some sort of output log of all commands the unit ran?\n\nA: It appears that each unit stores a log of the commands run in /var/log/juju/unit/unit-service_name-service_number.log. You can access it by taking advantage of Juju's ssh command like so:\njuju ssh service_name/service_number\nThis will drop you into a shell for that unit. You can then use a text editor or even just cat | less to read the log.\n\nA: you can use juju debug-log to get a distributed log of all operations by all agents. It allows suppressing things by log level, so give juju debug-log -h a read. It does miss a few things, but for the most part it should give you what you are looking for.\nThe following command shows all the logs from the beginning of time.

It was stuck at Ubuntu Logo. I waited for sometime and finally powered off mu laptop. I want to know what happens if i power off my laptop. In what ways its harms OS and/or hardware. \n\nA: \nIn what ways its harms OS and/or hardware.\n\nIt can cause hard disk errors, but that can happen using any OS, not just ubuntu. Fortunately, chances of that happening are very small.\n\nA: When you are shutting down a system properly, the OS has a number of housekeeping things to do, ranging from physically writing dirty disk blocks to safely closing all the open programs from spreadsheet to a database program.\nNow, when you force shutdown a PC/Laptop, the power goes off in a few milliseconds time and the OS has no time to finish all these functionality. So, You can categories these errors as two parts,\n\n\n*\n\n*Hard Errors, errors which causes hardware defects : These are mainly caused because of power supplies. There is a definite reason why PC has a SMPS installed. When power goes off immediately, it can cause many defects in motherboard and hard disk. Motherboard errors are rare, but hard disk errors can be expected, if you are a frequent user of \"disruptive shutdown\"(this is an MS terminology).\n\n*Soft Errors, errors which causes software malfunction : These are software errors, due to incomplete configuration file or presence of temporary file. These errors are recoverable and non-lethal.\n\n", "Q: How to pre-configure (configure defaults for new users) KDE? I'm trying to figure out how to configure KDE for new users. That is: setting up KDE and make these settings default for every user upon her first login. I know that there's /etc/skel but it's not working nicely because KDE writes user- and machine-specific stuff in its users configuration files and I want this to work for every user on every machine. Also modifying stuff in /usr/share seems wrong to me as well as stuff there could get overwritten by an update or - even worse - modifications there could make auto upgrade fail.\nSo, is there a standard way of doing this?\nThanks\n\nA: You can always go the \"long way\". Create a dummy user, login into kde, configure it as you like and then:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the entire ~/.kde (or ~/.kde4, I don't have access to a KDE machine now to check) \ndirectory to a common place;\n\n*When you add a user to the system, copy in its home the .kde dir you previously saved;\n\n*When you are confident it works, make a script to do it automatically.\n\n\nEDIT\nAs per comment below i've already done this in the past, both across users and machines. IIRC was one of the early KDE 4.X releases, it's been a while so maybe something have changed. It even worked for application specific configurations like amarok and kopete.\nTo be honest, I never tried the /etc/skel thing (which I know it's there for this exact reason, to have a default set of dotfiles for new user accounts) but maybe (don't really know!) doesn't work too good with directory trees? Manually copying the .kde dir has worked for me, though.\n", "Q: Terminal line glitches, text gets displayed as overwritten or command text appears in prompt area I installed Ubuntu 11.10 mini + LXDE and wanted to make my command line different in terminal (than just plain white), so I added blue color to path line (everything until $ sign) and it works fine but I have two strange glitches now:\n\n*\n\n*When I write a line which is longer than terminal window, instead of starting at next line it starts at the same one, overwriting everything which was in there.\n\n*Sometimes while navigating over previous commands (up/down arrow keys) some part of command gets stuck and is treated as part of prompt (the blue text), but it is white and is non-deletable and is not taken as part of command when I press enter.\n\nWhat could I have messed up? The bad thing is that I don't remember what exactly I changed, but I'm sure I changed only one line in .bashrc\nEdit: For anyone else who is interested in customizing the prompt, here's a nice tutorial . Make sure you don't miss any symbols (especially '' ones) and everything works fine.\n\nA: I'm very late, but the problem here is that Bash doesn't know where to place the cursor, because it interprets the special colour code characters as normal text. This is fixed by putting \\[ and \\] tags around the colour codes. Instead of writing \\e[1;31m to make text red, you should write \\[\\e[1;31m\\].\nIf you're having this problem, carefully check all colour escape codes to see if they have those tags around them.\n\nA: The default bashrc can be found in /etc/skel/.bashrc. I would suggest you make a backup of your current bashrc, then replace your bashrc with the one in skel, then see if the problems still occur. Then if they don't, backup and edit your new bashrc, putting comments in saying what you did!! \n\nA: I had the same symptoms, but in my case the problem was the ASCII bell escape sequence \\a in my Bash prompt which leaded to the problem. The color codes were correctly enclosed by brackets (thanks @ringstaart).\nMy problematic Bash prompt setting in .bashrc was (omitting the color variable definitions):\nPS1=\"\\[$BLUE\\]\\u@\\h: \\[$YELLOW\\]\\w\\a\\\\[$PURPLE\\]\\[$WHITE\\]\\$ \"\n\nSimply removing the \\a solved the problem:\nPS1=\"\\[$BLUE\\]\\u@\\h: \\[$YELLOW\\]\\w\\\\[$PURPLE\\]\\[$WHITE\\]\\$ \"\n\n", "Q: Could not calculate upgrade from Maverick Meerkat to Natty Narwhal I upgraded from Ubuntu Lucid Lynx to Maverick Meerkat with the following commands:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get install update-manager-core\nsudo vi /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades\n\nand changed the last line to Prompt=normal\nsudo do-release-upgrade -d\n\nThis upgrade was OK.\nI decided to repeat the same steps and to upgrade Maverick Meerkat to Natty Narwhal.\nIt ended with this message:\n\nBuilding data structures...

Here's why it doesn't work:\nlsb_release -a\n\nprints:\nDistributor ID: LinuxMint\nDescription: Linux Mint 12 Fluxbox\nRelease: 12\nCodename: lisa\n\nand that can be corrected to keep Mint-Mate by doing this:\ngksu gedit /etc/*release\n\nand change everything in the file gedit brings up to:\nDISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu\nDISTRIB_RELEASE=11.10\nDISTRIB_CODENAME=Oneric\nDISTRIB_DESCRIPTION=\"Ubuntu 11.10\"\n\nThen run:\ngksu gedit /etc/*issue\n\nand change to:\nUbuntu 11.10 \\n \\l\n\nWorked great for me though Mate seems a bit rough around the edges but as I am purely testing Oneric in VBox it's no matter\n\nA: I tried resetting lsb-release and *issue, but for some reason, they always revert to linux mint. I'm not sure if they reset on each restart, or on each update, but they do reset frequently.\nI wrote a small script which I manually run every now and then:\n#!/bin/sh\n\necho \"Restoring /etc/lsb-release ...\" && \\\necho \"DISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu\" > /etc/lsb-release && \\\necho \"DISTRIB_RELEASE=11.10\" >> /etc/lsb-release && \\\necho \"DISTRIB_CODENAME=oneiric\" >> /etc/lsb-release && \\\necho \"DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION=Ubuntu 11.10\" >> /etc/lsb-release && \\\necho \"Restoring /etc/*issue ...\" && \\\necho \"Ubuntu 11.10 \\\\n \\\\l\" > /etc/*issue && \\\necho \"Done.\"\n\nSave as (for example) fixubuntu.sh and set execution permissions on it (chmod 755 fixubuntu.sh), and execute as root (sudo ./fixrelease.sh) every time you want to restore your ubuntu release information.\nOf course, you might want to run the script automatically at every boot. Just make sure it is run as root.\n", "Q: MySQL database in tasksel LAMP stack for osCommerce I'm experimenting with osCommerce, an e-commerce suite, for which I installed the LAMP stack using tasksel. It did ask for a \"root password\" for MySQL, but other that that I did not pay attention to the installation procedure. Now I'm faced with the following screen, with no idea with what goes where:\n\nSo my question is what are the default options, and how do I find all the details?\n\nA: First, you should create a MySQL user for osCommerce to use. It's bad practise to use the root user/pass for a web application.\nIn a shell on the machine with the MySQL on it, do:\nmysql -u root -p\n\nEnter the root password you previously specified. This gets you a prompt which has full access to your mysql server.\nNow, pick a database name - it doesn't matter what it is really so long as it's unique on the mysql server (to see existing ones: SHOW DATABASES;)\nWhen you've decided on it:\nCREATE DATABASE dbname;\n\nFor example, I'd probably just pick oscommerce.\nNow you have to give a new user access to that database. Pick a username and password (the username can be oscommerce again, but make a secure password) - replace dbname here with what you chose a second ago:\nGRANT ALL ON dbname.* TO username IDENTIFIED BY 'password';\n\nDone. Now you have the details to put into your webform; the servername is just localhost or 127.0.0.1 (assuming the webserver is the same machine as the MySQL server), the user and password you just made, the database name is whatever you replaced dbname with. Port can be left empty.\n\nA: Database server: 127.0.0.1 (if it is on the same computer, else the ip address of the remote host)\nuser name: ny MySQL user name. If you just set up mysql you should login to mysql on the local host and setup a user for your project (use the mysql commant in terminal). I do not suggest to use the database root user, however, this should work as well:\nmysql -u root -p\n\nfollow these instructions:\nadding users\nPassword: the password of the user specified before\nDatabase Name: on your mysql database server there exists no database. So again, login into mysql, but this time with the user you just created. Then follow these instructions to generate a database. You then have to fill in the database name in your form:\nCreate Database\nDatabase Server Port: leave empty should work. Keep the other settings as they are.\n\nA: If you dont know the password, maybe it is just blank. If dont, to reset the root password you can follow this guide: MySQL Doc. \nDatabase server is localhost unless you have osCommerce and MySQL in different machines. For username you could use root, but if you use this in a production environment, using a more limited user will be better. Password is the password you choose during reset process.\nTo create the database, you can login to mysql (remove -p switch if password is blank):\nmysql -u root -p\n\nAnd then use the following statement to show the databases in the system:\nmysql > CREATE DATABASE the_name_you_want; \n\nServer port is 3306.\n", "Q: Problems with LibreOffice Impress? I am a big fan of Ubuntu. I have recently switched from Latex to LibreOffice Impress for PPT because it seems that with Impress you can quickly create slides. I am using LibreOffice 3.4.4 OOO340m1 (Build:402) on Ubuntu 11.04. I am saving them as .ppt format. However, facing the following problems. It is really frustrating and forcing me to use Windows/MAC just for making slides. \n\n\n*\n\n*Font is changing from Arial to TimesNewRoman specifically for Tables when I reopen an Impress presentation. \n\n*Tables are stretched if I reopen an Impress presentation. Impress is not allowing me to compress them (the stretched tables) and I have needed to make a fresh table.\n\n*Several other modifications are reverting back when I reopen an Impress presentation. For example, the \"transparency\" change to the borders (e.g., for rectangular shape).\n\n*Arbitrarily Impress is crashing. \nIt would be great if someone help me to resolve these issues. \nThanks. \n\nA: LibreOffice support for ppt format is far from perfect and quite worse than support for doc or xls. The problems that you are experiencing are expected.\nYou should save your slides as .odp, the OpenOffice native format and only use ppt when you want to share it with another people. That way they will keep the same when you save and open then. \nUnluckily you can still experience issues when you export then to ppt, if you need perfect compatibility, you will need to use PowerPoint or convince the other part to use Impress or a more compatible program.\nOne off-topic idea is to ask your teacher to use Google Docs. It could be easier to sell it to a teacher focusing in its collaboration features.\n\nA: If your teacher only have to print and mark your slide show then you can export your slide show as a pdf file. Just go to file- export as pdf. Your teacher can make annotations using adobe/firefox if he/she needs to make recommendations.\n\nA: It would be better to save it as an odp (open document presentation) and click on the pdf button on the toolbar and send your presentation as a pdf. You can't have transitions etc with this method, but it gets over the problem of having things in the wrong place.\n", "Q: mapping C:\\ path I have eclipse plug-in that was written under windows and uses \"C:\\\" a lot. is there any way to map \"C:\\\" to any chosen dir?\nP.S. I do know I can run it under wine, but that is not what I want.\n\nA: Assuming that Eclipse has a knowable current directory (maybe where it was launched?), you can just create a directory/soft-link/bind-mount there that is named \"C:\", and that will solve the first problem.\nThe next problem is that '\\' is not a directory separator on Linux. If you're very lucky there may be translation layer somewhere in Eclipse that fixes that for you, but otherwise, you can just create files with very long file names that look like Windows pathnames. (e.g.   C:\\WINDOWS\\whatever.txt is a perfectly valid filename on Linux.)\nReally though, the best thing would be to give the author of the plugin a good beating with a clue bat (ok, submit a bug) - I mean, this won't even work nice on all Windows machines.\nIf all else fails, edit the plugin with a binary editor, just remember to leave the strings the same length (and hope that nothing does a check-sum).\n\nA: You may create a file like \"C:\\boot.ini\" on linux in the root directory with root permission, which is not recommendet, but maybe fine on a single user machine. \nHowever, to use the plugin, a file \"C:\\boot.ini\" is searched in the local directory, so you would need symbolic link or copy in every directory from where you try to use the file, since \"C:\\\" is not recognized as a partition. \nIf there is a directory with multiple files, there is no practical way to use it - get the source of the plugin, if possible, or inform the author. \nAbsolute paths are a no go for compatible, transferable software. A typical mistake from windows-only-guys.\n", "Q: No keyboard input until after GRUB I have a computer that I dual boot between Ubuntu 11.10 and Windows 7. I installed Windows first, and Ubuntu second.\nWhen I boot, the GRUB menu comes up, showing me the option to select to boot to Ubuntu at the top of the list, and to boot to Windows at the bottom.\nUnfortunately, as far as I can tell, any key I press on the keyboard (connected by USB) does not get any response, so I can't actually select to boot to anything but Ubuntu (which is the default selection).\nOnce Ubuntu loads and I am at the log in screen, then the keyboard (and mouse) work perfectly normally thereafter.\nWhy would my keyboard not work only during GRUB? And how do I fix it?\n\nA: Solution: First attach a serial port keyboard. Go into BIOS settings and enable legacy USB support. Then reboot with just USB keyboards. Grub is now accessible.\n", "Q: eeepc 1018pb dual display wrong resolution size My Setup:\n\n\n*\n\n*eeepc 1018pb with Intel GMA 3150.\n\n*Ubuntu 11.10 x64_86\n\n*Samsung SyncMaster 2333\n\n\nThe Problem:\nI connect the Samsung with the eeepc. Ubuntu recognizes the Display.\nWhen I try to activate it and set the native resolution (1920x1080), I get the following Error:\n\nThe selected configuration for display could not be applied Requested size(2944, 1080) exceeds 3D hardware limit (2048, 2048)...\n\nNote that the width is exactly 1024px larger than I selected. This offset is kept for any resolution I choose.\nIf I choose a resolution with a width smaller than 1024 it applies exactly the selected resolution. So I guess the error occurs only during the \"error checking\". Which is a little bit funny.\nSo basically I have no idea how to fix this. I searched for two days know without any usable result.\nI looked for new drivers, but I couldn't find anything besides http://intellinuxgraphics.org. But as I understood this drivers are already used by Ubuntu natively. Besides I have no idea how to install them by hand.\n\n\n*\n\n*jockey-gtk doesn't even suggest graphic drivers.\n\n\nA: I guess you will not be able to fix this, at least not with Unity 3D (I guess you use this). The reason: when using two screens, the screens are represented as one big screen. No matter whether the two small screens are merged side by side or over each other, you exceed the maximum resolution of the graphics hardware.\nSolutions are: live without 3D support, means try Unity 2D or another desktop manager without 3D hardware acceleration.\nor\nChoose a resolution (of the internal or external screen) where either the sum of the horizontal or the sum of the vertical pixles is <= 2048\n", "Q: What do I multiply in this matrix calculation to configure my touchscreen? I use 2 displays (1920x1080 touchscreen on the left, 1440x900 on the right).\nIf I ever use\nxinput set-prop \"Acer T230H\" \"Coordinate Transformation Matrix\" 0.566 0 0 0 .71111 0 0 0 1\n\n(as matrix value)\n0.566    0       0\n0        0.71111 0\n0        0       1\n\nthe x-coordinate is caluclated correctly, but the y-coordinate is must be multiplyed by ~1.2 to be correct.\nWhere do i have to place my 1.2?\n\nA: If you want to scale the y coordinate, you should multiply 0.71111 by your scaling factor 1.2. The general formula is:\nif the matrix is\na b c\nd e f\ng h i\n\nthen the formula is\nnew_x = (a * old_x + b * old_y + c) / (g * old_x + h * old_y + i)\nnew_y = (d * old_x + e * old_y + f) / (g * old_x + h * old_y + i)\n\nThis is a projective transformation. In almost all cases (meaning, all cases unless your display is a beamer that projects skewly on a wall), you just need a linear transformation, so you  set g h i to 0 0 1.\nIf you're ever going to do more advanced stuff, then you should know that for the porpose of this calculation, old_x/new_x etc are in the range between 0 and 1.\n", "Q: Force a particular kernel for booting At the moment I have a 3.1 kernel installed from elsewhere and the regular 3.0.12 (upgraded to 3.0.13 today) kernel from the repos. When booting up, GRUB will choose 3.1 by default. I want it to choose 3.0.12/13 by default. How can I make it do that?\n\nA: Edit /etc/default/grub with your favorite text editor, ie\n\nsudo nano /etc/default/grub\n\nLocate the line\nGRUB_DEFAULT=0\n\nChange it to the line you want to boot from default, to see which line you want press the key Shift right after your computer computer's POST and keep it pressed, Grub will show the lines available to boot, the fist one is 0, the 2nd one is 1, etc. Insert the value you want in GRUB_DEFAULT=.\n\nA: I liked Bruno's suggestion but all my secondary options were under a \"Previous Linux versions\" submenu, so I wasn't 100% sure how that would affect the numbering, and I'd prefer a GUI option if there is one.\nFirstly, do not use StartUp-Manager (startupmanager), it is no longer maintained and according to reviews in the Software Center no longer works.\nInstead install Grub Customizer, recommended by the author of StartUp-Manager and currently only available from a PPA.\nOnce installed, run it and select Preferences. In the first tab (General) there is an option for defaults. \"Previous Linux versions\" are marked 4 > 1, 4 > 2 and so on. Select the one you want.\n", "Q: Restore Grub - Cannot Find File I had Ubuntu and Win 7 on different partitions. And then i formatted partition which containing Win 7 and reinstall Win 7. And then dual boot screen disappeared. I'm following tohuwawohu's answer.\nMy HDD partition is sda5 which Ubuntu installed.\nNow i'm trying to boot my computer, after BIOS loading , i'm getting GRUB command prompt screen (screenshot) directly.\nTO solve it, i'm following this steps .\nREsult is like this : \n\nA: I assume those steps relate to grub, not grub2. With grub2, the file structure has changed, so there are no more stage file in the grub directory. In this thread, under #13, you will find a description how to restore grub2 from a LiveCD. EDIT2: It has the following steps (credits drs305):\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot the Ubuntu Live CD (Try without installing).\n\n*From the Desktop, open a terminal - Applications, Accessories, Terminal.\n\n*Determine your normal system partition - sudo fdisk -l (That is a lowercase L).\nIf you aren't sure, run df -Th. Look for the correct disk size and ext3 or ext4 format.\n\n*Mount your normal system partition:\n\nsudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt\n\n\n\n*\n\n*If you aren't sure if you mounted the correct partition, once it's mounted run \"nautilus /mnt\" to inspect the partition. If it is the correct partition, you should see the normal Ubuntu folders such as /bin, /boot, /etc, /home, etc\n\n*Example: sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt\n\n*Note: The partition to mount is normally the partition on which Ubuntu was installed: sda1, sdb5, etc. If you have a separate /boot partition, use the device on which the /boot partition is located. Grub 2 works best when installed in the MBR of the drive to which BIOS boots. Also remember that you mount the partition (including the number) in this step, but you do not include the partition number when you run the \"sudo grub-install\" command later.\n\n*Note: GRUB 2 counts the first drive (X) as \"0\", but the first partition (Y) as \"1\"\n\n\n*Only if you have a separate boot partition:\n\nsudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt/boot\n\nwith sdXY being your /boot partition designation.\n\n*Reinstall GRUB 2:\n\nsudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt /dev/sdX\n\nDo NOT include the partition number.\n\n*Example:\n\nsudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt /dev/sda\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Note: Substitute the device on which Ubuntu was installed - sda, sdb, etc. Do NOT specify a partition number.\n\n\n*Unmount the partition *:\n\nsudo umount /mnt\n\n\n*\n\n*Note: If you mounted a separate /boot partition, unmount it first:\n\nsudo umount /mnt/boot\n  \n\n\n*Reboot.\n\n*After reboot: Update the grub menu using sudo update-grub\nHere's another description. Good luck!\nEDIT1: Some more information is also available in the Ubuntu Wiki on grub2.\n\nA: I had a similar error , how I fixed it was like this:\nI used Boot repair, a tool to fix grub\nBoot into the LiveCD and use the following commands\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install boot-repair\n\nand launch Boot repair, choosing the right options from the GUI\n\nA: check the below link\nRecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows\n", "Q: What is the command to update time and date from internet What is the command to update time and date from Internet? Is there any application that allows me to do so from its user interface rather than from the shell?\n\nA: Most here won't work, since ntp will override your settings within seconds. \nYou need to disable NTP first. On ubuntu it is done as: \n    # Disable ntp\n    sudo timedatectl set-ntp 0\n\nThen you can do:\n    # Set software clock \n    sudo date --set=\"2018-04-01 22:22:22\"\n    # Sync with hardware clock \n    sudo hwclock --systohc\n\n\nA: I had this issue because I would pause a VM for a while and when I resume, Ubuntu 20.04 would refuse to update any packages until the time was corrected. (i.e. packages were not from the 'future').\nThe easiest way (by terminal) was to run this command:\nsudo systemctl restart systemd-timesyncd\n\nTested on Ubuntu's main GNOME edition 20.04.\nNo need for a separate command to restart NTP. Updates the reported time in GNOME as well.\nYou can add this to your bash files:\nsynctime() {\n  sudo systemctl restart systemd-timesyncd\n}\n\nand run the command after reloading your bash files (or opening a new terminal).\nsynctime\n\n\nA: dateFromServer=$(curl -v --silent https://google.com/ 2>&1 \\\n   | grep Date | sed -e 's/< Date: //'); date +\"%d%m%Y%H%M%S\" -d \"$dateFromServer\"\n\nor \ndate -s `curl -I 'https://startpage.com/' 2>/dev/null | grep -i '^date:' | sed 's/^[Dd]ate: //g'`\n\n\nA: Running this command in a terminal should do the trick\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata\n\nYou can add extra time zones graphically, I think, by clicking on the clock and going through its options.\n\nA: This is a nice little code I found to update your time in case you have issues with ntp:\nsudo date -s \"$(wget -qSO- --max-redirect=0 google.com 2>&1 | grep Date: | cut -d' ' -f5-8)Z\"\n\n\nA: You can do so with e.g. sudo ntpdate time.nist.gov. Other servers include time.windows.com, etc.\nhttp://www.pool.ntp.org/ lists time servers around the world.\n\nA: It's very easy to set up from command line: https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/NTP.html From that link:\n\nUbuntu comes with ntpdate as standard, and will run it once at boot time to set up your time according to Ubuntu's NTP server: ntpdate -s ntp.ubuntu.com\n\nHere's GUI example https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuTime#Time_Synchronization_using_NTP\n\nA: As of 2018 with a fresh installed Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, running sudo ntpdate time.nist.gov gives:\nsudo: ntpdate: command not found\n\nThis is because (official source):\n\nntpdate is considered deprecated in favour of timedatectl and thereby\nno more installed by default.\n\nInstead do this to force the sync to happen now:\nsudo timedatectl set-ntp off\nsudo timedatectl set-ntp on\n\nIn my case I was running a Ubuntu on a virtualbox and had saved the machine state so when I started the instance back up again it did not automatically sync the clock since there was no boot event to trigger the sync.  So the time was still showing what it was the last time I was running the virtual box.\n\nA: \nIs there any application that allows me to do so from its user interface rather than from the shell?\n\nI'm using 17.10 and can go to Settings (from the upper-right menu in the UI) > Details > Date & Time.  In my case, my system wasn't updating from the Internet even though \"Automatic Date & Time\" was set to \"ON\".  I simply changed it to \"OFF\", waited a second, then changed it back to \"ON\".  It picked up the current date and time and I was good to go.\n\nA: You need to install the ntp package. Date/Time settings are availble under system settings. Here's some more information.\n\nA: Thanks to Twiglets [For AsusWRT/Merlin Routers]\nHere is an alternative that DOES set the date !!! [-s option].\nPrints out 'Date' it retrieves & the 'Date' that is set for comparison.\nOn AsusWRT / Merlin, the only thing that is odd is that the date retrieved is \"....

I'm setting up 2 servers at a small school. Wondering if I should use the latest version (always my instinct) or go with 10.04LTS.\n1. FILE SERVER:\nMain file server Single Sign On with LDAP and NFS probably Kerberos. Migrating users and their home dirs from a CentOS (release 5-4el5) NIS + NFS system. I might try to squeeze some life out of some aging pentium3s by running them as thin clients off this machine.\n2. PROXY\nDNS, DHCP, Squid, Dansguardian, CUPS print server.\nAlso one of these has to be nominated to do some Samba sharing for our Xerox Docucentre IV to send scans to, as I can't seem to get it to work with FTP, but that is another story...\nClients are mostly running older Fedora versions, but most are going to be moved to current Ubuntu or Xubuntu, as hardware permits. Laptop users have mixed OSes and phones and iPads are all over the network. Only going for single sign on for desktops at the moment.\nWhat are the pros and cons of choosing the latest OS version over older versions?\n\nA: 10.04 will be supported until April 2015. 11.10 will only be supported until April 2013. 10.04 has been in use for a longer period of time, which means it'll likely be more solid and secure. Using the newest versions is not always a good idea. In fact, I would recommend using the oldest supported software possible for services like that. \n\nA: It's quite simple in my eyes:\n\n\n*\n\n*LTS - proven, known stable, no nasty surprises waiting for you, but you have slightly older packages.\n\n*Latest - take your chances with stability (though Ubuntu is normally quite good), at the benefit of newer packages.\n\n\nWhich should you use? I would lay down your feature requirements and see if the packages in LTS can provide you with it. If you need something that's only been added since LTS, then you'll have to look at the latest one, otherwise the choice is easy.\n\nA: Assuming the LTS supports your hardware, I don't see much difference.\n\n\n*\n\n*The server software will be fine in both - it's quite mature.\n\n*Both OS will reach end-of-life at around the same time, so you'll\nhave to upgrade to 12.04LTS anyway.\n\n\nIt might be worth considering whether you or your users will see much of the desktop of this machine (VNC/NX)? If so, I'd say go with 11.10 because then the upgrade to 12.04 will be less of a paradigm shift.\nBasically, for now, take your pick, then upgrade to 12.04LTS and stick with it - you don't want to update a shared server every 6 months (too much risk of disruption).\n", "Q: \"Never hide\" Unity launcher via CCSM & gconf doesn't work All:\nI am running Unity 3D and I want to set my launcher to never hide.

The developers who have made an attempt to fix this appear to get frustrated and quit. This appears to be most common in wireless or optical mice produced by Microsoft. That might have something to do with their choice to ignore a bug that end-users have been reporting for a decade. There is no setting for scroll speed in either Gnome or KDE.

If all goes well, there are no hardware issues, and my favorite apps seem to be working, how do I switch to a one-sided installation? If I can't, how do I do a side-by-side installation the next time?\n(And, am I crazy to consider using a pre-release version to do a side-by-side installation?)\n\nA: Can I suggest another approach?  Keep the dual boot and share all your files with both systems. \nWhy? Because in 6 months you will have the same problem with 12.04 and 12.10.\nExample 1\nAn example of what I want to suggest...\n\n\n*\n\n*OS1 (11.10): /, swap, /home. Total can be as low as 25 Gb.\n\n*OS2 (12.04): /, swap and /home. Total can be as low as 25 Gb.\n\n*OS1+OS2: data partition.\n\n\n(25Gb: 10 for root, 5 for swap, 10 for home: it works because I symlink the directories in home to the data partition. That way I can have the same icons on my desktop for both systems but also when I reformat 1 of the 2 and reinstall another Ubuntu).\nExample 2\nA slightly different example if you're trying to save HDD space...\n\n\n*\n\n*OS1 (11.10): /, swap, /home. Total can be as low as 25 Gb.\n\n*OS2 (12.04): /, swap. Total can be as low as 15 Gb.\n\n*OS1+OS2: data partition.\n\n\nHere you can mount the /home into OS2 (so just mounting not formatting when you setup your system) and use a different username for both OSes. That way you will not run into any conflicts and you can save a 10 Gb of every other OS you include (you can do this with more than 2 OSes and even SUSE, Redhat, CentOS etc ;) )\nI am a big supporter of symlinking.\nExample... say your data partition is named 'discworld'. Create all dirs that are now in /home/{user} in that partition...\n/discworld/Desktop/\n/discworld/Downloads/\n...\n\nrm all directories inside `/home/{user}' and then symlink them:\n`ln -s /discworld/Desktop Desktop`\n`ln -s /discworld/Downloads Downloads`\n...\n\nPut all users into 1 group and set discworld to that group: that way you have 1 desktop over the whole systems, all downloads go to 1 location etc etc. \nUsing the data partition\nEither way, ALL interesting files you have go to the data partition. Use the current system (11.10) and keep updating the newest system (12.04). When the newest system (12.04) is up to your standard use that as the current system and use OS1 to install the newer newest release (ie. 12.10).\nThat way you can always fallback to your last stable Ubuntu.\n\nA: The easyest way to go from a dual-boot to a one boot configuration is to install everything again, formating your partition. \nThinking on the reverse process for installing ubuntu, the other way would involve configuring grub and working with gparted.\nWhen you install another OS, in this case Ubuntu 12.04, side-by-side with ubuntu 11.10, your disk will be partitioned in order to make the two OS work indepently. So when you boot your computer grub will prompt you with the possible options.\nIf you choose 11.10, you will run only 11.10, if you choose 12.04 you will boot only 12.04 (Some BIOS on some computer have limitation on how many partitions it can handle, normally 4 is the top, so you are limited to have this number of OS in the same HD.)\nSo after you perform your tests and get the conclusion what do you want to run as standard, you could open gparted and delete partitions you do not want and put the space back to your old partition or make the configuration you need. \nWorking with partitions is not that hard, but can be confusing and lead you to make mistakes that will make you loose everything, read a lot about it and plan your moves before you make them.\nThe second tasks is to change the grub configuration, this is easy and you can find all over the web how to manipulate, change and configure your grub, you will basically change a conf file and update grub. if you dont change it your grub screen will show the OS removed, but if you try it will give you an error.\nIf your intetntion is to be able to test and verify new verswions of Ubuntu and other OS, you could work with different HDs where you can make each HD an exclusive OS, if you have a computer that can startup from external HD, then it will be easyer then having to make lots of configurations and changes to go back where you were before your testing.\n\nA: It may be more headache than you want, but LVM was built for situations like this.  Where you want to add or remove size to or from a partition whenever you like.  It's not a super-easy gui procedure though, and can occasionally get buggy.  \nIf volume groups, logical volume resizing, and command line aren't your cup of tea, this might not be the best idea.\n", "Q: How to create/extract the EDID for/from a Monitor Is it possible to create or extract the Extended Display Identification Data (EDID) for/from a monitor. I have some issues with my monitor with the VGA and HDMI cables and I would like to test if by adding the EDID to the Nvidia Settings it could help in solve this issues.\nWith the VGA cable I get a black out error and with the HDMI I get some EDID errors (bad EDID). So how can I create the EDID or extract it from the monitor by detecting its capabilities.\n\nA: Got it. Was wrongly searching in the apt search box for ESID instead of EDID. Found the read-edid app which comes with 2 programs, get-edid which is the one I need to extract the data from the Monitor and then parse-edid which reads the binary output from get-edid (In the same pipeline) and parses it in a human readable format. After this I can include it in the Nvidia Settings and test out the outcome but at least I can extract the EDID from the Monitor.\nThe how to use it is also here: http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/oneiric/man1/get-edid.1.html\nbut basically is what I just did:\nget-edid > filename  then parse-edid < filename or just do get-edid | parse-edid\nAlso the nvidia-settings includes a \"Adquire EDID\" button that saves into binary or text format.\nI will leave this here although this question might not come out a lot, it will help anybody that is looking for something related to extracting the EDID.\n", "Q: Battery life is getting shorter and it longer to charge Just installed Ubuntu on my laptop.

But never mind the root info, the problem would be the same unrooted.\nThe photos from this phone is stored in \"sdcard/images\", nevertheless the phone also creates a \"sdcard/DCIM\" but only stores some thumbnails there.\nProblem nr 1: U1 only reads the DCIM-folder for automatic photo-upload. So photos stored in this phone is not uploaded.\nIf I move photos to \"DCIM\" folder, U1 recognises the photos and start uploading them.\nPossible solution: Could there be an option in the settings, to set preferred photo folder?\nProblem nr 2: Out of 74 pictures, 12 did not get uploaded. Pressing \"Retry failed transfers\" in Settings does nothing. Pressing the files where status is \"Upload failed, tap to retry\" only changes the status to \"Uploading...\" but nothing gets uploaded.\nIf I upload another file to U1, it is uploaded directly without any problem.\nIt has nothing to do with file size, 1,1 MB files has been uploaded fine whilst some failed are 0,8 MB.\nProblem nr 3: The photos from DCIM are in my case uploaded to a folder called \"Pictures - GT-I5700\" in U1. If I log in to the homepage and from there upload another photo in \"Pictures - GT-I5700\", it shows up in U1 on my phone fine. But when I tap it, U1 downloads the photo to \"sdcard/U1/Pictures - GT-I5700\". If it sync photos from \"sdcard/DCIM\" to a specific folder, why not also download files to the same folder from which it is synced?\nAfter a while of usage, syncing and uploading files from different clients it would be a mishmash of folders and places files are stored and considering that I see no use of U1 at all.\nAnother question: If my SD card in some way breaks down/some folders cannot be read/card temporarly changed and U1 is running, does U1 consider that as files deleted and also delete from the cloud?\n\nA: Ad.1 We started with the substandard location of pictures, which is /mnt/sdcard (or whatever Android returns with getExternalStorageDirectory() method)  + /DCIM, so:\n/mnt/sdcard/DCIM\nRecently there have appeared vendors that provide custom mount points, such as /mnt/sdcard/ext or /mnt/sdcard/external_sd which have nothing to do with sdcard itself. We are aware of that (that's why we have allowed to cache music from Ubuntu One Music in such alternative location) and we will add support for custom photo directory. Possibly, for multiple custom directories.\nAd.2 You may want to enable U1F > Menu > Settings > Report problem > Collect logs, tap that problematic file, go back to the Report problem screen and send your logs. It'll help us understand what is the reason for that particular behaviour/bug.\nAd.3 If you upload a file from your device, and open it from Ubuntu One Files, it will open the picture from your device, instead of downloading it from the cloud (since it has been uploaded from that device, right?). If you delete the picture from your gallery/sdcard/however you want, if you try to open that picture from U1F, it'll then download the file. You are right - the location of all files downloaded with U1F is set to /mnt/sdcard/u1, and it was not an easy decision to make. We did not want to clutter user's storage, but at the same time we wanted to provide an easily accessible location. As far as downloading pictures to that location instead of /mnt/sdcard/DCIM - Ubuntu One Files, apart from auto-upload of photos, does not provide sync capabilities. We want to be very clear about that. Thus, we do not operate on the locations of files you upload, we stick to one location (/mnt/sdcard/u1) to manage your files from U1 cloud. However -- once we provide sync capabilities, we will make new decisions on how to approach these type of matters. Most probably, you'll be able to map custom device location to custom cloud location. Currently, this is not supported.\nAd.4 No, because Ubuntu One Files does not (yet) do sync. And if it did, I guarantee we will do our best to detect such edge cases, as well as disable populating file deletions to the cloud as an application setting for your convenience.\nI hope this answers your questions. Do let us know about Ad.2 (you can send the logs like I have described above).

I am running 11.10 and all updates are current.\nI first saw the symptom with a custom version of the \"Home\" nautilus-home.desktop file I created in ~/.local.share/applications.  I added a few static shortcuts to specific folders. What I found was, clikcing the icon once would open up my home folder, but after closing that nautilus window, clicking the icon again did nothing (did not even show icon backlight animation). However, I could right click on the same icon and access my short cuts as many times as I want.  Symptom persisted until restarting lightdm.  Just yesterday I saw the same sort of symptom happen with a custom launcher I created for a chromium-borwser to open a specific URL (with a few short cuts to other URLs). Click the icon - it works once. Then never again. Right click the icon and I can use the short cuts over and over - no problem.\nNote - at one point I assumed I might have a problem with my custom .desktop file, so I did a test by removing my custom nautilus-home.desktop.  However, even after restarting lightdm, and verifying the home icon was the standard one from /opt/share/applications (all my custom shortcuts were gone) I saw the same symptom re-appear - it runs once and then not again until restarting lightdm.\nIt seems to be intermittent and seems to move between various launchers.

I checked the lineup of active processes before and after triggering the symptom - low and behold I see compiz in sleep state after triggering the problem.  I wondered if any of my settings might be messing with things so I did a \"unity -reset\".  No more symptoms! So, one by one, I went back to the ccsm tool restoring my old settings. It seems that the symptoms return when I set the Backlight mode (experimental tab) to \"Backlight and Edge Illumination Toggles\".  Symptoms go away with either Backlgiht toggles or Edge Illumination Toggles, but both together seems to trigger my symptoms. So at this point, the problem is not solved, but I know how to avoid it.  It does bother me that I can not reporduce this on my other computer though.  I still think it is worth filing a bug report ... I'll figure out how to do that tonight.\n\nA: I had a problem like this on 11.10.

I am installing Ubuntu first. Partitioning 15 MB for Boot partition, and the rest of my space divided by 2 for each Ubuntu and Fedora (500 GB each). I set the Fedora partition not to be used by Ubuntu. I am not using Swap partition. After the installation, do I have to manually configure grub? Or will the Fedora installer do the job for me?\n\nA: Personally, I would install Fedora first because its installation is much more difficult than Ubuntu's installation. Ubuntu will also set everything for you. You do not need to create a separate partition as a boot partition. Just install fedora and when you install Ubuntu choose the \"install alongside fedora (or other linux distribution)\" and Ubuntu will do the rest.\n\nA: It doesn't matter which linux you install first.\nThe one you install second will be the grub that is actually used. Whenever update-grub is ran, grub will be reinstalled.\nIn ubuntu this is done whenever there is a kernel upgrade and fedora is likely the same.\nTherefore, by default, you'll be switching back and forth between grub installs as each distro is updated (assuming you using each quite often)\nAs both use autoconfiguration, it's not big of a deal and will only be a minor annoyance.\nPlease see my question to see my conclusions on this topic.\nHow to dual boot two different Linux distributions?\n\nA: 15MB for a boot partition?

I haven't installed Fedora in a while, but I think you'll be prompted a choice, or you can do it manually, that shouldn't be hard.\n", "Q: Installation \"Sticks\" on Acer Aspire One ZG5 Sorry if I'm doing this all wrong; I am barely computer literate, stumbling through this rather ungracefully...\nI have an Acer Aspire One which I threw in my closet a few months back when I got a new laptop (birthday + spotty netbook internet connection + generous mom). Unfortunately, I need it to work again, and when I opened it, it would not boot, saying simply \"Error 17.\" Somebody suggested that I put ubuntu on it and see if it worked. Never done anything like that before.\nI went to the Ubuntu site and followed directions for putting the files on a flash drive. Seemed to work initially: got a preliminary screen with the ubuntu logo asking what I wanted to do (run ubuntu on the computer, burn to hard drive, etc.). However, after I chose (I tried both of the first two), I got a long, rapidly moving list of commands or something (?) in which the words \"device error,\" \"logic block\" and \"killing\" come up a lot (I can be more specific). After a minute or two, a purple screen with blinking white/red dots and the ubuntu logo on it comes up... and stays there. Nothing else happens.\nI tried first with a flash drive, then a different flash drive, then a CD (which didn't boot up anything at all and simply caused \"Error 17\" - may not have worked because the external CD drive doesn't \"like\" my netbook). I tried first the 11.10 version, then the 10.04 version. All the same problem. No idea if I can fix this.\nAny help?\n\nA: This sort of problem is most often caused by bad installation media.\nDid you MD5 test the .iso image before you wrote it to the USB flash drive? If not, please do that now. If that doesn't check out, you'll have to redownload the .iso image, MD5 test the new image, and (assuming the new one checks out) write it to the USB flash drive again.\nDid you verify that the live USB was written correctly and is readable by the machine on which you're installing? To do that, boot from it, and immediately when you see the person and keyboard icons at the bottom center of the screen, press Spacebar, select your language, and select \"Check disc for defects\". (This goes for USB flash drives as well as CD's and DVD's.) If that doesn't check out, you'll have to re-write the .iso image to the USB flash drive (and run this test on it again).\n(If both of those things check out, then your installation medium is probably fine after all. In that case, please edit your question to include the information that Jorge Castro requested in his comment. If you cannot take and post a picture, then you can instead write down--or type in, if you have a second computer--the full and exact text of the error messages, and edit your question to include that.)\n", "Q: Can I play movies without X launched? I know that I dont need a GUI for browsing Internet (using Links) but what about doing other things like playing movies, music and pictures slide shows. Is it possible to do that in a text mode command line?\n\nA: *\n\n*For playing movies have a look at MPlayer with video output devices cvidix oder directfb, see the MPlayer documentation\n\n*For music cmus or ncmpc should work\n\n*For pictures there's fbi\n\n\nYou need to bee a member of the video group to use graphics at the text console.\n\nA: Sure.\naview image.jpeg\nmplayer -vo aa:bold:dim:driver=slang: movie.mpeg\n\nBoth incantations use an ASCII art library. The aview program is in the aview  package. There's also cacaview from the caca-utils package, and its associated driver for mplayer:\ncacaview image.jpeg\nmplayer -vo caca movie.mpeg\n\nOf course, the picture quality is lousy. Aa has lots of parameters, but it's only with caca that I could almost make something out.\nFor real pictures, look for a player or viewer that advertises SVGAlib or FBdev support. This includes several mplayer drivers.\nThere's not much to gain by not starting X. If you're going to use graphics, you might as well start X.\nSound does not require X anyway.\n", "Q: How to tag a compilation album contains multiple artists on each track?

Scenario:\nI use the same notebook at work and at home:\n\n\n*\n\n*At work I have 13 NFS mappings split over two different IPs.\n\n*At home I have one mapping on a third IP.\n\n\nProblem:\nWhen I get home and turn on the notebook, it takes a long time to boot due to the missing IPs present on my fstab.\nSolution:\nMaybe there is a way to add conditional blocks on fstab or perhaps use different fstab files depending on the network I am connected to.\nIs that possible or is there an alternate solution?\n\nA: IMO the best solution is autofs.\nThe syntax of autofs takes a few minutes to comprehend, but once you understand the syntax it is very very easy and very much automated.\nThe advantage is that your shares are mounted, automatically, seamlessly, but only as needed. So no more slow boots, yet the shares are easily available.\n\nautofs is a program for automatically mounting directories on an as-needed basis. Auto-mounts are mounted only as they are accessed, and are unmounted after a period of inactivity. Because of this, automounting NFS/Samba shares conserves bandwidth and offers better overall performance compared to static mounts via fstab. \n\nInstall autofs\nsudo apt-get install autofs\n\nYou then remove the mounts from /etc/fstab and add them to /etc/auto.master\nThe syntax is\n\nmount-point [map-type[,format]:] map [options]\n\nFor example:\nmount-point   -fstype=nfs4   server:/share\n\nYou can mount all the shares on a particular server, for example\n/media/work-server   /etc/auto.work-server\n\nwill mount all the shares on your work server, in the directory /media/work-server as configured in /etc/auto.work-server\nIf you have a problem, paste bin your configuration file(s) and we can review them.\nSee : https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Autofs\n", "Q: Accessing home directory hangs Occasionally my laptop will hang when trying to access my home directory.

I bought a book (Beginner's Guide) but it is for 10.04.  Should I download 10.04 so it matches the book or use 11.10 with the book, assuming they are pretty similar?\n\nA: Many things are similar in 11.10 from 10.04, but under the hood, there are major changes -- the far biggest changes in Ubuntus history, actually. This means that things aren't as rock solid as it usually is. It also means that a lot of users are a little confused at the moment. For instance, the configuration system has been changed, so many people think all the old options are gone, when in reality they've just been moved. The main desktop interface itself has also changed radically, and a minority of users have learned how to use it properly yet. The one in 10.04 has been used for ten years, so those of us who have used Ubuntu and GNU/Linux for a long time, know it by heart, meaning that it might be easier to get proper support. \nI recommend that all new users stick to LTS-versions like 10.04. They tend to be more conservative than those in between, and that means they're usually more stable from the beginning. Since they're alive for longer periods of time, with bug fixes, etc, they also become very polished. One thing you don't need when you're in the process of learning, is exceptions to the general rules. Bugs that can be annoying to experienced users, can be highly confusing to beginners. \nYou can upgrade Ubuntu from LTS to LTS, and since the next LTS is in April, I would recommend that you get 10.04, get familiar with it and upgrade when 12.04LTS is released. 11.10 is a very good operating system when all works as expected, but there are still many exceptions that will be addressed during the next five months leading up to 12.04. \nThen again, installing Ubuntu takes about 15-20 minutes on a modern computer, so you might want to try both. :)\n\nA: Have been following this question and some comments as well. I agree on several counts. Here is a quick list of things that have changed from 10.04 to 11.10. This is not an exhaustive list and you will see some repeats that have come in the above comments.\n1) Interface - \nWhile it is just the beginning, imagine it to be the door of a house. Before you enter the house, the only thing you see is the door. The door to Ubuntu and it's features has changed. Earlier it was the conventional Gnome interface which you can see on many other Linux distributions, but Ubuntu has taken a bold step forward to change the interface to Unity. So that is a big change from navigation perspective.\nThe biggest change that has happened because of the interface is that in 10.04, you could use your mouse to move through various menus and then one click to open an application, so less use of keyboard....now in 11.10, the interface is search oriented. so one has to search for an application by typing some key words in the Dash or search area and then once the right application is found, you can create a short cut or drag it on the unity launcher. So a little painful for the new installation. Once you have created the shortcuts, the new interface is a breeze.\nPersonally, I love the Unity interface. It makes usage more exciting and quick. It takes a little while to hook onto it, but once you have spent some time on the interface and learnt the new way of doing things, I think you are all set. \nThe default icon size in Unity bar is a big turn off actually. One needs to install compiz manager to reduce the icon size. Once the size of the icon changes- it needs a restart, it is a great tool. I have a 23 inches monitor and it really looks great.\n2) Productivity Applications\n\n\n*\n\n*Office Applications - Word, powerpoint, excel, access, publisher\n\n\nOpen office has been replaced by Libre Office. Not a major change, because Libre office is just a fork of Open Office. May be after a year or two, because of the different development efforts, there is a likelihood of change in the features & look & feel. Other than that there is no major change. So all your Microsoft office 20xx documents will continue to be compatible with both softwares\n\n\n*\n\n*Mail Client\n\n\nUbuntu has moved from Evolution to Thunderbird. While I am not a supporter for either of the email clients, my inclination would be to use Evolution only because I can sync my address book and calendar with sync-ml utility with my work email server effortlessly. My workplace uses Rackspace as a hosted email service provider and they provide IMAP and sync-ml capabilities for syncing my address book and calendar with web-mail and evolution using the sync utility in Ubuntu. So evolution works for me. Evolution also syncs with Everdroid perfectly and lets me sync my android device with evolution. but Thunderbird is an equally strong client. But your book which you have got for 10.04, may have illustrations for using Evolution which you may not find as a default mail application. Thunderbird does not have a default calendar that integrates with the Memenu. One needs to install the ad-don. \nEvolution is also available in the repositories of Ubuntu, which you can install through the software center.\n\n\n*\n\n*Multi protocol chatting software\n\n\nEmpathy is the default chat software which comes in both 10.04 and 11.10 versions of Ubuntu. It is a very powerful tool and I have seen it maturing over the last few months. It has it's own issues with video and audio chatting capabilities, but I somehow find, the 11.10 version has a sturdy empathy installation. I havebeen using empathy for connecting Yahoo, hotmil, gmail, jabber (office uses Openfire as a corporate chatting system) and recently I have experimented with VOIP (using PIAF VOIP server). Empathy works really well.\nIn a VOIP setup, I could do a video call using empathy with a SIP phone having video capabilities. We use PIAF as our IP PBX.\n3) Entertainment Applications\n\n\n*\n\n*Audio player\n\n\nBanshee is the default audio player in 11.10 and the book you have may have some information on the default audio player in 10.04 which was Rhythmbox. Both are quite good for an average user, but Banshee is a shade better when it comes to syncing your multi media devices. Be it Android or ipod, Banshee detects and works well, seamlessly with many popular media devices.\n\n\n*\n\n*Photo Editing Tool\n\n\nI am not too sure, but I think 10.04 comes with F-Spot as default photo management tool. In 11.10, Shotwell comes in as a default. Gimp which is one of the strongest photo management tool in Open source community, was dropped from 10.04 version of Ubuntu. Personally I feel, for an average desktop user shotwell or f-spot both serve the purpose. Shotwell detects your phone or camera to download the images directly on the local machine and also arranges your pictures or videos based on date.\n4) Miscellaneous\nThere are lot of changes when it comes to configuring or tweaking your system for day to day use. Unless you know exactly where to look for system settings and tweaks, 10.04 guide would be useless for tweaking or managing personal configurations. E.g\n - Changing fonts: In 10.04 it was simple to change a font. In 11.04, one has to install a utility called as gnome-tweak tool or advanced setting tool to change the system fonts\n - Icons: In 10.04 one could change fonts, icons, wall papers, screen saver , all at one location. Now these settings are to be done at different places in 11.10\nI think overall, there have been several changes in 11.10 since 10.04. While 10.04 is a LTS version, we are just a few months away from the next LTS version of Ubuntu scheduled to be released in April 2012. I would suggest two phase approach for you.\n\n\n*\n\n*Get the hang of things using Ubuntu 10.04 and using the book. Explore and understand how Ubuntu works, what are the different applications, how to navigate through Ubuntu, how to find things in Ubuntu. Use Ubuntu as a default operating system.\n\n*Migrate to 11.10 in a month\nOnce you have the handle on Ubuntu 10.04, you can move to Ubuntu 11.10. The transition would be a little simpler. It could be a little painful because of the Unity launcher, but once you know how Ubuntu works, what applications to look for, you will be all set. The new LTS version 12.04 will be released in April 2012, which will be an improved version of 11.10. Moving to 12.04 would then be absolutely painless.\nHope this long post helps.\nKedar\n\nA: The key difference between 11.04/11.10 and 10.04 is the default interface called Unity.\n\n picture from this AskUbuntu question\nThis compares to the Gnome-2-Panel interface used by 10.04\n\nSome of the terminology changes between the two due to the incorporation of elements from Gnome-Shell & Unity compared to the standard Gnome-2-panel interface.\nThus - as a beginner, can I suggest you use 10.04 until you feel more comfortable before progressing to later versions of ubuntu.  However saying that - if you are feeling adventurous - jump straight into 11.10.  If you have any issues, come back here or the ubuntu-forums.  You'll find us a friendly lot offering lots of advice.\nAs an alternative/or addition to your book, can I suggest the second edition of the Ubuntu Manual Project book - written by many contributors specifically from the new users point-of-view.\n\nA: The newest version is pretty slick. And any thing new shouldn't cause you any problems figuring out how to navigate the OS. Researching a specific issue over the interwebs is a good practice - someone will likely have the same issue as you.\n\nA: Graphics Card 2D or 3D\nStay with 10.04 with 2D\nTry 12.04 or 11.10 with 3D\nPersonally I like 10.04-only 2D\nbut it works for me\nThunderbird was buggy for me 12.04\nEvolution has been the 1st choice 10.04\nSylpheed 2nd but very close to 1st(an option)\nnewer isn't always better-just supported with updates\n", "Q: Why is playing music crashing my system? Complete n00b here. I'm pretty sure playing music is crashing it (crashing: no response from keyboard/mouse - must cut power to restart) because it does not do it when a music player isn't running. I thought it was a banshee specif issue but Clementine does the same. \nI've been reading about \"disabling pulseaudio\" but I'm hesitant because no one has spelled it out as being the issue.\n\nA: I would strongly advise against disabling pulseaudio. \nI'm not sure what a solution for this could be without a little bit more to go on, but I myself tried a variety of \"disable pulseaudio\" fixes that caused me quite a few system issues. For me, the problem was fixed by tweaking my settings in \"Sound\" (accessible by typing in Sound via the Unity Launcher). Try going to the Hardware tab and testing your speakers, and selecting a different profile and/or tweaking settings before fooling around with pulseaudio in the terminal.\n", "Q: Realtek RTL8168/8111E onboard NIC not recognized - the everlasting problem? I used the newest vendor driver for my onboard NIC (board: ASUS M5A97 Pro) and those sites to get it running on kernel 3.0:\nhttp://www.twm-kd.com/linux/realtek-rtl81688111e-and-ubuntu-linux/\nThe problem now is, that this doesn't work with either kernel 3.1 or 3.2:\nhttps://code.google.com/p/r8168/issues/detail?id=6\nMy question is: does anyone have a solution to get it run on the newest kernel? Or is this a plaque I have to carry forever?\n\nA: You could rephrase this whole question as:\nIf I run bleeding-edge software, will I be fine?\nThe obvious answer is no; you'll probably run into issues all the time. And that's what has happened here. Realtek (et al) and the community don't track the latest versions of everything and even when they do, they're not as fast as people who can run the latest kernel on the day of its release.\nIf you want better support, stick to a platform that people are using. Just because 3.1 is stable doesn't mean lots of people are using it.\nIn short: you don't have to carry the plaque but you will have to trade it in for the more-supported 3.0 kernel. You can't have your cake and eat it, I'm afraid.\nIf you want to try to minimise your pain, get in contact with Realtek now. I've no idea if they have a public bug tracking system that you can write to, but at the very least contact their support to make sure somebody there knows about the problem. It's not going to fix things overnight, but it might get you up and running within a month.\n\nA: The newest version 8.0.26 of the Realtek driver plus some adjustment which can be found on the sites linked above, the nic works on the newest stable kernel 3.1.2. On 3.2, however, it still doesn't work, but hopefully Realtek will update the driver for newer kernel versions.\nBut there will be a problem when you install a new distribution, since Ubuntu checks for updates on install for which you need a working nic. ;-)\n", "Q: How to print in Black and White for Canon Printers I am using a Canon MP280 printer, which I found a driver from canon on the european site for. The print dialogue does not allow me to print in black and white unfortunately. Does anyone know of a way for me to force this? I'm guessing it is just a fault with my printer driver, but I feel like greyscale printing should be something in the OS sending the job, not in the printer drivers part.\n\nA: If you print to PDF first, you might have the option in there. If you don't (I don't for some reason), you can use imagemagick to convert a PDF from colour to greyscale in one command:\nconvert -density 600 -colorspace gray output.pdf output_greyscale.pdf\n\nThe -density 600 value is just there to preserve some quality as it rasterises text.\n\nA: To permanently change printing mode to \"black only\" do this:\nOn an internet browser go this webserver:\nhttp://localhost:631\nThen go to Printers (top right of the screen). On \"queue name\" click on the printer. Go to 'Administration' and select 'Modify Printer'. Choose the first 'usb' option and click continue. Next screen continue again. On the next screen select this printer in Model:\nCanon PIXMA MP280 - CUPS+Gutenprint v5.2.9\nAnd then for last click on 'Modify Printer'.\nExit the browser and change your printer settings.\nOn Lubuntu 13.04 Start Menu -> System tools -> Printers Choose properties on the MP280.\nIn the Printer Options screen. Choose: Color Mode: Greyscale Ink type: Black Ink set: Black\nClick Apply and then OK.\nFinally DONE!\n\nA: As outlined in this blogpost. I tested this on Canon MP280 using Ubuntu 12.04.\n\n\n*\n\n*Click System â> Administration â> Printing.\n\n*Now right click on your printer and select Properties.\n\n*Now select Job Options\n\n*Now scroll down to the bottom.\n\n*At the bottom you will see a text box . In that text box add CNGrayscale and click on Add button .\n\n*Once you click add there will appear another text box right above the first text box . So in the second text box add \"TRUEâ and click on apply.\nThats all , now your printer will print in Grayscale mode . In case you want to print in color mode just change the TRUE to FALSE .\nEDIT, \nIn the 12.04.1 precise, these options are difficult to find.\nYou have to run the application \"system-config-printer\" in terminal or Alt-F2. Then you will always print in grayscale. No options are available in the menu.  I am using mp280series_3.4-1. To print in colour you will have to run system-config-printer again. \n\nA: If you want print grayscale in Ubuntu, and your printer is a Canon, the\n.ppd from Canon does not support the average black-white print. \nYou can search for edited .ppd files in Google that match and support black and white printing with your printer model. Replace your last .ppd and put the new .ppd  in /usr/share/ppd.\nEdit printer configuration (ubuntu 12.04)  \nSelect dash -> printing -> chose your printer-> properties -> make and model -> provide .ppd -> choose the .ppd file that you downloaded and then change your .ppd\nAnd then add CNGrayscale as above.\nI hope that help.\n\nA: I just solved this same problem talking to a Cannon tech rep over the phone.\nIf your problem is that you ran out of ink on any of the other cartridges, but the black ones, all you have to do to force print is to hold the \"stop\" button for about 5 seconds.\nAn up date screen will come up, after it's done, you can print.\nIf the error screen comes up again indicating that another cartridge is out of ink also, just repeat the same process.\nNote: The tech guy warned me not to try to force print in color using this method, if you actually are out of ink on the color cartridges, as this will make the printer to force work, get over heated and permanently damage the unit.\n\nA: In this post I am going to explain about how to enable Grayscale Printing in Canon Pixma MP250 series printer. You can refer to my tutorial here in case you want to install the printer and scanner on Ubuntu and any other Linux distro.\nTo enable the Grayscale printing just follow the following steps.\n\n\n*\n\n*Click System â> Administration â> Printing.\n\n*Now right click on your printer and select properties.\n\n*Now select Job Options\n\n*Now scroll down to the bottom.\n\n*At the bottom you will see a text box. In that text box add âCNGrayscaleâ (without qoutes) and click on Add button.\n\n*Once you click add there will appear another text box right above the first text box. So in the second text box add âTRUEâ and click on apply.\n\n\nThats all, now your printer will print in Grayscale mode.

I was wondering why upgrade sometimes doesn't want to upgrade certain parts of the system, while dist-upgrade does. Here's an example after running apt-get upgrade:\napt-get upgrade:\nrimmer@rimmer-Lenovo-IdeaPad-S10-2:~$ sudo apt-get upgrade\nReading package lists... Done\nBuilding dependency tree       \nReading state information... Done\nThe following packages have been kept back:\n  linux-generic linux-headers-generic linux-image-generic\n0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 3 not upgraded.\n\nversus apt-get dist-upgrade:\nrimmer@rimmer-Lenovo-IdeaPad-S10-2:~$ sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\nReading package lists... Done\nBuilding dependency tree       \nReading state information... Done\nCalculating upgrade... Done\nThe following NEW packages will be installed:\n  linux-headers-3.0.0-13 linux-headers-3.0.0-13-generic\n  linux-image-3.0.0-13-generic\nThe following packages will be upgraded:\n  linux-generic linux-headers-generic linux-image-generic\n3 upgraded, 3 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.\nNeed to get 48.5 MB of archives.\nAfter this operation, 215 MB of additional disk space will be used.\nDo you want to continue [Y/n]?\n\nIn other words, why can't this be performed by upgrade?\n\nA: From apt-get manual:\nupgrade\n   upgrade is used to install the newest versions of all packages\n   currently installed on the system from the sources enumerated in\n   /etc/apt/sources.list. Packages currently installed with new\n   versions available are retrieved and upgraded; under no\n   circumstances are currently installed packages removed, or packages\n   not already installed retrieved and installed. New versions of\n   currently installed packages that cannot be upgraded without\n   changing the install status of another package will be left at\n   their current version. An update must be performed first so that\n   apt-get knows that new versions of packages are available.\n\ndist-upgrade\n   dist-upgrade in addition to performing the function of upgrade,\n   also intelligently handles changing dependencies with new versions\n   of packages; apt-get has a \"smart\" conflict resolution system, and\n   it will attempt to upgrade the most important packages at the\n   expense of less important ones if necessary. So, dist-upgrade\n   command may remove some packages. The /etc/apt/sources.list file\n   contains a list of locations from which to retrieve desired package\n   files. See also apt_preferences(5) for a mechanism for overriding\n   the general settings for individual packages.\n\nAnd with the newer apt tool available from 14.04 onwards:\nfull-upgrade\n   full-upgrade performs the function of upgrade but may also remove\n   installed packages if that is required in order to resolve a\n   package conflict.\n\nIn your particular case, I see, for example, that linux-headers is a virtual package that is provided by both linux-headers-3.0.0-12 and linux-headers-3.0.0-13 and that sounds like the kind of package installation and removal handled by dist-upgrade, but not by upgrade.\n\nA: Basically upgrade will only upgrade existing packages from one version to another.  It will not install or remove packages, even if doing so is required to upgrade others.  In the case of kernel updates, upgrading the linux-generic package requires installing the new linux-3.0.0-13-generic package, and since upgrade refuses to install or remove packages, it refuses to upgrade linux-generic.\nSometimes various incompatibilities between packages will require some packages to be removed in order to upgrade others, and that will also require dist-upgrade.  Kernel updates will always require dist-upgrade because of how they are handled.  Rather than have a kernel package that gets updated, an entirely new kernel package is created each time, and the kernel metapackage is updated to depend on the new kernel package instead of the old.  This was done so that you keep the old kernel versions around so that in case there is a problem with booting the new kernel, you can choose the old one from the boot menu and recover.\n\nA: Your best option is:\napt full-upgrade\n\n-which auto-handles the dependencies when upgrading packages; whereas:\napt upgrade\n\n-does NOT auto-handle dependencies when upgrading packages.\n\nA: apt-get upgrade is restricted to the case where packages are to be replaced by newer versions, but no package needs to be added or removed. A new version of Firefox, for instance, should be installable with apt-get upgrade.\nHowever apt-get upgrade will refuse to work when there are additions or removals required by the updated versions. For example, when you have kernel linux-image-3.2.0-10-generic installed and linux-image-3.2.0-11-generic appears, the linux-image-generic package gets updated to depend on the newer version. In order to install the new kernel, you need to run apt-get dist-upgrade.\nNotice how an apt-get upgrade will say that the kernel packages have been held back. That's the cue for using apt-get dist-upgrade.\n\nA: The apt-get upgrade command will normally only install updates (or fixes) to currently installed packages. Typically a new release of Mozilla Firefox, for instance, would be installed with this command.\nHowever apt-get upgrade will NOT generally install new releases, where major changes (including removal of packages or GRUB update is required). For example, when a new Linux kernel (linux-image-3.x.x-xx-generic, etc.) is available, the package will not get installed.\nIn order to install the new kernel, you will need to run apt-get dist-upgrade. You will be notified when you run apt-get upgrade, as it will say that certain packages have been held back. That's your cue to use: apt-get dist-upgrade.\n\nA: Short answer those who want the exact point\napt-get update\n\n*\n\n*The update command updates the package list with the latest available versions\n\n*It won't upgrade the installed packages just update the package list with a new version\n\n*To upgrade need to run the upgrade command\n\napt-get upgrade\n\n*\n\n*To update the already installed packages to the latest available version\n\n*It will upgrade only the installed packages that already available to the latest version version\n\n*If the dependencies are missed the current version will be kept without any upgrade\n\napt-get dist-upgrade\n\n*\n\n*To update the already installed packages to the latest available version with required dependencies\n\n*It will automatically install the required additional packages and dependencies and also removes the already installed packages to make the clear upgrade\n\napt-get full-upgrade\n\n*\n\n*full-upgrade performs the upgrade function but may also remove installed packages if required to resolve a package conflict.\n\napt-get do-release-upgrade\n\n*\n\n*It can upgrade the release version of ubuntu for example if you want to upgrade ubuntu 18.04 to 20.04 we can run do-release-upgrade\n\n*To use this command, the system must first be fully upgraded.

I've tried sudo apt-get clean and deleting the cached package files from Synaptic Package Manager, emptied trash but that has not changed the amount of free space I have. \n\nIt seems similar to this problem\nBut using the root disk usage analyzer has not given any insight into what is consuming so much space.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Looks like there is a very big file in /home/teddy.

A few weeks ago I encountered a similar issue on a wubi system that was installed by a friend. As it is in your case, the disk analyzer was showing a really high value for home folder, much more than the sum of its sub-folders. I cant comment on why disk analyser was behaving in this way, but the approach I took in my case was to do a clean install of Ubuntu on a dedicated partition. Of course that is not a very good solution, but if this is a relatively new system, it might be a reasonable workaround. \nHopefully someone else can shed some light on why disk analyzer is behaving in this way, and how to make that disk space available.\n\nA: I was baffled by my disksystem all the same, telling me a cp -r /home would not work cause there is no space left (moving 840MB to a \"2.9GB free\" partitition).\nThe meat of the story is: du did not find a subdir \"Ãffentlich\" and did not count the files inside it.\nFor those interested - thats what I found : \ndu told me 840 MB used  (Disk Usage analyzer the same)\ndf told me 5,3 GB used\nI found various tips revolving around\nlsof -n | grab deleted    (to find out wether there are any \"deleted yet open\" files hugging space)\n\nsudo tune2fs -l /dev/sda1 | grep 'Block size'  (to find out the block size 4k in my case)\nfind /home -size -4k | wc -l    (to find out the number of files smaller than 1 block, a 10 bytes file using a 4046 block is wasting lots a space)\n\ndu -sh ./*   (finding the space used (real size) in each subdir)\ndf -i        (finding not the number of used blocks, but the no of used inodes, whats it worth for, I am not sure yet.)\n\nFurther tips found : \nDisk Usage Analyzer is rights-aware - \"sudo baobab\" will show more than \"baobab\"\ndu -c --max-depth=4 /dir | sort -n\nncdu utility found at: http://dev.yorhel.nl/ncdu\n\nThe best tip for me was du -sh.

I've downloaded a lot of torrent files and while I'm seeding them, I've noticed that very often when I start the browser it's slow and the hard disk activity indicator is on. Usually when I start a program it gets cached in RAM and starting it again is very quick, and I have 3 GB of RAM so usually it stays cached nearly forever. But when my torrent client is seeding it seems that after an hour programs that I ran are no longer cached in RAM.\nI was thinking maybe it's because of the disk reads which the torrent client performs are cached and fill up RAM eventually. But I don't think they need to be, as they are read only once and are unlikely to be read again soon.\nSo my questions are - is this the way I think, and if so is it possible in principle to prevent the disk reads from being cached? I can try to edit the source code of the program.\n\nA: It will depend exactly which torrent program you're using. Some of them might behave in different ways.\nBut yes, it is possible to bypass system cache since this is a common problem.\nIf you're comfortable editing source (perhaps this should be on another StackExchange..) find where the torrent program opens the file from disk. Most likely an open() call. If it is fdopen() then it's using stdlib and I'm not sure stdlib supports direct i/o.\nThis system call takes up to three arguments, the first one is the filename, the second are flags, the third is an optional file create mask. The flags will probably be something like O_RDWR at the moment. The flag for \"don't use system cache\" is O_DIRECT, and you combine flags by separating them with |.\nSo the result of the flags argument in this case would be O_RDWR | O_DIRECT. Just add the new flag on.\nFor more information, see\nman 2 open\n\n\nA: Don't close the browser :)\nThe I/O cache (used just for reading, not writing to a file), however excessive, will not cause the pages that the program is using to be swapped out.\n", "Q: Create a snapshot/Backup of my Amazon Ubuntu Instance Hi all I want to backup my amazon instance currently running on ubuntu 10.4 LTS, anyone know how to do that?\nI also have a Cent-OS instance which I bakup and restore by creating snapshots and images where necessary but I have been unable to do this with Ubuntu.\n:(\n\nA: I'll go ahead and assume you mean ec2 only by the tags on your question.\nIf you are using an EBS root image, this is as easy as ec2-create-snapshot. You'll get a block device which you can attach to another machine and copy anywhere. Its important to note that these are in the same availability zone as the instance, so don't rely on the snapshot alone for surviving an availability zone going down.\nIf you are on an ephemeral drive (sometimes called the \"instance storage\"), you will need to do it the old fashioned way, by copying all the data off your instance.

I can still access the drive but as soon as I do that it crashes.\n\nA: Your approach to use ddrescue is a good one. If the problem is caused by defects on platters surface, you should be able to rescue at least the un-damaged areas. Running ddrescue multiple times on the same output file will add new \"rescued\" data to that file - after some time you'll recover the most of what can be recovered. I'm sure you already read general overview and the the manual\nIf ddrescue fails immediately without recovering any data, regardless of which area of the drive you're trying to access, it suggests a failure of electronic components rather than the platters. What I would do in this case:\n\n\n*\n\n*let the drive to rest. I used to have a drive which was starting to produce errors a few minutes after powered up; the longer it rested - the longer it worked. I left it \"in a cool dry place\" for a few months which allowed me to take a full snapshot without any errors - it worked several hours!.\n\n*take the drive out of enclosure and plug it directly via SATA. Just in case.\n\n*if you have another drive of the same model you can try swapping the electronic parts from the healthy drive - this is sorta risky as you can ruin both drives but I heard of people doing this with good results.\nThere are also some forensic methods using million-dollar equipment... but it depends on how valuable the data is.\n\nA: Can't seem to log back in as \"backitup\", witness the noobness.\nI did solve the problem.  ddrescue is now in my mind the single greatest backup and recovery tool the world currently possesses.

It's important that you read about End Of Life Upgrades. What follows is taken from there, but not as complete as that page.\nSince you haven't upgraded in time, you have some extra steps to follow.\nAlways do a backup, I've never tried this procedure myself, so try at your own risk.\nFirst edit /etc/apt/sources.list like this to point the repository to old-releases.

Create the following file:\n## File name /etc/udev/rules.d/70-macchanger.rules\n## Set Mac Address for Network Adapters\nACTION==\"add\", SUBSYSTEM==\"net\", KERNEL==\"wlan*\" RUN+=\"/usr/bin/macchanger -m XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX %k\"\nACTION==\"add\", SUBSYSTEM==\"net\", KERNEL==\"eth*\" RUN+=\"/usr/bin/macchanger -m XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX %k\"\n\nReplace XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX with the Mac Address you want. (Note: some addresses are invalid)\n\nA: Without requiring ifconfig or macchanger:\nsudo ip link set dev [interface_name] down\nsudo ip link set dev [interface_name] address XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX\nsudo ip link set dev [interface_name] up\n\n\nA: In Ubuntu 14.04 many of the solutions proposed were not working for me, and the macchanger one didn't provide many details, so I'm writing here what worked for me (if your wifi network interface is called wlan0), simply:\nsudo apt-get install macchanger\nsudo service network-manager stop\nsudo macchanger -A wlan0\nsudo service network-manager start\n\nUPDATE: In Ubuntu 16.04 my solution above doesn't work anymore, however, the accepted answer works (the accepted answer wasn't working for me in Ubuntu 14.04 back then).\n\nA: You can also change mac address on ubuntu or linux mint via the terminal\nGo to your ubuntu or linux mint terminal, edit /etc/network/interfaces file\n$ sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces\n\nYou should see something like this with dhcp enabled for your network interface. Usually its eth0 for ubuntu or linux mint wired network and wlan0 for ubuntu or linux mint wireless network.\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet dhcp\n\nAt the end of /etc/network/interfaces file, add this line to give your systemâs network interface new MAC address.\nhwaddress ether A4-19-E2-94-DD-BB\n\nSave /etc/network/interfaces file with the new config, then restart your system network.\n$ sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart\n\nor\n$ sudo service networking restart\n\n\nA: You could try macchanger available in the repositories. Install with sudo apt-get install macchanger or through Ubuntu Software center.\n$ macchanger\nGNU MAC Changer\nUsage: macchanger [options] device\n\nTry `macchanger --help' for more options.\ntvbox@tvbox-G31M-ES2L:~$ macchanger --help\nGNU MAC Changer\nUsage: macchanger [options] device\n\n  -h,  --help                   Print this help\n  -V,  --version                Print version and exit\n  -s,  --show                   Print the MAC address and exit\n  -e,  --ending                 Don't change the vendor bytes\n  -a,  --another                Set random vendor MAC of the same kind\n  -A                            Set random vendor MAC of any kind\n  -p,  --permanent              Reset to original, permanent hardware MAC\n  -r,  --random                 Set fully random MAC\n  -l,  --list[=keyword]         Print known vendors\n  -b,  --bia                    Pretend to be a burned-in-address\n  -m,  --mac=XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX\n       --mac XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX  Set the MAC XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX\n\nGranted this a CLI utility.\n", "Q: Does Ubuntu AppDev support applications written on Adobe AIR technology? Does Ubuntu approve an application which is written using Adobe AIR technology? Yes, we know Adobe abandoned support for AIR for Linux. But still we can use Adobe AIR 2.6 and create applications using that.\n\nA: Looking at the Canonical partner repository, it seems that Adobe AIR is only offered as a package available from there from Ubuntu 10.04 to Ubuntu 11.04.\nSo starting from Ubuntu 11.10 Adobe AIR is no longer supported as far as I can tell.\nAs an alternative, you might want to look at another technology to write your application. Also, I've noticed that there is this non-open-source but gratis application that is written in AIR and bundle their own Adobe AIR package (I guess from Adobe). Have a look at their .run file for Linux to see how they install the app.\nIn any case, this is just an example for your reference.

Thanks in advance.\n\nA: Configuring GRUB v2\n\nThe configuration file is /boot/grub/grub.cfg, but you shouldn't edit\nit directly. This file is generated by grub v2's update-grub(8), based\non:\nThe script snippets in /etc/grub.d/\nThe configuration file /etc/default/grub\nTo configure grub \"v2\",\nyou should edit\n/etc/default/grub, then run update-grub.

Usually sudo cd /boot/grub should do the trick, otherwise find your grub configuration file by searching for grub.cfg and change the folder.\nGUI: click on DEVICES->COMPUTER->boot->grub or search DEVICES->COMPUTER for file.\nOnce you have located the folder and opened it, run sudo cp grub.cfg grubOldXX.cfg where XX is a serial numeral of your choice.\nGUI: copy paste grub.cfg\nThen, run sudo gedit grub.cfg \nGUI: right click grub.cfg and choose EDIT\nEdit out the entries that you don't want and change your boot order and default boot option as desired (it is straightforward enough).  Every menu entry is conveniently preceded by the term menuentry.   Delete everything from menuentry all the way up to and including the first closing curly bracket }.  \nSAVE YOUR FILE and EXIT GEDIT.\nIMPORTANT: Messing with grub is an activity which has an enormous possibility of going catastrophically wrong.  If your configuration file is messed up your computer simply might not boot.\nAlways have a DVD with a version of Ubuntu handy (no matter what version).

If you check the other postings in the series (by filtering on Category = GRUB) you will also find information on removing old kernels and what happens when a new kernel arrives as an update.  The postings include references to a number of related web sites.  \n\nA: Rather than edit the grub file directly, you should clean up the kernels you don't want.\nStart with this:\ndpkg -l | grep linux-image\n\nThe update-grub script just makes entries for everything it finds in /boot, as far as I'm aware, so removing old linux-image (and linux-headers) packages via apt-get remove  will clean up /boot and therefore clean up your grub config.\nThis is the \"proper\" way to do it and hence will require no special action when newer kernels are released in the future, you'll just have to clean up again at some point probably :)\n\nA: Depending on your grub version, you could use the StartUpManager application to maintain your grub menu. Its Advanced Tab settings allow selecting / deselecting a Memtest / Recovery boot entry and also the number of kernel versions. With grub2, \"the Appearance and Advanced tabs contain fewer entries at present, and the Security tab does not exist with Grub 2 fully-installed.\" (see here, \"Grub 2 Note\").\n\n\nA: You can boot into the  UEFI Shell and issue:\nShell> bcfg boot dump -v\nShell> bcfg boot rm 3\nShell> exit\n\nSource: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface#efibootmgr\n\nA: Using gedit, edit the grub.cfg file located at /boot/grub.\nRemove the one which is not working.

How well does the built-in GPU in a Intel Core i5 2500K support unity? Will I need a discreet graphics to run it?\n\nA: Even tough there are many people running Unity3D around with the builtin GPU's from Intel the results can be a bit slow or not as snappy as with a discrete card.\nSome people have no complaints over using it but if you feel it is not as fast as you would like then you can always try Unity2D, which will mostly not care what card you are using.\nUnity3D's compiz takes a heavy toll in the system's performance and if not compensated with a fast GPU it can feel slow. (It can feel slow even with a dedicated GPU).\nYour GPU's driver come directly from Ubuntu repo's and should be installed by default when you install Ubuntu 11.10.\n\nA: You certainly do not need a discrete graphics card to run Unity. I have a laptop with a Core i5-2520M (2.5 GHz, 3 MB cache, dual core) and it runs Unity perfectly.\nUnity does use the functionality of the GPU but it has much less demands than a 3D graphics heavy game; you do not need the latest and fastest graphics card for it.\n\nA: There is no built in GPU in an Intel Core i5 2500K, as that is a CPU.

I would like to install python-envisage (4.0.1), but in the Ubuntu 10.04 Software Center there is only python envisage v3.1.1. Also, the package is renamed from python-envisagecore to python-envisage.\n\nA: The software-center will have only the versions of software as available at the time of release of the distro.  These versions are considered stable and only stability & security fixes are released.  \nVery rarely are complete new versions made available on stable releases - this is especially true for LTS releases.\nThe normal mechanism to test new versions of software is via testing PPAs - you can search for these on launchpad.net\nI've had a quick look but have not found a v4 of python-envisage  that has been backported for Lucid.\nThus a number of possible solutions (although not exhaustive...) are:\n\n\n*\n\n*stick with the version you are using\n\n*upgrade to 11.10 (through 10.10 & 11.04)\n\n*install a virtualisation solution to run 11.10\n\n*dual boot with 11.10\n\n*... and if you are feeling particularly brave - compile from source.\n\n\nA: Use some python package manager like: easy_install or pip, both are avaliable from the Software Center.\nYou should follow this steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove any Envisage version installed through the Ubuntu package manager or any other way.\n\n*Install easy_install.\n\n*If the package that you are trying to install has C extensions (and Envisage does), you will need at to install at least this packages: build-essentials, python-dev.

In evince, when searching some text in a pdf file, the result will be displayed one by one by hitting \"next\" or \"previous\" button.\nI wonder if it is possible to glance at once all found results with a little context for each in either evince or other software? I remember adobe acrobat seems to be able to do this, and djview can also do the same for djvu files.\n\nA: As far as I know there is no PDF reader on Linux that offers this capability as a part of its inbuilt toolset. However, you can always use an external desktop search engine such as Recoll to gain an overview of search term instances within a PDF document.\nRecoll's newest releases come with a nifty snippet window that does exactly what you're looking for:\n\nAnd, what's more, clicking on one of the page numbers will immediately direct you to the relevant part of the document and pass the search term to the document viewer. \nNote: this will only work if you use Recoll coupled with a PDF viewer that is capable of being passed page numbers and search terms from the command line. Ubuntu's default PDF viewer, evince, can do that. Others, such as KDE's Okular can't at the moment.\n\nA: Evince 3.10.3, available in Ubuntu 14.04, supports this feature\n\nA: You could use console tools to achieve this (see the second comment on this page):\n$ pdftotext yourPdfFile.pdf -| grep yourSearchString\n\n\nA: Actually there is a purpose of giving like that it is the PDF(PRINTABLE DOCUMENT FORMAT) is generally consists of large volume of data so instead of finding all the pages and displaying the results may take time and for some documents it may fail to run so its is better to display in current page. and actually i think there is no option like that for PDF\n", "Q: \"Can't cd to /var/cache/flashplugin-installer\" error when I try to install Flash \n$ sudo aptitude install flashplugin-installer\n\n   The following partially installed packages will be configured:\n   flashplugin-installer \n    No packages will be installed, upgraded, or removed.\n\n0 packages upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 15 not upgraded.\n\nNeed to get 0B of archives.

You can limit the type of files you want by clicking on the '+' button once the search is started and adding a rule on the file type.\nThat's pretty much all you can do, I think. For advanced search, advanced users use the command line program find and other users don't have any solutions.\n\nA: I am going to address the \"first, actual, question\". after extensive search and irssi, circa sep 2013, the answer appears to be;\nNo, Not possible - that the Nautilus ctrl-F search cannot find ALL files (including files without extensions).\nPlease understand I am truly not seeking to be negative, in fact i believe by actually addressing the problem this may actually get this fixed. \nGiving the advice that the user should instead use a different program (gnome-search-tool), or do something else instead of what was wanted (for files with the (a more constrained) search pattern in their names) is ambiguous and ultimately unhelpful.\nit is either a simple, no this is not possible. or yes, followed by the method to achieve the aim. further advice, if present, should follow an answer to the actual question. \n\nA: Sounds like a job for gnome-search-tool.\n\nIt can perform partial matches on the file name and search on more options:\n\n\n*\n\n*File content\n\n*Modification date\n\n*Size\n\n*File emptiness\n\n*Owner/Group\n\n*Name pattern exclusion\n\n*Name regular expression match\n\n*Hidden and backup files\n\n\nIt can also: \n\n\n*\n\n*Follow symbolic links\n\n*Exclude other filesystems\n\n\nYou can define a a location to search.

I think I FINALLY figured this out, after years of trying... sigh.\n\nA: I wanted to add, apart from the answers provided and extending on the answer by Octavian, a simple way of enhancing the search option is by activating type-ahead. With the following terminal line we can make the search more intuitive:\ngsettings set org.gnome.nautilus.preferences enable-interactive-search false\n\n\nA: I discovered just by chance that, unlike what is stated in another answer, and despite what is not documented in Help (!!!), a space character in the search string does does not act as a wildcard but as an AND condition.\nExample: \"screen .png -4\" will find filenames that contains all of the 3 \"sceen\", \".png\" and \"-4\" strings.\nI'm highly surprised that the Helps are (generally) so imprecise and that no Nautilus search special strings are used, and inserted by the \"+\" icon, to add special search conditions such as the much needed \"not in subfolders\" option.\n\nA: The best advice I can give you is:\n\n*\n\n*Use Nemo (looks like Nautilus, works like Nautilus, but crashes less often and is not made by ret***** people)\n\n*Use Krusader (very powerful two-panel commander, a bit heavy for daily use)\n\n*Use Total Commander on Wine (most powerful search ever, very lightweight, but lacks double-click file launch as you'd expect.

How can I get the picture folder to show up in the UbuntuOne folder on my laptop?  I was hoping this would be an easy way to get photos from phone to computer.\n\nA: you will probably need to tell ubuntu one on your laptop to sync your photos folder. If you open the ubuntu one app on your laptop the photos folder wil prbably  hopefully be displayed, bt will be greyed out or untick (cant remember). just tel ubuntu one that you want to sync it . job done \n\nA: To collectively answer the questions and doubts from the answers below:\nUbuntu One Files uploads pictures to a cloud folder named \"Pictures - \". It is not a folder within your Ubuntu One folder, so you need to go to Ubuntu One Control Panel, the tab called Cloud Folders, and mark that folder for synchronization. Only then pictures from your phone will start syncing down to your computer.\nYou can also change upload location of your photos by opening the Android app and navigating to Menu > Settings > Configure auto-upload > Upload directory.\nIf you wish to upload to a different 'cloud folder', you can create a directory on your computer, tell Ubuntu One to synchronize it, and then using the aforementioned 'Upload directory' option, select that location.\n\nA: I've just noticed this problem in Ubuntu 10.04.

How do I change permissions to run Virt-Manager as user?\nIs there a way to install guest additions on Ubuntu 11.10?\n\nA: Red Hat Virtual Machine Manager supports KVM, Qemu, and Xen, but not Virtual Box that comes with their own graphical or command line management tools.\nFor full support of all features (incl. USB 2.0 and RDP) the installation of the up-to-date closed source or PUEL version (free) of Virtual Box is recommended (see this answer for details).\nAfter that guest additions need to be installed on the Ubuntu guest as is further elaborated in this answer. \nFor shared folders usage see here.\n\nA: The solution although a little bit confusing is this:\nUbuntu Guest with Ubuntu Host\nAfter installing the Guest Ubuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*Load the Guest Addition ISO from the Virtualbox Menu\n\n\n*In the guest Ubuntu open a terminal and install some essential files for the Guest Addition to install correctly: \nsudo apt-get install dkms build-essential linux-headers-generic in my case of 32Bit\n\n*Run the Linux Guest Addition installer in the Guest Ubuntu. Open the terminal, cd yourself to the mounted image (In my case is cd /media/cyrex/VBOXADDITIONS_4.1.6_74713). In your case you need to input cd /media/USER/VBOXADDITIONS_VIRTUALBOX_VERSION where USER is your username and VIRTUALBOX_VERSION is the current version you are installing. After that run the Guest Addition: \nsudo ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run (It is in the root directory of the ISO image)\n\n\n*Since you installed the needed packages in step 2, you should be fine after installing the Linux Addition since it will configure with no problems. Say yes to a question or two it might ask but this will not do you harm since it will be checking to see if you have the guest addition installed already. Reboot after finishing the install.\n\n*Now when the guest starts again you should see that you have several new options available like input devices, views, etc.. but the one you are needing is SHARE FOLDERS!!. To share a folder you already know that is done from the Virtualbox Menu.\n\n\n*But what we need is to connect to this Shared folder from the Host. To do this first create a folder in the guest which will link to the shared folder from the host. For example lets create in the guest home folder the directory virtual. Now assuming the shared host folder is also called virtual we would set this up in the guest like this:\nsudo mount -t vboxsf virtual ~/virtual\nNow you can access the shared folder.\nNOTES ON HOW TO SHARE, AUTO MOUNT AND 3D\n\n\n*\n\n*The name of the shared host folder must be the same as the guest folder. In the example mentioned above you have both named virtual, but it could be both named bck, shared, virtualbox, etc... This will solve several \"protocol\" errors.\n\n*Since mounted shares have by default root as owner, to mount them as YOU, you can do for example:\nsudo mount -t vboxsf -o uid=1000, gid=1000 virtual ~/virtual when mounting them\n\n*To automount a share folder add it to /etc/fstab. This way when you load the guest it will have the shared folder already mounted.\n\n*If (JUST IF!!) you by change have a editing/saving problem directly in the shared folder. Just copy over the file to another place. Edit the file, save it, copy over back to the shared folder, replacing the one in there.\n\n*If the 3D Acceleration support was not enabled when you did the virtualbox setup. Do not worry just run the guest addition again after activating it as seen here:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*You can also do the Guest Addition setup from the Proprietary Driver Manager. That is, jockey-gtk As seen in this picture (This is the same as Step 2)\n\n\n\nAfter all of this you should have a Virtualbox that shares folders with the host and back and has 3D acceleration. Here is an image of the outcome:\n\nWindows Guest with Ubuntu Host\nIf you are using Windows Vista and up, by simply installing the Guest Addition, Sharing the folder (The same procedure as in the Ubuntu example) and rebooting the Windows Guest session you will automatically see the Shared folder between both systems.\nIf you are using Windows XP, 2000 or 2003 you can use the answer shown in: How do I set up shared folders in a Windows XP virtualbox guest?\nTo do the sharing via a command line, Takkat has a nice tutorial in How to access a shared folder in VirtualBox? and in How do I set up shared folders in a Windows XP virtualbox guest?\nTo understand how the network works inside a virtual environment (in this particular case) see Wireless Network in Virtualbox\n", "Q: How to fully remove the eclipse package? I installed Eclipse via command apt-get install eclipse.\nThis command completed correctly.\nAfter this, I run Eclipse and add some configurations: Added a new URL for \"Available Software Sites\".\nOn the next step, I try removed Eclipse via apt-get remove eclipse and install eclipse again.\nAnd here I see a surprise: in the newly installed Eclipse, I see my old URL for \"Available Software Sites\". \nSo, I guess, that the configuration file(s) is not removed.\nAfter this I tried different commands: something like this:\nsudo dpkg -r eclipse\nsudo apt-get --purge remove eclipse\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nBut after I again install Eclipse I see my URL.\nHow I can fully remove Eclipse along with its configuration files?\n\nA: Your personal configuration files are stored in your home directory.\nCheck ~/.eclipse/ or ~/.config/eclipse/\nNote, these are hidden directories (Ctrl+H in Nautilus to show, or ls -la).\n\nA: To get rid of old configurations and options, delete the .eclipse directory from your home directory. You can do this with the help of following command:\nrm -rf ~/.eclipse\n\n\nA: This is a pretty normal behaviour because in this case all the settings belong to a personal profile and not to the application itself; also at the first boot you were asked for the workspace location and there you can locate your files, and that path is used by Eclipse to retrieve your settings.\n", "Q: How can I change the background color of the unity launcher? I really dislike the slight dark-purple tint to the side-launcher bar and shell surrounding the menu after pressing the meta key.  How can I set this to another color?\n\nThere are configure options available for Unity here but there is no option for this, so I am looking for pointers in the code where this can be set.\n\nA: (This is an incomplete answer that needs improvement and investigation, but should provide someone who knows C++ with enough detail to find the real answer)\nBy default the Launcher uses a light gray semi-transparent color. When you hit invoke the dash, the entire thing takes on a blurred look based on the averages of your wallpaper colors. I asked Marco Trevisan where this can be modified, but it's in a bunch of places.\nHowever, for the launcher when it's just sitting there you need to look in Launcher.cpp:\nFirst grab the code:\nbzr branch lp:unity\n\nThen look in unity/plugins/unityshell/src/Launcher.cpp for the _background_color variable and adjust accordingly. \n\nA: My trick (has to be re-done every restart / log in):\n* MyUnity (program) -> Dash -> Blur ON (or, at your own risk: ccsm -> unity plugin -> experimental -> blur -> static)\n* prepare a bitmap (image) of your desired color and desktop size\n* log out\n* don't invoke the dash!\n* open the prepared image in the default viewer, go full screen mode and press the WinKey\nFrom now on the Dash will be almost the color you wanted to be.\n\nA: this just was posted http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2012/01/how-to-change-the-unity-dash-color-in-ubuntu-11-10/ hope this helps :-)\n", "Q: Why does reinstalling a package only take a short time the second time?

Does apt-get save downloaded files?\n\nA: Because apt-get is caching downloaded packages in /var/cache/apt/archives/ and /var/cache/apt/archives/partial/.\nIf you want to install a package apt-get first looks up the cache and only downloads the package again if it couldn't find that package in the cache.\nTo empty the cache you have to issue a apt-get clean.\n\nA: Yap, the packages are cached after installing :)\n/var/cache/apt/....\n", "Q: Server is dropping SSH connections, then not allowing me to log back on I have an ESX box which I have loaded with two Ubuntu Server machines.\nDuring setup, I chose no additional packages to install as I just wanted a lightweight machine for testing.\nThe first thing I did was change the root password via sudo passwd\nAfter ESX got on my nerves through lag, I decided to install OpenSSH via apt-get install openssh-server.\nIt did it's business, and I then opened putty and could connect in to both machines fine.

I thought \"glitch\" and nothing more of it, but, it just happened again!\nI really do not understand this and was hoping someone here can help?\n\nA: The most likely explanation for why you were kicked off of one of your virtual servers, and why you were warned that its SSH key had changed, is that the server's IP address changed. This would have resulted in it going down for a short time (or, if you're using DHCP, was perhaps the result of it going down for a short time). That is, either the server went down, or, more likely, just its network connection was interrupted. This would have interrupted the SSH connection in progress and also could have resulted in the IP address changing so that when you tried to connect to the same IP, you would have been connecting to a different (possibly virtual) machine (with a different SSH key). Or, so that when you tried to connect to the same machine with a different IP, you may have been connecting to a machine whose IP was the same as the IP address of a machine the client had previously connected to (which would give the same error about the SSH key changing).\n\nA: For me, it looks like you are using an IP address that is already in use in your network by another SSHD enabled server. It could explain you being dropped and when you reconnect, putty complains about the key changed.\nPlease check it.\n", "Q: Need to set up shared storage for Guest virtual machines that are running on a Xen host My environment:\nI am doing these things at home with the purpose of learning about virtualization techniques.

For example, sounds in pidgin no longer work. But when I go to Pidgin sound preferences and preview the sounds, they work. Also the sound in the applications work fine as usual. Could this be a bug or is there some workaround for this problem?\n\nA: The problem with Pidgin was that 'Enable sounds' in Tools->Preferences->Sound was set to 'Only when available' and some how my status was set a few days back to away. \nAs for the other desktop notification sounds like the login sound - I found out that it is an issue with Ubuntu where I have to copy all the sound files from /usr/share/sounds/ubuntu/stereo to /usr/share/sounds. After doing that, the standard Ubuntu login sound played on login.\n\nA: Actually, the standard notification sounds, which are set in system settings => sound will not work in Compiz, it seems.  But it's not a sound problem; somehow, the actual event is not being sent.  This is the sound used for errors or warnings.  It includes the visual alerts that can be enabled in system settings => universal access (which has a button that triggers the sound + visual cue).\nI found that it works correctly using Metacity, so I entered a bug report to Compiz.\n\nA: For me, the solution was to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open dconf-editor. \n\n*Navigate to org.gnome.desktop.sound and enable event-sounds.\n\n\nA: using ubuntu 12.04, i installed ubuntu-tweak and on the Tweaks tab, enter the sound section and then enable Event sounds and choose a Sound theme (default \"ubuntu\").\n\nA: You need to add the following startup item to the startup applications. \nStep 1: Click on the system menu at the top right of the screen (looks like a wheel)\nStep 2: Click on startup applications\nStep 3: Click add.\nStep 4: Complete with the following: \nName: GNOME Login sound\nCommand: /usr/bin/canberra-gtk-play --id=\"desktop-login\" --description=\"GNOME Login\"\nComment: Startup Sound\n\nStep 5: Click add.\nStep 6: Click close in the bigger box.\nStep 7: Log off and log in.\nThat worked for me.\n", "Q: Screen resolution is low in tty with fglrx?

If i install fglrx as driver it is set to 640x480p when i start a tty, and the widescreen causes big \"pulled\" letters on my screen.

I realized if I copy files inside of the folder they get synced..\nThus I used touch on other files but nothing happen. How can I initiate syncing of such folders?\n\nA: You should not need to do aything, since Ubuntu One is supposed to detect when a file changes. Touch, however, doesn't change the file contents, and Ubuntu One doesn't track metadata (like modification dates) so it doesn't do aything.\n\nA: This also looks like a bug LP:869920 we are currently working on.

It seems to put a wins entry before [NOTFOUND=return] in /etc/nsswitch.conf, which causes DNS to fail, but can be fixed by moving wins to after the \"NOTFOUND\" part, also, preferably after dns so that dns lookup happens first, see this:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1496488\n(not sure why this happens by default though; comments welcome!)\n\nA: I believe this is caused by mdns - multicast dns, for autoconfiguration of the .local domain.\nIf you check in /etc/nsswitch.conf, you will probably see:\nhosts: files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns mdns4\n\nmdns4 is what is doing multicast dns. Try changing this to:\nhosts: files dns\n\nAnd see if it makes any difference. If it makes it work, you can remove mdns permanently with:\nTry apt-get remove libnss-mdns\nWhich will do the nsswitch.conf change for you as well.\nAlternatively, don't use .local - use .lan or something instead.\n\nA: In my case removing  resolve [!UNAVAIL=return], solved the issue\ncat /etc/nsswitch.conf\n...\n#hosts:          files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] resolve [!UNAVAIL=return] dns myhostname\nhosts:          files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns myhostname\n...\n\n", "Q: How do I enable my synaptics trackpad?

Nvidia, for example, ships a GUI configuration tool with its driver that allows you to add, remove, and modify the geometry of displays without restarting the X server (the tool also provides the option of permanently saving the changes to xorg.conf but that's not what you're asking). These tools cannot, however, add or remove X displays since that capability is reserved for the X server itself.\nSomething to consider down the road: X is eventually being replaced by Wayland which will (hopefully) be much easier to configure than X and offer the ability to add or remove displays while running.\n", "Q: gnome-terminal and midnight-commander in different Unity Launcher's groups I have a gnome-terminal icon and midnight-commander icon in launcher. When I press mc icon and then press gnome-terminal icon both applications add to the group of applications of mc icon. How can I make them to appear in different icons? \n\nA: You need to pass a --class argument to each launcher so that gnome-terminal thinks it's a separate application.\nYou can do this by just making a custom launcher for one of them (probably mc) and pass it \ngnome-terminal -e mc --disable-factory --sm-client-disable --class=mc\" \n\nthat should be enough for Unity to classify it as a different application, see here:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I make a custom launcher for terminal applications?\n", "Q: Can't install lib32ncurses5-dev or ia32-libs I'm trying to install Android source and I keep getting this error.

I have Oneiric x64.\n\nA: This seems to be a common problem for those of us with ATI/Radeon graphics cards. See bug 285603.\nFrom what I can tell, the proprietary ATI drivers cause problems with Xorg especially if they exist alongside the opensource ATI drivers.\nTry uninstalling any proprietary ATI drivers (fglrx) and install the open-source ATI drivers instead. The open-source drivers are called 'ati' or 'radeon'.\nThis is a common problem, and the steps are pretty well documented.\nUninstall using the instructions on this page. Try the \"Problem: Need to purge -fglrx\" instructions first, and move to \"Problem: Need to fully remove -fglrx and reinstall -ati from scratch\" if necessary.\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Troubleshooting/FglrxInteferesWithRadeonDriver . \nThen follow these instructions to install the Radeon driver.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/RadeonDriver\nIf you really want the proprietary fglrx  driver, you should still consider replacing the proprietary drivers with the Radeon drivers first, so that you can make your system stable first.

I have 11.10, but it's really much slower than 10.04. So, my question is, if I download it from scratch, will my files from 11.10 still be there?\n\nA: You can not downgrade Ubuntu.\nIf you wish to install a previous version of Ubuntu then you should do a new fresh install which will reformat your file system and hence lose all data.\nSo you must first backup your files. The most important to backup is probably your home directory, but you might want to backup some configuration files from the /etc/ directory.\nYou can backup your files to Ubuntu One cloud, a CD or a USB drive.\n\nA: Yes, they will, provided you go with manual partitioning and opt against formatting the / partition. Since 8.04, the Ubiquity (the Ubuntu installer) Preserve Home feature has been implemented and working.\nIn this way, the /home, /root and /srv will be preserved with the rest deleted.

I just dipped my toes into Linux, and as obvious as it should be, I am starting with Ubuntu as it makes life easier for starters. I believe, the best way to get a grip over command line is to use it for all day-to-day activities - - like app installation, copying, moving and deleting files etc.\nFor me, the most trickiest part has been installing apps via command line. Reason? It's not as simple as $ sudo apt-get install app-name-here - - because sometimes (if not most of the time), we need dependencies etc.\nHaving made that clear, now I ask: is there a way to visualize the terminal commands being issued by the Ubuntu Software Center when I am installing an app?\nThis way I can note down the commands, find the similarities as to how most apps can be installed flawlessly via command line and from then on, install apps via the command line. (Most importantly, this will help me on the server-side as well.)\n\nA: Note that although this is the literal answer to your question it's not the answer you really want.\nYou can see the \"commands\" the software center is issuing by enabling debug mode. You do this by opening a terminal and typing the following command:\nsoftware-center --debug\n\nYou will see all the program's output including package management activities. Look for the parts that contain Apt. You won't be able to reproduce these commands though, unless you make a program yourself that makes use of the same libraries and daemons that software-center is using. If you want to learn more about package management on the command line you are better off reading the man page of apt-get and apt-cache for starters.

Based on values stored in a spreadsheet several menus help you to create graphs of your choice. The Graphs are displayed as you get them (wysiwyg). Double click any element of the graph (or a single click with the right mouse button) to modify its properties. RLPlot is a cross platform development for Linux and Windows. Mac OsX users can find some useful information how to install RLPlot at http://naranja.umh.es/~atg/.\n\n\n\n\nA: I can recommend matplotlib which however is mainly useful for plotting, but then a simpler alternative to gnuplot unless one is not familiar with python.\n\nA: It's going to sound boring, but LibreOffice is certainly easy to use, and its graphs are highly customizable.  You can really make them shine, if you know what you're doing!\n\nA: I usually use python matplotlib. http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/ \nAlthough it is a library it is a very simple one.\nYou just start python interpreter and import the lib. For me it is simpler that most of spreadsheets plotters because I'm always getting lost in the gui.\nYou can see gallery here http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/gallery.html\n\nA: If you are familiar with Matlab, you might find Octave useful (to edit m files). However, I personally prefer python (with matplotlib), as one can manipulate the code to resemble the desired outcome. You may also use the python code and edit it to include data included in a tex file (in CSV format, etc.) so in general, python is a very powerful choice and will give you a broader control over the parameters of your analysis. Good luck. \n\nA: I recommend SciDaVis [1]. Unlike spreadsheet programs it is only for plotting (a better alternative to origin IMHO). You can export as svg files that can easily be added to a web page. \nI also found gnuplot [2] is a lot easier than I thought it was. And it seems to work well with HTML5. It is command line based but very easy to follow with all the examples that are available. \nBoth are available from the software centre (gnuplot might be in synaptic: you might need to install synaptic first).\n\n[1] http://scidavis.sourceforge.net/\n[2] http://www.gnuplot.info/\n\nA: I really like gnuPlot. \nhttp://www.gnuplot.info/\nAs @Andres says, it's not difficult to learn, and it produces publication quality graphs, before they got lazy and journals started printing Excel charts :) \n\nA: I personally like R (equivalently octave) which essentially gives you all you need and awesome plots quality. Also consider gnuplot, much easier and faster to use.\n\nA: wxMaxima is a graphical user interface for the computer algebra system Maxima. It eases the use of Maxima by making most of its commands available through a menu system and by providing input dialogs for commands that require more than one argument.

Do you know a download possibility for powertop 1.13 in a deb format, as tar doesnt work for me. Thanks in advance.\n\nA: You can download 1.13 version via http://packages.ubuntu.com/natty/powertop \nLook bottom of the page and downlod the package according to your OS architecture. \nBut, when you update your repositories (and also your system) powertop will be upgraded.

Is there a way to push all available resources to the program(VirtualBox) when running Ubuntu?\n\nA: You can give a process more CPU time relational to other processes by re-nice-ing it. For example, run\npgrep VirtualBox\nto get the PID of VirtualBox. If more than one number pops up, you should run top to see which one is using all the CPU - this is likely to be the one you want to fiddle with. The PID is the first column.\nThen you can do:\nrenice -5 PID\nwould give PID a nice value of -5. This gives it more CPU time than other processes competing for it.\n\"Niceness\" ranges from -19 to 20; -19 is least-nice, meaning gets the most CPU time. 0 is the default. renice must be run as root, i.e., with sudo, to change \"niceness\" to anything below 0.\nThe changed niceness only lasts as long as the process runs; it will no longer be in effect after quitting VirtualBox, for next time you run it. (So you'll have to do it again each time.)\nI don't think you can change the amount of RAM given to a VirtualBox guest at runtime. This would need to be done before booting it, in the virtual machine configuration.\n", "Q: How to activate cube and related Compiz features without crashing Unity?

Measuring both cursor dimensions in GIMP shows that they are both 25px wide and 39px high (depending on where you take the threshold of the border blur, of course, but it's still consistent). It only looks smaller on the desktop because the black border of the pointer is not visually distinct against the dark desktop background.\n\nA: I got a huge cursor in ubuntu 16.04 after a reboot\ni fixed it by editing ~/.Xresources or ~/.Xdefaults and adding this line : Xcursor.size: 12 and then execute xrdb ~/.Xresources (or ~/.Xdefaults). \nNew application should be fixed, to apply to all application you should restart X11\nI also tried to start dconf-editor and going to org->desktop->gnome->interface and change the cursor-size from 24 to 12.

I wish to dual boot ubuntu (currently installed) with fedora and/or openSUSE (fedora for vanilla gnome and SUSE for a good KDE experience). I do not know much about dual booting and grub. Do I only have to put in the liveCD and install side by side? Or do I have to partition and stuff? Also, is there an easy way to remove one if I do not want it?\nPlease note that I do not want them on the same /home partition, I want them to have a different one each. (and also if there is a way that is mostly graphical and user friendly, it would be most appreciated)  \nEDIT: What if I wanted to install something like arch of mint? how would I do that?\n\nA: You can install each system separately, by booting from their respective live/install CD's and running their installers. Whatever order you install them in, each has the ability to resize partitions created by the others to make room for itself. Alternatively you could partition manually so that dynamic partition resizing is not necessary (making sure that each OS's partitions take up little enough space that there's enough unpartitioned space left over for the subsequent OSes). Another benefit to partitioning manually is that you can make them all use the same swap partition, which would probably not happen if you installed without manual partitioning. (On the other hand, if you want to be able to hibernate one OS and boot into another, then they must have separate swap partitions.)\n\nA: While it is (probably) possible to install two distros side by side, just by popping in CDs and following default options, but it is not a good idea to do it without spending some time thinking about partitioning your hard-drive first. \nLet us take the example of installing Ubuntu and Suse together. You would typically want a /boot (< 1gb) ( primary partition) , a (primary or extended) partition (for installing ubuntu swap,/ and /home) and a similar partition for Suse. Then you may want a storage space to be used by ubuntu and suse (but separate from both).\nThis is one possible example (not the best I guess) and partly inspired by (http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/6344/different-linux-distros-sharing-the-same-home-folder).\nIt is probably not a great idea to use same swap and /home for different (linux) distros and  careful planning (and some research) the partition initially will save a lot of pain later. \n", "Q: How do I remove Kernel 3.1 that I added via a PPA? Is there a way to remove kernel 3.1 from Oneiric?\nI downloaded and upgraded to 3.1 with these instructions:\n\nOpen the terminal and run these two commands for both 32-bit and\n  64-bit versions of Ubuntu 11.10/11.04:\nwget http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa...241006_all.deb\nsudo dpkg -i linux-headers-3.1.0-030100_3.1.0-030100.201110241006_all.deb\n\nUbuntu (64-bit)\nFor Ubuntu 11.10/11.04 (64-bit), issue these commands:\nwget http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa...1006_amd64.deb\nsudo dpkg -i linux-headers-3.1.0-030100-generic_3.1.0-030100.201110241006_amd64.deb\nwget http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa...1006_amd64.deb\nsudo dpkg -i linux-image-3.1.0-030100-generic_3.1.0-030100.201110241006_amd64.deb\n\n\nEverything went well. I was able to reboot quickly, but Firefox and Chrome constantly crash with Kernel 3.1. I am using Gnome 3.2 and saw improvement with 3.0.0.13 provided by ppa. Any help with 3.1 or just removing it would be helpful. Thanks to all that reply.\n\nA: First boot into a kernel that you DONT want to remove i.e. boot into 3.0.x not 3.1.x.\nTo remove the packages you have just installed, you will need to find out their names.  Run the following in a terminal:\ndpkg -l | grep \"linux\\-[a-z]*\\-\"\n\nFor example - in my case:\n\nWhat you are looking for are similarly named kernel 3.1 packages -\nFor my example - I've highlighted similar packages I want to remove - the command syntax would be:\nsudo apt-get remove linux-headers-2.6.38-11\nsudo apt-get remove linux-headers-2.6.38-11-generic\nsudo apt-get remove linux-image-2.6.38-11-generic\n\nTo make it easier, just copy and paste the package names after typing sudo apt-get remove\nFinish off by running:\nsudo update-grub\n\n\nA: It is advisable, though not strictly necessary, to reboot and select an older kernel first. You can remove a kernel \"under\" the system that is running it--it will continue to stick around in memory and function OK. But just in case some problem has developed preventing your older kernels from working, you should try booting to one of them first. (Also, some installation processes might assume that the running kernel is actually installed.)\nTo use an older kernel, reboot and hold down Shift while your computer is starting up. You should see different options for booting, like a recovery mode and an option to check your memory/RAM. If you see any options for a kernel that is not version 3.1, select the latest such kernel (don't select \"recovery mode\"). That is, select the 3.0-series kernel with the highest version number, but do not select a 3.1-series kernel. If you don't see any such option, then select the option to view older kernels, and select it there.\nIn the unlikely event that you attempt to boot from an older kernel but cannot, you should not proceed with the uninstallation, as that might be the only kernel you have (if no others are listed) or the only kernel that is properly functioning. (In that case, you should post a comment to this question detailing what happened, and I'll add information about how to solve this problem to my question...or request more information if necessary. However, given the information you have provided, this situation is extremely unlikely.)\nAfter booting from an 3.0-series kernel (or not, if you decided to forego that), you can remove the 3.1-series kernel you installed by running this command:\nsudo apt-get purge linux-headers-3.1.0-030100 linux-headers-3.1.0-030100-generic linux-image-3.1.0-030100-generic\n\nUsing remove instead of purge (as suggested in the other answers so far) will work too but may leave some left-over global configuration files; purge is probably preferable.\nIt's not necessary to search for the packages to remove using something like dpkg -l | grep \"linux\\-[a-z]*\\-\" (as this answer suggests) or sudo aptitude search ~i | grep linux-image (as this one suggests) because we know exactly what packages you installed (since you provided the instructions used to install them, which includes the exact package names). Your older (i.e., 3.0-series) kernels would not have been removed automatically, and the version for this kernel would not have changed since you installed it by manually downloading and installing the .deb files rather than by actually enabling the PPA. (If you'd installed it from the PPA, then you still wouldn't have to search--you could just ppa-purge the PPA.) We also do not have to worry about virtual packages being installed that would result in the 3.1-series kernel coming back automatically; installing those virtual packages would give you the newer kernel, but installing the newer kernel as you did above would not install those virtual packages.\nThus the steps described above should be quite sufficient.\n\nA: Reboot and from the grub menu you should be able to select the previous installed kernel, if your old kernel has been removed, you can find the package to install with sudo aptitude search linux-image\nyou can then find your 3.1 kernel using sudo aptitude search ~i | grep linux-image and remove with sudo apt-get remove linux-image-XXX\nrun sudo update-grub to remove the outdated kernel entries from the boot menu\n", "Q: How do I get package update notifications on login?

I recommend checking:\nsudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\n(Please note that it is possible that there are updates available, but that they only recently became available, and were not seen before running sudo apt-get update. If you want to know for sure if the reason you're not being notified of updates is because there are none available, then you should run sudo apt-get upgrade or sudo apt-get dist-upgrade before running sudo apt-get update. But it's advisable to then cancel rather than accepting the updates--if there are any--and run sudo apt-get update before actually updating.)\n", "Q: How to prevent terminal from killing process with ctrl+z I know that you can restore the process by hitting fg and enter after you stop a job with ctrl+z, but I don't think I've ever intended to stop a job.. ever. e.g. I always bump it when typing ctrl+x in VIM.\nHow can I prevent my bash terminal from stopping jobs when I hit ctrl+z?\n\nA: Have you tried using 'unset suspend' in ~/.vimrc or /etc/vimrc, or running vim with '-Z' (to disable suspend).\n", "Q: Change /usr/lib to /usr/lib32 for eclipse to look for *.so files I am trying to run eclipse and I am getting:\n\n/usr/lib/gio/modules/libgvfsdbus.so: wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS64\n  Failed to load module: /usr/lib/gio/modules/libgvfsdbus.so\n\nI already found out that it is because this library is 64bits.

At the moment, I've configured a default user to be logged on automatically, with an autostart item which starts my app, but after the Ubuntu startup screen the user sees the Gnome desktop briefly before my app is started.

But where?\n\nA: Remove the default keybinding using the following commands\n gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings switch-to-workspace-left \"['']\"\n gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings switch-to-workspace-right \"['']\"\n\n\nA: CompizConfig Setting Manager (it's not installed by default though).\nThen go to \"Desktop Wall Plugin\", and it's on the \"Bindings\" tab.\nThat's assuming you are using Unity (full 3D), or (edit) Gnome with effects enabled.\n\nA: Finally, in Ubuntu 22/04 this can be disabled using System Settings -> Keyboard -> View and Customize Shortcuts -> Navigation. In there, find Move to workspace on the left and Move to workspace on the left, click on each entry and re-assign Super+Page Up and Super+Page Down respectively. This will disable any other assigned shortcuts.\n\nA: In my system, those configs are available in System Settings -> Keyboard. Please double-check.\n\nIf those aren't available, you can try add them with gconf-editor. If you use Metacity, simply go to /apps/metacity/global_keybindings and add the corresponding values:\n\nIf you use Compiz, you can follow the steps provided by @ams\n\nA: open gconf-editor.\nGo to /apps/metacity/global keybindings and change the values according to my screenshot:\n\nA: on ubuntu 22:\nwhenever i was pressing ctrl alt left/right my workspace would move.\nHowever, in the keyboards settings I did not have such a shortcut set but i had one for each:\na.

What helped to me was to change IP address of the network printer to the local network settings.

After repairing the IP settings, IP, subnetmask, Default gateway, nameserver (to local network) Wins and domain (cleared) was printer detected differently and i was able to print from ubuntu.\nNetwork printers are usually able to print their network settings and they are usually manageable over web by entering the IP address into a web browser. \nMost probably some DNS magic which was recommended by Pavel Å imerda was missing on my Ubuntu (if exist).\n\nA: Just in case you're in my situation: restart the printer\nI installed a network brother printer using DeviceURI, with dnssd provided automatically.

Something else also changed: before I restarted the printer, I couldn't ping my printer nor had access to its http page (putting its ip in my browser address bar). And now both work.

Maybe there is a simpler way to do what you want.\nA better place to ask this would be http://groups.google.com/group/comp.unix.shell\n\nA: You could have a look at rbash - basically starting bash with -r restricts what a user can do, but I think it might be a bit too restrictive, ie it doesn't allow you to cd anywhere , not even into subdirs of your homedir.\nThe problem with implementing something like this is it's usually possible to break out of unless you get really draconian. I just tried rbash, and simply running \"bash\" in it breaks me out of the restrictions. So you'd have to ensure they can't run any other shell.

Also, when I open Gnome Do, it does not show up until I type the whole name (Gnome Do normally shows partial matches) and does not show an icon.\n\nA: Oh, wow.  The rox-filer package doesn't ship a .desktop file, but it does ship a Debian menu file.  Old school!  That should be filed as a (wishlist) bug against the package.\nDesktop shells (like Unity) and applications (like Do) use the .desktop files to identify applications, their icons, and how to launch them.  Since rox-filer doesn't include a .desktop file, it's not listed as an application.\nYou can create a .desktop file for rox-filer and it'll appear in Unity and Do (after a restart of Do).  You could create a file ~/.local/share/applications/rox-filer.desktop and copy the following text into it:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Rox Filer\nComment=A filer of some sort\nIcon=user-home\nExec=rox-filer\nCategories=Utility;\n\n", "Q: Would a better videocard make Ubuntu UI faster (specifically using gvim)? I have Ubuntu 11.10 with Unity and an Nvidia 7600GS (it has 256Mb memory on board). My resolution is 2560x1440.\nI work a lot in gVim and the overall experience is that it is slow.

Or, if the screen is scrolled down, it obviously lags.\nWhen I lowered the resolution, this sluggishness disappeared. So, my question is, would a better videocard help here?\n\nA: From what you say the problem seems to be that window composition is making your system slow at high resolutions.\nDo a quick test, run Unity2D instead of Unity3D and check how sluggish it is. \nIf it is then probably your system also should get an upgrade (RAM, a faster hard-disk or if possible a faster CPU).\nIf the its not sluggish anymore then a new graphics card would definitely help.\n", "Q: What's a simple \"colour picker\" app for GNOME?

This is generally equivalent to using a cross-over cable to connect two normal ports on two switches.  It doesn't have anything to do with enabling promiscuous mode on a network card\nThe ports on network interface cards do not expect the transmit/receive wires to be crossed this way, so when the switch tries to send data to your computer, it is arriving on the transmit lines rather than the receive lines and vice versa.\nThere are some network cards that would work with the setup you've described, but they would just be detecting the cross over and correcting for it, rather than providing any more features over a standard card.\n", "Q: My Package Version Number Appears Greater Yet apt-get Doesn't Select It Backstory:\nIt was determined that when using lxc container VMs the Nagios nrpe shutdown script when run on the host of the containers would kill the nrpe processes inside the containers.  This was remediated by changing the script to use pidfiles instead of searching the process table for the nrpe process.\nRegrettably start-stop-daemon is a C program that resulted from translating a Perl script and it shows.  There are far too many global varibles in start-stop-daemon.c and although there are some nice blocks of comments there are far to few comments that explain the intent behind variable names such as \"schedule\" (the string \"schedule\" appears in many contexts.)  The manual page for start-stop-daemon strongly suggests that unless you use the \"--retry\" option the start-stop-daemon program may return before the process it sent a signal to actually calls exit() and terminates, however it doesn't actually state this in plain English.\nThe obtuseness of start-stop-daemon is most likely the reason that the \"fixed\" version of the script includes a dubious comment indicating that sometimes the pid file has not been removed.  I can easily see why someone would not understand that he left the --retry option missing.  This bug also causes failures when the script is given the \"restart\" option; the nrpe daemon will shutdown but not start up again.\nDid I mention that since applying the update our nrpe servers started crashing over and over?

Maybe there's a config in your school's network that sends an automatic proxy configuration to your browser, and your ubuntu browser is not receiving it. Check it with the network administrator. If it's not the case...\nTry do diagnose your problem following this steps:\n1) Connect to the wireless network\n2) Check your IP address with \"ifconfig\"\n3) Check if your gateway is set correctly with \"route -n\"\n4) Try to ping your gateway. Is it working?\n5) Try to ping an internet IP like google: \"ping 74.125.234.115\" \n6) Try to resolve names with \"nslookup www.google.com\" for example.\n7) Try to traceroute to an IP or name on internet. Check the result to see the last hop you reached.\n8) If you passed all those tests, try this: \"telnet www.google.com 80\"\nIf everything works, but not the test #8, your problem could be related to some proxy configuration.

I have been recently trying to find a solution for this on the web but did not find something useful or accurate for Ubuntu 11.10. I also consulted the NVIDIA help, but things there did not work for me.\nI installed the additional drivers from system settings but they are not fully compatible with my GeForce 6200. First I tried finding how to stop the X server. I succeeded, but another problem was the nouveau kernel.\nThis is really frustrating. Can anybody tell me an accurate and authentic way to install NVIDIA drivers?\n\nA: I just did this last night.  Here is what I did.\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy all instructions down somewhere or cut & paste to a text file you can read on a virtual console - you will be completing this without a graphical user interface.\n\n*Download the appropriate Linux driver from nvidia.com.  It comes as a \"self extracting archive\" that you run just like a shell script.  I changed permissions on the file after download was complete to make it executable (chmod +x << name of download file >>).\n\n*Run sudo apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-`uname -r` in a terminal.\n\n*At this point I switched to a virtual console (hold down Ctrl+Alt+F6 at the same time). By default Ubuntu seems to preconfigure 5 virtual consoles ... might come in handy to switch back and forth at some point. Just replace F6 with any function key from F1 to F5.\n\n*Shutdown X-Windows: sudo service lightdm stop\n\n*Remove old version drivers: sudo apt-get --purge remove $(dpkg -l | grep nvidia | awk '{print $2}')\n\n*Run the downloaded script from NVIDIA and follow all of its prompts: sudo <script>\n\n*Reboot.\n\n\nAt one point the NVIDIA script complained about some pre-install script having an error and gave me the option to continue or not - I continued.  Seems to be working.\nNo warranties expressed or implied - use at your own risk. :)\n\nA: This for me worked perfectly. I simply followed the steps and unity was running after a quick restart.  Quick Authentic way to install Proprietary Drivers in Ubuntu\n\nA: 1) You must blacklist nouveau:\nsudo touch /etc/modprobe.d/disable-nouveau.conf\nsudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/disable-nouveau.conf\nAdd the following two lines, save then close:\nblacklist nouveau\noptions nouveau modeset=0\n2) Restart Ubuntu into recovery mode. See the NOTE on the bottom.\n3) Boot to a different run level: sudo init 3\n4) Stop X: sudo services lightdm stop\n5) Manually edit the xorg configuration file. If it doesn't exist, skip this step:\nuse locate xorg.conf to check.\nRemove the line:\n  Driver \"nv\"\n\n(or Driver \"vesa\")\n  (or Driver \"fbdev\")\nand replace it with the line:\nDriver \"nvidia\"\n\nRemove the following lines:\nLoad \"dri\"\nLoad \"GLCore\"\n\nIn the Module section of the file, add the line (if it does not already exist):\nLoad \"glx\"\n\n6) cd to the driver file and then install the driver: sudo sh NVIDIA-Linux-<version>.run\nMake it an executable first if necessary: chmod +x NVIDIA-Linux-<version>.run\n7) If you did not have an xorg.conf file to edit earlier, let the installer create a configuration file for you when it asks.\n8) Startup X and restart Ubuntu: sudo services lightdm start\nThe steps above are what I have used and got it running successfully.

I think the nvidia-current driver (in the main repository) is available for Ubuntu 11.10 but you probably should update to either 12.04 or 12.10 anyway.\n\nA: A much better and possibly safer way to get the most recent graphics drivers is adding the Xorg-Edgers fresh X crack ppa to your sources. The line for your sources, instructions on how to use this ppa, warnings and notes on how to deactivate it are found on the Xorg-Edgers Launchpad page. \n\nI strongly advice you to read these instructions as drivers on this page are not tested, experimental, and may even break your system.\n\nAdding the ppa will automatically offer you newer versions or bugfixes, and in addition you will be much better off in case you need to remove a driver. This all can't be done as easily with drivers downloaded from the manufacturer.\n\nA: I tried downloading a driver from NVidia's web site for Ubuntu 12.10 and it failed miserably.

Please edit your X configuration file and restart the X server\n\nAny ideas?\n\nA: You laptop has a hybrid card, you have a intel + nvidia card running in your system, the drivers you are installing for you nvidia are not working correctly because they are not being loaded on startup.\nYou Intel card is running as primary so you have 2 options:\n1) If you BIOS allows to turn off the Intel card and leave the nVidia one running then the drivers will work correctly;\n2) Use software that enables you to use some functions of your nVidia card, its called Bumblebee and its largelly discussed on use/installation, etc, on the site.\n\nA: with the Z570 there is a switch on the front of the laptop flick it and then you can make the Nvidia your primary graphics card in the nvidia settings\n\nA: Under the 11.04 and laters the default driver for the Nvidia cards are the nouveau but they can't be installed on the same machine with the official nvidia driver, so you have to purge that package before installing the nvidia closed source driver.\nsudo apt-get --purge remove xserver-xorg-video-nouveau\n\nafter that install the driver trough jockey-gtk ( \"Additional drivers\" dialog )\ngksudo jockey-gtk\n\nAfter that you can manage your configuration files with the nvidia-settings package, so install it with\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-settings\n\nand start the control panel with\ngksudo nvidia-settings\n\nthis is the right procedure in a nutshell, looking at your report you probably miss the config files so if you do not want to do by hand install and use the nvidia-settings utility.\n", "Q: Bursts of white noise sound when playing videos I've recently freshly reinstalled Ubuntu, and Mythbuntu, on all my computers.\nOn one of my computers, Mythbuntu 11.10, when I play a video, when it starts, I get a burst of white noise (static) that stays on.\nIf I stop the video and restart it, the noise goes away.\nSometimes if I fast forward or manipulate the video, the noise will start. It seems to be initiated, and stopped, by starting or interacting with the video.\nAny ideas as to why this is happening and how I can get rid of it?\n\nNow that I have some free time on the holidays, I've made a video of the problem and uploaded it here.\nAs you can see in the video, it starts playing normally. I hit the skip forward button a few times, and it's fine. After a few presses, you can hear the white noise burst. After that, the noise comes or goes at each press of the button. Each button press will randomly initiate or kill the white noise.\nAlso note that in the video it started without white noise. Sometimes, however, the white noise begins immediately on video start. Lastly, in the video I just pressed the skip forward and backward buttons. However, pause and and most any other button will also sometimes trigger the white noise.\nI hope that makes much more clear what the problem is.\n\nA: To confirm if this is a pulseaudio issue, I would temporarily disable pulseaudio:\necho autospawn = no|tee -a ~/.pulse/client.conf && killall pulseaudio\n\nThen in MythTv - Utilities/Setup - Setup - General change your Audio settings to ALSA:default\nTo revert to pulseaudio:\nchange the value of autospawn=no to autospawn=yes in ~/.pulse/client.conf \nThen logout and login\n\nOnce confirmed as a PulseAudio issue, you perhaps have three choices:\n\n\n*\n\n*File a bug report with the MythTV developers and hope that they fix the issue.  You'll need to be proactive with them to enable them to help you etc.\n\n*Look at the existing 10.04 pulse-audio bug report and see if the same or similar patch can be done to the Oneiric MythTV sources - not for the faint-hearted!\n\n*Look at just use ALSA:Default as the MythTV audio-setting.  You shouldnt need to kill the host pulse-audio - thus multicasting etc should still work.  You may need to enable the MythTV software controls to change sound settings.  Alternatively/Additionally, install gnome-alsamixer or just alsamixer to control your audio settings such as volume, enabled speakers etc.\n\n\nA: Some applications can directly access to your sound card or using PulseAudio, or they use different solutions such as ALSA, and this is the main reason why you are experiencing this kind of problem only with certain software.\nThe solution is really tricky, because different sound cards can have really different behaviour, and with that i mean \"really really really really different\", also different application can use different framework.\ntry to change the output with the gstreamer-properties dialog menu.\nor you can try this https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/lucid/+source/mythtv/+bug/550100/comments/8 that is a post from this topic https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/lucid/+source/mythtv/+bug/550100\n", "Q: Can a Windows computer access Pulse sound server on an Ubuntu computer?

The Debs for linux are HERE it's a paid program but there is a free trial. or use Icecast\n\nA: I would use something else that's established for broadcast, like Icecast. Windows has plenty of clients that can pick up a Icecast stream.\nTakkat has already written a fairly decent set of options for routing PulseAudio over Icecast. That should get you up and running.\nAlternatively there are PulseAudio binaries for Windows.

As a work-around to an issue with ibus, I'm trying to unset the variable $IBUS_ENABLE_SYNC_MODE. I have tried placing \"unset IBUS_ENABLE_SYNC_MODE\" in various places including:\n\n\n*\n\n*.profile\n\n*.bashrc\n\n*/etc/environment\n\n*as a startup application\n\n\nHowever, none of this is reflected in applications launched in Unity; for example, when I launch a terminal from Unity the result is:\n~$ echo $IBUS_ENABLE_SYNC_MODE\n1\n\nWhere should I set this variable so that Unity sources it properly?\nEdit: The reason why my attempts are not working was because IBUS_ENABLE_SYNC_MODE is set internally by Unity code on start-up. So, short of modifying and recompiling Unity by hand, this does not have a solution.\n\nA: The easy way to set personal environment variables for Unity (or any other X session) is to add them to the file $HOME/.xsessionrc.  These variables are seen by everything launched in the session, via menus, GUIs, terminal windows, etc.  For example, put this text in $HOME/.xsessionrc:\n# File sourced by /etc/X11/Xsession, for setting environment variables, etc.\nexport FOOVAR=testing\n\nLog out and back in, then from a shell window:\nmy-pc> echo $FOOVAR\ntesting\n\nTested under 12.04, using Unity.  But this feature is implemented by the /etc/X11/Xsession script used by many types of desktop session, so it should work with any session type.  See the Xsession man page.\n\nA: Create a file in /etc/X11/Xsession.d/ for it, e.g. /etc/X11/Xsession.d/98local (it has to be executed before 99x11-common_start).\nIf this doesn't work try to find out where the variable gets set. Something like \nsudo grep -r IBUS_ENABLE_SYNC_MODE /etc/\n\nmay help here to find the file.\n\nA: I don't know what you are trying to do with this but usually every variable that needs to be \"global\" is set or unset in /etc/bash.bashrc so you have to edit this file.\n", "Q: How do I preserve the recovery paritition for the notebook eMachines e442 while installing Ubuntu? So as wrote in the Q, here my problem:\nI want to install Ubuntu (11.10) on my notebook. On the hard drive I have a 14Gb partition for recovery (with the factory image). I need to preserve it at any cost because this notebook comes without any cd/dvd for recovery. Could you tell me a safe way to install my beloved uby?\n\nA: During the installation process on the Live CD you will be presented with a menu to choose how you want to install (Alongside Windows, erase the drive and Install Ubuntu, or Something Else). Choose Something Else and you will be presented with a list of partitions. Delete the Windows partitions, but leave the 14GB recovery partition. From there, select New Partition, Choose an EXT4 file system, check the format option, and mount it to /. Afterwards, simply install. It should leave your recovery partition in tact and install Ubuntu in another partition.\n\nA: probably this is not the answer you are looking for but in my experience i can give you an advice: erase and start from 0.\nIn a nutshell the recovery partition is composed by:\n\n\n*\n\n*your operative system\n\n*drivers\n\n*junk ( spyware, useless software, more useless trials ) \n\n\nFrom this list the only things that can gain your attention are the OS, that you can easily install from other source, the only thing that matters is the fact that your license is connected to that specific OEM edition of that OS, i.e. \"Windows XP professional OEM\", and also your license is rapresented by your sticker and not by your recovery partition or cd, or dvd, or whatever else; the drivers are usually outdated and is always better to download them from the internet at the moment you decide to make a new installation.\nI had different laptops and netbooks and i can give you this advice without expecting any points against. Also consider that is really easy to boot from USB any modern OS, and you only need a 4Gb usb dongle to do that for everyone of them ( only the Microsoft's OS requires 4Gb, a GNU/linux distro usually requires 1Gb )\n", "Q: Trackpad Freezes often I have newly installed Ubuntu 11.10 on my system and as soon as I start my system the trackpad freezes and I have to restart the system once again and there after every few minutes this keeps happening.Any solution for this problem ??\n\nA: I'm having this problem too, but after trying different solutions, I founded that when I press Ctrl+C (the simple text copy command), no matter where I am, my touchpad goes off and pressing again Ctrl+C give me back my touchpad ... \nAnyway I think is just a shortcut from Compiz, because is the only change I have made recently...But I didn't found it yet ! \nI hope this helps someone...\nPS: Always the commands \nsudo modprobe -r psmouse\nsudo modprobe psmouse\n\nhad worked for me !\n\nA: Looks like recent interactions from other projects has caused this bug to become more visible.  see bug:868400. \nWorkaround from the bug:\n\n\n*\n\n*open terminal window, <Ctrl-Alt-T>\n\n*type: gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.mouse active false\n\n*close your session with: gnome-session-quit\n\n*After logging in again - should be back to working.\n\n\nAlso, plugging in a USB mouse worked for me before I tried the workaround. \n\nA: Have you tried the command (in terminal window, Ctrl-Alt-T )\nsynclient TouchpadOff=0\nIt will not solve the problem, but maybe unfreeze he touchpad for the moment.\nAnother fix that has been reported is to uncheck the \"Disable touchpad while typing\" in the system settings, mouse and touchpad. \nHopefully all the filed bug reports will lead to a permanent solution, but for now you can try the above suggestions.\n", "Q: How do I get a BCMWL4306 wireless card working?

I've been using KVM in combination with Virt-Manager and Remmina at a fair success up until now. The issue I need to solve now is to get audio from a virtualized Windows XP and make it audible on the Ubuntu 11.10 host.\nRemmina / RDP works for 'simple' audio (system sounds and such), but when the source gets trickier (e.g. Flash audio), Remmina / RDP messes up. So I figured I'd just connect to the machine directly using Virt-Manager. Unfortunately, it seems that even though I have successfully configured the AC97 audio device on WinXP, it's unable to get it's output to the Ubuntu host. This is probably because Virt-Manager uses VNC (and AFAIK, VNC doesn't transport audio).\nDoes anyone know if there is a solution to fix this? I've heard of Spice, but the installation required so much voodoo last time I checked, I figured I'd let that solution boil to maturity a little longer ;)\nBut perhaps there are other options I haven't thought of yet (which don't require switching to VirtualBox / VMware)...\n\nA: Somebody clicked a link above that put the URL for this page into one of my logs and I stumbled on it just now. I'm sure the subject is no longer important but just in case it might help somebody:\nI'd like to point out a small detail for people who are still using K/Ubuntu 11.04: The PulseAudio system is quite sophisticated and the people who maintain it consider it to have some security issues. As such, in 11.04, they had a bunch of features that were turned OFF by default. They were related to the permissions that a VM could get so that it would talk to Pulse. \nIf you rummage around the various configuration files for virt-manager, KVM and Pulse Audio you can just change the settings to allow VM's to talk to the local pulse installation without restriction (well, it makes sense if you are the only user on a desktop - don't do it if you are sharing a server with multiple users.) Sorry I can't remember the specifics. I have had no reason to look at any of this stuff since upgrading to K/Ubuntu 12.04.\nRegarding RDP: For a long time there were bugs in rdesktop related to audio. At some point the problems were resolved and I used rdesktop without any difficulty. Unfortunately I can't remember if it was the rdesktop group that changed their code or if the solution was to change the permissions in Pulse. In any case I don't remember any significant difficulty under K/Ubuntu 11.10 and, once again, I'm not having any sound issues as of K/Ubuntu 12.04\nFinally, FYI, some months after I wrote the above-mentioned howto about spice (which has moved, btw, to this link and remains one of the most popular articles on my site,) Canonical did incorporate the most excellent SPICE work of Mr. Derzhavets into the main Ubuntu repos. So, if you upgrade now to K/Ubuntu 12 you will find that SPICE just works - out of the box, no voodoo - with both WinXP and Linux VM's. \nI should mention that K/Ubuntu 12.04 gave me choppy video (I was watching Netflix over a local network to a WinXP VM,) but it did work. Now I've upgraded to 12.10 and the video is smooth, audio is excellent. Again: this is out of the box. Just create your VM and, if it's WinXP, install the appropriate SPICE drivers. Instructions are available in the same howto\nIf you have VM's that you created under K/Ubuntu 11 you can follow the instructions under \"Modifying a VM's Hardware Configuration\" to add SPICE support.\nNote that your video drivers might give you better/different results on 12.04 and even 12.10. Also I am using the simple spicec client, not the more sophisticated client that is called via virt-manager.)\nHTH and thanks for the link! All the best, God bless, --Sam.\n\nA: Spice is supposed to address this, I've not verified this myself yet. Personally,\nI'd prefer my Windows VMs to stay quiet :).

I've finally found how to enable compression in btrfs, and would like to do so. However, as my main drive, I'm not really wanting to risk a change that could corrupt the hard drive.\nEverything I've read indicates that these options are safe to change, as they only apply on  new writes, but I'd like some more assurance...\nCan I have a rough explanation on how the compression algorithm works? Is it per file (as I think it has to be?)\nAfter this is on, what options/commands are there to recompress the hard drive?\n\nA: I can only answer with the available information in the different related btrfs sites. As you say, using compression is relatively safe as compression is only applied to the new written content. As per the stability of the FS, it is still in testing stage, although it seems to be pretty stable right now. About recompressing the whole disk, I'm not sure you can do it (I haven't seen it). It shouldn't be difficult to write such tool. Right now the obvious way is to copy/move the data from the partition to other disk/partition, and then re-copying, but it implies having enough space in another disk or partition to do the copy (and a fair amount of time)...\n\nA: You can initiate a compression of a btrfs file system that has files written when it was mounted without compression by triggering a defragment:\nsudo btrfs fi defragment /path\n\nNote that path can be a directory or file within a btrfs volume, you don't need to do the whole thing at once.  So you could target folders that contain highly compressible files, such as documents, ahead of folders that contain files that do not compress well, such as images, audio, video, and compressed archives (zip etc).\n\nA: In case anyone who reads this wants to activate compression on a live, mounted btrfs filesystem without unmounting it, I just did the following and it seems to have worked:\n1)  Edit /etc/fstab to include compress=zstd in the options section of the line(s) for the filesystem(s).  (I am using zstd compression, you may prefer a different compression algorithm.)\n2)  Run mount -o remount /.  (Replace / with the mount point of your filesystem.  In my case, it was /.)\nNote:  I actually have two btrfs subvolumes (/ and /home) on the same device.  Compression appears to have been activated on both of them, even though I only ran mount -o remount / once.  I had added compress=zstd to both lines in /etc/fstab.\n", "Q: Update rate of `top` I've created the personal config file for top and I would like to change the update rate (the rate at which top updates data about the current processes). How do I do that?\n\nA: Your personal config file will probably be stored in your home directory and called .toprc (in the Nautilus file browser, you can press Ctrl+H or click View > Show  Hidden Files to show files that start with .). Assuming you have created it in the usual way (by pressing Shift+W while top is running), its contents will look something like this:\nRCfile for \"top with windows\"       # shameless braggin'\nId:a, Mode_altscr=0, Mode_irixps=1, Delay_time=3.000, Curwin=0\nDef    fieldscur=AEHIOQTWKNMbcdfgjplrsuvyzX\n       winflags=62777, sortindx=10, maxtasks=0\n       summclr=1, msgsclr=1, headclr=3, taskclr=1\nJob    fieldscur=ABcefgjlrstuvyzMKNHIWOPQDX\n       winflags=62777, sortindx=0, maxtasks=0\n       summclr=6, msgsclr=6, headclr=7, taskclr=6\nMem    fieldscur=ANOPQRSTUVbcdefgjlmyzWHIKX\n       winflags=62777, sortindx=13, maxtasks=0\n       summclr=5, msgsclr=5, headclr=4, taskclr=5\nUsr    fieldscur=ABDECGfhijlopqrstuvyzMKNWX\n       winflags=62777, sortindx=4, maxtasks=0\n       summclr=3, msgsclr=3, headclr=2, taskclr=3\n\nOn the second line change the number (of seconds) in Delay_time=3.000 to whatever you want it to be. For example, for very fast updating (which you should be aware will make top itself take up considerably more system resources), you could change it to Delay_time=0.250.

The problem is that I cannot have the data card attached to the machine while the machine boots up. If I leave the data card in the machine during startup, the data card is not picked up and I then cannot connect to the internet. \nI must first boot up my machine, login, attach the data card into the usb port, wait so 30 seconds. The broadband connection name will then appear in the network dropdown at the top of the screen. An internet connect is now possible via broadband.\nPlease let me know what must be done to fix this.\n\nA: OP Does not want solution\n\nSure thanks, I can live with it. As long as the users know and understand how it works. Its just the first thing I noticed after upgrading from the previous version. Also, the windows environments dont have this problem.\n\n\nA: Mobile broadband modems are not as well supported on Linux as Windows, it generally relates to incompatibility of the drivers and network manager detection issues.\nThe Ubuntu Wiki for 3G data cards is a useful resource for which cards work better than others and what steps/settings may need to be followed for getting them working.\nI also found a good question that may be of some help on the Unix & Linux StackExchange site that gives some detailed set up instructions to help cards get recognised and working.\n", "Q: Installation of 11.10 on new drive (no OS) I have a Dell Dimension 600 XPS Phoenix BIOS version A03, the original HD crashed and burned. Dell didn't send OS disks (was on the original drive and no back up disks), so I am trying to install Ubuntu 11.10 on the new drive. The new drive is a Western Digital 1TB. I formatted the new drive by putting it in an enclosure and formatting it with Windows 7 on my HP system.\nWhen I put the cd in the cdrom it boots to the cd with the Advanced user screen (won't boot into the usually Windows GUI). When I try to install (or run from live Cd) I get the same error message.\nSame with trying the various boot options.\nThe message is:\nVFS: cannot open root device \"(NULL)\" or unknown-block(8,1)\nPlease append a correct \"root=\" boot option: \nHere are the available partitions:\nKernal Panic- not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount rootfs on unknown-block(8,1)\n\nand then it lists Trace messages, then it freezes.\n\nA: I have this error myself. I have resolved it by creating a bootable flashdrive from the Ubuntu live cd and configured my laptop to boot off it. Seems to remove the error.\n\nA: You have a Dell desktop PC, and it has a new hard drive without Windows installed.\nYou can install Ubuntu 11.10, from either a CD or USB, and this will erase and re-format the hard drive (as part of the process).\nWhat 'Install CD' are you using, and why did you need to try \"formatting it with Windows 7\" first?\nAre you also trying to get Windows 7 back on your PC?\n\nA: If you want windows 7 back in your computer and want to dual boot with ubuntu than remember to install windows 7 first than only install ubuntu. Ubuntu will autodetect windows and do the grub setting to dual boot automatically.\n\nA: I find it useful to install live CDs to USB flash drives instead of CDs. Optical disks tend to get damaged with time and this may result in failed installations/file system mounts. Moreover, writing to a USB drive takes much less effort and money - no wasted CDs, simply write, install and format the drive to make it usable again (the simplest way).\nThe one liveCD that I have is actually not working on my computer because the optical disk drive is no longer able to recognise any disks. This is one more reason to use USBs rather than CDs because not only do the disks get damaged, but also disk drives reach the end of their lifespan one day while you can still use, in most cases, more than 2 USB ports on your computer.\n\nA: Did you MD5 test the downloaded .iso image and verify the installation media when booting it? If not, you should do that now. if the MD5 test fails, download a new .iso. If that shows no errors but \"Check disc for defects\" shows errors (or fails to run at all), then burn a new disc. Also, it's best to burn installation CD's at the slowest supported speed--sometimes that avoids errors.\nMaybe these suggestions will fix your problem. If not, you can provide the requested information (i.e., what happened when you MD5 tested the .iso and checked the installation media for defects) by editing your question.\n", "Q: Where is \"Super\" key for Ubuntu running on Mac OS X with Vmware Fusion Host OS: Mac OS X Lion\nGuest OS: Ubuntu 11.10\nVirtualization: Vmware Fusion\nI am the type of person that relies heavily on shortcuts.

At first, I thought the apple/command key would be mapped to the \"Super\" key in Ubuntu by default, but it didn't work like that. How can I make \"Super\" key available to my setup? Thanks.\nBelow are shortcuts that involved the \"Super\" key. I have labelled the ones that didn't work for me.\nLauncher\n\n\n*\n\n*Hold Super - Invoke the Launcher.\n\n*Hold Super, then 1 or 2 or 3 and so on until 0 - Open or\nfocus an application. The number corresponds to the location of the\nicon on the launcher from top to bottom.\n\n*\n\n*Adding Shift will open a new instance of the application if it's\nalready open. \n\n*Holding the key is also useful when you want to get to\nthe Launcher but do not want to invoke the Dash.\n\n\n*Super-T - Open the rubbish bin/trash can.\n\n\nDash\n\n\n*\n\n*Tap Super - Opens the Dash. The open signal is sent when you let go\nof the key, not when you push it down, so if it feels slow just let\ngo of the key earlier.\n\n*(not working)Tab - 11.10+ only - Move to the next lens (When the dash is open)\n\n*(not working)Shift-Tab - 11.10+ only - Move to the previous lens (when the dash is\nopen)\n\n*(not working)Super - A Open Applications lens\n\n*(not working)Super - F - Open Files & Folders lens\n\n*(not working)Super - M (11.10+ only) - Open the music lens\n\n\nWindow Management\n\n\n*\n\n*(not working)Super - W - Spread mode, zoom out on all windows in all\nworkspaces.\n\n*(not working)Super - D - Minimize all windows; hitting it again restores them.\nWorkspace Management\n\n\n*\n\n*(not working)Super - S - Expo mode (for everything), zooms out on all the\nworkspaces and lets you manage windows.\n\n\nA: If you Ubuntu will interpret the Windows/Start Menu key as the Super key then you can map it from the Keyboard & Mouse dialog in Fusion. From the VMware Fusion menu, select Preferences then go to the Keyboard & Mouse tab. From there you can add and delete keyboard mappings.\nIf the problem is that Ubuntu isn't interpreting the Windows key correctly, you should use the xmodmap command in a X startup file.

Looks like a file was deleted or corrupted.  I was unable to get it to work.  Realising it was a boot issue, I took the CD and installed 9.04 to co-exist with 9.10 on the disc.  9.04 was put into a 2.5 gb ext3 partition.  I was able to boot into 9.10 from grub menu selection.  9.04 was now the default in grub menu.\nI want to remove/delete/purge 9.04 completely from my system and \"clean up\" the stuff so that the machine boots straight to 9.10 (no grub menu).\nI haven't tried to delete partition yet as I'm uncertain of the possible outcome.

Is there a good reason you're not upgrading to something that is still officially supported?  Neither 9.04 or 9.10 is so you're not getting security updates.\nIf there isn't a good reason, I would suggest a clean install of a supported version. Newer the better but 10.04 will be supported for a while still if you're determined to run something old. Assuming you have data you want to save, here's what I would do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Back up. I'm not going to labour the point but nobody likes data loss.\n\n*Boot into your LiveCD.\n\n*Using gparted, create a new partition and copy any data you want to keep safe there from your other partitions. This will probably include portions of /home amongst other stuff, depending on what you use the box for.\n\n*Nuke your existing install partitions, leaving the newest partition we just copied data to.\n\n*Load the installer, do a nice fresh install. When you reboot into the new install you can copy back all your old data.\n\n\nI'm really just thinking about time. Accurately fixing things by strategically removing partitions isn't guaranteed to fix your problem and you'll still be on 9.10.\nDownloading/burning a new ISO, backing up files and doing the fresh install doesn't take that long and you can be doing other things while they progress. And you end up with a nice fresh install of something new.\n\nA: You can boot into 9.10 and then remove the partition created using Gparted or another program, and run the grub configuration manually while in 9.10 (I would assume it safe this way after 'scanning' through this page: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2)\n", "Q: Can't recognize the microphone on an Hp Pavilion dv 2000la I was trying to have a conversation via skype this morning, when surprise there was no sound; so i opened sound settings to see what could i do about it, and i found this \nand the mic wasn't responding to any sound but instead to some hits on the laptop just at the left side of the track pad(where is located the hard drive), so i opened the laptop to see if there was something wrong with the cable or the conector but everithing was just fine.\nthen, I use a pen drive with ubuntu 11.10 to launch sound setting from the gui of the installer to verify that ther was nothing wrong with he hardware but with the software instead; I opened sound setting from the installer first screen, and the mic was working fine. \nSo i suppose that i have a problem with the analog input and the internal mic, I suppose that ubuntu is taking both options as if I were choosing always internal input; that's my theory, the questions are how do i solve it?, how do i reinstall the mic software that is causing the problem? because i don't want to install ubuntu all over again just by a not recognized mic.\nHere some technical info as requested below:\nI'm using a Hp pavilion dv 2000la, and ubuntu 11.10 (Oneiric)\nRunning lspci -nn:\n00:00.0 Host bridge [0600]: Intel Corporation Mobile 945GM/PM/GMS, 943/940GML and 945GT Express Memory Controller Hub [8086:27a0] (rev 03)\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: Intel Corporation Mobile 945GM/GMS, 943/940GML Express Integrated Graphics Controller [8086:27a2] (rev 03)\n00:02.1 Display controller [0380]: Intel Corporation Mobile 945GM/GMS/GME, 943/940GML Express Integrated Graphics Controller [8086:27a6] (rev 03)\n00:1b.0 Audio device [0403]: Intel Corporation N10/ICH 7 Family High Definition Audio Controller [8086:27d8] (rev 02)\n00:1c.0 PCI bridge [0604]: Intel Corporation N10/ICH 7 Family PCI Express Port 1 [8086:27d0] (rev 02)\n00:1c.2 PCI bridge [0604]: Intel Corporation N10/ICH 7 Family PCI Express Port 3 [8086:27d4] (rev 02)\n00:1c.3 PCI bridge [0604]: Intel Corporation N10/ICH 7 Family PCI Express Port 4 [8086:27d6] (rev 02)\n00:1d.0 USB Controller [0c03]: Intel Corporation N10/ICH 7 Family USB UHCI Controller #1 [8086:27c8] (rev 02)\n00:1d.1 USB Controller [0c03]: Intel Corporation N10/ICH 7 Family USB UHCI Controller #2 [8086:27c9] (rev 02)\n00:1d.2 USB Controller [0c03]: Intel Corporation N10/ICH 7 Family USB UHCI Controller #3 [8086:27ca] (rev 02)\n00:1d.3 USB Controller [0c03]: Intel Corporation N10/ICH 7 Family USB UHCI Controller #4 [8086:27cb] (rev 02)\n00:1d.7 USB Controller [0c03]: Intel Corporation N10/ICH 7 Family USB2 EHCI Controller [8086:27cc] (rev 02)\n00:1e.0 PCI bridge [0604]: Intel Corporation 82801 Mobile PCI Bridge [8086:2448] (rev e2)\n00:1f.0 ISA bridge [0601]: Intel Corporation 82801GBM (ICH7-M) LPC Interface Bridge [8086:27b9] (rev 02)\n00:1f.1 IDE interface [0101]: Intel Corporation 82801G (ICH7 Family) IDE Controller [8086:27df] (rev 02)\n00:1f.2 SATA controller [0106]: Intel Corporation 82801GBM/GHM (ICH7 Family) SATA AHCI Controller [8086:27c5] (rev 02)\n00:1f.3 SMBus [0c05]: Intel Corporation N10/ICH 7 Family SMBus Controller [8086:27da] (rev 02)\n05:00.0 Network controller [0280]: Broadcom Corporation BCM4311 802.11b/g WLAN [14e4:4311] (rev 02)\n08:08.0 Ethernet controller [0200]: Intel Corporation PRO/100 VE Network Connection [8086:1092] (rev 02)\n08:09.0 FireWire (IEEE 1394) [0c00]: Ricoh Co Ltd R5C832 IEEE 1394 Controller [1180:0832]\n08:09.1 SD Host controller [0805]: Ricoh Co Ltd R5C822 SD/SDIO/MMC/MS/MSPro Host Adapter [1180:0822] (rev 19)\n08:09.2 System peripheral [0880]: Ricoh Co Ltd R5C592 Memory Stick Bus Host Adapter [1180:0592] (rev 0a)\n08:09.3 System peripheral [0880]: Ricoh Co Ltd xD-Picture Card Controller [1180:0852] (rev 05) \n\nHere are the codecs foud in /proc/asound/card0 and /proc/asound/intel: Codecs card0 and intel\nthanks a lot for your answers, i apologize english is not my first language.\nGOD bless you guys\n\nA: Here is how I fixed non-working microphone on my HP Pavillion tx1000:\nOpen alsamixer by typing in terminal window:\nalsamixer\n\nIf you have a built-in sound card and microphone, you'll see it listed in the upper left corner.

I would like to permanently check \"Enable mobile broadband\" so I don't have to check it after every boot. \n\n\nA: I have another easy solution for this if anybody out there is still looking for it.\nIn most of the cases, the mobile broadband connection, for example from above question \"Airtel connection\" is set to connect automatically.\nSo the only thing left to do is check \"Enable Mobile Broadband\" to make it connect. But we usually have to do it manually after every boot. \nFor this, we add a command to work at startup:\nIn a terminal,\nsudo gedit /etc/rc.local\n\nNow add this line above exit 0\n(while :; do nmcli -t nm wwan on; sleep 1; done)&\n\nSave the file and exit.\nThats it.. \nThis not only starts up the connection but if connection drops, it reconnects\n\nA: The above response by @SriramKannan works perfectly.

I have a Lenovo E520-1143.\nAt the moment I have Windows 7 Professional 64bit installed. Is it possible to install Ubuntu 11.10 in my laptop? If I installed Ubuntu 11.10 will the devices such as Audio,Display, Bluetooth, LAN, wan, fingerprint, etc. works for me? \nIf I install Ubuntu will it detected all devices?\n\nA: If you are using Ubuntu for the first time, you are advised to experience Ubuntu through Live CD or Bootable USB disks. You can download and create these from Ubuntu website. Insert the CD/USB and boot from it. By default certain codecs such as for video, audio flash etc are not shipped with Ubuntu. Still you can experience all other applications and everything. Take it from me, if you are pretty satisfied in overall experience from Live CD/USB, you do not need to bother about audio and video. If you want to install Ubuntu, you can do it along with the Current Windows 7. It is not a hectic thing to install Ubuntu since it is designed in such a way that a basic computer literate can install Ubuntu. Follow on screen instructions and you can make it. Once installation is complete, open Ubuntu software centre and serach for Ubuntu Restricted extras. It is around 100 MB file containing codec for audio video flash java etc. For better video experience you can even try VLC player. That's it. This all you need to run a fully loaded Ubuntu on your lap/desktop.\nPlease revert for any clarifications.\n\nA: About 2 months ago I purchased a Lenovo E420 with the sole intention of using it as my Ubuntu machine (well, dual-booted, really). It is very nearly identical to the E520 except for size. \nI booted from my Live CD,partitioned 75% of my HD to be used for Ubuntu 11.11, and voila; the installation was a breeze. Everything works wonderfully. If anything, be sure you look into the usual tweaks and software to ensure you get decent battery life (e.g. laptop-mode / powertop). Compared to running Win7, my Ubuntu gets about 70% battery life when compared. \nAll of my hardware was recognized. The only thing I can't vouche for here would be the fingerprint reader, because my E420 doesn't have one. \nHopefully this helps.\n\nA: Please try first the live cd. Thats a first indication how your hardware deals with Ubuntu.\n\nA: I have installed ubuntu 11.10 (64bit) on my lenovo G560 (Intel Core i3, 3GB RAM, Intel HD Graphics, 350 GB Hard disk) I didn't face any problem related to any hardware detection. Ubuntu detected all the hardware. I don't have figure print hardware on my system, So not sure about that. Many people faced problems related to WiFi connectivity on some Lenovo systems but there are solutions for that also. Also you can try it with Ubuntu Live CD on your system and see how things go.\n", "Q: Which programming language suits a system that must work without user input I'm building a prototype of a device that will function much alike a digital photoframe. It will display images retrieved from the internet. The device must start up and run the photoframe. It will have no user interface.\nThe device has a minimal ubuntu installation, but I could install Xorg or whatever needed.\nQuestion:\nI have trouble figuring out which programming language will be suitable. I've just started using Python to try out several things and I am able to download and display images. I guess that means Python can do what I'd like, but is it suitable as a language that will be run on boot without any user interference?\nRelated questions:\n - How do I set up Linux to start that script automatically?\n - How to setup a second Python script as a server that runs in the background to retrieve images before they are displayed (Because I think I'll need threading of some sort?)\n\nA: Any programming language is suitable to run without user input.\nPython for sure is. There are quite a lot of servers running out there writen in python, and I wrote some scripts like this for work in python and they are working quite nice.\nIn my experience the most important issue is to catch all exceptions, so that the thing keeps running even when something unexpected happens. I even sometime run some code inside a try catching every exception and forwarding the error to a log file, to keep the thing running (this could be sane or crazy, depending on what is the program supposed to do).\n\nA: Python will work for your use case. If the runtime is installed (in the case of Python it is by default, same as in C), you'll be able to run programs for each programming language where you've got a runtime on the system.\nIn terms of starting the program automatically, you might want to consider running a daemon. In that case, the python-daemon package (install link) is your friend. Here is some more info on the additional scripts you'll need to automatically start and stop it.\n", "Q: Commandline email to internal web mail server I have a few number of ubuntu pcs, whom I want to mail me some kind of log on daily basis. The problem is that these pcs have access only to the internal webmail (of my campus) and all I can find on google is info regarding sending mails to gmail accounts.\nPlease help me solve this problem.\n\nA: If your log uses syslog or rsyslogd, you could use \"remote logging\", and skip all the emails. Install the rsyslog-doc package, and look at file:///usr/share/doc/rsyslog-doc/html/rsyslog_reliable_forwarding.html\n\nA: With the heirloom-mailx  package installed, you get some SMTP-related options that aren't available with the \"plain\" bsd-mailx. The mailx application provided by heirloom-mailx can be instructed not to contact a local sendmail but a remote SMTP host. \nIf this works for you, you can put the set smtp=smtp.xyz.tld and other commands (e.g. authentication) into a ~/.mailrc or the /etc/mail.rc file to maintain the options at a central point.\n", "Q: 'Find in files' from nautilus's context menu?

Bad communication with access point I installed Ubuntu 11.10 on HP 530 and to make Wireless work installed STA driver from jockey (obviously proprietary) and, since it didn't work also installed their driver from HP website via ndiswrapper.\nAfter this (and a reboot) I see the WiFi indicator glowing, like it should be, and I am able to find local access points. But when I try to connect to mine personal one with WPA 2 security (with password) it hangs at authentification (I'm using wicd to manage wifi), and after a minute or so (I guess timeout of request happens) it says I have a wrong password (it is 100% correct). What might be the problem here?\nYesterday I was able to connect to access point by changing type of encryption from passphrase to preshared key but didn't have internet access. Now, after reboot, I can't connect there again.\n\nA: I had the same problem with Natty and that was just a dhcp problem.\nA static ip adress fix the problem in my case.\nHope that will be helpful for someone ...\n", "Q: How do I get SSH to listen on a new IP without restarting the machine? I have a few Ubuntu server boxes set up on ESX, and I changed the IP addresses via SSH. The moment I changed it, it dropped me off of SSH (as expected).\nAfter a restart it works 100% as expected and I can SSH in on the new IP.\nHowever, as much as this works and I know it is a solution, I am trying to learn Linux and would like to restart/bind SSH to the new IP without restarting.\nI have attempted /etc/init.d/ssh restart (and stop then start), and services ssh restart (and stop then start), but, nothing seems to work.\nHowever, the weird thing is that from my other server (running on the same ESX box) I can SSH in on the new IP, but, I just can't seem to SSH in from anywhere else until the box is restarted.\nI can't work out what I am doing wrong.\nHas anyone seen this or can they offer any advice?\n(if it changes anything, the IPs I was moving from/to are all internet/public directly routed IPs)\n\nA: I have a hunch this is related to ARP, which can be sometimes funky with virtual machines. From another virtual server on the same box, you can connect, as you're not going through the switch.\nTo test this, first try clearing the ARP tables on the machine from which you're trying (and failing) to connect:\nsudo arp -d <ip-of-failing-virtual-machine>\n\nIf that doesn't help, try resetting the ARP table on your switch (one easy way to do it: reset the switch :)\n\nA: It the configuration of openssh-server is untouched (the default one) then you don't even need to restart ssh in order for him to listen onto the new IP you set.\nYour trouble is likely to be the way you change your IP.\nI don't know how you do it so I'll cover all cases\nI advise you to not use the GUI : network-manager. It's very poor in functionality and does not fit your need for remote changes. (any graphical interface is quite a bad idea on a server because it adds you potential risks and consume constantly resources for 5 minutes of use)\nMy advice would be to edit /etc/network/interface\nSee this help : Network Configuration on Ubuntu 11.10 and most importantly the \"IP Addressing\" part.\nBe sure to not use the hotplug statement witch can leads you in trouble.\nchanging the IP with ifconfig is a bad idea : it's temporary and it do directly the change so you can't set/unset other network settings\nNow the real trick :\n(ifconfig aside) : The very act of changing the same IP of your SSH session is in fact two procedures for Ubuntu : Stop the interface and then Start the interface.\nSo what you use is a script, and when the interface stops your ssh session closed .... and so your script. So your interface never start again.\nin order to avoid your script being closed you must the script in background :\nsudo -i\nnohup service networking restart &\n\nIt'll send your script to the background and so it'll not be closed when your ssh session close.\nYou'll loose then your ssh session, but you'll be able to connect again into your server\nwithout restarting. (leave it a little time if you are defining a new dhcp ip or if it's wifi)\nIf this doesn't work for you please give us more details on how you proceed.\nBest regards.\n\nA: When you change your ip address, do you add the default route? Seems to me like because you didn't add the default route, the computer is unable to access, and be accessed from, outside. Lets say you changed your ip address so, as root:\nip addr del <old ip/netmask> iface\nip addr add <new ip/netmask> iface\n\nAfter you do this, you need to add the default route, which, if not done, won't let your server connect to the internet. To be accessible outside, the default route needs to be added:\nroute add default gw <gateway ip address>\n\nHope that solves the problem.\n\nA: Do your iptables rules prohibit any incoming connections to any IP other than your own?

When I purchased the full version it looked like it was not working. Click to start nothing happens, but because I have Indicator-multiload always running I noticed my cpu usage increasing as I would expect it to with running the game.\nOpening system monitor revealed that it was a running process.\nBelow I am pasting my correspondence with Canonical isd-support\nEmail 1\n\n\nI purchased Chainz Galaxy from USC after successfully playing the Demo, however the full version does not seem to work.\nWhen starting the game nothing appears to happen but it does show up in system monitor and has to be killed from there.\nI would prefer to play the game than have a refund but if that is not possible can I please have a refund\n    I have pasted my receipt below, If you require any further information please ask\n\n\nE-mail 2\n\n\nIn an effort to get this working I have tried a few things, and now seem to be able to get the game working (though not how it is supposed to)\nI un-installed  the game and deleted the save file .Chainz Galaxy from the home folder, then re-installed the game.\nWhen starting the game it still did not appear however I was able to get to it via Alt&Tab. This however only worked twice.\n    On the 3rd attempt the game was not showing in the Alt&Tab menu though the game was showing as running in the system monitor.\nAlso on this attempt the Unity interface went haywire, the lense would not show and all the icons in the launcher became squashed so I killed the game from system monitor then logged out and back in again.\nSeeing as Unity went funny I turned off wobbly windows as I am aware that many compiz affects do not work well with Unity and it was the only affect I was using.\nOnce again I was able to get into the game via Alt&Tab but once again not with every attempt and having to go into system monitor to kill the process. This time it did not affect Unity\nNext, once I got the game up again I switched off full screen mode from the games options menu. Now it appears consistent and I am able to get to the game at every attempt via Alt&Tab only.\nI realise that this may lead you to believe that I have insufficient system requirements so i have listed my system below.\nI also must stress that no problems exist with the demo version\nOS: Ubuntu 11.10 32 bit\nMemory: 3.0 GiB\nProcessor: AMD Athlon(tm) 64 X2 Dual Core Processor 6000+ Ã 2\nGraphics: GeForce 9300 GE/PCI/SSE2/3DNOW!\n\n\nTo summarise: I can now run the game with no issues by ensuring that it does not start in full screen and to use Alt & Tab to bring it on screen\nI realise that this different from your problem, but it may help others who navigate to here experiencing problems.\n", "Q: Thomson TG782T ADSL2+ modem loses network connection I am using an ubuntu 10.04 server (running on a Lenovo Thinkpad notebook) as my webserver.

Hello i wanted to know how can get Ubuntu source code and compile it on my own .\nBasically i wanted to give it a try so can some one help me regarding the steps to compile a full Ubuntu system .\nAlso would this be beneficial as compared to installing from per-compiled binary?\n\nA: There would be little benefit compiling from source. If you are dead set on this then you would probably be better switching do a Linux distribution that is aimed at this sort of user, such as Gentoo. This is designed around the user compiling from source and therefore would suit you better.\nUbuntu is simply a collection of open source tools put together in a way that makes it a good OS for people to use. It is not a single piece of software to be compiled. If you wanted to compile an Ubuntu system from source code you would have to discover all the pieces of software (Kernel, X windows, all other software on top of that) that Ubuntu uses and compile it yourself. Then add all the package management software such as apt on top as well.\nUnless there is a good reason to attempt this, I wouldn't bother. As I said before, switch to Gentoo if you want to compile everything yourself, Ubuntu wouldn't be the first choice.\n", "Q: Where have the 9.10 CD images gone?

I've set up a virtual machine configured with bridge networking. After making eight clones of it, the new machines can't connect to the network.\nI've instructed VirtualBox to re-generate the machines' mac-addresses.\n\nA: Refresh your MAC address using Virtual Box machine settings and \nremove the kernelâs networking interface rules file so that it can be regenerated:\nsudo rm -f /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules\nsudo reboot\n\nIt will work for your clone VM.\n\nA: I was dealing with the same problem for months and today I decided I would find a better fix.  Here is what I did on the machine I was using as a Template.\nFor good administration practices back up both files before editing.\nYou have two offending/target files:\n\n\n*\n\n*/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0\n\n*/etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules\nThis will work for a static or dhcp address:\nOpen /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 \nDelete the MAC Address line:  HWADDR=XX:11:22:XX:33:XX\nSave the file.\nDelete the file /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules \"it will be recreated after you restart the VM\"  \nsudo rm -f /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules\n\nYou can now clone your box and every clone will correctly deploy and display eth0.\nIf you do not use a template, you may complete these procedures on the actual VM just remember to re-initialize the NIC your in the VM software before you restart the machine.\n\nA: There are udev rules preventing the new interface from being brought up.\nIn the Master machine, just delete them before you clone the new machines:\nsudo rm -f /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules\n\n(source)\n\nA: I encountered the same problem on a previous version of VirtualBox and I read somewhere that there was a bug which rendered the \"generate new MAC address\" tick box useless.\nI'm now using Ubuntu 12.04 with VirtualBox 4.2.10. I noticed now that when I created the clone, there was no tick box to \"generate new MAC address.\"\nThis gave me some problems even if I deleted 70-persistent-net.rules because the system would automatically generate the file on startup with the same MAC address as the original, which made it fail to connect.\nBut I discovered that in VirtualBox Manager, you can select the clone, go to Settings>Networking>Advanced and generate a new MAC address by ticking the box.\nSo what I did was to delete 70-persistent-net.rules first, shut down, generate new MAC address and start again, and now it works.\nAlternatively, you can delete the file first before you clone. Then generate MAC address, then start the clone. That ought to work as well.\n\nA: I am building parallel computing environment that needs interconnection between the virtual machine through ip network.\nI think there is something related to the re-generate the machines' mac-addresses.\nI had faced the similar problem before.\nThe original virtual machine has eth0 and eth1. But due to the regenerating process,\nin my case, the new cloned machine has eth2 and eth3. you can check it by this following command:\nifconfig -a | grep eth\n\nYou can check with ifconfig command that in the new cloned machine has only lo registered. Generally, you should have lo, eth0, and eth1 when you type ifconfig command.\nThat is due to MAC regeneration that in the clone machine, there are eth2 and eth3 Ethernet interfaces instead of eth0 and eth1 in the original machine. You can also check the /etc/network/interfaces in the original machine that in my case will appears like:\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet dhcp\n\nauto eth1\niface eth1 inet static\n\naddress 192.168.xxx.xxx\nnetmask 255.xxx.xxx.0\nnetwork 192.168.xxx.0\nbroadcast 192.168.xxx.255\ngateway 10.0.x.xx\n\nMay be you can modify your /etc/network/interfaces file and change the eth0 and eth1 with eth2 and eth3, which more or less like this:\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\nauto eth2\niface eth2 inet dhcp\n\nauto eth3\niface eth3 inet static\n\naddress 192.168.xxx.xxx\nnetmask 255.xxx.xxx.0\nnetwork 192.168.xxx.0\nbroadcast 192.168.xxx.255\ngateway 10.0.x.xx\n\nSo, good luck guys!\n\nA: I deleted 70-persitent-net.rules file but it wasn't re-created after reboot. Then, re-installing guest additions module and rebooting the VM worked for me.\n\nA: I have problem with same ip-address after cloning 3 VMs with Virtual BOX (4.3). SO I have power off the machines and regenerated new mac address and restarted it worked for me.\nsteps => switch off the cloned VM and then settings => network => advanced => click on refresh MAC address => clik OK. then start VM.\n\nA: I was facing the same issue after cloning ubuntu-server-20.x image. I was using nat-service. What worked for me was the following.\n\n*\n\n*Refresh the mac by going to network setting (small refresh icon next to mac address).\n\n*On guest machine, run the following two commands to force refresh ip address from DHCP server.\n\nsudo dhclient -r eth0\nsudo dhclient eth0\n\n", "Q: Dell Studio 1558 shutting down due to over heating My system (DELL Studio 1558) gets shut down while using GNOME Shell on Ubuntu 11.10 without any message, because the system over-heats.

It's been defective from day one and Dell's solution is to update the BIOS. Mine is up to date (A12) and it still randomly shuts off with and without the AC plugged in!  And yes, it is due to overheating.  Someone, who still has a Dell warranty managed to get theirs fixed through Dell and they replaced the entire Motherboard for him.

And upto 11.04 I used my same USB 3G dongle to connect to broadband and it worked fine. But 2 days ago I upgraded to Ubuntu 11.10 and broadband is not working. It detects my dongle and creates a connection without a problem, but when connecting it just keeps on and on for a long time and then say I'm offline. So I did a clean install and the same thing occurred.\nBut I also have a netbook and its got Ubuntu 11.10. I tried using the same dongle for internet on that netbook and it worked fine without any issues. But this isn't a problem with my USB port on my main machine or something like that because I'm also using Windows on my main machine (dual-boot) and its working fine.\nMy hardware:\n\n\n*\n\n*Main computer (one that I'm trying to connect):\n\n\n*\n\n*2.8GHz dual core Intel\n\n*2GB RAM\n\n*500GB Sata II HDD\n\n*384MB Video Memory (Intel G31/G33 chipset)\n\n*Ubuntu 11.10 (32bit)\n\n\n*My NetBook (broadband working fine):\n\n\n*\n\n*1.6GHz Intel Atom (dual core)\n\n*1GB DDR3 RAM\n\n*250GB HDD\n\n*128MB Video Memory (Intel something-I-can't-remember)\n\n*Ubuntu 11.10 (32bit)\n\n\n\nMy dongle is a Huawei E220 and ISP is Dialog GSM (I'm in Sri Lanka)\nSo any idea why this is? I really love Ubuntu and this is bugging me off.. Any help greatly appreciated.\nRegards,\nRoshnal\n\nA: I was experiencing this problem for my E220 on Ubuntu 11.10 and 12.04 as well. It works sometimes and sometimes the \"just keeps on and on for a long time and then say I'm offline\" thing happens. So to connect I have to do things like unplugging and re plugging the dongle, restarting the machine etc. \nBut now Huawei offers a Linux version of its Mobile Partner software. I found this software with a new E303 which I bought from Mobitel. I installed this software on my computer and this Mobile Partner detects the E220 dongle as well. It works fine and even allows SMS and all the data monitoring facilities.\nSo, my suggestion to you is to install the Linux version of Mobile Partner which comes with new dongles. Please be careful about the Linux versions of the Mobile Partner which are available online. Some people have complained that the installation changed their configuration files and couldn't connect to internet afterwords.  So use the software which comes in a new dongle.\n\nA: I solved this problem but not so elegantly. \nIn Disc utility, I unmounted and safely disassembled the unit CD Huawei. One minute after that, the 3G modem is recognized properly.\nIt works for me. I think the problem is the CD-Huawei and not the USB mass storage.\nI have Ubuntu 12.04 and Huawei E156G (I think this is like E220).\n\nA: It seems to be a bug for sure. You can try the workarounds given here - https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/network-manager/+bug/868034\n\nA: As @Shrijt has said, it was a bug and I found a temporary solution in the link he provided.\nExecute the below line on the terminal:\nsudo usb_modeswitch -v 0x12d1 -p 1003 -V 0x12d1 -P 1003 -R\n\nAnd then unplug and replug the dongle. It will work until next restart.\nBut as all the posters on the Ubuntu Bug forum has said, no clear permanent fix have yet been made.\nSome users have suggested to replace the USB dongle-handling packages of Ocelot with those of Natty. Don't know if it will work. I'll get back here as soon as I find a fix. \n", "Q: How to convert a .pdf file into a folder of images? I have some .pdf files that I would like to convert to my preferred reading format of .cbr or .cbz  or, if this isn't directly possible, I need to extract all pages from the .pdf as images and then compress them into my format of choice.  I have only been able to save pages one at a time with Document Viewer.  Obviously, I'd like to do it a little quicker. I have tried pdfsam, pdf shuffler, and pdfmod all with no luck. I am using Ubuntu 11.10.\n\nA: I'm not very familiar with *.cbr / *.cbz, but it seems you'll have to combine two steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Convert PDF to Images\n\n*Compress them into a ZIP / RAR archive.\n\n\nRegarding step 1, you could use ImageMagick's convert command. You can feed convert with a PDf comprising multiple pages, and convert will return each page as single graphics file. I've tested it with a text scanned at 400 dpi, and the following command resulted in nice single JPGEs:\n$ convert -verbose -colorspace RGB -interlace none -density 400 -quality 100 yourPdfFile.pdf 00%d.jpeg\n\n(credits regarding the -quality option: this forum entry)\nAs a result, you get 000.jpeg, 001.jpeg and so on. Just zip them into a .cbz file, and you're done.\nYou could even combine both steps by \"concatenating\" them:\n$ convert -verbose -colorspace RGB -interlace none -density 400 -quality 100 yourPdfFile.pdf 00%d.jpg && zip -vm comic.cbz *.jpg\n\n(make sure that there aren't any other JPEGs in your current working directory, since using the code above, zip will move all JPEGs into the cbz file)\n\nA: I have written a simple bash script for exactly this purpose, you will need poppler installed, so:\nsudo apt-get install poppler-utils #ubuntu\nbrew install poppler # mac\n\nHere is the bash script (save it as convert_to_cbz.sh):\nfilename=\"${1%.*}\"\necho \"Converting $filename to cbz\"\nmkdir \"./$filename\"\npdftoppm -jpeg \"$1\" \"./$filename/000\"\nzip -r9 \"${filename}.cbz\" \"./$filename\" \nrm -rf \"./$filename\"\n\nTo use the bash script:\nchmod +x convert_to_cbz.sh\n./convert_to_cbz.sh \"Nintendo Official Magazine 066 (OldGameMags).pdf\"\n\nHopefully this will be useful for someone!\n\nA: Try using calibre to directly convert the .pdf to .cbr or .cbz.\n\nA: OK well, I did some more research and although tohuwawohu's method does work, I found it easier to use a program called pdftoppm to achieve what I wanted done. Since I am pretty much a layperson when it comes to using command line apps, I will do my best to explain how I got this to work for me.\n\n\n*\n\n*Navigate to the folder containing the .pdf you wish to edit and open a terminal there. I did this by using the sample command:\ncd ~/Documents/PDF\n\n\n*Let's say the file I want to edit is called Sample.pdf  What I want to do is use pdftoppm to create image files of each page of the .pdf.  Several formats can be chosen (see the man pages link above) but I prefer to use .png.  The basic command looks like this:\npdftoppm -FORMAT FILENAME.pdf PREFIX\n\nor in the example above:\npdftoppm -png Sample.pdf Sample\n\nThis command creates an image file of each page in the same folder as the original .pdf file with names like Sample-01.png, Sample-02.png and so on.  I have tried it with the .png and .jpeg extensions successfully. .jpg is apparently not supported.\n\n*Then I just use Archive Manager by selecting all the newly-created image files, right-clicking, and choosing \"Compress\" from the context menu.  I then choose the archive format I prefer (in this case .cbz or Comic Book Zip) and create the new archive.  \n\n*Now I have a shiny new .cbz file called Sample.cbz which I can then view with my Comix reader!\nHopefully what I have posted above makes enough sense that someone else can learn from it. If I need to change it in any way please let me know.\n\nA: It seems that the easiest way is using Acrobat Pro.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the PDf in Acrobat Pro.\n\n*Once the file is opened, go to File â Export â Image â JPEG, it will export each page as a single JPG.\n\n*Place all the JPGs in a folder\n\n*Zip the folder.\n\n*Manually change the extension at the end of the zipped file from .zip to .cbz\nIf you prefer a CBR file, rar the folder instead of zipping it, then change the extension from .rar to .cbr.\n", "Q: What is the mount point for an FTP server opened in nautilus?

I updated a broken Ubuntu installation to Oneiric from the live CD a while ago, and everything appeared to be working fine. Because I don't use the affected PC (it's mainly for my family), I booted it back into Windows after trying out 11.10. However, during the upgrade, I checked the \"install bootloader\" option for some reason, even though GRUB was already installed. Before the upgrade, I had configured the system startup to load the Windows bootloader first, which would display the options \"Microsoft Windows\" and \"Ubuntu\". Choosing \"Ubuntu\" would obviously load GRUB, which would show all of the installed Linux distributions as well as an option to reload the Windows loader, located at the bottom of the list. However, after I upgraded, GRUB was default due to the reinstall. This wasn't a major problem, as I could always set the Windows BL as default, or just set GRUB to highlight the Windows loader option by default.\nAnyway, to the real issue: at boot, the system drops to a GRUB rescue TTY, giving the error \"unknown filesystem\". Because I saw a shell that I'm not really familiar with, I typed some common Unix commands to see what kind of environment I was in. My first command was ls, and it worked; it showed a list of filesystems. It output: (hd0) (hd0,msdos3) (hd0,msdos2) (hd0,msdos1).\nI'm not sure what to do from here. I'm assuming I should boot into a live environment and do some common disk operations. Should I run fsck? If all is well or repairs succeed, should I update the GRUB configuration? How so? If all is not well, what then?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Maybe the boot repair tool will help (see also this and this answer).

What is the best Ubuntu version if I want to enable effects in Compiz (like wobbling windows)?\nI am not an advanced Linux user, but I have used Fedora, so I have a bit of experience. I no longer use Windows, unless I am using FruityLoops.\n\nA: There are multiple drivers for ATI/AMD Radeon graphics cards, a proprietary one and a free, open-source one.\nThe free open-source driver is contained in the xserver-xorg-video-radeon package.\nThe proprietary driver is provided by the fglrx package.\n\nA: Compiz used to support the 7500 up to 0.8.6 (which was the version in ubuntu Maverick iir). The 0.9 branch (rewrite) of Compiz blacklisted the 7500 in 0.9.2 (the ubuntu Natty version) and completely fails to support it in 0.9.6 (the version in Oneiric). \nSo you're stuck. Either go back to Lucid / Maverick, or abandon Compiz and use KWin or something similar.

You can use it to boot real machines or as a vm disk.\nHope it helps.\n", "Q: After upgrade my webcam mic records fast, high pitched, and squeaky only in Skype (maybe Sound Recorder problem too) After an upgrade to 11.10 (kernel: Linux lucid 3.0.0-13-generic #22-Ubuntu) which probably also updated Skype to 2.2.35 (not sure because I never checked the version before) the sound that comes back from an echo test is very high pitched and squeaky.

I tried to find in some articles describing how to correctly start & stop mysql server.\nI found this link: How to start/stop MySql server on Ubuntu 8.04 | Abhi's Blogging World\nI ran this command:\n/etc/init.d/mysql start \n\nbut I see this error \nERROR 1045 (28000) Access denied for user....\n\nAfter I tried this command:\nsudo /etc/init.d/mysql start\n\nI entered my password, and again I see the same error.\nNext command:\nsudo /etc/init.d/mysql - root -p start\n\nresults in:\nERROR 1049 (42000) Unknown database 'start'.\n\nAnd when I run this command: \nsudo service mysql start\n\nMySQL server success started. Cool! \nSo, what's wrong with the other commands? Why do they result in error?\n\nA: After installing MySQL on your system run this command:\nservice mysql status\n\nIf the service is down run:\nservice mysql start\n\nTo stop it:\nservice mysql stop\n\n\nA: This one should work for the manually built mysql server:\nsudo /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqld_safe --user=mysql\n\n\nA: For Ubuntu 12.10 to 14.04 (Upstart)\nNewer versions of Ubuntu use systemd.\nSTART MYSQL:\nsudo start mysql\n\nRESTART MYSQL:\nsudo restart mysql # The service must be running\n\nSTOP MYSQL:\nsudo stop mysql # The service must be running\n\n\nA: Your first two commands weren't run as root so that is expected behaviour. You need to be root to stop/start mysql.\nHowever:\nsudo /etc/init.d/mysql start\n\nshould work. Indeed it does, for me:\nkojan:~> sudo /etc/init.d/mysql restart\n[sudo] password for chris: \nStopping MySQL database server: mysqld.\nStarting MySQL database server: mysqld.\nChecking for corrupt, not cleanly closed and upgrade needing tables..\n\nI used restart rather than start, since it was already running, but the effect is the same. Are you sure you entered your password correctly? :) Have you edited your sudo config at all which would stop this working?\nThis one..\nsudo /etc/init.d/mysql - root -p start\n\nThe arguments are wrong. an init.d script only takes start or stop or restart - just one word telling it what to do. You cannot give it multiple arguments as you were trying to do.\nAnyway, the short answer is the one you actually got to work, is the recommended way. service is replacing all the init.d scripts over time, so you should get into the habit of using service. The page you link to was written in 2008, so has to be taken with some salt :)\n\nA: On Ubuntu 18.04 the socket is defined in the file /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf:\n socket     = /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock\n\nThe directory was not present so I created it manually as below:\nsudo mkdir -p /var/run/mysqld\n\nRestart MySQL. That solved it for my case here.\n\nA: I got a strange error when I installed mysql-workbench on my Ubuntu machine. After that I tried to start the mysql service using this command:\nservice mysql start\n\nThis showed that the MySQL server was not installed, so I installed it and my problem was solved. The command to install mysql-server is:\nsudo apt-get install mysql-server\n\nAfter successful installation, start the MySQL server:\nservice mysql start\n\n\nA: Also helps to double check that \"mysql\" is the correct service name. In my case it wasn't. I kept getting following response:  mysql: unrecognized service when running \nservice mysql status \n\nThen I checked /etc/init.d and found script named mysqld which listed process name: mysqld and prog=mysqld\nSo then I did \nservice mysqld status\nservice mysqld stop\nservice mysqld start \n\nand they all worked fine. \n\nA: I had the same issue with Ubuntu64 and I fixed by simply not using systemctl but instead this:\nsudo service mysql restart\n\nhopefully this command will work for you.\n\nA: I got stuck with the same issue.

The first time after a fresh reboot the screen isn't black, it is mostly white/light-gray and it looks a bit like a distorted image. The pixels fade in until it gets almost completely light-gray.\nI've got a workaround for this: I switch to the first terminal (CTRL+ALT+F1) and back to X (CTRL+ALT+F7). In most cases that helps. Sometimes, when there's still a problem, I log in on the first terminal and run \"unity --reset\". Then go back to X - this helps always.\nI can tell that the system comes back, because I can log in with my fingerprint reader (or wait a bit and put in the password) \"blindly\", then do the workaround - I am logged in after the screen comes back.

You can use other icon sizes as you wish.\nReferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2012/03/how-to-adjust-size-of-unity-2d-launcher-and-icons/\n\n*http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2012/04/how-to-change-unity-2d-launcher-icon-size-with-a-script/\n\nOriginal answer:\nAs of writing this answer, it is not possible to change the size of the launcher icons easily. Georgi's hackish method is the best possible way to change the icon size.\nThe feature to change the icon size is still not fully developed yet and hopefully, it will land in for 12.04.\nSee https://answers.launchpad.net/unity-2d/+question/175008.\n\nA: The slider for resize icons - Launcher is not available in ubuntu-2d (Unity 2D) session. \nSo I assume you are using Unity 2D. \nAn ascertainment of which session you use , would be \necho $DESKTOP_SESSION \n\ncommand in terminal. \nIf you want to resize the Launcher - Icons in Ubuntu-2d (Unity 2D) session you must \"hack\" some items manually.\nCarefully read and carefully apply bellow changes.\nOpen the terminal and do \ngksudo gedit /usr/share/unity-2d/shell/Shell.qml \n\nfind this entry \nLauncherLoader {\n    id: launcherLoader\n    anchors.top: parent.top\n    anchors.bottom: parent.bottom\n    width: 65\n\nand change the width to 52. \nSave - close  and then again \n gksudo gedit /usr/share/unity-2d/shell/common/IconTile.qml\n\nfind the entry \n Image {\n    id: icon\n    objectName: \"icon\"\n    anchors.centerIn: parent\n    smooth: true\n\n    sourceSize.width: 48\n    sourceSize.height: 48\n\nand change the sourcesSize.width and sourceSize.height to 32\nsave - close the file and then again \ngksudo gedit /usr/share/unity-2d/shell/launcher/LauncherList.qml\n\nfind the section \nAutoScrollingListView {\nid: list\nAccessible.name: objectName\n\n/* The spacing is explicitly set in order to compensate\n   the space added by selectionOutline and round_corner_54x54.png. */\nspacing: -7\n\nproperty int tileSize: 54\n\n/* selectionOutline tile size, so AutoScrollingList view can calculate\n   the right height. */\nproperty int selectionOutlineSize:  65\n\nand change the titeSize to 40 and selectionOutlineSize to 52. \nSave the file and logout - login for changes take effect. \nEnjoy and be aware that with an update in the future maybe (not for sure) these values returned to defaults. \nThis procedure was previously described here in March 2012: Changing icon size in Unity 2d Ubuntu 12.04.\n\nA: You can change icon size in 12.04.

The user is not a sudoer one. \nThanks!\n\nA: Just to go back to the sudoers method, I think you were almost there before you gave up. Looking at your latest comments, I'd just like to address something that will probably fix things for you:\nIf you run a script as root, you don't need to call sudo from within it.\nI have a script like this:\n#! /bin/bash\n\necho $USER\nwhoami\n\nIf I run sudo ./myscript I see root returned for both those. The session that script is running in is a root shell.\nIn short that means that everything you do in your script already has root permissions. You don't need to call sudo (not that it should hurt - root usually has sudo permissions).\nSo write your script, chown it to root and chmod it to 700 (so only root can run, read, or edit it) and then just allow your user[s] to run it through sudoers. That should work.\nIf it's not working, it's likely a bigger issue with the script, not the permissions framework. I'd suggest giving a user full sudo access (adding to admin group is the easiest way) and then running your script.\n\nA: Step 1. create a script with the bind command using any editor. For example:\nsudo emacs bind_user_directories.sh\n\ncontents:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n#NOTE: this file would be placed in /usr/local/sbin/ folder as bind_user_directories.sh\n#alternatively it could be placed in /etc/init.d/ ...

One of the most known program is Wonder Shaper. However I would recommend Trickle, because this software is more userfriendly.\nTrickle runs in userspace and uses LD_PRELOAD to inject some own networking libraries. You can install it using apt-get install trickle (or any other tool you like). Normally you would use Trickle like:\ntrickle -d 1234 -u 567 my_software\n\nWhere -d is the download rate (1234 KB/s in the above example), -u upload rate (567 KB/s) and my_software is any software like Firefox, BitTorrent or else.\nIn your case it makes more sense to use trickled with an own trickled.conf. This configuration file should look like the following example:\n[bittorrent]\nPriority = 8\n[www]\nPriority = 1\n\nSo WWW has the highest priority, while BitTorrent gets the lowest. So Trickle will make sure, that browsing is always possible. Further details in setting up Trickle are in trickled.conf(5) and trickled(8).\n", "Q: Find out cause of kernel panics I've been getting these kernel panics for a while now and been looking for help.

I was given a Mac G4 without the operating system. It had Mac OS 10.4. Is there an Ubuntu version I can use for the Mac like there is for my PC? If so, what version? And are there any special tricks for Mac? Or is it fairly simple as it is for PC. (I'm not at all familiar with Mac, but the components look pretty much the same.)\n\nA: The PowerPC version of Ubuntu, which is community-supported rather than officially supported, should run on your Mac that has a G4 processor. There are some differences between the PowerPC version of Ubuntu and the versions of Ubuntu for officially supported architectures; you will likely find the PowerPC FAQ helpful. There are also some very general system requirements.\nThe PowerPC download page contains links to where you can download the PowerPC version for each Ubuntu release, as well as links to special installation instructions, as applicable. Please note that for some Ubuntu releases, the PowerPC version's desktop .iso image is too large to be burned to a CD, so it must be burned to a DVD instead (or written to a USB flash drive, if your G4 Mac is capable of booting from one).\n\nA: I have just loaded Ubuntu 12.04 on my iBook G4 and it runs great.

Is there commercial-grade computer animation software available for Ubuntu, similar to the professional software sold for the Windows operating system?\nThis question goes out to those of you who may be using such software professionally.  My daughter recently graduated from the Art Institute of Seattle, and needs to put together an animation portfolio in order to interest employers in the field.  As you know, such software is usually provided by the employer and the costs are high - several thousand dollars.\nI suggested that she investigate Ubuntu as a possible way to acquire the tools she needs.

It works on Windows, Mac, and Ubuntu. It is small, only 23 Megabytes, so you can install it from the software center without worrying about the computer slowing down. It is well documented and has many books written on it. If you would like to see what can be accomplished with Blender, search YouTube for \"Big Buck Bunny\". It is a short movie created using Blender a few years ago to show off what Blender can do. You can also check out the \"Features and Gallery\" section on Blender's website, which is at www.blender.org.

I have a Dell Inspiron 1501. processor SEMPRON 1.7 and 2GB RAM.\n\nA: Did you MD5 test the .iso image before you burned it to CD/DVD or wrote it to the USB flash drive? If not, please do that now. If that doesn't check out, you'll have to redownload the .iso image, MD5 test the new image, and (assuming the new one checks out) burn a new disc or write it to the USB flash drive again.\nDid you verify that the live CD/DVD/USB was written correctly and is readable by the machine on which you're installing? To do that, boot from it, and immediately when you see the person and keyboard icons at the bottom center of the screen, press Spacebar, select your language, and select \"Check disc for defects\". (This goes for USB flash drives as well as CD's and DVD's.) If that doesn't check out, you'll have to burn a new disc or re-write the .iso image to the USB flash drive (and run this test on it again).\nIf the installation medium checks out as described above and you still have this problem, it can most often be solved by using the nomodeset boot option. After installing, you'll probably need to specify nomodeset when booting the system, and then make the setting permanent (all of which is detailed in that forum thread). However, it is possible that after installing you may be able to enable different video drivers in Additional Drivers to fix the problem, as well.\nIf the above advice does not help, please edit your question to include the make and model of your video card.\n", "Q: How do I ensure my Apple bluetooth keyboard connects on boot?

So is there any valid way except of rebooting? (yes, reboot helps with this issue)\n\n\n*\n\n*yes, I know I should prepend the commands with sudo, but either one I posted above changes nothing in ifconfig -a output: I still see eth1, not eth0.\n\n*I just changed the NAME property of udev-rule line. Don't know any reason for this to be ineffective.\nThere is no any error in executing of both commands I've posted above, but they just don't change actual interface name in ifconfig -a output. If I perform reboot - then interface name changes as expected.\nFor development purposes I write some script that clones virtual machines (VirtualBox-driven) and pre-sets them up in some way.\nSo I perform a command to clone VM, start it and as long as network interface MAC is changed - udev adds the second rule to network persistent rules. Right after machine is booted for the first time there are 2 rules:\n\n\n*\n\n*eth0, which does not exist, as long as it existed in the original VM image MAC\n\n*eth1, which exists, but all the configuration in all files refers to eth0, so it is not that good for me\n\n\nSo I with sed delete the line with eth0 (it is obsolete and useless in cloned image) and replace eth1 with eth0. So currently I have valid persistent rule, but there is still eth1 in /dev.\nThe issue: I don't want to reboot the machine (it will take another time, which is not good thing on building-VM-stage) and just want to have my /dev rebuilt with some command so I have ready-to-use VM without any reboots.\n\nA: I had a similar problem. Since I didn't want to take the time to reboot, I ran a one liner using Chris Wesseling's suggestion. \n\n/etc/init.d/networking stop && modprobe -r tg3 && udevadm control --reload-rules &&  udevadm trigger && modprobe tg3 && /etc/init.d/networking start\n\nThis worked for me using Ubuntu 12.04.02 server. My nics were using the tg3 kernel module driver, so change tg3 to the module your interfaces are using. I found the ones mine used in /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules:\n\nPCI device 0x14e4:/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1c.4/0000:02:00.1 (tg3) <-kernel module driver for the nic\n\nThe one issue I had was a bad route which I fixed with a simple route add command.\nThanks for the help Chris!\n\nA: This worked for me (without rebooting)\nudevadm control --reload-rules ; udevadm trigger\n\nKudos to the author of this page:\nhttp://memoryfail.wordpress.com/2013/04/02/renaming-network-device-names/\n\nA: I don't know if this helps in reloading the network configuration, but when I modified /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-cd.rules to correct the DVD device link from /dev/dvd1 to /dev/dvd, I had to run\nsudo udevadm trigger\n\nto get have the new links created.\n\nA: sudo /etc/init.d/udev restart should do the trick. Some of the commands you had tried, if run with sudo, might be effective as well.\n\nA: This should do it safely: \nsudo reload udev\n\nAs I have used this command with no issues.\n\nA: You have to combine all the advice given here in the right order:\n\n\n*\n\n*Bring down the network service networking stop\n\n*Unload the driver module from the kernel\n\n*\n\n*Find the name of the module lspci -v and look for \"Kernel driver in use:\"\n\n*modprobe -r <driver module>\n\n\n*Reload the udev rules udevadm control --reload-rules\n\n*Trigger the new rules udevadm trigger\n\n*Load driver modprobe <driver module>\n\n*Restart the network service networking start\n\n*(optional) Re-run any iptables scripts that referenced the eth interface name before it was up.\n\n\nI suspect either step 4 or step 5 isn't really needed, but these steps worked for me. You could check after step 4 with step 2.1 to see if the trigger command already did step 5, edit this answer to reflect your findings if you do. \n\nA: I've been researching this for a while with pretty much the same purpose, and I haven't been able to find a way to change the network interface name in a live system.\nThe workaround I have gone for is to delete the /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules file in the template, which means that on the next boot it will see any network card as eth0.\n\nA: You need to reload udev to trigger the rule change, but the device won't be renamed unless you unload/reload the driver module.\nSo modprobe -r e1000 && modprobe e1000 after udev reload should do the trick. Of course, don't do that if you need the network and have only e1000 interfaces.\n\nA: I followed the instructions in this guide: How to regenerate the /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules file on Debian/Ubuntu\nThe solution consists in using the command:\nudevadm trigger\n\nthat regenerates the /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules file.\n\nA: So for me on VirtualBox with Ubuntu 12.04, I often switch between ethernet and wireless.\nSo when my connection changes, I must choose the Bridged Adapter from Devices > Network Settings.

Now I need to move to another laptop. I found instructions for the backing up in https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BackupYourSystem\nNow as a rule, I would be getting a new laptop with Windows again I need to use wubi. So in my new system I want to try 11.10 instead of 11.04\nIf I create a backup of 11.04 and in my new laptop if I upgrade to 11.10, can I restore it back in 11.10?\n\nA: I suggest following: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WubiGuide#How_can_I_make_a_backup_of_my_Wubi_install.3F\nIn a nutshell, take a copy of the entire \"disk image\" that Wubi makes. It will take up a bit more space to keep, but you're guaranteed to get everything :)\nCopy it over to your new Windows installation (you will have to install Wubi there first, to get everything setup, such as the Windows bootloader. Then rather than use the new disk image it just made, copy in your backup.\nOnce done you have 11.04 on your new laptop. Now upgrade it using the usual methods (do-release-upgrade, or Update Manager) to 11.10. There is little chance of this failing, but if it does, you still have the 11.04 backup image to fall back to (assuming you keep another copy of it, which you should until the upgrade is done).\n", "Q: How to install a tar.bz2 package How can I install a tarbz2 package. Example: I have downloaded firefox 8 tar.bz2 . I want to know a general method for installation of tar.bz2 package.\n\nA: In general, to install a tar.bz2 (or .tar, or .tar.gz, or tar.xz, or, rarely, .tar.Z), see this guide. Please note that the specific flag to indicate to the tar command that you want to extract (or create) a bz2-compressed archive is j.\nHowever, you should probably not install Firefox 8 from upstream sources, as you seem to be trying to do. That is not the best way to get it, other programs that depend on it would not necessarily know that it was installed, you would not benefit from changes made specifically for Ubuntu (if any), and you would not automatically receive updates (including security updates)--instead, when a new version comes out, you would have to manually compile and install that version.\nInstead, you should probably update to Firefox in the recommended way for Ubuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I install the latest stable version of Firefox?\n", "Q: How to move files leaving symlinks behind?

After a successful upgrade from 11.04 to 11.10 a gradual deterioration occurred -- my laptop became unstable with updates -- I corrected the Aspell file, only to have another appear, I sought but I was blocked out. Had an idea, but resolved one that another problem appeared -- going from bad to worse -- I re-installed windows Vista and Ubuntu 11.10 in the original partitions. Window called it Windows Old and I had no problems recovering my files there - Ubuntu decided it is going to make a new Home directory -- .\n      the questions is where did these files go to after re-installation -- are they deleted? If so That's fine duplicates are in Ubuntu 1 by synchronization - I can only download one file at a time! \n\nA: I'm not sure exactly what happened based on your description, but there could be a few possibilities.  Ubuntu may have formatted your home partition and used it again, in which case the files would be deleted, but might be recoverable with some file recover tool. \nOr it may have used a different partition as your home directory, in which case something else could be using that partition, or it could be unused.  \nMaybe try putting in a live CD and having a poke around all the partitions to look for the files you are after. \nGood work on making a backup though!  At least you can restore them from the internet. \n\nA: Not many people could guess that, but you can always check wtih tools that are provided in ubuntu like Disk utility. \n\nYou can also help yourself with GParted.\n\nThe best way to reinstall is shown in this article. But basically you should always check the order of your partitions with Disk utility and then at install, select \"Something else\" to set the partitions by hand.\n\nGood luck!\n", "Q: \"Failed to download repository information\" error, what to do? Well, some sources of softwares aren't working; mostly all the universe and multiverse sources' applications are not installable... shortly the problem has shown in the picture in the link below. Please help!\n\n\nA: If possible, could you edit your question to show the two lines in full that we can see part of in your screenshot?  I don't think this in an internet connection-related problem. If it was, ALL of the repositories would have failed to download if this was the case, not just one or two.  There are a couple of possibilities that I am aware of that could cause this.  \n\n\n*\n\n*As mentioned in Tareq's answer, perhaps the Ubuntu server for your area is temporarily having problems.  If this is the case, there should be mention of a 404 error at the end of each line that failed to download.  Things like this should be fixed in a matter of only a day or two in most cases.\n\n*Try running an update from the terminal and see if you get the same (or different) errors.  Simply open a terminal and run the following command:\nsudo apt-get update\nWait for it to finish and then see if you still have errors.\n\n\n*Perhaps for some reason you are missing one or more GPG Keys.  These keys are a security function that helps to keep the repositories safe.  If this is the case, you should see something like NO_PUBKEY or something similar to this screenshot at the end of each line:\n\n\n\nThe best way to make sure you have all of your correct GPG Keys is to install launchpad-getkeys from the WebUpd8 repository.  Do that by entering the following lines in the terminal:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:nilarimogard/webupd8\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install launchpad-getkeys\n\nAfter that, simply run the command:\nsudo launchpad-getkeys\n\nYou will see something like this:\n\nAs it says, you shouldn't see anymore missing key errors.  When the program finishes, simply run Update Manager again or use the above commands to update from the Terminal.\nsudo apt-get update\n\nagain and see if you still have the same problem.  \nOnce again, I do NOT believe this is an internet issue unless it is on the other end.  Only one or two of your repositories failed to download, not ALL of them, and you can still use the internet, so if this is an internet-related issue it is on the end of the repository servers, as far as I know.  Hope this helps!\n\nA: That's an internet problem! Are you able to access internet? if yes , and this still happens, then may be you're behind proxy with authentication.  You'll then need to provide proxy with password. \n", "Q: gcc no longer works after upgrade As an example:\nhsmyers@ubuntu:~/c_dev$ cat hello.c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main(int argc,char **argv) {\nprintf(\"Hello World!\\n\");\nreturn 0;\n}\nhsmyers@ubuntu:~/c_dev$ gcc -c -o hello.o hello.c\nIn file included from /usr/include/stdio.h:28:0,\n             from hello.c:1:\n/usr/include/features.h:323:26: fatal error: bits/predefs.h: No such file or directory\ncompilation terminated.\n\nAt a guess somewhere along the way after trying to fix the error message:\n/usr/bin/ld: cannot find crt1.o: No such file or directory\nI've munged things up completely.

You can check by running the following:\ngcc --verbose -o hello hello.c\n\nwhich should print the search path for include files. Mine says:\n\n    #include <...> search starts here:\n     /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/4.6.1/include\n     /usr/local/include\n     /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/4.6.1/include-fixed\n     /usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu\n     /usr/include\n\nIf that's not the same, I'd say there is a version mismatch between some of your build-essential packages. Check that you have the right versions of the gcc, and libc6-dev packages. Right now on oneiric, these should be:\ngcc           4:4.6.1-2ubuntu5\nlibc6-dev     2.13-20ubuntu5 \n\n\nA: I had the same problem with my avr-gcc compiler.\nI linked the files and folders in /usr/include/i386-linux-gnu/ to a folder in which avr-gcc\nsearches for -files.

I am a bit unsure about how ubuntus encrypted home folder works compared to a truecrypt partition (which is what I have used before). When I am logged in, will other users on my computer be able to access the files in my encrypted home folder?\n\nA: In principle they can, but the default permissions on the home directory (rwxr-x---) forbids that.\n\nA: If you enable Ubuntu's Home Directory Encryption, your $HOME directory will have permissions 700 (rwx------) when its mounted, and permissions 500 (r-x------) when it's not mounted.  This meaning that you are the only non-root user who will be able to read/write/browse your home directory when its mounted.  And when it's not mounted, you'll be able to read/browse, but not modify the contents of your home directory.  This is intended to prevent you from inadvertently writing unencrypted data to your home directory.\nThis is in contrast to the default Ubuntu Home Directory permissions, which are 755 (rwxr-xr-x).  That permission allows any local user on the system to read and browse your home directory.  This default was chosen for Ubuntu long, long ago in the interest of \"sharing\" and \"openness\".\nThese are called Discretionary Access Controls (DAC), and come from the earliest days of UNIX itself.\nThe root user (perhaps via sudo as you mentioned above), is privileged in a way that allows them access to any file or directory, regardless of the DAC permissions in place.  That means that yes, while your home directory is mounted, the root user is able to browse your home directory.\nHowever, when your home directory is not mounted, the root user would need your login passphrase (or, more specifically, your randomly generated mount passphrase) in order to mount and decrypt your data.\nIn general, the encrypted filesystem that we use (eCryptfs) is intended to protect your data at rest on the hard drive, rather than protect you from your own root user.\nFull disclosure: I am the author of Ubuntu's Encrypted Home Directory feature, and the current maintainer of eCryptfs.\n", "Q: Why can any user read the content in my home directory? Why is it that the default setting makes it possible for user A to look in the home of user B and vice versa?\nAnd furthermore... That user can not only look into the home of another user, he can also open any document he wants to.\nIt feels very insecure to me. There should be more privacy for users. I know how to prevent this situation, but it puzzles me why this should be possible in the first place.\n\nA: As said Ubuntu by default leaves the home from each user open for others to peak inside, its a way of facilitating access and file sharing between user accounts.\nOf course each directory / file can have it's permissions changed by the user so that the files become more private. For that you can use the command chmod, read the manual pages by typing man chmod in a terminal\nAlso, if privacy is an issue you can during installation or a new user creation, select to encrypt the user's home. That will make the home directory of that user inaccessible to other users even if the user is currently logged in to the system (default behaviour).\nYou can still encrypt your home folder if you did not. For that you need the ecryptfs-utils package installed\nsudo apt-get install ecryptfs-utils\n\nLog out and log in with the guest user account (or create a temporary account for the effect), open a terminal and type:\nsudo ecryptfs-migrate-home -u <username>\n\nWhere <username> is the username of the user you want to encrypt the home folder.\n\nA: @Digiplace, I agree that it is pretty silly that any user can see your personal files, regardless of the history of UNIX, there are ways to keep your files private however by using enryption\nEncrypting home directories allows you to keep your files private. Without the proper authentication, unauthorized users will not be allowed view or access the content stored in your home folder.\nTo get started, go to Applications â> Ubuntu Software Center.\nThen search for and install âecryptfs-utilsâ\n\nAfter installing, âEncrypt home folderâ option should be enabled when creating new users.\n\nIf a user account is already created, and itâs not encrypted, go to Applications â> Accessories â> Terminal and run the command to encrypt an existing account.\nsudo ecryptfs-migrate-home -u USERNAME\nReplace USERNAME with the username of the account.\nAfter encrypting an existing user directory, allow the user to login immediately before restarting the computer.\nWhen the user logs in, he/she must click âRun this action nowâ to create a passphrase (password) when prompted below.\n\nWhen everything works ok, go to the /home folder and delete the temporary folder created for the user. If everything didnât work, then restore the userâs home directory. But remember, a user must be logged out before you can encrypt his/her home folder.\n\n\nA: Other user cannot modify or delete your files, nor they can execute your scripts with your credentials, so it is not insecure.\nTraditionally, UNIX has given the users the privilege to read almost everything in the system. Of course, as you know, if you feel you have confidential information to hide from other, you can.\n\nA: To solve this do one thing change the permissions of your home directory /files to X00 where 00will make them inaccessible to others in your group and to any other user\nchmod 0X00 home directory/file_name\n\n", "Q: Install updates without breaking shell theme? Recently I installed a copy of Oneiric Ocelot 11.10 on my ThinkPad. Everything went fine, I installed the gnome shell and gnome-tweak-tool to customize everything. I changed the shell theme, the GTK+ theme and the icon set.\nAfter everything fit my needs perfectly, I installed some updates from the update manager (no upgrades, just small updates). I had to restart, and after I restarted, my gnome shell was broken. In tweak-tool, it showed the customized shell as the default one, and my gtk theme was broken as well (it looked like two themes \"frankensteined\" together...). The bad thing was - I couldn't get things back into the default settings!\nSo the only thing left was to use the -non broken- unity shell.\nWhat can I do to stop these things from happening?

I think it may be your bios looking for plug n play device which either not exist or faulty. anyway you can always reinstall grub from within your ubuntu.\n\nA: I disconnected all the external usb devices, manually deactivated the background image, used grub-mkconfig and update-grub. I should tell you that the behaviour changed recently: First, the menu is shown and the selection of the first menu entry leads to the long waiting. This is with and without background image.

I double check that the name ends in .jpg - yet when I search for the file using Import From Folder in Shotwell, its name is watermarked, and therefore cannot be selected or imported.

Does Ubuntu make use of multicore CPUs (as Windows 7 is said to do)?\nIn other words, is it multitasking optimized so that users will take benefit of 4+ core processors?\n\nA: Yes, Ubuntu is optimized for multicore CPUs and has been for many years.\nSome background:\n\"Version 2.0 (of the Linux kernel) was released 9 June 1996. There were 41 releases in the series. The major feature of 2.0 was SMP support (that is, symmetric multi processing in a single system) and support for more types of processors.\"\n\nA: Ubuntu is an operating system, a Linux distribution.\nA operating system consists of several software components such as a kernel, libraries, services/daemons, applications, etc.\nUbuntu uses the Linux kernel which makes use of symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) and multiple cores. It scales very well from low-end single-cpu single-core systems to high-end supercomputer clusters with thousands of multi-core CPUs.\nUbuntu ships with hundreds of libraries, some of which are multi-threaded and thread-safe, some of which are not. In some cases it makes sense for them to be multi-threaded, in others it is not applicable, generally possible or does not make much sense.\nUbuntu ships with hundreds of applications, some are coded to make use of multi-core CPUs, some are not. In some cases it does make sense to code the application as such, in other cases its not possible.\nNot all applications that could or should make use of multiple cores do so.\nExample it makes sense for a game to use multi-core for graphics, audio, network, physics, etc. But it does not make sense for a calculator, screenshot tool, suduko, or menu editor to be multi-core aware.\n\nA: Ubuntu's kernel supports multiple CPU for a long time now, does not really mater if its multi-core or multiples CPUs in one system, they will be handled perfectly.\nOne thing you have to be aware of though, just because a system has support for several CPUs/cores and those are present in a system it does not mean your applications will automatically run faster. You get told the opposite a lot now a days, its a marketing thing.\nFor an application to take advantage of several CPUs/cores at the same time it needs to be built to share the process load over those CPUs/cores.\nIe: lets say you are running something as simple as wordpad in Windows and you are opening a huge text file with it, the loading time will be the same either you have 1 CPU or 1 zillion CPUs (for CPUs with same bus speed and similar architecture ofc).\nThe same goes with Linux Kernel and the Ubuntu distro, if an application is build for a single thread then there is nothing more CPUs will do.\nOne thing that the operative systems are doing now a days to optimize applications load over several CPUs/cores is the ability to run a process on a core that is not so loaded as the other are, thus balancing the load and making sure your multiple cores utilization is optimal. Tough in practice, the utilization of that technique only brings small speed improvements.\nIf you really want to see your cores shine you need to be doing heavy CPU utilization with programs that support symmetric multiprocessing, like video editing, etc.\n\nA: Yes, it works perfectly for me and I have multiple processors and hyper-threading, which I forgot what that means but I'm pretty sure it means something about that each processor can execute multiple threads, which combined with the fact that each processor has 2 cores, would seem to be a problem. The only problem I have encountered so far is that programs on ubuntu tend to freeze it up. I made that happen less often by decreasing the swappiness since I have 6GB of RAM.\n", "Q: Can I download Unity as a separate session on Ubuntu 10.10 without breaking Compiz 0.8.6? I installed Ubuntu 10.10 Desktop Edition, which uses the GNOME 2 Desktop Environment with the GNOME Classic shell. It comes with Compiz 0.8.6 pre-installed, so I can install and configure the bleeding-edge version of Compiz through Git. \nAfter I moved from Ubuntu 11.10 to 10.10, I really enjoyed the GNOME Classic session with Cairo-dock and Compiz, but I still miss the simplicity of Unity. \nHowever, one of the dependencies of Unity is Compiz 0.9.6 (I am also aware that I can download Unity Netbook edition, but it would be not practical installing it on a laptop). This means if I want to use Unity 4.22.0, I need to update Compiz, which I do not want to do  because I want to use the unsupported Compiz plugins which only work on Compiz 0.8.6.\nIs there a way around this? Can I download Unity as a separate session without breaking Compiz 0.8.6?\n\nA: No is the simple answer - Unity in 11.10 utilises much of the Compiz rewritten code in 0.9.6.  Indeed, a large majority of Unity consists of a Compiz specific plugin for v0.9.6.  You will need to rewrite this to use Compiz 0.8.6. \nIt also has major dependencies upon the GTK+3 library set.\n\nA: Install Ubuntu-netbook package from synaptic package manager -- http://www.thisweekinlinux.com/2010/10/installunity/.\nI didn't try it myself (I've 11.10 with gnome-shell), however looking at date for the post in question it should work properly on standard 10.10 installation.\n", "Q: IronHide / BumbleBee with a VirtualBox VM. Will it pass through video acceleration to the physical card? Any ideas whether you can run a Windows VM via IronHide for graphics card acceleration? I'd like to play games / watch bluray etc utilising my video card.\n\nA: Perhaps an explanation between graphics in a virtual guest and the actual host O/S would help here.\nFirst the basics:\nEverything in a virtual guest is an abstraction - what this means is that every device and driver in a virtual guest O/S does not depend upon the actual host device & driver.\nTo give you a simple example.  A mouse is seen as a specific device - the linux kernel sees this device and allows the guest operating system to use that device.  This \"virtual device\" is mapped to the real physical device by the virtualisation tool - VirtualBox, VMWare, Xen etc.  Thus the guest operating system never needs to understand what the physical mouse is, it only sees what the virtualisation tool has mapped to it.  The value of this approach is that you can move the virtual guest to different Hosts - it will operate in the same way because there is no direct dependency on the Host itself.\nTo show this in practice you can run lsusb on both the host and guest - on my host O/S I have the following USB devices:\nBus 002 Device 002: ID 8087:0020 Intel Corp. Integrated Rate Matching Hub\nBus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub\nBus 001 Device 003: ID 0402:9665 ALi Corp. \nBus 001 Device 002: ID 8087:0020 Intel Corp. Integrated Rate Matching Hub\nBus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub\n\nOn my guest oneiric O/S I can see the following USB devices - these are different from the host:\nBus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub\nBus 001 Device 002: ID 80ee:0021 VirtualBox USB Tablet\n\nAny guest O/S whether windows or linux will only see this virtual guest device.\nHost graphics vs guest graphics\nIt is the same for graphics.\nMy host graphics is:\n sudo lshw -class display\n  *-display               \n       description: VGA compatible controller\n       product: Core Processor Integrated Graphics Controller\n       vendor: Intel Corporation\n       physical id: 2\n       bus info: pci@0000:00:02.0\n       version: 18\n       width: 64 bits\n       clock: 33MHz\n       capabilities: msi pm vga_controller bus_master cap_list rom\n       configuration: driver=i915 latency=0\n       resources: irq:41 memory:90000000-903fffff memory:80000000-8fffffff ioport:3050(size=8)\n\nOn my guest oneiric O/S it can see the following graphics card - you can see it is not the same as the host:\nsudo lshw -class display\n  *-display UNCLAIMED     \n       description: VGA compatible controller\n       product: VirtualBox Graphics Adapter\n       vendor: InnoTek Systemberatung GmbH\n       physical id: 2\n       bus info: pci@0000:00:02.0\n       version: 00\n       width: 32 bits\n       clock: 33MHz\n       capabilities: vga_controller bus_master\n       configuration: latency=64\n       resources: memory:e0000000-e7ffffff\n\nLikewise - a Windows Guest O/S will see only a similar virtual guest device.\nIn the murky world of VirtualBox, the Guest Additions which you can manually install (or in 11.10 - jockey sees and recommends you install it) installs additional kernel modules (or device drivers for Windows Guests) to allow the guest O/S enhanced access to your host O/S graphics.  Again its not a direct mapping - but allows 3D accelerated graphics to be seen.\nIf an application inside your virtual machine uses 3D features through the OpenGL programming interface (or for a Windows guest O/S - its DirectX calls), instead of emulating them in software (which would be slow), VirtualBox will attempt to use your host's 3D hardware.\nAgain I stress, the guest O/S doesnt see your actual graphics card it just passes the OpenGL (or DirectX) call from the Guest directly to the Host hardware to process.\n\nIn VirtualBox settings you should change the video card memory and 3D graphics card setting.  Your guest O/S will then see a \"3D Accelerated card\" with 128Mb RAM.  It doesnt matter if your host graphics card is better than this - your guest O/S will only see this \"simple\" abstracted virtual graphics card.\nSince you mentioned you are using a Windows Guest O/S - the 2D checkbox is applicable to you since a similar pass-through of programming interface calls is performed.\nBumblebee/IronHide is an either/or graphics switching mechanism - you are using either integrated graphics or the higher capacity NVidia/ATI graphics but not both at the same time.\nSince the OpenGL (or DirectX) capability of the higher switchable graphics is that more greater than the integrated chips set, you will see a relatively enhanced graphics performance with Guest O/S graphics intensive applications.  However this improvement is not as dramatic as running the same application natively on the host since it is still working within the constraints of the 128MB virtual guest graphics device.\nsource\n\nA: An answer above https://askubuntu.com/a/85138/38052 explains how everything that the guest O/S sees is some kind of an abstraction. While this used to be completely true, I believe things are changing and it may not be completely true any more. \nSome newer processors also support I/O MMU virtualization. The technologies are called Intel VT-d for the Intel's version and AMD-Vi for AMD's version. To quote the wikipedia article on x86 virtualization:\n\nIntel's I/O MMU virtualization (AMD-Vi and VT-d) Main article:\n  IOMMU\nAn input/output memory management unit (IOMMU) enables guest virtual\n  machines to directly use peripheral devices, such as Ethernet,\n  accelerated graphics cards, and hard-drive controllers, through DMA\n  and interrupt remapping. This is sometimes called PCI passthrough.\n  Both AMD and Intel have released specifications:\nAMD's I/O Virtualization Technology, \"AMD-Vi\", originally called \"IOMMU\".\nIntel's \"Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O\" (VT-d).\n\n\nThis sounds pretty interesting, but I can foresee some problems already. For one, in Optimus laptops, the Intel IGP is always rendering the final on-screen output. It is unclear to me how the Guest O/S and the Host O/S are both going to drive the IGP. One thought is that if it is possible to run the Host without any graphics while guests are running, this could be made to work, but it is unclear to me how one would actually go about doing this.\n\nA: OK, I was curious, so I tried this.  \nQEMU, and now VirtualBox, are supporting pass-through of PCI devices to the guest machine.  That means if you have a 2nd graphics card, you can pass it to a windows guest on a linux host and get full 3D performance (games) in a virtualized windows environment.  That's the case for a desktop rig with two graphics cards.  The device manager would show \"NVIDIA GTX... whatever\"  instead of saying \"Virualbox Graphics Adapter\".\nOptimus is always more complicated.  I'm testing this on an ASUS UX501.   I was able to pass the NVidia chip through to the windows guest and it shows in the device manager as \"3D Video Controller.\"  But I was unable to install any windows drivers to support it.  Seems the presence of the intel graphics are a prereq.\nsarang was right to be suspicious.  It looks like the nvidia chip is not a \"display adapter\" as would drive a monitor, but just an accelerator for the integrated intel chip.  They don't seem function as two separate devices independently.  \n\nA: https://gist.github.com/Misairu-G/616f7b2756c488148b7309addc940b28\nIt is possible to pass through the DGPU in some cases ( See Above Link) .  i have managed this on my Dell 7710 with Quadro m5000m DGPU passed through from Ubuntu host to Windows10 guest.\nHowever AFIK its is not possible to display the output from this card on the main laptop screen Via hardware.  i think looking glass is probably the best option at the moment,  followed by steam in home streaming / RDP etc.\nI would like to know why it is not possible to to just control the Mux in muxed laptops to switch between the IGPU and DGPU at will.   i attempted this via VGA Switcheroo  but was unable to control the mux at all even before passing through the DPU to a Guest OS.\nI guess Mux-less laptops i guess would be more challenging at least requiring some communication between guest and host to control which GPU is writing to which bit of the frame buffer. way over my head.\n", "Q: How can I make nautilus-gsku work in 11.10?

I assume it is not getting the ip address. Anybody with the same Wireless adaptor facing this issue on Ubuntu 11.10 (Shell) ? This used to work perfectly in Ubuntu 11.04.\n\nA: Try this:\nGo to network connections -> Wireless\nchoose the network you want to connect\nselect edit->ipv6-settings->ignore\nA technical note:\n We can use our wifi adapter (NIC) in four modes: managed, monitor, ad-hoc and Access Point(master).\nManaged: It is the default mode. It helps us to connect to access points only. So if you are connected to AP it means your card is in managed mode.\nMonitor: In this mode you don't connect to any of the networks but simply catch the packets in air. Usually used for hacking wifi passwords.\nAd-hoc: It is like a P2P connection. If two machines are connected via an ad-hoc connection both the machines should be in ad-hoc mode , using managed mode you can't connect to an ad-hoc but only access point.\nAccess Point: In this your card behaves like a router/access point.

The specs are: 3gig DDR2 ram, amd turino*2 processor 2Ghz, 250gig HD, windows 7 ultimate.\nAfter installing Ubuntu 11.10 and using it for about an hour my laptop starts shutting down most times before even reaching the log on screen. I have re installed it twice but the problem still persist. I had this same problem with ubuntu 11.04. I have been using ubuntu for the last 5 years and never had this problem before. Windows 7, vista and fedora runs fine, it just ubuntu that gives any sort of issue. What could be causing this problem? has something critical been changed since the 10.10 version? I really love ubuntu and i want to be able to run it again\n\nA: Yes, there have been rather extreme changes since 10.10 -- by far the larges changes in the history of Ubuntu. It has been necessary to replace key platform software and vital to do so quickly since the next version of Ubuntu in April will be supported for five years and everything needs to be in place by then. It would've been better if Gnome 3 and other key technologies, had been ready in March 2010 so Ubuntu would have the full two years to make the transition. Alas, that's not how the world works, so we better make the best of it. Because of these large changes in such a short timespan, Ubuntu is temporarily not as rock solid as it usually is. Luckily, though, 10.04 will be supported for a couple of years more, and even 10.10 will be supported until 12.04 is released, by which time most of the issues should be resolved. In other words, if 10.10 works and 11.04 doesn't, then you have the option of postponing the upgrade. \nIt is useful to know that things work in Windows, but it would be more useful to know what version of Fedora you're comparing with. That way, we can compare versions of software like the kernel. If you have upgraded from an earlier version of Ubuntu, you can try to boot an older kernel while booting, by holding shift to show the grub menu. You can of course install older kernels anyway. If you need help with that, search for a question about it, or open a new one to handle that topic separately. These types of issues might be difficult to track down on a site like this, though. \nMy reusable recommendation is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Stick to what works.\n\n*Don't fix it if it ain't broken\n\n*When in doubt, don't. \n\n\nGood luck :)\n", "Q: Subfolders not syncing in Ubuntu One I've set a folder to sync, which has two subfolders, each of which has many subfolders as well.

Instead they use some pretty ugly and totally off theme.\nTo be clear, both are Qt4 applications and should pickup the theme by default.\nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: Install qt4-qtconfig, run qtconfig and on the first tab choose GTK+ for Select GUI style.\n\nA: libgnomui-0 itself is not needed for the bugfix, but only one of its dependencies, libgnome2-common.

I am running crunchbang (#!) linux on my netbook (which uses an ubuntu core). \nWhen I start my netbook (running on battery) I am prompted to reset my Bios settings. \nThis causes some problems with my clock, since it is reset to factory default settings.\nWhich in turn causes problems with fsck and my OS doesn't boot properly on normal mode. \nWhat I did so far was loading the OS in recovery mode, letting fsck fix some timestamps in manual mode and eventually it will let me through to the OS. Logged in I updated my clock and I don't get other errors.\nThe strange thing is that if my laptop is plugged into AC (not using the battery) and I in a previous session had updated the clock and all, it wouldn't prompt me to reset the Bios settings. But as soon as I boot it from battery it prompts me again. Which could mean it is a hardware problem. Some capacitors leaking power. But it is only on start up, I don't have strange drift rates or jumps in my clock after I updated it manually with a server.\nI am unsure what causes my problem, whether it might be simply a hardware failure or due to some bug in my OS. \nHas anyone experienced the same problem?\n\nA: You laptop's motherboard battery is probably dead, replace it and this will go away.\nThe battery is responsible for keeping the real time clock on and making sure that your BIOS settings are kept between power cycles.\nIf a computer keeps asking for setting up your BIOS settings and your clock resets to factory on each boot there can only be 3 things related to that:\n\n\n*\n\n*The battery is dead (no battery means the system will boot with\ndefault BIOS settings / clock), replace it if necessary;\n\n*Your clear CMOS jumper on the motherboard (if present) is set to on (erases\nsettings / clock on each reboot), switch the jumper to the off position and your computer will save BIOS settings / clock between power cycles;\n\n*You motherboard is defect and its not saving the BIOS setting /\nclock, in this case you need to replace the motherboard.\n\n\nThe catch here is that not only your clock is reset but also your BIOS settings, if it was just something messing with the clock the BIOS settings would not be erased.\nSome laptop motherboards have replaceable batteries, others have chargeable ones soldered in to the PCB. With some luck you have the first type and can swap it in a few minutes (probably one of the covers on the bottom side of the laptop allow access to it), if you have one of the 2nd type you can still replace it with simple soldering skills or ask any electronics company around where you live to to so for you.\n", "Q: How to make error message?

To circumvent this restriction while staying compatible, one partition type was defined to be a so-called extended partition which can itself contain additional \"logical partitions\".\nOn your drive, there is a \"hole\" in the extended partition where no logical partition is defined. Instead a primary partition overlaps the extended partition and fills that hole exactly. So no data is really overlapping, and there is no immediate danger of data loss.\nThe easiest solution is to delete the offending partition (/dev/sda3) if you don't need it. Afterwards you can try to create a new logical partition at the same position. I recommend using fdisk for this as it doesn't try to format anything, so if you made a backup of your partition table you can simple restore it and try again.\nWARNING\nThis is dangerous, and you should have a full backup of your drive before doing it.\n", "Q: Gnome - shell doesn't load I have a problem and to be honest am even a bit desperate, because I think that everything should be working.

Relation hooks are defined for every relation a charm defines in its metadata.\nBeyond those there are two other hooks of interest, the 'upgrade-charm' hook, which is called when a service's charm is upgraded for each of its service units.\nThe other is the 'config-changed' hook, called when a charm which defines a service configuration schema has its configuration changed, since services can be deployed with configuration data, the config-changed hook is also invoked upon the initial deploy of a unit prior to starting it.\nall hooks are optional.\n", "Q: Lowering Compiz memory usage I have been following the updates that appear every week in how they affect the performance and resource usage of Compiz since I installed 11.10 (Right now I am testing 12.04 and 14.04). For what I have seen, the CPU and memory usage have lowered (specially memory). I am comparing installing 12.04/14.04 without any updates and then applying all updates and also comparing 12.04 to 14.04. For example nautilus is using less than 35 MB (For me it was between 70 MB and 150 MB doing the same activities with it several versions ago).\nOther processes have also received some kind of optimizations which have lowered my total memory usage from around 850 MB to 610 MB (I also use services like Apache, MySQL, etc..) but after all of this time, the only one that has stayed almost the same is Compiz. It still uses more than 100MB to start. Only using the desktop with Unity and no other programs running, it takes (right now) 133 MB. What options can I use to lower the memory footprint WITHOUT compromising the stability of Unity (For example removing the OpenGL plugin from Compiz config is a BAD idea).\nWhat optimizations can be done to lower the memory usage of Compiz?\nNOTE - I have Compiz Config Settings Manager (CCSM) installed already.\n\nA: A work around to the compiz memory leak is to:\nsudo kill -HUP <compiz_process_id>\n\nNot a great solution, but it frees up leaked memory without completely killing the process.\n\nA: It is rather difficult in my experience to lower the Compiz memory usage. The best thing I can suggest to lower the texture quality in the OpenGL plugin, but this won't change much afaik.\nAnother source of compiz memory increases can be memory leaks. This seems to sometimes be triggered by indicators, but can be from other sources as well (not sure of them yet).\nMy solution as been to periodically restart unity, using a simple script that contains:\n#kill compiz completely, including all child processes, freeing it's memory:\nkillall -9 compiz & \n#run unity and give you back a free terminal.\nunity & disown \n\nI know this isn't the best of answers, so I'm following this question myself to see if anyone has better tips.\n\nA: I know this is an old post, but Gus's answer helped me and I'd like to add to it. This is what I did (on Ubuntu 12.04):\n\n\n*\n\n*Alt+F2 (run application)\n\n*Scheduled Tasks\n\n*New recurrent task\n\n*killall compiz -HUP\n\n*Every day at 00:00\n\n\nNow compiz will be restarted automatically every night, without having to know the process id. \nMy problem was that if I left my screen locked for a few days, it took ~30 seconds to open the screen lock, and compiz memory usage was around 1000 MB.\n", "Q: 10.04 -> 10.10 - Problem after upgrade So I just upgraded from 10.04 to 10.10 following this method, but now when I'm choosing Ubuntu in my GRUB, the screen with the Ubuntu logo appears for like 2 sec and then my screen just go in \"idle\" mode (the computer is still running) and I can't do anything else than doing a force restart of the machine.\nI tried to launch the Recovery mode, I logged in and when I entered startx same thing happened. \nI really have no idea of what the problem is, so if someone has one, please let me know.\n(I don't know what other details I could give you, so just ask if you need something else)\nEDIT\nI tried the \"Repair broken packages\" option in the \"Recovery mode\" and I get the error that it can't remove fglrx.

I understood that I can create a service that would run and perform certain tasks in the background. But I actually only need to execute a task that needs to be done every 5 minutes. It needs not to run in between.\nNow I was thinking that it may be a better idea to have a crontab entry that runs the (python) download script every 5 minutes. I am new to Linux and may have an incorrect understanding of what cron is for and what good practices are, but to me it seems as if this is a much more stable way because if the script would halt for any reason it will just be re-run.  \nWhat would be the recommended approach in that case? A (well-behaved) daemon that waits 5 minutes, or a cron that runs a script that just stops when done.\n\nA: Cron is the answer for this problem no doubt.  The daemon would be needed if you have something that requires sub-minute wake up times or is completely event driven.  If you have something that needs to run every 5 minutes you should schedule it with Cron and avoid all the daemon complexities.  One thing that I would suggest looking into would to have a lock that will prevent the scripts from running more then one instance at a time.\n", "Q: How can I restore the login screen? I used \"Ubuntu Tweak\" to deactivate the login/users screen in order to save time (with not giving the password). It worked. It was ok. But now i need to create another user. I did create another user and  I went back to \"Ubuntu Tweak\"; i reset the option about showing the login/users screen, but it does not work. After starting up my machine, it goes directly to my account, showing me my desktop.\nHow can i restore the login/users screen?\n(i have tried uninstalling/purging Ubuntu Tweak and reinstalling it, but nothing changed)\n\nA: Open a Terminal window (Ctrl+Alt+T) and run this command (by pasting it into the Terminal and pressing enter):\nsudo mv /etc/gdm/custom.conf /etc/gdm/custom.conf.old\n\nYou may be prompted for your password. As you enter it, you won't see any placeholder characters (like *). That's OK--just type it in and press enter.\nThen when you reboot, you should see the login screen.\nPlease note that this answer does depend on the version of Ubuntu you are running. Ubuntu 11.04 and previous use GDM, so the above technique should work. Later versions of Ubuntu use LightDM instead, so the above technique should not be used with them.\nAlso, if you'd like to be automatically logged in to one user, but want to retain the ability to use another user account, you can do that--you can still log out or switch users, after you've been automatically logged in.\n\nA: I remember having this exact same problem.\nI solved it by going to user accounts, my user account was set to log in automatically - changing this required a password at the next log out.\n\nA: You ca get back the Default Login Screen using Light DM Manager which you can get from hereSimple Light DM Manager\n\n", "Q: Syncing iPhone with Shotwell Is it possible to have Shotwell automatically sync with my iPhone so I have my picture library on both?\n\nA: As far as I'm aware, no free/open source software (including Shotwell) is capable of this.

But it's unlikely to happen (barring some decision to open up on Apple's part.)\n\nA: Shotwell should open automatically when the iPhone is plugged in if you have set it to manage your photos by default, however it only allows you to import photos manually and has no syncing feature AFAIK.\nYou can read details on how to import photos on their site here\n\nA: With Ubuntu 17.04, Shotwell had no trouble importing photos from an iPhone 7.\n\nA: This looks like Shotwell bug not iPhone/Apple restriction because I can use any file browser, open DCIM folder that I see mounted from iPhone and add, copy or delete images from it.\n\nA: I can access documents on the iPhone 6 but I keeps getting: \n\ncould not claim USB devices (-53) \n\nShotwell used to work on previous iOS versions, but current ones prevent it or only partially do it. Sometimes it only gets the latest pictures. It could be encryption in IMG_xxxxx.JPG files. People may have to put your pictures in documents and move them to pictures for the mean time.\nUpdate: Ubuntu has trouble mounting iPhones, it should show up as a separate driving named iPhone: showing a DCIM folder with 101APPLE folder and/or 100APPLE folder containing all of your pictures. \nStill getting I/O errors and USB issues when syncing or copy/transferring what shows up between devices.\n", "Q: Can't log into Ubuntu 11.04 I recently dual booted my PC with Ubuntu 11.04 and Windows 7.

How do I get the user interface back?\n\nA: Your Ubuntu system is having a boot problem well before it gets to the login screen; this is not actually a login problem, specifically.\nSome problems that present in this way can be fixed by reinstalling GRUB2 to the Master Boot Record. You can do that with any of these techniques. If that does not fix the problem, please edit your question to indicate this, and also provide details about what technique you used for reinstalling GRUB2 to the MBR and what happened when you tried (as if it doesn't work, it's possible that your problem is not one that can be fixed this way, but also possible that there was a problem in reinstalling GRUB2 to the MBR).\nBy the way, the advice in this answer also pertains to Ubuntu 11.04.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Customization Kit Error I am trying to use UCK but I got this error when I ran it:\nI ran it from the source (svn repo), not the deb package.\nBuild (/home/joel/uck-2.4.5/uck-gui ) started at 2011-11-25 15:38:56\nsudo: no tty present and no askpass program specified\nBuild ended at 2011-11-25 15:39:17\n\nI chose \"en\" then Yes to all questions and I got this error.

In either case, I use two KDE apps a lot - kile and kate. Since the latest upgrade, I have observed a few problems:\na] I can never use Alt+F to select the file menu (works with other apps), yet when I press Alt, kile's menu comes up in the status bar.\nb] A few times every day, while using kile (haven't used kate as much recently), the keyboard stops responding (just in the 'editor' portion, rather than in structure-tree navigation). I cannot enter any text, but mouse works fine. I usually restart kile to continue working.\nOne inconsistent way to reproduce it (multiple times today): \n\n\n*\n\n*I cut text from one open document using Ctrl+X\n\n*switched to another document in the same kile window using Ctrl+Tab, then this happened.\nc] Sometimes, in kate, I can type in the editor but the keyboard won't work in the File open dialog.\nHow do I fix the above?\n\nA: Sorry, not an answer.  Just something to confirm similar issues with Kile.  However, mine is through KDE for Windows.  Some .tex files won't let me edited them in the editor using the keyboard.  Can't copy paste either, but I can move the cursor around and scroll through the .tex file.  I filed a bug on KDE's website here: https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=292766\n4-30-12:\nAgain, not an answer, but now I am experiencing similar problems with the keyboard input after upgrading from 11.10 to 12.04.  This is really frustrating as documents (.tex files) that worked fine before no longer allow me to type in them.  I can select and scroll with the mouse but no typing!!!!  Funny thing too is that it only happens for a few documents.\n\nA: As the Tools and Settings are side by side, sometimes it's possible to enable \"Read Only Mode\" accidentally instead of selecting something else like \"Define Master Document\". \nSolution :\nGo to Tools > then check if the Read Only Mode is activated. If yes, deactivate it.\n\nA: I was able to solve the problem deleting the kilerc file in .kde/share/config/. This will reset all your Kile settings, but solves the issue describes in the original post.\n", "Q: Add extra shortcuts to the Ubuntu launcher quick keys My problem is that the Ubuntu launcher has shortcut numbers assign to the first 10.

Because on my netbook, 3 finger gestures are working in Gnome Shell, but not in Unity.  Since I wanted to use this kind of gestures in Unity, I looked at its source code and found out that it is Unity itself that is blocking out the 3 fingers gestures.  But it turns out that it's possible to fix it.  I posted detailed instruction on how I did it in the post How can I disable arbitrary default multitouch gestures in Unity?.\nWith these changes, 3 finger taps work right away for me, and are automatically assigned to a middle-click, without the need for a startup program.  Well, it's the reverse of the mapping you're looking for regarding middle clicks and right clicks, but you seem to have gathered enough information so far to handle the switch.\nHowever, you might be interested in a program called touchegg to remap your touches.  It allows you to do many more things than you could do with synconf, such as defining different custom touchpad gestures for your different programs, such as a 3 finger drag to the left or the right to go back or forward in your browser's history.  That's to use that program that I patched Unity in the first place.  And it is very simple to configure.  You can install it by typing\nsudo apt-get install touchegg\n\nCheck out the demonstration video on the website.\nOn a last note, if Unity is for you, as it is for me, the reason why you couldn't use 3 finger gestures, then you will probably have no choice but to re-patch and recompile the unity package when it is updated.\n", "Q: Boot problems w/ External HDD I'm having a problem with booting a live image off of a USB Hard Drive.  I used Startup Disk Creator to make an Ubuntu 11.10 live image on a partition on my external so that I can use it on various computers.  I set it up with ~4GB of persistent data\nSo far I've tried it on two computers.  One, a Dell, will boot to my external but it loads the select boot device very slowly.  It hangs on a screen with an underscore for up to 5 minutes until it allows me to select which drive I want to boot from.  After that, it works great.\nHowever, on my primary computer it doesn't work at all.  It's an Acer from 2009 and it won't even recognize the drive.  I don't see it anywhere in BIOS or the select boot disk list.  The light on the external will come on at boot just fine so I know it's powering it at this time.\nBoth computers worked perfectly with my 4GB flash drive that I had partitioned half and half (1st half FAT32 and second Ubuntu 11.10 live)\n\nA: The problem you are facing is related to hardware, you are using a 2.5 inch external HDD enclosure that has no power source except the power provided by the USB ports.\nMost modern hard disks require a certain amount of power to start spinning that sometimes the USB port is not enough to supply, what is happening in 1 computer is that the spin up is taking a long time but the drive starts on the 2nd computer the drive is not spining up fast enough so the computer does not recognize the drive.\nTo avoid this most drives capable of booting will have an extra power supply that you can use with your disk. Yours, as far as I can see, does not.\n\nA: In my Dell XPS 15, i have two ports which are USB 3.0. \nTrying to boot Ubuntu 11.04 or 11.10 from any type of HDD or usb key won't go ahead.\nHopefully, I have a USB 2.0/e-sata combo in the same laptop.

A while ago, while being on Lubuntu, I made a mistake somewhere in creating a Live USB: by mistake, I installed a Live USB bootloader into /dev/sda3. This didn't result in any problem at that time.\nToday, I updated the kernel. I had to restart Lubuntu. In Grub, Lubuntu suddenly didn't appear anymore, and I booted automatically in Xubuntu.

Replace the example /dev/sdxy statements with the partition that you have installed lubuntu in - for example /dev/sda3\nIf you are unsure which partition you have installed then you can run the Boot-info-script found on SourceForge.\nIn the results look for partitions types of ext4 or ext3 - these are the common Ubuntu filesystems unless you previously elected to use something like btrfs or reiserfs etc.\nKernel reinstallation\nIf the issue is a corrupt kernel installation then you can investigate reinstalling the kernel from a live CD.  This is described in this excellent AskUbuntu Q&A\nBy installing the kernel correctly, Grub should be able to see the Lubuntu installation correctly.\n\nA: Remove the second line (the one starting with echo). You might also have to add a root-parameter to the kernel, like this:\nlinux /boot/vmlinuz root=/dev/sda3\n\nAfter that run update-grub again.\n\nA: You can try using a live cd to boot into the system and then chrooting to the lubuntu system using these commands.\nsudo mkdir /mnt/abc\nsudo mount /dev/sda3 /mnt/abc\nsudo mount ââbind /dev /mnt/abc/dev\nsudo mount ââbind /proc /mnt/abc/proc\nsudo mount ââbind /sys /mnt/abc/sys\nsudo chroot /mnt/abc\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda\n\nI think this would fix your problem, if you don't want to have lubuntu loader in the MBR you can install grub in /dev/sda3 and then use update-grub using xubuntu. That would work.\n\nA: A week ago, I've had the same problem another time, but now I fixed it myself. It turned out that the problem had nothing to do with the LiveUSB-install. What I had to do, was start grub-customizer from Xubuntu, click File, Select Partition, click Next, select Lubuntu's partition, and then click Mount the selected filesystem. I had the option to select submountpoints, but that wasn't necessary. I clicked Apply.\nRight now, I had to check all the checkboxes that were available to be sure that I could start Lubuntu from Grub. Then I clicked File, Save, after that, I clicked File, Install to MBR.\nI rebooted, and I could boot into Lubuntu again, the problem was solved.\nIf this doesn't solve your problem, I'd advice you to use the tools that fossfreedom mentions in another answer below.\n", "Q: Why does update-grub not find ubuntu 11.10?

I have Ubuntu 11.04 on this computer and I want to install Windows 8 Developer Preview English, 64-bit (x64) on it via DVD.  I burned it both using Brasero on Ubuntu and using the standard Mac instructions from the Ubuntu website.  My BIOS refuses to boot off of both DVDs when it boots off other CDs just fine.  How can I do this?\nIf it helps, I have a Windows computer as well.\n\nA: You can test to see if the DVD is bootable by attempting to boot from it on your other computer. If it won't boot on either computer, then it's probably a bad burn (or perhaps the .iso image you downloaded is corrupted). If it does boot on your other computer, then the problem is one of booting your Mac from the DVD. Assuming your Intel Mac can read the DVD and has a 64-bit processor, it should be able to boot from it. (A PPC Mac will, of course, not run the Windows 8 Developer Preview, which is only available for 32-bit and 64-bit x86 architectures.) But that's not an Ubuntu question--you may want to post about that at a Mac support forum (like this one) or (since you're trying to boot Windows 8) a Windows support forum (like this one).\nIf this answer is not sufficient to your needs then you might want a link to the instructions you followed. It sounds from your description that you followed the instructions for burning an Ubuntu CD/DVD; there may be a different procedure that is required for burning a usable Windows 8 Developer Preview disc. You should consult whatever documentation came with Windows 8 Developer Preview.\nIn general, to install the Windows 8 Developer Preview on a machine that already has Ubuntu is not much different from installing any other version of Windows on a machine that already has Ubuntu. Assuming you want to keep Ubuntu, you should boot from an Ubuntu live CD, select Try Ubuntu rather than Install Ubuntu. Run the GParted Partition Editor. (Up to Ubuntu 11.04 this is in System > Administration; in Ubuntu 11.10 and future versions, press super, i.e. the windows key, type gparted, and click on the search result.) In GParted, shrink down the Ubuntu partition -- it's of type ext4 -- to make room for a Windows partition to be created. Apply your changes, quit GParted, and shut down the computer.\nThen boot from the Windows installation CD/DVD or USB flash drive and tell it to create a new partition in the free space you've recently created. Make sure not to tell it to erase the disk or use the whole disk. The specific interface and steps used to tell it what to do will differ from one version of Windows to the next, and may differ between different developer previews and other pre-releases of Windows 8, so you should stay sharp in the installation process. Furthermore, since the Windows 8 Developer Preview is pre-release software, it is especially important to make sure your backups of important files in your Ubuntu system are current (which you should have done anyway, before performing dynamic partition resizing in GParted to make room for the Windows partition).\nSome people manually create NTFS partitions for Windows systems to use, when preparing a machine that already has Ubuntu to have Windows installed. So long as the version of GParted creating the NTFS partition is sufficiently current (as are all versions provided in currently supported Ubuntu releases), this is OK for versions of Windows up through Windows 7. However, this is probably not OK for the Windows 8 Developer Preview and subsequent pre-releases and releases of Windows 8, as they may use a version of NTFS different from the latest version supported by GParted (or perhaps the new Protogon file system).\nFor the same reason, you should not expect that you'll be able to read and write to your Windows 8 Developer Preview partition (or partitions associated with future Windows 8 releases) from within Ubuntu, and you should not expect that mounting it and writing to it can be done without putting the data on it at significant risk.\n", "Q: AMD 6870 Twin Frozr II video adapter issues Hardware: AMD 6870 Twin Frozr II (1GB), ASUS 990 chipset\nSoftware: Ubuntu 11.10\nBuilt a new PC from scratch, loaded it with Ubuntu 11.10.

You should see a list come out. You're looking for the word admin. If that's in there, this isn't your issue.\nThe easiest way to restore your sudo rights is to reboot in recovery mode (hold left-shift at boot, select a recovery mode kernel, boot to the root prompt). Once in there you might be able to run (swap oli for your username) :\nadduser oli admin\n\nBut I've seen some thing that suggest this might not work from a recovery console. Try it.

I am totally new to the world of computer OS installation. I have used Windows softwares like MS Office etc. but never really formatted any PC or installed any OS.

I want my PC to have both the OS.I also want to know whether I can buy a new hard disk and dedicate it fully for Ubuntu. Kindly help.\n\nA: I suggest a safer alternative just to \"have a go\" is Wubi.\nThis has practically zero chance of nuking your Windows install and will let you try out Ubuntu just about as well as installing it natively. It runs on bare metal (that is to say, its not inside a VM) but disk access is a little slower since it has to go through another layer (it translates disk accesses to a file on the Windows filesystem).\nNo repartitioning required, which is probably the most dangerous bit for a new multi-OS user.\nI would say go with Wubi for now and when/if you get a new HD, set it up with dual-boot in mind from the start.\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/ubuntu/windows-installer\n\nA: Here's a great resource: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot\nHopefully that will help you out.  The steps may vary slightly depending on the Ubuntu version you're installing.  And be sure to back up all data you don't want to lose before you install Ubuntu.\n\nA: I've found the best guide to recommend to new installers of Ubuntu is one that documents the process well and also has screen shots to give you an idea of what to expect on the screen as you install the OS.\nThe guide here gives you a very good overview of different types of dual boot installations and is very comprehensive.\nIt hasn't been updated since 10.10 but the Ubuntu installer has not changed that much since then anyway.\nGood Luck with your install!!\n", "Q: Sharing folders between Ubuntu computers fails I am attempting to share files between two computers running 11.10.

Whenever I'm on battery power I get a clicking sound from my hard drive every 5 seconds or so (this does not happen when the laptop is plugged in). I'm dual booting with Windows 7 and I don't get the clicking sound in Windows. \nThe clicking sound stops when I run the command:sudo hdparm -B 254 /dev/sda \nAlso, according to:sudo smartctl -H /dev/sda my hard drive is healthy. \nIs this clicking sound something I can just ignore? Or is it a serious problem and will it eventually damage my computer? If so, how would I fix it?\nI have tried adding hdparm -B 254 /dev/sda to my /etc/rc.local file, but I still run into the clicking problem if my computer boots while plugged in and is then unplugged. Also, I'm finding this fix to be unreliable. Sometimes it works, sometimes it does not. Is this a good solution and is there a better way of doing this? Also, would running my laptop with a -B value of 254 have any negative effects?

There are trade offs to disabling hard drive power management completely, like the hard drive will better survive the shock from a drop were the heads parked.\nProfiling your usage and minimizing disk hits is really the way to go here. Creating a tmpfs to cache things you can afford to lose, like a browser cache, is up to your discretion.\nWRT keeping hdparm parameters consistent across boot and suspend/resume, this is managed by the pm-utils and driven by this script here: /usr/lib/pm-utils/power.d/95hdparm-apm. /etc/hdparm.conf should govern these values per hdparm_options in /lib/hdparm/hdparm-functions. If it doesn't, it's a bug.\n\nhdparm -B\n\n   -B     Get/set Advanced Power Management feature, if the drive supports\n          it.  A  low  value  means aggressive power management and a high\n          value means better performance.  Possible  settings  range  from\n          values  1  through  127 (which permit spin-down), and values 128\n          through 254 (which do not permit spin-down).  The highest degree\n          of  power  management  is  attained with a setting of 1, and the\n          highest I/O performance with a setting of 254.  A value  of  255\n          tells  hdparm to disable Advanced Power Management altogether on\n          the drive (not all drives support disabling it, but most do).\n\n\nA: Sounds like it's trying to park the heads very aggressively. Your hdparm command basically turns it off.\nIf you watch the Load_Cycle_Count value in smartctl, does it increase by one per click? That would support this theory.\nIt is quite possible that it is shortening the life of your drive, it is stressing moving parts more than they need to be after all. I would put the hdparm command in /etc/rc.local - you can fiddle with the -B value from 0 to 254. 127 is the highest that will let the drive spin down (see man hdparm).\nIn my experience HDs don't really get a chance to spin down in Linux anyway because syslogd is always writing something or other about cron or whatever.\n\nA: Check in software center or synaptics if you have laptop mode tools installed. If so you can change the above mentioned settings to 254 when on battery by editing the file /etc/laptop-mode/laptop-mode.conf. To edit this file go to the terminal and type gksudo gedit, and navigate to the file and than change and save the settings. I cant provide a screenshot as I dont want to install this programm.\nAnother possibility is to modify the file etc/hdparm.conf by adding the following at the end of the script:\n/dev/sda {\n    apm = 254           # power\n    apm_battery = 254   # battery\n    spindown_time = 0   # no spin down\n}\n\n\nA: This problem has been around for ages (at least a couple of years). \nThe reason of the problem is the following:\n- Due to power saving settings while running on battery several types of hard disks park their heads very soon after the last access (that makes the click)\nNow several services, AFAIK including the kernel itself (ext3), are programmed without the goal of saving energy, they try to access the hard disk every, say, 10 seconds, which unparks the heads again - Even if nothing has changed at all. And here we go, \nthe load cycle count increases rapidly.\nDue to the fact that this is no issue on desktops and servers nobody of the coders involved gives a t... ;)\nThe hdparm fix sets the powersaving timers to much higher values, therefore not parking heads at all.

Otherwise, the files may be taken to have a different meaning.\nsources.list\nFrom man sources.list (1):\n\nNAME\n         sources.list - Package resource list for APT\nDESCRIPTION\nThe package resource list is used to locate archives of the package\n  distribution system in use on the\n         system. At this time, this manual page documents only the packaging system used by the Debian GNU/Linux\n         system. This control file is /etc/apt/sources.list.\nThe source list is designed to support any number of active sources\n  and a variety of source media. The\n         file lists one source per line, with the most preferred source listed first. The format of each line\n         is: type uri args The first item, type determines the format for args.  uri is a Universal Resource\n         Identifier (URI), which is a superset of the more specific and well-known Universal Resource Locator,\n         or URL. The rest of the line can be marked as a comment by using a #.\nSOURCES.LIST.D\nThe /etc/apt/sources.list.d directory provides a way to add\n  sources.list entries in separate files. The\n         format is the same as for the regular sources.list file. File names need to end with .list and may only\n         contain letters (a-z and A-Z), digits (0-9), underscore (_), hyphen (-) and period (.) characters.\n         Otherwise APT will print a notice that it has ignored a file if the file doesn't match a pattern in the\n         Dir::Ignore-Files-Silently configuration list - in this case it will be silently ignored...\n\nsources.list.save\nThe .list.save files are some kind of work/backup files:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=614398\n\n*https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apt/+bug/611925\nLinks:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://manpages.ubuntu.com/\n\nA: As a complement to user26687's answer:\nYes, any file inside /etc/apt/sources.list.d must have a .list extension otherwise apt will print a warning message and ignore the file, except if file matches a pattern in apt's Dir::Ignore-Files-Silently option.\nThe Software Sources GUI creates a .list.save for each .list file it manages, as a kind of \"backup\" file. The LP bug 611925 mentioned is from 2010, when apt did not silently ignore .save files yet, and as such generated a lot of warnings.\nThis behavior was fixed in apt version 0.8.3ubuntu1 in 2010 for LP bug 631770:\napt (0.8.3ubuntu1) maverick; urgency=low\n\n  * merged fixes from debian-sid\n  * debian/rules:\n    - put ubuntu-archive.gpg back into the package (LP: #620576)\n  * apt-pkg/init.cc:\n    - ignore \".distUpgrade\" and \".save\" files in sources.list.d\n      (LP: #631770)\n\nSince then such files are silently ignored by apt by default. You can see all such patterns with:\napt-config dump | grep Dir::Ignore-Files-Silently::\n\nSo files like .save, .bak, .orig, among others, are also accepted (and ignored) in /etc/apt/sources.list.d\n\nA: You have not mentioned the problem you are having. But to answer your query there has to be one file at /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ for every repository, and there are often two. The required one will end with *.list and the optional one will end with *.list.save (this file is auto-generated by some GUI repository managers).

The applications are not requesting any more than 3092 so the kernel is using the rest for cache and buffers. As your applications need more memory, the kernel will reduce the cache to accommodate the new application requirements. \nTweaking the MySQL and Apache configuration for optimal performance depends on the application.

I've Ubuntu Server 11.04. I want to update packages but not the core.\nFor example, I installed subsonic with apt-get. And I see there is a new version. I could install it manually by downloading the archive and using dpkg. But hey, its better to learn how to use new tricks.\nP.S. apt-get upgrade will not list subsonic. Why?\n\nA: Most of your installed software (not including Subsonic) is provided by configured software sources (also called repositories) from which software is automatically downloaded and installed by the package manager. Running these commands will upgrade all such software to the latest versions provided in your configured software sources:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nSee the apt-get manpage for explanation of specifically what those commands do. (Also accessible on your machine via man apt-get.)\nHowever, Subsonic was not installed in this way. Following these instructions, you manually downloaded the installer package (.deb file) for Subsonic, and installed it by manually invoking the dpkg command with the -i flag. Unlike most software for Ubuntu, Subsonic doesn't have a software source you can set up to provide it, so that's the way you have to install it. To upgrade it to a later version, simply download the newest .deb file (or whatever version you want to upgrade to) and follow those same installation instructions (with the new .deb file).\nSince Subsonic is not automatically upgraded with the rest of the software on your system (via apt-get), you'll have to take care to remain current on issues that affect it so that you know when security vulnerabilities are discovered and when they are patched (i.e., when a new version is released to fix the vulnerability). In practice, all network server software of greater than an extremely minimal degree of complexity has multiple security vulnerabilities, which are discovered (and hopefully also fixed) from time to time.\nSometime in the future, you may have the preferable alternative of using a non-official software source (of a kind called a PPA) for Subsonic. You would then receive updates to Subsonic along with updates to the rest of the software on your system (via apt-get). However, currently the Subsonic PPA is empty and does not provide any software.\n", "Q: How do I make the Caps Lock key a third Shift key? How do I make the Caps Lock key work just like another Shift key? \nThere are loads of questions here about reassigning it, or having it launch a custom command. I just want it to work like another Shift key. I don't want any other keys to change what they do, just that one.\nKeyboard Layout/Caps Lock key behavior won't do it, I don't understand how to remap it in CCSM.\nI'm using a UK keyboard now but I learned to type on a US keyboard, the smaller left Shift key is DRIVING ME NUTS.\n\nA: Ignoring my previous attempts at answering that failed, I found something that turns capslock completely into left shift. No toggling, I think it's persistent, and it's pretty simple.\nFirst, I'd recommend making a backup, before I introduce how to change it.\nRun sudo cp /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/pc ~/pckeybak\nNow that there's a backup, let's get to the editing.\nUse your favorite text editor to edit this file as root:\n/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/pc\n\nFind the segment that looks like this (it's near the top, line 22 for me):\nkey  <TAB> {    [ Tab,  ISO_Left_Tab    ]   };\nkey <RTRN> {    [ Return                ]   };\n\nkey <CAPS> {    [ Caps_lock             ]   };\nkey <NMLK> {    [ Num_Lock              ]   };\n\nedit \nkey <CAPS>  {   [ Caps_lock             ]   };\n\nto be \nkey <CAPS> {    [ Shift_L, Caps_Lock    ]   };\n\ninstead. (The Caps_Lock after Shift_L, may be unnecessary.)\nRestart your display manager (usually sudo service lightdm restart) and capslock will now be left shift. (Note: My test machine uses GNOME, so I had to restart gdm. However, that caused some weird flickering in the fallback TTY, and gdm never restarted. I had to completely reboot.)\nThis one I was actually able to test, and can confirm it works.\nAdapted from Permanent xmodmap in Ubuntu 13.04\n\nA: For 14.04\nA one-liner: \nxmodmap -e 'keycode 66=Shift_L'\n\nBUT, in the unexpected case 66 is not the correct keycode, first run xev in console and press CapsLock. Then you will see something like:\nKeyPress event, serial 27, synthetic NO, window 0x1200001,\n    root 0x101, subw 0x0, time 6417361, (340,373), root:(342,393),\n    state 0x0, keycode XX (keysym 0x0207, Caps_Lock), same_screen YES,\n    XLookupString gives 0 bytes: \n    XmbLookupString gives 0 bytes: \n    XFilterEvent returns: False\n\nThe correct keycode is the one indicated in the XX.\n\nA: Expanding on @Zacharee1 answer:\nmake a backup with cp /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/pc ~/pckeybak\nthen edit with gksu gedit /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/pc or your favorite editor.\nFind the line (22) that says:\nkey <CAPS> {   [ Caps_Lock     ]   };\nand change it to \nkey <CAPS> {   [ Shift_L       ]   };\nand the line (36) that says:\nmodifier_map Lock   { Caps_Lock };\nand change it to \n//modifier_map Lock   { Caps_Lock }; (which should comment it out in effect disabling the locking) \nTesting indicates that the Num Lock still works as expected. Further testing indicates that the keyboard indicator lights appear to be a bit dyslexic in 16.04 on even an unmodified system. Scroll Lock indicator on at login but Scroll lock off and Num Lock light off, but Num lock on. Tapping the left Ctrl key  seems to resolve this behaviour and I'm not sure if it's related to my use of a KVM switch (which is possible)\nNote: Further testing shows that the NumLock indicator light is flaky even without a KVM switch and has to be tapped twice to get back in sync with NumLock If you always leave it on you can ignore the light or if it bothers you you can tap it twice to get it back in sync. Why this occurs is likely a basis for a new question...\nAnother simple solution to your original problem would be to simply obtain an inexpensive US keyboard and use the US keyboard mapping.\nSources: @Zacharee1 answer and analysis of /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/pc and trial and error testing\n\nA: You can get there by adapting How to change CapsLock key to produce âaâ? (for example).\nRemove the Lock (= Caps Lock) modifier from the Caps Lock key, and declare that this key sends the Shift_L keysym.\nremove Lock = Caps_Lock\nkeysym Caps_Lock = Shift_L\n\nAlternatively, you could remove the Lock modifier and add the Shift modifier.\nremove Lock = Caps_Lock\nadd Shift = Caps_Lock\n\nEither way, these lines go into the file ~/.Xmodmap. Test by loading it with xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap; the file is read automatically when you log in under the default environment (or at least it was in the Gnome days).\n", "Q: What's the maximum filename length in encrypted ext4 partition?

I am new to ubuntu so please be specific.\n\nA: Open System Settings and go to \"Power\"\nand change when lid is closed to \"do nothing\"\nsee screenshot:\nBTW, the power settings are now stored in dconf, that means you would have to use dconf-editor and go to org/gnome/settings/daemon/plugins/power to change the settings.  However, that wouldn't make any difference in your case.\n\nA: GConf is being replaced with DConf. Install http://apt.ubuntu.com/p/dconf-tools and then run donf-editor.

There is no plug-in for Dolphin to provide integration there yet, though. When you upgrade to 12.04, you can simply run the following command, and it will install everything you need.\n\nsudo apt-get install ubuntuone-control-panel-qt\n\nYou may still need to have gnome-keyring-daemon running, if kwallet in 12.04 doesn't implement the freedesktkop.org secrets API as gnome-keyring does.\nThere was a FAQ or Tutorial on the Ubuntu Wiki about this, but I can't seem to find it right now, unfortunately.\n\nA: Note that you do not even need to use the Konsole to install ubuntuone-control-panel-qt.\nIn Kubuntu 13.10 and the latest builds for 14.04, you can use Muon Discover (under Start > Computer) to find Ubuntu One (actually twice, side by side) in the category of System and Settings. Look for the orange box.\nIt does not add the check boxes to Dolphin the way it does to Nautilus, but it does 'just work' for me.\n", "Q: How to install a Logitech c310 webcam? I bought a new Logitech C310 webcam. I don't know how to install it on Ubuntu. I am trying to install this software through the terminal window.\nwine /media/LWS_2_0/Setup.exe\n\nbut its showing as \nfixme:ole:TLB_ReadTypeLib Header type magic 0x00905a4d not supported.\nerr:ole:TLB_ReadTypeLib Loading of typelib L\"Z:\\\\media\\\\LWS_2_1\\\\MSetup.exe\" failed with error 0\n\nand it opens a window with data as\n\nWe have detected you have connected your webcam to a USB1.1 port,for\n  the best performance and full feature set,we suggest using a USB2.0\n  port\n\nI tried this all the USB ports available in my system. It's showing the same error.\nPlease tell me how to install this webcam on ubuntu 11.10.\nThanks for reading.\nEdit:\nThe cam is working with all softwares like cheese which are available in Software Center, but the main problem is the webcam consists of controllers and effects by default along with the webcam if we install the Software got along with the webcam. I already installed the same webcam on Windows. It's working fine with all effects and controllers like zoom out zoom in and pixel range selection, wide screen or standard and all these. But in Ubuntu it's just working without any control of those. If I want to go for 720p or 480p its not getting possible here. So this is the problem i got with this in Ubuntu.\nDoes anyone know how it is possible to add those controls in Ubuntu?\n\nA: What you want is to use software that comes with webcam, that can't be done since that software is made for windows (by Logitech decision), not Linux. However there is good software for Linux, for example guvcview:\nsudo apt-get install guvcview\n\n\nA: I don't think that using the Windows installer will help. If you have Cheese installed on your system, check if you can see video. Here's other that have gotten this to work by plugging it in:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1688464\n\nA: This webcam should work out of the box in Ubuntu, you don't need to install anything, install a webcam program like Cheese (Click to install) and try it out.\n\nA: The main problem for me is that you are using a USB 2.0 device on USB 1.1 ports.\nAre you using a USB hub or alike ?\nCan you post the output of lsusb please ?\nIn terminal\nlsusb\n\nI agree with Mordoc and Jorge about the software.\nYou can also check if the driver is loaded using :lsmod|grep pwc\nPwc is a driver widely used for Logitech webcams.\nFinally, here is a question about this webcam and Ubuntu containing links to compatibilty and usage questions.\nIs the Logitech C310 webcam compatible?\n\nA: Logitech is NOT compatible with Linux: however, it will work as a cam, but very few features. gcuviewer should be able to control it tho: i use a AF orb with  guvcview and it has full controls available. \nBut under wine, theres no way to get past the error in setting up the control program. I've spoken to support at logitech. They seemed surprised it worked at all on a Linux system, especially one like Puppy [i use Lucid, compatible with Ubuntu] The problem isn't the camera, its the program. But the  guvcview will give you full control.\n", "Q: original silverlight in ubuntu?

It is possible the website you are trying to use is protected by this DRM scheme.\n", "Q: How can I add the 'shutdown' and 'restart' buttons in favorites in Gnome Shell? I recently switched from Unity (Ubuntu 11.10) to the Gnome Shell. It took some tweaking to have it all to my liking, but one thing keeps bothering me: I cannot find the 'shutdown' and 'restart' buttons in applications anymore, let alone place them in favorites! \nIn unity this was a piece of cake. i just opened the Dash home and searched for 'shutdown' or 'restart', and I could easily drag the buttons to the unity favorites on the left of the desktop.\nAny thoughts on why Gnome doesn't even list these applications anymore? And how to fix it?\n\nA: Shutdown or Restart are not listed in applications because they're not. If you want to shutdown/Restart, click on the user menu and hold ALT, you will see the shutdown button appear, from where you will be able to either restart or shutdown. Another option would be to use a GNOME extension that puts the shutdown and restart buttons directly in the user menu without having to press ALT.\n\nA: The reason you can't find those .desktops in gnome-shell is because of the line in the.desktop\nOnlyShowIn=Unity;\n\nDon't have Gs installed but you could try any number of things. \nEdit the line to \nOnlyShowIn=GNOME;Unity;\n\nRemove the line entirely\nCopy the 2 desktops to your home directly, then remove the line entirely, ex. - below is one complete command, copy & paste into a terminal\nmkdir -pv ~/.local/share/applications; \\\ncp /usr/share/applications/indicator-session-restart.desktop ~/.local/share/applications; \\\ngedit ~/.local/share/applications/indicator-session-restart.desktop\n\nThen edit out the line & it's space, save.\nI'd go with the copy & edit method for both so after above - \ncp /usr/share/applications/indicator-session-shutdown.desktop ~/.local/share/applications; \\\ngedit ~/.local/share/applications/indicator-session-shutdown.desktop\n\nYou may need to do a log out/in after\n\nA: If you go to Gnome Extensions using Firefox (Chrome/Epiphany and other webkit based browsers do not work yet) and look for the Alternative Status Menu extension. Click the on/off button to the left and you will now have Suspend/Hibernate and Power Off as separate items in the menu.\nAs for why they choose to do things this way, I get the impression that programmers/developers (the Gnome Devs anyway) prefer to suspend their machines then come straight back and resume where they left off. But for the home user (most users!?) it is a strange choice. The above extension sorted it for me.\nHope that helps\n", "Q: Logging of installation of packages How can I log the installation of packages in Ubuntu? I want to send a message to log every time after a package is installed, like, \"Package Installed\" with the name of package & it should do that after uninstalling too. Is this possible? I am logging all this in a file called \"Local3.log\".  \n\nA: It appears that apt logs this data here:\n/var/log/apt/term.log\nThis blog had this and more info on package logging:\nhttp://tech.zhenhua.info/2010/11/package-installation-log-on-ubuntu-dpkg.html\n\nA: Yes you can do it. (You can use /var/log/apt/history.log* files or the method below)\nFirst you have to create a shell script named apt-get(as shown below)\nThen you have to add it to your PATH variable. You can do it by adding it to the /etc/profile for example if your script is located in /home/ankur/ you have to add a line to /etc/profile like the line below.\nexport PATH=/home/ankur/:$PATH\nNow whenever you execute apt-get our script executes first\n(This might not be the perfect script)\napt-get\n #!/bin/bash\nif [ $1 = \"install\" ] || [ $1 = \"remove\" ] || [ $1 = \"purge\" ];\nthen\n    sudo /usr/bin/apt-get $*\n    echo $* >> /home/ankur/Local3.log\nelse\n    /usr/bin/apt-get $*\nfi\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 11.10 not starting in Graphical mode?

only as usable.\nAs per chat with fossfreedom, I tried removing the 1GB sticks and just keep the new 2GB sticks in it and booted from it. The system still showed 3.2GB of RAM. I even moved them to a single channel and still it showed 3.2GB of RAM.\nAnd if it helps, 1GB sticks are from the same manufacturer - Corsair (infact a dual channel memory kit) and the newer 2GB sticks are from the same manufacturer - Kingston.\nI was also adviced to upgrade BIOS but since it detects full 6GB of RAM, I doubt it has anything to do with that. BIOS release notes don't mention anything that fixes the problem. Here is the PDF - http://downloadmirror.intel.com/17520/eng/MQ_1761_ReleaseNotes.pdf (My BIOS version - 1687)\nThe only options I see in BIOS is of changing the frequency on which the RAM is running and the latency. Screenshot follows:\n\nAny idea what's going on here?\n\nA: Your RAM modules are compatible with the board but the memory frequency is what the limiting factor is - and that is why you only have 3.2GB available to the operating system, 800MB is reserved for the motherboard system graphics.\nYour intel board only supports 4 GB maximum total system memory using DDR2 800 DIMMs according to the product spec page from intel \nThe product numbers of both brands of RAM modules NT2GT64U8HD0BY-AD and OCZ2N800SR1G listed in your lshw output indicate they are PC2-6400 modules at 800MHz.\nIt appears from your screenshot that your bios is limiting the memory frequency to 667MHZ and does show them being 800MHz modules.\nThe reason you can see 6GB of RAM installed via lshw is because Ubuntu is listing all the hardware installed on your system - not what is in use.\nTo allow your board to use more RAM you need to purchase modules rated at 533 or 667MHZ - then you will be able to use up to 8GB.\n", "Q: How do I get Liferea 1.8 RC to use the global application menu? I just updated Liferea from 1.6 to 1.8 RC thru PPA.\nAfter the update Liferea disappeared from Unitys Global Message indicator in the top menu.\nAlso there is no standalone icon in Unity. In Gnome classic Liferea 1.8 RC shows an icon in the top Menu. I have the status \"icon in notifier\" option activated in the settings.\nDoes anyone know if it is possible to get Liferea to show up again in Unity.\n\nA: Firstly as for the menu issue, Liferea sometimes does not show a menu in the global menu. I'm not sure why, but restarting it usually fixes the problem for me.\nAs for the icon, you can't get one in Unity unless you whitelist liferea in the systray.\nSee:\n\n\n*\n\n*One line command for adding new items to com.canonical.Unity.Panel systray-whitelist\n\n*How do I access and enable more icons to be in the system tray?\nIf you know how to contact the liferea developers, please let them know you would like them to support Ubuntu (and appindicators).\n\nEvery voice matters in cases like this, where the developers have chosen not to do something because \"we don't use Ubuntu so we don't care\". Adding an application indicator for Liferea should be pretty easy, and wouldn't introduce any problems, but they won't do it unless they feel they have a reason.\n", "Q: \"VLC could not read the file\" error when trying to play DVDs I can watch most DVD's on my machine using VLC but today, I went to watch Thor, and it won't play.\n\n\n*\n\n*libdvdread4 and libdvdcss2 are at the latest versions. \n\n*vlc -v returns 1.1.4\n\n*w32codecs are installed and reinstalled\n\n*ubuntu-restricted-extras are same as above\n\n\nMy machine recognises the disc and I can open the folder and browse the assorted .vob files, of which there are many.

I just can't watch THOR, and I'm pretty confident that the disc is ok. It is a rental, but it's clean and there are no surface abrasions. I even cleaned it with Christian Dior aftershave to make sure. \n\nA: That title has structure protection & is the likely cause of your problem with playback. The protection isn't an issue with the latest couple of libdvdnav4 releases but it appears it is with the version provided in lucid.\nAssuming your drive is /dev/dvd, if unsure you could run this & check the /dev/ links\nsudo lshw -C disk\n\nLook for the section *-cdrom, if it shows /dev/dvd then use below command, if it says /dev/dvd1 then adjust, you could also use the /dev/srX instead where X is usually 0 or 1\nIf you are in region 1 then the main movie is title 24 so this may work, - \nvlc dvdsimple:///dev/dvd@24 \n\ncommand means -  dvdsimple:// (no menus), /dev/dvd (device), @ title number\n(starting in vlc-1.2 the @ is now a #)\nOtherwise it's quite possible you can upgrade libdvdnav4 & libdvdread4 to newer versions, there are no real dependency issues. I don't have a lucid install to d. check but shouldn't be an issue.\nIf so you need to upgrade both packages at the same time, I'd use the 11.10 packages. If you wish to let me know, I'll edit in how.\nEDIT: - realized I had a lucid iso so did a quick boot to live session to check out. You may not be able to play Thor with the above method though it could be handy for some other structure protected disks. I went ahead & upgraded the libdvdread/nav libs & you should then have no issue with Thor. \nIn some cases even with the newer libs you may have to resort to playing by going directly to the main movie title, Cars2 is an example of that, Thor should be fine as normal\nTo upgrade 10.04 to newer libdvdread/nav\nWill use the 11.10 packages, one could use the 12.04 though 11.10 will suffice.\nOpen a terminal, run this command, then leave the terminal open\nsudo apt-get remove libdvdread-dev; mkdir dvd_fix; cd dvd_fix\n\nThen go to these pages, pick your arch, right click on the top listed mirror > save link as, save into dvd_fix folder (it's in your home dir.\nhttp://packages.ubuntu.com/km/oneiric-updates/libdvdread4\nhttp://packages.ubuntu.com/km/oneiric/libdvdnav4\nOnce both packages are downloaded & in the dvd_fix folder run this in the still open terminal\nsudo dpkg -i *.deb\n\nthat will upgrade you & disk should play\nIf you need or think you may need the libdvdread/nav dev files for building related sources \nWe'll do this way to avoid possible broken packages - do AFTER the above is done\nIn your dvd_fix folder create a new folder named devs\nGo to these 2 pages & download the -dev packages to the dvd_fix/devs folder like before\nhttp://packages.ubuntu.com/oneiric-updates/libdvdread-dev\nhttp://packages.ubuntu.com/oneiric/libdvdnav-dev\nWhen or if you need the dev packages installed then just open that folder, right click on libdvdread-dev & install with gdebi. Then do the same for libdvdnav-dev, do libdvdread-dev first\n\nA: in addition, we need to install the QUICKTIME -lib and -util via Synaptic. this solved my problem why commercial dvd in China would not play.\n", "Q: How I type @ with a Latin American keyboard?

I want to configure bind9 using the Ubuntu terminal to have the DNS resolve a local name, not a domain name.\nFor example, if I type in Nicole it will resolve my IP address in a local network fashion.\nHow can I do this, step-by-step please? \nI've already installed bind9 using:\nsudo apt-get install bind9\n\nIt's fully installed now, I just need some help configuring. \nShould I be using local views?\nI am going to do the connection with two laptops probably connected to each other by Ethernet cable or WIFI. One of them is running Ubuntu and the other is running Windows. I not sure if that's part of the problem.\n\nA: If you want to connect only 2 machines, I think easier and better using local hosts files instead of DNS.\nMake the router DHCP give always the same IP to the machines (or use fixed IP instead of DHCP). On the ubuntu machine, you can edit the file with sudo nano /etc/hosts and add a line like 192.168.xxx.xxx <the_other_computer_name> where the IP is the local IP of the other computer and another line similar with the local machine name and IP.\nDo the same on the windows machine (the host file is \\windows\\system32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts)\n\nA: If you are trying to learn about using Bind9 and would like to still set it up I would recommend that you follow this post in the Ubuntu Forums. \n", "Q: Set virtual console keymap on Live(CD|USB)? How can I change the keymap of the CtrlAlt+(F1toF6) virtual consoles on the LiveUSB/CD image? \nI've tried picking my layout (US Dvorak) from the F3 menu when it first starts to boot, but that only sets the GUI Keymap and not the virtual console keymap. This is especially frustrating because of a bug in the Driver for my Video card (Neauvou) that will completely freeze the system if I do too much (seems to be related to fast cursor movement; for example, holding down backspace or arrow key in gnome-terminal). This makes me want to use the virtual consoles, but then they are the wrong layout and therefore hard to type on.\n\nA: Please read this. In short, you can remap the keys using the loadkeys command. For example:\nsudo su -\necho control keycode 2 = Console_1 | loadkeys -\n\nwill add a binding to Ctrl - 1 such that it now switches to the first tty.

I am thinking of buying Samsung Galaxy S2 and I was thinking is there a Linux operating system for smart phones? I have been using Ubuntu for years and I would like to continue use Ubuntu on my smart phone as well.\n\nA: Mark Shuttleworth recently announced a plan to develop smartphones and tablets with Ubuntu, but the tentative goal is to achieve this by 2014.\nHowever, Android is running a modified Linux kernel, and you can write apps for Android, particularly in Java. There are also official Ubuntu One apps for Android: a file syncing app, with an option to automatically upload photos from your phone camera; and a music syncing app for use with the Ubuntu One music store.\n\nA: Buying a Galaxy S2 is already buying a smartphone with linux. Android itself is a linux operating system, and is quite good indeed. But if you want something different, try Meego (actually now called tizen), but be careful, for I don't know if It can run on the S2\n\nA: Samsung showed a demo of the Linux based Tizen operating system running on a Galaxy S2 HD at the Tizen Developer Conference in May 2012:\nhttp://www.ubergizmo.com/2012/05/tizen-on-samsung-galaxy-s2-hd/\nThe Ubuntu for Android program http://www.ubuntu.com/devices/android seems to be open to operators or companies cooperating with Canonical at the moment, but I haven't seen any devices being sold with that software installed.\nSamsung will release Tizen based devices in 2013, and rumors are that they will be based on the Galaxy S3 hardware.\n", "Q: Can I open Peazip files on windows operating system? Can I open peazip files with winrar or winzip on Windows operating system? If they can not be open is there a way to create rar and zip files that can be open on Linux and Windows operating systems?\n\nA: Yes you can open .zip, .rar, .tar, etc. files in Ubuntu just fine. And create said files that will open in Windows.\n\nA: Peazip is both available for Windows and Linux so any files that you create with Peazip in Ubuntu can be used in Windows.\nAs an alternative you can also create files in .zip and .rar formats with many popular compression tools in Ubuntu that can be opened in similar tools for Windows.\n\nA: Yes, you can integrate Peazip files with Windows by doing the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*To send input objects to a indicated function, just right-click on any group of objects then use the Peazip entries in \"SendTo\" menu.\n\n*Drag the object or group of objects on Peazip icon. It will automatically choose the objects you provided.\n\n*Drag objects on your open Peazip so you can have full access to the process.\n\n*Double-click on your Pezip file types to open it.\n\n\nYou can re-arrange the application's system integration in the configuration tools in Options> System integration that requires administrative rights if really needed. Or by simply selecting Custom installation/configuration in the installer to open more options.\nFor more information, you can visit Peazip's site\n", "Q: Why can Ubuntu Tweak bring icons back, and GConf editor not? I was missing icons from menus in Ubuntu 11.10. I tried enabling them by setting menus_have_icons to true in GConf editor, as various answers on this site mention. However, that didn't work.\nThen I tried Ubuntu Tweak, and it did work. What is that program doing differently?\n\nA: There are many big changes in 11.10. Among them is a new configuration system, called DConf. This replaces GConf, but the transition is not complete among all apps. You may wish to install and explore dconf-editor from the dconf-tools package. It is very similar to gconf-editor, except that many keys have gotten new names. You should be able to figure it out. For instance, if something used to be found in /apps/gnome/something, it may now be found in /org/gnome/something. \n\nA: Gnome3 (as used by Ubuntu 11.10) uses DConf instead of GConf you need to use dconf-editor (package dconf-tools) and set org.gnome.desktop.interface.menus-have-icons\n\nA: gnome-tweak-tool is also capable of managing a lot of these settings.\n\nA: Those settings are likely now in dconf, viewed/set thru dconf-editor or set thru gsettings\norg.gnome.desktop.interface in dconf-editor (install dconf-tools\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface menus-have-icons true\n\n", "Q: How to get OpenSSH to use ksshaskpass under KDE? When using a GNOME desktop on Ubuntu, if I use OpenSSH client to connect to another computer (running from the gnome-terminal), I get a single graphic popup asking for my private key's pass-phrase. After that I no longer need to enter my pass-phrase as it is cached by the SSH agent.\nUnder KDE it doesn't work like that - when I start ssh from konsole, I get a text prompt for my pass-phrase every single time, even though ssh-agent is running. \nIf I run ssh-add from the terminal then I can enter my pass-phrase on the terminal and it will be stored by ssh-agent and I won't get any more pass-phrase prompts, while if I run ssh-add the KRunner graphical command line (\"Run\" dialog) then I get a graphical prompt with the same behavior. The problem is I have to remember running ssh-add every time I log in to the desktop.\nHow can I get ssh to behave under KDE, the same as it does on GNOME - the first time the pass-phrase is needed, pop up a graphical dialog and store the pass-phrase in the agent. \nI've installed ksshaskpass, but that didn't change anything.\n\nA: I don't know the internals so to explain why in GNOME it works and in KDE it doesn't, but I can suggest a solution.\nDefine a function like the following in your ~/.bashrc:\nssh() {\n    if ! ssh-add -l &>/dev/null; then\n        ssh-add </dev/null &>/dev/null\n    fi\n    command ssh \"$@\"\n}\n\ni.e., if the agent has no key stored already (! ssh-add -l), then call it with input from /dev/null: this is to convince ssh-add has no terminal, and force to ask the password with a GUI window. \nYou could set the SSH_ASKPASS environment variable to point to a different application to ask for the password.\n", "Q: grub update making automated install stuck I am following these instructions- https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticSecurityUpdates on Ubuntu 10.04 LTS Server 64 bit. \nThe problem is that when the update script is executed, it gets stuck because GRUB is asking a question \"You chose not to install GRUB to any devices. If you continue, the boot loader may not be properly configured, and when this computer next starts up it will use whatever was previously in the boot sector\" \nHow do I make automated install work? Is there a way to blacklist a particular update to a package. \n\nA: Reconfigure the grub-pc package\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure -plow grub-pc\n\nWhen asked about the partition or disk to install Grub to, choose one, or just skip the options and click OK if you don't want Grub to be installed anywhere.\n\nThen check the options\ndebconf-show grub-pc\n\nYou should see the key grub-pc/install_devices set to the disk/partition you've chosen, or grub-pc/install_devices_empty set to true if you chose not to install Grub.\n\nThen if you test this by reinstalling the package\nsudo apt-get --reinstall install grub-pc\n\nyou should not be asked any You chose not to install GRUB to any devices questions anymore.\n\nA: I don't have enough clout on AskUbuntu to post a comment; so this is going in as a solution.  You can do what @arrange said to do via command line with: \necho \"SET grub-pc/install_devices /dev/sda\" | debconf-communicate\nJust put that at the top of your script, and it won't ask you for input anymore.  Incidentally, that also saves you from having your terminal garbled so that it looks like it's written in Klingon if your bash script does miraculously blow through the grub config curses menu.\n", "Q: How can I run Ubuntu One on Xubuntu? \nPossible Duplicate:\nUbuntu One for Xfce or Xubuntu? \n\nI installed Ubuntu One on my Xubuntu oneiric, but when starting the program nothing happens.

This works for me.\n\nA: You can install ubuntuone-client and that should pull in all the necessary packages to do file sync. You do not want to install ubuntuone-client-gnome. That will pull in a lot of Gnome stuff, like Nautilus, that you do not want.\nYou will want to become familiar with the command line tool u1sdtool.

When I attempted to copy a file (of size, ) over the network using scp I get a error <file> stalled\nWhy does this happen? How do I resolve it?\n\nA: This happens because scp is trying to grab as much bandwidth as possible, and any delay (by a firewall, etc.) can stall it. Limiting the bandwidth (with -l option) will fix it.\nFor example, you might want to limit the bandwidth to 1 MB/s (= 8192 Kbits/s):\n scp -l 8192 <file> <destination>\n\nSource: http://www.aixmind.com/?p=1371 - Wayback Machine\n\nA: I've managed to solve it by using rsync:\nrsync -avz -e \"ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null\" --progress /tmp/bigfile.txt user@host.com:/tmp/\n\n\nA: Any chance you're behind a Cisco ASA firewall? If so, turn off \"sequence number randomization\" and that'll help a lot -- also disable TCP Offload (ethtool -K $INTERFACE tso off gso off gro off) if you're on a Cisco ASA with Broadcom NICs in your server.\n\nA: Given the error message that we received when the scp stalled I suspected that it was the encryption that was failing.\n\"The authenticity of host 'myserver (10.10.11.12)' can't be established.\nECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:+zkyskXlxVQ0kRorLW26pzprIYbsM4N3hbaDLz1RNpo\"\nWith that in mind I ran \"scp -c aes128-ctr /tmp/test.dan/bigfile.src myserver:/tmp/bigfile\".   scp WAS successful with the alternate cipher.

Why? And if there is difference: What is it? \nThanks! \n\nA: To be perfectly honest, I don't think there's any meaningful difference between the two. You can use whichever one you're most comfortable with.\n\nA: I use in or on Ubuntu. Never under. Under is for oppressive operating systems where the users are under lock and key, and where processes sometimes performs illegal instructions and must be placed under arrest. \nExcept for the connotative differences, in, on and under are all correct. But don't use under. We are over that. :) \nBut seriously; we refer to Ubuntu as a platform and an environment. You don't place things under a platform, but on it, and you don't place something under an environment, but in it. I see no good reason to use the word under in this context at all.\n", "Q: How to move all installed programs from my computer to another computer or laptop? If I have installed a lot of programs/games on my computer(desktop) and now buy a new laptop and I have installed a Ubuntu 11.10 on it too then,how to move all installed programs on my desktop to my laptop instead of installing them again on my laptop ???\n\nA: Best way to do that is a full backup of your system and then restore it the the new disk.\nYou have basically 3 choices:\n\n\n*\n\n*Full manual system installation, all programs and configurations done\none by one or using any automated process of installing the packages that you had. Configuration of those packages will probably be necessary after installation, with a bit of luck you will be able to \"move\" all your programs configuration by copying your home folder from the old computer to the new one;\n\n*Full system backup done with backups tools such as deja-dup which\nwill then be restored to the new system;\n\n*Disk cloning from the old system to the new. An image can be made\nfrom your old system and then restored to the new one leaving your\nsystem identical as the previous one. You can use dedicated applications such as clonezilla or a more simple approach suck as dd;\n\n\nIn the end its options 2 and 3 will make the all process faster and no (mostly no) downloads needed but option 1 will leave you with a cleaner system.\n\nA: It is important to remember that as long as you copy your home directory onto the new computer, all your apps will be automatically configured and ready to use when you install them. You don't have to reconfigure anything. \n\nA: 1)open nautilus with sudo nautilus command , go to  var/cache/\napt/archives \nselect and copy the folder with packages u have downloaded .(if it gives error , just click on skip and Dont worry )\n2)paste it to a external drive . also copy and paste your home folder .\n3)copy and paste both folders in your second pc.\n4)install synaptic package manager in second pc , click on add downloaded packages from menu and point to the location u copied archive  folder.\nit will add them and mark them automatically . if it gives error for broken packages , update cache with update manager or reload and click on 'fix broken packages' from menu .\n5)click on apply . u will have to download only if there is new version available for something .\n6)after installation copy the home folder to your home. restart your system.\nby following this procedure u will have clean system and u will have to download least .\n\nA: As techvish81 said you just have a copy of your hard disk. If you didn't find the .deb packages just search for it in Nautilus if you don't like the command-line approach.I'm sure you will get it.\nAnd then place all the .debs you want in a folder and run the following command\n\nsudo dpkg -i *.deb\n\nSee here\n\nA: So if you're on Ubuntu 20 DON'T try to use rsync like I did. It did not work as expected instead I recommend just copying partitions via gparted specifically both the root file system (obviously) and the efi (fat32) file system, that should work just fine.\n", "Q: Can see samba shares but not access them For the life of me I cannot figure this one out.\nI have samba installed and set up on the ubuntu box and on the Win7 box I CAN SEE all the shares I created. \nI created two users on ubuntu that map to the users in windows.

After that, the ACPI state should be reset. Then try booting from a Live CD or Live USB. If that works, try to boot into your installation.\nIf the Live session works, but your installation does not, try to uninstall the nvidia driver:\nsudo apt-get purge nvidia-current\n\n", "Q: Can't remove CouchDB Under 11.04, when I do sudo couchdb -V, I get a response like \"couchdb - Apache CouchDB 1.1.1\".

(It is on the top panel in Ubuntu now, called global menu)\n\n*Select Editor tab.\n\n*Uncheck the option Create a backup copy of files before saving.  \n\n\n*Close the Preferences window\n\nA: GEDIT by default has an option enabled which creates a backup file (with the suffix ~ for the backup file) every 10 minutes. You can easily disable this default behavior.  \nGo in the gedit menu to Edit > Preferences > Editor, there you will find an option that  says Create a backup of files before saving. Uncheck this option and you are done.\nThere is another option below that one called autosave files every .. minutes. I mention this one since some people like to have the backup option enabled but prefer to autosave less often, like 30 minutes or 1 hour as opposed to the default 10 minute interval.\nIn any case to disable the ~ (tilde) preceded file creation just disable (uncheck) the Create a backup of files before saving\nA view of the Editor options in gedit:\n\n\nA: You may be able to turn off these automatic backups by going into Edit > Preferences and unchecking the Create backup copies of files before saving option under the Editor tab:\n\nAlternatively, you can use a terminal to navigate to the directory where you are saving your files and remove the backup files using rm *~.\n\nA: This happens because gedit by default saves backup files.\nOpen the preferences and disable this option:\n\n\nA: Those are just backups of your original files that gedit creates before saving changes to your edited documents.\nIn gedit preferences you need to disable Create a backup copy of file before saving, and if you want to automatic save your edits automatically set a timer with the option enable Autosave files every X minutes.\nThat way the ~ will be gone and your last changes will be saved on the file every x minutes in case something goes bad or your computer crashes.\n\nThe changes made to the file will be saved to the file itself and not to a temporary file.\nPlease be aware that if you delete the contents of a file and auto save is enable there will be a chance that you end up with a saved empty file.\nAlways make sure that when you close on file while auto save is enabled that the contents of the file are correct, else undo them and save the file again.\n\nA: These are backup copies from the original file. You can delete them if you don't need them.\nMost editors have a setting to switch on/off creating those backup files. In gedit (the default editor), you need to switch off \"Create a backup copy of files before saving\" in the \"File saving\" section of the \"Editor\" tab in the \"Preferences\" dialog.\n", "Q: How do I allow a user access to one specific directory and its contents?

The default interface in 10.04 LTS should work just fine on your netbook, although if you go with 11.10 you should probably stick with Unity 2D to conserve on system resources.

Is there some setting I can change to make it go faster? I'm already running low on  Ubuntu One space and want cloud backup. Any suggestions?\n\nA: *\n\n*Check your upload bandwidth/speed somewhere like Speedtest.net  \n\n*Calculate your upload time by inputting your total amount of data and your upload speed into a bandwidth calculator, one is here at dslreports.com\nYou are looking at about 3 hours per Gigabyte backed up at that upload speed. That assumes it stays constant and you aren't using the connection for anything else. I've already entered the values for your connection speed, with one Gigabyte of data, that link is here.  \nThis is a common problem with asynchronous connections like home ADSL. The more data you want to send into the 'cloud', the more this becomes an issue. Some services like Amazon's S3 allow you to mail a hard drive to them so you don't have to spend weeks uploading. It's not cheap though.\n\nA: One of the wonderful \"backup\" solutions I've run across that minimizes transfer time is borg backup. \nIt is a deduplicating solution so not only do the minimal amount of files get sent (like incremental backup) but the destination storage size is also minimized as it is deduplicated. \nIt is a command line utility which may a nonstarter for you, however I can't sing it enough praise:\nhttps://github.com/borgbackup/borg\n", "Q: What should be content of grub2 custom entry to boot to another OS on LVM over LUKS along with Ubuntu?

I don't want to burn any of my hardware component at this point of time or make the system unbootable.\nRunning Ubuntu 11.10 with kernel 3.0.0-13-generic\n\nA: Weird, that Ubuntuforums link wants a login but I can view random other threads without logging in.\nAnyway I'm guessing you're referring to mem=xM in your bootloader. This is perfectly safe to try on your current install. For 6GB you want mem=6144M (6*1024).\nJust try tacking it onto the end of the line with the other options, which will include such things as quiet splash ro root=UUID=$stuff.\nFor safety, I would not recommend you edit any config files to do this the first time. While booting, hold Shift to get into GRUB and then press e to edit the highlighted grub entry. You can move around with the cursor keys to find the line you want to edit; add mem=6144M onto the end and boot (see directions at the bottom of the screen).\nIf it works, add it to /etc/default/grub in the line GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT, and run sudo update-grub.\n", "Q: How to copy a directory from your home to a system wide one I want to use the file manager to copy a directory from my Desktop to the /opt directory. When I run gksudo nautilus, I do not see anything in the Desktop directory.\nIf I open Nautilus normally from the taskbar, it shows the lampp directory along with other existing ones.\nSo how do I get to view this directory so I can cut and paste it into /opt directory?\n\nA: You are seeing an empty desktop because it is root's desktop directory since you use gksudo to open Nautilus. So, when you open Nautilus just follow this path from the left sidebar:\n\n--> File system --> home --> your_user_name --> your_desktop \n\nThen copy whatever you want. For an alternative way, you can use terminal for this:\nsudo cp -r ~/Desktop/directory_that_will_be_copied /opt/where_to_copy\n\n\nA: When you run Nautilus as root (with gksu nautilus or gksudo nautilus), it considers root's home directory (/root) as the pertinent home directory, instead of your own home directory (/home/shawn, where shawn is replaced by your actual username, if different).\nThat sort of thing does not happen when you run nongraphical commands as root in the usual way (i.e., with sudo). This is the main difference between the default behaviors of sudo and its graphical frontends like gksu and gksudo, and it is for good reason, since it is common for graphical programs to create and maintain configuration files in the home directory (which would either be rendered unchangeable by the non-root user and/or would provide a way for programs run as the non-root user to  create and modify configuration data altering the behavior of programs run as root, both of which would be undesirable).\nAs mentioned above, if your username is shawn, your home directory's full path is /home/shawn. Your desktop folder is then /home/shawn/Desktop. If you run Nautilus as root and navigate to that folder, you'll see (and be able to access and manipulate) the files on your desktop.\n", "Q: Skype is closed after logging in I installed Skype using Ubuntu Software Center.

When I open GNOME Image Viewer my fan speed is going up and spinning very fast.\nI would like to know the reason why it does this.\n\nA: Your CPU is pegged and it's heating up when you open Gnome Image Viewer. The fan speed is automatically adjusted by your BIOS via AMD Cool'n'Quietâ¢ or some other similar motherboard feature. Open the System Monitor to see how much CPU the app is using. EOG doesn't work for me in 11.10 because of a few bugs and I've since moved to Mirage.\n", "Q: Rhythmbox doesn't show CD track titles Let's say I want to rip a CD.

I would like to use ffmpeg to transform an mp4 video file into avi but with the same quality, even if it takes up more space. If I simply do:\nffmpeg -i file.mp4 file.mp4.avi\n\nThe resulting avi file is very low-quality and pixelated. How can I do this transformation while keeping the video and audio quality?\n\nA: Here is my 2-pass (Advanced Simple Profile) I use now and then. \npass 1:\nffmpeg -i file.mp4 -vcodec mpeg4 -vtag XVID -b 990k -bf 2 -g 300 -s 640x360 -pass 1 -an -threads 0 -f rawvideo -y /dev/null\n\npass 2:\nffmpeg -i file.mp4 -vcodec mpeg4 -vtag XVID -b 990k -bf 2 -g 300 -s 640x360 -acodec libmp3lame -ab 128k -ar 48000 -ac 2 -pass 2 -threads 0 -f avi file.avi\n\n\nA: My solution:\nffmpeg -i filename.mp4 -vcodec copy -acodec copy filename.avi\n\nEnjoy!!\n\nA: You always lose a little quality whenever you transcode from one codec to another, video or audio, but perhaps you can avoid it if you only want to change from MP4 container type to an AVI container. codec:copy may be helpful if you don't have a reason to transcode (and it should be faster).\nIf you must transcode because you need to use a particular video codec \nI hope you can use zetah's suggestion above in his comment and use the -sameq switch. Alternatively, you may want to use the qscale option to set the quality manually. The lower the number the better the quality, but the more space your file will take.\nThe last time I transcoded video I used qscale=8.0, but I'd suggest that you experiment to find the optimum to match the quality of your input.\nMarty Jay helpfully mentions that sameq means same quantizer as in the input, which may not result in the same quality. The article he quotes mentions using multi-pass conversion, which is a good way to achieve better compression without sacrificing quality.\n", "Q: How to setup Wifi using the command-line?

Every site on the internet just talks about eth0:0 for a secondary IP address.

I'm using Ubuntu 11.10 with Unity and would like to switch between workspaces with a keyboard shortcut. \nIs there any way to achieve this?\n\nA: In 13.04 workspaces are disabled by default. To enable them, open \"Appearance\" from the dash. It looks like this:  \n \nSwitch to the \"Behavior\" tab and check \"Enable workspaces\".  \n \nAfter that the normal shortcuts will work:  \nSuper+S for the workspace overview and Ctrl+Alt+Arrow Keys to switch between the individual workspaces.\n\nA: In 12.04 and above, you can set shortcuts for this by launching keyboard from the Dash and choosing the shortcuts tab.  Choose the Navigation option, then just change the various settings for Switch to workspace...\n\nI use CTRL-ALT-F1 for workspace 1, CTRL-ALT-F2 for workspace 2 and so on.\nThis setting can also be changed in CompizConfig Settings Manager (not installed by default, so sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager if you want to use it).  That program will also let you set things like moving to the next workspace when your mouse hits the edge of the screen - a setting I find too fiddly to use personally, but some might like.\n\nA: The shortcut Ctrl+Alt + arrow keys allows you to move in the workspaces.\nYou'll need to turn workspaces on if you're on 13.04+.\n", "Q: What's new in Gnome Panel 3.2?

While upstream authors can package their software for inclusion in Ubuntu and other operating systems, much of the software available in Ubuntu and other OSes is packaged by others, and if you file a needs-packaging request and the work is done, it will likely be done by a contributor to Debian and/or Ubuntu other than the program's original upstream author. Of course, you can still ask the upstream authors if they'll package their software for Debian/Ubuntu--it's possible they'll say yes.\nAs an alternative to officially packaging the software for Debian or Ubuntu, you (or the upstream developers, or anybody at all) can create a PPA for any free open source software.

Host and service notifications occur in the\n  following instances.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*When a hard state change occurs.\n  \n*When a host or service remains in a hard non-OK state and the time specified by the  option in the host or service definition has passed since the last notification was sent\n  out (for that specified host or service).\n  \n  \n  Who Gets Notified? \nEach host and service definition has a  option that\n  specifies what contact groups receive notifications for that\n  particular host or service. Contact groups can contain one or more\n  individual contacts. \nWhen Nagios sends out a host or service notification, it will notify\n  each contact that is a member of any contact groups specified in the\n   option of the service definition. Nagios realizes that\n  a contact may be a member of more than one contact group, so it\n  removes duplicate contact notifications before it does anything. \nWhat Filters Must Be Passed In Order For Notifications To Be Sent? \nJust because there is a need to send out a host or service\n  notification doesn't mean that any contacts are going to get notified.\n  There are several filters that potential notifications must pass\n  before they are deemed worthy enough to be sent out. Even then,\n  specific contacts may not be notified if their notification filters do\n  not allow for the notification to be sent to them. Let's go into the\n  filters that have to be passed in more detail.\nProgram-Wide Filter \nThe first filter that notifications must pass is a test of whether or\n  not notifications are enabled on a program-wide basis. This is\n  initially determined by the enable_notifications directive in the main\n  config file, but may be changed during runtime from the web interface.\n  If notifications are disabled on a program-wide basis, no host or\n  service notifications can be sent out - period. If they are enabled on\n  a program-wide basis, there are still other tests that must be passed.\nNotification Methods \nYou can have Nagios notify you of problems and recoveries pretty much\n  anyway you want: pager, cellphone, email, instant message, audio\n  alert, electric shocker, etc. How notifications are sent depend on the\n  notification commands that are defined in your object definition\n  files. 1\n\nRead More\n1Source:Nagios Notification\nThis was done with the authorized written permission of nagios.com\n\nAfter installing alsa by using the command\nsudo apt-get install alsa alsa-base alsa-utils\n\nafter that we go to configure Nagios Core to use aplay as command-line\n  audio file player for the ALSA sound card driver.\n\n> $: cd /usr/local/nagios/etc $: sudo nano commands.cfg\n\n\nadding the following lines\n\ndefine command{  command_name    play_siren  command_line    /bin/bash\n> /usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/play_siren.sh  }\n\n\ncreate a script to run the sound alarm\n\n> $: cd objects $: sudo nano play_siren.sh\n\n\nwith those lines\n\n> #!/bin/bash  /usr/bin/aplay -q /usr/share/nagios/etc/objects/alarm.wav\n\n\ngive to it the permissions and create a log\n\n> $: sudo chown nagios.nagios play_siren.sh $: sudo chmod a+x\n\n\nplay_siren.sh \nmodify the file contact.cfg to say to nagios of using the sound alarm\n\n> $: sudo nano templates.cfg:\n\n\nmodify the\ndefine contact{\n          name                            generic-contact\n          service_notification_period     24x7\n          host_notification_period        24x7\n          service_notification_options    w,u,c,r,f,s\n          host_notification_options       d,u,r,f,s\n          service_notification_commands   notify-service-by-email,play_siren\n          host_notification_commands      notify-host-by-email,play_siren\n          register                        0\n          }\n  2\n\n2Source:ideasnet.wordpress.com\nExtra References:\ncustom checks and notifications nagios\n", "Q: Where are Screenlets configuration files? I have just installed Screenlets and the extra widget package thru software center.\nNow I have gotten a little problem with a widget and therefore I want to reset the screenlet widget.\nHowever I can not find the configuration files. I have looked in /home/~/.screenlets, but the folder is empty.\nDoes anyone knows where the config/properties for the widgets are stored?\n\nA: The configuration for individual screenlets is stored in ~/.config/screenlets/ per the XDG Base Directory Specification. The actual screenlets are (non-compliantly) stored in ~/screenlets/.\nRefer to the official FAQ for more details.\n\nA: You are looking for: $HOME/.screenlets.\nDid you look (under the command line) for ~/.screenlets\nOR\ndid you use Nautilus, enable \"Show Hidden Files\", and look for folder: .screenlets ?\n", "Q: Why do I have to add a PPA twice (once to add it to the list of repo, second time to fix a BAD GPG) I notice the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*I add a ppa using add-apt-repository, for example the wine ppa, mozilla security, nvidia drivers, etc..\n\n*When I go to the Update Manager and tell it to CHECK for updates it throws me a PPA error.\n\n*To solve the error I add the same PPA again.\nWhy do I have to add the PPA again (This also can be done by adding the received key alone with apt-key) but why does this problem happen anyway.\nUPDATE - I have to add two small details. \nFirst that removing the previous PPA that has the GPG problem and then adding it up again will have the same effect as adding it twice since adding it again (without removing it first) will overwrite the same PPA. But still in the end you would have to add it twice.\nSecond using the Update Manager (Clicking on the Settings Button and going to the Software Sources) to add the PPA has the same problem as adding it in the terminal. In both cases you have to add it twice. I can confirm this for Nvidia ppa, Mozilla Security ppa, Wine ppa and any other PPA I started trying in 11.10. I have to add that this issue was not a problem in 11.04. It started with 11.10. Somehow there is some minor details that trying to add a PPA the first time does not trigger the key for it. Doing it a second time triggers the key and you can use the Update Manager (or any other updater) without having a warning popup saying something about a PPA problem.\nUPDATE 2 - I have tested several PPA. They all have the same problem adding them via the GUI Software Sources or via the terminal add-apt-repository. I have to actually add them, run the update command in terminal or via gui and then add them again to solve the problem. Does not matter from where I add them or update or add them again.\n\nA: When you use the command line, you are the one expected to resolve issues around missing keys, or other warnings and errors.\nWhen you instead use the Update Manager, is will attempt to hide (or resolve) many of the issues that might affect you.\nJust choose whichever method you are more comfortable with ..\nMORE TECHNICAL: Some application's sources (:PPA, wget http://, etc.) will give intermediary errors as you (variously): add a repository, update sources, download PGP keys, and/or resolve additional dependencies.  These are non-fatal errors, and may be reduced (or eliminated) by careful re-ordering of commands - although this is NOT technically required.\n\nA: You can fix broken or bad GPG Keys by installing launchpad-getkeys from the WebUpd8 PPA.  In terminal use the following commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:nilarimogard/webupd8\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install launchpad-getkeys\n\nSince you seem to be having problems with Update Manager recognizing new PPAs, simply do the above steps without involving the Update Manager.  Once you have installed the package, run the following command in your terminal:\nsudo launchpad-getkeys\n\nWait for the program to finish.  Your terminal should look similar to this:\n\nAs it says, you should have no more problems with missing GPG Keys. This method of fixing your PPA's keys is preferable to adding the same PPA twice, which can cause update problems of its own.\nHope this helps!  Haha it's actually the second time today I've answered a question with this fix.\n\nA: Not sure why you're getting this when using the terminal which has been the only way I've seen be successful in 11.10 (one time\nOver the course of 11.10 dev probably did 100 or so installs, many times adding a ppa or 2 to test them. Software sources always would fail to add the key so stopped using & went exclusively with terminal command which always was successful.\n(though i tended to use from a small group of ppa's so sampling  was small\nOn a fairly fresh release install took a guess at the ppa you used for wine, went fine.

To change that behaviour, you need to install dconf-tools. Then open it in dash (dconf Editor), and follow this path:\n org > gnome > settings-daemon > plugins > power\n\nAnd change the value of critical-battery-action to nothing.\nAlso, if the battery is marked as broken, you can also uncheck the option notify-perhaps-recall.\nHope it helps.\n\nA: If you want to keep the action (IE: Hibernate) open dconf-editor: org > gnome > settings-daemon > plugins > power and just uncheck: use-time-for-policy, this will force the OS to use the percentage base instead of the ACPI Bios.\n", "Q: Display is cut-off and stuck at 640x480; cannot detect monitor I've recently installed Ubuntu 11.10 on my PC and I have a resolution problem. \nMy screen resolution is set at 640x480 (4:3) and I can't see right the whole screen, the windows or the icons.

I dual-boot with Windows 7 and Windows 7 has been working flawlessly.\nI have tried both Unity as well as Gnome-Shell, and both end up hanging.  The hang is not predictable and I'm not sure what causes it.  I thought it was being caused by streaming video from my file server (since that is what I most frequently do in Ubuntu and that is when the hangs were occurring), but last week the system hung despite playing a video file locally.  It also hung once while doing nothing (only the browser was running).\nFor most of this year I've resorted to spending my time in Windows 7 as a result, but I'd really love to get Ubuntu stable again.\nAny advice on diagnosing this issue?\n\nA: The eCryptfs errors were caused by a regression.\nIt was fixed in Oneiric kernel version 3.0.0-15.25.\nI'm not sure that the eCryptfs bug is what caused all of the problems you listed, but upgrading your kernel will remove one more variable while tracking down your issues.\n\nA: This appears to be occuring to some people who have upgraded from 11.04 to 11.10 and kept their encrypted home folder. There is no fix yet however there is a workaround.

To do this, following the instructions below.\nto install a kernel\nNavigate to this website and download the files that look like the following:\nheaders_amd64.deb, headers_all.deb & image_amd64.deb if using 64bit Ubuntu\nheaders_i386.deb, headers_all.deb & image_i386.deb if using 32bit Ubuntu\nInstall the packages downloaded using the terminal command:\nsudo dpkg -i linux*.deb\n\nReboot.\nWhen booting press SHIFT to display your GRUB - this screen lists your kernels - you can boot with any kernel listed including \"older linux\" option for old kernels.\n\nPossible Solutions\n\n*\n\n*Look at the kernel mainline and choose a newer kernel - preferably one that has the oneiric name associated with it - however you could also try the very latest (but probably unstable) 2.6.32 release candidates.\n\n\n*Looking closely at that bug-report, early in the thread the OP reported that his issue was due to a hidden SSID.  Possibly you can check in your router settings whether you are using a visible SSID or a hidden SSID.\n\n\n*Also, the OP reported that he didn't have his particular issue with the older 2.6.39.2 kernel.  You could also try that by downloading this from the launchpad mainline and installing this using the instructions above.  Remember to booting into the older kernel by selecting it from GRUB.\nTidying up\nIf this doesn't workout for you - remove this kernel using my answer in this question\nIf the newer/older kernel works for you then you can use my answer here to \"fix\" the kernel i.e. to always boot into the newer/older kernel.\n\nConclusion\nAs we have discussed - trying all of the above, booting with the older 2.6.39.2 kernel seems to provide you with the best solution.\n", "Q: Kernel panic in version 3.0.0-13 prevents login (\"VFS not syncing\" error) \nPossible Duplicate:\nKernel panics with âCannot open root deviceâ error, where do I append the âroot=â option? \n\nI updated Ubuntu 2 days ago and now I can't login, even in Safe Mode, since there's a Kernel Panic ('VFS not syncing', something like that).

That's what I want.\n\nA: The problem is an application in Ubuntu is spread out all over the filesystem.\nIt will put the bulk of it's stuff in /usr (binaries and libraries), some stuff in /etc (configuration), some stuff in /var (transient files, logs), etc.\nAn application generally doesn't fit neatly into a single directory that you can just put somewhere else unfortunately.\nYou could copy files from all those locations over to the SD, and symlink where they came from so that the system can still find them, but it would get really messy really quickly.\nAlso, even if you did that, and if you were hoping to remove the SD and use it in another Ubuntu and use the apps on it, that won't work either, because the package database saves quite a bit of \"state\", meaning it knows what packages are installed and where all the files are, what version the app is and so on. If you simply plopped the SD containing the relevant files into another Ubuntu it wouldn't realise the files on it were part of an application.\nIn short - not really feasible.\n", "Q: How do I get root access to hard drive from livecd?

When I create a new user, how do I tell Ubuntu not to create a Public sub-folder?\n\nA: Preventing the creation of content folders\nAs you may have noticed, Ubuntu has a few \"special\" folders for certain types of content.\n\nThese will appear in new user accounts, and auto-recreate (in certain situations) for existing users. However, this behavior can be configured.\nFor new users\nOpen /etc/xdg/user-dirs.defaults in your preferred text editor, with administrator privileges. You will see something close to this:\nXDG_DESKTOP_DIR=\"$HOME/Desktop\"\nXDG_DOWNLOAD_DIR=\"$HOME/Downloads\"\nXDG_TEMPLATES_DIR=\"$HOME/Templates\"\nXDG_PUBLICSHARE_DIR=\"$HOME/Public\"\nXDG_DOCUMENTS_DIR=\"$HOME/Documents\"\nXDG_MUSIC_DIR=\"$HOME/Music\"\nXDG_PICTURES_DIR=\"$HOME/Pictures\"\nXDG_VIDEOS_DIR=\"$HOME/Videos\"\n\nThis is a system description of the default content folders to create for new users. If you replace any directory here with the home folder, new users will not have that folder created on first login.\nFor example, to prevent new users from getting a Public folder:\nXDG_PUBLICSHARE_DIR=\"$HOME\"\n\nFor existing users\nUse the same process as above, but edit the  .config/user-dirs.dirs in the user's home folder instead. This method does not require administrative privileges, and will prevent content directories from being recreated after user deletion.\nTechnical reading\n\n\n*\n\n*The XDG User Directories specification\n\n*\"How can I change the default location of content directories in my home folder?\"\n\nA: The XDG specified directories, as described by Jacob, are not created with the account, they're created (and recreated if missing) when the user logs in. Pointing those user-dirs variables at $HOME is a workaround, but it doesn't actually disable the functionality; if disabling is what you want, you can change \"enabled=True\" to \"enabled=False\" in /etc/xdg/user-dirs.conf. As the comment in that file above the definition says,\n# This controls the behaviour of xdg-user-dirs-update which is run on user login\n# You can also have per-user config in ~/.config/user-dirs.conf, or specify\n# the XDG_CONFIG_HOME and/or XDG_CONFIG_DIRS to override this\n\nNote that you'll probably also need to uninstall gnome-user-share for this to actually work.\n", "Q: Why can't I choose Ubuntu at boot? I installed Ubuntu along side windows xp, and at the choose OS screen my keyboard doesn't work. I can't even hit enter to just start xp I have to wait for the count down. Any ideas?\n\nA: You're probably using a USB keyboard on an at least somewhat old machine. Usually that works fine, but occasionally it doesn't.\nA similar problem was encountered several months ago. This problem almost certainly is with your hardware (USB controller and/or keyboard), and/or your BIOS, and neither with Ubuntu (the OS you're trying to boot, but which is never actually running yet) nor Windows (which provides the boot menu that's not working...but is unlikely to be responsible for the problem).\nHere are some things you can try:\n(1) Enable legacy mode (for USB) in your BIOS setup (if it has that, and it's disabled). You can try disabling it if it's enabled, though that's considerably less likely to help.\n(2) Install a BIOS update, if there is one available.\n(3) If this is a USB keyboard plugged into the front (or top) of your machine, you could try plugging it into a USB port on the back of your machine. This will probably not help, but it's possible that some USB ports (the lower-numbered ones, which are usually on the back) work better for the simple I/O that is being used before an OS is booted.\n(4) Try a different keyboard. Specifically, if this is a USB keyboard (which it almost certainly is), try a PS/2 keyboard. (It seems unlikely that this is a PS/2 keyboard, but if it is, try a USB keyboard.) This is the most likely to help.\n", "Q: Making bootable USB drive I have the Windows 7 iso and I wanted to make a bootable flash drive out of it.

You need to go into BIOS setup and make sure the USB stick comes first in the list of boot devices.\nIf you still see the same GRUB menu after confirming the the USB is first in the list - it suggests that the USB drive is not bootable so BIOS skips it and goes to the next one in the list.

It is possible to run Unity 3D in VirtualBox on a Mac?\nI'm having a horrible time with Unity 3D in Ubuntu 11.10 running in a VirtualBox VM in OS X. Such a hard time, in fact, that I'm about to give up and conclude that it simply isn't possible to use Ubuntu 3D in a configuration like this.\nThe problem with is that windows simply do not render. I've found that killing Nautilus makes the problem go away, but that's really not much of a solution.\nI have installed the guest additions and am running the VM with 2048 MB RAM, 128 MB video memory, and have enabled 3D acceleration.\nI've tried all this on several Macintoshes with no luck.

Also, default behavior of all most all applications' source distributions (tarballs) is to install in /usr/local rather than /usr (where software is installed by the package manager). Therefore, you don't have to remove the version already installed through the package manager, though it may be helpful to do so (it will make sure the version you want is always the version that gets run and will decrease the likelihood that different versions will use each other's libraries and throw subtle and bizarre errors), and is unlikely to hurt.\nSoftware installed from source in the way you've described certainly will not be updated by apt-get.\nTo uninstall the version installed from a source tarball in the way you've described, you can usually run sudo make uninstall.

Recently when doing an update, I noticed I was downloading a bunch of packages related to Unity. I use Gnome-Classic, and have no intention of ever using Unity.\nSo, I thought I might save myself some bandwidth and download times (which can be slow on my laptop) by removing Unity.\nHowever, on next reboot, I could not get any form of GUI interface. Only by reinstalling Unity was I able to get the log in interface and get back into Gnome Classic.\nCan I get rid of Unity, or is it somehow now integral to Ubuntu in a way that makes Ubuntu not run without it (even if I'm exlusively using Gnome-Classic)?\n\nA: The simple answer is Yes. Basically Unity is just a shell on top of gnome3 so you can use any desktop environment you like.\nThe login screen you are talking about is not unity but lightdm. Ubuntu uses lightdm and the default theme used is unity-greeter which is independent of unity. So make sure lightdm as well as unity-greeter is installed and choose your session. Basically what you can do is change default setting of lightdm with /usr/lib/lightdm/lightdm-set-defaults and lightdm also offers another gtk theme called lightdm-gtk-greeter if you dislike the default login screen.\nyou may set default session and greeter\n/var/lib/lightdm/lighdm-set-defaults -s YourSessionName\n/var/lib/lightdm/lighdm-set-defaults -g lightdm-gtk-greeter/unity-greeter\n\nOr you may opt to choose a completely different display manager i.e. GDM, LXDM or Slim\ngdm used to be display manager prior 11.10\n", "Q: Will 12.04 default into Unity the way 11.10 did? When I upgraded to 11.10 from 11.04, on first boot I was put into the Unity shell. However, since then, I have opted to use Gnome-Classic.\nMy question is, when Ubuntu 12.04 comes out next April, will it do the same thing and default to the Unity shell and I'll have to reinstall Gnome and Gnome-classic? Or will my Gnome-Classic interface and settings be preserved?\n\nA: It's nigh on impossible to say exactly what will happen at this point but I can say this:\nThe reason you defaulted to Unity when you upgraded is because LighDM replaced GDM, and the actual gnome-classic desktop no longer exists (it's gnome-session-fallback now). Everything changed name and Gnome Shell (of which gnome-session-fallback is a part) was not a default install option.\nThese sorts of massive changes mean the upgrade process leaves you with the default. It could have been more clever about things but it wasn't.\nGiven that things are likely to remain fairly static in terms of nomenclature and stack, I can't see any good reason why you would lose your default settings again.\nBut it's early and Canonical do like to throw things in at the last minute.\n\nUpdate 4/4/12: I'm happy to report that upgrading from Gnome Classic in 11.10 to 12.04 beta 2 has left me with my default desktop installation.\nI'm leaving my initial post above because it highlights where the problems came in previous releases.\n\nA: Your GNOME Classic (i.e., Fallback) interface and your settings pertaining to it will almost certainly be preserved when you upgrade from Ubuntu 11.10 to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.\nUbuntu 11.04 used GTK+2 and GNOME 2. By default it provided three session types: Ubuntu (GNOME 2 with the GTK+2 version of Unity, which required 3D acceleration), Ubuntu Classic (a classic GNOME 2 interface), and Ubuntu Classic (no effects) (the same, but without any visual effects at all).\nWhen you upgraded from Ubuntu 11.04 Natty Narwhal to Ubuntu 11.10 Oneiric Ocelot, GTK+2 was replaced with GTK+3. The Unity interface existed for GTK+3, so while it changed a lot \"under the hood\" (for that and other reasons), the user experience only changed slightly. However, the classic GNOME 2 interface requires GTK+2. So it was replaced with Unity 2D, which behaves very much like Unity and very little like the classic GNOME 2 interface.\nAs you know (since you use it), a GNOME Classic session type (which provides the GNOME Fallback interface, which is a GNOME 3 interface with a shell that feels a lot like, though by no means the same as, GNOME 2's old shell) is available in Ubuntu 11.10. It is provided by the gnome-session-fallback package. The GNOME Classic session type is not really a logical continuation of any previous interface present in earlier Ubuntu releases, and it is community-supported rather than being supported by Canonical (that is, it is provided in the Universe component rather than the Main one). For these reasons, it would not make sense for it to be installed by default during a fresh installation or upgrade, and it is not. You had to install it yourself (by telling the package manager that you wanted that one particular package).\nThere are no plans to remove gnome-session-fallback for Ubuntu 12.04 LTS Precise Pangolin, so if you use the GNOME Classic session type in Ubuntu 11.10, there is no reason to think you will not be able to use it in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS either. Currently, this release is in alpha testing. gnome-session-fallback can be installed in Precise systems, and if you have an Oneiric system with it installed, it remains installed when you upgrade to the Precise alpha. If GNOME Classic is the default session type in an Oneiric system (either globally or for some user), it remains so when that system is upgraded to the Precise alpha.\nWhen upgrading from one release to another, you should expect that the appearance and behavior of most applications will change. There will probably be changes in the GNOME Fallback interface provided in GNOME Classic sessions. However, the changes are unlikely to be very great, because this is designed as a fallback interface; it is not where bleeding-edge development is occurring. These changes may well not even be noticeable. And whether or not they are, your settings within this interface (such as the layout you use for your panels) should remain the same when you upgrade to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.\nAs there is still some time remaining before Ubuntu 12.04 LTS comes out, it is of course  possible for there to be major changes. However, especially considering that this is an LTS release with an emphasis on rock-solid stability and long-term usability rather than on making major changes or introducing large new features, it seems unlikely that any of the current interfaces will be changed enormously or made unavailable.\n\nA: In 12.04 Unity will still be the default desktop, as you can do now you can install or re install Gnome Shell and it's fallback mode, you're settings will still be preserved after that.\n\nA: I have been running 12.04 Alpha 1 for about 2 weeks now and have Gnome running.\n\n\n*\n\n*Gnome - lots of nifty moving bits, a bit flaky but works well.\n\n*Gnome Classic. A bit similar to Unity but has the bottom panel so you can see what windows are open.\n\n*Gnome Classic with no effects. Pretty much the same as Gnome Classic in 11.10\n\n\nAll work quite happily in 12.04.\n", "Q: Very slow 3G internet connection on Ubuntu 11.10 I installed Ubuntu 11.10 on Dell laptop.

Since the availability of Unity and GNOME Shell, I have noticed widespread confusion over whether the more \"traditional\" version of the GNOME desktop environment should be referred to as \"GNOME Classic\" or \"GNOME Fallback\" in 11.04, 11.10 and later.\nWhat is the correct terminology to use? Also, does it differ by Ubuntu version?\n\nA: The classic GNOME 2 interface present in Ubuntu up to 11.04 but not in later releases is just GNOME 2 (with the default shell). The name of the session type for this interface was Ubuntu Classic, and the name of the session type for Unity was (and still is) Ubuntu, but that shouldn't be confused with the name of the interface itself--Ubuntu is an operating system, after all, not an interface.\nNonetheless, since any mention of \"GNOME shell\" evokes the idea of GNOME 3, and since Unity is also a GNOME interface, it is helpful to be able to characterize the classic GNOME 2 interface as separate both from any GNOME 3 interface and from versions of the Unity interface that used GNOME 2. Thus it's become almost common to call it GNOME Classic.\nWe should avoid calling it that, because that's capitalized and thus a proper name, and yet that is not the official name for it. In my opinion, we should instead say \"the classic GNOME 2 interface.\"\nThe practical reason why it is bad to call the classic GNOME 2 interface \"GNOME Classic\" is that GNOME Classic is the name of the session type in Ubuntu 11.10 (and future versions) that provides the GNOME Fallback interface. The GNOME Fallback interface is a GNOME 3 interface that is designed to look and behave a lot (though not entirely) like the classic GNOME 2 interface.\nHere's a condensed list of some interfaces and the session types that provide them in Ubuntu 11.04 and Ubuntu 11.10:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Unity interface (sometimes colloquially known as Unity 3D or 3D Unity, as it uses 3D graphics acceleration) is provided by the Ubuntu session type. The overarching desktop environment is GNOME 2 in Ubuntu 11.04 and earlier versions, and GNOME 3 starting with Ubuntu 11.10. The window manager has been compiz for a while. Install this with the ubuntu-desktop metapackage.\n\n*The Unity 2D interface is provided by the Ubuntu 2D session type. The overarching desktop environment is GNOME 2 in Ubuntu 11.04 and earlier versions (but unity-2d was only available by PPA back then), and GNOME 3 starting with Ubuntu 11.10. The window manager is metacity. Starting with Ubuntu 11.04, install this with the ubuntu-desktop metapackage.\n\n*The classic GNOME 2 interface was provided by the Ubuntu Classic and Ubuntu Classic (no effects) session types. The overarching desktop environment was GNOME 2. This could be installed by the ubuntu-desktop metapackage.\n\n*The GNOME Fallback interface (which is a GNOME 3 interface that looks like classic GNOME 2) is provided by the GNOME Classic and GNOME Classic (no effects) session types. The overarching desktop environment is GNOME 3. The window manager is metacity. Install this with the gnome-session-fallback package.\n\n*The GNOME 3 (or GNOME 3 Shell or GNOME Shell) interface is provided by the GNOME session type, starting in Ubuntu 11.10. (In significantly older versions of Ubuntu, the \"GNOME\" session type had once meant what the \"Ubuntu Classic\" session type means in Ubuntu 11.04.) The overarching desktop environment is GNOME 3. The window manager is mutter. Install this with the gnome-shell package.\n\n*The KDE 4 (or KDE 4 Plasma, or KDE 4 Plasma Workspaces, or just KDE) interface is provided by the Kubuntu session type. (Considerably over versions of Ubuntu had major version 3 of KDE instead.) The overarching desktop environment is KDE 4 (frequently just called KDE these days, as it came out some time ago). The window manager is kwin (available via the traditional kde-window-manager package and, as of Ubuntu 11.10, also available in kde-window-manager-gles). Install this with the kubuntu-desktop metapackage.\n\n*The Xfce 4 (or Xfce) interface is provided by the Xubuntu session type. The overarching desktop environment is Xfce 4 (also Xfce4 or just Xfce). The window manager is xfwm4. Install this with the xubuntu-desktop metapackage.\n\n*The LXDE interface is provided by the Lubuntu session type; it is also provided with a different configuration by the Lubuntu Netbook session type (this can arguably be considered a different interface). The overarching desktop environment is LXDE. The window manager is openbox. Install this with the lubuntu-desktop metapackage.\n\n", "Q: Good alternative to NetLimiter?  There is a program NetLimiter for windows. While I was using Windows it was very useful for me to find out the IP address of the person who was downloading from me, or to know IP address of any person on LAN who was using DC++ with some nick. And after that I can easily know the computer name of that person using nbtstat. \nI was wondering if there is any tool for Ubuntu using which I can find out the IP address of person who is downloading from me or from whom I am downloading on LAN. I am on university LAN and we are using PtokaX and DC++ for file sharing on LAN. people sometimes put some offencive stuff on open chat on DC++ using some Nick and I don't know how to trace them while I am using Ubuntu.\n\nA: NetLimiter is a traffic shaping / limiting application as far as I know, but as a consequence it is able to display traffic information connected to IP addresses.\nI don't see how you could connect the nickname with the IP address if not by the current volume of traffic.\nIf you are looking for such information you can try iftop. It tells you the amount of input/output traffic by connection. (It is quite a capable tool, just needs some digging into the manual.)\nAlternatively there is nethogs that displays the amount of traffic per application.\n\nA: Well I use nethogs for a more \"friendly\" approach but jnettop also works.\nsudo apt-get install nethogs\nTo run it (As root) do sudo nethogs INTERFACE\nFor example: sudo nethogs eth0, sudo nethogs eth1, sudo nethogs eth2, Etc...\nYou also have wireshark for Wireless (NetHogs also works with wireless connection if you are for example a HotSpot)\nThen you also have:\nnetcat (Superman!) - http://nc110.sourceforge.net/\nntop (Web Based) - http://www.ntop.org/\njnettop (Very cool and friendly. Terminal Based) - http://jnettop.kubs.info/wiki/\nnmap (Supergirl!) - Other \"stuff\" - http://nmap.org/changelog.html \n\nA: None of these answers seem to provide a way to limit the bandwidth\nI've ended up writing this: https://github.com/chozabu/LinNetLim\nIt works by port, not by process (yet) - and seems to work better limiting upstream data\n", "Q: Samba is installed, Why doesn't gnome-file-share-properties work? Samba and all it's dependencies are installed. Why does gnome-file-share-properties (Personal File Sharing application) say:\nThis feature cannot be enabled because the required packages are not installed on your system ? \n\nWhat packages am I missing?\nEDIT:\nPersonal File Sharing application may also be known by gnome-user-share.\n\nA: To fix this, you need to install two (2) more packages. Type these on a Terminal then try again\nsudo apt-get install apache2.2-bin libapache2-mod-dnssd\n\nA: This answer must be too dated to work. I did not pay attention to the fact this was asked 7 years ago! \nMy result doing sudo apt-get install apache2.2-bin libapache2-mod-dnssd  did what was explained in comment by â Nik Reiman Feb 4 '15 at 8:28\nI had to do sudo apt-get install gnome-user-share to fix it\n", "Q: gnome-terminal and logging Is there any way to log every that was displayed in gnome-terminal?\nfor example I have a complex command\ndoSomethingThatPrintoutsAlot ; doSomethingThatPrintoutsAlot2 ; doSomethingThatPrintoutsAlot3\n\nI can add > file, but than I would have to do it for each command and I have to use tail in another console to see the output. maybe gnome-terminal support logging everything?\nthere is .bash_history, so .... it might also support this.\n\nA: The .bash_history file only stores the command history, not the output. Skimming through man bash it does not seem to support that kind of logging.\nHowever there is the script command that is able to log the output of any terminal. The usage is quite simple:\nscript ~/mylog\nScript started, file is /home/-----/mylog\n...\n(commands that produce output)\n...\nexit\nScript done, file is /home/------/mylog\n\nThe output can be read from ~/mylog.\n\nA: This does not answer your question directly since you're asking about gnome-terminal, but for completeness sake: konsole, the terminal emulator from KDE, makes this as easy as File - Save Output As... - which saves everything in the terminal's scrollback buffer. \nIt is also possible to set the number of lines stored in the scrollback buffer to unlimited, so this would work even for a very long output.\nThere's also \"Clear Scrollback\" option.\nYou can easily install konsole in Gnome, but that would pull down a few KDE dependencies.\n", "Q: How can I browse a folder currently open in nautilus in the terminal? I would like to be able to to this easily, in all of the following ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*Keyboard shortcut\n\n*Right-click\n\n*Drag a folder into an open terminal (with a certain mouse button)\n\n*Drag the title bar into an open terminal (with a certain mouse button)\n\n\nHow can this be done?\n\nA: You can install the package nautilus-open-terminal that provides a new context menu item in Nautilus to open the current folder in a terminal.\n\nA: Check out Nautilus Terminal.  It essentially creates a mini-terminal window in each Nautilus window.  Comes in handy often.\n", "Q: Unable to install PostgreSQL I am trying to install postgresql on Ubuntu. I tried installing it using the following command:\napt-get install postgresql\n\nWhich results in\nReading package lists... Done\nBuilding dependency tree\nReading state information...

(it should be, since the one you installed depends on it).\nAlso, it looks like postgresql simply doesn't have an init.d script. Try:\nservice postgresql start\n\n\nA: There is a line\ndebconf: delaying package configuration, since apt-utils is not installed\n\nThis may block the complete configuration of PostgreSQL and other packages, so you should install it, too: apt-utils .\n", "Q: How to reenable autostart of compiz? After upgrading to 11.10 compiz won't start automatically and I have to run compiz --replace after each reboot. How to start it automatically instead?\n\nA: If you're running unity 2d, the default, try Dash -> Startup Applications -> Add. Now:\nName:Compiz\nCommand: bash -c \"sleep 2; compiz --replace\"\n\nSleep 2 lets the system wait for 2 seconds before loading compiz, of course it is optional (you can use bash -c \"compiz --replace\" instead) but it is useful, because it allows the system to be ready to composite the screen correctly. For example it is necessary if you use screenlets, they must be loaded before calling compiz --replace to show correctly.\n", "Q: Transparent menus(for applications) in gnome shell How do I make menus look transparent in Gnome-shell?\nIn unity, I use ubuntu-tweak to do this(In ubuntu tweak , Go to Desktop->Compiz settings and then select Enable transparent menus option). Since compiz is no longer being used in gnome-shell, this is not working any more . Any alternatives ?\nI love gnome-shell but I am still missing some awesome features of compiz like \"wobbly windows\" and other desktop effects!\n\nA: transparency of the menus and panel is controlled by the shell theme you are using.\nyou can modify it by:\n\n\n*\n\n*selecting another theme that has transparency.\n\n*modifying the current theme to have transparency. you can modify the\ntheme (not recommended if you don't know what you are doing) by going to to the theme .css file.( you can find the .css file in the /home/username/.themes/theme you downloaded.  or in the /usr/share/gnome-shell/theme\n\n*if you modify any file, please be carefull and make sure to back up\nthe original.\n\n\nmy suggestion is to use another theme to your liking. such as elementaryviper luna. which is semi transparent.or the elegance theme.\n\nfor other themes available for gnome shell, you can go to devianart or to gnome-look.org\n", "Q: Dell Inspiron N5010 overheating I've installed Ubuntu 11.10 on a Dell Inspiron N5010.

When I've installed 11.10 I had big problems with that (processor in idle constantly on 85 degrees) and this workaround and the âWorkaround by editing GRUBâ part helped me quite a lot (now it's around 60 degrees). I found this article thanks to another Ask Ubuntu issue where it's also suggested to install Jupiter applet which also helped me to reduce the temperature even more...\n\nWorkaround using Sysfs (temporary, use for testing)\nNote: It seems that in the most recent kernel revisions ASPM is\n  disabled on pre PCIe 1.1 devices and must be manually enabled using\n  pcie_aspm=force kernel parameter (the second method in this\n  article). So if it happens that when you try Sysfs method you receive\n  Operation not permitted error, then you can skip to the \"Workaround by\n  editing GRUB\" method.\nSysfs is a virtual file system used (amongst other things) to\n  configure Linux hardware options from userspace. You can control your\n  hardware options in real time by writing into what appear as text\n  files. First let's check the state of things:\ncat /sys/module/pcie_aspm/parameters/policy\n\nThe output of this command will probably be something like this:\n[default] performance powersave\n\nThis means that the default PCIe ASPM (Active State Power Management)\n  profile is selected. This \"default\" is where the problem lies. To work\n  around Linux kernel 2.6.38 power regression we must force PCIe ASPM to\n  be enabled. For ASPM to be enabled we must make sure that it stays off\n  the \"default\" and \"performance\" profiles. This is how you can do it\n  using Sysfs on Ubuntu based Linux distributions:\necho powersave | sudo tee /sys/module/pcie_aspm/parameters/policy\n\nThis setting remains until you change it again using sysfs or until\n  you reboot, so is useful for testing whether PCIe ASPM is working on\n  your configuration. This is necessary because there are reports of\n  PCIe ASPM causing lockups when enabled on systems with buggy ASMP BIOS\n  implementation. If this option isn't causing problems on your laptop\n  or desktop system you can proceed to configure ASPM by editing GRUB or\n  you can use sysfs to enable this option using an init script.\nWorkaround by editing GRUB (permanent)\nAfter you've make sure that PCIe ASPM isn't causing problems on your\n  configuration you can apply this workaround for good by editing GRUB\n  configuration like this:\nsudo nano /etc/default/grub\n\nNow you find the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT line that might look like\n  this:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\n\nYou should edit this line to look like this:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash pcie_aspm=force\"\n\nThis way you are passing pcie_aspm=force kernel argument to force\n  PCIe ASPM. This settings will be applied every time you boot your\n  laptop or desktop. To make changes effective after editing the file,\n  run:\nsudo update-grub\n\n\n\nA: The problem could be due to the use of a proprietary graphics driver (assuming you have the ATI/AMD graphics card) that is not updated with updates manager. All you have to do is go to Settings > Additional Drivers and click on ATI/AMD proprietary FGLRX graphics driver and click activate. The driver will be downloaded and restart your computer. \n\nA: If you have a Dell n5010 I assume it's really old.\nLet me tell you my own experience:\nI got an old n5010 from my gf and installed Ubuntu 16.04, it was overheating a lot and running slow, i5, 4gb of ram and Ubuntu, running slow.\nOk, so I tried a lighter OS, installed MATE...

Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: Follow the instructions regarding easybcd as described\nHow to reinstall windows bootloader to the MBR\nAfter you reinstalled the windows bootloader you can delete the ubuntu partion using a live cd/usb and running gparted. \n\nA: If you have a Wubi install then you can just remove it from the Windows 'Add/Remove programs' tools (or whatever it's called these days).\nIf you installed it some other way (USB?) as a full dual-boot system, then you can probably restore it using a USB CD drive - but I'm sure you already thought of that. (Maybe you could put a Windows CD image on a USB drive, but I don't know?)\nIf none of that works then you could try using a virtual machine. If your machine can't handle real VMs (and many netbooks won't be able to), then kvm can simulate a machine the hard way, slowly, as long as you have enough memory.\nWithin Ubuntu, kvm will boot from an iso image of a Windows CD (or maybe a network mounted CD drive, slowly), and you can set your virtual hard drive to be your real hard drive /dev/sda (or whatever it's called on your system - you'll need to be root to access it), and then you can let it do a repair. IF THIS GOES WRONG BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN, so wait until somebody has found the obvious flaw in my plan and posted it in the comments.\nDon't ever try to do a full install this way though: a) bad things happen if you wipe the drive your OS is running from, and b) Windows detects hardware at install time, not run time, and the virtual hardware won't match your real hardware, so the result won't boot. (Although, I have actually used this technique to install Linux on a drive that I had physically removed from another machine that had no CD or boot-from-USB feature.)\nOnce the Windows boot loader is restored, you can reboot into Windows, and use normal Windows tools to rearrange/reformat/delete/extend the drive partitions to your taste.\n", "Q: Screenlets change position after restart I have a problem with my screenlets.

This is a useful lens that I miss having in Ubuntu 11.04.\n\nA: I presume it was this Natty lens you were referring to from this ppa\n\nWhilst there is an oneiric package in the PPA it looks like it hasnt been touched since May 2011.  When installing it gives a dependency error.\nI've tried rebuilding with a dependency fix for oneiric but when running it fails due to an out-of-date use of python.\nThis does look like an interesting lens - but perhaps really should be part of the Unity-Scopes blueprint - if you agree, post a request indicating where the current code resides and hopefully if agreed, the developers can rework this into a scope.\n", "Q: Passing 2 parameters to \"Open with..\" I do a lot of diffing and I would like to have kdiff3 under \"Open with...\". When from console I execute kdiff3 file1 file2 then kdiff is runned and it compares those two files. however this does not work with \"open with\".\nIf I select two files and click \"Open with...\" and type \"kdiff3\" then kdiff is runned with only first file. is it possible to pass two files to kdiff as open with?\n\nA: Open with is not meant for such a use-case. Even if it were possible, by (for eg) by creating a second shell script that would launch kdiff3, it would either hardcode the second file in thE script itself, or have to ask you for it.\nWhat you ideally need is a nautilus/dolphin extension that would call kdiff3 for you with the selected files.\nthis is a nautilus extension that does exactly that(keiff3 support) while diff-ext offers far more features, and works even in windows.\n", "Q: How to activate this crontab?

Only seconds after installation, I had full resolution running on all 3 monitors across a single desktop, and each monitor even has a top bar! The performance left something to be desired, however, and it eventually irritated me enough to try to get the proprietary drivers working.\nAll 3 monitors working was a surprise, as I am using 1 DVI connection, 1 VGA connection, and 1 HDMI connection on a HD6850. In windows, to enable a third monitor, one of the monitors must be attached through the display port. Thank you for whoever hacked that one.\nThe problem is, now that I installed the proprietary drivers, I cannot enable my third monitor anymore. AMD CCC gives me an error saying it doesn't know why but it can't be enabled, and something about possible not enough video memory (though its a 1gb card).\nDoes anyone know if there is some kind of tweak I can perform to get the third monitor working again? I know there are a lot of parameters that can be thrown with aticonfig, though none I have found seemed relevant.\nAny help is appreciated.\n\nA: OP answered this question as a comment\n\nI figured out that the default driver is the open source radeon driver, which as it turns out seems to work much better than the proprietary at the moment. Except for ATI's control panel, the open source driver suffices. Search Ubuntu Software Center for 3D Acceleration settings, this helped me with my performance issues.\n\n", "Q: Login via Face Detection Is there any package/.deb that enables the user to automatically login into ubuntu detecting the face of the user?\nI'm using Ubuntu 12.04\n\nA: FOR GDM GDM LOGIN MANAGER\nAdd the PPA repository and Update\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:antonio.chiurazzi/ppa && sudo apt-get update\n\nInstall the Ubuntu  Face Authentication /  Face Recognition Library\nsudo apt-get install pam-face-authentication\n\nTweak and Edit The System\nNow to add the face authentication module to GDM, Ubuntu's default login-manager:\nsudo sed -i '1i auth sufficient pam_face_authentication.so enableX' /etc/pam.d/gdm \nsudo sed -i '1i auth sufficient pam_face_authentication.so enableX' /etc/pam.d/gnome-screensaver\n\nDepending on your webcam model/make you may need to install and add libv4l  to preload:\nCreate the file /etc/ld.so.preload\nPaste in the path to the v4l1compat.so file commonly found in /usr/lib/libv4l\nOpen \"Face Trainer\" (Application > Other), system will scan your face and add to database so that the system recognize your face while logi\nGo  to  System > Administration > Users and Groups, change the password to Asked to login\nGo to System > Administration > Login Screen, choose \"Show the Screen for choosing who will log in\", whis action will disable automatic login.\nDone, you can  logoff  the system and test face authentication login in your ubuntu.\nhttp://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2010/09/login-to-ubuntu-using-your-face/\nand \nhttp://www.ubuntubuzz.com/2011/05/face-authentication-face-recognition.html\ncheck these site you will get more info\n", "Q: How to Download the video files on internet? Like Internet Download Manager for windows,Is there any software to download all files like videos,audios,softwares and all other files in Ubuntu 11.10?\n\nA: Here is a quick solution. You do not even need a software to download videos from web.\nAll you have to do is run following commands after the video has been completely loaded on browser.\n$lsof | grep Flash\n$cat > /proc/PID/fd/FD > filename.flv\nReplace PID and FD with their corresponding value from the output obtained from the first command.\nConsider following example.\nlsof | grep Flash\nchrome     3151     abnormal   23u      REG       8,23  1274744  1058929 /tmp/FlashXXmkVBxq (deleted)\ncat /proc/3151/fd/23 > \"video.flv\"\n\nA: If you just need to download videos (as the question title suggests), Video DownloadHelper it's a nice add-on for Firefox that works fine.\nIf you need a download manager (as the question text suggests), I'd recommend steadyflow. Also, you can use FlashGot for firefox integration.\n\nA: Videodownload helper extention for Firefox works fine for videos.\nDownloadthemAll extention for other files (download acceleration, filter rules to download multiple files at one go, etc.)\n\nA: Even in IDM (or Orbit or any other downloader), you need a link or the URL, which locates the resource and can be used to download the file from the remote server.\nIf you have a link, you need a download manager (like how you used IDM).\nIf your query is limited to downloading videos from the Web, you might want to get their links and use a download manager still. If not, you might want to go over the extensions of your browser.\nDownload Manager for Ubuntu\nI personally recommend SteadyFlow, but you're recommended to go through all of them and choose for youeself. For doing that, open Software Centre, and search for \"downloader\". SteadyFlow is the most rated as of now.\nVideos Only?\nMost popular browsers have extensions that facilitate downloading videos from online streaming websites. Search for them. But in the end, they too just grab the link and download via your browser's download manager (which is pretty slower than a standalone download manager).\nFor example, if you have Firefox, you can press Shift+Ctrl+A to open the \"Add-Ons\". Here, you can search for extensions with queries related to \"download videos\". I personally use FlashGot, which is used to get the link of any media: video, image, music, etc.\nAlternatively, there exist many online tools for that purpose. You can run a Google search with \"download videos online\" for the latest results. You can use those services to download videos from particular websites.\n\nA: Try JDownloader, follow the link.\n", "Q: Add Virtualbox Shortcut in Unity Launcher to boot to a VM Can I create a shortcut to a virtualbox OS in the unity sidebar without it being on the desktop too. \nI tried to right click in virtualbox and create shortcut on desktop then move it. but if i do it then delete the desktop shortcut it renders the unity shortcut useless.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Save the shortcut to another place and don't delete it.\nIf you move it to /usr/share/applications it will be accessible to all users and it will appear on the Dash, but any other place will do.\nThen you can drag the new shortcut to the Unity Bar even from the dash.\n\nA: To add a launcher item that runs a single specific virtual machine we can create a new launcher item as it is described here.\nIn short, to start a Virtual Box machine without the Virtual Box Manager we may add the following command to start the VM in the Exec= section of a .desktop file we can place in ~/.local/share/applications:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=the name you want it to have\nComment=\nExec=VirtualBox --startvm 'name of the machine'\nIcon=icon name\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nStartupNotify=true\n\nAfter giving the .desktop file executable permission we can now start our virtual machine by double-click on it, or we can drag it on the Launcher or the Desktop for convenient access.\nIn more recent versions of VirtualBox the functionality to start a virtualmachine was moved to the VirtualBoxVM application. This needs a change of the EXEC line in the .desktop file tO\nEXEC=/usr/lib/virtualbox/VirtualBoxVM --startvm \"name of the machine\"\n\nor we may use the tool VBoxManage startvm instead.\n", "Q: Ubuntu taking Random Screenshots? This probably sounds crazy, but at random times, Ubuntu 11.10 takes a ton of screenshots at the same time, and then more after that. You hear the clicking sound repeatedly and the dialogue pops up over and over and over. This totally crashes the OS, I had to boot into Windows to be able to post this. I haven't installed anything recently that could be causing this, is there a solution?\nEDIT: It's just the regular print key shortcut, and I'm on a laptop so I'll make sure the key is Okay. The screenshot plugin in CCSM is disabled. This was happening a few days ago but it stopped, so I'll just disable it if it happens again. Thanks for the help! :)\n\nA: Troubleshooting steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Double check that your \"Print Screen\" key isn't physically stuck, or mapped to another function,\n\n*Check settings > keyboard > shortcuts > screenshots and make sure you don't have a special key mapping there,\n\n*Check your Compiz config settings (Put \"compiz\" in the launcher and the settings manager should come up.) for the \"Screenshot plugin\" and try disabling that if it is enabled. \n\n\nIf none of that works clues you in to the problem and it starts happening again, try ctrl-alt-F2 -- that will get you a clean console where you can log in and run \"top\" to note what's actively running in TTY7. To get back to Gnome/Unity, just do ctrl-alt-F7.\n\nA: I had the same issue. In-fact, it was capturing screenshots on pressing some keys: e.g: It captured screenshots whenever I typed character 'b', 'q' randomly. \nBelow is how I solved: \nSettings > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > Reset all\n\nA: I have same issue!

I have a quick question. How do I setup postfix to send an email to another server (Exchange Server) when sending to an email address that has a sub-domain of our main server. For example, say our main server is mail.example.com and we have a Exchange server setup to receive emails from exchange.example.com.
